<h4 id="infinite-series">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>As was the case with Newton, infinite series played a large role in
the early work of Leibniz. Huygens had set him the problem of finding
the sum of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, that is, 2/n(n11).
Leibniz cleverly wrote each term as the sum of two fractions, using</p>
<p>2 1 1</p>
<p>52 2</p>
<p>nðn11Þ n n11</p>
<p>from which it is obvious, on writing out a few terms, that the sum of
the first n terms is</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>22 ;</p>
<p>1 n11</p>
<p>hence that the sum of the infinite series is 2. From this success, he
ingenuously concluded that he would be able to find the sum of almost
any infinite series.</p>
<p>The summation of series again came up in the harmonic triangle, whose
analogies with the arithmetic (Pascal) triangle fascinated Leibniz.</p>
<p>In the arithmetic triangle, each element (that is not in the first
column) is the difference of the two terms directly below it and to the
left; in the harmonic triangle, each term (that is not in the first row)
is the difference of the two terms directly above it and to the right.
Moreover, in the arithmetic triangle, each element (not in the first row
or column) is the sum of all of the terms in the line above it and to
the left, whereas in the harmonic triangle, each element is the sum of
all of the terms in the line below it and to the right. The series in
the first line is the harmonic series, which diverges; for all other
lines, the series converge. The numbers in the second line are one-half
the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, and Leibniz knew that the sum
of this series is 1. The numbers in the third line are one-third the
reciprocals of the pyramidal numbers</p>
<p>nðn11Þðn12Þ</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>1U2U3</p>
<p>and the harmonic triangle indicates that the sum of this series is ;
and so on, for the succeeding rows in the harmonic triangle. The numbers
in the nth diagonal row in this triangle are the reciprocals of the
numbers in the corresponding nth diagonal row of the arithmetic triangle
divided by n.</p>
<p>From his studies on infinite series and the harmonic triangle,
Leibniz turned to reading Pascal’s works on the cycloid and other
aspects of infinitesimal analysis. In particular, it was on reading the
letter of Amos Dettonville on Traite´ des sinus du quart de cercle that
Leibniz reported that a light burst on him. He then realized, in about
1673, that the determination of the tangent to a curve depended on the
ratio of the differences in the ordinates and the abscissas, as these
became infinitely small, and that quadratures depended on the sum of the
ordinates or infinitely thin rectangles making up the area. Just as in
the arithmetic and harmonic triangles the processes of summing and
differencing are oppositely related, so also in geometry the quadrature
and tangent problems, depending on sums and differences, respectively,
are inverses of each other. The connecting link seemed to be through the
infinitesimal or “characteristic” triangle, for where Pascal had used it
to find the quadrature of sines, Barrow had applied it to the tangent
problem. A comparison of the triangle in Barrow’s diagram (Fig. 16.1)
with that in Pascal’s figure (Fig. 16.3) will disclose the marked
similarity that evidently struck Leibniz so forcibly. If EDE is tangent
at D to the unit quarter circle BDC (Fig. 16.3), then,
Pascalsaw,ADistoDIasEEistoRR or EK. For a very small interval RR, the
line EE can be considered to be virtually the same as the arc of the
circle intercepted between the ordinates ER. Hence, in the notation that
Leibniz developed a few years later, we have 1/sinθ5dθ/dx, where θ is
the angle DAC. Because sinθ5p12cos2θ and cosθ5x, we have dθ5dx=p12x2. By
the square-root algorithm and long division (or by the binomial theorem
that Newton communicated to Leibniz, through Oldenburg, in 1676), it
is</p>
<p>a simple matter to find dθ5ð11x2=2138x4 1165 x6 1 Þdx. By use of the
usual method of quadratures, as found in Gregory and Mercator, one
obtains arcsin x5x1x3 /613x5 /4015x7 /1121 (or, allowing for the
negative slope and the constant of integration, arccos x5π/22 x2x3
/623x5 /4025x7 /1122 ). Newton, too, had arrived at this result earlier
and by a similar method. From this, it was possible to find the
seriesforsinxbytheprocessknownasreversion,aschemeapparentlyfirst used by
Newton but rediscovered by Leibniz. If we let y5arcsinx or x5siny and
for x assume a power series of the form x5a1y1a2y2 1a3y3 1 1anyn 1 ,
then, on replacing each x in the power series for arcsin x by this
series in y, we have an identity in y. From this, the quantities a1, a2,
a3,…, an,…are determined by equating coefficients of terms of like
degree. The resulting series, sin y5y2y3 /3!1 y5 /5!2 2 , was therefore
known to both Newton and Leibniz, and2 through sin y1cos y51, the series
for cosy was obtained. The quotient of the sine and cosine series

same way, through reversion of Mercator’s series, Newton and Leibniz
found the series for ex.</p>
<p>The Differential Calculus</p>
<p>By 1676, Leibniz had arrived at the same conclusion that Newton had
reached several years earlier, namely, that he was in possession of a
method that was highly important because of its generality. Whether a
function was rational or irrational, algebraic or transcendental (a word
that Leibniz coined), his operations of finding sums and differences
could always be applied. It therefore was incumbent on him to develop an
appropriate language and notation for the new subject. Leibniz always
had a keen appreciation of the importance of good notations as a help to
thought, and his choice in the case of the calculus was especially
happy. After some trial and error, he fixed on dx and dy for the
smallest possible differences (differentials) in x and y, although,
initially, he had used instead x/d and y/d to indicate the lowering of
the degree. At first, he wrote simply omn. y (or “all y’s”) for the sum
later Ð ydx, the integral sign being an enlarged letter s for sum.
FindingÐ of the ordinates under a curve, but later he used the symbol y
and still</p>
<p>tangents called for the use of the calculus differentialis, and
finding quadratures required the calculus summatorius or the calculus
integralis; from these phrases arose our words “differential calculus”
and “integral calculus.”</p>
<p>The first account of the differential calculus was published by
Leibniz in 1684 under the long but significant title of Nova Methodus
pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus, qua nec Irrationales
Quantitates Moratur (A New Method for Maxima and Minima, and Also for
Tangents, which Is Not Obstructed by Irrational Quantities). Here
Leibniz gave the formulas dxy5x dy1y dx, d(x/y)5(y dx2x dy)/y2, and dxn
5nxn 1 dx for products, quotients, and powers (or roots), together with
geometric applications. These formulas were derived by neglecting
infinitesimals of higher order. If, for example, the smallest
differences in x and y are dx and dy, respectively, then dxy or the
smallest difference in xy is (x1dx) (y1dy)2xy. Inasmuch as dx and dy are
infinitely small, the term dx dy is infinitely infinitely small and can
be disregarded, giving the result dxy5x dy1y dx.</p>
<p>Two years later, again in the Acta Eruditorum, Leibniz published an
explanation of the integral calculus in which quadratures are shown to
be special cases of the inverse method of tangents. Here Leibniz
emphasized the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration in the fundamental theorem of the calculus; he pointed out
that in the integration of familiar functions “is included the greatest
part of all transcendental geometry.” Where Descartes’ geometry had once
excluded all nonalgebraic curves, the calculus of Newton and Leibniz
showed how essential is the role of these in their new analysis. Were
one to exclude transcendental functions from the new analysis, there
would be no integrals of such algebraic functions as 1/x or 1/(11x2).
Moreover, Leibniz seems to have appreciated, as did Newton, that the
operations in the new analysis can be applied to infinite series, as
well as to finite algebraic expressions. In this respect, Leibniz was
less cautious than Newton, for he argued that the infinite series
l2l1l2l112 is equal to . In the light of recent work on divergent
series, we cannot say that it is necessarily “wrong” to assign the “sum”
in this case. It is nevertheless clear that Leibniz allowed himself to
be carried away by the very success of his algorithms and was not
deterred by uncertainty over concepts. Newton’s reasoning was far closer
to the modern foundations of the calculus than was that of Leibniz, but
the plausibility of the Leibnizian view and the effectiveness of the
differential notation made for a readier acceptance of differentials
than of fluxions.</p>
<p>Newton and Leibniz both developed their new analysis rapidly to
include differentials and fluxions of higher order, as in the case of
the formula for curvature of a curve at a point. It probably was lack of
clarity on Leibniz’s part about higher orders of infinitesimals that led
him to the mistaken conclusion that an osculating circle has four
“consecutive” or coincident points of contact with a curve, rather than
the three that determine the circle of curvature.</p>
<p>The formula for the nth derivative (to use the modern language) of a
product, (uv)(n) 5u(n)v(0) 1nu(n 1)v(1) 1 1nu(1)v(n 1) 1n u(0)v(n), a
development paralleling the binomial expansion of (u 1v) , bears the
name of Leibniz. (In the Leibnizian theorem, the exponents in
parentheses indicate orders of differentiation, rather than powers.)
Also named for Leibniz is the rule, given in a memoir of 1692, for
finding the envelope of a one-parameter family of plane curves f(x, y,
c) 50 through the elimination of c from the simultaneous equations f 50
and fc 5 0, where fc is the result of differentiating f partially with
respect to c.</p>
<p>The name of Leibniz is also usually attached to the infinite series
π=45 2121 , one of his first discoveries in mathematics. This series,
which arose in his quadrature of the circle, is only a special case of
the arctangent expansion that had been given earlier by Gregory. The
fact that Leibniz was virtually self-taught in mathematics accounts in
part for the frequent cases of rediscovery that appear in his work.</p>
<p>Determinants, Notations, and Imaginary Numbers</p>
<p>Leibniz’s great contribution to mathematics was the calculus, but
other aspects of his work deserve mention. The generalization of the
binomial theorem to the multinomial theorem—the expansion of such
expressions as (x1y1z)n—is attributed to him, as is also the first
reference in the Western world to the method of determinants. In
Leibniz’s letters to G. F. A. de L’Hospital in 1693, he wrote that he
occasionally used numbers indicating rows and columns in a set of
simultaneous equations:</p>
<p>10111x112y50 10 111x112y50 20121x122y50 or 20 121x122y50 30131x132y50
30 131x132y50:</p>
<p>We would write this as a1 1b1x1c1y50 a2 1b2x1c2y50 a3 1b3x1c3y50:</p>
<p>If the equations are consistent, then</p>
<p>10U21U32 10U22U31 11U22U30 5 11U20U32</p>
<p>12U20U31 12U21U30;</p>
<p>which is equivalent to the modern statement that</p>
<p>a1 b1 c1</p>
<p>a2 b2 c2 50:</p>
<p>a3 b3 c3</p>
<p>Leibniz’s anticipation of determinants went unpublished until 1850
and had to be rediscovered more than half a century later.</p>
<p>Leibniz was very conscious of the power in analysis of
“characteristic” or notation that properly displays the elements of a
given situation. Evidently, he thought highly of this contribution to
notation because of its easy generalization, and he boasted that he
showed that “Vie`te and Descartes hadn’t yet discovered all the
mysteries” of analysis. Leibniz was, in fact, one of the greatest of all
notation builders, being second only to Euler in this respect. It was in
large part due to Leibniz and Newton that the 5 sign of Recorde
triumphed over the symbol of Descartes. To Leibniz, we also owe the
symbols B for “is similar to” and ’ for “is congruent to.” Nevertheless,
Leibniz’s symbols for differentials and integrals remain his greatest
triumphs in the field of notation.</p>
<p>Among relatively minor contributions by Leibniz were his comments on
complex numbers, at a time when they were almost forgotten, and his
noting of the binary system of numeration. He factored x4 1a4 into</p>
<p>ðx1app21Þðx 2 app21Þðx1ap2 2p 1Þðx2ap2 2p 1Þ and he showed that p65
11 2p 31 12 2p 3, an imaginary decomposition of a positive real number
that surprised his contemporaries.p p</p>
<p>Yet Leibniz did not write the square roots of complex numbers in
standard complex form, nor was he able to prove his conjecture that fðx1
2p 1yÞ1fðx 2 2p 1yÞ is real if f(z) is a real polynomial. The ambivalent
status of complex numbers is well illustrated by the remark of Leibniz,
who was also a prominent theologian, that imaginary numbers are a sort
of amphibian, halfway between existence and nonexistence, resembling in
this respect the Holy Ghost in Christian theology. His theology obtruded
itself again in his view of the binary system in arithmetic (in which
only two symbols, unity and zero, are used) as a symbol of the creation
in which God, represented by unity, drew all things from nothingness. He
was so pleased with the idea that he wrote about it to the Jesuits, who
had missionaries in China, hoping that they might use the analogy to
convert the scientifically inclined Chinese emperor to Christianity.</p>
<p>The Algebra of Logic</p>
<p>Leibniz was a philosopher, as well as a mathematician; his most
significant mathematical contribution, other than the calculus, was in
logic. In the calculus, it was the element of universality that
impressed him, and so it was with his other efforts. He hoped to reduce
all things to order. To reduce logical discussions to systematic form,
he wished to develop a universal characteristic that would serve as a
sort of algebra of logic. His first mathematical paper had been a thesis
on combinatorial analysis in 1666, and even at this early date, he had
visions of a formal symbolic logic. Universal symbols or ideograms were
to be introduced for the small number of fundamental concepts needed in
thought, and composite ideas were to be made up from this “alphabet” of
human thoughts, just as formulas are developed in mathematics. The
syllogism itself was to be reduced to a sort of calculus expressed in a
universal symbolism intelligible in all languages. Truth and error would
then be simply a matter of correct or erroneous calculation within the
system, and there would be an end to philosophical controversies.
Moreover, new discoveries could be derived through correct but more or
less routine operations on the symbols, according to the rules of the
logical calculus. Leibniz was justifiably proud of this idea, but his
own enthusiasm for it was not matched by that of others. Leibniz’s
optimism today appears to have been unwarranted, but his suggestion of
an algebra of logic developed in his own thinking over the years and was
revived in the nineteenth century. Since then, it has played a very
significant role in mathematics.</p>
<p>Leibniz as Scientist and Supporter of Science</p>
<p>Leibniz was also a scientist, and he and Huygens developed the notion
of kinetic energy, which ultimately, in the nineteenth century, became
part of the broader concept of energy in general—one that Leibniz would
most certainly have applauded for its universality. Among his general
contributions to the progress of science and mathematics in the
eighteenth century, his impact on the establishment of two major
scientific academies of Europe cannot be underrated. These were the
Prussian Academy of Science, founded in Berlin in 1710, and the Russian
Academy, founded during the decade after Leibniz’s death.</p>
<p>The Bernoulli Family</p>
<p>The discoveries of a great mathematician do not automatically become
part of the mathematical tradition. They may be lost to the world unless
other scholars understand them and take enough interest to look at them
from various points of view, clarify and generalize them, and point out
their implications. Newton, unfortunately, was hypersensitive and did
not communicate freely, and, consequently, the method of fluxions was
not well known outside of England. Leibniz, on the other hand, appeared
to take pleasure in alerting others to the power of his methods and
found devoted disciples who were eager to learn about the differential
and the integral calculus and to transmit the knowledge further.
Foremost among the enthusiasts were two Swiss brothers, Jacques
Bernoulli (1654 1705) and Jean Bernoulli (1667 1748), who were often
also known by the Anglicized forms of their names, James and John (or by
the German equivalents Jakob and Johann); each was as quick to offend as
to feel offended. No family in the history of mathematics has produced
as many celebrated mathematicians as did the Bernoulli family, which,
unnerved by the Spanish Fury in 1576, had fled to Basel from the
Catholic Spanish Netherlands in 1583. Some dozen members of the family
(see the genealogical chart further on) achieved distinction in
mathematics and physics, and four of them were elected foreign
associates of the Acade´mie des Sciences.</p>
<p>The first to attain prominence in mathematics was Jacques Bernoulli.
He was born and died in Basel, but he traveled widely to meet scholars
in other countries. His interest had been directed toward infinitesimals
by works of Wallis and Barrow, and the papers of Leibniz in 1684 1686
enabled him to master the new methods. By 1690, when he suggested the
name “integral” to Leibniz, Jacques Bernoulli was himself contributing
papers on the subject to the Acta Eruditorum. Among other things, he
pointed out that at a maximum or minimum point, the derivative of the
function need not vanish but can take on an “infinite value” or assume
an indeterminate form. Early on, he was interested in infinite series,
and in his first paper on the subject in 1689, he gave the well-known
“Bernoulli inequality” (1 1x)n .1 1nx, where x is real and x .21 and x
6¼ 0 and n is an integer greater than 1, but this can be found earlier
in the seventh lecture of Barrow’s Lectiones geometriae of 1670. To him
is frequently also attributed the demonstration that the harmonic series
is divergent, for most men were unaware of anticipations by Oresme and
Mengoli. Jacques Bernoulli believed, in fact, that his brother had been
the first to observe the divergence of the harmonic series.</p>
<p>The mathematical Bernoullis: a genealogical chart</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by the series of reciprocals of the
figurate numbers, and although he knew that the series of reciprocals of
the perfect squares is convergent, he was unable to find the sum of the
series. Inasmuch as the terms of</p>
<p>1 1 1 1</p>
<p>1 1 2 1 1 2 1</p>
<p>3 n</p>
<p>are, term for term, less than or equal to those of</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1 ð Þ 1 1 1U2 2U3 3U4 n n21</p>
<p>and the latter series was known to converge to 2, it was clear to
Bernoulli that the former must converge.</p>
<p>A frequent correspondent with other mathematicians of the day,
Jacques Bernoulli was au courant with the popular problems, many of
which he solved independently. Among these were finding the equations of
the catenary, the tractrix, and the isochrone, all of which had been
treated by Huygens and Leibniz. The isochrone called for the equation of
a plane curve along which an object would fall with uniform vertical
velocity, and Bernoulli showed that the required curve is the
semicubical parabola. It was in connection with such problems that the
Bernoulli brothers discovered the power of the calculus, and they
remained in touch with Leibniz on all aspects of the new subject.
Jacques Bernoulli, in his work on the isochrone in the Acta Eruditorum
for 1690, used the word “integral,” and a few years later, Leibniz
agreed that calculus integralis would be a better name than calculus
summatorius for the inverse of the calculus differentialis. To
differential equations, Jacques Bernoulli contributed the study of the
“Bernoulli equation” yu 1P(x)y 5Q(x)yn that he and Leibniz and Jean
Bernoulli solved—Jean by reducing it to a linear equation through the
substitution z 5y1 n. Leibniz and the Bernoullis were seeking a solution
to the brachistochrone problem. Jean had first found an incorrect proof
that the curve is a cycloid, but after he challenged his brother to
discover the required curve, Jacques correctly proved that the curve
sought is a cycloid.</p>
<p>The Logarithmic Spiral</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by curves and the calculus, and one
curve bears his name—the “lemniscate of Bernoulli,” given by the polar
equation r2 5a cos 2θ. The curve was described in the Acta Eruditorum of
1694 as resembling a figure eight or a knotted ribbon (lemniscus). Yet
the curve that most caught his fancy was the logarithmic spiral.
Bernoulli showed that it had several striking properties not noted
earlier: (1) the evolute of a logarithmic spiral is an equal logarithmic
spiral; (2) the pedal curve of a logarithmic spiral with respect to its
pole (that is, the locus of the projections of the pole on the tangents
to the given curve) is an equal logarithmic spiral; (3) the caustic by
reflection for rays emanating from the pole (that is, the envelope of
the rays reflected at points on the given curve) is an equal logarithmic
spiral; and (4) the caustic by refraction for rays emanating from the
pole (that is, the envelope of rays refracted at points on the curve) is
an equal logarithmic spiral. These properties led him to request that
the spira mirabilis be engraved on his tombstone, together with the
inscription “Eadem mutata resurgo” (“Though changed, I arise again the
same”).</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli had been led to spirals of a different type when he
repeated Cavalieri’s procedure in bending half of the parabola x2 5ay
about the origin to produce a spiral of Archimedes, but whereas
Cavalieri had studied the transformation by essentially synthetic
methods, Bernoulli used rectangular and polar coordinates. Newton had
used polar coordinates earlier—perhaps as early as 1671—but priority in
publication seems to go to Bernoulli, who in the Acta Eruditorum for
1691 proposed measuring abscissas along the arc of a fixed circle and
ordinates radially along the normals. Three years later, in the same
journal, he proposed a modification that agreed with the system of
Newton. The coordinate y now was the length of the radius vector of the
point, and x was the arc cut off by the sides of the vectorial angle on
a circle of radius a described about the pole as center. These
coordinates are essentially what we would now write as (r, aθ).
Bernoulli,likeNewton,wasinterestedprimarilyinapplicationsofthesystem to
the calculus; hence, he, too, derived formulas for arc length and radius
of curvature in polar coordinates.</p>
<p>Probability and Infinite Series</p>
<p>The mathematical contributions of the Bernoullis, like those of
Leibniz, are found chiefly in articles in journals, especially the Acta
Eruditorum, but Jacques Bernoulli also wrote a classical treatise titled
Ars Conjectandi (or Art of Conjecturing), published in 1713, eight years
after the author’s death. This is the earliest substantial volume on the
theory of probability, for Huygens’s De Ludo Aleae had been only a brief
introduction. The treatise of Huygens is, in fact, reproduced as the
first of the four parts of the Ars Conjectandi, together with a
commentary by Bernoulli. The second part of the Ars Conjectandi includes
a general theory of permutations and combinations, facilitated by the
binomial and multinomial theorems. Here we find the first adequate proof
of the binomial theorem for positive integral powers. The proof is by
mathematical induction, a method of approach that Bernoulli had
rediscovered while reading the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis and
that he had published in the Acta Eruditorum in 1686. He gave Pascal
credit for the binomial theorem with general exponent, but this
attribution appears to be gratuitous. Newton seems to have first stated
the theorem in general form for any rational exponent, although he gave
no proof, this being supplied later by Euler. In connection with the
expansion of (1 11/n)n, Jacques Bernoulli proposed the problem of the
continuous compounding of interest, that is, finding limn-Nð111=nÞn,
because</p>
<p>n</p>

<p>11 1</p>
<p>,1111 1 2 1 n 1 , 3</p>
<p>22 2</p>
<p>it was clear to him that the limit existed.</p>
<p>The second part of the Ars Conjectandi also contains the “Bernoulli
numbers.” These arose as coefficients in a recursion formula for the
sums of the powers of the integers, and they now find many applications
in other connections. The formula was written by Bernoulli as
follows:</p>
<p>1 1 c c c 2 1 c 2 2 c11 2 2 2U3U4</p>
<p>nc 5 nc11 1 nc 1 Anc1 1 ð Þð ÞBnc3</p>
<p>1ð Þð Þð Þð ÞCnc5 ; c c 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 3 c 2 4</p>
<p>2U 3 U 4 U 5 U 6</p>
<p>and the lettersÐ c A, B, C, … (the Bernoulli numbers) are the
coefficients of2 4 where n means the sum of the cth powers of the first
n positive integers Ð n6,… (The numbers can also be defined as n! times
thecoefficients of theÐ Ð the term in n (the last term) in the
corresponding expressions for n , n ,</p>
<p>even-powered terms in the Maclaurin expansion of the function x/(ex
21).) The Bernoulli numbers are useful in writing the infinite series
expansions of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The first three of
the numbers are readily verified as A5, B52, and C 5.</p>
<p>The third and fourth parts of the Ars Conjectandi are devoted
primarily to problems illustrating the theory of probability. The fourth
and last part contains the celebrated theorem that now bears the
author’s name and on which Bernoulli and Leibniz had corresponded: the
so-called law of large numbers. This states that if p is the probability
of an event, if m is the number of occurrences of the event in n trials,
if ε is an arbitrarily small positive number, and if P is the
probability that the inequality jm=n2pj,ε is satisfied, then
limn-NP51.</p>
<p>Appended to the Ars Conjectandi is a long memoir on infinite series.
Besides the harmonic series and the sum of the reciprocals of the
perfect squares, Bernoulli considered the series</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 :</p>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
<p>He knew (by comparing the terms with those in the harmonic series)
that this diverges, and he pointed to the paradox that the ratio of the
“sum” of all of the odd terms to the “sum” of all of the even terms is
as p221 is to 1, from which the sum of all of the odd terms appears to
be less than the sum of all of the even terms, but this is impossible
because, term for term, the former are larger than the latter.</p>
<p>L’Hospital’s Rule</p>
<p>While Jean Bernoulli was in Paris in 1692, he instructed a young
French marquis, G. F. A. de L’Hospital (1661 1704), in the new
Leibnizian discipline, and Jean Bernoulli signed a pact under which, in
return for a regular salary, he agreed to send L’Hospital his
discoveries in mathematics, to be used as the marquis might wish. The
result was that one of Bernoulli’s chief contributions, dating from
1694, has ever since been known as L’Hospital’s rule on indeterminate
forms. Jean Bernoulli had found that if f(x) and g(x) are functions
differentiable at x5a such that f(a)50 and g(a)50 and</p>
<p>f 0ðxÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>x-a g0ðxÞ</p>
<p>exists, then</p>
<p>fðxÞ f 0ðxÞ lim5 lim: x-a gðxÞ x-a g0ðxÞ</p>
<p>This well-known rule was incorporated by L’Hospital in the first
textbook on the differential calculus to appear in print—Analyse des
infiniment petits, published in Paris in 1696. This book, the influence
of which dominated most of the eighteenth century, is based on two
postulates: (1) that one can take as equal two quantities that differ
only by an infinitely small quantity; and (2) that a curve can be
considered as made up of infinitely small straight line segments that
determine, by the angles they make with each other, the curvature of the
curve. These would today scarcely be regarded as acceptable, but
L’Hospital considered them “so self-evident as not to leave the least
scruple about their truth and certainty on the mind of an attentive
reader.” The basic differential formulas for algebraic functions are
derived in the manner of Leibniz, and applications are made to tangents,
maxima and minima, points of inflection, curvature, caustics, and
indeterminate forms. L’Hospital was an exceptionally effective writer,
for his Traite´ analytique des sections coniques, published posthumously
in 1707, did for analytic geometry of the eighteenth century what the
Analyse did for the calculus.</p>
<p>Exponential Calculus</p>
<p>The recent publication of the Bernoulli-L’Hospital correspondence
indicates that much of the work evidently was due to Bernoulli.
Nevertheless, some of the material in the Analyse was undoubtedly the
result of L’Hospital’s independent work, for he was a capable
mathematician. The rectification of the logarithmic curve, for example,
seems to have appeared for the first time in 1692 in a letter from
L’Hospital to Leibniz. Bernoulli did not publish his own textbook on the
differential calculus (which was finally printed in 1924), and the text
on the integral calculus appeared fifty years after it had been
written—in his Opera Omnia of 1742. In the interval, Jean Bernoulli
wrote prolifically on many advanced aspects of analysis—the isochrone,
solids of least resistance, the catenary, the tractrix, trajectories,
caustic curves, isoperimetric problems—achieving a reputation that led
to his being called to Basel in 1705 to fill the chair left vacant by
his brother’s death. He is frequently regarded as the inventor of the
calculus of variations, because of his proposal in 1696 1697 of the
problem of the brachistochrone, and he contributed to differential
geometry through his work on geodesic lines on a surface. To him is also
often ascribed the exponential calculus, for he studied not only the
simple exponential curves y5ax, but general exponentials such as y5xx.
For the area under the curve y5xx from x50 to x51, he found the striking
infinite series representation</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>2 1 2 4 1 :</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>This result he obtained by writing xx 5exlnx, expanding this in the
exponential series, and integrating term by term, using integration by
parts.</p>
<p>Logarithms of Negative Numbers</p>
<p>Jean and Jacques Bernoulli rediscovered the series for sin nθ and cos
nθ, in terms of sin θ and cos θ, which Vie`te had known, and they
extended them, uncritically, to include fractional values of n. Jean was
also aware of relationships between inverse trigonometric functions and
imaginary logarithms, discovering in 1702, through differential
equations, the relationship</p>
<p>arctan z5 lnr : 1 11iz i 12iz</p>
<p>He corresponded with other mathematicians on the logarithms of
negative numbers, but here he mistakenly believed that log (2n)5log
n. He tended to develop trigonometry and the theory of logarithms from
an analytic point of view, and he experimented with several notations
for a function of x, the one nearest to the modern being φx. His vague
notion of a function was expressed as “a quantity composed in any manner
of a variable and any constants.” Among his numerous controversies was
one with British mathematicians over whether the well-known series of
Brook Taylor (1685 1731), published in the Methodus incrementorum of
1715, was a plagiarism of the Bernoulli series</p>
<p>x2 dy x3 d2y ydx5yx 2 1 2 2 :</p>
<p>2! dx 3! dx</p>
<p>Neither Bernoulli nor Taylor was aware that both had been anticipated
by Gregory in the discovery of “Taylor’s series.”</p>
<p>Petersburg Paradox</p>
<p>Jean Bernoulli maintained a zeal for mathematics as lively as was his
persistence in controversy. Moreover, he was the father of three sons,
Nicolaus (1695 1726), Daniel (1700 1782), and Jean II (1710 1790), all
of whom at some stage filled a position as professor of mathematics:
Nicolaus and Daniel at St. Petersburg and Daniel and Jean II at Basel.
(Another Nicolaus (1687 1759), a cousin of the one mentioned previously,
for a time held the chair in mathematics at Padua that Galileo once had
filled.) There were still other Bernoullis who attained some eminence in
mathematics, but of these, none achieved fame comparable to that of the
original two brothers, Jacques and Jean. The most celebrated of the
younger generation was Daniel, whose work in hydrodynamics is recalled
in “Bernoulli’s principle.” In mathematics, he is best known for his
distinction, in the theory of probability, between mathematical
expectation and “moral expectation,” or between “physical fortune” and
“moral fortune.” He assumed that a small increase in a person’s material
means causes an increase in satisfaction that is inversely proportional
to the means. In the form of an equation, dm5K(dp/p), where m is the
moral fortune, p is the physical fortune, and K is a constant of
proportionality. This leads to the conclusion that as the physical
fortune increases geometrically, the moral fortune increases
arithmetically. In 1734, he and his father shared the prize offered by
the Acade´mie des Sciences for an essay on probabilities related to the
inclinations of the orbital planes of the planets; in 1760, he read to
the Paris Acade´mie a paper on the application of probability theory to
the question of the advantage of inoculation against smallpox.</p>
<p>When Daniel Bernoulli went to St. Petersburg in 1725, his older
brother was also called there as professor of mathematics; in the
discussions of the two men, there arose a problem that has come to be
known as the “Petersburg paradox,” probably because it first appeared in
the Commentarii of the Academy there. The problem is as follows: Suppose
that Peter and Paul agree to play a game based on the toss of a coin. If
a head is thrown on the first toss, Paul will give Peter one crown; if
the first toss is a tail, but a head appears on the second toss, Paul
will give Peter two crowns; if a head appears for the first time on the
third toss, Paul will give Peter four crowns, and so on, the amount to
be paid if head appears for the first time on the nth toss being 2n 1
crowns. What should Peter pay Paul for the privilege of playing the
game? Peter’s mathematical expectation, given by</p>
<p>12 1 n 1</p>
<p>U11 U21 3 U2 1 1 n U2 1 ;</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>evidently is infinite, yet common sense suggests a very modest finite
sum. When Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707 1788), made an
empirical test of the matter, he found that in 2084 games Paul would
have paid Peter 10,057 crowns. This indicates that for any one game,
Paul’s expectation, instead of being infinite, is actually something
less than 5 crowns! The paradox raised in the Petersburg problem was
widely discussed during the eighteenth century, with differing
explanations being given. Daniel Bernoulli sought to resolve it through
his principle of moral expectation, in accordance with which he replaced
the amounts 1, 2, 22, 23,…2n,…by 11=2;21=4;41=8;81=16;…. Others
preferred, as a solution of the paradox, to point out that the problem
is inherently impossible in view of the fact that Paul’s fortune is
necessarily finite; hence, he could not pay the unlimited sums that
might be required in the case of a long delay in the appearance of a
head.</p>
