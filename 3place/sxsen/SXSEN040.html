<h4 id="democritus-of-abdera">Democritus of Abdera</h4>
<p>The Heroic Age in mathematics produced half a dozen great figures,
and among them must be included a man who is better known as a chemical
philosopher. Democritus of Abdera (ca. 460 370 BCE) is today celebrated
as a proponent of a materialistic atomic doctrine, but in his time he
had also acquired a reputation as a geometer. He is reported to have
traveled more widely than anyone of his day—to Athens, Egypt,
Mesopotamia, and possibly India—acquiring what learning he could, but
his own achievements in mathematics were such that he boasted that not
even the “rope-stretchers” in Egypt excelled him. He wrote a number of
mathematical works, not one of which is extant today.</p>
<p>The key to the mathematics of Democritus is to be found in his
physical doctrine of atomism. All phenomena were to be explained, he
argued, in terms of indefinitely small and infinitely varied (in size
and shape), impenetrably hard atoms moving about ceaselessly in empty
space. The physical atomism of Leucippus and Democritus may have been
suggested by the geometric atomism of the Pythagoreans, and it is</p>
<p>D e mo c r i tus of Ab dera</p>
<p>not surprising that the mathematical problems with which Democritus
was chiefly concerned were those that demand some sort of infinitesimal
approach. The Egyptians, for example, were aware that the volume of a
pyramid is one-third the product of the base and the altitude, but a
proof of this fact almost certainly was beyond their capabilities, for
it requires a point of view equivalent to the calculus. Archimedes later
wrote that this result was due to Democritus but that the latter did not
prove it rigorously. This creates a puzzle, for if Democritus added
anything to the Egyptian knowledge here, it must have been some sort of
demonstration, albeit inadequate. Perhaps Democritus showed that a
triangular prism can be divided into three triangular pyramids that are
equal in height and area of the base and then deduced, from the
assumption that pyramids of the same height and equal bases are equal,
the familiar Egyptian theorem.</p>
<p>This assumption can be justified only by the application of
infinitesimal techniques. If, for example, one thinks of two pyramids of
equal bases and the same height as composed of indefinitely many
infinitely thin equal cross-sections in one-to-one correspondence (a
device usually known as Cavalieri’s principle, in deference to the
seventeenthcentury geometer), the assumption appears to be justified.
Such a fuzzy geometric atomism might have been at the base of
Democritus’s thought, although this has not been established. In any
case, following the paradoxes of Zeno and the awareness of
incommensurables, such arguments based on an infinity of infinitesimals
were not acceptable. Archimedes consequently could well hold that
Democritus had not given a rigorous proof. The same judgment would be
true with respect to the theorem, also attributed by Archimedes to
Democritus, that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of the
circumscribing cylinder. This result was probably looked on by
Democritus as a corollary to the theorem on the pyramid, for the cone is
essentially a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon of infinitely many
sides.</p>
<p>Democritean geometric atomism was immediately confronted with certain
problems. If the pyramid or the cone, for example, is made up of
indefinitely many infinitely thin triangular or circular sections
parallel to the base, a consideration of any two adjacent laminae
creates a paradox. If the adjacent sections are equal in area, then,
because all sections are equal, the totality will be a prism or a
cylinder and not a pyramid or a cone. If, on the other hand, adjacent
sections are unequal, the totality will be a step pyramid or a step cone
and not the smooth-surfaced figure one has in mind. This problem is not
unlike the difficulties with the incommensurable and with the paradoxes
of motion. Perhaps, in his On the Irrational, Democritus analyzed the
difficulties here encountered, but there is no way of knowing what
direction his attempts may have taken. His extreme unpopularity in the
two dominant philosophical schools of the next century, those of Plato
and Aristotle, may have encouraged the disregard of Democritean ideas.
Nevertheless, the chief mathematical legacy of the Heroic Age can be
summed up in six problems: the squaring of the circle, the duplication
of the cube, the trisection of the angle, the ratio of incommensurable
magnitudes, the paradoxes on motion, and the validity of infinitesimal
methods. To some extent, these can be associated, although not
exclusively, with men considered in this chapter: Hippocrates, Archytas,
Hippias, Hippasus, Zeno, and Democritus. Other ages were to produce a
comparable array of talent, but perhaps never again was any age to make
so bold an attack on so many fundamental mathematical problems with such
inadequate methodological resources. It is for this reason that we have
called the period from Anaxagoras to Archytas the Heroic Age.</p>
