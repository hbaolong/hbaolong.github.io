<h4 id="deductive-reasoning">Deductive Reasoning</h4>
<p>There are several conjectures as to the causes leading to the
conversion of the mathematical prescriptions of pre-Hellenic peoples
into the deductive structure that appears in Greece. Some have suggested
that Thales in his travels had noted discrepancies in pre-Hellenic
mathematics—such as the Egyptian and Babylonian rules for the area of a
circle—and that he and his early successors therefore saw the need for a
strict rational method. Others, more conservative, would place the
deductive form much later—perhaps even as late as the early fourth
century, following the discovery of the incommensurable. Other
suggestions find the cause outside mathematics. One, for example is that
deduction may have come out of logic, in attempts to convince an
opponent of a conclusion by looking for premises from which the
conclusion necessarily follows.</p>
<p>Whether deduction came into mathematics in the sixth century BCE or
the fourth and whether incommensurability was discovered before or after
400 BCE, there can be no doubt that Greek mathematics had undergone
drastic changes by the time of Plato. The dichotomy between number and
continuous magnitude required a new approach to the Babylonian algebra
that the Pythagoreans had inherited. The old problems in which, given
the sum and the product of the sides of a rectangle, the dimensions were
required had to be dealt with differently from the numerical algorithms
of the Babylonians. A “geometric algebra” had to take the place of the
older “arithmetic algebra,” and in this new algebra there could be no
adding of lines to areas or adding of areas to volumes. From now on,
there had to be a strict homogeneity of terms in equations, and the
Mesopotamian normal forms, xy5A, x6y5b, were to be interpreted
geometrically. The obvious conclusion, which the reader can arrive at by
eliminating y, is that one must construct on a given line b a rectangle
whose unknown width x must be such that the area of the rectangle
exceeds the given area A by the square x2 or (in the case of the minus
sign) falls short of the area A by the square x2 (Fig. 4.12). In this
way, the Greeks built up the solution of quadratic equations by their
process known as “the application of areas,” a portion of geometric
algebra that is fully covered by Euclid’s Elements. Moreover, the
uneasiness resulting from incommensurable magnitudes led to an avoidance
of ratios, insofar as possible, in elementary mathematics. The</p>
<p>FIG. 4.12</p>
<p>D e duc t i v e Re a s oning</p>
<p>linear equation ax5bc, for example, was looked on as an equality of
the areas ax and bc, rather than as a proportion—an equality between the
two ratios a:b and c:x. Consequently, in constructing the fourth
proportion, x in this case, it was usual to construct a rectangle OCDB
with sides b5OB and c5OC (Fig. 4.13) and then along OC to lay off OA5a.
One completes rectangle OAEB and draws the diagonal OE cutting CD at P.
It is now clear that CP is the desired line x, for rectangle OARS is
equal in area to rectangle OCDB. Not until Book V of the Elements did
Euclid take up the difficult matter of proportionality.</p>
<p>Greek geometric algebra strikes the modern reader as excessively
artificial and difficult; to those who used it and became adept at
handling its operations, however, it probably appeared to be a
convenient tool. The distributive law a(b1c1d)5ab1ac1ad undoubtedly was
far more obvious to a Greek scholar than to the beginning student of
algebra today, for the former could easily picture the areas of the
rectangles in this theorem, which simply says that the rectangle on a
and the sum of segments b, c, d is equal to the sum of the rectangles on
a and each of the lines b, c, d taken separately (Fig. 4.14). Again, the
identity (a1b)2 5a2 12ab1b2 becomes obvious from a diagram that shows
the three squares and the two equal rectangles in the identity (Fig.
4.15); and a difference of two squares a2 2b2 5(a1b)(a2b) can be
pictured in a similar fashion (Fig. 4.16). Sums, differences, products,
and quotients of</p>
<p>a2 ab</p>
<p>ab b2</p>
<p>ab ac ad</p>
<p>a b b c d</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>b</p>
<p>FIG. 4.14 FIG. 4.15</p>
<p>FIG. 4.16 FIG. 4.17</p>
<p>line segments can easily be constructed with a straightedge and a
compass. Square roots also afford no difficulty in geometric algebra. If
one wishes to find a line x such that x2 5ab, one simply follows the
procedure found in elementary geometry textbooks today. One lays off on
a straight line the segment ABC, where AB5a and BC5b (Fig. 4.17). With
AC as the diameter, one constructs a semicircle (with center O) and at B
erects the perpendicular BP, which is the segment x desired. It is
interesting that here, too, the proof as given by Euclid, probably
following the earlier avoidance of ratios, makes use of areas rather
than proportions. If in our figure we let PO5AO5CO5r and BO5s, Euclid
would say essentially that x2 5r2 2s2 5(r2s)(r1s)5ab.</p>
