<h4 id="infinite-series">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>It is likely that Newton’s indirect approach was fortunate for the
future of his work, for it made clear to him that one could operate with
infinite series in much the same way as with finite polynomial
expressions. The generality of this new infinite analysis was then
confirmed for him when he derived the same infinite series through the
extraction of the square root of 12x2 by the usual algebraic process,
finally verifying the result by multiplying the infinite series by
itself to recover the original radicand 12x2. In the same way, Newton
found that the result obtained for (12x2) 1 by interpolation (that is,
the binomial theorem for n521) agreed with the result found by long
division. Through these examples, Newton had discovered something far
more important than the binomial theorem; he had found that the analysis
by infinite series had the same inner consistency and was subject to the
same general laws as the algebra of finite quantities. Infinite series
were no longer to be regarded only as approximating devices; they were
alternative forms of the functions they represented.</p>
<p>Newton himself never published the binomial theorem, nor did he prove
it, but he wrote out and ultimately published several accounts of his
infinite analysis. The first of these, chronologically, was the De
analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, composed in 1669 on
the basis of ideas acquired in 1665 1666 but not published until 1711.
In this, he wrote,</p>
<p>And whatever the common Analysis 〔that is, algebra〕 performs by
Means of Equations of a finite number of Terms (provided that can be
done) this new method can always perform the same by Means of infinite
Equations. So that I have not made any Question of giving this the Name
of Analysis likewise. For the Reasonings in this are no less certain
than in the other; nor the Equations less exact; albeit we Mortals whose
reasoning Powers are confined within narrow Limits, can neither express,
nor so conceive all the Terms of these Equations as to know exactly from
thence the Quantities we want. To conclude, we may justly reckon that to
belong to the Analytic Art, by the help of which the Areas and Lengths,
etc. of Curves may be exactly and geometrically determined.</p>
<p>From then on, encouraged by Newton, men no longer tried to avoid
infinite processes, as had the Greeks, for these were now regarded as
legitimate in mathematics.</p>
<p>Newton’s De Analysi contained more, of course, than some work on
infinite series; it is also of great significance as the first
systematic account of Newton’s chief mathematical discovery—the
calculus. Barrow, the most important of Newton’s mentors, was primarily
a geometer, and Newton himself has often been described as an exponent
of pure geometry, but the earliest manuscript drafts of his thoughts
show that Newton made free use of algebra and a variety of algorithmic
devices and notations. He had not, by 1666, developed his notation of
fluxions, but he had formulated a systematic method of differentiation
that was not far removed from that published in 1670 by Barrow. It is
only necessary to replace Barrow’s a with Newton’s qo and Barrow’s e
with Newton’s po to arrive at Newton’s first form for the calculus.
Evidently, Newton regarded o as a very small interval of time and op and
oq as the small increments by which x and y change in this interval. The
ratio q/p, therefore, will be the ratio of the instantaneous rates of
change of y and x, that is, the slope of the curve f(x, y)50. The slope
of the curve yn 5xm, for example, is found from (y1oq)n 5 (x1op)m by
expanding both sides by the binomial theorem, dividing through by o, and
disregarding terms that still contain o, the result being</p>
<p>qp 5 mn xymn11 or qp 5 mn xm=n1 :</p>
<p>Fractional powers no longer bothered Newton, for his method of
infinite series had given him a universal algorithm.</p>
<p>When dealing later with an explicit function of x alone, Newton
dropped his p and q and used o as a small change in the independent
variable, a notation that was also used by Gregory. In the De analysi,
for example, Newton proved as follows that the area under the curve
y5axm/n is given by</p>
<p>axðm=nÞ11</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>ðm=nÞ11</p>
<p>Let the area be z and assume that</p>
<p>z5 n axðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>Let the moment or infinitesimal increase in the abscissa be o. Then
the new abscissa will be x1o, and the augmented area will be</p>
<p>z1oy5 n aðx1oÞðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>If here one applies the binomial theorem, cancels the equal term</p>
<p>z and n axðm1nÞ=n; m1n</p>
<p>divides through by o, and discards the terms that still contain o,
the result will be y5axm/n. Conversely, if the curve is y5axm/n, then
the area will be</p>
<p>z5 n axðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>This seems to be the first time in the history of mathematics that an
area was found through the inverse of what we call differentiation,
although the possibility of such a procedure evidently was known to
Barrow and Gregory and perhaps also to Torricelli and Fermat. Newton
became the effective inventor of the calculus because he was able to
exploit the inverse relationship between slope and area through his new
infinite analysis. This is why in later years he frowned on any effort
to separate his calculus from his analysis by infinite series.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions</p>
<dl>
<dt>In Newton’s most popular presentation of his infinitesimal methods,
he looked on x and y as flowing quantities, or fluents, of which the
quantities p and q (above) were the fluxions or rates of change; when he
wrote up this view of the calculus in about 1671, he replaced p and q
by</dt>
<dd>
<p>:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the “pricked letters” x and y. The quantities or fluents of which x
and y are the fluxions he designated by x0 and y0. By doubling the dots
and dashes, he was able to represent fluxions of fluxions or fluents of
fluents. The title of the work, when published long afterward in 1742
(although an English translation appeared earlier in 1736), was not
simply the method of fluxions, but Methodus Fluxionum et Serierum
Infinitorum.</p>
<p>In 1676, Newton wrote yet a third account of his calculus, under the
title De Quadratura Curvarum, and this time he sought to avoid both
infinitely small quantities and flowing quantities, replacing these with
a doctrine of “prime and ultimate ratios.” He found the “prime ratio of
nascent augments” or the “ultimate ratio of evanescent increments” as
follows. Let the ratio of the changes in x and xn be desired. Let o be
the increment in x and (x1o)n 2xn the corresponding increment in xn.
Then the ratio of the increments will be</p>
<p>n 1 nðn21Þ n 2</p>
<p>1 :nx 1ox 1 :</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>To find the prime and the ultimate ratio, one lets o vanish,
obtaining the ratio 1:(nxn 1). Here, Newton is very close indeed to the
limit concept, the chief objection being the use of the word “vanish.”
Is there really a ratio between increments that have vanished? Newton
did not clarify this question, and it continued to distract
mathematicians during the entire eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The Principia</p>
<p>Newton discovered his method of infinite series and the calculus in
1665 1666, and within the next decade he wrote at least three
substantial accounts of the new analysis. The De Analysi circulated
among friends, including John Collins (1625 1683) and Isaac Barrow, and
the infinite binomial expansion was sent to Oldenburg and Leibniz, but
Newton made no move to publish his results, even though he knew that
Gregory and Mercator in 1668 had disclosed their work on infinite
series. The first account of the calculus that Newton put into print
appeared in 1687 in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. This
book is generally described as presenting the foundations of physics and
astronomy in the language of pure geometry. It is true that a large part
of the work is in synthetic form, but there is also a large admixture of
analytic passages. Section I of Book I is, in fact, titled “The method
of first and last ratios of quantities, by the help of which we
demonstrate the propositions that follow,” including Lemma I:</p>
<p>Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time
converge continually to equality, and before the end of that time
approach nearer to each other than by any given difference, become
ultimately equal.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an attempt to define the limit of a function.
Lemma VII in Section I postulates that “the ultimate ratio of the arc,
chord, and tangent, any one to any other, is the ratio of equality.”
Other lemmas in that section assume the similarity of certain
“evanescent triangles.” Every now and then in Book I, the author has
recourse to an infinite series. Yet calculus algorithms do not appear
until in Book II, Lemma II, we come to the cryptic formulation</p>
<p>The moment of any genitum is equal to the moments of each of the
generating sides multiplied by the indices of the powers of those sides,
and by their coefficients continually.</p>
<p>Newton’s explanation shows that by the word “genitum,” he has in mind
what we call a “term,” and that by the “moment” of a genitum, he means
the infinitely small increment. Designating by a the moment of A and by
b the moment of B, Newton proves that the moment of AB is aB1bA, that
the moment of An is naAn 1, and that the moment of 1/A is 2a/(A2). Such
expressions, which are the equivalents of the differential of a product,
a power, and a reciprocal, respectively, constitute Newton’s first
official pronouncement on the calculus, making it easy to understand why
so few mathematicians of the time mastered the new analysis in terms of
Newtonian language.</p>
<p>Newton was not the first one to differentiate or to integrate or to
see the relationship between these operations in the fundamental theorem
of the calculus. His discovery consisted of the consolidation of these
elements into a general algorithm that is applicable to all functions,
whether algebraic or transcendental. This was emphasized in a scholium
that Newton published in the Principia immediately following Lemma
II:</p>
<p>In a letter of mine to Mr. J. Collins, dated December 10, 1672,
having described a method of tangents, which I suspected to be the same
with Sluse’s method, which at that time was not made public, I added
these words: This is one particular, or rather a Corollary, of a general
method, which extends itself, without any troublesome calculation, not
only to the drawing of tangents to any curved lines whether geometrical
or mechanical …but also to the resolving other abstruser kinds of
problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centres of gravity of
curves, etc.; nor is it (as Hudden’s method de maximis et minimis)
limited to equations which are free from surd quantities. This method I
have interwoven with that other of working in equations by reducing them
to infinite series.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the Principia, Newton admitted that Leibniz
was in possession of a similar method, but in the third edition of 1726,
following the bitter quarrel between adherents of the two men concerning
the independence and priority of the discovery of the calculus, Newton
deleted the reference to the calculus of Leibniz. It is now fairly clear
that Newton’s discovery antedated that of Leibniz by about ten years,
but that the discovery by Leibniz was independent of that of Newton.
Moreover, Leibniz is entitled to priority of publication, for he printed
an account of his calculus in 1684 in the Acta Eruditorum, a sort of
“scientific monthly” that had been established only two years
earlier.</p>
<p>In the opening sections of the Principia, Newton had so generalized
and clarified Galileo’s ideas on motion that ever since, we refer to
this formulation as “Newton’s laws of motion.” Then Newton went on to
combine these laws with Kepler’s laws in astronomy and Huygens’s law of
centripetal force in circular motion to establish the great unifying
principle that any two particles in the universe, whether two planets or
two mustard seeds, or the sun and a mustard seed, attract each other
with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance between
them. In the statement of this law, Newton had been anticipated by
others, including Robert Hooke (1638 1703), professor of geometry at
Gresham College and Oldenburg’s successor as secretary of the Royal
Society. But Newton was the first to convince the world of the truth of
the law because he was able to handle the mathematics required in the
proof.</p>
<p>For circular motion, the inverse square law is easily derived from
Newton’s f5ma, Huygens’s a5v2 /r, and Kepler’s T2 5Kr3 simply by noting
that T ~r=v and then eliminating T and v from the equations, to arrive
at f ~1=r2. To prove the same thing for ellipses, however, required
considerably more mathematical skill. Moreover, to prove that the
distance is to be measured from the center of the bodies was so
difficult a task that it evidently was this integration problem that
induced Newton to lay the work on gravitation aside for almost twenty
years following his discovery of the law in the plague year of 1665
1666. When, in 1684, his friend Edmund Halley (1656 1742), a
mathematician of no mean ability who also had guessed at the inverse
square law, pressed Newton for a proof, the result was the exposition in
the Principia. So impressed was Halley with the quality of this book
that he had it published at his own expense.</p>
<p>The Principia, of course, contains far more than the calculus, the
laws of motion, and the law of gravitation. It includes, in science,
such things as the motions of bodies in resisting media and the proof
that for isothermal vibrations, the velocity of sound should be the
speed with which a body would strike the earth if falling without
resistance through a height that is half that of a uniform atmosphere
having the density of air at the surface of the earth and exerting the
same pressure. Another of the scientific conclusions in the Principia is
a mathematical proof of the invalidity of the prevailing cosmic
scheme—the Cartesian theory of vortices—for Newton showed, at the close
of Book II, that according to the laws of mechanics, planets in vortical
motion would move more swiftly in aphelion than in perihelion, which
contradicts the astronomy of Kepler. Nevertheless, it took about forty
years before the Newtonian gravitational view of the universe displaced
the Cartesian vortical cosmology in France.</p>
<p>Theorems on Conics</p>
<p>One who reads only the headings of the three books in the Principia
will get the erroneous impression that it contains nothing but physics
and astronomy, for the books are titled, respectively, I. The Motion of
Bodies, II. The Motion of Bodies (in Resisting Mediums), and III. The
System of the World. Yet the treatise also contains a great deal of pure
mathematics, especially concerning the conic sections. In Lemma XIX of
Book I, for example, the author solves the Pappus four-line-locus
problem, adding that his solution is “not an analytical calculus but a
geometrical composition, such as the ancients required,” an oblique and
pejorative reference, apparently, to the treatment of the problem given
by Descartes.</p>
<p>Throughout the Principia, Newton gave preference to a geometric
approach, but we have seen that where he found it expedient to do so, he
did not hesitate to appeal to his method of infinite series and the
calculus. Most of Section II of Book II, for example, is analytic. On
the other hand, Newton’s handling of the properties of conics is almost
exclusively synthetic, for here Newton had no need to resort to
analysis. Following the Pappus problem, he gave a couple of organic
generations of conics through intersections of moving lines, and then he
used these in half a dozen succeeding propositions to show how to
construct a conic satisfying five conditions: passing through five
points, for example, or tangent to five lines or through two points and
tangent to three lines.</p>
<p>Optics and Curves</p>
<p>The Principia is the greatest monument to Newton, but it is by no
means the only one. His paper in the 1672 Philosophical Transactions
concerning the nature of color was of great importance to physics, for
it was here that Newton announced what he regarded as one of the oddest
of all of the operations of nature—that white light was merely a
combination of rays of varying color, each color having its own
characteristic index of refraction. Such a revolutionary view was not
easy for his contemporaries to accept, and the ensuing controversy upset
Newton. For fifteen years, he published nothing further until the urging
of Halley induced him to write and publish the Principia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three versions of his calculus that he had written
from 1669 to 1676, as well as a treatise on optics that he had composed,
remained in manuscript form.</p>
<p>About fifteen years after the Principia appeared, Hooke died, and
then, finally, Newton’s aversion to publication seems to have abated
somewhat. The Opticks appeared in 1704, and appended to it were two
mathematical works: the De Quadratura Curvarum, in which an intelligible
account of the Newtonian methods in the calculus finally appeared in
print, and a little treatise titled Enumeratio Curvarum Tertii Ordinis
(Enumeration of Curves of Third Degree). The Enumeratio had also been
composed by 1676, and it is the earliest instance of a work devoted
solely to graphs of higher plane curves in algebra. Newton noted
seventy-two species of cubics (half a dozen are omitted), and a curve of
each species is carefully drawn. For the first time, two axes are
systematically used, and there is no hesitation about negative
coordinates. Among the interesting properties of cubics indicated in
this treatise are the fact that a third-degree curve can have not more
than three asymptotes (as a conic can have no more than two) and that as
all conics are projections of the circle, so all cubics are projections
of a “divergent parabola” y2 5ax3 1bx2 1cx1d.</p>
<p>Polar and Other Coordinates</p>
<p>The Enumeratio was not Newton’s only contribution to analytic
geometry. In the Method of Fluxions, written in Latin about 1671, he had
suggested eight new types of coordinate system. One of these, Newton’s
“Third Manner” of determining a curve was through what now are called
“bipolar coordinates.” If x and y are the distances of a variable point
from two fixed points or poles, then the equations x1y5a and x2y5a
represent ellipses and hyperbolas, respectively, and ax1by 5 c are ovals
of Descartes. This type of coordinate system is infrequently used today,
but that given by Newton as his “Seventh Manner; For Spirals” is now
familiarly known under the name of “polar coordinates.” Using x where we
now use 0 or φ and y where we use r or ρ, Newton found the subtangent to
the spiral of Archimedes by5ax, as well as to other spirals. Having
given the formula for radius of curvature in rectangular
coordinates,</p>
<p>5ð11y:2Þp1:1y:2 ;</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>z</p>
<p>where z5y:; he wrote the corresponding formula in polar coordinates
as</p>
<p>y1yzz</p>
<p>Rsinc5 1zz2z:;</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>where z5y:=y and c is the angle between the tangent and the radius
vector.</p>
<p>Newton also gave equations for the transformation from rectangular to
polar coordinates, expressing these as xx1yy5tt and tv5y, where t is the
radius vector and v is a line representing the sine of the vectorial
angle associated with the point (x, y) in Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>Newton’s Method and Newton’s Parallelogram</p>
<p>In the Method of Fluxions, as well as in De Analysi, we find
“Newton’s method” for the approximate solution of equations. If the
equation to be solved is f(x)50, one first locates the desired root
between two values x5a1 and x5b1 such that in the interval (a1, b1)
neither the first nor the second derivative vanishes, or fails to exist.
Then, for one of the values, say, x5a1, f(x) and fv(x) will have the
same sign. In this case, the value x5a2 will be a better approximation
if</p>
<p>a25a1 2 fða1Þ ;</p>
<p>f 0ða1Þ</p>
<p>and this procedure can be applied iteratively to obtain as precise an
approximation an as may be desired. If f(x) is of the form x2 2a2, the
successive approximations in the Newton method are the same as those
found in the Old Babylonian square-root algorithm; hence, this ancient
procedure is sometimes unwarrantedly called “Newton’s algorithm.” If
f(x) is a polynomial, Newton’s method is in essence the same as the
Chinese-Arabic method named for Horner, but the great advantage of the
Newtonian method is that it applies equally to equations involving
transcendental functions.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions also contained a diagram that later became
known as “Newton’s parallelogram,” useful in developments in infinite
series and in the sketching of curves. For a polynomial equation f(x,
y)50, one forms a grid or a lattice the intersection points of which are
to correspond to terms of all possible degrees in the equation f(x,
y)50. On this “parallelogram,” one connects by straight-line segments
those intersections that correspond to terms actually appearing in the
equation and then forms a portion of a polygon convex toward the point
of zero degree. In Fig. 16.2, we have drawn the diagram for the folium
of Descartes, x3 1y3 23axy50. Then, the equations that are obtained by
equating to zero in turn the totality of terms from the given equation
whose lattice points lie on each of the segments will be approximating
equations for branches of the curve through the origin. In the case of
the folium of Descartes, the approximating curves are x3 23axy50 (or the
parabola x2 53ay) and</p>
<p>y3 23axy50 (or the parabola y2 53ax). The graphing of portions of
these parabolas near the origin will aid in the rapid sketching of the
given equation f(x, y) 50.</p>
<p>The Arithmetica Universalis</p>
<p>The three Newtonian books that are best known today are the
Principia, the Method of Fluxions, and the Opticks; there is also a
fourth work that in the eighteenth century appeared in a greater number
of editions than did the other three, and it, too, contained valuable
contributions. This was the Arithmetica Universalis, a work composed
between 1673 and 1683, perhaps for Newton’s lectures at Cambridge, and
first published in 1707. This influential treatise contains the
formulas, usually known as “Newton’s identities,” for the sums of the
powers of the roots of a polynomial equation. Cardan had known that the
sum of the roots of xn 1a1xn 1 1an 1x1an 5 0 is 2a1, and</p>
<p>Vie`te had carried the relations between roots and coefficients
somewhat further. In 1629, Girard had shown how to find the sum of the
squares of the roots or the sum of the cubes or of the fourth powers,
but it was Newton who generalized this work to cover all powers. If K#
n, the</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK 1 1 1aKK 50 and</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK1 1 1aKS0 1aK 11S1 1 1anSKn 50 both hold; if K.n, the
relationship</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK1 1 1an1SKn11 1anSK n 50</p>
<p>holds, where Si is the sum of the ith powers of the roots. Using
these relationships recursively, the sums of the powers of the roots can
readily be found for any integral power. In the Arithmetica Universalis,
there is also a theorem generalizing Descartes’ rule of signs to
determine the number of imaginary roots of a polynomial, as well as a
rule for an upper bound for the positive roots.</p>
<p>The longest section in the Arithmetica Universalis is that on the
resolution of geometric questions. Here the solution of cubic equations
is carried out with the help of a given conic section, for Newton
regarded geometric constructions through curves other than the line and
the circle as part of algebra, rather than of geometry:</p>
<p>Equations are Expressions of Arithmetical Computation and properly
have no place in Geometry. Therefore the conic sections and all other
Figures must be cast out of plane Geometry, except the right Line and
the Circle. Therefore all these descriptions of the Conicks in piano,
which the Moderns are so fond of, are foreign to Geometry.</p>
<p>Newton’s conservatism here is in sharp contrast with his radical
views in analysis—and with pedagogical views of the mid-twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Later Years</p>
<p>The Principia was the first of Newton’s mathematical treatises to be
published, but it was the last in order of composition. Fame had come to
him relatively promptly, for he had been elected to the Royal Society in
1672, four years after he had constructed his reflecting telescope (the
idea for which had also occurred to Gregory even earlier). The Principia
met with enthusiastic approval, and in 1689, Newton was elected to
represent Cambridge in the British Parliament. Despite the generous
recognition he received, Newton became depressed and suffered a nervous
breakdown in 1692. He accepted an appointment as Warden of the Mint in
1696, becoming Master of the Mint three years later. Newton retained his
extraordinary mathematical ability to the very last; when Leibniz in
1716 (the last year of his life) challenged Newton to find the
orthogonal trajectories of a one-parameter family of plane curves,
Newton solved the problem within a few hours and gave a method for
finding trajectories in general. (Earlier, in 1696, Newton had been
challenged to find the brachistochrone, or curve of quickest descent,
and the day after receiving the problem he gave the solution, showing
the curve to be a cycloid.)</p>
<p>Honors were heaped on Newton in his later years. In 1699, he was
elected a foreign associate of the Acade´mie des Sciences; in 1703, he
became president of the Royal Society, holding the post for the rest of
his life; and in 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne. Nevertheless, one
event cast a cloud over Newton’s life after 1695. In that year, Wallis
told him that in Holland, the calculus was regarded as the discovery of
Leibniz. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (1664 1753), an obscure
Swiss mathematician who had moved to England, implied in a paper to the
Royal Society that Leibniz may have taken his ideas on the calculus from
Newton. At this affront, Leibniz, in the Acta Eruditorum for 1704,
insisted that he was entitled to priority in publication and protested
to the Royal Society against the imputation of plagiarism. In 1705,
Newton’s De Quadratura Curvarum was unfavorably reviewed (by Leibniz?)
in the Acta Eruditorum, and in 1708, John Keill (1671 1721), an Oxford
professor, vigorously supported Newton’s claims against those of Leibniz
in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Leibniz’s repeated appeals
to the Royal Society for justice finally led the Society to appoint a
committee to study the matter and to report on it. The committee’s
report, under the title Commercium epistolicum, was published in 1712,
but it left matters unimproved. It reached the banal conclusion that
Newton was the first inventor, a point that had not been questioned
seriously in the first place. Implications of plagiarism were supported
by the committee in terms of documents that they assumed Leibniz had
seen, but that we now know he had not received. The bitterness of
national feeling reached such a point that in 1726, a decade after
Leibniz had died, Newton deleted from the third edition of the Principia
all reference to the fact that Leibniz had possessed a method in the
calculus similar to the Newtonian.</p>
<p>As a consequence to the disgraceful priority dispute, British
mathematicians were to some extent alienated from workers on the
Continent during much of the eighteenth century. On his death, Newton
was buried in
WestminsterAbbeywithsuchpompthatVoltaire,whoattendedthefuneral, said
later, “I have seen a professor of mathematics, only because he was
great in his vocation, buried like a king who had done good to his
subjects.”</p>
