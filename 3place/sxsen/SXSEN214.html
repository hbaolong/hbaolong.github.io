<h4 id="gausss-later-work">Gauss’s Later Work</h4>
<p>By the time the work on curved surfaces had appeared, the
mathematical climate in Germany was beginning to change. One of the most
significant aspects of this change was the founding of a new journal in
1809. This was the Annales de Mathe´matiques Pures et Applique´es,
edited by Joseph-Diaz Gergonne (1771 1859). In Germany, a periodical
similar to Gergonne’s Annales, and even more successful, was begun in
1826 by August Leopold Crelle (1780 1855) under the title Journal fu¨r
die reine und angewandte Mathematik. So heavily weighted were the
articles in the direction of pure (reine) mathematics (notably those by
Abel, six of which appeared in the very first volume) that wags
suggested the title might be more appropriate if the two German words
und angewandte (“and applied”) were replaced by the single word
unangewandte (“unapplied”). Gauss contributed two short articles to this
new venture: one was a proof of “Harriot’s theorem in algebra,” the
other contained the statement of Gauss’s principle of least constraint.
He continued to submit his major memoirs to the Go¨ttingen Gesellschaft
der Wissenschaften, however. An important memoir on capillarity was
published by the Go¨ttingen Society, as were his two influential memoirs
on number theory. Historians often cite the first of these, published in
1832, because it contains Gauss’s geometric representation of complex
numbers. The importance of the memoir as a whole lies in the fact that
it pointed the way to extending the theory of numbers from the reals to
the complex field and beyond. As noted previously, this was crucial in
the work of later mathematicians.</p>
<p>At the more elementary level, it is interesting to observe that the
graphical representation of complex numbers had already been discovered
in 1797 by Caspar Wessel (1745 1818) and published in the transactions
of the Danish academy for 1798, but Wessel’s work went virtually
unnoticed; hence, today the plane of complex numbers is usually referred
to as the Gaussian plane, even though Gauss did not publish his views
until some thirty years after Wessel did. No one before Wessel and Gauss
took the obvious step of thinking of the real and imaginary parts of a
complex number a1bi as rectangular coordinates of points in a plane.
Imaginary numbers, for these could now be visualized in the sense that
every point in the plane corresponds to a complex number, and the old
ideas about the nonexistence of imaginary numbers were generally
abandoned.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years of his life, Gauss published only two
major papers of mathematical interest. One was his fourth proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra, which he released at the time of his
doctoral jubilee in 1849, fifty years after the publication of his first
proof. The other was an influential memoir on potential theory, which
appeared in 1840, in one of the volumes of geomagnetic results that he
coedited with his younger friend, the physicist Wilhelm Weber (1804
1891). Geomagnetic issues occupied much of his time in the 1830s and
early forties; he also devoted effort in the late thirties to issues
pertaining to weights and measures. Most of his publications in the last
decade of his life reflect work at the astronomical observatory; they
deal with the newer minor planets, with observations of the recently
discovered planet Neptune, and with other data of interest to
astronomers of the day, who read of them in the Astronomische
Nachrichten.</p>
<p>Gauss’s mathematics provided the starting point for some of the main
research areas of modern mathematics. Except for his personal fame and
the fortune he amassed by making shrewd investments, his external
circumstances were similar to those of many earlier mathematicians,
however. His main obligations lay in running an observatory and
performing various duties for his government. He had teaching
responsibilities, but because most of his students were ill-prepared, he
avoided classroom teaching as much as possible, feeling that the returns
were not worth the investment in time. His best students tended to
become astronomers, rather than mathematicians, although some, such as
August Ferdinand Mo¨bius, made a name for themselves in mathematics.
Most of his research results, aside from those published as books,
appeared in the publications of the Go¨ttingen Society of Science or in
journals devoted to astronomy and geodesy—initially, in Franz Xaver von
Zach’s Monatliche Korrespondenz zur Befo¨rderung der Erd-und
Himmelskunde; after 1820, in the Astronomische Nachrichten. His
mathematical communications were restricted to correspondence with a few
friends and occasional visits of younger colleagues from abroad.</p>
