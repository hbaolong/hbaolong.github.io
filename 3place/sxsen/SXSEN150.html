<h4 id="evangelista-torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</h4>
<p>The year 1647 in which Cavalieri died also marked the death of
another disciple of Galileo’s, the young Evangelista Torricelli (1608
1647). But in many ways, Torricelli represented the new generation of
mathematicians that was building rapidly on the infinitesimal foundation
that Cavalieri had sketched all too vaguely. Had Torricelli not died so
prematurely, Italy might have continued to share the lead in new
developments; as it turned out, France was the undisputed mathematical
center during the second third of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Torricelli was trained in mathematics at several Jesuit institutions
before studying with Benedetto Castelli, whose secretary he was for six
years. He became interested in the cycloid, possibly on the suggestion
of Marin Mersenne, perhaps through Galileo, whom Torricelli, like
Mersenne, greatly admired. He had brought himself to Galileo’s attention
while handling Castelli’s correspondence. In 1643, Torricelli sent
Mersenne the quadrature of the cycloid, and in 1644, he published a work
with the title De Dimensione Parabolae, to which he appended both the
quadrature of the cycloid and the construction of the tangent.
Torricelli made no mention of the fact that Gilles Persone de Roberval
had arrived at these results before him, and so in 1646, Roberval wrote
a letter accusing Torricelli of plagiarism from him and from Pierre de
Fermat (on maxima and minima). It is clear now that priority of
discovery belongs to Roberval, but priority in publication goes to
Torricelli, who probably rediscovered the area and the tangent
independently. Torricelli gave two quadratures, one making use of
Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles and the other of the ancient “method
of exhaustion.” For finding the tangent of the curve, he employed a
composition of motions reminiscent of Archimedes’ tangent to his
spiral.</p>
<p>E vangeli s t a Torricelli</p>
<p>The idea of the composition of movements was not original with either
Torricelli or Roberval, for Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, and others
had used it. Torricelli may have derived the idea from any one of these
men. Both Torricelli and Roberval applied the kinematic method to other
curves as well. A point on the parabola, for example, moves away from
the focus at the same rate at which it moves away from the directrix;
hence, the tangent will be the bisector of the angle between lines in
these two directions. Torricelli also made use of Fermat’s method of
tangents for the higher parabolas and extended Cavalieri’s comparison of
the parabola and the spiral by considering arc length, as well as area.
In the 1640s, they showed that the length of the first rotation of the
spiral r5aθ is equal to the length of the parabola x2 52ay from x50 to
x52πa. Fermat, ever one to seek generalizations, introduced the higher
spirals rn 5aθ and compared the arcs of these with the lengths of his
higher parabolas xn 1 52ay. Torricelli studied spirals of various kinds,
discovering the rectification of the logarithmic spiral.</p>
<p>Problems involving infinitesimals were by far the most popular at the
time, and Torricelli in particular delighted in these. In the De
Dimensione Parabolae, for instance, Torricelli gave twenty-one different
proofs of the quadrature of the parabola, using approaches about evenly
divided between the use of indivisibles and the “method of exhaustion.”
One in the first category is almost identical with the mechanical
quadrature given by Archimedes in his Method, presumably not then
extant. As might be anticipated, one in the second category is virtually
that given in Archimedes’ treatise On the Quadrature of the Parabola,
extant and well known at the time. Had Torricelli arithmetized his
procedures in this connection, he would have been very close to the
modern limit concept, but he remained under the heavily geometric
influence of Cavalieri and his other Italian contemporaries.
Nevertheless, Torricelli far outdid them in the flexible use of
indivisibles to achieve new discoveries.</p>
<p>One novel result of 1641 that greatly pleased Torricelli was his
proof that if an infinite area, such as that bounded by the hyperbola
xy5a2, an ordinate x2b, and the axis of abscissas, is revolved about the
x-axis, the volume of the solid generated may be finite. Torricelli
believed that he was first to discover that a figure with infinite
dimensions can have a finite magnitude, but in this respect, he may have
been anticipated by Fermat’s work on the areas under the higher
hyperbolas or possibly by Roberval and certainly by Oresme in the
fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Among the problems that Torricelli handled just before his premature
death in 1647 was one in which he sketched the curve whose equation we
should write as x5logy, perhaps the first graph of a logarithmic
function, thirty years after the death of the discoverer of logarithms
as a computational device. Torricelli found the area bounded by the
curve, its asymptote, and an ordinate, as well as the volume of the
solid obtained on revolving the area about the x-axis.</p>
<p>Torricelli was one of the most promising mathematicians of the
seventeenth century, which is often referred to as the century of
genius. Mersenne had made the work of Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval
known in Italy, both through correspondence with Galileo dating from
1635 and during a pilgrimage to Rome in 1644. Torricelli promptly
mastered the new methods, although he always favored the geometric over
the algebraic approach. Torricelli’s brief association with the blind
and aged Galileo in 1641 1642 had also aroused in the younger man an
interest in physical science, and today he is probably better recalled
as the inventor of the barometer than as a mathematician. He studied the
parabolic paths of projectiles fired from a point with fixed initial
speeds but with varying angles of elevation and found that the envelope
of the parabolas is another parabola. In going from an equation for
distance in terms of time to that for speed as a function of time, and
inversely, Torricelli saw the inverse character of quadrature and
tangent problems. Had he enjoyed the normal span of years, it is
possible that he would have become the inventor of the calculus, but a
cruel malady cut short his life in Florence only a few days after his
thirty-ninth birthday.</p>
