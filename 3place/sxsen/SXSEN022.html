<h4 id="chapter-18-pre--to-postrevolutionary-france">Chapter 18 Pre- to
Postrevolutionary France</h4>
<p>The advancement and perfection of mathematics are intimately
connected with the prosperity of the State.</p>
<p>—Napoleon I</p>
<p>Men and Institutions</p>
<p>Mathematicians of France at the time of the revolution not only
contributed handsomely to the fund of knowledge but they were in large
measure responsible for the chief lines of development in the explosive
proliferation of mathematics during the succeeding century. Of six men
whom we may name as mathematical leaders during the revolution, all had
produced abundantly before 1789; not one of the six expressed regret
later when the old order passed away. They were Gaspard Monge,
Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre Simon Laplace, Adrien Marie Legendre,
Lazare Carnot, and Nicolas Condorcet; they were to be in the midst of
the turmoil, and one of them fell victim to it.</p>
<p>Two mathematicians, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert and Condorcet, were among
the heralds of the French Revolution. Only Condorcet lived to see the
fall of the Bastille, and he succumbed as a result.</p>
<p>The chief scientific institution in France supporting mathematical
research through publications, meetings, and prizes during most of the
eighteenth century was the Royal Academy of Sciences. In 1793, the
Revolutionary Convention shut down operation of the Academy of Sciences,
along with that of four other major academies. Two years later, the
Directory established the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts,
composed of three classes: physical and mathematical sciences, moral and
political sciences, literature and fine arts. Various reorganizations
and name changes followed, initially at the behest of Napoleon, who had
joined the Institut in 1797. Only in 1816 could the classes resume under
the name “Academy,” which had been considered reactionary. During the
early years of this strife-torn period, mathematical activities of the
Academy were greatly diminished; the one project that survived the
political gyrations was the reform of weights and measures.</p>
<p>The year 1793 marked the shutting down not only of the academies but
also of the activities of most of the colleges making up the University
of Paris. Universities had not been the mathematical foci that they are
today. Most French mathematicians of the eighteenth century who were
active before the revolution were associated not with the universities,
but with either the church or the military; others found royal patronage
or became private teachers.</p>
<p>Within a few years of the fall of the Bastille in 1789, the system of
higher education in France was to undergo a drastic revision as a result
of the upheaval produced by the French Revolution. During this short but
significant period, France once more became the mathematical center of
the world, as it had been during the middle of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>The Committee on Weights and Measures</p>
<p>The reform of the system of weights and measures is an especially
appropriate example of the way in which mathematicians patiently
persisted in their efforts despite confusion and political difficulties.
As early in the revolution as 1790, Talleyrand proposed the reform of
weights and measures. The problem was referred to the Académie des
Sciences, in which a committee that had Lagrange and Condorcet as two of
its members was established to draw up a proposal.</p>
<p>The committee considered two alternatives for the basic length in the
new system. One was the length of the pendulum that should beat seconds.
The equation for the pendulum being this would make the standard length
But the committee was so impressed by the accuracy with which Legendre
and others had measured the length of a terrestrial meridian that in the
end, the meter was defined to be the ten-millionth part of the distance
between the equator and the pole. The resulting metric system was ready
in most respects in 1791, but there was confusion and delay in
establishing it.</p>
<p>The closing of the Académie in 1793 was a blow to mathematics, but
the convention continued the Committee on Weights and Measures, although
it purged the committee of some members, such as A. L. Lavoisier, and
enlarged it by adding others, including Monge. At one point, Lagrange
was very nearly lost to the committee, for the Convention had banned
foreigners from France, but Lagrange was specifically exempted from the
decree and remained to serve as head of the committee. Still later, the
committee was made responsible to the Institut national; Lagrange,
Laplace, Legendre, and Monge all served on the committee at this stage.
By 1799, the work of the committee had been completed, and the metric
system, as we have it today, became a reality. The metric system is, of
course, one of the more tangible mathematical results of the revolution,
but in terms of the development of our subject, it cannot be compared in
significance with other contributions.</p>
<p>D’Alembert</p>
<p>Like Euler and the Bernoullis, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert (1717–1783),
too, was broadly educated—in law, medicine, science, and mathematics—a
background that served him well when, from 1751 to 1772, he collaborated
with Denis Diderot (1713–1784) in the twenty-eight volumes of the
celebrated Encyclopédie or Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts,
et des métiers. For the Encyclopédie, d’Alembert wrote the much-admired
“Discours preliminaire,” as well as most of the mathematical and
scientific articles. The Encyclopédie, despite d’Alembert’s Jansenist
education, showed strong tendencies toward the secularization of
learning so characteristic of the Enlightenment, and it met with strong
attack from Jesuits. Through his defense of the project, d’Alembert
became known as “the fox of the Encyclopedia” and incidentally played a
significant role in the expulsion of the Jesuit order from France. As a
result of his activities and his friendships with Voltaire and others
among the Philosophes, he was one of those who paved the way for the
French Revolution. At the early age of twenty-four, he had been elected
to the Académie des Sciences, and in 1754, he became its secrétaire
perpetuel, and as such, perhaps the most influential scientist in
France.</p>
<p>While Euler was busy with mathematical research in Berlin, d’Alembert
was active in Paris. Until 1757, when controversy over the problem of
vibrating strings brought estrangement, correspondence between the two
was frequent and cordial, for their interests were much the same.
Statements such as log(−1)2 = log(+ 1)2, equivalent to 2 log(−1) = 2
log(+ 1) or to log(−l) = log(+ l), had puzzled the best mathematicians
of the earlier part of the eighteenth century, but, as noted in the
previous chapter, by 1747, Euler was able to write to d’Alembert
correctly explaining the status of logarithms of negative numbers.</p>
<p>D’Alembert had spent much of his time and effort attempting to prove
the theorem conjectured by Girard and known today as the fundamental
theorem of algebra—that every polynomial equation f(x) = 0, having
complex coefficients and of degree n ≥ 1, has at least one complex root.
So earnest were his efforts to prove the theorem (especially in a prize
essay on “The General Cause of Winds,” published in the Memoirs of the
Berlin Academy for 1746) that in France today, the theorem is widely
known as the theorem of d’Alembert. If we think of the solution of such
a polynomial equation as a generalization of the explicit algebraic
operations, we can say that in essence, d’Alembert wished to show that
the result of any algebraic operation performed on a complex number is
in turn a complex number. In a paper of 1752 on the resistance of
fluids, he arrived at the so-called Cauchy-Riemann equations that loom
so large in complex analysis.</p>
<p>Limits</p>
<p>D’Alembert was an unusual combination of caution and boldness in his
view of mathematical developments. He regarded Euler’s use of divergent
series as open to suspicion (1768), despite the successes achieved.
Moreover, d’Alembert objected to the Eulerian assumption that
differentials are symbols for quantities that are zero and yet
qualitatively different. Inasmuch as Euler restricted himself to
well-behaved functions, he had not become involved in the subtle
difficulties that later were to make his naive position untenable.
Meanwhile, d’Alembert believed that the “true metaphysics” of the
calculus was to be found in the idea of a limit. In the article on the
“differential” that he wrote for the Encyclopédie, d’Alembert stated
that “the differentiation of equations consists simply in finding the
limits of the ratio of finite differences of two variables included in
the equation.” Opposing the views of Leibniz and Euler, d’Alembert
insisted that “a quantity is something or nothing; if it is something,
it has not yet vanished; if it is nothing, it has literally vanished.
The supposition that there is an intermediate state between these two is
a chimera.” This view would rule out the vague notion of differentials
as infinitely small magnitudes, and d’Alembert held that the
differential notation is merely a convenient manner of speaking that
depends for its justification on the language of limits. His
Encyclopédie article on the differential referred to Newton’s De
Quadratura Curvarum, but d’Alembert interpreted Newton’s phrase “prime
and ultimate ratio” as a limit, rather than as a first or last ratio of
two quantities just springing into being. In the article on “Limit” that
he composed for the Encyclopédie, he called one quantity the limit of a
second (variable) quantity if the second can approach the first nearer
than by any given quantity (without actually coinciding with it). The
imprecision in this definition was removed in the works of
nineteenth-century mathematicians.</p>
<p>Euler had thought of an infinitely large quantity as the reciprocal
of an infinitely small magnitude, but d’Alembert, having outlawed the
infinitesimal, defined the indefinitely large in terms of limits. A
line, for example, is said to be infinite with respect to another if
their ratio is greater than any given number. He went on to define
indefinitely large quantities of higher order in a manner similar to
that used by mathematicians today in speaking of orders of infinity with
respect to functions. D’Alembert denied the existence of the actually
infinite, for he was thinking of geometric magnitudes, rather than of
the theory of aggregates proposed a century later.</p>
<p>Differential Equations</p>
<p>D’Alembert, a man of wide interests, is perhaps best known today for
what is referred to as d’Alembert’s principle: the internal actions and
reactions of a system of rigid bodies in motion are in equilibrium. This
appeared in 1743 in his celebrated treatise Traité de dynamique. Other
treatises by d’Alembert concerned music, the three-body problem, the
precession of the equinoxes, motion in resisting media, and lunar
perturbations. In studying the problem of vibrating strings, he was led
to the partial differential equation , for which in 1747 he gave (in the
Memoirs of the Berlin Academy) the solution u = f(x + t) + g(x − t),
where f and g are arbitrary functions. D’Alembert also found the
singular solution of the differential equation y = xf(y′) + g(y′);
hence, this is known as d’Alembert’s equation.</p>
<p>Bézout</p>
<p>The year 1783, when d’Alembert and Euler died, was also the year of
Étienne Bézout’s (1730–1783) death. The son and grandson of magistrates
in Nemours, inspired by exposure to works of Euler, he chose a
mathematical career and published his first papers in the 1750s. One was
a memoir on dynamics, which was followed by two papers on integration.
He was appointed to the Académie des Sciences, first as an adjoint in
mechanics, then an associé and, in 1770, a pensionnaire. In 1763, as
royal censor, he was appointed examiner of the Gardes de la Marine. In
this position, he was expected to provide textbooks, an assignment that
resulted in a series of widely adopted works. The first was a
four-volume Cours de mathématiques à l’usage des Gardes du Pavillon et
de la Marine, which appeared between 1764 and 1767. In 1768, the
examiner for the artillery died, and Bézout was appointed to succeed
him, becoming examiner of the Corps d’Artillerie. This resulted in his
producing an even more expansive and successful textbook, the Cours
complet de mathématiques à l’usage de la marine et de l’artillerie, a
six-volume work that appeared between 1770 and 1782. For decades, it was
this Cours that students studied when preparing to enter advanced
scientific schools. He took into account that he was writing for
beginners and attempted to build on subjects familiar to them, such as
elementary geometry, conveying a sense of the range of usefulness of the
subject, rather than stressing fine points of rigor. Judging from
repeated editions, his was the most successful of the
late-eighteenth-century Cours that covered the subject matter of
mathematics from the lowest to the highest level. His textbooks were
translated into English and in the early decades of the nineteenth
century were still used at West Point, as well as at Harvard and other
institutions; in 1826, the first American textbook in analytic geometry
was derived from Bézout’s Cours. The fourth part of Bézout’s Cours—the
principles of mechanics—is the raison d’être of the program. The
mathematical preeminence of France (and, indeed, of Continental Europe
as a whole) in the eighteenth century was based in large measure on the
application of analysis to mechanics as taught in technical schools, and
it was under this influence that the mathematicians of the French
Revolution had been brought up. The emphasis given to mechanics and to
the closing section on navigation is in keeping with the use of the
Cours de mathématiques as a text in a military academy such as the one
at Mezières, which both Monge and Carnot attended. It was through such
compilations, rather than through the original works of the authors
themselves, that the mathematical advances of Euler and d’Alembert
became widely known.</p>
<p>Bézout’s name is familiar today in connection with the use of
determinants in algebraic elimination. In a memoir of the Paris Academy
for 1764 and more extensively in a treatise of 1779 titled Théorie
générale des équations algébriques, Bézout gave rules, similar to
Cramer’s, for solving n simultaneous linear equations in n unknowns. He
is best known for an extension of these to a system of equations in one
or more unknowns, in which it is required to find the condition on the
coefficients necessary for the equations to have a common solution. To
take a very simple case, one might ask for the condition that the
equations a1x + b1y + c1 = 0, a2x + b2y + c2 = 0, a3x + b3y + c3 = 0
have a common solution. The necessary condition is that the
eliminant</p>
<p>here a special case of the “Bézoutiant,” should be 0. Somewhat more
complicated eliminants arise when conditions are sought for two
polynomial equations of unequal degree to have a common solution. Bézout
was also the first one to give a satisfactory proof of the theorem,
known to Maclaurin and Cramer, that two algebraic curves of degrees m
and n, respectively, intersect in general in m · n points; hence, this
is often called Bézout’s theorem. Euler had contributed to the theory of
elimination as well, but less extensively than did Bézout.</p>
<p>Condorcet</p>
<p>Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet (1743–1794), a
physiocrat, a Philosophe, and an encyclopedist, belonged to the circle
of Voltaire and d’Alembert. The family of Condorcet included influential
members in the cavalry and the church; hence, his education presented no
problem. At Jesuit schools and later at the Collège de Navarre, he made
an enviable reputation in mathematics, but instead of becoming a captain
of cavalry, as his family had hoped, he lived the life of a scholar in
much the same sense as Voltaire, Diderot, and d’Alembert.</p>
<p>He was a capable mathematician who had published books on probability
and the integral calculus, but he was also a restless visionary and an
idealist who was interested in anything related to the welfare of
mankind. He, like Voltaire, had a passionate hatred of injustice;
although he held the title of marquis, he saw so many inequalities in
the ancien régime that he wrote and worked toward reform. With implicit
faith in the perfectibility of mankind and believing that education
would eliminate vice, he argued for free public education, an admirably
forward-looking view, especially for those days. Condorcet is perhaps
best remembered mathematically as a pioneer in social mathematics,
especially through the application of probability and statistics to
social problems. When, for example, conservative elements (including the
Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology) attacked those who
advocated inoculation against smallpox, Condorcet (together with
Voltaire and Daniel Bernoulli) came to the defense of variolation.</p>
<p>With the opening of the revolution, Condorcet’s thoughts turned from
mathematics to administrative and political problems. The educational
system had collapsed under the effervescence of the revolution, and
Condorcet saw that this was the time to try to introduce the reforms he
had in mind. He presented his plan to the Legislative Assembly, of which
he became president, but agitation over other matters precluded serious
consideration of it. Condorcet published his scheme in 1792, but the
provision for free education became a target of attack. Not until years
after his death did France achieve Condorcet’s ideal of free public
instruction.</p>
<p>Condorcet, who had been sympathetic to the moderate Gironde wing of
the revolution, had had high hopes for the revolution—until extremists
seized control. He then boldly denounced the Septembrists and was
ordered arrested for his pains. He sought hiding, and during the long
months of concealment, he composed the celebrated Sketch for a
Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, indicating nine
steps in the rise of mankind from a tribal stage to the founding of the
French Republic, with a prediction of the bright tenth stage that he
believed the revolution was about to usher in. Shortly after completing
this work (in 1794) and believing that his presence endangered the lives
of his hosts, he left his hiding place. Promptly recognized as an
aristocrat, he was arrested. The following morning, he was found dead on
the floor of his prison.</p>
<p>Condorcet, who is interesting because of the breadth of his
interests, had published De calcul integral as early as 1765 and Essai
sur l’application de l’analyse à la probabilité des décisions rendues à
la pluralité des voix in 1785. Condorcet was the only one of our six
leading mathematicians at the time of the revolution who can be said to
have played an anticipatory role in the events leading to 1789, and he
was the only one to lose his life through it.</p>
<p>Lagrange</p>
<p>Educated in Turin, as a young man Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813)
became a professor of mathematics in the military academy of Turin, but
later he found successive royal patrons in Frederick the Great of
Prussia and Louis XVI of France.</p>
<p>If Carnot and Legendre were disciples of clear and rigorous thought,
Lagrange was the high priest of the cult. He had published his Mécanique
analytique (1788), as well as frequent papers on algebra, analysis, and
geometry, before the revolution. At the height of the Terror, Lagrange
had thought seriously of leaving France, but just at this critical
juncture, the École Normale and the École Polytechnique were
established, and Lagrange was invited to lecture on analysis. Lagrange
seems to have welcomed the opportunity to teach. The new curriculum
called for new lecture notes, and these Lagrange supplied for various
levels. For students at the École Normale in 1795, he prepared and
delivered lectures that today would be appropriate for a high school
class in advanced algebra or for a course in college algebra; the
material in these notes enjoyed a popularity that extended to America,
where they were published as Lectures on Elementary Mathematics. For
scholars on the higher level of the École Polytechnique, Lagrange
lectured on analysis and prepared what has ever since been regarded as a
classic in mathematics. The results, in his Théorie des fonctions
analytiques, appeared in the same year as Carnot’s Réflexions, and
together they make 1797 a banner year for the rise of rigor.</p>
<p>Theory of Functions</p>
<p>Lagrange’s function theory, which developed some ideas that he had
presented in a paper about twenty-five years earlier, certainly was not
useful in the narrower sense, for the notation of the differential was
far more expeditious and suggestive than the Lagrangian “derived
function,” from which our name “derivative” comes. The whole motive of
the work was not to try to make the calculus more utilitarian but to
make it more logically satisfying. The key idea is easy to describe. The
function f(x) = 1/(1 − x), when expanded by long division, yields the
infinite series 1 + 1x + 1x2 + 1x3 + . . . + 1xn + . . .. If the
coefficient of xn is multiplied by n!, Lagrange called the result the
value of the nth derived function of f(x) for the point x = 0, with
suitable modification for expansions of functions about other points. To
this work by Lagrange, we owe the commonly used notation for derivatives
of various orders, f′(x), f″(x), . . ., f (n)(x). . .. Lagrange thought
that through the use of this device, he had eliminated the need for
limits or infinitesimals, although he continued to use the latter side
by side with his derived functions. But, alas, there are flaws in his
fine new scheme. Not every function can be so expanded, for there were
lapses in Lagrange’s putative proof of the expandability; moreover, the
question of the convergence of the infinite series brings back the need
for the limit concept. Yet the work of Lagrange during the revolution
can be said to have had a broader influence through the initiation of a
new subject that has ever since been a center of attention in
mathematics—the theory of functions of a real variable.</p>
<p>Calculus of Variations</p>
<p>Lagrange’s first and perhaps his greatest contribution is the
calculus of variations. This was a new branch of mathematics, the name
of which originated from notations used by Lagrange from about 1760 on.
In its simplest form, the subject seeks to determine a functional
relationship y = f(x) such that an integral shall be a maximum or a
minimum. Problems of isoperimetry or of quickest descent are special
cases in the calculus of variations. In 1755, Lagrange had written to
Euler about the general methods that he had developed for handling
problems of this type, and Euler generously held up publication of
somewhat related work of his own, in order that the younger man should
receive full credit for the newer methods that Euler regarded as
superior.</p>
<p>From the time of his first publications in the Miscellanea of the
Turin Academy in 1759–1761, the reputation of Lagrange was established.
When, in 1766, Euler and d’Alembert advised Frederick the Great on
Euler’s successor at the Berlin Academy, they both urged the appointment
of Lagrange. Frederick then presumptuously wrote to Lagrange that it was
necessary that the greatest geometer of Europe should live near the
greatest of kings. Lagrange assented; he remained in Berlin for twenty
years, leaving only after Frederick’s death, three years before the
start of the French Revolution.</p>
<p>Algebra</p>
<p>It was during his days at the Berlin Academy that Lagrange published
important memoirs on mechanics, the three-body problem, his early ideas
on derived functions, and influential work on the theory of equations.
In 1767, he published a memoir on the approximation of roots of
polynomial equations by means of continued fractions; in another paper
in 1770, he considered the solvability of equations in terms of
permutations on their roots. The latter work would lead to the
enormously successful theory of groups and to the proofs by Évariste
Galois and Niels Henrik Abel of the insolvability, in the usual terms,
of equations of a degree greater than four. Today the name of Lagrange
is attached to what is perhaps the most important theorem of group
theory: if o is the order of a subgroup g of a group G of order O, then
o is a factor of O. Finding that a resolvent of a quintic equation, far
from being of a degree less than five, as one should have expected, was
a sextic, Lagrange conjectured that polynomial equations above the
fourth degree are not solvable in the usual sense.</p>
<p>Lagrange Multipliers</p>
<p>Ever on the lookout for generality and elegance in the treatment of
problems, Lagrange was responsible for the method of variation of
parameters in the solution of nonhomogeneous linear differential
equations. That is, if c1u1 + c2u2 is a general solution of y″ + a1y′ +
a2y = 0 (where u1 and u2 are functions of x), he replaced the parameters
c1 and c2 with undetermined variables v1 and v2 (functions of x) and
determined the latter so that v1u1 + v2u2, should be a solution of y″ +
a1y′ + a2y = f(x). In the determination of maxima and minima of a
function such as f(x, y, z, w) subject to constraints g(x, y, z, w) = 0
and h(x, y, z, w) = 0, he suggested the use of Lagrange multipliers to
provide an elegant and symmetric algorithm. Under this method, one
introduces two undetermined constants λ and μ; forms the function F = f
+ λg + μh from the six equations Fx = 0, Fy = 0, FZ = 0, Fw = 0, g = 0,
and h = 0; eliminates the multipliers λ and μ; and solves for the
desired values of x, y, z, and w.</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>Like many leading modern mathematicians, Lagrange had a deep interest
in the theory of numbers. Although he did not use the language of
congruences, Lagrange showed, in 1768, the equivalent of the statement
that for a prime modulus p the congruence f(x) ≡ 0 can have not more
than n distinct solutions, where n is the degree (except for the trivial
case in which all coefficients of f(x) are divisible by p). Two years
later, he published a demonstration of the theorem, for which Fermat
claimed to have had a proof, that every positive integer is the sum of
at most four perfect squares; hence, this theorem is often known as
Lagrange’s four-square theorem. At the same time, he also gave the first
proof of a result known as Wilson’s theorem, which had appeared in
Waring’s Meditationes Algebraicae of the same year—for any prime p, the
integer (p − 1)! + 1 is divisible by p.</p>
<p>Lagrange also contributed to the theory of probability, but in this
branch, he took second place to Laplace, who was younger.</p>
<p>Monge</p>
<p>Gaspard Monge (1746–1818) was the son of a poor tradesman. Through
the influence of a lieutenant colonel who had been struck by the boy’s
ability, however, Monge was permitted to attend some courses at the
École Militaire de Mezières; he so impressed those in authority that he
soon became a member of the teaching staff—the only one of our group of
six who was primarily a teacher, perhaps one of the most influential
mathematics teachers since the days of Euclid.</p>
<p>Monge contributed numerous mathematical articles to the Mémoires of
the Académie des Sciences. Inasmuch as he succeeded Bézout as examiner
for the School of the Navy, Monge was more urged by those in authority
to do what Bézout had done—write a Cours de mathématiques for the use of
candidates. Monge, however, was more interested in teaching and
research, and he completed only one volume of the project: Traité
elementaire de statique (Paris, 1788). He was attracted not only to both
pure and applied mathematics but also to physics and chemistry. In
particular, he participated with Lavoisier in experiments, including
those on the composition of water, which led to the chemical revolution
of 1789. At the time of the revolution, Monge had become one of the best
known of French scientists, but his geometry had not been properly
appreciated. His chief work, the Géométrie descriptive, had not been
published because his superiors felt that it was in the interests of
national defense to keep it confidential.</p>
<p>Monge made efforts after the crisis of foreign invasion had subsided
to establish a school for the preparation of engineers. As Condorcet had
been the guiding spirit in the Committee on Instruction, so Monge was
the leading advocate of institutions of higher learning. He was an
active member of the Commission of Public Works, charged with the
establishment of an appropriate institution in 1794. The school was the
famous École Polytechnique, which took form so rapidly that students
were admitted in the following year. At all stages of its creation,
Monge’s role was essential, both as administrator and as teacher. It is
gratifying to note that the two functions are not incompatible, for
Monge was eminently successful in both. He was even able to overcome his
reluctance about writing textbooks, for in the reform of the mathematics
curriculum, the need for suitable books was acute.</p>
<p>Descriptive and Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge found himself lecturing on two subjects that were both
essentially new to a university curriculum. The first of these was known
as stereotomy, now more commonly called descriptive geometry. Monge gave
a concentrated course in the subject to 400 students, and a manuscript
outline of the syllabus survives. This shows that the course was of
wider scope, both on the pure and the applied side, than is now usual.
Besides the study of shadow, perspective, and topography, attention was
paid to the properties of surfaces, including normal lines and tangent
planes, and to the theory of machines. Among the problems set by Monge,
for example, was that of determining the curve of intersection of two
surfaces, each of which is generated by a line that moves so as to
intersect three skew lines in space. Another was the determination of a
point in space equidistant from four lines.</p>
<p>Such problems point up a change in mathematical education that was
sponsored primarily by the French Revolution. As long ago as the Golden
Age of Greece, Plato had pointed out that the state of solid geometry
was deplorable, and the medieval decline in mathematics had hit solid
geometry harder than it had plane geometry. One who could not cross the
pons asinorum could scarcely be expected to reach the study of three
dimensions. Descartes and Fermat had been well aware of the fundamental
principle of solid analytic geometry that every equation in three
unknowns represents a surface, and conversely, but they had not taken
steps to develop it. Whereas the seventeenth century was the century of
curves—the cycloid; the limaçon; the catenary; the lemniscate; the
equiangular spiral; the hyperbolas, parabolas, and spirals of Fermat;
the pearls of Sluse; and many others—the eighteenth was the century that
really began the study of surfaces. It was Euler who called attention to
the quadric surfaces as a family analogous to the conics, and his
Introductio, in a sense, established the subject of solid analytic
geometry (although Clairaut was a precursor). Lagrange, perhaps
influenced by his calculus of variations, manifested interest in
problems in three dimensions and emphasized their analytic solution. He
was the first, for example, to give the formula</p>
<p>for the distance D from a point (p, q, r) to the plane ax + by + cz =
d. But Lagrange did not have a geometer’s heart, nor did he have
enthusiastic disciples. Monge, by contrast, was a specialist in geometry
as well as a superior teacher and a curriculum builder. Consequently,
the rise of solid geometry was due in part to the mathematical and
revolutionary activities of Gaspard Monge. Had he not been politically
active, the École Polytechnique might never have come into being; had he
not been an inspiring teacher, the revival of geometry in three
dimensions might not have taken place.</p>
<p>The École Polytechnique was not the only school created at the time.
The École Normale had been hastily opened to some 1,400 or 1,500
students, less carefully selected than those at the École Polytechnique,
and it boasted a mathematical faculty of high caliber, Monge, Lagrange,
Legendre, and Laplace being among the instructors. Due to administrative
difficulties, however the school was short-lived. It was the lectures of
Monge at the École Normale in 1794–1795 that were finally published as
his Géométrie descriptive.</p>
<p>The idea behind the new descriptive geometry, or method of double
orthographic projection, is essentially very easy to understand. One
simply takes two planes at right angles to each other, one vertical, the
other horizontal, and then projects the figure to be represented
orthogonally on these planes, the projections of all edges and vertices
being clearly indicated. The projection on the vertical plane is known
as the “elevation,” the other projection is called the “plan.” Finally,
the vertical plane is folded or rotated about the line of intersection
of the two planes until it also is horizontal. The elevation and the
plan thus provide one with a diagram in two dimensions of the
three-dimensional object. This simple procedure, now so common in
mechanical drawing, almost produced a revolution in military engineering
design in the days of Monge.</p>
<p>Descriptive geometry was not Monge’s only contribution to
three-dimensional mathematics, for at the École Polytechnique he also
taught a course in “application of analysis to geometry.” Just as the
abbreviated title “analytic geometry” had not yet come into general use,
there was also no “differential geometry,” but the course given by Monge
was essentially an introduction to this field. Here, too, no textbook
was available, so Monge found himself compelled to compose and print his
Feuilles d’analyse (1795) for the use of students. Here the analytic
geometry of three dimensions really came into its own; it was this
course, required of all students at the École Polytechnique, that formed
the prototype of the present program in solid analytic geometry.
Students, however, evidently found the course difficult, for the
lectures skimmed very rapidly over the elementary forms of the line and
the plane, the bulk of the material being on the applications of the
calculus to the study of curves and surfaces in three dimensions. Monge
was ever reluctant to write textbooks on the elementary level or to
organize material that was not primarily his own. Yet he found
collaborators who were ready to edit material that he included in his
course, and so, in 1802, there appeared in the Journal de l’École
Polytechnique an extensive memoir by Monge and Jean-Nicolas-Pierre
Hachette (1769–1834) on “Application d’algèbre à la géométrie.” Its
first theorem is typical of a more elementary approach to the subject.
It is the well-known eighteenth-century generalization of the
Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the projections of a
plane figure on three mutually perpendicular planes is equal to the
square of the area of the figure. Monge and Hachette proved the theorem
just as in modern courses; in fact, the whole volume could serve without
difficulty as a text in the twenty-first century. Equations for
transformations of axes, the usual treatment of lines and planes, and
the determination of the principal planes of a quadric are treated
fully. It is in the analytic geometry of Monge that we first find a
systematic study of the straight line in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Most of Monge’s results on the analytic geometry of the line and the
plane were given in memoirs dating from 1771. In his systematic
arrangement of the material in the Feuilles d’analyse of 1795 and
especially in the 1802 memoir with Hachette, we find most of the solid
analytic geometry and the elementary differential geometry that are
included in undergraduate college textbooks. One thing that might be
missed is the explicit use of determinants, for this was the work of the
nineteenth century. Nevertheless, we might, as in the case of Lagrange,
look on Monge’s use of symmetric notations as an anticipation of
determinants but without the now customary arrangement (due to Arthur
Cayley).</p>
<p>Among the new results given by Monge are two theorems that bear his
name: (1) The planes drawn through the midpoints of the edges of a
tetrahedron perpendicular to the opposite edges meet at a point M (which
has since been called the “Monge point” of the tetrahedron); M turns out
to be the midpoint of the segment joining the centroid and the
circumcenter. (2) The locus of the vertices of the trirectangular angle
whose faces are tangent to a given quadric surface is a sphere, known as
the “Monge sphere,” or director sphere, of the quadric. The equivalent
of this locus in two dimensions leads to what is called the “Monge
circle” of a conic, even though the locus had been given a century
earlier in synthetic form by Lahire. In 1809, Monge proved in various
ways that the centroid of a tetrahedron is the point of concurrency of
the lines joining the midpoints of opposite edges; he also gave the
analogue of the Euler line in three-space, showing that for the
orthocentric tetrahedron, the centroid is twice as far from the
orthocenter as from the circumcenter. Lagrange was so impressed by the
work of Monge that he is said to have exclaimed, “With his application
of analysis to geometry, this devil of a man will make himself
immortal.”</p>
<p>Textbooks</p>
<p>Monge was a capable administrator, an imaginative research
mathematician, and an inspiring teacher. The pupils of Monge let loose a
spate of elementary textbooks on analytic geometry such as has never
been equaled—not even in our own day. If we judge from the sudden
appearance of so many analytic geometries beginning in 1798, a
revolution had taken place in mathematical instruction. Analytic
geometry, which for a century and more had been overshadowed by the
calculus, suddenly achieved a recognized place in the schools. This
“analytical revolution” can be credited primarily to Monge. Between the
years 1798 and 1802, four elementary analytic geometries appeared from
the pens of Sylvestre François Lacroix (1765–1843), Jean-Baptiste Biot
(1774–1862), Louis Puissant (1769–1843), and F. L. Lefrançois, all
directly inspired by the lectures at the École Polytechnique.
Polytechnicians were responsible for as many books again in the next
decade. Most of these were eminently successful texts, appearing in
numerous editions. The volume by Biot achieved a fifth edition in less
than a dozen years; that by Lacroix, a student and colleague of Monge’s,
appeared in twenty-five editions within ninety-nine years! Perhaps we
should speak instead of the “textbook revolution,” for Lacroix’s other
textbooks were almost as spectacularly successful, his Arithmetic and
his Geometry appearing in 1848 in the twentieth and sixteenth editions,
respectively. The twentieth edition of his Algebra was published in
1859, and the ninth edition of his Calculus in 1881.</p>
<p>Lacroix on Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge is known to most readers as a founder of modern synthetic
geometry. But there is an aspect of Monge’s work that is less well
known. Virtually without exception, the textbook writers in analytic
geometry ascribe the inspiration for their work to Monge, although
Lagrange is occasionally mentioned as well. Lacroix most clearly
expressed the point of view as follows:</p>
<p>In carefully avoiding all geometric constructions, I would have the
reader realize that there exists a way of looking at geometry which one
might call analytic geometry, and which consists in deducing the
properties of extension from the smallest possible number of principles
by purely analytic methods, as Lagrange has done in his mechanics with
regard to the properties of equilibrium and movement.</p>
<p>Lacroix held that algebra and geometry “should be treated separately,
as far apart as they can be; and that the results in each should serve
for mutual clarification, corresponding, so to speak, to the text of a
book and its translation.” Lacroix believed that Monge “was the first
one to think of presenting in this form the application of algebra to
geometry.” Lacroix admitted that his own section on solid analytic
geometry was almost entirely the work of Monge.</p>
<p>The phrase “analytic geometry” seems to have first been used as the
title of a textbook by Lefrançois in the second edition of his Essais de
géométrie analytiques of 1804 and by Biot in an 1805 edition of his
Essais de géométrie analytique, the latter of which, translated into
English as well as other languages, was used for many years at West
Point.</p>
<p>Carnot</p>
<p>Monge was an outstanding figure of the revolution, yet the
mathematician whose name was on the tongue of every Frenchman during the
revolution was not Monge but Carnot. Lazare Carnot (1753–1823), was
sufficiently above bourgeois standing to be permitted to attend the
École Militaire at Mezières, where Monge was one of his teachers. On
graduation, Carnot entered the army, although, lacking a title, he could
not, under the ancien régime, aspire to a rank above that of captain.
The proverb arose at examination time that “the competent were not noble
and the noble were not competent.”</p>
<p>It was Lazare Carnot who, when the success of the revolution was
threatened by confusion within and invasion from without, organized the
armies and led them to victory. As ardent a republican as Monge, Carnot
nevertheless shunned all political cliques. Having a high sense of
intellectual honesty, he tried to be impartial in reaching decisions.
After investigation, he absolved the royalists of the infamous charge
that they had mixed powdered glass in flour intended for the
revolutionary armies, but he felt bound by conscience to vote for the
death of the king. Reasoned impartiality, however, is difficult to
maintain in times of crisis, and Robespierre, whom Carnot had
antagonized, threatened that Carnot would lose his head at the first
military disaster. But Carnot had won the admiration of his countrymen
for his remarkable military successes, and when a voice in the
Convention proposed his arrest, the deputies spontaneously rose to his
defense, acclaiming him the “Organizer of Victory.” It was instead the
head of Robespierre that fell, and Carnot survived to take an active
part in the formation of the École Polytechnique. Carnot was greatly
interested in education at all levels, even though he seems never to
have taught a class. His son Hippolyte served as minister of public
instruction in 1848. (Another son, Sadi, became a celebrated physicist,
and a grandson, also named Sadi, became the fourth president of the
Third French Republic.)</p>
<p>Carnot led a charmed political life until 1797. He had gone from the
National Assembly to the Legislative Assembly, to the National
Convention, to the powerful Committee of Public Safety, to the Council
of Five Hundred and the Directorate. In 1797, however, he refused to
join a partisan coup d’état and was promptly ordered deported. His name
was stricken from the roles of the Institut, and his chair of geometry
was voted unanimously to General Bonaparte. Even Monge, a fellow
republican and mathematician, approved the intellectual outrage. Monge
seems to have been mesmerized by Napoleon. Monge followed his idol
through thick and thin, his devotion being such that he literally became
sick every time Napoleon lost a battle. This is in contrast to Carnot,
who was responsible for Bonaparte’s rise to power through his
appointment to the Italian campaign, but who did not hesitate to oppose
him.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Carnot’s proscription turned out to be a good thing,
for it gave him an opportunity, while in exile, to complete a work that
had been on his mind for some time. By 1786, he had published a second
edition of his Essai sur les machines en general, as well as some verses
and a work on fortifications. But the work that Carnot had been planning
during his politically busy days was, mirabile dictu, the Réflexions sur
la métaphysique du calcul infinitésimal, which appeared in 1797. This
was not a work on applied mathematics; it came closer to philosophy than
to physics, and in this respect, it adumbrated the period of rigor and
concern for foundations that was so typical of the next century.</p>
<p>Metaphysics of the Calculus and Geometry</p>
<p>During the second half of the eighteenth century, there was
enthusiasm for the results of the calculus but confusion about its basic
principles. Not one of the usual approaches, whether by the fluxions of
Newton, the differentials of Leibniz, or the limits of d’Alembert,
seemed to be satisfying. Hence, Carnot, considering the conflicting
interpretations, sought to show “in what the veritable spirit” of the
new analysis consisted. In his selection of the unifying principle,
however, he made a most deplorable choice. He concluded that “the true
metaphysical principles” are “the principles of the compensation of
errors.” Infinitesimals, he argued, are “quantités inappréciables,”
which, like imaginary numbers, are introduced only to facilitate the
computation and are eliminated in reaching the final result. “Imperfect
equations” are made “perfectly exact,” in the calculus, by eliminating
the quantities, such as infinitesimals of higher order, the presence of
which occasioned the errors. To the objection that vanishing quantities
either are or are not zero, Carnot responded that “what are called
infinitely small quantities are not simply any null quantities at all,
but rather null quantities assigned by a law of continuity which
determines the relationship”—an argument that is strongly reminiscent of
Leibniz. The diverse approaches to the calculus, he claimed, were
nothing but simplifications of the ancient method of exhaustion,
reducing this in various ways to a convenient algorithm. Carnot’s
Réflexions enjoyed a wide popularity, appearing in many languages and
editions. Unsuccessful though its synthesis of views was, it undoubtedly
helped make mathematicians dissatisfied with the “abominable little
zeros” of the eighteenth century and helped lead toward the age of rigor
in the nineteenth. Carnot’s reputation today, however, depends primarily
on other works.</p>
<p>In 1801, he published De la correlation des figures de géometrie,
again a work characterized by its high degree of generality. In it,
Carnot sought to establish for pure geometry a universality comparable
to that enjoyed by analytic geometry. He showed that several of Euclid’s
theorems can be regarded as specific instances of a more inclusive
theorem for which a single demonstration suffices. We find in the
Elements, for instance, the theorem that if two chords AD and BC in a
circle intersect in a point K, the product of AK by KD is equal to the
product of BK by KC (Fig. 18.1). Later, we run across the theorem that
if KDA and KCB are secants to a circle, the product of AK by KD is equal
to the product of BK by KC. These two theorems Carnot would regard
merely as special cases, correlated through the use of negative
quantities, of a general property of lines and circles. If we note that
for the chords CK = CB − BK, whereas for the secants CK = BK − CB, the
relationship AK · KD = CK · KB can be carried over from the one case to
the other simply by a change of sign. And tangency is only another case
in which B and C, say, coincide, so that BC = 0. Although the graphical
representation of complex numbers had not yet come into general use,
Carnot did not hesitate to also suggest a correlation of figures through
imaginary numbers. He cited as an example the fact that the circle y2 =
a2 − x2 is related to the hyperbola y2 = x2 − a2 through the identity
.</p>
<p>FIG. 18.1</p>
<p>Géométrie de Position</p>
<p>Carnot greatly expanded his correlation of figures in his Géométrie
de position in 1803, a book that placed him beside Monge as a founder of
modern pure geometry. The development of mathematics has been
characterized by a striving for ever higher and higher degrees of
generality, and it is this quality that gives significance to the work
of Carnot. His penchant for generalization led him to beautiful
analogues of well-known theorems of plane geometry. The equivalent of
the familiar law of cosines in trigonometry, a2 = b2 + c2 − 2bc cos A,
had been known at least as far back as the days of Euclid; Carnot
extended this ancient theorem to an equivalent form, a2 = b2 + c2 + d2 −
2cd cos B − 2bd cos C − 2bc cos D, for a tetrahedron, where a, b, c, and
d are the areas of the four faces and B, C, and D are the angles between
the faces of areas c and d, b and d, and b and c, respectively. The
passion for generality that is found in his work has been the driving
force of modern mathematics.</p>
<p>The Géométrie de position is a classic in pure geometry, but it also
contains significant contributions to analysis. Although analytic
geometry had completely overshadowed synthetic geometry for more than a
century, its supremacy had been won in terms of two coordinate systems,
rectangular and polar. In the rectangular system, the coordinates of a
point P in a plane are the distances of P from two mutually
perpendicular lines or axes; in the polar system, one of the coordinates
of P is the distance of P from a fixed point O (the pole), and the other
is the angle that line OP makes with a fixed line (polar axis) through
O. Carnot saw that coordinate systems could be modified in many ways.
For example, the coordinates of P may be the distances of P from two
fixed points O and Q, or one coordinate may be the distance OP and the
other the area of the triangle OPQ. In such generalizations, Carnot
simply rediscovered and extended a suggestion that Newton had made but
that had been generally overlooked; however, Carnot’s thought
characteristically carried him further. In all of the cases so far
considered, the equation of a curve depends on the particular coordinate
frame of reference that is used, yet the properties of a curve are not
bound to any one choice of pole or axes. It should be possible, Carnot
reasoned, to find coordinates that do not “depend on any particular
hypothesis or on any basis of comparison taken in absolute space.” Thus,
he initiated the search for what are now known as intrinsic coordinates.
One of these he found in the familiar radius of curvature of a curve at
a point. For the other, he introduced a quantity to which he gave no
name but that has since come to be called aberrancy, or angle of
deviation. This is an extension of the ideas of tangency and curvature.
The tangent to a curve at a point P is the limiting position of a secant
line PQ as Q approaches P along the curve; the circle of curvature is
the limiting position of the circle through the points P, Q, and R as Q
and R approach P along the curve. If, now, one passes a parabola through
points P, Q, R, and S and finds the limiting position of this parabola
as the points Q, R, and S approach P along the curve, the aberrancy at P
is the angle between the axis of this parabola and the normal to the
curve. Aberrancy is related to the third derivative of a function, in
much the same sense that slope and curvature are related to the first
and second derivatives, respectively.</p>
<p>Transversals</p>
<p>Carnot’s name is known among mathematicians for a theorem that bears
his name, which appeared in 1806 in an Essai sur la théorie des
transversales. This, again, is an extension of an ancient result.
Menelaus of Alexandria had shown that if a straight line intersects the
sides AB, BC, and CA of a triangle (or these sides extended) in points
P, Q, and R, respectively, and if a′ = AP, b′ = BQ, c′ = CR and a″ = AR,
b″ = BP, c″ = CQ, then a′b′c′ = a″b″c″ (Fig. 18.2). Carnot showed that
if the straight line in the theorem of Menelaus is replaced by a curve
of order n that intersects AB in the (real or imaginary) points P1, P2,
P3, . . ., Pn, BC in the points Q1, Q2, Q3, . . ., Qn, and CA in the
points R1, R2, R3, . . ., Rn, then the theorem of Menelaus holds if one
takes a′ as the product of the n distances AP1, AP2, AP3, . . ., APn,
with similar definitions for b′ and c′ and analogous definitions for a″,
b″, and c″ (Fig. 18.3). The theory of transversals is only a small part
of a work that contains other interesting generalizations. From the
familiar formula of Heron of Alexandria for the area of a triangle in
terms of its three sides, Carnot went on to a corresponding result for
the volume of the tetrahedron in terms of its six edges; finally, he
derived a formula, consisting of 130 terms, for finding the tenth of the
ten segments joining five points at random in space if the other nine
are known.</p>
<p>FIG. 18.2</p>
<p>FIG. 18.3</p>
<p>Laplace</p>
<p>Pierre Simon Laplace (1749–1827) was also born without wealth; like
Monge, he found influential friends who saw that he obtained an
education, again in a military academy. Laplace took virtually no part
in revolutionary activities. He seems to have had a strong sense of
intellectual honesty in science, but in politics he was without
convictions. This does not mean that he was timid, for he seems to have
associated freely with those of his scientific colleagues who were
suspect during the period of crisis. It has been said that he, too,
would have been in danger of the guillotine except for his contributions
to science, but this statement seems to be questionable, because he
often appeared to be a brazen opportunist. His publications were
primarily on celestial mechanics, in which he stands preeminent in the
period since Newton.</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>The theory of probability owes more to Laplace than to any other
mathematician. From 1774 on, he wrote many memoirs on the subject, the
results of which he embodied in the classic Théorie analytique des
probabilités of 1812. He considered the theory from all aspects and at
all levels, and his Essai philosophique des probabilité of 1814 is an
introductory account for the general reader. Laplace wrote that “at the
bottom the theory of probabilities is only common sense expressed in
numbers,” but his Théorie analytique shows the hand of a master analyst
who knows his advanced calculus. It is replete with integrals involving
beta and gamma functions, and Laplace was among the earliest to show
that , the area under the probability curve is . Although the method by
which he achieved this result was somewhat artificial, it is not far
removed from the modern device of transforming</p>
<p>to polar coordinates as</p>
<p>which is easily evaluated and leads to</p>
<p>Among the many things to which Laplace called attention in his
Théorie analytique was the calculation of n through Buffon’s needle
problem, which had been all but forgotten for thirty-five years. This is
sometimes known as the Buffon-Laplace needle problem, inasmuch as
Laplace extended the original problem to a crisscross of two mutually
perpendicular sets of equidistant parallel lines. If the distances are a
and b, the probability that a needle of length l (less than a and b)
will fall on one of the lines is</p>
<p>Laplace also rescued from oblivion the work of the Reverend Thomas
Bayes (1761) on inverse probability. Furthermore, we find in Laplace’s
book the theory of least squares, invented by Legendre, together with a
formal proof that Legendre had failed to give. The Théorie analytique
also contains the Laplace transform, which is so useful in differential
equations. If the function f(x) is said to be the Laplace transform of
the function g(x).</p>
<p>Celestial Mechanics and Operators</p>
<p>The works of Laplace involve a considerable application of higher
mathematical analysis. Typical was his study of the conditions for the
equilibrium of a rotating fluid mass, a subject that he had considered
in connection with the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar
system. In 1796, the hypothesis had been presented in a popular form in
Exposition du système du monde, a book that bears the same relation to
the Mécanique céleste (1799–1825, 5 vols.) as does the Essai
philosophique des probabilités to the Théorie analytique. According to
the theory of Laplace, the solar system evolved from an incandescent gas
rotating about an axis. As it cooled, the gas contracted, causing ever
more rapid rotation, according to the conservation of angular momentum,
until successive rings broke off from the outer edge to condense and
form planets. The rotating sun constitutes the remaining central core of
the nebula. The idea behind this hypothesis was not entirely original
with Laplace, for it had been proposed in qualitative skeletal form by
Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant, but the quantitative fleshing out of
the theory forms part of the multivolume Mécanique céleste. It is also
in this classic that we find, in connection with the attraction of a
spheroid on a particle, the Laplacian use of the idea of potential and
the Laplace equation. In a highly technical paper of 1782 on “Théorie
des attractions des sphéroïdes et de la figure des planètes,” also
included in the Mécanique céleste, Laplace developed the very useful
concept of potential—a function whose directional derivative at every
point is equal to the component of the field intensity in the given
direction. Also of fundamental importance in astronomy and mathematical
physics is the so-called Laplacian of a function u = f(x, y, z). This is
simply the sum of the second-order partial derivatives of u, namely, uxx
+ uvv + uzz, often abbreviated (“del-square”), where is called Laplace’s
operator. The function u is independent of the particular coordinate
system that is used; under certain conditions, gravitational,
electrical, and other potentials satisfy the Laplace equation uxx + uyy
+ uzz = 0. Euler had run across this equation somewhat incidentally in
1752 in studies on hydrodynamics, but Laplace made it a standard part of
mathematical physics.</p>
<p>The publication of the Mécanique céleste of Laplace is commonly
regarded as marking the culmination of the Newtonian view of
gravitation. Accounting for all of the perturbations in the solar
system, Laplace showed the motions to be secular, so that the system
could be regarded as stable. There no longer appeared to be any need for
occasional divine intervention. Napoleon is said to have commented to
Laplace on the latter’s failure to mention God in his monumental work,
whereupon Laplace is reported to have replied, “I have no need for that
hypothesis.” Lagrange, being told about this, is quoted as saying, “Ah,
but it is a beautiful hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Laplace completed not only the gravitational portion of Newton’s
Principia but also some points in the physics. Newton had computed a
velocity of sound on purely theoretical grounds, only to find that the
calculation resulted in too small a value for the speed. In 1816,
Laplace was the first one to point out that the lack of agreement
between calculated and observed speeds was due to the fact that the
computations in the Principia were based on the assumption of isothermal
compressions and expansions, whereas in reality the oscillations for
sound are so rapid that compressions are adiabatic, thereby increasing
the elasticity of the air and the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The minds of Laplace and Lagrange, the two leading mathematicians of
the revolution, were in many ways direct opposites. For Laplace, nature
was the essence, and mathematics was only a kit of tools that he handled
with extraordinary skill; for Lagrange, mathematics was a sublime art
that was its own excuse for being. The mathematics of the Mécanique
céleste has often been described as difficult, but no one calls it
beautiful; the Mécanique analytique, on the other hand, has been admired
as “a scientific poem” in the perfection and grandeur of its
structure.</p>
<p>Legendre</p>
<p>Adrien Marie Legendre (1752–1833) experienced no difficulty in
securing an education, but even he was not a university teacher in the
strict sense, although for five years he taught in the École Militaire
in Paris. Like Carnot, he felt the need for greater rigor in
mathematics.</p>
<p>Geometry</p>
<p>The lack of rigor in geometry as portrayed by Bézout’s Cours de
mathématiques prompted Legendre, who was, after all, primarily an
analyst, to revive some of the intellectual quality of Euclid. The
result was the Éléments de géométrie, which appeared in 1794, the year
of the Terror. Here, too, we see the very antithesis of what is
generally regarded as practical. As Legendre said in the preface, his
object is to present a geometry that shall satisfy l’esprit. The result
of Legendre’s efforts was a remarkably successful textbook, for twenty
editions appeared within the author’s lifetime.</p>
<p>We are prone to forget that during much of the nineteenth century, it
was French mathematics that dominated American teaching, and this was
primarily through the work of the men whom we have been considering.
Textbooks by Lacroix, Biot, and Lagrange were published in America for
use in the schools, but perhaps the most influential of all was the
geometry of Legendre. Davies’ Legendre became almost a synonym for
geometry in America.</p>
<p>Elliptic Integrals</p>
<p>The success of Legendre’s Éléments should not lead one to think of
the author as a geometer. The fields in which Legendre made significant
advances were numerous but chiefly nongeometric—differential equations,
calculus, theory of functions, theory of numbers, and applied
mathematics. He composed a three-volume treatise, Exercices du calcul
intégral (1811–1819), that rivaled Euler’s for comprehensiveness and
authoritativeness; later, he expanded aspects of this in another three
volumes that comprised the Traité des fonctions elliptiques et des
intégrales eulériennes (1825–1832). In these important treatises, as
well as in earlier memoirs, Legendre introduced the name “Eulerian
integrals” for the beta and gamma functions. More important, he provided
some basic tools of analysis, so helpful to mathematical physicists,
that bear his name. Among these are the Legendre functions, which are
solutions of the Legendre differential equation (1 − x2)y″ − 2xy′ + n(n
+ 1)y = 0. Polynomial solutions for positive integral values of n are
known as Legendre polynomials.</p>
<p>Legendre spent much effort in reducing elliptic integrals
(quadratures of the form ∫R(x, s)dx, where R is a rational function and
s is the square root of a polynomial of the third or fourth degree) to
three standard forms that have since borne his name. The elliptic
integrals of the first and second kind in Legendre’s form are</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>respectively, where K2 &lt; 1; those of the third form are somewhat
more complicated. Tables of these integrals, tabulated for given K and
varying values of ϕ, can be found in most comprehensive handbooks, for
the integrals arise in many problems. Legendre’s elliptic integral of
the first kind arises naturally in solving the differential equation for
the motion of a simple pendulum; that of the second kind appears in
seeking the length of arc of an ellipse. Elliptic integrals also arose
in Legendre’s earlier memoirs, especially in one of 1785 on the
gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid, a problem in connection with
which there appeared what are known as zonal harmonics or “Legendre’s
coefficients”—functions used effectively by Laplace in potential
theory.</p>
<p>Legendre was an important figure in geodesy, and in this connection,
he developed the statistical method of least squares. A simple case of
the method of least squares may be described as follows. If observations
have led to three or more approximate equations in two variables, say,
a1x + b1y + c1 = 0, a2x + b2y + c2 = 0, and a3x + b3y + c3 = 0, one
adopts as the “best” values of x and y the solution of the two
simultaneous equations</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>The Memoirs of the Institut also contain one of Legendre’s attempts
to prove the parallel postulate, but of all of his contributions to
mathematics, Legendre was most pleased with the works on elliptic
integrals and the theory of numbers. He published a two-volume Essai sur
la théorie des nombres (1797–1798), the first treatise to be devoted
exclusively to the subject. The famous “last theorem of Fermat”
attracted him, and in about 1825, he gave a proof of its insolvability
for n = 5. Almost equally famous is a theorem on congruences that
Legendre published in the treatise of 1797–1798. If, given integers p
and q, there exists an integer x such that x2 − q is divisible by p,
then q is known as a quadratic residue of p; we now write (following a
notation introduced by Carl Friedrich Gauss) x2 ≡ q (mod p), reading
this as “x2 is congruent to q modulo p.”</p>
<p>Legendre rediscovered a beautiful theorem, given earlier in less
modern form by Euler, known as the law of quadratic reciprocity: if p
and q are odd primes, then the congruences x2 ≡ q (mod p) and x2 ≡ p
(mod q) are either both solvable or both unsolvable, unless both p and q
are of the form 4n + 3, in which case one is solvable and the other is
not. For example, x2 ≡ 13 (mod 17) has the solution x = 8, and x2 ≡ 17
(mod 13) has the solution x = 11, and it can be shown that x2 ≡ 5 (mod
13) and x2 ≡ 13 (mod 5) have no solution. On the other hand, x2 ≡ 19
(mod 11) is not solvable, whereas x2 ≡ 11 (mod 19) has the solution x =
7. The theorem is here stated in the customary modern form. In the
exposition of Legendre, it becomes</p>
<p>where the Legendre symbol (p/q) denotes 1 or −1, according as x2 ≡ p
(mod q) is, or is not, solvable for x.</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Euclid, it had been known that the number of
primes is infinite, yet it is obvious that the density of prime numbers
decreases as we move on to ever larger integers. Hence, it became one of
the most famous problems to describe the distribution of primes among
the natural numbers. Mathematicians were looking for a rule, known as
the prime number theorem, that should express the number of primes less
than a given integer n as a function of n, usually written π(n). In his
well-known treatise of 1797–1798, Legendre conjectured, on the basis of
a count of a large number of primes, that π(n) approaches n/(ln n −
1.08366) as n increases indefinitely. This conjecture comes close to the
truth, but a precise statement of the theorem that π(n) → n/ln n,
suggested several times during the following century, was not proved
until 1896. Legendre showed that there is no rational algebraic function
that always gives primes, but he noted that n2 + n + 17 is prime for all
values of n from 1 to 16 and 2n2 + 29 is prime for values of n from 1 to
28. (Earlier, Euler had shown that n2 − n + 41 is prime for values of n
from 1 to 40.)</p>
<p>Aspects of Abstraction</p>
<p>In looking at the achievements of these six men, one is struck by a
lack of utilitarian motive in their work. Carnot’s deals with broad
principles, not with technology. The Mécanique of Lagrange is likewise
concerned with a postulational treatment of the subject, far removed
from criteria of practicability. It is primarily to him that we owe such
compact forms, though somewhat differently expressed, as</p>
<p>for the area of a triangle and for the volume of a tetrahedron,
respectively, results that appeared in a paper, “Solutions analytiques
de quelques problèmes sur les pyramides triangulaires,” delivered in
1773 and published in 1775. Such work looks pretty but inconsequential,
yet it contained an idea that was to become, through the educational
reforms of the revolution, very important. As Lagrange expressed it, “I
flatter myself that the solutions which I am going to give will be of
interest to geometers as much for the methods as for the results. These
solutions are purely analytic and can even be understood without
figures.” True to his promise, there is not a single diagram throughout
the work. Monge, too, although he used diagrams and models in
descriptive and differential geometry, somehow seems to have come to the
conclusion that one should avoid the use of diagrams in elementary
analytic geometry. Perhaps Carnot felt somewhat the same way, for his
Essai, antedating the Mécanique of Lagrange, contains not a single
diagram.</p>
<p>Paris in the 1820s</p>
<p>Paris appeared particularly attractive to students of mathematics in
the 1820s. Not only did it boast the opportunity for systematic training
epitomized by the École Polytechnique, with its sizable staff of
exceptional mathematicians who offered lectures on a wide area of
subjects in pure and applied fields, but there were cutting-edge
mathematical publications. Aside from independent works printed in the
French capital, both the Mémoires of the Academy of Sciences and the
Journal of the École Polytechnique reported major new mathematical
research results. Moreover, the Collège de France and other institutions
harbored additional mathematicians. Still living in Paris, though at the
end of their careers, were Laplace and Legendre. Laplace published the
last volume of his Mécanique celeste in 1825, two years before his
death. Legendre was active in the Academy, reviewing the work of younger
men and updating his own results, such as his standard work on number
theory, the third edition of which appeared in 1830. Perhaps the most
influential of the next generation of mathematicians who was active in
Paris in the 1820s was J.-B. Fourier (1768–1830).</p>
<p>Fourier</p>
<p>Fourier was the son of a tailor in Auxerre. Having been orphaned in
childhood, he obtained his education through the guidance of the Church,
first at the local military school, then in a school run by the
Benedictine Order. During the revolution, he taught school in his
hometown and was politically active. Arrested during the Terror, on his
release he enrolled in the École Normale, which led to his becoming an
assistant to Lagrange and Monge at the newly formed École Polytechnique.
In 1798, he joined Monge in Napoleon’s Egyptian adventure, subsequently
becoming secretary of the Institut d’Égypte and compiling the
Description de l’Égypte. On his return to France, he held a number of
administrative posts, but he nevertheless had opportunity to continue
his scholarly pursuits. In 1822, he was elected secrétaire perpetuel of
the Académie des Sciences in Paris, which placed him in an influential
position during the 1820s. Among the young foreigners in Paris in the
1820s who came under Fourier’s influence were P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet
(1805–1859) from Prussia, Jean-Jacques-François Sturm (1803–1855) from
Switzerland, and Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky (1801–1861) from
Russia. Compatriots who benefited from his counsel included Sophie
Germain (1776–1831) and Joseph Liouville (1809–1882).</p>
<p>Fourier is best known today for his celebrated Théorie analytique de
la chaleur of 1822. This book, described by Lord Kelvin as “a great
mathematical poem,” was a development of ideas that ten years earlier
had won him the Académie prize for an essay on the mathematical theory
of heat. Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre, the referees, had criticized
the essay for a certain looseness of reasoning; the later clarification
of Fourier’s ideas was to some extent the reason that the nineteenth
century came to be called the age of rigor.</p>
<p>The chief contribution of Fourier and his classic in mathematics was
the idea, adumbrated by Daniel Bernoulli, that any function y = f(x) can
be represented by a series of the form</p>
<p>now known as a Fourier series. Such a series representation affords
considerably greater generality in the type of functions that can be
studied than does the Taylor series. Even if there are many points at
which the derivative does not exist (as in Fig. 18.4) or at which the
function is not continuous (as in Fig. 18.5), the function may still
have a Fourier expansion. This expansion is easily found on noting
that</p>
<p>FIG. 18.4</p>
<p>FIG. 18.5</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Fourier, like Monge, had fallen from grace when the Bourbon
restoration followed the exile of Napoleon in 1815, but his work has
ever since been fundamental in both physics and mathematics. Functions
no longer needed to be of the well-behaved form with which
mathematicians had been familiar. In 1837, Lejeune Dirichlet, for
instance, suggested a very broad definition of function: If a variable y
is so related to a variable x that whenever a numerical value is
assigned to x, there is a rule according to which a unique value of y is
determined, then y is said to be a function of the independent variable
x. This comes close to the modern view of a correspondence between two
sets of numbers, but the concepts of “set” and “real number” had not at
that time been established. To indicate the completely arbitrary nature
of the rule of correspondence, Dirichlet proposed a very “badly behaved”
function: When x is rational, let y = c, and when x is irrational, let y
= d ≠ c. This function, often known as Dirichlet’s function, is so
pathological that there is no value of x for which it is continuous.
Dirichlet also gave the first rigorous proof of the convergence of a
Fourier series for a function subject to certain restrictions, known as
Dirichlet’s conditions. A Fourier series does not always converge to the
value of a function from which it is derived, but in Leopold Crelle’s
Journal for 1828, Dirichlet proved the following theorem: If f(x) is
periodic of period 2π, if for −π &lt; x &lt; π the function f(x) has a
finite number of maximum and minimum values and a finite number of
discontinuities, and if is finite, then the Fourier series converges to
f(x) at all points where f(x) is continuous, and at jump points it
converges to the arithmetic mean of the right-hand and left-hand limits
of the function. Also useful is another theorem known as Dirichlet’s
test: If the terms in the series a1b1 + a2b2 + ⋯ + anbn + ⋯ are such
that the b’s are positive and monotonically tending toward zero, and if
there is a number M such that for all values of m, then the series
converges.</p>
<p>The name of Dirichlet arises in many other connections in pure and
applied mathematics. Especially important in thermodynamics and
electrodynamics is the Dirichlet problem: Given a region R bounded by a
closed curve C and a function f(x, y) continuous on C, find a function
F(x, y) continuous in R and on C that satisfies the Laplace equation in
R and is equal to f on C. In pure mathematics, Dirichlet is well-known
for his application of analysis to the theory of numbers, in connection
with which he introduced the Dirichlet series, , where the Dirichlet
coefficients an are complex numbers, the Dirichlet exponents λn are real
monotonically increasing numbers, and S is a complex variable.</p>
<p>Cauchy</p>
<p>The star of the 1820s was a man born in the year of the revolution,
when Fourier was twenty-one. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857), the son
of well-educated parents, studied at the École Polytechnique, which he
entered in 1805, and the École des Ponts et Chaussées, where he
matriculated in 1807. He served as an engineer until 1813, when he
returned to Paris. By that time, he had already solved several problems
of interest to mathematicians. These included the determination of a
convex polyhedron by its faces, the expression of a number as a sum of
n-gonal numbers, and a study of determinants. The latter is one of the
few branches in which the role of Gauss was slight, although it was from
the terminology of Gauss in a somewhat different context that Cauchy
derived the name “determinant” for what he otherwise described as a
class of alternating symmetric functions, such as a1b2 − b1a2. A good
case could be made for having the definitive history of determinants
begin in 1812, when Cauchy read to the Institut a long memoir on the
subject, although in doing so, one would fail to do justice to some
pioneer work as early as 1772 by Laplace and Alexandre-Théophile
Vandermonde (1735–1796). Both Lagrange and Laplace had taken an interest
in Cauchy’s progress, and he followed in the tradition of Lagrange in
his preference for pure mathematics in elegant form with due attention
to rigorous proofs. His 1812 paper on determinants, to be followed by
many others from him on the same topic, was in this tradition of giving
emphasis to the symmetries of notation with which it abounds.</p>
<p>In the pedagogical approach to determinants, today it is customary to
begin with the square array and then to attach a meaning or a value to
this through an expansion in terms of transpositions or permutations. In
the memoir of Cauchy, the author did the opposite. He began with the n
elements or numbers, a1, a2, a3, . . .an, and formed the product of
these by all of the differences of distinct elements: a1a2a3 . . .an(a2
− a1)(a3 − a1). . .(an − a1)(a3 − a2). . .(an − a2). . .(an − an−1). He
then defined the determinant as the expression obtained on changing
every indicated power into a second subscript, so that becomes ar · s;
he wrote this as S(± a1 · 1a2 · 2a3 · 3. . .an · n). Then he arranged
the n2 different quantities in this determinant in a square array not
unlike that used today:</p>
<p>As thus arranged, the n2 quantities in his determinant were said to
form “a symmetric system of order n.” He defined conjugate terms as
elements the orders of whose subscripts are reversed, and he called
terms that are self-conjugate “principal terms”; the product of the
terms in what we call the “main diagonal” or the “principal diagonal,”
he called the “principal product.” Later in the memoir, Cauchy gave
other rules for determining the sign of a term in the expansion, using
circular substitutions.</p>
<p>Cauchy’s eighty-four-page memoir of 1812 was not his only work on the
subject of determinants; from then on, he found many opportunities to
use them in a variety of situations. In a memoir of 1815, on wave
propagation, he applied the language of determinants to a problem in
geometry and also to one in physics. Cauchy asserted that if A, B, and C
are the lengths of three edges of a parallelepiped, and if the
projections of these on the x, y, and z axes of a rectangular coordinate
system are</p>
<p>then the volume of the parallelepiped will be A1B2C3 − A1B3C2 +
A2B3C1−A2B1C3 + A3B1C2 − A3B2C1 = S(±A1B2C3). In the same memoir, in
connection with the propagation of waves, he applied his determinant
notation to partial derivatives, replacing a condition that required two
lines for its expression by the simple abbreviation</p>
<p>The left-hand side of this is obviously what is now called the
“Jacobian” of x, y, z with respect to a, b, c. The name of Carl Gustav
Jacob Jacobi is attached to functional determinants of this form not
because he was the first to use them, but because he was an algorithm
builder who was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities inherent
in determinant notations. It was not until 1829 that Jacobi first used
the functional determinants that bear his name.</p>
<p>By this time, Cauchy was well established in Paris. In 1814, two
years after the memoir on determinants, he had presented to the French
Academy a paper that contains the germs of some of his major
contributions to the theory of complex functions. After another two
years, he received praise for a prize-winning memoir on hydrodynamics.
The year 1819 finds him displaying the method of characteristics in the
solution of partial differential equations; shortly thereafter, he
submitted a classic on the theory of elasticity. During this decade, he
was appointed to membership in the Academy of Sciences, as well as a
professorship at the École Polytechnique; after this, he married.</p>
<p>Cauchy filled the Journal of the École Polytechnique and the Cornptes
Rendus of the Académie with ever longer memoirs. These were on a variety
of topics but especially on the theory of functions of a complex
variable, a field of which, from 1814 on, Cauchy became the effective
founder. In 1806, Jean Robert Argand (1768–1822) of Geneva had published
an account of the graphical representation of complex numbers. Although,
at first, this went almost as unnoticed as the work of Caspar Wessel, by
the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century, most of Europe
was familiar, through Cauchy, not only with the Wessel-Argand-Gaussian
diagram for a complex number, but with the fundamental properties of
complex functions as well. In the eighteenth century, problems in
complex variables occasionally had arisen in connection with the physics
of Euler and d’Alembert, but now they became a part of pure mathematics.
Inasmuch as two dimensions are required for a pictorial representation
of the independent variable alone, it would take four dimensions to
graphically portray a functional relationship between two complex
variables, w = f(z). Complex variable theory entails a higher degree of
abstraction and complexity than does the study of functions of a real
variable. Definitions and rules of differentiation, for example, cannot
readily be carried over from the real case to the complex, and the
derivative in the latter case is no longer pictured as the slope of the
tangent to a curve. Without the crutch of visualization, one is likely
to require more precise and careful definitions of concepts. To supply
this need was one of Cauchy’s contributions to the calculus, for both
real variables and complex variables.</p>
<p>The first teachers in the École Polytechnique had set a precedent
according to which even the greatest of mathematicians are not above
writing textbooks on all levels, and Cauchy followed in this tradition.
In three books—Cours d’ analyse de l’École Polytechnique (1821), Resumé
des leçons sur le calcul infinitesimal (1823), and Leçons sur le calcul
différentiel (1829)—he gave to elementary calculus the character that it
bears today. Rejecting the “Taylor’s theorem approach” of Lagrange, he
made the limit concept of d’Alembert fundamental, but he gave it an
arithmetic character of greater precision. Dispensing with geometry and
with infinitesimals or velocities, he gave a relatively clear-cut
definition of limit:</p>
<p>When the successive values attributed to a variable approach
indefinitely a fixed value so as to end by differing from it by as
little as one wishes, this last is called the limit of all the
others.</p>
<p>Where many earlier mathematicians had thought of an infinitesimal as
a very small fixed number, Cauchy clearly defined it as a dependent
variable:</p>
<p>One says that a variable quantity becomes infinitely small when its
numerical value decreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge
toward the limit zero.</p>
<p>In the calculus of Cauchy, the concepts of function and limit of a
function were fundamental. In defining the derivative of y = f(x) with
respect to x, he gave to the variable x an increment Δx = i and formed
the ratio</p>
<p>The limit of this difference quotient as i approaches zero he defined
as the derivative f′(x) of y with respect to x. The differential he
relegated to a subsidiary role, although he was aware of its operational
facility. If dx is a finite quantity, the differential dy of y = f(x) is
defined simply as f′(x)dx. Cauchy also gave a satisfactory definition of
a continuous function. The function f(x) is continuous within given
limits if between these limits an infinitely small increment i in the
variable x always produces an infinitely small increment, f(x + i) −
f(x), in the function itself. When we bear in mind Cauchy’s definition
of infinitely small quantities in terms of limits, his definition of
continuity parallels that used today.</p>
<p>During the eighteenth century, integration had been treated as the
inverse of differentiation. Cauchy’s definition of derivative makes it
clear that the derivative will not exist at a point for which the
function is discontinuous, yet the integral may afford no difficulty.
Even discontinuous curves may determine a well-defined area. Hence,
Cauchy defined the definite integral in terms of the limit of the
integral sums in a manner not very different from that used in
elementary textbooks today, except that he took the value of the
function always at the left-hand end point of the interval. If Sn = (x1
− x0)f(x0) + (x2 − x1 )f(x1) ⋯ + (X − xn−1)f(xn−1), then the limit S of
this sum Sn, as the magnitudes of the intervals xi − xi−1 decrease
indefinitely, is the definite integral of the function f(x) for the
interval from x = x0 to x = X. It is from Cauchy’s concept of the
integral as a limit of a sum, rather than from the antiderivative, that
the many fruitful modern generalizations of the integral have
arisen.</p>
<p>Having defined the integral independently of differentiation, it was
necessary for Cauchy to prove the usual relation between the integral
and the antiderivative, and this he accomplished through use of the
theorem of mean value. If f(x) is continuous over the closed interval
[a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b), then there will
be some value x0 such that a &lt; x0 &lt; b and f(b) − f(a) = (b −
a)f′(x0). This is a fairly obvious generalization of Rolle’s theorem,
which was known a century earlier. The mean-value theorem, however, did
not attract serious attention until the days of Cauchy, but it has since
continued to play a basic role in analysis. It is with justice,
therefore, that a still more general form,</p>
<p>with suitable restrictions on f(x) and g(x), is known as Cauchy’s
mean-value theorem.</p>
<p>The history of mathematics teems with cases of simultaneity and near
simultaneity of discovery, some of which have already been noted. The
work by Cauchy that we have just described is another case in point, for
similar views were developed at about the same time by Bernhard Bolzano
(1781–1848), a Czechoslovakian priest whose theological views were
frowned on by his church and whose mathematical work was most
undeservedly overlooked by his lay and clerical contemporaries. For a
time Cauchy lived at Prague, where Bolzano was born and died, yet there
is no indication that the men met. The similarity in their
arithmetization of the calculus and of their definitions of limit,
derivative, continuity, and convergence was only a coincidence. In 1817,
Bolzano had published a book, Rein analytischer Beweis, devoted to a
purely arithmetic proof of the location theorem in algebra, and this had
required a nongeometric approach to the continuity of a curve or a
function. Going considerably further in his unorthodox ideas, he
disclosed some important properties of infinite sets in a posthumous
work of 1850, Paradoxien des Unendlichen.</p>
<p>From Galileo’s paradox on the one-to-one correspondence between
integers and perfect squares, Bolzano went on to show that similar
correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and a proper
subset are commonplace. For example, a simple linear equation, such as y
= 2x, establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the real numbers y
in the interval from 0 to 2, for example, and the real numbers x in half
of this interval. That is, there are just as many real numbers between 0
and 1 as between 0 and 2, or just as many points in a line segment 1
inch long as in a line segment 2 inches long. Bolzano even seems to have
recognized, by about 1840, that the infinity of real numbers is of a
type different from the infinity of integers, being nondenumerable. In
such speculations on infinite sets, the Bohemian philosopher came closer
to parts of modern mathematics than had his better-known contemporaries.
Both Gauss and Cauchy seem to have had a kind of horror infiniti,
insisting that there could be no such thing as a completed infinite in
mathematics. Their work on “orders of infinity” in reality was far
removed from the concepts of Bolzano, for to say, as Cauchy in essence
did, that a function y is infinite of order n with respect to x if is
quite different from making a statement about correspondences between
sets.</p>
<p>Bolzano was a “voice crying in the wilderness,” and many of his
results had to be rediscovered later. Among these was the recognition
that there are pathological functions that do not behave as
mathematicians had always expected them to behave. Newton, for instance,
had assumed that curves are generated by smooth and continuous motions.
There might be occasional abrupt changes in direction or even some
discontinuities at isolated points, but during the first half of the
nineteenth century, it was generally assumed that a continuous real
function must have a derivative at most points. In 1834, however,
Bolzano had thought up a function continuous for an interval but,
despite physical intuition to the contrary, having no derivative at any
point in the interval. The example given by Bolzano unfortunately did
not become known; hence, credit for building the first continuous but
nowhere differentiable function generally goes to Karl Weierstrass about
a third of a century later. Similarly, it is the name of Cauchy, rather
than that of Bolzano, that is attached to an important test of
convergence for an infinite series or sequence. Occasionally, before
their time, there had been warnings about the need to test an infinite
series for convergence. For example, as early as 1812, Gauss used the
ratio test to show that his hypergeometric series</p>
<p>converges for ∣x∣ &lt; 1 and diverges for ∣x∣ &gt; 1. This test seems
to have been first used much earlier, in England, by Edward Waring,
although it generally bears the name of d’Alembert or, more
occasionally, that of Cauchy.</p>
<p>In 1811, Gauss informed an astronomer friend, F. W. Bessel
(1784–1846), of a discovery that he had made in what was soon to become
a new subject in the hands of Cauchy and that today bears the latter’s
name. The theory of functions of a real variable had been developed by
Lagrange, but the theory of functions of a complex variable awaited the
efforts of Cauchy, yet Gauss perceived a theorem of fundamental
significance in the as-yet-unworked field. If, in the complex or
Gaussian plane, one draws a simple closed curve, and if a function f(z)
of the complex variable z = x + iy is analytic (that is, has a
derivative) at every point on the curve and within the curve, then the
line integral of f(z) taken along the curve is zero.</p>
<p>The name of Cauchy appears today in connection with a number of
theorems on infinite series, for, despite some efforts on the part of
Gauss and Abel, it was largely through Cauchy that the mathematician’s
conscience was pricked concerning the need for vigilance with regard to
convergence. Having defined a series to be convergent if, for increasing
values of n, the sum Sn of the first n terms approaches a limit S,
called the sum of the series, Cauchy proved that a necessary and
sufficient condition that an infinite series converge is that for a
given value of p, the magnitude of the difference between Sn and Sn + p
tends toward zero as n increases indefinitely. This condition for
“convergence within itself” has come to be known as Cauchy’s criterion,
but it was known earlier to Bolzano (and possibly still earlier to
Euler).</p>
<p>In 1831, Cauchy also announced the theorem that an analytic function
of a complex variable w = f(z) can be expanded about a point z = z0 in a
power series that is convergent for all values of z within a circle
having z0 as center and passing through the singular point of f(z)
nearest to z0. From this time on, the use of infinite series became an
essential part of the theory of functions of both real and complex
variables. Several tests for convergence bear Cauchy’s name, as does a
particular form of the remainder in the Taylor series expansion of a
function, the more usual form being attributed to Lagrange. The period
of rigor in mathematics was taking hold rapidly. It is said that when
Cauchy read his first paper on the convergence of series to the
Académie, Laplace hurried home to verify that he had not made use of any
divergent series in his Mécanique céleste. Toward the end of his life,
Cauchy became aware of the important notion of “uniform convergence,”
but here, too, he was not alone, having been anticipated by the
physicist G. G. Stokes (1819–1903) and others.</p>
<p>As broader classes of differential equations were considered, the
question under what conditions a solution exists moved to the
foreground. Cauchy provided two widely used methods for answering this
question. Building on the work of Euler, Cauchy showed how to use a
method of approximations by difference equations, providing an existence
proof for the approximate solutions; this became the basis of the
Cauchy-Lipschitz technique in the solution of ordinary differential
equations. Rudolf Lipschitz (1831–1904), a student of Dirichlet’s,
refined and generalized Cauchy’s work in 1876; he replaced the so-called
Lipschitz condition with Cauchy’s condition that the first derivatives
be continuous and extended the work to systems of higher-order
equations. Also due to Cauchy, though best known in the form given by
the French mathematicians Briot and Jean-Claude Bouquet in 1854, is the
method of majorants, which Cauchy called his calcul des limites. After
successfully using it for ordinary differential equations, Cauchy
applied it to certain systems of first-order partial differential
equations. Here again, his work came to be known in the generalized form
it received from a later nineteenth-century mathematician. Sofia
Kovalevskaya (Sonia Kowalewski) (1850–1891) extended Cauchy’s result to
a broad class of equations of higher order, simplifying his technique in
the process; further streamlined by subsequent analysts, the
Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem received its best-known form in a textbook by
Édouard Goursat (1858–1936) that was widely used in the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Because of the legendary, voluminous nature of his publications,
Cauchy often lost track of results he had obtained. Also, as often
happens, he assessed the relative significance of his own work quite
differently from the way later generations have seen it. The best-known
illustration of this is found in complex function theory; here, he had
provided a powerful tool for analysts with the so-called Cauchy integral
theorem, yet he attached far more significance to his “calculus of
residues,” which failed to gain favor with later workers in the
field.</p>
<p>The prolific Cauchy contributed to almost as many fields as did his
contemporary Gauss. He, too, contributed to mechanics and error theory.
Although in the theory of numbers, his work is less well known than that
of Legendre and Gauss, it is to Cauchy that we owe the first general
proof of one of the most beautiful and difficult theorems of Fermat—that
every positive integer is the sum of at most three triangular numbers or
four square numbers or five pentagonal numbers or six hexagonal numbers,
and so on, indefinitely. This proof is a fitting climax to the study of
figurate numbers initiated by the Pythagoreans some 2,300 years
earlier.</p>
<p>Cauchy evidently was little attracted to geometry in its various
forms. In 1811, however, in one of his very earliest memoirs, he
presented a generalization of the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula E +
2 = F + V, where E, F, and V are, respectively, the number of edges,
faces, and vertices of the polyhedron; we have noted a case of his
application of determinants in finding the volume of a tetrahedron.</p>
<p>Diffusion</p>
<p>The leadership role of the mathematical community in Paris diminished
rapidly after 1830. This was due in part to the dying out of an older
generation; in part, to efforts elsewhere, notably in England and
Prussia, to establish mathematics more solidly; and, in part, to
political circumstances in France. After the deaths in 1827, 1830, and
1833, respectively, of Laplace, Fourier, and Legendre, and the departure
of Cauchy from Paris in 1830, the best-known French mathematician born
before the revolution and still active was Siméon-Denis Poisson
(1781–1840).</p>
<p>Poisson</p>
<p>Poisson would become a physician, but strong mathematical interests
led him in 1798 to enter the École Polytechnique, where on graduation he
became successively a lecturer, a professor, and an examiner. He is said
to have once remarked that life is good for only two things: to do
mathematics and to teach it. Consequently, he published almost 400
works, and he enjoyed a reputation as an excellent instructor.</p>
<p>The direction of his research is indicated in part by a sentence from
a letter written in 1826 by Abel concerning the mathematicians in Paris:
“Cauchy is the only one occupied with pure mathematics; Poisson,
Fourier, Ampère, etc., busy themselves exclusively with magnetism and
other physical subjects.” This should not be taken too literally, but
Poisson, in memoirs of 1812, did help make electricity and magnetism a
branch of mathematical physics, as did Gauss, Cauchy, and Green. Poisson
was also a worthy successor to Laplace in studies on celestial mechanics
and the attraction of spheroids. The Poisson integral in potential
theory, the Poisson brackets in differential equations, the Poisson
ratio in elasticity, and Poisson’s constant in electricity indicate the
importance of his contributions to various fields of applied
mathematics. Two of his best-known treatises were the Traité de
mécanique (2 vols., 1811, 1833) and Recherches sur la probabilité des
jugements (1837). In the latter appears the familiar Poisson
distribution, or Poisson’s law of large numbers. In the binomial
distribution (p + q)n, (where p + q = 1 and n is the number of trials),
as n increases indefinitely, the binomial distribution ordinarily tends
toward a normal distribution, but if, as n increases indefinitely, p
approaches zero, the product np remaining constant, the limiting case of
the binomial distribution is the Poisson distribution.</p>
<p>His analytic skill in refining the mathematical physics of Lagrange
and Laplace gained him early fame. His critical analyses of the work of
others often led him to innovative new concepts; an example is his
memoir on potential theory following his study of the work of James
Ivory (1765–1842). Poisson’s important memoir, in turn, was studied by
George Green (1793–1841) and was a significant ingredient in Green’s
1828 memoir on the subject. Yet Poisson’s clinging to superseded
physical concepts and his claims to a rigor that applied to his
self-assurance more than to his mathematics kept him from assuming the
mantle of mathematical leadership in later years. When men such as
Jacobi and Dirichlet chose the problems of Poisson for special treatment
in their lectures and memoirs, it was to recast them in a new mold.</p>
<p>Reforms in England and Prussia</p>
<p>Reform characterized much of the activity affecting mathematicians in
England, as well as in Prussia. The turning point in British mathematics
came in 1813 with the formation at Trinity College, Cambridge, of the
Analytical Society, which was led by three young Cantabrigians: the
algebraist George Peacock (1791–1858), the astronomer John Herschel
(1792–1871), and Charles Babbage (1791/2–1871) of “Calculating Engines”
fame. The immediate purpose of the society was to reform the teaching
and the notation of the calculus, and in 1817, when Peacock was
appointed an examiner for the mathematical tripos, differential notation
replaced fluxional symbols on the Cambridge examination. Peacock was
himself a Cambridge graduate and teacher, the first of many Trinity
College men who were to lead in the development of algebra. He graduated
as second wrangler—that is, he took second place in the celebrated
tripos examination (initiated in 1725) for undergraduates who had
specialized in mathematics—the first wrangler being John Herschel,
another of the founders of the Analytical Society. Peacock was a zealous
administrator and reformer, taking an active part in modifying the
university statutes and in establishing the Astronomical Society of
London, the Philosophical Society of Cambridge, and the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, the latter of which set the
pattern for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The
last twenty years of his life were spent as dean of Ely cathedral.</p>
<p>Peacock did not produce any outstanding new results in mathematics,
but he was of great importance in reforming the subject in Britain,
especially with respect to algebra. At Cambridge, there had been a
tendency in algebra as conservative as that in geometry and analysis.
Whereas on the Continent, mathematicians were developing the graphical
representation of complex numbers, in England there were protests that
not even negative numbers had validity.</p>
<p>In the words of Charles Babbage, the aim of the Analytical Society
was to promote “the principles of pure d-ism as opposed to the dot-age
of the university.” (A second aim of the Society was “to leave the world
wiser than they found it.”) This was, of course, a reference to the
continued refusal of the English to abandon the dotted fluxions of
Newton for the differentials of Leibniz; more generally, it also implied
a desire to take advantage of the great strides in mathematics that had
been made on the Continent. In 1816, as a result of the society’s
inspiration, an English translation of Lacroix’s one-volume Calculus was
published, and within a few years, British mathematicians were in a
position to vie with their contemporaries on the Continent. For example,
George Green, a self-educated miller’s son, who, as we noted, studied
Poisson’s memoir on potential theory, in 1828 published for private
circulation the essay on electricity and magnetism that contained the
important theorem bearing his name: If P(x, y) and Q(x, y) have
continuous partial derivatives over a region R of the xy-plane bounded
by a curve C, then . This theorem, or its analogue in three dimensions,
is also known as Gauss’s theorem, for Green’s results were largely
overlooked until rediscovered by Lord Kelvin in 1846. The theorem,
meanwhile, had also been discovered by Mikhail Ostrogradski and in
Russia, it bears his name to this day.</p>
<p>In Prussia, a large share of the credit for the rejuvenation of
mathematics goes to the brothers Humboldt. Wilhelm von Humboldt
(1767–1835), a philologist, is best known for his reform of the Prussian
educational system. Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), a liberal
courtier, a natural historian, and a friend of mathematical scientists,
used his considerable influence in Berlin to assure Dirichlet’s return
to Prussia from Paris; he also aided the careers of C. G. J. Jacobi and
G. Eisenstein, among others, and showed interest in Abel.</p>
<p>As a result, by midcentury a substantial number of mathematicians
were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and England. Each
country had established a major mathematical journal in the second
quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the Journal de
Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées. The Cambridge Mathematical Journal
followed. Crelle’s Journal continued to thrive, with much active support
from Dirichlet and his students.</p>
