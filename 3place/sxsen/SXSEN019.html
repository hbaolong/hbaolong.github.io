15 Analysis, Synthesis, the Infinite, and Numbers</h4>
<p>The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me.</p>
<p>—Pascal</p>
<p>Galileo’s Two New Sciences</p>
<p>While Kepler had been studying wine barrels, Galileo was scanning the
heavens with his telescope and rolling balls down inclined planes. The
results of Galileo’s efforts were two famous treatises, one astronomical
and the other physical. They were both written in Italian, but we shall
refer to them in English as The Two Chief Systems (1632) and The Two New
Sciences (1638). The first was a dialogue concerning the relative merits
of the Ptolemaic and Copernican views of the universe, carried on by
three men: Salviati (a scientifically informed scholar), Sagredo (an
intelligent layman), and Simplicio (an obtuse Aristotelian). In the
dialogue, Galileo left little doubt about where his preferences lay, and
the consequences were his trial and detention. During the years of his
exile, he nevertheless prepared The Two New Sciences, a dialogue
concerning dynamics and the strength of materials, carried out by the
same three characters. Although neither of the two great Galilean
treatises was in a strict sense mathematical, there are in both of them
many points at which appeal is made to mathematics, frequently to the
properties of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.</p>
<p>Galileo Galilei</p>
<p>The infinitely small was of more immediate relevance to Galileo than
the infinitely large, for he found it essential in his dynamics. Galileo
gave the impression that dynamics was a totally new science created by
him, and all too many writers since have agreed with this claim. It is
virtually certain, however, that he was thoroughly familiar with the
work of Oresme on the latitude of forms, and several times in The Two
New Sciences, Galileo had occasion to use a diagram of velocities
similar to the triangle graph of Oresme’s. Nevertheless, Galileo
organized Oresme’s ideas and gave them a mathematical precision that had
been lacking. Among the new contributions to dynamics was Galileo’s
analysis of projectile motion into a uniform horizontal component and a
uniformly accelerated vertical component. As a result, he was able to
show that the path of a projectile, disregarding air resistance, is a
parabola. It is a striking fact that the conic sections had been studied
for almost 2,000 years before two of them almost simultaneously found
applicability in science: the ellipse in astronomy and the parabola in
physics. Galileo mistakenly thought he had found a further application
of the parabola in the curve of suspension of a flexible rope or wire or
chain (catena), but mathematicians later in the century proved that this
curve, the catenary, not only is not a parabola, it is not even
algebraic. Galileo had noted the curve now known as the cycloid, traced
out by a point on the rim of a wheel as it rolls along a horizontal
path, and he tried to find the area under one arch of it. The best he
could do was to trace the curve on paper, cut out an arch, and weigh it;
then he concluded that the area was a little less than three times the
area of the generating circle. Galileo abandoned study of the curve,
suggesting only that the cycloid would make an attractive arch for a
bridge.</p>
<p>A more important contribution to mathematics was made by Galileo in
the Two Chief Systems of 1632, at a point on the “third day” when
Salviati adumbrated the idea of an infinitesimal of higher order.
Simplicio had argued that an object on a rotating earth should be thrown
off tangentially by the motion, but Salviati argued that the distance QR
through which an object has to fall to remain on the earth, while the
latter rotates through a small angle θ (Fig. 15.1), is infinitely small
compared with the tangential distance PQ through which the object
travels horizontally. Hence, even a very small downward tendency, as
compared with the forward impetus, will be sufficient to hold the object
on the earth. Galileo’s argument here is equivalent to saying that PS =
vers θ is an infinitesimal of higher order with respect to lines PQ or
RS or arc PR.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.1</p>
<p>From the infinite in geometry, Salviati led Simplicio to the infinite
in arithmetic, pointing out that a one-to-one correspondence can be set
up between all of the integers and the perfect squares, despite the fact
that the further one proceeds in the sequence of integers, the scarcer
the perfect squares become. Through the simple expedient of counting the
perfect squares, a one-to-one correspondence is established in which
each integer inevitably is matched against a perfect square, and vice
versa. Even though there are many whole numbers that are not perfect
squares (and the proportion of these increases as we consider larger and
larger numbers), “we must say that there are as many squares as there
are numbers.” Galileo here was face-to-face with the fundamental
property of an infinite set—that a part of the set can be equal to the
whole set—but Galileo did not draw this conclusion. Although Salviati
correctly concluded that the number of perfect squares is not less than
the number of integers, he could not bring himself to make the statement
that they are equal. Instead, he simply concluded that “the attributes
‘equal,’ ‘greater,’ and ‘less’ are not applicable to infinite, but only
to finite quantities.” He even asserted (incorrectly, we now know) that
one cannot say that one infinite number is greater than another infinite
number or even that an infinite number is greater than a finite number.
Galileo, like Moses, came within sight of the promised land, but he
could not enter it.</p>
<p>Bonaventura Cavalieri</p>
<p>Galileo had intended to write a treatise on the infinite in
mathematics, but if he did, it has not been found. Meanwhile, his
disciple Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598–1647) was spurred by Kepler’s
Stereometria, as well as by ancient and medieval views and by Galileo’s
encouragement, to organize his thoughts on infinitesimals in the form of
a book. Cavalieri was a member of a religious order (a Jesuate, not a
Jesuit, as is frequently but incorrectly stated) who lived in Milan and
Rome before becoming professor of mathematics at Bologna in 1629.
Characteristically for that time, he wrote on many aspects of pure and
applied mathematics—geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, and optics—and he
was the first Italian writer to appreciate the value of logarithms. In
his Directorium Universale Uranometricum of 1632, he published tables of
sines, tangents, secants, and versed sines, together with their
logarithms, to eight places; but the world remembers him instead for one
of the most influential books of the early modern period, the Geometria
Indivisibilibus Continuorum, published in 1635.</p>
<p>The argument on which the book is based is essentially that implied
by Oresme, Kepler, and Galileo—that an area can be thought of as made up
of lines or “indivisibles” and that a solid volume can be regarded
similarly as composed of areas that are indivisible or quasi-atomic
volumes. Although Cavalieri at the time could scarcely have realized it,
he was following in very respectable footsteps indeed, for this is
precisely the type of reasoning that Archimedes had used in the Method,
which at that time had been lost. But Cavalieri, unlike Archimedes, felt
no compunction about the logical deficiencies behind such
procedures.</p>
<p>The general principle that in an equation involving infinitesimals,
those of higher order are to be discarded because they have no effect on
the final result is frequently erroneously attributed to Cavalieri’s
Geometria Indivisibilibus. The author undoubtedly was familiar with such
an idea, for it is implied in some of the work of Galileo, and it
appeared more specifically in results of contemporary French
mathematicians, but Cavalieri assumed almost the opposite of this
principle. There was in Cavalieri’s method no process of continued
approximation or any omission of terms, for he used a strict one-to-one
pairing of the elements in two configurations. No elements are
discarded, no matter what the dimension. The general approach and the
specious plausibility of the method of indivisibles are well illustrated
by the proposition still known in many solid geometry books as “the
theorem of Cavalieri”:</p>
<p>If two solids have equal altitudes, and if sections made by planes
parallel to the bases and at equal distances from them are always in a
given ratio, then the volumes of the solids also are in this ratio
(Smith 1959, pp. 605–609).</p>
<p>Cavalieri concentrated on an extremely useful geometric theorem
equivalent to the modern statement in the calculus</p>
<p>The statement and the proof of the theorem are very different from
those with which a modern reader is familiar, for Cavalieri compared
powers of the lines in a parallelogram parallel to the base with the
corresponding powers of lines in either of the two triangles into which
a diagonal divides the parallelogram. Let the parallelogram AFDC be
divided into two triangles by the diagonal CF (Fig. 15.2) and let HE be
an indivisible of triangle CDF that is parallel to the base CD. Then, on
taking BC = FE and drawing BM parallel to CD, it is easy to show that
the indivisible BM in triangle ACF will be equal to HE. Hence, one can
pair all of the indivisibles of triangle CDF with equal indivisibles in
triangle ACF, and, therefore, the two triangles are equal. Inasmuch as
the parallelogram is the sum of the indivisibles in the two triangles,
it is clear that the sum of the first powers of the lines in one of the
constituent triangles is half of the sum of the first powers of the
lines in the parallelogram; in other words,</p>
<p>FIG. 15.2</p>
<p>Through a similar but considerably more involved argument, Cavalieri
showed that the sum of the squares of the lines in the triangle is
one-third the sum of the squares of the lines in the parallelogram. For
the cubes of the lines, he found the ratio to be 1/4. Later he carried
the proof to higher powers, finally asserting, in Exercitationes
Geometricae Sex (Six Geometrical Exercises) of 1647, the important
generalization that for the nth powers, the ratio will be 1/(n + 1).
This was known at the same time to French mathematicians, but Cavalieri
was first to publish this theorem—one that was to open the way to many
algorithms in the calculus. Geometrica Indivisibilibus, which so greatly
facilitated the problem of quadratures, appeared again in a second
edition in 1653, but by that time, mathematicians had achieved
remarkable results in new directions that outmoded Cavalieri’s laborious
geometric approach.</p>
<p>The most significant theorem by far in Cavalieri’s work was his
equivalent of</p>
<p>but another contribution would also lead to important results. The
spiral r = aθ and the parabola x2 = ay had been known since antiquity
without anyone’s having previously noted a relationship between them,
until Cavalieri thought of comparing straight-line indivisibles with
curvilinear indivisibles. If, for example, one were to twist the
parabola x2 = ay (Fig. 15.3) around like a watch spring so that vertex O
remains fixed while point P becomes point P′, then the ordinates of the
parabola can be thought of as transformed into radius vectors through
the relationships x = r and y = rθ between what we now call rectangular
and polar coordinates. The points on the Apollonian parabola x2 = ay
then will lie on the Archimedean spiral r = aθ. Cavalieri noted further
that if PP′ is taken equal to the circumference of the circle of radius
OP′, the area within the first turn of the spiral is exactly equal to
the area between the parabolic arc OP and the radius vector OP. Here we
see work that amounts to analytic geometry and the calculus, yet
Cavalieri was writing before either of these subjects had been formally
invented. As in other parts of the history of mathematics, we see that
great milestones do not appear suddenly but are merely the more
clear-cut formulations along the thorny path of uneven development.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.3</p>
<p>Evangelista Torricelli</p>
<p>The year 1647 in which Cavalieri died also marked the death of
another disciple of Galileo’s, the young Evangelista Torricelli
(1608–1647). But in many ways, Torricelli represented the new generation
of mathematicians that was building rapidly on the infinitesimal
foundation that Cavalieri had sketched all too vaguely. Had Torricelli
not died so prematurely, Italy might have continued to share the lead in
new developments; as it turned out, France was the undisputed
mathematical center during the second third of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>Torricelli was trained in mathematics at several Jesuit institutions
before studying with Benedetto Castelli, whose secretary he was for six
years. He became interested in the cycloid, possibly on the suggestion
of Marin Mersenne, perhaps through Galileo, whom Torricelli, like
Mersenne, greatly admired. He had brought himself to Galileo’s attention
while handling Castelli’s correspondence. In 1643, Torricelli sent
Mersenne the quadrature of the cycloid, and in 1644, he published a work
with the title De Dimensione Parabolae, to which he appended both the
quadrature of the cycloid and the construction of the tangent.
Torricelli made no mention of the fact that Gilles Persone de Roberval
had arrived at these results before him, and so in 1646, Roberval wrote
a letter accusing Torricelli of plagiarism from him and from Pierre de
Fermat (on maxima and minima). It is clear now that priority of
discovery belongs to Roberval, but priority in publication goes to
Torricelli, who probably rediscovered the area and the tangent
independently. Torricelli gave two quadratures, one making use of
Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles and the other of the ancient “method
of exhaustion.” For finding the tangent of the curve, he employed a
composition of motions reminiscent of Archimedes’ tangent to his
spiral.</p>
<p>The idea of the composition of movements was not original with either
Torricelli or Roberval, for Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, and others
had used it. Torricelli may have derived the idea from any one of these
men. Both Torricelli and Roberval applied the kinematic method to other
curves as well. A point on the parabola, for example, moves away from
the focus at the same rate at which it moves away from the directrix;
hence, the tangent will be the bisector of the angle between lines in
these two directions. Torricelli also made use of Fermat’s method of
tangents for the higher parabolas and extended Cavalieri’s comparison of
the parabola and the spiral by considering arc length, as well as area.
In the 1640s, they showed that the length of the first rotation of the
spiral r = aθ is equal to the length of the parabola x2 = 2ay from x = 0
to x = 2πa. Fermat, ever one to seek generalizations, introduced the
higher spirals rn = aθ and compared the arcs of these with the lengths
of his higher parabolas xn−1 = 2ay. Torricelli studied spirals of
various kinds, discovering the rectification of the logarithmic
spiral.</p>
<p>Problems involving infinitesimals were by far the most popular at the
time, and Torricelli in particular delighted in these. In the De
Dimensione Parabolae, for instance, Torricelli gave twenty-one different
proofs of the quadrature of the parabola, using approaches about evenly
divided between the use of indivisibles and the “method of exhaustion.”
One in the first category is almost identical with the mechanical
quadrature given by Archimedes in his Method, presumably not then
extant. As might be anticipated, one in the second category is virtually
that given in Archimedes’ treatise On the Quadrature of the Parabola,
extant and well known at the time. Had Torricelli arithmetized his
procedures in this connection, he would have been very close to the
modern limit concept, but he remained under the heavily geometric
influence of Cavalieri and his other Italian contemporaries.
Nevertheless, Torricelli far outdid them in the flexible use of
indivisibles to achieve new discoveries.</p>
<p>One novel result of 1641 that greatly pleased Torricelli was his
proof that if an infinite area, such as that bounded by the hyperbola xy
= a2, an ordinate x − b, and the axis of abscissas, is revolved about
the x-axis, the volume of the solid generated may be finite. Torricelli
believed that he was first to discover that a figure with infinite
dimensions can have a finite magnitude, but in this respect, he may have
been anticipated by Fermat’s work on the areas under the higher
hyperbolas or possibly by Roberval and certainly by Oresme in the
fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Among the problems that Torricelli handled just before his premature
death in 1647 was one in which he sketched the curve whose equation we
should write as x = log y, perhaps the first graph of a logarithmic
function, thirty years after the death of the discoverer of logarithms
as a computational device. Torricelli found the area bounded by the
curve, its asymptote, and an ordinate, as well as the volume of the
solid obtained on revolving the area about the x-axis.</p>
<p>Torricelli was one of the most promising mathematicians of the
seventeenth century, which is often referred to as the century of
genius. Mersenne had made the work of Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval
known in Italy, both through correspondence with Galileo dating from
1635 and during a pilgrimage to Rome in 1644. Torricelli promptly
mastered the new methods, although he always favored the geometric over
the algebraic approach. Torricelli’s brief association with the blind
and aged Galileo in 1641–1642 had also aroused in the younger man an
interest in physical science, and today he is probably better recalled
as the inventor of the barometer than as a mathematician. He studied the
parabolic paths of projectiles fired from a point with fixed initial
speeds but with varying angles of elevation and found that the envelope
of the parabolas is another parabola. In going from an equation for
distance in terms of time to that for speed as a function of time, and
inversely, Torricelli saw the inverse character of quadrature and
tangent problems. Had he enjoyed the normal span of years, it is
possible that he would have become the inventor of the calculus, but a
cruel malady cut short his life in Florence only a few days after his
thirty-ninth birthday.</p>
<p>Mersenne’s Communicants</p>
<p>France was the undisputed mathematical center during the second third
of the seventeenth century. The leading figures were René Descartes
(1596–1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665), but three other
contemporary Frenchmen also made important contributions: Gilles Persone
de Roberval (1602–1675), Girard Desargues (1591–1661), and Blaise Pascal
(1623–1662). The rest of this chapter focuses attention on these men. A
second focal point is provided by the generation following Descartes,
whose members, active in the Low Countries, produced some of the high
points of Cartesian mathematics.</p>
<p>No professional mathematical organizations yet existed, but in Italy,
France, and England, there were loosely organized scientific groups: the
Accademia dei Lincei (to which Galileo belonged) and the Accademia del
Cimento in Italy, the Cabinet DuPuy in France, and the Invisible College
in England. There was in addition an individual who, during the period
we are now considering, served through correspondence as a clearing
house for mathematical information. This was the Minimite friar Marin
Mersenne (1588–1648), a close friend of Descartes’ and Fermat’s, as of
many another mathematician of the time. Had Mersenne lived a century
earlier, the delay in information concerning the solution of the cubic
might not have occurred, for when Mersenne knew something, the whole of
the “Republic of Letters” was shortly informed about it.</p>
<p>René Descartes</p>
<p>Descartes was born in La Haye and received a thorough education at
the Jesuit college at La Flèche, where the textbooks of Clavius were
fundamental. Later he took a degree at Poitiers, where he had studied
law, without much enthusiasm. For a number of years, he traveled about
in conjunction with various military campaigns, first in Holland with
Maurice, Prince of Nassau; then with Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria; and
later still with the French army at the siege of La Rochelle. Descartes
was not really a professional soldier, and his brief periods of service
in connection with campaigns were separated by intervals of independent
travel and study, during which he met some of the leading scholars in
various parts of Europe. In Paris, he met Mersenne and a circle of
scientists who freely discussed criticisms of Peripatetic thought; from
such stimulation, Descartes went on to become the “father of modern
philosophy,” to present a changed scientific worldview, and to establish
a new branch of mathematics. In his most celebrated treatise, the
Discours de la méthode pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher la
vérité dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method of Reasoning Well and
Seeking Truth in the Sciences) of 1637, he announced his program for
philosophical research. In this he hoped, through systematic doubt, to
reach clear and distinct ideas from which it would then be possible to
deduce innumerably many valid conclusions. This approach to science led
him to assume that everything was explainable in terms of matter (or
extension) and motion. The entire universe, he postulated, was made up
of matter in ceaseless motion in vortices, and all phenomena were to be
explained mechanically in terms of forces exerted by contiguous matter.
Cartesian science enjoyed great popularity for almost a century, but it
then necessarily gave way to the mathematical reasoning of Newton.
Ironically, it was in large part the mathematics of Descartes that later
made possible the defeat of Cartesian science.</p>
<p>René Descartes</p>
<p>Invention of Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>The philosophy and the science of Descartes were almost revolutionary
in their break with the past; his mathematics, by contrast, was linked
with earlier traditions.</p>
<p>Descartes had become seriously interested in mathematics by the time
he spent the cold winter of 1619 with the Bavarian army, where he lay
abed until ten in the morning, thinking out problems. It was during this
early period in his life that he discovered the polyhedral formula that
is usually named for Leonhard Euler: v + f = e + 2, where v, f, and e
are the number of vertices, faces, and edges, respectively, of a simple
polyhedron. Nine years later, Descartes wrote to a friend in Holland
that he had made such strides in arithmetic and geometry that he had no
more to wish for. Just what the strides were is not known, for Descartes
had published nothing, but the direction of his thoughts is indicated in
a letter of 1628 to his Dutch friend, where he gave a rule for the
construction of the roots of any cubic or quartic equation by means of a
parabola. This is, of course, essentially the type of thing that
Menaechmus had done for the duplication of the cube some 2,000 years
earlier and that Omar Khayyam had carried out for cubics in general
around the year 1100.</p>
<p>Whether Descartes by 1628 was in full possession of his analytic
geometry is not clear, but the effective date for the invention of
Cartesian geometry cannot be much later than that. At this time,
Descartes left France for Holland, where he spent the next twenty years.
Three or four years after he settled down there, another Dutch friend, a
classicist, called his attention to the three-and-four-line problem of
Pappus. Under the mistaken impression that the ancients had been unable
to solve this problem, Descartes applied his new methods to it and
succeeded without difficulty. This made him aware of the power and
generality of his point of view, and he consequently wrote the
well-known work La géométrie, which made analytic geometry known to his
contemporaries.</p>
<p>Arithmetization of Geometry</p>
<p>La géométrie was not presented to the world as a separate treatise,
but as one of three appendices to the Discours de la méthode, in which
Descartes thought to give illustrations of his general philosophical
method. The other two appendices were La dioptrique, containing the
first publication of the law of refraction (discovered earlier by
Willebrord Snell), and Les météores, which included, among other things,
the first generally satisfactory quantitative explanation of the
rainbow. The original edition of the Discours was published without the
name of the author, but the authorship of the work was generally
known.</p>
<p>Cartesian geometry is now synonymous with analytic geometry, but
Descartes’ fundamental purpose was far removed from that of modern
textbooks. The theme is set by the opening sentence:</p>
<p>Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a
knowledge of the lengths of certain lines is sufficient for its
construction.</p>
<p>As this statement indicates, the goal is generally a geometric
construction and not necessarily the reduction of geometry to algebra.
The work of Descartes is far too often described simply as the
application of algebra to geometry, whereas it actually could be
characterized equally well as the translation of the algebraic
operations into the language of geometry. The very first section of La
géométrie is titled “How the Calculations of Arithmetic Are Related to
the Operations of Geometry.” The second section describes “How
Multiplication, Division, and the Extraction of Square Roots Are
Performed Geometrically.” Here Descartes was doing what had to some
extent been done from the time of al-Khwarizmi to Oughtred—furnishing a
geometric background for the algebraic operations. The five arithmetic
operations are shown to correspond to simple constructions with
straightedge and compasses, thus justifying the introduction of
arithmetic terms in geometry.</p>
<p>Descartes was more thorough in his symbolic algebra and in the
geometric interpretation of algebra than any of his predecessors. Formal
algebra had been advancing steadily since the Renaissance, and it found
its culmination in Descartes’ La géométrie, the earliest mathematical
text that a present-day student of algebra can follow without
encountering difficulties in notation. About the only archaic symbol in
the book is the use of ∞ instead of = for equality. In one essential
respect, he broke from Greek tradition, for instead of considering x2
and x3, for example, as an area and a volume, he also interpreted them
as lines. This permitted him to abandon the principle of homogeneity, at
least explicitly, and yet retain geometric meaning. Descartes could
write an expression such as a2b2 − b, for, as he expressed it, one “must
consider the quantity a2b2 divided once by unity (that is, the unit line
segment), and the quantity b multiplied twice by unity.” It is clear
that Descartes substituted homogeneity in thought for homogeneity in
form, a step that made his geometric algebra more flexible—so flexible
indeed that today we read xx as “x squared” without ever seeing a square
in our mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>Book I includes detailed instructions on the solution of quadratic
equations, not in the algebraic sense of the ancient Babylonians, but
geometrically, somewhat in the manner of the ancient Greeks. To solve
the equation z2 = az + b2, for example, Descartes proceeded as follows.
Draw a line segment LM of length b (Fig. 15.4) and at L erect a segment
NL equal to a/2 and perpendicular to LM. With center N construct a
circle of radius a/2 and draw the line through M and N intersecting the
circle at O and P. Then, z = OM is the line desired. (Descartes ignored
the root PM of the equation because it is “false,” that is, negative.)
Similar constructions are given for z2 = az − b2 and for z2 + az = b2,
the only other quadratic equations with positive roots.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.4</p>
<p>Having shown how algebraic operations, including the solution of
quadratics, are interpreted geometrically, Descartes turned to the
application of algebra to determine geometric problems, formulating far
more clearly than the Renaissance cossists the general approach:</p>
<p>If, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution
already effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful for
its construction—to those that are unknown as well as to those that are
known. Then, making no distinction between known and unknown lines, we
must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows most naturally the
relations between these lines, until we find it possible to express a
single quantity in two ways. This will constitute an equation (in a
single unknown), since the terms of the one of these two expressions are
together equal to the terms of the other.</p>
<p>Throughout Books I and III of La géométrie, Descartes is primarily
concerned with this type of geometric problem, in which the final
algebraic equation can contain only one unknown quantity. Descartes was
well aware that it was the degree of this resulting algebraic equation
that determined the geometric means by which the required geometric
construction can be carried out.</p>
<p>If it can be solved by ordinary geometry, that is, by the use of
straight lines and circles traced on a plane surface, when the last
equation shall have been entirely solved there will remain at most only
the square of an unknown quantity, equal to the product of its root by
some known quantity, increased or diminished by some other quantity also
known.</p>
<p>Here we see a clear-cut statement that what the Greeks had called
“plane problems” lead to nothing worse than a quadratic equation.
Because Viète had already shown that the duplication of the cube and the
trisection of the angle lead to cubic equations, Descartes stated, with
inadequate proof, that these cannot be solved with straightedge and
compasses. Of the three ancient problems, therefore, only the squaring
of the circle remained open to question.</p>
<p>The title La géométrie should not mislead one into thinking that the
treatise is primarily geometric. Already in the Discourse, to which the
Geometry had been appended, Descartes had discussed the relative merits
of algebra and geometry, without being partial to either. He charged the
latter with relying too heavily on diagrams that unnecessarily fatigue
the imagination, and he stigmatized the former as being a confused and
obscure art that embarrasses the mind. The aim of his method, therefore,
was twofold: (1) through algebraic procedure to free geometry from the
use of diagrams and (2) to give meaning to the operations of algebra
through geometric interpretation. Descartes was convinced that all
mathematical sciences proceed from the same basic principles, and he
decided to use the best of each branch. His procedure in La géométrie,
then, was to begin with a geometric problem, to convert it to the
language of an algebraic equation, and then, having simplified the
equation as far as possible, to solve this equation geometrically, in a
manner similar to that which he had used for the quadratics.</p>
<p>Classification of Curves</p>
<p>Descartes was much impressed by the power of his method in handling
the three- and four-line locus, so he moved on to generalizations of
this problem—a problem that runs like a thread of Ariadne through the
three books of La géométrie. He knew that Pappus had been unable to tell
anything about the loci when the number of lines was increased to six or
eight or more, so Descartes proceeded to study such cases. He was aware
that for five or six lines the locus is a cubic, for seven or eight it
is a quartic, and so on. But Descartes showed no real interest in the
shapes of these loci, for he was obsessed with the question of the means
needed to construct geometrically the ordinates corresponding to given
abscissas. For five lines, for example, he remarked triumphantly that if
they are not all parallel, then the locus is elementary in the sense
that given a value for x, the line representing y is constructible by
ruler and compass alone. If four of the lines are parallel and equal
distances a apart and the fifth is perpendicular to the others (Fig.
15.5), and if the constant of proportionality in the Pappus problem is
taken as this same constant a, then the locus is given by (a + x)(a −
x)(2a − x) = axy, a cubic that Newton later called the Cartesian
parabola or trident: x3 − 2ax2 − a2x + 2a3 = axy. This curve comes up
repeatedly in La géométrie, yet Descartes at no point gave a complete
sketch of it. His interest in the curve was threefold: (1) deriving its
equation as a Pappus locus, (2) showing its generation through the
motion of curves of lower degree, and (3) using it in turn to construct
the roots of equations of higher degree.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.5</p>
<p>Descartes considered the trident constructible by plane means alone,
inasmuch as, for each point x on the axis of abscissas, the ordinate y
can be drawn with only ruler and compass. This is not, in general,
possible for five or more lines taken at random in the Pappus problem.
In the case of not more than eight lines, the locus is a polynomial in x
and y such that for a given point on the x-axis, the construction of the
corresponding ordinate y requires the geometric solution of a cubic or
quartic equation, which, as we have seen, usually calls for the use of
conic sections. For not more than twelve lines in the Pappus problem,
the locus is a polynomial in x and y of not more than the sixth degree,
and the construction in general requires curves beyond the conic
sections. Here Descartes made an important advance beyond the Greeks in
problems of geometric constructibility. The ancients had never really
legitimized constructions that made use of curves other than straight
lines or circles, although they sometimes reluctantly recognized, as
Pappus did, the classes that they called solid problems and linear
problems. The second category in particular was a catchall class of
problems with no real standing.</p>
<p>Descartes now took the step of specifying an orthodox classification
of determinate geometric problems. Those that lead to quadratic
equations, and can therefore be constructed by lines and circles, he
placed in class one; those leading to cubic and quartic equations, the
roots of which can be constructed by means of conic sections, he placed
in class two; those leading to equations of degree five or six can be
constructed by introducing a cubic curve, such as the trident or the
higher parabola y = x3, and these he placed in class three. Descartes
continued in this manner, grouping geometric problems and algebraic
equations into classes, assuming that the construction of the roots of
an equation of degree 2n or 2n − 1 was a problem of class n.</p>
<p>The Cartesian classification by pairs of degrees seemed to be
confirmed by algebraic considerations. It was known that the solution of
the quartic was reducible to that of the resolvent cubic, and Descartes
extrapolated prematurely to assume that the solution of an equation of
degree 2n can be reduced to that of a resolvent equation of degree 2n −
1. Many years later, it was shown that Descartes’ tempting
generalization does not hold. But his work did have the salutary effect
of encouraging the relaxation of the rules on constructibility so that
higher plane curves might be used.</p>
<p>Rectification of Curves</p>
<p>It will be noted that the Cartesian classification of geometric
problems included some, but not all, of those that Pappus had lumped
together as “linear.” In introducing the new curves that he needed for
geometric constructions beyond the fourth degree, Descartes added to the
usual axioms of geometry one more axiom:</p>
<p>Two or more lines (or curves) can be moved, one upon the other,
determining by their intersection other curves.</p>
<p>This in itself is not unlike what the Greeks had actually done in
their kinematic generation of curves such as the quadratrix, the
cissoid, the conchoid, and the spiral. But whereas the ancients had
lumped these together, Descartes now carefully distinguished between
those, such as the cissoid and the conchoid, that we should call
algebraic, and others, such as the quadratrix and the spiral, that are
now known as transcendental. To the first type, Descartes gave
full-fledged geometric status, along with the line, the circle, and the
conics, calling all of these the “geometric curves”; the second type he
ruled out of geometry entirely, stigmatizing them as “mechanical
curves.” The basis on which Descartes made this decision was “exactness
of reasoning.” Mechanical curves, he said, “must be conceived of as
described by two separate movements whose relation does not admit of
exact determination”—such as the ratio of circumference to diameter of a
circle in the case of the motions describing the quadratrix and the
spiral. In other words, Descartes thought of algebraic curves as exactly
described and of transcendental curves as inexactly described, for the
latter are generally defined in terms of arc lengths. On this matter he
wrote, in La géométrie:</p>
<p>Geometry should not include lines (or curves) that are like strings,
in that they are sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the
ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and I believe
cannot be discovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based
upon such ratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact.</p>
<p>Descartes here is simply reiterating the dogma, suggested by
Aristotle and affirmed by Averroës (Ibn Rushd, 1126–1198), that no
algebraic curve can be exactly rectified. Interestingly enough, in 1638,
the year after the publication of La géométrie, Descartes ran across a
“mechanical” curve that turned out to be rectifiable. Through Mersenne,
Galileo’s representative in France, the question, raised in The Two New
Sciences, of the path of fall of an object on a rotating earth (assuming
the earth permeable) was widely discussed, and this led Descartes to the
equiangular or logarithmic spiral r = aebθ as the possible path. Had
Descartes not been so firm in his rejection of such nongeometric curves,
he might have anticipated Torricelli in discovering, in 1645, the first
modern rectification of a curve. Torricelli showed, by infinitesimal
methods that he had learned from Archimedes, Galileo, and Cavalieri,
that the total length of the logarithmic spiral from θ = 0 as it winds
backward about the pole O is exactly equal to the length of the polar
tangent PT (Fig. 15.6) at the point for which θ = 0. This striking
result did not, of course, disprove the Cartesian doctrine of the
nonrectifiability of algebraic curves. In fact, Descartes could have
asserted not only that the curve was not exactly determined, being
mechanical, but also that the arc of the curve has an asymptotic point
at the pole, which it never reaches.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.6</p>
<p>Identification of Conics</p>
<p>Virtually the whole of La géométrie is devoted to a thoroughgoing
application of algebra to geometry and of geometry to algebra, but there
is little in the treatise that resembles what usually is thought of
today as analytic geometry. There is nothing systematic about
rectangular coordinates, for oblique ordinates are usually taken for
granted; hence, there are no formulas for distance, slope, point of
division, angle between two lines, or other similar introductory
material. Moreover, in the whole of the work there is not a single new
curve plotted directly from its equation, and the author took so little
interest in curve sketching that he never fully understood the meaning
of negative coordinates. He knew in a general sort of way that negative
ordinates are directed in a sense opposite to that taken as positive,
but he never made use of negative abscissas. Moreover, the fundamental
principle of analytic geometry—the discovery that indeterminate
equations in two unknowns correspond to loci—does not appear until the
second book, and then only somewhat incidentally.</p>
<p>The solution of any one of these problems of loci is nothing more
than the finding of a point for whose complete determination one
condition is wanting. . . . In every such case an equation can be
obtained containing two unknown quantities.</p>
<p>In one case only did Descartes examine a locus in detail, and this
was in connection with the three- and four-line locus problem of Pappus,
for which Descartes derived the equation y2 = ay − bxy + cx − dx2. This
is the general equation of a conic passing through the origin; even
though the literal coefficients are understood to be positive, this is
by far the most comprehensive approach ever made to the analysis of the
family of conic sections. Descartes indicated conditions on the
coefficients for which the conic is a straight line, a parabola, an
ellipse, or a hyperbola, the analysis being in a sense equivalent to a
recognition of the characteristic of the equation of the conic. The
author knew that by a proper choice of the origin and the axes, the
simplest form of the equation is obtained, but he did not give any of
the canonical forms. The omission of much of the elementary detail made
the work exceedingly difficult for his contemporaries to follow. In
concluding remarks, Descartes sought to justify his inadequacy of
exposition by the incongruous assertion that he had left much unsaid in
order not to rob the reader of the joy of discovery.</p>
<p>Inadequate though the exposition is, it is Book II of La géometrié
that comes closest to modern views of analytic geometry. There is even a
statement of a fundamental principle of solid analytic geometry:</p>
<p>If two conditions for the determination of a point are lacking, the
locus of the point is a surface.</p>
<p>Yet, Descartes did not give any illustrations of such equations or
expand the brief hint of analytic geometry of three dimensions.</p>
<p>Normals and Tangents</p>
<p>Descartes was so fully aware of the significance of his work that he
regarded it as bearing to ancient geometry somewhat the same
relationship as the rhetoric of Cicero bears to the ABC’s of children.
His mistake, from our point of view, was in emphasizing determinate
equations, rather than indeterminate equations. He realized that all of
the properties of a curve, such as the magnitude of its area or the
direction of its tangent, are fully determined when an equation in two
unknowns is given, but he did not take full advantage of this
recognition. He wrote,</p>
<p>I shall have given here a sufficient introduction to the study of
curves when I shall have given a general method of drawing a straight
line making right angles with a curve at an arbitrarily chosen point
upon it. And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most
general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever
desired to know.</p>
<p>Descartes was quite right that the problem of finding the normal (or
the tangent) to a curve was of great importance, but the method that he
published in La géométrie was less expeditious than that which Fermat
had developed at about the same time.</p>
<p>Book II of La géométrie also contains much material on the “ovals of
Descartes,” which are very useful in optics and are obtained by
generalizing the “gardener’s method” for constructing an ellipse by
means of strings. If D1 and D2 are the distances of a variable point P
from two fixed points F1 and F2, respectively, and if m and n are
positive integers and K is any positive constant, then the locus of P
such that mD1 + nD2 = K is now known as an oval of Descartes, but the
author did not use the equations of the curves. Descartes realized that
his methods can be extended to “all those curves which can be conceived
of as generated by the regular movement of the points of a body in
three-dimensional space,” but he did not carry out any details. The
sentence with which Book II concludes, “And so I think I have omitted
nothing essential to an understanding of curved lines,” is presumptuous
indeed.</p>
<p>The third and last book of La géométrie resumes the topic of Book I:
the construction of the roots of determinate equations. Here the author
warns that in such constructions, “We should always choose with care the
simplest curve that can be used in the solution of a problem.” This
means, of course, that one must be fully aware of the nature of the
roots of the equation under consideration, and in particular one must
know whether the equation is reducible. For this reason, Book III is
virtually a course in the elementary theory of equations. It tells how
to discover rational roots, if any; how to depress the degree of the
equation when a root is known; how to increase and decrease the roots of
an equation by any amount or to multiply or divide them by a number; how
to eliminate the second term; how to determine the number of possible
“true” and “false” roots (that is, positive and negative roots) through
the well-known “Descartes’ rule of signs”; and how to find the algebraic
solution of cubic and quartic equations. In closing, the author reminds
the reader that he has given the simplest constructions possible for
problems in the various classes mentioned earlier. In particular, the
trisection of the angle and the duplication of the cube are in class
two, requiring more than circles and lines for their construction.</p>
<p>Descartes’ Geometric Concepts</p>
<p>Our account of Descartes’ analytic geometry should make clear how far
removed the author’s thought was from the practical considerations that
are now so often associated with the use of coordinates. He did not lay
down a coordinate frame to locate points as a surveyor or a geographer
might do, nor were his coordinates thought of as number pairs. In this
respect, the phrase “Cartesian product,” so often used today, is an
anachronism. La géométrie was in its day just as much a triumph of
impractical theory as was the Conics of Apollonius in antiquity, despite
the inordinately useful role that both were ultimately destined to play.
Moreover, the use of oblique coordinates was much the same in both
cases, thus confirming that the origin of modern analytic geometry lies
in antiquity, rather than in the medieval latitude of forms. The
coordinates of Oresme, which influenced Galileo, are closer, both in
motive and in appearance, to the modern point of view than are those of
Apollonius and Descartes. Even if Descartes was familiar with Oresme’s
graphical representation of functions, and this is not evident, there is
nothing in Cartesian thought to indicate that he would have seen any
similarity between the purpose of the latitude of forms and his own
classification of geometric constructions. The theory of functions
ultimately profited greatly from the work of Descartes, but the notion
of a form or a function played no apparent role in leading to Cartesian
geometry.</p>
<p>In terms of mathematical ability, Descartes was probably the most
able thinker of his day, but he was at heart not really a mathematician.
His geometry was only an episode in a life devoted to science and
philosophy, and although occasionally in later years he contributed to
mathematics through correspondence, he left no other great work in this
field. In 1649, he accepted an invitation from Queen Christina of Sweden
to instruct her in philosophy and to establish an academy of sciences in
Stockholm. Descartes had never enjoyed robust health, and the rigors of
a Scandinavian winter were too much for him; he died early in 1650.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Loci</p>
<p>If Descartes had a rival in mathematical ability, it was Fermat, but
the latter was in no sense a professional mathematician. Fermat studied
law at Toulouse, where he then served in the local parlement, first as a
lawyer and later as councilor. This meant that he was a busy man, yet he
seems to have had time to enjoy as an avocation a taste for classical
literature, science, and mathematics. The result was that by 1629, he
began to make discoveries of capital importance in mathematics. In this
year, he joined in one of the favorite sports of the time—the
“restoration” of lost works of antiquity on the basis of information
found in extant classical treatises. Fermat undertook to reconstruct the
Plane Loci of Apollonius, depending on allusions contained in the
Mathematical Collection of Pappus. A by-product of this effort was the
discovery, at least by 1636, of the fundamental principle of analytic
geometry:</p>
<p>Whenever in a final equation two unknown quantities are found, we
have a locus, the extremity of one of these describing a line, straight
or curved.</p>
<p>This profound statement, written a year before the appearance of
Descartes’ Geometry, seems to have grown out of Fermat’s application of
the analysis of Viète to the study of loci in Apollonius. In this case,
as also in that of Descartes, the use of coordinates did not arise from
practical considerations or from the medieval graphical representation
of functions. It came about through the application of Renaissance
algebra to problems from ancient geometry. Yet Fermat’s point of view
was not entirely in conformity with that of Descartes, for Fermat
emphasized the sketching of solutions of indeterminate equations,
instead of the geometric construction of the roots of determinate
algebraic equations. Moreover, where Descartes had built his Geometry
around the difficult Pappus problem, Fermat limited his exposition, in
the short treatise titled Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge
(Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci), to the simplest loci only. Where
Descartes had begun with the three- and four-line locus, using one of
the lines as an axis of abscissas, Fermat began with the linear equation
and chose an arbitrary coordinate system on which to sketch it.</p>
<p>Using the notation of Viète, Fermat first sketched the simplest case
of a linear equation—given in Latin as “D in A aequetur B in E” (that
is, Dx = By in modern symbolism). The graph is, of course, a straight
line through the origin of coordinates—or rather a half line with the
origin as end point, for Fermat, like Descartes, did not use negative
abscissas. The more general linear equation ax + by = c2 (for Fermat
retained Viète’s homogeneity) he sketched as a line segment in the first
quadrant terminated by the coordinate axes. Next, to show the power of
his method for handling loci, Fermat announced the following problem
that he had discovered by the new approach:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, in a plane, the locus of a point
such that the sum of any multiples of the segments drawn at given angles
from the point to the given lines is constant, is a straight line.</p>
<p>That is, of course, a simple corollary of the fact that the segments
are linear functions of the coordinates and of Fermat’s proposition that
every equation of the first degree represents a straight line.</p>
<p>Fermat next showed that xy = k2 is a hyperbola and that an equation
of the form xy + a2 = bx + cy can be reduced to one of the form xy = k2
(by a translation of axes). The equation x2 = y2 he considered as a
single straight line (or ray), for he operated only in the first
quadrant, and he reduced other homogeneous equations of the second
degree to this form. Then, he showed that a2 ± x2 = by is a parabola,
that x2 + y2 + 2ax + 2by = c2 is a circle, that a2 − x2 = ky2 is an
ellipse, and that a2 + x2 = ky2 is a hyperbola (for which he gave both
branches). To more general quadratic equations, in which the several
second-degree terms appear, Fermat applied a rotation of axes to reduce
them to the earlier forms. As the “crowning point” of his treatise,
Fermat considered the following proposition:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, the locus of a point such that the
sum of the squares of the segments drawn at given angles from the point
to the lines is constant, is a solid locus.</p>
<p>This proposition is obvious in terms of Fermat’s exhaustive analysis
of the various cases of quadratic equations in two unknowns. As an
appendix to the Introduction to Loci, Fermat added “The Solution of
Solid Problems by Means of Loci,” pointing out that determinate cubic
and quartic equations can be solved by conics, the theme that had loomed
so large in the geometry of Descartes.</p>
<p>Higher-Dimensional Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Fermat’s Introduction to Loci was not published during the author’s
lifetime; hence, analytic geometry in the minds of many was regarded as
the unique invention of Descartes. It is now clear that Fermat had
discovered essentially the same method well before the appearance of La
géométrie and that his work circulated in manuscript form until its
publication in 1679 in Varia opera mathematica. It is a pity that Fermat
published almost nothing during his lifetime, for his exposition was
much more systematic and didactic than that of Descartes. Moreover, his
analytic geometry was somewhat closer to ours, in that ordinates are
usually taken at right angles to the line of abscissas. Like Descartes,
Fermat was aware of an analytic geometry of more than two dimensions,
for in another connection he wrote,</p>
<p>There are certain problems which involve only one unknown, and which
can be called determinate, to distinguish them from the problems of
loci. There are certain others which involve two unknowns and which can
never be reduced to a single one; these are the problems of loci. In the
first problems we seek a unique point, in the latter a curve. But if the
proposed problem involves three unknowns, one has to find, to satisfy
the equation, not only a point or a curve, but an entire surface. In
this way surface loci arise, etc.</p>
<p>Here in the final “etc.” there is a hint of geometry of more than
three dimensions, but if Fermat really had this in mind, he did not
carry it further. Even the geometry of three dimensions had to wait
until the eighteenth century for its effective development.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Differentiations</p>
<p>It is possible that Fermat was in possession of his analytic geometry
as early as 1629, for about this time he made two significant
discoveries that are closely related to his work on loci. The more
important of these was described a few years later in a treatise, again
unpublished in his lifetime, titled Method of Finding Maxima and Minima.
Fermat had been considering loci given (in modern notation) by equations
of the form y = xn; hence, today they are often known as “parabolas of
Fermat” if n is positive or “hyperbolas of Fermat” if n is negative.
Here we have an analytic geometry of higher plane curves, but Fermat
went further. For polynomial curves of the form y = f(x), he noted a
very ingenious method of finding points at which the function takes on a
maximum or a minimum value. He compared the value of f(x) at a point
with the value f(x + E) at a neighboring point. Ordinarily, these values
will be distinctly different, but at the top or the bottom of a smooth
curve, the change will be almost imperceptible. Hence, to find maximum
and minimum points Fermat equated f(x) and f(x + E), realizing that the
values, although not exactly the same, are almost equal. The smaller the
interval E between the two points, the nearer the pseudoequality comes
to being a true equation, so Fermat, after dividing through by E, set E
= 0. The results gave him the abscissas of the maximum and the minimum
points of the polynomial. Here in essence is the process now called
differentiation, for the method of Fermat is equivalent to finding</p>
<p>and setting this equal to zero. Hence, it is appropriate to follow
Laplace in acclaiming Fermat as the discoverer of the differential
calculus, as well as a codiscoverer of analytic geometry. Fermat was not
in possession of the limit concept, but, otherwise, his method of maxima
and minima parallels that used in the calculus today.</p>
<p>During the very years in which Fermat was developing his analytic
geometry, he also discovered how to apply his neighborhood process to
find the tangent to an algebraic curve of the form y = f(x). If P is a
point on the curve y = f(x) at which the tangent is desired, and if the
coordinates of P are (a, b), then a neighboring point on the curve with
coordinates x − a + E, y = f(a + E) will lie so close to the tangent
that one can think of it as approximately on the tangent, as well as on
the curve. If, therefore, the subtangent at the point P is TQ = c (Fig.
15.7), the triangles TPQ and TP′Q′ can be taken as being virtually
similar. Hence, one has the proportion</p>
<p>FIG. 15.7</p>
<p>On cross-multiplying, canceling like terms, recalling that b = f(a),
then dividing through by E, and finally setting E = 0, the subtangent c
is readily found.</p>
<p>Fermat’s procedure amounts to saying that</p>
<p>is the slope of the curve at x = a, but Fermat did not explain his
procedure satisfactorily, saying simply that it was similar to his
method of maxima and minima. Descartes in particular, when the method
was reported to him in 1638 by Mersenne, attacked it as not generally
valid. He proposed as a challenge the curve ever since known as the
“folium of Descartes”: x3 + y3 = 3axy. That mathematicians of the time
were quite unfamiliar with negative coordinates is apparent, in that the
curve was drawn as but a single folium or “leaf” in the first
quadrant—or sometimes as a four-leaf clover, with one leaf in each
quadrant! Ultimately, Descartes grudgingly conceded the validity of
Fermat’s tangent method, but Fermat was never accorded the esteem to
which he was entitled.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Integrations</p>
<p>Fermat not only had a method for finding the tangent to curves of the
form y = xm, he also, some time after 1629, hit on a theorem on the area
under these curves—the theorem that Cavalieri published in 1635 and
1647. In finding the area, Fermat at first seems to have used formulas
for the sums of powers of the integers, or inequalities of the form</p>
<p>to establish the result for all positive integral values of m. This,
in itself, was an advance over the work of Cavalieri, who limited
himself to the cases from m = 1 to m = 9, but later Fermat developed a
better method for handling the problem, which was applicable to
fractional, as well as integral, values of m. Let the curve be y = xn,
and seek the area under the curve from x = 0 to x = a. Then Fermat
subdivided the interval from x = 0 to x = a into infinitely many
subintervals by taking the points with abscissas a, aE, aE2, aE3, . . .,
where E is a quantity less than 1. At these points, he erected ordinates
to the curve and then approximated to the area under the curve by means
of rectangles (as indicated in Fig. 15.8). The areas of the successive
approximating circumscribed rectangles, beginning with the largest, are
given by the terms in geometric progression an(a − aE), anEn(aE − aE2),
anE2n(aE2 − aE3). . . . The sum to infinity of these terms is</p>
<p>FIG. 15.8</p>
<p>As E tends toward 1—that is, as the rectangles become narrower—the
sum of the areas of the rectangles approaches the area under the curve.
On letting E = 1 in the previous formula for the sum of the rectangles,
we obtain (an+1)/(n + 1), the desired area under the curve y = xn from x
= 0 to x = a. To show that this also holds for rational fractional
values, p/q, let n = p/q. The sum of the geometric progression then
is</p>
<p>and, when E = 1, this becomes</p>
<p>If, in modern notation, we wish to obtain , it is only necessary to
observe that this is</p>
<p>For negative values of n (except n = –1) Fermat used a similar
procedure, except that E is taken as greater than 1 and tends toward 1
from above, the area found being that beneath the curve from x = a to
infinity. To find , then, it was only necessary to note that this is</p>
<p>Gregory of St. Vincent</p>
<p>For n = –1 the procedure fails, but Fermat’s older contemporary
Gregory of St. Vincent (1584–1667) disposed of this case in his Opus
Geometricum Quadraturae Circuli et Sectionum Coni (Geometrical Work on
the Squaring of the Circle and of Conic Sections). Much of this work had
been completed before the time that Fermat was working on tangents and
areas, perhaps as early as 1622–1625, although it was not published
until 1647. Gregory of St. Vincent, born in Ghent, was a Jesuit teacher
in Rome and Prague and later became a tutor at the court of Philip IV of
Spain. Through his travels, he became separated from his papers, with
the result that the appearance of the Opus Geometricum was long delayed.
In this treatise, Gregory had shown that if along the x-axis one marks
off from x = a points the intervals between which are increasing in
continued geometric proportion, and if at these points ordinates are
erected to the hyperbola xy = 1, then the areas under the curve
intercepted between successive ordinates are equal. That is, as the
abscissa increases geometrically, the area under the curve increases
arithmetically. Hence, the equivalent of was known to Gregory and his
contemporaries. Unfortunately, a faulty application of the method of
indivisibles had led Gregory of St. Vincent to believe that he had
squared the circle, an error that damaged his reputation.</p>
<p>Fermat had been concerned with many aspects of infinitesimal
analysis—tangents, quadratures, volumes, lengths of curves, centers of
gravity. He could scarcely have failed to notice that in finding
tangents to y = kxn, one multiplies the coefficient by the exponent and
lowers the exponent by 1, whereas in finding areas one raises the
exponent and divides by the new exponent. Could the inverse nature of
these two problems have escaped him? Although this seems unlikely, it
nevertheless appears that he nowhere called attention to the
relationship now known as the fundamental theorem of the calculus.</p>
<p>The inverse relationship between area and tangent problems should
have been apparent from a comparison of Gregory of St. Vincent’s area
under the hyperbola and Descartes’ analysis of inverse tangent problems
proposed through Mersenne in 1638. The problems had been set by
Florimond Debeaune (1601–1652), a jurist at Blois who was also an
accomplished mathematician, for whom even Descartes expressed
admiration. One of the problems called for the determination of a curve
whose tangent had the property now expressed by the differential
equation a dy/dx = x − y. Descartes recognized the solution as
nonalgebraic, but he evidently just missed seeing that logarithms were
involved.</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>Fermat’s contributions to analytic geometry and to infinitesimal
analysis were but two aspects of his work—and probably not his favorite
topics. In 1621, the Arithmetica of Diophantus had come to life again
through the Greek and Latin edition by Claude Gaspard de Bachet
(1591–1639), a member of an informal group of scientists in Paris.
Diophantus’s Arithmetica had not been unknown, for Regiomontanus had
thought of printing it; several translations had appeared in the
sixteenth century, with little result for the theory of numbers. Perhaps
the work of Diophantus was too impractical for the practitioners and too
algorithmic for the speculatively inclined, but it appealed strongly to
Fermat, who became the founder of the modern theory of numbers. Many
aspects of the subject caught his fancy, including perfect and amicable
numbers, figurate numbers, magic squares, Pythagorean triads,
divisibility, and, above all, prime numbers. He proved some of his
theorems by a method that he called his “infinite descent”—a sort of
inverted mathematical induction, a process that Fermat was among the
first to use. As an illustration of his process of infinite descent, let
us apply it to an old and familiar problem—the proof that is not
rational. Let us assume that , where al and b1 are positive integers
with a1 &gt; b1. Because</p>
<p>on replacing the first by its equal a1/b1, we have</p>
<p>In view of the inequality , it is clear that 3b1 − a1 and a1 − b1 are
positive integers, a2 and b2, each less than a1 and b1, respectively,
and such that . This reasoning can be repeated indefinitely, leading to
an infinite descent in which an and bn are ever smaller integers such
that . This implies the false conclusion that there is no smallest
positive integer. Hence, the premise that is a quotient of integers must
be false.</p>
<p>Using his method of infinite descent, Fermat was able to prove
Girard’s assertion that every prime number of the form 4n + 1 can be
written in one and only one way as the sum of two squares. He showed
that if 4n + 1 is not the sum of two squares, there is always a smaller
integer of this form that is not the sum of two squares. Using this
recursive relationship backward leads to the false conclusion that the
smallest integer of this type, 5, is not the sum of two squares (whereas
5 = 12 + 22). Hence, the general theorem is proved to be true. Because
it is easy to show that no integer of the form 4n − 1 can be the sum of
two squares and because all primes except 2 are of the form 4n + 1 or 4n
− 1, by Fermat’s theorem one can easily classify prime numbers into
those that are and those that are not the sum of two squares. The prime
23, for example, cannot be so divided, whereas the prime 29 can be
written as 22 + 52. Fermat knew that a prime of either form can be
expressed as the difference of two squares in one and only one way.</p>
<p>The Theorems of Fermat</p>
<p>Fermat used his method of infinite descent to prove that there is no
cube that is divisible into two cubes—that is, that there are no
positive integers x, y, and z such that x3 + y3 = z3. Going further,
Fermat stated the general proposition that for n, an integer greater
than 2, there are no positive integral values x, y, and z such that xn +
yn = zn. He wrote in the margin of his copy of Bachet’s Diophantus that
he had a truly marvelous proof of this celebrated theorem, which has
since become known as Fermat’s “last,” or “great,” theorem. Fermat, most
unfortunately, did not give his proof but only described it as one
“which this margin is too narrow to contain.” If Fermat did indeed have
such a proof, it has remained lost to this day. Despite all efforts to
find a proof, once stimulated by a pre–World War I prize offer of
100,000 marks for a solution, the problem remained unsolved until the
1990s. Yet the search for solutions has led to even more good
mathematics than that which in antiquity resulted from efforts to solve
the three classical and unsolvable geometric problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps two millennia before Fermat’s day, there had been a “Chinese
hypothesis” that held that n is prime if and only if 2n − 2 is divisible
by n, where n is an integer greater than 1. Half of this conjecture is
now known to be false, for 2341 − 2 is divisible by 341, And 341 = 11 ·
31 is composite, but the other half is indeed valid, and Fermat’s
“lesser” theorem is a generalization of this. A consideration of many
cases of numbers of the form ap–1− 1, including 236 − 1, suggested that
whenever p is prime and a is prime to p, then ap–l− 1 is divisible by
p. On the basis of an induction from only five cases (n = 0, 1, 2, 3,
and 4), Fermat formulated a second conjecture—that integers of the form
, now known as “Fermat numbers,” are always prime. A century later,
Euler showed this conjecture to be false, for is composite. In fact, it
is now known that is not prime for numerous ns above 5, and we begin to
wonder whether there is even one more prime Fermat number beyond those
that Fermat knew.</p>
<p>Fermat’s lesser theorem fared better than his conjecture on prime
Fermat numbers. A proof of the theorem was left in manuscript by
Leibniz, and another elegant and elementary demonstration was published
by Euler in 1736. The proof by Euler makes ingenious use of mathematical
induction, a device with which Fermat, as well as Pascal, was quite
familiar. In fact, mathematical induction, or reasoning by recurrence,
is sometimes referred to as “Fermatian induction,” to distinguish it
from scientific, or “Baconian,” induction.</p>
<p>Fermat was truly “the prince of amateurs” in mathematics. No
professional mathematician of his day made greater discoveries or
contributed more to the subject, yet Fermat was so modest that he
published virtually nothing. He was content to write of his thoughts to
Mersenne (whose name, incidentally, is preserved in connection with the
“Mersenne numbers,” that is, primes of the form 2p − 1) and thus lost
priority credit for much of his work. In this respect, he shared the
fate of one of his most capable friends and contemporaries—the unamiable
professor Roberval, a member of the “Mersenne group” and the only truly
professional mathematician among the Frenchmen whom we discuss in this
chapter.</p>
<p>Gilles Persone de Roberval</p>
<p>Appointment to the chair of Ramus at the Collège Royal, which
Roberval held for some forty years, was determined every three years on
the basis of a competitive examination, the questions for which were set
by the incumbent. In 1634, Roberval won the contest, probably because he
had developed a method of indivisibles similar to that of Cavalieri; by
not disclosing his method to others, he successfully retained his
position in the chair until his death in 1675. This meant, however, that
he lost credit for most of his discoveries and that he became embroiled
in numerous quarrels with respect to priority. The bitterest of these
controversies concerned the cycloid, to which the phrase “the Helen of
geometers” came to be applied because of the frequency with which it
provoked quarrels during the seventeenth century. In 1615, Mersenne had
called mathematicians’ attention to the cycloid, perhaps having heard of
the curve through Galileo; in 1628, when Roberval arrived in Paris,
Mersenne proposed to the young man that he study the curve. By 1634,
Roberval was able to show that the area under one arch of the curve is
exactly three times the area of the generating circle. By 1638, he had
found how to draw the tangent to the curve at any point (a problem also
solved at about the same time by Fermat and Descartes) and had found the
volumes generated when the area under an arch is revolved about the
baseline. Later still, he found the volumes generated by revolving the
area about the axis of symmetry or about the tangent at the vertex.</p>
<p>Roberval did not publish his discoveries concerning the cycloid
(which he named the “trochoid,” from the Greek word for “wheel”), for he
may have wished to set similar questions for prospective candidates for
his chair. As noted previously, this gave Torricelli the priority of
publication. Roberval thought of a point P on the cycloid as subject to
two equal motions, one a motion of translation, the other a rotary
motion. As the generating circle rolls along the baseline AB (Fig.
15.9), P is carried horizontally, at the same time rotating about O, the
center of the circle. Through P, one therefore draws a horizontal line
PS, for the motion of translation, and a line PR tangent to the
generating circle, for the rotary component. Inasmuch as the motion of
translation is equal to that of rotation, the bisector PT of the angle
SPR is the required tangent to the cycloid.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.9</p>
<p>Among Roberval’s other contributions was the first sketch, in 1635,
of half of an arch of a sine curve. This was important as an indication
that trigonometry was gradually moving away from the computational
emphasis that had dominated thought in that branch toward a functional
approach. By means of his method of indivisibles, Roberval was able to
show the equivalent of , again indicating that area problems tended at
that time to be easier to handle than tangent questions.</p>
<p>Girard Desargues and Projective Geometry</p>
<p>The great developments in mathematics during the days of Descartes
and Fermat were in analytic geometry and infinitesimal analysis. It is
likely that the very success in these branches made men of the time
relatively oblivious to other aspects of mathematics. We already have
seen that Fermat found no one to share his fascination with the theory
of numbers; pure geometry likewise suffered a wholly undeserved neglect
in the same period. The Conics of Apollonius had once been among
Fermat’s favorite works, but analytic methods redirected his views.
Meanwhile, the Conics had attracted the attention of a practical man
with a very impractical imagination—Girard Desargues, an architect and a
military engineer of Lyons. For some years, Desargues had been in Paris,
where he was part of the group of mathematicians that we have been
considering, but his very unorthodox views on the role of perspective in
architecture and geometry met with little favor, and he returned to
Lyons to work out his new type of mathematics largely by himself. The
result was one of the most unsuccessful great books ever produced. Even
the ponderous title repelled—Brouillon projet d’une atteinte aux
événemens des rencontres d’un cone avec un plan (Paris, 1639). This may
be translated as Rough Draft of an Attempt to Deal with the Outcome of a
Meeting of a Cone with a Plane, the prolixity of which stands in sharp
contrast to the brevity and simplicity of Apollonius’s title Conics. The
thought on which Desargues’ work is based, nevertheless, is simplicity
itself—a thought derived from perspective in Renaissance art and from
Kepler’s principle of continuity. Everyone knows that a circle, when
viewed obliquely, looks like an ellipse or that the outline of the
shadow of a lampshade will be a circle or a hyperbola according as it is
projected on the ceiling or a wall. Shapes and sizes change according to
the plane of incidence that cuts the cone of visual rays or of light
rays, but certain properties remain the same throughout such changes,
and it is these properties that Desargues studied. For one thing, a
conic section remains a conic section no matter how many times it
undergoes a projection. The conics form a single close-knit family, as
Kepler had suggested for somewhat different reasons. But in accepting
this view, Desargues had to assume, with Kepler, that the parabola has a
focus “at infinity” and that parallel lines meet at “a point at
infinity.” The theory of perspective makes such ideas plausible, for
light from the sun is ordinarily considered to be made up of rays that
are parallel—composing a cylinder or a parallel pencil of rays—whereas
rays from a terrestrial light source are treated as a cone or a point
pencil.</p>
<p>Desargues’ treatment of the conics is beautiful, although his
language is unconventional. He called a conic section a “coup de
rouleau” (i.e., incidence with a rolling pin). About the only one of his
many new terms that has survived is the word “involution”—that is, pairs
of points on a line the product of whose distances from a fixed point is
a given constant. He called points in harmonic division a four-point
involution, and he showed that this configuration is projectively
invariant, a result known, under a different point of view, to Pappus.
Because of its harmonic properties, the complete quadrangle played a
large role in Desargues’ treatment, for he knew that when such a
quadrangle (as ABCD in Fig. 15.10) is inscribed in a conic, the line
through two of the diagonal points (E, F, and G in Fig. 15.10) is the
polar line, with respect to the conic, of the third diagonal point. He
knew, of course, that the intersections with the conic of the polar of a
point with respect to the conic were the points of contact of the
tangents from the point to the conic, and instead of defining a diameter
metrically, Desargues introduced it as the polar of a point at infinity.
There is a pleasing unity in Desargues’ treatment of the conics through
projective methods, but it was too thorough a break with the past to
meet with acceptance.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.10</p>
<p>Desargues’ projective geometry had a tremendous advantage in
generality over the metric geometry of Apollonius, Descartes, and
Fermat, for many special cases of a theorem blend into one all-inclusive
statement. Yet mathematicians of the time not only failed to accept the
methods of the new geometry, they actively opposed them as dangerous and
unsound. So rare were copies of Desargues’ Brouillon projet that by the
end of the century, all copies had disappeared, for Desargues published
his works not to sell but to distribute to friends. The work was
completely lost until in 1847, a handwritten copy made by Philippe de
Lahire, one of Desargues’ few admirers, was found in a Paris library.
Even today, the name of Desargues is familiar not as that of the author
of the Brouillon projet but for a proposition that does not appear in
the book, the famous theorem of Desargues:</p>
<p>If two triangles are so situated that lines joining pairs of
corresponding vertices are concurrent, then the points of intersection
of pairs of corresponding sides are collinear, and conversely.</p>
<p>This theorem, which holds for either two or three dimensions, was
first published in 1648 by Desargues’ devoted friend and follower
Abraham Bosse (1602–1676), an engraver. It appears in a book with the
title Manière universelle de S. Desargues, pour pratiquer la
perspective. The theorem, which Bosse explicitly attributed to
Desargues, became, in the nineteenth century, one of the fundamental
propositions of projective geometry. Note that whereas in three
dimensions the theorem is an easy consequence of incidence axioms, the
proof for two dimensions requires an additional assumption.</p>
<p>Blaise Pascal</p>
<p>Desargues was the prophet of projective geometry, but he went without
honor in his day, largely because his most promising disciple, Blaise
Pascal, abandoned mathematics for theology. Pascal was a mathematical
prodigy. His father, too, was mathematically inclined, and the “limaçon
of Pascal” is named for the father, Étienne, rather than for the son,
Blaise. The limaçon r = a + b cos θ had been known to Jordanus
Nemorarius and possibly to the ancients as “the conchoid of the circle,”
but Étienne Pascal studied the curve so thoroughly that on the
suggestion of Roberval, it has ever since borne his name.</p>
<p>When he was fourteen, Blaise joined with his father in the informal
meetings of the Mersenne Academy at Paris. Here he became familiar with
the ideas of Desargues; two years later, in 1640, the young Pascal, then
sixteen years old, published an Essay pour les coniques. This consisted
of only a single printed page—but one of the most fruitful pages in
history. It contained the proposition described by the author as
mysterium hexagrammicum, which has ever since been known as Pascal’s
theorem. This states, in essence, that the opposite sides of a hexagon
inscribed in a conic intersect in three collinear points. Pascal did not
state the theorem in this way, for it is not true unless, as in the case
of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, one resorts to the ideal
points and line of projective geometry. Instead, he followed the special
language of Desargues, saying that if A, B, C, D, E, and F are
successive vertices of a hexagon in a conic, and if P is the
intersection point of AB and DE and Q is the point of intersection of BC
and EF (Fig. 15.11), then PQ and CD and FA are lines “of the same order”
(or, as we should say, the lines are members of a pencil, whether a
point pencil or a parallel pencil). The young Pascal went on to say that
he had deduced many corollaries from this theorem, including the
construction of the tangent to a conic at a point on the conic. The
inspiration for the little Essay was candidly admitted, for, after
citing a theorem of Desargues, the young author wrote, “I should like to
say that I owe the little that I have found on this subject to his
writings.”</p>
<p>FIG. 15.11</p>
<p>The Essay was an auspicious opening for a mathematical career, but
Pascal’s mathematical interests were chameleonlike. He next turned, when
he was about eighteen, to plans for an adding machine, and within a few
years, he had built and sold some fifty machines (see the illustration
on page 293, chapter 14). Then, in 1648, Pascal became interested in
hydrostatics, and the results were the celebrated Puy-de-Dôme experiment
confirming the weight of the air and the experiments on fluid pressure
that clarified the hydrostatic paradox. In 1654, he returned again to
mathematics and worked on two unrelated projects. One of these was to be
a Complete Work on Conics, evidently a continuation of the little Essay
he had published when sixteen, but this larger work on conics was never
printed and is not now extant. Leibniz saw a manuscript copy, and the
notes that he took are now all that we have of Pascal’s larger work on
conics. (Only two copies of the smaller work have survived.) According
to Leibniz’s notes, the Complete Work on Conics contained a section on
the familiar three- and four-line locus and a section on the magna
problema—to place a given conic on a given cone of revolution.</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>While Pascal in 1654 was working on his Conics, his friend the
Chevalier de Méré raised with him questions such as the following: In
eight throws of a die, a player is to attempt to throw a 1, but after
three unsuccessful trials, the game is interrupted. How should he be
indemnified? Pascal wrote to Fermat on this, and their resulting
correspondence became the effective starting point for the modern theory
of probability, the thoughts of Cardan of a century earlier having been
overlooked. Although neither Pascal nor Fermat wrote up their results,
Christiaan Huygens in 1657 published a little tract, De ratiociniis in
ludo aleae (On Reasoning in Games of Dice), that was prompted by the
correspondence of the Frenchmen. Pascal, meanwhile, had connected the
study of probability with the arithmetic triangle, carrying the
discussion so far beyond the work of Cardan that the triangular
arrangement has ever since been known as Pascal’s triangle. The triangle
itself was more than 600 years old, but Pascal disclosed some new
properties, such as the following:</p>
<p>In every arithmetic triangle, if two cells are contiguous in the same
base, the upper is to the lower as the number of cells from the upper to
the top of the base is to the number of those from the lower to the
bottom inclusive.</p>
<p>(Pascal called positions in the same vertical column, in Fig. 15.12,
“cells of the same perpendicular rank,” and those in the same horizontal
row “cells of the same parallel rank”; cells in the same upward-sloping
diagonal he called “cells of the same base.”) The method of proof of
this property is of more significance than the property itself, for here
in 1654 Pascal gave an eminently clear-cut explanation of the method of
mathematical induction.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.12</p>
<p>Fermat hoped to interest Pascal in the theory of numbers, and in
1654, he sent him a statement of one of his most beautiful theorems
(unproved until the nineteenth century):</p>
<p>Every integer is composed of one, two, or three triangular numbers,
of one, two, three, or four squares, of one, two, three, four, or five
pentagons, of one, two, three, four, five, or six hexagons, and thus to
infinity.</p>
<p>Pascal, however, was a mathematical dilettante, as well as a
virtuoso, and did not pursue this problem.</p>
<p>The Cycloid</p>
<p>On the night of November 23, 1654, from ten thirty to about twelve
thirty, Pascal experienced a religious ecstasy that caused him to
abandon science and mathematics for theology. The result was the writing
of the Lettres provinciales and the Pensées; for only one brief period,
in 1658–1659, did Pascal return to mathematics. One night in 1658,
toothache or illness prevented him from falling asleep, and as a
distraction from the pain, he turned to the study of the cycloid.
Miraculously, the pain eased, and Pascal took this as a sign from God
that the study of mathematics was not displeasing to Him. Having found
certain areas, volumes, and centers of gravity associated with the
cycloid, Pascal proposed half a dozen such questions to the
mathematicians of his day, offering first and second prizes for their
solution—and naming Roberval as one of the judges. Publicity and timing
were so poor that only two sets of solutions were submitted, and these
contained at least some errors in computation. Pascal therefore awarded
no prize, but he did publish his own solutions, along with other
results, all preceded by a Histoire de la roulette (the name usually
used for the curve in France), in a series of Lettres de A. Dettonville
(1658–1659). (The name Amos Dettonville was an anagram of Louis de
Montalte, the pseudonym used in the Lettres provinciales.) The contest
questions and the Lettres de A. Dettonville brought interest in the
cycloid to a focus, but they also stirred up a hornets’ nest of
controversy. The two finalists, Antoine de Lalouvère and John Wallis,
both capable mathematicians, were disgruntled that prizes were withheld,
and the Italian mathematicians were indignant that Pascal’s History of
the Cycloid gave virtually no credit to Torricelli, priority in
discovery being conceded only to Roberval.</p>
<p>Pascal’s triangle in Japan. From Murai Chuzen’s Sampo Doshimon
(1781), also showing the sangi forms of the numerals.</p>
<p>Much of the material in the Lettres de A. Dettonville, such as the
equality of the arcs of spirals and parabolas, as well as the cycloid
contest questions, had been known to Roberval and Torricelli, but some
of this appeared in print for the first time. Among the new results was
the equality of the arc length of an arch of the generalized cycloid x =
aKϕ − a sinϕ, y = a − acos ϕ and the semicircumference of the ellipse x
= 2a(1 + K) cosϕ, y = 2a(l − K) sinϕ. The theorem was expressed
rhetorically, rather than symbolically, and it was demonstrated in an
essentially Archimedean manner, as were most of Pascal’s demonstrations
in 1658–1659.</p>
<p>In connection with an integration of the sine function in his 1658
Traité des sinus du quart de cercle (Treatise on the Sines of a Quadrant
of a Circle), Pascal came remarkably close to a discovery of the
calculus—so close that Leibniz later wrote that it was on reading this
work by Pascal that a light suddenly burst on him. Had Pascal not died,
like Torricelli, shortly after his thirty-ninth birthday, or had he been
more single-mindedly the mathematician or had he been more attracted by
algorithmic methods than by geometry and speculations on the philosophy
of mathematics, there is little doubt that he would have anticipated
Newton and Leibniz in their greatest discovery.</p>
<p>Philippe de Lahire</p>
<p>With the death of Desargues in 1661, of Pascal in 1662, and of Fermat
in 1665, a great period in French mathematics came to a close. It is
true that Roberval lived about another decade, but his contributions
were no longer significant, and his influence was limited by his refusal
to publish. About the only mathematician of stature in France at the
time was Philippe de Lahire (1640–1718), a disciple of Desargues and,
like his master, an architect. Pure geometry obviously appealed to him,
and his first work on conics in 1673 was synthetic, but he did not break
with the analytic wave of the future. Lahire kept an eye out for a
patron; hence, in his Nouveaux élémens des sections coniques of 1679,
dedicated to Jean Baptiste Colbert, the methods of Descartes came to the
fore. The approach is metric and two-dimensional, proceeding, in the
case of the ellipse and the hyperbola, from the definitions in terms of
the sum and the difference of focal radii and, in the case of the
parabola, from the equality of distances to focus and directrix. But
Lahire carried over into analytic geometry some of Desargues’ language.
Of his analytic language, only the term “origin” has survived. Perhaps
it was because of his terminology that contemporaries did not give
proper weight to a significant point in his Nouveaux élémens—Lahire
provided one of the first examples of a surface given analytically
through an equation in three unknowns, which was the first real step
toward solid analytic geometry. He, like Fermat and Descartes, had only
a single reference point or origin O on a single line of reference or
axis OB, to which he now added the reference or coordinate plane OBA
(Fig. 15.13). Lahire found that then the equation of the locus of a
point P such that its perpendicular distance PB from the axis shall
exceed the distance OB (the abscissa of P) by a fixed quantity a, with
respect to his coordinate system, is a2 + 2ax + x2 = y2 + v2 (where v is
the coordinate that is now generally designated by z). The locus is, of
course, a cone.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.13</p>
<p>In 1685, Lahire returned to synthetic methods in a book with the
simple title Sectiones Conicae. This might be described as a version by
Lahire of the Greek Conics of Apollonius translated into Latin from the
French language of Desargues. The harmonic properties of the complete
quadrangle, poles and polars, tangents and normals, and conjugate
diameters are among the familiar topics treated from a projective point
of view.</p>
<p>Today, Lahire’s name is attached not to anything in his synthetic or
analytic treatises on conics, but to a theorem from a paper of 1706 on
“roulettes” in the Mémoires of the Académie des Sciences. Here he showed
that if a smaller circle rolls without slipping along the inside of a
larger circle with a diameter twice as great, then (1) the locus of a
point on the circumference of the smaller circle is a line segment (a
diameter of the larger circle), and (2) the locus of a point that is not
on the circumference but that is fixed with respect to the smaller
circle is an ellipse. As we have seen, the first part of this theorem
was known to al-Tusi (Nasir Eddin) and the second to Copernicus. The
name of Lahire deserves to be remembered, but it is a pity that it
should be attached to a theorem that he was not first to discover.</p>
<p>Georg Mohr</p>
<p>Lahire was not the only geometer of the time to be unappreciated. In
1672, the Danish mathematician Georg Mohr (1640–1697) published an
unusual book titled Euclides danicus, in which he showed that any
pointwise construction that can be performed with compasses and
straightedge (i.e., any “plane” problem) can be carried out with
compasses alone. Despite all of the insistence by Pappus, Descartes, and
others on the principle of parsimony, many of the classical
constructions were shown by Mohr to have violated this principle through
the use of two instruments where one would suffice! Obviously, one
cannot draw a straight line with compasses, but if one regards the line
as known whenever two distinct points on it are known, then the use of a
straightedge in Euclidean geometry is superfluous. So little attention
did mathematicians of the time pay to this amazing discovery that
geometry using compasses only, without the straightedge, bears the name
not of Mohr but of Lorenzo Mascheroni, who rediscovered the principle
125 years later. Mohr’s book disappeared so thoroughly that not until
1928, when a copy was accidentally found by a mathematician browsing in
a Copenhagen bookstore, did it become known that Mascheroni had been
anticipated in proving the supererogation of the straightedge.</p>
<p>Pietro Mengoli</p>
<p>The year of Mohr’s stillborn Euclides danicus, 1672, marked the
publication in Italy of yet another work on circle-squaring, Il problema
della quadratura del circolo, by Pietro Mengoli (1625–1686), a third
unappreciated mathematician of the time. Mengoli, a clergyman, had grown
up under the influence of Cavalieri (whose successor he was at Bologna),
Torricelli, and Gregory of St. Vincent. Continuing their work on
indivisibles and the area under hyperbolas, Mengoli learned how to
handle such problems through a device the usefulness of which now began
to be apparent almost for the first time—the use of infinite series.
Mengoli saw, for example, that the sum of the alternating harmonic
series is ln2. He had rediscovered Oresme’s conclusion, arrived at by a
grouping of terms, that the ordinary harmonic series does not converge,
a theorem usually attributed to Jacques Bernoulli in 1689; he also
showed the convergence of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, a
result for which Huygens is usually given credit.</p>
<p>We have considered three unappreciated mathematicians working in the
1670s, and one reason they were not adequately recognized was that the
center of mathematics was not in their countries. France and Italy, once
the leaders, were mathematically in decline, and Denmark remained
outside the main current. During the period that we are considering—the
interval between Descartes and Fermat, on the one hand, and Newton and
Leibniz, on the other—there were two regions in particular where
mathematics was thriving: Great Britain and the Low Countries. Here we
find not isolated figures, as in France, Italy, and Denmark, but a
handful of prominent Britons and another handful of Dutch and Flemish
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Frans van Schooten</p>
<p>We have already noted that Descartes had spent a score of years in
Holland, and his mathematical influence was decisive, in that analytic
geometry took root there more quickly than elsewhere in Europe. At
Leyden in 1646, Frans van Schooten (1615–1660) had succeeded his father
as professor of mathematics, and it was chiefly through the younger Van
Schooten and his pupils that the rapid development of Cartesian geometry
took place. Descartes’ La géométrie had not originally been published in
Latin, the universal language of scholars, and the exposition had been
far from clear; both of these handicaps were overcome when Van Schooten
printed a Latin version in 1649, together with supplementary material.
Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes (Geometry by René
Descartes) appeared in a greatly expanded two-volume version in
1659–1661, and additional editions were published in 1683 and 1695.
Thus, it is probably not too much to say that although analytic geometry
was introduced by Descartes, it was established by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>The need for explanatory introductions to Cartesian geometry had been
recognized so promptly that an anonymous “Introduction” to it had been
composed but not published by a “Dutch gentleman” within a year of its
appearance. In another year, Descartes received and approved a more
extensive commentary on the Geometry, this one by Florimond Debeaune
under the title Notae Breves. The ideas of Descartes were here
explained, with greater emphasis on loci represented by simple
second-degree equations, much in the manner of Fermat’s Isagoge.
Debeaune showed, for example, that y2 = xy + bx, y2 = − 2dy + bx, and y2
= bx − x2 represent hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipses, respectively.
This work by Debeaune received wide publicity through its inclusion in
the 1649 Latin translation of the Geometria, together with further
commentary by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>Jan de Witt</p>
<p>A more extensive contribution to analytic geometry was composed in
1658 by one of Van Schooten’s associates, Jan De Witt (1629–1672), the
well-known Grand Pensionary of Holland. De Witt had studied law at
Leyden, but he had acquired a taste for mathematics while living in Van
Schooten’s house. He led a hectic life while directing the affairs of
the United Provinces through periods of war in which he opposed the
designs of Louis XIV. When in 1672 the French invaded the Netherlands,
De Witt was dismissed from office by the Orange Party and seized by an
infuriated mob that tore him to pieces. Although he had been a man of
action, he had found the time in his earlier years to compose a work
titled Elementa Curvarum. This is divided into two parts, the first of
which gives various kinematic and planimetric definitions of the conic
sections. Among these are the focus-directrix ratio definitions; our
word “directrix” is due to him. Another construction of the ellipse that
he gave is through the now familiar use of two concentric circles with
the eccentric angle as parameter. Here the treatment is largely
synthetic, but Book II, by contrast, makes such systematic use of
coordinates that it has been described, with some justification, as the
first textbook on analytic geometry. The purpose of De Witt’s work is to
reduce all second-degree equations in x and y to canonical form through
translation and rotation of axes. He knew how to recognize when such an
equation represented an ellipse, when a parabola, and when a hyperbola,
based on whether the so-called discriminant is negative, zero, or
positive.</p>
<p>Only a year before his tragic death, De Witt combined the aims of the
statesman with the views of a mathematician in his A Treatise on Life
Annuities (1671), motivated perhaps by the little essay by Huygens on
probabilities. In this Treatise, De Witt expressed what now would be
described as the notion of mathematical expectation, and in his
correspondence with Hudde, he considered the problem of an annuity based
on the last survivor of two or more people.</p>
<p>Johann Hudde</p>
<p>In 1656–1657, Van Schooten had published a work of his own,
Exercitationes Mathematicae, in which he gave new results in the
application of algebra to geometry. Included are also discoveries made
by his most capable disciples, such as Johann Hudde (1629–1704), a
patrician who served for some thirty years as burgomaster of Amsterdam.
Hudde corresponded with Huygens and De Witt on the maintenance of canals
and on problems of probability and life expectancy; in 1672, he directed
the work of inundating Holland to obstruct the advance of the French
army. In 1656, Hudde had written on the quadrature of the hyperbola by
means of infinite series, as had Mengoli, but the manuscript has been
lost. In Van Schooten’s Exercitationes, there is a section by Hudde on a
study of coordinates of a fourth-degree surface, an anticipation of
solid analytic geometry antedating even that of Lahire, although less
explicitly described. Moreover, it appears that Hudde was the first
mathematician to permit a literal coefficient in an equation to
represent any real number, whether positive or negative. This final step
in the process of generalizing the notations of Viète in the theory of
equations was made in a work by Hudde titled De Reductione Aequationum,
which also formed part of the 1659–1661 Van Schooten edition of
Descartes’ La géométrie.</p>
<p>The two most popular subjects in Hudde’s day were analytic geometry
and mathematical analysis, and the burgomaster-to-be contributed to
both. In 1657–1658, Hudde had discovered two rules that pointed clearly
toward algorithms of the calculus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If r is a double root of the polynomial equation</li>
</ol>
<p>and if b0, b1, . . . , bn−1, bn are numbers in arithmetic
progression, then r is also a root of</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>If for x = a the polynomial</li>
</ol>
<p>takes on a relative maximum or minimum value, then a is a root of the
equation:</p>
<p>The first of these “Hudde’s rules” is a camouflaged form of the
modern theorem that if r is a double root of f(x) = 0, then r is also a
root of f′(x) = 0. The second is a slight modification of Fermat’s
theorem that today appears in the form that if f(a) is a relative
maximum or minimum value of a polynomial f(x), then f′(a) = 0.</p>
<p>René François de Sluse</p>
<p>The rules of Hudde were widely known, for they were published by Van
Schooten in 1659 in Volume I of Geometria a Renato Des Cartes. A few
years earlier, a similar rule for tangents had been used by another
representative from the Low Countries, the canon René François de Sluse
(1622–1685), a native of Liège who came from a distinguished Walloon
family. He had studied in Lyons and Rome, where he may have become
familiar with the work of Italian mathematicians. Possibly through
Torricelli, perhaps independently, in 1652 Sluse arrived at a routine
for finding the tangent to a curve whose equation is of the form f(x, y)
= 0, where f is a polynomial. The rule, not published until 1673, when
it appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, may
be stated as follows: The subtangent will be the quotient obtained by
placing in the numerator all of the terms containing y, each multiplied
by the exponent of the power of y appearing in it, and placing in the
denominator all of the terms containing it, each multiplied by the
exponent of the power of x appearing in it and then divided by x. This
is, of course, equivalent to forming the quotient now written as yfy/fx,
a result also known to Hudde in about 1659. Such instances show how
discoveries in the calculus were crowding on one another even before the
work of Newton.</p>
<p>Sluse, sharing in the tradition of the Low Countries, was also quite
active in promoting Cartesian geometry, even though he preferred the A
and E of Viète and Fermat to the x and y of Descartes. In 1659, he
published a popular book, Mesolabum (Of Means), in which he pursued the
familiar topic on the geometric constructions of the roots of equations.
He showed that given any conic, one can construct the roots of any cubic
or quartic equation through the intersection of the conic and a circle.
The name of Sluse is also attached to a family of curves that he
introduced in his correspondence with Huygens and Pascal in 1657–1658.
These so-called pearls of Sluse, so named by Pascal, are curves given by
equations of the form ym = kxn(a − x)b. Sluse mistakenly thought that
such cases as y = x2(a − x) were pearl-shaped, for, negative coordinates
not then being understood, Sluse assumed symmetry with respect to the
axis (of abscissas); however, Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695), who had
the reputation of being Van Schooten’s best pupil, found the maximum and
minimum points and the point of inflection and was able to sketch the
curve correctly for both positive and negative coordinates. Other points
of inflection had also been found by several men before Huygens,
including Fermat and Roberval.</p>
<p>Christiaan Huygens</p>
<p>Christiaan Huygens, a member of a prominent Dutch family and the son
of the diplomat Constantin Huygens, was encouraged in mathematical
pursuits as a youngster by both Descartes and Mersenne, who were
associates of his father’s. Christiaan became a scientist of
international reputation, who is recalled for the principle that bears
his name in the wave theory of light, the observation of the rings of
Saturn, and the effective invention of the pendulum clock. It was in
connection with his search for improvements in horology that he made his
most important mathematical discovery.</p>
<p>Christiaan Huygens</p>
<p>The Pendulum Clock</p>
<p>Huygens knew that the oscillations of a simple pendulum are not
strictly isochronous but depend on the magnitude of the swing. To phrase
it differently, if an object is placed on the side of a smooth
hemispherical bowl and released, the time it takes to reach the lowest
point will be almost, but not quite, independent of the height from
which it is released. Now it happened that Huygens invented the pendulum
clock at just about the time of the Pascal cycloid contest, in 1658, and
it occurred to him to consider what would happen if one were to replace
the hemispherical bowl with one whose cross-section is an inverted
cycloidal arch. Huygens was delighted to find that for such a bowl, the
object will reach the lowest point in exactly the same time, no matter
what height on the inner surface of the bowl the object is released
from. The cycloid curve is truly a tautochrone—that is, on an inverted
cycloidal arch an object will slide from any point to the bottom in
exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. But a big
question remained: how does one get a pendulum to oscillate in a
cycloidal, rather than a circular, arc? Here Huygens made a further
beautiful discovery. If one suspends from a point P at the cusp between
two inverted cycloidal semiarches PQ and PR (Fig. 15.14) a pendulum the
length of which is equal to the length of one of the semiarches, the
pendulum bob will swing in an arc that is an arch of a cycloid QSR of
exactly the same size and shape as the cycloid of which arcs PQ and PR
are parts. In other words, if the pendulum of the clock oscillates
between cycloidal jaws, it will be truly isochronous.</p>
<p>FIG. 15.14</p>
<p>Diagrams from Huygens’s Horologium oscillatorium (1673). The one
labeled Fig. II shows the cycloidal jaws that caused the pendulum to
swing in a cycloidal arc.</p>
<p>Huygens made some pendulum clocks with cycloidal jaws, but he found
that in operation, they were no more accurate than those depending on
the oscillations of an ordinary simple pendulum, which are nearly
isochronous for very small swings. Yet in this investigation, Huygens
had made a discovery of capital mathematical significance: the involute
of a cycloid is a similar cycloid, or, inversely, the evolute of a
cycloid is a similar cycloid. This theorem and further results on
involutes and evolutes for other curves were proved by Huygens in an
essentially Archimedean and Fermatian manner by taking neighboring
points and noting the result when the interval vanishes. Descartes and
Fermat had used this device for normals and tangents to a curve, and now
Huygens applied it to find what we call the radius of curvature of a
plane curve. If at neighboring points P and Q on a curve (Fig. 15.15)
one finds the normals and their point of intersection I, then, as Q
approaches P along the curve, the variable point I tends toward a fixed
point O, which is called the center of curvature of the curve for the
point P, and the distance OP is known as the radius of curvature. The
locus of the centers of curvature O for points P on a given curve Ci lie
on a second curve Ce known as the evolute of C, and any curve Ci of
which Ce is the evolute is called an involute of the curve Ce. It is
clear that the envelope of the normals to Ci, will be Ce, a curve
tangent to each of the normals. In Fig. 15.14, the curve QPR is the
evolute of the curve QSR and the curve QSR is an involute of the curve
QPR. The positions of the string, as the pendulum bob swings back and
forth, are the normals to QSR and the tangents to QPR. As the pendulum
bob moves farther to one side, the string winds more and more about the
cycloidal jaw, and as the bob falls toward the lowest point S, the
string unwinds. Hence, Huygens described the cycloid QSR as ex
evolutione descripta, the cycloid QPR being the evoluta. (In French, the
terms développante and développée have since been adopted.)</p>
<p>FIG. 15.15</p>
<p>Involutes and Evolutes</p>
<p>The concepts of radius of curvature and evolute had been adumbrated
in Apollonius’s purely theoretical work on Conics, but only with
Huygens’s interest in horology did the concepts find a permanent place
in mathematics. Analytic geometry had been a product of essentially
theoretical considerations, but Huygens’s development of the idea of
curvature was prompted by practical concerns. An interplay of the two
points of view, the theoretical and the practical, often proves to be
fruitful in mathematics, as the work of Huygens aptly illustrates. His
cycloidal pendulum presented him with an obvious rectification of the
cycloid, a result that Roberval had found earlier but had not published.
The fact that the arc QS (in Fig. 15.14) is formed as the pendulum
string winds about the curve QP shows that the length of the line PS is
exactly equal to the length of the arc QP. Inasmuch as the line PS is
twice the diameter of the circle that generates the cycloid QSR, the
length of a complete arch of the cycloid must be four times the diameter
of the generating circle. The theory of involutes and evolutes similarly
led to the rectification of many other curves, and the
Peripatetic-Cartesian dogma of the nonrectifiability of algebraic curves
came more seriously into question.</p>
<p>In 1658, one of Huygens’s associates, Heinrich van Heuraet
(1633–1660?), also a protégé of Van Schooten’s, discovered that the
semicubical parabola ay2 = x3 can be rectified by Euclidean means, thus
ending the uncertainty. The disclosure appeared in 1659 as one of the
more important aspects of Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes.
This result had been reached independently a little earlier by the
Englishman William Neil (1637–1670) and was known independently a little
later to Fermat in France, constituting another striking case of virtual
simultaneity of discovery. Of all of Fermat’s discoveries in
mathematics, it was only the rectification of the semicubical parabola,
usually known as Neil’s parabola, that was published by him. The
solution appeared in 1660 as a supplement in the Veterum Geometria
Promota in Septem de Cycloide Libris (Geometry of the Ancients Promoted
in Seven Books on the Cycloid) by Antoine de Lalouvère (1600–1664), the
circle-squarer who had striven for Pascal’s prize. The rectification of
Fermat was found by comparing a small arc of a curve with the
circumscribed figure made up of tangents at the extremities of the arc.
Van Heuraet’s method was based on the rate of change in the arc,
expressed in modern notation by the equation .</p>
<p>The rectification by Neil depended on the recognition, already noted
by Wallis in Arithmetica infinitorum, that a small arc is virtually the
hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are the increments in the
abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the equivalent of the modern
formula . Neil’s rectification was published in 1659 by John Wallis in a
treatise titled Tractatus Duo, Prior de Cycloide, Posterior de Cissoide
(Two Treatises, the First on the Cycloid, the Second on the Cissoid).
This work followed by a few months the work of Pascal on the cycloid,
indicating the extent to which cycloid fever had seized mathematicians
just before the invention of the calculus.</p>
<p>Huygens’s work on involutes and evolutes was not published until
1673, when it appeared in his celebrated Horologium Oscillatorium. This
treatise on pendulum clocks is a classic that served as an introduction
to Newton’s Principia a little more than a decade later. It contained
the law of centripetal force for circular motion, Huygens’s law for
pendular motion, the principle of the conservation of kinetic energy,
and other important results in mechanics. During his entire life, he
maintained a broad interest in all things mathematical but especially in
higher plane curves. He rectified the cissoid and studied the tractrix.
Whereas Galileo had thought that the catenary was a parabola, Huygens
showed that it is a nonalgebraic curve. In 1656, he had applied
infinitesimal analysis to the conics, reducing the rectification of the
parabola to the quadrature of the hyperbola (that is, to finding a
logarithm). By the next year, Huygens had become the first one to find
the surface area of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution (the
“conoid” of Archimedes), showing that the complanation can be achieved
by elementary means.</p>
<p>Van Schooten died in 1660, the year in which the Royal Society was
founded in England, and the date can be taken as marking a new shift in
the mathematical center of the world. The Leyden group, gathered about
Van Schooten, was losing its momentum, and it suffered a further blow
when Huygens left for Paris in 1666. Meanwhile, a vigorous development
in mathematics had been taking place in Great Britain; this was further
encouraged by the formation of the Royal Society, which, granted its
charter in 1662, has run its prestigious course for 350 years.</p>
