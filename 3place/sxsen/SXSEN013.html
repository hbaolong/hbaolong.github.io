<h4 id="chapter-9-ancient-and-medieval-china">Chapter 9 Ancient and
Medieval China</h4>
<p>No one has the good method. … In this world there are no naturally
correct ways, and among methods, no solely good techniques.</p>
<p>—Ji Kang</p>
<p>The Oldest Known Texts</p>
<p>Civilizations along the Yangtze and Yellow rivers are comparable in
age with those along the Nile or between the Tigris and Euphrates, but
chronological accounts in the mathematical history of China are less
dependable than those for Egypt and Babylonia. As in the case of other
ancient civilizations, there are vestiges of early mathematical
activities in the form of counting, measuring, and weighing of objects.
Awareness of the Pythagorean theorem appears to predate the earliest
known mathematical texts. The dating of mathematical documents from
China is far from easy, however. None of the original versions of the
early classics are known to have survived. A set of texts on bamboo
strips discovered in the early 1980s sheds light on the age of some
related classics because they were found in sealed tombs dating from the
second century BCE. Estimates concerning the Zhoubi Suanjing (Chou Pei
Suan Ching), generally considered to be the oldest of the mathematical
classics, have differed by almost a thousand years. Some considered the
Zhoubi to be a good record of Chinese mathematics of about 1200 BCE, but
others placed the work in the first century before our era. It may, in
fact, represent the work of different periods. A date after 300 BCE
would appear reasonable, thus placing it near or in the period of the
Han dynasty (202 BCE). “Zhoubi” seems to refer to the use of the gnomon
in studying the circular paths of the heavens, and the book of this
title is concerned with astronomical calculations, although it includes
an introduction on the properties of the right triangle, the Pythagorean
theorem, and some work on the use of fractions. The work is cast in the
form of a dialogue between a prince and his minister concerning the
calendar; the minister tells his ruler that the art of numbers is
derived from the circle and the square, the square pertaining to the
earth and the circle belonging to the heavens.</p>
<p>The Nine Chapters</p>
<p>Almost as old as the Zhoubi and perhaps the most influential of all
Chinese mathematical books was the Jiuzhang suanshu (Chui-chang
suan-shu), or Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. This book includes
246 problems on surveying, agriculture, partnerships, engineering,
taxation, calculation, the solution of equations, and the properties of
right triangles. Whereas the Greeks of this period were composing
logically ordered and systematically expository treatises, the Chinese,
like the Babylonians and the Egyptians, had the custom of compiling sets
of specific problems.</p>
<p>In this and other Chinese works, one is struck by the juxtaposition
of exact results and approximations. Correct rules are used for the
areas of triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. The area of the circle
was found by taking three-fourths of the square on the diameter or
one-twelfth of the square of the circumference—a correct result if the
value 3 is adopted for π—but for the area of a segment of a circle, the
Nine Chapters uses the approximate results s(s + c)/2, where s is the
sagitta (that is, the radius minus the apothem) and c the chord or base
of the segment. There are problems that are solved by the rule of three;
in others, square and cube roots are found. Chapter 8 of the Nine
Chapters is significant for its solution of problems in simultaneous
linear equations, using both positive and negative numbers. The last
problem in the chapter involves four equations in five unknowns, and the
topic of indeterminate equations was to remain a favorite among
mathematicians of the Orient. The ninth and last chapter includes
problems on right-angled triangles, some of which later reappeared in
India and Europe. One of these asks for the depth of a pond 10 feet
square if a reed growing in the center and extending 1 foot above the
water just reaches the surface if drawn to the edge of the pond. Another
of these well-known problems is that of the “broken bamboo”: There is a
bamboo 10 feet high, the upper end of which being broken reaches the
ground 3 feet from the stem. Find the height of the break.</p>
<p>The Chinese were especially fond of patterns; hence, it is not
surprising that the first record (of ancient but unknown origin) of a
magic square appeared there. The square</p>
<p>was supposedly brought to man by a turtle from the River Luo in the
days of the legendary Emperor Yii, who was reputed to be a hydraulic
engineer. The concern for such patterns led the author of the Nine
Chapters to solve the system of simultaneous linear equations</p>
<p>by performing column operations on the matrix</p>
<p>The second form represented the equations 36z = 99, 5y + z = 24, and
3x + 2y + z = 39, from which the values of z, y, and x are successively
found with ease.</p>
<p>Rod Numerals</p>
<p>Had Chinese mathematics enjoyed uninterrupted continuity of
tradition, some of the striking anticipations of modern methods might
have significantly modified the development of mathematics. But Chinese
culture was seriously hampered by abrupt breaks. In 213 BCE, for
example, the Chinese emperor ordered the burning of books, an
internationally popular activity at times of political stress. Some
works obviously must have survived, either through the existence of
copies or through oral transmission, and learning did indeed persist,
with mathematical emphasis on problems of commerce and the calendar.</p>
<p>There seems to have been contact between India and China, as well as
between China and the West, but scholars differ on the extent and
direction of borrowing. The temptation to see Babylonian or Greek
influence in China, for example, is faced with the problem that the
Chinese did not make use of sexagesimal fractions. Chinese numeration
remained essentially decimal, with notations rather strikingly different
from those in other lands. In China, from early times, two schemes of
notation were in use. In one, the multiplicative principle predominated;
in the other, a form of positional notation was used. In the first of
these, there were distinct ciphers for the digits from 1 to 10 and
additional ciphers for the powers of 10, and in the written forms, the
digits in odd positions (from left to right or from bottom to top) were
multiplied by their successor. Thus, the number 678 would be written as
a 6, followed by the symbol for 100, then a 7, followed by the symbol
for 10, and finally the symbol for 8.</p>
<p>In the system of “rod numerals,” the digits from 1 to 9 appeared as ,
and the first nine multiples of 10 as . By the use of these eighteen
symbols alternately in positions from right to left, numbers as large as
desired could be represented. The number 56,789, for instance, would
appear as . As in Babylonia, a symbol for an empty position appeared
only relatively late. In a work of 1247, the number 1,405,536 is written
with a round zero symbol as . (Occasionally, as in the
fourteenth-century form of the arithmetic triangle, the vertical and
horizontal rods or strokes were interchanged.)</p>
<p>The precise age of the original rod numerals cannot be determined,
but they were certainly in use several hundred years before our era–that
is, long before the positional notation had been adopted in India. The
use of a centesimal, rather than a decimal, positional system in China
was convenient for adaptation to computations with the counting board.
Distinctive notations for neighboring powers often enabled the Chinese
to use, without confusion, a counting board with unmarked vertical
columns. Before the eighth century, the place in which a zero was
required was simply left blank. Although in texts older than 300 CE, the
numbers and multiplication tables were written out in words,
calculations actually were made with rod numerals on a counting
board.</p>
<p>The Abacus and Decimal Fractions</p>
<p>The rod numerals of about 300 BCE were not merely a notation for the
written result of a computation. Actual bamboo, ivory, or iron rods were
carried about in a bag by administrators and used as a calculating
device. Counting rods were manipulated with such dexterity that an
eleventh-century writer described them as “flying so quickly that the
eye could not follow their movement.” Cancellations probably were more
rapidly carried out with rods on a counting board than in written
calculations. So effective, in fact, was the use of the rods on a
counting board that the abacus or rigid counting frame with movable
markers on wires was not used so early as has been generally supposed.
The first clear descriptions of the modern forms, known in China as the
suan phan and in Japan as the soroban, are of the sixteenth century, but
anticipations would appear to have been in use perhaps a thousand years
earlier. The word “abacus” is probably derived from the Semitic word
“abq,” or “dust,” indicating that in other lands, as well as in China,
the device grew out of a dust or sand tray used as a counting board. It
is possible, but by no means certain, that the use of the counting board
in China antedates the European, but clear-cut and reliable dates are
not available. We have noted that in the National Museum in Athens,
there is a marble slab, dating probably from the fourth century BCE,
that appears to be a counting board. And when a century earlier
Herodotus wrote, “The Egyptians move their hand from right to left in
calculation, while the Greeks move it from left to right,” he was
probably referring to the use of some sort of counting board. Just when
such devices gave way to the abacus proper is difficult to determine,
nor can we tell whether the appearances of the abacus in China, Arabia,
and Europe were independent inventions. The Arabic abacus had ten balls
on each wire and no center bar, whereas the Chinese had five lower and
two upper counters on each wire, separated by a bar. Each of the upper
counters on a wire of the Chinese abacus is equivalent to five on the
lower wire; a number is registered by sliding the appropriate counters
against the separating bar.</p>
<p>An early printed picture of an abacus, from the Suan Fa Tongzong,
1592 (Reproduced from J. Needham 1959, Vol. 3, p. 76.)</p>
<p>No description of Chinese numeration would be complete without
reference to the use of fractions. The Chinese were familiar with
operations on common fractions, in connection with which they found
lowest common denominators. As in other contexts, they saw analogies
with the differences in the sexes, referring to the numerator as the
“son” and to the denominator as the “mother.” Emphasis on yin and yang
(opposites, especially in sex) made it easier to follow the rules for
the manipulation of fractions. More important than these, however, was
the tendency in China toward decimalization of fractions. As in
Mesopotamia, a sexagesimal metrology led to sexagesimal numeration, so
also in China adherence to the decimal idea in weights and measures
resulted in a decimal habit in the treatment of fractions that, it is
said, can be traced back as far as the fourteenth century BCE. Decimal
devices in computation were sometimes adopted to lighten manipulations
of fractions. In a first-century commentary on the Nine Chapters, for
example, we find the use of the now-familiar rules for square and cube
roots, equivalent to and , which facilitate the decimalization of root
extractions. The idea of negative numbers seems not to have occasioned
much difficulty for the Chinese because they were accustomed to
calculating with two sets of rods—a red set for positive coefficients or
numbers and a black set for negatives. Nevertheless, they did not accept
the notion that a negative number might be a solution of an
equation.</p>
<p>Values of Pi</p>
<p>The earliest Chinese mathematics is so different from that of
comparable periods in other parts of the world that the assumption of
independent development would appear to be justified. At all events, it
seems safe to say that if there was some intercommunication before 400
CE, then more mathematics came out of China than went in. For later
periods, the question becomes more difficult. The use of the value 3 for
π in early Chinese mathematics is scarcely an argument for dependence on
Mesopotamia, especially since the search for more accurate values, from
the first centuries of the Christian era, was more persistent in China
than elsewhere. Values such as 3.1547, , 92/29, and 142/45 are found,
and in the third century Liu Hui, an important commentator on the Nine
Chapters, derived the figure 3.14 by use of a regular polygon of 96
sides and the approximation 3.14159 by considering a polygon of 3,072
sides. In Liu Hui’s reworking of the Nine Chapters, there are many
problems in mensuration, including the correct determination of the
volume of a frustum of a square pyramid. For a frustum of a circular
cone, a similar formula was applied, but with a value of 3 for π.
Unusual is the rule that the volume of a tetrahedron with two opposite
edges perpendicular to each other is one-sixth the product of these two
edges and their common perpendicular. The method of false position is
used in solving linear equations, but there are also more sophisticated
results, such as the solution, through a matrix pattern, of a
Diophantine problem involving four equations in five unknown quantities.
The approximate solution of equations of higher degree seems to have
been carried out by a device similar to what we know as “Horner’s
method.” Liu Hui also included, in his work on the Nine Chapters,
numerous problems involving inaccessible towers and trees on
hillsides.</p>
<p>The Chinese fascination with the value of π reached its high point in
the work of Zu Chongzhi (Tsu Ch’ung-chih) (430–501). One of his values
was the familiar Archimedean 22/7, described by Zu Chongzhi as
“inexact”; his “accurate” value was 355/113. If one persists in seeking
possible Western influence, one can explain away this remarkably good
approximation, not equaled anywhere until the fifteenth century, by
subtracting the numerator and the denominator, respectively, of the
Archimedean value from the numerator and the denominator of the
Ptolemaic value 377/120. Yet, Zu Chongzhi went even further in his
calculations, for he gave 3.1415927 as an “excess” value and 3.1415926
as a “deficit value.” The calculations by which he arrived at these
bounds, apparently aided by his son Zu Chengzhi, were probably contained
in one of his books, since lost. In any case, his results were
remarkable for that age, and it is fitting that today a landmark on the
moon bears his name.</p>
<p>The work of Liu Hui and Zu Chongzhi represents a greater interest in
theory and proofs than known examples of earlier mathematical activity
in China; the example of the computation of π may obscure this fact
because accuracy in the value of π is more a matter of computational
stamina than of theoretical insight. The Pythagorean theorem alone
suffices to give as accurate an approximation as may be desired.
Starting with the known perimeter of a regular polygon of n sides
inscribed in a circle, the perimeter of the inscribed regular polygon of
2π sides can be calculated by two applications of the Pythagorean
theorem. Let C be a circle with center O and radius r (Figure 9.1), and
let PQ = s be a side of a regular inscribed polygon of n sides having a
known perimeter. Then, the apothem OM = u is given by ; hence, the
sagitta MR = v = r − u is known. Then, the side RQ = w of the inscribed
regular polygon of 2n sides is found from ; hence, the perimeter of this
polygon is known. The calculation, as Liu Hui saw, can be shortened by
noting that w2 = 2rv. An iteration of the procedure will result in an
ever closer approximation to the perimeter of the circle, in terms of
which π is defined.</p>
<p>FIG. 9.1</p>
<p>From the sixth to the tenth century, a group of a dozen “classics,”
covering topics in arithmetic and number theory, served as a foundation
for mathematics taught in the “School for the Sons of the State.” These
works included the early Zhoubi and Nine Chapters, as well as later,
largely derivative, textbooks such as works by Liu Hui and others. The
group of a dozen books covered topics in arithmetic and the theory of
numbers, right triangles, the computation of irregular areas and
volumes, and more.</p>
<p>Between the tenth and the thirteenth centuries, we know of no new
Chinese mathematical breakthroughs, although some major technological
innovations such as paper and the mariner’s compass appeared at this
time. Generally, we may note that Chinese mathematical problems often
appear to be more picturesque than practical, yet Chinese civilization
was responsible for a substantial number of other technological
innovations. The use of printing and gunpowder (eighth century) was
earlier in China than elsewhere and earlier also than the high-water
mark in Chinese mathematics that occurred in the thirteenth century,
during the latter part of the Sung period.</p>
<p>Thirteenth-Century Mathematics</p>
<p>The later Sung period may be regarded as a high plateau of medieval
mathematics in China. During this period, which coincides with the time
of Mongol expansion and increased interaction with Islam, numerous
mathematicians combined traditional teachings of arithmetic and
measurement with new approaches to the solution of equations of higher
degree, both determinate and indeterminate.</p>
<p>At that time, there were mathematicians working in various parts of
China, but relations between them seem to have been remote, and, as in
the case of Greek mathematics, we evidently have relatively few of the
treatises that once were available.</p>
<p>One of the mathematicians of the period was Li Zhi (1192–1279), a
mathematician of Peking who spent a long and interesting life as an
occasional administrator, hermit, scholar, and academician. He was
offered a post as a royal annalist by Kublai Khan in 1260 but politely
found an excuse to decline it. His Ceyuan Haijing (Ts’e-yuan hai-ching)
(Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements) includes 170 problems dealing
with circles inscribed within, or circumscribed without, a right
triangle and with determining the relationships between the sides and
the radii, and some of the problems lead to equations of the fourth
degree. Although he did not describe his method of solving equations,
including some of the sixth degree, it appears that it was not very
different from that used by Zhu Shijie (Chu Shih-chieh) (fl. 1280–1303)
and Horner. Others who used the Horner method were Qin Jiushao (Ch’in
Chiu-shao) (ca. 1202–ca. 1261) and Yang Hui (fl. ca. 1261–1275). The
former was an unprincipled governor and minister who acquired immense
wealth within a hundred days of assuming office. His Shushu jiuzhang
(Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections) marks the high point in Chinese
indeterminate analysis, with the invention of routines for solving
simultaneous congruences. In this work, he also found the square root of
71,824 by steps paralleling those in the Horner method. With 200 as the
first approximation to a root of x2 − 71,824 = 0, he diminished the
roots of this by 200 to obtain y2 + 400y − 31,824 = 0. For the latter
equation, he found 60 as an approximation and diminished the roots by
60, arriving at a third equation, z2 + 520z − 4,224 = 0, of which 8 is a
root. Hence, the value of x is 268. In a similar way, he solved cubic
and quartic equations.</p>
<p>The same “Horner” device was used by Yang Hui, about whose life
almost nothing is known. He was a prolific arithmetician; among his
contributions that are extant are the earliest Chinese magic squares of
order greater than three, including two each of orders four through
eight and one each of orders nine and ten.</p>
<p>Yang Hui’s works also included results in the summation of series and
the so-called Pascal triangle, things that were published and better
known through the Precious Mirror (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of
Zhu Shijie, with which the Golden Age of Chinese mathematics closed.</p>
<p>Zhu Shijie was the last and greatest of the Sung mathematicians, yet
we know little about him—not even when he was born or when he died. He
was a resident of Yanshan, near modern Peking, but he seems to have
spent some twenty years as a wandering scholar who earned his living by
teaching mathematics, even though he had the opportunity to write two
treatises. The first of these, written in 1299, was the Suanxue qimeng
(Suan-hsueh ch’i-meng) (Introduction to Mathematical Studies), a
relatively elementary work that strongly influenced Korea and Japan,
although in China it was lost until it reappeared in the nineteenth
century. Of greater historical and mathematical interest is the Siyuan
yujian (Ssu-yuan yu-chien) (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of 1303. In
the eighteenth century, this, too, disappeared in China, only to be
rediscovered in the next century. The four origins, called heaven,
earth, man, and matter, are the representations of four unknown
quantities in the same equation. The book marks the peak in the
development of Chinese algebra, for it deals with simultaneous equations
and with equations of degrees as high as fourteen. In it, the author
describes a transformation method that he calls fan fa, the elements of
which seem to have arisen much earlier than this in China, but which
generally bears the name of Horner, who lived half a millennium later.
In solving the equation x2 + 252x − 5,292 = 0, for example, Zhu Shijie
first obtained x = 19 as an approximation (a root lies between x = 19
and x = 20) and then used the fan fa, in this case the transformation y
= x − 19, to obtain the equation y2 + 290y − 143 = 0 (with a root
between y = 0 and y = 1). He then gave the root of the latter as
(approximately) y = 143/(1 + 290); hence, the corresponding value of x
is . For the equation x3 − 574 = 0, he used y = x − 8 to obtain y3 +
24y2 + 192y − 62 = 0, and he gave the root as x = 8 + 62/(1 + 24 + 192)
or x = . In some cases, he found decimal approximations.</p>
<p>A few of the many summations of series found in the Jade Mirror are
the following:</p>
<p>No proofs are given, however, nor does the topic seem to have been
continued again in China until about the nineteenth century. Zhu Shijie
handled his summations through the method of finite differences, some
elements of which seem to date in China from the seventh century, but
shortly after his work, the method disappeared for many centuries.</p>
<p>The Jade Mirror opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle,
inappropriately known in the West as “Pascal’s triangle.” (See the
following illustration.) In Zhu’s arrangement, we have the coefficients
of binomial expansions through the eighth power, clearly given in rod
numerals and a round zero symbol. Zhu disclaims credit for the triangle,
referring to it as a “diagram of the old method for finding eighth and
lower powers.” A similar arrangement of coefficients through the sixth
power had appeared in the work of Yang Hui, but without the round zero
symbol. There are references in Chinese works of about 1100 to
tabulation systems for binomial coefficients, and it is likely that the
arithmetic triangle originated in China by about that date. It is
interesting to note that the Chinese discovery of the binomial theorem
for integral powers was associated in its origin with root extractions,
rather than with powers. The equivalent of the theorem apparently was
known to Omar Khayyam at about the time that it was being used in China,
but the earliest extant Arabic work containing it is by al-Kashi in the
fifteenth century. By that time, Chinese mathematics had declined.
Emphasis was placed once again on the tradition of the Nine Chapters and
the requirements of commercial arithmetic. The impressive theoretical
achievements, cloaked in symbolic language that lent them an aura of
mystery, would be revived only after the more intense interaction with
Western European scholarship of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.</p>
<p>The “Pascal” triangle, as depicted in 1303 at the front of Zhu
Shijie’s Jade Mirror. It is titled “The Old Method Chart of the Seven
Multiplying Squares” and tabulates the binomial coefficients up to the
eighth power. (Reproduced from J. Needham 1959, Vol. 3, p. 135.)</p>
