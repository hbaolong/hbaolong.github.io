<h4 id="spatial-relationships">Spatial Relationships</h4>
<p>Statements about the origins of mathematics, whether of arithmetic or
geometry, are of necessity hazardous, for the beginnings of the subject
are older than the art of writing. It is only during the last half-dozen
millennia, in a passage that may have spanned thousands of millennia,
that human beings have been able to put their records and thoughts into
written form. For data about the prehistoric age, we must depend on
interpretations based on the few surviving artifacts, on evidence
provided by current anthropology, and on a conjectural backward
extrapolation from surviving documents. Neolithic peoples may have had
little leisure and little need for surveying, yet their drawings and
designs suggest a concern for spatial relationships that paved the way
for geometry. Pottery, weaving, and basketry show instances of
congruence and symmetry, which are in essence parts of elementary
geometry, and they appear on every continent. Moreover, simple sequences
in design, such as that in Fig. 1.1, suggest a sort of applied group
theory, as well as</p>
<p>FIG. 1.1</p>
<p>Spat ial Relat ions hips</p>
<p>propositions in geometry and arithmetic. The design makes it
immediately obvious that the areas of triangles are to one another as
squares on a side, or, through counting, that the sums of consecutive
odd numbers, beginning from unity, are perfect squares. For the
prehistoric period there are no documents; hence, it is impossible to
trace the evolution of mathematics from a specific design to a familiar
theorem. But ideas are like hardy spores, and sometimes the presumed
origin of a concept may be only the reappearance of a much more ancient
idea that had lain dormant.</p>
<p>The concern of prehistoric humans for spatial designs and
relationships may have stemmed from their aesthetic feeling and the
enjoyment of beauty of form, motives that often actuate the
mathematician of today. We would like to think that at least some of the
early geometers pursued their work for the sheer joy of doing
mathematics, rather than as a practical aid in mensuration, but there
are alternative theories. One of these is that geometry, like counting,
had an origin in primitive ritualistic practice. Yet the theory of the
origin of geometry in a secularization of ritualistic practice is by no
means established. The development of geometry may
justaswellhavebeenstimulatedbythepracticalneedsofconstructionand
surveying or by an aesthetic feeling for design and order.</p>
<p>We can make conjectures about what led people of the Stone Age to
count, to measure, and to draw. That the beginnings of mathematics are
older than the oldest civilizations is clear. To go further and
categorically identify a specific origin in space or time, however, is
to mistake conjecture for history. It is best to suspend judgment on
this matter and to move on to the safer ground of the history of
mathematics as found in the written documents that have come down to
us.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-egypt">2 Ancient Egypt</h2>
<p>Sesostris … made a division of the soil of Egypt among the
inhabitants. … If the river carried away any portion of a man’s lot, …
the king sent persons to examine, and determine by measurement the exact
extent of the loss. … From this practice, I think, geometry first came
to be known in Egypt, whence it passed into Greece.</p>
