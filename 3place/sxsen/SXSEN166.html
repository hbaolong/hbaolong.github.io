<h4 id="barrows-method-of-tangents">Barrow’s Method of Tangents</h4>
<p>Newton could have learned much from Gregory, but the young Cambridge
student evidently was not well acquainted with the work of the Scot.
Instead, it was two Englishmen, one at Oxford and the other at
Cambridge, who made a deeper impression on him. They were John Wallis
and Isaac Barrow (1630 1677). Barrow, like Wallis, entered Holy Orders
but taught mathematics. A mathematical conservative, Barrow disliked the
formalisms of algebra, and in this respect, his work is antithetical to
that of Wallis. He thought that algebra should be part of logic, rather
than of mathematics. An admirer of the ancients, he edited the works of
Euclid, Apollonius, and Archimedes, besides publishing his own Lectiones
opticae (1669) and Lectiones geometriae (1670), both of which Newton
assisted in editing. The date 1668 is important for the fact that Barrow
was giving his geometric lectures at the same time that Gregory’s
Geometriae Pars Universalis and Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia appeared,
as well as a revised edition of Sluse’s Mesolabum. Sluse’s book included
a new section dealing with infinitesimal problems and containing a
method of maxima and minima. Wishing his Lectiones Geometriae to take
account of the state of the subject at the time, Barrow included an
especially full account of the new discoveries. Tangent problems and
quadratures were all the rage, and they figure prominently in Barrow’s
1670 treatise. Here, Barrow preferred the kinematic views of Torricelli
to the static arithmetic of Wallis, and he liked to think of geometric
magnitudes as generated by a steady flow of points. Time, he said, has
many analogies with a line, yet he viewed both as made up of
indivisibles. Although his reasoning is much more like Cavalieri’s than
like Wallis’s or Fermat’s, there is one point at</p>
<p>Bar r o w ’s Me t ho d of Tangent s</p>
<p>which algebraic analysis obtrudes prominently. At the end of Lecture
X,</p>
<p>Barrow wrote,</p>
<p>Supplementary to this we add, in the form of appendices, a method for
finding tangents by calculation frequently used by us, although I hardly
know, after so many well-known and well-worn methods of the kind above,
whether there is any advantage in doing so. Yet I do so on the advice of
a friend 〔later shown to have been Newton〕; and all the more willingly
because it seems to be more profitable and general than those which I
have discussed.</p>
<p>Then Barrow went on to explain a method of tangents that is virtually
identical with the one used in the differential calculus. It is much
like that of Fermat, but it makes use of two quantities—instead of
Fermat’s single letter E—quantities that are equivalent to the modern Δx
and Δy. Barrow explained his tangent rule essentially as follows. If M
is a point on a curve given (in modern notation) by a polynomial
equation f(x, y)50 and if T is the point of intersection of the desired
tangent MT with the x-axis, then Barrow marked off “an indefinitely
small arc, MN, of the curve.” He then drew the ordinates at M and N and
through M a line MR parallel to the x-axis (Fig. 16.1). Then,
designating by m the known ordinate at M, by t the desired subtangent
PT, and by a and e the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle
MRN, Barrow pointed out that the ratio of a to e is equal to the ratio
of m to t. As we should now express it, the ratio of a to e for
infinitely close points is the slope of the curve. To find this ratio,
Barrow proceeded much as Fermat had. He replaced x and y in f(x, y)50
with x1e and y1a, respectively; then, in the resulting equation, he
disregarded all terms not containing a or e (because these by themselves
equal zero) and all terms of a degree higher than the first degree in a
and e, and, finally, he replaced a with m and e with t. From this, the
subtangent is found in terms of x and m, and if x and m are known, the
quantity t is determined. Barrow apparently did not directly know of
Fermat’s work, for he nowhere mentioned his name,</p>
<p>but the men to whom he referred as sources of his ideas include
Cavalieri, Huygens, Gregory of St. Vincent, James Gregory, and Wallis,
and it may be that Fermat’s method became known to Barrow through them.
Huygens and James Gregory, in particular, made frequent use of the
procedure, and Newton, with whom Barrow was working, recognized that
Barrow’s algorithm was only an improvement of Fermat’s.</p>
<p>Of all of the mathematicians who anticipated portions of the
differential and the integral calculus, none approached more closely to
the new analysis than Barrow. He seems to have clearly recognized the
inverse relationship between tangent and quadrature problems. But his
conservative adherence to geometric methods evidently kept him from
making effective use of the relationship, and his contemporaries found
his Lectiones geometricae difficult to understand. Fortunately, Barrow
knew that at that very time, Newton himself was working on the same
problems, and the older man entreated his young associate to collect and
publish his own results. In 1669, Barrow was called to London as
chaplain to Charles II, and Newton, on Barrow’s suggestion, succeeded
him in the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. That the succession was most
felicitous will become apparent in the rest of this chapter.</p>
