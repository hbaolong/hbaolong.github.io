<h4 id="numerals">Numerals</h4>
<p>The second half of the Aryabhatiya is on the reckoning of time and on
spherical trigonometry; here we note an element that would leave a
permanent impression on the mathematics of later generations—the decimal
place-value numeration. It is not known just how Aryabhata carried out
his calculations, but his phrase “from place to place each is ten times
the preceding” is an indication that the application of the principle of
position was in his mind. “Local value” had been an essential part of
Babylonian numeration, and perhaps the Hindus were becoming aware of its
applicability to the decimal notation for integers in use in India. The
development of numerical notations in India seems to have followed about
the same pattern found in Greece. Inscriptions from the earliest period
at Mohenjo Daro show at first simple vertical strokes, arranged into
groups, but by the time of Asoka (third century BCE) a system resembling
the Herodianic was in use. In the newer scheme the repetitive principle
was continued, but new symbols of higher order were adopted for 4, 10,
20, and 100. This so-called Karosthi script then gradually gave way to
another notation, known as the Brahmi characters, which resembled the
alphabetic cipherization in the Greek Ionian system; one wonders whether
it was only a coincidence that the change in India took place shortly
after the period when in Greece the Herodianic numerals were displaced
by the Ionian.</p>
<p>From the Brahmi ciphered numerals to our present-day notation for
integers, two short steps are needed. The first is a recognition that
through the use of the positional principle, the ciphers for the first
nine units can also serve as the ciphers for the corresponding multiples
of 10 or equally well as ciphers for the corresponding multiples of any
power of 10. This recognition would make superfluous all of the Brahmi
ciphers beyond the first nine. It is not known when the reduction to
nine ciphers occurred, and it is likely that the transition to the more
economical notation was made only gradually. It appears from extant
evidence that the change took place in India, but the source of the
inspiration for the change is uncertain. Possibly, the so-called Hindu
numerals were the result of internal development alone; perhaps they
developed first along the western interface between India and Persia,
where remembrance of the Babylonian positional notation may have led to
modification of the Brahmi system. It is possible that the newer system
arose along the eastern interface with China, where the pseudopositional
rod numerals may have suggested the reduction to nine ciphers. There is
also a theory that this reduction may first have been made at Alexandria
within the Greek alphabetic system and that subsequently the idea spread
to India. During the later Alexandrian period, the earlier Greek habit
of writing common fractions with the numerator beneath the denominator
was reversed, and it is this form that was adopted by the Hindus,
without the bar between the two. Unfortunately, the Hindus did not apply
the new numeration for integers to the realm of decimal fractions;
hence, the chief potential advantage of the change from Ionian notation
was lost.</p>
<p>The earliest specific reference to the Hindu numerals is found in 662
in the writings of Severus Sebokt, a Syrian bishop. After Justinian
closed the Athenian philosophical schools, some of the scholars moved to
Syria, where they established centers of Greek learning. Sebokt
evidently felt piqued by the disdain for non-Greek learning expressed by
some associates; hence, he found it expedient to remind those who spoke
Greek that “there are also others who know something.” To illustrate his
point, he called attention to the Hindus and their “subtle discoveries
in astronomy,” especially “their valuable methods of calculation, and
their computing that surpasses description. I wish only to say that this
computation is done by means of nine signs” (Smith 1958, Vol. I,
p. 167). That the numerals had been in use for some time is indicated by
the fact that they occur on an Indian plate of the year 595 CE, where
the date 346 is written in decimal place value notation.</p>
<p>The Symbol for Zero</p>
<p>It should be remarked that the reference to nine symbols, rather than
ten, implies that the Hindus evidently had not yet taken the second step
in the transition to the modern system of numeration—the introduction of
a notation for a missing position—that is, a zero symbol. The history of
mathematics holds many anomalies, and not the least of these is the fact
that “the earliest undoubted occurrence of a zero in India is in an
inscription of 876” (Smith 1958, Vol. II, p. 69)—that is, more than two
centuries after the first reference to the other nine numerals. It is
not even established that the number zero (as distinct from a symbol for
an empty position) arose in conjunction with the other nine Hindu
numerals. It is quite possible that zero originated in the Greek world,
perhaps at Alexandria, and that it was transmitted to India after the
decimal positional system had been established there.</p>
<p>Tr igonome tr y</p>
<p>The history of the zero placeholder in positional notation is further
complicated by the fact that the concept appeared independently, well
before the days of Columbus, in the western as well as the eastern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>With the introduction, in the Hindu notation, of the tenth numeral, a
round goose egg for zero, the modern system of numeration for integers
was completed. Although the medieval Hindu forms of the ten numerals
differ considerably from those in use today, the principles of the
system were established. The new numeration, which we generally call the
Hindu system, is merely a new combination of three basic principles, all
of ancient origin: (1) a decimal base; (2) a positional notation; and
(3) a ciphered form for each of the ten numerals. Not one of these three
was originally devised by the Hindus, but it presumably is due to them
that the three were first linked to form the modern system of
numeration.</p>
<p>It may be well to say a word about the form of the Hindu symbol for
zero—which is also ours. It was once assumed that the round form
originally stemmed from the Greek letter omicron, the initial letter in
the word “ouden,” or “empty,” but recent investigations seem to belie
such an origin. Although the symbol for an empty position in some of the
extant versions of Ptolemy’s tables of chords does seem to resemble an
omicron, the early zero symbols in Greek sexagesimal fractions are round
forms variously embellished and differing markedly from a simple goose
egg. Moreover, when in the fifteenth century in the Byzantine Empire a
decimal positional system was fashioned out of the old alphabetic
numerals by dropping the last eighteen letters and adding a zero symbol
to the first nine letters, the zero sign took forms quite unlike an
omicron. Sometimes it resembled an inverted form of our small letter h;
other times, it appeared as a dot.</p>
