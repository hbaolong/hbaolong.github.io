<h4 id="chapter-2-ancient-egypt">Chapter 2 Ancient Egypt</h4>
<p>Sesostris . . . made a division of the soil of Egypt among the
inhabitants. . . . If the river carried away any portion of a man’s lot,
. . . the king sent persons to examine, and determine by measurement the
exact extent of the loss. . . . From this practice, I think, geometry
first came to be known in Egypt, whence it passed into Greece.</p>
<p>—Herodotus</p>
<p>The Era and the Sources</p>
<p>About 450 BCE, Herodotus, the inveterate Greek traveler and narrative
historian, visited Egypt. He viewed ancient monuments, interviewed
priests, and observed the majesty of the Nile and the achievements of
those working along its banks. His resulting account would become a
cornerstone for the narrative of Egypt’s ancient history. When it came
to mathematics, he held that geometry had originated in Egypt, for he
believed that the subject had arisen there from the practical need for
resurveying after the annual flooding of the river valley. A century
later, the philosopher Aristotle speculated on the same subject and
attributed the Egyptians’ pursuit of geometry to the existence of a
priestly leisure class. The debate, extending well beyond the confines
of Egypt, about whether to credit progress in mathematics to the
practical men (the surveyors, or “rope-stretchers”) or to the
contemplative elements of society (the priests and the philosophers) has
continued to our times. As we shall see, the history of mathematics
displays a constant interplay between these two types of
contributors.</p>
<p>In attempting to piece together the history of mathematics in ancient
Egypt, scholars until the nineteenth century encountered two major
obstacles. The first was the inability to read the source materials that
existed. The second was the scarcity of such materials. For more than
thirty-five centuries, inscriptions used hieroglyphic writing, with
variations from purely ideographic to the smoother hieratic and
eventually the still more flowing demotic forms. After the third century
CE, when they were replaced by Coptic and eventually supplanted by
Arabic, knowledge of hieroglyphs faded. The breakthrough that enabled
modern scholars to decipher the ancient texts came early in the
nineteenth century when the French scholar Jean-François Champollion,
working with multilingual tablets, was able to slowly translate a number
of hieroglyphs. These studies were supplemented by those of other
scholars, including the British physicist Thomas Young, who were
intrigued by the Rosetta Stone, a trilingual basalt slab with
inscriptions in hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek writings that had been
found by members of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition in 1799. By 1822,
Champollion was able to announce a substantive portion of his
translations in a famous letter sent to the Academy of Sciences in
Paris, and by the time of his death in 1832, he had published a grammar
textbook and the beginning of a dictionary.</p>
<p>Although these early studies of hieroglyphic texts shed some light on
Egyptian numeration, they still produced no purely mathematical
materials. This situation changed in the second half of the nineteenth
century. In 1858, the Scottish antiquary Henry Rhind purchased a papyrus
roll in Luxor that is about one foot high and some eighteen feet long.
Except for a few fragments in the Brooklyn Museum, this papyrus is now
in the British Museum. It is known as the Rhind or the Ahmes Papyrus, in
honor of the scribe by whose hand it had been copied in about 1650 BCE.
The scribe tells us that the material is derived from a prototype from
the Middle Kingdom of about 2000 to 1800 BCE. Written in the hieratic
script, it became the major source of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian
mathematics. Another important papyrus, known as the Golenishchev or
Moscow Papyrus, was purchased in 1893 and is now in the Pushkin Museum
of Fine Arts in Moscow. It, too, is about eighteen feet long but is only
one-fourth as wide as the Ahmes Papyrus. It was written less carefully
than the work of Ahmes was, by an unknown scribe of circa. 1890 BCE. It
contains twenty-five examples, mostly from practical life and not
differing greatly from those of Ahmes, except for two that will be
discussed further on. Yet another twelfth-dynasty papyrus, the Kahun, is
now in London; a Berlin papyrus is of the same period. Other, somewhat
earlier, materials are two wooden tablets from Akhmim of about 2000 BCE
and a leather roll containing a list of fractions. Most of this material
was deciphered within a hundred years of Champollion’s death. There is a
striking degree of coincidence between certain aspects of the earliest
known inscriptions and the few mathematical texts of the Middle Kingdom
that constitute our known source material.</p>
<p>Numbers and Fractions</p>
<p>Once Champollion and his contemporaries could decipher inscriptions
on tombs and monuments, Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration was easily
disclosed. The system, at least as old as the pyramids, dating some
5,000 years ago, was based on the 10 scale. By the use of a simple
iterative scheme and of distinctive symbols for each of the first
half-dozen powers of 10, numbers greater than a million were carved on
stone, wood, and other materials. A single vertical stroke represented a
unit, an inverted wicket was used for 10, a snare somewhat resembling a
capital C stood for 100, a lotus flower for 1,000, a bent finger for
10,000, a tadpole for 100,000, and a kneeling figure, apparently Heh,
the god of the Unending, for 1,000,000. Through repetition of these
symbols, the number 12,345, for example, would appear as</p>
<p>Sometimes the smaller digits were placed on the left, and other times
the digits were arranged vertically. The symbols themselves were
occasionally reversed in orientation, so that the snare might be convex
toward either the right or the left.</p>
<p>Egyptian inscriptions indicate familiarity with large numbers at an
early date. A museum at Oxford has a royal mace more than 5,000 years
old, on which a record of 120,000 prisoners and 1,422,000 captive goats
appears. These figures may have been exaggerated, but from other
considerations it is clear that the Egyptians were commendably accurate
in counting and measuring. The construction of the Egyptian solar
calendar is an outstanding early example of observation, measurement,
and counting. The pyramids are another famous instance; they exhibit
such a high degree of precision in construction and orientation that
ill-founded legends have grown up around them.</p>
<p>The more cursive hieratic script used by Ahmes was suitably adapted
to the use of pen and ink on prepared papyrus leaves. Numeration
remained decimal, but the tedious repetitive principle of hieroglyphic
numeration was replaced by the introduction of ciphers or special signs
to represent digits and multiples of powers of 10. The number 4, for
example, usually was no longer represented by four vertical strokes but
by a horizontal bar, and 7 is not written as seven strokes but as a
single cipher resembling a sickle. The hieroglyphic form for the number
28 was ; the hieratic form was simply . Note that the cipher for the
smaller digit 8 (or two 4s) appears on the left, rather than on the
right. The principle of cipherization, introduced by the Egyptians some
4,000 years ago and used in the Ahmes Papyrus, represented an important
contribution to numeration, and it is one of the factors that makes our
own system in use today the effective instrument that it is.</p>
<p>Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions have a special notation for unit
fractions—that is, fractions with unit numerators. The reciprocal of any
integer was indicated simply by placing over the notation for the
integer an elongated oval sign. The fraction thus appeared as and was
written as . In the hieratic notation, appearing in papyri, the
elongated oval is replaced by a dot, which is placed over the cipher for
the corresponding integer (or over the right-hand cipher in the case of
the reciprocal of a multidigit number). In the Ahmes Papyrus, for
example, the fraction appears as , and is written as . Such unit
fractions were freely handled in Ahmes’s day, but the general fraction
seems to have been an enigma to the Egyptians. They felt comfortable
with the fraction , for which they had a special hieratic sign ;
occasionally, they used special signs for fractions of the form n/(n +
1), the complements of the unit fractions. To the fraction , the
Egyptians assigned a special role in arithmetic processes, so that in
finding one-third of a number, they first found two-thirds of it and
subsequently took half of the result! They knew and used the fact that
two-thirds of the unit fraction 1/p is the sum of the two unit fractions
1/2p and 1/6p; they were also aware that double the unit fraction 1/2p
is the unit fraction 1/p. Yet it looks as though, apart from the
fraction , the Egyptians regarded the general proper rational fraction
of the form m/n not as an elementary “thing” but as part of an
uncompleted process. Where today we think of as a single irreducible
fraction, Egyptian scribes thought of it as reducible to the sum of
three unit fractions, and and .</p>
<p>To facilitate the reduction of “mixed” proper fractions to the sum of
unit fractions, the Ahmes Papyrus opens with a table expressing 2/n as a
sum of unit fractions for all odd values of n from 5 to 101. The
equivalent of is given as and , is written as and , and is expressed as
and . The last item in the table decomposes into and and and . It is not
clear why one form of decomposition was preferred to another of the
indefinitely many that are possible. This last entry certainly
exemplifies the Egyptian prepossession for halving and taking a third;
it is not at all clear to us why the decomposition 2/n = 1/n + 1/2n 1/3n
+ 1/2 · 3 · n is better than 1/n + 1/n. Perhaps one of the objects of
the 2/n decomposition was to arrive at unit fractions smaller than
1/n. Certain passages indicate that the Egyptians had some appreciation
of general rules and methods above and beyond the specific case at hand,
and this represents an important step in the development of
mathematics.</p>
<p>Arithmetic Operations</p>
<p>The 2/n table in the Ahmes Papyrus is followed by a short n/10 table
for n from 1 to 9, the fractions again being expressed in terms of the
favorites—unit fractions and the fraction . The fraction , for example,
is broken into and and . Ahmes had begun his work with the assurance
that it would provide a “complete and thorough study of all things . . .
and the knowledge of all secrets,” and therefore the main portion of the
material, following the 2/n and n/10 tables, consists of eighty-four
widely assorted problems. The first six of these require the division of
one or two or six or seven or eight or nine loaves of bread among ten
men, and the scribe makes use of the n/10 table that he has just given.
In the first problem, the scribe goes to considerable trouble to show
that it is correct to give to each of the ten men one tenth of a loaf!
If one man receives of a loaf, two men will receive or and four men will
receive of a loaf or of a loaf. Hence, eight men will receive of a loaf
or of a loaf, and eight men plus two men will receive , or a whole loaf.
Ahmes seems to have had a kind of equivalent to our least common
multiple, which enabled him to complete the proof. In the division of
seven loaves among ten men, the scribe might have chosen of a loaf for
each, but the predilection for led him instead to and of a loaf for
each.</p>
<p>The fundamental arithmetic operation in Egypt was addition, and our
operations of multiplication and division were performed in Ahmes’s day
through successive doubling, or “duplation.” Our own word
“multiplication,” or manifold, is, in fact, suggestive of the Egyptian
process. A multiplication of, say, 69 by 19 would be performed by adding
69 to itself to obtain 138, then adding this to itself to reach 276,
applying duplation again to get 552, and once more to obtain 1104, which
is, of course, 16 times 69. Inasmuch as 19 = 16 + 2 + 1, the result of
multiplying 69 by 19 is 1104 + 138 + 69, that is, 1311. Occasionally, a
multiplication by 10 was also used, for this was a natural concomitant
of the decimal hieroglyphic notation. Multiplication of combinations of
unit fractions was also a part of Egyptian arithmetic. Problem 13 in the
Ahmes Papyrus, for example, asks for the product of and ; the result is
correctly found to be . For division, the duplation process is reversed,
and the divisor, instead of the multiplicand, is successively doubled.
That the Egyptians had developed a high degree of artistry in applying
the duplation process and the unit fraction concept is apparent from the
calculations in the problems of Ahmes. Problem 70 calls for the quotient
when 100 is divided by ; the result, , is obtained as follows. Doubling
the divisor successively, we first obtain , then , and finally 63, which
is 8 times the divisor. Moreover, of the divisor is known to be . Hence,
the divisor when multiplied by will total , which is short of the
product 100 that is desired. Here a clever adjustment was made. Inasmuch
as 8 times the divisor is 63, it follows that the divisor when
multiplied by will produce . From the 2/n table, one knows that is ;
hence, the desired quotient is . Incidentally, this procedure makes use
of a commutative principle in multiplication, with which the Egyptians
evidently were familiar.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmes’s problems show knowledge of manipulations of
proportions equivalent to the “rule of three.” Problem 72 calls for the
number of loaves of bread of “strength” 45, which are equivalent to 100
loaves of “strength” 10, and the solution is given as 100/10 × 45, or
450 loaves. In bread and beer problems, the “strength,” or pesu, is the
reciprocal of the grain density, being the quotient of the number of
loaves or units of volume divided by the amount of grain. Bread and beer
problems are numerous in the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 63, for example,
requires the division of 700 loaves of bread among four recipients if
the amounts they are to receive are in the continued proportion . The
solution is found by taking the ratio of 700 to the sum of the fractions
in the proportion. In this case, the quotient of 700 divided by is found
by multiplying 700 by the reciprocal of the divisor, which is . The
result is 400; by taking and and and of this, the required shares of
bread are found.</p>
<p>“Heap” Problems</p>
<p>The Egyptian problems so far described are best classified as
arithmetic, but there are others that fall into a class to which the
term “algebraic” is appropriately applied. These do not concern specific
concrete objects, such as bread and beer, nor do they call for
operations on known numbers. Instead, they require the equivalent of
solutions of linear equations of the form x + ax = b or x + ax + bx = c,
where a and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred
to as “aha,” or heap. Problem 24, for instance, calls for the value of
heap if heap and of heap is 19. The solution given by Ahmes is not that
of modern textbooks but is characteristic of a procedure now known as
the “method of false position,” or the “rule of false.” A specific
value, most likely a false one, is assumed for heap, and the operations
indicated on the left-hand side of the equality sign are performed on
this assumed number. The result of these operations is then compared
with the result desired, and by the use of proportions the correct
answer is found. In problem 24, the tentative value of the unknown is
taken as 7, so that is 8, instead of the desired answer, which was 19.
Inasmuch as , one must multiply 7 by to obtain the correct heap; Ahmes
found the answer to be . Ahmes then “checked” his result by showing that
if to one adds of this (which is ), one does indeed obtain 19. Here we
see another significant step in the development of mathematics, for the
check is a simple instance of a proof. Although the method of false
position was generally used by Ahmes, there is one problem (Problem 30)
in which is solved by factoring the left-hand side of the equation and
dividing 37 by the result being</p>
<p>Many of the “aha” calculations in the Rhind (Ahmes) Papyrus appear to
be practice exercises for young students. Although a large proportion of
them are of a practical nature, in some places the scribe seemed to have
had puzzles or mathematical recreations in mind. Thus, Problem 79 cites
only “seven houses, 49 cats, 343 mice, 2401 ears of spelt, 16807
hekats.” It is presumed that the scribe was dealing with a problem,
perhaps quite well known, where in each of seven houses there are seven
cats, each of which eats seven mice, each of which would have eaten
seven ears of grain, each of which would have produced seven measures of
grain. The problem evidently called not for the practical answer, which
would be the number of measures of grain that were saved, but for the
impractical sum of the numbers of houses, cats, mice, ears of spelt, and
measures of grain. This bit of fun in the Ahmes Papyrus seems to be a
forerunner of our familiar nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>As I was going to St. Ives,</p>
<p>I met a man with seven wives;</p>
<p>Every wife had seven sacks,</p>
<p>Every sack had seven cats,</p>
<p>Every cat had seven kits,</p>
<p>Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,</p>
<p>How many were going to St. Ives?</p>
<p>Geometric Problems</p>
<p>It is often said that the ancient Egyptians were familiar with the
Pythagorean theorem, but there is no hint of this in the papyri that
have come down to us. There are nevertheless some geometric problems in
the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 51 of Ahmes shows that the area of an
isosceles triangle was found by taking half of what we would call the
base and multiplying this by the altitude. Ahmes justified his method of
finding the area by suggesting that the isosceles triangle can be
thought of as two right triangles, one of which can be shifted in
position, so that together the two triangles form a rectangle. The
isosceles trapezoid is similarly handled in Problem 52, in which the
larger base of a trapezoid is 6, the smaller base is 4, and the distance
between them is 20. Taking of the sum of the bases, “so as to make a
rectangle,” Ahmes multiplied this by 20 to find the area. In
transformations such as these, in which isosceles triangles and
trapezoids are converted into rectangles, we may see the beginnings of a
theory of congruence and the idea of proof in geometry, but there is no
evidence that the Egyptians carried such work further. Instead, their
geometry lacks a clear-cut distinction between relationships that are
exact and those that are only approximations.</p>
<p>A surviving deed from Edfu, dating from a period some 1,500 years
after Ahmes, gives examples of triangles, trapezoids, rectangles, and
more general quadrilaterals. The rule for finding the area of the
general quadrilateral is to take the product of the arithmetic means of
the opposite sides. Inaccurate though the rule is, the author of the
deed deduced from it a corollary—that the area of a triangle is half of
the sum of two sides multiplied by half of the third side. This is a
striking instance of the search for relationships among geometric
figures, as well as an early use of the zero concept as a replacement
for a magnitude in geometry.</p>
<p>The Egyptian rule for finding the area of a circle has long been
regarded as one of the outstanding achievements of the time. In Problem
50, the scribe Ahmes assumed that the area of a circular field with a
diameter of 9 units is the same as the area of a square with a side of 8
units. If we compare this assumption with the modern formula A = πr2, we
find the Egyptian rule to be equivalent to giving π a value of about , a
commendably close approximation, but here again we miss any hint that
Ahmes was aware that the areas of his circle and square were not exactly
equal. It is possible that Problem 48 gives a hint to the way in which
the Egyptians were led to their area of the circle. In this problem, the
scribe formed an octagon from a square having sides of 9 units by
trisecting the sides and cutting off the four corner isosceles
triangles, each having an area of units. The area of the octagon, which
does not differ greatly from that of a circle inscribed within the
square, is 63 units, which is not far removed from the area of a square
with 8 units on a side. That the number 4(8/9)2 did indeed play a role
comparable to our constant π seems to be confirmed by the Egyptian rule
for the circumference of a circle, according to which the ratio of the
area of a circle to the circumference is the same as the ratio of the
area of the circumscribed square to its perimeter. This observation
represents a geometric relationship of far greater precision and
mathematical significance than the relatively good approximation for
π.</p>
<p>Degree of accuracy in approximation is not a good measure of either
mathematical or architectural achievement, and we should not
overemphasize this aspect of Egyptian work. Recognition by the Egyptians
of interrelationships among geometric figures, on the other hand, has
too often been overlooked, and yet it is here that they came closest in
attitude to their successors, the Greeks. No theorem or formal proof is
known in Egyptian mathematics, but some of the geometric comparisons
made in the Nile Valley, such as those on the perimeters and the areas
of circles and squares, are among the first exact statements in history
concerning curvilinear figures.</p>
<p>The value of is often used today for π; but we must recall that
Ahmes’s value for π is about , not . That Ahmes’s value was also used by
other Egyptians is confirmed in a papyrus roll from the twelfth dynasty
(the Kahun Papyrus), in which the volume of a cylinder is found by
multiplying the height by the area of the base, the base being
determined according to Ahmes’s rule.</p>
<p>Associated with Problem 14 in the Moscow Papyrus is a figure that
looks like an isosceles trapezoid (see Fig. 2.1), but the calculations
associated with it indicate that a frustum of a square pyramid is
intended. Above and below the figure are signs for 2 and 4,
respectively, and within the figure are the hieratic symbols for 6 and
56. The directions alongside make it clear that the problem calls for
the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid 6 units high if the edges of
the upper and lower bases are 2 and 4 units, respectively. The scribe
directs one to square the numbers 2 and 4 and to add to the sum of these
squares the product of 2 and 4, the result being 28. This result is then
multiplied by a third of 6, and the scribe concludes with the words
“See, it is 56; you have found it correctly.” That is, the volume of the
frustum has been calculated in accordance with the modern formula V =
h(a2 + ab + b2)/3, where h is the altitude and a and b are the sides of
the square bases. Nowhere is this formula written out, but in substance
it evidently was known to the Egyptians. If, as in the deed from Edfu,
one takes b = 0, the formula reduces to the familiar formula, one-third
the base times the altitude, for the volume of a pyramid.</p>

<p>How these results were arrived at by the Egyptians is not known. An
empirical origin for the rule on the volume of a pyramid seems to be a
possibility, but not for the volume of the frustum. For the latter, a
theoretical basis seems more likely, and it has been suggested that the
Egyptians may have proceeded here as they did in the cases of the
isosceles triangle and the isosceles trapezoid—they may mentally have
broken the frustum into parallelepipeds, prisms, and pyramids. On
replacing the pyramids and the prisms by equal rectangular blocks, a
plausible grouping of the blocks leads to the Egyptian formula. One
could, for example, have begun with a pyramid having a square base and
with the vertex directly over one of the base vertices. An obvious
decomposition of the frustum would be to break it into four parts as in
Fig. 2.2—a rectangular parallelepiped having a volume b2h, two
triangular prisms, each with a volume of b(a − b)h/2, and a pyramid of
volume (a − b)2h/3. The prisms can be combined into a rectangular
parallelepiped with dimensions b and a − b and h; and the pyramid can be
thought of as a rectangular parallelepiped with dimensions a − b and a −
b and h/3. On cutting up the tallest parallelepipeds so that all
altitudes are h/3, one can easily arrange the slabs so as to form three
layers, each of altitude h/3, and having cross-sectional areas of a2 and
ab and b2, respectively.</p>

<p>Problem 10 in the Moscow Papyrus presents a more difficult question
of interpretation than does Problem 14. Here the scribe asks for the
surface area of what looks like a basket with a diameter of . He
proceeds as though he were using the equivalent of a formula where x is
, obtaining an answer of 32 units. Inasmuch as is the Egyptian
approximation of π/4, the answer 32 would correspond to the surface of a
hemisphere of diameter , and this was the interpretation given to the
problem in 1930. Such a result, antedating the oldest known calculation
of a hemispherical surface by some 1,500 years, would have been amazing,
and it seems, in fact, to have been too good to be true. Later analysis
indicates that the “basket” may have been a roof—somewhat like that of a
Quonset hut in the shape of a half-cylinder of diameter and length . The
calculation in this case calls for nothing beyond knowledge of the
length of a semicircle, and the obscurity of the text makes it
admissible to offer still more primitive interpretations, including the
possibility that the calculation is only a rough estimate of the area of
a domelike barn roof. In any case, we seem to have here an early
estimation of a curvilinear surface area.</p>
<p>Slope Problems</p>
<p>In the construction of the pyramids, it had been essential to
maintain a uniform slope for the faces, and it may have been this
concern that led the Egyptians to introduce a concept equivalent to the
cotangent of an angle. In modern technology, it is customary to measure
the steepness of a straight line through the ratio of the “rise” to the
“run.” In Egypt, it was customary to use the reciprocal of this ratio.
There, the word “seqt” meant the horizontal departure of an oblique line
from the vertical axis for every unit change in the height. The seqt
thus corresponded, except for the units of measurement, to the batter
used today by architects to describe the inward slope of a masonry wall
or pier. The vertical unit of length was the cubit, but in measuring the
horizontal distance, the unit used was the “hand,” of which there were
seven in a cubit. Hence, the seqt of the face of a pyramid was the ratio
of run to rise, the former measured in hands, the latter in cubits.</p>
<p>In Problem 56 of the Ahmes Papyrus, one is asked to find the seqt of
a pyramid that is 250 ells or cubits high and has a square base 360 ells
on a side. The scribe first divided 360 by 2 and then divided the result
by 250, obtaining in ells. Multiplying the result by 7, he gave the seqt
as in hands per ell. In other pyramid problems in the Ahmes Papyrus, the
seqt turns out to be , agreeing somewhat better with that of the great
Cheops Pyramid, 440 ells wide and 280 high, the seqt being hands per
ell.</p>
<p>Arithmetic Pragmatism</p>
<p>The knowledge indicated in extant Egyptian papyri is mostly of a
practical nature, and calculation was the chief element in the
questions. Where some theoretical elements appear to enter, the purpose
may have been to facilitate technique. Even the once-vaunted Egyptian
geometry turns out to have been mainly a branch of applied arithmetic.
Where elementary congruence relations enter, the motive seems to be to
provide mensurational devices. The rules of calculation concern specific
concrete cases only. The Ahmes and Moscow papyri, our two chief sources
of information, may have been only manuals intended for students, but
they nevertheless indicate the direction and tendencies in Egyptian
mathematical instruction. Further evidence provided by inscriptions on
monuments, fragments of other mathematical papyri, and documents from
related scientific fields serves to confirm the general impression. It
is true that our two chief mathematical papyri are from a relatively
early period, a thousand years before the rise of Greek mathematics, but
Egyptian mathematics seems to have remained remarkably uniform
throughout its long history. It was at all stages built around the
operation of addition, a disadvantage that gave to Egyptian computation
a peculiar primitivity, combined with occasionally astonishing
complexity.</p>
<p>The fertile Nile Valley has been described as the world’s largest
oasis in the world’s largest desert. Watered by one of the most
gentlemanly of rivers and geographically shielded to a great extent from
foreign invasion, it was a haven for peace-loving people who pursued, to
a large extent, a calm and unchallenged way of life. Love of the
beneficent gods, respect for tradition, and preoccupation with death and
the needs of the dead all encouraged a high degree of stagnation.
Geometry may have been a gift of the Nile, as Herodotus believed, but
the available evidence suggests that Egyptians used the gift but did
little to expand it. The mathematics of Ahmes was that of his ancestors
and of his descendants. For more progressive mathematical achievements,
one must look to the more turbulent river valley known as
Mesopotamia.</p>
