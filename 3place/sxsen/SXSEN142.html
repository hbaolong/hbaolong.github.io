<h4 id="logarithms">Logarithms</h4>
<p>John Napier (or Neper), who published his description of logarithms
in 1614, was a Scottish laird, the Baron of Merchiston, who managed his
large estates, championed Protestantism, and wrote on varied topics. He
was interested only in certain aspects of mathematics, chiefly those
relating to computation and trigonometry. “Napier’s rods” or “bones”
were sticks on which multiplication tables were carved in a form ready
to be applied to lattice multiplication; “Napier’s analogies” and
“Napier’s rule of circular parts” were devices to aid the memory in
connection with spherical trigonometry.</p>
<p>Napier tells us that he had been working on his invention of
logarithms for twenty years before he published his results, a statement
that would place the origin of his ideas about 1594. He evidently had
been thinking of the sequences, which had been published now and then,
of successive powers of a given number—as in Stifel’s Arithmetica
Integra fifty years earlier and as in the works of Archimedes. In such
sequences, it was obvious that sums and differences of indices of the
powers corresponded to products and quotients of the powers themselves,
but a sequence of</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms</p>
<p>integral powers of a base, such as two, could not be used for
computational purposes because the large gaps between successive terms
made interpolation too inaccurate. While Napier was pondering the
matter, Dr. John Craig, a physician to James VI of Scotland, called on
him and told him of prosthaphaeresis being used in Tycho Brahe’s
observatory in Denmark. Word of this encouraged Napier to redouble his
efforts and ultimately to publish in 1614 the Mirifici Logarithmorum
Canonis Descriptio (A Description of the Marvelous Rule of
Logarithms).</p>
<p>The key to Napier’s work can be explained very simply. To keep the
terms in a geometric progression of integral powers of a given number
close together, it is necessary to take as the given number something
quite close to 1. Napier therefore chose to use 1210 7 (or .9999999) as
his given number. Now the terms in the progression of increasing powers
are indeed close together—too close, in fact. To achieve a balance and
to avoid decimals, Napier multiplied each power by 107. That is, if
N5107(121/107)L, then L is Napier’s “logarithm” of the number N. Thus,
his logarithm of 107 is 0, his logarithm of 107(121/107)59999999 is 1,
and so on. If his numbers and his logarithms were to be divided by 107,
one would virtually have a system of logarithms to the base 1/e, for
(121/107)107 isclosetolimn-N(121/n)n 51/e.Itmustberemembered,
however,thatNapierhadnoconceptofabaseforasystemoflogarithms,for his
definition was different from ours. The principles of his work were
explained in geometric terms as follows. Let a line segment AB and a
half line or ray CDE … be given (Fig. 14.1). Let a point P start from A
and move along AB with variable speed decreasing in proportion to its
distance from B; during the same time, let a point Q start from C and
move along CDE … with uniform speed equal to the rate with which point P
began its motion. Napier called this variable distance CQ the logarithm
of the distance PB.</p>
<p>Napier’s geometric definition is, of course, in agreement with the
numerical description given earlier. To show this, let PB5x and CQ 5y.
If AB is taken as 107, and if the initial speed of P is also taken as
107, then in modern calculus notations we have dx/dt52x and dy/dt5107,
x0 5107, y0 50. Then, dy/dx52107 /x, or y52107 ln cx, where c is found
from the initial boundary conditions to be 10 7. Hence, y52107 ln
(x/l07) or y/107 5log1/e(x/107). That is, if the distances PB and CQ
were divided by 107, Napier’s definition would lead precisely to a
system of logarithms to the base 1/e, as mentioned earlier. Needless to
say, Napier built up his tables numerically, rather than geometrically,
as the word “logarithm,” which he coined, implies. At first, he called
his power indices “artificial numbers,” but later he made up the
compound of the two Greek words Logos (or ratio) and arithmos (or
number).</p>
<p>Napier did not think of a base for his system, but his tables
nevertheless were compiled through repeated multiplications, equivalent
to powers of .9999999. Obviously, the power (or number) decreases as
the</p>
<p>A P B</p>
<p>C D Q E</p>
<p>FIG. 14.1</p>
<p>index (or logarithm) increases. This is to be expected, because he
was essentially using a base 1/e, which is less than 1. A more striking
difference between his logarithms and ours lies in the fact that his
logarithm of a product (or a quotient) generally was not equal to the
sum (or difference) of the logarithms. If L1 5Log N1 and L2 5Log N2,
then7 N151077ð112102 7ÞL1 and N25107ð1210 7ÞL2, whence N1N2=1075</p>
<p>L 1L</p>
<p>10 ð1210 Þ so that the sum of Napier’s logarithms will be the7
logarithm not of N1N2 but of N1N2 /10 . Similar modifications hold, of
course, for logarithms of quotients, powers, and roots. If L 5Log N, for
instance, then nL5Log Nn /107(n 1). These differences are not too
significant, for they merely involve shifting a decimal point. That
Napier was thoroughly familiar with rules for products and powers is
seen in his remark that all numbers (he called them “sines”) in the
ratio of 2 to 1 have differences of 6,931,469.22 in logarithms, and all
of those in the proportion of 10 to 1 have differences of 23,025,842.34
in logarithms. In these differences we see, if we shift the decimal
point, the natural logarithms of the numbers 2 and 10. Hence, it is not
unreasonable to use the name “Napierian” for natural logarithms, even
though these logarithms are not strictly the ones that Napier had in
mind.</p>
<p>The concept of the logarithmic function is implied in Napier’s
definition and in all of his work with logarithms, but this relationship
was not uppermost in his mind. He had laboriously built up his system
for one purpose—the simplification of computations, especially of
products and quotients. Moreover, that he had trigonometric computations
in view is made clear by the fact that what we, for simplification of
exposition, referred to as Napier’s logarithm of a number, he actually
called the logarithm of a sine. In Fig. 14.1, the line CQ was called the
logarithm of the sine PB. This makes no real difference either in theory
or in practice.</p>
<p>Henry Briggs</p>
<p>The publication in 1614 of the system of logarithms was greeted with
prompt recognition, and among the most enthusiastic admirers was Henry
Briggs, the first Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford and the first
Gresham College professor of geometry. In 1615, he visited Napier at his
home in Scotland, and there they discussed possible modifications</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms</p>
<p>in the method of logarithms. Briggs proposed that powers of 10 should
be used, and Napier said he had thought of this and was in agreement.
Napier at one time had proposed a table using log 150 and log 1051010
(to avoid fractions). The two men finally concluded that the logarithm
of 1 should be zero and that the logarithm of 10 should be 1. Napier,
however, no longer had the energy to put their ideas into practice. He
died in 1617, the year in which his Rhabdologia, with its description of
his rods, appeared. The second of his classic treatises on logarithms,
the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio, in which he gave a full
account of the methods he used in building up his tables, appeared
posthumously in 1619. To Briggs, therefore, fell the task of making up
the first table of common, or Briggsian, logarithms. Instead of taking
powers of a number close to 1, as had Napier, Briggs began with log 1051
and then found other logarithms by taking successive roots. By finding
p1053:162277, for example, Briggs had log 3.1622775.5000000, and from
103=2 5p31:6227755:623413 he had log 5.6234135.7500000. Continuing in
this manner, he computed other common logarithms. In the year of
Napier’s death, 1617, Briggs published his Logarithmorum chilias
prima—that is, the logarithms of numbers from 1 to 1,000, each carried
out to fourteen places. In 1624, in Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs
extended the table to include common logarithms of numbers from 1 to
20,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000, again to fourteen places. The
complete ten-place table of logarithms from 1 to 100,000 was published
three years later by two Dutchmen, the surveyor Ezechiel DeDecker and
the book publisher Adriaan Vlacq; with added corrections, it remained
the standard for more than three centuries. Work with logarithms now
could be carried out just as it is today, for all of the usual laws of
logarithms applied in connection with Briggs’s tables. Incidentally, it
is from Briggs’s book of 1624 that our words “mantissa” and
“characteristic” are derived. While Briggs was working out tables of
common logarithms, a contemporary mathematics teacher, John Speidell,
drew up natural logarithms of trigonometric functions and published
these in his New Logarithmes of 1619. A few natural logarithms had, in
fact, appeared earlier in 1616 in an English translation by Edward
Wright (1559 1615) of Napier’s first work on logarithms designed for the
use of navigators. Seldom has a new discovery “caught on” so rapidly as
did the invention of logarithms, and the result was the prompt
appearance of tables of logarithms.</p>
<p>Jobst Bu¨rgi</p>
<p>Napier was the first one to publish a work on logarithms, but very
similar ideas were developed independently in Switzerland by Jobst
Bu¨rgi at about the same time. In fact, it is possible that the idea of
logarithms had occurred to Bu¨rgi as early as 1588, which would be half
a dozen years before Napier began work in the same direction. Yet Bu¨rgi
printed his results only in 1620, half a dozen years after Napier had
published his Descriptio. Bu¨rgi’s work appeared at Prague in a book
titled Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen, and this
indicates that the influences leading to his work were similar to those
operating in the case of Napier. The differences between the work of the
two men lie chiefly in their terminology and in the numerical values
they used; the fundamental principles were the same. Instead of
proceeding from a number a little less than 1 (as had Napier, who used
1210 7), Bu¨rgi chose a number a little greater than 1—the number 1110
4, and instead of multiplying powers of this number by 107, Bu¨rgi
multiplied by 108. There was one other minor difference: Bu¨rgi
multiplied all of his power indices by 10 in his tabulation. That is, if
N5108(1110 4)L, Bu¨rgi called 10L the “red” number corresponding to the
“black” number N. If in this scheme we were to divide all of the black
numbers by 108 and all of the red numbers by 105, we should virtually
have a system of natural logarithms. For instance, Bu¨rgi gave for the
black number 1,000,000,000 the red number 230,270.022, which, on
shifting decimal points, is equivalent to saying that ln 1052.30270022.
This is not a bad approx-4 imation to the modern value, especially when
we recall thatn ð1110 4Þ10 is not quite the same as limn-Nð111=nÞ ,
although the values agree to four significant figures.</p>
<p>Bu¨rgi must be regarded as an independent discoverer who lost credit
for the invention because of Napier’s priority in publication. In one
respect, his logarithms come closer to ours than do Napier’s, for as
Bu¨rgi’s black numbers increase, so do the red numbers, but the two
systems share the disadvantage that the logarithm of a product or a
quotient is not the sum or the difference of the logarithms.</p>
