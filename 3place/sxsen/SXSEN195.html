<h4 id="differential-equations">Differential Equations</h4>
<p>D’Alembert, a man of wide interests, is perhaps best known today for
what is referred to as d’Alembert’s principle: the internal actions and
reactions of a system of rigid bodies in motion are in equilibrium. This
appeared in 1743 in his celebrated treatise Traite de dynamique´ . Other
treatises by d’Alembert concerned music, the three-body problem, the
precession of the equinoxes, motion in resisting media, and lunar
perturbations. In studying the problem of vibrating strings, he was led
to the partial differential equation <span class="citation"
data-cites="2u">@2u</span>=<span class="citation"
data-cites="t2">@t2</span> 5@2u=<span class="citation"
data-cites="x2">@x2</span>, for which in 1747 he gave (in the Memoirs of
the Berlin Academy) the solution u5 f(x1t)1g(x2t), where f and g are
arbitrary functions. D’Alembert also found the singular solution of the
differential equation y5xf(yu)1g(yu); hence, this is known as
d’Alembert’s equation.</p>
<p>Bezout´</p>
<p>The year 1783, when d’Alembert and Euler died, was also the year of
E´tienne Bezout’s (1730 1783) death. The son and grandson of
magistrates´ in Nemours, inspired by exposure to works of Euler, he
chose a mathematical career and published his first papers in the 1750s.
One was a memoir on dynamics, which was followed by two papers on
integration. He was appointed to the Academie des Sciences, first as an´
adjoint in mechanics, then an associe´ and, in 1770, a pensionnaire. In
1763, as royal censor, he was appointed examiner of the Gardes de la
Marine. In this position, he was expected to provide textbooks, an
assignment that resulted in a series of widely adopted works. The first
was a four-volume Cours de mathematiques a´
<code>l’usage des Gardes du Pavillon et de la Marine, which appeared between 1764 and 1767. In 1768, the examiner for the artillery died, and Bezout was appointed to´ succeed him, becoming examiner of the Corps d’Artillerie. This resulted in his producing an even more expansive and successful textbook, the Cours complet de mathematiques a´</code>
l’usage de la marine et de l’artillerie, a six-volume work that appeared
between 1770 and 1782. For decades, it was this Cours that students
studied when preparing to enter advanced scientific schools. He took
into account that he was writing for beginners and attempted to build on
subjects familiar to them, such as elementary geometry, conveying a
sense of the range of usefulness of the subject, rather than stressing
fine points of rigor. Judging from repeated editions, his was the most
successful of the late-eighteenth-century Cours that covered the subject
matter of mathematics from the lowest to the highest level. His
textbooks were translated into English and in the early decades of the
nineteenth century were still used at West Point, as well as at Harvard
and other institutions; in 1826, the first American textbook in analytic
geometry was derived from Bezout’s´ Cours. The fourth part of Bezout’s´
Cours— the principles of mechanics—is the raison d’eˆtre of the program.
The mathematical preeminence of France (and, indeed, of Continental
Europe as a whole) in the eighteenth century was based in large measure
on the application of analysis to mechanics as taught in technical
schools, and it was under this influence that the mathematicians of the
French Revolution had been brought up. The emphasis given to mechanics
and to the closing section on navigation is in keeping with the use of
the Cours de mathematiques´ as a text in a military academy such as the
one at Mezie`res, which both Monge and Carnot attended. It was through
such compilations, rather than through the original works of the authors
themselves, that the mathematical advances of Euler and d’Alembert
became widely known.</p>
<p>Bezout’s name is familiar today in connection with the use of deter-´
minants in algebraic elimination. In a memoir of the Paris Academy for
1764 and more extensively in a treatise of 1779 titled Theorie g´ en´
erale´ des equations alg´ ebriques´ , Bezout gave rules, similar to
Cramer’s, for´ solving n simultaneous linear equations in n unknowns. He
is best known for an extension of these to a system of equations in one
or more unknowns, in which it is required to find the condition on the
coefficients necessary for the equations to have a common solution. To
take a very simple case, one might ask for the condition that the
equations a1x1b1y1c1 50, a2x1b2y1c2 50, a3x1b3y1c3 50 have a common
solution. The necessary condition is that the eliminant</p>
<p>a1 b1 c1</p>
<p>a2 b2 c2 ;</p>
<p>a3 b3 c3</p>
<p>C ondorc e t</p>
<p>here a special case of the “Bezoutiant,” should be 0. Somewhat more´
complicated eliminants arise when conditions are sought for two
polynomial equations of unequal degree to have a common solution.
Bezout´ was also the first one to give a satisfactory proof of the
theorem, known to Maclaurin and Cramer, that two algebraic curves of
degrees m and n, respectively, intersect in general in mn points; hence,
this is often called Bezout’s theorem. Euler had contributed to the
theory of elim-´ ination as well, but less extensively than did
Bezout.´</p>
