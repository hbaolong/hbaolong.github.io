<h4 id="rafael-bombelli">Rafael Bombelli</h4>
<p>At this stage, Rafael Bombelli (1526 1572), a largely self-taught
Florentine hydraulic engineer studying the algebraic publications of his
time, had what he called “a wild thought,” for the whole matter “seemed
to rest on sophistry.” The two radicands of the cube roots resulting
from the usual formula differ only in one sign. We have seen that the
solution by</p>
<p>R afael B omb elli</p>
<p>formula of x3 515x14 leads to x5 3 21 2p 1211 3 22 2p 121, whereas it
is known by direct substitution thatp x54 is the only positivep root of
the equation. (Cardan had noted that when all terms on one side of the
equality sign are of higher degree than the terms on the other side, the
equation has one and only one positive root—an anticipation, in a small
way, of part of Descartes’ rule of signs.) Bombelli had the happy
thought that the radicals themselves might be related in much the way
that the radicands are related; that, as we should now say, they are
conjugate imaginaries that lead to the real number 4. It is obvious that
if the sum of the real parts is 4, then the real part of each is 2, and
if a number of the form 21bp21 is to be a cube root of 2111p21, then it
is easy to see that b must be 1. Hence, x5211p2112 21p21, or 4.</p>
<p>Through his ingenious reasoning, Bombelli had shown the important
role that conjugate imaginary numbers were to play in the future. But at
that time, the observation was of no help in the actual work of solving
cubic equations, for Bombelli had had to know beforehand what one of the
roots is. In this case, the equation is already solved, and no formula
is needed; without such foreknowledge, Bombelli’s approach fails. Any
attempt to find algebraically the cube roots of the imaginary numbers in
the Cardan-Tartaglia rule leads to the very cubic in the solution of
which the cube roots arose in the first place, so that one is back where
one started from. Because this impasse arises whenever all three roots
are real, this is known as the “irreducible case.” Here, an expression
for the unknown is indeed provided by the formula, but the form in which
this appears is useless for most purposes.</p>
<p>Bombelli composed his Algebra in about 1560, but it was not printed
until 1572, about a year before he died, and then only in part. One of
the significant things about this book is that it contains symbolisms
reminiscent of those of Chuquet. Bombelli sometimes wrote 1 Z p.5Rm.4
(that is, 1 zenus plus 5 res minus 4) for x2 15x24. But he also used
another form of expression, influenced perhaps by de la Roche’s
Larismethique, in which the power of the unknown quantity is represented
simply as an Arabic numeral above a short circular arc. Books IV and VI
of his Algebra are full of problems in geometry that are solved
algebraically, somewhat in the manner of Regiomontanus but making use of
new symbolisms. In problems such as that of finding the side of a square
inscribed in a certain triangle, a highly symbolic algebra comes to the
aid of geometry, but Bombelli worked in the other direction, too. In the
Algebra, the algebraic solution of cubic equations is accompanied by
geometric demonstrations in terms of the subdivision of the cube.
Unfortunately for the future of geometry—and of mathematics in
general—the last books of Bombelli’s Algebra were not included in the
publication of 1572 but remained in manuscript until 1929.</p>
<p>The Algebra uses the standard Italian symbols p and m for addition
and subtraction, but Bombelli still had no symbol for equality. Our
standard equality sign had been published before Bombelli wrote his
book; the symbol had appeared in England in 1557 in The Whetstone of
Witte of Robert Recorde (1510 1558).</p>
