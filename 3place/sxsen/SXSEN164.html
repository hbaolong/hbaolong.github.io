<h4 id="christiaan-huygens">Christiaan Huygens</h4>
<p>Christiaan Huygens, a member of a prominent Dutch family and the son
of the diplomat Constantin Huygens, was encouraged in mathematical
pursuits as a youngster by both Descartes and Mersenne, who were</p>
<p>associates of his father’s. Christiaan became a scientist of
international reputation, who is recalled for the principle that bears
his name in the wave theory of light, the observation of the rings of
Saturn, and the effective invention of the pendulum clock. It was in
connection with his search for improvements in horology that he made his
most important mathematical discovery.</p>
<p>The Pendulum Clock</p>
<p>Huygens knew that the oscillations of a simple pendulum are not
strictly isochronous but depend on the magnitude of the swing. To phrase
it differently, if an object is placed on the side of a smooth
hemispherical bowl and released, the time it takes to reach the lowest
point will be almost, but not quite, independent of the height from
which it is released. Now it happened that Huygens invented the pendulum
clock at just about the time of the Pascal cycloid contest, in 1658, and
it occurred to him to consider what would happen if one were to replace
the hemispherical bowl with one whose cross-section is an inverted
cycloidal arch. Huygens was delighted to find that for such a bowl, the
object will</p>
<p>Diagrams from Huygens’s Horologium oscillatorium (1673). The one
labeled Fig. II shows the cycloidal jaws that caused the pendulum to
swing in a cycloidal arc.</p>
<p>reach the lowest point in exactly the same time, no matter what
height on the inner surface of the bowl the object is released from. The
cycloid curve is truly a tautochrone—that is, on an inverted cycloidal
arch an object will slide from any point to the bottom in exactly the
same time, no matter what the starting point. But a big question
remained: how does one get a pendulum to oscillate in a cycloidal,
rather than a circular, arc? Here Huygens made a further beautiful
discovery. If one suspends from a point P at the cusp between two
inverted cycloidal semiarches PQ and PR (Fig. 15.14) a pendulum the
length of which is equal to the length of one of the semiarches, the
pendulum bob will swing in an arc that is an arch of a cycloid QSR of
exactly the same size and shape as the cycloid of which arcs PQ and PR
are parts. In other words, if the pendulum of the clock oscillates
between cycloidal jaws, it will be truly isochronous.</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>Huygens made some pendulum clocks with cycloidal jaws, but he found
that in operation, they were no more accurate than those depending on
the oscillations of an ordinary simple pendulum, which are nearly
isochronous for very small swings. Yet in this investigation, Huygens
had made a discovery of capital mathematical significance: the involute
of a cycloid is a similar cycloid, or, inversely, the evolute of a
cycloid is a similar cycloid. This theorem and further results on
involutes and evolutes for other curves were proved by Huygens in an
essentially Archimedean and Fermatian manner by taking neighboring
points and noting the result when the interval vanishes. Descartes and
Fermat had used this device for normals and tangents to a curve, and now
Huygens applied it to find what we call the radius of curvature of a
plane curve. If at neighboring points P and Q on a curve (Fig. 15.15)
one finds the normals and their point of intersection I, then, as Q
approaches P along the curve, the variable point I tends toward a fixed
point O, which is called the center of curvature of the curve for the
point P, and the distance OP is known as the radius of curvature. The
locus of the centers of curvature O for points P on a given curve Ci lie
on a second curve Ce known as the evolute of C, and any curve Ci of
which</p>
<p>Ce is the evolute is called an involute of the curve Ce. It is clear
that the envelope of the normals to Ci, will be Ce, a curve tangent to
each of the normals. In Fig. 15.14, the curve QPR is the evolute of the
curve QSR and the curve QSR is an involute of the curve QPR. The
positions of the string, as the pendulum bob swings back and forth, are
the normals to QSR and the tangents to QPR. As the pendulum bob moves
farther to one side, the string winds more and more about the cycloidal
jaw, and as the bob falls toward the lowest point S, the string unwinds.
Hence, Huygens described the cycloid QSR as ex evolutione descripta, the
cycloid QPR being the evoluta. (In French, the terms de´veloppante and
d´eveloppe´e have since been adopted.)</p>
<p>Involutes and Evolutes</p>
<p>The concepts of radius of curvature and evolute had been adumbrated
in Apollonius’s purely theoretical work on Conics, but only with
Huygens’s interest in horology did the concepts find a permanent place
in mathematics. Analytic geometry had been a product of essentially
theoretical considerations, but Huygens’s development of the idea of
curvature was prompted by practical concerns. An interplay of the two
points of view, the theoretical and the practical, often proves to be
fruitful in mathematics, as the work of Huygens aptly illustrates. His
cycloidal pendulum presented him with an obvious rectification of the
cycloid, a result that Roberval had found earlier but had not published.
The fact that the arc QS (in Fig. 15.14) is formed as the pendulum
string winds about the curve QP shows that the length of the line PS is
exactly equal to the length of the arc QP. Inasmuch as the line PS is
twice the diameter of the circle that generates the cycloid QSR, the
length of a complete arch of the cycloid must be four times the diameter
of the generating circle. The theory of involutes and evolutes similarly
led to the rectification of many other curves, and the
Peripatetic-Cartesian dogma of the nonrectifiability of algebraic curves
came more seriously into question.</p>
<p>In 1658, one of Huygens’s associates, Heinrich van Heuraet (1633
1660?), also a proteg´ e of Van Schooten’s, discovered that the´
semicubical parabola ay2 5x3 can be rectified by Euclidean means, thus
ending the uncertainty. The disclosure appeared in 1659 as one of the
more important aspects of Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes.
This result had been reached independently a little earlier by the
Englishman William Neil (1637 1670) and was known independently a little
later to Fermat in France, constituting another striking case of virtual
simultaneity of discovery. Of all of Fermat’s discoveries in
mathematics, it was only the rectification of the semicubical parabola,
usually known as Neil’s parabola, that was published by him. The
solution appeared in 1660 as a supplement in the Veterum Geometria
Promota in Septem de Cycloide Libris (Geometry of the Ancients Promoted
in Seven Books on the Cycloid) by Antoine de Lalouvere` (1600 1664), the
circle-squarer who had striven for Pascal’s prize. The rectification of
Fermat was found by comparing a small arc of a curve with the
circumscribed figure made up of tangents at the extremities of the arc.
Van Heuraet’s method was based on the rate of change in the arc,
expressed in modern notation by the equation The rectification by Neil
depended on the recognition, already noted byp ð Þ2 ds=dx5 11 y0 .</p>
<p>Wallis in Arithmetica infinitorum, that a small arc is virtually the
hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are the increments in the
abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the equivalent of the modern
formula ds5pdx2 1dy2. Neil’s rectification was published in 1659 by John
Wallis in a treatise titled Tractatus Duo, Prior de Cycloide, Posterior
de Cissoide (Two Treatises, the First on the Cycloid, the Second on the
Cissoid). This work followed by a few months the work of Pascal on the
cycloid, indicating the extent to which cycloid fever had seized
mathematicians just before the invention of the calculus.</p>
<p>Huygens’s work on involutes and evolutes was not published until
1673, when it appeared in his celebrated Horologium Oscillatorium. This
treatise on pendulum clocks is a classic that served as an introduction
to Newton’s Principia a little more than a decade later. It contained
the law of centripetal force for circular motion, Huygens’s law for
pendular motion, the principle of the conservation of kinetic energy,
and other important results in mechanics. During his entire life, he
maintained a broad interest in all things mathematical but especially in
higher plane curves. He rectified the cissoid and studied the tractrix.
Whereas Galileo had thought that the catenary was a parabola, Huygens
showed that it is a nonalgebraic curve. In 1656, he had applied
infinitesimal analysis to the conics, reducing the rectification of the
parabola to the quadrature of the hyperbola (that is, to finding a
logarithm). By the next year, Huygens had become the first one to find
the surface area of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution (the
“conoid” of Archimedes), showing that the complanation can be achieved
by elementary means.</p>
<p>Van Schooten died in 1660, the year in which the Royal Society was
founded in England, and the date can be taken as marking a new shift in
the mathematical center of the world. The Leyden group, gathered about
Van Schooten, was losing its momentum, and it suffered a further blow
when Huygens left for Paris in 1666. Meanwhile, a vigorous development
in mathematics had been taking place in Great Britain; this was further
encouraged by the formation of the Royal Society, which, granted its
charter in 1662, has run its prestigious course for 350 years.</p>

<p>Isaac Barrow</p>
<p>JohnWallis</p>
<p>One of the charter members of the Royal Society, John Wallis (1616
1703) was known amongoldercontemporaries asa
brilliantstudentofmathematics and among later historians as the most
influential English predecessor of Newton. Wallis, like Oughtred,
entered Holy Orders, yet he spent most of his time as a mathematician.
Educated at Cambridge, he was appointed Savilian professor of geometry
at Oxford in 1649, holding the chair that had first been filled by
Briggs when it was established in 1619. Wallis was known to be a
Royalist, although the regime of Cromwell was not averse to using his
services in the deciphering of secret codes, and when Charles II was
restored to the throne, Wallis became the king’s chaplain. Earlier, in
1655, he had published two very important books, one in analytic
geometry, the other in infinite analysis. These were the two leading
branches of mathematics at the time, and the genius of Wallis was well
suited to advance them.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>John Walli s</p>
<p>On Conic Sections</p>
<p>The Tractatus de Sectionibus Conicis of Wallis did for analytic
geometry in England what De Witt’s Elementa Curvarum had done for the
subject on the Continent. Wallis complained, in fact, that De Witt’s
work was an imitation of his own Tractatus, but De Witt’s treatise,
although published four years after that of Wallis, had actually been
composed before 1655. The books of both men may be described as the
completion of the arithmetization of conic sections that had been begun
by Descartes. Wallis, in particular, replaced geometric concepts by
numerical ones wherever possible. Even proportion, the stronghold of
ancient geometry, Wallis held to be an arithmetic concept.</p>
<p>The Conics of Wallis opened by paying lip service to the generation
of the curves as sections of a cone, yet the author deduced all of the
familiar properties through plane coordinate methods from the three
standard forms e2 5ld2ld2 /t, p2 5ld, and h2 5ld1ld2 /t, where e, p, and
h are the ordinates of the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola,
respectively, corresponding to abscissas d measured from a vertex at the
origin, and where l and t are the latus rectum and “diameter” or axis.
Later still, he took these equations as the definitions of the conic
sections, considered “absolutely,” that is, without reference to the
cone. Here, he was even closer than Fermat to the modern definition of a
conic as the locus of points on a plane coordinate system whose
coordinates satisfy an equation of the second degree in two variables, a
fact that Descartes had been aware of but that he had not
emphasized.</p>
<p>Arithmetica Infinitorum</p>
<p>Had Wallis’s Conics not appeared, the loss would not have been
serious, for De Witt’s work appeared only four years later. Yet there
was no substitute for the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis, which was
also published in 1655. Here, Wallis arithmetized the Geometria
indivisibilibus of Cavalieri, as he had arithmetized the Conics of
Apollonius. Whereas Cavalieri had arrived at the result</p>
<p>a m am11 x dx5</p>
<p>0 m11</p>
<p>through a laborious pairing of geometric indivisibles in a
parallelogram with those in one of the two triangles into which a
diagonal divides it, Wallis abandoned the geometric background after
having associated the infinitely many indivisibles in the figures with
numerical values. If, for example, one wishes to compare the squares of
the indivisibles in the triangle with the squares of the indivisibles in
the parallelogram, one takes the length of the first indivisible in the
triangle as zero, the second as 1, the third as 2, and so on, up to the
last, of length n21, if there are n indivisibles. The ratio of the
squares of the indivisibles in the two figures would then be</p>
<p>02 112 1 1 1</p>
<p>2 2 or 5 1</p>
<p>1 11 2 3 6</p>
<p>if there were only two indivisibles in each, or</p>
<p>02 112 122 5 1 1</p>
<p>5 5 1</p>
<p>if there were three, or</p>
<p>02 112 122 132 14 1 1</p>
<p>22 2 2 5 5 1</p>
<p>313 13 13 36 3 18</p>
<p>if there were four. For n11 indivisibles, the result is</p>
<p>02 1212 1222 12 1ðn221Þ2 12 n2 1 1</p>
<p>5 1 ;</p>
<p>n 1n 1n 1 1n 1n 3 6n</p>
<p>and if n is infinite, the ratio obviously is . (For n infinite, the
remainder term l/6n becomes l/N, or zero. Here, Wallis was the first one
to use the now familiar “love knot” symbol for infinity.) This is, of
course, the equivalent of saying that 10x2dx5; Wallis extended the same
procedure to higher integral powers of xÐ. By incomplete induction, he
concluded that</p>
<p>1 m 1 x dx5</p>
<p>0 m11</p>
<p>for all integral values of m.</p>
<p>Fermat rightly criticized Wallis’s induction, for it lacks the rigor
of the method of complete induction that Fermat and Pascal frequently
used. Moreover, Wallis followed a still more questionable principle of
interpolation, under which he assumed that his result also held for
fractional values of m, as well as for negative values (except m5 1). He
even had the hardihood to assume that the formula held for irrational
powers— the earliest statement in the calculus concerning what now would
be called “a higher transcendental function.” The use of exponential
notation for fractional and negative powers was an important
generalization of suggestions made earlier, as by Oresme and Stevin, but
Wallis did not give a sound basis for his extension of the Cartesian
exponentiation.</p>
<p>Wallis was a chauvinistic Englishman, and when he later (in 1685)
published his Treatise of Algebra, Both Historical and Practical, he
belittled the work of Descartes, arguing, very unfairly, that most of it
had been taken from Harriot’s Artis analyticae praxis. The fact that</p>
<p>John Walli s</p>
<p>Wallis’s solutions of the Pascal contest questions had been rejected
as not worthy of the prize evidently did not ameliorate his anti-Gallic
bias. This bias, as well as his casual interpretation of the historical
record, also seems to explain why Wallis, a far better mathematician
than historian, equated algebra (or the analytics of Vie`te) with the
ancient geometric analysis.</p>
<p>Christopher Wren and William Neil</p>
<p>At the time that Wallis sent in his reply to the Pascal challenge,
Christopher Wren (1632 1723) sent Pascal his rectification of the
cycloid. Wren was educated at Oxford and later held there the Savilian
professorship in astronomy. He, too, was elected to the Royal Society,
of which he was president for a few years. Had not the great fire of
1666 destroyed much of London, Wren might now be known as a
mathematician, rather than as the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral and
some fifty other churches. The mathematical circle to which Wren and
Wallis belonged in 1657 1658 evidently was applying the equivalent of
the formula for arc length ds2 5dx2 1dy2 to various curves and was
meeting with brilliant success. We mentioned earlier that William Neil,
when he was only twenty years old, first succeeded in rectifying his
curve, the semicubical parabola, in 1657. Wren found the length of the
cycloid a year later. The rectification by Neil depended on the
recognition, already noted by Wallis in Arithmetica Infinitorum, that a
small arc is virtually the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides
are the increments in the abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the
equivalent of the modern formula ds5pdx2 1dy2. Both Neil’s and Wren’s
discoveries were incorporated, with due credit to the discoverers, by
Wallis in his Tractatus Duo of 1659, a book on infinitesimal problems
related to the cycloid and the cissoid. This work followed by a few
months the work of Pascal on the cycloid, indicating the extent to which
cycloid fever had seized mathematicians just before the invention of the
calculus.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the geometry of surfaces and curves in three
dimensions was then attracting so little attention that almost a century
later, solid analytic geometry was still virtually undeveloped. Wallis,
in his Algebra of 1685, included a study of a surface that belonged to
the class now known as conoids (not, of course, in the Archimedean
sense). Wallis’s surface, which he called the “cono-cuneus” (or conical
wedge), can be described as follows: Let C be a circle, let L be a line
parallel to the plane of C, and let P be a plane perpendicular to L.
Then, the cono-cuneus is the totality of lines that are parallel to P
and pass through points of L and C. Wallis suggested other conoidal
surfaces obtained by replacing the circle C by a conic, and in his
Mechanica of 1670, he had noted the parabolic sections on Wren’s
hyperboloid (or “hyperbolic cylindroid”).</p>
<p>Yet Wallis did not give equations for the surfaces, nor did he
arithmetize geometry of three dimensions, as he had plane geometry.</p>
<p>Wallis’s Formulas</p>
<p>Wallis made his most important contributions in infinitesimal
analysis. Among these was one in which, while evaluating 10px2x2 dx, he
anticipatedsomeofEuler’sworkonthegammaorfactorialfunction.FromÐ the work
of Cavalieri, Fermat, and others, Wallis knew that this integral
represents the area under the semicircle y5px2x2 and that this area
therefore is π/8. But how can one obtain the answer through a direct
evaluationoftheintegralbyinfinitesimaldevices?Walliscouldnotanswer this
question, but his method of induction and interpolation produced an
interesting result. After an evaluation of Ð 102ðx2x2Þndx for several
positive integral values of n, Wallis arrived by incomplete induction at
the conclusion that the value of this integral is (n!) /(2n11)! Assuming
that the formula holds for fractional values of n as well, Wallis
concluded that</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>1p 2 ð Þ12 2</p>
<p>x2x dx5 ! =2!</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>hence, π=85ð12!Þ2 or !51 pmπ1=2: This is a special case of the
Euleriann 1 beta function, Bðm;nÞ5Ð 0x ð12xÞ dx; where m5 and n5.</p>
<p>Among Wallis’s best-known results is the infinite product</p>
<p>2 1U3U3U5U5U7</p>
<p>5 : π 2U2U4U4U6U6</p>
<p>This expression can readily be obtained from the modern theorem</p>

which terminates in 1 or 2, according as m is odd or even.) Hence, the
previous expressions for 0π=2sinmxdx are known as Wallis’s formulas. Yet
the method that Wallis actually used to achieve his product for 2/Ð π
was in reality again based on his principles of induction and
interpolation, applied this time to 10p12x2dx, which he was unable to
evaluate directly for lack of the binomial theorem.Ð</p>
