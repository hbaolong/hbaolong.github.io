<h4 id="colin-maclaurin">Colin Maclaurin</h4>
<p>Colin Maclaurin (1698 1746), perhaps the outstanding British
mathematician of the generation after Newton, was born in Scotland and
educated at the University of Glasgow. He became a professor of
mathematics at Aberdeen when he was nineteen and half a dozen years
later taught at the University of Edinburgh. In Great Britain,
Switzerland, and the Low</p>
<p>C olin Mac laur in</p>
<p>Countries, the leading mathematicians in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries were connected with universities, whereas in
France, Germany, and Russia, they were more likely to be associated with
the academies established by the absolute rulers.</p>
<p>Maclaurin had begun to contribute papers to the Philosophical
Transactions before he was twenty-one, and in 1720, he published two
treatises on curves: Geometrica Organica and De Linearum Geometricarum
proprietatibus. The former, in particular, was a well-known work that
extended the results of Newton and Stirling on conics, cubics, and
higher algebraic curves. Among the propositions is one often known as
the theorem of Be´zout (in honor of the man who later gave an imperfect
proof): a curve of order m intersects a curve of order n in general in
mn points. In connection with this theorem, Maclaurin noticed a
difficulty that is usually known as Cramer’s paradox, in honor of a
later rediscoverer. A curve of order n is generally determined, as
Stirling had indicated, by n(n13)/2 points. Thus, a conic is uniquely
determined by five points and a cubic should be determined by nine
points. By the Maclaurin-Be´zout theorem, however, two curves of degree
n intersect in n2 points, so that two different cubics intersect in nine
points. Hence, it is obvious that n(n13)/2 points do not always uniquely
determine a single curve of order n. The answer to the paradox did not
appear until a century later, when it was explained in the work of
Julius Plu¨cker.</p>
<p>Taylor’s Series</p>
<p>In view of Maclaurin’s striking results in geometry, it is ironic
that today his name is recalled almost exclusively in connection with
the so-called Maclaurin series, which appeared in his Treatise of
Fluxions of 1742 but is only a special case of the more general Taylor
series, published by Brook Taylor (1685 1731) in 1715 in his Methodus
Incrementorum Directa et Inversa. Taylor was a Cambridge graduate, an
enthusiastic admirer of Newton, and secretary of the Royal Society. He
was much interested in perspective; on this subject he published two
books in 1715 and 1719, in the second of which he gave the first general
statement of the principle of vanishing points. Yet today his name is
recalled almost exclusively in connection with the series</p>
<p>fðx1aÞ5fðaÞ1f 0ðaÞx1f nðaÞ x2</p>
<p>2!</p>
<p>1f 000ðaÞ x3 1 1f ðnÞðaÞ xn 1</p>
<p>3! n!</p>
<p>which appeared in the Methodus Incrementorum. The series becomes the
familiar Maclaurin series on substituting zero for a. The general Taylor
series had been known many years prior to James Gregory and also, in
essence, to Jean Bernoulli, but Taylor was unaware of this. Moreover,
the Maclaurin series had appeared in Stirling’s Methodus Differentialis
more than a dozen years before it was published by Maclaurin. Clio, the
muse of history, is often fickle in the matter of attaching names to
theorems!</p>
<p>The Analyst Controversy</p>
<p>The Methodus Incrementorum also contained a number of other familiar
parts of the calculus, such as formulas relating the derivative of a
function to the derivative of the inverse function—for example, d2x/dy2
52d2y/ dx2 /(dy/dx)3—singular solutions of differential equations, and
an attempt to find an equation for a vibrating string. After 1719,
Taylor gave up the pursuit of mathematics, but the young Maclaurin was
then just beginning his fruitful career. His Treatise of Fluxions was
not merely another book on the techniques of the calculus, but was an
effort to establish the subject on a sound basis, similar to that of the
geometry of Archimedes. The motive here was to defend the subject from
attacks that had been launched, especially by Bishop George Berkeley
(1685 1753) in a 1734 tract titled The Analyst. Berkeley did not deny
the utility of the techniques of fluxions or the validity of the results
obtained by using these, but he had been nettled on having a sick friend
refuse spiritual consolation because Halley had convinced the friend of
the untenable nature of Christian doctrine. Hence, the subtitle of the
Analyst reads,</p>
<p>Or a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician 〔presumably
Halley〕. Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and
Inferences of the Modern Analysis are More Distinctly Conceived, or More
Evidently Deduced, than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith. “First
Cast the Beam Out of Thine Own Eye; and Then Shalt Thou See Clearly to
Cast Out the Mote Out of Thy Brother’s Eye.”</p>
<p>Berkeley’s account of the method of fluxions was quite fair, and his
criticisms were well taken. He pointed out that in finding either
fluxions or the ratios of differentials, mathematicians first assume
that increments are given to the variables and then take the increments
away by assuming them to be zero. The calculus, as then explained,
seemed to Berkeley to be only a compensation of errors. Thus, “by virtue
of a twofold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet at the
truth.” Even Newton’s explanation of fluxions in terms of prime and
ultimate ratios was condemned by Berkeley, who denied the possibility of
a literally “instantaneous” velocity in which distance and time
increments have vanished to leave the meaningless quotient 0/0. As he
expressed it,</p>
<p>And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments.
And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither
finite</p>
<p>C olin Mac laur in</p>
<p>quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we
not call them ghosts of departed quantities?</p>
<p>It was to answer such criticisms that Maclaurin wrote his Treatise of
Fluxions in the rigorous manner of the ancients, but in doing so, he
used a geometric approach that is less suggestive of the new
developments that were to feature the analysis of Continental Europe.
Perhaps this is not unrelated to the fact that Maclaurin was almost the
last significant mathematician in Great Britain during the eighteenth
century, a time when analysis, rather than geometry, was on the crest of
the wave. Nevertheless, the Treatise of Fluxions contained a number of
relatively new results, including the integral test for convergence of
infinite series (given earlier by Euler in 1732 but generally
overlooked).</p>
<p>After Maclaurin and De Moivre died, British mathematics suffered an
eclipse, so that despite the recognition accorded mathematical
achievement in England up to that time, development of mathematics there
failed to match the rapid strides taken elsewhere in Europe during the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Cramer’s Rule</p>
<p>If today the name of Maclaurin is recalled in connection with a
series of which he was not the first discoverer, this is compensated for
by the fact that a contribution he made bears the name of someone else
who discovered and printed it later. The well-known Cramer’s rule,
published in 1750 by Gabriel Cramer (1704 1752), was probably known to
Maclaurin as early as 1729, the time when he was composing an algebra
intended as commentary on Newton’s Arithmetica Universalis. The
Maclaurin Treatise of Algebra was published in 1748, two years after the
author had died, and in it, the rule for solving simultaneous equations
by determinants appeared, two years earlier than in Cramer’s
Introduction a` l’analyse des lignes courbes alge´briques. The solution
for y in the system</p>
<p>ax1by5c</p>
<p>dx1ey5f</p>
<p>is given as</p>
<p>af 2dc y5: ae2db</p>
<p>The solution for z in the system</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ax1by1cz5m dx1ey1fz5n</p>
<p>:gx1hy1kz5p</p>
<p>is expressed as</p>
<p>aep2ahn1dhm2dbp1gbn2gem z5: aek 2ahf 1dhc2dbk 1gbf 2gec</p>
<p>Maclaurin explained that the denominator consists, in the former
case, of “the Difference of the Products of the opposite Coefficients
taken from the Orders that involve the two unknown Quantities” and, in
the latter case, “of all the Products that can be made of the three
opposite Coefficients taken from the Orders that involve the three
unknown Quantities.” The numerators in Maclaurin’s patterns differ from
the denominators merely in the substitution in the former of the
constant terms for the coefficients of the terms in the unknown sought.
He explained how to write out the solution similarly for four equations
in four unknowns, “prefixing contrary signs to those that involve the
Products of two opposite Coefficients.” This statement shows that
Maclaurin had in mind a rule for alternations in sign akin to that now
ordinarily described in terms of the inversion principle.</p>
<p>Maclaurin’s posthumous Treatise of Algebra enjoyed an even wider
popularity than his other works, with a sixth edition appearing in
London in 1796. The world nevertheless seems to have learned of the
solution of simultaneousequations by determinantsmorethrough
Cramerthanthrough Maclaurin, mainly, we suspect, because of the
superiority of Cramer’s notation, in which superscripts were attached to
literal coefficients to facilitate the determination of signs. Another
possible factor is the previously mentioned alienation of British from
Continental mathematicians. Textbooks</p>
<p>Maclaurin and others had composed good textbooks on an elementary
level. Maclaurin’s Treatise of Algebra went through half a dozen
editions from 1748 to 1796. A rival Treatise of Algebra by Thomas
Simpson (1710 1761) boasted at least eight editions in London from 1745
to 1809; another, Elements of Algebra, by Nicholas Saunderson (1682
1739), enjoyed five editions between 1740 and 1792.</p>
<p>Simpson was a self-taught genius who won election to the Royal
Society in 1745, but whose turbulent life ended in failure half a dozen
years later. His name nevertheless is preserved in the so-called
Simpson’s rule, published in his Mathematical Dissertations on Physical
and Analytical Subjects (1743), for approximate quadratures using
parabolic arcs, but this result had appeared in somewhat different form
in 1668 in the Exercitationes geometricae of James Gregory. Saunderson’s
life, by contrast, was an example of personal triumph over an enormous
handicap—total blindness from the age of one, resulting from an attack
of smallpox.</p>
<p>Algebra textbooks of the eighteenth century illustrate a tendency
toward increasingly algorithmic emphasis, while at the same time
there</p>
<p>Rigor and P r o gr e s s</p>
<p>remained considerable uncertainty about the logical bases for the
subject. Most authors felt it necessary to dwell at length on the rules
governing multiplications of negative numbers, and some categorically
rejected the possibility of multiplying two negative numbers. The
century was, par excellence, a textbook age in mathematics, and never
before had so many books appeared in so many editions. Simpson’s Algebra
had a companion volume, Elements of Plane Geometry, which went through
five editions from 1747 to 1800. But among the host of textbooks of the
time, few achieved quite the record of the edition by Robert Simson
(1687 1768) of the Elements of Euclid. This work, by a man trained in
medicine who became a professor in mathematics at the University of
Glasgow, first appeared in 1756, and by 1834, it boasted a twenty-fourth
English edition, not to mention translations into other languages or
geometries more or less derived from it, for most modern English
versions of Euclid are heavily indebted to it.</p>
