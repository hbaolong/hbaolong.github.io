<h4 id="the-era-and-the-sources">The Era and the Sources</h4>
<p>The intellectual activity of the river valley civilizations in Egypt
and Mesopotamia had lost its verve well before the Christian era, but as
learning in the river valleys declined, and as bronze gave way to iron
in weaponry, vigorous new cultures sprang up all along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. To indicate this change in the centers of
civilization, the interval from roughly 800 BCE to 800 CE is sometimes
known as the Thalassic Age (that is, the “sea” age). There was no sharp
disruption to mark the transition in intellectual leadership from the
valleys of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers to the shores of the
Mediterranean. Egyptian and Babylonian scholars continued to produce
papyrus and cuneiform texts for many centuries after 800 BCE, but a new
civilization meanwhile was rapidly preparing to take over scholarly
hegemony, not only around the Mediterranean but, ultimately, in the
chief river valleys as well. To</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>The Era and t he S ource s</p>
<p>indicate the source of the new inspiration, the first portion of the
Thalassic Age is labeled the Hellenic era, so that the older cultures
are consequently known as pre-Hellenic. The Greeks of today still call
themselves Hellenes. Greek history is traceable back into the second
millennium BCE, when several waves of invaders pressed down from the
north. They brought with them no known mathematical or literary
tradition. They seem to have been very eager to learn, however, and it
did not take them long to improve on what they absorbed. It is presumed
that some rudiments of computation traveled along trade routes. This is
true of the early Greek alphabets that had been taken over and expanded
from the existing alphabet of the Phoenicians, which consisted only of
consonants. The alphabet seems to have originated between the Babylonian
and Egyptian worlds, possibly in the region of the Sinai Peninsula,
through a process of drastic reduction in the number of cuneiform or
hieratic symbols. This alphabet found its way to the new colonies—
Greek, Roman, and Carthaginian—through the activities of traders. Before
long, Greek traders, businessmen, and scholars made their way to the
centers of learning in Egypt and Babylonia. There they made contact with
pre-Hellenic mathematics, but they were not willing merely to receive
long-established traditions, for they made the subject so thoroughly
their own that it soon took a drastically different form.</p>
<p>The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE, and by then, an
absorbing Greek literature had already developed. Of Greek mathematics
at the time we know nothing. Presumably, it lagged behind the
development of literary forms; the latter lend themselves more readily
to continuity of oral transmission. It would be almost another two
centuries before there was any word, even indirectly, concerning Greek
mathematics.Then,duringthesixthcenturyBCE,thereappearedtwomen,Thales and
Pythagoras, to whom are ascribed definite mathematical discoveries. They
are somewhat indistinct figures, historically. No mathematical
masterpiece from either one has survived, nor is it even established
that either Thales or Pythagoras ever composed such a work.
Nevertheless, the earliest Greek accounts of the history of mathematics,
which no longer survive, ascribed to Thales and Pythagoras a number of
very definite discoveries in mathematics. We outline these
contributionsin this chapter,
butthereadershouldunderstandthatitislargelypersistenttradition,rather
than any extant historical document, on which the account is based.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this situation prevails regarding any written
mathematical treatises or other works throughout the fifth century BCE.
There are virtually no extant mathematical or scientific documents until
we encounter those from the days of Plato in the fourth century BCE.
Nevertheless, during the last half of the fifth century, there
circulated persistent and consistent reports concerning a handful of
mathematicians who evidently were intensely concerned with problems that
formed the basis for most of the later developments in geometry. We
shall therefore refer to this period as the “Heroic Age of Mathematics,”
for seldom, either before or since, have men with so little to work with
tackled mathematical problems of such fundamental significance. No
longer was mathematical activity centered almost entirely in two regions
nearly at opposite ends of the Greek world; it flourished all around the
Mediterranean. In what is now southern Italy, there were Archytas of
Tarentum (born ca. 428 BCE) and Hippasus of Metapontum (fl. ca. 400
BCE); at Abdera in Thrace, we find Democritus (born ca. 460 BCE); nearer
the center of the Greek world, on the Attic peninsula, there was Hippias
of Elis (born ca. 460 BCE); and in nearby Athens, there lived at various
times during the pivotal last half of the fifth century BCE three
scholars from other regions: Hippocrates of Chios (fl. ca. 430 BCE),
Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (fl. 428 BCE), and Zeno of Elea (fl. ca. 450
BCE). Through the work of these seven men, we shall describe the
fundamental changes in mathematics that took place a little before the
year 400 BCE. Again, we must remember that although the histories of
Herodotus and Thucydides and the plays of Aeschylus, Euripides, and
Aristophanes have in some measure survived, scarcely a line is extant of
what was written by mathematicians of the time.</p>
<p>Firsthand mathematical sources from the fourth century BCE are almost
as scarce, but this inadequacy is made up for in large measure by
accounts written by philosophers who were au courant with the
mathematics of their day. We have most of what Plato wrote and about
half of the work of Aristotle; with the writings of these intellectual
leaders of the fourth century BCE as a guide, we can give a far more
dependable account of what happened in their day than we could about the
Heroic Age.</p>
