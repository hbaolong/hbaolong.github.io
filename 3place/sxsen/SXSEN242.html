<h4 id="integration-and-measure">Integration and Measure</h4>
<p>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis on rigor had
led numerous mathematicians to bring forth examples of
“pathological”</p>
<p>Int e grat ion and Me a sur e</p>
<p>functions that, because of some unusual property, violated a theorem
previously held to be generally valid. There was concern among some
distinguished analysts that a preoccupation with such special cases
would divert younger mathematicians from seeking answers to the major
open questions of the day. Hermite said that he turned away “with fright
and horror from this lamentable plague of functions which have no
derivatives.” Poincare shared his teacher’s concern:´</p>
<p>Formerly, when one invented a new function it was in view of some
practical goal; today one invents them expressly to point out flaws in
the reasoning of our fathers and one will never derive anything from
them but that. (Translated from a quotation in Saks, 1964)</p>
<p>Yet through the study of unusual cases and the questioning of their
elders, two younger French mathematicians arrived at the definitions of
concepts that were to be fundamental to the development of some of the
most general theories of twentieth-century mathematics. Henri Lebesgue
(1875 1941) had had the usual type of mathematical training, although he
had shown exceptional irreverence in questioning statements made by his
professors and supplemented his course work with library studies,
including the work of Camille Jordan (1838 1922) and Rene´ Baire (1874
1934), among others. His dissertation, accepted in 1902, was most
unusual in virtually remaking the field of integration. His work was so
great a departure from accepted views that Lebesgue, like Cantor, at
first was assailed by both external criticism and internal self-doubt,
but the value of his views was increasingly recognized, and in 1910, he
was appointed to the Sorbonne. He did not create a “school of thought,”
however, nor did he concentrate on the field that he had opened.
Although his concept of the integral was in itself a striking case of
generalization, Lebesgue feared that “Reduced to general theories,
mathematics would be a beautiful form without content. It would quickly
die.” Later developments seem to indicate that his fears concerning the
baneful influence of generality in mathematics were without
foundation.</p>
<p>The Riemann integral had dominated studies in integration before
Lebesgue became the “Archimedes of the extension period.” But toward the
close of the nineteenth century, studies in trigonometric series and the
Mengenlehre of Cantor had made mathematicians more keenly aware that the
essential idea in functionality should be a pointwise correspondence or
“mapping” in the newer sense and not smoothness of variation. Cantor had
even struggled with notions of measurable sets, but under his
definition, the measure of the union of two sets could be less than the
sum of the measures of the sets. Defects in Cantor’s definition were
removed by E´mile Borel (1871 1956), the immediate predecessor of
Lebesgue in studies on measure theory.</p>
<p>Borel, from 1909 until 1941 the holder of a chair for theory of
functions at the Sorbonne and, from 1921, a chair in probability and
mathematical physics, was also a multifaceted administrator. He
succeeded Jules Tannery as deputy director of the E´cole Normale
Superieure, a´ position he held for ten years; in the 1920s, he founded
the Institute for Statistics at the University of Paris and, in 1929,
the Institut Henri Poincare. Having served in the military and run a
government office´ during World War I at the request of Painleve, he
returned to public´ service as member of the Chamber of Deputies from
1925 to 1936, championed the European Union, and served as minister of
the navy until his arrest in 1940 under the Vichy regime. His record in
mathematical publication before 1924 had been impressive and included
more than half a dozen books. One of the earlier volumes had been on an
unusual theme: Lec¸ons sur les series divergentes´ (1901). Here, the
author showed how for some divergent series, a “sum” can be defined that
will make sense in relationships and operations involving such series.
For example, if the series is Σun, then a “sum” can be defined as
x0exΣN0 unxn=n!dx if this integral exists. During the first decades of
this Ðcentury, there was lively interest in such definitions, but
Borel’s more lasting influence was in the application of the theory of
sets to the theory of functions, where his name is recalled in the
familiar Heine-Borel theorem:</p>
<p>If a closed set of points on a line can be covered by a set of
intervals so that every point of the set is an interior point of at
least one of the intervals, then there exists a finite number of
intervals with this covering property.</p>
<p>In somewhat different terminology, this theorem had been expressed by
Heine in 1872, but it had been overlooked until reenunciated in 1895 by
Borel. Borel’s name is also attached to any set that can be obtained
from closed and open sets on the real line by repeated applications of
the operations of union and intersection to denumerable numbers of sets.
Any Borel set is a measurable set in his sense.</p>
<p>Lebesgue, pondering Borel’s work on sets, saw that Riemann’s
definition of the integral has the drawback of applying only in
exceptional cases, for it assumes not more than a few points of
discontinuity in the function. If a function y5f(x) has many points of
discontinuity, then, as the interval xi1 1 2xi becomes smaller, values
of f(xi1 1) and f(xi) do not necessarily become closer together. Instead
of subdividing the domain of the independent variable, Lebesgue
therefore subdivided the range f 2 f of the function into subintervals
Δyi and within each subinterval selected a value ηi. Then, he found the
“measure” m(Ei) of the set Ei of points on the x-axis for which values
of f(x) are approximately equal to ηi. As Lebesgue liked to express the
difference informally, the earlier</p>
<p>Int e grat ion and Me a sur e</p>
<p>integrators had added indivisibles, large or small, in order from
left to right, whereas he preferred to group together indivisibles of
comparable size before adding. That is, for the earlier Riemann sums
Sn5Σ fðxiÞΔxi he substituted the Lebesgue-type sum Sn5ηimðEiÞ and then
let the intervals tend toward zero.</p>
<p>The Lebesgue integral that we have here very roughly described is in
actuality defined far more precisely in terms of upper and lower bounds
and the Lebesgue measure of a set; an illustrative example may suggest
how the Lebesgue procedures operate. Let it be granted that the Lebesgue
measure of all rational numbers in the interval 〔0,1〕 is zero and that
the Lebesgue measure of all irrational numbers in this interval is 1;
let the integral of f(x) be required over this interval, where f(x) is
zero for all rational values of x and f(x) is 1 for all irrational
values of x. Inasmuch as m(Ei)50 for all values of i except i5n, where
ηn 51, we have Sn 501 01 η1 nm(En)51151; hence, the Lebesgue integral is
1. The Riemann integral of the same function over the same interval does
not, of course, exist.</p>
<p>The word “measure” can take on various meanings. When Lebesgue
presented his new concept of the integral, he used the word in the
specific sense now known as the Lebesgue measure. This was an extension
of classical notions of length and area to sets more general than those
associated with the usual curves and surfaces. Today the word “measure”
is used more broadly still, a measure on a field R being simply a
nonnegative function μ with the property μðUAiÞ5ΣμðAiÞ for every
countable disjoint class Ai contained in R. Not only does the new
concept of integral cover a wider class of functions than does that of
Riemann, but the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration (in Lebesgue’s generalized sense) is subject to fewer
exceptions. For example, if g(x) is differentiable in 〔a, b〕 and if gu
(x)5f(x) is bounded, then f(x) is Lebesgue integrable and gðxÞ2gðaÞ5LÐxa
fðtÞdt, whereas with theRÐ ð Þ same restrictions on g(x) and gu(x) the
Riemann integral xa f t dt might not even exist.</p>
<p>Lebesgue’s ideas date from the closing years of the nineteenth
century, but they became widely known through his two classic treatises:
Lec¸ons sur les series trigonometriques´ (1903) and Lec¸ons sur
l’integration´ et la recherche des fonctions primitives (1904). The
revolutionary views they contained paved the way for further
generalizations. Among these are the Denjoy integral and the Haar
integral, proposed by a Frenchman, Arnaud Denjoy (1884 1974), and a
Hungarian, Alfred Haar (1885 1933), respectively. Another well-known
integral of the twentieth century is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, a
combination of the ideas of Lebesgue and the Dutch analyst T.-J.
Stieltjes (1856 1894). The work of these men and others so altered the
concept of the integral, through generalization, that it has been said
that although integration is as old as the time of Archimedes, “the
theory of integration was a creation of the twentieth century.” Word of
the new theory spread. For example, N. N. Luzin (1883 1950), who had
spent most of his time during the years 1910 1914 in Go¨ttingen,
introduced many of the new ideas to Moscow on his return.</p>
<p>Functional Analysis and GeneralTopology</p>
<p>The new theories of integration were closely allied with another
pronounced characteristic of the twentieth century: the rapid growth of
point set topology. At the University of Paris, Maurice Frechet (1878´
1973), in his doctoral dissertation of 1906, showed clearly that
function theory no longer could do without a very general view of set
theory. What Frechet had in mind were not necessarily sets of numbers
but sets of´ elements of arbitrary nature, such as curves or points; on
such arbitrary sets, he built a “functional calculus,” in which a
functional operation is defined on a set E when to each element A of E
there corresponds a numerically determined value U(A). His interest was
not in a particular instance of a set E, but in those set-theoretical
results that are independent of the nature of the set elements. In this
very broad calculus, the notion of limit is much broader than limits as
previously defined, the latter being included in the former as special
cases, just as the Lebesgue integral includes the integrals of Riemann
and Cauchy. Probably no aspect of twentieth-century mathematics stands
out more clearly than does the ever-greater degree of generalization and
abstraction. From the time of Hilbert and Frechet, the notions of
abstract set and abstract´ space have been fundamental in research.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Hilbert and Frechet came to their
gen-´ eralizations of the concept of space from somewhat differing
directions. Hilbert had become interested, as had Poincare, in the study
of integral´ equations, especially through the work of Ivar Fredholm
(1866 1927). In a sense, an integral equation can be considered an
extension of a system of n equations in n unknowns to a system of
infinitely many equations in infinitely many unknowns, a topic that had
been touched on, in the form of infinite determinants, by Helge von Koch
(1870 1924). As Hilbert worked in integral equations from 1904 to 1910,
he did not explicitly refer to infinite dimensional spaces, but he did
develop the concept of continuity of a function of infinitely many
variables. To what extent Hilbert formally constructed the “space” that
later was named for him may be a moot point, but the basic ideas were
there, and their impact on the mathematical world was great. His work on
integral equations was soon extended to more general functions and
abstract spaces by Friedrich Riesz (1880 1956) and Ernst Fischer (1875
1959).</p>
<p>During the years that Hilbert was concerned with integral equations,
Jacques Hadamard was doing research in the calculus of variations,
and</p>
<p>F unc t ional A nal y s i s and General Top olo g y</p>
<p>his student Frechet consciously sought in 1906 to generalize the
methods´ in this field through what he called functional calculus.
Whereas the ordinary calculus deals with functions, the functional
calculus concerns functionals. Whereas a function is a correspondence
between a set S1 of numbers and another set S2 of numbers, a functional
is a correspondence between a class C1 of functions and another class C2
of functions. Frechet´ formulated generalized definitions, corresponding
roughly to terms such as “limit,” “derivative,” and “continuity” in the
ordinary calculus, applicable to the function spaces he thus created, to
a considerable extent introducing a new vocabulary for the new
situation. Shortly thereafter, this would intrigue the group of young
Russians about to put their own stamp on the evolving subject of
topology; that includes the Luzin students P. S. Aleksandrov (1896
1982), Pavel Uryson (1898 1924), and A. N. Kolmogorov (1903 1987).</p>
<p>Topology is said by some to have begun with the analysis situs of
Poincare; others claim that it dates from the set theory of Cantor or
per-´ haps from the development of abstract spaces. Still others regard
Brouwer as the founder of topology, especially for his topological
invariance theorems of 1911 and for his fusion of the methods of Cantor
with those of analysis situs. At all events, with Brouwer there began
the period of intensive evolution of topology that has continued to the
present day. During this “golden age” of topology, American
mathematicians have been conspicuous contributors. It has been said that
“topology began as much geometry and little algebra, but that now it is
much algebra and little geometry.” Whereas once topology could be
described as geometry without measurement, algebraic topology came to
dominate the field, a change that resulted largely from leadership in
the United States.</p>
<p>Hermann Weyl (1885 1955), lecturing on Riemann surfaces at
Go¨ttingen, also emphasized the abstract nature of a surface, or a
“twodimensional manifold,” as he preferred to call it. The concept of a
manifold, he asserted, should not be tied to a point space (in the usual
geometric sense) but given broader meaning. We merely begin with a
collection of things called “points” (which can be any objects
whatsoever) and introduce a concept of continuity through appropriate
definition. The classical formulation of this view was given a year
later by Felix Hausdorff (1868 1942), the “high priest” of point set
topology. The first portion of Hausdorff’s Grundzu¨ge der Mengenlehre
(Basic Features of Set Theory) of 1914 is a systematic exposition of the
characteristic features of set theory, where the nature of elements is
of no consequence; only the relations among the elements are important.
In the latter portion of the book, we find a clear-cut development of
“Hausdorff topological spaces” from a set of axioms. By a topological
space, the author understands a set E of elements x and certain subsets
Sx known as neighborhoods of x. The neighborhoods are assumed to satisfy
the following four “Hausdorff axioms”:</p>
<p>1.To each point x there corresponds at least one neighborhood U(x),
and each neighborhood U(x) contains the point x.</p>
<p>2.If U(x) and V(x) are two neighborhoods of the same point x, there
must exist a neighborhood W(x) that is a subset of both.</p>
<p>3.If the point y lies in U(x), there must exist a neighborhood U/(y)
that is a subset of U(x).</p>
<p>4.For two different points x and y, there are two neighborhoods U(x)
and U(y) with no points in common.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods, as so defined, permitted Hausdorff to introduce the
concept of continuity. Through additional axioms, he developed the
properties of various more restricted spaces, such as the Euclidean
plane.</p>
<p>If any one book marks the emergence of point set topology as a
separate discipline, it is Hausdorff’s Grundzu¨ge. It is interesting to
note that although it was the arithmetization of analysis that began the
train of thought that led from Cantor to Hausdorff, in the end the
concept of number is thoroughly submerged under a far more general point
of view. Moreover, although the word “point” is used in the title, the
new subject had as little to do with the points of ordinary geometry as
with the numbers of common arithmetic. This was underlined by Zygmunt
Janiszewski (1888 1920), Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1888 1945), and the
indefatigable Waclaw Sierpinski (1882 1969), the founders, in 1920, of
Fundamenta Mathematicae. When the journal that seemed at times to carry
nothing but contributions to point set topology was resurrected after
World War II, the cover noted that it was devoted to set theory,
mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics, topology and its
interactions with algebra, and dynamical systems. Here and elsewhere,
topology came to the fore in the twentieth century as one of the
subjects that appeared to unify almost the whole of mathematics,
providing it with an unexpected cohesiveness.</p>
<h2 id="algebra">Algebra</h2>
<p>The high degree of formal abstraction that had found its way into
analysis, geometry, and topology in the early twentieth century could
not help but invade algebra. The result was a new type of algebra,
sometimes inadequately described as “modern algebra,” largely a product
of the third decade of the century. It is indeed true that a gradual
process of generalization in algebra had developed during the nineteenth
century, but in the twentieth century, the degree of abstraction took a
sharp turn upward. For example, in 1903, the American Leonard Eugene
Dickson (1874 1954), E. H. Moore’s first student, published an axiomatic
definition of a linear</p>
<h2 id="algebra-1">Algebra</h2>
<p>associative algebra over an abstract field. Next, Dickson, J. H. M.
Wedderburn (1882 1948), who spent the year 1904 1905 in Chicago, and
others published a series of papers dealing with various aspects of
hypercomplexnumbersystemsandfinitealgebras.Thebestknownoftheseisone by
Wedderburn, in which he abstracted his subject from dependence on a
specific number field, thereby takingit beyondthe work done by
Frobenius, Theodor Molien (1861 1941), and Elie Cartan (1869 1951) on
the Continent. Wedderburn here presented his influential structure
theorems. These state the following:</p>
<p>1.Any algebra can be expressed as the sum of a nilpotent and
asemisimple algebra.</p>
<p>2.Any semisimple algebra that is not simple is the direct sum of
simplealgebras.</p>
<p>3.Any simple algebra is the direct product of a primitive algebra and
asimple matrix algebra.</p>
<p>Another paper of great influence in the trend to abstraction was
Ernst Steinitz’s (1871 1928) work on the algebraic theory of fields,
which appeared in the winter of 1909 1910 and had been motivated by Kurt
Hensel’s (1861 1941) work on p-adic fields. Analogous work in ring
theory was first undertaken by A. Fraenkel (1891 1965), who had been a
student of Hensel’s. Following his work, Emmy Noether, in 1921,
transferred decomposition theorems for ideals in algebraic number fields
to those for ideals in arbitrary rings. On the basis of this work,
Wolfgang Krull (1899 1971) published a series of papers on the algebraic
theory of rings, in which he carried out the analogy to Steinitz’s
memoir on fields. Noether and her students made other major
contributions to ring theory before she turned to a treatment of finite
group representations from an ideal-theoretic point of view. By now,
Noether’s work and that of her students overlapped with related work of
Richard Brauer (1901</p>
<p>1977), Emil Artin (1898 1962), B. L. van der Waerden (1903 1996), and
Helmut Hasse (1898 1979). Simultaneously, Wedderburn and the American
school continued their generalizations. Against this background of
increased activity in abstract ring theory and hypercomplex systems
theory, Artin published a generalization of the Wedderburn structure
theorems to rings satisfying chain conditions. Chain conditions had been
used since the days of Otto Ho¨lder (1859 1937) and Dedekind but were
brought to the fore in the 1921 paper of Emmy Noether just mentioned.
Through Noether’s influence, these algebraic notions were linked to
topology in the work of Heinz Hopf (1894 1971) and Pavel Aleksandrov,
both of whom had obtained their topological orientation from L. E. J.
Brouwer.</p>
<p>Differential Geometry andTensorAnalysis</p>
<p>Early-twentieth-century differential geometry would make an
interesting case study for examining the impact of external forces on
changing attitudes toward a branch of mathematics. The joint papers of
Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (1853 1925) and Tullio Levi-Civita (1873 1941)
on Ricci-Curbastro’s absolute calculus provided a fitting summary of
late-nineteenth-century accomplishments in differential geometry. The
subject had reached a certain plateau; workers in the field made minor
contributions, interesting alternatives were formulated, and complex
computational results were modified and simplified—yet altogether it was
a field apparently doomed to be of interest only to the specialist. This
changed dramatically after the announcement by Albert Einstein (1879
1955) of his theory of general relativity. In 1915, he presented the
discovery of his gravitational equations by noting that it marked “a
true triumph of the methods of the general differential calculus founded
by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci” (Sitzungsbericht der Preussischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1915:778 786).</p>
<p>Interest in the general theory of relativity led to a spate of
publications designed to clarify or expand both the theory of general
relativity and differential geometry. In 1916, the German set theorist
Gerhard Hessenberg (1874 1925) had introduced the concept of a
connection. Levi-Civita introduced his concept of parallelism in 1917
and, in the early 1920s, lectured at the University of Rome on the
subject that he continued to call the absolute differential calculus; he
published a systematic exposition in 1923. Just one year earlier, Dirk
Struik (1894 2000), a student of, and a collaborator with, the Dutch
differential geometer J. A. Schouten (1883 1971), had issued a volume on
the elements of multidimensional differential geometry; it was followed
in 1924 by a treatise on the Ricci-Curbastro calculus by Schouten
himself. Simultaneously, a group of books by mathematicians and
physicists appeared that combined the exposition of known principles
with new contributions to the physical interpretation and the
mathematical theory. Among the best known of these works published
between 1916 and 1925 were those by the Americans G. D. Birkhoff and R.
D. Carmichael (1879 1967), the Englishman A. S. Eddington (1882 1944),
and the Germans Max von Laue and Hermann Weyl. Although some of these
volumes were brilliant examples of exposition, treating as clearly as
possible a subject the mathematical basis of which was wrapped up in a
cumbersome theory, their very popularity among the scientifically and
philosophically oriented reading public did much to spread the notion of
the incomprehensibility of mathematics and mathematical physics. For
more than a generation, relatively few mathematicians were aware that
the seeds of a new approach to differential geometry had already been
sown.</p>

<p>When Hermann Weyl left his position as privatdozent in Go¨ttingen in
1913 to accept a professorship at the University of Zurich, he had just
completed a period of immersion in the mathematics of Riemann. In the
winter of 1911 1912, he had lectured on Riemann’s function theory; his
stated theme was to base Riemann’s work not on “visualizable
plausibility” but on set-theoretically exact proofs meeting requirements
of rigor. The outgrowth of this was Weyl’s classic book on the concept
of the Riemann surface, completed in April 1913. New concepts and
definitions, such as the introductory one of a complex manifold, made
this small work basic to much subsequent research on manifolds. Weyl
spent more time on Riemannian geometry after his move to Zurich and
during World War I. He explored the concept of a linear connection,
thinking for some time that linking this to the group of similitudes
might result in a unified field theory. A set of classical papers on the
theory of linear representations of Lie groups written in the mid-1920s
was partially an outgrowth of this work. In the meantime, Elie Cartan,
who had begun his career with the study of Lie groups, revamped
differential geometry.</p>
<p>Cartan, early in his research work, had developed the calculus of
exterior differential forms. He shaped it into a powerful tool that he
applied to differential geometry, as well as to many other areas of
mathematics. In his approach to differential geometry, he expanded the
nineteenth-century notion of a “moving frame” that had been used by
Gaston Darboux 1842 1917), among others. His main achievements were
based on the use of two concepts he fashioned: One was his definition of
a connection, which was widely adopted by differential geometers. The
other was the notion of a symmetric Riemann space. In such a space, each
point is assumed to be surrounded by a symmetry, that is, a certain
distance-preserving transformation that leaves the point fixed. Cartan
had earlier succeeded in classifying simple real Lie algebras and in
determining the irreducible linear representations of simple Lie
algebras. It turns out that the classification of simple Lie groups can
be applied to the description of symmetric Riemann spaces.</p>
<p>Among Cartan’s contribution to other areas of mathematics, we note
only his important work in the theory of differential systems. Here,
too, he was able to abstract the traditional problem from a choiceof
variables or functions, by defining a truly “general” solution of an
abstract system. He then turned his attention to seeking all singular
solutions; this work was completed by Masatake Kuranishi four years
after Cartan’s death.</p>
