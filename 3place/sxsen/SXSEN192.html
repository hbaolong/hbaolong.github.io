<h4 id="the-parallel-postulate-lambert">The Parallel Postulate:
Lambert</h4>
<p>Many mathematicians, including Euler, have also fancied themselves
philosophers. Euler missed an opportunity that another philosophically
inclined Swiss mathematician tried to exploit. This was Johann Heinrich
Lambert (1728 1777), a Swiss-German writer on a wide variety of
mathematical and nonmathematical themes, who for a couple of years was
an associate of Euler’s at the Berlin Academy. It is said that when
Frederick the Great asked him which science he was most proficient in,
Lambert curtly replied, “All.”</p>
<p>We have seen that Saccheri had believed that he had demolished the
possibilities that the sum of the angles of a plane triangle might be
more or less than two right angles. Lambert called attention to the
well-known fact that on the surface of a sphere, the angle sum of a
triangle is indeed more than two right angles, and he suggested that a
surface might be found on which the triangle angle sum falls short of
two right angles. In trying to complete what Saccheri had attempted—a
proof that denial of</p>
<p>T he Parallel Po s tulat e: L amb er t</p>
<p>Euclid’s parallel postulate leads to a contradiction—Lambert, in
1766, wrote Die Theorie der Parallellinien, although this appeared,
posthumously, only in 1786. Instead of beginning with a Saccheri
quadrilateral, he adopted as his starting point a quadrilateral having
three right angles (now known as a Lambert quadrilateral) and then
considered for the fourth angle the three possibilities, namely, that it
might be acute, right, or obtuse. Corresponding to these three cases, he
showed, in the manner of Saccheri, that the angle sum of a triangle
would be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than two right
angles. Going beyond Saccheri, he demonstrated that the extent to which
the sum falls short of, or exceeds, two right angles is proportional to
the area of the triangle. In the obtuse-angled case, this situation is
similar to a classical theorem in spherical geometry—that the area of a
triangle is proportional to its spherical excess—and Lambert speculated
that the hypothesis of the acute angle might correspond to a geometry on
a novel surface, such as a sphere of imaginary radius. In 1868, it was
shown by Eugenio Beltrami (1835 1900) that Lambert had indeed been
correct in his conjecture of the existence of some such surface. It
turned out to be, however, not a sphere with an imaginary radius but a
real surface known as a pseudosphere, that is, a surface of constant
negative curvature generated by revolving the tractrix above its
axis.</p>
<p>Although Lambert, like Saccheri, tried to prove the parallel
postulate, he seems to have been aware of his lack of success. He
wrote,</p>
<p>Proofs of the Euclidean postulate can be developed to such an extent
that apparently a mere trifle remains. But a careful analysis shows that
in this seeming trifle lies the crux of the matter; usually it contains
either the proposition that is being proved or a postulate equivalent to
it.</p>
<p>No one else came so close to the truth without actually discovering
non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Lambert is also known today for other contributions. One of these is
the first proof, presented to the Berlin Academy in 1761, that π is an
irrational number. (In 1737, Euler had shown that e is irrational.)
Lambert showed that if x is a nonzero rational number, then tan x cannot
be rational. Inasmuch as tan π/451, a rational number, it follows that
π/4 cannot be a rational number, hence neither can π. This did not, of
course, dispose of the circle-squaring question, for quadratic
irrationalities are constructible. At about this time, circle-squarers
had become so numerous that the Academy in Paris passed a resolution in
1775 that no purported solutions of the quadrature problem would be
officially examined.</p>
<p>As another of Lambert’s contributions to mathematics, we should
recall that he did for the hyperbolic functions what Euler had done for
the circular functions, providing the modern view and notation.
Comparisons of the ordinates of the circle x2 1y2 51 and of the
hyperbola x2 2y2 51 had fascinated mathematicians for a century, and by
1757, Vincenzo Riccati had suggested a development of hyperbolic
functions. It remained for Lambert to introduce the notations sinh x,
cosh x, and tanh x for the hyperbolic equivalents of the circular
functions of ordinary trigonometry and to popularize the new hyperbolic
trigonometry that modern science finds so useful. Corresponding to
Euler’s three identities for sin x, cos x, and eix, there are three
similar relationships for the hyperbolic functions expressed by the
equations</p>
<p>ex 2ex ex 1ex</p>
<p>sinhx5; coshx5</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>and ex 5coshx1sinhx:</p>
<p>Lambert also wrote on cosmography, descriptive geometry, map making,
logic, and the philosophy of mathematics, but his influence did not
match that of Euler or of d’Alembert, whose work we shall consider in
the next chapter.</p>
