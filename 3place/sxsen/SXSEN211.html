<h4 id="number-theory">Number Theory</h4>
<p>While still a student in Go¨ttingen, Gauss had begun work on a major
publication in number theory. Appearing two years after his doctoral
dissertation, the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is one of the great
classics of mathematical literature. It consists of seven sections.
Culminating in two</p>
<p>Numb er T he or y</p>
<p>proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, the first four sections
are essentially a tightened recasting of eighteenth-century number
theory. Fundamental in the discussion are the concepts of congruence and
residue class. Section 5 is devoted to the theory of binary quadratic
forms, specifically the question of solutions for equations of the form
ax2 1 2bxy1cy2 5m; the techniques developed in this section became the
basis for much work done by later generations of number theorists.
Section 6 consists of various applications. The last section, which
initially drew the most attention, deals with the solution of the
general cyclotomic equation of prime degree.</p>
<p>Gauss called the law of quadratic reciprocity, which Legendre had
published a couple of years earlier, the theorema aureum, or the gem of
arithmetic. In his later work, Gauss sought to find comparable theorems
for congruences xn p(mod q) for n53 and 4, but for these cases, he found
it necessary to extend the meaning of the word “integer” to include the
so-called Gaussian integers, that is, numbers of the form a1bi, where a
and b are integers. The Gaussian integers form an integral domain like
that of the real integers but more general. Problems in divisibility
become more complicated, for 5 no longer is a prime, being factorable
into the product of the two “primes” 112i and 122i. In fact, no real
prime of the form 4n11 is a “Gaussian prime,” whereas real primes of the
form 4n21 remain primes in the generalized sense. In the Disquisitiones,
Gauss included the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, one of the basic
principles that continues to hold in the integral domain of Gaussian
integers. In fact, any integral domain for which factoring is unique is
known today as a Gaussian integral domain. One of the contributions of
the Disquisitiones was a rigorous proof of the theorem, known since the
days of Euclid, that any positive integer can be represented in one and
only one way (except for the order of the factors) as a product of
primes.</p>
<p>Not all that Gauss discovered about prime numbers is contained in the
Disquisitiones. On the back page of a copy of a table of logarithms that
he had obtained as a boy of fourteen is written cryptically in
German:</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>Primzahlen unter að5NÞ: 1a</p>
<p>This is a statement of the celebrated prime number theorem: the
number of primes less than a given integer a approaches asymptotically
the quotient a/ln a as a increases indefinitely. The odd thing is that
if Gauss wrote this, as we presume he did, he kept this beautiful result
to himself. We do not know whether he had a proof of the theorem or even
when the statement was written.</p>
<p>In 1845, a Parisian professor, Joseph L. F. Bertrand (1822 1900),
guessed that if n.3, there is always at least one prime between n and 2n
(or, more precisely, 2n22) inclusive. This conjecture, known as
Bertrand’s postulate, was proved in 1850 by Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev
(1821 1894) of the University of St. Petersburg. Chebyshev was a rival
of Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevsky as the leading Russian mathematician of
his day and became a foreign associate of the Institut de France and of
the Royal Society of London. Chebyshev, evidently unaware of Gauss’s
work on primes, was able to show that if π(n)(ln n)/n approaches a limit
as n increases indefinitely, this limit must be 1, but he could not
demonstrate the existence of a limit. Not until two years after
Chebyshev’s death was a proof generally known. Then, in 1896, two
mathematicians, working independently, came up with demonstrations in
the same year. One was the Belgian mathematician C. J. de la
Valle´ePoussin (1866 1962), who lived to be almost ninety-six; the other
was a Frenchman, Jacques Hadamard (1865 1963), who was almost
ninetyeight when he died.</p>
<p>Problems on the number and the distribution of primes have fascinated
many mathematicians from Euclid’s day to our own. What may be regarded
as a deep and difficult corollary to Euclid’s theorem on the infinity of
primes was proved by the mathematician who in 1855 was to succeed Gauss
at Go¨ttingen. This was Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805 1859), the
man who did more than anyone else to amplify the Disquisitiones. The
Dirichlet theorem states not only that the number of prime numbers is
infinite, but that if one considers only those integers in an arithmetic
progression a, a1b, a12b,…, a1nb, in which a and b are relatively prime,
then even in this relatively sparser subset of the integers, there still
will be infinitely many primes. The proof Dirichlet gave required
complicated tools from analysis, where Dirichlet’s name is again
preserved in the Dirichlet test for uniform convergence of a series.
Among Dirichlet’s other contributions was the first proof of Bertrand’s
postulate. It should be noted that Dirichlet’s theorem showed that the
discrete domain of the theory of numbers cannot be studied in isolation
from the branch of mathematics dealing with continuous variables—that
is, that number theory requires the aid of analysis. Gauss himself, in
the Disquisitiones, had given a striking example of the fact that the
properties of prime numbers intrude in the most unexpected ways even
into the realm of geometry.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Disquisitiones, Gauss included the first
important discovery he had made in mathematics: the construction of the
regular polygon of seventeen sides. He carried the topic to its logical
conclusion by showing which of the infinitely many possible regular
polygons can be constructed and which cannot. General theorems, such as
that which Gauss now proved, are of ever so much more value than a
single case, no matter how spectacular the single case may be. It will
be recalled that Fermat had believed that numbers of the form 22n11 are
primes, a conjecture that Euler had shown to be incorrect. The number
22211517 is indeed prime, as are also 223115257 and</p>
<p>Re cept ion of t he Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</p>
<p>224 11565;537. Gauss had already shown the polygon of seventeen sides
to be constructible, and the question naturally arises whether a regular
polygon of 257 or 65,537 sides can be constructed with Euclidean tools.
In the Disquisitiones, Gauss answered the question in the affirmative,
showing that a regular polygon of N sides can be constructed with
Euclidean tools if and only if the number N is of the form N52mplp2p3 …
pr, where m is any positive integer and the p’s are distinct Fermat
primes. There remains one aspect of the problem that Gauss did not
answer, and that has not yet been answered. Is the number of Fermat
primes finite or infinite? For n55, 6, 7, 8, and 9, it is known that the
Fermat numbers are not prime, and it appears possible that there are
five and only five constructible regular polygons of a prime number of
sides, two that were known in antiquity and the three that were
discovered by Gauss. A young man whom the aging Gauss admired, Ferdinand
Gotthold Eisenstein (1823 1852), an instructor of mathematics at Berlin,
added a new conjecture about prime numbers when he hazarded the thought,
unverified up to the present time, that numbers of</p>
<p>2 the form 22 11; 222 11; 222 11, and so on, are primes. To Gauss is
attributed the remark that “There have been only three epoch-making
mathematicians, Archimedes, Newton, and Eisenstein.” Whether, given a
normal span of years, Eisenstein might have fulfilled such a glowing
prediction is a matter of conjecture, for the young privatdozent died
when he was not yet thirty years old.</p>
<p>Reception of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</p>
<p>Many mathematicians introducing new methods or concepts have found
that these are viewed with skepticism until it becomes clear not only
that they are useful in obtaining new results but that they so far
exceed existing techniques as to make it worthwhile for a mature
researcher to learn them. Gauss, too, found this to be true in the case
of his great book on number theory. It created little initial attention;
only the algebraic contribution of the last section was noted with
approbation by French authors of the time. One of the very few
individuals who initiated a correspondence with Gauss for the purpose of
exchanging ideas about the number-theoretic aspects of the book was a
certain “Monsieur Leblanc”; this turned out to be Sophie Germain, a
mathematician who worked outside the established institutions that were
closed to women. Germain earned the respect and assistance not only of
Gauss but of Lagrange and Legendre; the latter attached her name to a
theorem that marks a major step in the three-century marathon effort to
prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. In another field, the Paris Academy of
Sciences awarded her a prize for a memoir on the mathematical theory of
elastic surfaces.</p>
<p>In general, however—and despite the availability in Paris of a French
translation after 1807—Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae lay dormant
until the late 1820s, when C. G. J. Jacobi (1804 1851) and P. G. Lejeune
Dirichlet first brought to light some of the deeper consequences to be
derived from the work.</p>
