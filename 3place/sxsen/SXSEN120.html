<h4 id="thomas-bradwardine">Thomas Bradwardine</h4>
<p>The late medieval physicists comprised a large group of university
teachers and churchmen, but we call attention to only two, for these
were also</p>
<p>T homa s Bra d war dine</p>
<p>prominent mathematicians. The first is Thomas Bradwardine (1290?
1349), a philosopher, a theologian, and a mathematician who rose to the
position of Archbishop of Canterbury; the second is Nicole Oresme (1323?
1382), a Parisian scholar who became the Bishop of Lisieux. To these two
men was due a broadened view of proportionality.</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid had included a logically sound theory of
proportion, or the equality of ratios, and this had been applied by
ancient and medieval scholars to scientific questions. For a given time,
the distance covered in uniform motion is proportional to the speed, and
for a given distance, the time is inversely proportional to the
speed.</p>
<p>Aristotle had thought, none too correctly, that the speed of an
object subject to a moving force acting in a resisting medium is
proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the resistance.
In some respects, this formulation seemed to later scholars to
contradict common sense. When force F is equal to or less than
resistance, a velocity V will be imparted according to the law V 5KF /
R, where K is a nonzero constant of proportionality, but when resistance
balances or exceeds force, one should expect no velocity to be acquired.
To avoid this absurdity, Bradwardine made use of a generalized theory of
proportions. In his Tractatus de proportionibus of 1328, Bradwardine
developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally,
what we would call “n-tuple” proportion. His arguments are expressed in
words, but in modern notation we would say that in these cases,
quantities vary as the second or third or nth power. In the same way,
the theory of proportions included subduple or subtriple or subn-tuple
proportion, in which quantities vary as the second or third or nth
root.</p>
<p>Now Bradwardine was ready to propose an alternative to the
Aristotelian law of motion. To double a velocity that arises from some
ratio or proportion F/R, he said, it was necessary to square the ratio
F/R; to triple the velocity, one must cube the “proportio,” or ratio
F/R; to increase the velocity n-fold, one must take the nth power of the
ratio F/R. This is tantamount to asserting that velocity is given, in
our notation, by the relationship V5KlogF/R, for log(F/R)n 5nlogF/R.
That is, if V0 5logF0 /R0, then Vn 5log(F0 /R0)n 5nlogF0 /R0 5nV0.
Bradwardine himself evidently never sought experimental confirmation of
his law, and it seems not to have been widely accepted.</p>
<p>In addition, Bradwardine wrote several other mathematical works, all
pretty much in the spirit of the times. His Arithmetic and his Geometry
show the influence of Boethius, Aristotle, Euclid, and Campanus.
Bradwardine, known in his day as “Doctor profundus,” was also attracted
to topics such as the angle of contact and star polygons, both of which
occur in Campanus and earlier works. Star polygons, which include
regular polygons as special cases, go back to ancient times. A star
polygon is formed by connecting with straight lines every mth point,
starting from a given one, of the n points that divide the circumference
of a circle into n equal parts, where n.2 and m is prime to n. There is
in the Geometry even a touch of Archimedes’ Measurement of the Circle.
The philosophical bent in all of Bradwardine’s works is seen most
clearly in the Geometrica speculativa and the Tractatus de continuo, in
which he argued that continuous magnitudes, although including an
infinite number of indivisibles, are not made up of such mathematical
atoms but are instead composed of an infinite number of continua of the
same kind. His views are sometimes said to resemble those of the modern
intuitionists; at any rate, medieval speculations on the continuum,
popular among Scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, later
influenced the Cantorian infinite of the nineteenth century.</p>
