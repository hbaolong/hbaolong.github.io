<h4 id="girard-desargues-and-projective-geometry">Girard Desargues and
Projective Geometry</h4>
<p>The great developments in mathematics during the days of Descartes
and Fermat were in analytic geometry and infinitesimal analysis. It is
likely that the very success in these branches made men of the time
relatively oblivious to other aspects of mathematics. We already have
seen that Fermat found no one to share his fascination with the theory
of numbers; pure geometry likewise suffered a wholly undeserved neglect
in the same period. The Conics of Apollonius had once been among
Fermat’s favorite works, but analytic methods redirected his views.
Meanwhile, the Conics had attracted the attention of a practical man
with a very impractical imagination—Girard Desargues, an architect and a
military engineer of Lyons. For some years, Desargues had been in Paris,
where he was part of the group of mathematicians that we have been
considering, but his very unorthodox views on the role of perspective in
architecture and geometry met with little favor, and he returned to
Lyons to work out his new type of mathematics largely by himself. The
result was one of the most unsuccessful great books ever produced. Even
the ponderous title repelled—Brouillon projet d’une atteinte aux
e´ve´nemens des rencontres d’un cone avec un plan (Paris, 1639). This
may be translated as Rough Draft of an Attempt to Deal with the Outcome
of a Meeting of a Cone with a Plane, the prolixity of which stands in
sharp contrast to the brevity and simplicity of Apollonius’s title
Conics. The thought on which Desargues’ work is based, nevertheless, is
simplicity itself—a thought derived from perspective in Renaissance art
and from Kepler’s principle of continuity. Everyone knows that a circle,
when viewed obliquely, looks like an ellipse or that the outline of the
shadow of a lampshade will be a circle or a hyperbola according as it is
projected on the ceiling or a wall. Shapes and sizes change according to
the plane</p>
<p>Girar d D e s ar gue s and P r oje c t i v e Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>of incidence that cuts the cone of visual rays or of light rays, but
certain properties remain the same throughout such changes, and it is
these properties that Desargues studied. For one thing, a conic section
remains a conic section no matter how many times it undergoes a
projection. The conics form a single close-knit family, as Kepler had
suggested for somewhat different reasons. But in accepting this view,
Desargues had to assume, with Kepler, that the parabola has a focus “at
infinity” and that parallel lines meet at “a point at infinity.” The
theory of perspective makes such ideas plausible, for light from the sun
is ordinarily considered to be made up of rays that are
parallel—composing a cylinder or a parallel pencil of rays—whereas rays
from a terrestrial light source are treated as a cone or a point
pencil.</p>
<p>Desargues’ treatment of the conics is beautiful, although his
language is unconventional. He called a conic section a “coup de
rouleau” (i.e., incidence with a rolling pin). About the only one of his
many new terms that has survived is the word “involution”—that is, pairs
of points on a line the
productofwhosedistancesfromafixedpointisagivenconstant.Hecalled
pointsinharmonicdivisionafour-pointinvolution,andheshowedthatthis
configuration is projectively invariant, a result known, under a
different point of view, to Pappus. Because of its harmonic properties,
the complete quadrangle played a large role in Desargues’ treatment, for
he knew that
whensuchaquadrangle(asABCDinFig.15.10)isinscribedinaconic,the line
through two of the diagonal points (E, F, and G in Fig. 15.10) is the
polarline,withrespecttotheconic,ofthethirddiagonalpoint.Heknew,of
course, that the intersections with the conic of the polar of a point
with respect to the conic were the points of contact of the tangents
from the point to the conic, and instead of defining a diameter
metrically, Desargues introduced it as the polar of a point at infinity.
There is a pleasing unity in Desargues’ treatment of the conics through
projective methods, but it was too thorough a break with the past to
meet with acceptance.</p>
<p>Desargues’ projective geometry had a tremendous advantage in
generality over the metric geometry of Apollonius, Descartes, and
Fermat, for many special cases of a theorem blend into one
all-inclusive</p>
<p>statement. Yet mathematicians of the time not only failed to accept
the methods of the new geometry, they actively opposed them as dangerous
and unsound. So rare were copies of Desargues’ Brouillon projet that by
the end of the century, all copies had disappeared, for Desargues
published his works not to sell but to distribute to friends. The work
was completely lost until in 1847, a handwritten copy made by Philippe
de Lahire, one of Desargues’ few admirers, was found in a Paris library.
Even today, the name of Desargues is familiar not as that of the author
of the Brouillon projet but for a proposition that does not appear in
the book, the famous theorem of Desargues:</p>
<p>If two triangles are so situated that lines joining pairs of
corresponding vertices are concurrent, then the points of intersection
of pairs of corresponding sides are collinear, and conversely.</p>
<p>This theorem, which holds for either two or three dimensions, was
first published in 1648 by Desargues’ devoted friend and follower
Abraham Bosse (1602 1676),anengraver.Itappears in a book withthe title
Maniere` universelle de S. Desargues, pour pratiquer la perspective. The
theorem, which Bosse explicitly attributed to Desargues, became, in the
nineteenth century, one of the fundamental propositions of projective
geometry. Note that whereas in three dimensions the theorem is an easy
consequence of incidence axioms, the proof for two dimensions requires
an additional assumption.</p>
