<h4 id="luca-paciolis-summa">Luca Pacioli’s Summa</h4>
<p>The earliest Renaissance algebra, that of Chuquet, was the product of
a Frenchman, but the best-known algebra of that period was published ten
years later in Italy. In fact, the Summa de Arithmetica, Geometrica,
Proportioni et Proportionalita of the friar Luca Pacioli (1445 1514)
overshadowed the Triparty so thoroughly that older historical accounts
of algebra leap directly from the Liber abaci of 1202 to the Summa of
1494 without mentioning the work of Chuquet or other intermediaries.</p>
<p>The way for the Summa, however, had been prepared by a generation of
algebraists, for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi was translated into Italian
at least by 1464, the date of a manuscript copy in the Plimpton
Collection in New York; the writer of this manuscript stated that he
based his work on numerous predecessors in this field, naming some from
the earlier fourteenth century. The Renaissance in science is often
assumed to have been sparked by the recovery of ancient Greek works, but
the Renaissance in mathematics was especially characterized by the rise
of algebra, and in this respect, it was but a continuation of the
medieval tradition.</p>
<p>TheSumma,thewritingofwhichhadbeencompletedby1487,wasmore influential
than it was original. It is an impressive compilation (with sources of
information not generally indicated) of material in four fields:
arithmetic, algebra, very elementary Euclidean geometry, and doubleentry
bookkeeping. Pacioli (also known as Luca di Borgo) for a time had been a
tutor to the sons of a wealthy merchant in Venice, and he was
undoubtedly familiar with the rising importance of commercial arithmetic
in Italy. The earliest printed arithmetic, appearing anonymously at
Treviso in 1478, had featured the fundamental operations, the rules of
two and three, and business applications. Several more technical
commercial arithmetics appeared shortly thereafter, and Pacioli borrowed
freely from them. One of these, the Compendia de lo abaco of Francesco
Pellos (fl. 1450 1500), which was published at Torino in the year
Columbus discovered America, made use of a dot to denote the division of
an integer by a power of 10, thus adumbrating our decimal point.</p>
<p>The Summa, which like the Triparty was written in the vernacular, was
a summing up of unpublished works that the author had composed earlier,
as well as of general knowledge at the time. The portion on arithmetic
is much concerned with devices for multiplication and for finding square
roots; the section on algebra includes the standard solution of linear
and quadratic equations. Although it lacks the exponential notation of
Chuquet, there is increased use of syncopation through abbreviations.
The letters p and m were by this time widely used in Italy for addition
and subtraction, and Pacioli used co, ce, and ae for cosa (the unknown),
censo (the square of the unknown), and aequalis, respectively. For the
fourth power of the unknown, he naturally used cece (for square-square).
Echoing a sentiment of Omar Khayyam, he believed that cubic equations
could not be solved algebraically.</p>
<p>Pacioli’s work in geometry in the Summa was not significant, although
some of his geometric problems remind one of the geometry of
Regiomontanus, specific numerical cases being employed. Although
Pacioli’s geometry did not attract much attention, so popular did the
commercial aspect of the book become that the author is generally
regarded as the father of double-entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Pacioli, the first mathematician of whom we have an authentic
portrait, in 1509 tried his hand twice more at geometry, publishing an
undistinguished</p>
<p>Ger man A lgeb ra s and Ar i t hme t ic s</p>
<p>edition of Euclid and a work with the impressive title De Divina
Proportione. The latter concerns regular polygons and solids and the
ratio later known as “the golden section.” It is noteworthy for the
excellence of the figures, which have been attributed to Leonardo da
Vinci (1452 1519). Leonardo is frequently thought of as a mathematician.
In his notebooks, we find quadratures of lunes, constructions of regular
polygons, and thoughts on centers of gravity and on curves of double
curvature, but he is best known for his application of mathematics to
science and the theory of perspective. Hundreds of years later,
Renaissance notions on mathematical perspective were to blossom into a
new branch of geometry, but these developments were not perceptibly
influenced by the thoughts that the lefthanded Leonardo entrusted to his
notebooks in the form of mirror-written entries. Da Vinci is pictured as
the typical all-round Renaissance man, and in fields other than
mathematics, there is much to support such a view. Leonardo was a genius
of bold and original thought, a man of action as well as contemplation,
at once an artist and an engineer. Yet he appears not to have been in
close touch with the chief mathematical trend of the time—the
development of algebra.</p>
