<h4 id="aryabhata">Aryabhata</h4>
<p>During the sixth century, shortly after the composition of the
Siddhantas, there lived two Indian mathematicians who are known to have
written books on the same type of material. The older and more important
of the two was Aryabhata, whose best-known work, written around 499 CE
and titled Aryabhatiya, is a slim volume, written in verse, covering
astronomy and mathematics. The names of several Hindu mathematicians
before this time are known, but nothing of their work has been preserved
beyond a few fragments. In this respect, then, the position of the
Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata in India is somewhat akin to that of the
Elements of Euclid in Greece some eight centuries earlier. Both are
summaries of earlier developments, compiled by a single author. There
are, however, more striking differences than similarities between the
two works. The Elements is a well-ordered synthesis of pure mathematics
with a high degree of abstraction, a clear logical structure, and an
obvious pedagogical inclination; the Aryabhatiya is a brief descriptive
work, in 123 metrical stanzas, intended to supplement rules of
calculation used in astronomy and mensurational mathematics, with no
appearance of deductive methodology. About a third of the work is on
ganitapada, or mathematics. This section opens with the names of the
powers of 10 up to the tenth place and then proceeds to give
instructions for square and cube roots of integers. Rules of mensuration
follow, about half of which are erroneous. The area of a triangle is
correctly given as half the product of the base and altitude, but the
volume of a pyramid is also taken to be half of the product of the base
and the altitude. The area of a circle is found correctly as the product
of the circumference and half of the diameter, but the volume of a
sphere is incorrectly stated to be the product of the area of a great
circle and the square root of this area. Again, in the calculation of
areas of quadrilaterals, correct and incorrect rules appear side by
side. The area of a trapezoid is expressed as half of the sum of the
parallel sides multiplied by the perpendicular between them, but then
follows the incomprehensible assertion that the area of any plane figure
is found by determining two sides and multiplying them. One statement in
the Aryabhatiya to which Indian scholars have pointed with pride is as
follows:</p>
<p>Add 4 to 100, multiply by 8, and add 62,000. The result is
approximately the circumference of a circle of which the diameter is
20,000. (Clark 1930, p. 28)</p>
<p>Here we see the equivalent of 3.1416 for π, but it should be recalled
that this is essentially the value Ptolemy had used. The likelihood that
Aryabhata here was influenced by Greek predecessors is strengthened by
his adoption of the myriad, 10,000, as the number of units in the
radius.</p>
<p>A typical portion of the Aryabhatiya is that involving arithmetic
progressions, which contains arbitrary rules for finding the sum of the
terms in a progression and for determining the number of terms in a
progression when given the first term, the common difference, and the
sum of the terms. The first rule had long been known by earlier writers.
The second is a curiously complicated bit of exposition:</p>
<p>Multiply the sum of the progression by eight times the common
difference, add the square of the difference between twice the first
term, and the common difference, take the square root of this, subtract
twice the first term, divide by the common difference, add one, divide
by two. The result will be the number of terms.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere in the Aryabhatiya, no motivation or justification
is given for the rule. It was probably arrived at through a solution of
a quadratic equation, knowledge of which might have come from
Mesopotamia or Greece. Following some complicated problems on compound
interest (that is, geometric progressions), the author turns, in flowery
language, to the very elementary problem of finding the fourth term in a
simple proportion:</p>
<p>In the rule of three multiply the fruit by the desire and divide by
the measure. The result will be the fruit of the desire.</p>
<p>Numeral s</p>
<p>This, of course, is the familiar rule that if a/b5c/x, then x5bc/a,
where a is the “measure,” b the “fruit,” c the “desire,” and x the
“fruit of the desire.” The work of Aryabhata is indeed a potpourri of
the simple and the complex, the correct and the incorrect. The Arabic
scholar alBiruni, half a millennium later, characterized Indian
mathematics as a mixture of common pebbles and costly crystals, a
description quite appropriate to Aryabhatiya.</p>
