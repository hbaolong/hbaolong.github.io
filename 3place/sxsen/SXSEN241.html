<h4 id="david-hilbert">David Hilbert</h4>
<p>David Hilbert (1862 1943), like Immanuel Kant (1724 1804), had been
born in Ko¨nigsberg in East Prussia, but, unlike Kant, he traveled
widely, especially to attend the international congresses of
mathematicians that had become so characteristic of this century. Except
for a semester spent at the University of Heidelberg, where he studied
under the analyst Lazarus Fuchs (1833 1902), Hilbert obtained his
mathematical training at the University of Ko¨nigsberg. The main
professor for mathematics there was Heinrich Weber (1842 1913), who had
been encouraged to turn to the study of abstract concepts in algebra and
number theory by Dedekind. Weber presented some of the first abstract
definitions for groups and fields in the 1880s and 1890s and was the
author of a well-known and influential three-volume textbook of algebra
and the coauthor, with Dedekind, of the important paper on algebraic
functions mentioned in chapter 23. In 1883, Weber left Ko¨nigsberg. His
successor, F. Lindemann, had just published his proof of the
transcendence of π. Lindemann suggested to Hilbert his doctoral thesis
topic in invariant theory and encouraged Hilbert’s early work in this
field. Hilbert’s interest in invariants was further stimulated by two
men closer to his own age, of whom he saw a great deal in the 1880s.
They were Adolf Hurwitz, who had studied with Felix Klein and joined
Lindemann on the Ko¨nigsberg faculty in 1884, and Hermann Minkowski
(1864 1909), who, although still a student, in April 1893 won the “Grand
Prix des Sciences Mathematiques” awarded by the Paris Academy of Sci-´
ences for his essay on the decomposition of integers into the sum of
five squares. Hurwitz’s early work dealt with number-theoretic and
geometric questions. Most of the research he did in Ko¨nigsberg applied
Riemannian function-theoretic methods to problems in algebra,
specifically to algebraic functions. In 1892, he left Ko¨nigsberg for
Zurich, where he spent the rest of his life, making important
contributions to the theory of algebraic numbers and number fields.
Minkowski obtained his doctorate in July 1885, a few months after
Hilbert. His thesis dealt with investigations of quadratic forms using
methods introduced by Dirichlet. Hilbert was the “opponent” in debating
the thesis with Minkowski at the latter’s public promotion. As will be
seen, Minkowski and Hilbert remained close friends.</p>
<p>Invariant Theory</p>
<p>Hilbert worked predominantly in invariant theory until 1892; his most
important contributions to that subject were published in 1890 and 1893.
To understand their place in the history of invariant theory, it is
useful to follow Hilbert’s own account of that theory, which he prepared
for the International Mathematical Congress in Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>For three decades after Boole, Cayley, and Sylvester’s early work on
invariant theory, much time was spent on computing specific invariants.
Aside from the English mathematicians previously mentioned, leading
contributors to this activity were Clebsch and Siegfried Heinrich
Aronhold (1819 1884), who discovered invariants for ternary cubic forms
and established a “symbolic” method for computing. To systematize this
work, it was proposed to find a complete system, or basis, of
invariants; that is, given a form of x of degree n, to find the smallest
number of rational integral invariants and covariants so that any other
rational integral invariant or covariant could be expressed as a
rational integral form with numerical coefficients of the complete set.
Paul Gordan (1837 1912), a professor of mathematics at the University of
Erlangen, proved the existence of a finite complete set for binary
forms. He showed that every binary form has a finite complete system of
invariants and covariants and that any finite system of binary forms has
such a system. Gordan’s proof was cumbersome but showed how the complete
system could be computed; in 1886, Franz Mertens (1840 1927) provided a
more streamlined inductive proof, which did not exhibit the system.
Hilbert’s famous result of 1888, known as his “basis theorem,” was far
more general. It was published as theorem I of a paper “On the Theory of
Algebraic Forms” in the Mathematische Annalen in 1890. As was customary,
Hilbert defined an algebraic form as an integral rational homogeneous
function in certain variables whose coefficients are numbers in a
certain “domain of rationality.” The theorem states that for any
infinite sequence S5F1, F2, F3,… of forms in n variables x1, x2,…, xn,
there exists a number m such that any form of that sequence can be
expressed as</p>
<p>F5A1F1 1A2F2 1?1AmFm;</p>
<p>where the Ai are forms in the same n variables. Hilbert applied this
result to the proof for the existence of a finite full system of
invariants for systems of forms in arbitrarily many variables. In a
subsequent influential paper, published in 1893, “On a Full System of
Invariants,” Hilbert developed his new methods for attacking problems in
invariant theory. He stressed that his approach was fundamentally
different from that of his predecessors because he treated the theory of
algebraic invariants as part of the general theory of algebraic function
fields.</p>
<p>“Zahlbericht”</p>
<p>The three-year period 1892 1895 brought major changes in Hilbert’s
life. He had begun his academic career as a privatdozent in Ko¨nigsberg
in 1886, having spent the year after his doctorate on a study trip, part
of the time in Leipzig to visit Felix Klein and part in Paris to meet
Charles Hermite. In 1892, he became Hurwitz’s successor as an associate
(“extraordinary”) professor in Ko¨nigsberg; he married the same year.
Already the next year, on Lindemann’s departure for Munich, Hilbert was
made a full (“ordinary”) professor. Yet, he stayed in Ko¨nigsberg only
until 1895, for in that year Heinrich Weber, who had left Ko¨nigsberg
for Go¨ttingen twelve years earlier, now followed a call to Strassburg.
Felix Klein arranged to have Hilbert succeed Weber at Go¨ttingen, and
since then, his name has been linked with that center of mathematical
activity, where he resided for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>At the 1893 meeting of the German Mathematical Society, Hilbert and
Minkowski were asked to write a report on number theory for the
Jahresbericht of that organization. The resulting work by Hilbert on
“The Theory of Algebraic Number Fields” became a classic; it is commonly
referred to as the “Zahlbericht.” Minkowski, who was working on his
Geometry of Numbers at that time, withdrew from the project, although he
provided Hilbert with crucial comments on his manuscript, as he did with
most of Hilbert’s manuscripts up to his untimely death in 1909.</p>
<p>In the introduction to his “Zahlbericht,” Hilbert expressed a point
of view that was to become typical of his work and his influence. It is
characterized by emphasis on the abstraction, arithmetization, and
logical development of mathematical concepts and theories. Noting that
while number theory has the fewest prerequisites necessary for an
understanding of its truths, it had been blamed for requiring a high
degree of abstraction to fully master arithmetic concepts and proof
techniques, Hilbert expressed the opinion that all other branches of
mathematics require at least an equally high degree of abstraction,
provided one subjects the foundation of these branches to the same
rigorous and complete study that is necessary. Next, he stressed the
interrelationship between number theory and algebra, as well as between
number theory and function theory, that had become apparent during the
nineteenth century. He saw the development in mathematics taking place
in his lifetime as being guided by number. According to Hilbert,
Dedekind and Weierstrass’s definition of arithmetic fundamental concepts
and Cantor’s work led to an “arithmetization of function theory,” while
modern investigations on non-Euclidean geometry, with their concern for
a rigorous logical development and a clear introduction of the number
concept, led to an “arithmetization of geometry.” In the body of the
report, Hilbert attempted to present a logical theory of algebraic
number fields. He joined in his comprehensive treatment the work of his
immediate predecessors and contemporaries and also included his own
results. Hilbert contributed a few more papers to this subject in the
1890s; these are his most mature efforts in the direction of obtaining a
generalized law of quadratic reciprocity over a variety of number
fields. With one notable exception, Hilbert produced no more new results
in number theory after the turn of the century, but until World War I,
he continued to supervise doctoral dissertations on number theory,
including those of R. Fueter (1880 1950) and E. Hecke (1887 1947).</p>
<p>The Foundations of Geometry</p>
<p>Hilbert, whose work tended to concentrate on one subject at a time,
turned to geometry after completion of the “Zahlbericht.” In 1894, he
had lectured on non-Euclidean geometry, and in 1898 1899, he presented a
small but celebrated volume titled Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations
of Geometry). This work, translated into numerous languages, exerted a
strong influence on the mathematics of the twentieth century. Through
the arithmetization of analysis and the axioms of Peano, most of
mathematics, except for geometry, had achieved a strict axiomatic
foundation. Geometry in the nineteenth century had flourished as never
before, but it was chiefly in Hilbert’s Grundlagen that an effort was
first made to give it the purely formal character found in algebra and
analysis. Euclid’s Elements did have a deductive structure, but it was
replete with concealed assumptions, meaningless definitions, and logical
inadequacies. Hilbert understood that not all terms in mathematics can
be defined and therefore began his treatment of geometry with three
undefined objects—point, line, and plane—and six undefined relations:
being on, being in, being between, being congruent, being parallel, and
being continuous. In place of Euclid’s five axioms (or common notions)
and five postulates, Hilbert formulated for his geometry a set of
twentyone assumptions, since known as Hilbert’s axioms. Eight of these
concern incidence and include Euclid’s first postulate, four are on
order properties, five are on congruency, three are on continuity
(assumptions not explicitly mentioned by Euclid), and one is a parallel
postulate that is essentially equivalent to Euclid’s fifth postulate.
Following the pioneer work by Hilbert, alternative sets of axioms have
been proposed by others, and the purely formal and deductive character
of geometry, as well as of other branches of mathematics, has been
thoroughly established since the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Hilbert, through his Grundlagen, became the leading exponent of an
“axiomatic school” of thought that has been influential in fashioning
contemporary attitudes in mathematics and mathematical education. The
GrundlagenopenedwithamottotakenfromKant:“Allhumanknowledge begins with
intuitions, proceeds to concepts, and terminates in ideas,” but
Hilbert’s development of geometry established a decidedly antiKantian
view of the subject. It emphasized that the undefined terms in geometry
should not be assumed to have any properties beyond those indicated in
the axioms. The intuitive-empirical level of the older geometric views
must be disregarded, and points, lines, and planes are to be understood
merely as elements of certain given sets. Set theory, having taken over
algebra and analysis, now was invading geometry. Similarly, the
undefined relations are to be treated as abstractions indicating nothing
more than a correspondence or a mapping.</p>
<p>Like the major papers on algebra and number theory discussed
previously, Hilbert’s research on the elements of geometry was partly
instigated by one of the mathematical meetings of the 1890s that he
attended. In 1891, he had heard and been captivated by a talk that H.
Wiener gave at a scientific meeting in Halle on the possibility of
axiomatizing the rules governing the unions and the intersections of
points and lines without regard to the existing (Euclidean) axioms of
geometry. Following this talk, Hilbert is reputed to have stated the
need for the abstraction of familiar geometric concepts in the form:
“One must at all times be able to replace ‘points, lines, planes’ by
‘tables, chairs, beer mugs.’”</p>
<p>The “Hilbert Problems”</p>
<p>Perhaps no contribution to an international congress has been as
celebrated as the one that Hilbert made in his address to the second
congress, held in Paris in 1900. Hilbert’s talk was titled “Mathematical
Problems.” It consisted of an introduction that has become a classic of
mathematical rhetoric, followed by a list of twenty-three problems
designed to serve as examples of the kind of problem whose treatment
should lead to a furthering of the discipline. In fact, on the advice of
Hurwitz and Minkowski, Hilbert cut the spoken version of the talk so
that it contained only ten of the twenty-three problems. Yet the
complete version of the talk, as well as excerpts, were soon translated
and published in several countries. For example, the 1902 volume of the
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society carried an authorized
translation by Mary Winston Newson (1869 1959), a specialist in partial
differential equations, who had been the first American woman to obtain
a Ph.D. degree in mathematics at Go¨ttingen. Although Hilbert objected
to the view that the concepts of arithmetic alone are susceptible of a
fully rigorous treatment, he admitted that the development of the
arithmetic continuum by Cauchy, Bolzano, and Cantor was one of the two
most notable achievements of the nineteenth century—the other being the
non-Euclidean geometry of Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky—and thus the
first of the twenty-three problems concerned the structure of the real
number continuum. The question is made up of two related parts: (1) is
there a transfinite number between that of a denumerable set and the
number of the continuum; and (2) can the numerical continuum be
considered a well-ordered set? The second part asks whether the totality
of all real numbers can be arranged in another manner so that every
partial assemblage will have a first element. This is closely related to
the axiom of choice named for the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo
(1871 1956), who formulated it in 1904. Zermelo’s axiom asserts that
given any set of mutually exclusive nonempty sets, there exists at least
one set that contains one and only one element in common with each of
the nonempty sets. As an illustration of a problem involving Zermelo’s
axiom, consider the set of all real numbers n such that 0 # n # 1; let
us call two of these real numbers equivalent if their difference is
rational. There obviously are infinitely many classes of equivalent real
numbers. If we form a set S made up of one number from each of these
classes, is S denumerable or nondenumerable? The axiom of choice,
indispensable in analysis, was in 1940 proved by Kurt Go¨del (1906 1978)
to be consistent with other axioms of set theory, but in 1963, it was
demonstrated by Paul Cohen (1934 2007) that the axiom of choice is
independent of the other axioms in a certain system of set theory, thus
showing that the axiom cannot be proved within this system. This seems
to preclude a clear-cut solution to Hilbert’s first problem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s second problem, also suggested by the nineteenth-century
age of rigor, involved the question whether it can be proved that the
axioms of arithmetic are consistent—that a finite number of logical
steps based on them can never lead to contradictory results. A decade
later, there appeared the first volume of Principia mathematica (3
vols., 1910 1913), by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead (1861
1947), the most elaborate attempt up to that time to develop the
fundamental notions of arithmetic from a precise set of axioms. This
work, in the tradition of Leibniz, Boole, and Frege and based on Peano’s
axioms, carried out in minute detail a program intended to prove that
all of pure mathematics can be derived from a small number of
fundamental logical principles. This would justify the view of Russell,
expressed earlier, that mathematics is indistinguishable from logic. But
the system of Russell and Whitehead, not entirely formalized, seems to
have met with more approval among logicians than among mathematicians.
Moreover, the Principia left unanswered the second query of Hilbert.
Efforts to solve this problem led in 1931 to a surprising conclusion on
the part of the young Austrian mathematician Kurt Go¨del. Go¨del showed
that within a rigidly logical system such as Russell and Whitehead had
developed for arithmetic, propositions can be formulated that are
undecidable or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system. That is,
within the system there exist certain clear-cut statements that can be
neither proved nor disproved. Hence, one cannot, using the usual
methods, be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not lead to
contradictions. In a sense, Go¨del’s theorem, sometimes regarded as the
most decisive result in mathematical logic, seems to dispose negatively
of Hilbert’s second query. In its implications, the discovery by Go¨del
of undecidable propositions is as disturbing as was the disclosure by
Hippasus of incommensurable magnitudes, for it appears to foredoom hope
of mathematical certitude through use of the obvious methods. Perhaps
also doomed, as a result, is the ideal of science—to devise a set of
axioms from which all phenomena of the natural world can be deduced.
Nevertheless, mathematicians and scientists alike have taken the blow in
stride and have continued to pile theorem on theorem at a rate greater
than ever before. Most assuredly, no scholar of today would echo the
assertion of Babbage in 1813 that “The golden age of mathematical
literature is undoubtedly past.”</p>
<p>The problems raised by Go¨del’s theorem have been approached from
outside arithmetic itself through a new aspect of mathematical logic
that arose toward the middle of the twentieth century and is known as
metamathematics. This is not concerned with the symbolism and the
operations of arithmetic but with the interpretation of these signs and
rules. If arithmetic cannot lift itself from the quagmire of possible
inconsistency, perhaps metamathematics, standing outside the arithmetic
bog, can save the day by other means—such as transfinite induction. Some
mathematicians would at least hope for a means of determining, for every
mathematical proposition, whether it is true, false, or undecidable. In
any case, even the discouragingly negative answer to Hilbert’s second
query has thus spurred, rather than daunted, mathematical
creativity.</p>
<p>The next three problems, problems three, four, and five, were among
those omitted at the actual reading of the paper. Problem three was
geometric; it asks to give two tetrahedra of equal basis and equal
height that cannot be decomposed into congruent tetrahedra, either
directly or by adjoining congruent tetrahedra. As Hilbert noted, this
problem goes back to a question raised by Gauss in his correspondence. A
negative answer was provided by a student of Hilbert’s, Max Dehn (1878
1952), in 1902, and clarified by W. F. Kagan in 1903.</p>
<p>Problem four was formulated somewhat broadly; it asked for geometries
whose axioms are “closest” to those of Euclidean geometry if the axioms
of order and incidence are retained, but the congruence axioms are
weakened and the equivalent of the parallel axiom is omitted. The
earliest answer was provided in a doctoral dissertation by G. Hamel,
another Hilbert student.</p>
<p>The fifth problem was to prove more influential and difficult. It
asked whether one could avoid the assumption of differentiability for
the functions defining a continuous transformation group. This problem
came to be closely tied to the early history of topological groups.
Lie’s continuous transformation groups were locally Euclidean with
differentiable operations. As the concept of a topological group was
made the subject of special studies, first by L. E. J. Brouwer (1882
1966), then by Lev Semenovich Pontryagin (1908 1988), the Hilbert
problem was reformulated to apply to the larger realm of topological
groups: Is a locally Euclidean topological group a Lie group? The
problem and related issues occupied numerous topologists until the
1950s. In the 1930s, John von Neumann solved it for bicompact groups;
Pontryagin, for commutative locallybicompactgroups.C.Chevalley(1909
1984)obtainedtheanswer for solvable groups; in 1946, Anatoly Ivanovich
Malcev (1909 1967) solved it for a still wider set of locally bicompact
groups. By now, the problem had become truly international. In 1952,
three Americans, Andrew Gleason (1921 2008), Deane Montgomery (1909
1992), and Leo Zippin (1905 1995), finally obtained the answer for all
locally bicompact groups.</p>
<p>The sixth problem asked for an axiomatization of physics, a subject
to which Hilbert himself devoted some effort.</p>
<p>Problem seven inquired whether the number αβ, where α is algebraic
(and not zero or 1) and β is irrational and algebraic, is
transcendental. In alternative geometric form, Hilbert expressed this by
asking whether in an isosceles triangle, the ratio of the base to a side
is transcendental if the ratio of the vertex angle to the base angles is
algebraic and irrational. This question was disposed of in 1934 when
Aleksander Osipovich Gelfond (1906 1968) proved that Hilbert’s
conjecture, now known as Gelfond’s theorem, was indeed correct—αβ is
transcendental if α is algebraic and neither zero nor 1, and β is
algebraic and not rational. Later, Alan Baker provided a major
generalization to the Gelfond theorem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s eighth query simply renewed the call, familiar since the
nineteenth century, for a proof of Riemann’s conjecture that the zeros
of the zeta function, except for the negative-integral zeros, all have
real part equal to one half. A proof of this, he felt, might lead to a
proof of the familiar conjecture on the infinity of prime pairs, but no
demonstration has yet been given, although it is more than a century
since Riemann hazarded the guess.</p>
<p>These examples may suffice to indicate the diversity of formulation
and interest of the problems Hilbert chose; let us simply list the
nature of the remaining, which include some of the most intriguing and
have involved a large number of twentieth-century mathematicians.</p>
<p>The ninth problem called for generalizations of the reciprocity laws
of number theory. The tenth was the decision problem for solvability of
Diophantine equations. The eleventh called for extending results
obtained for quadratic fields to arbitrary algebraic fields. The twelfth
asked for an extension of a theorem by Kronecker to arbitrary algebraic
fields.</p>
<p>These number-theoretic problems were followed by the thirteenth,
which asked to show the impossibility of solving the general
seventhdegree equation by functions of two variables; the fourteenth
problem asked about the finiteness of systems of relatively integral
functions; the fifteenth asked for a justification for Hermann
Schubert’s (1848 1911) enumerative geometry.</p>
<p>The sixteenth problem was an invitation to develop a topology of real
algebraic curves and surfaces. The seventeenth asked for the
representation of definite forms by squares; the eighteenth posed the
challenge to build spaces with congruent polyhedra. The nineteenth deals
with the analytic character of solutions of variational problems.
Closely related to this was the twentieth, concerned with general
boundary problems. The twenty-first, which Hilbert himself solved in
1905, asked for the solution of differential equations with a given
monodromy group. The twentysecond was the uniformization problem, and
the final, twenty-third, problem asked for an extension of the methods
of the calculus of variations; in recent years, this has been tied to
research in optimization questions.</p>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Hilbert’s chief contributions to analysis fall in the period between
1900 and World War I. They revolve primarily around the study of
integral equations. His contributions to this subject were preceded,
however, by his “revival” of the Dirichlet principle. As previously
noted, the criticism of the Dirichlet principle had been followed by
only partially successful attempts to show its validity. The last major
effort in this direction had been published by Poincare in 1890, in a
paper containing´ his ingenious “sweeping-out” (balayage) method.
Hilbert proceeded to establish the Dirichlet principle in its most
general form by treating it as a problem in the calculus of variations.
First, he sketched a constructive proof of the existence of minimal
curves; then he showed how the existence of a function minimizing the
Dirichlet region for plane regions could be inferred. This memoir was
followed by a very readable Weierstrassian review of the problem by the
American W. F. Osgood (1864 1943) the following year; in 1904, Hilbert
himself elaborated on his argument in a more detailed paper.</p>
<p>It was during this period, in 1901, that the subject of integral
equations captured Hilbert’s attention. One of his Scandinavian students
presented a seminar report on work done in that field by his professor
in Stockholm, Ivar Fredholm (1866 1927). Hilbert’s results, first
published between 1904 and 1910, were collected in a book that appeared
in 1912 and was designed to present a systematic theory of linear
integral equations. His work was streamlined by Erhard Schmidt (1876
1959). What is interesting in following Hilbert’s progress of the
subject is the interplay between his often rough new approaches and
refinements and generalizations brought to bear by others. Indeed, the
great value of this work nowadays lies in the fact that from it came
many of the twentieth century’s most important ideas basic to the study
of abstract linear spaces and spectra.</p>
<p>Waring’s Problem and Hilbert’s Work after 1909</p>
<p>Perhaps as relief from his rather cumbersome work in integral
equations, Hilbert during this time returned to number theory and proved
Waring’s theorem that every positive integer can be represented as a sum
of at most m nth powers, m being a function of n. This triumph, tempered
by the unexpected death of his good friend Minkowski in 1909, marks the
end of the period during which Hilbert produced his most concentrated,
purely mathematical work.</p>
<p>Hilbert spent much of the next decade on mathematical physics. Until
the beginning of World War I, he studied the application of integral
equations to physical theories such as the kinetic theory of gases. With
the appearance of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity,
Hilbert turned to that subject, which also occupied his colleague Felix
Klein. Interestingly, the most lasting mathematical contribution out of
this effort came from an algebraist who had recently engaged in studies
of differential invariants. This was Emmy Noether (1888 1935), the
daughter of the algebraic geometer Max Noether, whom Hilbert and Klein
brought to Go¨ttingen to assist them in this research. Her results were
published in 1918; best known is “Noether’s theorem,” which is still
referred to in the discussion of correspondences between certain
invariants and conservation laws.</p>
<p>Hilbert had initiated his studies in mathematical physics in the hope
of proceeding to the axiomatization for which he had called in 1900. He
came closest to this goal in his last work on physics, dealing with
quantum mechanics. Because Hilbert had begun to have serious health
problems by this time, this research was conducted in collaboration with
two younger men, L. Nordheim and J. von Neumann.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s major results in his last great effort at the
axiomatization of arithmetic and logic have come to us in the form given
to them by his successors, too. They are contained in the comprehensive
treatises Grundlagen der Mathematik and Grundzu¨geder mathematischen
Logik,betterknown by the names of the coauthors as Hilbert-Bernays and
Hilbert-Ackermann.</p>
