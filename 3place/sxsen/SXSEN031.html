<h4 id="numeration">Numeration</h4>
<p>The Hellenes were celebrated as shrewd traders and businessmen, and
there must have been a lower level of arithmetic or computation that</p>
<p>Numerat ion</p>
<p>satisfied the needs of the vast majority of Greek citizens. Number
activities of this type would have been beneath the notice of
philosophers, and recorded accounts of practical arithmetic were
unlikely to find their way into the libraries of scholars. If, then,
there are not even fragments surviving of the more sophisticated
Pythagorean works, it is clear that it would be unreasonable to expect
manuals of trade mathematics to survive the ravages of time. Hence, it
is not possible to tell at this distance how the ordinary processes of
arithmetic were carried out in Greece 2,500 years ago. About the best
one can do is to describe the systems of numeration that appear to have
been in use.</p>
<p>In general, there seem to have been two chief systems of numeration
in Greece: one, probably the earlier, is known as the Attic (or
Herodianic) notation; the other is called the Ionian (or alphabetic)
system. Both systems are, for integers, based on the 10 scale, but the
former is the more primitive, being based on a simple iterative scheme
found in the earlier Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration and in the later
Roman numerals. In the Attic system, the numbers from 1 to 4 were
represented by repeated vertical strokes. For the number 5 a new
symbol—the first letter Π (or Γ) of the word for five, “pente”—was
adopted. (Only capital letters were used at the time, both in literary
works and in mathematics, lowercase letters being an invention of the
later ancient or early medieval period.) For numbers from 6 through 9,
the Attic system combined the symbol Γ with unit strokes, so that 8, for
example, was written as . For positive integral powers of the base (10),
the initial letters of the corresponding number words were adopted— for
deka (10), for hekaton (100), for khilioi (1,000), and for myrioi
(10,000). Except for the forms of the symbols, the Attic system is much
like the Roman, but it had one advantage. Where the Latin word adopted
distinctive symbols for 50 and 500, the Greeks wrote these numbers by
combining letters for 5, 10, and 100, using (or 5 times 10) for 50, and
(or 5 times 100) for 500. In the same way, they wrote for 5,000 andfor
50,000. In Attic script, the number 45,678, for example, would appear
as</p>
<p>The Attic system of notation (also known as Herodianic, inasmuch as
it was described in a fragment attributed to Herodian, a grammarian of
the second century) appears in inscriptions at various dates from 454 to
95 BCE, but by the early Alexandrian Age, at about the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphius, it was being displaced by the Ionian or alphabetic
numerals. Similar alphabetic schemes were used at one time or another by
various Semitic peoples, including the Hebrews, the Syrians, the
Aramaeans, and the Arabs—as well as by other cultures, such as the
Gothic—but these would seem to have been borrowed from the Greek
notation. The Ionian system probably was used as early as the fifth
century BCE and perhaps as early as the eighth century BCE. One reason
for placing the origin of the notation relatively early is that the
scheme called for twenty-seven letters of the alphabet—nine for the
integers less than 10, nine for multiples of 10 that are less than 100,
and nine for multiples of 100 that are less than 1,000. The classical
Greek alphabet contains only twenty-four letters; hence, use was made of
an older alphabet that included three additional archaic letters— (vau
or digamma or stigma), (koppa), and (sampi)—to establish the following
association of letters and numbers:</p>
<p>After the introduction of small letters in Greece, the association of
letters and numbers appeared as follows:</p>
<p>Because these forms are more familiar today, we shall use them here.
For the first nine multiples of 1,000, the Ionian system adopted the
first nine letters of the alphabet, a partial use of the positional
principle, but for added clarity, these letters were preceded by a
stroke or accent:</p>
<p>Within this system, any number less than 10,000 was easily written
with only four characters. The number 8888, for example, would appear as
or as , the accent sometimes being omitted when the context was clear.
The use of the same letters for thousands as for units should have
suggested to the Greeks the full-fledged positional scheme in decimal
arithmetic, but they do not seem to have appreciated the advantages of
such a move. That they had such a principle more or less in mind is
evident not only in the repeated use of the letters α through θ for
units and thousands, but also in the fact that the symbols are arranged
in order of magnitude, from the smallest on the right to the largest on
the left. At 10,000, which for the Greeks was the beginning of a new
count</p>
<p>Ar i t hme t ic and L o gi s t ic</p>
<p>or category (much as we separate thousands from lower powers by a
comma), the Ionian Greek notation adopted a multiplicative principle. A
symbol for an integer from 1 to 9999, when placed above the letter M, or
after it, separated from the rest of the number by a dot, indicated the
product of the integer and the number 10,000—the Greek myriad. Thus, the
number 88888888 would appear as . Where still larger numbers are called
for, the same principle could be applied to the double myriad, 100000000
or 108. Early Greek notations for integers were not excessively awkward,
and they served their purposes effectively. It was in the use of
fractions that the systems were weak.</p>
<p>Like the Egyptians, the Greeks were tempted to use unit fractions,
and for these they had a simple representation. They wrote down the
denominator and then simply followed this with a diacritical mark or
accent to distinguish it from the corresponding integer. Thus, would
appear as λδ0. This could, of course, be confused with the number 30,
but context or the use of words could be assumed to make the situation
clear. In later centuries, general common fractions and sexagesimal
fractions were in use; these will be discussed below in connection with
the work of Archimedes, Ptolemy, and Diophantus, for there are extant
documents that, while not actually dating from the time of these men,
are copies of works written by them—a situation strikingly different
from that concerning mathematicians of the Hellenic period.</p>
