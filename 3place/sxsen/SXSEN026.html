<h4 id="chapter-22-analysis">Chapter 22 Analysis</h4>
<p>It is the simple hypotheses of which one must be most wary; because
these are the ones that have the most chances of passing unnoticed.</p>
<p>—Poincaré</p>
<p>Berlin and Göttingen at Midcentury</p>
<p>Analysis, the study of infinite processes, had been understood by
Newton and Leibniz to be concerned with continuous magnitudes, such as
lengths, areas, velocities, and accelerations, whereas the theory of
numbers has as its domain the discrete set of natural numbers. We have
nevertheless seen that Bolzano tried to give purely arithmetic proofs of
propositions, such as the location theorem in elementary algebra, that
seemed to depend on properties of continuous functions, and Plücker had
thoroughly arithmetized analytic geometry. The theory of groups had
originally been concerned with discrete sets of elements, but Klein
envisioned a unification of both discrete and continuous aspects of
mathematics under the group concept. The nineteenth century was indeed a
period of correlation in mathematics. The geometric interpretation of
analysis and algebra was one aspect of this tendency; the introduction
of analytic techniques in number theory was another. Toward the end of
the century, the strongest current was that of arithmetization; it
affected algebra, geometry, and analysis.</p>
<p>In 1855, Dirichlet succeeded Gauss in Göttingen. He left in place, in
Berlin, a tradition of lectures on the applications of analysis to
physical problems and number theory. He also left a small group of his
and Jacobi’s friends and students, who continued to influence
mathematics at the academy, in the Journal für die reine und angewandte
Mathematik, and at the university. In Göttingen, mathematical lectures
were less solidly established. As already noted, Gauss’s limited
teaching had usually emphasized subjects such as the method of least
squares that would be useful to his observatory assistants. Most
mathematics proper was taught by one lecturer, Moritz Stern (1807–1894).
Dirichlet sought to emphasize the “true” Gaussian legacy with lectures
on number theory and potential theory.</p>
<p>There were two young men in Göttingen who were to be profoundly
influenced by Dirichlet, although they differed greatly in personality
and mathematical orientation. One was Richard Dedekind; the other,
Bernhard Riemann. When Dirichlet died unexpectedly in 1859, it was
Riemann who succeeded him.</p>
<p>Riemann in Göttingen</p>
<p>When Riemann became a professor in Göttingen, he was no stranger to
that university. He had matriculated there in 1846, spent several
semesters in Berlin to get his mathematical training from Jacobi and
Dirichlet, then returned to Göttingen, obtained good training in physics
from Wilhelm Weber, assisted Weber, obtained his doctoral degree, and
was appointed lecturer (privatdozent) in 1854. His research, as well as
his career, was split between mathematics and physics. By the time he
succeeded Dirichlet, he had published five memoirs; two of these dealt
with problems in physics. A similar division characterized his later
work, yet, conceptually, it is not the division but the commonality of
many concepts that predominates. Riemann was a many-sided mathematician
with a fertile mind, contributing to geometry, the theory of numbers,
and analysis. Having previously touched on some of his geometric and
function-theoretic work, we shall here cite only the example of his
shortest and possibly most famous paper before proceeding to note his
influence on mathematical physics.</p>
<p>Euler had noted connections between prime number theory and the
series</p>
<p>where s is an integer—a special case of the Dirichlet series. Riemann
studied the same series for s a complex variable, the sum of the series
defining a function , which has since been known as Riemann’s zeta
function. One of the tantalizing suggestions that mathematicians have
not yet been able to prove or disprove is the famous Riemann conjecture
that all of the imaginary zeros of the zeta function have real part
.</p>
<p>In analysis, Riemann is recalled for his part in the refinement of
the definition of the integral, for emphasis on the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, and for the Riemann surfaces. These surfaces are an ingenious
scheme for uniformizing a function, that is, representing a one-to-one
mapping of a complex function that in the ordinary Gaussian plane would
be multivalued. Here we see the most striking aspect of Riemann’s work—a
strongly intuitive and geometric background in analysis that contrasts
sharply with the arithmetizing tendencies of the Weierstrassian school.
His approach has been called “a method of discovery,” whereas that of
Weierstrass was “a method of demonstration.” His results were so
significant that Bertrand Russell described him as “logically the
immediate predecessor of Einstein.” It was Riemann’s intuitive genius in
physics and mathematics that produced such concepts as that of the
curvature of a Riemannian space or manifold, without which the theory of
general relativity could not have been formulated.</p>
<p>Mathematical Physics in Germany</p>
<p>There had been several centers of growing activity in mathematical
physics in Germany before Riemann. Beginning in the 1830s, Dirichlet had
introduced the techniques of Fourier and the results of his great French
contemporaries to a large group of students in mathematics and physics
in Berlin. Dirichlet interacted with the Berlin physicists; he had been
a friend of Wilhelm Weber’s years before they became colleagues in
Göttingen. Similarly, in Königsberg, Jacobi had worked closely with the
mathematical physicist Franz Neumann (1798–1895) in research and
teaching. In Leipzig, the new analysis was not yet well represented. but
when the Weber brothers felt the need to consult their mathematical
colleagues, there were no barriers. When Weber involved Riemann in his
electrodynamic investigations in Göttingen, the subject had also been
dealt with in Königsberg; both German traditions drew on the pioneering
work of André-Marie Ampère and Poisson. When Riemann initiated his
influential study of the propagation of sound waves, he elaborated on a
topic that Poisson had furthered in the early years of the century and
on which Dirichlet had frequently lectured in Berlin. It is an important
chapter in the history of the wave equation. Riemann’s approach involved
dealing with a second-order linear differential equation in two
variables and finding a “characteristic” function that satisfied a
certain adjoint partial differential equation. Riemann’s technique has
been widely adopted for hyperbolic equations.</p>
<p>Paul Du Bois Reymond (1831–1889), who had obtained his doctorate in
Berlin just before Dirichlet’s departure, built on Riemann’s work in
obtaining a generalization of Green’s theorem. Hermann Helmholtz
(1821–1894), who came to mathematical physics from a background in
physiology, overlapped with Riemann in acoustical studies. Many of his
notable contributions to the study of sound were included in his popular
work On the Sensations of Tone. The reduced wave equation Δw + k2w = 0
is often called the “Helmholtz equation” because he was the first to
tackle the issue of finding a general solution. The physicist Gustav
Kirchhoff (1824–1887), who was a contemporary of these men, obtained
further significant results in the study of partial differential
equations, particularly the wave equation.</p>
<p>Mathematical Physics in English-Speaking Countries</p>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of English-speaking
men promoted mathematical physics in Great Britain and elsewhere. The
earliest significant nineteenth-century contributions to mathematical
physics across the channel were those of the Irishman William Rowan
Hamilton. When he initiated his studies on dynamics in the 1830s, he
drew heavily on concepts he had developed while establishing a
mathematical theory of optics in the late 1820s. Key to his method was
the introduction of variational principles into the treatment of certain
partial differential equations. He built on work by Lagrange and Poisson
but utilized physical principles established earlier. Jacobi, working
out his own dynamics in the 1830s, recast Hamilton’s innovative ideas
and called attention to them in the context of his own theory. The
result is now known as the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Hamilton’s primary
champion was the Scottish physicist Peter Guthrie Tait (1831–1901).
Among Tait’s mathematical contributions are early studies of knots; in
this, he followed a little-known line of research by Gauss and Listing,
prompted by electrodynamic investigations. His name came to be known to
generations in linkage with that of William Thomson through the classic
Treatise on Natural Philosophy, usually simply referred to as “T and T”
or “T and T′.” This work, which first appeared in 1867, went through
several editions. Although it does not make for light reading, nearly a
century after its first publication it reappeared as a paperback with
the title Principles of Mechanics and Dynamics.</p>
<p>William Thomson, Tait’s coauthor, is better known by his title as
Lord Kelvin. Born in Belfast, raised in Glasgow, and educated in
Cambridge, he discovered Fourier’s book on heat theory as an adolescent
and shortly thereafter was given a copy of Green’s rare 1828 Essay.
Thomson not only studied Green’s work himself but made it known on the
Continent. His earliest mathematical contributions of the 1840s were
furthered through communication with Liouville, in whose Journal they
appeared. They relate to the method of inversion and to Dirichlet’s
principle, both treated with regard to electricity and magnetism.
Subsequent research tended to be more physically and experimentally
oriented.</p>
<p>Thomson was a contemporary of an English physicist whose name is
familiar to every student of advanced calculus: George Gabriel Stokes
(1819–1903). Stokes graduated from Cambridge in 1841; like Thomson, he
had been senior wrangler. Much of his research was done before 1850;
during the second part of the century, he held the Lucasian chair of
mathematics at Cambridge and was an active member of the Royal Society,
whose Copley medal he had won for a major study on optics in the early
fifties. William Thomson knew the theorem that bears Stokes’s name in
1850, although it first appeared in print in the form of an exam
question in 1854. Stokes proved the theorem when Thomson sent it to him
in 1850 and seems to have chosen it as an examination question.</p>
<p>One of those taking this examination in 1854 was James Clerk Maxwell
(1831–1879). Best known for his stunningly successful derivation, in
1864, of the electromagnetic wave equations, he was influential in
urging on mathematicians and physicists the use of vectors. A friend of
Tait’s, he, too, admired Hamilton. Yet he avoided becoming heavily
involved in the notational quarrels surrounding many advocates of the
use of vector analysis.</p>
<p>Before leaving the English-speaking analysts of the period, we should
note some important contributions from those studying celestial
mechanics. As previously noted, nineteenth-century theoretical
astronomers had two great guidebooks: one was Laplace’s Mécanique
celeste, the other Gauss’s Theoria motus. The translation of Laplace’s
work into English brought to European attention an American, Nathaniel
Bowditch (1773–1838), in the 1830s. The subject was one in which
American analysts were repeatedly to make their mark, the most notable
nineteenth-century American contribution being that of George William
Hill (1838–1914). In 1877–1878, Hill published two important papers on
lunar theory, in which he established the theory of linear differential
equations with periodic coefficients. After Henri Poincaré noted the
importance of this work in 1885, the first of these papers was
republished in Mittag-Leffler’s Acta Mathematica, and attention was
drawn to the recently established American Journal of Mathematics, the
first volume of which had contained Hill’s other paper.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Astronomer Royal of England G.
B. Airy (1801–1892) made numerous contributions to the study of series
and integrals, which, although they belong to the age of Gauss and
Cauchy, were important in the effect they had on England’s midcentury
analysts and mathematical physicists. For example, in his optical
studies in 1850, Stokes was confronted with an integral that Airy had
used to describe a certain situation involving diffraction. Stokes set
up a differential equation having Airy’s integral as a special solution
and solved the equation by “semiconvergent” series. This was one of the
early examples of work that subsequently led to the more general theory
of such series established by T.-J. Stieltjes (1856–1894).</p>
<p>Weierstrass and Students</p>
<p>The leading analyst in Berlin in the second half of the nineteenth
century was Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897). Weierstrass prepared himself
at Münster for secondary-school teaching, where an instructor, Christoph
Gudermann (1798–1851), took Weierstrass under his wing.</p>
<p>Gudermann was especially interested in elliptic and hyperbolic
functions; his name is still recalled in the Gudermannian: If u is a
function of x satisfying the equation tan u = sin hx, then u is known as
the Gudermannian of x, written as u = gd x. More important to
mathematics than this minor contribution were the time and inspiration
the teacher gave to his student Karl Weierstrass, who was destined in
turn to become the greatest mathematics teacher of the mid-nineteenth
century—at least, as measured in terms of the number of successful
research workers he produced. Gudermann had impressed on the young
Weierstrass what a useful tool the power series representation of a
function was, and it was in this connection that Weierstrass produced
his greatest work, following in the footsteps of Abel.</p>
<p>Weierstrass earned his teacher’s certificate at the late age of
twenty-six, and for more than a dozen years, he taught at various
secondary schools. In 1854, however, a paper on Abelian functions,
appearing in Crelle’s Journal, brought him such recognition that shortly
thereafter he was offered and he accepted a professorship at the
University of Berlin. Weierstrass was then almost forty, making him a
striking exception to the common notion that a great mathematician must
make his mark early in life.</p>
<p>It had been generally assumed, before the middle of the nineteenth
century, that if an infinite series converges for some interval to a
continuous and differentiable function f(x), then a second series
obtained by differentiating the original series, term by term,
necessarily will converge, for the same interval, to f′(x). Several
mathematicians showed that this is not necessarily the case and that
term-by-term differentiation can be trusted only if the series is
uniformly convergent for the interval—that is, if a single N can be
found such that for every value of x in the interval the partial sums
Sn(x) will differ from the sum S(x) of the series by less than a given ε
for all n &gt; N. Weierstrass showed that for a uniformly convergent
series, term-by-term integration was also permissible. In the matter of
uniform convergence, Weierstrass was far from alone, for the concept was
hit on independently at about the same time by at least three other
men—Cauchy in France (perhaps by 1853), Stokes at Cambridge (in 1847),
and P. L. V. Seidel (1821–1896) in Germany (in 1848). H. E. Heine
(1821–1881), previously close to Dirichlet and Riemann, in 1870 proved
that the Fourier series development of a continuous function is unique
if one imposes the condition that it be uniformly convergent. Yet
perhaps no one is more deserving to be known as the father of the
critical movement in analysis than is Weierstrass. From 1857 until his
retirement in 1890, he urged a generation of students to use infinite
series representations with care.</p>
<p>One of Weierstrass’s important contributions to analysis is known as
analytic continuation. Weierstrass had shown that the infinite power
series representation of a function f(x), about a point Pl in the
complex plane, converges at all points within a circle C1 whose center
is P1 and which passes through the nearest singularity. If, now, one
expands the same function about a second point P2 other than P1 but
within C1, this series will be convergent within a circle C2 having P2
as the center and passing through the singularity nearest to P2. This
circle may include points outside C1; hence, one has extended the area
of the plane within which f(x) is defined analytically by a power
series; the process can be continued with still other circles.
Weierstrass therefore defined an analytic function as one power series
together with all of those that are obtainable from it by analytic
continuation. The importance of work such as that of Weierstrass is felt
particularly in mathematical physics, in which solutions of differential
equations are rarely found in any form other than as an infinite
series.</p>
<p>Weierstrass’s influence was exerted through his students as much as
through his own lectures and publications. In the field of differential
equations, this brings us to Lazarus Fuchs (1833–1902). Building on work
by the French mathematicians Briot (1817–1882) and Bouquet (1819–1885),
and on Riemann’s memoir about the hypergeometric equation, Fuchs
initiated the systematic study of regular singularities of linear
ordinary differential equations in the complex domain. His immediate
motivation came from lectures on Abelian functions that Weierstrass had
given in 1863. Fuchs’s work was sharpened by G. Frobenius (1849–1917) at
Berlin and served as a takeoff point for Poincaré.</p>
<p>Another Weierstrass student who made major contributions to complex
analysis was H. A. Schwarz (1848–1921). Schwarz was interested in
mapping questions and was especially affected by Weierstrass’s criticism
of Riemann’s use of the Dirichlet principle. Riemann’s famous mapping
theorem, translated into a later terminology, states that “there exists
one and only one conformal mapping of a given bounded simply connected
surface onto a second one, for which the images of one interior point
and one boundary point are prescribed” (Birkhoff 1973, p. 47).
Weierstrass noted that Riemann’s proof was unacceptable because it
extended the use of Dirichlet’s principle beyond the limitations that
would assure the existence of a minimizing integral. Schwarz thereupon
set out to find specific instances for which he could validate the
mapping theorem. This search led him to two very useful tools, one known
as his “reflection principle,” the other as his “alternating process.”
He was able to obtain a number of specific mappings; for example, he
could map a simply connected plane region onto a circle, but he could
not achieve the hoped-for broader generalization.</p>
<p>Yet another follower of Weierstrass who was to assume international
importance because of his journal and his support of mathematicians from
different parts of the world was the Swede Gösta Mittag-Leffler
(1846–1927). Mittag-Leffler had studied with Charles Hermite (1822–1901)
in Paris and Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824–1897) in Göttingen
before he came to Berlin. He made independent contributions to complex
function theory. More important, he founded the journal Acta
Mathematica, was a friend of Weierstrass’s and Hermite’s, exchanged
information with mathematicians around the world, and supported numerous
mathematicians directly, as well as through his connections in Sweden
and elsewhere. Thus, he played an important role in the lives of such
diverse individuals as Sofia Kovalevskaya, Henri Poincaré, and Georg
Cantor.</p>
<p>The Arithmetization of Analysis</p>
<p>Note that 1872 was a red-letter year not only in geometry but, more
particularly, in analysis. In that year, crucial contributions toward
the arithmetization of analysis were made by no fewer than five
mathematicians, one French, the others German. The Frenchman was H. C.
R. (Charles) Méray (1835–1911) of Burgundy; the four Germans were Karl
Weierstrass of Berlin, H. E. Heine of Halle, Georg Cantor (1845–1918),
also of Halle, and J. W. R. Dedekind (1831–1916) of Braunschweig. These
men, in a sense, represented the climax in half a century of
investigation into the nature of function and number that had begun in
1822 with Fourier’s theory of heat and with an attempt made in that year
by Martin Ohm (1792–1872) to reduce all of analysis to arithmetic in
Versuch eines vollständig konsequenten Systems der Mathematik. There
were two chief causes of uneasiness in this fifty-year interval. One was
the lack of confidence in operations performed on infinite series. It
was not even clear whether an infinite series of functions—of powers or
of sines and cosines, for example—always converges to the function from
which it was derived. A second cause for concern was occasioned by the
lack of any definition of the phrase “real number” that lay at the very
heart of the arithmetization program. By 1817, Bolzano had been so fully
aware of the need for rigor in analysis that Klein referred to him as
the “father of arithmetization,” but Bolzano had been less influential
than Cauchy, whose analysis was still encumbered with geometric
intuition. Even Bolzano’s continuous nondifferentiable function of about
1830 was overlooked by successors, and the example of such a function
given by Weierstrass (in classroom lectures in 1861 and in a paper to
the Berlin Academy in 1872) was generally thought to be the first
illustration of it.</p>
<p>Riemann, meanwhile, had exhibited a function f(x) that is
discontinuous at infinitely many points in an interval and yet the
integral of which exists and defines a continuous function F(x) that,
for the infinity of points in question, fails to have a derivative.
Riemann’s function is, in a sense, less pathological than are those of
Bolzano and Weierstrass, but it made clear that the integral required a
more careful definition than that of Cauchy, which had been guided
largely by geometric feeling for the area under a curve. The present-day
definition of the definite integral over an interval in terms of upper
and lower sums is generally known as the Riemann integral, in honor of
the man who gave necessary and sufficient conditions that a bounded
function be integrable. The Dirichlet function, for instance, does not
have a Riemann integral for any interval. Still more general definitions
of the integral, with weaker conditions on the function, were proposed
in the next century, but the definition of the integral used in most
undergraduate courses in the calculus is still that of Riemann.</p>
<p>There was a gap of some fifty years between the work of Bolzano and
that of Weierstrass, but the unity of effort in this half century and
the need to rediscover Bolzano’s work were such that there is a
celebrated theorem that bears the name of both men, the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: A bounded set S containing infinitely many
elements (such as points or numbers) contains at least one limit point.
Although this theorem was proved by Bolzano and apparently was also
known to Cauchy, it was the work of Weierstrass that made it familiar to
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Skepticism about Fourier’s series had been expressed by Lagrange, but
Cauchy, in 1823, thought he had proved the convergence of the general
Fourier series. Dirichlet had shown that Cauchy’s proof was inadequate
and had provided sufficient conditions for the convergence. It was in
seeking to liberalize Dirichlet’s conditions for the convergence of a
Fourier series that Riemann developed his definition of the Riemann
integral; in this connection, he showed that a function f(x) may be
integrable in an interval without being representable by a Fourier
series. It was the study of infinite trigonometric series that also led
to Cantor’s theory of sets, to be described later.</p>
<p>Only a year after the critical year 1872, a young man who had given
promise of significant contributions to both mathematics and its history
died at the early age of thirty-four. This was Hermann Hankel
(1839–1873), a student of Riemann’s and a professor of mathematics at
Leipzig. In 1867, he had published a book, Theorie der komplexen
Zahlensysteme, in which he pointed out that “the condition for erecting
a universal arithmetic is . . . a purely intellectual mathematics, one
detached from all perceptions.” We have seen that the revolution in
geometry took place when Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai freed themselves
from preconceptions of space. In somewhat the same sense, the
thoroughgoing arithmetization of analysis became possible only when, as
Hankel foresaw, mathematicians understood that the real numbers are to
be viewed as “intellectual structures,” rather than as intuitively given
magnitudes inherited from Euclid’s geometry. Hankel’s view was not
really new; a generation of algebraists, especially in Great Britain,
had been developing a universal arithmetic and multiple algebras. The
implications for analysis, however, had not been widely recognized.
During the early 1830s, Bolzano had made an attempt to develop a theory
of real numbers as limits of rational number sequences, but this had
gone unnoticed and unpublished until 1962. Sir William Rowan Hamilton
(1805–1865) perhaps had felt some such need, but his appeal to time,
rather than to space, was a change in language, although not in logical
form, from the usual geometric background. The crux of the matter was
first effectively seized on and published by the quintet of 1872
mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Méray was prompt to present his thoughts, for as early as 1869 he had
published an article calling attention to a serious lapse in reasoning
of which mathematicians from the time of Cauchy had been guilty.
Essentially, the petitio principii consisted of defining the limit of a
sequence as a real number and then, in turn, defining a real number as a
limit of a sequence (of rational numbers). It will be recalled that
Bolzano and Cauchy had attempted to prove that a sequence that
“converges within itself”—one for which Sn + p differs from Sn (for a
given integer p and for n sufficiently large) by less than any assigned
magnitude ε, also converges in the sense of external relations to a real
number S, the limit of the sequence. Méray, in his Nouveau précis
d’analyse infinitésimale of 1872, cut the Gordian knot by not invoking
the external condition of convergence or the real number S. Using only
the Bolzano-Cauchy criterion, where n, p, and ε are rational numbers,
convergence can be described without reference to irrational numbers. In
a broad sense, he regarded a converging sequence as determining either a
rational number as a limit or a “fictitious number” as a “fictitious
limit.” These “fictitious numbers” can, he showed, be ordered, and, in
essence, they are what we know as the irrational numbers. Méray was
somewhat vague as to whether his converging sequence is the number. If
it is, as seems to be implied, then his theory is equivalent to one
developed at the same time by Weierstrass.</p>
<p>Weierstrass sought to separate the calculus from geometry and to base
it on the concept of number alone. Like Méray, he also saw that to do
this, it was necessary to give a definition of an irrational number that
is independent of the limit concept, inasmuch as the latter had up to
this point presupposed the former. To correct Cauchy’s logical error,
Weierstrass settled the question of the existence of a limit of a
convergent sequence by making the sequence itself the number or the
limit. Weierstrass’s scheme is too subtle to be presented in detail
here, but in considerably oversimplified form, we may say that the
number is not the limit of the series ; it is the sequence associated
with this series. (Actually, in Weierstrass’s theory, the irrational
numbers are more broadly defined as aggregates of the rationals, rather
than more narrowly as ordered sequences of rationals, as we have
implied.)</p>
<p>Weierstrass did not publish his views on the arithmetization of
analysis, but they were made known by men such as Ferdinand Lindemann
and Eduard Heine, who had followed his lectures. In 1871, Cantor had
initiated a third program of arithmetization, similar to those of Méray
and Weierstrass. Heine suggested simplifications that have led to the
so-called Cantor-Heine development, published by Heine in Crelle’s
Journal for 1872 in the article “Die Elemente der Funktionenlehre.” In
essence, the scheme resembled that of Méray’s, in that convergent
sequences that fail to converge to rational numbers are taken by fiat to
define irrational numbers. A thoroughly distinct approach to the same
problem and the one that today is best known was given in the same year
by Dedekind in a celebrated book, Stetigkeit und die Irrationalzahlen
(Continuity and Irrational Numbers).</p>
<p>Dedekind</p>
<p>Dedekind’s attention had been directed to the problem of irrational
numbers as early as 1858, when he found himself lecturing on the
calculus. The limit concept, he concluded, should be developed through
arithmetic alone, without the usual guidance from geometry, if it were
to be rigorous. Instead of simply seeking a way out of Cauchy’s vicious
circle, Dedekind asked himself, as the title of his book implies, what
there is in continuous geometric magnitude that distinguishes it from
the rational numbers. Galileo and Leibniz had thought that the
“continuousness” of points on a line was the result of their
density—that between any two points, there is always a third; however,
the rational numbers have this property, yet they do not form a
continuum. On pondering this matter, Dedekind came to the conclusion
that the essence of the continuity of a line segment is not due to a
vague hang-togetherness but to an exactly opposite property: the nature
of the division of the segment into two parts by a point on the segment.
In any division of the points of the segment into two classes such that
each point belongs to one and only one class, and such that every point
of the one class is to the left of every point in the other, there is
one and only one point that brings about the division. As Dedekind
wrote, “By this commonplace remark the secret of continuity is to be
revealed.” Commonplace the remark may have been, but its author seems to
have had some qualms about it, for he hesitated for some years before
committing himself in print.</p>
<p>Dedekind saw that the domain of rational numbers can be extended to
form a continuum of real numbers if one assumes what is now known as the
Cantor-Dedekind axiom, namely, that the points on a line can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. Arithmetically
expressed, this means that for every division of the rational numbers
into two classes A and B such that every number of the first class, A,
is less than every number of the second class, B, there is one and only
one real number producing this Schnitt, or Dedekind cut. If A has a
largest number or if B contains a smallest number, the cut defines a
rational number, but if A has no largest number and B no smallest, then
the cut defines an irrational number. If, for example, we put in A all
negative rational numbers and also all positive rational numbers whose
squares are less than 2 and in B all positive rational numbers whose
squares are more than 2, we have subdivided the entire field of rational
numbers in a manner defining an irrational number—in this case, the
number that we usually write as . Now, Dedekind pointed out, the
fundamental theorems on limits can be proved rigorously without recourse
to geometry. It was geometry that had pointed the way to a suitable
definition of continuity, but in the end, it was excluded from the
formal arithmetic definition of the concept. The Dedekind cut in the
rational number system, or an equivalent construction of real number,
has now replaced geometrical magnitude as the backbone of analysis.</p>
<p>The definitions of real number are, as Hankel indicated they should
be, intellectual constructions on the basis of the rational numbers,
rather than something imposed on mathematics from without. Of the
previous definitions, one of the most popular has been that of Dedekind.
Early in the twentieth century, a modification of the Dedekind cut was
proposed by Bertrand Russell (1872–1970). He noted that because either
of Dedekind’s two classes A and B is uniquely determined by the other,
one alone suffices for the determination of a real number. Thus, can be
defined simply as that segment or subclass of the set of rational
numbers made up of all positive rational numbers whose squares are less
than 2 and also of all negative rational numbers. Similarly, every real
number is nothing more than a segment of the rational number system.</p>
<p>In some respects, the life of Dedekind was similar to that of
Weierstrass. He, too, was one of four children, and he, too, never
married, and both men lived into their eighties. On the other hand,
Dedekind made an earlier start in mathematics than had Weierstrass,
entering Göttingen at the age of nineteen and earning his doctorate
three years later with a thesis on the calculus that elicited praise
from Gauss. Dedekind stayed at Göttingen for a few years, teaching and
listening to lectures by Dirichlet, and then he took up secondary school
teaching, chiefly at Brunswick, for the rest of his life. Dedekind lived
so long after his celebrated introduction of “cuts” that the famous
publishing house of Teubner had listed his death in its Calendar for
Mathematicians as September 4, 1899. This amused Dedekind, who lived
more than a dozen years longer, and he wrote to the editor that he had
passed the day in question in stimulating conversation with his friend
Georg Cantor.</p>
<p>Cantor and Kronecker</p>
<p>The life of Cantor was tragically different from that of his friend
Dedekind. Cantor was born in St. Petersburg of parents who had migrated
from Denmark, but most of his life was spent in Germany, the family
having moved to Frankfurt when he was eleven. His parents were
Christians of Jewish background—his father had been converted to
Protestantism, his mother had been born a Catholic. The son Georg took a
strong interest in the fine-spun arguments of medieval theologians
concerning continuity and the infinite, and this militated against his
pursuing a mundane career in engineering, as suggested by his father. In
his studies at Zurich, Göttingen, and Berlin, the young man consequently
concentrated on philosophy, physics, and mathematics—a program that
seems to have fostered his unprecedented mathematical imagination. He
took his doctorate at Berlin in 1867 with a thesis on the theory of
numbers, but his early publications show an attraction to Weierstrassian
analysis. This field prompted the revolutionary ideas that sprang to his
mind in his late twenties. We have already noted the work of Cantor in
connection with the prosaic phrase “real number,” but his most original
contributions centered about the provocative word “infinity.”</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Zeno, men had been talking about infinity, in
theology as well as in mathematics, but no one before 1872 had been able
to tell precisely what he was talking about. All too frequently in
discussions of the infinite, the examples cited were such things as
unlimited power or indefinitely large magnitudes. Occasionally,
attention had instead been focused, as in the work of Galileo and
Bolzano, on the infinitely many elements in a collection, for example,
the natural numbers or the points in a line segment. Cauchy and
Weierstrass saw only paradox in attempts to identify an actual or
“completed” infinity in mathematics, believing that the infinitely large
and small indicated nothing more than the potentiality of Aristotle—an
incompleteness of the process in question. Cantor and Dedekind came to a
contrary conclusion. Dedekind saw in Bolzano’s paradoxes not an anomaly,
but a universal property of infinite sets that he took as a precise
definition:</p>
<p>A system S is said to be infinite when it is similar to a proper part
of itself; in the contrary case S is said to be a finite system.</p>
<p>In somewhat more modern terminology, a set S of elements is said to
be infinite if the elements of a proper subset S′ can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of S. That the set S of
natural numbers is infinite, for instance, is clear from the fact that
the subset S′ made up of all triangular numbers is such that to each
element n of S, there corresponds an element of S′ given by n(n + l)/2.
This positive definition of a “completed infinite” set is not to be
confused with the negative statement sometimes written with Wallis’s
symbol as 1/0 = ∞. This last “equation” simply indicates that there is
no real number that multiplied by zero will produce the number 1.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s definition of an infinite set appeared in 1872 in his
Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen. (In 1888, Dedekind amplified his
ideas in another important treatise, Was sind und was sollen die
Zahlen.) Two years later, Cantor married, and on the honeymoon, he took
his bride to Interlaken, where they met Dedekind. In the same year,
1874, Cantor published in Crelle’s Journal one of his most revolutionary
papers. He, like Dedekind, had recognized the fundamental property of
infinite sets, but, unlike Dedekind, Cantor saw that not all infinite
sets are the same. In the finite case, sets of elements are said to have
the same (cardinal) number if they can be put into one-to-one
correspondence. In a somewhat similar way, Cantor set out to build a
hierarchy of infinite sets according to the Mächtigkeit, or “power,” of
the set. The set of perfect squares or the set of triangular numbers has
the same power as the set of all of the positive integers, for the
groups can be put into one-to-one correspondence. These sets seem to be
much smaller than the set of all rational fractions, yet Cantor showed
that the latter set is also countable or denumerable—that is, it, too,
can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers,
hence has the same power. To show this, we merely follow the arrows in
Fig. 22.1, “counting” the fractions along the way.</p>
<p>FIG. 22.1</p>
<p>The rational fractions are so dense that between any two of them, no
matter how close, there will always be another, yet Cantor’s arrangement
showed that the set of fractions has the same power as does the set of
integers. One begins to wonder whether all sets of numbers have the same
power, but Cantor proved conclusively that this is not the case. The set
of all real numbers, for example, has a higher power than does the set
of rational fractions. To show this, Cantor used a reductio ad absurdum.
Assume that the real numbers between 0 and 1 are countable, are
expressed as nonterminating decimals (so that , for example, appears as
0.333 . . . , as 0.499 . . . , and so on), and are arranged in
denumerable order:</p>
<p>where aij is a digit between 0 and 9 inclusive. To show that not all
of the real numbers between 0 and 1 are included above, Cantor exhibited
an infinite decimal different from all of those listed. To do this,
simply form the decimal b = 0.b1b2b3 . . . , where bK = 9 if aKK = 1 and
bK = 1 if aKK ≠ 1. This real number will be between 0 and 1, and yet it
will be unequal to any one of those in the arrangement that was presumed
to contain all of the real numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The real numbers can be subdivided into two types in two different
ways: (1) as rational and irrational or (2) as algebraic and
transcendental. Cantor showed that even the class of algebraic numbers,
which is far more general than that of rational numbers, nevertheless
has the same power as that of the integers. Hence, it is the
transcendental numbers that give to the real number system the “density”
that results in a higher power. That it is fundamentally a matter of
density that determines the power of a set is suggested in the fact that
the power of the set of points on an infinitely extended line is just
the same as the power of the set of points in any segment of the line,
however small. To show this, let RS be the infinitely extended line and
let PQ be any finite segment (Fig. 22.2). Place the segment so that it
intersects RS at a point O but is not perpendicular to RS and does not
lie on RS. If the points M and N are so chosen that PM and QN are
parallel to RS and MON is perpendicular to RS, then, by drawing lines
through M intersecting both OP and OR and lines through N intersecting
OQ and OS, a one-to-one correspondence is easily established.</p>
<p>FIG. 22.2</p>
<p>More surprising still is the fact that dimensionality is not the
arbiter of the power of a set. The power of the set of points in a unit
line segment is just the same as that of the points in a unit area or in
a unit volume—or, for that matter, in all of three-dimensional space.
(Dimensionality, however, retains some measure of authority, in that any
one-to-one mapping of points in a space of unlike dimensionality is
necessarily a discontinuous mapping.) So paradoxical were some results
in point-set theory that Cantor himself on one occasion in 1877 wrote to
Dedekind, “I see it, but I don’t believe it,” and he asked his friend to
check the proof. Publishers, too, were very hesitant about accepting his
papers, and several times the appearance of articles by Cantor in
Crelle’s Journal was delayed by editorial indecision and concern lest
error lurk in the unconventional approach to mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>Cantor’s amazing results led him to establish the theory of sets, a
full-fledged mathematical discipline, known as Mengenlehre (theory of
assemblages) or Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (theory of manifolds), a branch
that in the mid-twentieth century was to have profound effects on the
teaching of mathematics. At the time of its founding, Cantor spent much
effort in convincing his contemporaries of the validity of the results,
for there was considerable horror infiniti, and mathematicians were
reluctant to accept the eigentlich Unendliche or “completed infinity.”
In piling evidence on evidence, Cantor in the end built a whole
transfinite arithmetic. The “power” of a set became the “cardinal
number” of the set. Thus, the “number” of the set of integers is the
“smallest” transfinite number, E, and the “number” of the set of real
numbers or of points on a line is a “larger” number, C, the number of
the continuum. Still unanswered is the question whether there are
transfinite numbers between E and C. Cantor himself showed that there
are indefinitely many transfinite numbers beyond C, for he proved that
the set of subsets of a set is always of a higher power than the set
itself. Hence, the “number” of the set of subsets of C is a third
transfinite number, the set of subsets of this set of subsets determines
a fourth number, and so on, indefinitely. As there are infinitely many
natural numbers, so are there infinitely many transfinite numbers as
well.</p>
<p>The transfinite numbers described previously are cardinal numbers,
but Cantor also developed an arithmetic of transfinite ordinal numbers.
Ordering relations are a ticklish matter in mathematics, so it turns out
that transfinite ordinal arithmetic differs strikingly from finite
ordinal arithmetic. For finite cases, the rules for ordinal numbers are
essentially the same as for cardinal numbers. Thus, 3 + 4 = 4 + 3,
whether these digits represent cardinal or ordinal numbers. If, however,
one designates by ω the ordinal number of the “counting numbers,” then ω
+ 1 is not the same as 1 + ω, for 1 + ω is obviously the same as ω.
Moreover, one can show that ω + ω = ω and ω ⋅ ω = ω, properties unlike
those of finite ordinals but resembling those of transfinite
cardinals.</p>
<p>Dedekind and Cantor were among the most capable mathematicians, and
certainly the most original, of their day, yet neither man secured a
top-ranking professional position. Dedekind spent almost a lifetime
teaching at the secondary-school level, and Cantor spent most of his
career at the University of Halle. Cantor had hoped to achieve the
distinction of a professorship at the University of Berlin, and he
blamed Leopold Kronecker (1823–1891) for his lack of success.</p>
<p>Kronecker had been a student of Kummer’s, first at the
secondary-school level, when the latter was a teacher in the gymnasium
that Kronecker attended, later at the University of Breslau. Kronecker
studied with Steiner and Dirichlet at Berlin, where he obtained his
doctoral degree in 1845. The son of wealthy parents, he did not
initially pursue an academic career but looked after the family’s
financial interests. He continued to do mathematical research, however.
When he moved to Berlin in 1855, he led the life of a private scholar.
His prodigious output, covering number theory, the theory of equations,
and elliptic function theory, among others, in 1861 gained him
membership in the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. This made him eligible
to teach at the University of Berlin, which he proceeded to do. He was
appointed to a regular professorship in 1883, when Kummer retired.
Kronecker’s research contributions were significant, both for individual
results and for his overall attempt to arithmetize algebra, as well as
analysis. His influence on early twentieth-century algebra was
considerable, as was that on number theory; the work of Erich Hecke
(1887–1947) serves as an example. The importance of Kronecker’s work has
been overshadowed in most historical accounts by rather hostile versions
of his conflict with Cantor. In fact, his predilection for the integers
and his espousal of constructive procedures also estranged him from
Weierstrass. To him is attributed the well-known statement “God made the
integers, and all the rest is the work of man.” He categorically
rejected the real-number constructions of his day on the grounds that
they cannot be achieved only through finite processes. He is said to
have asked Lindemann of what use was the proof that π is not algebraic,
inasmuch as irrational numbers are nonexistent. Sometimes it is reported
that his movement died of inanition. We shall later see that it can be
said to have reappeared in a new form in the work of Poincaré and L. E.
J. Brouwer.</p>
<p>In 1883, Cantor wrote a vigorous defense in his Grundlagen einer
allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (Foundations of a General Theory of
Manifolds), holding that “definite numerations can be undertaken with
infinite sets just as well as with finite.” He had no fear of falling
into what he described as an “abyss of transcendentals,” yet he did
occasionally lapse into arguments of the theological type. Kronecker
continued his attacks on the hypersensitive and temperamental Cantor,
and in 1884, Cantor suffered the first of the nervous breakdowns that
were to recur during the remaining thirty-three years of his life. Fits
of depression sometimes led him to doubt his own work, although he was
comforted to some extent by the support of men such as Hermite. Toward
the end, he did earn recognition for his achievements, but his death in
1918 in a mental institution in Halle is a reminder that genius and
madness sometimes are closely related. The tragedy of his personal life
is mitigated by the paean of praise of one of the leading mathematicians
of the early twentieth century, David Hilbert, who described the new
transfinite arithmetic as “the most astonishing product of mathematical
thought, one of most beautiful realizations of human activity in the
domain of the purely intelligible.” Where timid souls had hesitated,
Hilbert exclaimed, “No one shall expel us from the paradise which Cantor
has created for us.”</p>
<p>Analysis in France</p>
<p>Before examining some of the fruits of Cantor’s paradise, we should
regard some nineteenth-century analytic work in the country thus far
ignored in this chapter—France. Although analytic activity during the
latter part of the nineteenth century was most conspicuous in Germany
and England, there had been a steady stream of contributions from Paris.
These took a variety of forms, in teaching and research. Primarily
associated with teaching were the great textbooks, usually based on
lecture notes. Sturm’s Cours d’analyse was but one of the
longest-lasting successors to Cauchy’s record of the course taught at
the École Polytechnique; at the turn of the century, it was overtaken by
Goursat’s work, which exerted a special influence in the United States
through its English translation. Briot and Bouquet’s Théorie des
fonctions elliptiques was a comprehensive compendium on the subject of
elliptic functions; H. Laurent produced an elementary textbook on the
subject more suitable for classroom use. Toward the end of the century,
Jules Tannery and J. Molk produced multivolume Elements of the theory of
elliptic functions. There were authors who ranged across a wider field,
such as Joseph Alfred Serret (1819–1885), who taught and produced
textbooks on practically every area of mid-nineteenth-century
mathematics. Also significant was the work of popularizers such as the
Abbé Moigno, a self-appointed explicator of Cauchy in the 1840s and the
editor of Cosmos, a journal that reported on scientific and mathematical
activities.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Cauchy’s work provided ample takeoff points for
many analysts of the time. For example, Pierre-Alphonse Laurent
(1813–1854) and Victor Puiseux (1820–1883) are still remembered for
their contributions to complex function theory. Laurent’s expansion
replaces Taylor series at certain points of discontinuity; Puiseux went
beyond Cauchy in a clear discussion of essential singularities and
related matters.</p>
<p>French mathematics continued to influence activity elsewhere—we have
already noted this in connection with Liouville and Camille Jordan.
Another example may be found in the work of Gabriel Lamé (1795–1860),
whose name is primarily associated with the introduction of curvilinear
coordinates to the treatment of the partial differential equations,
especially the heat equation, describing physical problems. Eduard
Heine, a much younger member of the Dirichlet circle, who concentrated
on spherical harmonics and the potential equation, first followed and
for a while was in close competition with Lamé in his research. Also
inspired by Lamé’s concept of curvilinear coordinates and overlapping
with Heine was É. Mathieu (1835–1900), who introduced elliptic
cylindrical coordinates and the functions named after him in his study
of the wave equation, in connection with the problem of a vibrating
elliptic membrane.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known French analytic work of midcentury was that of
Sturm and Liouville, dealing with the theory of second-order ordinary
differential equations with boundary conditions. In fact, the papers in
question were published in the early issues of Liouville’s Journal in
the 1830s. Their tremendous significance emerged only gradually,
however, especially through the use made of them by the British
mathematical physicists of the later period. The problem at issue was
that of the expansibility into characteristic functions (eigenfunctions)
of the expression at hand. It can be regarded as a generalization of the
theory of Fourier series. Sturm had studied not only Fourier’s theory of
heat but also his work on numerical solutions of equations; the
influence of this work seems apparent as soon as one reads Sturm’s first
major result of the theory. This is his separation theorem, which states
that the oscillations of any two (real) solutions alternate, or separate
each other. The Sturm-Liouville theory not only confirmed the
expansibility but also provided criteria for solutions and for the
evaluation of the eigenfunctions. The theory was not altogether rigorous
at the outset. Toward the end of the century, refinements in
applications and proofs were provided. Especially active in the field
was the American mathematician Maxime Bôcher (1867–1918). Bôcher, who
trained at Harvard in the 1880s under William Elwood Byerly, Benjamin O.
Peirce, and James Mills Peirce, had earned his doctoral degree at
Göttingen under Klein in 1891 with a prize-winning dissertation on the
series expansions of potential theory. After the turn of the century,
Bôcher was briefly joined in the study of Sturm-Liouville issues by his
fellow countrymen Max Mason, G. R. D. Richardson, and G. D. Birkhoff. As
a token of appreciation for Sturm and Liouville’s theory and the
research opportunities it had provided for this small band of American
analysts, Bôcher chose Sturm’s methods as his topic when he was invited
to give a set of lectures at the University of Paris in the winter of
1913–1914.</p>
<p>Liouville is also noted for a variety of other contributions. In
complex analysis, his work is recalled in Liouville’s theorem: If f(z),
an entire analytic function of the complex variable z, is bounded over
the complex plane, then f(z) is a constant. From this theorem, the
fundamental theorem of algebra can be deduced as a simple corollary as
follows: If f(z) is a polynomial of degree greater than zero, and if
f(z) were nowhere zero in the complex plane, then its reciprocal F(z) =
l/f(z) would satisfy the conditions of the Liouville theorem.
Consequently, F(z) would have to be a constant, which obviously it is
not. Therefore, the equation f(z) = 0 is satisfied by at least one
complex value z = z0. In plane analytic geometry, there is another
“Liouville theorem”: The lengths of the tangents from a point P to a
conic C are proportional to the cube roots of the radii of curvature of
C at the corresponding points of contact. Finally, let us consider
Liouville’s best-known contribution to the theory of real numbers.</p>
<p>The theory of numbers deals primarily with the integers or, more
generally, with ratios of integers—the so-called rational numbers. Such
numbers are always roots of a linear equation ax + b = 0 with integral
coefficients. Real analysis deals with a more general type of number
that may be either rational or irrational. It had been known, in
essence, to Euclid that the roots of ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c
are integral multiples of a given length, can be constructed
geometrically with a straightedge and compasses. If the coefficients of
axn + bxn−1 + cxn−2 + . . . + px + q = 0, where n and a, b, c, . . . , q
are integers and n &gt; 2, the roots of the equation generally are not
constructible with Euclidean tools. The roots of such an equation, for n
&gt; 0, are known as algebraic numbers, to indicate the manner in which
they are defined. Inasmuch as every rational number is a root of such an
equation for n = 1, the question naturally arises whether every
irrational number is a root of such an equation for some n ≥ 2. The
negative of this question was finally established in 1844 by Liouville,
who in that year constructed an extensive class of nonalgebraic real
numbers. The numbers of the particular class that he developed are known
as Liouville numbers, the more comprehensive set of nonalgebraic real
numbers being called transcendental numbers. Liouville’s construction of
transcendental numbers is quite involved, but if one does not insist on
a proof of transcendentalism, some simple examples of transcendental
numbers can be given—such as 0.1001000100001 . . . , or numbers of the
form</p>
<p>To prove that any particular real number, such as e or π, is not
algebraic is usually quite difficult. Liouville, for example, was able
to show, in his Journal for 1844, that neither e nor e2 could be the
root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients; hence, given a
unit line segment, lines of length e or e2 are not constructible by
Euclidean tools. But it was almost thirty years before another French
mathematician, Charles Hermite (1822–1901), pursuing the views of
Liouville, was able to show in 1873 in an article in the Comptes Rendus
of the Académie that e could not be the root of any polynomial equation
with integral coefficients—that is, that e is transcendental.</p>
<p>The status of the number π baffled mathematicians for nine years
longer than did the number e. Lambert in 1770 and Legendre in 1794 had
shown that both π and π2 are irrational, but this proof had not put an
end to the age-old question of the squaring of the circle. The matter
was finally put to rest in 1882 in a paper in the Mathematische Annalen
by C. L. F. Lindemann (1852–1939) of Munich. The article, titled “Über
die Zahl π,” showed conclusively, in extending the work of Liouville and
Hermite, that π is also a transcendental number. In his proof, Lindemann
first demonstrated that the equation eix + 1 = 0 cannot be satisfied if
x is algebraic. Inasmuch as Euler had shown that the value x = π does
satisfy the equation, it must follow that π is not algebraic. Here,
finally, was the answer to the classical problem of the quadrature of
the circle. In order for the quadrature of the circle to be possible
with Euclidean tools, the number π would have to be the root of an
algebraic equation with a root expressible in square roots. Because π is
not algebraic, the circle cannot be squared according to the classical
rules. Emboldened by his success, Ferdinand Lindemann later published
several purported proofs of Fermat’s Last Theorem, but they were shown
by others to be invalid.</p>
<p>Hermite was one of France’s most influential nineteenth-century
analysts. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that he had fared
badly as a student when faced with educational pedantry and
examinations, Hermite at one time or another was affiliated with the
major mathematically oriented institutions of Paris. Hermite served as
examiner at the École Polytechnique, substituted at the Collège de
France, taught at the École Normale, and, from 1869 to 1897, held the
chair as professor of higher analysis at the Sorbonne. In school, he had
the same teacher who had encouraged the young Galois; his first reading
in the mathematical classics consisted of Lagrange’s work on the
solution of numerical equations and the French translation of Gauss’s
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. He had first come to notice in 1842, while
still a preparatory school student, by submitting two papers to the
Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques, a journal aimed at mathematics
teachers and their more advanced students. One of these papers was a
very elegant exposition of the insolvability of the quintic. In 1858,
he, as well as Kronecker, solved the quintic equation using elliptic
modular functions. During the intervening years, Hermite had come under
the protection of Liouville, who introduced Hermite to his friends in
Prussia, especially Jacobi. The ensuing correspondence shows Hermite’s
early feats in the theory of elliptic and Abelian functions and analytic
number theory. In 1864, Hermite contributed a new class of special
functions in connection with the problem of functional expansions over
unbounded intervals. Ironically, the name of this great analyst nowadays
appears more frequently in algebra than in analysis: Given a matrix H,
let each of its elements be replaced by its complex conjugate and call
the resulting matrix H<em>. If H = H</em>, the matrix is called
Hermitian. In 1858, Hermite showed that the eigenvalues of such a matrix
are real. Previously, he had coined the term “orthogonal” for a matrix M
if −M equals the inverse of M*.</p>
<p>The steady contributions of nineteenth-century French analysts attest
to the continuing fertility of French analytic soil, but the most
telling sign was the spectacular display of new concepts that Poincaré
and his younger contemporaries presented to the new century.</p>
