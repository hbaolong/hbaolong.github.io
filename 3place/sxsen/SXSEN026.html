<h4 id="polygonal-areas">Polygonal Areas</h4>
<p>It used to be held that the Babylonians were better in algebra than
were the Egyptians, but that they had contributed less to geometry. The
first half of this statement is clearly substantiated by what we have
learned in previous paragraphs; attempts to bolster the second half of
the comparison generally are limited to the measure of the circle or to
the volume of the frustum of a pyramid. In the Mesopotamian Valley, the
area of a circle was generally found by taking three times the square of
the radius, and in accuracy this falls considerably below the Egyptian
measure. Yet the counting of decimal places in the approximations for π
is scarcely an appropriate measure of the geometric stature of a
civilization, and a twentieth-century discovery has effectively
nullified even this weak argument.</p>
<p>In 1936, a group of mathematical tablets was unearthed at Susa, a
couple of hundred miles from Babylon, and these include significant
geometric results. True to the Mesopotamian penchant for making tables
and lists, one tablet in the Susa group compares the areas and the
squares of the sides of the regular polygons of three, four, five, six,
and seven sides. The ratio of the area of the pentagon, for example, to
the square on the side of the pentagon is given as 1;40, a value that is
correct to two significant figures. For the hexagon and the heptagon,
the ratios are expressed as 2;37,30 and 3;41, respectively. In the same
tablet, the scribe gives 0;57,36 as the ratio of the perimeter of the
regular hexagon to the circumference of the circumscribed circle, and
from this, we can readily conclude that the Babylonian scribe had
adopted 3;7,30, or 3, as an approximation for π. This is at least as
good as the value adopted in Egypt. Moreover, we see it in a more
sophisticated context than in Egypt, for the tablet from Susa is a good
example of the systematic comparison of geometric figures. One is almost
tempted to see in it the genuine origin of geometry, but it is important
to note that it was not so much the geometric context that interested
the Babylonians as the numerical approximations that they used in
mensuration. Geometry for</p>
<p>them was not a mathematical discipline in our sense, but a sort of
applied algebra or arithmetic in which numbers are attached to
figures.</p>
<p>There is some disagreement as to whether the Babylonians were
familiar with the concept of similar figures, although this appears to
be likely. The similarity of all circles seems to have been taken for
granted in Mesopotamia, as it had been in Egypt, and the many problems
on triangle measure in cuneiform tablets seem to imply a concept of
similarity. A tablet in the Baghdad Museum has a right triangle ABC
(Fig. 3.2) with sides a560 and b545 and c575, and it is subdivided into
four smaller right triangles, ACD, CDE, DEF, and EFB. The areas of these
four triangles are then given as 8,6 and 5,11;2,24 and 3,19;3,56,9,36
and 5,53;53,39,50,24, respectively. From these values, the scribe
computed the length of AD as 27, apparently using a sort of “similarity
formula” equivalent to our theorem that areas of similar figures are to
each other as squares on corresponding sides. The lengths of CD and BD
are found to be 36 and 48, respectively, and through an application of
the “similarity formula” to triangles BCD and DCE, the length of CE is
found to be 21;36. The text breaks off in the middle of the calculation
of DE.</p>
