<h4 id="quadrature-of-lunes">Quadrature of Lunes</h4>
<p>Somewhat younger than Anaxagoras and coming originally from about the
same part of the Greek world was Hippocrates of Chios. He should not be
confused with his still more celebrated contemporary, the physician
Hippocrates of Cos. Both Cos and Chios are islands in the Dodecanese
group, but in about 430 BCE, Hippocrates of Chios left his native land
for Athens in his capacity as a merchant. Aristotle reported that
Hippocrates was less shrewd than Thales and that he lost his money in
Byzantium through fraud; others say that he was beset by pirates. In any
case, the incident was never regretted by the victim, for he counted
this his good fortune, in that as a consequence he turned to the study
of geometry, in which he achieved remarkable success—a story typical of
the Heroic Age. Proclus wrote that Hippocrates composed an “Elements of
Geometry,” anticipating by more than a century the better-known Elements
of Euclid. Yet the textbook of Hippocrates— as well as another reported
to have been written by Leon, a later associate of the Platonic
school—has been lost, although it was known to Aristotle. In fact, no
mathematical treatise from the fifth century has survived, but we do
have a fragment concerning Hippocrates that Simplicius (fl. ca. 520 CE)
claims to have copied literally from the History of Mathematics (now
lost) by Eudemus. This brief statement, the nearest thing we have to an
original source on the mathematics of the time, describes a portion of
the work of Hippocrates dealing with the quadrature of lunes. A lune is
a figure bounded by two circular arcs of</p>
<p>Q ua drature of Lune s</p>
<p>unequal radii; the problem of the quadrature of lunes undoubtedly
arose from that of squaring the circle. The Eudemian fragment attributes
to Hippocrates the following theorem:</p>
<p>Similar segments of circles are in the same ratio as the squares on
their bases.</p>
<p>The Eudemian account reports that Hippocrates demonstrated this by
first showing that the areas of two circles are to each other as the
squares on their diameters. Here Hippocrates adopted the language and
the concept of proportion that played so large a role in Pythagorean
thought. In fact, it is thought by some that Hippocrates became a
Pythagorean. The Pythagorean school in Croton had been suppressed
(possibly because of its secrecy, perhaps because of its conservative
political tendencies), but the scattering of its adherents throughout
the Greek world served only to broaden the influence of the school. This
influence undoubtedly was felt, directly or indirectly, by
Hippocrates.</p>
<p>The theorem of Hippocrates on the areas of circles seems to be the
earliest precise statement on curvilinear mensuration in the Greek
world. Eudemus believed that Hippocrates gave a proof of the theorem,
but a rigorous demonstration at that time (say, about 430 BCE) would
appear to be unlikely. The theory of proportions at that stage probably
was established only for commensurable magnitudes. The proof as given in
Euclid XII.2 comes from Eudoxus, a man who lived halfway in time between
Hippocrates and Euclid. Just as much of the material in the first two
books of Euclid seems to stem from the Pythagoreans, however, so it
would appear reasonable to assume that the formulations, at least, of
much of Books III and IV of the Elements came from the work of
Hippocrates. Moreover, if Hippocrates did give a demonstration of this
theorem on the areas of circles, he may have been responsible for the
introduction into mathematics of the indirect method of proof. That is,
the ratio of the areas of two circles is equal to the ratio of the
squares on the diameters or it is not. By a reductio ad absurdum from
the second of the two possibilities, the proof of the only alternative
is established.</p>
<p>From this theorem on the areas of circles, Hippocrates readily found
the first rigorous quadrature of a curvilinear area in the history of
mathematics. He began with a semicircle circumscribed about an isosceles
right triangle, and on the base (hypotenuse) he constructed a segment
similar to the circular segments on the sides of the right triangle
(Fig. 4.5). Because the segments are to each other as squares on their
bases and from the Pythagorean theorem as applied to the right triangle,
the sum of the two small circular segments is equal to the larger
circular segment. Hence, the difference between the semicircle on AC and
the segment ADCE equals triangle ABC. Therefore, the lune ABCD is</p>
<p>precisely equal to triangle ABC, and because triangle ABC is equal to
the square on half of AC, the quadrature of the lune has been found.</p>
<p>Eudemus also described a Hippocratean lune quadrature based on an
isosceles trapezoid, ABCD, inscribed in a circle so that the square on
the longest side (base), AD, is equal to the sum of the squares on the
three equal shorter sides, AB and BC and CD (Fig. 4.6). Then, if on side
AD one constructs a circular segment, AEDF, similar to those on the
three equal sides, lune ABCDE is equal to trapezoid ABCDF.</p>
<p>That we are on relatively firm ground historically in describing the
quadrature of lunes by Hippocrates is indicated by the fact that
scholars other than Simplicius also refer to this work. Simplicius lived
in the sixth century, but he depended not only on Eudemus (fl. ca. 320
BCE) but also on Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE), one of the
chief commentators on Aristotle. Alexander described two quadratures
other than those given previously. (1) If on the hypotenuse and the
sides of an isosceles right triangle one constructs semicircles (Fig.
4.7), then the lunes created on the smaller sides together equal the
triangle. (2) If on a diameter of a semicircle one constructs an
isosceles trapezoid with three equal sides (Fig. 4.8), and if on the
three equal sides semicircles are constructed, then the trapezoid is
equal in area to the sum of four curvilinear areas: the three equal
lunes and a semicircle on one of the equal sides of the trapezoid. From
the second of these quadratures, it would follow that if the lunes can
be squared, the semicircle—hence, the circle—can also be squared. This
conclusion seems to have encouraged</p>
<p>FIG. 4.7</p>
<p>Hippia s of Eli s</p>
<p>Hippocrates, as well as his contemporaries and early successors, to
hope that ultimately the circle would be squared.</p>
<p>The Hippocratean quadratures are significant not so much as attempts
at circle-squaring as indications of the level of mathematics at the
time. They show that Athenian mathematicians were adept at handling
transformations of areas and proportions. In particular, there was
evidently no difficulty in converting a rectangle of sides a and b into
a square. This required finding the mean proportional or geometric mean
between a and b. That is, if a:x5x:b, geometers of the day easily
constructed the line x. It was natural, therefore, that geometers should
seek to generalize the problem by inserting two means between two given
magnitudes a and b. That is, given two line segments a and b, they hoped
to construct two other segments x and y such that a:x5x:y5y:b.
Hippocrates is said to have recognized that this problem is equivalent
to that of duplicating the cube, for if b52a, the continued proportions,
on the elimination of y, lead to the conclusion that x3 52a3.</p>
<p>There are three views on what Hippocrates deduced from his quadrature
of lunes. Some have accused him of believing that he could square all
lunes, hence also the circle; others think that he knew the limitations
of his work, concerned as it was with only some types of lunes. At least
one scholar has held that Hippocrates knew he had not squared the circle
but tried to deceive his countrymen into thinking that he had succeeded.
There are other questions, too, concerning Hippocrates’ contributions,
for to him has been ascribed, with some uncertainty, the first use of
letters in geometric figures. It is interesting to note that whereas he
advanced two of the three famous problems, he seems to have made no
progress in the trisecting of the angle, a problem studied somewhat
later by Hippias of Elis.</p>
