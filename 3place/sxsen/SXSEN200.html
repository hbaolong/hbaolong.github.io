<h4 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h4>
<p>Monge was a capable administrator, an imaginative research
mathematician, and an inspiring teacher. The pupils of Monge let loose a
spate of elementary textbooks on analytic geometry such as has never
been equaled—not even in our own day. If we judge from the sudden
appearance of so many analytic geometries beginning in 1798, a
revolution had taken place in mathematical instruction. Analytic
geometry, which for a century and more had been overshadowed by the
calculus, suddenly achieved a recognized place in the schools. This
“analytical revolution” can be credited primarily to Monge. Between the
years 1798 and 1802, four elementary analytic geometries appeared from
the pens of Sylvestre Franc¸ois Lacroix (1765 1843), Jean-Baptiste Biot
(1774 1862), Louis Puissant (1769 1843), and F. L. Lefranc¸ois, all
directly inspired by the lectures at the E´cole Polytechnique.
Polytechnicians were responsible for as many books again in the next
decade. Most of these were eminently successful texts, appearing in
numerous editions. The volume by Biot achieved a fifth edition in less
than a dozen years; that by Lacroix, a student and colleague of Monge’s,
appeared in twenty-five editions within ninety-nine years! Perhaps we
should speak instead of the “textbook revolution,” for Lacroix’s other
textbooks were almost as spectacularly successful, his Arithmetic and
his Geometry appearing in 1848 in the twentieth and sixteenth editions,
respectively. The twentieth edition of his Algebra was published in
1859, and the ninth edition of his Calculus in 1881.</p>
<p>Lacroix on Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge is known to most readers as a founder of modern synthetic
geometry. But there is an aspect of Monge’s work that is less well
known. Virtually without exception, the textbook writers in analytic
geometry ascribe the inspiration for their work to Monge, although
Lagrange is occasionally mentioned as well. Lacroix most clearly
expressed the point of view as follows:</p>
<p>In carefully avoiding all geometric constructions, I would have the
reader realize that there exists a way of looking at geometry which one
might call analytic geometry, and which consists in deducing the
properties of extension from the smallest possible number of principles
by purely analytic methods, as Lagrange has done in his mechanics with
regard to the properties of equilibrium and movement.</p>
<p>Lacroix held that algebra and geometry “should be treated separately,
as far apart as they can be; and that the results in each should serve
for mutual clarification, corresponding, so to speak, to the text of a
book and its translation.” Lacroix believed that Monge “was the first
one to think of presenting in this form the application of algebra to
geometry.” Lacroix admitted that his own section on solid analytic
geometry was almost entirely the work of Monge.</p>
<p>The phrase “analytic geometry” seems to have first been used as the
title of a textbook by Lefranc¸ois in the second edition of his Essais
de geom´ etrie analytiques´ of 1804 and by Biot in an 1805 edition of
his Essais de geom´ etrie analytique´ , the latter of which, translated
into English as well as other languages, was used for many years at
West</p>
