<h4 id="the-method">The Method</h4>
<p>works were known. In the days of Eutocius, a first-rate scholar and
skillful commentator of the sixth century, only three of the many
Archimedean works were generally known—On the Equilibrium of Planes, the
incomplete Measurement of a Circle, and the admirable On the Sphere and
Cylinder. Under the circumstances, it is a wonder that such a large
proportion of what Archimedes wrote has survived to this day. Among the
amazing aspects of the provenance of Archimedean works is the discovery
within the twentieth century of one of the most important treatises—one
that Archimedes simply called The Method and that had been lost since
the early centuries of our era until its rediscovery in 1906.</p>
<p>The Method of Archimedes is of particular significance because it
discloses for us a facet of Archimedes’ thought that is not found
elsewhere. His other treatises are gems of logical precision, with
little hint of the preliminary analysis that may have led to the
definitive formulations. So thoroughly without motivation did his proofs
appear to some writers of the seventeenth century that they suspected
Archimedes of having concealed his method of approach in order that his
work might be admired more. How unwarranted such an ungenerous estimate
of the great Syracusan was became clear in 1906 with the discovery of
the manuscript containing The Method. Here Archimedes had published a
description of the preliminary “mechanical” investigations that had led
to many of his chief mathematical discoveries. He thought that his
“method” in these cases lacked rigor, because it assumed an area, for
example, to be a sum of line segments.</p>
<p>The Method, as we have it, contains most of the text of some fifteen
propositions sent in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes, a
mathematician and the chief of the Alexandrian Library. The author
opened by saying that it is easier to supply a proof of a theorem if we
first have some knowledge of what is involved; as an example, he cites
the proofs of Eudoxus on the cone and the pyramid, which had been
facilitated by the preliminary assertions, without proof, made by
Democritus. Then, Archimedes announced that he himself had a
“mechanical” approach that paved the way for some of his proofs. The
very first theorem that he discovered by this approach was the one on
the area of a parabolic segment; in Proposition 1 of The Method, the
author describes how he arrived at this theorem by balancing lines as
one balances weights in mechanics. He thought of the areas of the
parabolic segment ABC and the triangle AFC (where FC is tangent to the
parabola at C) as the totality of a set of lines parallel to the
diameter QB of the parabola, such as OP (Fig. 6.10) for the parabola and
OM for the triangle. If one were to place at H (where HK5KC) a line
segment equal to OP, this would just balance the line OM where it now
is, K being the fulcrum. (This can be shown through the law of the lever
and the property of the parabola.) Hence, the area of the parabola, if
placed with its center of gravity at H, will just balance the triangle,
whose center of gravity is along KC and a</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>third of the way from K to C. From this, one easily sees that the
area of the parabolic segment is one-third the area of triangle AFC, or
fourthirds the area of the inscribed triangle ABC.</p>
<p>Archimedes’ favorite theorem, the one represented on his tomb, was
also suggested to him by his mechanical method. It is described in
Proposition 2 of The Method:</p>
<p>Any segment of a sphere has to the cone with the same base and height
the ratio which the sum of the radius of the sphere and the height of
the complementary segment has to the height of the complementary
segment.</p>
<p>The theorem readily follows from a beautiful balancing property that
Archimedes discovered (and that can be easily verified in terms of
modern formulas). Let AQDCP be a cross-section of a sphere with center 0
and diameter AC (Fig. 6.11) and let AUV be a plane section of a right
circular cone with axis AC and UV as diameter of the base. Let IJUV be a
right circular cylinder with axis AC and with UV5IJ as diameter and let
AH5AC. If a plane is passed through any point S on the axis AC and
perpendicular to AC, the plane will cut the cone, the sphere, and the
cylinder in circles of radii r1 5SR, r2 5SP, and r3 5SN, respectively.
If we call the areas of these circles A1, A2, and A3, then, Archimedes
found, A1 and A2, when placed with their centers at H, will just balance
A3 where it now is, with A as the fulcrum. Hence, if we call the volumes
of the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder V1, V2, and V3, it follows
that V1 1V2 512V3, andbecauseV2 513V3; thespheremust be 16V3: Because
the volume V3 ofthe cylinder is known (from Democritus and Eudoxus), the
volume of the sphere is also known—in modern notation, V 5πr3. By
applying the same balancing technique to the spherical segment with base
diameter BD,</p>
