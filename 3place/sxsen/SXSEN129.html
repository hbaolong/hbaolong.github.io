<h4 id="regiomontanus">Regiomontanus</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most influential mathematician of the fifteenth century,
Johann Mu¨ller (1436 1476), born near Ko¨nigsberg in Franconia, adopted
the name Regiomontanus, the Latin form of “King’s Mountain.” A
precocious student with an early interest in mathematics and astronomy,
he attended the University of Leipzig before heading for the University
of Vienna at age fourteen, where he studied with Georg Peurbach (1423
1469), taught courses in geometry, and collaborated with Peurbach in
observational and theoretical studies of astronomy. A year before
Peurbach’s death, Cardinal Bessarion, then papal legate to the Holy
Roman Empire, who was known for his efforts on behalf of uniting the
Greek and Roman churches and for wishing to spread knowledge of the
Greek classics, came to Vienna. He had a special interest in seeing a
new translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest and suggested to Peurbach that he
undertake this work. Peurbach bequeathed the task to Regiomontanus, who
became attached to Bessarion, accompanying him to Rome,</p>
<p>Re giomont anus</p>
<p>spending time and lecturing at Padua when Bessarion became papal
legate to the Venetian Republic, and meeting numerous international
scholars, some of whom were influential in helping him gain access to
major observatories and library collections.</p>
<p>Among the cities in Central Europe where individuals and institutions
assumed leadership in mathematics and astronomy at this time were
Vienna, Cracow, Prague, and Nuremberg. It was Nuremberg where
Regiomontanus settled on returning to Germany; it would become a center
for the printing of books (as well as for learning, art, and invention),
and some of the greatest scientific classics were published there toward
the middle of the sixteenth century. In Nuremberg, Regiomontanus had
acquired a new patron, and with this merchant’s support, Regiomontanus
established a printing press and an observatory. The trade list of books
he hoped to print survives. It includes translations of works by
Archimedes, Apollonius, Heron, Ptolemy, and Diophantus. We also know of
a variety of astronomical instruments that he designed, including
torqueta, astrolabes, and other astronomical measuring devices; some
were built in his small workshop. Like his other plans, his hopes to
straighten out various discrepancies in astronomy remained largely
unfulfilled, however, because, having been called to Rome for a
conference on reform of the calendar, he died there under disputed
circumstances.</p>
<p>In astronomy, Regiomontanus’s chief contribution was the completion
of the new Latin version, begun by Peurbach, of Ptolemy’s Almagest. A
new textbook of astronomy, Peurbach’s Theoricae Novae Planetarum, was
published in Regiomontanus’s shop in 1472; it was an improvement on the
ubiquitous copies of the Sphere of Sacrobosco. Regiomontanus’s
translation project also resulted in textbooks of his own. His Epitome
of Ptolemy’s Almagest is noteworthy for its emphasis on the mathematical
portions that had often been omitted in commentaries dealing with
elementary descriptive astronomy. Of greater significance for
mathematics, however, was his De Triangulis Omnimodis, a systematic
account of the methods for solving triangles that marked the rebirth of
trigonometry.</p>
<p>Humanists, who insisted on elegance and purity in their classical
languages, welcomed new translations in the sciences, as well as the
humanities, because they abhorred the barbarous medieval Latin, as well
as the Arabic from which it often was derived. Regiomontanus shared the
Humanists’ love of classical learning, but unlike most of them, he
respected the traditions of Scholastic and Islamic scholarship, as well
as the practical innovations of mathematical practitioners.</p>
