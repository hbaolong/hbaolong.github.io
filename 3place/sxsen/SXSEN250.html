<h4 id="the-four-color-conjecture">The Four-Color Conjecture</h4>
<p>The four-color conjecture was first stated by Francis Guthrie
(18311899), an ex-student of Augustus De Morgan’s at University College
who earned a law degree but eventually returned to mathematics and
received an appointment as a professor in South Africa, where he also
distinguished himself as a botanist. In 1852, while still a law student,
Francis Guthrie contemplated the coloring of maps. He requested his
brother Frederick, who by then was also a student of De Morgan’s, to ask
De Morgan about the validity of a conjecture that De Morgan formulated
in a letter to William Rowan Hamilton as follows:</p>
<p>A student of mine asked me today to give him a reason for a fact
which I did not know was a fact and do not yet. He says that if a figure
be anyhow divided and the compartments differently coloured so that
figures with any portion of common boundary line are differently
coloured four colours may be wanted, but not more.</p>
<p>Neither Hamilton nor others whom De Morgan approached had a solution
for the “quaternions of color” problem. Among those who spent some time
on the puzzle were Charles Peirce in the United States and Arthur Cayley
in England. The latter brought it to the attention of the London
Mathematical Society in 1878 and the following year published an
analysis of the problem with the Royal Geographic Society. That same
year, Alfred Bray Kempe (18491922) announced in Nature that he had a
proof of the four-color conjecture.</p>
<p>Kempe had studied mathematics under Cayley at Cambridge and, though
entering the legal profession, devoted some of his time to mathematics
during most of his life. At Cayley’s suggestion, Kempe submitted his
proof to the American Journal of Mathematics, where it was published in
1879. It created interest on both sides of the Atlantic; Kempe offered
more streamlined versions of his proof, and in Edinburgh P. G. Tait even
proceeded to publish two proofs of his own.</p>
<p>In the 1890s, two men called attention to the fact that Kempe’s proof
was flawed. One was de la Vallee Poussin, the other Percy John Heawood´
(18611955), then a lecturer at Durham, where he subsequently became a
professor of mathematics and a mainstay of the university. Kempe could
not fix the problem, informed the London Mathematical Society of the
flaw, and turned to other endeavors, for which he was elected a fellow
and treasurer of the Royal Society and knighted in 1912; he is best
known for his work on linkages. Tait’s proof, too, turned out to contain
errors, as did numerous attempts by other mathematicians who thought
they could solve this simple-sounding puzzle. Heawood, who had been the
first to shatter Kempe’s claim to a proof, showed that every map can be
colored with five colors and proceeded to work on map coloring for
decades to come. His investigations included maps on a variety of
surfaces, and he managed to connect the number of colors with the Euler
characteristic of the surface. In 1898, he also proved that if the
number of edges around each region is divisible by 3, then the regions
can be colored with four colors. Numerous generalizations of this
theorem followed. Among those who published a paper on the four-color
conjecture generalizing Heawood’s work was the noted American geometer
Oswald Veblen (18801960). A year later, in 1913, his countryman George
David Birkhoff published a memoir on reducibility that would lay the
basis for much work on the four-color conjecture for decades to
follow.</p>
<p>Most attempted proofs of the four-color conjecture used methods that
relied on three concepts: “Kempe chains,” “avoidable sets,” and
“reducibility.” “Kempe chains” were basic to Kempe’s approach. Suppose
you are given a map every region (“compartment”) of which, except for
one, is colored either C1, C2, C3, or C4. Let U be the exceptional
region. If U is surrounded by regions of fewer than four colors, then U
can be assigned the missing color, and all is well. If, however, regions
R1, R2, R3, and R4, colored C1, C2, C3, and C4, respectively, surround
U, then either there is no chain of adjacent regions from R1 to R3
alternately colored C1 and C3, or there is such a chain. In the first
case, let R1 be colored C3 rather than C1, and likewise exchange all C1s
and C3s in the chain of adjacent regions joining R1. R3 is not in the
chain, keeps its color C3, and so U can be colored C1. In the second
case, there can be no chain of alternating colors C2 and C4 between R2
and R4. The same procedure used in the first case now can be applied.
What Kempe did not take into consideration was the effect that
interchanging the Ci in one chain may have on others in some of the many
cases he checked off.</p>
<p>Tait had introduced the idea of considering edges, and most
twentiethcentury discussions of the four-color conjecture explained the
attempted proof constructions in intuitively accessible graph theoretic
terms. This meant representing the regions of a map by vertices and
joining vertices of adjacent regions with an edge. The conjecture now
states that the vertices can be colored using four colors, with no two
adjacent vertices having the same color. This leads to the following
definitions: Let the graph representing the map be triangulated by
adding suitable edges to its faces. A portion of a triangulation within
a circuit is called</p>
<p>T he F our C olor C onje c tur e</p>
<p>a configuration. A set of configurations such that any triangulation
must contain an element of the set is called unavoidable.</p>
<p>Suppose a graph cannot be four-colored. A configuration that cannot
be contained in a triangulation of the smallest such graph is called
reducible. In 1922, Philip Franklin (18981965), who had written a
doctoral thesis on the four-color conjecture under Veblen’s direction,
following Birkhoff’s analysis of reducibility, showed that a map with no
more than 25 regions can be colored with 4 colors; others increased the
number of regions to a maximum of 27 (1926), 35 (1940), 39 (1970), and
95 (1976). It was in the 1960s, however, that a new ingredient was added
to the mix that would result in a new kind of proof.</p>
<p>In 1969, the German mathematician Heinrich Heesch (19061995)
introduced a fourth concept: the method of discharging. This consists of
assigning to a vertex of degree i the charge 62i. (Every smallest
counterexample is a 6-connected triangulation.) Euler’s characteristic
implies that the sum of the charges over all of the vertices must be 12.
A given set of configurations can be proved unavoidable if for a
triangulation that does not contain a configuration in that set the
charges can be redistributed (without changing the total charge) so that
no vertex ends up with a positive charge.</p>
<p>Heesch thought that the four-color conjecture could be solved by
considering a set of around 8,900 configurations. He was unable to
follow through on his projected program because some of his
configurations could not be reduced with available methods; he could not
gain access to adequate computer facilities in Germany, and German grant
support for collaborative work in the United States, which had enabled
him to make several trips to the University of Illinois and its
“supercomputer” facilities, was withdrawn.</p>
<p>In 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of
Illinois, using the concept of reducibility with the aid of Kempe
chains, followed through on Heesch’s discharge notion. They ended up
constructing an unavoidable set with nearly 1,500 configurations. After
considerable trial and error, and good judgment tweaking their
unavoidable set and their discharging procedure, Appel and Haken used
1,200 hours of computer time to work through the details of a final
proof.</p>
<p>Using a specially designed computer program, Appel and Haken started
by showing that there is a specific set of 1,936 configurations, each of
which cannot be part of a smallest-size counterexample to the four-color
theorem. In addition, any configuration must have a portion like one of
these 1,936 configurations. Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest
counterexamples existed because any must contain, yet not contain, one
of these 1,936 (later shrunk to 1,436) configurations. (In other words,
they had found an unavoidable set of reduced configurations.) This
contradiction meant there are no counterexamples at all, and the theorem
is true.</p>
<p>The four-color theorem was the first major theorem to be proved using
a computer. Reducibility could be verified and counterchecked by
different programs and computers; the unavoidability portion was checked
by hand, the results ending up on 400 pages of microfilm. The fact that
the entire proof could not be verified line by line by hand raised
considerable doubts among mathematicians about whether it could be
considered a proof in the traditional sense. The Appel-Haken procedure
was subjected to scrutiny by numerous groups. Researchers on both sides
of the Atlantic corrected minor flaws and attempted simpler proofs. In
1977, Appel and Haken published the first of several explanations of
their methodology. A major, detailed explanation and guide through their
proof is found in their 1989 book-length publication.</p>
<p>We note two later contributions to the saga of computer-assisted
proofs that did much to quiet the occasionally vociferous doubts
concerning the validity of such proofs.</p>
<p>In 1997, Neil Robertson, Daniel P. Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin
Thomas published a simpler computer-assisted proof of the four-color
problem. They devised an improved algorithm and needed to check only 633
configurations. They pointed out that they used only 32 discharging
rules, as opposed to Appel and Haken’s 300-plus, and could avoid an
“immersion” problem in discharging by confirming a certain conjecture of
Heesch’s. This aspect of the A-H proof had appeared the most troublesome
to Appel and Haken’s critics. Both parts of the proof required a
computer.</p>
<p>We should mention that both our programs use only integer arithmetic,
and so we need not be concerned with round-off errors and similar
dangers of floating point arithmetic. However, an argument can be made
that our “proof” is not a proof in the traditional sense, because it
contains steps that can never be verified by humans. In particular, we
have not proved the correctness of the compiler we compiled our programs
on, nor have we proved the infallibility of the hardware we ran our
programs on. These have to be taken on faith, and are conceivably a
source of error. However, from a practical point of view, the chance of
a computer error that appears consistently in exactly the same way on
all runs of our programs on all the compilers under all the operating
systems that our programs run on is infinitesimally small compared to
the chance of a human error during the same amount of case-checking.
Apart from this hypothetical possibility of a computer consistently
giving an incorrect answer, the rest of our proof can be verified in the
same way as traditional mathematical proofs. We concede, however, that
verifying a computer program is much more difficult than checking a
mathematical proof of the same length. 〔Robertson et al., 1997〕</p>
<p>In addition, in 2005, the theorem was proved by Georges Gonthier of
Microsoft Research Cambridge and Benjamin Werner of INRIA with</p>
<p>Cla s s i fic at ion of F ini t e Simple Gr oup s</p>
<p>general-purpose theorem-proving software. Specifically, they verified
the Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas proof using INRIA’s Coq
proof assistant that took away the task of having to check the various
computer programs that were previously used. Gonthier stressed that the
significance of their result lay in the fact that they had approached it
as a programming task, rather than as a mathematical one, and he
questioned whether future proof assistants should not be designed with
the programming environment in mind, rather than as an attempt to
replicate the mathematical form of a proof.</p>
