<h4 id="cayley-and-sylvester">Cayley and Sylvester</h4>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, German mathematicians stood
head and shoulders above those of other nationalities in analysis and
geometry, with the universities of Berlin and Go¨ttingen in the lead and
with publication centering on Crelle’s Journal. Algebra, on the other
hand, was for a while almost a British monopoly, with Trinity College,
Cambridge, in theforefrontandthe
CambridgeMathematicalJournalasthechiefmedium of publication.Peacockand
De Morganwere fromTrinity,aswas Cayley,a heavy contributor to both
algebra and geometry, who had graduated as senior wrangler. We have
noted Cayley’s work in analytic geometry, especially in connection with
the use of determinants, but Cayley was also
oneofthefirstmentostudymatrices,anotherinstanceoftheBritishconcern
forformandstructureinalgebra.Thisworkgrewoutofamemoirof1858on the theory
of transformations. If, for example, we follow the transformation</p>
<p>x0 5ax1by T</p>
<p>1 y0 5cx1dy</p>
<p>by another transformation,</p>
<p>xv 5Ax0 1By0</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>2 yv 5Cx0 1Dy0;</p>
<p>then the result (which had appeared earlier, for example, in the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss in 1801) is equivalent to the
single composite transformation</p>
<p>xv 5 Aa1Bc x1 Ab1Bd y</p>
<p>T2T ðð ÞÞ ðð ÞÞ</p>
<p>1 yv 5 Ca1Dc x1 Cb1Dd y:</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, we reverse the order of T1 and T2, so that T2
is the transformation</p>
<p>x0 5Ax1By y0 5Cx1Dy</p>
<p>and T1 is the transformation</p>
<p>xv 5ax0 1by0 yv 5cx0 1dy0; then these two, applied successively, are
equivalent to the single transformation</p>
<p>1 2xyvv5ðaA11dCbCÞÞxx11ððcBaB11dDbDÞÞyy:</p>
<p>T T</p>
<p>5ðcA</p>
<p>Reversing the order of the transformations in general gives a
different result. Expressed in the language of matrices,</p>
<p>c d UC D5 cA1dC cB1dD a b A B aA1bC aB1bD</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>A B a b Aa1Bc Ab1Bd</p>
<p>C DU c d 5Ca1Dc Cb1Dd :</p>
<p>In as much as two matrices are equal, if and only if all
corresponding elements are equal, it is clear that once again we have an
instance of noncommutative multiplication.</p>
<p>The definitionofmultiplication of matricesisasindicatedpreviously,and
the sum of two matrices (of the same dimensions) is defined as the
matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the matrices.
Thus,</p>
<p>1 5 : a b A B a1A b1B c d C D c1C d 1D</p>
<p>Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar K is defined by the
equation</p>
<p>K U5 : a b Ka Kb c d Kc Kd</p>
<p>The matrix</p>
<p>1 0</p>
<p>0 1</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>which is usually denoted by I, leaves every square matrix of second
order invariant under multiplication; hence, it is called the identity
matrix under multiplication. The only matrix leaving another such matrix
invariant under addition is, of course, the zero matrix</p>
<p>0 0</p>
<p>0 0</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>which, consequently, is the identity matrix under addition. With
these definitions, we can think of the operations on matrices as
constituting an</p>
<p>C ay le y and S y l v e s t er</p>
<p>“algebra,” a step that was taken by Cayley and the American
mathematicians Benjamin Peirce (1809 1880) and his son Charles S. Peirce
(1839 1914). The Peirces somewhat played the role in America that
Hamilton, Grassmann, and Cayley had filled in Europe. The study of
matrix algebra and of other noncommutative algebras has everywhere been
one of the chief factors in the development of an increasingly abstract
view of algebra, especially in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving his degree at Trinity, Cayley took to the law
for fourteen years; this interfered little with his mathematical
research, and he published several hundred papers during these years.
Many of the papers were in the theory of algebraic invariants, a field
in which he and his friend James Joseph Sylvester (1814 1897) were
preeminent. Cayley and Sylvester were a study in contrasts, the former
being mild and even-tempered, the latter mercurial and impatient. Both
were Cambridge men—Cayley at Trinity, Sylvester at St. John’s—but
Sylvester was ineligible for a degree because he was a Jew. For three
years following 1838, Sylvester had taught at University College,
London, where he was a colleague of his former teacher De Morgan; after
this, he accepted a professorship at the University of Virginia.
Discipline problems so upset the temperamental mathematician that he
left precipitately after only three months. When he returned to England,
he spent almost ten years in business and then turned to the study of
law, in connection with which, in 1850, he first met Cayley. The two men
were ever afterward friends and mathematicians, and, ultimately, both
left the law. In 1854, Sylvester took a position at the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich, and in 1863, Cayley accepted the Sadlerian
professorship at Cambridge. In 1876, Sylvester had one more fling at
teaching in America, this time at the newly established Johns Hopkins
University, where he remained until he was almost seventy, when he
accepted a professorship offered him by Oxford University. In 1881,
while Sylvester was still at Johns Hopkins, Cayley accepted an
invitation to deliver there a series of lectures on Abelian and theta
functions. Although Cayley’s papers, which rival those of Euler and
Cauchy in number, are predominantly in algebra and geometry, he did also
contribute to analysis, and his only book, published in 1876, is a
Treatise on Elliptic Functions.</p>
<p>Cayley’s interests were divided, but Sylvester’s loyalty to algebra
was firm, and it is fitting that his name is attached to what is known
as Sylvester’s dialytic method in eliminating an unknown from two
polynomial equations. The device is a simple one and consists of
multiplying one or both of the two equations by the unknown quantity to
be eliminated, repeating the process if necessary until the total number
of equations is 1 greater than the number of powers of the unknown. From
this set of n11 equations, one can then eliminate all of the n powers,
thinking of each power as a different unknown. Thus, to eliminate x from
the pair of equations x2 1ax1b50 and x3 1cx2 1dx1e50, one multiplies the
first by x and then multiplies the resulting equation, and also the
second equation above, by x. Then, thinking of each of the four powers
of x as a separate unknown, the determinant</p>
<p>0 0 1 a b</p>
<p>0 1 a b 0</p>
<p>1 a b 0 0 ;</p>
<p>0 1 c d e</p>
<p>1 c d e 0</p>
<p>known as the resultant in Sylvester’s method, when equated to zero
gives the result of the elimination.</p>
<p>More important than his work in elimination was Sylvester’s
collaboration with Cayley in the development of the theory of “forms”
(or “quantics,” as Cayley preferred to call them), through which the men
came to be known as “invariant twins.” Between 1854 and 1878, Sylvester
published almost a dozen papers on forms—homogeneous polynomials in two
or more variables—and their invariants. The most important cases in
analytic geometry and physics are the quadratic forms in two and three
variables, for, when equated to a constant, these represent conics and
quadrics. In particular, the quantic or form Ax2 12Bxy1Cy2, when equated
to a nonzero constant, represents an ellipse (real or imaginary), a
parabola, or a hyperbola according as B2 2AC is less than, equal to, or
greater than zero. Moreover, if the form is transformed under a rotation
of axes about the origin into the new form Aux2 12Buxy1Cuy2, then (Bu)2
2AuCu 5B2 2AC, that is, the expression B2 2AC, known as the
characteristic of the form, is an invariant under such a transformation.
The expression A1C is another invariant. Still other important
invariants associated with the form are the roots k1 and k2 of the
characteristic equation</p>
<p>A2k B A0 2k B0 50 or 2 2 50:</p>
<p>B C 2k B0 C0 2k</p>
<p>These roots are, in fact, the coefficients of x and y in the
canonical form k1x2 1k2y2 to which the form, if not of parabolic type,
can be reduced through a rotation of axes. The effervescent Sylvester
boasted that he had discovered and developed the reduction of binary
forms to canonical form at one sitting “with a decanter of port wine to
sustain nature’s flagging energies.”</p>
<p>If we designate by M the matrix of coefficients of the form and by I
the identity matrix of order two, the characteristic equation can be
written as 9M2kI950, where the vertical lines represent the determinant
of the matrix. One of the important properties of the algebra of
matrices is that a matrix M satisfies its characteristic equation, a
result given in 1858 and</p>
<p>Line ar A s s o c iat ive Algebra s</p>
<p>known as the Hamilton-Cayley theorem. It is sometimes held that
Cayley’s algebra of matrices was an outcome of Hamilton’s algebra of
quaternions, but in 1894, Cayley specifically denied such a link. He
admired the theory of quaternions, but he asserted that his development
of matrices stemmed from that of determinants as a convenient mode of
expressing a transformation. In fact, Cayley’s publication of 1858
reflects not only the influence of Hamilton’s quaternions but Cayley’s
concern with the issues raised by the operational calculus of the day.
These two factors are also evident in an earlier publication (1845), in
which he had provided an example of a nonassociative algebra.</p>
