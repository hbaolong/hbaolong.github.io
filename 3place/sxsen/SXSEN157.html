<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>While Pascal in 1654 was working on his Conics, his friend the
Chevalier de Mer´ e raised with him questions such as the following: In
eight throws´ of a die, a player is to attempt to throw a 1, but after
three unsuccessful trials, the game is interrupted. How should he be
indemnified? Pascal wrote to Fermat on this, and their resulting
correspondence became the effective starting point for the modern theory
of probability, the thoughts of Cardan of a century earlier having been
overlooked. Although neither Pascal nor Fermat wrote up their results,
Christiaan Huygens in 1657 published a little tract, De ratiociniis in
ludo aleae (On Reasoning in Games of Dice), that was prompted by the
correspondence of the Frenchmen. Pascal, meanwhile, had connected the
study of probability with the arithmetic triangle, carrying the
discussion so far beyond the work of Cardan that the triangular
arrangement has ever since been known as Pascal’s triangle. The triangle
itself was more than 600 years old, but Pascal disclosed some new
properties, such as the following:</p>
<p>In every arithmetic triangle, if two cells are contiguous in the same
base, the upper is to the lower as the number of cells from the upper to
the top of the base is to the number of those from the lower to the
bottom inclusive.</p>
<p>(Pascal called positions in the same vertical column, in Fig. 15.12,
“cells of the same perpendicular rank,” and those in the same horizontal
row “cells of the same parallel rank”; cells in the same upward-sloping
diagonal he called “cells of the same base.”) The method of proof of
this property is of more significance than the property itself, for here
in 1654 Pascal gave an eminently clear-cut explanation of the method of
mathematical induction.</p>

<p>Fermat hoped to interest Pascal in the theory of numbers, and in
1654, he sent him a statement of one of his most beautiful theorems
(unproved until the nineteenth century):</p>
<p>Every integer is composed of one, two, or three triangular numbers,
of one, two, three, or four squares, of one, two, three, four, or five
pentagons, of one, two, three, four, five, or six hexagons, and thus to
infinity.</p>
<p>Pascal, however, was a mathematical dilettante, as well as a
virtuoso, and did not pursue this problem.</p>
<p>The Cycloid</p>
<p>On the night of November 23, 1654, from ten thirty to about twelve
thirty, Pascal experienced a religious ecstasy that caused him to</p>
<p>Pascal’s triangle in Japan. From Murai Chuzen’s Sampo Doshi mon
(1781), also showing the sangi forms of the numerals.</p>
<p>abandon science and mathematics for theology. The result was the
writing of the Lettres provinciales and the Pense´es; for only one brief
period, in 1658 1659, did Pascal return to mathematics. One night in
1658, toothache or illness prevented him from falling asleep, and as a
distraction from the pain, he turned to the study of the cycloid.
Miraculously, the pain eased, and Pascal took this as a sign from God
that the study of mathematics was not displeasing to Him. Having found
certain areas, volumes, and centers of gravity associated with the
cycloid, Pascal proposed half a dozen such questions to the
mathematicians of his day, offering first and second prizes for their
solution—and naming Roberval as one of the judges. Publicity and timing
were so poor that only two sets of solutions were submitted, and these
contained at least some errors in computation. Pascal therefore awarded
no prize, but he did publish his own solutions, along with other
results, all preceded by a Histoire de la roulette (the name usually
used for the curve in France), in a series of Lettres de A. Dettonville
(1658 1659). (The name Amos Dettonville was an anagram of Louis de
Montalte, the pseudonym used in the Lettres provinciales.) The contest
questions and the Lettres de A. Dettonville brought interest in the
cycloid to a focus, but they also stirred up a hornets’ nest of
controversy. The two finalists, Antoine de Lalouvere and John Wallis,`
both capable mathematicians, were disgruntled that prizes were withheld,
and the Italian mathematicians were indignant that Pascal’s History of
the Cycloid gave virtually no credit to Torricelli, priority in
discovery being conceded only to Roberval.</p>
<p>Much of the material in the Lettres de A. Dettonville, such as the
equality of the arcs of spirals and parabolas, as well as the cycloid
contest questions, had been known to Roberval and Torricelli, but some
of this appeared in print for the first time. Among the new results was
the equality of the arc length of an arch of the generalized cycloid
x5aKφ2asinφ, y5a2acosφ and the semicircumference of the ellipse
x52a(11K)cosφ, y52a(l2K)sinφ. The theorem was expressed rhetorically,
rather than symbolically, and it was demonstrated in an essentially
Archimedean manner, as were most of Pascal’s demonstrations in 1658
1659.</p>
<p>In connection with an integration of the sine function in his 1658
Traite´ des sinus du quart de cercle (Treatise on the Sines of a
Quadrant of a Circle), Pascal came remarkably close to a discovery of
the calculus—so close that Leibniz later wrote that it was on reading
this work by Pascal that a light suddenly burst on him. Had Pascal not
died, like Torricelli, shortly after his thirty-ninth birthday, or had
he been more single-mindedly the mathematician or had he been more
attracted by algorithmic methods than by geometry and speculations on
the philosophy of mathematics, there is little doubt that he would have
anticipated Newton and Leibniz in their greatest discovery.</p>
