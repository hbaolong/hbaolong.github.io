<h4 id="tschirnhaus-transformations">Tschirnhaus Transformations</h4>
<p>Continental Europe had not escaped controversy over the foundations
of the calculus, but there the effect was felt less than in England. As
early as in Leibniz’s day, objections to the new analysis had been
raised by a Saxon nobleman, Count Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus
(1651 1708). His name is still perpetuated in the “Tschirnhaus
transformations” in algebra, by which he hoped to find a general method
for solving equations of higher degree. A Tschirnhaus transformation of
a polynomial equation f(x)50 is one of the form y5g(x)/h(x), where g and
h are polynomials and h does not vanish for a root of f(x)50. The
transformations by which Cardan and Vie`te solved the cubic were special
cases of such transformations. In the Acta Eruditorum of 1683,
Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhausen) showed that a polynomial of degree n.2
can be reduced by his transformations to a form in which the
coefficients of the terms of degrees n21 and n22 are both zero; for the
cubic, he found a transformation of the form y5x2 1ax1b, which reduced
the general cubic to the form y3 5K.</p>
<p>Another such transformation reduced the quartic to y4 1py2 1q50, thus
adding new methods of solving the cubic and the quartic.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus hoped to develop similar algorithms that would reduce the
general equation of nth degree to a “pure” equation of nth degree
containing only the terms of degree n and degree zero. His
transformations constituted the most promising contribution to the
solution of equations during the seventeenth century, but his
elimination of the second and third coefficients by means of such
transformations was far from adequate for the solution of the quintic.
Even when the Swedish mathematician E. S. Bring (1736 1798) showed in
1786 that a</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus transformation can be found that reduces the general
quintic to the form y5 1py1q50, the solution still remained elusive. In
1834,</p>
<p>S olid Anal y t ic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>G. B. Jerrard (1804 1863), a Briton, showed that a Tschirnhaus
transformation can be found that will eliminate the terms of degrees n21
and n22 and n23 from any polynomial equation of degree n.3, but the
power of the method is limited by the fact that equations of the fifth
and higher degree are not solvable algebraically. Jerrard’s belief that
he could solve all algebraic equations was illusory.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus is noted as the discoverer of caustics by reflection
(catacaustics), which bear his name. It was his report on these curves,
the envelopes of a family of rays from a point source and reflected in a
curve, that resulted in his election in 1682 to the Paris Acade´mie des
Sciences, and interest in caustics and similar families was continued by
Leibniz, L’Hospital, Jacques and Jean Bernoulli, and others. His name is
also attached to the “Tschirnhaus cubic” a5rcos3θ/3, a form later
generalized by Maclaurin to rn 5a cosnθ for n rational.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus had been in touch with Oldenburg and Leibniz during the
formative years of the calculus, and he had also contributed many
mathematical articles to the Acta Eruditorum after its establishment in
1682. Some of Tschirnhaus’s work, however, was hastily composed and
published prematurely, and the Bernoulli brothers and others pointed out
errors. At one point, Tschirnhaus rejected the basic concepts of the
calculus and of infinite series, insisting that algebraic methods would
suffice. In Holland, objections to the calculus of Leibniz had been
raised in 1694 1696 by the physician and geometer Bernard Nieuwentijt
(1654 1718). In three separate treatises published during these years in
Amsterdam, he admitted the correctness of the results, but he criticized
the vagueness of Newton’s evanescent quantities and the lack of clear
definition in Leibniz’s differentials of higher order.</p>
<p>Solid Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>In 1695, Leibniz had defended himself in the Acta Eruditorum from his
“overprecise” critic, and in 1701, a more detailed refutation of
Nieuwentijt came from Switzerland from the pen of Jacob Hermann (1678
1733), a devoted pupil of Jacques Bernoulli. Illustrating the mobility
of mathematicians during the early eighteenth century, Hermann taught
mathematics at the Universities of Padua, Frankfort on the Oder, and
St. Petersburg before concluding his career at the University of Basel,
his hometown. In the Commentarii Academiae Petropolitanae for the years
1729 1733, Hermann made contributions to solid analytic geometry and to
polar coordinates in continuation of results made by the older Bernoulli
brothers. Where Jacques Bernoulli had rather hesitantly applied polar
coordinates to spirals, Hermann gave polar equations of algebraic curves
as well, together with equations of transformation from rectangular to
polar coordinates. Hermann’s use of space coordinates was also bolder
than that of Jean Bernoulli, who as early as 1692 had first referred to
the use of coordinates as “Cartesian geometry.” Bernoulli had rather
timidly suggested an extension of Cartesian geometry to three
dimensions, but Hermann effectively applied space coordinates to planes
and several types of quadratic surfaces. He made a beginning in the use
of direction angles by showing that the sine of the angle that the plane
az1by1cx5c2 makes with the xy-plane is given by pb2 1c2=pa2 1b2 1c2.</p>
<p>Michel Rolle and PierreVarignon</p>
<p>In France, as well as in England, Germany, and Holland, there was a
group in the Acade´mie des Sciences, especially shortly after 1700, that
questioned the validity of the new infinitesimal methods as presented by
L’Hospital. Among these was Michel Rolle (1652 1719), whose name is
recalled in connection with Rolle’s theorem, published in 1691 in an
obscure book on geometry and algebra titled Me´thode pour re´soudre les
e´galite´z: If a function is differentiable in the interval from a to b,
and if f(a)505f(b), then fu(x)50 has at least one real root between a
and b. The theorem, now so important in the calculus, was given only
incidentally by Rolle in connection with an approximate solution of
equations.</p>
<p>Rolle’s attack on the calculus, which he described as a collection of
ingenious fallacies, was answered vigorously by Pierre Varignon (1654
1722), Jean Bernoulli’s “best friend in France” and one who had also
been corresponding with Leibniz. Bernoulli simply told Rolle that he did
not understand the subject, but Varignon sought to clarify the situation
by showing indirectly that the infinitesimal methods could be reconciled
with the geometry of Euclid. Most of the group opposing the calculus
were admirers of the ancient synthetic geometry, and the controversy in
the Acade´mie des Sciences reminds one of the then contemporary literary
controversy on “ancients vs. moderns.”</p>
<p>Varignon, like the Bernoullis, had not at first expected to be a
mathematician, being intended for the church, but when he accidentally
came across a copy of Euclid’s Elements, he changed his mind and held
professorships in mathematics in Paris, becoming a member of the
Acade´mie. In the Memoirs of the Acade´mie des Sciences for 1704, he
continued and extended Jacques Bernoulli’s use of polar coordinates,
including an elaborate classification of spirals obtained from algebraic
curves, such as the parabolas and the hyperbolas of Fermat, by
interpreting the ordinate as a radius vector and the abscissa as a
vectorial arc. Varignon, one of the first French scholars to appreciate
the calculus, had prepared a commentary on L’Hospital’s Analyse, but
this appeared only in 1725, after both men had died, under the title
Eclaircissemens sur l’analyse des infiniments petits. Varignon was a
more careful writer than</p>
<p>T he C lairaut s</p>
<p>L’Hospital, and he warned that infinite series were not to be used
without investigation of the remainder term. Hence, he had been rather
worried about the attacks on the calculus, and in 1701, he had written
to Leibniz about his differences with Rolle:</p>
<p>The Abbe´ Galloys, who is really behind the whole thing, is spreading
the report here 〔in Paris〕 that you have explained that you mean by
the “differential” or the “infinitely small” a very small, but
nevertheless constant and definite, quantity….I, on the other hand, have
called a thing infinitely small, or the differential of a quantity, if
that quantity is inexhaustible in comparison with the thing.</p>
<p>The view that Varignon expressed here is far from clear, but at least
he recognized that a differential is a variable, rather than a constant.
Leibniz’s reply from Hanover in 1702 seeks to avoid metaphysical
quarrels, but his use of the phrase “incomparably small quantities” for
differentials was scarcely more satisfactory than Varignon’s
explanation. Varignon’s defense of the calculus nevertheless seems to
have won Rolle’s approval.</p>
<p>Rolle had also raised embarrassing questions about analytic geometry,
especially concerning the Cartesian graphical solution of equations, so
popular at the time. To solve f(x)50, for example, one arbitrarily chose
a curve g(x, y)50 and, on combining it with f(x)50, obtained a new curve
h(x, y)50 the intersections of which with g(x, y)50 furnish the
solutions of f(x)50. Rolle saw that extraneous solutions may be
introduced through this procedure. In his best-known work, the Traite´
d’alge`bre of 1690, Rolle seems to have been first to state that there
are n values for the nth root of a number, but he was able to prove this
only for n53, for he died before the relevant works of Cotes and De
Moivre appeared.</p>
<p>Rolle was the most capable mathematician in the group from the
Acade´mie des Sciences that criticized the calculus. When he was
convinced by Varignon of the essential soundness of the new analysis,
opposition collapsed, and the subject entered a century of unimpeded and
rapid development on the continent of Europe. An outstanding example of
how much a talented and dedicated member of a later generation could
achieve using the new methods is provided by Alexis Clairaut.</p>
