<h4 id="omar-khayyam">Omar Khayyam</h4>
<p>Arabic mathematics can with some propriety be divided into four
parts: (1) an arithmetic presumably derived from India and based on the
principle of position; (2) an algebra that, although from Greek, Hindu,
and Babylonian sources, nevertheless in Muslim hands assumed a
characteristically new and systematic form; (3) a trigonometry the
substance of which came chiefly from Greece but to which the Arabs
applied the Hindu form and added new functions and formulas; and (4) a
geometry that came from Greece but to which the Arabs contributed
generalizations here and there. There was a significant contribution
about a century after Alhazen by a man who in the East is known as a
scientist but whom the West recalls as one of the greatest Persian
poets. Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050 1123), the “tent-maker,” wrote an Algebra
that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of the third
degree. Like his Arabic predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided both
arithmetic and geometric solutions for quadratic equations; for general
cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later
showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence, he gave only
geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve
cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazen, but
Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to
cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). When in an
earlier work he came across a cubic equation, he specifically remarked,
“This cannot be solved by plane geometry 〔i.e., using straightedge
and</p>
<p>Omar K hay yam</p>
<p>compasses only〕 since it has a cube in it. For the solution we need
conic sections” (Amir-Moez 1963, p. 328).</p>
<p>For equations of a higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently
did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain
more than three dimensions, “what is called square-square by algebraists
in continuous magnitude is a theoretical fact. It does not exist in
reality in any way.” The procedure that Omar Khayyam so tortuously—and
so proudly—applied to cubic equations can be stated with far greater
succinctness in modern notation and concepts as follows. Let the cubic
be x3 1ax2 1b2x 1c3 50. Then, if for x2 in this equation we substitute
22 py, we obtain (recalling that3 x3 5x2 x) the result 2pxy12apy1b x 1c
50. Because the resulting equation represents a hyperbola, and the
equality x2 52py used in the substitution represents a parabola, it is
clear that if the hyperbola and the parabola are sketched on the same
set of coordinate axes, then the abscissas of the points of intersection
of the two curves will be the roots of the cubic equation. Obviously,
many other pairs of conic sections can be used in a similar way to solve
the cubic.</p>
<p>Our exposition of Omar Khayyam’s work does not do justice to his
genius, for, lacking the concept of negative coefficients, he had to
break the problem into many separate cases according as the parameters
a, b, c
arepositive,negative,orzero.Moreover,hehadtospecificallyidentifyhis
conicsectionsforeachcase,fortheconceptofageneralparameterwasnot
athandinhisday.Notallrootsofagivencubicequationweregiven,forhe did not
accept the appropriateness of negative roots and did not note all
intersections of the conic sections. It should also be mentioned that in
the earlier Greek geometric solutions of cubic equations, the
coefficients had been line segments, whereas in the work of Omar Khayyam
they were specific numbers. One of the most fruitful contributions of
Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical
and geometric
algebra.ThedecisivestepinthisdirectioncamemuchlaterwithDescartes, but
Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, “Whoever thinks
algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No
attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are
different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved.”
In replacing Euclid’s theory of proportions with a numerical approach,
he cameclosetoadefinitionoftheirrationalandstruggledwiththeconceptof
real number in general.</p>
<p>In his Algebra, Omar Khayyam wrote that elsewhere he had set forth a
rule that he had discovered for finding fourth, fifth, sixth, and higher
powers of a binomial, but such a work is not extant. It is presumed that
he was referring to the Pascal triangle arrangement, one that seems to
have appeared in China at about the same time. Such a coincidence is not
easy to explain, but until further evidence is available, independence
of discovery is to be assumed. Intercommunication between Arabia and
China was not extensive at that time, but there was a silk route
connecting China with Persia, and information might have trickled along
it.</p>
