<h4 id="gausss-influence">Gauss’s Influence</h4>
<p>Despite the relatively small number of well-known mathematicians who
could claim to be Gauss’s students in the formal sense, it is hard to
overestimate the influence Gauss had on successive generations. Those
who studied his publications, the few who came to see him, the ones who
followed the new avenues of research he had opened include some of the
best-known mathematicians of the nineteenth century. When it came to his
expressed opinion of the work of others, his impact was not always
salutary, however. Toward the end of his life, Gauss may have become
uncharacteristically generous in his comments; we note the well-deserved
appreciation of Riemann’s habilitation and the questionable enthusiasm
concerning Eisenstein.</p>
<p>We now turn to the work of some who benefited directly from study of
his publications, especially the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, and from
indirect encouragement through the example he set. In several cases,
their</p>
<p>studies of Gauss’s work supplemented their exposure to the
investigations of Legendre.</p>
<p>Abel</p>
<p>Niels Henrik Abel’s short life (1802 1829) was filled with poverty
and tragedy. He was born into a large family, the son of the pastor of
the little village of Findo in Norway. When he was sixteen, his teacher
urged him to read the great books in mathematics, including the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss. In his reading, Abel noted that
Euler had proved the binomial theorem only for rational powers, so he
filled the gap by giving a proof valid for the general case. When Abel
was eighteen, his father died, and much of the care of the family fell
on his young and weak shoulders, yet within the next year, he made a
remarkable mathematical discovery. Ever since the cubic and quartic
equations had been solved in the sixteenth century, men had studied the
quintic. Abel at first thought he had hit on a solution, but in 1824, he
published a memoir, “On the Algebraic Resolution of Equations,” in which
he reached the opposite conclusion. He gave the first proof that no
solution is possible, thus putting an end to the long search. There can
be no general formula, expressed in explicit algebraic operations on the
coefficients of a polynomial equation, for the roots of the equation if
the degree of the equation is greater than 4. An earlier proof, less
satisfactory and generally overlooked, of the insolvability of the
quintic had been published in 1799 by Paolo Ruffini (1765 1822), and
hence the result is now referred to as the Abel-Ruffini theorem.</p>
<p>When Abel visited Paris in 1826, he hoped his research results would
gain him recognition by members of the Academy. He found the city
inhospitable, however, and wrote home to a friend, “Every beginner has a
great deal of difficulty in getting noticed here. I have just finished
an extensive treatise on a certain class of transcendental functions but
Mr. Cauchy scarcely deigns to glance at it.” The publication in question
contained what he considered the jewel in his bag of mathematical
treasures, “Abel’s addition theorem,” a grand generalization of Euler’s
addition theorems on elliptic integrals. Before arriving in Paris, Abel
had spent some time in Berlin and had been well received by Crelle, who
was about to inaugurate his new Journal. He invited Abel to contribute
to the publication. Abel complied; the first volume contained six
articles by him, which were followed by more for succeeding volumes.
They included the expanded version of his proof of the insolvability of
the quintic, as well as his further contributions to the theory of
elliptic and hyperelliptic functions. While these were appearing in
Berlin, Abel had returned to his native Norway; increasingly weakened by
tuberculosis, he kept sending more material to Crelle. He died in 1829,
scarcely aware of the interest his publications were creating. Two days
after his death, a letter arrived offering him a position in Berlin.</p>
<p>Jacobi</p>
<p>What created something of a sensation and helped increase the
readership of Crelle’s new journal was the fact that Abel was not alone
in his new discoveries. The Prussian mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob
Jacobi (1804 1851) was obtaining many of the same results independently;
moreover, he, too, was publishing them in the early volumes of Crelle’s
journal. It became apparent to men such as Legendre that both Abel and
Jacobi were forging new tools of great consequence. What was not
generally known was that the unpublished memoranda of Gauss hung like a
sword of Damocles over mathematics of the first half of the nineteenth
century. When an important new development was announced by others, it
frequently turned out that Gauss had had the idea earlier but had
permitted it to go unpublished. Among the striking instances of this
situation was the disclosure of elliptic functions, a discovery in which
four outstanding figures are involved. One of these was, of course,
Legendre, who had spent some forty years studying elliptic integrals
almost single-handedly. He had developed a great many formulas, some of
them resembling relationships among inverse trigonometric functions (a
number of which had been known much earlier to Euler). This was not
surprising, inasmuch as the elliptic integral</p>
<p>dx</p>
<p>pð12K2x2Þð12x2Þ</p>
<p>includes</p>
<p>dx</p>
<p>pð12x2Þ</p>
<p>as the special case for which K50. Yet it remained for Gauss and his
two younger contemporaries to take full advantage of a point of view
that greatly facilitates the study of elliptic integrals. If</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5p 2 ;</p>
<p>0 12x</p>
<p>then u5arcsin v. Here u is expressed as a function of the independent
variable v (x being only the dummy variable for integrating), but it
turns out to be more felicitous to reverse the roles of u and v by
choosing u as the independent variable. In this case, we have v5f(u),
or, in the language of trigonometry, v5sinu. The function v5sinu is more
expeditiously manipulated, and it has a striking property that u5arcsin
v does not have: it is periodic. The private papers of Gauss show that
perhaps as early as 1800, he had discovered the double periodicity of
elliptic (or lemniscatic) functions. It was not until 1827 1828,
however, that this remarkable property was disclosed by Abel.</p>
<p>In 1829, Jacobi wrote to Legendre to inquire about the memoir Abel
had left with Cauchy, for Jacobi had intimations that it touched on his
outstanding discovery. On looking into the matter, Cauchy in 1830 dug up
the manuscript, which Legendre later described as “a monument more
lasting than bronze,” and it was published in 1841 by the French
Institut among the memoirs presented by foreigners. It contained an
important generalization of Legendre’s work on elliptic integrals.
If</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5;</p>
<p>0pð12K2x2Þð12x2Þ</p>
<p>u is a function of v, u5f(v), the properties of which had been very
extensively described by Legendre in his treatise on elliptic integrals.
What Legendre had missed and what Gauss, Abel, and Jacobi saw was that
by inverting the functional relationship between u and v, one obtains a
more useful and more beautiful function, v5f(u). This function, usually
written v5sn u and read as “v is the sine amplitude of u,” together with
others defined in a somewhat similar manner, are known as elliptic
functions. (Some historical confusion has arisen because Legendre used
the phrase “fonctions elliptiques” to refer to elliptic integrals and
not to what are now known as elliptic functions.)</p>
<p>The most striking property of these new higher transcendental
functions was, as their three independent discoverers saw, that in the
theory of complex variables they have a double periodicity, that is,
there are two complex numbers m and n, such that
v5f(u)5f(u1m)5f(u1n).</p>
<p>Whereas the trigonometric functions have only a real period (a period
of</p>
<p>2π) and the function ex has only an imaginary period (2πi), the
elliptic functions have two distinct periods. So impressed was Jacobi
with the simplicity achieved through a simple inversion of the
functional relationship in elliptic integrals that he regarded the
advice “You must always invert” as the secret of success in
mathematics.</p>
<p>Jacobi also deserves credit for several critical theorems related to
elliptic functions. In 1834, he proved that if a single-valued function
of one variable is doubly periodic, the ratio of the periods cannot be
real, and that it is impossible for a single-valued function of a single
independent variable to have more than two distinct periods. To him, we
also owe a study of the “Jacobi theta functions,” a class of quasi
doubly periodic entire functions of which the elliptic functions are
quotients.</p>
<p>The fateful misplaced memoir by Abel contained the hint of something
even more general than the elliptical functions. If one replaces the
elliptic integral with</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5;</p>
<p>0pPðxÞ</p>
<p>where P(x) is a polynomial the degree of which may exceed four, and
if one again inverts the relationship between u and v, to obtain v5f(u),
this function is a special case of what is known as an Abelian function.
It was Jacobi, however, who in 1832 first demonstrated that the
inversion can be carried out not only for a single variable but for
functions of several variables.</p>
<p>The most celebrated results of his research were those in elliptic
functions, published in 1829, which brought him the praise of Legendre.
By means of this new analysis, Jacobi later proved again the four-square
theorem of Fermat and Lagrange. In 1829, Jacobi also published a paper
in which he made extensive and general use of Jacobians, expressing
these in a more modern form than had Cauchy:</p>

<p>Jacobi became so enamored of functional determinants that he insisted
on thinking of ordinary numerical determinants as Jacobians of n linear
functions in n unknowns.</p>
<p>Jacobi’suseoffunctionaldeterminantsinapaperonalgebrain1829was only
incidental, as had been that of Cauchy. Had this been the only
contribution from the pen of Jacobi, his name would not have been
attached to the particular determinant that we are considering. In 1841,
however, he published a long memoir, “De Determinantibus
Functionalibus,” specifically devoted to the Jacobian. He pointed out,
among other things,that this functional determinant is in many ways an
analogue, for functions of several variables, to the differential
quotient of a function of a single variable, and, of course, he called
attention to its role in determining whether a set of equations or
functions is independent. He showed that if a set of n functions in n
variables are functionally related, the Jacobian must vanish
identically; if the functions are mutually independent, the Jacobian
cannot be identically zero.</p>
<p>Galois</p>
<p>Young geniuses whose lives were cut short by death from dueling or
consumption are part of the real and fictional literary tradition of the
Romantic Age. Someone wishing to present a mathematical caricature of
such lives could do no better than to create the characters of Abel and
Galois. E´variste Galois (1812 1832) was born just outside Paris in the
village of Bourg-la-Reine, where his father served as mayor. His
welleducated parents had not shown any particular aptitude for
mathematics, but the young Galois did acquire from them an implacable
hatred of tyranny. When he first entered school at the age of twelve, he
showed little interest in Latin, Greek, or algebra, but he was
fascinated by Legendre’s Geometry. Later, he read with understanding the
algebra and the analysis in the works of masters such as Lagrange and
Abel, but his routine class work in mathematics remained mediocre, and
his teachers regarded him as eccentric. By the age of sixteen, Galois
knew what his teachers had failed to recognize—that he was a
mathematical genius. He hoped, therefore, to enter the school that had
nurtured so many celebrated mathematicians, the E´cole Polytechnique,
but his lack of systematic preparation resulted in his rejection.</p>
<p>This disappointment was followed by others. A paper Galois wrote and
presented to the Academy when he was seventeen was held up by Cauchy; he
failed in a second attempt to enter the E´cole Polytechnique; worst of
all, his father, feeling persecuted because of clerical intrigues,
committed suicide. Galois entered the E´cole Normale to prepare for
teaching; he also continued his research. In 1830, he submitted another
paper to the Academy in a prize competition. Fourier, as secretary of
the Academy, received the paper but died shortly thereafter, and this
memoir was lost. Faced on all sides by tyranny and frustration, Galois
made the cause of the 1830 revolution his own. A blistering letter
criticizing the indecision of the director of the E´cole Normale
resulted in Galois’s expulsion. A third effort to present a paper to the
Academy resulted in its being returned by Poisson with a request for
proofs. Thoroughly disillusioned, Galois joined the National Guard. In
1831, he was twice arrested; he had proposed a toast in a gathering of
republicans that was interpreted as a threat on the life of King Louis
Philippe. Shortly afterward, he became involved with a coquette and was
challenged to a duel. The night before the duel, with forebodings of
death, Galois spent the hours jotting down, in a letter to a friend
named Chevalier, notes for posterity concerning his discoveries. He
asked that the letter be published (as it was within the year) in the
Revue Encydope´dique and expressed the hope that Jacobi and Gauss might
publicly give their opinion as to the importance of the theorems. On the
morning of May 30, 1832, Galois met his adversary in a duel with
pistols, which resulted in his death the following day. He was twenty
years old.</p>
<p>In 1846, Joseph Liouville edited several memoirs and manuscript
fragments of Galois and published these, along with the last letter to
Chevalier in his Journal de Mathe´matiques. This marks the beginning of
the effective dissemination of Galois’s ideas, although some clues to
Galois’s work had been published earlier. Two papers by Galois had
appeared in Ferussac’s Bulletin Sciences Mathe´matiques of 1830. In the
first, Galois had listed three criteria for the solvability of a
“primitive” equation; the chief of these was the beautiful proposition
that</p>
<p>In order that an irreducible equation of prime degree be solvable by
radicals, it is necessary and sufficient that all its roots be rational
functions of any two of them.</p>
<p>Aside from referring to Gauss’s cyclotomic equation and noting that
his results had been derived from the theory of permutations, this paper
contained no indication of the method used to derive results and no
proofs. In the other paper, on number theory, Galois showed how to
construct finite fields of order p given the root of an irreducible
congruence of degree n mod p. Here, too, he stressed the analogy to
Gauss’s results in Section III of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. His
letter to Chevalier, published in September 1832, had contained an
outline of the main results of the memoir that had been returned by the
Academy. There, Galois had indicated what he considered to be the
essential part of his theory. In particular, he stressed the difference
between adjoining one or all of the roots of the resolvent and related
it to the decomposition of the group G of the equation. In modern
terminology, he indicated that an extension of the given field is normal
if and only if the corresponding subgroup is a normal subgroup of G. He
observed that an equation whose group cannot be properly decomposed (one
whose group does not have a normal subgroup) should be transformed into
one that can. Then, he noted the equivalent of saying that an equation
is solvable if and only if one obtains a chain of normal subgroups of
prime index. Unaccompanied by proofs, definitions, or adequate
explanations of the new concepts involved, the profound content of the
letter was not understood until Liouville published the full memoir,
along with these previously published papers.</p>
<p>The main goal of the memoir is the proof of the theorem quoted
previously. The memoir contains the important notion of
“adjunction”:</p>
<p>We shall call every quantity rational which is expressed as a
rational function of the coefficients of the equation and of a certain
number of quantities adjoined to the equation and selected
arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Galois noted that Gauss’s cyclotomic equation of prime degree n is
irreducible until a root of one of the auxiliary equations is
adjoined.</p>
<p>Gauss, in his criteria for the constructibility of regular polygons,
had in essence solved the question of the solvability of the equation
a0Xn 1an 50 in terms of rational operations and square roots on the
coefficients. Galois generalized the result to provide criteria for the
solvability of a0Xn 1a1Xn1 1 1an 1X 1an 50 in terms of rational
operations and nth roots on the coefficients. His approach to the
problem, now known as Galois theory, was another of the highly original
contributions to algebra in the nineteenth century. Yet it has been said
that Galois theory is like garlic, in that there is no such thing as a
little of it. One must make a substantial study of it to appreciate the
reasoning—as Galois’s experience with his contemporaries showed.
Nevertheless, we can indicate in a general way what is behind Galois
theory and why it has been important.</p>
<p>Galois began his investigations with some work of Lagrange on
permutations on the roots of a polynomial equation. Any change in the
ordered arrangement of n objects is called a permutation on these
objects. If, for example, the order of the letters a, b, c is changed to
c, a, b, this permutation is written succinctly as (acb), a notation in
which each letter is taken into the letter immediately following, the
first letter being understood to be the successor of the last letter.
Thus, the letter a was carried into c, c in turn was carried into b, and
b went into a. The notation (ac) or (ac, b), however, means that a goes
into c, c goes into a, and b goes into itself. If two permutations are
performed successively, the resulting permutation is known as the
product of the two permutation transformations. Thus, the product of
(acb) and (ac, b), written as (acb)(ac, b), is the permutation (a, bc).
The identical permutation I takes each letter into itself—that is, it
leaves the order a, b, c unchanged. The set of all permutations on the
letters a, b, c clearly satisfies the definition of a group, given in
chapter 20 on geometry; this group, containing six permutations, is
known as the symmetric group on a, b, c. In the case of n distinct
elements, x1, x2, … , xn, the symmetric group on these contains n!
transformations. If these elements are the roots of an irreducible
equation, the properties of the symmetric group provide necessary and
sufficient conditions that the equation be solvable by radicals.</p>
<p>Inspired by Abel’s proof of the insolvability by radicals of the
quintic equation, Galois discovered that an irreducible algebraic
equation is solvable by radicals if and only if its group—that is, the
symmetric group on its roots—is solvable. The description of a solvable
group is quite complicated, involving as it does relationships between
the group and its subgroups. The three permutations (abc), (abc)2, and
(abc)3 5I form a subgroup of the symmetric group on a, b, and
c. Lagrange had already shown that the order of a subgroup must be a
factor of the order of the group, but Galois went deeper and found
relations between the factorability of the group of an equation and the
solvability of the equation.</p>
<p>Moreover, to him we owe the use in 1830 of the word “group” in its
technical sense in mathematics and the concept of a normal subgroup.</p>
<p>Although his work was done before that of most of the British
algebraists of the great period 1830 1850, Galois’s ideas were without
influence until they were published in 1846. Presence in Paris did not
guarantee success to even the brightest young mathematical minds of the
day. Abel and Galois are the most illustrious examples of men who felt
frustrated by their failure to find the recognition they sought in
Paris.</p>
<p>The situation had changed by the time Liouville published Galois’s
work in his Journal. By midcentury, a substantial number of
mathematicians were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and
England. Each country had established a major mathematical journal in
the second quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the
Journal de Mathe´matiques Pures et Applique´es. The Cambridge
Mathematical Journal followed. Crelle’s journal continued to thrive,
with much active support from Dirichlet and his students.</p>
<p>Gauss and Cauchy died within two years of each other, the former in
1855, the latter in 1857. They had been preceded in death by many of
their contemporaries, including some of their younger followers; they
were followed, in 1859, by Dirichlet and Alexander von Humboldt. In this
respect, the 1850s mark the end of an era. But the decade also brought a
new direction to the continued unfolding of the mathematical legacy of
Gauss and Cauchy: that which emerged from the work of Bernhard Riemann
(1826 1866).</p>
