<h4 id="henri-poincare">Henri Poincare´</h4>
<p>When Gauss died in 1855, it was generally thought that there would
never again be a universalist in mathematics—one who is at home in all
branches, pure and applied. If anyone has since proved this view wrong,
it was Poincare, for he took all mathematics as his province. In
several´ respects, however, Poincare differed fundamentally from Gauss.
Gauss´ had been a calculating prodigy who during his life did not flinch
from involved computations, whereas Poincare was not especially early
in´ showing mathematical promise and readily admitted that he had
difficulty with simple arithmetic calculations. Poincare’s case shows
that to´ be a great mathematician, one need not excel in number
facility; there are other, more advantageous aspects of innate
mathematical ability. Also, whereas Gauss wrote relatively little,
polishing his works, Poincare´ wrote hastily and extensively, publishing
more memoirs per year than any other mathematician. Moreover, Poincare,
especially in later life,´ wrote popular books with a philosophical
flair, something that had not tempted Gauss. On the other hand,
similarities between Poincare and´ Gauss are numerous and fundamental.
Both so teemed with ideas that it was difficult for them to jot the
thoughts down on paper, both had a strong preference for general
theorems over specific cases, and both contributed to a wide variety of
branches of science.</p>
<p>Henri Poincare (1854´ 1912) was born in Nancy, a city that was to
harbor a number of leading mathematicians in the twentieth century. The
family achieved eminence in various ways; Henri’s cousin Raymond served
as president of France during World War I. Henri was clumsily
ambidextrous, and his ineptitude in physical exercise was legendary. He
had poor eyesight and was very absentminded, but, like Euler and Gauss,
he had a remarkable capacity for mental exercises in all aspects of
mathematical thought. On graduating from the E´cole Polytechnique in
1875, he took a degree in mining engineering in 1879 and became attached
to the Department of Mines for the rest of his life. Also in 1879, he
earned his doctorate under Hermite at the University of Paris; he would
hold several professorships in mathematics and science there until his
death, besides serving as a professor at the E´cole Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Automorphic Functions and Differential Equations</p>
<p>Poincare’s doctoral thesis had been on differential equations (not
on´ methods of solution, but on existence theorems), which led to one of
his most celebrated contributions to mathematics—the properties of
automorphic functions.In fact, he was the virtual founder of thetheory
of these functions. An automorphic function f(z) of the complex variable
z is one
thatisanalytic,exceptforpoles,inadomainDandthatisinvariantundera
denumerably infinite group of linear fractional transformations</p>
<p>az1b zu5: cz1d</p>
<p>Such functions are generalizations of trigonometric functions (as we
see if a515d, c50, and b is of the form 2kπ) and of elliptic functions.
Hermite had studied such transformations for the restricted case in
which the coefficients a, b, c, and d are integers for which ad2bc51 and
had discovered a class of elliptic modular functions invariant under
these. But Poincare’s generalizations disclosed a broader category of
functions,´ known as zeta-Fuchsian functions, which, Poincare showed,
could be´ used to solve the second-order linear differential equation
with algebraic coefficients.</p>
<p>This was only the beginning of many important contributions by
Poincare to the theory of differential equations. The subject runs like
a´ red thread through most of his work. In a synopsis of his own work,
he commented that analysts had faced three major problems since the
establishment of the calculus: the solution of algebraic equations, the
integration of algebraic differentials, and the integration of
differential equations. He observed that in all three cases, history had
shown that success lay not in the traditional attempts at reduction to a
simpler problem but in a head-on attack on the nature of the solution.
This had been the key to the algebraic problem provided by Galois. In
the second case, the attack on algebraic differentials, successes had
been achieved for several decades by those who no longer attempted a
reduction to elementary functions but used the new transcendental
functions. Poincare´ had been certain that a similar approach would aid
with previously intractable problems in the solution of differential
equations.</p>
<p>As noted previously, the outlook was already present in his doctoral
thesis. It hadbeen titled “On theProperties of FunctionsDefined
byPartial Differential Equations.” He tackled the main problem in a
series of papers published in the early 1880s, in which he set out to
provide a qualitative
descriptionofsolutions.Hefirstattackedthegeneralequationdx/f(x,y)5
dy/g(x, y), where f and g are real polynomials. To handle the problem of
infinite branches, he projected the xy-plane onto a sphere. He now
examined his equation,paying special attention to the points at which
both polynomials vanish. Using the classification by Briot and Bouquet,
based on Cauchy, of such singularities into nodes, saddle points, foci,
and centers, he was able to establish general properties of the
solutions that depended purely on the presence or the absence of a
specific type of singularity. For example, he established that the
traditional solution of the
typeT(x,y)5C(withTanalyticandCconstant)occursonlyifthereare no nodes or
foci. In the third of the four papers containing this theory, Poincare
extended his analysis to higher-degree equations of the form´ F(x, y,
yu)50, F being a polynomial. He approached such equations by considering
the surface defined by F(x, y, yu)50. Letting the genus of the surface
be p, the number of foci be F, of nodes N, and of saddle points S,
Poincare showed that´ N1 F2S5222P. After exploring the ramifications of
this and of other results, Poincare proceeded to the study of´
equationsofhigherorder.Thoughnotabletoestablishas comprehensivea set of
results as he had for dimension two, he generalized the new technique
using hypersurfaces and firmed up relationships between the
singularities and the Betti number of the hypersurface.</p>
<p>Among many other results in the study of differential equations, we
cite only a few. One of his earliest pertains to linear equations and
the neighborhood of an irregular singularity; here he provided a
pathbreaking example of expanding solutions into asymptotic series. In
1884, he turned to the study of first-order differential equations with
fixed singularities in the complex domain. E´mile Picard (1856 1941)
used this work in his study of second-order equations. Poincare’s work
here´ is also at the basis of Paul Painleve’s (1863´ 1933) profound
investigations of nonlinear second-order equations with or without
(movable) singularities. Poincare’s subsequent work in ordinary and
partial dif-´ ferential equations related mostly to physical
applications, especially in celestial mechanics and the n-body
problem.</p>
<p>Mathematical Physics And Other Applications</p>
<p>Poincare did not stay in any field long enough to round out his work.
A´ contemporary said of him, “He was a conqueror, not a colonist.” In
his teaching at the Sorbonne, he would lecture on a different topic each
school year—capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, optics,
electricity, telegraphy, cosmogony, and others; the presentation was
such that in many cases, the lectures appeared in print shortly after
they had been delivered. In astronomy alone, he published half a dozen
volumes—Les methodes´ nouvelles de la mecanique celeste´ (3 vols., 1892
1899) and Lec¸ons de mecanique c´ eleste´ (3 vols., 1905 1910)—being in
this respect a worthy successor of Laplace. Especially important were
the methods he used to attack the three-body problem and its
generalizations. Also significant for cosmogony was a memoir of 1885, in
which he showed that a pear shape can be a figure of relative
equilibrium assumed by a homogeneous fluid subject to Newtonian
gravitation and rotating uniformly about an axis; the question of a
pear-shaped earth has continued to interest geodesists to our day. Sir
George H. Darwin (1845 1912), the son of Charles Darwin (1809 1882),
wrote in 1909 that Poincare’s celestial mechanics would be´ a vast mine
for researchers for half a century; a century later, the mine has not
been exhausted.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Poincare, like Laplace, also wrote extensively
on´ probability. In some respects, his work is only a natural
continuation of that of Laplace and the analysts of the nineteenth
century, but Poincare was´ Janus-faced and to some extent anticipated
the great interest in topology that was to be so characteristic of the
twentieth century. Topology was not the invention of any one man. Some
topological problems are found in the work of Euler, Mo¨bius, and
Cantor, and even the word “topology” had been used in 1847 by J. B.
Listing (1808 1882) in the title of a book, Vorstudien zur Topologie
(Introductory Studies in Topology). But as a date for the beginning of
the subject, none is more appropriate than 1895, the year in which
Poincare published its first systematic development in his´ Analysis
situs.</p>
<p>Topology</p>
<p>Topology is now a broad and fundamental branch of mathematics, with
many aspects, but it can be subdivided into two fairly distinct
subbranches: combinatorial topology and point-set topology. Poincare
had´ little enthusiasm for the latter, and when, in 1908, he addressed
the International Mathematical Congress at Rome, he referred to Cantor’s
Mengenlehre as a disease from which later generations would regard
themselves as having recovered. Combinatorial topology, or analysis
situs, as it was then generally called, is the study of intrinsic
qualitative aspects of spatial configurations that remain invariant
under continuous one-to-one transformations. It is often referred to
popularly as “rubber-sheet geometry,” for deformations of, say, a
balloon, without puncturing or tearing it, are instances of topological
transformations. A circle, for example, is topologically equivalent to
an ellipse; the dimensionality of a space is a topological invariant, as
is also the Descartes-Euler number N0 2N1 1N2 for simple polyhedra.
Among Poincare’s original contributions to topology was a generalization
of´ the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula for spaces of higher
dimensionality, making use of what he called “Betti numbers,” in honor
of Enrico Betti (1823 1892), who had taught at the University of Pisa
and had noted some of the properties of these topological invariants.
Most of topology, nevertheless, deals with qualitative, rather than
quantitative, aspects of mathematics, and, in this respect, it typifies
a sharp break from the styles prevailing in nineteenth-century analysis.
Poincare’s attention´ seems to have been directed toward analysis situs
by attempts at qualitative integrations of differential equations.
Poincare, like Riemann, was´ especially adept at handling problems of a
topological nature, such as finding out the properties of a function
without worrying about its formal representation in the classical sense;
both men were intuitionists with sound judgment.</p>
<p>Poincare stated that practically every problem he touched led him to´
analysis situs. We have seen an example in his attack on differential
equations. In the decade that overlapped the end of the nineteenth
century and the beginning of the twentieth, he published a series of
papers on the subject. These became the basis of twentieth-century
combinatorial, or algebraic, topology. Here he elaborated on the
concepts derived from Riemann and Betti that we encountered in his work
on differential equations: treating a figure as an n-dimensional
manifold and considering the order of connectedness. He set forth the
fundamental definitions and theorems of simplicial homology theory; he
established the relationship between the fundamental group of a manifold
and the first Betti number; he also pointed to further relationships
involving the Betti numbers. These papers contained theorems and
conjectures that led to many of the subsequent explorations of
twentieth-century topologists. We shall outline the story of one of
these in our last chapter.</p>
<p>Other Fields and Legacy</p>
<p>Of Poincare’s many other contributions to mathematics, we only men-´
tion additional work in function theory, including Abelian functions;
substantive work on Lie groups and related problems in algebra; and
influential nontechnical writings—some polemical—on mathematics and the
philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p>As an instance of Poincare’s many-sidedness, it is to him that we
owe´ a suggestive model of Lobachevskian geometry within a Euclidean
framework. Suppose that a world is bounded by a large sphere of radius R
and the absolute temperature at a point within the sphere is R22 r2,
where r is the distance from the center of the sphere; also suppose that
the index of refraction of the pellucid medium is inversely proportional
to R22 r2. Moreover, assume that the dimensions of objects change from
point to point, being proportional to the temperature at any given
place. To inhabitants of such a world, the universe would appear to be
infinite, and rays of light, or “straight lines,” would not be
rectilinear but would be circles orthogonal to the limiting sphere and
would appear to be infinite. “Planes” would be spheres orthogonal to the
limiting sphere, and two such non-Euclidean “planes” would intersect in
a non-Euclidean “line.” The axioms of Euclid would hold, with the
exception of the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>In addition to his universality, the powerful new tools he developed,
and the results he obtained, Poincare’s importance for the twentieth´
century lies in the “unfinished” but very open nature of many of his
memoirs. An example is a famous paper he wrote on number theory.
Published in 1901, this dealt with the study of diophantine equations.
In the direction established twenty years earlier by Dedekind and Weber,
this subject was now approached through the birational theory of
algebraic curves. In other words, given a curve f(x, y)50 with rational
coefficients, one wishes to find points with rational coordinates lying
on the curve. Poincare again examined the genus of the curve,
especially´ for the case p51. Utilizing a technique made popular by
Clebsch, he used elliptic functions for a parametric representation of
the curve and noted that the rational points on the Jacobian form a
subgroup; its rank is what he called the rank of the curve. This paper
has led to several important studies. A 1917 paper by Alexander Hurwitz
(1859 1919) was followed by one from Louis Joel Mordell (1888 1972) in
1922 in which he proved that the rank of the subgroup is finite. In
1928, Andre´ Weil (1906 1998) extended this result to arbitrary
p. Echoing Fermat, Mordell and Weil used a “method of infinite descent”
based on the bisection of the elliptic functions, which Poincare may
have suggested in´ related trisections. The subsequent history of the
Mordell conjecture and other expansions of these ideas belong to
contemporary mathematics; we note the 1901 paper simply as an example of
the tremendously suggestive nature of Poincare’s publications.´</p>
<p>On the day Poincare died, Paul Painlev´ e issued a brief tribute. He
ended´ it by stressing Poincare’s intellectual sincerity. In particular,
he linked to´
thisqualityPoincare’swillingnesstoissuepartialresultswhenhefeltthere´
was no time or little chance that he could bring a problem to a complete
solution.Asanexample,PainlevequotedfromPoincar´ e’slastpublication,´ in
which Poincare had justified his presenting partial results. After
noting´</p>
<p>that there seemed little chance he might take up the problem again in
the future, Poincare had written:´</p>
<p>The importance of the subject is too great and the collection of
results obtained too considerable already for me to resign myself to
leave them definitely barren. I can hope that geometers who will
interest themselves in this problem, and who will be undoubtedly more
fortunate than I, can turn this to good use and have it serve them to
find the direction they must take.</p>
