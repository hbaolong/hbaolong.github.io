<h4 id="thirteenth-century-mathematics">Thirteenth-Century
Mathematics</h4>
<p>The later Sung period may be regarded as a high plateau of medieval
mathematics in China. During this period, which coincides with the time
of Mongol expansion and increased interaction with Islam, numerous
mathematicians combined traditional teachings of arithmetic and
measurement with new approaches to the solution of equations of higher
degree, both determinate and indeterminate.</p>
<p>At that time, there were mathematicians working in various parts of
China, but relations between them seem to have been remote, and, as in
the case of Greek mathematics, we evidently have relatively few of the
treatises that once were available.</p>
<p>One of the mathematicians of the period was Li Zhi (1192 1279), a
mathematician of Peking who spent a long and interesting life as an
occasional administrator, hermit, scholar, and academician. He was</p>
<p>T hir t e ent h C entur y Mat he mat ic s</p>
<p>offered a post as a royal annalist by Kublai Khan in 1260 but
politely found an excuse to decline it. His Ceyuan Haijing (Ts’e-yuan
hai-ching) (Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements) includes 170 problems
dealing with circles inscribed within, or circumscribed without, a right
triangle and with determining the relationships between the sides and
the radii, and some of the problems lead to equations of the fourth
degree. Although he did not describe his method of solving equations,
including some of the sixth degree, it appears that it was not very
different from that used by Zhu Shijie (Chu Shih-chieh) (fl. 1280 1303)
and Horner. Others who used the Horner method were Qin Jiushao (Ch’in
Chiu-shao) (ca. 1202 ca. 1261) and Yang Hui (fl. ca. 1261 1275). The
former was an unprincipled governor and minister who acquired immense
wealth within a hundred days of assuming office. His Shushu jiuzhang
(Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections) marks the high point in Chinese
indeterminate analysis, with the invention of routines for solving
simultaneous congruences. In this work, he also found the square root of
71,824 by steps paralleling those in the Horner method. With 200 as the
first approximation to a root of x2 271,82450, he diminished the roots
of this by 200 to obtain y2 1400y231,82450. For the latter equation, he
found 60 as an approximation and diminished the roots by 60, arriving at
a third equation, z2 1520z24,22450, of which 8 is a root. Hence, the
value of x is 268. In a similar way, he solved cubic and quartic
equations.</p>
<p>The same “Horner” device was used by Yang Hui, about whose life
almost nothing is known. He was a prolific arithmetician; among his
contributions that are extant are the earliest Chinese magic squares of
order greater than three, including two each of orders four through
eight and one each of orders nine and ten.</p>
<p>Yang Hui’s works also included results in the summation of series and
the so-called Pascal triangle, things that were published and better
known through the Precious Mirror (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of
Zhu Shijie, with which the Golden Age of Chinese mathematics closed.</p>
<p>Zhu Shijie was the last and greatest of the Sung mathematicians, yet
we know little about him—not even when he was born or when he died. He
was a resident of Yanshan, near modern Peking, but he seems to have
spent some twenty years as a wandering scholar who earned his living by
teaching mathematics, even though he had the opportunity to write two
treatises. The first of these, written in 1299, was the Suanxue qimeng
(Suan-hsueh ch’i-meng) (Introduction to Mathematical Studies), a
relatively elementary work that strongly influenced Korea and Japan,
although in China it was lost until it reappeared in the nineteenth
century. Of greater historical and mathematical interest is the Siyuan
yujian (Ssu-yuan yu-chien) (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of 1303. In
the eighteenth century, this, too, disappeared in China, only to be
rediscovered in the next century. The four origins, called heaven,
earth, man, and matter, are the representations of four unknown
quantities in the same equation.</p>
<p>The book marks the peak in the development of Chinese algebra, for it
deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high
as fourteen. In it, the author describes a transformation method that he
calls fan fa, the elements of which seem to have arisen much earlier
than this in China, but which generally bears the name of Horner, who
lived half a millennium later. In solving the equation x2 1252x25,29250,
for example, Zhu Shijie first obtained x519 as an approximation (a root
lies between x519 and x520) and then used the fan fa, in this case the
transformation y5x219, to obtain the equation y2 1290y214350 (with a
root between y50 and y51). He then gave the root of the latter as
(approximately) y5143/(11290); hence, the corresponding value of x is
19. For the equation x3 257450, he used y5x28 to obtain y3 124y2
1192y26250, and he gave the root as x58162/</p>
<ol start="11241192" type="1">
<li>or x58. In some cases, he found decimal approximations.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few of the many summations of series found in the Jade Mirror are
the following:</p>
<p>2n11</p>
<p>12 122 132 1?1n2 5nðn11ÞðÞ</p>
<p>3!</p>
<p>1181301801?1n2ðn11Þð Þ n12</p>
<p>3!</p>
<p>4n11</p>
<p>5nðn11Þðn12Þðn13Þ3ðÞ:</p>
<p>5!</p>
<p>No proofs are given, however, nor does the topic seem to have been
continued again in China until about the nineteenth century. Zhu Shijie
handled his summations through the method of finite differences, some
elements of which seem to date in China from the seventh century, but
shortly after his work, the method disappeared for many centuries.</p>
<p>The Jade Mirror opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle,
inappropriately known in the West as “Pascal’s triangle.” (See the
following illustration.) In Zhu’s arrangement, we have the coefficients
of binomial expansions through the eighth power, clearly given in rod
numerals and a round zero symbol. Zhu disclaims credit for the triangle,
referring to it as a “diagram of the old method for finding eighth and
lower powers.” A similar arrangement of coefficients through the sixth
power had appeared in the work of Yang Hui, but without the round zero
symbol. There are references in Chinese works of about 1100 to
tabulation systems for binomial coefficients, and it is likely that the
arithmetic triangle originated in China by about that date. It is
interesting to note that the Chinese discovery of the binomial theorem
for integral powers was associated in its origin with root extractions,
rather than with powers. The equivalent of the theorem apparently was
known to Omar Khayyam at about the time that it was being used in China,
but the earliest extant</p>
<p>T hir t e ent h C entur y Mat he mat ic s</p>
<p>The “Pascal” triangle, as depicted in 1303 at the front of Zhu</p>
<p>Shijie’s Jade Mirror. It is titled “The Old Method Chart of the Seven
Multiplying Squares” and tabulates the binomial coeffi cients up to the
eighth power. (Reproduced from J. Needham</p>
<p>1959, Vol. 3, p. 135.)</p>
<p>Arabic work containing it is by al-Kashi in the fifteenth century. By
that time, Chinese mathematics had declined. Emphasis was placed once
again on the tradition of the Nine Chapters and the requirements of
commercial arithmetic. The impressive theoretical achievements, cloaked
in symbolic language that lent them an aura of mystery, would be revived
only after the more intense interaction with Western European
scholarship of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
