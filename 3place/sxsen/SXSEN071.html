<h4 id="eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</h4>
<p>When Archimedes sent his Method to Eratosthenes in Alexandria, he
chose as recipient a man who represented the many diverse areas of study
at the Alexandrian library. Eratosthenes (ca. 275 194 BCE) was a native
of Cyrene who had spent much of his early life in Athens. He had
achieved prominence in many fields—poetry, astronomy, history,
mathematics, athletics—when, in middle life, he was called by Ptolemy
III to Alexandria to tutor his son and to serve as head of the library
there.</p>
<p>Today, Eratosthenes is best remembered for his measurement of the
earth—not the first or last such estimate made in antiquity, but by all
odds the most successful. Eratosthenes observed that at noon on the
day</p>
<p>of the summer solstice, the sun shone directly down a deep well at
Syene. At the same time in Alexandria, taken to be on the same meridian
and 5,000 stades north of Syene, the sun was found to cast a shadow
indicating that the sun’s angular distance from the zenith was
one-fiftieth of a circle. From the equality of the corresponding angles
SuAZ and SvOZ in Fig. 8.1, it is clear that the circumference of the
earth must be fifty times the distance between Syene and Alexandria.
This results in a perimeter of 250,000 stades. How accurate this
measurement was has been a subject of debate among scholars, partly
because there are differing accounts concerning the length of a stadium.
There is consensus, however, that the result of the measurement was a
remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>A contributor to many fields of learning, Eratosthenes is well known
in mathematics for the “sieve of Eratosthenes,” a systematic procedure
for isolating the prime numbers. With all of the natural numbers
arranged in order, one simply strikes out every second number following
the number 2, every third number (in the original sequence) following
the number 3, every fifth number following the number 5, and continues
in this manner to strike out every nth number following the number
n. The remaining numbers, from 2 on, will, of course, be primes.
Eratosthenes also wrote works on means and on loci, but these have been
lost. Even his treatise On the Measurement of the Earth is no longer
extant, although some details from it have been preserved by others,
including Heron and Ptolemy of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Angles and Chords</p>
<p>Like Eratosthenes, in his work on mathematical geography, a number of
astronomers of the Alexandrian Age handled problems that pointed to a
need for systematic relationships between angles and chords.
Theorems</p>
<p>A ngle s and C hor d s</p>
<p>on the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern
law of sines.</p>
<p>Aristarchus</p>
<p>Among Eratosthenes’ predecessors was Aristarchus of Samos (ca. 310
ca. 230 BCE), who, according to Archimedes and Plutarch, proposed a
heliocentric system; but whatever he may have written on this scheme has
been lost. Instead, we have an Aristarchan treatise, perhaps composed
earlier (ca. 260 BCE), On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon,
which assumes a geocentric universe. In this work, Aristarchus made the
observation that when the moon is just half-full, the angle between the
lines of sight to the sun and the moon is less than a right angle by
one-thirtieth of a quadrant. (The systematic introduction of the 360
circle came a little later.) In trigonometric language of today, this
would mean that the ratio of the distance of the moon to that of the sun
(the ratio ME to SE in Fig. 8.2) is sin 3. Trigonometric tables not
having been developed yet, Aristarchus fell back on a well-known
geometric theorem of the time that now would be expressed in the
inequalities sinα/sinβ, α, β, tanα/tanβ, where 0, β, α, 90. From these,
he derived the conclusion that ,sin3,; hence, he asserted that the sun
is more than 18, but less than 20, times as far from the earth as is the
moon. This is far from the modern value—somewhat less than 400—but it is
better than the values 9 and 12 that Archimedes ascribed, respectively,
to Eudoxus and to Phidias (Archimedes’ father). Moreover, the method
used by Aristarchus was unimpeachable, the result being vitiated only by
the error of observation in measuring the angle MES as 87 (when in
actuality it should have been about 89 50u).</p>
<p>Having determined the relative distances of the sun and the moon,
Aristarchus also knew that the sizes of the sun and the moon were in the
same ratio. This follows from the fact that the sun and the moon have
very nearly the same apparent size—that is, they subtend about the same
angle at the eye of an observer on the earth. In the treatise in
question, this angle is given as 2, but Archimedes attributed to
Aristarchus the much better value of . From this ratio, Aristarchus was
able</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>FIG. 8.2</p>
<p>to find an approximation for the sizes of the sun and the moon, as
compared with the size of the earth. From lunar eclipse observations, he
concluded that the breadth of the shadow cast by the earth at the
distance of the moon was twice the width of the moon. Then, if Rs, Re,
and Rm are the radii of the sun, the earth, and the moon, respectively,
and if Ds and Dm are the distances of the sun and the moon from the
earth, then, from the similarity of triangles BCD and ABE (Fig. 8.3),
one has the proportion (Re 22Rm)/(Rs 2Re)5Dm /Ds. If in this equation
one replaces Ds and Rs with the approximate values 19Dm and 19Rm, one
obtains the equation ðRe 22RmÞ=ð19Rm 2ReÞ5 or Rm 52057Re. Here the
actual computations of Aristarchus have been considerably simplified.
His reasoning was in reality much more carefully carried out and led to
the conclusion that</p>
<p>108 Re 60 19 Rs 43</p>
<p>, , and , , : 43 Rm 19 3 Re 6</p>
<p>Hipparchus of Nicaea</p>
<p>For some two and a half centuries, from Hippocrates to Eratosthenes,
Greek mathematicians had studied relationships between lines and circles
and had applied these in a variety of astronomical problems, but no
systematic trigonometry had resulted. Then, presumably during the second
half of the second century, the first trigonometric table apparently was
compiled by the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 180 ca. 125 BCE).
Aristarchus had known that in a given circle, the ratio of arc to chord
decreasedastheangledecreasesfrom180 to0,tendingtowardalimitof1. Yet it
appears that not until Hipparchus undertook the task had anyone
tabulated corresponding values of arc and chord for a whole series of
angles. It has, however, been suggested that Apollonius may have
anticipated Hipparchus in this respect, and that the contribution of the
latter to trigonometry was simply the calculation of a better set of
chords than had been drawn up by his predecessors. Hipparchus evidently
drew up his tables for use in his astronomy. He was a transitional</p>
<p>A ngle s and C hor d s</p>
<p>figure between Babylonian astronomy and the work of Ptolemy. The
chief contributions attributed to Hipparchus in astronomy were his
organization of the empirical data derived from the Babylonians, the
drawing up of a star catalogue, improvement in important astronomical
constants (such as the length of the month and the year, the size of the
moon, and the angle of obliquity of the ecliptic), and, finally, the
discovery of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>It is not known just when the systematic use of the 360 circle came
into mathematics, but it seems to be due largely to Hipparchus in
connection with his table of chords. It is possible that he took over
from Hypsicles, who earlier had divided the order into 360 parts, a
subdivision that may have been suggested by Babylonian astronomy. Just
how Hipparchus made up his table is not known, for his works are not
extant (except for a commentary on a popular astronomical poem by
Aratus). It is likely that his methods were similar to those of Ptolemy,
to be described further on, for Theon of Alexandria, commenting on
Ptolemy’s table of chords in the fourth century, reported that
Hipparchus had earlier written a treatise in twelve books on chords in a
circle.</p>
<p>Menelaus of Alexandria</p>
<p>Theon also mentions another treatise, in six books, by Menelaus of
Alexandria (ca. 100 CE) dealing with Chords in a Circle. Other
mathematical and astronomical works by Menelaus are mentioned by later
Greek and Arabic commentators, including an Elements of Geometry, but
the only one that has survived—and only through the Arabic translation—
is his Sphaerica. In Book I of this treatise, Menelausestablished a
basis for spherical triangles analogous to that of Euclid I for plane
triangles. Included is a theorem without Euclidean analogue—that two
spherical triangles are congruent if corresponding angles are equal
(Menelaus did notdistinguishbetweencongruentandsymmetricspherical
triangles),and the theorem A1B1C.180 is established. The second book of
the</p>
<p>Sphaerica describes the application of spherical geometry to
astronomical phenomena and is of little mathematical interest. Book III,
the last, contains the well-known “theorem of Menelaus” as part of what
is essentially spherical trigonometry in the typical Greek form—a
geometry or
trigonometryofchordsinacircle.InthecircleinFig.8.4,weshouldwritethatchord
ABistwicethesineofhalfofthecentralangleAOB(multipliedbytheradius of the
circle). Menelaus and his Greek successors instead referred to AB
simplyasthechordcorrespondingtothearc AB.IfBOBu isadiameterofthe circle,
then chord ABu is twice the cosine of half the angle AOB (multiplied by
the radius of the circle). Hence, the theorems of Thales and Pythagoras,
which lead to the equation AB2 1ABu2 24r2, are equivalent to the modern
trigonometric identity sin2 θ1cos2 θ51. Menelaus, as Hipparchus
probably</p>
<p>also before him, was familiar with other identities, two of which he
used as lemmas in proving his theorem on transversals. The first of
these lemmas

sinAD=sinDB.Thesecondlemma issimilar: If thechordAB extendediscut_ _ in
point Cu by a radius ODu extended, then ACu=BCu 5sinADu=sinBDu. These
lemmas were assumed by Menelaus without proof, presumably
becausetheycouldbefoundinearlierworks,possiblyinHipparchus’stwelve books
on chords. (The reader can easily prove the lemmas by drawing AO and BO,
dropping perpendiculars from A and B to OD, and using similar
triangles.)</p>
<p>It is probable that the “theorem of Menelaus” for the case of plane
triangles had been known to Euclid, perhaps having appeared in the lost
Porisms. The theorem in the plane states that if the sides AB, BC, CA of
a triangle are cut by a transversal in points D, E, F, respectively
(Fig. 8.6),</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>FIG. 8.6</p>
<p>then ADBECF5BDCEAF. In other words, any line cuts the sides of a
triangle so that the product of three nonadjacent segments equals the
product of the other three, as can readily be proved by elementary
geometry or through the application of simple trigonometric
relationships. The theorem was assumed by Menelaus to be well known to
his contemporaries, but he went on to extend it to spherical triangles
in a form equivalent to sinAD sinBE sinCF5sinBD sinCE sinAF. If sensed
segments are used, rather than absolute magnitudes, the two products are
equal in magnitude but differ in sign.</p>
