<h4 id="al-kashi">Al-Kashi</h4>
<p>The mathematics of Islam continued to decline after al-Tusi, but our
account of the Muslim contribution would not be adequate without
reference to the work of a figure in the early fifteenth century.
Jamshid al-Kashi (ca. 1380 1429) found a patron in the prince Ulugh Beg,
who was a grandson of the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane. In Samarkand,
where he held his court, Ulugh Beg had built an observatory and
established a center of learning, and al-Kashi joined the group of
scientists gathered there. In numerous works, written in Persian and
Arabic, alKashi contributed to mathematics and astronomy. He also
produced a major textbook for the use of students in Samarkand, which
provided an introduction to arithmetic, algebra, and their applications
to architecture, surveying, commerce, and other interest areas. His
computational skills appear to have been unequalled. Noteworthy is the
accuracy of his computations, especially in connection with the solution
of equations by a special case of Horner’s method, derived perhaps from
the Chinese. From China, too, al-Kashi may have taken the practice of
using decimal fractions. Al-Kashi is an important figure in the history
of decimal fractions, and he realized the significance of his
contribution in this respect, regarding himself as the inventor of
decimal fractions. Although to some extent he had had precursors, he was
perhaps the first user of sexagesimal fractions to suggest that decimals
are just as convenient for problems requiring many-place accuracy.
Nevertheless, in his systematic computations of roots, he continued to
make use of sexagesimals. In illustrating his method for finding the nth
root of a number, he took the sixth root of the sexagesimal</p>
<p>34,59,1,7,14,54,23,3,47,37;40.</p>
<p>This was a prodigious feat of computation, using the steps that we
follow in Horner’s method—locating the root, diminishing the roots, and
stretching or multiplying the roots—and using a pattern similar to our
synthetic division.</p>
<p>Al-Kashi evidently delighted in long calculations, and he was
justifiably proud of his approximation of π, which was more accurate
than any of the values given by his predecessors. He expressed his value
of 2π in both
sexagesimalanddecimalforms.Theformer—6;16,59,28,34,51,46,15,50— is more
reminiscent of the past, and the latter, 6.2831853071795865, in a sense
presaged the future use of decimal fractions. No mathematician
approached the accuracy in this tour de force of computation until the
late sixteenth century. His computational skills appear to have been at
the basis of the table of sines produced at the Samarkand observatory.
In alKashi, the binomial theorem in “Pascal triangle” form again
appears, just about a century after its publication in China and about a
century before it was printed in European books.</p>
<p>The number of significant Islamic contributors to mathematics before
al-Kashi was considerably larger than our exposition would suggest, for
we have concentrated only on major figures, but after al-Kashi the
number is negligible. It was very fortunate indeed that when Arabic
learning began to decline, scholarship in Europe was on the upgrade and
was prepared to accept the intellectual legacy bequeathed by earlier
ages.</p>

<p>Neglect of mathematics works injury to all knowledge, since he who is
ignorant of it cannot know the other sciences or the things of this
world.</p>
