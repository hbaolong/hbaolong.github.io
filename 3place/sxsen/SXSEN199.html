<h4 id="monge">Monge</h4>
<p>Gaspard Monge (1746 1818) was the son of a poor tradesman. Through
the influence of a lieutenant colonel who had been struck by the boy’s
ability, however, Monge was permitted to attend some courses at the
E´cole Militaire de Mezie`res; he so impressed those in authority that
he soon became a member of the teaching staff—the only one of our group
of six who was primarily a teacher, perhaps one of the most influential
mathematics teachers since the days of Euclid.</p>
<p>Monge contributed numerous mathematical articles to the Memoires of´
the Academie des Sciences´ . Inasmuch as he succeeded Bezout as´
examiner for the School of the Navy, Monge was more urged by those in
authority to do what Bezout had done—write a´ Cours de mathematiques´
for the use of candidates. Monge, however, was more interested in
teaching and research, and he completed only one volume of the project:
Traite´ elementaire de statique (Paris, 1788). He was attracted not only
to both pure and applied mathematics but also to physics and chemistry.
In particular, he participated with Lavoisier in experiments, including
those on the composition of water, which led to the chemical revolution
of 1789. At the time of the revolution, Monge had become one of the best
known of French scientists, but his geometry had not been properly
appreciated. His chief work, the Geom´ etrie descriptive´ , had not been
published because his superiors felt that it was in the interests of
national defense to keep it confidential.</p>
<p>Monge made efforts after the crisis of foreign invasion had subsided
to establish a school for the preparation of engineers. As Condorcet had
been the guiding spirit in the Committee on Instruction, so Monge was
the leading advocate of institutions of higher learning. He was an
active member of the Commission of Public Works, charged with the
establishment of an appropriate institution in 1794. The school was the
famous E´cole Polytechnique, which took form so rapidly that students
were admitted in the following year. At all stages of its creation,
Monge’s role was essential, both as administrator and as teacher. It is
gratifying to note that the two functions are not incompatible, for
Monge was eminently successful in both. He was even able to overcome his
reluctance about writing textbooks, for in the reform of the mathematics
curriculum, the need for suitable books was acute.</p>
<p>Descriptive and Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge found himself lecturing on two subjects that were both
essentially new to a university curriculum. The first of these was known
as stereotomy, now more commonly called descriptive geometry. Monge gave
a concentrated course in the subject to 400 students, and a manuscript
outline of the syllabus survives. This shows that the course was of
wider scope, both on the pure and the applied side, than is now usual.
Besides the study of shadow, perspective, and topography, attention was
paid to the properties of surfaces, including normal lines and tangent
planes, and to the theory of machines. Among the problems set by Monge,
for example, was that of determining the curve of intersection of two
surfaces, each of which is generated by a line that moves so as to
intersect three skew lines in space. Another was the determination of a
point in space equidistant from four lines.</p>
<p>Such problems point up a change in mathematical education that was
sponsored primarily by the French Revolution. As long ago as the Golden
Age of Greece, Plato had pointed out that the state of solid geometry
was deplorable, and the medieval decline in mathematics had hit solid
geometry harder than it had plane geometry. One who could not cross the
pons asinorum could scarcely be expected to reach the study of three
dimensions. Descartes and Fermat had been well aware of the fundamental
principle of solid analytic geometry that every equation in three
unknowns represents a surface, and conversely, but they had not taken
steps to develop it. Whereas the seventeenth century was the century of
curves—the cycloid; the limac¸on; the catenary; the lemniscate; the
equiangular spiral; the hyperbolas, parabolas, and spirals of Fermat;
the pearls of Sluse; and many others—the eighteenth was the century that
really began the study of surfaces. It was Euler who called attention to
the quadric surfaces as a family analogous to the conics, and his
Introductio, in a sense, established the subject of solid analytic
geometry (although Clairaut was a precursor). Lagrange, perhaps
influenced by his calculus of variations, manifested interest in
problems in three dimensions and emphasized their analytic solution. He
was the first, for example, to give the formula</p>
<p>ap1bq1cr 2 d</p>
<p>D5 p 2 2</p>
<p>a 1b 1c2</p>
<p>for the distance D from a point (p, q, r) to the plane ax1by1cz5d.
But Lagrange did not have a geometer’s heart, nor did he have
enthusiastic disciples. Monge, by contrast, was a specialist in geometry
as well as a superior teacher and a curriculum builder. Consequently,
the rise of solid geometry was due in part to the mathematical and
revolutionary activities of Gaspard Monge. Had he not been politically
active, the E´cole Polytechnique might never have come into being; had
he not been an inspiring teacher, the revival of geometry in three
dimensions might not have taken place.</p>
<p>The E´cole Polytechnique was not the only school created at the time.
The E´cole Normale had been hastily opened to some 1,400 or 1,500
students, less carefully selected than those at the E´cole
Polytechnique, and it boasted a mathematical faculty of high caliber,
Monge, Lagrange, Legendre, and Laplace being among the instructors. Due
to administrative difficulties, however the school was short-lived. It
was the lectures of Monge at the E´cole Normale in 1794 1795 that were
finally published as his Geom´ etrie descriptive´ .</p>
<p>The idea behind the new descriptive geometry, or method of double
orthographic projection, is essentially very easy to understand. One
simply takes two planes at right angles to each other, one vertical, the
other horizontal, and then projects the figure to be represented
orthogonally on these planes, the projections of all edges and vertices
being clearly indicated. The projection on the vertical plane is known
as the “elevation,” the other projection is called the “plan.” Finally,
the vertical plane is folded or rotated about the line of intersection
of the two planes until it also is horizontal. The elevation and the
plan thus provide one with a diagram in two dimensions of the
three-dimensional object. This simple procedure, now so common in
mechanical drawing, almost produced a revolution in military engineering
design in the days of Monge.</p>
<p>Descriptive geometry was not Monge’s only contribution to
threedimensional mathematics, for at the E´cole Polytechnique he also
taught a course in “application of analysis to geometry.” Just as the
abbreviated title “analytic geometry” had not yet come into general use,
there was also no “differential geometry,” but the course given by Monge
was essentially an introduction to this field. Here, too, no textbook
was available, so Monge found himself compelled to compose and print his
Feuilles d’analyse (1795) for the use of students. Here the analytic
geometry of three dimensions really came into its own; it was this
course, required of all students at the E´cole Polytechnique, that
formed the prototype of the present program in solid analytic geometry.
Students, however, evidently found the course difficult, for the
lectures skimmed very rapidly over the elementary forms of the line and
the plane, the bulk of the material being on the applications of the
calculus to the study of curves and surfaces in three dimensions. Monge
was ever reluctant to write textbooks on the elementary level or to
organize material that was not primarily his own. Yet he found
collaborators who were ready to edit material that he included in his
course, and so, in 1802, there appeared in the Journal de l’E´cole
Polytechnique an extensive memoir by Monge and Jean-Nicolas-Pierre
Hachette (1769 1834) on “Application d’alge<code>bre a</code> la geom´
etrie.” Its first theorem is typical of a more´ elementary approach to
the subject. It is the well-known eighteenthcentury generalization of
the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the projections of a
plane figure on three mutually perpendicular planes is equal to the
square of the area of the figure. Monge and Hachette proved the theorem
just as in modern courses; in fact, the whole volume could serve without
difficulty as a text in the twenty-first century. Equations for
transformations of axes, the usual treatment of lines and planes, and
the determination of the principal planes of a quadric are treated
fully. It is in the analytic geometry of Monge that we first find a
systematic study of the straight line in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Most of Monge’s results on the analytic geometry of the line and the
plane were given in memoirs dating from 1771. In his systematic
arrangement of the material in the Feuilles d’analyse of 1795 and
especially in the 1802 memoir with Hachette, we find most of the solid
analytic geometry and the elementary differential geometry that are
included in undergraduate college textbooks. One thing that might be
missed is the explicit use of determinants, for this was the work of the
nineteenth century. Nevertheless, we might, as in the case of Lagrange,
look on Monge’s use of symmetric notations as an anticipation of
determinants but without the now customary arrangement (due to Arthur
Cayley).</p>
<p>Among the new results given by Monge are two theorems that bear his
name: (1) The planes drawn through the midpoints of the edges of a
tetrahedron perpendicular to the opposite edges meet at a point M (which
has since been called the “Monge point” of the tetrahedron); M turns out
to be the midpoint of the segment joining the centroid and the
circumcenter. (2) The locus of the vertices of the trirectangular angle
whose faces are tangent to a given quadric surface is a sphere, known as
the “Monge sphere,” or director sphere, of the quadric. The equivalent
of this locus in two dimensions leads to what is called the “Monge
circle” of a conic, even though the locus had been given a century
earlier in synthetic form by Lahire. In 1809, Monge proved in various
ways that the centroid of a tetrahedron is the point of concurrency of
the lines joining the midpoints of opposite edges; he also gave the
analogue of the Euler line in three-space, showing that for the
orthocentric tetrahedron, the centroid is twice as far from the
orthocenter as from the circumcenter. Lagrange was so impressed by the
work of Monge that he is said to have exclaimed, “With his application
of analysis to geometry, this devil of a man will make himself
immortal.”</p>
