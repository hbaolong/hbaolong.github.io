<h4 id="arabic-conquests">Arabic Conquests</h4>
<p>One of the most transformative developments affecting mathematics in
the Middle Ages was the remarkable spread of Islam. Within one century
from 622 CE, the year of the prophet Mohammed’s Hegira, Islam had
expanded from Arabia to Persia, to North Africa, and to Spain.</p>
<p>At the time that Brahmagupta was writing, the Sabean Empire of Arabia
Felix had fallen, and the peninsula was in a severe crisis. It was
inhabited largely by desert nomads, known as Bedouins, who could neither
read nor write. Among them was the prophet Mohammed, born in Mecca in
about 570. During his journeys, Mohammed came in contact with Jews and
Christians, and the amalgam of religious feelings that were raised in
his mind led to the belief that he was the apostle of God sent to lead
his people. For some ten years, he preached at Mecca but in 622,</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>faced by a plot on his life, he accepted an invitation to Medina.
This “flight,” known as the Hegira, marked the beginning of the
Mohammedan era—one that was to exert a strong influence on the
development of mathematics. Mohammed now became a military, as well as a
religious, leader. Ten years later, he had established a Mohammedan
state, with its center at Mecca, within which Jews and Christians, being
also monotheistic, were afforded protection and freedom of worship. In
632, while planning to move against the Byzantine Empire, Mohammed died
in Medina. His sudden death in no way impeded the expansion of the
Islamic state, for his followers overran neighboring territories with
astonishing rapidity. Within a few years, Damascus and Jerusalem and
much of the Mesopotamian Valley fell to the conquerors; by 641,
Alexandria, which for many years had been the mathematical center of the
world, was captured. As happens so often in these conquests, the books
in the library were burned. The extent of the damage done at that time
is unclear; it has been assumed that following depredations by earlier
military and religious fanatics and long ages of sheer neglect, there
may have been relatively few books left to fuel the flames in the
library that had once been the greatest in the world.</p>
<p>For more than a century, the Arab conquerors fought among themselves
and with their enemies, until by about 750 the warlike spirit subsided.
By this time, a schism had arisen between the western Arabs in Morocco
and the eastern Arabs, who, under the caliph al-Mansur, had established
a new capital at Baghdad, a city that was shortly to become the new
center for mathematics. Yet the caliph at Baghdad could not even command
the allegiance of all Moslems in the eastern half of his empire,
although his name appeared on coins of the realm and was included in the
prayers of his “subjects.” The unity of the Arab world, in other words,
was more economic and religious than it was political. Arabic was not
necessarily the common language, although it was a kind of lingua franca
for intellectuals. Hence, it may be more appropriate to speak of the
culture as Islamic, rather than Arabic, although we shall use the terms
more or less interchangeably.</p>
<p>During the first century of the Arabic conquests, there had been
political and intellectual confusion, and possibly this accounts for the
difficulty in localizing the origin of the modern system of numeration.
The Arabs were at first without known intellectual interest, and they
had little culture, beyond a language, to impose on the peoples they
conquered. In this respect, we see a repetition of the situation when
Rome conquered Greece, of which it was said that in a cultural sense,
captive Greece took captive the captor Rome. By about 750 CE, the Arabs
were ready to have history repeat itself, for the conquerors became
eager to absorb the learning of the civilizations they had overrun. We
learn that by the 770s, an astronomical-mathematical work known to the
Arabs as the Sindhind was brought to Baghdad</p>
<p>T he Hous e of W i s dom</p>
<p>from India. A few years later, perhaps about 775, this Siddhanta was
translated into Arabic, and it was not long afterward (ca. 780) that
Ptolemy’s astrological Tetrabiblos was translated into Arabic from the
Greek. Alchemy and astrology were among the first studies to appeal to
the dawning intellectual interests of the conquerors. The “Arabic
miracle” lies not so much in the rapidity with which the political
empire rose, as in the alacrity with which, their tastes once aroused,
the Arabs absorbed the learning of their neighbors.</p>
