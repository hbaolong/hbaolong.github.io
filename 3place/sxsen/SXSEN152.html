<h4 id="fermats-loci">Fermat’s Loci</h4>
<p>If Descartes had a rival in mathematical ability, it was Fermat, but
the latter was in no sense a professional mathematician. Fermat studied
law at Toulouse, where he then served in the local parlement, first as a
lawyer and later as councilor. This meant that he was a busy man, yet he
seems to have had time to enjoy as an avocation a taste for classical
literature, science, and mathematics. The result was that by 1629, he
began to make discoveries of capital importance in mathematics. In this
year, he joined in one of the favorite sports of the time—the
“restoration” of lost works of antiquity on the basis of information
found in extant classical treatises. Fermat undertook to reconstruct the
Plane Loci of Apollonius, depending on allusions contained in the
Mathematical Collection of Pappus. A by-product of this effort was the
discovery, at least by 1636, of the fundamental principle of analytic
geometry:</p>
<p>Whenever in a final equation two unknown quantities are found, we
have a locus, the extremity of one of these describing a line, straight
or curved.</p>
<p>This profound statement, written a year before the appearance of
Descartes’ Geometry, seems to have grown out of Fermat’s application of
the analysis of Viete to the study of loci in Apollonius. In this case,
as also in` that of Descartes, the use of coordinates did not arise from
practical considerations or from the medieval graphical representation
of functions. It came about through the application of Renaissance
algebra to problems from ancient geometry. Yet Fermat’s point of view
was not entirely in</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L o c i</p>
<p>conformity with that of Descartes, for Fermat emphasized the
sketching of
solutionsofindeterminateequations,insteadofthegeometricconstruction of
the roots of determinate algebraic equations. Moreover, where Descartes
had built his Geometry around the difficult Pappus problem, Fermat
limitedhisexposition,intheshorttreatisetitledAdLocosPlanosetSolidos
Isagoge (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci), to the simplest loci
only. Where Descartes had begun with the three- and four-line locus,
using one of the lines as an axis of abscissas, Fermat began with the
linear equation and chose an arbitrary coordinate system on which to
sketch it.</p>
<p>Using the notation of Viete, Fermat first sketched the simplest case
of<code>a linear equation—given in Latin as “D in A aequetur B in E” (that is, Dx5By in modern symbolism). The graph is, of course, a straight line through the origin of coordinates—or rather a half line with the origin as end point, for Fermat, like Descartes, did not use negative abscissas. The more general linear equation ax1by5c2 (for Fermat retained Viete’s</code>
homogeneity) he sketched as a line segment in the first quadrant
terminated by the coordinate axes. Next, to show the power of his method
for handling loci, Fermat announced the following problem that he had
discovered by the new approach:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, in a plane, the locus of a point
such that the sum of any multiples of the segments drawn at given angles
from the point to the given lines is constant, is a straight line.</p>
<p>That is, of course, a simple corollary of the fact that the segments
are linear functions of the coordinates and of Fermat’s proposition that
every equation of the first degree represents a straight line.</p>
<p>Fermat next showed that xy5k2 is a hyperbola and that an equation of
the form xy1a2 5bx1cy can be reduced to one of the form xy5k2 (by a
translation of axes). The equation x2 5y2 he considered as a single
straight
line(orray),forheoperatedonlyinthefirstquadrant,andhereducedother
homogeneous equations of the second degree to this form. Then, he showed
that a2 6x2 5by is a parabola, that x2 1y2 12ax12by5c2 is a circle, that
a2 2x2 5ky2 is an ellipse, and that a2 1x2 5ky2 is a hyperbola
(forwhichhegavebothbranches).Tomoregeneralquadraticequations,in
whichtheseveralsecond-degreetermsappear,Fermatappliedarotationof axes to
reduce them to the earlier forms. As the “crowning point” of his
treatise, Fermat considered the following proposition:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, the locus of a point such that the
sum of the squares of the segments drawn at given angles from the point
to the lines is constant, is a solid locus.</p>
<p>This proposition is obvious in terms of Fermat’s exhaustive analysis
of the various cases of quadratic equations in two unknowns. As an
appendix to the Introduction to Loci, Fermat added “The Solution of
Solid Problems by Means of Loci,” pointing out that determinate cubic
and quartic equations can be solved by conics, the theme that had loomed
so large in the geometry of Descartes.</p>
<p>Higher-Dimensional Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Fermat’s Introduction to Loci was not published during the author’s
lifetime; hence, analytic geometry in the minds of many was regarded as
the unique invention of Descartes. It is now clear that Fermat had
discovered
essentiallythesamemethodwellbeforetheappearanceofLag´eome´trieand that
his work circulated in manuscript form until its publication in 1679 in
Varia opera mathematica. It is a pity that Fermat published almost
nothing during his lifetime, for his exposition was much more systematic
and didactic than that of Descartes. Moreover, his analytic geometry was
somewhat closer to ours,in that ordinatesare usuallytaken at
rightanglesto the line of abscissas. Like Descartes, Fermat was aware of
an analytic geometry of more than two dimensions, for in another
connection he wrote,</p>
<p>Therearecertainproblemswhichinvolveonlyoneunknown,andwhichcan be
called determinate, to distinguish them from the problems of loci. There
are certain others which involve two unknowns and which can never be
reduced to a single one; these are the problems of loci. In the first
problems we seek a unique point, in the latter a curve. But if the
proposed problem involves three unknowns, one has to find, to satisfy
the equation, not only a point or a curve, but an entire surface. In
this way surface loci arise, etc.</p>
<p>Here in the final “etc.” there is a hint of geometry of more than
three dimensions, but if Fermat really had this in mind, he did not
carry it further. Even the geometry of three dimensions had to wait
until the eighteenth century for its effective development.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Differentiations</p>
<p>It is possible that Fermat was in possessionof his analytic geometry
asearly as 1629, for about this time he made two significant discoveries
that are closely related to his work on loci. The more important of
these was described a few years later in a treatise, again unpublished
in his lifetime,
titledMethodofFindingMaximaandMinima.Fermathadbeenconsidering
locigiven(inmodernnotation)byequationsoftheformy5xn;hence,today
theyareoftenknownas“parabolasofFermat”ifnispositiveor“hyperbolas of
Fermat” if n is negative. Here we have an analytic geometry of higher
plane curves, but Fermat went further. For polynomial curves of the form
y5f(x), he noted a very ingenious method of finding points at which
the</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L o c i</p>
<p>function takes on a maximum or a minimum value. He compared the value
of f(x) at a point with the value f(x1E) at a neighboring point.
Ordinarily, these values will be distinctly different, but at the top or
the bottom of a smooth curve, the change will be almost imperceptible.
Hence, to find maximum and minimum points Fermat equated f(x) and
f(x1E), realizing thatthevalues,althoughnotexactly
thesame,arealmostequal.Thesmaller the interval E between the two points,
the nearer the pseudoequality comes to being a true equation, so Fermat,
after dividing through by E, set E50.
Theresultsgavehimtheabscissasofthemaximumandtheminimumpoints of the
polynomial. Here in essence is the process now called differentiation,
for the method of Fermat is equivalent to finding</p>
<p>fðx1EÞ2fðxÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>E-0 E</p>
<p>and setting this equal to zero. Hence, it is appropriate to follow
Laplace in acclaiming Fermat as the discoverer of the differential
calculus, as well as a codiscoverer of analytic geometry. Fermat was not
in possession of the limit concept, but, otherwise, his method of maxima
and minima parallels that used in the calculus today.</p>
<p>During the very years in which Fermat was developing his analytic
geometry, he also discovered how to apply his neighborhood process to
find the tangent to an algebraic curve of the form y5f(x). If P is a
point on the curve y5f(x) at which the tangent is desired, and if the
coordinates of P are (a, b), then a neighboring point on the curve with
coordinates x2a1E, y5f(a1E) will lie so close to the tangent that one
can think of it as approximately on the tangent, as well as on the
curve. If, therefore, the subtangent at the point P is TQ5c (Fig. 15.7),
the triangles TPQ and TPuQu can be taken as being virtually similar.
Hence, one has the proportion</p>
<p>b fða1EÞ</p>
<p>5 :</p>
<p>c c1E</p>
<p>On cross-multiplying, canceling like terms, recalling that b5f(a),
then dividing through by E, and finally setting E50, the subtangent c is
readily found.</p>
<p>Fermat’s procedure amounts to saying that</p>
<p>fða1EÞ2fðaÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>E-0 E</p>
<p>is the slope of the curve at x 5a, but Fermat did not explain his
procedure satisfactorily, saying simply that it was similar to his
method of maxima and minima. Descartes in particular, when the method
was reported to him in 1638 by Mersenne, attacked it as not generally
valid. He proposed as a challenge the curve ever since known as the
“folium of Descartes”: x3 1y3 53axy. That mathematicians of the time
were quite unfamiliar with negative coordinates is apparent, in that the
curve was drawn as but a single folium or “leaf” in the first
quadrant—or sometimes as a four-leaf clover, with one leaf in each
quadrant! Ultimately, Descartes grudgingly conceded the validity of
Fermat’s tangent method, but Fermat was never accorded the esteem to
which he was entitled.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Integrations</p>
<p>Fermat not only had a method for finding the tangent to curves of the
form y5xm, he also, some time after 1629, hit on a theorem on the area
under these curves—the theorem that Cavalieri published in 1635 and
1647. In finding the area, Fermat at first seems to have used formulas
for the sums of powers of the integers, or inequalities of the form</p>
<p>m m m m nm11 m m m</p>
<p>1 12 13 1 1n ..1 12 13 1 1ðn21Þm m11</p>
<p>to establish the result for all positive integral values of m. This,
in itself, was an advance over the work of Cavalieri, who limited
himself to the cases from m51 to m59, but later Fermat developed a
better method for handling the problem, which was applicable to
fractional, as well as integral, values of m. Let the curve be y5xn, and
seek the area under the curve from x50 to x5a. Then Fermat subdivided
the interval from x50 to x5a into infinitely many subintervals by taking
the points with abscissas a, aE, aE2, aE3,…, where E is a quantity less
than 1. At these points, he erected ordinates to the curve and then
approximated to the area under the curve by means of rectangles (as
indicated in Fig. 15.8). The areas of the successive approximating
circumscribed rectangles, beginning with the largest, are given by the
terms in geometric progression an(a2aE), anEn(aE2aE2), anE2n(aE2 2aE3)….
The sum to infinity of these terms is</p>
<p>Gr e gor y of St. V|ncent</p>
<p>an11ð12n1E1 Þ a2n11 n or :</p>
<p>12E 11E 1E 1 1E</p>
<p>As E tends toward 1—that is, as the rectangles become narrower—the
sum of the areas of the rectangles approaches the area under the curve.
On letting E 5 1 in the previous formula for the sum of the rectangles,
we obtain (an11)/(n11), the desired area under the curve y5xn from x50
to x5a. To show that this also holds for rational fractional values,
p/q, let n5p/q. The sum of the geometric progression then is</p>
<p>p1q =q12Epqq p1q =q 11E 1E2 1 1Epq1q1 1 að Þ5að Þ;</p>
<p>12E þ 11E 1E 1 1E</p>
<p>and, when E51, this becomes</p>
<p>q p1q =q</p>
<p>að Þ :</p>
<p>p1q</p>
<p>If, in modern notation, we wish to obtain bxndx, it is only necessary
to observe that this isÐb0xndx2Ða0xndx. Ða</p>
<p>For negative values of n (except n5 1) Fermat used a similar
procedure, except that E is taken as greater than 1 and tends toward 1
from above, the area found being that beneath the curve from x5a to
infinity. To find bx ndx, then, it was only necessary to note that this
is</p>
<p>Ð</p>
<p>N n ÐaÐNb n a x dx2 x dx:</p>
<p>Gregory of St.Vincent</p>
<p>For n5 1 the procedure fails, but Fermat’s older contemporary Gregory
of St. Vincent (1584 1667) disposed of this case in his Opus Geometricum
Quadraturae Circuli et Sectionum Coni (Geometrical Work on the Squaring
of the Circle and of Conic Sections). Much of this work had been
completed before the time that Fermat was working on tangents and areas,
perhaps as early as 1622 1625, although it was not published until 1647.
Gregory of St. Vincent, born in Ghent, was a Jesuit teacher in Rome and
Prague and later became a tutor at the court of Philip IV of Spain.
Through his travels, he became separated from his papers, with the
result that the appearance of the Opus Geometricum was long delayed. In
this treatise, Gregory had shown that if along the x-axis one marks off
from x5a points the intervals between which are increasing in continued
geometric proportion, and if at these points ordinates are erected to
the hyperbola xy51, then the areas under the curve intercepted between
successive ordinates are equal. That is, as the abscissa increases
geometrically, the area under the curve increases arithmetically. Hence,
the equivalent of bx 1dx5lnb2lna was known to Gregory and his
contemporaries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a faulty application of the method of indivisibles had
ledÐa Gregory of St. Vincent to believe that he had squared the circle,
an error that damaged his reputation.</p>
<p>Fermat had been concerned with many aspects of infinitesimal
analysis—tangents, quadratures, volumes, lengths of curves, centers of
gravity. He could scarcely have failed to notice that in finding
tangents to y5kxn, one multiplies the coefficient by the exponent and
lowers the exponent by 1, whereas in finding areas one raises the
exponent and divides by the new exponent. Could the inverse nature of
these two problems have escaped him? Although this seems unlikely, it
nevertheless appears that he nowhere called attention to the
relationship now known as the fundamental theorem of the calculus.</p>
<p>The inverse relationship between area and tangent problems should
have been apparent from a comparison of Gregory of St. Vincent’s area
under the hyperbola and Descartes’ analysis of inverse tangent problems
proposed through Mersenne in 1638. The problems had been set by
Florimond Debeaune (1601 1652), a jurist at Blois who was also an
accomplished mathematician, for whom even Descartes expressed
admiration. One of the problems called for the determination of a curve
whose tangent had the property now expressed by the differential
equation ady/dx5x2y. Descartes recognized the solution as nonalgebraic,
but he evidently just missed seeing that logarithms were involved.</p>
