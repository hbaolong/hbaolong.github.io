<h4 id="mathematical-instruments">Mathematical Instruments</h4>
<p>The invention of logarithms, as well as the spreading use of decimal
fractions, is closely linked to seventeenth-century efforts to invent
mathematical instruments that would facilitate computation. Three groups
of devices merit our attention: those leading to the computing sector of
the eighteenthandearly nineteenthcenturies:theGuntersscaleandearlyslide
rules, and the first mechanical adding and calculating machines.</p>
<p>Computing Sectors</p>
<p>The first group of instruments originated with Thomas Hood and
Galileo Galilei. Galileo had originally intended to take a degree in
medicine, but</p>
<p>a taste for Euclid and Archimedes led him instead to become a
professor of mathematics, first at Pisa and later at Padua. This does
not mean, however, that he taught on the level of the authors he
admired. Little mathematics was included in university curricula of the
time, and a large proportion of what was taught in Galileo’s courses
would now be classified as physics or astronomy or engineering
applications. Moreover, Galileo was not a “mathematician’s
mathematician,” as was Vie`te; he came close to being what we should
call a mathematical practitioner. Among his first inventions that may be
called special-purpose computing devices was a pulse measuring device.
His interest in computational techniques led him in 1597 to construct
and market a better-known device that he called his “geometric and
military compasses.”</p>
<p>In a pamphlet of 1606 with the title Le operazioni del compasso
geometricoetmilitare,hedescribedindetailthewayinwhichthegeometricand
militarycompasscouldbeusedtoquicklyperformavarietyofcomputations,
without pen or paper or an abacus. The theory behind this was extremely
elementary, and the degree of accuracy was very limited, but the
financial success of Galileo’s device shows that military engineers and
other practitioners found a need for such an aid in calculation. Bu¨rgi
had constructed a similar device, but Galileo had a better
entrepreneurial sense, one that gave him an advantage. The Galilean
compasses consisted of two arms pivoted as in the ordinary compasses of
today, but each of the arms was engraved with graduated scales of
varying types. Fig. 14.2 shows a reduced version with only one
arithmetic scale, the simple equi-spaced markings up to 250, and only
the simplest of the many possible computations, the first one
explainedbyGalileo,isdescribedhere.If,forinstance,onewishestodividea
given line segment into five equal parts, one opens a pair of ordinary
compasses (or dividers) to the length of the line segment. Then, one
opens the geometric compasses so that the distance between the points of
the dividers just spans the distance between two markings, one on each
arm of the geometric compasses, which are simple integral multiples of
five, say, the number 200 on each scale. Then, if one holds the opening
of the geometric</p>
<p>FIG. 14.2</p>
<p>A Butterfield sector (from the collections of the National Museum of
American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<p>compasses fixed and places the ends of the dividers on the mark for
40 on each scale, the distance between the divider points will be the
desired fifth of
thelengthoftheoriginallinesegment.TheinstructionsGalileoprovidedwith his
compasses included many other operations, from changing the scale of a
drawing to computing amounts of money under compound interest.</p>
<p>Gunters Scale and Slide Rules</p>
<p>It was Edmund Gunter (1581 1626), a graduate of Christ Church,
Oxford, and the rector of two churches, who invented a widely used
computing device and the precursor of the logarithmic slide rule. A
friend of Henry Briggs’s and a frequent visitor of Briggs at Gresham
College, he was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham in 1620.
Shortly thereafter, he published a Description and Use of the Sector,
the Crosse-staffe and Other Instruments. Here he described what came to
be known as “the gunter” or Gunters scale, consisting of a 2-foot-long
logarithmic scale used with a pair of dividers. This and his other
contributions to mathematical instrumentation were motivated by his
interest in assisting sailors, surveyors, and others not skilled in
multiplication and other mathematical computational techniques. Other
devices that bear his name include the surveyor’s Gunters chain, a
portable chain 66 feet long consisting of 100 links (note that 1 acre is
43,560 or 66366310square feet). He also contributed to navigation by his
studies of magnetic declination and his observation of the secular
variation.</p>
<p>In 1624, Edmund Wingate displayed a Gunters scale to a group of
scientists and engineers in Paris. This resulted in a French description
of the device being published that same year. Wingate called it a rule
of proportion, and the French description indicated that it included
four lines: a line of numbers; a line of tangents; a line of sines; and
two 1-foot lines, one divided into inches and tenths of inches, the
other into tenths and hundredths.</p>
<p>A major drawback of the device was its length. By midcentury, Wingate
had circumvented this by splitting the scales, adding additional ones,
and using both sides of the rule. A number of other British innovators
brought out improvements on the rule as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the early 1630s, several slide rules were publicized.
William Oughtred (1574 1660) invented a circular and a linear slide
rule. To do away with the dividers, he used two Gunter rules. Another
early deviser of slide rules was Richard Delamain, who claimed priority
over Oughtred’s invention by virtue of an earlier publication.</p>
<p>The interest aroused by the inventions, as well as the ensuing
priority disputes, led to the slide rule rapidly becoming a standard
accessory for people in occupations that involved computation on a
regular basis. Although the mathematical principles remained those
linked to the discoveries of the early seventeenth century, the form of
the slide rule best known in the twentieth century followed the 1850
design of the French army officer Ame´de´e Mannheim (1831 1906), who had
a long affiliation with the E´cole Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Adding and Calculating Machines</p>
<p>Mechanical adding and calculating machines also appeared in the
seventeenth century. Their history was the converse of that of computing
scales and slide rules. Here, there were no new mathematical principles,
as was true in the case of the devices that used the concept of
logarithms. Yet their acceptance was long delayed, largely because of
more complex</p>
<p>Pascal’s adding machine (from the collection of IBM)</p>
<p>Thomas’s first arithmometer (from the collections of the National
Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<p>construction requirements and higher costs. We mention the three best
known. Wilhelm Schickard (1592 1635), a Lutheran minister who held
academic positions as professor of Hebrew and, later, as professor of
mathematics and astronomy, was a correspondent of Kepler’s who used
Schickard’s talents as an engraver and arithmetician. Schickard produced
several designs of a mechanical device; the only one constructed at the
time was destroyed in a fire. Blaise Pascal designed an adding machine
to assist his father in tax and commercial computations, but although he
had several of his machines produced for sale and some have even turned
up in China, production was stopped after about ten years. Leibniz,
whose teacher Erhard Weigel had used an open meadow to drill multitudes
of adults in their multiplication tables, used the principle of a
movable carriage to emulate the concept of the carry in multiplication,
but his attempts to interest members of the leading scientific societies
in his machine were unsuccessful. The calculating machine industry did
not get off the ground until the nineteenth century, when Charles X.
Thomas of Colmar produced his so-called arithmometer, a stepped-drum,
movable-carriage machine.</p>
