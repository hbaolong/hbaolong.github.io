<h4 id="cauchy">Cauchy</h4>
<p>The star of the 1820s was a man born in the year of the revolution,
when Fourier was twenty-one. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789 1857), the son
of well-educated parents, studied at the E´cole Polytechnique, which
he</p>
<p>entered in 1805, and the E´cole des Ponts et Chaussees, where he
matri-´ culated in 1807. He served as an engineer until 1813, when he
returned to Paris. By that time, he had already solved several problems
of interest to mathematicians. These included the determination of a
convex polyhedron by its faces, the expression of a number as a sum of
n-gonal numbers, and a study of determinants. The latter is one of the
few branches in which the role of Gauss was slight, although it was from
the terminology of Gauss in a somewhat different context that Cauchy
derived the name “determinant” for what he otherwise described as a
class of alternating symmetric functions, such as a1b2 2b1a2. A good
case could be made for having the definitive history of determinants
begin in 1812, when Cauchy read to the Institut a long memoir on the
subject, although in doing so, one would fail to do justice to some
pioneer work as early as 1772 by Laplace and Alexandre-Theophile
Vandermonde´ (1735 1796). Both Lagrange and Laplace had taken an
interest in Cauchy’s progress, and he followed in the tradition of
Lagrange in his preference for pure mathematics in elegant form with due
attention to rigorous proofs. His 1812 paper on determinants, to be
followed by many others from him on the same topic, was in this
tradition of giving emphasis to the symmetries of notation with which it
abounds.</p>
<p>In the pedagogical approach to determinants, today it is customary to
begin with the square array and then to attach a meaning or a value to
this through an expansion in terms of transpositions or permutations. In
the memoir of Cauchy, the author did the opposite. He began with the n
elements or numbers, a1, a2, a3,…an, and formed the product of these by
all of the differences of distinct elements: a1a2a3 …an(a2 2a1) (a3
2a1)…(an 2a1)(a3 2a2)…(an 2a2)…(an 2an 1). He then defined the
determinant as the expression obtained on changing every indicated power
into a second subscript, so that asr becomes ars; he wrote this as S (6
a11a2 2a33 …ann). Then he arranged the n2 different quantities in this
determinant in a square array not unlike that used today:</p>
<p>a1 1;a1 2;a1 3;…a1 n a2 1;a2 2;a2 3;…a2 n a n 1;an 2;an 3;…an n</p>
<p>As thus arranged, the n2 quantities in his determinant were said to
form “a symmetric system of order n.” He defined conjugate terms as
elements the orders of whose subscripts are reversed, and he called
terms that are selfconjugate “principal terms”; the product of the terms
in what we call the “main diagonal” or the “principal diagonal,” he
called the “principal product.” Later in the memoir, Cauchy gave other
rules for determining the sign of a term in the expansion, using
circular substitutions.</p>
<p>Cauchy’s eighty-four-page memoir of 1812 was not his only work on the
subject of determinants; from then on, he found many opportunities to
use them in a variety of situations. In a memoir of 1815, on wave
propagation, he applied the language of determinants to a problem in
geometry and also to one in physics. Cauchy asserted that if A, B, and C
are the lengths of three edges of a parallelepiped, and if the
projections of these on the x, y, and z axes of a rectangular coordinate
system are</p>
<p>A1; B1; C1 A2; B2; C2</p>
<p>A3; B3; C3;</p>
<p>then the volume of the parallelepiped will be A1B2C3 2A1B3C2 1
A2B3C12A2B1C3 1A3B1C2 2A3B2C1 5S(6A1B2C3). In the same memoir, in
connection with the propagation of waves, he applied his determinant
notation to partial derivatives, replacing a condition that required two
lines for its expression by the simple abbreviation</p>
<p>S 651: dx dy dz da db dc</p>
<p>The left-hand side of this is obviously what is now called the
“Jacobian” of x, y, z with respect to a, b, c. The name of Carl Gustav
Jacob Jacobi is attached to functional determinants of this form not
because he was the first to use them, but because he was an algorithm
builder who was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities inherent
in determinant notations. It was not until 1829 that Jacobi first used
the functional determinants that bear his name.</p>
<p>By this time, Cauchy was well established in Paris. In 1814, two
years after the memoir on determinants, he had presented to the French
Academy a paper that contains the germs of some of his major
contributions to the theory of complex functions. After another two
years, he received praise for a prize-winning memoir on hydrodynamics.
The year 1819 finds him displaying the method of characteristics in the
solution of partial differential equations; shortly thereafter, he
submitted a classic on the theory of elasticity. During this decade, he
was appointed to membership in the Academy of Sciences, as well as a
professorship at the E´cole Polytechnique; after this, he married.</p>
<p>Cauchy filled the Journal of the E´cole Polytechnique and the
Cornptes Rendus of the Academie with ever longer memoirs. These were on
a´ variety of topics but especially on the theory of functions of a
complex variable, a field of which, from 1814 on, Cauchy became the
effective founder. In 1806, Jean Robert Argand (1768 1822) of Geneva had
published an account of the graphical representation of complex numbers.
Although, at first, this went almost as unnoticed as the work of Caspar
Wessel, by the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century, most
of Europe was familiar, through Cauchy, not only with the
WesselArgand-Gaussian diagram for a complex number, but with the
fundamental properties of complex functions as well. In the eighteenth
century, problems in complex variables occasionally had arisen in
connection with the physics of Euler and d’Alembert, but now they became
a part of pure mathematics. Inasmuch as two dimensions are required for
a pictorial representation of the independent variable alone, it would
take four dimensions to graphically portray a functional relationship
between two complex variables, w5f(z). Complex variable theory entails a
higher degree of abstraction and complexity than does the study of
functions of a real variable. Definitions and rules of differentiation,
for example, cannot readily be carried over from the real case to the
complex, and the derivative in the latter case is no longer pictured as
the slope of the tangent to a curve. Without the crutch of
visualization, one is likely to require more precise and careful
definitions of concepts. To supply this need was one of Cauchy’s
contributions to the calculus, for both real variables and complex
variables.</p>
<p>The first teachers in the E´cole Polytechnique had set a precedent
according to which even the greatest of mathematicians are not above
writing textbooks on all levels, and Cauchy followed in this tradition.
In three books—Cours d’ analyse de l’E´cole Polytechnique (1821),
Resume´ des lec¸ons sur le calcul infinitesimal (1823), and Lec¸ons sur
le calcul differentiel´ (1829)—he gave to elementary calculus the
character that it bears today. Rejecting the “Taylor’s theorem approach”
of Lagrange, he made the limit concept of d’Alembert fundamental, but he
gave it an arithmetic character of greater precision. Dispensing with
geometry and with infinitesimals or velocities, he gave a relatively
clear-cut definition of limit:</p>
<p>When the successive values attributed to a variable approach
indefinitely a fixed value so as to end by differing from it by as
little as one wishes, this last is called the limit of all the
others.</p>
<p>Where many earlier mathematicians had thought of an infinitesimal as
a very small fixed number, Cauchy clearly defined it as a dependent
variable:</p>
<p>One says that a variable quantity becomes infinitely small when its
numerical value decreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge
toward the limit zero.</p>
<p>In the calculus of Cauchy, the concepts of function and limit of a
function were fundamental. In defining the derivative of y5f(x) with
respect to x, he gave to the variable x an increment Δx5i and formed the
ratio</p>
<p>Δy fðx1iÞ2fðxÞ</p>
<p>5 :</p>
<p>Δx i</p>
<p>The limit of this difference quotient as i approaches zero he defined
as the derivative fu(x) of y with respect to x. The differential he
relegated to a subsidiary role, although he was aware of its operational
facility. If dx is a finite quantity, the differential dy of y5f(x) is
defined simply as fu(x)dx. Cauchy also gave a satisfactory definition of
a continuous function. The function f(x) is continuous within given
limits if between these limits an infinitely small increment i in the
variable x always produces an infinitely small increment, f(x1i)2f(x),
in the function itself. When we bear in mind Cauchy’s definition of
infinitely small quantities in terms of limits, his definition of
continuity parallels that used today.</p>
<p>During the eighteenth century, integration had been treated as the
inverse of differentiation. Cauchy’s definition of derivative makes it
clear that the derivative will not exist at a point for which the
function is discontinuous, yet the integral may afford no difficulty.
Even discontinuous curves may determine a well-defined area. Hence,
Cauchy defined the definite integral in terms of the limit of the
integral sums in a manner not very different from that used in
elementary textbooks today, except that he took the value of the
function always at the left-hand end point of the interval. If Sn 5(x1
2x0)f(x0)1(x2 2x1 )f(x1) 1(X2xn 1) f(xn 1), then the limit S of this sum
Sn, as the magnitudes of the intervals xi 2xi 1 decrease indefinitely,
is the definite integral of the function f(x) for the interval from x5x0
to x5X. It is from Cauchy’s concept of the integral as a limit of a sum,
rather than from the antiderivative, that the many fruitful modern
generalizations of the integral have arisen.</p>
<p>Having defined the integral independently of differentiation, it was
necessary for Cauchy to prove the usual relation between the integral
and the antiderivative, and this he accomplished through use of the
theorem of mean value. If f(x) is continuous over the closed interval
〔a, b〕 and differentiable over the open interval (a, b), then there
will be some value x0 such that a,x0 ,b and f(b)2f(a)5(b2a)fu(x0). This
is a fairly obvious generalization of Rolle’s theorem, which was known a
century earlier. The mean-value theorem, however, did not attract
serious attention until the days of Cauchy, but it has since continued
to play a basic role in analysis. It is with justice, therefore, that a
still more general form,</p>
<p>fðbÞ2fðaÞ f 0ðx0Þ</p>
<p>5 gðbÞ2gðaÞ g0ðx0Þ</p>
<p>with suitable restrictions on f(x) and g(x), is known as Cauchy’s
meanvalue theorem.</p>
<p>The history of mathematics teems with cases of simultaneity and near
simultaneity of discovery, some of which have already been noted. The
work by Cauchy that we have just described is another case in point, for
similar views were developed at about the same time by Bernhard Bolzano
(1781 1848), a Czechoslovakian priest whose theological views were
frowned on by his church and whose mathematical work was most
undeservedly overlooked by his lay and clerical contemporaries. For a
time Cauchy lived at Prague, where Bolzano was born and died, yet there
is no indication that the men met. The similarity in their
arithmetization of the calculus and of their definitions of limit,
derivative, continuity, and convergence was only a coincidence. In 1817,
Bolzano had published a book, Rein analytischer Beweis, devoted to a
purely arithmetic proof of the location theorem in algebra, and this had
required a nongeometric approach to the continuity of a curve or a
function. Going considerably further in his unorthodox ideas, he
disclosed some important properties of infinite sets in a posthumous
work of 1850, Paradoxien des Unendlichen.</p>
<p>From Galileo’s paradox on the one-to-one correspondence between
integers and perfect squares, Bolzano went on to show that similar
correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and a proper
subset are commonplace. For example, a simple linear equation, such as
y52x, establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the real numbers y
in the interval from 0 to 2, for example, and the real numbers x in half
of this interval. That is, there are just as many real numbers between 0
and 1 as between 0 and 2, or just as many points in a line segment 1
inch long as in a line segment 2 inches long. Bolzano even seems to have
recognized, by about 1840, that the infinity of real numbers is of a
type different from the infinity of integers, being nondenumerable. In
such speculations on infinite sets, the Bohemian philosopher came closer
to parts of modern mathematics than had his better-known contemporaries.
Both Gauss and Cauchy seem to have had a kind of horror infiniti,
insisting that there could be no such thing as a completed infinite in
mathematics. Their work on “orders of infinity” in reality was far
removed from the concepts of Bolzano, for to say, as Cauchy in essence
did, that a function y is infinite of order n with respect to x if
limx-Ny=xn 5K 6¼ 0 is quite different from making a statement about
correspondences between sets.</p>
<p>Bolzano was a “voice crying in the wilderness,” and many of his
results had to be rediscovered later. Among these was the recognition
that there are pathological functions that do not behave as
mathematicians had always expected them to behave. Newton, for instance,
had assumed that curves are generated by smooth and continuous motions.
There might be occasional abrupt changes in direction or even some
discontinuities at isolated points, but during the first half of the
nineteenth century, it was generally assumed that a continuous real
function must have a derivative at most points. In 1834, however,
Bolzano had thought up a function continuous for an interval but,
despite physical intuition to the contrary, having no derivative at any
point in the interval. The example given by Bolzano unfortunately did
not become known; hence, credit for building the first continuous but
nowhere differentiable function generally goes to Karl Weierstrass about
a third of a century later. Similarly, it is the name of Cauchy, rather
than that of Bolzano, that is attached to an important test of
convergence for an infinite series or sequence. Occasionally, before
their time, there had been warnings about the need to test an infinite
series for convergence. For example, as early as 1812, Gauss used the
ratio test to show that his hypergeometric series</p>
<p>αβðα11Þðβ1Þ 1Þ 2</p>
<p>11x1x 1</p>
<p>1U2γðγ11 αβðα11Þðβ11Þ ðα1n21Þðβ1n21Þ n 1U2 ðn21Þγðγ11Þ ðλ1n21Þ x
1</p>
<p>converges for 7x7,1 and diverges for 7x7.1. This test seems to have
been first used much earlier, in England, by Edward Waring, although it
generally bears the name of d’Alembert or, more occasionally, that of
Cauchy. In 1811, Gauss informed an astronomer friend, F. W. Bessel
(1784</p>
<p>1846), of a discovery that he had made in what was soon to become a
new subject in the hands of Cauchy and that today bears the latter’s
name. The theory of functions of a real variable had been developed by
Lagrange, but the theory of functions of a complex variable awaited the
efforts of Cauchy, yet Gauss perceived a theorem of fundamental
significance in the as-yet-unworked field. If, in the complex or
Gaussian plane, one draws a simple closed curve, and if a function f(z)
of the complex variable z5x1iy is analytic (that is, has a derivative)
at every point on the curve and within the curve, then the line integral
of f(z) taken along the curve is zero.</p>
<p>The name of Cauchy appears today in connection with a number of
theorems on infinite series, for, despite some efforts on the part of
Gauss and Abel, it was largely through Cauchy that the mathematician’s
conscience was pricked concerning the need for vigilance with regard to
convergence. Having defined a series to be convergent if, for increasing
values of n, the sum Sn of the first n terms approaches a limit S,
called the sum of the series, Cauchy proved that a necessary and
sufficient condition that an infinite series converge is that for a
given value of p, the magnitude of the difference between Sn and Sn1p
tends toward zero as n increases indefinitely. This condition for
“convergence within itself” has come to be known as Cauchy’s criterion,
but it was known earlier to Bolzano (and possibly still earlier to
Euler).</p>
<p>In 1831, Cauchy also announced the theorem that an analytic function
of a complex variable w5f(z) can be expanded about a point z5z0 in a
power series that is convergent for all values of z within a circle
having z0 as center and passing through the singular point of f(z)
nearest to z0. From this time on, the use of infinite series became an
essential part of the theory of functions of both real and complex
variables. Several tests for convergence bear Cauchy’s name, as does a
particular form of the remainder in the Taylor series expansion of a
function, the more usual form being attributed to Lagrange. The period
of rigor in mathematics was taking hold rapidly. It is said that when
Cauchy read his first paper on the convergence of series to the
Academie, Laplace hurried home to verify´ that he had not made use of
any divergent series in his Mecanique c´ eleste´ . Toward the end of his
life, Cauchy became aware of the important notion of “uniform
convergence,” but here, too, he was not alone, having been anticipated
by the physicist G. G. Stokes (1819 1903) and others.</p>
<p>As broader classes of differential equations were considered, the
question under what conditions a solution exists moved to the
foreground. Cauchy provided two widely used methods for answering this
question. Building on the work of Euler, Cauchy showed how to use a
method of approximations by difference equations, providing an existence
proof for the approximate solutions; this became the basis of the
CauchyLipschitz technique in the solution of ordinary differential
equations. Rudolf Lipschitz (1831 1904), a student of Dirichlet’s,
refined and generalized Cauchy’s work in 1876; he replaced the so-called
Lipschitz condition with Cauchy’s condition that the first derivatives
be continuous and extended the work to systems of higher-order
equations. Also due to Cauchy, though best known in the form given by
the French mathematicians Briot and Jean-Claude Bouquet in 1854, is the
method of majorants, which Cauchy called his calcul des limites. After
successfully using it for ordinary differential equations, Cauchy
applied it to certain systems of first-order partial differential
equations. Here again, his work cametobe known in the generalized form
it received from a later nineteenth-century mathematician. Sofia
Kovalevskaya (Sonia Kowalewski) (1850 1891) extended Cauchy’s result to
a broad class of equations of higher order, simplifying his technique in
the process; further streamlined by subsequent analysts, the
Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem received its best-known form in a textbook by
E´douard Goursat (1858 1936) that was widely used in the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Because of the legendary, voluminous nature of his publications,
Cauchy often lost track of results he had obtained. Also, as often
happens, he assessed the relative significance of his own work quite
differently from the way later generations have seen it. The best-known
illustration of this is found in complex function theory; here, he had
provided a powerful tool for analysts with the so-called Cauchy integral
theorem, yet he attached far more significance to his “calculus of
residues,” which failed to gain favor with later workers in the
field.</p>
<p>The prolific Cauchy contributed to almost as many fields as did his
contemporary Gauss. He, too, contributed to mechanics and error theory.
Although in the theory of numbers, his work is less well known than that
of Legendre and Gauss, it is to Cauchy that we owe the first general
proof of one of the most beautiful and difficult theorems of Fermat—that
every positive integer is the sum of at most three triangular numbers or
four square numbers or five pentagonal numbers or six hexagonal numbers,
and so on, indefinitely. This proof is a fitting climax to the study of
figurate numbers initiated by the Pythagoreans some 2,300 years
earlier.</p>
<p>Cauchy evidently was little attracted to geometry in its various
forms. In 1811, however, in one of his very earliest memoirs, he
presented a generalization of the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula
E125 F1V, where E, F, and V are, respectively, the number of edges,
faces, and vertices of the polyhedron; we have noted a case of his
application of determinants in finding the volume of a tetrahedron.</p>
