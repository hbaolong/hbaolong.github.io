<h4 id="chapter-14-early-modern-problem-solvers">Chapter 14 Early Modern
Problem Solvers</h4>
<p>In mathematics I can report no deficiency, except it be that men do
not sufficiently understand the excellent use of the Pure
Mathematics.</p>
<p>—Francis Bacon</p>
<p>Accessibility of Computation</p>
<p>During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, a growing
number of merchants, estate holders, scientists, and mathematical
practitioners were impressed by the need for means to simplify
arithmetic computations and geometric measurements and to enable a
population that was largely illiterate and numerically challenged to
participate in the commercial transactions of the day.</p>
<p>Among those seeking more effective aids for solving mathematical
problems were numerous well-known individuals. A few of the more
influential of these, scattered over Western Europe, we shall now
consider. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) came from Italy; several more,
such as Henry Briggs (1561–1639), Edmund Gunter (1581–1626), and William
Oughtred (1574–1660), were English; Simon Stevin (1548–1620) was
Flemish; John Napier (1550–1617), Scottish; Jobst Bürgi (1552–1632),
Swiss; and Johann Kepler (1571–1630), German. Bürgi was a clock and
instrument maker, Galileo was a physical scientist, and Stevin was an
engineer. We have seen that the work of Viète grew out of two factors in
particular: (1) the recovery of ancient Greek classics and (2) the
relatively new developments in medieval and early modern algebra.
Throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, both
professional and amateur theoretical mathematicians showed concern for
the practical techniques of computation, which contrasted strongly with
the dichotomy emphasized two millennia earlier by Plato.</p>
<p>Decimal Fractions</p>
<p>In 1579, Viète had urged the replacement of sexagesimal fractions
with decimal fractions. In 1585, an even stronger plea for the use of
the ten-scale for fractions, as well as for integers, was made by the
leading mathematician in the Low Countries, Simon Stevin of Bruges.
Under Prince Maurice of Nassau he served as quartermaster and as
commissioner of public works, and for a time he tutored the prince in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In the history of science, as well as in mathematics, Stevin is an
important figure. He and a friend dropped two spheres of lead, one ten
times the weight of the other, from a height of thirty feet onto a board
and found the sounds of their striking the board to be almost
simultaneous. But Stevin’s published report (in Flemish in 1586) of the
experiment has received far less notice than the similar and later
experiment attributed, on very doubtful evidence, to Galileo. On the
other hand, Stevin usually receives credit for the discovery of the law
of the inclined plane, justified by his familiar “wreath of spheres”
diagram, whereas this law had been given earlier by Jordanus
Nemorarius.</p>
<p>Although Stevin was a great admirer of the theoretical treatises of
Archimedes, there runs through the works of the Flemish engineer a
strain of practicality that is more characteristic of the Renaissance
period. Thus, Stevin was largely responsible for the introduction into
the Low Countries of double-entry bookkeeping fashioned after that of
Pacioli in Italy almost a century earlier. Of far more widespread
influence in economic practice, in engineering, and in mathematical
notations was Stevin’s little book with the Flemish title De thiende
(The Tenth), published in Leyden in 1585. A French version titled La
disme appeared in the same year and increased the popularity of the
book.</p>
<p>It is clear that Stevin was in no sense the inventor of decimal
fractions, nor was he the first systematic user of them. As we have
noted, more than incidental use of decimal fractions is found in ancient
China, in medieval Arabia, and in Renaissance Europe; by the time of
Viète’s forthright advocacy of decimal fractions in 1579, they were
generally accepted by mathematicians on the frontiers of research. Among
the common people, however, and even among mathematical practitioners,
decimal fractions became widely known only when Stevin undertook to
explain the system in full and elementary detail. He wished to teach
everyone “how to perform with an ease, unheard of, all computations
necessary between men by integers without fractions.” He did not write
his decimal expressions with denominators, as Viète had; instead, in a
circle above or after each digit he wrote the power of ten assumed as a
divisor. Thus, the value of π, approximately, appeared as</p>
<p>A page from Stevin’s work (1634 edition) showing Stevin’s notations
for decimal fractions</p>
<p>Instead of the words “tenth,” “hundredth,” and so on, he used
“prime,” “second,” and so on, somewhat as we still designate the places
in sexagesimal fractions.</p>
<p>Notation</p>
<p>Stevin was a practical-minded mathematician who saw little point in
the more speculative aspects of the subject. Of imaginary numbers, he
wrote, “There are enough legitimate things to work on without need to
get busy on uncertain matter.” Nevertheless, he was not narrow-minded,
and his reading of Diophantus impressed him with the importance of
appropriate notations as an aid to thought. Although he followed the
custom of Viète and other contemporaries in writing out some words, such
as that for equality, he preferred a purely symbolic notation for
powers. Carrying over to algebra his positional notation for decimal
fractions, he wrote instead of Q (or square), for C (or cube), for QQ
(or square-square), and so on. This notation may well have been
suggested by Bombelli’s Algebra. It also paralleled a notation of Bürgi,
who indicated powers of an unknown by placing Roman numerals over the
coefficients. Thus, x4 + 3x2 − 7x, for example, would be written by
Bürgi as</p>
<p>and by Stevin as</p>
<p>Stevin went further than Bombelli or Bürgi in proposing that such
notations be extended to fractional powers. (It is interesting to note
that although Oresme had used both fractional-power indices and
coordinate methods in geometry, these seem to have had only a very
indirect influence, if any, on the progress of mathematics in the Low
Countries and France in the early seventeenth century.) Even though
Stevin had no occasion to use the fractional index notation, he clearly
stated that in a circle would mean square root and that in a circle
would indicate the square root of the cube. A little later, Albert
Girard, the editor of Stevin’s works, adopted the circled-numerical
notation for powers, and he, too, indicated that this could be used for
roots instead of such symbols as and . Symbolic algebra was developing
apace, and it reached its maturity, only eight years after Girard’s
Invention nouvelle, in Descartes’ La géométrie.</p>
<p>The use of a decimal point separatrix is generally attributed either
to G. A. Magini (1555–1617), the cartographer who assumed the chair for
mathematics at his alma mater in Bologna in 1588, in his De planis
triangulis of 1592, or to Christopher Clavius (1537–1612), in a table of
sines of 1593. Clavius, born in Bamberg, joined the Jesuit Order before
age eighteen; received his education, including early studies at the
University of Coimbra in Portugal, within the order; and spent most of
his life teaching at the Collegio Romano in Rome. He was the author of
many widely read textbooks, and it is safe to assume that this helped
promote the use of the decimal point. But the decimal point did not
become popular until Napier used it more than twenty years later. In the
1616 English translation of Napier’s Descriptio, decimal fractions
appear as today, with a decimal point separating the integral and
fractional portions. In 1617, in the Rhabdologia, in which he described
computation using his rods, Napier referred to Stevin’s decimal
arithmetic and proposed a point or a comma as the decimal separatrix. In
the Napierian Constructio of 1619, the decimal point became standard in
England, but many European countries continue to this day to use the
decimal comma.</p>
<p>Logarithms</p>
<p>John Napier (or Neper), who published his description of logarithms
in 1614, was a Scottish laird, the Baron of Merchiston, who managed his
large estates, championed Protestantism, and wrote on varied topics. He
was interested only in certain aspects of mathematics, chiefly those
relating to computation and trigonometry. “Napier’s rods” or “bones”
were sticks on which multiplication tables were carved in a form ready
to be applied to lattice multiplication; “Napier’s analogies” and
“Napier’s rule of circular parts” were devices to aid the memory in
connection with spherical trigonometry.</p>
<p>Napier tells us that he had been working on his invention of
logarithms for twenty years before he published his results, a statement
that would place the origin of his ideas about 1594. He evidently had
been thinking of the sequences, which had been published now and then,
of successive powers of a given number—as in Stifel’s Arithmetica
Integra fifty years earlier and as in the works of Archimedes. In such
sequences, it was obvious that sums and differences of indices of the
powers corresponded to products and quotients of the powers themselves,
but a sequence of integral powers of a base, such as two, could not be
used for computational purposes because the large gaps between
successive terms made interpolation too inaccurate. While Napier was
pondering the matter, Dr. John Craig, a physician to James VI of
Scotland, called on him and told him of prosthaphaeresis being used in
Tycho Brahe’s observatory in Denmark. Word of this encouraged Napier to
redouble his efforts and ultimately to publish in 1614 the Mirifici
Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (A Description of the Marvelous Rule of
Logarithms).</p>
<p>The key to Napier’s work can be explained very simply. To keep the
terms in a geometric progression of integral powers of a given number
close together, it is necessary to take as the given number something
quite close to 1. Napier therefore chose to use 1 − 10−7 (or .9999999)
as his given number. Now the terms in the progression of increasing
powers are indeed close together—too close, in fact. To achieve a
balance and to avoid decimals, Napier multiplied each power by 107. That
is, if N = 107(1−1/107)L, then L is Napier’s “logarithm” of the number
N. Thus, his logarithm of 107 is 0, his logarithm of 107(1−1/107) =
9999999 is 1, and so on. If his numbers and his logarithms were to be
divided by 107, one would virtually have a system of logarithms to the
base 1/e, for is close to . It must be remembered, however, that Napier
had no concept of a base for a system of logarithms, for his definition
was different from ours. The principles of his work were explained in
geometric terms as follows. Let a line segment AB and a half line or ray
CDE . . . be given (Fig. 14.1). Let a point P start from A and move
along AB with variable speed decreasing in proportion to its distance
from B; during the same time, let a point Q start from C and move along
CDE . . . with uniform speed equal to the rate with which point P began
its motion. Napier called this variable distance CQ the logarithm of the
distance PB.</p>
<p>FIG. 14.1</p>
<p>Napier’s geometric definition is, of course, in agreement with the
numerical description given earlier. To show this, let PB = x and CQ =
y. If AB is taken as 107, and if the initial speed of P is also taken as
107, then in modern calculus notations we have dx/dt = −x and dy/dt =
107, x0 = 107, y0 = 0. Then, dy/dx = −107/x, or y = −107 ln cx, where c
is found from the initial boundary conditions to be 10−7. Hence, y =
−107 ln (x/l07) or y/107 = log1/e(x/107). That is, if the distances PB
and CQ were divided by 107, Napier’s definition would lead precisely to
a system of logarithms to the base 1/e, as mentioned earlier. Needless
to say, Napier built up his tables numerically, rather than
geometrically, as the word “logarithm,” which he coined, implies. At
first, he called his power indices “artificial numbers,” but later he
made up the compound of the two Greek words Logos (or ratio) and
arithmos (or number).</p>
<p>Napier did not think of a base for his system, but his tables
nevertheless were compiled through repeated multiplications, equivalent
to powers of .9999999. Obviously, the power (or number) decreases as the
index (or logarithm) increases. This is to be expected, because he was
essentially using a base 1/e, which is less than 1. A more striking
difference between his logarithms and ours lies in the fact that his
logarithm of a product (or a quotient) generally was not equal to the
sum (or difference) of the logarithms. If L1 = Log N1 and L2 = Log N2,
then and , whence so that the sum of Napier’s logarithms will be the
logarithm not of N1N2 but of N1N2/107. Similar modifications hold, of
course, for logarithms of quotients, powers, and roots. If L = Log N,
for instance, then nL = Log Nn/107(n−1). These differences are not too
significant, for they merely involve shifting a decimal point. That
Napier was thoroughly familiar with rules for products and powers is
seen in his remark that all numbers (he called them “sines”) in the
ratio of 2 to 1 have differences of 6,931,469.22 in logarithms, and all
of those in the proportion of 10 to 1 have differences of 23,025,842.34
in logarithms. In these differences we see, if we shift the decimal
point, the natural logarithms of the numbers 2 and 10. Hence, it is not
unreasonable to use the name “Napierian” for natural logarithms, even
though these logarithms are not strictly the ones that Napier had in
mind.</p>
<p>The concept of the logarithmic function is implied in Napier’s
definition and in all of his work with logarithms, but this relationship
was not uppermost in his mind. He had laboriously built up his system
for one purpose—the simplification of computations, especially of
products and quotients. Moreover, that he had trigonometric computations
in view is made clear by the fact that what we, for simplification of
exposition, referred to as Napier’s logarithm of a number, he actually
called the logarithm of a sine. In Fig. 14.1, the line CQ was called the
logarithm of the sine PB. This makes no real difference either in theory
or in practice.</p>
<p>Henry Briggs</p>
<p>The publication in 1614 of the system of logarithms was greeted with
prompt recognition, and among the most enthusiastic admirers was Henry
Briggs, the first Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford and the first
Gresham College professor of geometry. In 1615, he visited Napier at his
home in Scotland, and there they discussed possible modifications in the
method of logarithms. Briggs proposed that powers of 10 should be used,
and Napier said he had thought of this and was in agreement. Napier at
one time had proposed a table using log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 1010 (to
avoid fractions). The two men finally concluded that the logarithm of 1
should be zero and that the logarithm of 10 should be 1. Napier,
however, no longer had the energy to put their ideas into practice. He
died in 1617, the year in which his Rhabdologia, with its description of
his rods, appeared. The second of his classic treatises on logarithms,
the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio, in which he gave a full
account of the methods he used in building up his tables, appeared
posthumously in 1619. To Briggs, therefore, fell the task of making up
the first table of common, or Briggsian, logarithms. Instead of taking
powers of a number close to 1, as had Napier, Briggs began with log 10 =
1 and then found other logarithms by taking successive roots. By finding
, for example, Briggs had log 3.162277 = .5000000, and from he had log
5.623413 = .7500000. Continuing in this manner, he computed other common
logarithms. In the year of Napier’s death, 1617, Briggs published his
Logarithmorum chilias prima—that is, the logarithms of numbers from 1 to
1,000, each carried out to fourteen places. In 1624, in Arithmetica
logarithmica, Briggs extended the table to include common logarithms of
numbers from 1 to 20,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000, again to fourteen
places. The complete ten-place table of logarithms from 1 to 100,000 was
published three years later by two Dutchmen, the surveyor Ezechiel
DeDecker and the book publisher Adriaan Vlacq; with added corrections,
it remained the standard for more than three centuries. Work with
logarithms now could be carried out just as it is today, for all of the
usual laws of logarithms applied in connection with Briggs’s tables.
Incidentally, it is from Briggs’s book of 1624 that our words “mantissa”
and “characteristic” are derived. While Briggs was working out tables of
common logarithms, a contemporary mathematics teacher, John Speidell,
drew up natural logarithms of trigonometric functions and published
these in his New Logarithmes of 1619. A few natural logarithms had, in
fact, appeared earlier in 1616 in an English translation by Edward
Wright (1559–1615) of Napier’s first work on logarithms designed for the
use of navigators. Seldom has a new discovery “caught on” so rapidly as
did the invention of logarithms, and the result was the prompt
appearance of tables of logarithms.</p>
<p>Jobst Bürgi</p>
<p>Napier was the first one to publish a work on logarithms, but very
similar ideas were developed independently in Switzerland by Jobst Bürgi
at about the same time. In fact, it is possible that the idea of
logarithms had occurred to Bürgi as early as 1588, which would be half a
dozen years before Napier began work in the same direction. Yet Bürgi
printed his results only in 1620, half a dozen years after Napier had
published his Descriptio. Bürgi’s work appeared at Prague in a book
titled Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen, and this
indicates that the influences leading to his work were similar to those
operating in the case of Napier. The differences between the work of the
two men lie chiefly in their terminology and in the numerical values
they used; the fundamental principles were the same. Instead of
proceeding from a number a little less than 1 (as had Napier, who used 1
− 10−7), Bürgi chose a number a little greater than 1—the number 1 +
10−4, and instead of multiplying powers of this number by 107, Bürgi
multiplied by 108. There was one other minor difference: Bürgi
multiplied all of his power indices by 10 in his tabulation. That is, if
N = 108(1 + 10−4)L, Bürgi called 10L the “red” number corresponding to
the “black” number N. If in this scheme we were to divide all of the
black numbers by 108 and all of the red numbers by 105, we should
virtually have a system of natural logarithms. For instance, Bürgi gave
for the black number 1,000,000,000 the red number 230,270.022, which, on
shifting decimal points, is equivalent to saying that ln 10 =
2.30270022. This is not a bad approximation to the modern value,
especially when we recall that is not quite the same as , although the
values agree to four significant figures.</p>
<p>Bürgi must be regarded as an independent discoverer who lost credit
for the invention because of Napier’s priority in publication. In one
respect, his logarithms come closer to ours than do Napier’s, for as
Bürgi’s black numbers increase, so do the red numbers, but the two
systems share the disadvantage that the logarithm of a product or a
quotient is not the sum or the difference of the logarithms.</p>
<p>Mathematical Instruments</p>
<p>The invention of logarithms, as well as the spreading use of decimal
fractions, is closely linked to seventeenth-century efforts to invent
mathematical instruments that would facilitate computation. Three groups
of devices merit our attention: those leading to the computing sector of
the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries: the Gunters scale and
early slide rules, and the first mechanical adding and calculating
machines.</p>
<p>Computing Sectors</p>
<p>The first group of instruments originated with Thomas Hood and
Galileo Galilei. Galileo had originally intended to take a degree in
medicine, but a taste for Euclid and Archimedes led him instead to
become a professor of mathematics, first at Pisa and later at Padua.
This does not mean, however, that he taught on the level of the authors
he admired. Little mathematics was included in university curricula of
the time, and a large proportion of what was taught in Galileo’s courses
would now be classified as physics or astronomy or engineering
applications. Moreover, Galileo was not a “mathematician’s
mathematician,” as was Viète; he came close to being what we should call
a mathematical practitioner. Among his first inventions that may be
called special-purpose computing devices was a pulse measuring device.
His interest in computational techniques led him in 1597 to construct
and market a better-known device that he called his “geometric and
military compasses.”</p>
<p>In a pamphlet of 1606 with the title Le operazioni del compasso
geometrico et militare, he described in detail the way in which the
geometric and military compass could be used to quickly perform a
variety of computations, without pen or paper or an abacus. The theory
behind this was extremely elementary, and the degree of accuracy was
very limited, but the financial success of Galileo’s device shows that
military engineers and other practitioners found a need for such an aid
in calculation. Bürgi had constructed a similar device, but Galileo had
a better entrepreneurial sense, one that gave him an advantage. The
Galilean compasses consisted of two arms pivoted as in the ordinary
compasses of today, but each of the arms was engraved with graduated
scales of varying types. Fig. 14.2 shows a reduced version with only one
arithmetic scale, the simple equi-spaced markings up to 250, and only
the simplest of the many possible computations, the first one explained
by Galileo, is described here. If, for instance, one wishes to divide a
given line segment into five equal parts, one opens a pair of ordinary
compasses (or dividers) to the length of the line segment. Then, one
opens the geometric compasses so that the distance between the points of
the dividers just spans the distance between two markings, one on each
arm of the geometric compasses, which are simple integral multiples of
five, say, the number 200 on each scale. Then, if one holds the opening
of the geometric compasses fixed and places the ends of the dividers on
the mark for 40 on each scale, the distance between the divider points
will be the desired fifth of the length of the original line segment.
The instructions Galileo provided with his compasses included many other
operations, from changing the scale of a drawing to computing amounts of
money under compound interest.</p>

<p>Gunters Scale and Slide Rules</p>
<p>It was Edmund Gunter (1581–1626), a graduate of Christ Church,
Oxford, and the rector of two churches, who invented a widely used
computing device and the precursor of the logarithmic slide rule. A
friend of Henry Briggs’s and a frequent visitor of Briggs at Gresham
College, he was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham in 1620.
Shortly thereafter, he published a Description and Use of the Sector,
the Crosse-staffe and Other Instruments. Here he described what came to
be known as “the gunter” or Gunters scale, consisting of a 2-foot-long
logarithmic scale used with a pair of dividers. This and his other
contributions to mathematical instrumentation were motivated by his
interest in assisting sailors, surveyors, and others not skilled in
multiplication and other mathematical computational techniques. Other
devices that bear his name include the surveyor’s Gunters chain, a
portable chain 66 feet long consisting of 100 links (note that 1 acre is
43,560 or 66 × 66 × 10 square feet). He also contributed to navigation
by his studies of magnetic declination and his observation of the
secular variation.</p>
<p>In 1624, Edmund Wingate displayed a Gunters scale to a group of
scientists and engineers in Paris. This resulted in a French description
of the device being published that same year. Wingate called it a rule
of proportion, and the French description indicated that it included
four lines: a line of numbers; a line of tangents; a line of sines; and
two 1-foot lines, one divided into inches and tenths of inches, the
other into tenths and hundredths.</p>
<p>A major drawback of the device was its length. By midcentury, Wingate
had circumvented this by splitting the scales, adding additional ones,
and using both sides of the rule. A number of other British innovators
brought out improvements on the rule as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the early 1630s, several slide rules were publicized.
William Oughtred (1574–1660) invented a circular and a linear slide
rule. To do away with the dividers, he used two Gunter rules. Another
early deviser of slide rules was Richard Delamain, who claimed priority
over Oughtred’s invention by virtue of an earlier publication.</p>
<p>The interest aroused by the inventions, as well as the ensuing
priority disputes, led to the slide rule rapidly becoming a standard
accessory for people in occupations that involved computation on a
regular basis. Although the mathematical principles remained those
linked to the discoveries of the early seventeenth century, the form of
the slide rule best known in the twentieth century followed the 1850
design of the French army officer Amédée Mannheim (1831–1906), who had a
long affiliation with the École Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Adding and Calculating Machines</p>
<p>Mechanical adding and calculating machines also appeared in the
seventeenth century. Their history was the converse of that of computing
scales and slide rules. Here, there were no new mathematical principles,
as was true in the case of the devices that used the concept of
logarithms. Yet their acceptance was long delayed, largely because of
more complex construction requirements and higher costs. We mention the
three best known. Wilhelm Schickard (1592–1635), a Lutheran minister who
held academic positions as professor of Hebrew and, later, as professor
of mathematics and astronomy, was a correspondent of Kepler’s who used
Schickard’s talents as an engraver and arithmetician. Schickard produced
several designs of a mechanical device; the only one constructed at the
time was destroyed in a fire. Blaise Pascal designed an adding machine
to assist his father in tax and commercial computations, but although he
had several of his machines produced for sale and some have even turned
up in China, production was stopped after about ten years. Leibniz,
whose teacher Erhard Weigel had used an open meadow to drill multitudes
of adults in their multiplication tables, used the principle of a
movable carriage to emulate the concept of the carry in multiplication,
but his attempts to interest members of the leading scientific societies
in his machine were unsuccessful. The calculating machine industry did
not get off the ground until the nineteenth century, when Charles X.
Thomas of Colmar produced his so-called arithmometer, a stepped-drum,
movable-carriage machine.</p>

<p>Tables</p>
<p>The application of logarithms was most notably successful in the
construction and use of mathematical tables. From the seventeenth
century, when the first logarithmic tables appeared, to the end of the
twentieth, when electronic devices replaced most other aids to
computation, tables were in the pockets and on the desks of men, women,
and children. Until the electronic computer became established, the
chief computing journal was called Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to
Computation.</p>
<p>Henry Briggs had already produced tables before he became aware of
Napier’s logarithms. In 1602, he had published “A Table to Find the
Height of the Pole, the Magnetic Declination Being Given,” and in 1610,
“Tables for the Improvement of Navigation.” After Briggs and Napier
first met, they frequently discussed tables of logarithms. We noted
earlier Briggs’s first publication on the subject of 1617 and his
subsequent Arithmetica Logarithmica. A posthumous English version,
titled Trigonometria Britannica, was issued by Gellibrand in 1633. In
1924, the tercentenary of Briggs’s Arithmetica Logarithmica, the first
part of a table to 20 decimal places appeared.</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1620, Gunter, too, had published seven-figure tables of
logarithms of sines and tangents in Canon Triangulorum, or Table of
Artificial Sines and Tangents. Most subsequent tables of logarithmic
trigonometric functions did not exceed this number of decimal places,
although in 1911, Andoyer in Paris published a table to 14 decimal
places with differences for every ten sexagesimal seconds. By that time,
table computation had been mechanized. In the 1820s, Charles Babbage had
designed a “difference engine,” a machine designed to eliminate errors
in table computation by applying the method of differences, performing
simultaneous additions, and printing the results. The first successfully
operating difference engine was designed by the Swedes Georg and his son
Edvard Scheutz and performed a variety of specialized table computations
at the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York, in the late 1850s.</p>

Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<p>Infinitesimal Methods: Stevin</p>
<p>Being practical men, Stevin, Kepler, and Galileo all had need for
Archimedean methods, but they wished to avoid the logical niceties of
the method of exhaustion. It was largely the resulting modifications of
the ancient infinitesimal methods that ultimately led to the calculus,
and Stevin was one of the first to suggest changes. In his Statics of
1586, almost exactly a century before Newton and Leibniz published their
calculus, the engineer of Bruges demonstrated as follows that the center
of gravity of a triangle lies on its median. In the triangle ABC
inscribe a number of parallelograms of equal height whose sides are
pairwise parallel to one side and to the median drawn to this side (Fig.
14.3). The center of gravity of the inscribed figures will lie on the
median, by the Archimedean principle that bilaterally symmetrical
figures are in equilibrium. We may inscribe in the triangle an infinite
number of such parallelograms, however, and the greater the number of
parallelograms, the smaller will be the difference between the inscribed
figure and the triangle. Inasmuch as the difference can be made as small
as one pleases, the center of gravity of the triangle also lies on the
median. In some of the propositions on fluid pressure, Stevin
supplemented this geometric approach with a “demonstration by numbers,”
in which a sequence of numbers tended to a limiting value, but the
“Dutch Archimedes” had more confidence in a geometric proof than in an
arithmetic one.</p>
<p>FIG. 14.3</p>
<p>Johannes Kepler</p>
<p>Whereas Stevin was interested in physical applications of infinitely
many infinitely small elements, Kepler had need for astronomical
applications, especially in connection with his elliptic orbits of 1609.
As early as 1604, Kepler had become involved with conic sections through
work in optics and the properties of parabolic mirrors. Whereas
Apollonius had been inclined to think of the conics as three distinct
types of curves—ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—Kepler preferred to
think of five species of conics, all belonging to a single family or
genus. With a strong imagination and a Pythagorean feeling for
mathematical harmony, in 1604 Kepler developed for conics (in his Ad
Vitellionem Paralipomena—i.e., Introduction to Vitello’s Optics) what we
call the principle of continuity. From the conic section made up simply
of two intersecting lines, in which the two foci coincide at the point
of intersection, we pass gradually through infinitely many hyperbolas as
one focus moves farther and farther from the other. When the one focus
is infinitely far away, we no longer have the double-branched hyperbola
but the parabola. As the moving focus passes beyond infinity and
approaches again from the other side, we pass through infinitely many
ellipses until, when the foci again coincide, we reach the circle.</p>
<p>The idea that a parabola has two foci, one at infinity, is due to
Kepler, as is also the word “focus” (Latin for “hearthside”); we find
this bold and fruitful speculation on “points at infinity” extended a
generation later in the geometry of Girard Desargues. Meanwhile, Kepler
found a useful approach to the problem of the infinitely small in
astronomy. In his Astronomia nova of 1609, he announced his first two
laws of astronomy: (1) the planets move about the sun in elliptical
orbits with the sun at one focus, and (2) the radius vector joining a
planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</p>
<p>Johannes Kepler</p>
<p>In handling problems of areas such as these, Kepler thought of the
area as made up of infinitely small triangles with one vertex at the sun
and the other two vertices at points infinitely close together along the
orbit. In this way, he was able to use a crude type of integral calculus
resembling that of Oresme. The area of a circle, for example, is thereby
found by noting that the altitudes of the infinitely thin triangles
(Fig. 14.4) are equal to the radius. If we call the infinitely small
bases, lying along the circumference, b1, b2, . . . , bn, . . . , then
the area of the circle—that is, the sum of the areas of the
triangles—will be or . Inasmuch as the sum of the b’s is the
circumference C, the area A will be given by , the well-known ancient
theorem that Archimedes had proved more carefully.</p>
<p>FIG. 14.4</p>
<p>By analogous reasoning, Kepler knew the area of the ellipse, a result
of Archimedes’ that was not then extant. The ellipse can be obtained
from a circle of radius a through a transformation under which the
ordinate of the circle at each point is shortened according to a given
ratio, say b:a. Then, following Oresme, one can think of the area of the
ellipse and the area of the circle as made up of all of the ordinates
for points on the curves (Fig. 14.5), but inasmuch as the ratio of the
components of the areas is in the ratio b: a, the areas themselves must
have the same ratio. Yet the area of the circle is known to be πa2;
hence, the area of the ellipse x2/a2 + y2/b2 = 1 must be πab. This
result is correct, but the best that Kepler could do for the
circumference of the ellipse was to give the approximate formula π(a +
b). Lengths of curves in general and of the ellipse in particular were
to elude mathematicians for another half a century.</p>
<p>FIG. 14.5</p>
<p>Kepler had worked with Tycho Brahe first in Denmark and later in
Prague, where, following Brahe’s death, Kepler became mathematician to
the emperor Rudolph II. One of his duties was the casting of horoscopes.
Mathematicians, whether in the service of emperors or at universities,
found various applications for their talents. The year 1612 had been a
very good one for wine, and, while Kepler was in Linz, in Austria, he
began to meditate on the crude methods then in use for estimating the
volumes of wine casks. He compared these with Archimedes’ methods on the
volumes of conoids and spheroids, and then he proceeded to find the
volumes of various solids of revolution not previously considered by
Archimedes. For example, he revolved a segment of a circle about its
chord, calling the result a citron if the segment was less than a
semicircle and an apple if the segment exceeded a semicircle. His
volumetric method consisted of regarding the solids as composed of
infinitely many infinitesimal elements, and he proceeded much as we have
indicated earlier for areas. He dispensed with the Archimedean double
reductio ad absurdum, and in this, he was followed by most
mathematicians from that time to the present.</p>
<p>Kepler collected his volumetric thoughts in a book that appeared in
1615 under the title Stereometria Doliorum (Volume-Measurement of
Barrels). For a score of years, it seemed to have excited no great
interest, but in 1635, the Keplerian ideas were systematically expanded
in a celebrated book titled Geometria Indivisibilibus, written by
Bonaventura Cavalieri, a disciple of Galileo’s.</p>
