<h4 id="hippias-of-elis">Hippias of Elis</h4>
<p>Toward the end of the fifth century BCE, a group of professional
teachers quite unlike the Pythagoreans flourished in Athens. Disciples
of Pythagoras had been forbidden to accept payment for sharing their
knowledge with others. The Sophists, however, openly supported
themselves by tutoring fellow citizens—not only in honest intellectual
endeavor, but also in the art of “making the worse appear the better.”
To a certain extent, the accusation of shallowness directed against the
Sophists was warranted, but this should not conceal the fact that
Sophists were usually very broadly informed in many fields and that some
of them made real contributions to learning. Among these was Hippias, a
native of Elis who was active in Athens in the second half of the fifth
century BCE. He is one of the earliest mathematicians of whom we have
firsthand information, for we learn much about him from Plato’s
dialogues. We read, for example, that Hippias boasted that he had made
more money than any two other Sophists. He is said to have written much,
from mathematics to oratory, but none of his work has survived. He had a
remarkable memory, he boasted immense learning, and he was skilled in
handicrafts. To this Hippias (there are many others in Greece who bore
the same name), we apparently owe the introduction into mathematics of
the first curve beyond the circle and the straight line; Proclus and
other commentators ascribe to him the curve since known as the
trisectrix or quadratrix of Hippias. This is drawn as follows: In the
square ABCD (Fig. 4.9), let side AB move down uniformly from its present
position until it coincides with DC, and let this motion take place in
exactly the same time that side DA rotates clockwise from its present
position until it coincides with DC. If the positions of the two moving
lines at any given time are given by AuBu and DAv, respectively, and if
P is the point of intersection of AuBu and DAv, the locus of P during
the motions will be the trisectrix of Hippias—curve APQ in the figure.
Given this curve, the trisection of an angle is carried out with ease.
For example, if PDC is the angle to be trisected, one simply trisects
segments BuC and AuD at points R, S, T, and U. If lines TR and US cut
the trisectrix in V and W, respectively, lines VD and WD will, by the
property of the trisectrix, divide angle PDC in three equal parts.</p>
<p>P hilolaus and Arc hy t a s of Tar entum</p>
<p>The curve of Hippias is generally known as the quadratrix, because it
can be used to square the circle. Whether Hippias himself was aware of
this application cannot now be determined. It has been conjectured that
Hippias knew of this method of quadrature but that he was unable to
justify it. Since the quadrature through Hippias’s curve was
specifically given later by Dinostratus, we shall describe this work
below.</p>
<p>Hippias lived at least as late as Socrates (d. 399 BCE), and from the
pen of Plato we have an unflattering account of him as a typical
Sophist— vain, boastful, and acquisitive. Socrates is reported to have
described Hippias as handsome and learned but boastful and shallow.
Plato’s dialogue on Hippias satirizes his show of knowledge, and
Xenophon’s Memorabilia includes an unflattering account of Hippias as
one who regarded himself an expert in everything from history and
literature to handicrafts and science. In judging such accounts,
however, we must remember that Plato and Xenophon were uncompromisingly
opposed to the Sophists in general. It is also well to bear in mind that
both Protagoras, the “founding father of the Sophists,” and Socrates,
the arch opponent of the movement, were antagonistic to mathematics and
the sciences. With respect to character, Plato contrasts Hippias with
Socrates, but one can bring out much the same contrast by comparing
Hippias with another contemporary—the Pythagorean mathematician Archytas
of Tarentum.</p>
