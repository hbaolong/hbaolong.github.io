<h4 id="frans-van-schooten">Frans van Schooten</h4>
<p>We have already noted that Descartes had spent a score of years in
Holland, and his mathematical influence was decisive, in that analytic
geometry took root there more quickly than elsewhere in Europe. At
Leyden in 1646, Frans van Schooten (1615 1660) had succeeded his father
as professor of mathematics, and it was chiefly through the younger Van
Schooten and his pupils that the rapid development of Cartesian geometry
took place. Descartes’ La ge´ome´trie had not originally been published
in Latin, the universal language of scholars, and the exposition had
been far from clear; both of these handicaps were overcome when Van
Schooten printed a Latin version in 1649, together with supplementary
material. Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes (Geometry by
Rene´ Descartes) appeared in a greatly expanded two-volume version in
1659 1661, and additional editions were published in 1683 and 1695.
Thus, it is probably not too much to say that although analytic geometry
was introduced by Descartes, it was established by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>The need for explanatory introductions to Cartesian geometry had been
recognized so promptly that an anonymous “Introduction” to it had been
composed but not published by a “Dutch gentleman” within a year of its
appearance. In another year, Descartes received and approved a more
extensive commentary on the Geometry, this one by Florimond Debeaune
under the title Notae Breves. The ideas of Descartes were here
explained, with greater emphasis on loci represented by simple
second-degree equations, much in the manner of Fermat’s Isagoge.
Debeaune showed, for example, that y2 5xy1bx, y2 522dy1bx, and y2 5bx2x2
represent hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipses, respectively. This work
by Debeaune
receivedwidepublicitythroughitsinclusioninthe1649Latintranslationof the
Geometria, together with further commentary by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>Jan deWitt</p>
<p>A more extensive contribution to analytic geometry was composed in
1658 by one of Van Schooten’s associates, Jan De Witt (1629 1672), the
well-known Grand Pensionary of Holland. De Witt had studied law at
Leyden, but he had acquired a taste for mathematics while living in Van
Schooten’s house. He led a hectic life while directing the affairs of
the United Provinces through periods of war in which he opposed the
designs of Louis XIV. When in 1672 the French invaded the Netherlands,
De Witt was dismissed from office by the Orange Party and seized by an
infuriated mob that tore him to pieces. Although he had been a man of
action, he had found the time in his earlier years to compose a work
titled Elementa Curvarum. This is divided into two parts, the first of
which gives various kinematic and planimetric definitions of the conic
sections. Among these are the focus-directrix ratio definitions; our
word “directrix” is due to him. Another construction of the ellipse that
he gave is through the now familiar use of two concentric circles with
the eccentric angle as parameter. Here the treatment is largely
synthetic, but Book II, by contrast, makes such systematic use of
coordinates that it has been described, with some justification, as the
first textbook on analytic geometry. The purpose of De Witt’s work is to
reduce all second-degree equations in x and y to canonical form through
translation and rotation of axes. He knew how to recognize when such an
equation represented an ellipse, when a parabola, and when a hyperbola,
based on whether the so-called discriminant is negative, zero, or
positive.</p>
<p>Only a year before his tragic death, De Witt combined the aims of the
statesman with the views of a mathematician in his A Treatise on Life
Annuities (1671), motivated perhaps by the little essay by Huygens on
probabilities. In this Treatise, De Witt expressed what now would be
described as the notion of mathematical expectation, and in his
correspondence with Hudde, he considered the problem of an annuity based
on the last survivor of two or more people.</p>
