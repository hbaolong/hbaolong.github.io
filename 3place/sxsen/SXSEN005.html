<p>Did you bring me a man who cannot number his fingers?</p>
<p>—From the Egyptian Book of the Dead</p>
<p>Concepts and Relationships</p>
<p>Contemporary mathematicians formulate statements about abstract
concepts that are subject to verification by proof. For centuries,
mathematics was considered to be the science of numbers, magnitudes, and
forms. For that reason, those who seek early examples of mathematical
activity will point to archaeological remnants that reflect human
awareness of operations on numbers, counting, or “geometric” patterns
and shapes. Even when these vestiges reflect mathematical activity, they
rarely evidence much historical significance. They may be interesting
when they show that peoples in different parts of the world conducted
certain actions dealing with concepts that have been considered
mathematical. For such an action to assume historical significance,
however, we look for relationships that indicate this action was known
to another individual or group that engaged in a related action. Once
such a connection has been established, the door is open to more
specifically historical studies, such as those dealing with
transmission, tradition, and conceptual change.</p>
<p>Mathematical vestiges are often found in the domain of nonliterate
cultures, making the evaluation of their significance even more complex.
Rules of operation may exist as part of an oral tradition, often in
musical or verse form, or they may be clad in the language of magic or
ritual. Sometimes they are found in observations of animal behavior,
removing them even further from the realm of the historian. While
studies of canine arithmetic or avian geometry belong to the zoologist,
of the impact of brain lesions on number sense to the neurologist, and
of numerical healing incantations to the anthropologist, all of these
studies may prove to be useful to the historian of mathematics without
being an overt part of that history.</p>
<p>At first, the notions of number, magnitude, and form may have been
related to contrasts rather than likenesses—the difference between one
wolf and many, the inequality in size of a minnow and a whale, the
unlikeness of the roundness of the moon and the straightness of a pine
tree. Gradually, there may have arisen, out of the welter of chaotic
experiences, the realization that there are samenesses, and from this
awareness of similarities in number and form both science and
mathematics were born. The differences themselves seem to point to
likenesses, for the contrast between one wolf and many, between one
sheep and a herd, between one tree and a forest suggests that one wolf,
one sheep, and one tree have something in common—their uniqueness. In
the same way it would be noticed that certain other groups, such as
pairs, can be put into one-to-one correspondence. The hands can be
matched against the feet, the eyes, the ears, or the nostrils. This
recognition of an abstract property that certain groups hold in common,
and that we call “number,” represents a long step toward modern
mathematics. It is unlikely to have been the discovery of any one
individual or any single tribe; it was more probably a gradual awareness
that may have developed as early in man’s cultural development as the
use of fire, possibly some 300,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That the development of the number concept was a long and gradual
process is suggested by the fact that some languages, including Greek,
have preserved in their grammar a tripartite distinction between 1 and 2
and more than 2, whereas most languages today make only the dual
distinction in “number” between singular and plural. Evidently, our very
early ancestors at first counted only to 2, and any set beyond this
level was designated as “many.” Even today, many people still count
objects by arranging them into sets of two each.</p>
<p>The awareness of number ultimately became sufficiently extended and
vivid so that a need was felt to express the property in some way,
presumably at first in sign language only. The fingers on a hand can be
readily used to indicate a set of two or three or four or five objects,
the number 1 generally not being recognized at first as a true “number.”
By the use of the fingers on both hands, collections containing up to
ten elements could be represented; by combining fingers and toes, one
could count as high as 20. When the human digits were inadequate, heaps
of stones or knotted strings could be used to represent a correspondence
with the elements of another set. Where nonliterate peoples used such a
scheme of representation, they often piled the stones in groups of five,
for they had become familiar with quintuples through observation of the
human hand and foot. As Aristotle noted long ago, the widespread use
today of the decimal system is but the result of the anatomical accident
that most of us are born with ten fingers and ten toes.</p>
<p>Groups of stones are too ephemeral for the preservation of
information; hence, prehistoric man sometimes made a number record by
cutting notches in a stick or a piece of bone. Few of these records
remain today, but in Moravia a bone from a young wolf was found that is
deeply incised with fifty-five notches. These are arranged in two
series, with twenty-five in the first and thirty in the second: within
each series, the notches are arranged in groups of five. It has been
dated as being approximately 30,000 years old. Two other prehistoric
numerical artifacts were found in Africa: a baboon fibula having
twenty-nine notches, dated as being circa 35,000 years old, and the
Ishango bone, with its apparent examples of multiplicative entries,
initially dated as approximately 8,000 years old but now estimated to be
as much as 30,000 years old as well. Such archaeological discoveries
provide evidence that the idea of number is far older than previously
acknowledged.</p>
<p>Early Number Bases</p>
<p>Historically, finger counting, or the practice of counting by fives
and tens, seems to have come later than counter-casting by twos and
threes, yet the quinary and decimal systems almost invariably displaced
the binary and ternary schemes. A study of several hundred tribes among
the American Indians, for example, showed that almost one-third used a
decimal base, and about another third had adopted a quinary or a
quinary-decimal system; fewer than a third had a binary scheme, and
those using a ternary system constituted less than 1 percent of the
group. The vigesimal system, with the number 20 as a base, occurred in
about 10 percent of the tribes.</p>
<p>An interesting example of a vigesimal system is that used by the Maya
of Yucatan and Central America. This was deciphered some time before the
rest of the Maya languages could be translated. In their representation
of time intervals between dates in their calendar, the Maya used a place
value numeration, generally with 20 as the primary base and with 5 as an
auxiliary. (See the following illustration.) Units were represented by
dots and fives by horizontal bars, so that the number 17, for example,
would appear as (that is, as 3(5) + 2). A vertical positional
arrangement was used, with the larger units of time above; hence, the
notation denoted 352 (that is, 17(20) + 12). Because the system was
primarily for counting days within a calendar that had 360 days in a
year, the third position usually did not represent multiples of
(20)(20), as in a pure vigesimal system, but (18)(20). Beyond this
point, however, the base 20 again prevailed. Within this positional
notation, the Maya indicated missing positions through the use of a
symbol, which appeared in variant forms, somewhat resembling a half-open
eye. In their scheme, then, the notation denoted 17(20 · 18 · 20) + 0(18
· 20) + 13(20) + 0.</p>
<p>From the Dresden Codex of the Maya, displaying numbers. The second
column on the left, reading down from above, displays the numbers 9, 9,
16, 0, 0, which stand for 9 × 144,000 + 9 × 7,200 + 16 × 360 + 0 + 0 =
1,366,560. In the third column are the numerals 9, 9, 9, 16, 0,
representing 1,364,360. The original appears in black and red. (Taken
from Morley 1915, p. 266.)</p>
<p>Number Language and Counting</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the development of language was
essential to the rise of abstract mathematical thinking. Yet words
expressing numerical ideas were slow in arising. Number signs probably
preceded number words, for it is easier to cut notches in a stick than
it is to establish a well-modulated phrase to identify a number. Had the
problem of language not been so difficult, rivals to the decimal system
might have made greater headway. The base 5, for example, was one of the
earliest to leave behind some tangible written evidence, but by the time
that language became formalized, 10 had gained the upper hand. The
modern languages of today are built almost without exception around the
base 10, so that the number 13, for example, is not described as 3 and 5
and 5, but as 3 and 10. The tardiness in the development of language to
cover abstractions such as number is also seen in the fact that
primitive numerical verbal expressions invariably refer to specific
concrete collections—such as “two fishes” or “two clubs”—and later some
such phrase would be adopted conventionally to indicate all sets of two
objects. The tendency for language to develop from the concrete to the
abstract is seen in many of our present-day measures of length. The
height of a horse is measured in “hands,” and the words “foot” and “ell”
(or elbow) have similarly been derived from parts of the body.</p>
<p>The thousands of years required for man to separate out the abstract
concepts from repeated concrete situations testify to the difficulties
that must have been experienced in laying even a very primitive basis
for mathematics. Moreover, there are a great many unanswered questions
relating to the origins of mathematics. It is usually assumed that the
subject arose in answer to practical needs, but anthropological studies
suggest the possibility of an alternative origin. It has been suggested
that the art of counting arose in connection with primitive religious
ritual and that the ordinal aspect preceded the quantitative concept. In
ceremonial rites depicting creation myths, it was necessary to call the
participants onto the scene in a specific order, and perhaps counting
was invented to take care of this problem. If theories of the ritual
origin of counting are correct, the concept of the ordinal number may
have preceded that of the cardinal number. Moreover, such an origin
would tend to point to the possibility that counting stemmed from a
unique origin, spreading subsequently to other areas of the world. This
view, although far from established, would be in harmony with the ritual
division of the integers into odd and even, the former being regarded as
male, the latter as female. Such distinctions were known to
civilizations in all corners of the earth, and myths regarding the male
and female numbers have been remarkably persistent.</p>
<p>The concept of the whole number is one of the oldest in mathematics,
and its origin is shrouded in the mists of prehistoric antiquity. The
notion of a rational fraction, however, developed relatively late and
was not in general closely related to systems for the integers. Among
nonliterate tribes, there seems to have been virtually no need for
fractions. For quantitative needs, the practical person can choose units
that are sufficiently small to obviate the necessity of using fractions.
Hence, there was no orderly advance from binary to quinary to decimal
fractions, and the dominance of decimal fractions is essentially the
product of the modern age.</p>
<p>Spatial Relationships</p>
<p>Statements about the origins of mathematics, whether of arithmetic or
geometry, are of necessity hazardous, for the beginnings of the subject
are older than the art of writing. It is only during the last half-dozen
millennia, in a passage that may have spanned thousands of millennia,
that human beings have been able to put their records and thoughts into
written form. For data about the prehistoric age, we must depend on
interpretations based on the few surviving artifacts, on evidence
provided by current anthropology, and on a conjectural backward
extrapolation from surviving documents. Neolithic peoples may have had
little leisure and little need for surveying, yet their drawings and
designs suggest a concern for spatial relationships that paved the way
for geometry. Pottery, weaving, and basketry show instances of
congruence and symmetry, which are in essence parts of elementary
geometry, and they appear on every continent. Moreover, simple sequences
in design, such as that in Fig. 1.1, suggest a sort of applied group
theory, as well as propositions in geometry and arithmetic. The design
makes it immediately obvious that the areas of triangles are to one
another as squares on a side, or, through counting, that the sums of
consecutive odd numbers, beginning from unity, are perfect squares. For
the prehistoric period there are no documents; hence, it is impossible
to trace the evolution of mathematics from a specific design to a
familiar theorem. But ideas are like hardy spores, and sometimes the
presumed origin of a concept may be only the reappearance of a much more
ancient idea that had lain dormant.</p>
<p>FIG. 1.1</p>
<p>The concern of prehistoric humans for spatial designs and
relationships may have stemmed from their aesthetic feeling and the
enjoyment of beauty of form, motives that often actuate the
mathematician of today. We would like to think that at least some of the
early geometers pursued their work for the sheer joy of doing
mathematics, rather than as a practical aid in mensuration, but there
are alternative theories. One of these is that geometry, like counting,
had an origin in primitive ritualistic practice. Yet the theory of the
origin of geometry in a secularization of ritualistic practice is by no
means established. The development of geometry may just as well have
been stimulated by the practical needs of construction and surveying or
by an aesthetic feeling for design and order.</p>
<p>We can make conjectures about what led people of the Stone Age to
count, to measure, and to draw. That the beginnings of mathematics are
older than the oldest civilizations is clear. To go further and
categorically identify a specific origin in space or time, however, is
to mistake conjecture for history. It is best to suspend judgment on
this matter and to move on to the safer ground of the history of
mathematics as found in the written documents that have come down to
us.</p>
