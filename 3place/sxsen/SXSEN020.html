16 British Techniques and Continental Methods</h4>
<p>Mathematics—the unshaken Foundation of Sciences, and the plentiful
Fountain of Advantage to human affairs.</p>
<p>—Isaac Barrow</p>
<p>John Wallis</p>
<p>One of the charter members of the Royal Society, John Wallis
(1616–1703) was known among older contemporaries as a brilliant student
of mathematics and among later historians as the most influential
English predecessor of Newton. Wallis, like Oughtred, entered Holy
Orders, yet he spent most of his time as a mathematician. Educated at
Cambridge, he was appointed Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford in
1649, holding the chair that had first been filled by Briggs when it was
established in 1619. Wallis was known to be a Royalist, although the
regime of Cromwell was not averse to using his services in the
deciphering of secret codes, and when Charles II was restored to the
throne, Wallis became the king’s chaplain. Earlier, in 1655, he had
published two very important books, one in analytic geometry, the other
in infinite analysis. These were the two leading branches of mathematics
at the time, and the genius of Wallis was well suited to advance
them.</p>
<p>On Conic Sections</p>
<p>The Tractatus de Sectionibus Conicis of Wallis did for analytic
geometry in England what De Witt’s Elementa Curvarum had done for the
subject on the Continent. Wallis complained, in fact, that De Witt’s
work was an imitation of his own Tractatus, but De Witt’s treatise,
although published four years after that of Wallis, had actually been
composed before 1655. The books of both men may be described as the
completion of the arithmetization of conic sections that had been begun
by Descartes. Wallis, in particular, replaced geometric concepts by
numerical ones wherever possible. Even proportion, the stronghold of
ancient geometry, Wallis held to be an arithmetic concept.</p>
<p>The Conics of Wallis opened by paying lip service to the generation
of the curves as sections of a cone, yet the author deduced all of the
familiar properties through plane coordinate methods from the three
standard forms e2 = ld − ld2/t, p2 = ld, and h2 = ld + ld2/t, where e,
p, and h are the ordinates of the ellipse, the parabola, and the
hyperbola, respectively, corresponding to abscissas d measured from a
vertex at the origin, and where l and t are the latus rectum and
“diameter” or axis. Later still, he took these equations as the
definitions of the conic sections, considered “absolutely,” that is,
without reference to the cone. Here, he was even closer than Fermat to
the modern definition of a conic as the locus of points on a plane
coordinate system whose coordinates satisfy an equation of the second
degree in two variables, a fact that Descartes had been aware of but
that he had not emphasized.</p>
<p>Arithmetica Infinitorum</p>
<p>Had Wallis’s Conics not appeared, the loss would not have been
serious, for De Witt’s work appeared only four years later. Yet there
was no substitute for the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis, which was
also published in 1655. Here, Wallis arithmetized the Geometria
indivisibilibus of Cavalieri, as he had arithmetized the Conics of
Apollonius. Whereas Cavalieri had arrived at the result</p>
<p>through a laborious pairing of geometric indivisibles in a
parallelogram with those in one of the two triangles into which a
diagonal divides it, Wallis abandoned the geometric background after
having associated the infinitely many indivisibles in the figures with
numerical values. If, for example, one wishes to compare the squares of
the indivisibles in the triangle with the squares of the indivisibles in
the parallelogram, one takes the length of the first indivisible in the
triangle as zero, the second as 1, the third as 2, and so on, up to the
last, of length n − 1, if there are n indivisibles. The ratio of the
squares of the indivisibles in the two figures would then be</p>
<p>if there were only two indivisibles in each, or</p>
<p>if there were three, or</p>
<p>if there were four. For n + 1 indivisibles, the result is</p>
<p>and if n is infinite, the ratio obviously is . (For n infinite, the
remainder term l/6n becomes l/∞, or zero. Here, Wallis was the first one
to use the now familiar “love knot” symbol for infinity.) This is, of
course, the equivalent of saying that ; Wallis extended the same
procedure to higher integral powers of x. By incomplete induction, he
concluded that</p>
<p>for all integral values of m.</p>
<p>Fermat rightly criticized Wallis’s induction, for it lacks the rigor
of the method of complete induction that Fermat and Pascal frequently
used. Moreover, Wallis followed a still more questionable principle of
interpolation, under which he assumed that his result also held for
fractional values of m, as well as for negative values (except m = −1).
He even had the hardihood to assume that the formula held for irrational
powers—the earliest statement in the calculus concerning what now would
be called “a higher transcendental function.” The use of exponential
notation for fractional and negative powers was an important
generalization of suggestions made earlier, as by Oresme and Stevin, but
Wallis did not give a sound basis for his extension of the Cartesian
exponentiation.</p>
<p>Wallis was a chauvinistic Englishman, and when he later (in 1685)
published his Treatise of Algebra, Both Historical and Practical, he
belittled the work of Descartes, arguing, very unfairly, that most of it
had been taken from Harriot’s Artis analyticae praxis. The fact that
Wallis’s solutions of the Pascal contest questions had been rejected as
not worthy of the prize evidently did not ameliorate his anti-Gallic
bias. This bias, as well as his casual interpretation of the historical
record, also seems to explain why Wallis, a far better mathematician
than historian, equated algebra (or the analytics of Viète) with the
ancient geometric analysis.</p>
<p>Christopher Wren and William Neil</p>
<p>At the time that Wallis sent in his reply to the Pascal challenge,
Christopher Wren (1632–1723) sent Pascal his rectification of the
cycloid. Wren was educated at Oxford and later held there the Savilian
professorship in astronomy. He, too, was elected to the Royal Society,
of which he was president for a few years. Had not the great fire of
1666 destroyed much of London, Wren might now be known as a
mathematician, rather than as the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral and
some fifty other churches. The mathematical circle to which Wren and
Wallis belonged in 1657–1658 evidently was applying the equivalent of
the formula for arc length ds2 = dx2 + dy2 to various curves and was
meeting with brilliant success. We mentioned earlier that William Neil,
when he was only twenty years old, first succeeded in rectifying his
curve, the semicubical parabola, in 1657. Wren found the length of the
cycloid a year later. The rectification by Neil depended on the
recognition, already noted by Wallis in Arithmetica Infinitorum, that a
small arc is virtually the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides
are the increments in the abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the
equivalent of the modern formula . Both Neil’s and Wren’s discoveries
were incorporated, with due credit to the discoverers, by Wallis in his
Tractatus Duo of 1659, a book on infinitesimal problems related to the
cycloid and the cissoid. This work followed by a few months the work of
Pascal on the cycloid, indicating the extent to which cycloid fever had
seized mathematicians just before the invention of the calculus.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the geometry of surfaces and curves in three
dimensions was then attracting so little attention that almost a century
later, solid analytic geometry was still virtually undeveloped. Wallis,
in his Algebra of 1685, included a study of a surface that belonged to
the class now known as conoids (not, of course, in the Archimedean
sense). Wallis’s surface, which he called the “cono-cuneus” (or conical
wedge), can be described as follows: Let C be a circle, let L be a line
parallel to the plane of C, and let P be a plane perpendicular to L.
Then, the cono-cuneus is the totality of lines that are parallel to P
and pass through points of L and C. Wallis suggested other conoidal
surfaces obtained by replacing the circle C by a conic, and in his
Mechanica of 1670, he had noted the parabolic sections on Wren’s
hyperboloid (or “hyperbolic cylindroid”). Yet Wallis did not give
equations for the surfaces, nor did he arithmetize geometry of three
dimensions, as he had plane geometry.</p>
<p>Wallis’s Formulas</p>
<p>Wallis made his most important contributions in infinitesimal
analysis. Among these was one in which, while evaluating , he
anticipated some of Euler’s work on the gamma or factorial function.
From the work of Cavalieri, Fermat, and others, Wallis knew that this
integral represents the area under the semicircle and that this area
therefore is π/8. But how can one obtain the answer through a direct
evaluation of the integral by infinitesimal devices? Wallis could not
answer this question, but his method of induction and interpolation
produced an interesting result. After an evaluation of for several
positive integral values of n, Wallis arrived by incomplete induction at
the conclusion that the value of this integral is (n!)2/(2n + 1)!
Assuming that the formula holds for fractional values of n as well,
Wallis concluded that</p>
<p>hence, or This is a special case of the Eulerian beta function, where
and .</p>
<p>Among Wallis’s best-known results is the infinite product</p>
<p>This expression can readily be obtained from the modern theorem</p>
<p>and the formulas</p>
<p>for m an odd integer and</p>
<p>for m even. (The symbol m!! represents the product m(m − 2)(m − 4) .
. . , which terminates in 1 or 2, according as m is odd or even.) Hence,
the previous expressions for are known as Wallis’s formulas. Yet the
method that Wallis actually used to achieve his product for 2/π was in
reality again based on his principles of induction and interpolation,
applied this time to , which he was unable to evaluate directly for lack
of the binomial theorem.</p>
<p>James Gregory</p>
<p>The binomial theorem for integral powers had been known in Europe at
least since 1527, but Wallis was unable, surprisingly, to apply his
method of interpolation here. It looks as though this result may have
been known to the young Scotsman James Gregory (1638–1675), a
predecessor of Newton who died when he was only thirty-six. Gregory had
evidently come in contact with the mathematics of several countries. His
great-uncle Alexander Anderson (1582–1620?) had edited Viète’s works,
and James Gregory had studied mathematics not only at school in
Aberdeen, but also with his older brother, David Gregory (1627–1720). A
wealthy patron had introduced him to John Collins (1625–1683), the
librarian of the Royal Society. Collins was to British mathematicians
what Mersenne had been to the French a generation earlier—the
correspondent extraordinary. In 1663, Gregory went to Italy, where the
patron introduced him to the successors of Torricelli, especially
Stefano degli Angeli (1623–1697). The many works of Angeli, a protégé of
Cardinal Michelangelo Ricci (1619–1682) who had been a close friend of
Torricelli’s, were almost all on infinitesimal methods, with emphasis on
the quadrature of generalized spirals, parabolas, and hyperbolas. It is
likely that it was in Italy that Gregory came to appreciate the power of
infinite series expansions of functions and of infinite processes in
general.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Quadratures</p>
<p>In 1667, Gregory published in Padua a work titled Vera circuli et
hyperbolae quadratura, which contained very significant results in
infinitesimal analysis. For one thing, Gregory extended the Archimedean
algorithm to the quadrature of ellipses and hyperbolas. He took an
inscribed triangle of area a0 and a circumscribed quadrilateral of area
A0; by successively doubling the number of sides of these figures, he
formed the sequence a0, A0, a1, A1, a2, A2, a3, A3, . . .and showed that
an is the geometric mean of the two terms immediately preceding and An
the harmonic mean of the two preceding terms. Thus, he had two
sequences—that of the inscribed areas and that of the circumscribed
areas—both converging to the area of the conic; he used these to get
very good approximations to elliptic and hyperbolic sectors.
Incidentally, the word “coverage” was here used by Gregory in this sense
for the first time. Through this infinite process, Gregory sought,
unsuccessfully, to prove the impossibility of squaring the circle by
algebraic means. Huygens, regarded as the leading mathematician of the
day, believed that π could be expressed algebraically, and a dispute
arose over the validity of Gregory’s methods. The question of π’s
transcendence was a difficult one, and it would be another two centuries
before it was resolved in Gregory’s favor.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Series</p>
<p>In 1668, Gregory published two more works, bringing together results
from France, Italy, Holland, and England, as well as new discoveries of
his own. One of these, Geometriae Pars Universalis (The Universal Part
of Geometry), was published in Padua; the other, Exercitationes
Geometricae (Geometrical Exercises), in London. As the title of the
first book implies, Gregory broke from the Cartesian distinction between
“geometrical” and “mechanical” curves. He preferred to divide
mathematics into “general” and “special” groups of theorems, rather than
into algebraic and transcendental functions. Gregory did not wish to
distinguish even between algebraic and geometric methods, and,
consequently, his work appeared in an essentially geometric garb that is
not easy to follow. Had he expressed his work analytically, he might
have anticipated Newton in the invention of the calculus, for virtually
all of the fundamental elements were known to him by the end of 1668. He
was thoroughly familiar with quadratures and rectifications and probably
saw that these are the inverses of tangent problems. He even knew the
equivalent of ∫ secxdx = ln (secx + tanx). He had independently found
the binomial theorem for fractional powers, a result known earlier to
Newton (but as yet unpublished), and he had, through a process
equivalent to successive differentiation, discovered the Taylor series
more than forty years before Taylor published it. The Maclaurin series
for tan x and sec x and for arctan x and arcsec x were all known to him,
but only one of these, the series for arctan x, bears his name. He could
have learned in Italy that the area under the curve y = 1/(1 + x2), from
x = 0 to x = x, is arctan x, and a simple long division converts 1/(1 +
x2) to 1 − x2 + x4 − x6 + ⋯. Hence, it is at once apparent from
Cavalieri’s formula that</p>
<p>This result is still known as “Gregory’s series.”</p>
<p>Nicolaus Mercator and William Brouncker</p>
<p>A result somewhat analogous to Gregory’s series was derived at about
the same time by Nicolaus Mercator (1620–1687) and published in his
Logarithmotechnia of 1668. Mercator (real name Kaufmann) was born in
Holstein in Denmark, but he lived in London for a long time and became
one of the first members of the Royal Society. In 1683, he went to
France and designed the fountains at Versailles; he died in Paris four
years later. The first part of Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia is on the
calculation of logarithms by methods stemming from those of Napier and
Briggs; the second part contains various approximation formulas for
logarithms, one of which is essentially that now known as “Mercator’s
series.” From the work of Gregory of St. Vincent, it had been known that
the area under the hyperbola y = 1/(1 + x), from x = 0 to x = x, is ln(l
+ x). Hence, using James Gregory’s method of long division followed by
integration, we have</p>
<p>Mercator took over from Mengoli the name “natural logarithms” for
values that are derived by means of this series. Although the series
bears Mercator’s name, it appears that it was known earlier to both
Hudde and Newton, although not published by them.</p>
<p>During the 1650s and 1660s, a wide variety of infinite methods were
developed, including the infinite continued fraction method for π that
had been given by William Brouncker (1620?–1684), the first president of
the Royal Society. The first steps in continued fractions had been taken
many years prior to this in Italy, where Pietro Antonio Cataldi
(1548–1626) of Bologna had expressed square roots in this form. Such
expressions are easily obtained as follows: Let be desired and let .
Then, (x + 1)2 = 2 or x2 + 2x = 1 or x = 1/(2 + x). If, on the
right-hand side, one continues to replace x as often as it appears by
1/(2 + x), one finds that</p>
<p>Through manipulation of Wallis’s product for 2/π, Brouncker was led
somehow to the expression</p>
<p>In addition, Brouncker and Gregory found certain infinite series for
logarithms, but these were overshadowed by the greater simplicity of the
Mercator series. It is sad to report, however, that Gregory did not have
an influence commensurate with his achievement. He returned to Scotland
to become a professor of mathematics, first at St. Andrews in 1668 and
then at Edinburgh in 1674, where he became blind and died a year later.
After his three treatises of 1667–1668 had appeared, he no longer
published, and many of his results had to be rediscovered by others.</p>
<p>Barrow’s Method of Tangents</p>
<p>Newton could have learned much from Gregory, but the young Cambridge
student evidently was not well acquainted with the work of the Scot.
Instead, it was two Englishmen, one at Oxford and the other at
Cambridge, who made a deeper impression on him. They were John Wallis
and Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). Barrow, like Wallis, entered Holy Orders
but taught mathematics. A mathematical conservative, Barrow disliked the
formalisms of algebra, and in this respect, his work is antithetical to
that of Wallis. He thought that algebra should be part of logic, rather
than of mathematics. An admirer of the ancients, he edited the works of
Euclid, Apollonius, and Archimedes, besides publishing his own Lectiones
opticae (1669) and Lectiones geometriae (1670), both of which Newton
assisted in editing. The date 1668 is important for the fact that Barrow
was giving his geometric lectures at the same time that Gregory’s
Geometriae Pars Universalis and Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia appeared,
as well as a revised edition of Sluse’s Mesolabum. Sluse’s book included
a new section dealing with infinitesimal problems and containing a
method of maxima and minima. Wishing his Lectiones Geometriae to take
account of the state of the subject at the time, Barrow included an
especially full account of the new discoveries. Tangent problems and
quadratures were all the rage, and they figure prominently in Barrow’s
1670 treatise. Here, Barrow preferred the kinematic views of Torricelli
to the static arithmetic of Wallis, and he liked to think of geometric
magnitudes as generated by a steady flow of points. Time, he said, has
many analogies with a line, yet he viewed both as made up of
indivisibles. Although his reasoning is much more like Cavalieri’s than
like Wallis’s or Fermat’s, there is one point at which algebraic
analysis obtrudes prominently. At the end of Lecture X, Barrow
wrote,</p>
<p>Supplementary to this we add, in the form of appendices, a method for
finding tangents by calculation frequently used by us, although I hardly
know, after so many well-known and well-worn methods of the kind above,
whether there is any advantage in doing so. Yet I do so on the advice of
a friend [later shown to have been Newton]; and all the more willingly
because it seems to be more profitable and general than those which I
have discussed.</p>
<p>Then Barrow went on to explain a method of tangents that is virtually
identical with the one used in the differential calculus. It is much
like that of Fermat, but it makes use of two quantities—instead of
Fermat’s single letter E—quantities that are equivalent to the modern Δx
and Δy. Barrow explained his tangent rule essentially as follows. If M
is a point on a curve given (in modern notation) by a polynomial
equation f(x, y) = 0 and if T is the point of intersection of the
desired tangent MT with the x-axis, then Barrow marked off “an
indefinitely small arc, MN, of the curve.” He then drew the ordinates at
M and N and through M a line MR parallel to the x-axis (Fig. 16.1).
Then, designating by m the known ordinate at M, by t the desired
subtangent PT, and by a and e the vertical and horizontal sides of the
triangle MRN, Barrow pointed out that the ratio of a to e is equal to
the ratio of m to t. As we should now express it, the ratio of a to e
for infinitely close points is the slope of the curve. To find this
ratio, Barrow proceeded much as Fermat had. He replaced x and y in f(x,
y) = 0 with x + e and y + a, respectively; then, in the resulting
equation, he disregarded all terms not containing a or e (because these
by themselves equal zero) and all terms of a degree higher than the
first degree in a and e, and, finally, he replaced a with m and e with
t. From this, the subtangent is found in terms of x and m, and if x and
m are known, the quantity t is determined. Barrow apparently did not
directly know of Fermat’s work, for he nowhere mentioned his name, but
the men to whom he referred as sources of his ideas include Cavalieri,
Huygens, Gregory of St. Vincent, James Gregory, and Wallis, and it may
be that Fermat’s method became known to Barrow through them. Huygens and
James Gregory, in particular, made frequent use of the procedure, and
Newton, with whom Barrow was working, recognized that Barrow’s algorithm
was only an improvement of Fermat’s.</p>
<p>FIG. 16.1</p>
<p>Of all of the mathematicians who anticipated portions of the
differential and the integral calculus, none approached more closely to
the new analysis than Barrow. He seems to have clearly recognized the
inverse relationship between tangent and quadrature problems. But his
conservative adherence to geometric methods evidently kept him from
making effective use of the relationship, and his contemporaries found
his Lectiones geometricae difficult to understand. Fortunately, Barrow
knew that at that very time, Newton himself was working on the same
problems, and the older man entreated his young associate to collect and
publish his own results. In 1669, Barrow was called to London as
chaplain to Charles II, and Newton, on Barrow’s suggestion, succeeded
him in the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. That the succession was most
felicitous will become apparent in the rest of this chapter.</p>
<p>Newton</p>
<p>Isaac Newton was born prematurely on Christmas Day of 1642, the year
of Galileo’s death. A maternal uncle who was a Cambridge graduate
recognized unusual ability in his nephew and persuaded Isaac’s mother to
enter the boy at Cambridge. Young Newton, therefore, enrolled at Trinity
College in 1661, probably with no thought of being a mathematician, for
he had made no particular study of the subject. Early in his first year,
however, he bought and studied a copy of Euclid, and, shortly
thereafter, he read Oughtred’s Clavis, the Van Schooten Geometria a
Renato Des Cartes, Kepler’s Optics, the works of Viète, and, perhaps
most important of all, Wallis’s Arithmetica Infinitorum. Moreover, to
this training we must add the lectures that Barrow gave as Lucasian
professor, which Newton attended, after 1663. Newton also became
acquainted with work of Galileo, Fermat, Huygens, and others.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Newton later wrote to Robert Hooke, “If I have
seen farther than Descartes, it is because I have stood on the shoulders
of giants.”</p>
<p>Early Work</p>
<p>By the end of 1664, Newton seems to have reached the frontiers of
mathematical knowledge and was ready to make contributions of his own.
His first discoveries, dating from the early months of 1665, resulted
from his ability to express functions in terms of infinite series—the
very thing that Gregory was doing in Italy at about that time, although
Newton could scarcely have known of this. In 1665, Newton also began to
think of the rate of change, or fluxion, of continuously varying
quantities, or fluents, such as lengths, areas, volumes, distances, and
temperatures. From that time on, Newton linked together these two
problems—of infinite series and of rates of change—as “my method.”</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton</p>
<p>During much of 1665–1666, immediately after Newton had earned his
A.B. degree, Trinity College was closed because of the plague, and
Newton went home to live and think. The result was the most productive
period of mathematical discovery ever reported, for it was during these
months, Newton later averred, that he had made four of his chief
discoveries: (1) the binomial theorem, (2) the calculus, (3) the law of
gravitation, and (4) the nature of colors.</p>
<p>The Binomial Theorem</p>
<p>The binomial theorem seems so obvious to us now that it is difficult
to see why its discovery was so long delayed. It was only with Wallis
that fractional exponents came into common use, and we have seen that
even Wallis, the great interpolator, was unable to write down an
expansion for or . It remained for Newton to supply the expansions as
part of his method of infinite series. Discovered in 1664 or 1665, the
binomial theorem was described in two letters of 1676 from Newton to
Henry Oldenburg (1619?–1677), the secretary of the Royal Society, and
published by Wallis (with credit to Newton) in Wallis’s Algebra of 1685.
The form of expression given by Newton (and Wallis) strikes the modern
reader as awkward, but it indicates that the discovery was not just a
simple replacement of an integral power with a fraction; it was the
result of much trial and error on Newton’s part, in connection with
divisions and radicals involving algebraic quantities. Finally, Newton
discovered that</p>
<p>The Extractions of Roots are much shortened by the Theorem</p>
<p>where P + PQ stands for a Quantity whose Root or Power or whose Root
of a Power is to be found, P being the first term of that quantity, Q
being the remaining terms divided by the first term and m/n the
numerical Index of the powers of P + PQ…. Finally, in place of the terms
that occur in the course of the work in the Quotient, I shall use A, B,
C, D, etc. Thus A stands for the first term P(m/n); B for the second
term (m/n)AQ; and so on.</p>
<p>This theorem was first announced by Newton in a letter of June 13,
1676, sent to Oldenburg but intended for Leibniz. In a second letter of
October 24 of the same year, Newton explained in detail just how he had
been led to this binomial series. He wrote that toward the beginning of
his study of mathematics, he had happened on the work of Wallis on
finding the area (from x = 0 to x = x) under curves whose ordinates are
of the form (1 − x2)n. On examining the areas for exponents n equal to
0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, he found the first term always to be x, the
second term to be or or or , according as the power of n is 0 or 1 or 2
or 3, and so on. Hence, by Wallis’s principle of “intercalation,” Newton
assumed that the first two terms in the area for should be</p>
<p>In the same fashion, proceeding by analogy, he found further terms,
the first five being</p>
<p>He then realized that the same result could have been found by first
deriving , by interpolation in the same manner, and then finding the
area through integration of the terms in this series. In other words,
Newton did not proceed directly from the Pascal triangle to the binomial
theorem but indirectly from a quadrature problem to the binomial
theorem.</p>
<p>Infinite Series</p>
<p>It is likely that Newton’s indirect approach was fortunate for the
future of his work, for it made clear to him that one could operate with
infinite series in much the same way as with finite polynomial
expressions. The generality of this new infinite analysis was then
confirmed for him when he derived the same infinite series through the
extraction of the square root of 1 − x2 by the usual algebraic process,
finally verifying the result by multiplying the infinite series by
itself to recover the original radicand 1 − x2. In the same way, Newton
found that the result obtained for (1 − x2)−1 by interpolation (that is,
the binomial theorem for n = −1) agreed with the result found by long
division. Through these examples, Newton had discovered something far
more important than the binomial theorem; he had found that the analysis
by infinite series had the same inner consistency and was subject to the
same general laws as the algebra of finite quantities. Infinite series
were no longer to be regarded only as approximating devices; they were
alternative forms of the functions they represented.</p>
<p>Newton himself never published the binomial theorem, nor did he prove
it, but he wrote out and ultimately published several accounts of his
infinite analysis. The first of these, chronologically, was the De
analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, composed in 1669 on
the basis of ideas acquired in 1665–1666 but not published until 1711.
In this, he wrote,</p>
<p>And whatever the common Analysis [that is, algebra] performs by Means
of Equations of a finite number of Terms (provided that can be done)
this new method can always perform the same by Means of infinite
Equations. So that I have not made any Question of giving this the Name
of Analysis likewise. For the Reasonings in this are no less certain
than in the other; nor the Equations less exact; albeit we Mortals whose
reasoning Powers are confined within narrow Limits, can neither express,
nor so conceive all the Terms of these Equations as to know exactly from
thence the Quantities we want. To conclude, we may justly reckon that to
belong to the Analytic Art, by the help of which the Areas and Lengths,
etc. of Curves may be exactly and geometrically determined.</p>
<p>From then on, encouraged by Newton, men no longer tried to avoid
infinite processes, as had the Greeks, for these were now regarded as
legitimate in mathematics.</p>
<p>Newton’s De Analysi contained more, of course, than some work on
infinite series; it is also of great significance as the first
systematic account of Newton’s chief mathematical discovery—the
calculus. Barrow, the most important of Newton’s mentors, was primarily
a geometer, and Newton himself has often been described as an exponent
of pure geometry, but the earliest manuscript drafts of his thoughts
show that Newton made free use of algebra and a variety of algorithmic
devices and notations. He had not, by 1666, developed his notation of
fluxions, but he had formulated a systematic method of differentiation
that was not far removed from that published in 1670 by Barrow. It is
only necessary to replace Barrow’s a with Newton’s qo and Barrow’s e
with Newton’s po to arrive at Newton’s first form for the calculus.
Evidently, Newton regarded o as a very small interval of time and op and
oq as the small increments by which x and y change in this interval. The
ratio q/p, therefore, will be the ratio of the instantaneous rates of
change of y and x, that is, the slope of the curve f(x, y) = 0. The
slope of the curve yn = xm, for example, is found from (y + oq)n = (x +
op)m by expanding both sides by the binomial theorem, dividing through
by o, and disregarding terms that still contain o, the result being</p>
<p>Fractional powers no longer bothered Newton, for his method of
infinite series had given him a universal algorithm.</p>
<p>When dealing later with an explicit function of x alone, Newton
dropped his p and q and used o as a small change in the independent
variable, a notation that was also used by Gregory. In the De analysi,
for example, Newton proved as follows that the area under the curve y =
axm/n is given by</p>
<p>Let the area be z and assume that</p>
<p>Let the moment or infinitesimal increase in the abscissa be o. Then
the new abscissa will be x + o, and the augmented area will be</p>
<p>If here one applies the binomial theorem, cancels the equal term</p>
<p>divides through by o, and discards the terms that still contain o,
the result will be y = axm/n. Conversely, if the curve is y = axm/n,
then the area will be</p>
<p>This seems to be the first time in the history of mathematics that an
area was found through the inverse of what we call differentiation,
although the possibility of such a procedure evidently was known to
Barrow and Gregory and perhaps also to Torricelli and Fermat. Newton
became the effective inventor of the calculus because he was able to
exploit the inverse relationship between slope and area through his new
infinite analysis. This is why in later years he frowned on any effort
to separate his calculus from his analysis by infinite series.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions</p>
<p>In Newton’s most popular presentation of his infinitesimal methods,
he looked on x and y as flowing quantities, or fluents, of which the
quantities p and q (above) were the fluxions or rates of change; when he
wrote up this view of the calculus in about 1671, he replaced p and q by
the “pricked letters” and . The quantities or fluents of which x and y
are the fluxions he designated by and . By doubling the dots and dashes,
he was able to represent fluxions of fluxions or fluents of fluents. The
title of the work, when published long afterward in 1742 (although an
English translation appeared earlier in 1736), was not simply the method
of fluxions, but Methodus Fluxionum et Serierum Infinitorum.</p>
<p>In 1676, Newton wrote yet a third account of his calculus, under the
title De Quadratura Curvarum, and this time he sought to avoid both
infinitely small quantities and flowing quantities, replacing these with
a doctrine of “prime and ultimate ratios.” He found the “prime ratio of
nascent augments” or the “ultimate ratio of evanescent increments” as
follows. Let the ratio of the changes in x and xn be desired. Let o be
the increment in x and (x + o)n − xn the corresponding increment in xn.
Then the ratio of the increments will be</p>
<p>To find the prime and the ultimate ratio, one lets o vanish,
obtaining the ratio 1: (nxn−1). Here, Newton is very close indeed to the
limit concept, the chief objection being the use of the word “vanish.”
Is there really a ratio between increments that have vanished? Newton
did not clarify this question, and it continued to distract
mathematicians during the entire eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The Principia</p>
<p>Newton discovered his method of infinite series and the calculus in
1665–1666, and within the next decade he wrote at least three
substantial accounts of the new analysis. The De Analysi circulated
among friends, including John Collins (1625–1683) and Isaac Barrow, and
the infinite binomial expansion was sent to Oldenburg and Leibniz, but
Newton made no move to publish his results, even though he knew that
Gregory and Mercator in 1668 had disclosed their work on infinite
series. The first account of the calculus that Newton put into print
appeared in 1687 in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. This
book is generally described as presenting the foundations of physics and
astronomy in the language of pure geometry. It is true that a large part
of the work is in synthetic form, but there is also a large admixture of
analytic passages. Section I of Book I is, in fact, titled “The method
of first and last ratios of quantities, by the help of which we
demonstrate the propositions that follow,” including Lemma I:</p>
<p>Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time
converge continually to equality, and before the end of that time
approach nearer to each other than by any given difference, become
ultimately equal.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an attempt to define the limit of a function.
Lemma VII in Section I postulates that “the ultimate ratio of the arc,
chord, and tangent, any one to any other, is the ratio of equality.”
Other lemmas in that section assume the similarity of certain
“evanescent triangles.” Every now and then in Book I, the author has
recourse to an infinite series. Yet calculus algorithms do not appear
until in Book II, Lemma II, we come to the cryptic formulation</p>
<p>The moment of any genitum is equal to the moments of each of the
generating sides multiplied by the indices of the powers of those sides,
and by their coefficients continually.</p>
<p>Newton’s explanation shows that by the word “genitum,” he has in mind
what we call a “term,” and that by the “moment” of a genitum, he means
the infinitely small increment. Designating by a the moment of A and by
b the moment of B, Newton proves that the moment of AB is aB + bA, that
the moment of An is naAn−1, and that the moment of 1/A is −a/(A2). Such
expressions, which are the equivalents of the differential of a product,
a power, and a reciprocal, respectively, constitute Newton’s first
official pronouncement on the calculus, making it easy to understand why
so few mathematicians of the time mastered the new analysis in terms of
Newtonian language.</p>
<p>Newton was not the first one to differentiate or to integrate or to
see the relationship between these operations in the fundamental theorem
of the calculus. His discovery consisted of the consolidation of these
elements into a general algorithm that is applicable to all functions,
whether algebraic or transcendental. This was emphasized in a scholium
that Newton published in the Principia immediately following Lemma
II:</p>
<p>In a letter of mine to Mr. J. Collins, dated December 10, 1672,
having described a method of tangents, which I suspected to be the same
with Sluse’s method, which at that time was not made public, I added
these words: This is one particular, or rather a Corollary, of a general
method, which extends itself, without any troublesome calculation, not
only to the drawing of tangents to any curved lines whether geometrical
or mechanical . . . but also to the resolving other abstruser kinds of
problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centres of gravity of
curves, etc.; nor is it (as Hudden’s method de maximis et minimis)
limited to equations which are free from surd quantities. This method I
have interwoven with that other of working in equations by reducing them
to infinite series.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the Principia, Newton admitted that Leibniz
was in possession of a similar method, but in the third edition of 1726,
following the bitter quarrel between adherents of the two men concerning
the independence and priority of the discovery of the calculus, Newton
deleted the reference to the calculus of Leibniz. It is now fairly clear
that Newton’s discovery antedated that of Leibniz by about ten years,
but that the discovery by Leibniz was independent of that of Newton.
Moreover, Leibniz is entitled to priority of publication, for he printed
an account of his calculus in 1684 in the Acta Eruditorum, a sort of
“scientific monthly” that had been established only two years
earlier.</p>
<p>In the opening sections of the Principia, Newton had so generalized
and clarified Galileo’s ideas on motion that ever since, we refer to
this formulation as “Newton’s laws of motion.” Then Newton went on to
combine these laws with Kepler’s laws in astronomy and Huygens’s law of
centripetal force in circular motion to establish the great unifying
principle that any two particles in the universe, whether two planets or
two mustard seeds, or the sun and a mustard seed, attract each other
with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance between
them. In the statement of this law, Newton had been anticipated by
others, including Robert Hooke (1638–1703), professor of geometry at
Gresham College and Oldenburg’s successor as secretary of the Royal
Society. But Newton was the first to convince the world of the truth of
the law because he was able to handle the mathematics required in the
proof.</p>
<p>For circular motion, the inverse square law is easily derived from
Newton’s f = ma, Huygens’s a = v2/r, and Kepler’s T2 = Kr3 simply by
noting that and then eliminating T and v from the equations, to arrive
at . To prove the same thing for ellipses, however, required
considerably more mathematical skill. Moreover, to prove that the
distance is to be measured from the center of the bodies was so
difficult a task that it evidently was this integration problem that
induced Newton to lay the work on gravitation aside for almost twenty
years following his discovery of the law in the plague year of
1665–1666. When, in 1684, his friend Edmund Halley (1656–1742), a
mathematician of no mean ability who also had guessed at the inverse
square law, pressed Newton for a proof, the result was the exposition in
the Principia. So impressed was Halley with the quality of this book
that he had it published at his own expense.</p>
<p>The Principia, of course, contains far more than the calculus, the
laws of motion, and the law of gravitation. It includes, in science,
such things as the motions of bodies in resisting media and the proof
that for isothermal vibrations, the velocity of sound should be the
speed with which a body would strike the earth if falling without
resistance through a height that is half that of a uniform atmosphere
having the density of air at the surface of the earth and exerting the
same pressure. Another of the scientific conclusions in the Principia is
a mathematical proof of the invalidity of the prevailing cosmic
scheme—the Cartesian theory of vortices—for Newton showed, at the close
of Book II, that according to the laws of mechanics, planets in vortical
motion would move more swiftly in aphelion than in perihelion, which
contradicts the astronomy of Kepler. Nevertheless, it took about forty
years before the Newtonian gravitational view of the universe displaced
the Cartesian vortical cosmology in France.</p>
<p>Theorems on Conics</p>
<p>One who reads only the headings of the three books in the Principia
will get the erroneous impression that it contains nothing but physics
and astronomy, for the books are titled, respectively, I. The Motion of
Bodies, II. The Motion of Bodies (in Resisting Mediums), and III. The
System of the World. Yet the treatise also contains a great deal of pure
mathematics, especially concerning the conic sections. In Lemma XIX of
Book I, for example, the author solves the Pappus four-line-locus
problem, adding that his solution is “not an analytical calculus but a
geometrical composition, such as the ancients required,” an oblique and
pejorative reference, apparently, to the treatment of the problem given
by Descartes.</p>
<p>Throughout the Principia, Newton gave preference to a geometric
approach, but we have seen that where he found it expedient to do so, he
did not hesitate to appeal to his method of infinite series and the
calculus. Most of Section II of Book II, for example, is analytic. On
the other hand, Newton’s handling of the properties of conics is almost
exclusively synthetic, for here Newton had no need to resort to
analysis. Following the Pappus problem, he gave a couple of organic
generations of conics through intersections of moving lines, and then he
used these in half a dozen succeeding propositions to show how to
construct a conic satisfying five conditions: passing through five
points, for example, or tangent to five lines or through two points and
tangent to three lines.</p>
<p>Optics and Curves</p>
<p>The Principia is the greatest monument to Newton, but it is by no
means the only one. His paper in the 1672 Philosophical Transactions
concerning the nature of color was of great importance to physics, for
it was here that Newton announced what he regarded as one of the oddest
of all of the operations of nature—that white light was merely a
combination of rays of varying color, each color having its own
characteristic index of refraction. Such a revolutionary view was not
easy for his contemporaries to accept, and the ensuing controversy upset
Newton. For fifteen years, he published nothing further until the urging
of Halley induced him to write and publish the Principia. Meanwhile, the
three versions of his calculus that he had written from 1669 to 1676, as
well as a treatise on optics that he had composed, remained in
manuscript form.</p>
<p>About fifteen years after the Principia appeared, Hooke died, and
then, finally, Newton’s aversion to publication seems to have abated
somewhat. The Opticks appeared in 1704, and appended to it were two
mathematical works: the De Quadratura Curvarum, in which an intelligible
account of the Newtonian methods in the calculus finally appeared in
print, and a little treatise titled Enumeratio Curvarum Tertii Ordinis
(Enumeration of Curves of Third Degree). The Enumeratio had also been
composed by 1676, and it is the earliest instance of a work devoted
solely to graphs of higher plane curves in algebra. Newton noted
seventy-two species of cubics (half a dozen are omitted), and a curve of
each species is carefully drawn. For the first time, two axes are
systematically used, and there is no hesitation about negative
coordinates. Among the interesting properties of cubics indicated in
this treatise are the fact that a third-degree curve can have not more
than three asymptotes (as a conic can have no more than two) and that as
all conics are projections of the circle, so all cubics are projections
of a “divergent parabola” y2 = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d.</p>
<p>Polar and Other Coordinates</p>
<p>The Enumeratio was not Newton’s only contribution to analytic
geometry. In the Method of Fluxions, written in Latin about 1671, he had
suggested eight new types of coordinate system. One of these, Newton’s
“Third Manner” of determining a curve was through what now are called
“bipolar coordinates.” If x and y are the distances of a variable point
from two fixed points or poles, then the equations x + y = a and x − y =
a represent ellipses and hyperbolas, respectively, and ax + by = c are
ovals of Descartes. This type of coordinate system is infrequently used
today, but that given by Newton as his “Seventh Manner; For Spirals” is
now familiarly known under the name of “polar coordinates.” Using x
where we now use 0 or ϕ and y where we use r or ρ, Newton found the
subtangent to the spiral of Archimedes by = ax, as well as to other
spirals. Having given the formula for radius of curvature in rectangular
coordinates,</p>
<p>where he wrote the corresponding formula in polar coordinates as</p>
<p>where and ψ is the angle between the tangent and the radius
vector.</p>
<p>Newton also gave equations for the transformation from rectangular to
polar coordinates, expressing these as xx + yy = tt and tv = y, where t
is the radius vector and v is a line representing the sine of the
vectorial angle associated with the point (x, y) in Cartesian
coordinates.</p>
<p>Newton’s Method and Newton’s Parallelogram</p>
<p>In the Method of Fluxions, as well as in De Analysi, we find
“Newton’s method” for the approximate solution of equations. If the
equation to be solved is f(x) = 0, one first locates the desired root
between two values x = a1 and x = b1 such that in the interval (a1, b1)
neither the first nor the second derivative vanishes, or fails to exist.
Then, for one of the values, say, x = a1, f(x) and f″(x) will have the
same sign. In this case, the value x = a2 will be a better approximation
if</p>
<p>and this procedure can be applied iteratively to obtain as precise an
approximation an as may be desired. If f(x) is of the form x2 − a2, the
successive approximations in the Newton method are the same as those
found in the Old Babylonian square-root algorithm; hence, this ancient
procedure is sometimes unwarrantedly called “Newton’s algorithm.” If
f(x) is a polynomial, Newton’s method is in essence the same as the
Chinese-Arabic method named for Horner, but the great advantage of the
Newtonian method is that it applies equally to equations involving
transcendental functions.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions also contained a diagram that later became
known as “Newton’s parallelogram,” useful in developments in infinite
series and in the sketching of curves. For a polynomial equation f(x, y)
= 0, one forms a grid or a lattice the intersection points of which are
to correspond to terms of all possible degrees in the equation f(x, y) =
0. On this “parallelogram,” one connects by straight-line segments those
intersections that correspond to terms actually appearing in the
equation and then forms a portion of a polygon convex toward the point
of zero degree. In Fig. 16.2, we have drawn the diagram for the folium
of Descartes, x3 + y3 − 3axy = 0. Then, the equations that are obtained
by equating to zero in turn the totality of terms from the given
equation whose lattice points lie on each of the segments will be
approximating equations for branches of the curve through the origin. In
the case of the folium of Descartes, the approximating curves are x3 −
3axy = 0 (or the parabola x2 = 3ay) and y3 − 3axy = 0 (or the parabola
y2 = 3ax). The graphing of portions of these parabolas near the origin
will aid in the rapid sketching of the given equation f(x, y) = 0.</p>
<p>FIG. 16.2</p>
<p>The Arithmetica Universalis</p>
<p>The three Newtonian books that are best known today are the
Principia, the Method of Fluxions, and the Opticks; there is also a
fourth work that in the eighteenth century appeared in a greater number
of editions than did the other three, and it, too, contained valuable
contributions. This was the Arithmetica Universalis, a work composed
between 1673 and 1683, perhaps for Newton’s lectures at Cambridge, and
first published in 1707. This influential treatise contains the
formulas, usually known as “Newton’s identities,” for the sums of the
powers of the roots of a polynomial equation. Cardan had known that the
sum of the roots of xn + a1xn−1⋯ + an−1x + an = 0 is −a1, and Viète had
carried the relations between roots and coefficients somewhat further.
In 1629, Girard had shown how to find the sum of the squares of the
roots or the sum of the cubes or of the fourth powers, but it was Newton
who generalized this work to cover all powers. If K≤ n, the
relationships</p>
<p>both hold; if K &gt; n, the relationship</p>
<p>holds, where Si is the sum of the ith powers of the roots. Using
these relationships recursively, the sums of the powers of the roots can
readily be found for any integral power. In the Arithmetica Universalis,
there is also a theorem generalizing Descartes’ rule of signs to
determine the number of imaginary roots of a polynomial, as well as a
rule for an upper bound for the positive roots.</p>
<p>The longest section in the Arithmetica Universalis is that on the
resolution of geometric questions. Here the solution of cubic equations
is carried out with the help of a given conic section, for Newton
regarded geometric constructions through curves other than the line and
the circle as part of algebra, rather than of geometry:</p>
<p>Equations are Expressions of Arithmetical Computation and properly
have no place in Geometry. Therefore the conic sections and all other
Figures must be cast out of plane Geometry, except the right Line and
the Circle. Therefore all these descriptions of the Conicks in piano,
which the Moderns are so fond of, are foreign to Geometry.</p>
<p>Newton’s conservatism here is in sharp contrast with his radical
views in analysis—and with pedagogical views of the mid-twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Later Years</p>
<p>The Principia was the first of Newton’s mathematical treatises to be
published, but it was the last in order of composition. Fame had come to
him relatively promptly, for he had been elected to the Royal Society in
1672, four years after he had constructed his reflecting telescope (the
idea for which had also occurred to Gregory even earlier). The Principia
met with enthusiastic approval, and in 1689, Newton was elected to
represent Cambridge in the British Parliament. Despite the generous
recognition he received, Newton became depressed and suffered a nervous
breakdown in 1692. He accepted an appointment as Warden of the Mint in
1696, becoming Master of the Mint three years later. Newton retained his
extraordinary mathematical ability to the very last; when Leibniz in
1716 (the last year of his life) challenged Newton to find the
orthogonal trajectories of a one-parameter family of plane curves,
Newton solved the problem within a few hours and gave a method for
finding trajectories in general. (Earlier, in 1696, Newton had been
challenged to find the brachistochrone, or curve of quickest descent,
and the day after receiving the problem he gave the solution, showing
the curve to be a cycloid.)</p>
<p>Honors were heaped on Newton in his later years. In 1699, he was
elected a foreign associate of the Académie des Sciences; in 1703, he
became president of the Royal Society, holding the post for the rest of
his life; and in 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne. Nevertheless, one
event cast a cloud over Newton’s life after 1695. In that year, Wallis
told him that in Holland, the calculus was regarded as the discovery of
Leibniz. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (1664–1753), an obscure
Swiss mathematician who had moved to England, implied in a paper to the
Royal Society that Leibniz may have taken his ideas on the calculus from
Newton. At this affront, Leibniz, in the Acta Eruditorum for 1704,
insisted that he was entitled to priority in publication and protested
to the Royal Society against the imputation of plagiarism. In 1705,
Newton’s De Quadratura Curvarum was unfavorably reviewed (by Leibniz?)
in the Acta Eruditorum, and in 1708, John Keill (1671–1721), an Oxford
professor, vigorously supported Newton’s claims against those of Leibniz
in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Leibniz’s repeated appeals
to the Royal Society for justice finally led the Society to appoint a
committee to study the matter and to report on it. The committee’s
report, under the title Commercium epistolicum, was published in 1712,
but it left matters unimproved. It reached the banal conclusion that
Newton was the first inventor, a point that had not been questioned
seriously in the first place. Implications of plagiarism were supported
by the committee in terms of documents that they assumed Leibniz had
seen, but that we now know he had not received. The bitterness of
national feeling reached such a point that in 1726, a decade after
Leibniz had died, Newton deleted from the third edition of the Principia
all reference to the fact that Leibniz had possessed a method in the
calculus similar to the Newtonian.</p>
<p>As a consequence to the disgraceful priority dispute, British
mathematicians were to some extent alienated from workers on the
Continent during much of the eighteenth century. On his death, Newton
was buried in Westminster Abbey with such pomp that Voltaire, who
attended the funeral, said later, “I have seen a professor of
mathematics, only because he was great in his vocation, buried like a
king who had done good to his subjects.”</p>
<p>Abraham De Moivre</p>
<p>British mathematics boasted an impressive number of capable
contributors during the earlier part of the eighteenth century. Abraham
De Moivre (1667–1754) had been born a French Huguenot, but shortly after
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, he went to England, where he made
the acquaintance of Newton and Halley and became a private teacher of
mathematics. In 1697, he was elected to the Royal Society and
subsequently to the Academies of Paris and Berlin. He hoped to obtain a
university position in mathematics, but this he never secured, partly
because of his non-British origin, and Leibniz tried in vain to secure a
professional position for him in Germany. Nevertheless, despite the long
hours of tutoring that were necessary to support himself, De Moivre
produced a considerable quantity of research.</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>The theory of probability had many devotees during the early
eighteenth century, and De Moivre was one of the most important of
these. In 1711, he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions a long
memoir on the laws of chance, and this he expanded into a celebrated
volume, the Doctrine of Chances, that appeared in 1718 (and in later
editions). The memoir and the volume contained numerous questions on
dice, the problem of points (with unequal chances of winning), drawing
balls of various colors from a bag, and other games. Some of the
problems had appeared in Jacques Bernoulli’s Ars Conjectandi, the
publication of which was earlier than the Doctrine of Chances but later
than De Moivre’s memoir. In the preface to the Doctrine of Chances, the
author referred to the work on probability of Jacques, Jean, and
Nicolaus Bernoulli. The various editions of the volume contain more than
fifty problems on probability, as well as questions relating to life
annuities. In general, De Moivre derived the theory of permutations and
combinations from the principles of probability, whereas now it is
customary to reverse the roles. For example, to find the number of
permutations of two letters chosen from the six letters a, b, c, d, e,
and f, he argued that the probability that a particular letter will be
first is and the probability that another specific letter will be second
is . Hence, the probability that these two letters will appear in that
order is , from which one concludes that the number of all possible
permutations, two at a time, is 30. De Moivre is often credited with the
principle, published in the Doctrine of Chances, that the probability of
a compound event is the product of the probabilities of its components,
but this had been implied in earlier works.</p>
<p>De Moivre was especially interested in developing for probability
general procedures and notations that he thought of as a new “algebra.”
A generalization of a problem given earlier by Huygens usually is
appropriately called De Moivre’s problem: to find the probability of
throwing a given number on a throw of n dice, each having m faces. Some
of his contributions to probability were published in a further volume,
the Miscellanea Analytica of 1730. In a supplement to this work, De
Moivre included some results that also appeared in the Methodus
Differentialis of James Stirling (1692–1770), published in the same year
as the Miscellanea Analytica. Among these is the approximation , which
is usually known as Stirling’s formula, although it was known earlier to
De Moivre, and a series, also named for Stirling, relating ln n! and the
Bernoulli numbers.</p>
<p>De Moivre apparently was the first one to work with the probability
formula</p>
<p>a result that unobtrusively appeared in a privately printed pamphlet
of 1733 titled Approximatio ad summam terminorum binomii (a + b)n in
seriem expansi. This work, representing the first appearance of the law
of errors or the distribution curve, was translated by De Moivre and was
included in the second edition (1738) of his Doctrine of Chances. In his
work on Annuities upon Lives, which formed a part of the Doctrine of
Chances and was separately reprinted in more than half a dozen editions,
he adopted a rough-and-ready rule, known as “De Moivre’s hypothesis of
equal decrements,” that annuities can be computed on the assumption that
the number of a given group that die is the same during each year.</p>
<p>De Moivre’s Theorem</p>
<p>The Miscellanea Analytica is important not only in probability but
also in the development of the analytic side of trigonometry. The
well-known De Moivre’s theorem, , is not explicitly given, but it is
clear from the work on cyclometry and other contexts that the author was
quite familiar with this relationship, probably as early as 1707. In a
paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1707, De Moivre wrote
that</p>
<p>In his Miscellanea Analytica of 1730, he expressed the equivalent
of</p>
<p>which he used to factor x2n + 2x cos nθ + 1 into quadratic factors of
the form x2 + 2x cos θ + 1. Again in a Philosophical Transactions paper
of 1739, he found the nth roots of the “impossible binomial” through the
procedure that we now use in taking the nth root of the modulus,
dividing the amplitude by n, and adding multiples of 2π/n.</p>
<p>De Moivre, dealing with imaginary numbers and the circular functions
in Miscellanea Analytica, came close to recognizing the hyperbolic
functions in extending theorems on sectors of circles to analogous
results on sectors of the rectangular hyperbola. In view of the breadth
and depth of his results, it was natural that Newton in his later years
should have told those who came to him with questions on mathematics,
“Go to Mr. De Moivre; he knows these things better than I do.”</p>
<p>In the Philosophical Transactions for 1697–1698, De Moivre had
written on the “infinitonome,” that is, an infinite polynomial or
infinite series, including the process of finding a root of such an
expression, and it was largely in recognition of this paper that he had
been elected a member of the Royal Society. De Moivre’s interest in
infinite series and probability is reminiscent of the Bernoullis’. De
Moivre carried on an extensive and cordial correspondence with Jean
Bernoulli during the decade 1704 to 1714, and it was the former who
proposed the latter for election to the Royal Society in 1712.</p>
<p>Roger Cotes</p>
<p>One of the motives that had led De Moivre to be concerned with the
factoring of x2n + axn + 1 into quadratic factors was the desire to
complete some of the work of Roger Cotes (1682–1716) on the integration
of rational fractions through decompositions into partial fractions. The
life of Cotes is another tragic instance of a very promising career cut
short by premature death. As Newton remarked, “If Cotes had lived, we
might have known something.” A student and later a professor at
Cambridge, the young man had spent much of the time from 1709 to 1713
preparing the second edition of Newton’s Principia. Three years later he
died, leaving behind him some significant but uncompleted work. Much of
this was collected and published posthumously in 1722 under the title
Harmonia Mensurarum. The title is derived from the following
theorem:</p>
<p>If through a fixed point O a variable straight line is drawn cutting
an algebraic curve in points Q1, Q2, . . ., Qn, and if a point P is
taken on the line such that the reciprocal of OP is the arithmetic mean
of the reciprocals of OQ1, OQ2, . . ., OQn, then the locus of P is a
straight line.</p>
<p>Most of the treatise, however, is devoted to the integration of
rational fractions, including decomposition into quadratic factors of xn
− 1, work later completed by De Moivre. The Harmonia Mensurarum is among
the early works to recognize the periodicity of the trigonometric
functions, cycles of the tangent and secant functions appearing here in
print for perhaps the first time. It is one of the earliest books with a
thorough treatment of the calculus as applied to the logarithmic and
circular functions, including a table of integrals that depends on
these. In this connection, the author gave what is known in trigonometry
books as “Cotes’s property of the circle,” a result closely related to
De Moivre’s theorem, which allows one to write such expressions as</p>
<p>This result is readily confirmed if, having plotted on the unit
circle the roots of −1 of order 2n, one forms the products of conjugate
imaginary pairs. Cotes apparently was among the earliest of
mathematicians to anticipate the relationship ln (cos θ + i sin θ) = i
θ, an equivalent of which had been given by him in a Philosophical
Transactions article in 1714 and which was reprinted in the Harmonia
Mensurarum. This theorem is usually attributed to Euler, who first gave
it in modern exponential form.</p>
<p>James Stirling</p>
<p>Stirling, a Jacobite who had studied at Oxford, published in 1717 a
work titled Lineae Tertii Ordinis Neutonianae, in which he completed the
classification of cubic curves, drawn up by Newton in 1704, by adding
some cubics that Newton missed and by adding demonstrations that had
been lacking in the original Enumeratio. Stirling showed, among other
things, that if the y-axis is an asymptote of a curve of order n, the
equation of the curve cannot contain a term in yn and an asymptote
cannot cut the curve in more than n − 2 points. For graphs of rational
functions y = f(x)/g(x), he found the vertical asymptotes by equating
g(x) to zero. For conic sections, Stirling gave a full treatment in
which the axes, vertices, and asymptotes are found analytically from the
general second-degree equation with respect to oblique coordinates.</p>
<p>His Methodus Differentialis of 1730 contained significant
contributions to the study of convergence of infinite series,
interpolation, and special functions defined by series; he is best
known, however, for the approximation formula for n! mentioned
previously.</p>
<p>Colin Maclaurin</p>
<p>Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), perhaps the outstanding British
mathematician of the generation after Newton, was born in Scotland and
educated at the University of Glasgow. He became a professor of
mathematics at Aberdeen when he was nineteen and half a dozen years
later taught at the University of Edinburgh. In Great Britain,
Switzerland, and the Low Countries, the leading mathematicians in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were connected with universities,
whereas in France, Germany, and Russia, they were more likely to be
associated with the academies established by the absolute rulers.</p>
<p>Maclaurin had begun to contribute papers to the Philosophical
Transactions before he was twenty-one, and in 1720, he published two
treatises on curves: Geometrica Organica and De Linearum Geometricarum
proprietatibus. The former, in particular, was a well-known work that
extended the results of Newton and Stirling on conics, cubics, and
higher algebraic curves. Among the propositions is one often known as
the theorem of Bézout (in honor of the man who later gave an imperfect
proof): a curve of order m intersects a curve of order n in general in
mn points. In connection with this theorem, Maclaurin noticed a
difficulty that is usually known as Cramer’s paradox, in honor of a
later rediscoverer. A curve of order n is generally determined, as
Stirling had indicated, by n(n + 3)/2 points. Thus, a conic is uniquely
determined by five points and a cubic should be determined by nine
points. By the Maclaurin-Bézout theorem, however, two curves of degree n
intersect in n2 points, so that two different cubics intersect in nine
points. Hence, it is obvious that n(n + 3)/2 points do not always
uniquely determine a single curve of order n. The answer to the paradox
did not appear until a century later, when it was explained in the work
of Julius Plücker.</p>
<p>Taylor’s Series</p>
<p>In view of Maclaurin’s striking results in geometry, it is ironic
that today his name is recalled almost exclusively in connection with
the so-called Maclaurin series, which appeared in his Treatise of
Fluxions of 1742 but is only a special case of the more general Taylor
series, published by Brook Taylor (1685–1731) in 1715 in his Methodus
Incrementorum Directa et Inversa. Taylor was a Cambridge graduate, an
enthusiastic admirer of Newton, and secretary of the Royal Society. He
was much interested in perspective; on this subject he published two
books in 1715 and 1719, in the second of which he gave the first general
statement of the principle of vanishing points. Yet today his name is
recalled almost exclusively in connection with the series</p>
<p>which appeared in the Methodus Incrementorum. The series becomes the
familiar Maclaurin series on substituting zero for a. The general Taylor
series had been known many years prior to James Gregory and also, in
essence, to Jean Bernoulli, but Taylor was unaware of this. Moreover,
the Maclaurin series had appeared in Stirling’s Methodus Differentialis
more than a dozen years before it was published by Maclaurin. Clio, the
muse of history, is often fickle in the matter of attaching names to
theorems!</p>
<p>The Analyst Controversy</p>
<p>The Methodus Incrementorum also contained a number of other familiar
parts of the calculus, such as formulas relating the derivative of a
function to the derivative of the inverse function—for example, d2x/dy2
= −d2y/dx2/(dy/dx)3—singular solutions of differential equations, and an
attempt to find an equation for a vibrating string. After 1719, Taylor
gave up the pursuit of mathematics, but the young Maclaurin was then
just beginning his fruitful career. His Treatise of Fluxions was not
merely another book on the techniques of the calculus, but was an effort
to establish the subject on a sound basis, similar to that of the
geometry of Archimedes. The motive here was to defend the subject from
attacks that had been launched, especially by Bishop George Berkeley
(1685–1753) in a 1734 tract titled The Analyst. Berkeley did not deny
the utility of the techniques of fluxions or the validity of the results
obtained by using these, but he had been nettled on having a sick friend
refuse spiritual consolation because Halley had convinced the friend of
the untenable nature of Christian doctrine. Hence, the subtitle of the
Analyst reads,</p>
<p>Or a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician [presumably
Halley]. Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and
Inferences of the Modern Analysis are More Distinctly Conceived, or More
Evidently Deduced, than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith. “First
Cast the Beam Out of Thine Own Eye; and Then Shalt Thou See Clearly to
Cast Out the Mote Out of Thy Brother’s Eye.”</p>
<p>Berkeley’s account of the method of fluxions was quite fair, and his
criticisms were well taken. He pointed out that in finding either
fluxions or the ratios of differentials, mathematicians first assume
that increments are given to the variables and then take the increments
away by assuming them to be zero. The calculus, as then explained,
seemed to Berkeley to be only a compensation of errors. Thus, “by virtue
of a twofold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet at the
truth.” Even Newton’s explanation of fluxions in terms of prime and
ultimate ratios was condemned by Berkeley, who denied the possibility of
a literally “instantaneous” velocity in which distance and time
increments have vanished to leave the meaningless quotient 0/0. As he
expressed it,</p>
<p>And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments.
And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither finite
quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not
call them ghosts of departed quantities?</p>
<p>It was to answer such criticisms that Maclaurin wrote his Treatise of
Fluxions in the rigorous manner of the ancients, but in doing so, he
used a geometric approach that is less suggestive of the new
developments that were to feature the analysis of Continental Europe.
Perhaps this is not unrelated to the fact that Maclaurin was almost the
last significant mathematician in Great Britain during the eighteenth
century, a time when analysis, rather than geometry, was on the crest of
the wave. Nevertheless, the Treatise of Fluxions contained a number of
relatively new results, including the integral test for convergence of
infinite series (given earlier by Euler in 1732 but generally
overlooked).</p>
<p>After Maclaurin and De Moivre died, British mathematics suffered an
eclipse, so that despite the recognition accorded mathematical
achievement in England up to that time, development of mathematics there
failed to match the rapid strides taken elsewhere in Europe during the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Cramer’s Rule</p>
<p>If today the name of Maclaurin is recalled in connection with a
series of which he was not the first discoverer, this is compensated for
by the fact that a contribution he made bears the name of someone else
who discovered and printed it later. The well-known Cramer’s rule,
published in 1750 by Gabriel Cramer (1704–1752), was probably known to
Maclaurin as early as 1729, the time when he was composing an algebra
intended as commentary on Newton’s Arithmetica Universalis. The
Maclaurin Treatise of Algebra was published in 1748, two years after the
author had died, and in it, the rule for solving simultaneous equations
by determinants appeared, two years earlier than in Cramer’s
Introduction à l’analyse des lignes courbes algébriques. The solution
for y in the system</p>
<p>is given as</p>
<p>The solution for z in the system</p>
<p>is expressed as</p>
<p>Maclaurin explained that the denominator consists, in the former
case, of “the Difference of the Products of the opposite Coefficients
taken from the Orders that involve the two unknown Quantities” and, in
the latter case, “of all the Products that can be made of the three
opposite Coefficients taken from the Orders that involve the three
unknown Quantities.” The numerators in Maclaurin’s patterns differ from
the denominators merely in the substitution in the former of the
constant terms for the coefficients of the terms in the unknown sought.
He explained how to write out the solution similarly for four equations
in four unknowns, “prefixing contrary signs to those that involve the
Products of two opposite Coefficients.” This statement shows that
Maclaurin had in mind a rule for alternations in sign akin to that now
ordinarily described in terms of the inversion principle.</p>
<p>Maclaurin’s posthumous Treatise of Algebra enjoyed an even wider
popularity than his other works, with a sixth edition appearing in
London in 1796. The world nevertheless seems to have learned of the
solution of simultaneous equations by determinants more through Cramer
than through Maclaurin, mainly, we suspect, because of the superiority
of Cramer’s notation, in which superscripts were attached to literal
coefficients to facilitate the determination of signs. Another possible
factor is the previously mentioned alienation of British from
Continental mathematicians.</p>
<p>Textbooks</p>
<p>Maclaurin and others had composed good textbooks on an elementary
level. Maclaurin’s Treatise of Algebra went through half a dozen
editions from 1748 to 1796. A rival Treatise of Algebra by Thomas
Simpson (1710–1761) boasted at least eight editions in London from 1745
to 1809; another, Elements of Algebra, by Nicholas Saunderson
(1682–1739), enjoyed five editions between 1740 and 1792.</p>
<p>Simpson was a self-taught genius who won election to the Royal
Society in 1745, but whose turbulent life ended in failure half a dozen
years later. His name nevertheless is preserved in the so-called
Simpson’s rule, published in his Mathematical Dissertations on Physical
and Analytical Subjects (1743), for approximate quadratures using
parabolic arcs, but this result had appeared in somewhat different form
in 1668 in the Exercitationes geometricae of James Gregory. Saunderson’s
life, by contrast, was an example of personal triumph over an enormous
handicap—total blindness from the age of one, resulting from an attack
of smallpox.</p>
<p>Algebra textbooks of the eighteenth century illustrate a tendency
toward increasingly algorithmic emphasis, while at the same time there
remained considerable uncertainty about the logical bases for the
subject. Most authors felt it necessary to dwell at length on the rules
governing multiplications of negative numbers, and some categorically
rejected the possibility of multiplying two negative numbers. The
century was, par excellence, a textbook age in mathematics, and never
before had so many books appeared in so many editions. Simpson’s Algebra
had a companion volume, Elements of Plane Geometry, which went through
five editions from 1747 to 1800. But among the host of textbooks of the
time, few achieved quite the record of the edition by Robert Simson
(1687–1768) of the Elements of Euclid. This work, by a man trained in
medicine who became a professor in mathematics at the University of
Glasgow, first appeared in 1756, and by 1834, it boasted a twenty-fourth
English edition, not to mention translations into other languages or
geometries more or less derived from it, for most modern English
versions of Euclid are heavily indebted to it.</p>
<p>Rigor and Progress</p>
<p>Simson sought to revive ancient Greek geometry, and in this
connection, he published “restorations” of lost works, such as Euclid’s
Porisms and the Determinate Sections of Apollonius. England during the
eighteenth century remained a stronghold of synthetic geometry, and
analytic methods made little headway in geometry.</p>
<p>It is customary to place much of the blame for the backwardness in
analysis on the supposedly clumsy method of fluxions, as compared with
that of the differential calculus, but such a view is not easily
justified. Fluxional notations even today are conveniently used by
physicists, and they are readily adapted to analytic geometry, but no
calculus, whether differential or fluxional, is appropriately wedded to
synthetic geometry. Hence, the British predilection for pure geometry
seems to have been a far more effective deterrent to research in
analysis than was the notation of fluxions. Nor is it fair to place the
blame for British geometric conservatism largely on the shoulders of
Newton. After all, Newton’s Method of Fluxions was replete with analytic
geometry, and even the Principia contained more analysis than is
generally recognized. Perhaps it was an excessive insistence on logical
precision that had led the British into a narrow geometric view. We
previously noted Berkeley’s arguments against mathematicians, and
Maclaurin had felt that the most effective way to meet these on a
rational basis was to return to the rigor of classical geometry. On the
Continent, on the other hand, the feeling was akin to the advice that
Jean Le Rond d’Alembert is said to have given to a hesitating
mathematical friend: “Just go on ahead, and faith will soon return.”</p>
<p>Leibniz</p>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was born in Leipzig, where he
studied theology, law, philosophy, and mathematics at the university. By
the time he was twenty, he was prepared for the degree of doctor of
laws, but this was refused because of his youth. He thereupon left
Leipzig and took his doctorate at the University of Altdorf in
Nuremberg. He then entered the diplomatic service, first for the elector
of Mainz, then for the Brunswick family, and finally for the
Hanoverians, whom he served for forty years. Among the electors of
Hanover whom Leibniz served was the future (1714) King George I of
England. As an influential governmental representative, Leibniz traveled
widely.</p>
<p>In 1672, he went to Paris, where he met Huygens, who suggested that
if he wished to become a mathematician, he should read Pascal’s
treatises of 1658–1659.</p>
<p>In 1673, a political mission took him to London, where he bought a
copy of Barrow’s Lectiones geometricae, met Oldenburg and Collins, and
became a member of the Royal Society. It is largely around this visit
that the later quarrel over priority centered, for Leibniz could have
seen Newton’s De Analysi in manuscript. It is doubtful, however, that at
this stage he would have derived much from it, for Leibniz was not yet
well prepared in geometry or analysis. In 1676, Leibniz again visited
London, bringing with him his calculating machine; it was during these
years between his two London visits that the differential calculus had
taken shape.</p>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</p>
<p>Infinite Series</p>
<p>As was the case with Newton, infinite series played a large role in
the early work of Leibniz. Huygens had set him the problem of finding
the sum of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, that is, 2/n(n +
1). Leibniz cleverly wrote each term as the sum of two fractions,
using</p>
<p>from which it is obvious, on writing out a few terms, that the sum of
the first n terms is</p>
<p>hence that the sum of the infinite series is 2. From this success, he
ingenuously concluded that he would be able to find the sum of almost
any infinite series.</p>
<p>The summation of series again came up in the harmonic triangle, whose
analogies with the arithmetic (Pascal) triangle fascinated Leibniz.</p>
<p>In the arithmetic triangle, each element (that is not in the first
column) is the difference of the two terms directly below it and to the
left; in the harmonic triangle, each term (that is not in the first row)
is the difference of the two terms directly above it and to the right.
Moreover, in the arithmetic triangle, each element (not in the first row
or column) is the sum of all of the terms in the line above it and to
the left, whereas in the harmonic triangle, each element is the sum of
all of the terms in the line below it and to the right. The series in
the first line is the harmonic series, which diverges; for all other
lines, the series converge. The numbers in the second line are one-half
the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, and Leibniz knew that the sum
of this series is 1. The numbers in the third line are one-third the
reciprocals of the pyramidal numbers</p>
<p>and the harmonic triangle indicates that the sum of this series is ,
and so on, for the succeeding rows in the harmonic triangle. The numbers
in the nth diagonal row in this triangle are the reciprocals of the
numbers in the corresponding nth diagonal row of the arithmetic triangle
divided by n.</p>
<p>From his studies on infinite series and the harmonic triangle,
Leibniz turned to reading Pascal’s works on the cycloid and other
aspects of infinitesimal analysis. In particular, it was on reading the
letter of Amos Dettonville on Traité des sinus du quart de cercle that
Leibniz reported that a light burst on him. He then realized, in about
1673, that the determination of the tangent to a curve depended on the
ratio of the differences in the ordinates and the abscissas, as these
became infinitely small, and that quadratures depended on the sum of the
ordinates or infinitely thin rectangles making up the area. Just as in
the arithmetic and harmonic triangles the processes of summing and
differencing are oppositely related, so also in geometry the quadrature
and tangent problems, depending on sums and differences, respectively,
are inverses of each other. The connecting link seemed to be through the
infinitesimal or “characteristic” triangle, for where Pascal had used it
to find the quadrature of sines, Barrow had applied it to the tangent
problem. A comparison of the triangle in Barrow’s diagram (Fig. 16.1)
with that in Pascal’s figure (Fig. 16.3) will disclose the marked
similarity that evidently struck Leibniz so forcibly. If EDE is tangent
at D to the unit quarter circle BDC (Fig. 16.3), then, Pascal saw, AD is
to DI as EE is to RR or EK. For a very small interval RR, the line EE
can be considered to be virtually the same as the arc of the circle
intercepted between the ordinates ER. Hence, in the notation that
Leibniz developed a few years later, we have 1/sinθ = dθ/dx, where θ is
the angle DAC. Because and cosθ = x, we have . By the square-root
algorithm and long division (or by the binomial theorem that Newton
communicated to Leibniz, through Oldenburg, in 1676), it is a simple
matter to find . By use of the usual method of quadratures, as found in
Gregory and Mercator, one obtains arcsin x = x + x3/6 + 3x5/40 + 5x7/112
+ ⋯ (or, allowing for the negative slope and the constant of
integration, arccos x = π/2 − x − x3/6 − 3x5/40 − 5x7/112 − ⋯). Newton,
too, had arrived at this result earlier and by a similar method. From
this, it was possible to find the series for sinx by the process known
as reversion, a scheme apparently first used by Newton but rediscovered
by Leibniz. If we let y = arcsinx or x = siny and for x assume a power
series of the form x = a1y + a2y2 + a3y3 + ⋯ + anyn + ⋯, then, on
replacing each x in the power series for arcsin x by this series in y,
we have an identity in y. From this, the quantities a1, a2, a3, . . .,
an, . . .are determined by equating coefficients of terms of like
degree. The resulting series, sin y = y − y3/3! + y5/5! − ⋯, was
therefore known to both Newton and Leibniz, and through sin2y + cos2y =
1, the series for cosy was obtained. The quotient of the sine and cosine
series provides the tangent series, and their reciprocals give the other
three trigonometric functions as infinite series. In the same way,
through reversion of Mercator’s series, Newton and Leibniz found the
series for ex.</p>

<p>The Differential Calculus</p>
<p>By 1676, Leibniz had arrived at the same conclusion that Newton had
reached several years earlier, namely, that he was in possession of a
method that was highly important because of its generality. Whether a
function was rational or irrational, algebraic or transcendental (a word
that Leibniz coined), his operations of finding sums and differences
could always be applied. It therefore was incumbent on him to develop an
appropriate language and notation for the new subject. Leibniz always
had a keen appreciation of the importance of good notations as a help to
thought, and his choice in the case of the calculus was especially
happy. After some trial and error, he fixed on dx and dy for the
smallest possible differences (differentials) in x and y, although,
initially, he had used instead x/d and y/d to indicate the lowering of
the degree. At first, he wrote simply omn. y (or “all y’s”) for the sum
of the ordinates under a curve, but later he used the symbol ∫ y and
still later ∫ ydx, the integral sign being an enlarged letter s for sum.
Finding tangents called for the use of the calculus differentialis, and
finding quadratures required the calculus summatorius or the calculus
integralis; from these phrases arose our words “differential calculus”
and “integral calculus.”</p>
<p>The first account of the differential calculus was published by
Leibniz in 1684 under the long but significant title of Nova Methodus
pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus, qua nec Irrationales
Quantitates Moratur (A New Method for Maxima and Minima, and Also for
Tangents, which Is Not Obstructed by Irrational Quantities). Here
Leibniz gave the formulas dxy = x dy + y dx, d(x/y) = (y dx − x dy)/y2,
and dxn = nxn−1 dx for products, quotients, and powers (or roots),
together with geometric applications. These formulas were derived by
neglecting infinitesimals of higher order. If, for example, the smallest
differences in x and y are dx and dy, respectively, then dxy or the
smallest difference in xy is (x + dx) (y + dy) − xy. Inasmuch as dx and
dy are infinitely small, the term dx dy is infinitely infinitely small
and can be disregarded, giving the result dxy = x dy + y dx.</p>
<p>Two years later, again in the Acta Eruditorum, Leibniz published an
explanation of the integral calculus in which quadratures are shown to
be special cases of the inverse method of tangents. Here Leibniz
emphasized the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration in the fundamental theorem of the calculus; he pointed out
that in the integration of familiar functions “is included the greatest
part of all transcendental geometry.” Where Descartes’ geometry had once
excluded all nonalgebraic curves, the calculus of Newton and Leibniz
showed how essential is the role of these in their new analysis. Were
one to exclude transcendental functions from the new analysis, there
would be no integrals of such algebraic functions as 1/x or 1/(1 + x2).
Moreover, Leibniz seems to have appreciated, as did Newton, that the
operations in the new analysis can be applied to infinite series, as
well as to finite algebraic expressions. In this respect, Leibniz was
less cautious than Newton, for he argued that the infinite series l − l
+ l − l + 1− . . . is equal to . In the light of recent work on
divergent series, we cannot say that it is necessarily “wrong” to assign
the “sum” in this case. It is nevertheless clear that Leibniz allowed
himself to be carried away by the very success of his algorithms and was
not deterred by uncertainty over concepts. Newton’s reasoning was far
closer to the modern foundations of the calculus than was that of
Leibniz, but the plausibility of the Leibnizian view and the
effectiveness of the differential notation made for a readier acceptance
of differentials than of fluxions.</p>
<p>Newton and Leibniz both developed their new analysis rapidly to
include differentials and fluxions of higher order, as in the case of
the formula for curvature of a curve at a point. It probably was lack of
clarity on Leibniz’s part about higher orders of infinitesimals that led
him to the mistaken conclusion that an osculating circle has four
“consecutive” or coincident points of contact with a curve, rather than
the three that determine the circle of curvature.</p>
<p>The formula for the nth derivative (to use the modern language) of a
product, (uv)(n) = u(n)v(0) + nu(n−1)v(1) + ⋯ + nu(1)v(n−1) + u(0)v(n),
a development paralleling the binomial expansion of (u + v)n, bears the
name of Leibniz. (In the Leibnizian theorem, the exponents in
parentheses indicate orders of differentiation, rather than powers.)
Also named for Leibniz is the rule, given in a memoir of 1692, for
finding the envelope of a one-parameter family of plane curves f(x, y,
c) = 0 through the elimination of c from the simultaneous equations f =
0 and fc = 0, where fc is the result of differentiating f partially with
respect to c.</p>
<p>The name of Leibniz is also usually attached to the infinite series ,
one of his first discoveries in mathematics. This series, which arose in
his quadrature of the circle, is only a special case of the arctangent
expansion that had been given earlier by Gregory. The fact that Leibniz
was virtually self-taught in mathematics accounts in part for the
frequent cases of rediscovery that appear in his work.</p>
<p>Determinants, Notations, and Imaginary Numbers</p>
<p>Leibniz’s great contribution to mathematics was the calculus, but
other aspects of his work deserve mention. The generalization of the
binomial theorem to the multinomial theorem—the expansion of such
expressions as (x + y + z)n—is attributed to him, as is also the first
reference in the Western world to the method of determinants. In
Leibniz’s letters to G. F. A. de L’Hospital in 1693, he wrote that he
occasionally used numbers indicating rows and columns in a set of
simultaneous equations:</p>
<p>We would write this as</p>
<p>If the equations are consistent, then</p>
<p>which is equivalent to the modern statement that</p>
<p>Leibniz’s anticipation of determinants went unpublished until 1850
and had to be rediscovered more than half a century later.</p>
<p>Leibniz was very conscious of the power in analysis of
“characteristic” or notation that properly displays the elements of a
given situation. Evidently, he thought highly of this contribution to
notation because of its easy generalization, and he boasted that he
showed that “Viète and Descartes hadn’t yet discovered all the
mysteries” of analysis. Leibniz was, in fact, one of the greatest of all
notation builders, being second only to Euler in this respect. It was in
large part due to Leibniz and Newton that the = sign of Recorde
triumphed over the symbol ∝ of Descartes. To Leibniz, we also owe the
symbols ∼ for “is similar to” and for “is congruent to.” Nevertheless,
Leibniz’s symbols for differentials and integrals remain his greatest
triumphs in the field of notation.</p>
<p>Among relatively minor contributions by Leibniz were his comments on
complex numbers, at a time when they were almost forgotten, and his
noting of the binary system of numeration. He factored x4 + a4 into</p>
<p>and he showed that , an imaginary decomposition of a positive real
number that surprised his contemporaries. Yet Leibniz did not write the
square roots of complex numbers in standard complex form, nor was he
able to prove his conjecture that is real if f(z) is a real polynomial.
The ambivalent status of complex numbers is well illustrated by the
remark of Leibniz, who was also a prominent theologian, that imaginary
numbers are a sort of amphibian, halfway between existence and
nonexistence, resembling in this respect the Holy Ghost in Christian
theology. His theology obtruded itself again in his view of the binary
system in arithmetic (in which only two symbols, unity and zero, are
used) as a symbol of the creation in which God, represented by unity,
drew all things from nothingness. He was so pleased with the idea that
he wrote about it to the Jesuits, who had missionaries in China, hoping
that they might use the analogy to convert the scientifically inclined
Chinese emperor to Christianity.</p>
<p>The Algebra of Logic</p>
<p>Leibniz was a philosopher, as well as a mathematician; his most
significant mathematical contribution, other than the calculus, was in
logic. In the calculus, it was the element of universality that
impressed him, and so it was with his other efforts. He hoped to reduce
all things to order. To reduce logical discussions to systematic form,
he wished to develop a universal characteristic that would serve as a
sort of algebra of logic. His first mathematical paper had been a thesis
on combinatorial analysis in 1666, and even at this early date, he had
visions of a formal symbolic logic. Universal symbols or ideograms were
to be introduced for the small number of fundamental concepts needed in
thought, and composite ideas were to be made up from this “alphabet” of
human thoughts, just as formulas are developed in mathematics. The
syllogism itself was to be reduced to a sort of calculus expressed in a
universal symbolism intelligible in all languages. Truth and error would
then be simply a matter of correct or erroneous calculation within the
system, and there would be an end to philosophical controversies.
Moreover, new discoveries could be derived through correct but more or
less routine operations on the symbols, according to the rules of the
logical calculus. Leibniz was justifiably proud of this idea, but his
own enthusiasm for it was not matched by that of others. Leibniz’s
optimism today appears to have been unwarranted, but his suggestion of
an algebra of logic developed in his own thinking over the years and was
revived in the nineteenth century. Since then, it has played a very
significant role in mathematics.</p>
<p>Leibniz as Scientist and Supporter of Science</p>
<p>Leibniz was also a scientist, and he and Huygens developed the notion
of kinetic energy, which ultimately, in the nineteenth century, became
part of the broader concept of energy in general—one that Leibniz would
most certainly have applauded for its universality. Among his general
contributions to the progress of science and mathematics in the
eighteenth century, his impact on the establishment of two major
scientific academies of Europe cannot be underrated. These were the
Prussian Academy of Science, founded in Berlin in 1710, and the Russian
Academy, founded during the decade after Leibniz’s death.</p>
<p>The Bernoulli Family</p>
<p>The discoveries of a great mathematician do not automatically become
part of the mathematical tradition. They may be lost to the world unless
other scholars understand them and take enough interest to look at them
from various points of view, clarify and generalize them, and point out
their implications. Newton, unfortunately, was hypersensitive and did
not communicate freely, and, consequently, the method of fluxions was
not well known outside of England. Leibniz, on the other hand, appeared
to take pleasure in alerting others to the power of his methods and
found devoted disciples who were eager to learn about the differential
and the integral calculus and to transmit the knowledge further.
Foremost among the enthusiasts were two Swiss brothers, Jacques
Bernoulli (1654–1705) and Jean Bernoulli (1667–1748), who were often
also known by the Anglicized forms of their names, James and John (or by
the German equivalents Jakob and Johann); each was as quick to offend as
to feel offended. No family in the history of mathematics has produced
as many celebrated mathematicians as did the Bernoulli family, which,
unnerved by the Spanish Fury in 1576, had fled to Basel from the
Catholic Spanish Netherlands in 1583. Some dozen members of the family
(see the genealogical chart further on) achieved distinction in
mathematics and physics, and four of them were elected foreign
associates of the Académie des Sciences.</p>
<p>The first to attain prominence in mathematics was Jacques Bernoulli.
He was born and died in Basel, but he traveled widely to meet scholars
in other countries. His interest had been directed toward infinitesimals
by works of Wallis and Barrow, and the papers of Leibniz in 1684–1686
enabled him to master the new methods. By 1690, when he suggested the
name “integral” to Leibniz, Jacques Bernoulli was himself contributing
papers on the subject to the Acta Eruditorum. Among other things, he
pointed out that at a maximum or minimum point, the derivative of the
function need not vanish but can take on an “infinite value” or assume
an indeterminate form. Early on, he was interested in infinite series,
and in his first paper on the subject in 1689, he gave the well-known
“Bernoulli inequality” (1 + x)n &gt; 1 + nx, where x is real and x &gt;
−1 and x ≠ 0 and n is an integer greater than 1, but this can be found
earlier in the seventh lecture of Barrow’s Lectiones geometriae of 1670.
To him is frequently also attributed the demonstration that the harmonic
series is divergent, for most men were unaware of anticipations by
Oresme and Mengoli. Jacques Bernoulli believed, in fact, that his
brother had been the first to observe the divergence of the harmonic
series.</p>
<p>The mathematical Bernoullis: a genealogical chart</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by the series of reciprocals of the
figurate numbers, and although he knew that the series of reciprocals of
the perfect squares is convergent, he was unable to find the sum of the
series. Inasmuch as the terms of</p>
<p>are, term for term, less than or equal to those of</p>
<p>and the latter series was known to converge to 2, it was clear to
Bernoulli that the former must converge.</p>
<p>A frequent correspondent with other mathematicians of the day,
Jacques Bernoulli was au courant with the popular problems, many of
which he solved independently. Among these were finding the equations of
the catenary, the tractrix, and the isochrone, all of which had been
treated by Huygens and Leibniz. The isochrone called for the equation of
a plane curve along which an object would fall with uniform vertical
velocity, and Bernoulli showed that the required curve is the
semicubical parabola. It was in connection with such problems that the
Bernoulli brothers discovered the power of the calculus, and they
remained in touch with Leibniz on all aspects of the new subject.
Jacques Bernoulli, in his work on the isochrone in the Acta Eruditorum
for 1690, used the word “integral,” and a few years later, Leibniz
agreed that calculus integralis would be a better name than calculus
summatorius for the inverse of the calculus differentialis. To
differential equations, Jacques Bernoulli contributed the study of the
“Bernoulli equation” y’ + P(x)y = Q(x)yn that he and Leibniz and Jean
Bernoulli solved—Jean by reducing it to a linear equation through the
substitution z = y1−n. Leibniz and the Bernoullis were seeking a
solution to the brachistochrone problem. Jean had first found an
incorrect proof that the curve is a cycloid, but after he challenged his
brother to discover the required curve, Jacques correctly proved that
the curve sought is a cycloid.</p>
<p>The Logarithmic Spiral</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by curves and the calculus, and one
curve bears his name—the “lemniscate of Bernoulli,” given by the polar
equation r2 = a cos 2θ. The curve was described in the Acta Eruditorum
of 1694 as resembling a figure eight or a knotted ribbon (lemniscus).
Yet the curve that most caught his fancy was the logarithmic spiral.
Bernoulli showed that it had several striking properties not noted
earlier: (1) the evolute of a logarithmic spiral is an equal logarithmic
spiral; (2) the pedal curve of a logarithmic spiral with respect to its
pole (that is, the locus of the projections of the pole on the tangents
to the given curve) is an equal logarithmic spiral; (3) the caustic by
reflection for rays emanating from the pole (that is, the envelope of
the rays reflected at points on the given curve) is an equal logarithmic
spiral; and (4) the caustic by refraction for rays emanating from the
pole (that is, the envelope of rays refracted at points on the curve) is
an equal logarithmic spiral. These properties led him to request that
the spira mirabilis be engraved on his tombstone, together with the
inscription “Eadem mutata resurgo” (“Though changed, I arise again the
same”).</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli had been led to spirals of a different type when he
repeated Cavalieri’s procedure in bending half of the parabola x2 = ay
about the origin to produce a spiral of Archimedes, but whereas
Cavalieri had studied the transformation by essentially synthetic
methods, Bernoulli used rectangular and polar coordinates. Newton had
used polar coordinates earlier—perhaps as early as 1671—but priority in
publication seems to go to Bernoulli, who in the Acta Eruditorum for
1691 proposed measuring abscissas along the arc of a fixed circle and
ordinates radially along the normals. Three years later, in the same
journal, he proposed a modification that agreed with the system of
Newton. The coordinate y now was the length of the radius vector of the
point, and x was the arc cut off by the sides of the vectorial angle on
a circle of radius a described about the pole as center. These
coordinates are essentially what we would now write as (r, aθ).
Bernoulli, like Newton, was interested primarily in applications of the
system to the calculus; hence, he, too, derived formulas for arc length
and radius of curvature in polar coordinates.</p>
<p>Probability and Infinite Series</p>
<p>The mathematical contributions of the Bernoullis, like those of
Leibniz, are found chiefly in articles in journals, especially the Acta
Eruditorum, but Jacques Bernoulli also wrote a classical treatise titled
Ars Conjectandi (or Art of Conjecturing), published in 1713, eight years
after the author’s death. This is the earliest substantial volume on the
theory of probability, for Huygens’s De Ludo Aleae had been only a brief
introduction. The treatise of Huygens is, in fact, reproduced as the
first of the four parts of the Ars Conjectandi, together with a
commentary by Bernoulli. The second part of the Ars Conjectandi includes
a general theory of permutations and combinations, facilitated by the
binomial and multinomial theorems. Here we find the first adequate proof
of the binomial theorem for positive integral powers. The proof is by
mathematical induction, a method of approach that Bernoulli had
rediscovered while reading the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis and
that he had published in the Acta Eruditorum in 1686. He gave Pascal
credit for the binomial theorem with general exponent, but this
attribution appears to be gratuitous. Newton seems to have first stated
the theorem in general form for any rational exponent, although he gave
no proof, this being supplied later by Euler. In connection with the
expansion of (1 + 1/n)n, Jacques Bernoulli proposed the problem of the
continuous compounding of interest, that is, finding , because</p>
<p>it was clear to him that the limit existed.</p>
<p>The second part of the Ars Conjectandi also contains the “Bernoulli
numbers.” These arose as coefficients in a recursion formula for the
sums of the powers of the integers, and they now find many applications
in other connections. The formula was written by Bernoulli as
follows:</p>
<p>where ∫nc means the sum of the cth powers of the first n positive
integers and the letters A, B, C, . . . (the Bernoulli numbers) are the
coefficients of the term in n (the last term) in the corresponding
expressions for ∫ n2, ∫ n4, ∫ n6, . . . (The numbers can also be defined
as n! times the coefficients of the even-powered terms in the Maclaurin
expansion of the function x/(ex − 1).) The Bernoulli numbers are useful
in writing the infinite series expansions of trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions. The first three of the numbers are readily
verified as , and .</p>
<p>The third and fourth parts of the Ars Conjectandi are devoted
primarily to problems illustrating the theory of probability. The fourth
and last part contains the celebrated theorem that now bears the
author’s name and on which Bernoulli and Leibniz had corresponded: the
so-called law of large numbers. This states that if p is the probability
of an event, if m is the number of occurrences of the event in n trials,
if ε is an arbitrarily small positive number, and if P is the
probability that the inequality is satisfied, then .</p>
<p>Appended to the Ars Conjectandi is a long memoir on infinite series.
Besides the harmonic series and the sum of the reciprocals of the
perfect squares, Bernoulli considered the series</p>
<p>He knew (by comparing the terms with those in the harmonic series)
that this diverges, and he pointed to the paradox that the ratio of the
“sum” of all of the odd terms to the “sum” of all of the even terms is
as is to 1, from which the sum of all of the odd terms appears to be
less than the sum of all of the even terms, but this is impossible
because, term for term, the former are larger than the latter.</p>
<p>L’Hospital’s Rule</p>
<p>While Jean Bernoulli was in Paris in 1692, he instructed a young
French marquis, G. F. A. de L’Hospital (1661–1704), in the new
Leibnizian discipline, and Jean Bernoulli signed a pact under which, in
return for a regular salary, he agreed to send L’Hospital his
discoveries in mathematics, to be used as the marquis might wish. The
result was that one of Bernoulli’s chief contributions, dating from
1694, has ever since been known as L’Hospital’s rule on indeterminate
forms. Jean Bernoulli had found that if f(x) and g(x) are functions
differentiable at x = a such that f(a) = 0 and g(a) = 0 and</p>
<p>exists, then</p>
<p>This well-known rule was incorporated by L’Hospital in the first
textbook on the differential calculus to appear in print—Analyse des
infiniment petits, published in Paris in 1696. This book, the influence
of which dominated most of the eighteenth century, is based on two
postulates: (1) that one can take as equal two quantities that differ
only by an infinitely small quantity; and (2) that a curve can be
considered as made up of infinitely small straight line segments that
determine, by the angles they make with each other, the curvature of the
curve. These would today scarcely be regarded as acceptable, but
L’Hospital considered them “so self-evident as not to leave the least
scruple about their truth and certainty on the mind of an attentive
reader.” The basic differential formulas for algebraic functions are
derived in the manner of Leibniz, and applications are made to tangents,
maxima and minima, points of inflection, curvature, caustics, and
indeterminate forms. L’Hospital was an exceptionally effective writer,
for his Traité analytique des sections coniques, published posthumously
in 1707, did for analytic geometry of the eighteenth century what the
Analyse did for the calculus.</p>
<p>Exponential Calculus</p>
<p>The recent publication of the Bernoulli-L’Hospital correspondence
indicates that much of the work evidently was due to Bernoulli.
Nevertheless, some of the material in the Analyse was undoubtedly the
result of L’Hospital’s independent work, for he was a capable
mathematician. The rectification of the logarithmic curve, for example,
seems to have appeared for the first time in 1692 in a letter from
L’Hospital to Leibniz. Bernoulli did not publish his own textbook on the
differential calculus (which was finally printed in 1924), and the text
on the integral calculus appeared fifty years after it had been
written—in his Opera Omnia of 1742. In the interval, Jean Bernoulli
wrote prolifically on many advanced aspects of analysis—the isochrone,
solids of least resistance, the catenary, the tractrix, trajectories,
caustic curves, isoperimetric problems—achieving a reputation that led
to his being called to Basel in 1705 to fill the chair left vacant by
his brother’s death. He is frequently regarded as the inventor of the
calculus of variations, because of his proposal in 1696–1697 of the
problem of the brachistochrone, and he contributed to differential
geometry through his work on geodesic lines on a surface. To him is also
often ascribed the exponential calculus, for he studied not only the
simple exponential curves y = ax, but general exponentials such as y =
xx. For the area under the curve y = xx from x = 0 to x = 1, he found
the striking infinite series representation</p>
<p>This result he obtained by writing xx = exlnx, expanding this in the
exponential series, and integrating term by term, using integration by
parts.</p>
<p>Logarithms of Negative Numbers</p>
<p>Jean and Jacques Bernoulli rediscovered the series for sin nθ and cos
nθ, in terms of sin θ and cos θ, which Viète had known, and they
extended them, uncritically, to include fractional values of n. Jean was
also aware of relationships between inverse trigonometric functions and
imaginary logarithms, discovering in 1702, through differential
equations, the relationship</p>
<p>He corresponded with other mathematicians on the logarithms of
negative numbers, but here he mistakenly believed that log (−n) = log
n. He tended to develop trigonometry and the theory of logarithms from
an analytic point of view, and he experimented with several notations
for a function of x, the one nearest to the modern being ϕx. His vague
notion of a function was expressed as “a quantity composed in any manner
of a variable and any constants.” Among his numerous controversies was
one with British mathematicians over whether the well-known series of
Brook Taylor (1685–1731), published in the Methodus incrementorum of
1715, was a plagiarism of the Bernoulli series</p>
<p>Neither Bernoulli nor Taylor was aware that both had been anticipated
by Gregory in the discovery of “Taylor’s series.”</p>
<p>Petersburg Paradox</p>
<p>Jean Bernoulli maintained a zeal for mathematics as lively as was his
persistence in controversy. Moreover, he was the father of three sons,
Nicolaus (1695–1726), Daniel (1700–1782), and Jean II (1710–1790), all
of whom at some stage filled a position as professor of mathematics:
Nicolaus and Daniel at St. Petersburg and Daniel and Jean II at Basel.
(Another Nicolaus (1687–1759), a cousin of the one mentioned previously,
for a time held the chair in mathematics at Padua that Galileo once had
filled.) There were still other Bernoullis who attained some eminence in
mathematics, but of these, none achieved fame comparable to that of the
original two brothers, Jacques and Jean. The most celebrated of the
younger generation was Daniel, whose work in hydrodynamics is recalled
in “Bernoulli’s principle.” In mathematics, he is best known for his
distinction, in the theory of probability, between mathematical
expectation and “moral expectation,” or between “physical fortune” and
“moral fortune.” He assumed that a small increase in a person’s material
means causes an increase in satisfaction that is inversely proportional
to the means. In the form of an equation, dm = K(dp/p), where m is the
moral fortune, p is the physical fortune, and K is a constant of
proportionality. This leads to the conclusion that as the physical
fortune increases geometrically, the moral fortune increases
arithmetically. In 1734, he and his father shared the prize offered by
the Académie des Sciences for an essay on probabilities related to the
inclinations of the orbital planes of the planets; in 1760, he read to
the Paris Académie a paper on the application of probability theory to
the question of the advantage of inoculation against smallpox.</p>
<p>When Daniel Bernoulli went to St. Petersburg in 1725, his older
brother was also called there as professor of mathematics; in the
discussions of the two men, there arose a problem that has come to be
known as the “Petersburg paradox,” probably because it first appeared in
the Commentarii of the Academy there. The problem is as follows: Suppose
that Peter and Paul agree to play a game based on the toss of a coin. If
a head is thrown on the first toss, Paul will give Peter one crown; if
the first toss is a tail, but a head appears on the second toss, Paul
will give Peter two crowns; if a head appears for the first time on the
third toss, Paul will give Peter four crowns, and so on, the amount to
be paid if head appears for the first time on the nth toss being 2n−1
crowns. What should Peter pay Paul for the privilege of playing the
game? Peter’s mathematical expectation, given by</p>
<p>evidently is infinite, yet common sense suggests a very modest finite
sum. When Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707–1788), made an
empirical test of the matter, he found that in 2084 games Paul would
have paid Peter 10,057 crowns. This indicates that for any one game,
Paul’s expectation, instead of being infinite, is actually something
less than 5 crowns! The paradox raised in the Petersburg problem was
widely discussed during the eighteenth century, with differing
explanations being given. Daniel Bernoulli sought to resolve it through
his principle of moral expectation, in accordance with which he replaced
the amounts 1, 2, 22, 23, . . .2n, . . .by . Others preferred, as a
solution of the paradox, to point out that the problem is inherently
impossible in view of the fact that Paul’s fortune is necessarily
finite; hence, he could not pay the unlimited sums that might be
required in the case of a long delay in the appearance of a head.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus Transformations</p>
<p>Continental Europe had not escaped controversy over the foundations
of the calculus, but there the effect was felt less than in England. As
early as in Leibniz’s day, objections to the new analysis had been
raised by a Saxon nobleman, Count Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus
(1651–1708). His name is still perpetuated in the “Tschirnhaus
transformations” in algebra, by which he hoped to find a general method
for solving equations of higher degree. A Tschirnhaus transformation of
a polynomial equation f(x) = 0 is one of the form y = g(x)/h(x), where g
and h are polynomials and h does not vanish for a root of f(x) = 0. The
transformations by which Cardan and Viète solved the cubic were special
cases of such transformations. In the Acta Eruditorum of 1683,
Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhausen) showed that a polynomial of degree n &gt;
2 can be reduced by his transformations to a form in which the
coefficients of the terms of degrees n − 1 and n − 2 are both zero; for
the cubic, he found a transformation of the form y = x2 + ax + b, which
reduced the general cubic to the form y3 = K.</p>
<p>Another such transformation reduced the quartic to y4 + py2 + q = 0,
thus adding new methods of solving the cubic and the quartic.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus hoped to develop similar algorithms that would reduce the
general equation of nth degree to a “pure” equation of nth degree
containing only the terms of degree n and degree zero. His
transformations constituted the most promising contribution to the
solution of equations during the seventeenth century, but his
elimination of the second and third coefficients by means of such
transformations was far from adequate for the solution of the quintic.
Even when the Swedish mathematician E. S. Bring (1736–1798) showed in
1786 that a Tschirnhaus transformation can be found that reduces the
general quintic to the form y5 + py + q = 0, the solution still remained
elusive. In 1834, G. B. Jerrard (1804–1863), a Briton, showed that a
Tschirnhaus transformation can be found that will eliminate the terms of
degrees n − 1 and n − 2 and n − 3 from any polynomial equation of degree
n &gt; 3, but the power of the method is limited by the fact that
equations of the fifth and higher degree are not solvable algebraically.
Jerrard’s belief that he could solve all algebraic equations was
illusory.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus is noted as the discoverer of caustics by reflection
(catacaustics), which bear his name. It was his report on these curves,
the envelopes of a family of rays from a point source and reflected in a
curve, that resulted in his election in 1682 to the Paris Académie des
Sciences, and interest in caustics and similar families was continued by
Leibniz, L’Hospital, Jacques and Jean Bernoulli, and others. His name is
also attached to the “Tschirnhaus cubic” a = r cos3θ/3, a form later
generalized by Maclaurin to rn = a cos nθ for n rational.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus had been in touch with Oldenburg and Leibniz during the
formative years of the calculus, and he had also contributed many
mathematical articles to the Acta Eruditorum after its establishment in
1682. Some of Tschirnhaus’s work, however, was hastily composed and
published prematurely, and the Bernoulli brothers and others pointed out
errors. At one point, Tschirnhaus rejected the basic concepts of the
calculus and of infinite series, insisting that algebraic methods would
suffice. In Holland, objections to the calculus of Leibniz had been
raised in 1694–1696 by the physician and geometer Bernard Nieuwentijt
(1654–1718). In three separate treatises published during these years in
Amsterdam, he admitted the correctness of the results, but he criticized
the vagueness of Newton’s evanescent quantities and the lack of clear
definition in Leibniz’s differentials of higher order.</p>
<p>Solid Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>In 1695, Leibniz had defended himself in the Acta Eruditorum from his
“overprecise” critic, and in 1701, a more detailed refutation of
Nieuwentijt came from Switzerland from the pen of Jacob Hermann
(1678–1733), a devoted pupil of Jacques Bernoulli. Illustrating the
mobility of mathematicians during the early eighteenth century, Hermann
taught mathematics at the Universities of Padua, Frankfort on the Oder,
and St. Petersburg before concluding his career at the University of
Basel, his hometown. In the Commentarii Academiae Petropolitanae for the
years 1729–1733, Hermann made contributions to solid analytic geometry
and to polar coordinates in continuation of results made by the older
Bernoulli brothers. Where Jacques Bernoulli had rather hesitantly
applied polar coordinates to spirals, Hermann gave polar equations of
algebraic curves as well, together with equations of transformation from
rectangular to polar coordinates. Hermann’s use of space coordinates was
also bolder than that of Jean Bernoulli, who as early as 1692 had first
referred to the use of coordinates as “Cartesian geometry.” Bernoulli
had rather timidly suggested an extension of Cartesian geometry to three
dimensions, but Hermann effectively applied space coordinates to planes
and several types of quadratic surfaces. He made a beginning in the use
of direction angles by showing that the sine of the angle that the plane
az + by + cx = c2 makes with the xy-plane is given by</p>
<p>Michel Rolle and Pierre Varignon</p>
<p>In France, as well as in England, Germany, and Holland, there was a
group in the Académie des Sciences, especially shortly after 1700, that
questioned the validity of the new infinitesimal methods as presented by
L’Hospital. Among these was Michel Rolle (1652–1719), whose name is
recalled in connection with Rolle’s theorem, published in 1691 in an
obscure book on geometry and algebra titled Méthode pour résoudre les
égalitéz: If a function is differentiable in the interval from a to b,
and if f(a) = 0 = f(b), then f′(x) = 0 has at least one real root
between a and b. The theorem, now so important in the calculus, was
given only incidentally by Rolle in connection with an approximate
solution of equations.</p>
<p>Rolle’s attack on the calculus, which he described as a collection of
ingenious fallacies, was answered vigorously by Pierre Varignon
(1654–1722), Jean Bernoulli’s “best friend in France” and one who had
also been corresponding with Leibniz. Bernoulli simply told Rolle that
he did not understand the subject, but Varignon sought to clarify the
situation by showing indirectly that the infinitesimal methods could be
reconciled with the geometry of Euclid. Most of the group opposing the
calculus were admirers of the ancient synthetic geometry, and the
controversy in the Académie des Sciences reminds one of the then
contemporary literary controversy on “ancients vs. moderns.”</p>
<p>Varignon, like the Bernoullis, had not at first expected to be a
mathematician, being intended for the church, but when he accidentally
came across a copy of Euclid’s Elements, he changed his mind and held
professorships in mathematics in Paris, becoming a member of the
Académie. In the Memoirs of the Académie des Sciences for 1704, he
continued and extended Jacques Bernoulli’s use of polar coordinates,
including an elaborate classification of spirals obtained from algebraic
curves, such as the parabolas and the hyperbolas of Fermat, by
interpreting the ordinate as a radius vector and the abscissa as a
vectorial arc. Varignon, one of the first French scholars to appreciate
the calculus, had prepared a commentary on L’Hospital’s Analyse, but
this appeared only in 1725, after both men had died, under the title
Eclaircissemens sur l’analyse des infiniments petits. Varignon was a
more careful writer than L’Hospital, and he warned that infinite series
were not to be used without investigation of the remainder term. Hence,
he had been rather worried about the attacks on the calculus, and in
1701, he had written to Leibniz about his differences with Rolle:</p>
<p>The Abbé Galloys, who is really behind the whole thing, is spreading
the report here [in Paris] that you have explained that you mean by the
“differential” or the “infinitely small” a very small, but nevertheless
constant and definite, quantity. . .. I, on the other hand, have called
a thing infinitely small, or the differential of a quantity, if that
quantity is inexhaustible in comparison with the thing.</p>
<p>The view that Varignon expressed here is far from clear, but at least
he recognized that a differential is a variable, rather than a constant.
Leibniz’s reply from Hanover in 1702 seeks to avoid metaphysical
quarrels, but his use of the phrase “incomparably small quantities” for
differentials was scarcely more satisfactory than Varignon’s
explanation. Varignon’s defense of the calculus nevertheless seems to
have won Rolle’s approval.</p>
<p>Rolle had also raised embarrassing questions about analytic geometry,
especially concerning the Cartesian graphical solution of equations, so
popular at the time. To solve f(x) = 0, for example, one arbitrarily
chose a curve g(x, y) = 0 and, on combining it with f(x) = 0, obtained a
new curve h(x, y) = 0 the intersections of which with g(x, y) = 0
furnish the solutions of f(x) = 0. Rolle saw that extraneous solutions
may be introduced through this procedure. In his best-known work, the
Traité d’algèbre of 1690, Rolle seems to have been first to state that
there are n values for the nth root of a number, but he was able to
prove this only for n = 3, for he died before the relevant works of
Cotes and De Moivre appeared.</p>
<p>Rolle was the most capable mathematician in the group from the
Académie des Sciences that criticized the calculus. When he was
convinced by Varignon of the essential soundness of the new analysis,
opposition collapsed, and the subject entered a century of unimpeded and
rapid development on the continent of Europe. An outstanding example of
how much a talented and dedicated member of a later generation could
achieve using the new methods is provided by Alexis Clairaut.</p>
<p>The Clairauts</p>
<p>Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713–1765) was one of the most precocious of
mathematicians, outdoing even Blaise Pascal in this respect. At the age
of ten, he was reading the textbooks of L’Hospital on conics and the
calculus; when he was thirteen, he read a paper on geometry to the
Académie des Sciences; and when only eighteen, he was admitted, through
special dispensation with respect to age requirements, to membership in
the Académie. In the year of his election, Clairaut published a
celebrated treatise, Recherches sur les courbes à double courbure, the
substance of which had been presented to the Académie two years earlier.
Like the Géométrie of Descartes, the Recherches of Clairaut appeared
without the name of the author on the title page, although in this case,
too, the authorship was generally known. The treatise of Clairaut
carried out for space curves the program that Descartes had suggested
almost a century earlier—their study through projections on two
coordinate planes. It was, in fact, this method that suggested the name
given by Clairaut to gauche or twisted curves, inasmuch as their
curvature is determined by the curvatures of the two projections. In the
Recherches, numerous space curves are determined through intersections
of various surfaces, distance formulas for two and three dimensions are
explicitly given, an intercept form of the plane is included, and
tangent lines to space curves are found. This book by the teenage
Clairaut constitutes the first treatise on solid analytic geometry. He
observed that the mixed second-order partial derivatives fxy and fyx of
a function f(x, y) are in general equal (we know now that this holds if
these derivatives are continuous at the point in question), and he used
this fact in the test , familiar in differential equations, for
exactness of the differential expression M(x, y)dx + N(x, y)dy. In
celebrated works on applied mathematics, such as Théorie de la figure de
la terre (1743) and Théorie de la lune (1752), he made use of potential
theory. His textbooks, Eléments de géométrie and Eléments d’algèbre,
were part of a plan, reminiscent of those of our own day, to improve the
teaching of mathematics.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Clairaut had a younger brother who rivaled him in
precocity, for at the age of fifteen, the brother, known to history only
as “le cadet Clairaut,” published in 1731 (the same year as that in
which the older brother’s Recherches had appeared) a book on calculus
titled Traité de quadratures circulaires et hyperboliques. This
virtually unknown genius died tragically of smallpox during the next
year. The father of the two Clairaut brothers was himself a capable
mathematician, but today he is recalled primarily through the work of
his sons.</p>
<p>Mathematics in Italy</p>
<p>While the Bernoullis and their associates were defending and
espousing developments in analytic geometry, the calculus, and
probability, mathematics in Italy flowed along more or less
unobtrusively with some preference for geometry. No outstanding figure
appeared there, although several men left results important enough to be
noted. Giovanni Ceva (1648–1734) is recalled today for the theorem that
bears his name: A necessary and sufficient condition that lines from the
vertices A, B, C of a triangle to points X, Y, Z on the opposite sides
be concurrent is that</p>
<p>This is closely related to the theorem of Menelaus, which had been
forgotten but was rediscovered and also published by Ceva in 1678.</p>
<p>More closely related to the interests of the Bernoullis were the
contributions of Jacopo Riccati (1676–1754), who made Newton’s work
known in Italy. Riccati is especially remembered for his extensive study
of the differential equation dy/dx = A(x) + B(x)y + C(x)y2, now bearing
his name, although Jacques Bernoulli had earlier studied the special
case dy/dx = x2 + y2. Riccati may have known of this study, for Nicolaus
Bernoulli taught at Padua, where Riccati had been a student of Angeli’s
and where Riccati came in contact with both Nicolaus Bernoulli and
Hermann. The work of the Bernoullis was well known in Italy. Count G. C.
Fagnano (1682–1766) followed up work on the lemniscate of Bernoulli to
show, around 1717–1718, that the rectification of this curve leads to an
elliptic integral, as does the arc length of the ellipse, although
certain arcs are rectifiable by elementary means. Fagnano’s name is
still attached to the ellipse x2 + 2y2 = 1, which presents certain
analogies to the equilateral or rectangular hyperbola. The eccentricity
of this ellipse, for example, is , whereas the eccentricity of the
rectangular hyperbola is .</p>
<p>The Parallel Postulate</p>
<p>Italian mathematicians during the eighteenth century made few, if
any, fundamental discoveries. The nearest approach to such a discovery
undoubtedly was that of Girolamo Saccheri (1667–1733), a Jesuit who
taught at colleges of his order in Italy. In the very year in which he
died, he published a book titled Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus
(Euclid Cleared of Every Flaw), in which he made an elaborate effort to
prove the parallel postulate. Saccheri had known of Nasir Eddin
al-Tusi’s efforts to prove the postulate almost half a millennium
earlier, and he determined to apply the method of reductio ad absurdum
to the problem. He began with a birectangular isosceles quadrilateral,
now known as a “Saccheri quadrilateral”—one having sides AD and BC equal
to each other and both perpendicular to the base AB. Without using the
parallel postulate, he easily showed that the “summit” angles C and D
are equal and that there are, then, just three possibilities for these
angles, described by Saccheri as (1) the hypothesis of the acute angle,
(2) the hypothesis of the right angle, and (3) the hypothesis of the
obtuse angle. By showing that hypotheses 1 and 3 lead to absurdities, he
thought by indirect reasoning to establish hypothesis 2 as a necessary
consequence of Euclid’s postulates other than the parallel postulate.
Saccheri had little trouble disposing of hypothesis 3, for he implicitly
assumed a straight line to be infinitely long. From hypothesis 1, he
derived theorem after theorem without encountering difficulty. Although
we know now that he was here building up a perfectly consistent
non-Euclidean geometry, Saccheri was so thoroughly imbued with the
conviction that Euclid’s was the only valid geometry that he permitted
this preconception to interfere with his logic. Where no contradiction
existed, he twisted his reasoning until he thought that hypothesis 1 led
to an absurdity. Hence, he lost credit for what would undoubtedly have
been the most significant discovery of the eighteenth
century—non-Euclidean geometry. As it was, his name remained unsung for
another century, for the importance of his work was overlooked by those
who followed him.</p>
<p>Divergent Series</p>
<p>Saccheri had as his student another Italian mathematician who
deserves brief mention—Guido Grandi (1671–1742), whose name is
remembered in the rose-petal curves so familiar in polar coordinates
through the equations r = a cos nθ and r = a sin nθ. These are known as
“roses of Grandi,” in recognition of his study of them. Grandi is also
recalled as one who had corresponded with Leibniz on the question of
whether the sum of the alternating infinite series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1
+ ⋯ can be taken to be . This is suggested not only as the arithmetic
mean of the two values of the partial sums of the first n terms, but
also as the value when x = + 1 of the generating function 1/(1 + x) from
which the series 1 − x + x2 − x3 + x4 − ⋯ is obtained through division.
In this correspondence, Grandi suggested that here, one has a paradox
comparable to the mysteries of Christianity, for on grouping terms in
pairs, one reaches the result</p>
<p>which parallels the creation of the world out of nothing.</p>
<p>Continuing such uncritical ideas to the integral of the generating
function 1/(1 + x), Leibniz and Jean Bernoulli had corresponded on the
nature of the logarithms of negative numbers. The series ln (1 + x) = x
− x2/2 + x3/3 − x4/4 + ⋯, however, is of little help here, because the
series diverges for x &lt; −1. Leibniz argued that negative numbers do
not have real logarithms, but Bernoulli, believing the logarithmic curve
to be symmetric with respect to the function axis, held that ln (−x) =
ln (x), a view that seems to be confirmed by the fact that d/dx ln (−x)
= d/dx ln (+ x) = 1/x. The question of the nature of logarithms of
negative numbers was not definitively resolved by either of the
correspondents, but rather by Bernoulli’s most brilliant student. Jean
Bernoulli had continued to exert an encouraging enthusiasm, through his
correspondence, during the first half of the eighteenth century, for he
outlived his older brother by forty-three years. Nevertheless, long
before his death in 1748, as an octogenarian, his influence had become
far less felt than that of his famous pupil Euler, whose contributions
to analysis, including the logarithms of negative numbers, were the
essential core of mathematical developments during the middle years of
the eighteenth century.</p>
