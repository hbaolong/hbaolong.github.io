<h4 id="extant-works">Extant Works</h4>
<p>Five works by Euclid have survived to our day: the Elements, the
Data, the Division of Figures, the Phaenomena, and the Optics. The
lastmentioned is of interest as an early work on perspective, or the
geometry of direct vision. The ancients had divided the study of optical
phenomena into three parts: (1) optics (the geometry of direct vision),
(2) catoptrics (the geometry of reflected rays), and (3) dioptrics (the
geometry of refracted rays). A Catoptrica sometimes ascribed to Euclid
is of doubtful authenticity, being perhaps by Theon of Alexandria, who
lived some six centuries later. Euclid’s Optics is noteworthy for its
espousal of an “emission” theory of vision, according to which the eye
sends out rays that travel to the object, in contrast to a rival
Aristotelian doctrine in which an</p>
<p>activity in a medium travels in a straight line from the object to
the eye. It should be noted that the mathematics of perspective (as
opposed to the physical description) is the same, no matter which of the
two theories is adopted. Among the theorems found in Euclid’s Optics is
one widely used in antiquity—tanα/tan β,α/β if 0,α,β,π/2. One object of
the Optics was to combat an Epicurean insistence that an object was just
as large as it looked, with no allowance to be made for the
foreshortening suggested by perspective.</p>
<p>The Euclidean Division of Figures is a work that would have been lost
had it not been for the learning of Arabic scholars. It has not survived
in the original Greek, but before the disappearance of the Greek
versions, an Arabic translation had been made (omitting some of the
original proofs “because the demonstrations are easy”), which in turn
was later translated into Latin and ultimately into current modern
languages. This is not atypical of other ancient works. The Division of
Figures includes a collection of thirty-six propositions concerning the
division of plane configurations. For example, Proposition 1 calls for
the construction of a straight line that shall be parallel to the base
of a triangle and shall divide the triangle into two equal areas.
Proposition 4 requires a bisection of a trapezoid abqd (Fig. 5.1) by a
line parallel to the bases; the required line zi is found by determining
z such that ze2 5 ðeb2 1ea2Þ. Other propositions call for the division
of a parallelogram into two equal parts by a line drawn through a given
point on one of the sides (Proposition 6) or through a given point
outside the parallelogram (Proposition 10). The final proposition asks
for the division of a quadrilateral in a given ratio by a line through a
point on one of the sides of the quadrilateral.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar in nature and purpose to the Division of Figures is
Euclid’s Data, a work that has come down to us through both the Greek
and the Arabic. It seems to have been composed for use at the Museum of
Alexandria, serving as a companion volume to the first six books of the
Elements in much the way that a manual of tables supplements a textbook.
It opens with fifteen definitions concerning magnitudes and loci. The
body of the text comprises ninety-five statements concerning the
implications of conditions and magnitudes that may be given in a
problem. The first two state that if two magnitudes a and b are
given,</p>
<p>E B D</p>
<p>A F C</p>
<p>FIG. 5.2</p>
<p>their ratio is given, and that if one magnitude is given and also its
ratio to a second, the second magnitude is given. There are about two
dozen similar statements, serving as algebraic rules or formulas. After
this, the work lays out simple geometric rules concerning parallel lines
and proportional magnitudes, while reminding the student of the
implications of the data given in a problem, such as the advice that
when two line segments have a given ratio then one knows the ratio of
the areas of similar rectilinear figures constructed on these segments.
Some of the statements are geometric equivalents of the solution of
quadratic equations. For example, we are told that if a given
(rectangular) area AB is laid off along a line segment of given length
AC (Fig. 5.2) and if the area BC by which the area AB falls short of the
entire rectangle AD is given, the dimensions of the rectangle BC are
known. The truth of this statement is easily demonstrated by modern
algebra. Let the length of AC be a, the area of AB be b2, and the ratio
of FC to CD be c:d. Then, if FC5x and CD5y, we have x/y5c/d and (a
x)y5b2. Eliminating y, we have (a2x)dx5b2c or dx2 2adx1b2c50, from which
equivalent to this, except that the negative sign before the radical is
used.p x5a=26 ða=2Þ2 2b2c=d: The geometric solution given by Euclid
is</p>
<p>Statements 84 and 85 in the Data are geometric replacements of the
familiar Babylonian algebraic solutions of the systems xy5a2, x 6 y 5b,
which again are the equivalents of solutions of simultaneous equations.
The last few statements in the Data concern relationships between linear
and angular measures in a given circle.</p>
