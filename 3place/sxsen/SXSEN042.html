<h4 id="the-academy">The Academy</h4>
<p>The fourth century BCE had opened with the death of Socrates, a
scholar who adopted the dialectic method of Zeno and repudiated the
Pythagoreanism of Archytas. Socrates admitted that in his youth, he had
been attracted by such questions as why the sum 212 was the same as the
product 232, as well as by the natural philosophy of Anaxagoras, but on
realizing that neither mathematics nor science could satisfy his desire
to know the essence of things, he gave himself up to his characteristic
search for the good.</p>
<p>In the Phaedo of Plato, the dialogue in which the last hours of
Socrates are so beautifully described, we see how deep metaphysical
doubts precluded a Socratic concern with either mathematics or natural
science:</p>
<p>I cannot satisfy myself that, when one is added to one, the one to
which the addition is made becomes two, or that the two units added
together make two by reason of the addition. I cannot understand how
when separated from the other, each of them was one and not two, and
now, when they are brought together, the mere juxtaposition or meeting
of them should be the cause of their becoming two.</p>
<p>Hence, the influence of Socrates in the development of mathematics
was negligible, if not actually negative. This makes it all the more
surprising that it was his student and admirer Plato who became the
mathematical inspiration of the fourth century BC.</p>
<p>Although Plato himself made no specific outstanding contribution to
technical mathematical results, he was the center of the mathematical
activity of the time and guided and inspired its development. Over the
doors of his school, the Academy in Athens, was inscribed the motto “Let
no one ignorant of geometry enter here.” His enthusiasm for the subject
led him to become known not as a mathematician, but as “the maker of
mathematicians.”</p>
<p>The men whose work we shall describe (in addition to that of Plato
and Aristotle) lived between the death of Socrates in 399 BCE and the
death of Aristotle in 322 BCE. They are Theodorus of Cyrene (fl. ca. 390
BCE), Theaetetus (ca. 414 369 BCE), Eudoxus of Cnidus (d. ca. 355 BCE),
Menaechmus (fl. ca. 350 BCE) and his brother Dinostratus (fl. ca.
350</p>
<p>BCE), and Autolycus of Pitane (fl. ca. 330 BCE).</p>
<p>These six mathematicians were not scattered throughout the Greek
world, as had been those in the fifth century BCE; they were associated
more or less closely with the Academy. It is clear that Plato’s high
regard for mathematics did not come from Socrates; in fact, the earlier
Platonic dialogues seldom refer to mathematics. The one who converted
Plato to a mathematical outlook was undoubtedly Archytas, a friend whom
he visited in Sicily in 388 BCE. Perhaps it was there that Plato learned
of the five regular solids, which were associated with the four elements
of Empedocles in a cosmic scheme that fascinated men for centuries.
Possibly, it was the Pythagorean regard for the dodecahedron that led
Plato to look on this, the fifth and last, regular solid as a symbol of
the universe. Plato put his ideas on the regular solids into a dialogue
titled the Timaeus, presumably named for a Pythagorean who serves as the
chief interlocutor. It is not known whether Timaeus of Locri really
existed or whether Plato invented him as a character through whom to
express the Pythagorean views that still were strong in what is now
southern Italy. The regular</p>
<p>Elements and regular solids</p>
<p>polyhedra have often been called “cosmic bodies” or “Platonic solids”
because of the way in which Plato in the Timaeus applied them to the
explanation of scientific phenomena. Although this dialogue, probably
written when Plato was near seventy, provides the earliest definite
evidence for the association of the four elements with the regular
solids, much of this fantasy may be due to the Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>Proclus attributes the construction of the cosmic figures to
Pythagoras, but the scholiast Suidas reported that Plato’s friend
Theaetetus (ca. 414 BCE 369 BCE) and the son of one of the richest
patricians in Attica first wrote on them. A scholium (of uncertain date)
to Book XIII of Euclid’s Elements reports that only three of the five
solids were due to the Pythagoreans, and that it was through Theaetetus
that the octahedron and the icosahedron became known. It seems likely
that in any case, Theaetetus made one of the most extensive studies of
the five regular solids, and to him probably is due the theorem that
there are five and only five regular polyhedra. Perhaps he is also
responsible for the calculations in the Elements of the ratios of the
edges of the regular solids to the radius of the circumscribed
sphere.</p>
<p>Theaetetus was a young Athenian who died from a combination of
dysentery and wounds received in battle, and the Platonic dialogue
bearing his name was a commemorative tribute by Plato to his friend. In
the dialogue, purporting to take place some thirty years earlier,
Theaetetus discusses with Socrates and Theodorus the nature of
incommensurable magnitudes. It has been assumed that this discussion
somewhat took the form that we find in the opening of Book X of the
Elements. Here distinctions are made not only between commensurable and
incommensurable magnitudes, but also between those that while
incommensurable in length are, or are not, commensurable inp p square.
Surds such as 3 and 5 are incommensurable in length, but they are
commensurable in square, for their squares have the ratio 3 to 5.</p>
<p>The magnitudes 11p3 and 11p5, on the other hand, are</p>
<p>incommensurable both in length and in square.p p</p>
<p>The dialogue that Plato composed in memory of his friend Theaetetus
contains information on another mathematician whom Plato admired and who
contributed to the early development of the theory of incommensurable
magnitudes. Reporting on the then recent discovery of what wep call the
irrationality of 2, Plato in the Theaetetus says that his teacher,
Theodorus of Cyrene—of whom Theaetetus was also a pupil—was the first to
prove the irrationality of the square roots of the nonsquare integers
from 3 to 17 inclusive. It is not known how he did this or whyp he
stopped with 17. The proof, in any case, would have been con-p structed
along the lines of that for 2 as given by Aristotle and interpolated in
later versions of Book X of the Elements. References in ancient
historical works indicate that Theodorus made discoveries in elementary
geometry that later were incorporated into Euclid’s Elements, but the
works of Theodorus are lost.</p>
<p>Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role
as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp
distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the
theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato
regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of
war, who “must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array
his troops.” The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an
arithmetician “because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay
hold of true being.” Moreover, Plato says in the Republic, “Arithmetic
has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the mind to reason
about abstract number.” So elevating are Plato’s thoughts concerning
numbers that they reach the realm of mysticism and apparent fantasy. In
the last book of the Republic, he refers to a number that he calls “the
lord of better and worse births.” There has been much speculation
concerning this “Platonic number,” and one theory is that it is the
number 604 512,960,000—important in Babylonian numerology and possibly
transmitted to Plato through the Pythagoreans. In the Laws, the number
of citizens in the ideal state is given as 5040 (that is, 7 U 6 U 5 U 4
U 3 U 2 U 1). This is sometimes referred to as the Platonic nuptial
number, and various theories have been advanced to suggest what Plato
had in mind.</p>
<p>As in arithmetic, where Plato saw a gulf separating the theoretical
and the computational aspects, so also in geometry he espoused the cause
of pure mathematics as against the materialistic views of the artisan or
the technician. Plutarch, in his Life of Marcellus, speaks of Plato’s
indignation at the use of mechanical contrivances in geometry.
Apparently, Plato regarded such use as “the mere corruption and
annihilation of the one good of geometry, which was thus shamefully
turning its back upon the unembodied objects of pure intelligence.”
Plato may consequently have been largely responsible for the prevalent
restriction in Greek geometric constructions to those that can be
effected by straightedge and compasses alone. The reason for the
limitation is not likely to have been the simplicity of the instruments
used in constructing lines and circles, but rather the symmetry of the
configurations. Any one of the infinitely many diameters of a circle is
a line of symmetry of the figure; any point on an infinitely extended
straight line can be thought of as a center of symmetry, just as any
line perpendicular to the given line is a line with respect to which the
given line is symmetric. Platonic philosophy, with its apotheosization
of ideas, would quite naturally find a favored role for the line and the
circle among geometric figures. In a somewhat similar manner, Plato
glorified the triangle. The faces of the five regular solids in Plato’s
view were not simple triangles, squares, and pentagons. Each of the four
faces of the tetrahedron, for example, is made up of six smaller right
triangles, formed by altitudes of the equilateral triangular faces. The
regular tetrahedron he therefore thought of as made up of twenty-four
scalene right triangles in which the hypotenuse is double one side; the
regular octahedron contains 836 or 48 such triangles, and the
icosahedron is made up of 2036 or 120 triangles. In a similar way the
hexahedron (or cube) is constructed of twenty-four isosceles right
triangles, for each of the six square faces contains four right
triangles when the diagonals of the squares are drawn.</p>
<p>To the dodecahedron, Plato had assigned a special role as
representative of the universe, cryptically saying that “God used it for
the whole” (Timaeus 55C). Plato looked on the dodecahedron as composed
of 360 scalene right triangles, for when the five diagonals and the five
medians are drawn in each of the pentagonal faces, each of the twelve
faces will contain thirty right triangles. The association of the first
four regular solids with the traditional four universal elements
provided Plato in the Timaeus with a beautifully unified theory of
matter, according to which everything was constructed of ideal right
triangles. The whole of physiology, as well as the sciences of inert
matter, is based in the Timaeus on these triangles.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is reputed to have established mathematics as a liberal
subject, but Plato was influential in making the subject an essential
part of the curriculum for the education of statesmen. Influenced
perhaps by Archytas, Plato would add to the original subjects in the
quadrivium a new subject, stereometry, for he believed that solid
geometry had not been sufficiently emphasized. Plato also discussed the
foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions, and
reorganized the assumptions. He emphasized that the reasoning used in
geometry does not refer to the visible figures that are drawn but to the
absolute ideas that they represent. The Pythagoreans had defined a point
as “unity having position,” but Plato would rather think of it as the
beginning of a line. The definition of a line as “breadthless length”
seems to have originated in the school of Plato, as well as the idea
that a line “lies evenly with the points on it.” In arithmetic, Plato
emphasized not only the distinction between odd and even numbers, but
also the categories “even times even,” “odd times even,” and “odd times
odd.” Although we are told that Plato added to the axioms of
mathematics, we do not have an account of his premises.</p>
<p>Few specific mathematical contributions are attributed to Plato. A
formula for Pythagorean triples—(2n)2 1(n2 21)2 5(n2 11)2, where n is
any natural number—bears Plato’s name, but this is merely a slightly
modified version of a result known to the Babylonians and the
Pythagoreans. Perhaps more genuinely significant is the ascription to
Plato of the so-called analytic method. In demonstrative mathematics one
begins with what is given, either generally in the axioms and the
postulates or more specifically in the problems at hand. Proceeding step
by step, one then arrives at the statement that was to have been proved.
Plato seems to have pointed out that often it is pedagogically
convenient, when a chain of reasoning from premises to conclusion is not
obvious, to reverse the process. One might begin with the proposition
that is to be proved and from it deduce a conclusion that is known to
hold. If, then, one can reverse the steps in this chain of reasoning,
the result is a legitimate proof of the proposition. It is unlikely that
Plato was the first to note the efficacy in the analytic point of view,
for any preliminary investigation of a problem is tantamount to this.
What Plato is likely to have done is to formalize this procedure or
perhaps to give it a name.</p>
<p>The role of Plato in the history of mathematics is still bitterly
disputed. Some regard him as an exceptionally profound and incisive
thinker; others picture him as a mathematical pied piper who lured men
away from problems that concerned the world’s work and who encouraged
idle speculation. In any case, few would deny that Plato had a
tremendous effect on the development of mathematics. The Platonic
Academy in Athens became the mathematical center of the world, and it
was from this school that the leading teachers and research workers came
during the middle of the fourth century. Of these, the greatest was
Eudoxus of Cnidus (408? 335? BCE), a man who was at one time a pupil of
Plato and who became the most renowned mathematician and astronomer of
his day.</p>
<p>Eudoxus</p>
<p>We sometimes read of the “Platonic reform” in mathematics, and
although the phrase tends to exaggerate the changes taking place, the
work of Eudoxus was so significant that the word “reform” is not
inappropriate. In Plato’s youth, the discovery of the incommensurable
had caused a veritable logical scandal, for it had raised havoc with
theorems involving proportions. Two quantities, such as the diagonal and
the side of a square, are incommensurable when they do not have a ratio
such as a (whole) number has to a (whole) number. How, then, is one to
compare ratios of incommensurable magnitudes? If Hippocrates really did
prove that the areas of circles are to each other as squares on their
diameters, he must have had some way of handling proportions or the
equality of ratios. We do not know how he proceeded or whether to some
extent he anticipated Eudoxus, who gave a new and generally accepted
definition of equal ratios. Apparently, the Greeks had made use of the
idea that four quantities are in proportion, a:b5c:d, if the two ratios
a:b and c:d have the same mutual subtraction. That is, the smaller in
each ratio can be laid off on the larger the same integral number of
times, and the remainder in each case can be laid off on the smaller the
same integral number of times, and the new remainder can be laid off on
the former remainder the same integral number of times, and so on. Such
a definition would be awkward to use, and it was a brilliant achievement
of Eudoxus to discover the theory of proportion used in Book V of
Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>The word “ratio” essentially denoted an undefined concept in Greek
mathematics, for Euclid’s “definition” of ratio as a kind of relation in
size between two magnitudes of the same type is quite inadequate. More
significant is Euclid’s statement that magnitudes are said to have a
ratio to one another if a multiple of either can be found to exceed the
other. This is essentially a statement of the so-called axiom of
Archimedes—a property that Archimedes himself attributed to Eudoxus. The
Eudoxian concept of ratio consequently excludes zero and clarifies what
is meant by magnitudes of the same kind. A line segment, for example, is
not to be compared, in terms of ratio, with an area; nor is an area to
be compared with a volume.</p>
<p>Following these preliminary remarks on ratios, Euclid gives in
Definition 5 of Book V the celebrated formulation by Eudoxus:</p>
<p>Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second
and the third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples whatever be
taken of the first and the third, and any equimultiples whatever of the
second and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike
equal to, or are alike less than, the latter equimultiples taken in
corresponding order (Heath 1981, vol. 2, p. 114).</p>
<p>That is, a/b5c/d if and only if given integers m and n, whenever ma ,
nb, then mc , nd, or if ma5nb, then mc5nd, or if ma . nb, then mc .
nd.</p>
<p>The Eudoxian definition of equality of ratios is not unlike the
process of cross-multiplication that is used today for fractions—a / b5c
/ d according as ad5bc—a process equivalent to a reduction to a common
denominator. To show that is equal to , for example, we multiply 3 and 6
by 4, to obtain 12 and 24, and we multiply 4 and 8 by 3, obtaining the
same pair of numbers 12 and 24. We could have used 7 and 13 as our two
multipliers, obtaining the pair 21 and 42 in the first case and 52 and
104 in the second, and as 21 is less than 52, so is 42 less than 104.
(We have here interchanged the second and third terms in Eudoxus’s
definition to conform to the common operations as usually used today,
but similar relationships hold in either case.) Our arithmetical example
does not do justice to the subtlety and efficacy of Eudoxus’s thought,
for the application here appears to be trivial. To gain a heightened
appreciation of his definition, it would be well to replace a, b, c, d
by surds or, better still, to let a and b be spheres and c and d cubes
on the radii of the spheres. Here a cross-multiplication becomes
meaningless, and the applicability of Eudoxus’s definition is far from
obvious. In fact, it will be noted that strictly speaking, the
definition is not far removed from the nineteenthcentury definitions of
real number, for it separates the class of rational numbers m/n into two
categories, according as ma#nb or ma.nb. Because there are infinitely
many rational numbers, the Greeks by implication were faced with the
concept they wished to avoid—that of an infinite set—but at least it was
now possible to give satisfactory proofs of theorems that involved
proportions.</p>
<p>Method of Exhaustion</p>
<p>A crisis resulting from the incommensurable had been successfully
met, thanks to the imagination of Eudoxus, but there remained another
unsolved problem—the comparison of curved and straight-line
configurations. Here, too, it seems to have been Eudoxus who supplied
the key. Earlier mathematicians apparently suggested that one try
inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures in and about the
curved figure and continue to multiply indefinitely the number of sides,
but they did not know how to clinch the argument, for the concept of a
limit was unknown at the time. According to Archimedes, it was Eudoxus
who provided the lemma that now bears Archimedes’ name—sometimes known
as the axiom of continuity—which served as the basis for the method of
exhaustion, the Greek equivalent of the integral calculus. The lemma or
axiom states that given two magnitudes having a ratio (that is, neither
being zero), one can find a multiple of either one that will exceed the
other. This statement excluded a fuzzy argument about indivisible line
segments, or fixed infinitesimals, that was sometimes maintained in
Greek thought. It also excluded the comparison of the so-called angle of
contingency or “horn angle” (formed by a curve C and its tangent T at a
point P on C) with ordinary rectilinear angles. The horn angle seemed to
be a magnitude different from zero, yet it does not satisfy the axiom of
Eudoxus with respect to the measures of rectilinear angles.</p>
<p>From the axiom of Eudoxus (or Archimedes) it is an easy step, by a
reductio ad absurdum, to prove a proposition that formed the basis of
the Greek method of exhaustion:</p>
<p>If from any magnitude there be subtracted a part not less than its
half, and if from the remainder one again subtracts not less than its
half, and if this process of subtraction is continued, ultimately there
will remain a magnitude less than any preassigned magnitude of the same
kind.</p>
<p>This proposition, which we shall refer to as the “exhaustion
property,” is equivalent to Euclid X.1 and to the modern statement that
if M is a given magnitude, ε is a preassigned magnitude of the same
kind, and r is a ratio such that #r ,1, then we can find a positive
integer N such that M(12r)n ,ε for all positive integers n.N. That is,
the exhaustion property is equivalent to the modern statement that
limn-NMð12rÞn 50. Moreover, the Greeks made use of this property to
prove theorems about the areas and the volumes of curvilinear figures.
In particular, Archimedes ascribed to Eudoxus the earliest satisfactory
proof that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the
cylinder having the same base and altitude, a statement that would seem
to indicate that the method of exhaustion was derived by Eudoxus. If so,
then it is to Eudoxus (rather than to Hippocrates) that we probably owe
the Euclidean proofs of theorems concerning areas of circles and volumes
of spheres. Facile earlier suggestions had been made that the area of a
circle could be exhausted by inscribing in it a regular polygon and then
increasing the number of sides indefinitely, but the Eudoxian method of
exhaustion first made such a procedure rigorous. (It should be noted
that the phrase “method of exhaustion” was not used by the ancient
Greeks, being a modern invention, but the phrase has become so well
established in the history of mathematics that we shall continue to make
use of it.) As an illustration of the way in which Eudoxus probably
carried out the method, we give here, in somewhat modernized notation,
the proof that areas of circles are to each other as squares on their
diameters. The proof, as it is given in Euclid, Elements XII.2, is
probably that of Eudoxus.</p>
<p>Let the circles be c and C, with diameters d and D and areas a and A.
It is to be proved that a/A5d2 /D2. The proof is complete if we proceed
indirectly and disprove the only other possibilities, namely, a/A,d2 /D2
and a / A.d2 / D2. Hence, we first assume that a / A.d2 / D2. Then,
there is a magnitude au ,a such that au/A5d2 / D2. Let a2au be a
preassigned magnitude ε.0. Within the circles c and C inscribe regular
polygons of areas pn and Pn, having the same number of sides n, and
consider the intermediate areas outside the polygons but inside the
circles (Fig. 4.18). If the number of sides should be doubled, it is
obvious that from these intermediate areas, we would be subtracting more
than the half. Consequently, by the exhaustion property, the
intermediate</p>
<p>areas can be reduced through successive doubling of the number of
sides (i.e., by letting n increase) until a2pn ,ε. Then, because a2au
5ε, we have pn .au. Now, from earlier theorems it is known that pn / Pn
5d2 / D2 and because it was assumed that au / A5d2 / D2, we have pn /Pn
5au / A. Hence, if pn .au, as we have shown, we must conclude that Pn
.A. Inasmuch as Pn is the area of a polygon inscribed within the circle
of area A, it is obvious that Pn cannot be greater than A. Because a
false conclusion implies a false premise, we have disproved the
possibility that a/A.d2 /D2. In an analogous manner, we can disprove the
possibility that a/A,d2 /D2, thereby establishing the theorem that areas
of circles are to each other as squares on their diameters.</p>
<p>Mathematical Astronomy</p>
<p>The property that we have just demonstrated appears to have been the
first precise theorem concerning the magnitudes of curvilinear figures;
it marks Eudoxus as the apparent anticipator of the integral calculus,
the greatest contribution to mathematics made by associates of the
Platonic Academy. Eudoxus, moreover, was by no means only a
mathematician; in the history of science, he is known as the father of
scientific astronomy. Plato is said to have proposed to his associates
that they attempt to give a geometric representation of the movements of
the sun, the moon, and the five known planets. It evidently was tacitly
assumed that the movements were to be compounded of uniform circular
motions. Despite such a restriction, Eudoxus was able to give for each
of the seven heavenly bodies a satisfactory representation through a
composite of concentric spheres with centers at the earth and with
varying radii, each sphere revolving uniformly about an axis fixed with
respect to the surface of the next larger sphere. For each planet, then,
Eudoxus gave a system known to his successors as “homocentric spheres”;
these geometric schemes were combined by Aristotle into the well-known
Peripatetic cosmology of crystalline spheres that dominated thought for
almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Eudoxus was without doubt the most capable mathematician of the
Hellenic Age, but all of his works have been lost. In his astronomical
scheme, Eudoxus had seen that by a combination of circular motions, he
could describe the motions of the planets in looped orbits along a curve
known as the hippopede, or horse fetter. This curve, resembling a figure
eight on a sphere, is obtained as the intersection of a sphere and a
cylinder tangent internally to the sphere—one of the few new curves that
the Greeks recognized. At the time, there were only two means of
defining curves: (1) through combinations of uniform motions and (2) as
the intersections of familiar geometric surfaces. The hippopede of
Eudoxus is a good example of a curve that is derivable in either of
these two ways. Proclus, who wrote some 800 years after the time of
Eudoxus, reported that Eudoxus had added many general theorems in
geometry and had applied the Platonic method of analysis to the study of
the section (probably the golden section), but Eudoxus’s two chief
claims to fame remain the theory of proportions and the method of
exhaustion.</p>
<p>Menaechmus</p>
<p>Eudoxus is to be remembered in the history of mathematics not only
for his own work but also through that of his pupils. In Greece, there
was a strong thread of continuity of tradition from teacher to student.
Thus, Plato learned from Archytas, Theodorus, and Theaetetus; the
Platonic influence in turn was passed on through Eudoxus to the brothers
Menaechmus and Dinostratus, both of whom achieved eminence in
mathematics. We saw that Hippocrates of Chios had shown that the
duplication of the cube could be achieved provided that one could find
and was permitted to use curves with the properties expressed in the
continued proportion a/x5x/y5y/ 2a; we also noted that the Greeks had
only two approaches to the discovery of new curves. It was consequently
a signal achievement on the part of Menaechmus when he disclosed that
curves having the desired property were near at hand. In fact, there was
a family of appropriate curves obtainable from a single source—the
cutting of a right circular cone by a plane perpendicular to an element
of the cone. That is, Menaechmus is reputed to have discovered the
curves that were later known as the ellipse, the parabola, and the
hyperbola.</p>
<p>Of all of the curves, other than circles and straight lines, that are
apparent to the eye in everyday experience, the ellipse should be the
most obvious, for it is present by implication whenever a circle is
viewed obliquely or whenever one saws diagonally through a cylindrical
log. Yet the first discovery of the ellipse seems to have been made by
Menaechmus as a mere by-product in a search in which it was the parabola
and the hyperbola that proffered the properties needed in the solution
of the Delian problem.</p>
<p>Beginning with a single-napped right circular cone having a right
angle at the vertex (that is, a generating angle of 45), Menaechmus
found that when the cone is cut by a plane perpendicular to an element,
the curve of intersection is such that in terms of modern analytic
geometry, its equation can be written in the form y2 5lx, where l is a
constant, depending on the distance of the cutting plane from the
vertex. We do not know how Menaechmus derived this property, but it
depends only on theorems from elementary geometry. Let the cone be ABC
and let it be cut in the curve EDG by a plane perpendicular to the
element ADC of the cone (Fig. 4.19).
Then,throughP,anypointonthecurve,pass a horizontal plane cutting the
cone in the circle PVR, and let Q be the other point of intersection of
the curve (parabola) and the circle. From the symmetries involved, it
follows that line PQ &gt; RV at O. Hence, OP is the mean proportional
between RO and OV. Moreover, from the similarity of triangles OVD and
BCA it follows that OV / DO5BC / AB, and from the similarity of
triangles RuDA and ABC it follows that RuD / ARu 5BC / AB. If OP5y and
OD5x are coordinates of point P, we have y2 5RO OV,</p>
<p>or, on substituting equals,</p>
<p>y2 5R0DUOV 5AR0U BC UDOU BC 5 AR0UBC2 2 x:</p>
<p>AB AB AB</p>
<p>Inasmuch as segments ARu, BC, and AB are the same for all points P on
the curve EQDPG, we can write the equation of the curve, a “section of a
rightangled cone,” as y2 5lx, where l is a constant, later to be known
as the latus rectum of the curve. In an analogous way, we can derive an
equation of the form y2 5lx2b2x2 /a2 for a “section of an acute-angled
cone” and an equation of the form y2 5lx1b2x2 /a2 for a “section of an
obtuse-angled</p>
<p>FIG. 4.19</p>
<p>cone,” where a and b are constants and the cutting plane is
perpendicular to an element of the acute-angled or obtuse-angled right
circular cone.</p>
<p>Duplication of the Cube</p>
<p>Menaechmus had no way of foreseeing the hosts of beautiful properties
that the future would disclose. He had hit on the conics in a successful
search for curves with the properties appropriate to the duplication of
the cube. In terms of modern notation, the solution is easily achieved.
By shifting the cutting plane (Fig. 4.19), we can find a parabola with
any latus rectum. If we wish to duplicate a cube of edge a, we locate on
a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum a and another
with latus rectum 2a. If, then, we place these with vertices at the
origin and with axes along the y- and x-axes, respectively, the point of
intersection of the two curves will have coordinates (x, y) satisfying
the continued proportion a/x5x/y5y/2a (Fig. 4.20); that is, x5ap3 2, x,
y5ap3 4. The x-coordinate, therefore, is the edge of the cube
sought.</p>
<p>It is probable that Menaechmus knew that the duplication could also
be achieved by the use of a rectangular hyperbola and a parabola. If the
parabola with equation y2 5(a/2)x and the hyperbola xy5a2 are placed on
a common coordinate system, the point of intersection will have
coordinates x5ap3 2; y5ap3 2; the x-coordinate being the side of the
cube desired. Menaechmus was probably acquainted with many of the
now-familiar properties of the conic sections, including the asymptotes
of the hyperbola, which would have permitted him to operate with the
equivalents of the modern equations that we used earlier. Proclus
reported that Menaechmus was one of those who “made the whole of
geometry more perfect,” but we know little about his actual work. We do
know that Menaechmus taught Alexander the Great, and legend attributes
to Menaechmus the celebrated comment, when his royal pupil asked for a
shortcut to geometry: “O King, for traveling over the country there are
royal roads and roads for common citizens; but in</p>
<p>geometry there is one road for all.” Among the chief authorities for
attributing to Menaechmus the discovery of conic sections is a letter
from Eratosthenes to King Ptolemy Euergetes, quoted some 700 years later
by Eutocius, in which several duplications of the cube are mentioned.
Among them is one by Archytas’s unwieldy construction and another by
“cutting the cone in the triads of Menaechmus.”</p>
<p>Dinostratus and the Squaring of the Circle</p>
<p>Dinostratus, a brother of Menaechmus, was also a mathematician; one
of the brothers “solved” the duplication of the cube, the other “solved”
the squaring of the circle. The quadrature became a simple matter once a
striking property of the end point Q of the trisectrix of Hippias had
been noted, apparently by Dinostratus. If the equation of the trisectrix
(Fig. 4.21) is πrsinθ52aθ, where a is the side of the square ABCD
associated with the curve, the limiting value of r as θ tends toward
zero is 2a/π. This is obvious to one who has had calculus and recalls
that limθ-0 sinθ=θ51 for radian measure. The proof, as given by Pappus
and probably due to Dinostratus, is based only on considerations from
elementary geometry. The theorem of Dinostratus states that side a is
the mean proportional between the segment DQ and the arc of the
quarter</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>circle AC; that is, AC=AB5AB=DQ. Using a typically Greek indirect
proof, we establish the theorem by demolishing the alternatives.
Hence,</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>assume first that AC=AB5AB=DR where DR.DQ. Then, let the circle with
center D and radius DR intersect the trisectrix at S and side AD of the
square at T. From S drop the perpendicular SU to side CD. Inasmuch</p>
<p>as it was known to Dinostratus that corresponding arcs of circles are
to</p>
<p>_ _</p>
<p>each other as the radii, we have_ AC=AB5TR_=DR, and because by
hypothesis AC=AB5AB=DR, it follows that TR 5AB_. But from the_
definitional property of the trisectrix it is known that TR=SR
5AB=SU.</p>
<p>_ _</p>
<p>Hence, because TR 5AB, it must follow that SR 5SU, which obviously is
false, because the perpendicular is shorter than any other line or curve
from point S to line DC. Hence, the fourth term DR in the proportion</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>AC=AB5AB=DR cannot be greater than DQ. In a similar manner, we</p>
<p>can prove that this fourth proportional cannot be less than DQ;
hence,</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Dinostratus’s theorem is established—that is, AC=AB5AB=DQ.</p>
<p>Given the intersection point Q of the trisectrix with DC, we then
have a proportion involving three straight-line segments and the
circular arc AC. Hence, by a simple geometric construction of the fourth
term in a proportion, a line segment b equal in length to AC can easily
be drawn. On drawing a rectangle with 2b as one side and a as the other,
we have a rectangle exactly equal in area to the area of the circle with
radius a; a square equal to the rectangle is easily constructed by
taking as the side of the square the geometric mean of the sides of the
rectangle. Inasmuch as Dinostratus showed that the trisectrix of Hippias
serves to square the circle, the curve more commonly came to be known as
the quadratrix. It was, of course, always clear to the Greeks that the
use of the curve in the trisection and quadrature problems violated the
rules of the game—that only circles and straight lines were permitted.
The “solutions” of Hippias and Dinostratus, as their authors realized,
were sophistic; hence, the search for further solutions, canonical or
illegitimate, continued, with the result that several new curves were
discovered by Greek geometers.</p>
<p>Autolycus of Pitane</p>
<p>A few years after Dinostratus and Menaechmus, in the second half of
the fourth century BCE, there flourished an astronomer who has the
distinction of having written the oldest surviving Greek mathematical
treatise. Autolycus of Pitane is the author of a treatise, On the Moving
Sphere, that formed part of a collection known as the “Little
Astronomy,” which was widely used by ancient astronomers. On the Moving
Sphere is not a profound and probably not a very original work, for it
includes little beyond elementary theorems on the geometry of the sphere
that would be needed in astronomy. Its chief significance lies in the
fact that it indicates that Greek geometry had reached the form that we
regard as typical of the classical age. Theorems are clearly enunciated
and proved. Moreover, the author uses without proof or indication of
source other theorems that he regards as well known. We conclude,
therefore, that in Greece in his day, about 320 BCE, a thoroughly
established textbook tradition in geometry existed.</p>
