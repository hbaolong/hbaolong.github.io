<h4 id="gerbert">Gerbert</h4>
<p>In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope. He endeavored to
pull his empire out of the doldrums of the Dark Ages and under that</p>
<p>Ger b er t</p>
<p>program called on the educator Alcuin of York (ca. 735 804), whom he
had brought to Tours some years earlier, to revitalize education in
France. This brought sufficient improvement to lead some historians to
speak of a Carolingian Renaissance. Alcuin was no mathematician,
however; presumably, he showed Neopythagorean influence in his
explanation that the act of creation had taken six days because 6 was a
perfect number. Beyond some arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy that
Alcuin is reputed to have written for beginners, there was little
mathematics in France or England for another two centuries. In Germany,
Hrabanus Maurus (784 856) continued the slight mathematical and
astronomical efforts of Bede, especially in connection with the
computation of the date of Easter. But not for another century and a
half was there any notable change in the mathematical climate in Western
Europe, and then it came in the person of one who rose ultimately to
become Pope</p>
<p>Sylvester II.</p>
<p>Gerbert (ca. 940 1003) was born in France, educated in Spain and
Italy, and then served in Germany as tutor and later adviser to the Holy
Roman Emperor Otto III. Having also served as archbishop, first at Reims
and later at Ravenna, Gerbert in 999 was elevated to the papacy, taking
the name Sylvester—possibly in recollection of an earlier pope who had
been noted for scholarship, but more probably because Sylvester I, the
pope during the days of Constantine, symbolized the unity of papacy and
empire. Gerbert was active in politics, both lay and ecclesiastical, but
he also had time for educational matters. He wrote on both arithmetic
and geometry, likely depending on the Boethian tradition, which had
dominated the teaching in Western church schools. More interesting than
these expository works, however, is the fact that Gerbert was perhaps
the first one in Europe to have taught the use of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. It is not clear how he came in contact with these. Moorish
learning included Arabic numeration with the Western, or Gobar (dust),
forms of the numerals, although there is little evidence of Arabic
influence in extant documents. A Spanish copy of the Origines of
Isidore, dating from 992, contains the numerals, without the zero. In
certain manuscripts of Boethius, however, similar numeral forms, or
apices, appear as counters for use on a computing board or an abacus.
The Boethian apices, on the other hand, may themselves have been later
interpolations. The situation with respect to the introduction of the
numerals into Europe is about as confused as is that surrounding the
invention of the system perhaps half a millennium earlier. Moreover, it
is not clear that there was any continued use of the new numerals in
Europe during the two centuries following Gerbert. Not until the
thirteenth century was the Hindu-Arabic system definitively introduced
into Europe, and then the achievement was not the work of one man but of
several.</p>
