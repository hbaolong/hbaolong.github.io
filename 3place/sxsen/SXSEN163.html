<h4 id="johann-hudde">Johann Hudde</h4>
<p>In 1656 1657, Van Schooten had published a work of his own,
Exercitationes Mathematicae, in which he gave new results in the
application of algebra to geometry. Included are also discoveries made
by his most capable disciples, such as Johann Hudde (1629 1704), a
patrician who served for some thirty years as burgomaster of Amsterdam.
Hudde corresponded with Huygens and De Witt on the maintenance of canals
and on problems of probability and life expectancy; in 1672, he directed
the work of inundating Holland to obstruct the advance of the French
army. In 1656, Hudde had written on the quadrature of the hyperbola by
means of infinite series, as had Mengoli, but the manuscript has been
lost. In Van Schooten’s Exercitationes, there is a section by Hudde on a
study of coordinates of a fourth-degree surface, an anticipation of
solid analytic geometry antedating even that of Lahire, although less
explicitly described. Moreover, it appears that Hudde was the first
mathematician to permit a literal coefficient in an equation to
represent any real number, whether positive or negative. This final step
in the process of generalizing the notations of Viete in the theory of
equations was made in a work by` Hudde titled De Reductione Aequationum,
which also formed part of the 1659 1661 Van Schooten edition of
Descartes’ La ge´ome´trie.</p>
<p>The two most popular subjects in Hudde’s day were analytic geometry
and mathematical analysis, and the burgomaster-to-be contributed to
both. In 1657 1658, Hudde had discovered two rules that pointed clearly
toward algorithms of the calculus:</p>
<p>1.If r is a double root of the polynomial equation</p>
<p>a0xn 1a1xn 1 1 1an 1x1an 50</p>
<p>and if b0, b1, … , bn 1, bn are numbers in arithmetic progression,
then r is also a root of</p>
<p>a0b0xn 1a1b1xn 1 1 1an 1bn 1x1anbn 50:</p>
<p>2.If for x5a the polynomial</p>
<p>a0xn 1a1xn 1 1 1an 1x1an</p>
<p>takes on a relative maximum or minimum value, then a is a root of the
equation: na0xn 1ðn21Þa1xn 1 1 12an 2x2 1an 1x50:</p>
<p>The first of these “Hudde’s rules” is a camouflaged form of the
modern theorem that if r is a double root of f(x)50, then r is also a
root of f u(x)50. The second is a slight modification of Fermat’s
theorem that today appears in the form that if f(a) is a relative
maximum or minimum value of a polynomial f(x), then f u(a)50.</p>
<p>Rene Fran´ cois de Sluse¸</p>
<p>The rules of Hudde were widely known, for they were published by Van
Schooten in 1659 in Volume I of Geometria a Renato Des Cartes. A few
years earlier, a similar rule for tangents had been used by another
representative from the Low Countries, the canon Rene Franc¸ois de
Sluse´ (1622 1685), a native of Liege who came from a distinguished
Walloon` family. He had studied in Lyons and Rome, where he may have
become familiar with the work of Italian mathematicians. Possibly
through Torricelli, perhaps independently, in 1652 Sluse arrived at a
routine for finding the tangent to a curve whose equation is of the form
f(x, y)50, where f is a polynomial. The rule, not published until 1673,
when it appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,
may be stated as follows: The subtangent will be the quotient obtained
by placing in the numerator all of the terms containing y, each
multiplied by the exponent of the power of y appearing in it, and
placing in the denominator all of the terms containing it, each
multiplied by the exponent of the power of x appearing in it and then
divided by x. This is, of course, equivalent to forming the quotient now
written as yfy /fx, a result also known to Hudde in about 1659. Such
instances show how discoveries in the calculus were crowding on one
another even before the work of Newton.</p>
<p>Sluse, sharing in the tradition of the Low Countries, was also quite
active in promoting Cartesian geometry, even though he preferred the A
and E of VieteandFermattothe`
xandyofDescartes.In1659,hepublishedapopular book, Mesolabum (OfMeans),
in which he pursued the familiar topic onthe geometric constructions of
the rootsof equations. Heshowed thatgivenany conic, one can construct
the roots of any cubic or quartic equation through the intersection of
the conic and a circle. The name of Sluse is also attached to afamily
ofcurvesthatheintroducedin hiscorrespondencewithHuygens and Pascal in
1657 1658. These so-called pearls of Sluse, so named by Pascal, are
curves given by equations of the form ym 5kxn(a2x)b. Sluse mistakenly
thought that such cases as y5x2(a2x) were pearl-shaped, for, negative
coordinates not then being understood, Sluse assumed symmetry with
respect to the axis (of abscissas); however, Christiaan Huygens (1629
1695), who had the reputation of being Van Schooten’s best pupil, found
the maximum and minimum points and the point of inflection and was able
to sketch the curve correctly for both positive and negative
coordinates.Otherpointsofinflectionhadalsobeenfoundbyseveralmenbefore
Huygens, including Fermat and Roberval.</p>
