<h4 id="astronomy">Astronomy</h4>
<p>It was astronomy, rather than number theory, that gained immediate
fame for the twenty-four-year-old author of the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae. On January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi (1746 1826), the
director of the Palermo observatory, had discovered the new minor planet
(asteroid) Ceres, but a few weeks afterward, the tiny body was lost to
sight. Having most unusual computational ability, as well as the added
advantage of the method of least squares, Gauss took up the challenge to
compute, from the few recorded observations of the planet, the orbit in
which it moved. For the task of computing orbits from a limited number
of observations, he devised a scheme, known as Gauss’s method, that is
still used to track satellites. The result was a resounding success, the
planet being rediscovered at the end of the year in very nearly the
position indicated by his calculations. Gauss’s orbit computations
captured the attention of astronomers internationally and soon brought
him to prominence among German mathematical scientists, most of whom
were engaged in astronomical and geodesic activities at the time. In
1807, he was appointed director of the Go¨ttingen observatory, a post he
held for nearly half a century. Two years later, his classic treatise on
theoretical astronomy, the Theoria Motus, appeared. It provided a clear
guide for carrying out orbital computations and by the time of his death
had been translated into English, French, and German.</p>
<p>Orbital computations were not the only area of astronomical research
in which Gauss distinguished himself and paved a path for succeeding
generations, however. Much of his time during the first decade of the
nineteenth century was spent in working on the problem of perturbations.
This had moved to the foreground of astronomers’ interests after the
discovery in 1802 of the minor planet Pallas by Gauss’s good friend, the
physician and amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758 1840).
Pallas has a relatively large eccentricity and is particularly affected
by the gravitational attraction of other planets such as Jupiter and
Saturn. Determining the effect of these attractions is a specific
example of the n-body problem that Euler and Lagrange had previously
attacked for n52 or 3. Gauss’s work on this problem resulted not only in
astronomical memoirs but in two classical mathematical papers: one dealt
with infinite series, the other with a new method for numerical
analysis.</p>
<p>Gaus s’s Middle Ye ar s</p>
<p>Gauss’s MiddleYears</p>
<p>The decade in which Gauss arrived at the preceding results had been
filled with new discoveries, as well as emotionally draining events. He
had experienced early recognition and honors, happiness in marriage, and
fatherhood. But then came financial concerns resulting from levies
imposed by the occupying administration in Go¨ttingen; the deaths of his
patron, the Duke of Brunswick, and of his wife and third child;
annoyance at the lack of appreciation of his work among scientists such
as the French astronomer J. B. J. Delambre; concern over raising his
children; and rapid entry into a second marriage. The previously
cheerful young genius became an austere figure whose strict sense of
duty often led him to seemingly rigid decisions in the nonscientific
realm. This image was intensified after the 1820s by the lingering
illness of his second wife, who died in 1831, and an estrangement from
one of his sons that lasted for more than a decade.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gauss’s position as director of the Go¨ttingen
observatory presented new challenges. Between 1810 and 1820, much of his
energy was absorbed by the building and outfitting of a new observatory.
He made the acquaintance of major instrument makers of the period and
involved himself with the details of instrument construction. Studies of
instruments and observations led him to significant results in error
theory. After 1815, his increasing comprehension of the nature of
instrumental, observational, and technical errors was reinforced by his
immersion in surveying and geodesy. The result was a set of reports on
error theory. During the 1820s, he was charged with the survey of the
Kingdom of Hannover, which meant that he spent numerous summers in the
field, personally conducting measurements, often under primitive and
hazardous conditions. The most significant publication that resulted
from the geometric considerations of the decade appeared in 1827, and it
opened a new direction in geometric and, ultimately, in physical
research.</p>
<p>Gauss was not especially fond of geometry, yet he thought about the
subject sufficiently to do two things: (1) to arrive, by 1824, at an
important unpublished conclusion on the parallel postulate; and (2) to
publish, in 1827, a classic treatise that generally is regarded as the
cornerstone of a new branch of geometry. Gauss, while still a student at
Go¨ttingen, had tried to prove the parallel postulate, as had his
intimate friend Wolfgang (or Farkas) Bolyai (1775 1856) as well. Both
men continued to look for a proof, the latter giving up in despair, the
former eventually coming to the conviction that not only was no proof
possible, but that a geometry quite different from that of Euclid might
be developed. Had Gauss expanded and published his thoughts on the
parallel postulate, he would have been hailed as the inventor of
non-Euclidean geometry, but his silence on the subject resulted in
credit going to others, as we shall see further on.</p>
