<h4 id="the-elements">The Elements</h4>
<p>The Elements was a textbook and by no means the first one. We know of
at least three earlier such Elements, including that by Hippocrates of
Chios, but there is no trace of these or of other potential rivals from
ancient times. The Elements of Euclid so far outdistanced competitors
that it alone survived. The Elements was not, as is sometimes thought, a
compendium of all geometric knowledge; it was instead an introductory
textbook covering all elementary mathematics—that is, arithmetic (in the
sense of the English “higher arithmetic” or the American “theory of
numbers”), synthetic geometry (of points, lines, planes, circles, and
spheres), and algebra (not in the modern symbolic sense, but an
equivalent in geometric garb). It will be noted that the art of
calculation is not included, for this was not a part of mathematical
instruction; nor was the study of the conics or higher plane curves part
of the book, for these formed a part of more advanced mathematics.
Proclus described the Elements as bearing to the rest of mathematics the
same sort of relation as that which the letters of the alphabet have in
relation to language. Were the Elements intended as an exhaustive store
of information, the author might have included references to other
authors, statements of recent research, and informal explanations. As it
is, the Elements is austerely limited to the business in hand—the
exposition in logical order of the fundamentals of elementary
mathematics. Occasionally, however, later writers interpolated into the
text explanatory scholia, and such additions were copied by later
scribes as part of the original text. Some of these appear in every one
of the manuscripts now extant. Euclid himself made no claim to
originality, and it is clear that he drew heavily from the works of his
predecessors. It is believed that the arrangement is his own, and,
presumably, some of the proofs were supplied by him, but beyond that, it
is difficult to estimate the degree of originality that is to be found
in this, the most renowned mathematical work in history.</p>
<p>Definitions and Postulates</p>
<p>The Elements is divided into thirteen books or chapters, of which the
first half-dozen are on elementary plane geometry, the next three on the
theory of numbers, the tenth on incommensurables, and the last three
chiefly on solid geometry. There is no introduction or preamble to the
work, and the first book opens abruptly with a list of twenty-three
definitions. The weakness here is that some of the definitions do not
define, inasmuch as there is no prior set of undefined elements in terms
of which to define the others. Thus, to say, as does Euclid, that “a
point is that which has no part,” or that “a line is breadthless
length,” or that “a surface is that which has length and breadth only,”
is scarcely to define these entities, for a definition must be expressed
in terms of things that precede and are better known than the things
defined. Objections can easily be raised on the score of logical
circularity to other so-called definitions of Euclid, such as “The
extremities of a line are points,” or “A straight line is a line which
lies evenly with the points on itself,” or “The extremities of a surface
are lines,” all of which may have been due to Plato.</p>
<p>Following the definitions, Euclid lists five postulates and five
common notions. Aristotle had made a sharp distinction between axioms
(or common notions) and postulates; the former, he said, must be
convincing in themselves—truths common to all studies—but the latter are
less obvious and do not presuppose the assent of the learner, for they
pertain only to the subject at hand. We do not know whether Euclid
distinguished between two types of assumptions. Surviving manuscripts
are not in agreement here, and in some cases, the ten assumptions appear
together in a single category. Modern mathematicians see no essential
difference between an axiom and a postulate. In most manuscripts of the
Elements, we find the following ten assumptions:</p>
<p>Postulates. Let the following be postulated:</p>
<p>1.To draw a straight line from any point to any point.</p>
<p>2.To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight
line.</p>
<p>3.To describe a circle with any center and radius.</p>
<p>4.That all right angles are equal.</p>
<p>5.That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the
interiorangles on the same side less than two right angles, the two
straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the
angles are less than the two right angles.</p>
<p>Common notions:</p>
<p>1.Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one
another.</p>
<p>2.If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.</p>
<p>3.If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</p>
<p>4.Things which coincide with one another are equal to one
another.</p>
<p>5.The whole is greater than the part.</p>
<p>Aristotle had written that “other things being equal, that proof is
the better which proceeds from the fewer postulates,” and Euclid
evidently subscribed to this principle. For example, Postulate 3 is
interpreted in the very limited literal sense, sometimes described as
the use of the Euclidean (collapsible) compass, whose legs maintain a
constant opening so long as the point stands on the paper, but fall back
on each other when they are lifted. That is, the postulate is not
interpreted to permit the use of a pair of dividers to lay off a
distance equal to one line segment on a noncontiguous longer line
segment, starting from an end point. It is proved in the first three
propositions of Book I that the latter construction is always possible,
even under the strict interpretation of Postulate 3. The first
proposition justifies the construction of an equilateral triangle ABC on
a given line segment AB by constructing through B a circle with a center
at A and another circle through A with a center at B, and letting C be
the point of intersection of the two circles. (That they do intersect is
tacitly assumed.) Proposition 2 then builds on Proposition 1 by showing
that from any point A as extremity (Fig. 5.3), one can lay off a
straight line segment equal to a given line segment BC. First, Euclid
drew AB,</p>
<p>and on this he constructed the equilateral triangle ABD, extending
the sides DA and DB to E and F, respectively. With B as center, describe
the circle through C, intersecting BF in G; then, with D as center, draw
a circle through G, intersecting DE in H. Line AH is then easily shown
to be the line required. Finally, in Proposition 3 Euclid made use of
Proposition 2 to show that given any two unequal straight lines, one can
cut off from the greater a segment equal to the smaller.</p>
<p>Scope of Book I</p>
<p>In the first three propositions, Euclid went to great pains to show
that a very restricted interpretation of Postulate 3 nevertheless
implies the free use of a compass as is usually done in laying off
distances in elementary geometry. Nevertheless, by modern standards of
rigor, the Euclidean assumptions are woefully inadequate, and in his
proofs Euclid often makes use of tacit postulates. In the first
proposition of the Elements, for example, he assumes without proof that
the two circles will intersect in a point. For this and similar
situations, it is necessary to add to the postulates one equivalent to a
principle of continuity. Moreover, Postulates 1 and 2, as they were
expressed by Euclid, guarantee neither the uniqueness of the straight
line through two noncoincident points nor even its infinitude; they
simply assert that there is at least one and that it has no termini.</p>
<p>Most of the propositions in Book I of the Elements are well known to
anyone who has had a high school course in geometry. Included are the
familiar theorems on the congruence of triangles (but without an axiom
justifying the method of superposition), on simple constructions by
straightedge and compass, on inequalities concerning angles and sides of
a triangle, on properties of parallel lines (leading to the fact that
the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles), and
on parallelograms (including the construction of a parallelogram having
given angles and equal in area to a given triangle or a given
rectilinear figure). The book closes (in Propositions 47 and 48) with
the proof of the Pythagorean theorem and its converse. The proof of the
theorem as given by Euclid was not that usually given in textbooks of
today, in which simple proportions are applied to the sides of similar
triangles formed by dropping an altitude on the hypotenuse. For the
Pythagorean theorem, Euclid used instead the beautiful proof with a
figure sometimes described as a windmill or the peacock’s tail or the
bride’s chair (Fig. 5.4). The proof is accomplished by showing that the
square on AC is equal to twice the triangle FAB or to twice the triangle
CAD or to the rectangle AL, and that the square on BC is equal to twice
the triangle ABK or to twice the triangle BCE or to the rectangle BL.
Hence, the sum of the squares is equal to the sum of the rectangles—that
is, to the square on AB. It has been assumed that this proof was
original with Euclid, and many conjectures have been made as to the
possible form of earlier proofs. Since the days of Euclid, many
alternative proofs have been proposed.</p>
<p>It is to Euclid’s credit that the Pythagorean theorem is immediately
followed by a proof of the converse: If in a triangle the square on one
of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides,
the angle between these other two sides is a right angle. Not
infrequently in modern textbooks, the exercises following the proof of
the Pythagorean theorem are such that they require not the theorem
itself but the still unproved converse. There may be many a minor flaw
in the Elements, but the book had all of the major logical virtues.</p>
<p>Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>Book II of the Elements is a short one, containing only fourteen
propositions, not one of which plays any role in modern textbooks, yet
in Euclid’s day this book was of great significance. This sharp
discrepancy between ancient and modern views is easily explained—today
we have symbolic algebra and trigonometry, which have replaced the
geometric equivalents from Greece. For instance, Proposition 1 of Book
II states, “If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into
any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two
straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut
straight line and each of the segments.” This theorem, which asserts
(Fig. 5.5) that AD (AP1PR1RB)5ADAP1ADPR1ADRB, is nothing more than a
geometric statement of one of the fundamental laws of arithmetic known
today as the distributive law: a(b1c1d)5ab1ac1ad. In later books of the
Elements (V and VII), we find demonstrations of the commutative and
associative laws for multiplication. In Euclid’s day magnitudes were
pictured as line segments satisfying the axioms and the theorems of
geometry.</p>
<p>Book II of the Elements, which is a geometric algebra, served much
the same purpose as does our symbolic algebra. There can be little doubt
that modernalgebragreatlyfacilitatesthemanipulationofrelationshipsamong
magnitudes. Yet, it is undoubtedly also true that a Greek geometer
versed in the fourteen theorems of Euclid’s “algebra” was far more adept
in applying these theorems to practical mensuration than is an
experienced geometer of today. Ancient geometric algebra was not an
ideal tool, but it was far from ineffective and its visual appeal to an
Alexandrian schoolboy must have been far more vivid than its modern
algebraic counterpart can ever be. For example, Elements II.5 contains
what we should regard as an impractical circumlocution for a2 2b2
5(a1b)(a2b):</p>
<p>If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the
rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole, together with
the square on the straight line between the points of section, is equal
to the square on the half.</p>
<p>A P R B</p>
<p>D Q S C</p>
<p>FIG. 5.5</p>
<p>The diagram that Euclid uses in this connection played a key role in
Greek algebra; hence, we reproduce it with further explanation.
(Throughout this chapter, the translations and most of the diagrams are
based on the Thirteen Books of Euclid’s Elements, as edited by T. L.
Heath.) If in the diagram (Fig. 5.6) we let AC5CB5a, and CD5b, the
theorem asserts that (a1b)(a2b)1b2 5a2. The geometric verification of
this statement is not difficult; however, the significance of the
diagram lies not so much in the proof of the theorem as in the use to
which similar diagrams were put by Greek geometric algebraists. If the
Greek scholar were required to construct a line x having the property
expressed by ax x2 5 b2, where a and b are line segments with a.2b, he
would draw line AB5a and bisect it at C. Then, at C he would erect a
perpendicular CP equal in length to b; with P as center and radius a/2,
he would draw a circle cutting AB in point D. Then, on AB he would
construct rectangle ABMK of width BM5BD and complete the square BDHM.
This square is the area x2, having the property specified in the
quadratic equation. As the Greeks expressed it, we have applied to the
segment AB (5a) a rectangle AH (5ax2x2), which is equal to a given
square (b2) and falls short (of AM) by a square DM. The demonstration of
this is provided by the proposition cited earlier (II.5), in which it is
clear that the rectangle ADHK equals the concave polygon</p>
<p>CBFGHL—that is, it differs from (a/2)2 by the square LHGE, the side
of</p>
<p>The figure used by Euclid inpElementsð Þ2 II.11 and again in VI.30
(our2 which by construction is CD5 a=2 2b :</p>
<p>Fig. 5.7) is the basis for a diagram that appears today in many
geometry books to illustrate the iterative property of the golden
section. To the gnomon BCDFGH (Fig. 5.7), we add point L to complete the
rectangle CDFL (Fig. 5.8), and within the smaller rectangle LBGH, which
is similar to the larger rectangle LCDF, we construct, by making GO5GL,
the gnomon LBMNOG similar to gnomon BCDFGH. Now within the</p>
<p>FIG. 5.6</p>
<p>FIG. 5.7</p>
<p>rectangle BHOP, which is similar to the larger rectangles CDFL and
LBHG, we construct the gnomon PBHQRN similar to the gnomons BCDFGH and
LBMNOG. Continuing indefinitely in this manner, we have an unending
sequence of nested similar rectangles tending toward a limiting point Z.
It turns out that Z, which is easily seen to be the point of
intersection of lines FB and DL, is also the pole of a logarithmic
spiral tangent to the sides of the rectangles at points C, A, G, P, M,
Q, … Other striking properties can be found in this fascinating
diagram.</p>
<p>Propositions 12 and 13 of Book II are of interest because they
adumbrate the concern with trigonometry that was shortly to blossom in
Greece. These propositions will be recognized by the reader as geometric
formulations—first for the obtuse angle and then for the acute angle—of
what later became known as the law of cosines for plane triangles:</p>
<p>Proposition 12. In obtuse-angled triangles, the square on the side
subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides
containing</p>
<p>the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides
about the obtuse angle, namely, that on which the perpendicular falls,
and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular toward the
obtuse angle.</p>
<p>Proposition 13. In acute-angled triangles, the square on the side
subtending the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides
containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of
the sides of the acute angle, namely, that on which the perpendicular
falls, and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular toward
the acute angle.</p>
<p>The proofs of Propositions 12 and 13 are analogous to those used
today in trigonometry through double application of the Pythagorean
theorem.</p>
<p>Books III and IV</p>
<p>It has generally been supposed that the contents of the first two
books of the Elements are largely the work of the Pythagoreans. Books
III and IV, on the other hand, deal with the geometry of the circle, and
here the material is presumed to have been drawn primarily from
Hippocrates of Chios. The two books are not unlike the theorems on
circles contained in textbooks of today. The first proposition of Book
III, for example, calls for the construction of the center of a circle,
and the last, Proposition 37, is the familiar statement that if from a
point outside a circle a tangent and a secant are drawn, the square on
the tangent is equal to the rectangle on the whole secant and the
external segment. Book IV contains sixteen propositions, largely
familiar to modern students, concerning figures inscribed in, or
circumscribed about, a circle. Theorems on the measure of angles are
reserved until after a theory of proportions has been established.</p>
<p>Theory of Proportion</p>
<p>Of the thirteen books of the Elements, those most admired have been
the fifth and the tenth—the one on the general theory of proportion and
the other on the classification of incommensurables. The discovery of
the incommensurable had threatened a logical crisis that cast doubt on
proofs appealing to proportionality, but the crisis had been
successfully averted through the principles enunciated by Eudoxus.
Nevertheless, Greek mathematicians tended to avoid proportions. We have
seen that Euclid put off their use as long as possible, and such a
relationship among lengths as x:a5b:c would be thought of as an equality
of the areas cx5ab. Sooner or later, however, proportions are needed,
and so Euclid tackled the problem in Book V of the Elements. Some
commentators have gone so far as to suggest that the whole book,
consisting of twenty-five propositions, was the work of Eudoxus, but
this seems to be unlikely. Some of the definitions—such as that of a
ratio—are so vague as to be useless. Definition 4, however, is
essentially the axiom of Eudoxus and Archimedes: “Magnitudes are said to
have a ratio to one another which are capable, when multiplied, of
exceeding one another.” Definition 5, the equality of ratios, is
precisely that given earlier in connection with Eudoxus’s definition of
proportionality.</p>
<p>Book V deals with topics of fundamental importance in all
mathematics. It opens with propositions that are equivalent to such
things as the left-hand and right-hand distributive laws for
multiplication over addition, the left-hand distributive law for
multiplication over subtraction, and the associative law for
multiplication (ab)c5a(bc). Then the book lays out rules for “greater
than” and “less than” and the wellknown properties of proportions. It is
often asserted that Greek geometric algebra could not rise above the
second degree in plane geometry or above the third degree in solid
geometry, but this is not really the case. The general theory of
proportions would permit work with products of any number of dimensions,
for an equation of the form x4 5abcd is equivalent to one involving
products of ratios of lines such as x/ax/b 5c/xd/x.</p>
<p>Having developed the theory of proportions in Book V, Euclid
exploited it in Book VI by proving theorems concerning ratios and
proportions related to similar triangles, parallelograms, and other
polygons. Noteworthy is Proposition 31, a generalization of the
Pythagorean theorem: “In right-angled triangles the figure on the side
subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly
described figures on the sides containing the right angle.” Proclus
credits this extension to Euclid himself. Book VI also contains (in
Propositions 28 and 29) a generalization of the method of application of
areas, for the sound basis for proportion given in Book V now enabled
the author to make free use of the concept of similarity. The rectangles
of Book II are now replaced by parallelograms, and it is required to
apply to a given straight line a parallelogram equal to a given
rectilinear figure and deficient (or exceeding) by a parallelogram
similar to a given parallelogram. These constructions, like those of
II.5 6, are in reality solutions of the quadratic equations bx5ac6x2,
subject to the restriction (implied in IX.27) that the discriminant is
not negative.</p>
<p>Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid is often mistakenly thought of as restricted
to geometry. We already have described two books (II and V) that are
almost exclusively algebraic; three books (VII, VIII, and IX) are
devoted to the theory of numbers. The word “number,” to the Greeks,
always referred to what we call the natural numbers—the positive whole
numbers or integers. Book VII opens with a list of twenty-two
definitions distinguishing various types of numbers—odd and even, prime
and composite, plane and solid (that is, those that are products of two
or three integers)—and finally defining a perfect number as “that which
is equal to its own parts.” The theorems in Books VII, VIII, and IX are
likely to be familiar to the reader who has had an elementary course in
the theory of numbers, but the language of the proofs will certainly be
unfamiliar. Throughout these books, each number is represented by a line
segment, so that Euclid will speak of a number as AB. (The discovery of
the incommensurable had shown that not all line segments could be
associated with whole numbers, but the converse statement—that numbers
can always be represented by line segments—obviously remains true.)
Hence, Euclid does not use the phrases “is a multiple of” or “is a
factor of,” for he replaces these by “is measured by” and “measures,”
respectively. That is, a number n is measured by another number m if
there is a third number k such that n5km.</p>
<p>Book VII opens with two propositions that constitute a celebrated
rule in the theory of numbers, which today is known as “Euclid’s
algorithm” for finding the greatest common divisor (measure) of two
numbers. It is a scheme suggestive of a repeated inverse application of
the axiom of Eudoxus. Given two unequal numbers, one subtracts the
smaller a from the larger b repeatedly until a remainder r1 less than
the smaller is obtained; then, one repeatedly subtracts this remainder
r1 from a until a remainder r2 ,r1 results; then, one repeatedly
subtracts r2 from r1; and so on. Ultimately, the process will lead to a
remainder rn, which will measure rn 1, hence all preceding remainders,
as well as a and b; this number rn will be the greatest common divisor
of a and b. Among succeeding propositions, we find equivalents of
familiar theorems in arithmetic. Thus, Proposition 8 states that if
an5bm and cn5dm, then (a2c)n5(b2d)m; Proposition 24 states that if a and
b are prime to c, then ab is prime to c. The book closes with a rule
(Proposition 39) for finding the least common multiple of several
numbers.</p>
<p>Book VIII is one of the less rewarding of the thirteen books of the
Elements. It opens with propositions on numbers in continued proportion
(geometric progression) and then turns to some simple properties of
squares and cubes, closing with Proposition 27: “Similar solid numbers
have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.”
This statement simply means that if we have a “solid number” mamb3 3mc
and a “similar solid number” nanbnc, then their ratio will be m :n —that
is, as a cube is to a cube.</p>
<p>Book IX, the last of the three books on the theory of numbers,
contains several theorems that are of special interest. Of these, the
most celebrated is Proposition 20: “Prime numbers are more than any
assigned multitude of prime numbers.” Euclid here gives the well-known
elementary proof that the number of primes is infinite. The proof is
indirect, for one shows that the assumption of a finite number of primes
leads to a contradiction. Let P be the product of all of the primes,
assumed to be finite in number, and consider the number N5P11. Now, N
cannot be prime, for this would contradict the assumption that P was the
product of all primes. Hence, N is composite and must be measured by
some prime p. But p cannot be any of the prime factors in P, for then it
would have to be a factor of 1. Hence, p must be a prime different from
all of those in the product P; therefore, the assumption that P was the
product of all of the primes must be false.</p>
<p>Proposition 35 of this book contains a formula for the sum of numbers
in geometric progression, expressed in elegant but unusual terms:</p>
<p>If as many numbers as we please be in continued proportion, and there
be subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal to the first,
then as the excess of the second is to the first, so will the excess of
the last be to all those before it.</p>
<p>This statement is, of course, equivalent to the formula</p>
<p>an112a1 a2 2a1</p>
<p>5 ;</p>
<p>a1 1a2 1?1an a1</p>
<p>which in turn is equivalent to</p>
<p>a2arn</p>
<p>Sn 5:</p>
<p>12r</p>
<p>The following and last proposition in Book IX is the well-known
formula for perfect numbers: “If as many numbers as we please, beginning
from unity, be set out continuously in double proportion until the sum
of all becomes prime, and if the sum is multiplied by the last, the
product will be perfect.” That is, in modern notation, if Sn 5112122 1?1
2n 1 52n 21 is prime, then 2n 1(2n 21) is a perfect number. The proof is
easily established in terms of the definition of a perfect number given
in Book VII. The ancient Greeks knew the first four perfect numbers: 6,
28, 496, and 8128. Euclid did not answer the converse question— whether
his formula provides all perfect numbers. It is now known that all even
perfect numbers are of Euclid’s type, but the question of the existence
of odd perfect numbers remains an unsolved problem. Of the two dozen
perfect numbers now known, all are even, but to conclude by induction
that all must be even would be hazardous.</p>
<p>In Propositions 21 through 36 of Book IX, there is a unity that
suggests that these theorems were at one time a self-contained
mathematical system, possibly the oldest in the history of mathematics
and stemming presumably from the middle or early fifth century BCE. It
has even been suggested that Propositions 1 through 36 of Book IX were
taken over by Euclid, without essential changes, from a Pythagorean
textbook.</p>
