<h4 id="al-khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</h4>
<p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (ca. 780 ca. 850) wrote more than half
a dozen astronomical and mathematical works, of which the earliest were
probably based on the Sindhind. Besides astronomical tables and
treatises on the astrolabe and the sundial, al-Khwarizmi wrote two books
on arithmetic and algebra that played very important roles in the
history of mathematics. One of these survives only in a unique copy of a
Latin translation with the title De numero indorum, the original Arabic
version having since been lost. In this work, based presumably on an
Arabic translation of Brahmagupta, al-Khwarizmi gave so full an account
of the Hindu numerals that he is probably responsible for the widespread
but false impression that our system of numeration is Arabic in origin.
Al-Khwarizmi made no claim to originality in connection with the system,
the Hindu source of which he assumed as a matter of course, but when
Latin translations of his work subsequently appeared in Europe, cursory
readers began to attribute not only the book but also the numeration to
the author. The new notation came to be known as that of al-Khwarizmi
or, more carelessly, algorismi; ultimately, the scheme of numeration
that made use of the Hindu numerals came to be called simply “algorism”
or “algorithm,” a word that, originally derived from the name
al-Khwarizmi, now means, more generally, any peculiar rule of procedure
or operation—such as the Euclidean method for finding the greatest
common divisor.</p>
<p>Al-Jabr</p>
<p>Through his arithmetic, al-Khwarizmi’s name has become a common
English word; through the title of his most important book, Hisob
al-jabr wa’l muqabalah, he has supplied us with an even more popular
household term. From this title has come the word “algebra,” for it is
from this book that Europe later learned the branch of mathematics
bearing this name. Neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made
use of syncopation or of negative numbers. Nevertheless, the Al-jabr
comes closer to the elementary algebra of today than do the works of
either Diophantus or Brahmagupta, for the book is not concerned with
difficult problems in indeterminate analysis but with a straightforward
and elementary exposition of the solution of equations, especially of
the second degree. The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from
premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization—respects in
which</p>
<p>neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled. The Hindus were strong in
association and analogy, in intuition and an aesthetic and imaginative
flair, whereas the Arabs were more practical-minded and down-to-earth in
their approach to mathematics.</p>
<p>The Al-jabr has come down to us in two versions, Latin and Arabic,
but in the Latin translation, Liber algebrae et al mucabala, a
considerable portion of the Arabic draft is missing. The Latin, for
example, has no preface, perhaps because the author’s preface in Arabic
gave fulsome praise to Mohammed, the prophet, and to al-Mamun, “the
Commander of the Faithful.” Al-Khwarizmi wrote that the latter had
encouraged him to</p>
<p>compose a short work on Calculating by (the rules of) Completion and
Reduction, confining it to what is easiest and most useful in
arithmetic, such as men constantly require in cases of inheritance,
legacies, partitions, lawsuits, and trade, and in all their dealings
with one another, or where the measuring of lands, the digging of
canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of various sorts and
kinds are concerned (Karpinski 1915, p. 96).</p>
<p>It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but
the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the previous
translation. The word “al-jabr” presumably meant something like
“restoration” or “completion” and seems to refer to the transposition of
subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word “muqabalah”
is said to refer to “reduction” or “balancing”—that is, the cancellation
of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. Arabic influence in
Spain long after the time of al-Khwarizmi is found in Don Quixote, where
the word “algebrista” is used for a bone-setter, that is, a
“restorer.”</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra opens with a brief
introductory statement of the positional principle for numbers and then
proceeds to the solution, in six short chapters, of the six types of
equations made up of the three kinds of quantities: roots, squares, and
numbers (i.e., x, x2, and numbers). Chapter I, in three short
paragraphs, covers the case of squares equal to roots, expressed in
modern notation as x2 55x, x2 /3 54x, and 5x2 510x, giving the answers x
55, x 512, and x52, respectively. (The root x 50 was not recognized.)
Chapter II covers the case of squares equal to numbers, and Chapter III
solves the case of roots equal to numbers, again with three
illustrations per chapter to cover the cases in which the coefficient of
the variable term is equal to, more than, or less than 1. Chapters IV,
V, and VI are more interesting, for they cover in turn the three
classical cases of three-term quadratic equations: (1) squares and roots
equal to numbers, (2) squares and numbers equal to roots, and (3) roots
and numbers equal to squares. The solutions are “cookbook” rules for
“completing the square” applied to specific instances. Chapter IV, for
example, includes the three illustrations x2 110x 539, 2x2 110x548, and
12x2 15x528. In each case, only the positive answer is given. In Chapter
V, only a single example, x2 121510x, is used, but both roots, 3 and 7,
are given, corresponding to the rule x557p25221. Al-Khwarizmi here calls
attention to the fact that what we designate as the discriminant must be
positive:</p>
<p>You ought to understand also that when you take the half of the roots
in this form of equation and then multiply the half by itself; if that
which proceeds or results from the multiplication is less than the units
abovementioned as accompanying the square, you have an equation.</p>
<p>In Chapter VI, the author again uses only a single example, 3x145x2,
for whenever the coefficient of x2 is not unity, the author reminds us
to divide first by this coefficient (as in Chapter IV). Once more, the
steps in completing the square are meticulously indicated, without
justification, the procedure being equivalent to the solution
negative.pð 12Þ2</p>
<p>x511 1 14. Again, only one root is given, for the other is</p>
<p>The six cases of equations given previously exhaust all possibilities
for linear and quadratic equations having a positive root. The
arbitrariness of the rules and the strictly numerical form of the six
chapters remind us of ancient Babylonianandmedieval Indian
mathematics.The exclusionof indeterminate analysis, a favorite Hindu
topic, and the avoidance of any syncopation, such as is found in
Brahmagupta, might suggest Mesopotamia as more likely a source than
India. As we read beyond the sixth chapter, however, an entirely new
light is thrown on the question. Al-Khwarizmi continues:</p>
<p>We have said enough so far as numbers are concerned, about the six
types of equations. Now, however, it is necessary that we should
demonstrate
geometricallythetruthofthesameproblemswhichwehaveexplainedinnumbers.</p>
<p>The ring in this passage is obviously Greek, rather than Babylonian
or</p>
<p>Indian. There are thus three main schools of thought on the origin of
Arabic algebra: one emphasizes Hindu influences; another stresses the
Mesopotamian, or Syriac-Persian, tradition; and the third points to
Greek inspiration. The truth is probably approached if we combine the
three theories. The philosophers of Islam admired Aristotle to the point
of aping him, but eclectic Mohammedan mathematicians seem to have chosen
appropriate elements from various sources.</p>
<p>Geometric Foundation</p>
<p>TheAlgebraofal-KhwarizmibetraysunmistakableHellenicelements,but the
first geometric demonstrations have little in common with classical
Greek mathematics. For the equation x2 110x539, al-Khwarizmi drew a
square, ab, to represent x2, and on the four sides of this square he
placed rectangles c, d, e, and f, each 2 units wide. To complete the
larger square, one must add the four small corner squares (dotted in
Fig. 11.1), each of which has an area of 6 units. Hence, to “complete
the square” we add 4 times 6 units, or 25 units, thus obtaining a square
of total area 391 25564 units (as is clear from the right-hand side of
the given equation). The side of the large square must therefore be 8
units, from which we subtract 2times 2,or5,unitstofindthatx53, thus
provingthattheanswer found in Chapter IV is correct.</p>
<p>The geometric proofs for Chapters V and VI are somewhat more
involved. For the equation x2 121510x, the author draws the square ab to
represent x2 and the rectangle bg to represent 21 units. Then the large
rectangle, comprising the square and the rectangle bg, must have an area
equal to 10x, so that the side ag or hd must be 10 units. If, then, one
bisects hd at e, draws et perpendicular to hd, extends te to c so that
tc5tg, and completes the squares tclg and cmne (Fig. 11.2), the area tb
is equal to the area md. But the square tl is 25, and the gnomon tenmlg
is 21 (because the gnomon is equal to the rectangle bg). Hence, the
square nc is 4, and its side ec is 2. Inasmuch as ec5be, and because
he55, we see that x5hb5522 or 3, which proves that the arithmetic
solution given in Chapter V is correct. A modified diagram is given for

<p>FIG. 11.2</p>
<p>x551257, and an analogous type of figure is used to justify
geometrically the result found algebraically in Chapter VI.</p>
<p>Algebraic Problems</p>
<p>A comparison of Fig. 11.2, taken from al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, with
diagrams found in the Elements of Euclid in connection with Greek
geometric algebra leads to the inevitable conclusion that Arabic algebra
had much in common with Greek geometry; however, the first, or
arithmetic, part of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra is obviously alien to Greek
thought. What apparently happened in Baghdad was just what one would
expect in a cosmopolitan intellectual center. Arabic scholars had great
admiration for Greek astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and
philosophy—subjects that they mastered as best they could. Yet, they
could scarcely help but notice the same thing that the Nestorian bishop
Sebokt had observed when in 662 he first called attention to the nine
marvelous digits of the Hindus: “There are also others who know
something.” It is probable that al-Khwarizmi typified the Arabic
eclecticism that will so frequently be observed in other cases. His
system of numeration most likely came from India, his systematic
algebraic solution of equations may have been a development from
Mesopotamia, and the logical geometric framework for his solutions was
palpably derived from Greece.</p>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi contains more than the solution of
equations, material that occupies about the first half. There are, for
example, rules for operations on binomial expressions, including
products such as (1012)(1021) and (101x)(102x). Although the Arabs
rejected negative roots and absolute negative magnitudes, they were
familiar with the rules governing what are now known as signed numbers.
There are also alternative geometric proofs of some of the author’s six
cases of equations. Finally, the Algebra includes a wide variety of
problems illustrating the six chapters or cases. As an illustration of
the fifth chapter, for example, al-Khwarizmi asks for the division of 10
into two parts in such a way that “the sum of the products obtained by
multiplying each part by itself is equal to fifty eight.” The extant
Arabic version, unlike the Latin, also includes an extended discussion
of inheritance problems, such as the following:</p>
<p>A man dies, leaving two sons behind him, and bequeathing one-third of
his capital to a stranger. He leaves ten dirhems of property and a claim
of ten dirhems upon one of the sons.</p>
<p>The answer is not what one would expect, for the stranger gets only 5
dirhems. According to Arabic law, a son who owes to the estate of his
father an amount greater than the son’s portion of the estate retains
the whole sum that he owes, one part being regarded as his share of the
estate and the remainder as a gift from his father. To some extent, it
seems to have been the complicated nature of laws governing inheritance
that encouraged the study of algebra in Arabia.</p>
<p>A Problem from Heron</p>
<p>A few of al-Khwarizmi’s problems give rather clear evidence of Arabic
dependence on the Babylonian-Heronian stream of mathematics. One of them
presumably was taken directly from Heron, for the figure and the
dimensions are the same. Within an isosceles triangle having sides of 10
yards and a base of 12 yards (Fig. 11.3), a square is to be inscribed,
and the side of this square is called for. The author of the Algebra
first finds through the Pythagorean theorem that the altitude of the
triangle is 8 yards, so that the area of the triangle is 48 square
yards. Calling the side of the square the “thing,” he notes that the
square of the “thing” will be found by taking from the area of the large
triangle the areas of the three small triangles lying outside the square
but inside the large triangle. The sum of the areas of the two</p>
<p>FIG. 11.3</p>
<p>lower small triangles he knows to be the product of the “thing” by 6
less half of the “thing,” and the area of the upper small triangle is
the product of 8 less the “thing” by half of the “thing.” Hence, he is
led to the obvious conclusion that the “thing” is 4 yards—the side of
the square. The chief difference between the form of this problem in
Heron and that of alKhwarizmi is that Heron had expressed the answer in
terms of unit fractions as 4. The similarities are so much more
pronounced than the differences that we may take this case as
confirmation of the general axiom that continuity in the history of
mathematics is the rule, rather than the exception. Where a
discontinuity seems to arise, we should first consider the possibility
that the apparent saltus may be explained by the loss of intervening
documents.</p>
