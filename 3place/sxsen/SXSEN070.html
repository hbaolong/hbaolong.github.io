<h4 id="the-conics">The Conics</h4>
<p>Of the chefs d’oeuvre of Apollonius, the Conics, only half—the first
four of the original eight books—remains extant in Greek. Fortunately,
in the ninth century Thabit ibn Qurra translated the next three books
into Arabic, and this version has survived. In 1710, Halley provided a
Latin translation of the seven books, and editions in many languages
have appeared since then.</p>
<p>The conic sections had been known for about a century and a half when
Apollonius composed his celebrated treatise on these curves. At least
twice in the interval, general surveys had been written—by Aristaeus and
by Euclid—but just as Euclid’s Elements had displaced earlier elementary
textbooks, so on the more advanced level of the conic sections the
Conics of Apollonius superseded all rivals in its field, including the
Conics of Euclid.</p>
<p>Before the time of Apollonius, the ellipse, the parabola, and the
hyperbola were derived as sections of three distinctly different types
of</p>
<p>right circular cones, according as the vertex angle was acute, right,
or obtuse. Apollonius, apparently for the first time, systematically
showed that it is not necessary to take sections perpendicular to an
element of the cone and that from a single cone one can obtain all three
varieties of conic sections simply by varying the inclination of the
cutting plane. This was an important step in linking the three types of
curve. A second important generalization was made when Apollonius
demonstrated that the cone need not be a right cone—that is, one whose
axis is perpendicular to the circular base—but can equally well be an
oblique or scalene circular cone. If Eutocius, in commenting on the
Conics, was well informed, we can infer that Apollonius was the first
geometer to show that the properties of the curves are not different
according as they are cut from oblique cones or from right cones.
Finally, Apollonius brought the ancient curves closer to the modern
point of view by replacing the single-napped cone (somewhat like a
modern ice-cream cone) by a double-napped cone (resembling two
oppositely oriented, indefinitely long ice-cream cones placed so that
the vertices coincide and the axes are in a straight line). Apollonius
gave, in fact, the same definition of a circular cone as that used
today:</p>
<p>If a straight line indefinite in length and passing always through a
fixed point be made to move around the circumference of a circle which
is not in the same plane with the point so as to pass successively
through every point of that circumference, the moving straight line will
trace out the surface of a double cone.</p>
<p>This change made the hyperbola the double-branched curve that is
familiar to us today. Geometers often referred to the “two hyperbolas,”
rather than to the “two branches” of a single hyperbola, but in either
case, the duality of the curve was recognized.</p>
<p>Concepts are more important in the history of mathematics than is
terminology, but there is more than ordinary significance in a change of
name for the conic sections that was due to Apollonius. For about a
century and a half, the curves had had no more distinctive appellations
than banal descriptions of the manner in which the curves had been
discovered—sections of an acute-angled cone (oxytome), sections of a
right-angled cone (orthotome), and sections of an obtuse-angled cone
(amblytome). Archimedes had continued using these names (although he is
reported to have also used the word “parabola” as a synonym for a
section of a right-angled cone). It was Apollonius (possibly following
up a suggestion of Archimedes) who introduced the names “ellipse” and
“hyperbola” in connection with these curves. The words “ellipse,”
“parabola,” and “hyperbola” were not newly coined for the occasion; they
were adapted from an earlier use, perhaps by the Pythagoreans, in the
solution of quadratic equations through the application of areas.
“Ellipsis” (meaning a deficiency) had been used when a rectangle of a
given area was applied to a given line segment and fell short by a
square (or other specified figure), and the word “hyperbola” (a throwing
beyond) had been adopted when the area exceeded the line segment. The
word “parabola” (a placing beside, or comparison) had indicated neither
excess nor deficiency. Apollonius now applied these words in a new
context as names for the conic sections. The familiar modern equation of
the parabola with vertex at the origin is y2 5lx (where l is the “latus
rectum,” or parameter, now often represented by 2p, or occasionally by
4p). That is, the parabola has the property that no matter what point on
the curve one chooses, the square on the ordinate is precisely equal to
the rectangle on the abscissa x and the parameter l. The equations of
the ellipse and the hyperbola, similarly referred to a vertex as origin,
are ðx7aÞ2=a2 6y2=b2 51, or2 y2 5lx7b2x2=a2 (where l again is the latus2
rectum, or parameter, 2b /a). That is, for the ellipse y ,lx and for the
hyperbola y2 .lx, and it is the properties of the curves that are
represented by these inequalities that prompted the names given by
Apollonius more than two millennia ago, names that are still firmly
attached to them. The commentator Eutocius was responsible for an
erroneous impression, still fairly widespread, that the words “ellipse,”
“parabola,” and “hyperbola” were adopted by Apollonius to indicate that
the cutting plane fell short of or ran along with or ran into the second
nappe of the cone. This is not at all what Apollonius reported in the
Conics.</p>
<p>In deriving all conic sections from a single double-napped oblique
circular cone and in giving them eminently appropriate names, Apollonius
made an important contribution to geometry, but he failed to go as far
in generality as he might have. He could as well have begun with an
elliptic cone—or with any quadric cone—and still have derived the same
curves. That is, any plane section of Apollonius’s “circular” cone could
have served as the generating curve or “base” in his definition, and the
designation “circular cone” is unnecessary. In fact, as Apollonius
himself showed (Book I, Proposition 5), every oblique circular cone has
not only an infinite number of circular sections parallel to the base,
but also another infinite set of circular sections given by what he
called subcontrary sections. Let BFC be the base of the oblique circular
cone and let ABC be a triangular section of the cone (Fig. 7.2). Let P
be any point on a circular section DPE parallel to BFC and let HPK be a
section by a plane such that triangles AHK and ABC are similar but
oppositely oriented. Apollonius then called the section HPK a
subcontrary section and showed that it is a circle. The proof is easily
established in terms of the similarity of triangles HMD and EMK, from
which it follows that HMMK5DMME5PM2, the characteristic property of a
circle. (In the language of analytic geometry, if we let HM5x, HK5a, and
PM5y, then y2 5x(a x) or x2 1y2 5ax, which is the equation of a
circle.)</p>
<p>Fundamental Properties</p>
<p>Greek geometers divided curves into three categories. The first,
known as “plane loci,” consisted of all straight lines and circles; the
second, known as “solid loci,” was made up of all conic sections; the
third category, known as “linear loci,” lumped together all other
curves. The name applied to the second category was undoubtedly
suggested by the fact that the conics were not defined as loci in a
plane that satisfy a certain condition, as is done today; they were
described stereometrically as sections of a three-dimensional figure.
Apollonius, like his predecessors, derived his curves from a cone in
three-dimensional space, but he dispensed with the cone as promptly as
possible. From the cone, he derived a fundamental plane property or
“symptome” for the section, and thereafter he proceeded with a purely
planimetric study based on this property. This step, which we here
illustrate for the ellipse (Book I, Proposition 13), probably was much
the same as that used by his predecessors, including Menaechmus. Let ABC
be a triangular section of an oblique circular cone (Fig. 7.3), and let
P be any point on a section HPK cutting all elements of the cone. Extend
HK to meet BC in G and through P pass a horizontal plane, cutting the
cone in the circle DPE and the plane HPK in the line PM. Draw DME, a
diameter of the circle perpendicular to PM. Then, from the similarity of
triangles HDM and HBG we have DM/HM5BG/HC, and from the similarity of
triangles MEK and KCG we have ME/MK5CG/KG. Now, from the property of the
circle we have PM2 5DMME; hence, PM2 5(HMBG/HG) (MKCG)/KG. If PM5y,
HM5x, and HK52a2, the property in the preceding sentence is equivalent
to the equation y 5kx(2a2x), which we recognize as the equation of an
ellipse with H as vertex and HK as</p>
<p>FIG. 7.3</p>
<p>major axis. In a similar manner, Apollonius derived for the hyperbola
the equivalent of the equation y2 5kx(x12a). These forms are easily
reconciled with the previously mentioned “name” forms by taking k5b2 /a2
and l52b2 /a.</p>
<p>Conjugate Diameters</p>
<p>After Apollonius had derived from a stereometric consideration of the
cone the basic relationship between what we should now call the plane
coordinatesofapointonthecurve—givenbythethree equationsy2 5lx2 b2x2 /a2,
y2 5lx, and y2 5lx1b2x2 /a—he derived further properties from the plane
equations without reference to the cone. The author of the Conics
reported that in Book I he had worked out the fundamental properties of
the curves “more fully and generally than in the writings of other
authors.” The extent to which this statement holds true is suggested by
the fact that here, in the very first book, the theory of conjugate
diameters of a conic is developed. That is, Apollonius showed that the
midpoints of a set of chords parallel to one diameter of an ellipse or a
hyperbola will constitute a second diameter, the two being called
“conjugate diameters.” In fact, whereas today we invariably refer a
conic to a pair of mutually perpendicular lines as axes, Apollonius
generally used a pair of conjugate diameters as equivalents of oblique
coordinate axes. The system of conjugate diameters provided an
exceptionally useful frame of reference for a conic, for Apollonius
showed that if a line is drawn through an extremity of one diameter of
an ellipse or a hyperbola parallel to the conjugate diameter, the line
“will touch the conic, and no other straight line can fall between it
and the conic”—that is, the line will be tangent to the conic. Here we
see clearly the Greek static concept of a tangent to a curve, in
contrast to the Archimedean kinematic view. In fact, often in the Conics
we find a diameter and a tangent at its extremity used as a coordinate
frame of reference.</p>
<p>Among the theorems in Book I are several (Propositions 41 through 49)
that are tantamount to a transformation of coordinates from a system
based on the tangent and the diameter through a point P on the conic to
a new system determined by a tangent and a diameter at a second point Q
on the same curve, together with the demonstration that a conic can be
referred to as any such system as axes. In particular, Apollonius was
familiar with the properties of the hyperbola and referred to its
asymptotes as axes, given, for the equilateral hyperbola, by the
equation xy5c2. He had no way of knowing, of course, that someday this
relationship would be fundamental in the study of gases or that his
study of the ellipse would be essential to modern astronomy.</p>
<p>Book II continues the study of conjugate diameters and tangents. For
example, if P is any point on any hyperbola, with center C, the tangent
at P will cut the asymptotes in points L and Lu (Fig. 7.4) that are
equidistant from P (Propositions 8 and 10). Moreover (Propositions 11
and 16), any chord QQu parallel to CP will meet the asymptotes in points
K and Ku such that QK5QuKu and QKQK5CP2. (These properties were verified
synthetically, but the reader can double-check their validity by the use
of modern analytic methods.) Later propositions in Book II show how to
draw tangents to a conic by making use of the theory of harmonic
division. In the case of the ellipse (Proposition 49), for example, if Q
is a point on the curve (Fig. 7.5), Apollonius dropped a perpendicular
QN from Q to the axis AAu and found the harmonic conjugate T of N with
respect to A and Au. (That is, he found the point T on line AAu extended
such that AT/AuT5AN/NAu; in other words, he determined the point T that
divides the segment AAu externally in the same ratio as N divides AAu
internally.) The line through T and Q, then, will be tangent to the
ellipse. The case in which Q does not lie on the curve can be reduced to
this through familiar properties of harmonic division. (It can be proved
that there are no plane curves other than the conic sections such that
given the curve and a point, a tangent can be drawn, with
straightedge</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>T A’</p>
<p>FIG. 7.5</p>
<p>and compass, from the point to the curve, but this was, of course,
unknown to Apollonius.)</p>
<p>The Three- and Four-Line Locus</p>
<p>Apollonius was apparently especially proud of Book III, for in the
general preface to the Conics he wrote:</p>
<p>The third book contains many remarkable theorems useful for the
synthesis of solid loci and determinations of limits; the most and
prettiest of these theorems are new and, when I had discovered them, I
observed that Euclid had not worked out the synthesis of the locus with
respect to three and four lines, but only a chance portion of it and
that not successfully: for it was not possible that the synthesis could
have been completed without my additional discoveries.</p>
<p>The three- and four-line locus to which reference is made played an
important role in mathematics from Euclid to Newton. Given three lines
(or four lines) in a plane, find the locus of a point P that moves so
that the square of the distance from P to one of these is proportional
to the product of the distances to the other two (or, in the case of
four lines, the product of the distances to two of them is proportional
to the product of the distances to the other two), the distances being
measured at given angles with respect to the lines. Through modern
analytic methods, including the normal form of the straight line, it is
easy to show that the locus is a conic section—real or imaginary,
reducible or irreducible. If, for the three-line locus, equations of the
given lines are A1x1B1y1 C1 50, A2x1B2y1C2 50, and A3x1B3y1C3 50, and if
the angles at which the distances are to be measured are θ1, θ2, and θ3,
then the locus of</p>
<p>P(x, y) is given by</p>
<p>ðA1x2 1B21y1C2 1Þ2 KðA2x1B2y1C2Þ ðA3x1B3y1C3Þ</p>
<p>5 U :</p>
<p>ðA1 1B1Þ sin θ1 pA22 1B22 sin θ2 pA23B23 sin θ3</p>
<p>This equation is, in general, of second degree in x and y; hence, the
locus is a conic section. Our solution does not do justice to the
treatment given by Apollonius in Book III, in which more than fifty
carefully worded propositions, all proved by synthetic methods, lead
eventually to the required locus. Half a millennium later, Pappus
suggested a generalization of this theorem for n lines, where n.4, and
it was against this generalized problem that Descartes in 1637 tested
his analytic geometry. Thus, few problems have played as important a
role in the history of mathematics as did the “locus to three and four
lines.”</p>
<p>Intersecting Conics</p>
<p>Book IV of the Conics is described by its author as showing “in how
many ways the sections of cones meet one another,” and he is especially
proud of theorems, “none of which has been discussed by earlier
writers,” concerning the number of points in which a section of a cone
meets the “opposite branches of a hyperbola.” The idea of the hyperbola
as a double-branched curve was new with Apollonius, and he thoroughly
enjoyed the discovery and the proof of theorems concerning it. It is in
connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a
statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded
opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the
usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted, “They are
worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in
the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and
for no other reason” (Heath 1961, p. lxxiv).</p>
<p>Books V VII</p>
<p>The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines
drawn to a conic, again argues that “the subject is one of those which
seem worthy of study for their own sake.” Although one must admire the
author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently
pointed out that what in his day was beautiful theory, with no prospect
of applicability to the science or the engineering of his time, has
since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and
celestial mechanics. Apollonius’s theorems on maxima and minima are in
reality theorems on tangents and normals to conic sections. Without
knowledge of the properties of tangents to a parabola, an analysis of
local trajectories would be impossible, and a study of the paths of the
planets is unthinkable without reference to the tangents to an ellipse.
It is clear, in other words, that it was the pure mathematics of
Apollonius that made possible, some 1,800 years later, the Principia of
Newton; the latter, in turn, gave scientists of the 1960s the hope that
a round-trip visit to the moon would be possible. Even in ancient
Greece, the Apollonian theorem that every oblique cone has two families
of circular sections was applicable to cartography in the stereographic
transformation, used by Ptolemy and possibly by Hipparchus, of a
spherical region into a portion of a plane. It has often been true in
the development of mathematics that topics that originally could be
justified only as “worthy of study for their own sake” later became of
inestimable value to the “practical man.”</p>
<p>Greek mathematicians had no satisfactory definition of tangent to a
curve C at a point P, thinking of it as a line L such that no other line
could be drawn through P between C and L. Perhaps it was dissatisfaction
with this definition that led Apollonius to avoid defining a normal to a
curve C from a point Q as a line through Q that cuts the curve C in a
point P and is perpendicular to the tangent to C at P. Instead, he made
use of the fact that the normal from Q to C is a line such that the
distance from Q to C is a relative maximum or minimum. In Conics V.8,
for example, Apollonius proved a theorem concerning the normal to a
parabola, which today is generally part of a course in the calculus. In
modern terminology, the theorem states that the subnormal of the
parabola y2 52px for any point P on the curve is constant and equal to
p; in the language of Apollonius, this property is expressed somewhat as
follows:</p>
<p>If A is the vertex of a parabola y2 5px, and if G is a point on the
axis such that AG.p, and, if N is a point between A and G such that NG
5p, and if NP is drawn perpendicular to the axis meeting the parabola in
P 〔Fig. 7.6〕, then PG is the minimum straight line from G to the curve
and hence is normal to the parabola at P.</p>
<p>The proof by Apollonius is ofthe typicalindirectkind—it is shownthat
if Pu isany other point on the parabola, PuG increases asPu moves
further from P in either direction. A proof of the corresponding, but
more involved, theorem concerning the normal to an ellipse or a
hyperbola from a point on the axis is then given, and it is shown that
if P is a point on a conic, only one normal can be drawn through P,
whether the normal be regarded as a minimum or a maximum, and this
normal is perpendicular to the tangent at
P.Notethattheperpendicularitythatwetakeasadefinitionishereprovedas a
theorem, whereas the maximum-minimum property that we take as a</p>
<p>theoremserves,forApollonius,asadefinition.LaterpropositionsinBookV
carry the topic of normals to a conic to such a point that the author
gives criteria enabling one to tell how many normals can be drawn from a
given point to a conic section. These criteria are tantamount to what we
should describe as theequations of theevolutesto theconics. Forthe

is, points on this cubic are the centers of curvature for points on the
conic (in other words, the centers of osculating circles for the
parabola). In the case of the ellipse and the hyperbola, whose equations
are, respectively, x2 /a2 6 y2 /b2 51, the corresponding equations of
the evolute are ðaxÞ2=3 6 ðbyÞ2=3 5ða2 7 b2Þ2=3.</p>

rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes HA and HR, intersecting the
parabola in a point P. Line QP is the normal required, as one can prove
by showing that NK5HM5p. If point Q lies inside the parabola, the
construction is similar, except that P lies between Q and R. Apollonius
also gave constructions, likewise making use of an auxiliary hyperbola,
for the normal from a point to a given ellipse or hyperbola. It should
be noted that the construction of normals to the ellipse and the
hyperbola, unlike the construction of tangents, requires more than a
straightedge and a compass. As the ancients described the two problems,
the drawing of a tangent to a conic is a “plane problem,” for
intersecting circles and straight lines suffice. By contrast, the
drawing of a normal from an arbitrary point in the plane to a given
central conic is a “solid problem,” for it cannot be accomplished by the
use of lines and circles alone but can be done through the use of solid
loci (in our case, a hyperbola). Pappus later severely criticized
Apollonius for his construction of a normal to the</p>
<p>parabola, in that he treated it as a solid problem, rather than a
plane problem. That is, the hyperbola that Apollonius used could have
been replaced by a circle. Perhaps Apollonius felt that the
line-and-circle fetish should give way, in his construction of normals,
to a desire for uniformity of approach with respect to the three types
of conics.</p>
<p>Apollonius described the sixth book of the Conics as embracing
propositions about “segments of conics equal and unequal, similar and
dissimilar, besides some other matters left out by those who have
preceded me. In particular, you will find in this book how, in a given
right cone, a section is to be cut equal to a given section.” Two conics
are said to be similar if the ordinates, when drawn to the axis at
proportional distances from the vertex, are respectively proportional to
the corresponding abscissas. Among the easier of the propositions in
Book VI are those demonstrating that all parabolas are similar (VI.11)
and that a parabola cannot be similar to an ellipse or a hyperbola nor
an ellipse to a hyperbola (VI.14, 15). Other propositions (VI.26, 27)
prove that if any cone is cut by two parallel planes making hyperbolic
or elliptic sections, the sections will be similar but not equal.</p>
<p>Book VII returns to the subject of conjugate diameters and “many new
propositions concerning diameters of sections and the figures described
upon them.” Among these are some that are found in modern textbooks,
such as the proof (VII.12, 13, 29, 30) that</p>
<p>In every ellipse the sum, and in every hyperbola the difference, of
the squares on any two conjugate diameters is equal to the sum or
difference respectively of the squares on the axes.</p>
<p>There is also the proof of the familiar theorem that if tangents are
drawn at the extremities of a pair of conjugate axes of an ellipse or a
hyperbola, the parallelogram formed by these four tangents will be equal
to the rectangle on the axes. It has been conjectured that the lost Book
VIII of the Conics continued with similar problems, for in the preface
to Book VII the author wrote that the theorems of Book VII were used in
Book VIII to solve determinate conic problems, so that the last book “is
by way of an appendix.”</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<p>The Conics of Apollonius is a treatise of such extraordinary breadth
and depth that we are startled to note the omission of some of the
properties that to us appear so obviously fundamental. As the curves are
now introduced in textbooks, the foci play a prominent role, yet
Apollonius had no name for these points, and he referred to them only
indirectly. It is not clear whether the author was aware of the
now-familiar role of the directrix. He seems to have known how to
determine a conic through five points, but this topic is omitted in the
Conics. It is quite possible, of course, that some or all such
tantalizing omissions resulted from the fact that they had been treated
elsewhere, in works no longer extant, by Apollonius or other authors. So
much of ancient mathematics has been lost that an argument e silencio is
precarious indeed.</p>
<p>Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes;
moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed a
posteriori on a given curve in order to study its properties. Of Greek
geometry, we may say that equations are determined by curves, but not
that curves were defined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and
equations were subsidiary notions derived from a specific geometric
situation, and one gathers that in the Greek view, it was not sufficient
to define curves abstractly as loci satisfying given conditions on two
coordinates. To guarantee that a locus was really a curve, the ancients
felt it incumbent on them to exhibit it stereometrically as a section of
a solid or to describe a kinematic mode of construction.</p>
<p>TheGreekdefinitionandstudyofcurveslackedtheflexibilityandextent of
the modern treatment. Although the Greeks were esthetically one of the
most gifted peoples of all times, the only curves that they explored in
the heavens and on the earth were combinations of circles and straight
lines.ThatApollonius,thegreatestgeometerofantiquity,failedtodevelop
analytic geometry, was probably the result of a poverty of curves,
rather than of thought. Moreover, the early modern inventors of analytic
geometry had all of Renaissance algebra at their disposal, whereas
Apollonius necessarily worked with the more rigorous but far more
awkward tool of geometric algebra.</p>

<p>ChangingTrends</p>
<p>Today, we use the conventional phrase “Greek mathematics” as if it
indicates a homogeneous and well-defined body of doctrine. Such a view
can be very misleading, however, for it implies that the sophisticated
geometry of the Archimedean-Apollonian type was the only sort that the
Hellenes knew. We must remember that mathematics in the Greek world
spanned a time interval from at least 600 BCE to at least 600 CE and
that it traveled from Ionia to the toe of Italy, to Athens, to
Alexandria, and to other parts of the civilized world. The paucity of
surviving works, especially on the lower level, tends to obscure the
fact that our knowledge about the Greek world is far from complete.</p>
<p>The death of Archimedes by the hand of a Roman soldier may have been
inadvertent, but it was truly portentous. Both Perge and Syracuse</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Erat o s t hene s</p>
<p>would flourish under Roman control, but during its long history,
ancient Rome contributed little to science or philosophy and less to
mathematics. Whether during the Republic or in the days of the Empire,
Romans were little attracted to speculative or logical investigation.
The practical arts of medicine and agriculture were cultivated with some
eagerness, and descriptive geography met with favor. Impressive
engineering projects and architectural monuments were related to the
simpler aspects of science, but Roman builders were satisfied with
elementary rule-of-thumb procedures that called for little in the way of
understanding of the great corpus of theoretical Greek thought. The
extent of Roman acquaintance with science may be judged from the De
architectura of Vitruvius, written during the middle part of the
Augustine Age and dedicated to the emperor. At one point, the author
describes what to him appeared to be the three greatest mathematical
discoveries: the incommensurability of the side and the diagonal of a
cube; the right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5; and Archimedes’
calculation on the composition of the king’s crown. It is sometimes
claimed that impressive works of engineering, such as the Egyptian
pyramids and the Roman aqueducts, imply a high level of mathematical
achievement, but historical evidence does not bear this out.</p>
<p>The two major institutions associated with mathematics in ancient
Greece, the Academy in Athens and the Library in Alexandria, were
subject to several changes in direction before their eventual demise.
The Academy no longer maintained the strong support of mathematical
studies that Plato had made mandatory; by the time of Proclus, a renewed
interest in mathematics can be attributed to its role as safe haven for
Neoplatonists. The Museum and Library at Alexandria no longer benefited
from the support they had been given by the first two Ptolemies, and
even Cleopatra, the last ruling Ptolemy, who is said to have enjoyed the
Museum gatherings, probably could not have persuaded either Antony or
Caesar to fund its scholarly pursuits.</p>
