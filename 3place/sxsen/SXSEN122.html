<h4 id="the-latitude-of-forms">The Latitude of Forms</h4>
<p>The notion of irrational powers may have been Oresme’s most brilliant
idea, but it was not in this direction that he was most influential. For
almost a century before his time, Scholastic philosophers had been
discussing the quantification of variable “forms,” a concept of
Aristotle roughly equivalent to qualities. Among these forms were such
things as the velocity of a moving object and the variation in
temperature from point to point in an object with nonuniform
temperature. The discussions were interminably prolix, for the available
tools of analysis were inappropriate. Despite this handicap, the
logicians at Merton College had reached, as we saw, an important theorem
concerning the mean value of a “uniformly difform” form—that is, one in
which the rate of change of the rate of change is constant. Oresme was
well aware of this result, and a brilliant thought occurred to him,
sometime before 1361—why not draw a picture or a graph of the way in
which things vary? Here we see, of course, an early suggestion of what
we now describe as the graphical representation of functions. Marshall
Clagett has found what looks like an earlier graph, drawn by Giovanni di
Cosali, in which the line of longitude is placed in a vertical position
(Clagett 1959, pp. 332 333, 414). The exposition of Oresme surpasses
that of Cosali in clarity and influence, however.</p>
<p>Everything measurable, Oresme wrote, is imaginable in the manner of
continuous quantity; hence, he drew a velocity-time graph for a body
moving with uniform acceleration. Along a horizontal line, he marked
points that represented instants of time (or longitudes), and for each
instant he drew perpendicular to the line of longitudes a line segment
(latitude) the length of which represented the velocity. The end points
of these segments, he saw, lie along a straight line, and if the
uniformly accelerated motion starts from rest, the totality of velocity
lines (which we call ordinates) will make up the area of a right
triangle (see Fig. 12.2). Inasmuch as this area represents the distance
covered, Oresme has provided a geometric verification of the Merton
rule, for the velocity at the midpoint of the time interval is half of
the terminal velocity. Moreover, the diagram obviously leads to the law
of motion generally ascribed to Galileo in the seventeenth century. It
is clear from the geometric diagram that the area in the first half of
the time is to that in the second half in the ratio 1 : 3. If we
subdivide the time into three equal parts, the distances covered (given
by the areas) are in the ratio 1 : 3 : 5. For four equal subdivisions,
the</p>
<p>distances are in the ratio 1:3:5:7. In general, as Galileo later
observed, the distances are to one another as the odd numbers, and
because the sum of the first n consecutive odd numbers is the square of
n, the total distance covered varies as the square of the time, the
familiar Galilean law for falling bodies.</p>
<p>The terms “latitude” and “longitude” that Oresme used are in a
general sense equivalent to our ordinate and abscissa, and his graphical
representation is akin to our analytic geometry. His use of coordinates
was not, of course, new, for Apollonius and others before him had used
coordinate systems, but Oresme’s graphical representation of a variable
quantity was novel. He seems to have grasped the essential principle
that a function of one unknown can be represented as a curve, but he was
unable to make any effective use of this observation except in the case
of the linear function. Moreover, Oresme was chiefly interested in the
area under the curve; hence, it is not very likely that he saw that
every plane curve can be represented, with respect to a coordinate
system, as a function of one variable. Where we say that the velocity
graph in uniformly accelerated motion is a straight line, Oresme wrote,
“Any uniformly difform quality terminating in zero intensity is imagined
as a right triangle.” That is, Oresme was more concerned with (1) the
way in which the function varies (that is, the differential equation of
the curve), and (2) the way in which the area under the curve varies
(that is, the integral of the function). He pointed out the
constant-slope property for his graph of uniformly accelerated motion—an
observation equivalent to the modern two-point equation of the line in
analytic geometry and leading to the concept of the differential
triangle. Moreover, in finding the distance function, the area, Oresme
is obviously performing a simple integration geometrically that results
in the Merton rule. He did not explain why the area under a
velocity-time curve represents the distance covered, but it is probable
that he thought of the area as made up of many vertical lines or
indivisibles, each of which represented a velocity that continued for a
very short time.</p>
<p>Inf ini t e S er ie s</p>
<p>The graphical representation of functions, known then as the latitude
of forms, remained a popular topic from the time of Oresme to that of
Galileo. The Tractatus de latitudinibus formarum, written perhaps by a
student of Oresme’s, if not by Oresme himself, appeared in numerous
manuscript forms and was printed at least four times between 1482 and
1515, but this was only a pre´cis of a larger work by Oresme titled
Tractatus de figuratione potentiarum et mensurarum. Here, Oresme went so
far as to suggest a three-dimensional extension of his “latitude of
forms,” in which a function of two independent variables was pictured as
a volume made up of all of the ordinates erected according to a given
rule at points in a portion of the reference plane.</p>
