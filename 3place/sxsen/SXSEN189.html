<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>The theory of numbers has held strong attraction for many of the
greatest mathematicians, such as Fermat and Euler, but no appeal for
others—for example, Newton and d’Alembert. Euler did not publish a
treatise on the subject, but he wrote letters and articles on various
aspects of the theory of numbers. It will be recalled that Fermat had
asserted, among other things, (1) that numbers of the form 22n11
apparently are always prime; and (2) that if p is prime and a is an
integer not divisible by p, then ap 1 21 is divisible by p. Euler
exploded the first of these conjectures in 1732 through his uncanny
ability for computation, showing that 2251154;294;967;297 is factorable
into 6,700,4173641. Today the Fermat conjecture has been so thoroughly
deflated that mathematicians incline to the contrary opinion—that there
are no prime Fermat numbers beyond the number 65,537 corresponding to
n54.</p>
<p>Just as Euler, by means of a counterexample, had upset one of
Fermat’s conjectures, so a suggestion made by Euler was disproved in
1966. If n is greater than 2, Euler believed, at least n nth powers are
required to provide a sum that is itself an nth power. But it was shown
that the sum of only four fifth powers can be a fifth power, for 275
1845 11105 11335 51445. It should be noted, however, that in the latter
case, it required two centuries and the services of a high-speed
computing device to provide the counterexample.</p>
<p>For the second of Fermat’s conjectures, known as Fermat’s lesser
theorem, Euler was the first one to publish a proof (although Leibniz
had left an earlier demonstration in manuscript). Euler’s proof, which
appeared in the Petersburg Commentarii for 1736, is so surprisingly
elementary that we describe it here. The proof depends on an induction
on a. If a51, the theorem obviously holds. We now show that if the
theorem holds for any positive integral value of a, such as a5k, then it
necessarilyholdsfora5k11.Toshowthis,weusethebinomialtheorem to write
(k11)p as kp 1mp11, where m is an integer. On subtracting k11 from both
sides, we see that (k11)p 2(k11)5mp1(kp 2k).</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the last term on the right is divisible by p, by
hypothesis the right-hand side of the equation, hence also the left-hand
side, is obviously divisible by p. The theorem therefore holds, through
mathematical induction, for all values of a, provided that a is prime to
p.</p>
<p>Having proved Fermat’s lesser theorem, Euler demonstrated a somewhat
more general statement in which he used what has been called “Euler’s
φ-function.” If m is a positive integer greater than 1, the φ(m) is
defined as the number of integers less than m that are prime to m (but
including the integer 1 in each case). It is customary to define φ(1) as
1; for n52, 3, and 4, for example, the values of φ(n) are 1, 2, and 2,
respectively. If p is a prime, then clearly φ(p)5p21. It can be proved
that</p>
<p>φðmÞ5m12 1112 12 12 1;</p>
<p>p p pr</p>
<p>where p1, p2, pr are the distinct prime factors of(m) m. Using this
result,</p>
<p>Euler showed that aφ 21 is divisible by m if a is relatively prime to
m.</p>
<p>Euler settled two of Fermat’s conjectures but did not dispose of
“Fermat’s last theorem,” although he did prove the impossibility of
integer solutions of xn 1yn 5zn for the case n53.</p>
<p>In 1747, Euler added to the three pairs of amicable numbers known to
Fermat, bringing the list up to thirty pairs; later, he increased this
to more than sixty. Euler also gave a proof that all even perfect
numbers are of the form given by Euclid: 2n 1 (2n 21), where 2n 21 is
prime. Whether there can be an odd perfect number remains an open
question.</p>
<p>Also unresolved to this day is a question raised in correspondence by
Christian Goldbach (1690 1764). In writing to Euler in 1742, Goldbach
said that every even integer (.2) is the sum of two primes. This
socalled Goldbach’s theorem appeared in print (without proof) in 1770 in
England in the Meditationes Algebraicae of Edward Waring (1734
1793).</p>
<p>Among other unproved assertions is one known as Waring’s theorem, or
Waring’s problem. Euler had proved that every positive integer is the
sum of not more than four squares; Waring surmised that every positive
integer is the sum of not more than nine cubes or the sum of not more
than nineteen fourth powers. The first half of this bold guess was
proved in the early twentieth century; the second part is still
unproved. Waring also published in the Meditationes Algebraicae a
theorem named for his friend and pupil John Wilson (1741 1793)—if p is a
prime, then (p21)!11 is a multiple of p.</p>
