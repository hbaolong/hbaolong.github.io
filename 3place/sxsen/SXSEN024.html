<h4 id="tables">Tables</h4>
<p>A substantial proportion of the cuneiform tablets that have been
unearthed are “table texts,” including multiplication tables, tables of
reciprocals, and tables of squares and cubes and of square and cube
roots written, of course, in cuneiform sexagesimals. One of these, for
example, carries the equivalents of the entries shown in the following
table:</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>320</p>
<p>415</p>
<p>512</p>
<p>610</p>
<p>87;30</p>
<p>96;40</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>12 5</p>
<p>The product of elements in the same line is in all cases 60, the
Babylonian number base, and the table apparently was thought of as a
table of reciprocals. The sixth line, for example, denotes that the
reciprocal of 8 is 7/60130/(60)2. It will be noted that the reciprocals
of 7 and 11 are</p>
<p>Table s</p>
<p>missing from the table, because the reciprocals of such “irregular”
numbers are nonterminating sexagesimals, just as in our decimal system
the reciprocals of 3, 6, 7, and 9 are infinite when expanded decimally.
Again, the Babylonians were faced with the problem of infinity, but they
did not consider it systematically. At one point, however, a
Mesopotamian scribe seems to give upper and lower bounds for the
reciprocal of the irregular number 7, placing it between 0;8,34,16,59
and 0;8,34,18.</p>
<p>It is clear that the fundamental arithmetic operations were handled
by the Babylonians in a manner not unlike that which would be employed
today, and with comparable facility. Division was not carried out by the
clumsy duplication method of the Egyptians, but through an easy
multiplication of the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor, using
the appropriate items in the table texts. Just as today the quotient of
34 divided by 5 is easily found by multiplying 34 by 2 and shifting the
decimal point, so in antiquity the same division problem was carried out
by finding the product of 34 by 12 and shifting one sexagesimal place to
obtain 6. Tables of reciprocals in general furnished reciprocals only of
“regular” integers—that is, those that can be written as products of
twos, threes, and fives—although there are a few exceptions. One table
text includes the approximations 5;1,1,1 and 5;0,59,0,59. Here we
have</p>
<p>sexagesimal analogues of our decimal expressions 5:111 and</p>
<p>5:0909, unit fractions in which the denominator is one more or one
less than the base, but it appears again that the Babylonians did not
notice, or at least did not regard as significant, the infinite periodic
expansions in this connection.</p>
<p>One finds among the Old Babylonian tablets some table texts
containing successive powers of a given number, analogous to our modern
tables of logarithms or, more properly speaking, of antilogarithms.
Exponential (or logarithmic) tables have been found in which the first
ten powers are listed for the bases 9 and 16 and 1,40 and 3,45 (all
perfect squares). The question raised in a problem text asking to what
power a certain number must be raised in order to yield a given number
is equivalent to our question “What is the logarithm of the given number
in a system with a certain number as base?” The chief differences
between the ancient tables and our own, apart from matters of language
and notation, are that no single number was systematically used as a
base in various connections and that the gaps between entries in the
ancient tables are far larger than in our tables. Then, too, their
“logarithm tables” were not used for general purposes of calculation,
but rather to solve certain very specific questions.</p>
<p>Despite the large gaps in their exponential tables, Babylonian
mathematicians did not hesitate to interpolate by proportional parts to
approximate intermediate values. Linear interpolation seems to have been
a commonplace procedure in ancient Mesopotamia, and the positional
notation lent itself conveniently to the rule of three. A clear instance
of the practical use of interpolation within exponential tables is seen
in a problem text that asks how long it will take money to double at 20
percent annually; the answer given is 3;47,13,20. It seems to be quite
clear that the scribe used linear interpolation between the values for
(1;12)3 and (1;12)4, following the compound interest formula a5 P(11r)n,
where r is 20 percent, or , and reading values from an exponential table
with powers of 1;12.</p>
