<h4 id="chapter-20-geometry">Chapter 20 Geometry</h4>
<p>There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not
some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.</p>
<p>—Lobachevsky</p>
<p>The School of Monge</p>
<p>Geometry, of all of the branches of mathematics, has been most
subject to changing tastes from age to age. In classical Greece, it had
climbed to the zenith, only to fall to its nadir at about the time that
Rome fell. It recovered some lost ground under Islam and in Renaissance
Europe; in the seventeenth century, it stood on the threshold of a new
era, only to be all but forgotten, at least by research mathematicians,
for nearly two more centuries, languishing in the shade of the
ever-proliferating branches of analysis. Britain, especially during the
later eighteenth century, fought a losing battle to restore Euclid’s
Elements to its once glorious position, but the British had done little
to advance research in the subject. Through the efforts of Monge and
Carnot, there were some stirrings of revival in pure geometry during the
period of the French Revolution, but the almost explosive rediscovery of
geometry as a living branch of mathematics came chiefly with the dawn of
the nineteenth century. As one might have anticipated, Monge’s students
at the École Polytechnique made significant contributions to the new
geometric movement. Reflecting the multiple nature of their teacher’s
research, some pursued geometric applications to engineering, some to
pedagogy, some to physics; many studied the subject for its own sake.
Thus, Charles Dupin (1784–1873) applied his geometric knowledge
primarily to problems of naval architecture and established technical
training courses at the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers. Still, he is
best remembered among geometers for contributions to the theory of
surfaces, where he introduced concepts such as that of the cyclide, the
surface enveloped by all spheres tangent to a given set of spheres.
Theodore Olivier (1793–1853) went beyond Monge in creating geometric
models to develop powers of visualization of geometric concepts; this
work began the building of geometric model collections, heavily promoted
by the end of the century through the pedagogic influence of Felix Klein
(1849–1925). Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774–1862), though primarily remembered
as a physicist, in his lectures passed on Monge’s emphasis on geometric
visualization of physical and mathematical problems. Charles Jules
Brianchon (1785–1864) is best known today for one theorem, which he
discovered only a year after his entrance at the École Polytechnique,
where he studied under Monge and read Carnot’s Géométrie de position.
The twenty-one-year-old student, later an artillery officer and a
teacher, first reestablished the long-forgotten theorem of Pascal, which
Brianchon expressed in the modern form: In any hexagon inscribed in a
conic section, the three points of intersection of the opposite sides
always lie on a straight line. Continuing through some other
demonstrations, he came to the one that bears his name: “In any hexagon
circumscribed about a conic section, the three diagonals cross each
other in the same point.” As Pascal had been impressed by the number of
corollaries that he had been able to derive from his theorem, so
Brianchon remarked that his own theorem “is pregnant with curious
consequences.” The theorems of Pascal and Brianchon are, in fact,
fundamental in the projective study of conics. They form, in addition,
the first clear-cut instance of a pair of significant “dual” theorems in
geometry, that is, theorems that remain valid (in plane geometry) if the
words “point” and “line” are interchanged. If we let the phrase “a line
is tangent to a conic” be read as “a line is on a conic,” the two
theorems can be expressed in the following combined form:</p>
<p>Projective Geometry: Poncelet and Chasles</p>
<p>Relationships between points and lines on conics were also
efficaciously exploited by another alumnus of the École Polytechnique,
the man who became the effective founder of projective geometry. This
was Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867), who also studied under Monge.
Poncelet entered the army corps of engineers just in time to take part
in Napoleon’s ill-fated 1812 campaign in Russia and be taken prisoner.
While in prison, Poncelet composed a treatise on analytic geometry,
Applications d’analyse et de géométrie, which was based on the
principles he had learned at the École Polytechnique. This work,
however, was not published until about half a century later (2 vols.,
1862–1864), despite the fact that it was originally intended to serve as
an introduction to the author’s far more celebrated Traité des
propriétés projectives des figures of 1822. The latter work differed
sharply from the former, in that it was synthetic, rather than analytic,
in style. Poncelet’s tastes had changed on his return to Paris, and from
that time on, he was a staunch advocate of synthetic methods. He
realized that the apparent advantage of analytic geometry lay in its
generality, and he therefore sought to make statements in synthetic
geometry as general as possible. To further this design, he formulated
what he called the “principle of continuity” or “the principle of
permanence of mathematical relations.” This he described as follows:</p>
<p>The metric properties discovered for a primitive figure remain
applicable, without other modifications than those of change of sign, to
all correlative figures which can be considered to spring from the
first.</p>
<p>As an example of the principle, Poncelet cited the theorem of the
equality of the products of the segments of intersecting chords in a
circle, which becomes, when the point of intersection lies outside the
circle, an equality of the products of the segments of secants. If one
of the lines is tangent to the circle, the theorem nevertheless remains
valid on replacing the product of the segments of the secant with the
square of the tangent. Cauchy was inclined to scoff at Poncelet’s
principle of continuity, for it appeared to him to be nothing more than
a bold induction. In a sense, this principle is not unlike the view of
Carnot, but Poncelet carried it further to include the points at
infinity that Kepler and Desargues had suggested. Thus, one could say of
two straight lines that they always intersected—either in an ordinary
point or (in the case of parallel lines) in a point at infinity, called
an ideal point. In order to achieve the generality of analysis, Poncelet
found it necessary to introduce into synthetic geometry not only ideal
points but also imaginary points, for only thus could he say that a
circle and a straight line always intersect. Among his striking
discoveries was that all circles whatsoever, drawn in a plane, have two
points in common. These are two ideal imaginary points, known as the
circular points at infinity and usually designated as I and J (or, more
informally, as Isaac and Jacob).</p>
<p>Poncelet argued that his principle of continuity, which presumably
had been suggested by analytic geometry, was properly a development of
synthetic geometry, and he quickly became a champion of the latter
against the analysts. During the second half of the eighteenth century,
there had been some controversy, especially in Germany, about the
relative merits of analysis and synthesis. During the early nineteenth
century, interest in the rival methodologies in France was such that a
prize was offered in 1813 by the Bordeaux Scientific Society for the
best essay characterizing synthesis and analysis and the influence that
each had exerted. The winning essay, by a teacher at Versailles, closed
with the hope that there might be a reconciliation between the two
camps, but half a dozen years later, the controversy broke out again and
became increasingly bitter.</p>
<p>The history of geometry in the nineteenth century is replete with
cases of independent discovery and rediscovery. One example is that of
the nine-point circle. Poncelet and Brianchon published a joint paper in
Gergonne’s Annales for 1820–1821, which, though titled “Recherches sur
la détermination d’une hyperbole équilatère,” contained a proof of the
beautiful theorem that</p>
<p>The circle which passes through the feet of the perpendiculars,
dropped from the vertices of any triangle on the sides opposite to them,
passes also through the midpoints of these sides as well as through the
midpoints of the segments which join the vertices to the point of
intersection of the perpendiculars.</p>
<p>This theorem is generally named for neither Brianchon nor Poncelet,
but for an independent German mathematician, Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach
(1800–1834), who published it in 1822. The little monograph containing
this and some related propositions also included proofs of several
fascinating properties of the circle. Among these is the fact that the
center of the nine-point circle lies on the Euler line and is midway
between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and “Feuerbach’s theorem”
that the nine-point circle of any triangle is tangent internally to the
inscribed circle and tangent externally to the three escribed circles.
One enthusiast, the American geometer Julian Lowell Coolidge
(1873–1954), called this “the most beautiful theorem in elementary
geometry that has been discovered since the time of Euclid.” It should
be noted that the charm of such theorems supported considerable
investigation in the geometry of triangles and circles during the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Returning to Poncelet, let us note that we remember him primarily for
his using existing Desarguesian concepts of central (point) projections
and points of infinity to establish the notion of the complex projective
plane. Basic is the study of projective properties defined as those
remaining invariant under perspectivities. Given a point O and a line l
in the plane, a perspectivity assigns to each point P a point P′ on l
such that if Q is a second point, there exists a point Q′ on OQ such
that PQ intersects P′Q′ on l. A sequence of perspectivities is called a
projectivity. Again, calling on an approach used by Desargues, Poncelet
brought to the fore the Apollonian concepts of pole and polar to which,
as we have noted, he attributed his discovery of the principle of
duality.</p>
<p>The work of Poncelet was continued by Michel Chasles (1798–1880),
also a graduate of the École Polytechnique, where he became professor of
machine technology in 1841; beginning in 1846, he held a chair for
higher geometry at the Sorbonne. To Chasles was due the emphasis in
projective geometry on the six cross ratios, or anharmonic ratios, (c −
a)/(c − b): (d − a)/(d − b) of four collinear points or four concurrent
lines, and the invariance of these under projective transformations. His
Traité de géométrie supérieure (1852) was influential as well in
establishing the use of directed line segments in pure geometry.
Chasles, who is also noted for his Aperçu historique sur l’origine et la
dévéloppement des méthodes en géométrie (1837), was one of the last
great projective geometers in France. Late in life, he initiated the
study of enumerative geometry, that branch of algebraic geometry whose
task it is to determine the number of solutions of algebraic problems by
means of geometric interpretation. Here and elsewhere, he made prominent
use of the “principle of correspondence.”</p>
<p>Synthetic Metric Geometry: Steiner</p>
<p>In many respects, Chasles’s results overlapped with those of several
German geometers. Foremost among them was Jakob Steiner, the man who has
been regarded as the greatest synthetic geometer of modern times. In his
hands, synthetic geometry made strides comparable to those made earlier
in analysis. He intensely disliked analytic methods. The term “analysis”
implies a certain amount of technique or machinery; analysis is often
referred to as a tool, a term never applied to synthesis. Steiner
objected to all kinds of tools or “props” in geometry. In a paper in
Crelle’s Journal, he demonstrated by synthetic methods alone a striking
theorem that naturally appears to belong to analysis: that a surface of
the third order contains only twenty-seven lines. Steiner also proved
that all Euclidean constructions can be performed with a straightedge
alone, provided that one is also given a single fixed circle. This
theorem shows that one cannot, in Euclidean geometry, dispense entirely
with the compasses, but that having used them to draw one circle, one
can thereafter discard them in favor of the straightedge alone.</p>
<p>Steiner’s name is recalled in many connections, including the
properties of the Steiner points: If one joins in all possible ways the
six points on a conic in Pascal’s mystic hexagon, one obtains sixty
Pascal lines that intersect three by three in twenty Steiner points.
Among Steiner’s unpublished discoveries are those relating to the
fruitful geometric transformation known as inversive geometry: If two
points P and P′ lie on a ray from the center O of a circle C of radius r
≠ 0, and if the product of the distances OP and OP′ is r2, then P and P′
are said to be inverse to each other with respect to C. To every point P
outside the circle, there is a corresponding point inside the circle.
Inasmuch as there is no outside point P′ corresponding to P when P
coincides with the center O, one has in a sense a paradox similar to
that of Bolzano: The inside of every circle, no matter how small,
contains, as it were, one more point than the portion of the plane
outside the circle. In an exactly analogous manner, one readily defines
the inverse of a point in three-dimensional space with respect to a
sphere.</p>
<p>A host of theorems in plane or solid inversive geometry are readily
proved by either analytic or synthetic methods. In particular, it is
easy to show that a circle not passing through the center of inversion
is transformed under a plane inversion, into a circle, whereas a circle
through the center of inversion goes into a straight line not passing
through the center of inversion (with analogous results holding for
spheres and planes in three-dimensional inversive geometry). Somewhat
more difficult to establish is the more significant result that
inversion is a conformal transformation, that is, that angles between
curves are preserved in this geometry. That angle-preserving
transformations are far from usual is clear from a theorem proved by
Joseph Liouville that in space, the only ones that are conformal are
inversions and similarity and congruency transformations. Steiner did
not publish his ideas on inversion, and the transformation was
rediscovered several times by other mathematicians of the century,
including Lord Kelvin (or William Thomson, 1824–1907), who, in 1845,
arrived at it through physics and who applied it to problems in
electrostatics.</p>
<p>If the center O of the circle of inversion of radius a is at the
origin of a plane Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates x′ and y′
of the inverse P′ of a point P(x, y) are given by the equations</p>
<p>These equations later suggested to Luigi Cremona (1830–1903), a
professor of geometry successively at Bologna, Milan, and Rome, the
study of the much more general transformation x′ = R1(x, y), y′ = R2(x,
y), where R1 and R2 are rational algebraic functions. Such
transformations, of which those for inversion are only a special case,
are now known as Cremona transformations, in honor of the man who, in
1863, published an account of them and who later generalized them for
three dimensions.</p>
<p>Synthetic Nonmetric Geometry: von Staudt</p>
<p>Steiner, in his Systematische Entwicklungen of 1832, had produced a
treatment of projective geometry based on metric considerations. Some
years later, pure geometry found another German devotee in K. G. C. von
Staudt (1798–1867), a one-time student of Gauss’s, whose Geometrie der
Lage of 1847 built up projective geometry without reference to magnitude
or number. Von Staudt, after defining the cross ratio of four points x1,
x2, x3, and x4 as x1 − x3/x1 − x4: x2 − x3/x2 − x4, made a harmonic set
of points (a set whose cross ratio is –1) fundamental to building up
projective geometry; two pencils of points are said to be projective if
harmonic sets are preserved. Von Staudt’s geometry was exceedingly
significant in showing how a projective geometry could be established
without the concept of distance, thus paving the way for the idea of
having a nonmetric geometry on which a notion of distance could be
defined. A few years later, Edmond Laguerre (1834–1886) in France
discussed the possibility of imposing a measure on a nonmetric angle
geometry. It was Arthur Cayley, however, who subsequently presented the
most influential elaboration on the whole concept of defining a metric
on a projective geometry in his “Sixth Memoir on Quantics.”</p>
<p>Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>As Monge had been perhaps the first modern specialist in geometry in
general, so Julius Plücker (1801–1868) became the first specialist in
analytic geometry in particular. His earliest publications in Gergonne’s
Annales in 1826 had been largely synthetic, but he inadvertently became
so embroiled in controversy with Poncelet that he forsook the camp of
the synthesists and became the most prolific of all analytic geometers.
Algebraic methods, he came to believe firmly, were much to be preferred
to the purely geometric approach of Poncelet and Steiner. That his name
survives in coordinate geometry in what is called Plücker’s abridged
notation is a tribute to his influence, although, in this case, the
phrase does him more than justice. During the early nineteenth century,
a number of men, including Gergonne, had recognized that analytic
geometry was burdened by awkwardness in algebraic computation; hence,
they began to drastically abbreviate notations. The family of all
circles through the intersection of the two circles x2 + y2 + ax + by +
c = 0 and x2 + y2 + a′x + b′y + c′ = 0, for instance, was written by
Gabriel Lamé (1795–1870) in 1818 simply as mC + m′C′ = 0, using two
parameters or multipliers m and m′. Gergonne and Plücker preferred a
single Greek multiplier, the former writing C + λC′ = 0, from which we
have the word “lambdalizing,” and the latter using C + μC′ = 0,
resulting in the phrase “Plücker’s μ.” Lamé seems to have been the
initiator in the study in analytic geometry of one-parameter families
through abridged notation, but it was Plücker who, especially during the
years 1827–1829, carried this study furthest.</p>
<p>Among the many uses Plücker made of abridged notation was one of
1828, in Gergonne’s Annales, in which he explained the Cramer-Euler
paradox. If, for example, one has fourteen random points in a plane, the
quartic curve through these points can be written as Q + μQ′ = 0, where
Q = 0 and Q′ = 0 are distinct quartics through the same thirteen of the
fourteen given points. Let μ be so determined that the coordinates of
the fourteenth point satisfy Q + μQ′ = 0. Then, Q = 0, Q′ = 0, and Q +
uQ′ = 0 all have in common not only the original thirteen points, but
also all sixteen points of intersection of Q = 0 and Q′ = 0. Hence, with
any set of thirteen points there are three additional points dependent
on, or associated with, the original thirteen, and no set of fourteen or
more points selected from the combined set of sixteen dependent points
will determine a unique quartic curve, despite the fact that a random
set of fourteen points will in general uniquely determine a quartic
curve. More generally, any given set of</p>
<p>random points will determine a concomitant set of</p>
<p>additional “dependent” points such that any curve of degree n through
the given set of points will also pass through the dependent points. In
addition, Plücker gave a dual of his theorem on the paradox, as well as
generalizations to surfaces in three dimensions.</p>
<p>It was Plücker who, in the first volume of his
Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen (1828), elevated the abridged
notation of Lamé and Gergonne to the status of a principle; in the
second volume of this influential work (1831), Plücker effectively
rediscovered a new system of coordinates that had been independently
invented three times earlier. This was what we now call homogeneous
coordinates, of which Feuerbach was one inventor. Another discoverer was
A. F. Möbius (1790–1860), also a student of Gauss’s, who published his
scheme in 1827 in a work with the title Der barycentrische Calcul. He
introduced his “barycentric coordinates” by considering a given triangle
ABC and defining the coordinates of a point P as the mass to be placed
at A, B, and C so that P is the center of gravity of these masses.
Möbius classified transformations according to whether they were
congruences (leaving corresponding figures equal), similarities
(corresponding figures similar), affine (corresponding figures
preserving parallel lines), or collineations (lines going into lines)
and suggested the study of invariants under each family of
transformations. The author of Der barycentrische Calcul is best known,
however, for the one-sided surface that bears his name—the Möbius strip
or band obtained by joining the ends of a segment of ribbon after one
end has been turned upside down. Still another inventor of homogeneous
coordinates was Étienne Bobillier (1798–1840), a graduate of the École
Polytechnique who published his new coordinate system in Gergonne’s
Annales for 1827–1828.</p>
<p>The notations and patterns of reasoning of the four inventors of
homogeneous coordinates differed somewhat, but they all had one thing in
common—they made use of three coordinates, instead of two, to locate a
point in a plane. The systems were equivalent to what are also known as
trilinear coordinates. Plücker, in fact, at first specifically took his
three coordinates x, y, and t of a point P in a plane to be the three
distances of P from the sides of a triangle of reference. Later, in
Volume II of his Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen, he gave the more
usual definition of homogeneous coordinates as any set of ordered number
triples (x, y, t) related to the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y) of P such
that x = Xt and y = Yt. It will immediately be apparent that the
homogeneous coordinates of a point P are not unique, for the triples (x,
y, t) and (kx, ky, kt) correspond to the same Cartesian pair (x/t, y/t).
This lack of uniqueness, however, causes no more difficulty than does
the lack of uniqueness in polar coordinates or the lack of uniqueness of
form in the case of equal fractions. The name “homogeneous” stems, of
course, from the fact that when one uses the equations of transformation
to convert the equation of a curve f(X, Y) = 0 in rectangular Cartesian
coordinates to the form f(x/t, y/t) = 0, the new equation will contain
terms all of the same degree in the variables x, y, and t. More
important, it will be noted that there is in the system of Cartesian
coordinates no number pair corresponding to a homogeneous plane number
triple of the form (x, y, 0). Such a triple (provided that x and y are
not both zero) designates an ideal point, or a “point at infinity.” At
long last, the infinite elements of Kepler, Desargues, and Poncelet had
been tied down to a coordinate system of ordinary numbers. Moreover,
just as any ordered triple of real numbers (not all zero) in homogeneous
coordinates corresponds to a point in a plane, so also does every linear
equation ax + by + ct = 0 (provided that a, b, and c are not all zero)
correspond to a straight line in the plane. In particular, all of the
“points at infinity” in the plane obviously lie on the line given by the
equation t = 0, known as the line at infinity or the ideal line in the
plane. It is obvious that this new system of coordinates is ideally
suited to the study of projective geometry, which up to this time had
been approached almost exclusively from the point of view of pure
geometry.</p>
<p>Homogeneous coordinates were a big step in the direction of the
arithmetization of geometry, but in 1829, Plücker contributed to
Crelle’s Journal a paper with a revolutionary point of view that broke
completely with the old Cartesian view of coordinates as line segments.
The equation of a straight line in homogeneous coordinates has the form
ax + by + ct = 0. The three coefficients of parameters (a, b, c)
determine a unique straight line in the plane, just as the three
homogeneous coordinates (x, y, t) correspond to a unique point in the
plane. Inasmuch as coordinates are numbers, hence not unlike
coefficients, Plücker saw that one could modify the usual language and
call (a, b, c) the homogeneous coordinates of a line. If, finally, one
reverses the Cartesian convention so that letters at the beginning of
the alphabet designate variables and those near the end of the alphabet
designate constants, the equation ax + by + ct = 0 represents a pencil
of lines through the fixed point (x, y, t), rather than a pencil of
points on the fixed line (a, b, c). If, now, one considers the
noncommittal equation pu + qv + rw = 0, it is clear that one can
consider this indifferently as the totality of points (u, v, w) lying on
the fixed line (p, q, r) or as the totality of lines (p, q, r) through
the fixed point (u, v, w).</p>
<p>Plücker had discovered the immediate analytic counterpart of the
geometric principle of duality, about which Gergonne and Poncelet had
quarreled; it now became clear that the justification that pure geometry
had sought in vain was here supplied by the algebraic point of view. The
interchange of the words “point” and “line” merely corresponds to an
interchange of the words “constant” and “variable” with respect to the
quantities p, q, r and u, v, w. From the symmetry of the algebraic
situation, it is clear that every theorem concerning pu + qv + rw = 0
immediately appears in two forms, one the dual of the other. Moreover,
Plücker showed that every curve (other than a straight line) can be
regarded as having a dual origin: It is a locus generated by a moving
point and enveloped by a moving line, the point moving continuously
along the line while the line continues to rotate about the point. Oddly
enough, the degree of a curve in point coordinates (the “order” of the
curve) need not be the same as the degree of the curve in line
coordinates (the “class” of the curve), and one of Plücker’s great
achievements, published in Crelle’s Journal for 1834, was the discovery
of four equations, which now bear his name, that relate the class and
the order of a curve with the singularities of the curve:</p>
<p>where m is the class, n the order, δ the number of nodes, κ the
number of cusps, ι the number of stationary tangents (points of
inflection), and τ the number of bitangents. From these equations, it is
clear at a glance that a conic (of order two) can have no singularities
and thus must also be of class two.</p>
<p>In later papers and volumes, Plücker extended his work to include
imaginary Cartesian and homogeneous coordinates. It was now a trivial
matter to justify Poncelet’s theorem that all circles have in common two
imaginary points at infinity, for the points (1, i, 0) and (i, 1, 0)
both satisfy the equation x2 + y2 + axt + byt + ct2 = 0, no matter what
values a, b, c may take on. Plücker also showed that the foci of conics
have the property that the imaginary tangents from these points to the
curve pass through the above two circular points; he therefore defined a
focus of a higher plane curve as a point having this property.</p>
<p>During the days of Descartes and Fermat and again in the time of
Monge and Lagrange, France had been the center for the development of
analytic geometry, but with the work of Plücker, leadership in the field
crossed the Rhine to Germany. Nevertheless, Plücker was, to a
considerable extent, the proverbial prophet without honor in his own
country. There, Steiner, the champion of synthetic methods, was
inordinately admired. Möbius remained neutral in the analysis-synthesis
controversy, but Jacobi, despite the fact that he himself was an
algorithm-builder, joined Steiner in polemically opposing Plücker.
Discouraged, in 1847, Plücker turned from geometry to physics, where he
published a series of papers on magnetism and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>One notes with surprise that Plücker had not taken advantage of
developments in determinants, possibly because of his feud with Jacobi;
this may have been why he did not systematically develop an analytic
geometry of more than three dimensions. Plücker had come close to this
notion through his observation in 1846 that the four parameters
determining a line in three-dimensional space can be thought of as four
coordinates, but only long afterward, in 1865, did he return to analytic
geometry and develop the idea of a “new geometry of space”—a
four-dimensional space in which straight lines, rather than points, were
the basic elements. Meanwhile, in 1843, Cayley had initiated the
ordinary analytic geometry of n-dimensional space, using determinants as
an essential tool. In this notation, using homogeneous coordinates, the
equations of the line and the plane, respectively, can be written as</p>
<p>Cayley pointed out that the corresponding fundamental (n −
l)-dimensional element in n-dimensional space can be expressed in
homogeneous coordinates by a determinant, similar to those above, of
order n + 1. Many of the simple formulas for two and three dimensions,
when properly expressed, can easily be generalized to n dimensions. In
1846, Cayley published a paper in Crelle’s Journal, in which he again
extended some theorems from three dimensions to a space of four
dimensions; in 1847, Cauchy published an article in the Comptes Rendus,
in which he considered “analytical points” and “analytical lines” in
space of more than three dimensions.</p>
<p>Non-Euclidean Geometry</p>
<p>In non-Euclidean geometry, we find a startling case of simultaneity
of discovery, for similar notions occurred, during the first third of
the nineteenth century, to three men, one German, one Hungarian, and one
Russian. We have already noted that during the second decade of the
century, Gauss had come to the conclusion that the efforts to prove the
parallel postulate made by Saccheri, Lambert, Legendre, and his
Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai were in vain and that geometries other
than Euclid’s were possible. Yet he had not shared this view with
others; he had simply elaborated the idea, as he said, “for himself.”
Hence, efforts to prove the parallel postulate continued, and among
those attempting such a proof was young Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky
(1793–1856). Lobachevsky is regarded as the “Copernicus of geometry,”
the man who revolutionized the subject through the creation of a whole
new branch, Lobachevskian geometry, thereby showing that Euclidean
geometry was not the exact science or the absolute truth it previously
had been taken to be. Through the work of Lobachevsky, it became
necessary to revise fundamental views of the nature of mathematics, but
Lobachevsky’s colleagues were too close to the situation to see it in
proper perspective, and the trailblazer had to pursue his thoughts in
lonely isolation.</p>
<p>Lobachevsky’s revolutionary view seems not to have come to him as a
sudden inspiration. In an outline of geometry that he drew up in 1823,
presumably for classroom use, Lobachevsky said of the parallel postulate
simply that “no rigorous proof of the truth of this had ever been
discovered.” Apparently, he did not then exclude the possibility that
such a proof might yet be discovered. Three years later at Kazan
University, he read in French a paper (now lost) on the principles of
geometry, including “une démonstration rigoreuse du théorème des
parallèles.” The year 1826 in which this paper was delivered may be
taken as the unofficial birth date of Lobachevskian geometry, for it was
then that the author presented many of the characteristic theorems of
the new subject. Another three years later, in the Kazan Messenger for
1829, Lobachevsky published an article, “On the Principles of Geometry,”
which marks the official birth of non-Euclidean geometry. Between 1826
and 1829, he had become thoroughly convinced that Euclid’s fifth
postulate cannot be proved on the basis of the other four, and in the
paper of 1829, he became the first mathematician to take the
revolutionary step of publishing a geometry specifically built on an
assumption in direct conflict with the parallel postulate: Through a
point C lying outside a line AB there can be drawn more than one line in
the plane and not meeting AB. With this new postulate, Lobachevsky
deduced a harmonious geometric structure having no inherent logical
contradictions. This was in every sense a valid geometry, but so
contrary to common sense did it appear, even to Lobachevsky, that he
called it “imaginary geometry.”</p>
<p>Lobachevsky was well aware of the significance of his discovery of
“imaginary geometry,” as is clear from the fact that during the score of
years from 1835 to 1855, he wrote out three full accounts of the new
geometry. In 1835–1838, his New Foundations of Geometry appeared in
Russian; in 1840, he published Geometrical Investigations on the Theory
of Parallels in German; and in 1855, his last book, Pangeometry, was
published simultaneously in French and Russian. (All have since been
translated into other languages, including English.) From the second of
the three works, Gauss learned of Lobachevsky’s contributions to
non-Euclidean geometry, and it was on his recommendation that in 1842,
Lobachevsky was elected to the Göttingen Scientific Society. In letters
to friends, Gauss praised Lobachevsky’s work, but he never gave it
support in print, for he feared the jibes of “the Boeotians.” Partly for
this reason, the new geometry became known only very slowly.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai had spent much of his life
trying to prove the parallel postulate, and when he found that his own
son Janos Bolyai (1802–1860) was absorbed in the problem of parallels,
the father, a provincial mathematics teacher, wrote to the son, a
dashing army officer:</p>
<p>For God’s sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than
sensual passions because it, too, may take all your time, and deprive
you of your health, peace of mind, and happiness in life.</p>
<p>The son, not dissuaded, continued his efforts until, in about 1829,
he came to the conclusion reached only a few years earlier by
Lobachevsky. Instead of attempting to prove the impossible, he developed
what he called the “Absolute Science of Space,” starting from the
assumption that through a point not on a line, infinitely many lines can
be drawn in the plane, each parallel to the given line. Janos sent his
reflections to his father, who published them in the form of an appendix
to a treatise that he had completed, bearing a long Latin title
beginning with Tentamen. The elder Bolyai’s Tentamen bears an imprimatur
dated 1829, the year of Lobachevsky’s Kazan Messenger article, but it
did not actually appear until 1832.</p>
<p>Gauss’s reaction to the “Absolute Science of Space” was similar to
that in the case of Lobachevsky—sincere approval, but lack of support in
print. When Farkas Bolyai wrote to ask for an opinion on the unorthodox
work of his son, Gauss replied that he could not praise Janos’s work,
for this would mean self-praise, inasmuch as he had held these views for
many years. The temperamental Janos was understandably disturbed,
fearing that he would be deprived of priority. Continued lack of
recognition, as well as the publication of Lobachevsky’s work in German
in 1840, so upset him that he published nothing more. The lion’s share
of the credit for the development of non-Euclidean geometry consequently
belongs to Lobachevsky.</p>
<p>Riemannian Geometry</p>
<p>Non-Euclidean geometry continued for several decades to be a fringe
aspect of mathematics until it was thoroughly integrated through the
remarkably general views of G. F. B. Riemann (1826–1866). The son of a
village pastor, Riemann was brought up in very modest circumstances,
always remaining frail in body and shy in manner. He nevertheless
secured a good education, first at Berlin and later at Göttingen, where
he took his doctorate with a thesis in theory of functions of a complex
variable. It is here that we find the so-called Cauchy-Riemann
equations, ux = vy, uy = − vx, which an analytic function w = f(z) = u +
iv of a complex variable z = x + iy must satisfy, although this
requirement had been known even in the days of Euler and d’Alembert. The
thesis also led to the concept of a Riemann surface, anticipating the
part that topology ultimately was to play in analysis.</p>
<p>In 1854, Riemann became a privatdozent at the University of
Göttingen, and according to custom, he was called on to deliver a
Habilitationsschrift before the faculty. The result, in Riemann’s case,
was the most celebrated probationary lecture in the history of
mathematics, for it presented a deep and broad view of the whole field
of geometry. The thesis bore the title “Über die Hypothesen welche der
Geometrie zu Grunde liegen” (“On the Hypotheses which Lie at the
Foundation of Geometry”), but it did not present a specific example. It
instead urged a global view of geometry as a study of manifolds of any
number of dimensions in any kind of space. His geometries are
non-Euclidean in a far more general sense than is Lobachevskian
geometry, where the question is simply how many parallels are possible
through a point. Riemann saw that geometry should not even necessarily
deal with points or lines or space in the ordinary sense, but with sets
of ordered n-tuples that are combined according to certain rules.</p>
<p>Among the most important rules in any geometry, Riemann saw, is that
for finding the distance between two points that are infinitesimally
close together. In ordinary Euclidean geometry, this “metric” is given
by ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2, but infinitely many other formulas can be used
as a distance formula, and, of course, the metric used will determine
the properties of the space or the geometry. A space whose metric is of
the form</p>
<p>where the g’s are constants or, more generally, functions of x, y,
and z, is known as a Riemannian space. Thus, (locally) Euclidean space
is only the very special case of a Riemannian space in which g11 = g22 =
g33 = 1 and all the other g’s are zero. Riemann even developed from the
metric a formula for the Gaussian curvature of a “surface” in his
“space.” It is no wonder that after Riemann’s lecture and for almost the
only time in his long career, Gauss expressed enthusiasm for the work of
someone else.</p>
<p>There is a more restricted sense in which we today use the phrase
“Riemannian geometry”: the plane geometry that is deduced from
Saccheri’s hypothesis of the obtuse angle if the infinitude of the
straight line is also abandoned. A model for this geometry is found in
the interpretation of the “plane” as the surface of a sphere and of a
“straight line” as a great circle on the sphere. In this case, the angle
sum of a triangle is greater than two right angles, whereas in the
geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai (corresponding to the hypothesis of
the acute angle), the angle sum is less than two right angles. This use
of Riemann’s name, however, fails to do justice to the fundamental
change in geometric thought that his 1854 Habilitationsschrift (not
published until 1867) brought about. It was Riemann’s suggestion of the
general study of curved metric spaces, rather than of the special case
equivalent to geometry on the sphere, that ultimately made the theory of
general relativity possible. Riemann himself contributed heavily to
theoretical physics in a number of directions, and it was therefore
fitting that in 1859 he should have been appointed as successor to
Dirichlet in the chair at Göttingen that Gauss had filled.</p>
<p>In showing that non-Euclidean geometry with angle sum greater than
two right angles is realized on the surface of a sphere, Riemann
essentially verified the consistency of the axioms from which the
geometry is derived. In much the same sense, Eugenio Beltrami
(1835–1900), a colleague of Cremona’s at Bologna and later a professor
at Pisa, Pavia, and Rome, showed that there was at hand a corresponding
model for Lobachevskian geometry. This is the surface generated through
the revolution of a tractrix about its asymptote, a surface known as a
pseudosphere, inasmuch as it has constant negative curvature, as the
sphere has constant positive curvature. If we define the “straight line”
through two points on the pseudosphere as the geodesic through the
points, the resulting geometry will have the properties resulting from
the Lobachevskian postulates. Inasmuch as the plane is a surface with
constant zero curvature, Euclidean geometry can be regarded as an
intermediary between the two types of non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Spaces of Higher Dimensions</p>
<p>The unification of geometry that Riemann had achieved was especially
relevant in the microscopic aspect of differential geometry, or geometry
“in the small.” Analytic geometry, or geometry “in the large,” had not
been much changed. In fact, Riemann’s lecture was given at about the
midpoint of Plücker’s self-imposed geometric retirement, during which
there had been something of a lull in analytic geometric activity in
Germany. In 1865, Plücker again resumed mathematical publication, this
time in British publications instead of in Crelle’s Journal, probably
because Cayley had shown interest in Plücker’s work. In this year, he
published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions (often known simply
as Phil. Trans.), expanded three years later into a book on a “new
geometry” of space. Here, he explicitly formulated a principle at which
he had hinted about twenty years earlier. A space, he argued, need not
be thought of as a totality of points; it can equally well be visualized
as composed of lines. In fact, any figure that formerly had been thought
of as a locus or a totality of points can itself be taken as a space
element, and the dimensionality of the space will correspond to the
number of parameters determining this element. If our ordinary
three-space is considered a “cosmic haystack of infinitely thin,
infinitely long straight straws,” rather than an “agglomeration of
infinitely fine birdshot,” it is four-dimensional, rather than
three-dimensional. In 1868, the year of Plücker’s book based on this
theme, Cayley analytically developed in the Phil. Trans. the notion of
the ordinary two-dimensional Cartesian plane as a space of five
dimensions, the elements of which are conics. In Plücker’s Neue
Geometrie des Raumes, there are also other new ideas. The geometric
representation of a single equation f(x, y, z) = 0 in point coordinates
is called a surface, two simultaneous equations correspond to a curve,
and three equations determine one or more points. In the “new geometry”
of his four-dimensional line space, Plücker called the “figure”
represented by a single equation f(r, s, t, u) = 0 in the four
coordinates of his line space a “complex,” two equations designated a
“congruence,” and three a “range.” He found that the quadratic line
complex has properties similar to those of the quadric surface, but he
did not live to complete the extensive study he planned. He died in
1868, the year in which the first volume of his New Geometry appeared,
followed a year later by the second, edited by one of his students,
Felix Klein (1849–1925).</p>
<p>Felix Klein</p>
<p>Klein had been Plücker’s assistant at the University of Bonn during
the latter’s return to geometry, and, in a sense, he was Plücker’s
successor in his enthusiasm for analytic geometry. Yet the young man’s
work in the field took a different direction—one that served to bring
some element of unity into the diversity of new results of research. The
new view may have been in part the result of visits to Paris, where
Lagrange’s hints of group theory had been developed, especially through
substitution groups, into a full-blown branch of algebra. Klein was
deeply impressed by the unifying possibilities in the group concept, and
he spent much of the rest of his life in developing, applying, and
popularizing the notion.</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a group with respect to a given
operation if (1) the set of elements is closed under the operation, (2)
the set contains an identity element with respect to the operation, (3)
for every element in the set there is an inverse element with respect to
the operation, and (4) the operation is associative. The elements can be
numbers (as in arithmetic), points (in geometry), transformations (in
algebra or geometry), or anything at all. The operation can be
arithmetic (such as addition or multiplication) or geometric (as a
rotation about a point or an axis) or any other rule for combining two
elements of a set (such as two transformations) to form a third element
in the set. The generality of the group concept is readily apparent.
Klein, in a celebrated inaugural program in 1872, when he became a
professor at Erlangen, showed how it could be applied as a convenient
means of characterizing the various geometries that had appeared during
the century.</p>
<p>The program that Klein gave, which became known as the Erlanger
Programm, described geometry as the study of those properties of figures
that remain invariant under a particular group of transformations.
Hence, any classification of groups of transformations becomes a
codification of geometries. Plane Euclidean geometry, for example, is
the study of such properties of figures, including areas and lengths, as
remain invariant under the group of transformations made up of
translations and rotations in the plane—the so-called rigid
transformations, equivalent to Euclid’s unstated axiom that figures
remain unchanged when moved about in a plane. Analytically, the rigid
plane transformations can be written in the form</p>
<p>where ae − bd = 1; these form the elements of a group. The
“operation” that “combines” two such elements is simply that of
performing the transformations in order. It is easy to see that if the
previous transformation is followed by a second,</p>
<p>the result of the two operations performed successively is equivalent
to some single operation of this type that will carry the point (x, y)
into the point (x″, y″).</p>
<p>If, in this transformation group, one replaces the restriction that
ae − bd = 1 by the more general requirement that ae − bd ≠ 0, the new
transformations also form a group. Lengths and areas do not necessarily
remain the same, however, but a conic of given type (ellipse, parabola,
or hyperbola) will, under these transformations, remain a conic of the
same type. Such transformations, studied earlier by Möbius, are known as
affine transformations; they characterize a geometry known as affine
geometry, so called because a finite point goes into a finite point
under any such transformation. It is clear, then, that Euclidean
geometry, in Klein’s view, is only a special case of affine geometry.
Affine geometry, in its turn, becomes only a special case of a still
more general geometry—projective geometry. A projective transformation
can be written in the form</p>
<p>It is clear that if d = 0 = e and f = 1, the transformation is
affine. Interesting properties of projective transformations include the
fact that (1) a conic is transformed into a conic and (2) the cross
ratio remains invariant.</p>
<p>The work of Klein is, in a sense, a fitting climax to “The Heroic Age
in Geometry,” for he taught and lectured for half a century. So
contagious was his enthusiasm that some late-nineteenth-century figures
were willing to prophesy that not only geometry, but all of mathematics,
ultimately would be contained within the theory of groups. Nevertheless,
not all of Klein’s work was concerned with groups. His classic history
of mathematics in the nineteenth century (published posthumously) shows
how familiar he was with all aspects of the subject; his name is also
recalled today in topology in the one-sided surface known as the Klein
bottle. He was much concerned with non-Euclidean geometry, to which he
contributed the names “elliptic geometry” and “hyperbolic geometry” for
the hypotheses of the obtuse and the acute angle, respectively; for the
latter, he proposed a simple model as an alternative to that of
Beltrami. Let the hyperbolic plane be pictured as the points interior to
a circle C in the Euclidean plane, let the hyperbolic “straight line”
through two points P1 and P2 be that portion of the Euclidean line P1,
P2 that lies within C, and let the “distance” between the two points P1
and P2 within the circle be defined as</p>
<p>where Q1 and Q2 are the points of intersection of the line P1P2 with
the circle C (Fig. 20.1). With an appropriate definition of “angle”
between two “lines,” the “points,” “lines,” and “angles” in Klein’s
hyperbolic model have properties similar to those in Euclidean geometry,
except for the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>FIG. 20.1</p>
<p>Not since Monge had there been a more influential teacher, for, in
addition to giving inspiring lectures, Klein was concerned with the
teaching of mathematics at many levels and exerted a strong influence in
pedagogical circles. In 1886, he became a professor of mathematics at
Göttingen, and under his leadership, the university became a mecca to
which students from many lands, including America, flocked. In his later
years, Klein very effectively played the role of an “elder statesman” in
the realm of mathematics. Thus, the golden age of modern geometry that
had begun so auspiciously in France at the École Polytechnique, with the
work of Lagrange, Monge, and Poncelet, reached its zenith in Germany, at
the University of Göttingen, through the research and inspiration of
Gauss, Riemann, and Klein.</p>
<p>Post-Riemannian Algebraic Geometry</p>
<p>There were several new approaches to geometry toward the end of the
century that are usually classified as versions of algebraic geometry.
These had a common basis in the work of Riemann. Rather than Riemann’s
explicitly geometric publications, it was his work on complex function
theory, especially as linked to the concept of a Riemann surface in a
classic paper on Abelian functions, that provided the stimulus for most
of these investigations.</p>
<p>Initially, Alfred Clebsch (1833–1872) did more than anyone else to
exploit Riemann’s function theory for geometric purposes. Clebsch, a
mathematical grandson of Jacobi via the geometer Otto Hesse (1811–1874),
had studied in Königsberg, where he came under the influence of the
mathematical physicist Franz Neumann. His teaching career took him from
the polytechnic high school in Karlsruhe to Giessen, where he spent five
years, before being called to Göttingen. In 1868, he and Franz Neumann’s
son, Carl (1832–1925), cofounded the journal Mathematische Annalen.</p>
<p>Clebsch first called attention to our subject in a paper “On the
Application of Abelian Functions to Geometry,” which appeared in the
Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This was the beginning
of a triply oriented attack. Clebsch initially set out simply to apply
Riemann’s theory of complex functions to the study of algebraic curves.
He was well equipped to carry this out; he was familiar with the
previous work of the complex projective geometers, with the Jacobi
tradition of Abelian function theory, and with Riemann’s papers. He
obtained many fruitful results, which laid the basis for further
research. For example, he obtained a classification of curves by genus
and also considered subclasses of curves having the same genus but
different branching points.</p>
<p>Another approach was used in work that Clebsch did in collaboration
with Paul Gordan (1837–1912) of Erlangen. In a book of 1866, the Theorie
der Abelschen Functionen, they set out to reestablish the theory of
Abelian functions on the basis of algebraic geometry. Gordan is
remembered as a champion of nineteenth-century invariant theory, and we
note in this context that the turn-of-the-century school of Italian
geometers, which included Guido Castelnuovo (1865–1952), Federigo
Enriques (1871–1946), and, somewhat later, Francesco Severi (1879–1961),
relied heavily on invariants as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Clebsch turned to surfaces. He introduced double integrals,
hoping to obtain results by exploring the analogy with the Abelian
integrals applied to the study of curves. He, along with Cayley, Max
Noether (1844–1921), and the Danish mathematician H. G. Zeuthen
(1839–1920), was successful for a large number of cases. Their work was
continued by Émile Picard, a specialist in the study of double
integrals. His research was the basis for later results by Beppo Levi
(1875–1928). Yet because of the complicated nature of many surfaces,
this approach was less successful than was initially hoped for.</p>
<p>The most active direction followed was that in which geometers
applied birational transformations to the study of curves. Many of them
put their studies in Riemannian terms by noting that Riemann’s moduli
are simply birational invariants. Despite much activity by
mathematicians in the main European centers, the results eventually
seemed disappointing. By the 1920s, most of these “algebro-geometric”
efforts began to take a backseat to a purely algebraic approach, which
dominated algebraic geometry for several decades, while increasing in
generality and abstractness.</p>
