<h4 id="felix-klein">Felix Klein</h4>
<p>Klein had been Plu¨cker’s assistant at the University of Bonn during
the latter’s return to geometry, and, in a sense, he was Plu¨cker’s
successor in his enthusiasm for analytic geometry. Yet the young man’s
work in the field took a different direction—one that served to bring
some element of unity into the diversity of new results of research. The
new view may have been in part the result of visits to Paris, where
Lagrange’s hints of group theory had been developed, especially through
substitution groups, into a full-blown branch of algebra. Klein was
deeply impressed by the unifying possibilities in the group concept, and
he spent much of the rest of his life in developing, applying, and
popularizing the notion.</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a group with respect to a given
operation if (1) the set of elements is closed under the operation, (2)
the set contains an identity element with respect to the operation, (3)
for every element in the set there is an inverse element with respect to
the operation, and (4) the operation is associative. The elements can be
numbers (as in arithmetic), points (in geometry), transformations (in
algebra or geometry), or anything at all. The operation can be
arithmetic (such as addition or multiplication) or geometric (as a
rotation about a point or an axis) or any other rule for combining two
elements of a set (such as two transformations) to form a third element
in the set. The generality of the group concept is readily apparent.
Klein, in a celebrated inaugural program in 1872, when he became a
professor at Erlangen, showed how it could be applied as a convenient
means of characterizing the various geometries that had appeared during
the century.</p>
<p>The program that Klein gave, which became known as the Erlanger
Programm, described geometry as the study of those properties of figures
that remain invariant under a particular group of transformations.
Hence, any classification of groups of transformations becomes a
codification of geometries. Plane Euclidean geometry, for example, is
the study of such properties of figures, including areas and lengths, as
remain invariant under the group of transformations made up of
translations and rotations in the plane—the so-called rigid
transformations, equivalent to Euclid’s unstated axiom that figures
remain unchanged when moved about in a plane. Analytically, the rigid
plane transformations can be written in the form</p>
<p>x0 5ax1by1c; y0 5dx1ey1f; where ae2bd51; these form the elements of a
group. The “operation” that “combines” two such elements is simply that
of performing the transformations in order. It is easy to see that if
the previous transformation is followed by a second,</p>
<p>xv 5Ax0 1By0 1C; yv 5Dx0 1Ey0 1F;</p>
<p>the result of the two operations performed successively is equivalent
to some single operation of this type that will carry the point (x, y)
into the point (xv, yv).</p>
<p>If, in this transformation group, one replaces the restriction that
ae2bd51 by the more general requirement that ae2bd 6¼ 0, the new
transformations also form a group. Lengths and areas do not necessarily
remain the same, however, but a conic of given type (ellipse, parabola,
or hyperbola) will, under these transformations, remain a conic of the
same type. Such transformations, studied earlier by Mo¨bius, are known
as affine transformations; they characterize a geometry known as affine
geometry, so called because a finite point goes into a finite point
under any such transformation. It is clear, then, that Euclidean
geometry, in Klein’s view, is only a special case of affine geometry.
Affine geometry, in its turn, becomes only a special case of a still
more general geometry—projective geometry. A projective transformation
can be written in the form</p>
<p>ax1by1c Ax1By1c x0 5; y0 5: dx1ey1f dx1ey1f</p>
<p>It is clear that if d505e and f51, the transformation is affine.
Interesting properties of projective transformations include the fact
that (1) a conic is transformed into a conic and (2) the cross ratio
remains invariant.</p>
<p>The work of Klein is, in a sense, a fitting climax to “The Heroic Age
in Geometry,” for he taught and lectured for half a century. So
contagious was his enthusiasm that some late-nineteenth-century figures
were willing to prophesy that not only geometry, but all of mathematics,
ultimately would be contained within the theory of groups. Nevertheless,
not all of Klein’s work was concerned with groups. His classic history
of mathematics in the nineteenth century (published posthumously) shows
how familiar he was with all aspects of the subject; his name is also
recalled today in topology in the one-sided surface known as the Klein
bottle. He was much concerned with non-Euclidean geometry, to which he
contributed the names “elliptic geometry” and “hyperbolic geometry” for
the hypotheses of the obtuse and the acute angle, respectively; for the
latter, he proposed a simple model as an alternative to that of
Beltrami.</p>
<p>Po s t Rie mannian Algebraic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>Let the hyperbolic plane be pictured as the points interior to a
circle C in the Euclidean plane, let the hyperbolic “straight line”
through two points P1 and P2 be that portion of the Euclidean line P1,
P2 that lies within C, and let the “distance” between the two points P1
and P2 within the circle be defined as</p>
<p>P2Q1UP1Q2 ln ;</p>
<p>P1Q1UP2Q2</p>
<p>where Q1 and Q2 are the points of intersection of the line P1P2 with
the circle C (Fig. 20.1). With an appropriate definition of “angle”
between two “lines,” the “points,” “lines,” and “angles” in Klein’s
hyperbolic model have properties similar to those in Euclidean geometry,
except for the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>Not since Monge had there been a more influential teacher, for, in
addition to giving inspiring lectures, Klein was concerned with the
teaching of mathematics at many levels and exerted a strong influence in
pedagogical circles. In 1886, he became a professor of mathematics at
Go¨ttingen, and under his leadership, the university became a mecca to
which students from many lands, including America, flocked. In his later
years, Klein very effectively played the role of an “elder statesman” in
the realm of mathematics. Thus, the golden age of modern geometry that
had begun so auspiciously in France at the E´cole Polytechnique, with
the work of Lagrange, Monge, and Poncelet, reached its zenith in
Germany, at the University of Go¨ttingen, through the research and
inspiration of Gauss, Riemann, and Klein.</p>
