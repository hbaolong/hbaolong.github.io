<h4 id="mathematical-physics-in-english-speaking-countries">Mathematical
Physics in English-Speaking Countries</h4>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of English-speaking
men promoted mathematical physics in Great Britain and elsewhere. The
earliest significant nineteenth-century contributions to mathematical
physics across the channel were those of the Irishman William Rowan
Hamilton. When he initiated his studies on dynamics in the 1830s, he
drew heavily on concepts he had developed while establishing a
mathematical theory of optics in the late 1820s. Key to his method was
the introduction of variational principles into the treatment of certain
partial differential equations. He built on work by Lagrange and Poisson
but utilized physical principles established earlier. Jacobi, working
out his own dynamics in the 1830s, recast Hamilton’s innovative ideas
and called attention to them in the context of his own theory. The
result is now known as the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Hamilton’s primary
champion was the Scottish physicist Peter Guthrie Tait (1831 1901).
Among Tait’s mathematical contributions are early studies of knots; in
this, he followed a little-known line of research by Gauss and Listing,
prompted by electrodynamic investigations. His name came to be known to
generations in linkage with that of William Thomson through the classic
Treatise on Natural Philosophy, usually simply referred to as “T and T”
or “T and Tu.” This work, which first appeared in 1867, went through
several editions. Although it does not make for light reading, nearly a
century after its first publication it reappeared as a paperback with
the title Principles of Mechanics and Dynamics.</p>
<p>William Thomson, Tait’s coauthor, is better known by his title as
Lord Kelvin. Born in Belfast, raised in Glasgow, and educated in
Cambridge, he discovered Fourier’s book on heat theory as an adolescent
and shortly thereafter was given a copy of Green’s rare 1828 Essay.
Thomson not only studied Green’s work himself but made it known on the
Continent. His earliest mathematical contributions of the 1840s were
furthered through communication with Liouville, in whose Journal they
appeared. They relate to the method of inversion and to Dirichlet’s
principle, both treated with regard to electricity and magnetism.
Subsequent research tended to be more physically and experimentally
oriented.</p>
<p>Thomson was a contemporary of an English physicist whose name is
familiar to every student of advanced calculus: George Gabriel Stokes
(1819 1903). Stokes graduated from Cambridge in 1841; like Thomson, he
had been senior wrangler. Much of his research was done before 1850;
during the second part of the century, he held the Lucasian chair of
mathematics at Cambridge and was an active member of the Royal Society,
whose Copley medal he had won for a major study on optics in the early
fifties. William Thomson knew the theorem that bears Stokes’s name in
1850, although it first appeared in print in the form of an exam
question in 1854. Stokes proved the theorem when Thomson sent it to him
in 1850 and seems to have chosen it as an examination question.</p>
<p>One of those taking this examination in 1854 was James Clerk Maxwell
(1831 1879). Best known for his stunningly successful derivation, in
1864, of the electromagnetic wave equations, he was influential in
urging on mathematicians and physicists the use of vectors. A friend of
Tait’s, he, too, admired Hamilton. Yet he avoided becoming heavily
involved in the notational quarrels surrounding many advocates of the
use of vector analysis.</p>
<p>Before leaving the English-speaking analysts of the period, we should
note some important contributions from those studying celestial
mechanics. As previously noted, nineteenth-century theoretical
astronomers had two great guidebooks: one was Laplace’s Mecanique
celeste´ , the other Gauss’s Theoria motus. The translation of Laplace’s
work into English brought to European attention an American, Nathaniel
Bowditch (1773 1838), in the 1830s. The subject was one in which
American analysts were repeatedly to make their mark, the most notable
nineteenth-century American contribution being that of George William
Hill (1838 1914). In 1877 1878, Hill published two important papers on
lunar theory, in which he established the theory of linear differential
equations with periodic coefficients. After Henri Poincare noted the´
importance of this work in 1885, the first of these papers was
republished in Mittag-Leffler’s Acta Mathematica, and attention was
drawn to the recently established American Journal of Mathematics, the
first volume of which had contained Hill’s other paper.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Astronomer Royal of England</p>
<p>G. B. Airy (1801 1892) made numerous contributions to the study
of</p>
<p>Weier s tra s s and Student s</p>
<p>series and integrals, which, although they belong to the age of Gauss
and Cauchy, were important in the effect they had on England’s
midcentury analysts and mathematical physicists. For example, in his
optical studies in 1850, Stokes was confronted with an integral that
Airy had used to describe a certain situation involving diffraction.
Stokes set up a differential equation having Airy’s integral as a
special solution and solved the equation by “semiconvergent” series.
This was one of the early examples of work that subsequently led to the
more general theory of such series established by T.-J. Stieltjes (1856
1894).</p>
