<h4 id="rod-numerals">Rod Numerals</h4>
<p>Had Chinese mathematics enjoyed uninterrupted continuity of
tradition, some of the striking anticipations of modern methods might
have significantly modified the development of mathematics. But Chinese
culture was seriously hampered by abrupt breaks. In 213 BCE, for
example, the Chinese emperor ordered the burning of books, an
internationally popular activity at times of political stress. Some
works obviously must have survived, either through the existence of
copies or through oral transmission, and learning did indeed persist,
with mathematical emphasis on problems of commerce and the calendar.</p>
<p>There seems to have been contact between India and China, as well as
between China and the West, but scholars differ on the extent and
direction of borrowing. The temptation to see Babylonian or Greek
influence in China, forexample, is faced with theproblem that theChinese
did not make use of sexagesimal fractions. Chinese numeration remained
essentially decimal, with notations rather strikingly different from
those in other lands. In China, from early times, two schemes of
notation were in use. In one, the multiplicative principle predominated;
in the other, a form of positional notation was used. In the first of
these, there were distinct ciphers for the digits from 1 to 10 and
additional ciphers for the powers of 10, and in the written forms, the
digits in odd positions (from left to right or from bottom to top) were
multiplied by their successor. Thus, the number 678 would be written as
a 6, followed by the symbol for 100, then a 7, followed by the symbol
for 10, and finally the symbol for 8.</p>
<p>In the system of “rod numerals,” the digits from 1 to 9 appeared as ,
and the first nine multiples of 10 as</p>
<p>. By the use of these eighteen symbols</p>
<p>alternately in positions from right to left, numbers as large as
desired could be represented. The number 56,789, for instance, would
appear as</p>
<p>. As in Babylonia, a symbol for an empty position appeared</p>
<p>only relatively late. In a work of 1247, the number 1,405,536 is
written with a round zero symbol as . (Occasionally, as in the
fourteenth-century form of the arithmetic triangle, the vertical and
horizontal rods or strokes were interchanged.)</p>
<p>The precise age of the original rod numerals cannot be determined,
but they were certainly in use several hundred years before our era that
is, long before the positional notation had been adopted in India. The
use of a centesimal, rather than a decimal, positional system in China
was convenient for adaptation to computations with the counting board.
Distinctive notations for neighboring powers often enabled the Chinese
to use, without confusion, a counting board with unmarked vertical
columns. Before the eighth century, the place in which a zero was
required was simply left blank. Although in texts older than 300 CE, the
numbers and multiplication tables were written out in words,
calculations actually were made with rod numerals on a counting
board.</p>
<p>TheAbacus and Decimal Fractions</p>
<p>The rod numerals of about 300 BCE were not merely a notation for the
written result of a computation. Actual bamboo, ivory, or iron rods were
carried about in a bag by administrators and used as a calculating
device. Counting rods were manipulated with such dexterity that an
eleventhcentury writer described them as “flying so quickly that the eye
could not follow their movement.” Cancellations probably were more
rapidly carried out with rods on a counting board than in written
calculations. So effective, in fact, was the use of the rods on a
counting board that the abacus or rigid counting frame with movable
markers on wires was not used so early as has been generally supposed.
The first clear descriptions of the modern forms, known in China as the
suan phan and in Japan as the soroban, are of the sixteenth century, but
anticipations would appear</p>
<p>T he Ab ac us and D e c imal F rac t ions</p>
<p>to have been in use perhaps a thousand years earlier. The word
“abacus” is probably derived from the Semitic word “abq,” or “dust,”
indicating that in other lands, as well as in China, the device grew out
of a dust or sand tray used as a counting board. It is possible, but by
no means certain, that the use of the counting board in China antedates
the European, but clear-cut and reliable dates are not available. We
have noted that in the National Museum in Athens, there is a marble
slab, dating probably from the fourth century BCE, that appears to be a
counting board. And when a century earlier Herodotus wrote, “The
Egyptians move their hand from right to left in calculation, while the
Greeks move it from left to right,” he was probably referring to the use
of some sort of counting board. Just when such devices gave way to the
abacus proper is difficult to determine, nor can we tell whether the
appearances of the abacus in China, Arabia, and Europe were independent
inventions. The Arabic abacus had ten balls on each wire and no center
bar, whereas the Chinese had five lower and two upper counters on each
wire, separated by a bar. Each of the upper counters on a wire of the
Chinese abacus is</p>
<p>An early printed picture of an abacus, from the Suan Fa Tongzong,</p>
<p>1592 (Reproduced from J. Needham 1959, Vol. 3, p. 76.)</p>
<p>equivalent to five on the lower wire; a number is registered by
sliding the appropriate counters against the separating bar.</p>
<p>No description of Chinese numeration would be complete without
referencetotheuseoffractions.TheChinesewerefamiliarwithoperations on
common fractions, in connection with which they found lowest common
denominators. As in other contexts, they saw analogies with the
differences in the sexes, referring to the numerator as the “son” and to
the denominator as the “mother.” Emphasis on yin and yang (opposites,
especially in sex) made it easier to follow the rules for the
manipulation of fractions. More important than these, however, was the
tendency in China toward decimalization of fractions. As in Mesopotamia,
a sexagesimal metrology led to sexagesimal numeration, so also in China
adherence to the decimal idea in weights and measures resulted in a
decimal habit in the treatment of fractions that, it is said, can be
traced back as far as the fourteenth century BCE. Decimal devices in
computation were sometimes adopted to lighten manipulations of
fractions. In a first-century commentary on the Nine Chapters, for
example, we find the use of the now-familiar rules for square and cube
roots, equivalent to pa5p100a=10 and p3 a5p3 1000a=10; which facilitate
the decimalization of root extractions. The idea of negative numbers
seems not to have occasioned much difficulty for the Chinese because
they were accustomed to calculating with two sets of rods—a red set for
positive coefficients or numbers and a black set for negatives.
Nevertheless, they did not accept the notion that a negative number
might be a solution of an equation.</p>
