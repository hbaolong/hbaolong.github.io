<h4 id="philolaus-and-archytas-of-tarentum">Philolaus and Archytas of
Tarentum</h4>
<p>Pythagoras is said to have retired to Metapontum toward the end of
his life and to have died there about 500 BCE. Tradition holds that he
left no written works, but his ideas were carried on by a large number
of eager disciples. The center at Croton was abandoned when a rival
political group from Sybaris surprised and murdered many of the leaders,
but those who escaped the massacre carried the doctrines of the school
to other parts of the Greek world. Among those who received instruction
from the refugees was Philolaus of Tarentum, and he is said to have
written the first account of Pythagoreanism—permission having been
granted, so the story goes, to repair his damaged fortunes. Apparently,
it was this book from which Plato derived his knowledge of the
Pythagorean order. The number fanaticism that was so characteristic of
the brotherhood evidently was shared by Philolaus, and it was from his
account that much of the mystical lore concerning the tetractys was
derived, as well as knowledge of the Pythagorean cosmology. The
Philolaean cosmic scheme is said to have been modified by two later
Pythagoreans, Ecphantus and Hicetas, who abandoned the central fire and
the counterearth and explained day and night by placing a rotating earth
at the center of the universe. The extremes of Philolaean number worship
also seem to have undergone some modification, more especially at the
hands of Archytas, a student of Philolaus’s at Tarentum.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean sect had exerted a strong intellectual influence
throughout Magna Graecia, with political overtones that may be described
asasortof“reactionaryinternational,”orperhapsbetterasacrossbetween
Orphism and Freemasonry. At Croton, political aspects were especially
noticeable, but at outlying Pythagorean centers, such as Tarentum, the
impact was primarily intellectual. Archytas believed firmly in the
efficacy of number; his rule of the city, which allotted him autocratic
powers, was justandrestrained,forheregarded

reportedtohaveinvented“Archytas’srattle.”Possiblyalsothemechanical dove,
which he is said to have fashioned of wood, was built to amuse the young
folk.</p>
<p>Archytas continued the Pythagorean traditionin placingarithmetic
above geometry, but his enthusiasm for number had less of the religious
and mysticaladmixturefoundearlierinPhilolaus.Hewroteontheapplicationof
the arithmetic, geometric, and subcontrary means to music, and it was
probablyeither PhilolausorArchytas whowasresponsible forchangingthe name
of the last one to “harmonic mean.” Among his statements in this
connectionwastheobservationthatbetweentwowholenumbersintheratio n:(n11),
there could be no integer that is a geometric mean. Archytas gave more
attention to music than had his predecessors, and he felt that this
subjectshouldplayagreaterrolethanliteratureintheeducationofchildren.
Amonghisconjectureswasonethatattributeddifferencesinpitchtovarying rates
of motion resulting from the flow that caused the sound. Archytas seems
to have paid considerable attention to the role of mathematics in the
curriculum, and to him has been ascribed the designation of the four
branches in the mathematical quadrivium—arithmetic (or numbers at rest),
geometry (or magnitudes at rest), music (or numbers in motion), and
astronomy (or magnitudes in motion). These subjects, together with the
trivium consisting of grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics (which Aristotle
traced back to Zeno), later constituted the seven liberal arts; hence,
the prominent role that mathematics has played in education is in no
small measure due to Archytas.</p>
<p>It is likely that Archytas had access to an earlier treatise on the
elements of mathematics, and the iterative square-root process often
known as Archytas’s had been used long before in Mesopotamia.
Nevertheless, Archytas was a contributor of original mathematical
results. The most striking contribution was a three-dimensional solution
of the Delian problem, which may be most easily described, somewhat
anachronistically, in the modern language of analytic geometry. Let a be
the edge of the cube to be doubled, and let the point (a, 0, 0) be the
center of three</p>
<p>Inc ommensurabili t y</p>
<p>mutually perpendicular circles of radius a and each lying in a plane
perpendicular to a coordinate axis. Through the circle perpendicular to
the x-axis, construct a right circular cone with vertex (0, 0, 0);
through the circle in the xy-plane, pass a right circular cylinder; and
let the circle in the xz-plane be revolved about the z-axis to generate
a torus. The equations of these three surfaces are, respectively, x2 5y2
1z2 and 2ax5x2 1y2 and (x2 1y2 1z2)2 54a2(px32 1y2). These three
surfaces intersect in a point whose x-coordinate is a 12; hence, the
length of this line segment is the edge of the cube desired.</p>
<p>The achievement of Archytas is the more impressive when we recall
that his solution was worked out synthetically without the aid of
coordinates. Nevertheless, Archytas’s most important contribution to
mathematics may have been his intervention with the tyrant Dionysius to
save the life of his friend Plato. The latter remained to the end of his
life deeply committed to the Pythagorean veneration of number and
geometry, and the supremacy of Athens in the mathematical world of the
fourth century BCE resulted primarily from the enthusiasm of Plato, the
“maker of mathematicians.” Before taking up the role of Plato in
mathematics, however, it is necessary to discuss the work of an earlier
Pythagorean—an apostate by the name of Hippasus.</p>
<p>Hippasus of Metapontum (or Croton), roughly contemporaneous with
Philolaus, is reported to have originally been a Pythagorean but to have
been expelled from the brotherhood. One account has it that the
Pythagoreans erected a tombstone to him, as though he were dead; another
story reports that his apostasy was punished by death at sea in a
shipwreck. The exact cause of the break is unknown, in part because of
the rule of secrecy, but there are three suggested possibilities.
According to one, Hippasus was expelled for political insubordination,
having headed a democratic movement against the conservative Pythagorean
rule. A second tradition attributes the expulsion to disclosures
concerning the geometry of the pentagon or the dodecahedron—perhaps a
construction of one of the figures. A third explanation holds that the
expulsion was coupled with the disclosure of a mathematical discovery of
devastating significance for Pythagorean philosophy—the existence of
incommensurable magnitudes.</p>
