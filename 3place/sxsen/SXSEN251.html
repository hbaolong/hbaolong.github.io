<h4 id="classification-of-finite-simple-groups">Classification of Finite
Simple Groups</h4>
<p>The classification of finite simple groups is embodied in the
following theorem:</p>
<p>Every finite simple group belongs to (is isomorphic to) at least one
of the following sets of groups:</p>
<p>The cyclic groups of prime order;</p>
<p>The alternating groups of degree at least 5;</p>
<p>The simple Lie groups, including the classical groups, as well as the
twisted Lie groups and the Tits group;</p>
<p>or is one of 26 sporadic simple groups.</p>
<p>This classification theorem differs from most theorems in several
respects. Some of the groups were discovered only after a classification
program was underway; the theorem was cobbled together from numerous
articles written by scores of mathematicians after the enterprise had
begun, and it required general oversight and teams of verifiers to
confirm the validity of the component parts. Once the theorem could be
stated in its present form, a major effort was initiated to unify these
component parts, streamlining and replacing some of the individual
proofs so that the final theorem and its proof could give the appearance
of a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Certain types of simple groups had been classified decades before the
general classification program was initiated. For example, Elie Cartan
and Wilhelm Killing (18471923) classified simple Lie groups in the
1890s, in conjunction with their classification of Lie algebras. The
first sporadic groups, known as the first five Mathieu groups, were
discovered by E´mile Mathieu even earlier, when he studied transitive
groups in the 1860s. There were other isolated results that would become
part of the classification theorem. What might have initiated a more
systematic approach to the study of abstract groups and of the
classification of simple groups was the work of William Burnside
(18521927), especially after publication in 1897 of his volume on The
Theory of Groups of Finite Order, which was the first English-language
textbook on group theory.</p>
<p>In a series of papers published in the 1890s, Burnside set out to
establish whether, given a number N, a simple group of order N exists.
The first of these papers, published in 1893, contained a proof that the
alternating group A5 is the only finite simple group whose order is the
product of four primes. In another paper, he showed that if a group G of
even order has a cyclic Sylow subgroup, then G cannot be simple. He also
conjectured that every noncommutative finite simple group has even
order.</p>
<p>It was Richard Brauer (19011977) who tied up several trends leading
to the classification theorem and first enunciated a program to reach
that goal. Among a few relevant highlights of his previous research, we
note his use of the groups that came to be known as “Brauer” groups in
studying the structure of simple algebras. These were Abelian groups
formed by the isomorphism classes of central division algebras over a
perfect field and were central to his study of the structure of simple
algebras. In 1937, in joint work with his doctoral student C. J.
Nesbitt, he used the theory of blocks that remained central in his later
studies of finite simple groups. About 1950, he began to work on an
approach to classifying all finite simple groups. At the 1954
International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam, he announced his
program for this classification and presented a significant result that
would be included in the joint paper “On Groups of Even Order” that he
and another of his doctoral students, K. A. Fowler, published the
following year. This result stated that there are only finitely many
simple groups containing an involution whose centralizer is a given
finite group. Because a group of odd order is without involutions, this
is generally considered the clue that helped establish the way for a
classification program and—along with intermediate results from Michio
Suzuki (19261998) and Philip Hall (19041982)—for the famous 255-page
memoir by John Thompson and Walter Feit (19302004), in which they proved
that finite groups having odd order are solvable or, equivalently, that
every finite simple group has even order.</p>
<p>In 19601961, the University of Chicago held a Group Theory Year.
Daniel Gorenstein (19231992), who would soon assume the role of
coordinating the efforts of those involved in the classification
project, cited this as his first encounter with the leaders in the field
of simple group theory. It was at this meeting that Walter Feit and John
Thompson first revealed the odd-order theorem, which lent an aura of
feasibility to the idea of a joint endeavor to settle the classification
issue for simple finite groups. It was obvious, however, that the
project required coordination. This, after initial guidance from Brauer,
became Gorenstein’s task. In accepting the Steele prize for exposition
in 1989, Gorenstein himself claimed that</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L a s t T he or e m</p>
<p>it was Aschbacher’s entry into the field in the early 1970s that
irrevocably altered the simple group landscape. Quickly assuming a
leadership role in a single minded pursuit of the full classification
theorem, he was to carry the entire “team” along with him over the
following decade until the proof was completed.</p>
<p>The challenge was threefold:</p>
<p>1.It was unclear how many groups would be involved; of the twentysix
sporadic groups, only five were known; the others were discovered in the
course of the project, between 1965 and 1975;</p>
<p>2.The proofs were numerous and long; the Feit-Thompson proof of
theodd-order theorem took up 255 pages but was not the longest; there
were dozens of mathematicians adding hundreds more pages to the project;
verification would be a massive undertaking;</p>
<p>3.The research all seemed to be part of a closed system, with
noapparent external usefulness.</p>
<p>In answer to the criticisms, Gorenstein observed that “all the moves
we were making seemed to be forced. It was not perversity on our part,
but the intrinsic nature of the problem that seemed to be controlling
the directions of our efforts and shaping the techniques being
developed.”</p>
<p>Despite all of these difficulties, Daniel Gorenstein felt it safe to
announce in 1983 that the classification had been completed.
Verification had shown up some gaps and minor flaws in some of the
proofs, but these had all been repaired. There was one major concern,
however: there appeared to be a more serious gap in the unpublished
proof of the quasithin case. Michael Aschbacher and Steve Smith came to
the rescue by 2004, publishing their own two-volume proof of more than
1,200 pages for this case. After 1985, a concerted effort to simplify
and shorten some of the earlier proofs began, which was partly
successful because the statement of the theorem was now known, as were
the families of groups involved. The final unified version of the proof
was still estimated to take up some 5,000 pages. Nevertheless,
acceptance of the proof became more widespread, and the proof was also
made more palatable by the fact that the classification theorem could be
applied in other areas of mathematics. Fermat’s Last Theorem</p>
<p>Fermat’s so-called Last Theorem asserts that the equation xn 1yn 5zn
has no nonzero integral solution for x, y, z when n.2. In one of the
most famous marginal notations of history, Fermat’s copy of Diophantus’s
Arithmetica indicates that he has a proof, but the margin is too small
to contain it. As we have noted in previous chapters, among the
well-known mathematicians who attempted a proof was Euler, who is
credited with a proof for n53, Sophie Germain and Legendre for n55,
Dirichlet for n55 and n514, and Lame for´ n57.</p>
<p>In 1847, Lame presented to the Acad´ emie des Sciences a purported
proof´ of the theorem based on factorization over the complex number
field. Liouville pointed out that this assumed unique factorization,
which prompted a flurry of attempts to prove unique factorization. Soon
thereafter, Kummer informed Liouville, and through him the Academy, of a
paper published three years earlier, in which he had shown that unique
factorization fails; he had found a way of circumventing the problem,
however, by the introduction in 1846 of “ideal complex numbers.” Kummer
now proceeded to prove Fermat’s theorem for regular primes. This
naturally led to establishing conditions for the regularity of primes.
Later, in 1847, Kummer proved that a prime p is regular if p does not
divide the numerator of any of the Bernoulli numbers B2, B4,…, Bp 3. He
had also noted that several primes do not meet this criterion. This now
set up a new, longerlasting wave of excitement. For more than a century,
there were attempted proofs that some of the known irregular primes
satisfied the equation and that the number of regular primes is
infinite. Eventually, computers were called into action to show that the
theorem holds for values of n up to 4 million—which, of course, still
does not constitute a proof. There were many faulty attempts, many
amateurish efforts, but also work by serious number theorists such as H.
A. Vandiver (18821973), who spent many research hours on the apparently
intractable theorem.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the cavalry came to the rescue from the camp of
elliptic curves and modular forms. There was a conjecture, due to Goro
Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama (19271958), that every elliptic curve over
the rationals is modular. This conjecture had been known since the 1950s
but became more widely publicized after Andre Weil, who had praised
Shi-´ mura’s work in early reviews, brought supporting examples in 1967.
It was verified for numerous special cases. In 1985, Gerhard Frey, at
that time at the University of Saarbru¨cken, observed that if the
conjecture were true, this would imply Fermat’s Last Theorem. Serre
pinned down this observation (“all but ε”) with what came to be known as
the ε-conjecture, and within the same year, Ken Ribet, of the University
of California at Berkeley, proved the ε-conjecture and showed that the
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture need be true only for so-called semistable
elliptic curves in order for Fermat’s Last Theorem to hold.</p>
<p>In June 1993, Andrew Wiles gave a series of three lectures at the
Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge. The third lecture appeared to show
that the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is true for semistable elliptic
curves. One of the corollaries that Wiles wrote on the blackboard with
the words “I will stop here” was Fermat’s Last Theorem.</p>
<p>Wiles had been interested in Fermat’s theorem since he read about it
at the age of ten. After graduating from Oxford in 1974, he proceeded to
earn his doctorate at Cambridge University, having John Coates as
his</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L a s t T he or e m</p>
<p>supervisor. By this time, he had read widely on the history of the
Fermat theorem and realized it would be unwise to pursue its proof as a
thesis or an alternate research project. Instead, he worked with John
Coates on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves and presented a
dissertation on “Reciprocity Laws and the Conjecture of Birch and
SwinnnertonDyer,” areas known to be among the most challenging of the
time; his doctorate was awarded in 1980.</p>
<p>Wiles learned about Ribet’s result in 1986. He described the event in
an interview on PBS’s NOVA program:</p>
<p>It was one evening at the end of the summer of 1986, when I was
sipping iced tea at the house of a friend. Casually, in the middle of a
conversation, this friend told me that Ken Ribet had proved a link
between TaniyamaShimura and Fermat’s Last Theorem. I was electrified. I
knew that moment that the course of my life was changing because this
meant that to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, all I had to do was to prove
the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. It meant that my childhood dream was
now a respectable thing to work on. I just knew that I could never let
that go…. Nobody had any idea how to approach Taniyama-Shimura, but at
least it was mainstream mathematics. I could try and prove results,
which, even if they didn’t get the whole thing, would be worthwhile
mathematics. So the romance of Fermat, which had held me all my life,
was now combined with a problem that was professionally acceptable.</p>
<p>For the next seven years, Wiles focused intensely on the problem at
hand. He did not discuss it with friends or colleagues because he felt
that any mention of Fermat would cause too much interest and
distraction. Indeed, his 1993 lectures created a sensation that was
surpassed only by word that he had discovered a gap in his proof while
preparing the three lectures for publication. Experts quickly decided
that his attempted proof would go down in history as just another failed
effort to settle the question of Fermat’s Last Theorem. They were wrong.
Within a year, Wiles had fixed the proof. In 1995, “Modular Elliptic
Curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem” appeared in the Annals of Mathematics,
together with a supplement, coauthored by his student R. Taylor,
“Ring-Theoretic Properties of Hecke Algebras.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, building in part on Wiles’s work, in 1999 the full
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was proved. Now a theorem, this powerful
statement would have significant consequences for number theory and for
the so-called Langlands program of conjectures concerning number and
representation theory.</p>
<p>From 1995 on, prizes, awards, and a knighthood poured on Wiles, who
was by this time firmly established at Princeton University. Ironically,
the chief award of the international mathematical community, the Fields
medal, was not one of them. As previously noted, this medal is awarded
at the meetings of the International Congress of Mathematicians to
mathematicians below the age of forty for work done and the promise of
future achievements. Wiles had turned forty in April 1993.</p>
<p>Poincare’s Query´</p>
<p>In the decade from 1895 to 1904, Henri Poincare published a series
of´ fundamental memoirs that laid much of the foundation for analysis
situs, otherwise known as combinatorial or algebraic topology. The
initial, introductory publication of 1895 appeared in the Journal de
l’E´cole Polytechnique; more than 120 pages long, it was followed by a
series of additions and corrections that were spread among the
publications of the Circolo Matematico of Palermo, the London
Mathematical Society, and the Societ´ e Math´ ematique de France, along
with supplements in the´ Comptes rendus of the Academie des Sciences of
Paris. As noted in´ chapter 23, it was in these memoirs that Poincare
established relation-´ ships between Betti numbers, the fundamental
group, and other concepts basic to homology theory.</p>
<p>In the second supplement (1900) to the 1895 memoir, Poincare had´
stated that every torsion-free polyhedron with Betti numbers equal to 1
is simply connected. By the time of the fifth supplement in 1904, he
produced a counterexample that came to be known as “Poincare’s homology´
sphere”; it consisted of two suitably connected double tori. Although it
can be constructed in numerous different ways, Poincare’s homology
sphere is´ still the only known three-dimensional manifold that has the
same homology as the 3-sphere without being homeomorphic to it. His
counterexample led Poincare to close the memoir with the following
query:´</p>
<p>Is it possible that the fundamental group of 〔the manifold〕 V
reduces to the identity substitution and yet V is not simply connected
〔is not homeomorphic to the 3-sphere〕?</p>
<p>We note with interest that Poincare’s query, unlike Newton’s queries
in´ his appendix to the Opticks, is not formulated in the negative,
suggesting a positive response, but as a neutral question. Nevertheless,
this is the statement that was to become famous as “Poincare’s
Conjecture.”´</p>
<p>It was only in the 1930s, more than twenty years after Poincare’s´
death, that the question sparked substantial interest among topologists.
One of the first noted practitioners of this growing field who announced
that he had a proof of the Poincare conjecture was J. H. C. Whitehead´
(19041960). Deeper study showed him that he was mistaken.</p>
<p>In the process, he discovered some interesting examples of simply
connected noncompact 3-manifolds not homeomorphic to R3, the prototype
of which is now called the Whitehead manifold.</p>
<p>Poinc ar e’s Q uer y´</p>
<p>Numerous topologists followed Whitehead in the unsuccessful quest for
an answer to Poincare’s query. As an example, we mention three who´
earned their degrees under the supervision of R. L. Moore (18821974) in
Texas: R H Bing (19141986), E. E. Moise, and Steve Armentrout. Bing had
some measure of success by proving a watered-down version of the
conjecture. In 1958, he established that if every simple closed curve of
a compact 3-manifold is contained in a 3-ball, then the manifold is
homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.</p>
<p>Although attempts to resolve the Poincare conjecture for dimension 3´
seemed to go nowhere, the question arose what could be said for higher
dimensions. Here, there are simply connected manifolds that are not
homeomorphic to an n-sphere. It did not seem that a homotopy n-sphere
exists that is homeomorphic to an n-sphere. In 1961, however, Stephen
Smale proved the so-called generalized Poincare conjecture for dimen-´
sions higher than 4; in 1982, Michael Freedman proved the conjecture for
dimension 4.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, William Thurston provided a conjecture on classifying
3-manifolds. He suggested that any 3-manifold can be uniquely divided so
that each part has one of eight specified geometries. One is quickly
reminded of the uniformization theorem for two dimensions where a
similar division involves three geometries. Thurston’s so-called
geometrization conjecture became known in a set of lectures of 1980 and
was published in 1982. Although there was no obvious relationship
between it and the Poincare conjecture, as John Morgan noted, Thurston’s
work´ helped build a growing consensus that the Poincare conjecture, as
well´ as Thurston’s own conjecture, are true; by 2006, Thurston’s had
been confirmed for six of the eight geometries. The two remaining
difficult cases were those of spherical and hyperbolic geometries.
Thurston devoted himself to studies of the hyperbolic case, which has
metrics of constant negative curvature, as opposed to the spherical with
metric of constant positive curvature that would apply to the Poincare
conjecture.´</p>
<p>In 1982, Richard Hamilton introduced the Ricci flow on a manifold.
The Ricci flow equation is considered a nonlinear generalization of the
heat equation. Hamilton showed that it could be used to prove special
cases of the Poincare conjecture, but he encountered difficulties with´
certain singularities, which kept him from a full proof of the
conjecture. Another twenty years would pass before the long-awaited
proof appeared—this time on the Internet.</p>
<p>The author of this unusual proof was one Grigori Perelman of
St. Petersburg, known to his associates as Grisha. He is the son of an
electrical engineer and a mathematics teacher. When he was sixteen, he
came to public attention by earning a gold medal at the Mathematical
Olympiad in Budapest. He attended St. Petersburg University, where he
received his doctorate, then obtained a position at the Steklov
Institute, initially in the department of geometry and topology, then in
the department of partial differential equations. He spent the years
1992 to 1995 in the United States, first at the Courant Institute and at
Stony Brook, then on a two-year fellowship at the University of
California, Berkeley. At the end of this period, after refusing several
offers for positions from American universities, he returned home and
remained in virtual seclusion from 1995 to 2002.</p>
<p>While at Berkeley, Perelman had gained a reputation for brilliance
and eccentricity. He produced much but published little. For a long
time, he appeared to have little interest in the Poincare conjecture.
This changed,´ however, after he heard Hamilton repeatedly express his
conviction that the solution to solving the Poincare problem would be
found by someone´ who could resolve the singularity issues tied to the
Ricci flow. This appealed to Perelman: something to be tackled as a
problem in differential equations by a person with a sound background in
topology—a perfect fit for himself. Without letting his colleagues
suspect what had engaged him for eight years, he ended his self-imposed
exile in November 2002 by putting on the arXiv Web site the first of
three papers on Ricci flow. None of the papers mentioned Poincare or the
conjecture by name; the fact that´ he was also proving Thurston’s
geometrization conjecture appeared only as a casual mention in the first
paper. He made no effort to submit the papers for publication. Yet it
was clear to specialists in the field what this undertaking was all
about, and very soon several experts began the task of filling in
details of Perelman’s sketchy proofs, all noting that these followed
within the framework of his own techniques.</p>
<p>Three years after Perelman’s third paper had been placed on the arXiv
Web site, the matter became very public. Earlier, there had been notices
in the mathematical literature that Perelman appeared to have a proof,
but that it had not yet been verified, although, between 2003 and 2005,
several workshops were held to study the three papers. Now, in 2006,
verification was at hand.</p>
<p>In May, Bruce Kleiner and John W. Lott placed a paper on the arXiv
Web site that took care of the details of Perelman’s proof for the
difficult geometrization conjecture.</p>
<p>In the June issue of the Asian Journal of Mathematics appeared a
paper by Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu with a proof of the Poincare´ and
the geometrization conjectures. On June 20, Shing-Tung Yau gave a
lecture on the Poincare conjecture at an International Conference on´
String Theory in Beijing, in which he praised his students Cao and Zhu
for having solved the conjecture, noting that Chinese mathematicians had
reason to be proud of this great success. Yau (b. 1949), a 1982 Fields
medal winner, has made major contributions to partial differential
equations, differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Based in the
United States, he has been a supporter of mathematics education in China
and in 2004 was honored for his contribution to Chinese mathematics in
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.</p>

<p>In July, John Morgan and Gang Tian provided a proof of the Poincare´
conjecture on the arXiv Web site, which appeared in book form the
following year.</p>
<p>In August, the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) met in
Madrid. It awarded the Fields medal to Perelman—but Perelman refused to
accept the award. This may not have come as a total surprise to those
who remembered that ten years earlier, he had refused a prestigious
award given by the European Mathematical Society. John Morgan, the
author of the proof posted the previous month, gave a talk about the
conjecture at the ICM, stating in no uncertain terms that Perelman had
solved the Poincare conjecture. Meanwhile, the August issue of the´ New
Yorker contained a detailed article describing the Beijing Congress,
stressing Yau’s dismissive reference to Perelman, questioning his role
in the rapid acceptance of the Cao-Zhu paper, and portraying him in an
unflattering cartoon. Yau attempted to refute the article with a
threatened lawsuit, as well as several interviews and a clarifying
publication. Perelman, who had disproved the claim that he never spoke
to reporters by giving the New Yorker interviewers a pleasant tour of
the sights of St. Petersburg, resigned his position at the Steklov
Institute and continued to live peacefully at home with his mother.</p>
