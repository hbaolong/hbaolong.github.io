<h4 id="linear-associative-algebras">Linear Associative Algebras</h4>
<p>It was the classification of linear associative algebras that marks
the beginning of contributions by Americans to modern algebra. Benjamin
Peirce, for many years affiliated with the U.S. Coast Survey, as well as
a professor of mathematics at his alma mater, Harvard, presented this
work to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the 1860s and had
it printed with limited circulation in 1870. It only became generally
known in a version that appeared posthumously, in the American Journal
of Mathematics in 1881, with ample notes and addenda by his son Charles
S. Peirce, who had also contributed basic ideas to the original paper.
Linear associative algebras include ordinary algebra, vector analysis,
and quaternions as special cases but are not restricted to the units 1,
i, j, k. Peirce worked out multiplication tables for 162 algebras. C. S.
Peirce continued his father’s work in this direction by showing that of
all of these algebras, there are only three in which division is
uniquely defined: ordinary real algebra, the algebra of complex numbers,
and the algebra of quaternions.</p>
<p>It was in connection with his work on linear associative algebra that
in 1870, Benjamin Peirce gave the well-known definition “Mathematics is
the science which draws necessary conclusions.” His son was in
wholehearted agreement with this view, as a result of Boole’s influence,
but he stressed that mathematics and logic are not the same.
“Mathematics is purely hypothetical: it produces nothing but conditional
propositions. Logic, on the contrary, is categorical in its assertions.”
This distinction was to be argued further throughout the mathematical
world in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In England, somewhat similar ideas were pursued by William Kingdon
Clifford (1845 1879), yet another Trinity graduate, whose brilliant
work, like that of an earlier Trinity graduate, Roger Cotes, was cut
short by premature death in his thirty-fourth year. Clifford was
extraordinary in several respects. For one thing, he was a gymnast who
could pull himself up on the bar with either hand—a most unusual feat
for anyone and especially almost unheard of for one who graduated as
second wrangler. Also, like the Oxford mathematician C. L. Dodgson (1832
1898), better known as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland,
Clifford composed The Little People, a collection of tales for children.
In 1870, Clifford wrote a paper, “On the Space-Theory of Matter,” in
which he showed himself to be a staunch British supporter of the
non-Euclidean geometry of Lobachevsky and Riemann. In algebra, Clifford
also espoused the newer views, and his name is perpetuated today in the
socalled Clifford algebras, of which octonions or biquaternions are
special cases. These noncommutative algebras were used by Clifford to
study motions in non-Euclidean spaces, certain manifolds of which are
known as spaces of Clifford and Klein. How different was the progressive
British mathematics of the latter part of the nineteenth century from
the stultifyingly conservative views at the opening of the century!</p>
