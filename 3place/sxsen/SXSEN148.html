<h4 id="galileos-two-new-sciences">Galileo’s Two New Sciences</h4>
<p>While Kepler had been studying wine barrels, Galileo was scanning the
heavens with his telescope and rolling balls down inclined planes. The
results of Galileo’s efforts were two famous treatises, one astronomical
and the other physical. They were both written in Italian, but we shall
refer to them in English as The Two Chief Systems (1632) and The Two New
Sciences (1638). The first was a dialogue concerning the relative merits
of the Ptolemaic and Copernican views of the universe, carried on by
three men: Salviati (a scientifically informed scholar), Sagredo (an
intelligent layman), and Simplicio (an obtuse Aristotelian). In the
dialogue, Galileo left little doubt about where his preferences lay, and
the consequences were his trial and detention. During the years of his
exile, he nevertheless prepared The Two New Sciences, a dialogue
concerning dynamics and the strength of materials, carried out by the
same three characters. Although neither of the two great Galilean</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>Galile o’s Two New Sciences</p>
<p>treatises was in a strict sense mathematical, there are in both of
them many points at which appeal is made to mathematics, frequently to
the properties of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.</p>
<p>The infinitely small was of more immediate relevance to Galileo than
the infinitely large, for he found it essential in his dynamics. Galileo
gave the impression that dynamics was a totally new science created by
him, and all too many writers since have agreed with this claim. It is
virtually certain, however, that he was thoroughly familiar with the
work of Oresme on the latitude of forms, and several times in The Two
New Sciences, Galileo had occasion to use a diagram of velocities
similar to the triangle graph of Oresme’s. Nevertheless, Galileo
organized Oresme’s ideas and gave them a mathematical precision that had
been lacking. Among the new contributions to dynamics was Galileo’s
analysis of projectile motion into a uniform horizontal component and a
uniformly accelerated vertical component. As a result, he was able to
show that the path of a projectile, disregarding air resistance, is a
parabola. It is a striking fact that the conic sections had been studied
for almost 2,000 years before two of them almost simultaneously found
applicability in science: the ellipse in astronomy and the parabola in
physics. Galileo mistakenly thought he had found a further application
of the parabola in the curve of suspension of a flexible rope or wire or
chain (catena), but mathematicians later in the century proved that this
curve, the catenary, not only is not a parabola, it is not even
algebraic. Galileo had noted the curve now known as the cycloid, traced
out by a point on the rim of a wheel as it rolls along a horizontal
path, and he tried to find the area under one arch of it. The best he
could do was to trace the curve on paper, cut out an arch, and weigh it;
then he concluded that the area was a little less than three times the
area of the generating circle. Galileo abandoned study of the curve,
suggesting only that the cycloid would make an attractive arch for a
bridge.</p>
<p>Amore important contribution to mathematics was made by Galileo inthe
Two Chief Systems of 1632, at a point on the “third day” when Salviati
adumbrated the idea of an infinitesimal of higher order. Simplicio had
argued that an object on a rotating earth should be thrown off
tangentially by the motion, but Salviati argued that the distance QR
through which an object has to fall to remain on the earth, while the
latter rotates through a small angle θ (Fig. 15.1), is infinitely small
compared with the tangential distance PQ through which the object
travels horizontally. Hence, even a very small downward tendency, as
compared with the forward impetus, will be sufficient to hold the object
on the earth. Galileo’s argument here is equivalent to saying that
PS5vers θ is an infinitesimal of higher order with respect to lines PQ
or RS or arc PR.</p>
<p>From the infinite in geometry, Salviati led Simplicio to the infinite
in arithmetic, pointing out that a one-to-one correspondence can be set
up between all of the integers and the perfect squares, despite the fact
that the further one proceeds in the sequence of integers, the scarcer
the perfect squares become. Through the simple expedient of counting</p>
<p>Bonav entura C avalier i</p>
<p>the perfect squares, a one-to-one correspondence is established in
which each integer inevitably is matched against a perfect square, and
vice versa. Even though there are many whole numbers that are not
perfect squares (and the proportion of these increases as we consider
larger and larger numbers), “we must say that there are as many squares
as there are numbers.” Galileo here was face-to-face with the
fundamental property of an infinite set—that a part of the set can be
equal to the whole set— but Galileo did not draw this conclusion.
Although Salviati correctly concluded that the number of perfect squares
is not less than the number of integers, he could not bring himself to
make the statement that they are equal. Instead, he simply concluded
that “the attributes ‘equal,’ ‘greater,’ and ‘less’ are not applicable
to infinite, but only to finite quantities.” He even asserted
(incorrectly, we now know) that one cannot say that one infinite number
is greater than another infinite number or even that an infinite number
is greater than a finite number. Galileo, like Moses, came within sight
of the promised land, but he could not enter it.</p>
