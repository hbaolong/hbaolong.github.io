<h4 id="heron-of-alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</h4>
<p>Heron of Alexandria is best known in the history of mathematics for
the formula, bearing his name, for the area of a triangle:</p>
<p>K 5psðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞ</p>
<p>where a, b, and c are the sides and s is half of the sum of these
sides, that is, the semiperimeter. The Arabs tell us that “Heron’s
formula” was</p>
<p>Her on of A le x andr ia</p>
<p>known earlier to Archimedes, who undoubtedly had a proof of it, but
the demonstration of it in Heron’s Metrica is the earliest that we have.
Although now the formula is usually derived trigonometrically, Heron’s
proof is conventionally geometric. The Metrica, like the Method of
Archimedes, was long lost, until rediscovered at Constantinople in 1896
in a manuscript dating from about 1100. The word “geometry” originally
meant “earth measure,” but classical geometry, such as that found in
Euclid’s Elements and Apollonius’s Conics, was far removed from mundane
surveying. Heron’s work, on the other hand, shows us that not all
mathematics in Greece was of the “classical” type. There evidently were
two levels in the study of configurations—comparable to the distinction
made in numerical context between arithmetic (or theory of numbers) and
logistic (or techniques of computation)—one of which, eminently
rational, might be known as geometry and the other, largely practical,
might better be described as geodesy. The Babylonians lacked the former
but were strong in the latter, and it was essentially the Babylonian
type of mathematics that is found in Heron. It is true that in the
Metrica an occasional demonstration is included, but the body of the
work is concerned with numerical examples in mensuration of lengths,
areas, and volumes. There are strong resemblances between his results
and those found in ancient Mesopotamian problem texts. For example,
Heron gave a tabulation of the areas An, of regular polygons of n sides
in terms of the square of one side sn, beginning with A3 51330s23 and
continuing to A12 5454 s212: As was the case in pre-Hellenic
mathematics, Heron also made no distinction between results that are
exact and those that are only approximations.</p>
<p>The gap that separated classical geometry from Heronian mensuration
is clearly illustrated by certain problems set and solved by Heron in
another of his works, the Geometrica. One problem calls for the
diameter, the perimeter, and the area of a circle, given the sum of
these three magnitudes. The axiom of Eudoxus would rule out such a
problem from theoretical consideration, for the three magnitudes are of
unlike dimensions, but from an uncritical numerical point of view, the
problem makes sense. Moreover, Heron did not solve the problem in
general terms but, taking a cue again from pre-Hellenic methods, chose
the specific case in which the sum is 212; his solution is like the
ancient recipes in which only steps, without reasons, are given. The
diameter 14 is easily found by taking the Archimedean value for π and
using the Babylonian method of completing the square to solve a
quadratic equation. Heron simply gives the laconic instructions
“Multiply 212 by 154, add 841, take the square root and subtract 29, and
divide by 11.” This is scarcely the way to teach mathematics, but
Heron’s books were intended as manuals for the practitioner.</p>
<p>Heron paid as little attention to the uniqueness of his answer as he
did to the dimensionality of his magnitudes. In one problem, he called
for the sides of a right triangle if the sum of the area and the
perimeter is 280.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an indeterminate problem, but Heron gave only one
solution,makinguseof theArchimedeanformulafortheareaof atriangle. In
modern notation,if s is thesemiperimeter of thetriangle and r theradius
of the inscribed circle, then rs12s5s(r12)5280. Following his own
cookbook rule, “Always look for the factors,” he chose r1258 and
s535.Then,thearearsis210.Butthetriangleisarighttriangle,hencethe
hypotenuse c is equal to s2r or 3526, or 29; the sum of the two sides a
and b is equal to s1r, or 41. The values of a and b are then easily
found to be 20 and 21. Heron says nothing about other factorizations of
280, which, of course, would lead to other answers.</p>
<p>Principle of Least Distance</p>
<p>Heron was interested in mensuration in all its forms—in optics and
mechanics, as well as in geodesy. The law of reflection for light had
been known to Euclid and Aristotle (probably also to Plato), but it was
Heron who showed by a simple geometric argument, in a work on Catoptrics
(or reflection), that the equality of the angles of incidence and
reflection is a consequence of the Aristotelian principle that nature
does nothing the hard way. That is, if light is to travel from a source
S to a mirror MMu and then to the eye E of an observer (Fig. 8.12), the
shortest possible path SPE is that in which the angles SPM and EPMu are
equal. That no other path SPuE can be as short as SPE is apparent on
drawing SQSu perpendicular to MMu, with SQ5QSu and comparing the path
SPE with the path SPuE. Because paths SPE and SPuE are equal in length
to paths SuPE and SuPuE, respectively, and inasmuch as SuPE is a
straight line (because angle MuPE is equal to angle MPS), it follows
that SuPE is the shortest path.</p>
<p>Heron is remembered in the history of science and technology as the
inventor of a primitive type of steam engine, described in his
Pneumatics; of a forerunner of the thermometer; and of various toys and
mechanical contrivances based on the properties of fluids and on the
laws of the</p>
<p>FIG. 8.12</p>
<p>Nic omac hus of Gera s a</p>
<p>simple machines. He suggested in the Mechanics a law (clever but
incorrect) of the simple machine whose principle had eluded even
Archimedes—the inclined plane. His name is also attached to “Heron’s
algorithm” for finding square roots, but this method of iteration was in
reality due to the Babylonians of 2,000 years before his day. Although
Heron evidently learned much of Mesopotamian mathematics, he seems not
to have appreciated the importance of the positional principle for
fractions. Sexagesimal fractions had become the standard tool of
scholars in astronomy and physics, but it is likely that they remained
unfamiliar to the common man. Common fractions were used to some extent
by the Greeks, at first with the numerator placed below the denominator
and later with the positions reversed (and without the bar separating
the two), but Heron, writing for the practical man, seems to have
preferred unit fractions. In dividing 25 by 13, he wrote the answer as
11111. The old Egyptian addiction to unit fractions continued in Europe
for at least a thousand years after the time of Heron.</p>
