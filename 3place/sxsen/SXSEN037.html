<h4 id="incommensurability">Incommensurability</h4>
<p>It had been a fundamental tenet of Pythagoreanism that the essence of
all things, in geometry as well as in the practical and theoretical
affairs of man, is explainable in terms of arithmos, or intrinsic
properties of whole numbers or their ratios. The dialogues of Plato
show, however, that the Greek mathematical community had been stunned by
a disclosure that virtually demolished the basis for the Pythagorean
faith in whole numbers. This was the discovery that within geometry
itself, the whole numbers and their ratios are inadequate to account for
even simple fundamental properties. They do not suffice, for example, to
compare the diagonal of a square or a cube or a pentagon with its side.
The line segments are incommensurable, no matter how small a unit of
measure is chosen.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the earliest recognition of
incommensurable line segments are as uncertain as is the time of the
discovery. Ordinarily, it is assumed that the recognition came in
connection with the application of the Pythagorean theorem to the
isosceles right triangle. Aristotle referred to a proof of the
incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with respect to a side,
indicating that it was based on the distinction between odd and even.
Such a proof is easy to construct. Let d and s be the diagonal and the
side of a square, and assume that they are commensurable—that is, that
the ratio d/s is rational and equal to p/q, where p and q
areintegerswithnocommonfactor.Now,fromthePythagoreantheoremit is known
that d2 5s2 1s2; hence, (d/s)2 5p2 /q2 52, or p2 52q2. Therefore, p2
mustbe even; hence,p mustbe even.Consequently,q mustbe odd. Lettingp52r
andsubstituting in the equation p2 52q2,we have 4r2 52q2, or q2 52r2.
Then q2 must be even; hence, q must be even. Yet q was previously shown
to be odd, and an integer cannot be both odd and even. It follows,
therefore, by the indirect method, that the assumption that d and s are
commensurable must be false.</p>
<p>In this proof, the degree of abstraction is so high that the
possibility that it was the basis for the original discovery of
incommensurability has been questioned. There are, however, other ways
in which the discovery could have come about. Among these is the simple
observation that when the five diagonals of a regular pentagon are
drawn, these diagonals form a smaller regular pentagon (Fig. 4.10), and
the diagonals of the second pentagon in turn form a third regular
pentagon, which is still smaller. This process can be continued
indefinitely, resulting in pentagons that are as small as desired and
leading to the conclusion that the ratio of a diagonal to a side in a
regular pentagon is not rational. The irrationality of this ratio is, in
fact, a consequence of the argument presented in connection with Fig.
4.2, in which the golden section was shown to repeat itself over and
over again. Was it perhaps this property that led to the disclosure,
possibly by Hippasus, of incommensurability? There is no surviving
document to resolve the question, but the suggestion is at least a
plausible one. In this case, it would notp p have been 2 but 5 that
first disclosed the existence of incommensurable magnitudes, for the
solution of the equation a:x5x:(a2x) leads to ðp521Þ=2 as the ratio of
the side of a regular pentagon to a diagonal.p The ratio of the diagonal
of a cube to an edge is 3, and here, too, the specter of the
incommensurable rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Para do x e s of Z eno</p>
<p>FIG. 4.10 FIG. 4.11</p>
<p>A geometric proof somewhat analogous to that for the ratio of the
diagonal of a pentagon to its side can also be provided for the ratio of
the diagonal of a square to its side. If in the square ABCD (Fig. 4.11)
one lays off on the diagonal AC the segment AP5AB and at P erects the
perpendicular PQ, the ratio of CQ to PC will be the same as the ratio of
AC to AB. Again, if on CQ one lays off QR5QP and constructs RS
perpendicular to CR, the ratio of hypotenuse to side again will be what
it was before. This process, too, can be continued indefinitely, thus
affording a proof that no unit of length, however small, can be found so
that the hypotenuse and a side will be commensurable.</p>
