<h4 id="numbers-and-fractions">Numbers and Fractions</h4>
<p>Once Champollion and his contemporaries could decipher inscriptions
on tombs and monuments, Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration was easily
disclosed. The system, at least as old as the pyramids, dating some
5,000 years ago, was based on the 10 scale. By the use of a simple
iterative scheme and of distinctive symbols for each ofthefirst
half-dozen powers of 10, numbers greater than a million were carved on
stone, wood, and other materials. A single vertical stroke represented a
unit, an inverted wicket was used for 10,a
snaresomewhatresemblingacapitalCstoodfor 100,a lotusflowerfor 1,000, a
bent finger for 10,000, a tadpole for 100,000, and a kneeling figure,
apparently Heh, the god of the Unending, for 1,000,000. Through
repetition of these symbols, the number 12,345, for example, would
appear as</p>
<p>Sometimes the smaller digits were placed on the left, and other times
the digits were arranged vertically. The symbols themselves were
occasionally reversed in orientation, so that the snare might be convex
toward either the right or the left.</p>
<p>Egyptian inscriptions indicate familiarity with large numbers at an
early date. A museum at Oxford has a royal mace more than 5,000 years
old, on which a record of 120,000 prisoners and 1,422,000 captive goats
appears. These figures may have been exaggerated, but from other
considerations it is clear that the Egyptians were commendably accurate
in counting and measuring. The construction of the Egyptian solar
calendar is an outstanding early example of observation, measurement,
and counting. The pyramids are another famous instance; they exhibit
such a high degree of precision in construction and orientation that
ill-founded legends have grown up around them.</p>
<p>The more cursive hieratic script used by Ahmes was suitably adapted
to the use of pen and ink on prepared papyrus leaves. Numeration
remained decimal, but the tedious repetitive principle of hieroglyphic
numeration was replaced by the introduction of ciphers or special signs
to represent digits and multiples of powers of 10. The number 4, for
example, usually was no longer represented by four vertical strokes
but</p>
<p>Numb er s and F rac t ions</p>
<p>by a horizontal bar, and 7 is not written as seven strokes but as a
single cipher resembling a sickle. The hieroglyphic form for the number
28 was ; the hieratic form was simply . Note that the cipher for the
smaller digit 8 (or two 4s) appears on the left, rather than on the
right. The principle of cipherization, introduced by the Egyptians some
4,000 years ago and used in the Ahmes Papyrus, represented an important
contribution to numeration, and it is one of the factors that makes our
own system in use today the effective instrument that it is.</p>
<p>Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions have a special notation for unit
fractions—that is, fractions with unit numerators. The reciprocal of any
integer was indicated simply by placing over the notation for the
integer an elongated oval sign. The fraction thus appeared as and was
written as . In the hieratic notation, appearing in papyri, the
elongated oval is replaced by a dot, which is placed over the cipher for
the corresponding integer (or over the right-hand cipher in the case of
the reciprocal of a multidigit number). In the Ahmes Papyrus, for
example, the fraction appears as , and is written as . Such unit
fractions were freely handled in Ahmes’s day, but the general fraction
seems to have been an enigma to the Egyptians. They felt comfortable
with the fraction , forwhichtheyhadaspecial
hieraticsign;occasionally,theyused special signs for fractions of the
form n=ðn11Þ, the complements of the unit fractions. To the fraction ,
the Egyptians assigned a special role in arithmetic processes, so that
in finding one-third of a number, they first found two-thirds of it and
subsequently took half of the result! They knew and used the fact that
two-thirds of the unit fraction 1=p is the sum of the two unit fractions
1=2p and 1=6p; they were also aware that double the unit fraction 1=2p
is the unit fraction 1=p. Yet it looks as though, apart fromthe
fraction,theEgyptiansregardedthegeneralproperrationalfractionofthe form
m=n not as an elementary “thing” but as part of an uncompleted process.
Where today we think of as a single irreducible fraction, Egyptian
scribes thought of it as reducible to the sum of three unit fractions,
and and .</p>
<p>To facilitate the reduction of “mixed” proper fractions to the sum of
unit fractions, the Ahmes Papyrus opens with a table expressing 2=n as a
sum of unit fractions for all odd values of n from 5 to 101. The
equivalent of is given as and , is written as and , and is expressed as
and . The last item in the table decomposes into and and and . It is not
clear why one form of decomposition was preferred to another of the
indefinitely many that are possible. This last entry certainly
exemplifies the Egyptian prepossession for halving and taking a third;
it is not at all clear to us why the decomposition
2=n51=n11=2n11=3n11=2U3Un is better than 1=n11=n. Perhaps one of the
objects of the 2=n decomposition was to arrive at unit fractions smaller
than 1=n. Certain passages indicate that the Egyptians had some
appreciation of general rules and methods above and beyond the specific
case at hand, and this represents an important step in the development
of mathematics.</p>
