<h4 id="chapter-11-the-islamic-hegemony">Chapter 11 The Islamic
Hegemony</h4>
<p>Ah, but my Computations, People say, Have squared the Year to human
Compass, eh? If so, by striking from the Calendar Unborn To-morrow, and
dead Yesterday.</p>
<p>—Omar Khayyam (Rubaiyat in the FitzGerald version)</p>
<p>Arabic Conquests</p>
<p>One of the most transformative developments affecting mathematics in
the Middle Ages was the remarkable spread of Islam. Within one century
from 622 CE, the year of the prophet Mohammed’s Hegira, Islam had
expanded from Arabia to Persia, to North Africa, and to Spain.</p>
<p>At the time that Brahmagupta was writing, the Sabean Empire of Arabia
Felix had fallen, and the peninsula was in a severe crisis. It was
inhabited largely by desert nomads, known as Bedouins, who could neither
read nor write. Among them was the prophet Mohammed, born in Mecca in
about 570. During his journeys, Mohammed came in contact with Jews and
Christians, and the amalgam of religious feelings that were raised in
his mind led to the belief that he was the apostle of God sent to lead
his people. For some ten years, he preached at Mecca but in 622, faced
by a plot on his life, he accepted an invitation to Medina. This
“flight,” known as the Hegira, marked the beginning of the Mohammedan
era—one that was to exert a strong influence on the development of
mathematics. Mohammed now became a military, as well as a religious,
leader. Ten years later, he had established a Mohammedan state, with its
center at Mecca, within which Jews and Christians, being also
monotheistic, were afforded protection and freedom of worship. In 632,
while planning to move against the Byzantine Empire, Mohammed died in
Medina. His sudden death in no way impeded the expansion of the Islamic
state, for his followers overran neighboring territories with
astonishing rapidity. Within a few years, Damascus and Jerusalem and
much of the Mesopotamian Valley fell to the conquerors; by 641,
Alexandria, which for many years had been the mathematical center of the
world, was captured. As happens so often in these conquests, the books
in the library were burned. The extent of the damage done at that time
is unclear; it has been assumed that following depredations by earlier
military and religious fanatics and long ages of sheer neglect, there
may have been relatively few books left to fuel the flames in the
library that had once been the greatest in the world.</p>
<p>For more than a century, the Arab conquerors fought among themselves
and with their enemies, until by about 750 the warlike spirit subsided.
By this time, a schism had arisen between the western Arabs in Morocco
and the eastern Arabs, who, under the caliph al-Mansur, had established
a new capital at Baghdad, a city that was shortly to become the new
center for mathematics. Yet the caliph at Baghdad could not even command
the allegiance of all Moslems in the eastern half of his empire,
although his name appeared on coins of the realm and was included in the
prayers of his “subjects.” The unity of the Arab world, in other words,
was more economic and religious than it was political. Arabic was not
necessarily the common language, although it was a kind of lingua franca
for intellectuals. Hence, it may be more appropriate to speak of the
culture as Islamic, rather than Arabic, although we shall use the terms
more or less interchangeably.</p>
<p>During the first century of the Arabic conquests, there had been
political and intellectual confusion, and possibly this accounts for the
difficulty in localizing the origin of the modern system of numeration.
The Arabs were at first without known intellectual interest, and they
had little culture, beyond a language, to impose on the peoples they
conquered. In this respect, we see a repetition of the situation when
Rome conquered Greece, of which it was said that in a cultural sense,
captive Greece took captive the captor Rome. By about 750 CE, the Arabs
were ready to have history repeat itself, for the conquerors became
eager to absorb the learning of the civilizations they had overrun. We
learn that by the 770s, an astronomical-mathematical work known to the
Arabs as the Sindhind was brought to Baghdad from India. A few years
later, perhaps about 775, this Siddhanta was translated into Arabic, and
it was not long afterward (ca. 780) that Ptolemy’s astrological
Tetrabiblos was translated into Arabic from the Greek. Alchemy and
astrology were among the first studies to appeal to the dawning
intellectual interests of the conquerors. The “Arabic miracle” lies not
so much in the rapidity with which the political empire rose, as in the
alacrity with which, their tastes once aroused, the Arabs absorbed the
learning of their neighbors.</p>
<p>The House of Wisdom</p>
<p>The first century of the Muslim Empire had been devoid of scientific
achievement. This period (from about 650 to 750) had been, in fact,
perhaps the nadir in the development of mathematics, for the Arabs had
not yet achieved intellectual drive, and concern for learning in other
parts of the world had pretty much faded. Had it not been for the sudden
cultural awakening in Islam during the second half of the eighth
century, considerably more of ancient science and mathematics would have
been lost. To Baghdad at that time were called scholars from Syria,
Iran, and Mesopotamia, including Jews and Nestorian Christians; under
three great Abbasid patrons of learning—al-Mansur, Haroun al-Raschid,
and al-Mamun—the city became a new Alexandria. During the reign of the
second of these caliphs, familiar to us today through the Arabian
Nights, part of Euclid was translated. It was during the caliphate of
al-Mamun (809–833), however, that the Arabs fully indulged their passion
for translation. The caliph is said to have had a dream in which
Aristotle appeared, and as a consequence al-Mamun determined to have
Arabic versions made of all of the Greek works he could lay his hands
on, including Ptolemy’s Almagest and a complete version of Euclid’s
Elements. From the Byzantine Empire, with which the Arabs maintained an
uneasy peace, Greek manuscripts were obtained through treaties.</p>
<p>Al-Mamun established in Baghdad a “House of Wisdom” (Bait al-hikma)
comparable to the ancient Museum in Alexandria. Major emphasis from its
beginning was placed on translations, initially from Persian to Arabic,
later from Sanskrit and Greek. Gradually, the House of Wisdom included a
collection of ancient manuscripts, obtained largely from Byzantine
sources. Finally, an observatory was added to the institutional
holdings. Among the mathematicians and astronomers there, we note
Mohammed ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, whose name, like that of Euclid, was
later to become a household word in Western Europe. Others active in the
ninth century of translation were the brothers Banu Musa, al Kindi, and
Thabit ibn Qurra. By the thirteenth century, during the Mongol invasion
of Baghdad, the library of the House of Wisdom was destroyed; this time,
we are told, books were not burned but thrown into the river, which was
equally effective because water quickly washed out the ink.</p>
<p>Al-Khwarizmi</p>
<p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (ca. 780–ca. 850) wrote more than half
a dozen astronomical and mathematical works, of which the earliest were
probably based on the Sindhind. Besides astronomical tables and
treatises on the astrolabe and the sundial, al-Khwarizmi wrote two books
on arithmetic and algebra that played very important roles in the
history of mathematics. One of these survives only in a unique copy of a
Latin translation with the title De numero indorum, the original Arabic
version having since been lost. In this work, based presumably on an
Arabic translation of Brahmagupta, al-Khwarizmi gave so full an account
of the Hindu numerals that he is probably responsible for the widespread
but false impression that our system of numeration is Arabic in origin.
Al-Khwarizmi made no claim to originality in connection with the system,
the Hindu source of which he assumed as a matter of course, but when
Latin translations of his work subsequently appeared in Europe, cursory
readers began to attribute not only the book but also the numeration to
the author. The new notation came to be known as that of al-Khwarizmi
or, more carelessly, algorismi; ultimately, the scheme of numeration
that made use of the Hindu numerals came to be called simply “algorism”
or “algorithm,” a word that, originally derived from the name
al-Khwarizmi, now means, more generally, any peculiar rule of procedure
or operation—such as the Euclidean method for finding the greatest
common divisor.</p>
<p>Al-Jabr</p>
<p>Through his arithmetic, al-Khwarizmi’s name has become a common
English word; through the title of his most important book, Hisob
al-jabr wa’l muqabalah, he has supplied us with an even more popular
household term. From this title has come the word “algebra,” for it is
from this book that Europe later learned the branch of mathematics
bearing this name. Neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made
use of syncopation or of negative numbers. Nevertheless, the Al-jabr
comes closer to the elementary algebra of today than do the works of
either Diophantus or Brahmagupta, for the book is not concerned with
difficult problems in indeterminate analysis but with a straightforward
and elementary exposition of the solution of equations, especially of
the second degree. The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from
premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization—respects in
which neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled. The Hindus were strong
in association and analogy, in intuition and an aesthetic and
imaginative flair, whereas the Arabs were more practical-minded and
down-to-earth in their approach to mathematics.</p>
<p>The Al-jabr has come down to us in two versions, Latin and Arabic,
but in the Latin translation, Liber algebrae et al mucabala, a
considerable portion of the Arabic draft is missing. The Latin, for
example, has no preface, perhaps because the author’s preface in Arabic
gave fulsome praise to Mohammed, the prophet, and to al-Mamun, “the
Commander of the Faithful.” Al-Khwarizmi wrote that the latter had
encouraged him to</p>
<p>compose a short work on Calculating by (the rules of) Completion and
Reduction, confining it to what is easiest and most useful in
arithmetic, such as men constantly require in cases of inheritance,
legacies, partitions, lawsuits, and trade, and in all their dealings
with one another, or where the measuring of lands, the digging of
canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of various sorts and
kinds are concerned (Karpinski 1915, p. 96).</p>
<p>It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but
the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the previous
translation. The word “al-jabr” presumably meant something like
“restoration” or “completion” and seems to refer to the transposition of
subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word “muqabalah”
is said to refer to “reduction” or “balancing”—that is, the cancellation
of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. Arabic influence in
Spain long after the time of al-Khwarizmi is found in Don Quixote, where
the word “algebrista” is used for a bone-setter, that is, a
“restorer.”</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra opens with a brief
introductory statement of the positional principle for numbers and then
proceeds to the solution, in six short chapters, of the six types of
equations made up of the three kinds of quantities: roots, squares, and
numbers (i.e., x, x2, and numbers). Chapter I, in three short
paragraphs, covers the case of squares equal to roots, expressed in
modern notation as x2 = 5x, x2/3 = 4x, and 5x2 = 10x, giving the answers
x = 5, x = 12, and x = 2, respectively. (The root x = 0 was not
recognized.) Chapter II covers the case of squares equal to numbers, and
Chapter III solves the case of roots equal to numbers, again with three
illustrations per chapter to cover the cases in which the coefficient of
the variable term is equal to, more than, or less than 1. Chapters IV,
V, and VI are more interesting, for they cover in turn the three
classical cases of three-term quadratic equations: (1) squares and roots
equal to numbers, (2) squares and numbers equal to roots, and (3) roots
and numbers equal to squares. The solutions are “cookbook” rules for
“completing the square” applied to specific instances. Chapter IV, for
example, includes the three illustrations x2 + 10x = 39, 2x2 + 10x = 48,
and . In each case, only the positive answer is given. In Chapter V,
only a single example, x2 + 21 = 10x, is used, but both roots, 3 and 7,
are given, corresponding to the rule . Al-Khwarizmi here calls attention
to the fact that what we designate as the discriminant must be
positive:</p>
<p>You ought to understand also that when you take the half of the roots
in this form of equation and then multiply the half by itself; if that
which proceeds or results from the multiplication is less than the units
above-mentioned as accompanying the square, you have an equation.</p>
<p>In Chapter VI, the author again uses only a single example, 3x + 4 =
x2, for whenever the coefficient of x2 is not unity, the author reminds
us to divide first by this coefficient (as in Chapter IV). Once more,
the steps in completing the square are meticulously indicated, without
justification, the procedure being equivalent to the solution . Again,
only one root is given, for the other is negative.</p>
<p>The six cases of equations given previously exhaust all possibilities
for linear and quadratic equations having a positive root. The
arbitrariness of the rules and the strictly numerical form of the six
chapters remind us of ancient Babylonian and medieval Indian
mathematics. The exclusion of indeterminate analysis, a favorite Hindu
topic, and the avoidance of any syncopation, such as is found in
Brahmagupta, might suggest Mesopotamia as more likely a source than
India. As we read beyond the sixth chapter, however, an entirely new
light is thrown on the question. Al-Khwarizmi continues:</p>
<p>We have said enough so far as numbers are concerned, about the six
types of equations. Now, however, it is necessary that we should
demonstrate geometrically the truth of the same problems which we have
explained in numbers.</p>
<p>The ring in this passage is obviously Greek, rather than Babylonian
or Indian. There are thus three main schools of thought on the origin of
Arabic algebra: one emphasizes Hindu influences; another stresses the
Mesopotamian, or Syriac-Persian, tradition; and the third points to
Greek inspiration. The truth is probably approached if we combine the
three theories. The philosophers of Islam admired Aristotle to the point
of aping him, but eclectic Mohammedan mathematicians seem to have chosen
appropriate elements from various sources.</p>
<p>Geometric Foundation</p>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi betrays unmistakable Hellenic elements,
but the first geometric demonstrations have little in common with
classical Greek mathematics. For the equation x2 + 10x = 39,
al-Khwarizmi drew a square, ab, to represent x2, and on the four sides
of this square he placed rectangles c, d, e, and f, each units wide. To
complete the larger square, one must add the four small corner squares
(dotted in Fig. 11.1), each of which has an area of units. Hence, to
“complete the square” we add 4 times units, or 25 units, thus obtaining
a square of total area 39 + 25 = 64 units (as is clear from the
right-hand side of the given equation). The side of the large square
must therefore be 8 units, from which we subtract 2 times , or 5, units
to find that x = 3, thus proving that the answer found in Chapter IV is
correct.</p>
<p>FIG. 11.1</p>
<p>The geometric proofs for Chapters V and VI are somewhat more
involved. For the equation x2 + 21 = 10x, the author draws the square ab
to represent x2 and the rectangle bg to represent 21 units. Then the
large rectangle, comprising the square and the rectangle bg, must have
an area equal to 10x, so that the side ag or hd must be 10 units. If,
then, one bisects hd at e, draws et perpendicular to hd, extends te to c
so that tc = tg, and completes the squares tclg and cmne (Fig. 11.2),
the area tb is equal to the area md. But the square tl is 25, and the
gnomon tenmlg is 21 (because the gnomon is equal to the rectangle bg).
Hence, the square nc is 4, and its side ec is 2. Inasmuch as ec = be,
and because he = 5, we see that x = hb = 5 − 2 or 3, which proves that
the arithmetic solution given in Chapter V is correct. A modified
diagram is given for the root x = 5 + 2 = 7, and an analogous type of
figure is used to justify geometrically the result found algebraically
in Chapter VI.</p>
<p>FIG. 11.2</p>
<p>Algebraic Problems</p>
<p>A comparison of Fig. 11.2, taken from al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, with
diagrams found in the Elements of Euclid in connection with Greek
geometric algebra leads to the inevitable conclusion that Arabic algebra
had much in common with Greek geometry; however, the first, or
arithmetic, part of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra is obviously alien to Greek
thought. What apparently happened in Baghdad was just what one would
expect in a cosmopolitan intellectual center. Arabic scholars had great
admiration for Greek astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and
philosophy—subjects that they mastered as best they could. Yet, they
could scarcely help but notice the same thing that the Nestorian bishop
Sebokt had observed when in 662 he first called attention to the nine
marvelous digits of the Hindus: “There are also others who know
something.” It is probable that al-Khwarizmi typified the Arabic
eclecticism that will so frequently be observed in other cases. His
system of numeration most likely came from India, his systematic
algebraic solution of equations may have been a development from
Mesopotamia, and the logical geometric framework for his solutions was
palpably derived from Greece.</p>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi contains more than the solution of
equations, material that occupies about the first half. There are, for
example, rules for operations on binomial expressions, including
products such as (10 + 2)(10 − 1) and (10 + x)(10 − x). Although the
Arabs rejected negative roots and absolute negative magnitudes, they
were familiar with the rules governing what are now known as signed
numbers. There are also alternative geometric proofs of some of the
author’s six cases of equations. Finally, the Algebra includes a wide
variety of problems illustrating the six chapters or cases. As an
illustration of the fifth chapter, for example, al-Khwarizmi asks for
the division of 10 into two parts in such a way that “the sum of the
products obtained by multiplying each part by itself is equal to fifty
eight.” The extant Arabic version, unlike the Latin, also includes an
extended discussion of inheritance problems, such as the following:</p>
<p>A man dies, leaving two sons behind him, and bequeathing one-third of
his capital to a stranger. He leaves ten dirhems of property and a claim
of ten dirhems upon one of the sons.</p>
<p>The answer is not what one would expect, for the stranger gets only 5
dirhems. According to Arabic law, a son who owes to the estate of his
father an amount greater than the son’s portion of the estate retains
the whole sum that he owes, one part being regarded as his share of the
estate and the remainder as a gift from his father. To some extent, it
seems to have been the complicated nature of laws governing inheritance
that encouraged the study of algebra in Arabia.</p>
<p>A Problem from Heron</p>
<p>A few of al-Khwarizmi’s problems give rather clear evidence of Arabic
dependence on the Babylonian-Heronian stream of mathematics. One of them
presumably was taken directly from Heron, for the figure and the
dimensions are the same. Within an isosceles triangle having sides of 10
yards and a base of 12 yards (Fig. 11.3), a square is to be inscribed,
and the side of this square is called for. The author of the Algebra
first finds through the Pythagorean theorem that the altitude of the
triangle is 8 yards, so that the area of the triangle is 48 square
yards. Calling the side of the square the “thing,” he notes that the
square of the “thing” will be found by taking from the area of the large
triangle the areas of the three small triangles lying outside the square
but inside the large triangle. The sum of the areas of the two lower
small triangles he knows to be the product of the “thing” by 6 less half
of the “thing,” and the area of the upper small triangle is the product
of 8 less the “thing” by half of the “thing.” Hence, he is led to the
obvious conclusion that the “thing” is yards—the side of the square. The
chief difference between the form of this problem in Heron and that of
al-Khwarizmi is that Heron had expressed the answer in terms of unit
fractions as . The similarities are so much more pronounced than the
differences that we may take this case as confirmation of the general
axiom that continuity in the history of mathematics is the rule, rather
than the exception. Where a discontinuity seems to arise, we should
first consider the possibility that the apparent saltus may be explained
by the loss of intervening documents.</p>
<p>FIG. 11.3</p>
<p>’Abd Al-Hamid ibn-Turk</p>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi is usually regarded as the first work on
the subject, but a publication in Turkey raises some question about
this. A manuscript of a work by ’Abd-al-Hamid ibn-Turk, titled “Logical
Necessities in Mixed Equations,” was part of a book on Al-jabr wa’l
muqabalah, which was evidently very much the same as that by
al-Khwarizmi and was published at about the same time—possibly even
earlier. The surviving chapters on “Logical Necessities” give precisely
the same type of geometric demonstration as al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra and
in one case the same illustrative example, x2 + 21 = 10x. In one
respect, ’Abd al-Hamid’s exposition is more thorough than that of
al-Khwarizmi for he gives geometric figures to prove that if the
discriminant is negative, a quadratic equation has no solution.
Similarities in the work of the two men and the systematic organization
found in them seem to indicate that algebra in their day was not so
recent a development as has usually been assumed. When textbooks with a
conventional and well-ordered exposition appear simultaneously, a
subject is likely to be considerably beyond the formative stage.
Successors of al-Khwarizmi were able to say, once a problem had been
reduced to the form of an equation, “Operate according to the rules of
algebra and almucabala.” In any case, the survival of al-Khwarizmi’s
Algebra can be taken to indicate that it was one of the better textbooks
typical of Arabic algebra of the time. It was to algebra what Euclid’s
Elements was to geometry—the best elementary exposition available until
modern times—but al-Khwarizmi’s work had a serious deficiency that had
to be removed before it could effectively serve its purpose in the
modern world: a symbolic notation had to be developed to replace the
rhetorical form. This step the Arabs never took, except for the
replacement of number words by number signs.</p>
<p>Thabit ibn-Qurra</p>
<p>The ninth century was a glorious one in mathematical transmission and
discovery. It produced not only al-Khwarizmi in the first half of the
century, but also Thabit ibn-Qurra (826–901) in the second half. Thabit,
a Sabean, was born in Harran, the ancient Mesopotamian city that is
located in present-day southeastern Turkey and once lay along one of the
notable trade routes of the region. Thabit, trilingual since his youth,
came to the attention of one of the Musa brothers, who encouraged him to
come to Baghdad to study with his brothers in the House of Wisdom.
Thabit became proficient in medicine, as well as in mathematics and
astronomy, and, when appointed court astronomer by the caliph of
Baghdad, established a tradition of translations, especially from Greek
and Syriac. To him we owe an immense debt for translations into Arabic
of works by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius. Had
it not been for Thabit’s efforts, the number of Greek mathematical works
extant today would be smaller. For example, we should have only the
first four, rather than the first seven, books of Apollonius’s
Conics.</p>
<p>Moreover, Thabit had so thoroughly mastered the content of the
classics he translated that he suggested modifications and
generalizations. To him is due a remarkable formula for amicable
numbers: if p, q, and r are prime numbers, and if they are of the form p
= 3 · 2n − 1, q = 3 · 2n−1 − 1, and r = 9 · 22n−1 − 1, then 2npq and 2nr
are amicable numbers, for each is equal to the sum of the proper
divisors of the other. Like Pappus, Thabit also gave a generalization of
the Pythagorean theorem that is applicable to all triangles, whether
right or scalene. If from vertex A of any triangle ABC one draws lines
intersecting BC in points B′ and C′ such that angles AB′B and AC′C are
each equal to angle A (Fig. 11.4), then Thabit gave no proof of the
theorem, but this is easily supplied through theorems on similar
triangles. In fact, the theorem provides a beautiful generalization of
the pinwheel diagram used by Euclid in the proof of the Pythagorean
theorem. If, for example, angle A is obtuse, then the square on side AB
is equal to the rectangle BB′B″B′″, and the square on AC is equal to the
rectangle CC″ C′ C′″, here BB″ = CC″ = BC = B″C″. That is, the sum of
the squares on AB and AC is the square on BC less the rectangle
B′C′B′″C′″. If angle A is acute, then the positions of B′ and C′ are
reversed with respect to AP, where P is the projection of A on BC, and
in this case, the sum of the squares on AB and AC is equal to the square
on BC increased by the rectangle B′C′B′″C′″. If A is a right angle, then
B′ and C′ coincide with P, and for this case, Thabit’s theorem becomes
the Pythagorean theorem. (Thabit did not draw the dotted lines that are
shown in Fig. 11.4, but he did consider the several cases.)</p>
<p>FIG. 11.4</p>
<p>Alternative proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, works on parabolic and
paraboloidal segments, a discussion of magic squares, angle trisections,
and new astronomical theories are among Thabit’s further contributions
to scholarship. Thabit boldly added a ninth sphere to the eight
previously assumed in simplified versions of Aristotelian-Ptolemaic
astronomy, and instead of the Hipparchan precession of the equinoxes in
one direction or sense only, Thabit proposed a “trepidation of the
equinoxes” in a reciprocating type of motion.</p>
<p>Numerals</p>
<p>Within the confines of the Arabic empire lived peoples of very varied
ethnic backgrounds: Syrian, Greek, Egyptian, Persian, Turkish, and many
others. Most of them shared a common faith, Islam, although Christians
and Jews were tolerated; very many shared a common language, Arabic,
although Greek and Hebrew were sometimes used. There was considerable
factionalism at all times, and it sometimes erupted into conflict.
Thabit himself had grown up in a pro-Greek community, which opposed him
for his pro-Arabic sympathies. Cultural differences occasionally became
quite apparent, as in the works of the tenth- and eleventh-century
scholars Abu’l-Wefa (940–998) and al-Karkhi (or al-Karagi, ca. 1029). In
some of their works, they used the Hindu numerals, which had reached
Arabia through the astronomical Sindhind; at other times, they adopted
the Greek alphabetic pattern of numeration (with, of course, Arabic
equivalents for the Greek letters). Ultimately, the superior Hindu
numerals won out, but even within the circle of those who used the
Indian numeration, the forms of the numerals differed considerably.
Variations had obviously been prevalent in India, but in Arabia variants
were so striking that there are theories suggesting entirely different
origins for forms used in the eastern and western halves of the Arabic
world. Perhaps the numerals of the Saracens in the east came directly
from India, while the numerals of the Moors in the west were derived
from Greek or Roman forms. More likely, the variants were the result of
gradual changes taking place in space and time, for the Arabic numerals
of today are strikingly different from the modern Devanagari (or
“divine”) numerals still in use in India. After all, it is the
principles within the system of numeration that are important, rather
than the specific forms of the numerals. Our numerals are often known as
Arabic, despite the fact that they bear little resemblance to those now
in use in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Arabia, Iran, and other lands within the
Islamic culture—that is, the forms We call our numerals Arabic because
the principles in the two systems are the same and because our forms may
have been derived from the Arabic. Yet the principles behind the Arabic
numerals presumably were derived from India; hence, it is better to call
ours the Hindu or the Hindu-Arabic system (see the illustration
above).</p>
<p>Genealogy of our digits. Following Karl Menninger, Zahlwort und
Ziffer (Göttingen: Vanderhoeck andandandand Ruprecht 1957–1958, 2
vols.), Vol. II, p. 233</p>
<p>Trigonometry</p>
<p>As in numeration, there was competition between systems of Greek and
Indian origin, so also in astronomical calculations there were at first
in Arabia two types of trigonometry—the Greek geometry of chords, as
found in the Almagest, and the Hindu tables of sines, as derived through
the Sindhind. Here, too, the conflict resulted in triumph for the Hindu
aspect, and most Arabic trigonometry was ultimately built on the sine
function. It was, in fact, again through the Arabs, rather than directly
from the Hindus, that this trigonometry of the sine reached Europe.</p>
<p>Sometimes attempts are made to attribute the functions tangent,
cotangent, secant, and cosecant to specific times and even to specific
individuals, but this cannot be done with any assurance. In India and
Arabia, there had been a general theory of shadow lengths, as related to
a unit of length or gnomon, for varying solar altitudes. There was no
one standard unit of length for the staff or the gnomon used, although a
hand span or a man’s height was frequently adopted. The horizontal
shadow, for a vertical gnomon of given length, was what we call the
cotangent of the angle of elevation of the sun. The “reverse
shadow”—that is, the shadow cast on a vertical wall by a stick or a
gnomon projecting horizontally from the wall—was what we know as the
tangent of the solar elevation. The “hypotenuse of the shadow”—that is,
the distance from the tip of the gnomon to the tip of the shadow—was the
equivalent of the cosecant function, and the “hypotenuse of the reverse
shadow” played the role of our secant. This shadow tradition seems to
have been well established in Asia by the time of Thabit ibn-Qurra, but
values of the hypotenuse (secant or cosecant) were seldom tabulated.</p>
<p>Tenth- and Eleventh-Century Highlights</p>
<p>With Abu’l-Wefa, trigonometry assumes a more systematic form in which
such theorems as double and half-angle formulas are proved. Although the
Hindu sine function had displaced the Greek chord, it was nevertheless
the Almagest of Ptolemy that motivated the logical arrangement of
trigonometric results. The law of sines had been known to Ptolemy in
essence and is implied in the work of Brahmagupta, but it is frequently
attributed to Abu’l-Wefa and his contemporary Abu Nasr Mensur because of
their clear-cut formulation of the law for spherical triangles.
Abu’l-Wefa also made up a new sine table for angles differing by , using
the equivalent of eight decimal places. In addition, he contributed a
table of tangents and made use of all six of the common trigonometric
functions, together with relations among them, but his use of the new
functions seems not to have been widely followed in the medieval
period.</p>
<p>Abu’l-Wefa was a capable algebraist, as well as a trigonometer. He
commented on al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra and translated from the Greek one of
the last great classics—the Arithmetica of Diophantus. His successor
al-Karkhi evidently used this translation to become an Arabic disciple
of Diophantus—but without Diophantine analysis! That is, al-Karkhi was
concerned with the algebra of al-Khwarizmi, rather than with the
indeterminate analysis of the Hindus, but like Diophantus (and unlike
al-Khwarizmi), he did not limit himself to quadratic equations—despite
the fact that he followed the Arabic custom of giving geometric proofs
for quadratics. In particular, to al-Karkhi is attributed the first
numerical solution of equations of the form ax2n + bxn = c (only
equations with positive roots were considered), where the Diophantine
restriction to rational numbers was abandoned. It was in just this
direction, toward the algebraic solution (in terms of radicals) of
equations of more than the second degree, that the early developments in
mathematics in the Renaissance were destined to take place.</p>
<p>The time of al-Karkhi—the early eleventh century—was a brilliant era
in the history of Arabic learning, and a number of his contemporaries
deserve brief mention—brief not because they were less capable, but
because they were not primarily mathematicians.</p>
<p>Ibn-Sina (980–1037), better known to the West as Avicenna, was the
foremost scholar and scientist in Islam, but in his encyclopedic
interests, mathematics played a smaller role than medicine and
philosophy. He made a translation of Euclid and explained the
casting-out of nines (which consequently is sometimes unwarrantedly
attributed to him), but he is better remembered for his application of
mathematics to astronomy and physics.</p>
<p>As Avicenna reconciled Greek learning with Muslim thought, so his
contemporary al-Biruni (973–1048) made the Arabs—hence, us—familiar with
Hindu mathematics and culture through his well-known book titled India.
An indefatigable traveler and a critical thinker, he gave a sympathetic
but candid account, including full descriptions of the Siddhantas and
the positional principle of numeration. It is he who told us that
Archimedes was familiar with Heron’s formula and gave a proof of this
and of Brahmagupta’s formula, correctly insisting that the latter
applies only to a cyclic quadrilateral. In inscribing a nonagon in a
circle, al-Biruni reduced the problem, through the trigonometric formula
for cos3θ, to solving the equation x3 = 1 + 3x, and for this, he gave
the approximate solution in sexagesimal fractions as
1;52,15,17,13—equivalent to more than six-place accuracy. Al-Biruni also
gave us, in a chapter on gnomon lengths, an account of the Hindu shadow
reckoning. The boldness of his thought is illustrated by his discussion
of whether the earth rotates on its axis, a question to which he did not
give an answer. (Earlier, Aryabhata seems to have suggested a rotating
earth at the center of space.)</p>
<p>Al-Biruni also contributed to physics, especially through studies in
specific gravity and the causes of artesian wells, but as a physicist
and a mathematician he was excelled by ibn-al-Haitham (ca. 965–1039),
known to the West as Alhazen. The most important treatise written by
Alhazen was the Treasury of Optics, a book that was inspired by work of
Ptolemy on reflection and refraction and that in turn inspired
scientists of medieval and early modern Europe. Among the questions that
Alhazen considered were the structure of the eye, the apparent increase
in the size of the moon when near the horizon, and an estimate, from the
observation that twilight lasts until the sun is 19° below the horizon,
of the height of the atmosphere. The problem of finding the point on a
spherical mirror at which light from a source will be reflected to the
eye of an observer is known to this day as “Alhazen’s problem.” It is a
“solid problem” in the old Greek sense, solvable by conic sections, a
subject with which Alhazen was quite familiar. He extended Archimedes’
results on conoids by finding the volume generated by revolving about
the tangent at the vertex the area bounded by a parabolic arc and the
axis and an ordinate of the parabola.</p>
<p>Omar Khayyam</p>
<p>Arabic mathematics can with some propriety be divided into four
parts: (1) an arithmetic presumably derived from India and based on the
principle of position; (2) an algebra that, although from Greek, Hindu,
and Babylonian sources, nevertheless in Muslim hands assumed a
characteristically new and systematic form; (3) a trigonometry the
substance of which came chiefly from Greece but to which the Arabs
applied the Hindu form and added new functions and formulas; and (4) a
geometry that came from Greece but to which the Arabs contributed
generalizations here and there. There was a significant contribution
about a century after Alhazen by a man who in the East is known as a
scientist but whom the West recalls as one of the greatest Persian
poets. Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050–1123), the “tent-maker,” wrote an Algebra
that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of the third
degree. Like his Arabic predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided both
arithmetic and geometric solutions for quadratic equations; for general
cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later
showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence, he gave only
geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve
cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazen, but
Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to
cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). When in an
earlier work he came across a cubic equation, he specifically remarked,
“This cannot be solved by plane geometry [i.e., using straightedge and
compasses only] since it has a cube in it. For the solution we need
conic sections” (Amir-Moez 1963, p. 328).</p>
<p>For equations of a higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently
did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain
more than three dimensions, “what is called square-square by algebraists
in continuous magnitude is a theoretical fact. It does not exist in
reality in any way.” The procedure that Omar Khayyam so tortuously—and
so proudly—applied to cubic equations can be stated with far greater
succinctness in modern notation and concepts as follows. Let the cubic
be x3 + ax2 + b2x + c3 = 0. Then, if for x2 in this equation we
substitute 2py, we obtain (recalling that x3 = x2 · x) the result 2pxy +
2apy + b2x + c3 = 0. Because the resulting equation represents a
hyperbola, and the equality x2 = 2py used in the substitution represents
a parabola, it is clear that if the hyperbola and the parabola are
sketched on the same set of coordinate axes, then the abscissas of the
points of intersection of the two curves will be the roots of the cubic
equation. Obviously, many other pairs of conic sections can be used in a
similar way to solve the cubic.</p>
<p>Our exposition of Omar Khayyam’s work does not do justice to his
genius, for, lacking the concept of negative coefficients, he had to
break the problem into many separate cases according as the parameters
a, b, c are positive, negative, or zero. Moreover, he had to
specifically identify his conic sections for each case, for the concept
of a general parameter was not at hand in his day. Not all roots of a
given cubic equation were given, for he did not accept the
appropriateness of negative roots and did not note all intersections of
the conic sections. It should also be mentioned that in the earlier
Greek geometric solutions of cubic equations, the coefficients had been
line segments, whereas in the work of Omar Khayyam they were specific
numbers. One of the most fruitful contributions of Arabic eclecticism
was the tendency to close the gap between numerical and geometric
algebra. The decisive step in this direction came much later with
Descartes, but Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote,
“Whoever thinks algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it
in vain. No attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and
geometry are different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which
are proved.” In replacing Euclid’s theory of proportions with a
numerical approach, he came close to a definition of the irrational and
struggled with the concept of real number in general.</p>
<p>In his Algebra, Omar Khayyam wrote that elsewhere he had set forth a
rule that he had discovered for finding fourth, fifth, sixth, and higher
powers of a binomial, but such a work is not extant. It is presumed that
he was referring to the Pascal triangle arrangement, one that seems to
have appeared in China at about the same time. Such a coincidence is not
easy to explain, but until further evidence is available, independence
of discovery is to be assumed. Intercommunication between Arabia and
China was not extensive at that time, but there was a silk route
connecting China with Persia, and information might have trickled along
it.</p>
<p>The Parallel Postulate</p>
<p>Islamic mathematicians were clearly more attracted to algebra and
trigonometry than to geometry, but one aspect of geometry held a special
fascination for them—the proof of Euclid’s fifth postulate. Even among
the Greeks, the attempt to prove the postulate had become virtually a
“fourth famous problem of geometry,” and several Muslim mathematicians
continued the effort. Alhazen had begun with a trirectangular
quadrilateral (sometimes known as “Lambert’s quadrangle” in recognition
of efforts in the eighteenth century) and thought that he had proved
that the fourth angle must also be a right angle. From this “theorem” on
the quadrilateral, the fifth postulate can easily be shown to follow. In
his “proof,” Alhazen had assumed that the locus of a point that moves so
as to remain equidistant from a given line is necessarily a line
parallel to the given line—an assumption shown in modern times to be
equivalent to Euclid’s postulate. Omar Khayyam criticized Alhazen’s
proof on the ground that Aristotle had condemned the use of motion in
geometry. Omar Khayyam then began with a quadrilateral the two sides of
which are equal and are both perpendicular to the base (usually known as
a “Saccheri quadrilateral,” again in recognition of eighteenth-century
efforts), and he asked about the other (upper) angles of the
quadrilateral, which necessarily are equal to each other. There are, of
course, three possibilities. The angles may be (1) acute, (2) right, or
(3) obtuse. The first and third possibilities Omar Khayyam ruled out on
the basis of a principle, which he attributed to Aristotle, that two
converging lines must intersect—again, an assumption equivalent to
Euclid’s parallel postulate.</p>
<p>Nasir al-Din al-Tusi</p>
<p>When Omar Khayyam died in 1123, Islamic science was in a state of
decline, but Muslim contributions did not come to a sudden stop with his
death. Both in the thirteenth century and again in the fifteenth
century, we find an Islamic mathematician of note. At Maragha, for
example, Nasir al-Din (Eddin) al-Tusi (1201–1274), an astronomer to
Hulagu Khan, a grandson of the conqueror Genghis Khan and a brother of
Kublai Khan, continued efforts to prove the parallel postulate, starting
from the usual three hypotheses on a Saccheri quadrilateral. His “proof”
depends on the following hypothesis, again equivalent to Euclid’s:</p>
<p>If a line u is perpendicular to a line w at A, and if line v is
oblique to w at 3, then the perpendiculars drawn from u upon v are less
than AB on the side on which v makes an acute angle with w and greater
on the side on which v makes an obtuse angle with w.</p>
<p>The views of al-Tusi, the last in the sequence of three Arabic
precursors of non-Euclidean geometry, were translated and published by
John Wallis in the seventeenth century. It appears that this work was
the starting point for the developments by Saccheri in the first third
of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Continuing the work of Abu’l-Wefa, al-Tusi was responsible for the
first systematic treatise on plane and spherical trigonometry, treating
the material as an independent subject in its own right and not simply
as the handmaid of astronomy, as had been the case in Greece and India.
The six usual trigonometric functions are used, and rules for solving
the various cases of plane and spherical triangles are given.
Unfortunately, the work of al-Tusi had limited influence, inasmuch as it
did not become well known in Europe. In astronomy, however, al-Tusi made
a contribution that may have come to the attention of Copernicus. The
Arabs had adopted theories of both Aristotle and Ptolemy for the
heavens; noticing elements of conflict between the cosmologies, they
sought to reconcile and refine them. In this connection, al-Tusi
observed that a combination of two uniform circular motions in the usual
epicyclic construction can produce a reciprocating rectilinear motion.
That is, if a point moves with uniform circular motion clockwise around
the epicycle, while the center of the epicycle moves counterclockwise
with half of this speed along an equal deferent circle, the point will
describe a straight-line segment. (In other words, if a circle rolls
without slipping along the inside of a circle whose diameter is twice as
great, the locus of a point on the circumference of the smaller circle
will be a diameter of the larger circle.) This “theorem of Nasir Eddin”
became known to, or was rediscovered by, Nicholas Copernicus and Jerome
Cardan in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Al-Kashi</p>
<p>The mathematics of Islam continued to decline after al-Tusi, but our
account of the Muslim contribution would not be adequate without
reference to the work of a figure in the early fifteenth century.
Jamshid al-Kashi (ca. 1380–1429) found a patron in the prince Ulugh Beg,
who was a grandson of the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane. In Samarkand,
where he held his court, Ulugh Beg had built an observatory and
established a center of learning, and al-Kashi joined the group of
scientists gathered there. In numerous works, written in Persian and
Arabic, al-Kashi contributed to mathematics and astronomy. He also
produced a major textbook for the use of students in Samarkand, which
provided an introduction to arithmetic, algebra, and their applications
to architecture, surveying, commerce, and other interest areas. His
computational skills appear to have been unequalled. Noteworthy is the
accuracy of his computations, especially in connection with the solution
of equations by a special case of Horner’s method, derived perhaps from
the Chinese. From China, too, al-Kashi may have taken the practice of
using decimal fractions. Al-Kashi is an important figure in the history
of decimal fractions, and he realized the significance of his
contribution in this respect, regarding himself as the inventor of
decimal fractions. Although to some extent he had had precursors, he was
perhaps the first user of sexagesimal fractions to suggest that decimals
are just as convenient for problems requiring many-place accuracy.
Nevertheless, in his systematic computations of roots, he continued to
make use of sexagesimals. In illustrating his method for finding the nth
root of a number, he took the sixth root of the sexagesimal</p>
<p>34,59,1,7,14,54,23,3,47,37;40.</p>
<p>This was a prodigious feat of computation, using the steps that we
follow in Horner’s method—locating the root, diminishing the roots, and
stretching or multiplying the roots—and using a pattern similar to our
synthetic division.</p>
<p>Al-Kashi evidently delighted in long calculations, and he was
justifiably proud of his approximation of π, which was more accurate
than any of the values given by his predecessors. He expressed his value
of 2π in both sexagesimal and decimal forms. The
former—6;16,59,28,34,51,46,15,50—is more reminiscent of the past, and
the latter, 6.2831853071795865, in a sense presaged the future use of
decimal fractions. No mathematician approached the accuracy in this tour
de force of computation until the late sixteenth century. His
computational skills appear to have been at the basis of the table of
sines produced at the Samarkand observatory. In al-Kashi, the binomial
theorem in “Pascal triangle” form again appears, just about a century
after its publication in China and about a century before it was printed
in European books.</p>
<p>The number of significant Islamic contributors to mathematics before
al-Kashi was considerably larger than our exposition would suggest, for
we have concentrated only on major figures, but after al-Kashi the
number is negligible. It was very fortunate indeed that when Arabic
learning began to decline, scholarship in Europe was on the upgrade and
was prepared to accept the intellectual legacy bequeathed by earlier
ages.</p>
