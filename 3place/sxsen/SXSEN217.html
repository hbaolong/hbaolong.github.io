<h4 id="synthetic-metric-geometry-steiner">Synthetic Metric Geometry:
Steiner</h4>
<p>In many respects, Chasles’s results overlapped with those of several
German geometers. Foremost among them was Jakob Steiner, the man who has
been regarded as the greatest synthetic geometer of modern times. In his
hands, synthetic geometry made strides comparable to those made earlier
in analysis. He intensely disliked analytic methods. The term “analysis”
implies a certain amount of technique or machinery; analysis is often
referred to as a tool, a term never applied to synthesis. Steiner
objected to all kinds of tools or “props” in geometry. In a paper in
Crelle’s Journal, he demonstrated by synthetic methods alone a striking
theorem that naturally appears to belong to analysis: that a surface of
the third order contains only twenty-seven lines. Steiner also proved
that all Euclidean constructions can be performed with a straightedge
alone, provided that one is also given a single fixed circle. This
theorem shows that one cannot, in Euclidean geometry, dispense entirely
with the compasses, but that having used them to draw one circle, one
can thereafter discard them in favor of the straightedge alone.</p>
<p>Steiner’s name is recalled in many connections, including the
properties of the Steiner points: If one joins in all possible ways the
six points on a conic in Pascal’s mystic hexagon, one obtains sixty
Pascal lines that intersect three by three in twenty Steiner points.
Among Steiner’s unpublished discoveries are those relating to the
fruitful geometric transformation known as inversive geometry: If two
points P and Pu lie on a ray from the center O of a circle C of radius r
6¼ 0, and if the product of the distances OP and OPu is r2, then P and
Pu are said to be inverse to each other with respect to C. To every
point P outside the circle, there is a corresponding point inside the
circle. Inasmuch as there is no outside point Pu corresponding to P when
P coincides with the center O, one has in a sense a paradox similar to
that of Bolzano: The inside of every circle, no matter how small,
contains, as it were, one more point than the portion of the plane
outside the circle. In an exactly analogous manner, one readily defines
the inverse of a point in three-dimensional space with respect to a
sphere.</p>
<p>A host of theorems in plane or solid inversive geometry are readily
proved by either analytic or synthetic methods. In particular, it is
easy to show that a circle not passing through the center of inversion
is transformed under a plane inversion, into a circle, whereas a circle
through the center of inversion goes into a straight line not passing
through the center of inversion (with analogous results holding for
spheres and planes in three-dimensional inversive geometry). Somewhat
more difficult to establish is the more significant result that
inversion is a conformal transformation, that is, that angles between
curves are preserved in this geometry. That angle-preserving
transformations are far from usual is clear from a theorem proved by
Joseph Liouville that in space, the only ones that are conformal are
inversions and similarity and congruency transformations. Steiner did
not publish his ideas on inversion, and the transformation was
rediscovered several times by other mathematicians of the century,
including Lord Kelvin (or William Thomson, 1824 1907), who, in 1845,
arrived at it through physics and who applied it to problems in
electrostatics.</p>
<p>If the center O of the circle of inversion of radius a is at the
origin of a plane Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates xu and yu
of the inverse Pu of a point P(x, y) are given by the equations</p>
<p>a2x a2y x0 5 2 2 and y0 5 2</p>
<p>x 1y x 1y2</p>
<p>These equations later suggested to Luigi Cremona (1830 1903), a
professor of geometry successively at Bologna, Milan, and Rome, the
study ofthemuchmoregeneraltransformationxu 5R1(x,y),yu 5R2(x,y),whereR1
and R2 are rational algebraic functions. Such transformations, of which
those for inversion are only a special case, are now known as
Cremona</p>
<p>transformations, in honor of the man who, in 1863, published an
account of them and who later generalized them for three dimensions.</p>
