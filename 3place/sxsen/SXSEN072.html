<h4 id="ptolemys-almagest">Ptolemy’s Almagest</h4>
<p>By far the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all
antiquity was the Mathematical Syntaxis, a work in thirteen books
composed by Ptolemy of Alexandria about half a century after Menelaus.
This celebrated Mathematical Synthesis was distinguished from another
group of astronomical treatises by other authors (including Aristarchus)
by referring to that of Ptolemy as the “greater” collection and to that
of Aristarchus et al. as the “lesser” collection.</p>
<p>From the frequent reference to the former as megiste, there arose
later in Arabia the custom of calling Ptolemy’s book Almagest (“the
greatest”), and it is by this name that the work has since been
known.</p>
<p>Of the life of its author, we are as little informed as we are of
that of the author of the Elements. We know that Ptolemy made
observations in Alexandria from 127 to 151 CE, and we therefore assume
that he was born at the end of the first century. Suidas, a writer who
lived in the tenth century, reported that Ptolemy was still alive under
Marcus Aurelius (the emperor from 161 to 180 CE).</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Almagest is presumed to be heavily indebted for its methods
to the Chords in a Circle of Hipparchus. Ptolemy made use of the
catalogue of star positions bequeathed by Hipparchus, but whether
Ptolemy’s trigonometric tables were derived in large part from his
distinguished predecessor cannot be determined. Fortunately, Ptolemy’s
Almagest has survived the ravages of time; hence, we have not only his
trigonometric tables but also an account of the methods used in their
construction. Central to the calculation of Ptolemy’s chords was a
geometric proposition still known as “Ptolemy’s theorem”: If ABCD is a
(convex) quadrilateral inscribed in a circle (Fig. 8.7), then
ABCD1BCDA5ACBD; that is, the sum of the products of the opposite sides
of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the diagonals. The
proof of this is easily carried through by drawing BE so that angle ABE
is equal to angle DBC and noting the similarity of the triangles ABE and
BCD.</p>
<p>Another, and more useful, special case of the general theorem of
Ptolemy is that in which one side—say, AD—is a diameter of the circle
(Fig. 8.8). Then, if AD52r, we have 2rBC1ABCD5ACBD. If we let arcBD52α
and arc CD52β, then BC52r sin(α2β), AB52r sin(90 2α), BD52rsinα,
CD52rsinβ, and AC52rsin(90 2β). Ptolemy’s theorem therefore leads to the
result sin(α2β)5sinαcosβ2 cosαsinα. Similar reasoning leads to the
formula sin(α1β)5sinα cosβ1cosαsinβ and to the analogous pair
cos(α6β)5cosαcosβ7 sinαsinβ. These four sum-and-difference formulas
consequently are often known today as Ptolemy’s formulas.</p>
<p>It was the formula for sine of the difference—or, more accurately,
chord of the difference—that Ptolemy found especially useful in building
up his tables. Another formula that served him effectively was the
equivalent of our half-angle formula. Given the chord of an arc in a
circle, Ptolemy found the chord of half of the arc as follows: let D be
the midpoint of arc BC in a circle with diameter AC52r (Fig. 8.9), let
AB5AE, and let</p>
<p>DF bisect EC (perpendicularly). Then, it is not difficult to show
that FC 5ð2r 2ABÞ: But from elementary geometry, it is known that2 DC2
5ACFC,fromwhichit followsthatDC 5r(2r2AB).If we let arc BC52α, then
DC52r sinα/2 and AB52r cosα; hence, we have the familiar modern formula
sinα=25pð12cosαÞ=2. In other words, if the chord of any arc is known,
the chord of half of the arc is also known. Now Ptolemy was equipped to
build up a table of chords as accurate as might be desired, for he had
the equivalent of our fundamental formulas.</p>
<p>The 360-Degree Circle</p>
<p>It should be recalled that from the days of Hipparchus until modern
times, there were no such things as trigonometric ratios. The Greeks—
and, after them, the Hindus and the Arabs—used trigonometric lines.
These at first took the form, as we have seen, of chords in a circle,
and it became incumbent on Ptolemy to associate numerical values (or
approximations) with the chords. To do this, two conventions were</p>
<p>needed: (1) some scheme for subdividing the circumference of a circle
and (2) some rule for subdividing the diameter. The division of a
circumference into 360 degrees seems to have been in use in Greece since
the days of Hipparchus, although it is not known just how the convention
arose. It is not unlikely that the 360-degree measure was carried over
from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve “signs” or
36 “decans.” A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be
made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by
subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts.
Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence.
Moreover, because the Babylonian positional system for fractions was so
obviously superior to the Egyptian unit fractions and the Greek common
fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into
sixty panes minutae primae, each of these latter into sixty partes
minutae secundae, and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that
translators used in this connection that our words “minute” and “second”
were derived.</p>
<p>Our trigonometric identities are easily converted into the language
of Ptolemaic chords through the simple relationships</p>
<p>chord2x chordð180 22xÞ sinx5 and cosx5:</p>
<p>120 120</p>
<p>The formulas cosðx6yÞ5cosxcosy7sinxsiny become (chord is abbreviated
to cd)</p>
<p>cd 2x cd 2y 7cd 2xcd 2y cd 2x62y 5 ;</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>where a line over an arc (angle) indicates the supplementary arc.
Note that not only angles and arcs but also their chords were expressed
sexagesimally. In fact, whenever scholars in antiquity wished an
accurate system of approximation, they turned to the sixty-scale for the
fractional portion; this led to the phrases “astronomers’ fractions” and
“physicists’ fractions” to distinguish sexagesimal from common
fractions.</p>
<p>Construction of Tables</p>
<p>Having decided on his system of measurement, Ptolemy was ready to
compute the chords of angles within the system. For example, because the
radius of the circle of reference contained sixty parts, the chord of an
arc of 60 degrees also contained sixty linear parts. The chord of 120
will be 60p3 or approximately 103 parts and 55 minutes and 33 seconds
or, in Ptolemy’s Ionic or alphabetic notation, ργp υεu λγv. Ptolemy
could now have used his half-angle formula to find the chord of 30, then
the chord of 15, and so on, for still smaller angles. Yet, he preferred
to delay the application of this formula and computed instead the chords
of 36 and 72. He used a theorem from Elements XIII.9, which shows that a
side of a regular pentagon, a side of a regular hexagon, and a side of a
regular decagon, all being inscribed within the same circle, constitute
the sides of a right triangle. Incidentally, this theorem from Euclid
provides the justification for Ptolemy’s elegant construction of a
regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Let O be the center of a circle
and AB a diameter (Fig. 8.10). Then, if C is the midpoint of OB and OD
is perpendicular to AB, and if CE is taken equal to CD, the sides of the
right triangle EDO are the sides of the regular inscribed pentagon,
hexagon, and decagon. Then, if the radius OB contains 60 parts, from the
properties of the pentagon and the golden section, it follows that OE,
the chord of 36, is 30ðp521Þ or about 37.083 or 37p 4u 5pv or λζpνεv. By
the Pythagorean</p>
<p>theorem, the chord of 72 is 30 1022 5; or approximately 70.536 or</p>
<p>70p 32u 3v or opλβuγv. p</p>
<p>Knowing the chord of an arc of s degrees in a circle, one can easily
find the chord of the arc 180 2s from the theorems of Thales and
Pythagoras, for cd2s1cd2s51202. Hence, Ptolemy knew the chords of the
supplements of 36 and 72. Moreover, from the chords of 72 and 60, he
found chord 12 by means of his formula for the chord of the difference
of two arcs. Then, by successive applications of his half-angle formula,
he derived the chords of arcs of 6, 3, 1, and , the last two being 1p
34u 15v and 0p 47u 8v, respectively. Through a linear interpolation
between these values, Ptolemy arrived at 1p 2u 50v as the chord of 1. By
using the half-angle formula—or, because the angle is very small, simply
dividing by 2—he found the value of 0p 31u 25v for the chord of 30u.
This is equivalent to saying that sin 150 is 0.00873, which is correct
to almost half a dozen decimal places.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s value of the chord of is, of course, the length of a side
of a polygon of 720 sides inscribed in a circle of radius 60 units.
Whereas Archimedes’ polygon of 96 sides had led to as an approximation
to the value of π, Ptolemy’s is equivalent to 6(0p 31u 25v) or 3;8,30.
This approximation to π, used by Ptolemy in the Almagest, is the same as
,</p>
<p>which leads to a decimal equivalent of about 3.1416, a value that may
have been given earlier by Apollonius.</p>
<p>Ptolemaic Astronomy</p>
<p>Armed with formulas for the chords of sums and differences and chords
of half an arc and having a good value of chord , Ptolemy went on to
build up his table, correct to the nearest second, of chords of arcs
from to 180 for every . This is virtually the same as a table of sines
from to 90, proceeding by steps of . The table formed an integral part
of Book I of the Almagest and remained an indispensable tool of
astronomers for
morethanathousandyears.Theremainingtwelvebooksofthiscelebrated treatise
contain, among other things, the beautifully developed theory of cycles
and epicycles for the planets known as the Ptolemaic system. Like
Archimedes, Hipparchus, and most other great thinkers of antiquity,
Ptolemy postulated an essentially geocentric universe, for a moving
earth appeared to be faced with difficulties—such as lack of apparent
stellar parallax and seeming inconsistency with the phenomena of
terrestrial dynamics. In comparison with these problems, the
implausibility of an immense speed required for the daily rotation of
the sphere of the “fixed” stars seemed to shrink into
insignificance.</p>
<p>Plato had set for Eudoxus the astronomical problems of “saving the
phenomena”—that is, producing a mathematical device, such as a
combination of uniform circular motions, which should serve as a model
for the apparent motions of the planets. The Eudoxian system of
homocentric spheres had been largely abandoned by mathematicians in
favor of the system of cycles and epicycles of Apollonius and
Hipparchus. Ptolemy, in turn, made an essential modification in the
latter scheme. In the first place, he displaced the earth somewhat from
the center of the deferent circle, so that he had eccentric orbits. Such
changes had been made before him, but Ptolemy introduced a novelty so
drastic in scientific implication that later Nicholas Copernicus could
not accept it, effective though the device, known as the equant, was in
reproducing the planetary motions. Try as he would, Ptolemy had not been
able to arrange a system of cycles, epicycles, and eccentrics in close
agreement with the observed motions of the planets. His solution was to
abandon the Greek insistence on uniformity of circular motions and to
introduce instead a geometric point, the equant E collinear with the
earth G and the center C of the deferent circle, such that the apparent
angular motion of the center Q of the epicycle in which a planet P
revolves is uniform as seen from E (Fig. 8.11). In this way, Ptolemy
achieved accurate representations of planetary motions, but, of course,
the device was only kinematic and made no effort to answer the questions
in dynamics raised by nonuniform circular movements.</p>
<p>Other Works by Ptolemy</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s fame today is largely associated with a single book, the
Almagest, but there are other Ptolemaic works as well. Among the more
important was a Geography, in eight books, which was as much a bible to
geographers of his day as the Almagest was to astronomers. The Geography
of Ptolemy introduced the system of latitudes and longitudes as used
today, described methods of cartographic projection, and catalogued some
8,000 cities, rivers, and other important features of the earth.
Unfortunately, there was at the time no satisfactory means of
determining longitudes, hence substantial errors were inevitable. Even
more significant was the fact that Ptolemy seems to have made a poor
choice when it came to estimating the size of the earth. Instead of
accepting the figure 252,000 stadia, given by Eratosthenes, he preferred
the value 180,000 stadia that was proposed by Posidonius, a Stoic
teacher of Pompey and Cicero. Hence, Ptolemy thought that the known
Eurasian world was a larger fraction of the circumference than it really
is—more than 180 in longitude, instead of the actual figure of about
130. This large error suggested to later navigators, including Columbus,
that a voyage westward from Europe to India would not be nearly so far
as it turned out to be. Had Columbus known how badly Ptolemy had
underestimated the size of the earth, he might never have set sail.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s geographical methods were better in theory than in
practice, for in separate monographs, which have survived only through
Latin translations from the Arabic, Ptolemy described two types of map
projection. Orthographic projection is explained in the Analemma, the
earliest account we have of this method, although it may have been used
by Hipparchus. In this transformation from a sphere to a plane, points
on the spherical surface are projected orthogonally on three mutually
perpendicular planes. In the Planisphaerium, Ptolemy described the
stereographic projection in which points on the sphere are projected by
lines from a pole onto a plane—in Ptolemy’s case, from the South Pole to
the plane of the equator. He knew that under such a transformation, a
circle not through the pole of projection went into a circle in the
plane, andthatacirclethroughthepolewasprojectedintoastraightline.Ptolemy
was also aware of the important fact that such a transformation is
conformal, that is, angles are preserved. Ptolemy’s importance for
geography can be gauged from the fact that the earliest maps in the
Middle Ages that have come down to us in manuscripts, none before the
thirteenth century, had as prototypes the maps made by Ptolemy more than
a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>Optics and Astrology</p>
<p>Ptolemy also wrote an Optics that has survived, imperfectly, through
a Latin version of an Arabic translation. This deals with the physics
and the psychology of vision, with the geometry of mirrors, and with an
early attempt at a law of refraction.</p>
<p>No account of Ptolemy’s work would be complete without mention of his
Tetrabiblos (or Quadripartitum), for it shows us a side of ancient
scholarship that we are prone to overlook. The Almagest is indeed a
model of good mathematics and accurate observational data put to work in
building a sober scientific astronomy, but the Tetrabiblos (or work in
four books) addresses a kind of sidereal religion to which much of the
ancient world had succumbed. Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos argued that one
should not, because of the possibility of error, discourage the
astrologer any more than the physician.</p>
<p>The Tetrabiblos differs from the Almagest not only as astrology
differs from astronomy; the two works also make use of different types
of mathematics. The latter makes good use of synthetic Greek geometry;
the former suggests that the populace in general was more concerned with
arithmetical computation than with rational thought. At least from the
days of Alexander the Great to the close of the classical world, there
was undoubtedly much intercommunication between Greece and Mesopotamia,
and it seems clear that the Babylonian arithmetic and algebraic geometry
continued to exert considerable influence in the Hellenistic world.
Greek deductive geometry, on the other hand, seems not to have been
welcomed in Mesopotamia until after the Arabic conquest.</p>
