<h4 id="logic-and-computing">Logic and Computing</h4>
<p>It is one of the ironies of history that while Bourbaki and many
other pure mathematicians pursued the goal of substituting ideas for
calculations, engineers and applied mathematicians developed a tool that
revived interest in numerical and algorithmic techniques and sharply
affected the composition of many departments of mathematics: the
computer. In the first half of the twentieth century, the history of
computing machines involved more statisticians, physicists, and
electrical engineers than mathematicians. Desk calculating machines and
punched-card systems were indispensable to business, banking, and the
social sciences. The slide rule became the symbol of the engineer, and
integrators of various types were used by physicists, geodesists, and
statisticians. Paper and pencil remained the chief tools of the
mathematician. The situation changed somewhat in the 1940s because of
the involvement of mathematicians in
thewareffort.Althoughmostofthemajoreffortsweredrivenbyphysicists and
engineers, numerous younger mathematicians played a part in the
development of the automatic digital electronic computer. Some of these
pioneers stayed in the computer field; others went into new fields more
closely related to the new technology; some turned to applied
mathematics; a few returned to their original specialties. Most of these
mathematicians were at an early stage of their careers when they became
involved with computers, many having received their Ph.D.s in the 1930s.
Let us consider three mathematicians whose contributions to the emerging
computer field</p>
<p>L o gic and C omput ing</p>
<p>were notable largely because of the fact that they had already gained
a reputation as mathematicians.</p>
<p>John von Neumann (1903 1957) was born in Budapest. After good
preparatory training that included individualized mathematical
instruction, he earned early recognition for his mathematical talents.
This permitted his obtaining a Ph.D. in mathematics from Budapest
practically in absentia while he spent his time in Zurich and Berlin. He
did, however, earn a degree in chemical engineering at the Polytechnic
Institute in Zurich. In a paper published when he was only twenty-one,
he gave a new definition for ordinal numbers; two years later, he
presented a system of axioms for set theory that provided an alternative
to those of Zermelo and A. Fraenkel. In 1926, he produced a pioneering
paper on game theory, following work by Borel. His teaching career began
in Germany, where he spent the three years from 1927 to 1930 at the
universities of Berlin and Hamburg. In 1930, he moved to Princeton, New
Jersey, where he was affiliated with Princeton University until asked to
become a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1933. One of the
most creative and versatile mathematicians of the century, von Neumann
was a pioneer in a new approach to mathematical economics. Econometrics
had long made use of mathematical analysis, but it was especially
through the Theory of Games and Economic Behavior of von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 that so-called finite mathematics came to play
an increasing role in the social sciences. Von Neumann’s contributions
to game theory involved primarily versions of cooperative games; the
1944 volume considered two-person zero-sum games. (This field of inquiry
was expanded considerably in the 1950s when John Forbes Nash developed
the equilibrium concept that allowed examination of noncooperative
games, which eventually resulted in his sharing the 1994 Nobel Prize in
Economics.)</p>
<p>Interrelationships among the various branches of thought had become
so complicated that Norbert Wiener (1894 1964), a mathematical prodigy
and for many years a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in 1948 published his Cybernetics, a book that
established a new subject devoted to the study of control and
communication in animals and machines. Von Neumann and Wiener were also
deeply involved in quantum theory, and the former in 1955 was appointed
to the Atomic Energy Commission. In addition to their contributions to
applied mathematics, these men contributed at least as extensively to
pure mathematics—to set theory, group theory, operational calculus,
probability, and mathematical logic and foundations. It had been von
Neumann, in fact, who in about 1929 had given Hilbert space its name,
its first axiomatization, and its present highly abstract form. Wiener
had been important in the early 1920s in the origins of the modern
theory of linear spaces and, in particular, in the development of Banach
space.</p>
<p>Alan Turing (1913 1954), the youngest of the three, was an Englishman
who graduated from King’s College at Cambridge University in 1934. The
following year, he made history by solving one of the outstanding
problems in mathematical logic. The paper containing this result,
published in 1937, was titled “On Computable Numbers, with an
Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.” In 1936, Turing had gone to
the United States to study at Princeton. While there, he worked with the
logician A. Church, who brought out his own proof of the
Entscheidungsproblem and became acquainted with John von Neumann. Having
been awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1938, Turing returned to England. On the
outbreak of World War II, Turing reported to the Government Code and
Cipher School at Bletchley Park. From then until his untimely death in
1954, he was deeply involved in cryptanalytic activity, the design of
electronic computers, and the design of programming systems.</p>
<p>Initial uses of computers for mathematical purposes were limited to
table computations and calculations of prime numbers, mathematical
constants, and the like. Some of the early computations of e and π were
carried out to test computing speed and capacity, as much as to
establish new results. In time, such efforts became more useful for
mathematics, theorem-proving programs were developed, and, as we shall
note in the next chapter, by 1977, the first computer-based proof of a
major mathematical theorem could be announced.</p>
