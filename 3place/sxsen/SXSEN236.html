<h4 id="dedekind">Dedekind</h4>
<p>Dedekind’s attention had been directed to the problem of irrational
numbers as early as 1858, when he found himself lecturing on the
calculus. The limit concept, he concluded, should be developed through
arithmetic alone, without the usual guidance from geometry, if it were
to be rigorous. Instead of simply seeking a way out of Cauchy’s vicious
circle, Dedekind asked himself, as the title of his book implies, what
there is in continuous geometric magnitude that distinguishes it from
the rational numbers. Galileo and Leibniz had thought that the
“continuousness” of points on a line was the result of their
density—that between any two points, there is always a third; however,
the rational numbers have this property, yet they do not form a
continuum. On pondering this matter, Dedekind came to the conclusion
that the essence of the continuity of a line segment is not due to a
vague hang-togetherness but to an exactly opposite property: the nature
of the division of the segment into two parts by a point on the segment.
In any division of the points of the</p>
<p>D e dekind</p>
<p>segment into two classes such that each point belongs to one and only
one class, and such that every point of the one class is to the left of
every point in the other, there is one and only one point that brings
about the division. As Dedekind wrote, “By this commonplace remark the
secret of continuity is to be revealed.” Commonplace the remark may have
been, but its author seems to have had some qualms about it, for he
hesitated for some years before committing himself in print.</p>
<p>Dedekind saw that the domain of rational numbers can be extended to
form a continuum of real numbers if one assumes what is now known as the
Cantor-Dedekind axiom, namely, that the points on a line can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. Arithmetically
expressed, this means that for every division of the rational numbers
into two classes A and B such that every number of the first class, A,
is less than every number of the second class, B, there is one and only
one real number producing this Schnitt, or Dedekind cut. If A has a
largest number or if B contains a smallest number, the cut defines a
rational number, but if A has no largest number and B no smallest, then
the cut defines an irrational number. If, for example, we put in A all
negative rational numbers and also all positive rational numbers whose
squares are less than 2 and in B all positive rational numbers whose
squares are more than 2, we have subdivided the entire field of rational
numbers in a manner defining an irrational number—in this case, the
number that we usuallyp write as 2. Now, Dedekind pointed out, the
fundamental theorems on limits can be proved rigorously without recourse
to geometry. It was geometry that had pointed the way to a suitable
definition of continuity, but in the end, it was excluded from the
formal arithmetic definition of the concept. The Dedekind cut in the
rational number system, or an equivalent construction of real number,
has now replaced geometrical magnitude as the backbone of analysis.</p>
<p>The definitions of real number are, as Hankel indicated they should
be, intellectual constructions on the basis of the rational numbers,
rather than something imposed on mathematics from without. Of the
previous definitions, one of the most popular has been that of Dedekind.
Early in the twentieth century, a modification of the Dedekind cut was
proposed by Bertrand Russell (1872 1970). He noted that because either
of Dedekind’s two classes A and B is uniquely determined by the other,
onep alone suffices for the determination of a real number. Thus, 2 can
be defined simply as that segment or subclass of the set of rational
numbers made up of all positive rational numbers whose squares are less
than 2 and also of all negative rational numbers. Similarly, every real
number is nothing more than a segment of the rational number system.</p>
<p>In some respects, the life of Dedekind was similar to that of
Weierstrass. He, too, was one of four children, and he, too, never
married, and both men lived into their eighties. On the other hand,
Dedekind made an earlier start in mathematics than had Weierstrass,
entering Gottingen¨ at the age of nineteen and earning his doctorate
three years later with a thesis on the calculus that elicited praise
from Gauss. Dedekind stayed at Gottingen for a few years, teaching and
listening to lectures by¨ Dirichlet, and then he took up secondary
school teaching, chiefly at Brunswick, for the rest of his life.
Dedekind lived so long after his celebrated introduction of “cuts” that
the famous publishing house of Teubner had listed his death in its
Calendar for Mathematicians as September 4, 1899. This amused Dedekind,
who lived more than a dozen years longer, and he wrote to the editor
that he had passed the day in question in stimulating conversation with
his friend Georg Cantor.</p>
