<h4 id="men-and-institutions">Men and Institutions</h4>
<p>Mathematicians of France at the time of the revolution not only
contributed handsomely to the fund of knowledge but they were in large
measure responsible for the chief lines of development in the explosive
proliferation of mathematics during the succeeding century. Of six men
whom we may name as mathematical leaders during the revolution, all had
produced abundantly before 1789; not one of the six expressed regret
later when the old order passed away. They were Gaspard Monge,
Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre Simon Laplace, Adrien Marie Legendre,
Lazare Carnot, and Nicolas Condorcet; they were to be in the midst of
the turmoil, and one of them fell victim to it.</p>
<p>Two mathematicians, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert and Condorcet, were among
the heralds of the French Revolution. Only Condorcet lived to see the
fall of the Bastille, and he succumbed as a result.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>The chief scientific institution in France supporting mathematical
research through publications, meetings, and prizes during most of the
eighteenth century was the Royal Academy of Sciences. In 1793, the
Revolutionary Convention shut down operation of the Academy of Sciences,
along with that of four other major academies. Two years later, the
Directory established the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts,
composed of three classes: physical and mathematical sciences, moral and
political sciences, literature and fine arts. Various reorganizations
and name changes followed, initially at the behest of Napoleon, who had
joined the Institut in 1797. Only in 1816 could the classes resume under
the name “Academy,” which had been considered reactionary. During the
early years of this strife-torn period, mathematical activities of the
Academy were greatly diminished; the one project that survived the
political gyrations was the reform of weights and measures.</p>
<p>The year 1793 marked the shutting down not only of the academies but
also of the activities of most of the colleges making up the University
of Paris. Universities had not been the mathematical foci that they are
today. Most French mathematicians of the eighteenth century who were
active before the revolution were associated not with the universities,
but with either the church or the military; others found royal patronage
or became private teachers.</p>
<p>Within a few years of the fall of the Bastille in 1789, the system of
higher education in France was to undergo a drastic revision as a result
of the upheaval produced by the French Revolution. During this short but
significant period, France once more became the mathematical center of
the world, as it had been during the middle of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>The Committee onWeights and Measures</p>
<p>The reform of the system of weights and measures is an especially
appropriate example of the way in which mathematicians patiently
persisted in their efforts despite confusion and political difficulties.
As early in the revolution as 1790, Talleyrand proposed the reform of
weights and measures. The problem was referred to the Academie des´
Sciences, in which a committee that had Lagrange and Condorcet as two of
its members was established to draw up a proposal.</p>
<p>The committee considered two alternatives for the basic length in the
new system. One was the length of the pendulum that should beat seconds.
The equation for the pendulum being T 52π l=g; this would make the
standard length g=π2 But the committee was so impressed byp the accuracy
with which Legendre and others had measured the length of a terrestrial
meridian that in the end, the meter was defined to be the tenmillionth
part of the distance between the equator and the pole. The</p>
<p>D’Ale mb er t</p>
<p>resulting metric system was ready in most respects in 1791, but there
was confusion and delay in establishing it.</p>
<p>The closing of the Academie in 1793 was a blow to mathematics, but
the´ convention continued the Committee on Weights and Measures,
although it purged the committee of some members, such as A. L.
Lavoisier, and enlarged it by adding others, including Monge. At one
point, Lagrange was very nearly lost to the committee, for the
Convention had banned foreigners from France, but Lagrange was
specifically exempted from the decree and remained to serve as head of
the committee. Still later, the committee was made responsible to the
Institut national; Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre, and Monge all served on
the committee at this stage. By 1799, the work of the committee had been
completed, and the metric system, as we have it today, became a reality.
The metric system is, of course, one of the more tangible mathematical
results of the revolution, but in terms of the development of our
subject, it cannot be compared in significance with other
contributions.</p>
