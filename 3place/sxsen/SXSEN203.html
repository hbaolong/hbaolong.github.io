<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>The theory of probability owes more to Laplace than to any other
mathematician. From 1774 on, he wrote many memoirs on the subject, the
results of which he embodied in the classic Theorie analytique des´
probabilites´ of 1812. He considered the theory from all aspects and at
all levels, and his Essai philosophique des probabilite´ of 1814 is an
introductory account for the general reader. Laplace wrote that “at the
bottom the theory of probabilities is only common sense expressed in
numbers,” but his Theorie analytique´ shows the hand of a master analyst
who knows his advanced calculus. It is replete with integrals involving
beta and gamma functions, and Laplace was among the earliest to show
that 2NNe2x2dx, the area under the probability curve is pπ. Although the
method by which he achieved this result was somewhat artificial, it is
not far removed from the modern device of transforming</p>

<p>0 0</p>
<p>which is easily evaluated and leads to</p>

<p>Among the many things to which Laplace called attention in his
Theorie´
analytiquewasthecalculationofnthroughBuffon’sneedleproblem,which had
been all but forgotten for thirty-five years. This is sometimes known as
the Buffon-Laplace needle problem, inasmuch as Laplace extended the
original problem to a crisscross of two mutually perpendicular sets of
equidistant parallel lines. If the distances are a and b, the
probability that a needle of length l (less than a and b) will fall on
one of the lines is</p>

<p>πab</p>
<p>Laplace also rescued from oblivion the work of the Reverend Thomas
Bayes (1761) on inverse probability. Furthermore, we find in Laplace’s
book the theory of least squares, invented by Legendre, together with a
formal proof that Legendre had failed to give. The Theorie analytique´
also contains the Laplace transform, which is so useful in differential
equations. If fðxÞ5ÐN0 extgðtÞdt; the function f(x) is said to be the
Laplace transform of the function g(x).</p>
<p>Celestial Mechanics and Operators</p>
<p>The works of Laplace involve a considerable application of higher
mathematical analysis. Typical was his studyof the conditions for the
equilibrium of a rotating fluid mass, a subject that he had considered
in connection with the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar
system. In 1796, the
hypothesishadbeenpresentedinapopularforminExpositiondusyste`medu</p>
<p>L aplace</p>
<p>monde, a book that bears the same relation to the Mecanique c´
eleste´ (1799 1825, 5 vols.) as does the Essai philosophique des
probabilites´ to theTheorieanalytique´
.AccordingtothetheoryofLaplace,thesolarsystem evolved from an
incandescent gas rotating about an axis. As it cooled, the gas
contracted, causing ever more rapid rotation, according to the
conservation of angular momentum, until successive rings broke off from
theouteredgetocondenseandformplanets.Therotatingsunconstitutesthe
remaining central core of the nebula. The idea behind this hypothesis
was not entirely original with Laplace, for it had been proposed in
qualitative skeletal form by Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant, but the
quantitative fleshing out of the theory forms part of the multivolume
Mecanique c´ eleste´ . It is also in this classic that we find, in
connection with the attraction of a spheroid on a particle, the
Laplacian use of the idea of potential and the Laplace equation. In a
highly technical paper of 1782 on “Theorie des´ attractions des spheroı´
¨des et de la figure des plane`tes,” also included in the Mecaniquec´
eleste´ ,Laplacedevelopedtheveryusefulconceptofpotential— a function
whose directional derivative at every point is equal to the component of
the field intensity in the given direction. Also of fundamental
importance in astronomy and mathematical physics is the so-called
Laplacian of a function u5f(x, y, z). This is simply the sum of the
second-order partial derivatives of u, namely, uxx 1uvv 1uzz, often
abbreviated r2u (“del-square”), where r2 is called Laplace’s operator.
The function r2u is independent of the particular coordinate system that
is used; under certain conditions, gravitational, electrical, and other
potentials satisfy the Laplace equation uxx 1uyy 1uzz 50. Euler had run
across this equation somewhat incidentally in 1752 in studies on
hydrodynamics, but Laplace made it a standard part of mathematical
physics.</p>
<p>The publication of the Mecanique c´ eleste´ of Laplace is commonly
regarded as marking the culmination of the Newtonian view of
gravitation. Accounting for all of the perturbations in the solar
system, Laplace showed the motions to be secular, so that the system
could be regarded as stable. There no longer appeared to be any need for
occasional divine intervention. Napoleon is said to have commented to
Laplace on the latter’s failure to mention God in his monumental work,
whereupon Laplace is reported to have replied, “I have no need for that
hypothesis.” Lagrange, being told about this, is quoted as saying, “Ah,
but it is a beautiful hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Laplace completed not only the gravitational portion of Newton’s
Principiabutalsosomepointsinthephysics.Newtonhadcomputedavelocityof
soundonpurelytheoreticalgrounds,onlytofindthatthecalculationresulted in
toosmall a value for the speed. In 1816, Laplace was the first one to
point out that the lack of agreement between calculated and observed
speeds was due to the fact that the computations in the Principia were
based on the assumption of isothermal compressions and expansions,
whereas in reality the oscillations for sound are so rapid that
compressions are adiabatic, thereby increasing the elasticity of the air
and the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The minds of Laplace and Lagrange, the two leading mathematicians of
the revolution, were in many ways direct opposites. For Laplace, nature
was the essence, and mathematics was only a kit of tools that he handled
with extraordinary skill; for Lagrange, mathematics was a sublime art
that was its own excuse for being. The mathematics of the Mecanique´
celeste´ has often been described as difficult, but no one calls it
beautiful; the Mecanique analytique´ , on the other hand, has been
admired as “a scientific poem” in the perfection and grandeur of its
structure.</p>
