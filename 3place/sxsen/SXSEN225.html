<h4 id="augustus-de-morgan">Augustus De Morgan</h4>
<p>Among the supporters of the new view of algebra was Augustus De
Morgan, a prolific writer who had helped found the British Association
for the Advancement of Science (1831). De Morgan had been born, blind in
one eye, in India, his father having been associated with the East India
Company; he attended Trinity College, graduating as fourth wrangler. He
could not hold a fellowship at Cambridge or Oxford because he refused to
submit to the necessary religious test, despite the fact that he had
been brought up in the Church of England, in which his mother hoped he
would become a minister. De Morgan consequently was appointed, at the
early age of twenty-two, a professor of mathematics at the newly
established London University, later University College of the
University of London, where he continued to teach, except for short
periods following resignations prompted by cases of abridgement of
academic freedom. He always remained a champion of religious and
intellectual toleration, and he was equally a writer and a teacher of
exceptional ability. Many of his conundrums and witticisms were
collected in his well-known Budget of Paradoxes.</p>
<p>Peacock was something of a prophet in the development of abstract
algebra, and De Morgan was to him somewhat as Elisha was to Elijah. In
Peacock’s Algebra, the symbols were generally understood to be numbers
or magnitudes, but De Morgan would keep them abstract. He left without
meaning not only the letter that he used, but also the symbols of
operation; letters such as A, B, C might stand for virtues and vices
and1and might mean reward and punishment. De Morgan insisted that “with
one exception, no word or sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of
meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is symbols and
their laws of combination, giving a symbolic algebra which may hereafter
become the grammar of a hundred distinct significant algebras.” (The
exception mentioned by De Morgan is the symbol of equality, for he
thought that in A5B, the symbols A and B must “have the same resulting
meaning, by whatever steps attained.”) This idea, expressed as early as
1830 in his Trigonometry and Double Algebra, comes close to the modern
recognition that mathematics deals with propositional functions, rather
than with propositions, but De Morgan seems not to have realized the
entirely arbitrary nature of the rules and the definitions of algebra.
He was sufficiently close to Kantian philosophy to believe that the
usual fundamental laws of algebra should apply to any algebraic system
whatsoever. He saw that in going from the “single algebra” of the real
number system to the “double algebra” of the complex numbers, the rules
of operation remain the same. And De Morgan believed that these two
forms exhaust the types of algebra that are possible and that a triple
or quadruple algebra could not be developed. In this important respect,
he was shown to be wrong by William Rowan Hamilton of Dublin. Another
mathematician of Trinity (Dublin) was George Salmon (1819 1904), who
taught both mathematics and divinity there and was the author of
excellent textbooks on conics, algebra, and analytic geometry.</p>
