<h4 id="the-fields-medals">The Fields Medals</h4>
<p>The international mathematical community has an award that is often
likened to the Nobel Prize in other disciplines. The award is named for
John Charles Fields (1863 1932), a Canadian mathematician based at the
University of Toronto who specialized in the study of algebraic
functions. He had good interpersonal relationships with European
mathematicians, notably Go¨sta Mittag-Leffler and appears to have had
considerable managerial skills. He succeeded in bringing the 1924
International Congress of Mathematicians to Toronto at a time when there
were sharp political differences among mathematicians. After World War I
(until 1928), Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey were
excluded from the International Mathematical Union (IMU) that was
established in 1920 to organize subsequent congresses. Fields
successfully persuaded many leading European mathematicians opposed to
the IMU to support and attend the 1924 congress; he raised funds for the
congress and its attendees; and when it turned out that there was excess
money at the end, he proposed, in 1931, that this money be</p>
<p>T he F ields Me dal s</p>
<p>used to establish an international medal for mathematics. His will
provided for an additional amount.</p>
<p>At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932, it was
decided that beginning with the 1936 congress, “Fields medals” should be
awarded at the ICM to two mathematicians every four years. The
recipients should be under forty years old, and, as Fields had
suggested, the awards should call attention to past accomplishments as
well as future potential. The rules were modified in 1966 to stipulate
that the number of Fields medals awarded at each congress should be at
least two but no more than four.</p>
<p>The first two medals went to Lars V. Ahlfors (1907 1996) and Jesse
Douglas (1897 1965) for their work in analysis. Ahlfors was recognized
for his work “on covering surfaces related to Riemann surfaces of
inverse functions of entire and meromorphic functions”; Douglas received
recognition for his research in the area of Plateau’s problem.</p>
<p>World War II disrupted the International Congresses and the
concomitant medal awards; the next awards ceremony took place in 1950.
The 1950s reflected the waning dominance of classical analysis;
henceforth there was a steady increase of awards for research in
topology as well as in algebra, algebraic geometry, and number theory.
Since the 1990s, a number of awards have gone to individuals who
excelled in research that pulled together previously diverse areas of
mathematics.</p>
<p>Of the fifty-two Fields medals awarded prior to 2014, only four went
to recipients under thirty years of age. Eleven honorees were born in
the United States, eight each in France and the former Soviet Union or
Russia, six in England, and three each in Germany and Japan. The
remaining recipients were natives of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Italy,
Ukraine, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, China, Vietnam, and
Israel. These figures are of limited significance, however; for example,
two of those born in Germany studied and lived in France; numerous
others born outside North America spent at least part of their careers
in the United States. As we shall see in the next chapter, one honoree
declined the award and another potential recipient lost out because of
the proximity of his fortieth birthday; he received a silver plate
instead of a medal.</p>
