<h4 id="analysis-in-france">Analysis in France</h4>
<p>Before examining some of the fruits of Cantor’s paradise, we should
regard some nineteenth-century analytic work in the country thus far
ignored in this chapter—France. Although analytic activity during the
latter part of the nineteenth century was most conspicuous in Germany
and England, there had been a steady stream of contributions from Paris.
These took a variety of forms, in teaching and research. Primarily
associated with teaching were the great textbooks, usually based on
lecture notes. Sturm’s Cours d’analyse was but one of the
longest-lasting successors to Cauchy’s record of the course taught at
the E´cole Polytechnique; at the turn of the century, it was overtaken
by Goursat’s work, which exerted a special influence in the United
States through its English translation. Briot and Bouquet’s Theorie des
fonctions elliptiques´ was a comprehensive compendium on the subject of
elliptic functions; H. Laurent produced an elementary textbook on the
subject more suitable for classroom use. Toward the end of the century,
Jules Tannery and J. Molk produced multivolume Elements of the theory of
elliptic functions. There were authors who ranged across a wider field,
such as Joseph Alfred Serret (1819 1885), who taught and produced
textbooks on practically every area of mid-nineteenth-century
mathematics. Also significant was the work of popularizers such as the
Abbe Moigno, a self-´ appointed explicator of Cauchy in the 1840s and
the editor of Cosmos, a journal that reported on scientific and
mathematical activities.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Cauchy’s work provided ample takeoff points for
many analysts of the time. For example, Pierre-Alphonse Laurent
(1813</p>
<ol start="1854" type="1">
<li>and Victor Puiseux (1820 1883) are still remembered for their
contributions to complex function theory. Laurent’s expansion replaces
Taylor series at certain points of discontinuity; Puiseux went beyond
Cauchy in a clear discussion of essential singularities and related
matters.</li>
</ol>
<p>French mathematics continued to influence activity elsewhere—we have
already noted this in connection with Liouville and Camille Jordan.
Another example may be found in the work of Gabriel Lame (1795´ 1860),
whose name is primarily associated with the introduction of curvilinear
coordinates to the treatment of the partial differential equations,
especially the heat equation, describing physical problems. Eduard
Heine, a much younger member of the Dirichlet circle, who concentrated
on spherical harmonics and the potential equation, first followed and
for a while was in close competition with Lame in his research. Also´
inspired by Lame’s concept of curvilinear coordinates and overlapping´
with Heine was E´. Mathieu (1835 1900), who introduced elliptic
cylindrical coordinates and the functions named after him in his study
of the wave equation, in connection with the problem of a vibrating
elliptic membrane.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known French analytic work of midcentury was that of
Sturm and Liouville, dealing with the theory of second-order ordinary
differential equations with boundary conditions. In fact, the papers in
question were published in the early issues of Liouville’s Journal in
the 1830s. Their tremendous significance emerged only gradually,
however, especially through the use made of them by the British
mathematical physicists of the later period. The problem at issue was
that of the expansibility into characteristic functions (eigenfunctions)
of the expression at hand. It can be regarded as a generalization of the
theory of Fourier series. Sturm had studied not only Fourier’s theory of
heat but also his work on numerical solutions of equations; the
influence of this work seems apparent as soon as one reads Sturm’s first
major result of the theory. This is his separation theorem, which states
that the oscillations of any two (real) solutions alternate, or separate
each other. The Sturm-Liouville theory not only confirmed the
expansibility but also provided criteria for solutions and for the
evaluation of the eigenfunctions. The theory was not altogether rigorous
at the outset. Toward the end of the century, refinements in
applications and proofs were provided. Especially active in the field
was the American mathematician Maxime Boˆcher (1867 1918). Boˆcher, who
trained at Harvard in the</p>
<p>1880s under William Elwood Byerly, Benjamin O. Peirce, and James
Mills Peirce, had earned his doctoral degree at Gottingen under Klein
in¨ 1891 with a prize-winning dissertation on the series expansions of
potential theory. After the turn of the century, Boˆcher was briefly
joined in the study of Sturm-Liouville issues by his fellow countrymen
Max Mason, G. R. D. Richardson, and G. D. Birkhoff. As a token of
appreciation for Sturm and Liouville’s theory and the research
opportunities it had provided for this small band of American analysts,
Boˆcher chose Sturm’s methods as his topic when he was invited to give a
set of lectures at the University of Paris in the winter of 1913
1914.</p>
<p>Liouville is also noted for a variety of other contributions. In
complex analysis, his work is recalled in Liouville’s theorem: If f(z),
an entire analytic function of the complex variable z, is bounded over
the complex plane, then f(z) is a constant. From this theorem, the
fundamental theorem of algebra can be deduced as a simple corollary as
follows: If f(z) is a polynomial of degree greater than zero, and if
f(z) were nowhere zero in the complex plane, then its reciprocal
F(z)5l/f(z) would satisfy the conditions of the Liouville theorem.
Consequently, F(z) would have to be a constant, which obviously it is
not. Therefore, the equation f(z)50 is satisfied by at least one complex
value z5z0. In plane analytic geometry, there is another “Liouville
theorem”: The lengths of the tangents from a point P to a conic C are
proportional to the cube roots of the radii of curvature of C at the
corresponding points of contact. Finally, let us consider Liouville’s
best-known contribution to the theory of real numbers.</p>
<p>The theory of numbers deals primarily with the integers or, more
generally, with ratios of integers—the so-called rational numbers. Such
numbers are always roots of a linear equation ax 1 b 50 with integral
coefficients. Real analysis deals with a more general type of number
that may be either rational or irrational. It had been known, in
essence, to Euclid that the roots of ax2 1bx1c 50, where a, b, and c are
integral multiples of a given length, can be constructed geometrically
with a straightedge and compasses. If the coefficients of axn 1bxn 1
1cxn 2 1 1px1q50, where n and a,b,c, . .. ,q are integers and n .2, the
roots of the equation generally are not constructible with Euclidean
tools. The roots of such an equation, for n.0, are known as algebraic
numbers, to indicate the manner in which they are defined. Inasmuch as
every rational number is a root of such an equation for n51, the
question naturally arises whether every irrational number is a root of
such an equation for some n. The negative of this question was finally
established in 1844 by Liouville, who in that year constructed an
extensive class of nonalgebraic real numbers. The numbers of the
particular class that he developed are known as Liouville numbers, the
more comprehensive set of nonalgebraic real numbers being called
transcendental numbers. Liouville’s construction of transcendental
numbers is quite involved, but if one does not insist on a proof of
transcendentalism, some simple examples of transcendental numbers can be
given—such as</p>
<p>0.1001000100001 … , or numbers of the form</p>
<p>N 1</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>10n! n1</p>
<p>To prove that any particular real number, such as e or π, is not
algebraic is usually quite difficult. Liouville, for example, was able
to show, in his Journal for 1844, that neither e nor e2 could be the
root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients; hence, given a
unit line segment, lines of length e or e2 are not constructible by
Euclidean tools. But it was almost thirty years before another French
mathematician, Charles Hermite (1822 1901), pursuing the views of
Liouville, was able to show in 1873 in an article in the Comptes Rendus
of the Academie that´ e could not be the root of any polynomial equation
with integral coefficients—that is, that e is transcendental.</p>
<p>The status of the number π baffled mathematicians for nine years
longer than did the number e. Lambert in 1770 and Legendre in 1794 had
shown that both π and π2 are irrational, but this proof had not put an
end to the age-old question of the squaring of the circle. The matter
was finally put to rest in 1882 in a paper in the Mathematische Annalen
by C. L. F. Lindemann (1852 1939) of Munich. The article, titled “U¨ ber
die Zahl π,” showed conclusively, in extending the work of Liouville and
Hermite, that π is also a transcendental number. In his proof, Lindemann
first demonstrated that the equation eix 1150 cannot be satisfied if x
is algebraic. Inasmuch as Euler had shown that the value x5π does
satisfy the equation, it must follow that π is not algebraic. Here,
finally, was the answer to the classical problem of the quadrature of
the circle. In order for the quadrature of the circle to be possible
with Euclidean tools, the number π would have to be the root of an
algebraic equation with a root expressible in square roots. Because π is
not algebraic, the circle cannot be squared according to the classical
rules. Emboldened by his success, Ferdinand Lindemann later published
several purported proofs of Fermat’s Last Theorem, but they were shown
by others to be invalid.</p>
<p>Hermite was one of France’s most influential nineteenth-century
analysts. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that he had fared
badly as a student when faced with educational pedantry and
examinations, Hermite at one time or another was affiliated with the
major mathematically oriented institutions of Paris. Hermite served as
examiner at the E´cole Polytechnique, substituted at the Colle`ge de
France, taught at the E´cole Normale, and, from 1869 to 1897, held the
chair as professor of higher analysis at the Sorbonne. In school, he had
the same teacher who had encouraged the young Galois; his first reading
in the mathematical classics consisted of Lagrange’s work on the
solution of numerical equations and the French translation of Gauss’s
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. He had first come to notice in 1842, while
still a preparatory school student, by submitting two papers to the
Nouvelles Annales de Mathematiques´ , a journal aimed at mathematics
teachers and their more advanced students. One of
thesepaperswasaveryelegantexpositionoftheinsolvabilityofthequintic. In
1858, he, as well as Kronecker, solved the quintic equation using
elliptic modular functions. During the intervening years, Hermite had
come under the protection of Liouville, who introduced Hermite to his
friends in Prussia, especially Jacobi. The ensuing correspondence shows
Hermite’s early feats in the theory of elliptic and Abelian functions
and analytic number theory. In 1864, Hermite contributed a new class of
special functions in connection with the problem of functional
expansions over unbounded intervals. Ironically, the name of this great
analyst nowadays appears more frequently in algebra than in analysis:
Given a matrix H, let each of its elements be replaced by its complex
conjugate and call the resulting matrix H<em>. If H5H</em>, the matrix
is called Hermitian. In 1858, Hermite showed that the eigenvalues of
such a matrix are real. Previously, he had coined the term “orthogonal”
for a matrix M if 2M equals the inverse of M*.</p>
<p>The steady contributions of nineteenth-century French analysts attest
to the continuing fertility of French analytic soil, but the most
telling sign was the spectacular display of new concepts that Poincare
and his´ younger contemporaries presented to the new century.</p>
