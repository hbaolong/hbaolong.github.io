<h4 id="cardans-ars-magna">Cardan’s Ars Magna</h4>
<p>The Arithmetica Integra was as thorough a treatment of algebra as was
generally known up to 1544, yet by the following year, it was in a sense
quite outmoded. Stifel gave many examples that led to quadratic
equations,butnoneofhisproblemsledtomixedcubicequations,forthesimple
reason that he knew no more about the algebraic solution of the cubic
than did Pacioli or Omar Khayyam. In 1545, however, the solution not
only of the cubic, but also of the quartic, became common knowledge
through the publication of the Ars Magna of Geronimo Cardano (1501
1576). Such a striking and unanticipated development made so strong an
impact on algebraists that the year 1545 is frequently taken to mark the
beginning of the modern period in mathematics. It must immediately be
pointed out, however, that Cardano (or Cardan) was not the original
discoverer of the solution of either the cubic or the quartic. He
himself candidly admitted this in his book. The hint for solving the
cubic, he averred, he had obtained from Niccolo Tartaglia (ca. 1500
1557); the solution of the quartic was first discovered by Cardan’s
quondam amanuensis, Ludovico Ferrari (1522 1565). What Cardan failed to
mention in Ars Magna is the solemn oath he had sworn to Tartaglia that
he would not disclose the secret, for the latter intended to make his
reputation by publishing the solution of the cubic as the crowning part
of his treatise on algebra.</p>
<p>Lest one feel undue sympathy for Tartaglia, it may be noted that he
had published an Archimedean translation (1543), derived from Moerbeke,
leaving the impression that it was his own, and in his Quesiti et
Inventioni Diverse (Venice, 1546), he gave the law of the inclined
plane, presumably derived from Jordanus Nemorarius, without proper
credit. It is, in fact, possible that Tartaglia himself had received a
hint concerning the solution of the cubic from an earlier source.
Whatever may be the truth in a rather complicated and sordid controversy
between proponents of Cardan and Tartaglia, it is clear that neither of
the principals was the first to make the discovery. The hero in the case
evidently was one whose name is scarcely remembered today—Scipione del
Ferro (ca. 1465 1526), a professor of mathematics at Bologna, one of the
oldest of the medieval universities and a school with a strong
mathematical tradition. How or when del Ferro made his wonderful
discovery is not known. He did not publish the solution, but before his
death he disclosed it to a student, Antonio Maria Fior (or Floridus in
Latin).</p>
<p>Word of the existence of an algebraic solution of the cubic seems to
have gotten around, and Tartaglia told us that knowledge of the
possibility of solving the equation inspired him to devote his time to
discovering the method for himself. Whether independently or on the
basis of a hint, Tartaglia did indeed learn, by 1541, how to solve cubic
equations. When news of this spread, a mathematical contest between Fior
and Tartaglia was arranged. Each contestant proposed thirty questions
for the other to solve within a stated time interval. When the day for
the decision had arrived, Tartaglia had solved all questions posed by
Fior, whereas the unfortunate Fior had not solved a single one set by
his opponent. The explanation is relatively simple. Today we think of
cubic equations as all essentially of one type and as amenable to a
single unified method of solution. At that time, however, when negative
coefficients were virtually unused, there were as many types of cubics
as there are possibilities in positive or negative signs for
coefficients. Fior was able to solve only equations of the type in which
cubes and roots equal a number, that is, those of the type x3 1px5q,
although at that time only specific numerical (positive) coefficients
were used. Tartaglia, meanwhile, had also learned how to solve equations
of the form where cubes and squares equal a number. It is likely that
Tartaglia had learned how to reduce this case to Fior’s by removing the
squared term, for it became known by this time that if the leading
coefficient is unity, then the coefficient of the squared term, when it
appears on the other side of the equality sign, is the sum of the
roots.</p>
<p>News of Tartaglia’s triumph reached Cardan, who promptly invited the
winner to his home, with a hint that he would arrange to have him meet a
prospective patron. Tartaglia had been without a substantial source of
support,partlyperhapsbecauseofaspeechimpediment.Asachild,hehad received
a saber cut in the fall of Brescia to the French in 1512, which impaired
his speech. This earned him the nickname “Tartaglia,” or</p>
<p>“stammerer,” a name that he thereafter used instead of the name
“Niccolo Fontana” that had been given him at birth. Cardan, in contrast
to Tartaglia, had achieved worldly success as a physician. So great was
his fame that he was once called to Scotland to diagnose an ailment of
the Archbishop of St. Andrews (evidently, a case of asthma). By birth
illegitimate and by habit an astrologer, a gambler, and a heretic,
Cardan was nevertheless a respected professor at Bologna and Milan, and,
ultimately, he was granted a pension by the pope. One of his sons
poisoned his own wife, the other son was a scoundrel, and Cardan’s
secretary Ferrari probably died of poison at the hands of his own
sister. Despite such distractions, Cardan was a prolific writer on
topics ranging from his own life and praise of gout to science and
mathematics.</p>
<p>In his chief scientific work, a ponderous volume with the title De
Subtilitate, Cardan is clearly a child of his age, interminably
discussing the Aristotelian physics handed down through Scholastic
philosophy, while at the same time waxing enthusiastic about the new
discoveries of the then recent times. Much the same can be said of his
mathematics, for this, too, was typical of the day. He knew little of
Archimedes and less of Apollonius, but he was thoroughly familiar with
algebra and trigonometry. He had already published a Practica
Arithmetice in 1539, which included, among other things, the
rationalization of denominators containing cube roots. By the time he
published the Ars Magna, half a dozen years later, he was probably the
ablest algebraist in Europe. Nevertheless, the Ars Magna makes dull
reading today. Case after case of the cubic equation is laboriously
worked out in detail, according as terms of the various degrees appear
on the same or on opposite sides of the equality, for coefficients were
necessarily positive. Despite the fact that he was dealing with
equations on numbers, he followed al-Khwarizmi in thinking
geometrically, so that we might refer to his method as “completing the
cube.” There are, of course, certain advantages in such an approach. For
instance, because x3 is a volume, 6x, in Cardan’s following equation,
must also be thought of as a volume. Hence, the number 6 must have the
dimensionality of an area, suggesting the type of substitution that
Cardan used, as we shall shortly see.</p>
<p>Cardan used little syncopation, being a true disciple of
al-Khwarizmi, and, like the Arabs, he thought of his equations with
specific numerical coefficients as representative of general categories.
For example, when he wrote,“Letthe cubeandsixtimesthesidebe
equalto20”(orx3 16x 5 20),
heobviouslythoughtofthisequationastypicalofallofthosehaving“acube and
thing equal to a number”—that is, of the form x3 1px5q. The solution of
this equation covers a couple of pages of rhetoric that we should now
put in symbols as follows: Substitute u2v for x and let u and v be
related so that their product (thought of as an area) is one-third the x
coefficient in the cubic equation—that is, uv52. On substitution in the
equation, the result is u3 2v3 520, and, on eliminating v, we have u6
520u3 18, a quadratic in u3. Hence, u3 is known to be p108110. From the
relationship u3 2v3 520, we see that v3 5p108210: hence, from x5u2v, we
have x5 3 p1081102 3 p108210. Having carried through the method for this
specific case, Cardan closed with a verbal formulation of the rulep p 3
equivalent to our modern solution of x 1px5q as x5r3 qðp=3Þ3 1ðq=2Þ2
1q=22r3 qðp=3Þ3 1ðq=2Þ2 2q=2</p>
<p>Cardan then went on to other cases, such as “cube equal to thing and
number.” Here, one makes the substitution x5u1v, instead of x5 u2v, the
rest of the method remaining essentially the same. In this case,
however, there is a difficulty. When the rule is applied to x3 5 15x14,
for example, the result is x5 3 21 2p 1211 3 22 2p 121.</p>
<p>Cardanknewthattherewasnosquarerootofanegativenumber,yetheknewp p
x54tobearoot.Hewasunabletounderstandhowhisrulecouldmakesense in this
situation. He had toyed with square roots of negative numbers in another
connection when he asked thatonedivide 10 into two parts such that the
product of the parts is 40. The usual rules of algebra lead to the
answers 51 2p 15 and 52 2p 15 (or, in Cardan’s notation, 5p:Rm:15 and
5m:Rm:15. Cardan referred to these square roots of negative numbers as
“sophistic” and concluded that his result in this case was “as subtile
as it is useless.” Later writers were to show that such manipulations
were indeed subtle but far from useless. It is to Cardan’s credit that
at least he paid some attention to this puzzling situation.</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Solution of the Quartic Equation</p>
<p>Of the rule for solving quartic equations, Cardan in the Ars Magna
wrote that it “is due to Luigi Ferrari, who invented it at my request.”
Again separate cases, twenty in all, are considered in turn, but for the
modern reader, one case will suffice. Let square-square and square and
number be equal to side. (Cardan knew how to eliminate the cubic term by
increasing or diminishing the roots by one-fourth of the coefficient in
the cubic term.) Then, the steps in the solution of x4 16x2 136560x are
expressed by Cardan essentially as follows:</p>
<p>1.First, add enough squares and numbers to both sides to make the
lefthand side a perfect square.</p>
<p>2.Now add to both sides of the equation terms involving a newunknown
y such that the left-hand side remains a perfect square.</p>
<p>3.The next, and crucial, step is to choose y so that the trinomial on
the right-hand side will be a perfect square. This is done, of course,
by setting thediscriminantequalto zero, an ancient
andwell-knownrule.</p>
<p>4.The result of step 3 is a cubic equation in y: y3 115y2 136y5450,
today known as the “resolvent cubic” for the given quartic equation.
This is now solved for y by the rules previously given for the solution
of cubic equations.</p>
<p>5.Substitute a value of y from step 4 into the equation for x in step
2 and take the square root of both sides.</p>
<p>6.The result of step 5 is a quadratic equation, which must now
besolved to find the value of x desired.</p>
<p>The solution of cubic and quartic equations was perhaps the greatest
contribution to algebra since the Babylonians, almost four millennia
earlier, had learned how to complete the square for quadratic equations.
No other discoveries had had quite the stimulus to algebraic development
as did those disclosed in the Ars Magna. The solutions of the cubic and
the quartic were in no sense the result of practical considerations, nor
were they of any value to engineers or mathematical practitioners.
Approximate solutions of some cubic equations had been known in
antiquity, and al-Kashi a century before Cardan could have solved to any
desired degree of accuracy any cubic equation resulting from a practical
problem. The Tartaglia-Cardan formula is of great logical significance,
but it is not nearly so useful for applications as are methods of
successive approximation.</p>
<p>Influence of the Ars Magna</p>
<p>The most important outcome of the discoveries published in the Ars
Magna was the tremendous stimulus they gave to algebraic research in
various directions. It was natural that study should be generalized and
that, in particular, a solution should be sought for the quintic. Here,
mathematicians were faced with an unsolvable algebraic problem
comparable to the classical geometric problems of antiquity. Much good
mathematics, but only a negative conclusion, was the outcome.</p>
<p>Another immediate result of the solution of the cubic was the first
significant glance at a new kind of number. Irrational numbers had been
accepted by the time of Cardan, even though they were not soundly based,
for they are readily approximated by rational numbers. Negative numbers
afforded more difficulty because they are not readily approximated by
positive numbers, but the notion of sense (or direction on a line) made
them plausible. Cardan used them even while calling them numeri ficti.
If an algebraist wished to deny the existence of irrational or negative
numbers, he would simply say, as had the ancient Greeks, that the
equations x2 52 and x1250 are not solvable. In a similar way,
algebraists had been able to avoid imaginaries simply by saying that an
equation such as x2 1150 is not solvable. There was no need for square
roots of negative numbers. With the solution of the cubic equation,
however, the situation became markedly different. Whenever the three
roots of a cubic equation are real and different from zero, the
CardanTartaglia formula inevitably leads to square roots of negative
numbers. The goal was known to be a real number, but it could not be
reached without understanding something about imaginary numbers. The
imaginary now had to be reckoned with, even if one did agree to restrict
oneself to real roots.</p>
