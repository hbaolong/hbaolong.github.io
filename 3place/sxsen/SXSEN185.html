<h4 id="infinite-series">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>The first volume of the Introductio is concerned from start to finish
with infinite processes—infinite products and infinite continued
fractions, as well as innumerable infinite series. In this respect, the
work is the natural generalization of the views of Newton, Leibniz, and
the Bernoullis, all of whom were fond of infinite series. Yet Euler was
surprisingly unrestrained in his use of such series. Although on
occasion he warned against the risk in working with divergent series, he
himself used the binomial series 1/ (1 2x) 511x 1x2 1x3 1 for values of
x. In fact, by combining the two series x/ (1 2x) 5 x 1x2 1x3 1 and x/
(x21)52 113 1 /x 11 /x2 1, Euler concluded that 1/ x2 11/ x11 1x 1x 1x
150.</p>
<p>Despite his hardihood, through manipulations of infinite series Euler
achieved results that had baffled his predecessors. Among these was the
summation of the reciprocals of the perfect squares: 1/12 11/22 1</p>
<p>1/32 11/42 1. Oldenburg, in a letter to Leibniz in 1673, had
asked</p>
<p>F oundat ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>for the sum of this series, but Leibniz failed to answer; in 1689,
Jacques Bernoulli had admitted his own inability to find the sum. Euler
began with the familiar series sin z5z2z3 /3!1z5 /5!2z7 /7!1. Then, sin2
z4 50 canbethoughtofastheinfinitepolynomialequation0512z /3!1z /5! 2z6
/7!1 (obtained by dividing through by2 3 z), or, if z2 is replaced with
w, as the equation 0512w/3!1w /5!2w /7! 1 . From the theory of algebraic
equations it is known, if the constant term is 1, that the sum of the
reciprocals of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the
linear term,inthiscase1/3!.Moreover,therootsoftheequationinzareknownto
be π, 2π, 3π, and so on; hence, the roots of the equation in w are π2,
(2π)2, (3π)2, and so on. Therefore,</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 π21</p>
<p>6 5 π2 1 ð2πÞ2 1 ð3πÞ2 1 or 6 5 1 1 32 1 :</p>
<p>Through this carefree application to polynomials of infinite degree
of algebraic rules valid for the finite case, Euler had achieved a
result that had baffled the older Bernoulli brothers; in later years,
Euler repeatedly made discoveries in similar fashion.</p>
<p>Euler’s summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the integers
seems to date from about 1736, and it is likely that it was to Daniel
Bernoulli that he promptly communicated the result. His interest in such
series always was strong, and in later years, he published the sums of
the reciprocals of other powers of the integers. Using the cosine series
instead of the sine series, Euler similarly found the result</p>
<p>π21</p>
<p>5 1 1 2 1 ;</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>hence the corollary summation</p>
<p>π21</p>
<p>5 2 1 2 2 1 :</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>Many of these results also appeared in the Introductio of 1748,
including the sums of reciprocals of even powers from n52 through n526.
The series of reciprocals of odd powers are so intractable that it is
still not known whether the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of the
positive integers is a rational multiple of π3, whereas Euler knew that
for the 26th power, the sum of the reciprocals is</p>
<p>224U76977927π26</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>1U2U3 27</p>
<p>Convergent and Divergent Series</p>
<p>Euler’s imaginative treatment of series led him to some striking
relationships between analysis and the theory of numbers. He showed, in
a relatively easy proof, that the divergence of the harmonic series
implies the Euclidean theorem on the infinitude of primes. If there were
only K primes, that is, p1, p2,…, pK, then every number n would be of
the form n5pα11pα22…pαKK. Let α be the greatest of the exponents αi for
the number n and form the product</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>P5 11 p1 1 p21 1 1 pα1! 11 p2 1 p22 1 pα2!</p>
<p>1 1 1</p>
<p>11 1 2 1 1 α!:</p>
<p>pK pK pK</p>
<p>In this product, the terms , , , 1n are bound to appear, as well as1
others, hence the product P cannot be smaller than 11 1n. From the
formula for the sum of a geometric progression, we see that the factors
in the product are respectively smaller than</p>
<p>1 1 1</p>
<p>; ; ;</p>
<p>121=p1 121=p2 121=p3</p>
<p>and so on. Hence,</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 p1 p2 p3 p</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 , 1 U 2 U 3 K K</p>
<p>1 2 3 n p 21 p 21 p 21 p 21</p>
<p>for all values of n. Therefore, if K, the number of primes, were
finite, the harmonic series would necessarily be convergent. In a
considerably more involved analysis, Euler showed that the infinite
series made up of the reciprocals of the primes is itself divergent, the
sum Sn being asymptotic to ln ln n for increasing values of the integer
n.</p>
<p>Euler delighted in relationships between the theory of numbers and
his rough-and-ready manipulations of infinite series. Heedless of the
dangers lurking in alternating series, he found such results as
π511112</p>
<p>111121 : Here the sign of a term, after the first two, is determined
as follows: If the denominator is a prime of form 4m11, a minus signis
used;if thedenominatoris a prime of form4m21, a plussign is used; and if
the denominator is a composite number, the signindicated by the product
of the signs of its components is used. Operations on infinite</p>
<p>series were handled with great abandon. From the result ln 1/(12x)5
x1x2 /21x3 /31x4 /41, Euler concluded that lnN 5111</p>
<p>11 , hence that 1=lnN 50512221212 ;</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms and t he Euler Id ent i t ie s</p>
<p>where the last series is made up of all of the reciprocals of primes
(in which case, the terms are taken as negative) and reciprocals of
products of two distinct primes (in which case, the terms are positive).
The Introductio is replete with such series and with related infinite
products, such as 05 U U U U U U U and N 5 U U U U U U U .</p>
