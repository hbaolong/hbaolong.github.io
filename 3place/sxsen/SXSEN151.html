<h4 id="mersennes-communicants">Mersenne’s Communicants</h4>
<p>France was the undisputed mathematical center during the second third
of the seventeenth century. The leading figures were Rene Descartes´
(1596 1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601 1665), but three other
contemporary Frenchmen also made important contributions: Gilles Persone
de Roberval (1602 1675), Girard Desargues (1591 1661), and Blaise Pascal
(1623 1662). The rest of this chapter focuses attention on these men. A
second focal point is provided by the generation following Descartes,
whose members, active in the Low Countries, produced some of the high
points of Cartesian mathematics.</p>
<p>No professional mathematical organizations yet existed, but in Italy,
France, and England, there were loosely organized scientific groups: the
Accademia dei Lincei (to which Galileo belonged) and the Accademia del
Cimento in Italy, the Cabinet DuPuy in France, and the Invisible College
in England. There was in addition an individual who, during the period
we are now considering, served through correspondence as a clearing
house for mathematical information. This was the Minimite friar Marin
Mersenne (1588 1648), a close friend of Descartes’ and Fermat’s, as of
many another mathematician of the time. Had Mersenne lived a century
earlier, the delay in information concerning the solution of the cubic
might not have occurred, for when Mersenne knew something, the whole of
the “Republic of Letters” was shortly informed about it.</p>
<p>Rene Descartes´</p>
<p>Descartes was born in La Haye and received a thorough education at
the Jesuit college at La Fleche, where the textbooks of Clavius were
fun-` damental. Later he took a degree at Poitiers, where he had studied
law, without much enthusiasm. For a number of years, he traveled about
in conjunction with various military campaigns, first in Holland with
Maurice, Prince of Nassau; then with Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria; and
later still with the French army at the siege of La Rochelle. Descartes
was not really a professional soldier, and his brief periods of service
in connection with campaigns were separated by intervals of independent
travel and study, during which he met some of the leading scholars in
various parts of Europe. In Paris, he met Mersenne and a circle of
scientists who freely discussed criticisms of Peripatetic thought; from
such stimulation, Descartes went on to become the “father of modern</p>
<p>Rene Descartes´</p>
<p>philosophy,” to present a changed scientific worldview, and to
establish a new branch of mathematics. In his most celebrated treatise,
the Discours de la me´thode pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher la
ve´rite´ dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method of Reasoning Well
and Seeking Truth in the Sciences) of 1637, he announced his program for
philosophical research. In this he hoped, through systematic doubt, to
reach clear and distinct ideas from which it would then be possible to
deduce innumerably many valid conclusions. This approach to science led
him to assume that everything was explainable in terms of matter (or
extension) and motion. The entire universe, he postulated, was made up
of matter in ceaseless motion in vortices, and all phenomena were to be
explained mechanically in terms of forces exerted by contiguous matter.
Cartesian science enjoyed great popularity for almost a century, but it
then necessarily gave way to the mathematical reasoning of Newton.
Ironically, it was in large part the mathematics of Descartes that later
made possible the defeat of Cartesian science.</p>
<p>Invention of Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>The philosophy and the science of Descartes were almost revolutionary
in their break with the past; his mathematics, by contrast, was linked
with earlier traditions.</p>
<p>Descartes had become seriously interested in mathematics by the time
he spent the cold winter of 1619 with the Bavarian army, where he lay
abed until ten in the morning, thinking out problems. It was during this
early period in his life that he discovered the polyhedral formula that
is usually named for Leonhard Euler: v1f5e12, where v, f, and e are the
number of vertices, faces, and edges, respectively, of a simple
polyhedron. Nine years later, Descartes wrote to a friend in Holland
that he had made such strides in arithmetic and geometry that he had no
more to wish for. Just what the strides were is not known, for Descartes
had published nothing, but the direction of his thoughts is indicated in
a letter of 1628 to his Dutch friend, where he gave a rule for the
construction of the roots of any cubic or quartic equation by means of a
parabola. This is, of course, essentially the type of thing that
Menaechmus had done for the duplication of the cube some 2,000 years
earlier and that Omar Khayyam had carried out for cubics in general
around the year 1100.</p>
<p>Whether Descartes by 1628 was in full possession of his analytic
geometry is not clear, but the effective date for the invention of
Cartesian geometry cannot be much later than that. At this time,
Descartes left France for Holland, where he spent the next twenty years.
Three or four years after he settled down there, another Dutch friend, a
classicist, called his attention to the three-and-four-line problem of
Pappus. Under the mistaken impression that the ancients had been unable
to solve this problem, Descartes applied his new methods to it and
succeeded without difficulty. This made him aware of the power and
generality of his point of view, and he consequently wrote the
well-known work La ge´ome´trie, which made analytic geometry known to
his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Arithmetization of Geometry</p>
<p>La g´eome´trie was not presented to the world as a separate treatise,
but as one of three appendices to the Discours de la me´thode, in which
Descartes thought to give illustrations of his general philosophical
method. The other two appendices were La dioptrique, containing the
first publication of the law of refraction (discovered earlier by
Willebrord Snell), and Les m´ete´ores, which included, among other
things, the first generally satisfactory quantitative explanation of the
rainbow. The original edition of the Discours was published without the
name of the author, but the authorship of the work was generally
known.</p>
<p>Cartesian geometry is now synonymous with analytic geometry, but
Descartes’ fundamental purpose was far removed from that of modern
textbooks. The theme is set by the opening sentence:</p>
<p>Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a
knowledge of the lengths of certain lines is sufficient for its
construction.</p>
<p>As this statement indicates, the goal is generally a geometric
construction and not necessarily the reduction of geometry to algebra.
The work of Descartes is far too often described simply as the
application of algebra to geometry, whereas it actually could be
characterized equally well as the translation of the algebraic
operations into the language of geometry. The very first section of La
g´eome´trie is titled “How the Calculations of Arithmetic Are Related to
the Operations of Geometry.” The second section
describes“HowMultiplication,Division,andtheExtractionofSquareRoots Are
Performed Geometrically.” Here Descartes was doing what had to some
extent been done from the time of al-Khwarizmi to Oughtred—furnishing a
geometric background for the algebraic operations. The five arithmetic
operationsareshowntocorrespondtosimpleconstructionswithstraightedge and
compasses, thus justifying the introduction of arithmetic terms in
geometry.</p>
<p>Descartes was more thorough in his symbolic algebra and in the
geometric interpretation of algebra than any of his predecessors. Formal
algebra had been advancing steadily since the Renaissance, and it found
its culmination in Descartes’ La g´eome´trie, the earliest mathematical
text that a present-day student of algebra can follow without
encountering difficulties in notation. About the only archaic symbol in
the book is the use of instead of 5 for equality. In one essential
respect, he broke from Greek tradition, for instead of considering x2
and x3, for example, as an area and a volume, he also interpreted them
as lines. This permitted him to abandon the principle of homogeneity, at
least explicitly, and yet retain geometric meaning. Descartes could
write an expression such as a2b2 2b, for, as he expressed it, one “must
consider the quantity a2b2 divided once by unity (that is, the unit line
segment), and the quantity b multiplied twice by unity.” It is clear
that Descartes substituted homogeneity in thought for homogeneity in
form, a step that made his geometric algebra more flexible—so flexible
indeed that today we read xx as “x squared” without ever seeing a square
in our mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>Book I includes detailed instructions on the solution of quadratic
equations, not in the algebraic sense of the ancient Babylonians, but
geometrically, somewhat in the manner of the ancient Greeks. To solve
the equation z2 5az1b2, for example, Descartes proceeded as follows.
Draw a line segment LM of length b (Fig. 15.4) and at L erect a segment
NL equal to a/2 and perpendicular to LM. With center N construct a
circle of radius a/2 and draw the line through M and N intersecting the
circle at O and P. Then, z5OM is the line desired. (Descartes ignored
the root PM of the equation because it is “false,” that is, negative.)
Similar constructions are given for z2 5az2b2 and for z2 1az5b2, the
only other quadratic equations with positive roots.</p>
<p>Having shown how algebraic operations, including the solution of
quadratics, are interpreted geometrically, Descartes turned to the
application of algebra to determine geometric problems, formulating far
more clearly than the Renaissance cossists the general approach:</p>
<p>If, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution
already effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful for
its</p>
<p>construction to those that are unknown as well as to those that are
known. Then, making no distinction between known and unknown lines, we
must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows most naturally the
relations between these lines, until we find it possible to express a
single quantity in two ways. This will constitute an equation (in a
single unknown), since the terms of the one of these two expressions are
together equal to the terms of the other.</p>
<p>Throughout Books I and III of La ge´ome´trie, Descartes is primarily
concerned with this type of geometric problem, in which the final
algebraic equation can contain only one unknown quantity. Descartes was
well aware that it was the degree of this resulting algebraic equation
that determined the geometric means by which the required geometric
construction can be carried out.</p>
<p>If it can be solved by ordinary geometry, that is, by the use of
straight lines and circles traced on a plane surface, when the last
equation shall have been entirely solved there will remain at most only
the square of an unknown quantity, equal to the product of its root by
some known quantity, increased or diminished by some other quantity also
known.</p>
<p>Here we see a clear-cut statement that what the Greeks had called
“plane problems” lead to nothing worse than a quadratic equation.
Because Viete had already shown that the duplication of the cube and the
tri-` section of the angle lead to cubic equations, Descartes stated,
with inadequate proof, that these cannot be solved with straightedge and
compasses. Of the three ancient problems, therefore, only the squaring
of the circle remained open to question.</p>
<p>The title La ge´ome´trie should not mislead one into thinking that
the treatise is primarily geometric. Already in the Discourse, to which
the Geometry had been appended, Descartes had discussed the relative
merits of algebra and geometry, without being partial to either. He
charged the latter with relying too heavily on diagrams that
unnecessarily fatigue the imagination, and he stigmatized the former as
being a confused and obscure art that embarrasses the mind. The aim of
his method, therefore, was twofold: (1) through algebraic procedure to
free geometry from the use of diagrams and (2) to give meaning to the
operations of algebra through geometric interpretation. Descartes was
convinced that all mathematical sciences proceed from the same basic
principles, and he decided to use the best of each branch. His procedure
in La g´eome´trie, then, was to begin with a geometric problem, to
convert it to the language of an algebraic equation, and then, having
simplified the equation as far as possible, to solve this equation
geometrically, in a manner similar to that which he had used for the
quadratics.</p>
<p>Classification of Curves</p>
<p>Descartes was much impressed by the power of his method in handling
the three- and four-line locus, so he moved on to generalizations of
this problem—aproblemthatrunslikeathreadofAriadnethroughthethreebooks of
La ge´ome´trie. He knew that Pappus had been unable to tell anything
about the loci when the number of lines was increased to six or eight or
more, so Descartes proceeded to study such cases. He was aware that for
five or six lines the locus is a cubic, for seven or eight it is a
quartic, and so on. But Descartes showed no real interest in the shapes
of these loci, for he was obsessed with the question of the means needed
to construct geometrically the ordinates corresponding to given
abscissas. For five lines, for
example,heremarkedtriumphantlythatiftheyarenotallparallel,thenthe locus
is elementary in the sense that given a value for x, the line
representingyisconstructiblebyrulerandcompassalone.Iffourofthelinesare
parallel and equal distances a apart and the fifth is perpendicular to
the others (Fig. 15.5), and if the constant of proportionality in the
Pappus problem is taken as this same constant a, then the locus is given
by (a1x) (a2x)(2a2x)5axy, a cubic that Newton later called the Cartesian
parabolaortrident:x3 22ax2 2a2x12a3 5axy.Thiscurvecomesuprepeatedly in
La g´eome´trie, yet Descartes at no point gave a complete sketch of it.
His interest in the curve was threefold: (1) deriving its equation as a
Pappus locus, (2) showing its generation through the motion of curves of
lower degree, and (3) using it in turn to construct the roots of
equations of higher degree.</p>
<p>Descartes considered the trident constructible by plane means alone,
inasmuch as, for each point x on the axis of abscissas, the ordinate y
can be drawn with only ruler and compass. This is not, in general,
possible for five or more lines taken at random in the Pappus problem.
In the case</p>
<p>of not more than eight lines, the locus is a polynomial in x and y
such that for a given point on the x-axis, the construction of the
corresponding ordinate y requires the geometric solution of a cubic or
quartic equation, which, as we have seen, usually calls for the use of
conic sections. For not more than twelve lines in the Pappus problem,
the locus is a polynomial in x and y of not more than the sixth degree,
and the construction in general requires curves beyond the conic
sections. Here Descartes made an important advance beyond the Greeks in
problems of geometric constructibility. The ancients had never really
legitimized constructions that made use of curves other than straight
lines or circles, although they sometimes reluctantly recognized, as
Pappus did, the classes that they called solid problems and linear
problems. The second category in particular was a catchall class of
problems with no real standing.</p>
<p>Descartes now took the step of specifying an orthodox classification
of determinate geometric problems. Those that lead to quadratic
equations, and can therefore be constructed by lines and circles, he
placed in class one; those leading to cubic and quartic equations, the
roots of which can be constructed by means of conic sections, he placed
in class two; those leading to equations of degree five or six can be
constructed by introducing a cubic curve, such as the trident or the
higher parabola y5x3, and these he placed in class three. Descartes
continued in this manner, grouping geometric problems and algebraic
equations into classes, assuming that the construction of the roots of
an equation of degree 2n or 2n21 was a problem of class n.</p>
<p>The Cartesian classification by pairs of degrees seemed to be
confirmed by algebraic considerations. It was known that the solution of
the quartic was reducible to that of the resolvent cubic, and Descartes
extrapolated prematurely to assume that the solution of an equation of
degree 2n can be reduced to that of a resolvent equation of degree 2n21.
Many years later, it was shown that Descartes’ tempting generalization
does not hold. But his work did have the salutary effect of encouraging
the relaxation of the rules on constructibility so that higher plane
curves might be used.</p>
<p>Rectification of Curves</p>
<p>It will be noted that the Cartesian classification of geometric
problems included some, but not all, of those that Pappus had lumped
together as “linear.” In introducing the new curves that he needed for
geometric constructions beyond the fourth degree, Descartes added to the
usual axioms of geometry one more axiom:</p>
<p>Two or more lines (or curves) can be moved, one upon the other,
determining by their intersection other curves.</p>
<p>This in itself is not unlike what the Greeks had actually done in
their kinematic generation of curves such as the quadratrix, the
cissoid, the conchoid, and the spiral. But whereas the ancients had
lumped these together, Descartes now carefully distinguished between
those, such as the cissoid and the conchoid, that we should call
algebraic, and others, such as the quadratrix and the spiral, that are
now known as transcendental. To the first type, Descartes gave
full-fledged geometric status, along with the line, the circle, and the
conics, calling all of these the “geometric curves”; the second type he
ruled out of geometry entirely, stigmatizing them as “mechanical
curves.” The basis on which Descartes made this decision was “exactness
of reasoning.” Mechanical curves, he said, “must be conceived of as
described by two separate movements whose relation does not admit of
exact determination”—such as the ratio of circumference to diameter of a
circle in the case of the motions describing the quadratrix and the
spiral. In other words, Descartes thought of algebraic curves as exactly
described and of transcendental curves as inexactly described, for the
latter are generally defined in terms of arc lengths. On this matter he
wrote, in La ge´ome´trie:</p>
<p>Geometry should not include lines (or curves) that are like strings,
in that they are sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the
ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and I believe
cannot be discovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based
upon such ratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact.</p>
<p>Descartes here is simply reiterating the dogma, suggested by
Aristotle and affirmed by Averroe¨s (Ibn Rushd, 1126 1198), that no
algebraic curve can be exactly rectified. Interestingly enough, in 1638,
the year after the publication of La ge´ome´trie, Descartes ran across a
“mechanical” curve that turned out to be rectifiable. Through Mersenne,
Galileo’s representative in France, the question, raised in The Two New
Sciences, of the path of fall of an object on a rotating earth (assuming
the earth permeable) was widely discussed, and this led Descartes to the
equiangular or logarithmic spiral r5aebθ as the possible path. Had
Descartes not been so firm in his rejection of such nongeometric curves,
he might have anticipated Torricelli in discovering, in 1645, the first
modern rectification of a curve. Torricelli showed, by infinitesimal
methods that he had learned from Archimedes, Galileo, and Cavalieri,
that the total length of the logarithmic spiral from θ50 as it winds
backward about the pole O is exactly equal to the length of the polar
tangent PT (Fig. 15.6) at the point for which θ50. This striking result
did not, of course, disprove the Cartesian doctrine of the
nonrectifiability of algebraic curves. In fact, Descartes could have
asserted not only that the curve was not exactly determined, being
mechanical, but also that the arc of the curve has an asymptotic point
at the pole, which it never reaches.</p>
<p>Identification of Conics</p>
<p>Virtually the whole of La ge´ome´trie is devoted to a thoroughgoing
application of algebra to geometry and of geometry to algebra, but there
is little in the treatise that resembles what usually is thought of
today as analytic geometry. There is nothing systematic about
rectangular coordinates, for oblique ordinates are usually taken for
granted; hence, there are no formulas for distance, slope, point of
division, angle between two lines, or other similar introductory
material. Moreover, in the whole of the work there is not a single new
curve plotted directly from its equation, and the author took so little
interest in curve sketching that he never fully understood the meaning
of negative coordinates. He knew in a general sort of way that negative
ordinates are directed in a sense opposite to that taken as positive,
but he never made use of negative abscissas. Moreover, the fundamental
principle of analytic geometry—the discovery that indeterminate
equations in two unknowns correspond to loci—does not appear until the
second book, and then only somewhat incidentally.</p>
<p>The solution of any one of these problems of loci is nothing more
than the finding of a point for whose complete determination one
condition is wanting. … In every such case an equation can be obtained
containing two unknown quantities.</p>
<p>In one case only did Descartes examine a locus in detail, and this
was in connection with the three- and four-line locus problem of Pappus,
for which Descartes derived the equation y2 5ay 2bxy1cx2dx2. This is the
general equation of a conic passing through the origin; even though the
literal coefficients are understood to be positive, this is by far the
most comprehensive approach ever made to the analysis of the family of
conic sections. Descartes indicated conditions on the coefficients for
which the conic is a straight line, a parabola, an ellipse, or a
hyperbola, the analysis being in a sense equivalent to a recognition of
the characteristic of the equation of the conic. The author knew that by
a proper choice of the origin and the axes, the simplest form of the
equation is obtained, but he did not give any of the canonical forms.
The omission of much of the elementary detail made the work exceedingly
difficult for his contemporaries to follow. In concluding remarks,
Descartes sought to justify his inadequacy of exposition by the
incongruous assertion that he had left much unsaid in order not to rob
the reader of the joy of discovery.</p>
<p>Inadequate though the exposition is, it is Book II of La ge´ometrie´
that comes closest to modern views of analytic geometry. There is even a
statement of a fundamental principle of solid analytic geometry:</p>
<p>If two conditions for the determination of a point are lacking, the
locus of the point is a surface.</p>
<p>Yet, Descartes did not give any illustrations of such equations or
expand the brief hint of analytic geometry of three dimensions.</p>
<p>Normals and Tangents</p>
<p>Descartes was so fully aware of the significance of his work that he
regarded it as bearing to ancient geometry somewhat the same
relationship as the rhetoric of Cicero bears to the ABC’s of children.
His mistake, from our point of view, was in emphasizing determinate
equations, rather than indeterminate equations. He realized that all of
the properties of a curve, such as the magnitude of its area or the
direction of its tangent, are fully determined when an equation in two
unknowns is given, but he did not take full advantage of this
recognition. He wrote,</p>
<p>I shall have given here a sufficient introduction to the study of
curves when I shall have given a general method of drawing a straight
line making right angles with a curve at an arbitrarily chosen point
upon it. And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most
general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever
desired to know.</p>
<p>Descartes was quite right that the problem of finding the normal (or
the tangent) to a curve was of great importance, but the method that he
published in La ge´ome´trie was less expeditious than that which Fermat
had developed at about the same time.</p>
<p>Book II of La g´eome´trie also contains much material on the “ovals
of Descartes,” which are very useful in optics and are obtained by
generalizing the “gardener’s method” for constructing an ellipse by
means of strings. If D1 and D2 are the distances of a variable point P
from two fixed points F1 and F2, respectively, and if m and n are
positive integers and K is any positive constant, then the locus of P
such that mD11 nD2 5K is now known as an oval of Descartes, but the
author did not use the equations of the curves. Descartes realized that
his methods can be extended to “all those curves which can be conceived
of as generated by the regular movement of the points of a body in
three-dimensional space,” but he did not carry out any details. The
sentence with which Book II concludes, “And so I think I have omitted
nothing essential to an understanding of curved lines,” is presumptuous
indeed.</p>
<p>The third and last book of La ge´ome´trie resumes the topic of Book
I: the construction of the roots of determinate equations. Here the
author warns that in such constructions, “We should always choose with
care the simplest curve that can be used in the solution of a problem.”
This means, of course, that one must be fully aware of the nature of the
roots of the equation under consideration, and in particular one must
know whether the equation is reducible. For this reason, Book III is
virtually a course in the elementary theory of equations. It tells how
to discover rational roots, if any; how to depress the degree of the
equation when a root is known; how to increase and decrease the roots of
an equation by any amount or to multiply or divide them by a number; how
to eliminate the second term; how to determine the number of possible
“true” and “false” roots (that is, positive and negative roots) through
the well-known “Descartes’ rule of signs”; and how to find the algebraic
solution of cubic and quartic equations. In closing, the author reminds
the reader that he has given the simplest constructions possible for
problems in the various classes mentioned earlier. In particular, the
trisection of the angle and the duplication of the cube are in class
two, requiring more than circles and lines for their construction.</p>
<p>Descartes’ Geometric Concepts</p>
<p>Our account of Descartes’ analytic geometry should make clear how far
removed the author’s thought was from the practical considerations that
are now so often associated with the use of coordinates. He did not lay
down a coordinate frame to locate points as a surveyor or a geographer
might do, nor were his coordinates thought of as number pairs. In this
respect, the phrase “Cartesian product,” so often used today, is an
anachronism. La ge´ome´trie was in its day just as much a triumph of
impractical theory as was the Conics of Apollonius in antiquity, despite
the inordinately useful role that both were ultimately destined to play.
Moreover, the use of oblique coordinates was much the same in both
cases, thus confirming that the origin of modern analytic geometry lies
in antiquity, rather than in the medieval latitude of forms. The
coordinates of Oresme, which influenced Galileo, are closer, both in
motive and in appearance, to the modern point of view than are those of
Apollonius and Descartes. Even if Descartes was familiar with Oresme’s
graphical representation of functions, and this is not evident, there is
nothing in Cartesian thought to indicate that he would have seen any
similarity between the purpose of the latitude of forms and his own
classification of geometric constructions. The theory of functions
ultimately profited greatly from the work of Descartes, but the notion
of a form or a function played no apparent role in leading to Cartesian
geometry.</p>
<p>In terms of mathematical ability, Descartes was probably the most
able thinker of his day, but he was at heart not really a mathematician.
His geometry was only an episode in a life devoted to science and
philosophy, and although occasionally in later years he contributed to
mathematics through correspondence, he left no other great work in this
field. In 1649, he accepted an invitation from Queen Christina of Sweden
to instruct her in philosophy and to establish an academy of sciences in
Stockholm. Descartes had never enjoyed robust health, and the rigors of
a Scandinavian winter were too much for him; he died early in 1650.</p>
