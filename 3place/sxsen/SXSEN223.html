<h4 id="post-riemannian-algebraic-geometry">Post-Riemannian Algebraic
Geometry</h4>
<p>There were several new approaches to geometry toward the end of the
century that are usually classified as versions of algebraic geometry.
These had a common basis in the work of Riemann. Rather than Riemann’s
explicitly geometric publications, it was his work on complex function
theory, especially as linked to the concept of a Riemann surface in a
classic paper on Abelian functions, that provided the stimulus for most
of these investigations.</p>
<p>Initially, Alfred Clebsch (1833 1872) did more than anyone else to
exploit Riemann’s function theory for geometric purposes. Clebsch, a
mathematical grandson of Jacobi via the geometer Otto Hesse (1811 1874),
had studied in Ko¨nigsberg, where he came under the influence of the
mathematical physicist Franz Neumann. His teaching career took him from
the polytechnic high school in Karlsruhe to Giessen, where he spent five
years, before being called to Go¨ttingen. In 1868, he and Franz
Neumann’s son, Carl (1832 1925), cofounded the journal Mathematische
Annalen.</p>
<p>Clebsch first called attention to our subject in a paper “On the
Application of Abelian Functions to Geometry,” which appeared in the
Journal fu¨r die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This was the beginning
of a triply oriented attack. Clebsch initially set out simply to apply
Riemann’s theory of complex functions to the study of algebraic curves.
He was well equipped to carry this out; he was familiar with the
previous work of the complex projective geometers, with the Jacobi
tradition of Abelian function theory, and with Riemann’s papers. He
obtained many fruitful results, which laid the basis for further
research. For example, he obtained a classification of curves by genus
and also considered subclasses of curves having the same genus but
different branching points.</p>
<p>Another approach was used in work that Clebsch did in collaboration
with Paul Gordan (1837 1912) of Erlangen. In a book of 1866, the Theorie
der Abelschen Functionen, they set out to reestablish the theory of
Abelian functions on the basis of algebraic geometry. Gordan is
remembered as a champion of nineteenth-century invariant theory, and we
note in this context that the turn-of-the-century school of Italian
geometers, which included Guido Castelnuovo (1865 1952), Federigo
Enriques (1871 1946), and, somewhat later, Francesco Severi (1879 1961),
relied heavily on invariants as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Clebsch turned to surfaces. He introduced double integrals,
hoping to obtain results by exploring the analogy with the Abelian
integrals applied to the study of curves. He, along with Cayley, Max
Noether (1844 1921), and the Danish mathematician H. G. Zeuthen (1839
1920), was successful for a large number of cases. Their work
wascontinuedbyE´milePicard,aspecialistinthestudyofdoubleintegrals. His
research was the basis for later results by Beppo Levi (1875 1928).
Yetbecauseofthecomplicatednatureofmanysurfaces,thisapproachwas less
successful than was initially hoped for.</p>
<p>The most active direction followed was that in which geometers
applied birational transformations to the study of curves. Many of
them</p>
<p>Po s t Rie mannian Algebraic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>put their studies in Riemannian terms by noting that Riemann’s moduli
are simply birational invariants. Despite much activity by
mathematicians in the main European centers, the results eventually
seemed disappointing. By the 1920s, most of these “algebro-geometric”
efforts began to take a backseat to a purely algebraic approach, which
dominated algebraic geometry for several decades, while increasing in
generality and abstractness.</p>

<p>It is no paradox to say that in our most theoretical moods we may be
nearest to our most practical applications.</p>
