<h4 id="incommensurability">Incommensurability</h4>
<p>Book X of the Elements was, before the advent of early modern
algebra, the most admired—and the most feared. It is concerned with a
systematic classification of incommensurable line segments of the forms
a6pb; pa6pb; a6pb and pa6pb, where a and b, when of the same dimension,
are commensurable. Today, we would be inclinedp p to think of this as a
book on irrational numbers of the types above, where a and b are
rational numbers, but Euclid regarded this book as a part of geometry,
rather than of arithmetic. In fact, Propositions 2 and 3 of the book
duplicate for geometric magnitudes the first two propositions of Book
VII, where the author had dealt with whole numbers. Here he proves that
if to two unequal line segments one applies the process described
previously as Euclid’s algorithm, and if the remainder never measures
the one before it, the magnitudes are incommensurable. Proposition 3
shows that the algorithm, when applied to two commensurable magnitudes,
will provide the greatest common measure of the segments.</p>
<p>Book X contains 115 propositions—more than any other—most of which
contain geometric equivalents of what we now know arithmetically as
surds. Among the theorems are counterparts of rationalizing denominators
of fractions of the form a=ðb6pcÞ and a=ðpb6pcÞ:</p>
<p>Line segments given by square roots, or by square roots of sums of
square roots, are about as easily constructed by straightedge and
compasses as are rational combinations. One reason that the Greeks
turned to a geometric, rather than an arithmetic, algebra was that in
view of the lack of the real-number concept, the former appeared to be
more general than the latter. The roots of ax2x2 5b2, for example, can
always be constructed (provided that a.2b). Why, then, should Euclid
have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, in Propositions 17 and 18 of
Book X, the conditions under which the roots of this equation are
commensurable with a? He showed that the roots are commensurable or
incommensurable, with respect to a, according as pa2 24b2 and a are
commensurable or incommensurable. It has been suggested that such
considerations indicate that the Greeks also used their solutions of
quadratic equations for numerical problems, much as the Babylonians had
in their system of equations x1y5a, xy5b2. In such cases, it would be
advantageous to know whether the roots will or will not be expressible
as quotients of integers. A close study of Greek mathematics seems to
give evidence that beneath the geometric veneer, there was more concern
for logistic and numerical approximations than the surviving classical
treatises portray.</p>
<p>Solid Geometry</p>
<p>The material in Book XI, containing thirty-nine propositions on the
geometry of three dimensions, will be largely familiar to one who has
taken a course in the elements of solid geometry. Again, the definitions
are easily criticized, for Euclid defines a solid as “that which has
length, breadth, and depth” and then tells us that “an extremity of a
solid is a surface.” The last four definitions are of four of the
regular solids. The tetrahedron is not included, presumably because of
an earlier definition of a pyramid as “a solid figure, contained by
planes, which is constructed from one plane to any point.” The eighteen
propositions of Book XII are all related to the measurement of figures,
using the method of exhaustion. The book opens with a careful proof of
the theorem that areas of circles are to each other as squares on the
diameters. Similar applications of the typical double reductio ad
absurdum method are then applied to the volumetric mensuration of
pyramids, cones, cylinders, and spheres. Archimedes ascribed the
rigorous proofs of these theorems to Eudoxus, from whom Euclid probably
adapted much of this material.</p>
<p>The last book is devoted entirely to properties of the five regular
solids. The closing theorems are a fitting climax to a remarkable
treatise. Their object is to “comprehend” each of the regular solids in
a sphere— that is, to find the ratio of an edge of the solid to the
radius of the circumscribed sphere. Such computations are ascribed by
Greek commentators to Theaetetus, to whom much of Book XIII is probably
due. In preliminaries to these computations, Euclid referred once more
to the division of a line in mean and extreme ratio, showing that “the
square on the greater segment added to half the whole is five times the
square on the half”—as is easily verified by solving a/x5x/(a2x)—and
citing other properties of the diagonals of a regular pentagon. Then, in
Proposition 10, Euclid proved the well-known theorem that a triangle
whose sides are respectively sides of an equilateral pentagon, hexagon,
and decagon inscribed in the same circle is a right triangle.
Propositions 13 through 17 express the ratio of edge to diameter for
each of thepp inscribed regular solids in turn:pp13 Þ p e/d is for the
tetrahedron,p þ p for the octahedron, for the cube or hexahedron, (5 5)
10= for the icosahedron, and ð 521 =2 3 for the dodecahedron. Finally,
in Proposition 18, the last in the Elements, it is easily proved that
there can be no regular polyhedron beyond these five. About 1,900 years
later, the astronomer Kepler was so struck by this fact that he built a
cosmology on the five regular solids, believing that they must have been
the Creator’s key to the structure of the heavens.</p>
<p>Apocrypha</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was not uncommon to attribute to a celebrated
author works that were not by him; thus, some versions of Euclid’s
Elements include a fourteenth and even a fifteenth book, both shown by
later scholars to be apocryphal. The so-called Book XIV continues
Euclid’s comparison of the regular solids inscribed in a sphere, the
chief results being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron
and the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the
ratio of their volumes, the ratio being that of the edge of the cube to
the edge of the icosahedron, that is, 10 〔3(5= p5)〕. This book may
have been composed by Hypsicles (fl. ca. 150p BCE) on the basis of a
treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and the
icosahedron. Hypsicles is also the author of an astronomical work, De
ascensionibus, an adaptation for the latitude of Alexandria of a
Babylonian technique for computing the rise times of the signs of the
zodiac; this work also contains the division of the ecliptic into 360
degrees.</p>
<p>The spurious Book XV, which is inferior, is thought to have been (at
least in part) the work of a student of Isidore of Miletus’s (fl. ca.
532 CE), the architect of the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. This book
also deals with the regular solids, showing how to inscribe certain of
them within others, counting the number of edges and solid angles in the
solids, and finding the measures of the dihedral angles of faces meeting
at an edge. It is of interest to note that despite such enumerations,
all of the ancients apparently missed the so-called polyhedral formula,
known to Rene´ Descartes and later enunciated by Leonhard Euler.</p>
<p>Influence of the Elements</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid was composed in about 300 BCE and was copied
and recopied repeatedly after that. Errors and variations inevitably
crept in, and some later editors, notably Theon of Alexandria in the
late fourth century, sought to improve on the original. Later
accretions, generally appearing as scholia, add supplementary
information, often of a historical nature, and in most cases they are
readily distinguished from the original. The transmission of
translations from Greek to Latin, starting with Boethius, has been
traced in some detail. Numerous copies of the Elements have also come
down to us through Arabic translations, later turned into Latin, largely
in the twelfth century, and finally, in the sixteenth century, into the
vernacular. The study of transmission of these variants presents
continuing challenges.</p>
<p>The first printed version of the Elements appeared at Venice in 1482,
one of the very earliest of mathematical books to be set in type. It has
been estimated that since then, at least a thousand editions have been
published. Perhaps no book other than the Bible can boast so many
editions, and, certainly, no mathematical work has had an influence
comparable to that of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
