<h4 id="lagrange">Lagrange</h4>
<p>Educated in Turin, as a young man Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736</p>
<ol start="1813" type="1">
<li>became a professor of mathematics in the military academy of Turin,
but later he found successive royal patrons in Frederick the Great of
Prussia and Louis XVI of France.</li>
</ol>
<p>If Carnot and Legendre were disciples of clear and rigorous thought,
Lagrange was the high priest of the cult. He had published his
Mecanique´ analytique (1788), as well as frequent papers on algebra,
analysis, and geometry, before the revolution. At the height of the
Terror, Lagrange had thought seriously of leaving France, but just at
this critical juncture, the E´cole Normale and the E´cole Polytechnique
were established, and Lagrange was invited to lecture on analysis.
Lagrange seems to have welcomed the opportunity to teach. The new
curriculum called for new lecture notes, and these Lagrange supplied for
various levels. For students at the E´cole Normale in 1795, he prepared
and delivered lectures that today would be appropriate for a high school
class in advanced algebra or for a course in college algebra; the
material in these notes enjoyed a popularity that extended to America,
where they were published as Lectures on Elementary Mathematics. For
scholars on the higher level of the E´cole Polytechnique, Lagrange
lectured on analysis and prepared what has ever since been regarded as a
classic in mathematics. The results, in his Theorie des fonctions
analytiques´ , appeared in</p>
<p>L a grange</p>
<p>the same year as Carnot’s Reflexions´ , and together they make 1797 a
banner year for the rise of rigor.</p>
<p>Theory of Functions</p>
<p>Lagrange’s function theory, which developed some ideas that he had
presented in a paper about twenty-five years earlier, certainly was not
useful in the narrower sense, for the notation of the differential was
far more expeditious and suggestive than the Lagrangian “derived
function,” from which our name “derivative” comes. The whole motive of
the work was not to try to make the calculus more utilitarian but to
make it more logically satisfying. The key idea is easy to describe. The
function f(x)51/(12x), when expanded by long division, yields the
infinite series 111x11x2 11x3 111xn 1. If the coefficient of xn is
multiplied by n!, Lagrange called the result the value of the nth
derived function of f(x) for the point x50, with suitable modification
for expansions of functions about other points. To this work by
Lagrange, we owe the commonly used notation for derivatives of various
orders, fu(x), fv(x),…, f (n)(x)…. Lagrange thought that through the use
of this device, he had eliminated the need for limits or infinitesimals,
although he continued to use the latter side by side with his derived
functions. But, alas, there are flaws in his fine new scheme. Not every
function can be so expanded, for there were lapses in Lagrange’s
putative proof of the expandability; moreover, the question of the
convergence of the infinite series brings back the need for the limit
concept. Yet the work of Lagrange during the revolution can be said to
have had a broader influence through the initiation of a new subject
that has ever since been a center of attention in mathematics—the theory
of functions of a real variable.</p>
<p>Calculus of Variations</p>
<p>Lagrange’s first and perhaps his greatest contribution is the
calculus of variations. This was a new branch of mathematics, the name
of which originated from notations used by Lagrange from about 1760 on.
In its simplest form, the subject seeks to determine a functional
relationship y5f(x) such that an integral bagðx;yÞdx shall be a maximum
or a minimum. Problems of isoperimetry or of quickest descent are
specialÐ cases in the calculus of variations. In 1755, Lagrange had
written to Euler about the general methods that he had developed for
handling problems of this type, and Euler generously held up publication
of somewhat related work of his own, in order that the younger man
should receive full credit for the newer methods that Euler regarded as
superior.</p>
<p>From the time of his first publications in the Miscellanea of the
Turin Academy in 1759 1761, the reputation of Lagrange was
established.</p>
<p>When, in 1766, Euler and d’Alembert advised Frederick the Great on
Euler’s successor at the Berlin Academy, they both urged the appointment
of Lagrange. Frederick then presumptuously wrote to Lagrange that it was
necessary that the greatest geometer of Europe should live near the
greatest of kings. Lagrange assented; he remained in Berlin for twenty
years, leaving only after Frederick’s death, three years before the
start of the French Revolution.</p>
<h2 id="algebra">Algebra</h2>
<p>It was during his days at the Berlin Academy that Lagrange published
important memoirs on mechanics, the three-body problem, his early ideas
on derived functions, and influential work on the theory of equations.
In 1767, he published a memoir on the approximation of roots of
polynomial equations by means of continued fractions; in another paper
in 1770, he considered the solvability of equations in terms of
permutations on their roots. The latter work would lead to the
enormously successful theory of groups and to the proofs by E´variste
Galois and Niels Henrik Abel of the insolvability, in the usual terms,
of equations of a degree greater than four. Today the name of Lagrange
is attached to what is perhaps the most important theorem of group
theory: if o is the order of a subgroup g of a group G of order O, then
o is a factor of O. Finding that a resolvent of a quintic equation, far
from being of a degree less than five, as one should have expected, was
a sextic, Lagrange conjectured that polynomial equations above the
fourth degree are not solvable in the usual sense.</p>
<p>Lagrange Multipliers</p>
<p>Ever on the lookout for generality and elegance in the treatment of
problems, Lagrange was responsible for the method of variation of
parameters in the solution of nonhomogeneous linear differential
equations. That is, if c1u1 1c2u2 is a general solution of yv 1a1yu
1a2y50 (where u1 and u2 are functions of x), he replaced the parameters
c1 and c2 with undetermined variables v1 and v2 (functions of x) and
determined the latter so that v1u1 1v2u2, should be a solution of yv
1a1yu 1a2y5f(x). In the determination of maxima and minima of a function
such as f(x, y, z, w) subject to constraints g(x, y, z, w)5 0 and h(x,
y, z, w)50, he suggested the use of Lagrange multipliers to provide an
elegant and symmetric algorithm. Under this method, one introduces two
undetermined constants λ and μ; forms the function F5f1λg1μh from
the</p>
<p>six equations Fx 50, Fy 50, FZ 50, Fw 50, g50, and h50; eliminates
the multipliers λ and μ; and solves for the desired values of x, y, z,
and w.</p>
