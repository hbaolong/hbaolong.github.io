<h4 id="grassmann-and-ausdehnungslehre">Grassmann and
Ausdehnungslehre</h4>
<p>The concept of an n-dimensional vector space had received detailed
treatment in Hermann Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, published in
Germany</p>
<p>Gra s smann and Ausdehnungslehre</p>
<p>in 1844. Grassmann (1809 1877), a secondary schoolteacher, was also
led to his results by studying the geometric interpretation of negative
quantities and the addition and the multiplication of directed line
segments in two and three dimensions. He emphasized the dimension
concept and stressed the development of an abstract science of “spaces”
and “subspaces” that would include the geometry of two and three
dimensions as special cases. It is interesting to note that Grassmann,
like Hamilton, was a linguist, being a specialist in Sanskrit
literature. His father, Justus Grassmann, had belonged to the so-called
combinatorial school of German mathematicians at the beginning of the
century. This undoubtedly affected his views on the nature of
mathematics. Grassmann defined pure
mathematicsasthescienceofforms(Formenlehre),stressingthedifference
between this view and that which regards mathematics merely as the
science ofquantities. The concepts basic to his science of forms are
those of equality and combination, which he denoted by5and -,
respectively. He defined the inverse,,of -, by stating that a,b is the
form that satisfies a,b-b5b-a. The science of extension is “the abstract
foundation of geometry,” freed from spatial conceptualizations and
restriction to three dimensions. A single element generates a
one-dimensional space (einstufiges System); the set of elements derived
from a given element by a constant change gives a two-dimensional space,
corresponding to lines in geometry. Generally,</p>
<p>ifall elements ofann-dimensionaldomain are subjected toone and the
same kind of change which leads to new elements (not contained in the
domain), then the totality of the elements generated by this change and
its inverse is called a domain of dimension n11.</p>
<p>This definition was made more precise in the revised 1862 edition of
Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, where he elaborated on the concepts of
linear dependence and independence of vectors and discussed subspaces,
their unions and intersections, and spanning sets. He also stated
theorems equivalent to the proposition that if S and T are two subspaces
of a vector space V, then d〔S〕1d〔T〕5d〔S,T〕1d〔S-T〕, where d〔S〕
represents the dimension of S, and S,T, S-T the union and the
intersection of S and T, respectively.</p>
<p>Grassmann laid great stress on the different kinds of multiplication
that arose in the Ausdehnungslehre. He distinguished between “inner” and
“outer” or “combinatorial” products. In the particular case treated by
Hamilton, these reduce to the latter’s scalar and vector products. Other
types of multiplication treated by Grassmann included “algebraic”
products, namely, those where ab2ba, as in common algebra, and “outer”
products, which correspond to matrix products. One could translate many
details of Grassmann’s work into the language of modern abstract vector
space theory; suffice it to say that using the basic concepts cited
previously, Grassmann showed how an n-dimensional system containing
various new operations could be established, which for special cases
reduced to more familiar mathematical structures.</p>
<p>The significance of the Ausdehnungslehre was slow to be recognized,
for the book was not only unconventional but difficult to read. One
reason was that Grassmann, like Desargues before him, used a very
unconventional terminology; more fundamental was the novelty and extreme
generality of the author’s approach to the question of extension.</p>
<p>Largely under the urging of Mo¨bius, Grassmann not only revised the
Ausdehnungslehre but also published various articles in Crelle’s
Journal, in which he summarized some of his basic results. It was
through these articles that most mathematicians became acquainted with
the substance of his work.</p>
<p>Word of the Ausdehnungslehre began to spread after the publication in
1867 of Hermann Hankel’s work on systems of complex numbers.</p>
<p>Hankel,astudentofRiemann’s,attemptedtopresentarigorousintroduction to
complex numbers. His work, which reflected study of Grassmann, referred
to Peacock, gave the first German account of Hamilton’s quaternions, and
presented a theory of “alternating numbers” equivalent to Grassmann’s
outer products. Among those whose attention was drawn to Grassmann’s
work through Hankel’s book was Felix Klein. He wrote to F. Engel in
1911:</p>
<p>As is well known, Grassmann in his Ausdehnungslehre is an affine,
rather than a projective, geometer. This became clear to me in the late
fall of 1871 and (besides the study of Mo¨bius and Hamilton and the
working out of all the impressions I had received in Paris) led to my
conception of my later Erlanger Program.</p>
<p>In England, William K. Clifford championed Grassmann’s cause; in the
United States, the Ausdehnungslehre supported the development, primarily
through the efforts of a Yale University physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs
(1839 1903), of the more limited algebra of vectors in threedimensional
space. The algebra of vectors is again a multiple algebra in which the
commutative law for multiplication fails to hold. In fact, it was proved
in 1867 by Hankel that the algebra of complex numbers is, as De Morgan
suspected, the most general algebra that is possible under the
fundamental laws of arithmetic. The Vector Analysis of Gibbs appeared in
1881 and again in 1884, and he published further articles during the
decade. These works led to a spirited and not-too-genteel controversy
with the
proponentsofquaternionsovertherelativemeritsofthetwoalgebras.In1895,a
colleague of Gibbs’s at Yale organized an International Association for
Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics, of
which the first president was a rabid supporter of quaternions. It was
not long before allied systems (such as vectors and their
generalization, tensors) for a time eclipsed quaternions, but today they
have a recognized</p>
<p>C ay le y and S y l v e s t er</p>
<p>place in algebra, as well as in quantum theory. Moreover, although
Hamilton’s name is infrequently linked with vectors, because Gibbs’s
notations came mostly from Grassmann, the chief properties of vectors
had nevertheless been worked out in Hamilton’s protracted investigations
in multiple algebras.</p>
