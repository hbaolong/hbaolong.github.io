<h4 id="bhaskara">Bhaskara</h4>
<p>India produced a number of later medieval mathematicians, but we
shall describe the work of only one of these—Bhaskara, the leading
mathematician of the twelfth century. It was he who filled some of the
gaps in Brahmagupta’s work, as by giving a general solution of the Pell
equation and by considering the problem of division by zero. Aristotle
had once remarked that there is no ratio by which a number such as 4
exceeds the number zero, but the arithmetic of zero had not been part of
Greek mathematics, and Brahmagupta had been noncommittal on the division
of a number other than zero by the number zero. It is therefore in
Bhaskara’s Vija-Ganita that we find the first statement that such a
quotient is infinite.</p>
<p>Statement: Dividend 3. Divisor 0. Quotient the fraction 3/0. This
fraction of which the denominator is cipher, is termed an infinite
quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has cipher for a
divisor, there is no alteration, though many be inserted or extracted;
as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God.</p>
<p>This statement sounds promising, but a lack of clear understanding of
the situation is suggested by Bhaskara’s further assertion that a/0
05a.</p>
<p>Bhaskara was one of the last significant medieval mathematicians from
India, and his work represents the culmination of earlier Hindu
contributions. In his best-known treatise, the Lilavati, he compiled
problems from Brahmagupta and others, adding new observations of his
own. The very title of this book may be taken to indicate the uneven
quality of Indian thought, for the name in the title is that of
Bhaskara’s daughter, who, according to legend, lost the opportunity to
marry because of her father’s confidence in his astrological
predictions. Bhaskara had calculated that his daughter might
propitiously marry only at one particular</p>
<p>B ha sk ara</p>
<p>hour on a given day. On what was to have been her wedding day, the
eager girl was bending over the water clock, as the hour for the
marriage approached, when a pearl from her headdress fell, quite
unnoticed, and stopped the outflow of water. Before the mishap was
noted, the propitious hour had passed. To console the unhappy girl, the
father gave her name to the book we are describing.</p>
<p>The Lilavati</p>
<p>The Lilavati, like the Vija-Ganita, contains numerous problems
dealing with favorite Hindu topics: linear and quadratic equations, both
determinate and indeterminate; simple mensuration; arithmetic and
geometric progressions; surds; Pythagorean triads; and others. The
“broken bamboo” problem, popular in China (and also included by
Brahmagupta), appears in the following form: if a bamboo 32 cubits high
is broken by the wind so that the tip meets the ground 16 cubits from
the base, at what height above the ground was it broken? Also making use
of the Pythagorean theorem is the following problem: A peacock is
perched atop a pillar at the base of which is a snake’s hole. Seeing the
snake at a distance from the pillar, which is three times the height of
the pillar, the peacock pounces on the snake in a straight line before
it can reach its hole. If the peacock and the snake have gone equal
distances, how many cubits from the hole do they meet?</p>
<p>These two problems well illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the
Lilavati, for despite their apparent similarity and the fact that only a
single answer is required, one of the problems is determinate and the
other is indeterminate. In the treating of the circle and the sphere,
the Lilavati also fails to distinguish between exact and approximate
statements. The area of the circle is correctly given as one-quarter the
circumference multiplied by the diameter and the volume of the sphere as
one-sixth the product of the surface area and the diameter, but for the
ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle, Bhaskara suggests either
3,927 to 1,250 or the “gross” value 22/7. The former is equivalent to
the ratio mentioned, but not used, by Aryabhata. There is no hint in
Bhaskara or other Hindu writers that they were aware that all ratios
that had been proposed were only approximations. Yet, Bhaskara severely
condemns his predecessors for using the formulas of Brahmagupta for the
area and the diagonals of a general quadrilateral, because he saw that a
quadrilateral is not uniquely determined by its sides. Evidently, he did
not realize that the formulas are indeed exact for all cyclic
quadrilaterals.</p>
<p>Many of Bhaskara’s problems in the Lilavati and the Vija-Ganita were
evidently derived from earlier Hindu sources; hence, it is no surprise
to note that the author is at his best in dealing with indeterminate
analysis. In connection with the Pell equation, x2 511py2, proposed
earlier by Brahmagupta, Bhaskara gave particular solutions for the five
cases p58, 11, 32, 61, and 67. For x2 51161y2, for example, he gave the
solution x51,776,319,049 and y522,615,390. This is an impressive feat in
calculation, and its verification alone will tax the efforts of the
reader. Bhaskara’s books are replete with other instances of Diophantine
problems.</p>
