<h4 id="arithmetic-and-logistic">Arithmetic and Logistic</h4>
<p>Because documents from the period are entirely missing, there is far
more uncertainty about Greek mathematics from 600 to 450 BCE than about
Babylonian algebra or Egyptian geometry from about 1700 BCE. Not even
mathematical artifacts have survived from the early days of Greece. It
is evident that some form of counting board or abacus was used in
calculation, but the nature and operation of the device must be inferred
from the Roman abacus and from some casual references in works by Greek
authors. Herodotus, writing in the early fifth century BCE, said that in
counting with pebbles, as in writing, the Greek hand moved from left to
right, the Egyptian from right to left. A vase from a somewhat later
period pictures a collector of tribute with a counting board, which was
used not only for integral decimal multiples of the drachma but for
nondecimal fractional subdivisions. Beginning on the left, the columns
designate myriads, thousands, hundreds, and tens of drachmas
respectively, the symbols being in Herodianic notation. Then, following
the units column for drachmas, there are columns for obols (six
obols5one drachma), for the half obol, and for the quarter obol. Here we
see how ancient civilizations avoided an excessive use of fractions:
they simply subdivided units of length, weight, and money so effectively
that they could calculate in terms of integral multiples of the
subdivisions. This undoubtedly is the explanation for the popularity in
antiquity of duodecimal and sexagesimal subdivisions, for the decimal
system here is at a severe disadvantage. Decimal fractions were rarely
used, either by the Greeks or by other Western peoples, before the
period of the Renaissance. The abacus can be readily adapted to any
system of numeration or to any combination of systems; it is likely that
the widespread use of the abacus accounts at least in part for the
amazingly late development of a consistent positional system of notation
for integers and fractions. In this respect, the Pythagorean Age
contributed little if anything.</p>
<p>The point of view of the Pythagoreans seems to have been so
overwhelmingly philosophical and abstract that technical details in
computation were relegated to a separate discipline, called logistic.
This dealt with the numbering of things, rather than with the essence
and properties of number as such, matters of concern in arithmetic. That
is, the ancient Greeks made a clear distinction between mere
calculation, on the one hand, and what today is known as the theory of
numbers, on the other. Whether such a sharp distinction was a
disadvantage to the historical development of mathematics may be a moot
point, but it is not easy to deny to the early Ionian and Pythagorean
mathematicians the primary role in establishing mathematics as a
rational and liberal discipline. It is obvious that tradition can be
quite inaccurate, but it is seldom entirely misdirected.</p>
<p>Fifth-CenturyAthens</p>
<p>The fifth century BCE was a crucial period in the history of Western
civilization, for it opened with the defeat of the Persian invaders and
closed with the surrender of Athens to Sparta. Between these two events
lay the great Age of Pericles, with its accomplishments in literature
and art. The prosperity and intellectual atmosphere of Athens during the
century attracted scholars from all parts of the Greek world, and a
synthesis of diverse aspects was achieved. From Ionia came men such as
Anaxagoras, with a practical turn of mind; from southern Italy came
others, such as Zeno, with stronger metaphysical inclinations.
Democritus of Abdera espoused a materialistic view of the world, while
Pythagoras in Italy held idealistic attitudes in science and philosophy.
In Athens, one found eager devotees of old and new branches of learning,
from cosmology to ethics. There was a bold spirit of free inquiry that
sometimes came into conflict with established mores.</p>
<p>In particular, Anaxagoras was imprisoned in Athens for impiety in
asserting that the sun was not a deity but a huge red-hot stone as big
as the whole Peloponnesus, and that the moon was an inhabited earth
that</p>
<p>T hr e e Cla s s ic al P r oble ms</p>
<p>borrowed its light from the sun. He well represents the spirit of
rational inquiry, for he regarded as the aim of his life the study of
the nature of the universe—a purposefulness that he derived from the
Ionian tradition of which Thales had been a founder. The intellectual
enthusiasm of Anaxagoras was shared with his countrymen through the
first scientific best-seller—a book On Nature—which could be bought in
Athens for only a drachma. Anaxagoras was a teacher of Pericles, who saw
to it that his mentor was ultimately released from prison. Socrates was
at first attracted to the scientific ideas of Anaxagoras but found the
naturalistic Ionian view less satisfying than the search for ethical
verities. Greek science had been rooted in a highly intellectual
curiosity that is often contrasted with the utilitarian immediacy of
pre-Hellenic thought; Anaxagoras clearly represented the typical Greek
motive—the desire to know. In mathematics also, the Greek attitude
differed sharply from that of the earlier potamic cultures. The contrast
was clear in the contributions generally attributed to Thales and
Pythagoras, and it continues to show through in the more reliable
reports about what went on in Athens during the Heroic Age. Anaxagoras
was primarily a natural philosopher, rather than a mathematician, but
his inquiring mind led him to share in the pursuit of mathematical
problems.</p>
