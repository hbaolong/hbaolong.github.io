<h4 id="aristotle">Aristotle</h4>
<p>Aristotle (384 322 BCE), that most widely learned scholar, like
Eudoxus, was a student of Plato’s and, like Menaechmus, a tutor of
Alexander the Great. Aristotle was primarily a philosopher and a
biologist, but he was</p>
<p>Ar i s t o t le</p>
<p>thoroughly au courant with the activities of the mathematicians. He
may have taken a role in one of the leading controversies of the day,
for to him was ascribed a treatise titled On Indivisible Lines. Modern
scholarship questions the authenticity of this work, but, in any case,
it probably was the result of discussions carried on in the Aristotelian
Lyceum. The thesis of the treatise is that the doctrine of indivisibles
espoused by Xenocrates, a successor of Plato as head of the Academy, is
untenable. Xenocrates thought that the notion of an indivisible, or
fixed infinitesimal of length or area or volume, would resolve the
paradoxes, such as those of Zeno, that plagued mathematical and
philosophical thought. Aristotle, too, devoted much attention to the
paradoxes of Zeno, but he sought to refute them on the basis of common
sense. He hesitated to follow Platonic mathematicians into the
abstractions and technicalities of the day and made no lasting
contribution to the subject. Through his foundation of logic and his
frequent allusion to mathematical concepts and theorems in his
voluminous works, Aristotle can be regarded as having contributed to the
development of mathematics. The Aristotelian discussion of the
potentially and actually infinite in arithmetic and geometry influenced
many later writers on the foundations of mathematics, but Aristotle’s
statement that mathematicians “do not need the infinite or use it”
should be compared with the assertions of our day that the infinite is
the mathematician’s paradise. Of more positive significance is
Aristotle’s analysis of the roles of definitions and hypotheses in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In 323 BCE, Alexander the Great suddenly died, and his empire fell
apart. His generals divided the territory over which the young conqueror
had ruled. In Athens, where Aristotle had been regarded as a foreigner,
the philosopher found himself unpopular now that his powerful
soldierstudent was dead. He left Athens and died the following year.
Throughout the Greek world, the old order was changing, politically and
culturally. Under Alexander, there had been a gradual blending of
Hellenic and Oriental customs and learning, so that it was more
appropriate to speak of the newer civilization as Hellenistic, rather
than Hellenic. Moreover, the new city of Alexandria, established by the
world conqueror, now took the place of Athens as the center of the
mathematical world. In the history of civilization, it is therefore
customary to distinguish two periods in the Greek world, with the almost
simultaneous deaths of Aristotle and Alexander (as well as that of
Demosthenes) as a convenient dividing line. The earlier portion is known
as the Hellenic Age, the later as the Hellenistic or Alexandrian Age. In
the next few chapters, we describe the mathematics of the first century
of the new era, often known as the Golden Age of Greek mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="euclid-of-alexandria">5 Euclid of Alexandria</h2>
<p>Ptolemy once asked Euclid whether there was any shorter way to a
knowledge of geometry than by a study of the Elements, whereupon Euclid
answered that there was no royal road to geometry.</p>
