<h4 id="weierstrass-and-students">Weierstrass and Students</h4>
<p>The leading analyst in Berlin in the second half of the nineteenth
century was Karl Weierstrass (1815 1897). Weierstrass prepared himself
at Mu¨nster for secondary-school teaching, where an instructor,
Christoph Gudermann (1798 1851), took Weierstrass under his wing.</p>
<p>Gudermann was especially interested in elliptic and hyperbolic
functions; his name is still recalled in the Gudermannian: If u is a
function of x satisfying the equation tan u5sinhx, then u is known as
the Gudermannian of x, written as u5gd x. More important to mathematics
than this minor contribution were the time and inspiration the teacher
gave to his student Karl Weierstrass, who was destined in turn to become
the greatest mathematics teacher of the mid-nineteenth century—at least,
as measured in terms of the number of successful research workers he
produced. Gudermann had impressed on the young Weierstrass what a useful
tool the power series representation of a function was, and it was in
this connection that Weierstrass produced his greatest work, following
in the footsteps of Abel.</p>
<p>Weierstrass earned his teacher’s certificate at the late age of
twenty-six, and for more than a dozen years, he taught at various
secondary schools. In 1854, however, a paper on Abelian functions,
appearing in Crelle’s Journal, brought him such recognition that shortly
thereafter he was offered and he accepted a professorship at the
University of Berlin. Weierstrass was then almost forty, making him a
striking exception to the common notion that a great mathematician must
make his mark early in life.</p>
<p>It had been generally assumed, before the middle of the nineteenth
century, that if an infinite series converges for some interval to a
continuous and differentiable function f(x), then a second series
obtained by differentiating the original series, term by term,
necessarily will converge, for the same interval, to fu(x). Several
mathematicians showed that this is not necessarily the case and that
term-by-term differentiation can be trusted only if the series is
uniformly convergent for the interval—that is, if a single N can be
found such that for every value of x in the interval the partial sums
Sn(x) will differ from the sum S(x) of the series by less than a given ε
for all n.N. Weierstrass showed that for a uniformly convergent series,
term-by-term integration was also permissible. In the matter of uniform
convergence, Weierstrass was far from alone, for the concept was hit on
independently at about the same time by at least three other men—Cauchy
in France (perhaps by 1853), Stokes at Cambridge (in 1847), and P. L. V.
Seidel (1821 1896) in Germany (in 1848). H. E. Heine (1821 1881),
previously close to Dirichlet and Riemann, in 1870 proved that the
Fourier series development of a continuous function is unique if one
imposes the condition that it be uniformly convergent. Yet perhaps no
one is more deserving to be known as the father of the critical movement
in analysis than is Weierstrass. From 1857 until his retirement in 1890,
he urged a generation of students to use infinite series representations
with care.</p>
<p>One of Weierstrass’s important contributions to analysis is known as
analytic continuation. Weierstrass had shown that the infinite power
series representation of a function f(x), about a point Pl in the
complex plane, converges at all points within a circle C1 whose center
is P1 and which passes through the nearest singularity. If, now, one
expands the same function about a second point P2 other than P1 but
within C1, this series will be convergent within a circle C2 having P2
as the center and passing through the singularity nearest to P2. This
circle may include points outside C1; hence, one has extended the area
of the plane within which f(x) is defined analytically by a power
series; the process can be continued with still other circles.
Weierstrass therefore defined an analytic function as one power series
together with all of those that are obtainable from it by analytic
continuation. The importance of work such as that of Weierstrass is felt
particularly in mathematical physics, in which solutions of differential
equations are rarely found in any form other than as an infinite
series.</p>
<p>Weierstrass’s influence was exerted through his students as much as
through his own lectures and publications. In the field of differential
equations, this brings us to Lazarus Fuchs (1833 1902). Building on work
by the French mathematicians Briot (1817 1882) and Bouquet (1819 1885),
and on Riemann’s memoir about the hypergeometric equation, Fuchs
initiated the systematic study of regular singularities of linear
ordinary differential equations in the complex domain. His immediate
motivation came from lectures on Abelian functions that Weierstrass had
given in 1863. Fuchs’s work was sharpened by G. Frobenius (1849 1917) at
Berlin and served as a takeoff point for Poincare.´</p>
<p>Another Weierstrass student who made major contributions to complex
analysis was H. A. Schwarz (1848 1921). Schwarz was interested in
mapping questions and was especially affected by Weierstrass’s criticism
of Riemann’s use of the Dirichlet principle. Riemann’s famous mapping
theorem, translated into a later terminology, states that “there</p>
<p>T he Ar i t hme t iz at ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>exists one and only one conformal mapping of a given bounded simply
connected surface onto a second one, for which the images of one
interior point and one boundary point are prescribed” (Birkhoff 1973,
p. 47). Weierstrass noted that Riemann’s proof was unacceptable because
it extended the use of Dirichlet’s principle beyond the limitations that
would assure the existence of a minimizing integral. Schwarz thereupon
set out to find specific instances for which he could validate the
mapping theorem. This search led him to two very useful tools, one known
as his “reflection principle,” the other as his “alternating process.”
He was able to obtain a number of specific mappings; for example, he
could map a simply connected plane region onto a circle, but he could
not achieve the hoped-for broader generalization.</p>
<p>Yet another follower of Weierstrass who was to assume international
importance because of his journal and his support of mathematicians from
different parts of the world was the Swede Gosta Mittag-Leffler¨ (1846
1927). Mittag-Leffler had studied with Charles Hermite (1822</p>
<ol start="1901" type="1">
<li>in Paris and Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824 1897) in
Gottingen before he came to Berlin. He made independent contributions¨
to complex function theory. More important, he founded the journal Acta
Mathematica, was a friend of Weierstrass’s and Hermite’s, exchanged
information with mathematicians around the world, and supported numerous
mathematicians directly, as well as through his connections in Sweden
and elsewhere. Thus, he played an important role in the lives of such
diverse individuals as Sofia Kovalevskaya, Henri Poincare, and´ Georg
Cantor.</li>
</ol>
<p>TheArithmetization of Analysis</p>
<p>Note that 1872 was a red-letter year not only in geometry but, more
particularly, in analysis. In that year, crucial contributions toward
the arithmetization of analysis were made by no fewer than five
mathematicians,one French, the others German. The Frenchman was H. C. R.
(Charles) Meray (1835´ 1911) of Burgundy; the four Germans were Karl
Weierstrass of Berlin, H. E. Heine of Halle, Georg Cantor</p>
<p>(1845 1918), also of Halle, and J. W. R. Dedekind (1831 1916) of
Braunschweig. These men, in a sense, represented the climax in half a
century of investigation into the nature of function and number that had
begun in 1822 with Fourier’s theory of heat and with an attempt made in
that year by Martin Ohm (1792 1872) to reduce all of analysis to
arithmetic in Versuch eines vollsta¨ndig konsequenten Systems der
Mathematik. There were two chief causes of uneasiness in this fifty-year
interval. One was the lack of confidence in operations performed on
infinite series. It was not even clear whether an infinite series of
functions—of powers or of sines and cosines, for example—always
converges to the function from which it was derived. A second cause for
concern was occasioned by the lack of any definition of the phrase “real
number” that lay at the very heart of the arithmetization program. By
1817, Bolzano had been so fully aware of the need for rigor in analysis
that Klein referred to him as the “father of arithmetization,” but
Bolzano had been less influential than Cauchy, whose analysis was still
encumbered with geometric intuition. Even Bolzano’s continuous
nondifferentiable function of about 1830 was overlooked by successors,
and the example of such a function given by Weierstrass (in classroom
lectures in 1861 and in a paper to the Berlin Academy in 1872) was
generally thought to be the first illustration of it.</p>
<p>Riemann, meanwhile, had exhibited a function f(x) that is
discontinuous at infinitely many points in an interval and yet the
integral of which exists and defines a continuous function F(x) that,
for the infinity of points in question, fails to have a derivative.
Riemann’s function is, in a sense, less pathological than are those of
Bolzano and Weierstrass, but it made clear that the integral required a
more careful definition than that of Cauchy, which had been guided
largely by geometric feeling for the area under a curve. The present-day
definition of the definite integral over an interval in terms of upper
and lower sums is generally known as the Riemann integral, in honor of
the man who gave necessary and sufficient conditions that a bounded
function be integrable. The Dirichlet function, for instance, does not
have a Riemann integral for any interval. Still more general definitions
of the integral, with weaker conditions on the function, were proposed
in the next century, but the definition of the integral used in most
undergraduate courses in the calculus is still that of Riemann.</p>
<p>There was a gap of some fifty years between the work of Bolzano and
that of Weierstrass, but the unity of effort in this half century and
the need to rediscover Bolzano’s work were such that there is a
celebrated theorem that bears the name of both men, the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: A bounded set S containing infinitely many
elements (such as points or numbers) contains at least one limit point.
Although this theorem was proved by Bolzano and apparently was also
known to Cauchy, it was the work of Weierstrass that made it familiar to
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Skepticism about Fourier’s series had been expressed by Lagrange, but
Cauchy, in 1823, thought he had proved the convergence of the general
Fourier series. Dirichlet had shown that Cauchy’s proof was inadequate
and had provided sufficient conditions for the convergence. It was in
seeking to liberalize Dirichlet’s conditions for the convergence of a
Fourier series that Riemann developed his definition of the Riemann
integral; in this connection, he showed that a function f(x) may be
integrable in an interval without being representable by a Fourier
series. It was the study of infinite trigonometric series that also led
to Cantor’s theory of sets, to be described later.</p>
<p>T he Ar i t hme t iz at ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>Only a year after the critical year 1872, a young man who had given
promise of significant contributions to both mathematics and its history
died at the early age of thirty-four. This was Hermann Hankel (1839
1873), a student of Riemann’s and a professor of mathematics at Leipzig.
In 1867, he had published a book, Theorie der komplexen Zahlensysteme,
in which he pointed out that “the condition for erecting a universal
arithmetic is … a purely intellectual mathematics, one detached from all
perceptions.” We have seen that the revolution in geometry took place
when Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai freed themselves from preconceptions
of space. In somewhat the same sense, the thoroughgoing arithmetization
of analysis became possible only when, as Hankel foresaw, mathematicians
understood that the real numbers are to be viewed as “intellectual
structures,” rather than as intuitively given magnitudes inherited from
Euclid’s geometry. Hankel’s view was not really new; a generation of
algebraists, especially in Great Britain, had been developing a
universal arithmetic and multiple algebras. The implications for
analysis, however, had not been widely recognized. During the early
1830s, Bolzano had made an attempt to develop a theory of real numbers
as limits of rational number sequences, but this had gone unnoticed and
unpublished until 1962. Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805 1865) perhaps
had felt some such need, but his appeal to time, rather than to space,
was a change in language, although not in logical form, from the usual
geometric background. The crux of the matter was first effectively
seized on and published by the quintet of 1872 mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Meray was prompt to present his thoughts, for as early as 1869 he
had´ published an article calling attention to a serious lapse in
reasoning of which mathematicians from the time of Cauchy had been
guilty.</p>
<p>Essentially, the petitio principii consisted of defining the limit of
a sequence as a real number and then, in turn, defining a real number as
a limit of a sequence (of rational numbers). It will be recalled that
Bolzano and Cauchy had attempted to prove that a sequence that
“converges within itself”—one for which Sn1p differs from Sn (for a
given integer p and for n sufficiently large) by less than any assigned
magnitude ε, also converges in the sense of external relations to a real
number S, the limit of the sequence. Meray, in his´ Nouveau precis
d’analyse infinit´ esimale´ of 1872, cut the Gordian knot by not
invoking the external condition of convergence or the real number S.
Using only the Bolzano-Cauchy criterion, where n, p, and ε are rational
numbers, convergence can be described without reference to irrational
numbers. In a broad sense, he regarded a converging sequence as
determining either a rational number as a limit or a “fictitious number”
as a “fictitious limit.” These “fictitious numbers” can, he showed, be
ordered, and, in essence, they are what we know as the irrational
numbers. Meray was somewhat vague as to whether his´ converging sequence
is the number. If it is, as seems to be implied, then his theory is
equivalent to one developed at the same time by Weierstrass.</p>
<p>Weierstrass sought to separate the calculus from geometry and to base
it on the concept of number alone. Like Meray, he also saw that to do
this, it´ was necessary to give a definition of an irrational number
that is independent of the limit concept, inasmuch as the latter had up
to this point presupposed the former. To correct Cauchy’s logical error,
Weierstrass settled the question of the existence of a limit of a
convergent sequence by making the sequence itself the number or the
limit. Weierstrass’s scheme is too subtle to be presented in detail
here, but in considerably oversimplified form, we may say that the
number is not the limit of the series</p>
<p>111 1103n 1 ; it is the sequence associated with this series.
(Actually, in Weierstrass’s theory, the irrational numbers are more
broadly defined as aggregates of the rationals, rather than more
narrowly as ordered sequences of rationals, as we have implied.)</p>
<p>Weierstrass did not publish his views on the arithmetization of
analysis, but they were made known by men such as Ferdinand Lindemann
and Eduard Heine, who had followed his lectures. In 1871, Cantor had
initiated a third program of arithmetization, similar to those of Meray´
and Weierstrass. Heine suggested simplifications that have led to the
so-called Cantor-Heine development, published by Heine in Crelle’s
Journal for 1872 in the article “Die Elemente der Funktionenlehre.” In
essence, the scheme resembled that of Meray’s, in that convergent´
sequences that fail to converge to rational numbers are taken by fiat to
define irrational numbers. A thoroughly distinct approach to the same
problem and the one that today is best known was given in the same year
by Dedekind in a celebrated book, Stetigkeit und die Irrationalzahlen
(Continuity and Irrational Numbers).</p>
