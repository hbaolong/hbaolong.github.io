<h4 id="cantor-and-kronecker">Cantor and Kronecker</h4>
<p>The life of Cantor was tragically different from that of his friend
Dedekind. Cantor was born in St. Petersburg of parents who had migrated
from Denmark, but most of his life was spent in Germany, the family
having moved to Frankfurt when he was eleven. His parents were
Christians of Jewish background—his father had been converted to
Protestantism, his mother had been born a Catholic. The son Georg took a
strong interest in the fine-spun arguments of medieval theologians
concerning continuity and the infinite, and this militated against his
pursuing a mundane career in engineering, as suggested by his father. In
his studies at Zurich, Gottingen, and Berlin, the young man consequently
concentrated on¨ philosophy, physics, and mathematics—a program that
seems to have fostered his unprecedented mathematical imagination. He
took his doctorate at Berlin in 1867 with a thesis on the theory of
numbers, but his early publications show an attraction to Weierstrassian
analysis. This field prompted the revolutionary ideas that sprang to his
mind in his late twenties. We have already noted the work of Cantor in
connection with the prosaic phrase “real number,” but his most original
contributions centered about the provocative word “infinity.”</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Zeno, men had been talking about infinity, in
theology as well as in mathematics, but no one before 1872 had been able
to tell precisely what he was talking about. All too frequently in
discussions of the infinite, the examples cited were such things as
unlimited power or indefinitely large magnitudes. Occasionally,
attention had instead been focused, as in the work of Galileo and
Bolzano, on the infinitely many elements in a collection, for example,
the natural numbers or the points in a line segment. Cauchy and
Weierstrass saw only paradox in attempts to identify an actual or
“completed” infinity in mathematics, believing that the infinitely large
and small indicated nothing more than the potentiality of Aristotle—an
incompleteness of the process in question. Cantor and Dedekind came to a
contrary conclusion. Dedekind saw</p>
<p>C ant or and Kr one c ker</p>
<p>in Bolzano’s paradoxes not an anomaly, but a universal property of
infinite sets that he took as a precise definition:</p>
<p>A system S is said to be infinite when it is similar to a proper part
of itself; in the contrary case S is said to be a finite system.</p>
<p>In somewhat more modern terminology, a set S of elements is said to
be infinite if the elements of a proper subset Su can be put into
one-toone correspondence with the elements of S. That the set S of
natural numbers is infinite, for instance, is clear from the fact that
the subset Su made up of all triangular numbers is such that to each
element n of S, there corresponds an element of Su given by n(n 1 l)/2.
This positive definition of a “completed infinite” set is not to be
confused with the negative statement sometimes written with Wallis’s
symbol as 1/05
N.Thislast“equation”simplyindicatesthatthereisnorealnumber that
multiplied by zero will produce the number 1.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s definition of an infinite set appeared in 1872 in his
Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen. (In 1888, Dedekind amplified his
ideas in another important treatise, Was sind und was sollen die
Zahlen.) Two years later, Cantor married, and on the honeymoon, he took
his bride to Interlaken, where they met Dedekind. In the same year,
1874, Cantor published in Crelle’s Journal one of his most revolutionary
papers. He, like Dedekind, had recognized the fundamental property of
infinite sets, but, unlike Dedekind, Cantor saw that not all infinite
sets are the same. In the finite case, sets of elements are said to have
the same (cardinal) number if they can be put into one-to-one
correspondence. In a somewhat similar way, Cantor set out to build a
hierarchy of infinite sets according to the Ma¨chtigkeit, or “power,” of
the set. The set of perfect squares or the set of triangular numbers has
the same power as the set of all of the positive integers, for the
groups can be put into one-to-one correspondence. These sets seem to be
much smaller than the set of all rational fractions, yet Cantor showed
that the latter set is also countable or denumerable—that is, it, too,
can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers,
hence has the same power. To show this, we merely follow the arrows in
Fig. 22.1, “counting” the fractions along the way.</p>
<p>The rational fractions are so dense that between any two of them, no
matter how close, there will always be another, yet Cantor’s arrangement
showed that the set of fractions has the same power as does the set of
integers. One begins to wonder whether all sets of numbers have the same
power, but Cantor proved conclusively that this is not the case. The set
of all real numbers, for example, has a higher power than does the set
of rational fractions. To show this, Cantor used a reductio ad absurdum.
Assume that the real numbers between 0 and 1 are countable, are
expressed</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>as nonterminating decimals (so that , for example, appears as
0.333…,</p>
<p>as 0.499…, and so on), and are arranged in denumerable order:</p>
<p>a1 50:a11a12a13 ; a2 50:a21a22a23 ; a3 50:a31a32a33 ;</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>where aij is a digit between 0 and 9 inclusive. To show that not all
of the real numbers between 0 and 1 are included above, Cantor exhibited
an infinite decimal different from all of those listed. To do this,
simply form the decimal b50.b1b2b3 …, where bK 59 if aKK 51 and bK 51 if
aKK 6¼ 1. This real number will be between 0 and 1, and yet it will be
unequal to any one of those in the arrangement that was presumed to
contain all of the real numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The real numbers can be subdivided into two types in two different
ways: (1) as rational and irrational or (2) as algebraic and
transcendental. Cantor showed that even the class of algebraic numbers,
which is far more general than that of rational numbers, nevertheless
has the same power as that of the integers. Hence, it is the
transcendental numbers that give to the real number system the “density”
that results in a higher power. That it is fundamentally a matter of
density that determines the power of a set is suggested in the fact that
the power of the set of points on an infinitely extended line is just
the same as the power of the set of points in any segment of the line,
however small. To show this, let RS be the infinitely</p>
<p>C ant or and Kr one c ker</p>
<p>extended line and let PQ be any finite segment (Fig. 22.2). Place the
segment so that it intersects RS at a point O but is not perpendicular
to RS and does not lie on RS. If the points M and N are so chosen that
PM and QN are parallel to RS and MON is perpendicular to RS, then, by
drawing lines through M intersecting both OP and OR and lines through N
intersecting OQ and OS, a one-to-one correspondence is easily
established.</p>
<p>More surprising still is the fact that dimensionality is not the
arbiter of the power of a set. The power of the set of points in a unit
line segment is just the same as that of the points in a unit area or in
a unit volume— or, for that matter, in all of three-dimensional space.
(Dimensionality, however, retains some measure of authority, in that any
one-to-one mapping of points in a space of unlike dimensionality is
necessarily a discontinuous mapping.) So paradoxical were some results
in point-set theory that Cantor himself on one occasion in 1877 wrote to
Dedekind, “I see it, but I don’t believe it,” and he asked his friend to
check the proof. Publishers, too, were very hesitant about accepting his
papers, and several times the appearance of articles by Cantor in
Crelle’s Journal was delayed by editorial indecision and concern lest
error lurk in the unconventional approach to mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>Cantor’s amazing results led him to establish the theory of sets, a
fullfledged mathematical discipline, known as Mengenlehre (theory of
assemblages) or Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (theory of manifolds), a branch
that in the mid-twentieth century was to have profound effects on the
teaching of mathematics. At the time of its founding, Cantor spent much
effort in convincing his contemporaries of the validity of the results,
for there was considerable horror infiniti, and mathematicians were
reluctant to accept the eigentlich Unendliche or “completed infinity.”
In piling evidence on
evidence,Cantorintheendbuiltawholetransfinitearithmetic.The“power” of a
set became the “cardinal number” of the set. Thus, the “number” of the
set of integers is the “smallest” transfinite number, E, and the
“number” of the set of real numbers or of points on a line is a “larger”
number, C, the number of the continuum. Still unanswered is the question
whether there are transfinite numbers between E and C. Cantor himself
showed that there are indefinitely many transfinite numbers beyond C,
for he proved that the set ofsubsets ofa set is always ofa higherpower
than the set itself. Hence, the “number” of the set of subsets of C is a
third transfinite</p>
<p>number, the set of subsets of this set of subsets determines a fourth
number, and so on, indefinitely. As there are infinitely many natural
numbers, so are there infinitely many transfinite numbers as well.</p>
<p>The transfinite numbers described previously are cardinal numbers,
but Cantor also developed an arithmetic of transfinite ordinal numbers.
Ordering relations are a ticklish matter in mathematics, so it turns out
that transfinite ordinal arithmetic differs strikingly from finite
ordinal arithmetic. For finite cases, the rules for ordinal numbers are
essentially the same as for cardinal numbers. Thus, 3145413, whether
these digits represent cardinal or ordinal numbers. If, however, one
designates by ω the ordinal number of the “counting numbers,” then ω11
is not the same as 11ω, for 11ω is obviously the same as ω. Moreover,
one can show that ω1ω5ω andω U
ω5ω,propertiesunlikethoseoffiniteordinalsbutresemblingthose of
transfinite cardinals.</p>
<p>Dedekind and Cantor were among the most capable mathematicians, and
certainly the most original, of their day, yet neither man secured a
top-ranking professional position. Dedekind spent almost a lifetime
teaching at the secondary-school level, and Cantor spent most of his
career at the University of Halle. Cantor had hoped to achieve the
distinction of a professorship at the University of Berlin, and he
blamed Leopold Kronecker (1823 1891) for his lack of success.</p>
<p>KroneckerhadbeenastudentofKummer’s,firstatthesecondary-school level,
when the latter was a teacher in the gymnasium that Kronecker attended,
later at the University of Breslau. Kronecker studied with Steiner and
Dirichlet at Berlin, where he obtained his doctoral degree in 1845. The
son of wealthy parents, he did not initially pursue an academic career
but looked after the family’s financial interests. He continued to do
mathematical research, however. When he moved to Berlin in 1855, he led
the life of a private scholar. His prodigious output, covering number
theory, the theory of equations, and elliptic function theory, among
others, in 1861 gained him membership in the Academy of Sciences in
Berlin. This made him eligible to teach at the University of Berlin,
which he proceeded to do. He was appointed to a regular professorship in
1883, when Kummer retired. Kronecker’s research contributions were
significant, both for individual results and for his overall attempt to
arithmetize algebra, as well as analysis. His influence on early
twentiethcentury algebra was considerable, as was that on number theory;
the work of Erich Hecke (1887 1947) serves as an example. The importance
of Kronecker’s work has been overshadowed in most historical accounts by
rather hostile versions of his conflict with Cantor. In fact, his
predilection for the integers and his espousal of constructive
procedures also estranged
himfromWeierstrass.Tohimisattributedthewell-knownstatement“God made the
integers, and all the rest is the work of man.” He categorically
rejected the real-number constructions of his day on the grounds that
they cannot be achieved only through finite processes. He is said to
have</p>
<p>asked Lindemann of what use was the proof that π is not algebraic,
inasmuch as irrational numbers are nonexistent. Sometimes it is reported
that his movement died of inanition. We shall later see that it can be
said to have reappeared in a new form in the work of Poincare and´ L. E.
J. Brouwer.</p>
<p>In 1883, Cantor wrote a vigorous defense in his Grundlagen einer
allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (Foundations of a General Theory of
Manifolds), holding that “definite numerations can be undertaken with
infinite sets just as well as with finite.” He had no fear of falling
into what he described as an “abyss of transcendentals,” yet he did
occasionally lapse into arguments of the theological type. Kronecker
continued his attacks on the hypersensitive and temperamental Cantor,
and in 1884, Cantor suffered the first of the nervous breakdowns that
were to recur during the remaining thirty-three years of his life. Fits
of depression sometimes led him to doubt his own work, although he was
comforted to some extent by the support of men such as Hermite. Toward
the end, he did earn recognition for his achievements, but his death in
1918 in a mental institution in Halle is a reminder that genius and
madness sometimes are closely related. The tragedy of his personal life
is mitigated by the paean of praise of one of the leading mathematicians
of the early twentieth century, David Hilbert, who described the new
transfinite arithmetic as “the most astonishing product of mathematical
thought, one of most beautiful realizations of human activity in the
domain of the purely intelligible.” Where timid souls had hesitated,
Hilbert exclaimed, “No one shall expel us from the paradise which Cantor
has created for us.”</p>
