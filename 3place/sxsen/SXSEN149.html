<h4 id="bonaventura-cavalieri">Bonaventura Cavalieri</h4>
<p>Galileo had intended to write a treatise on the infinite in
mathematics, but if he did, it has not been found. Meanwhile, his
disciple Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598 1647) was spurred by Kepler’s
Stereometria, as well as by ancient and medieval views and by Galileo’s
encouragement, to organize his thoughts on infinitesimals in the form of
a book. Cavalieri was a member of a religious order (a Jesuate, not a
Jesuit, as is frequently but incorrectly stated) who lived in Milan and
Rome before becoming professor of mathematics at Bologna in 1629.
Characteristically for that time, he wrote on many aspects of pure and
applied mathematics— geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, and optics—and
he was the first Italian writer to appreciate the value of logarithms.
In his Directorium Universale Uranometricum of 1632, he published tables
of sines, tangents, secants, and versed sines, together with their
logarithms, to eight places; but the world remembers him instead for one
of the most influential books of the early modern period, the Geometria
Indivisibilibus Continuorum, published in 1635.</p>
<p>The argument on which the book is based is essentially that implied
by Oresme, Kepler, and Galileo—that an area can be thought of as made up
of lines or “indivisibles” and that a solid volume can be regarded
similarly as composed of areas that are indivisible or quasi-atomic
volumes. Although Cavalieri at the time could scarcely have realized it,
he was following in very respectable footsteps indeed, for this is
precisely the type of reasoning that Archimedes had used in the Method,
which at that time had been lost. But Cavalieri, unlike Archimedes, felt
no compunction about the logical deficiencies behind such
procedures.</p>
<p>The general principle that in an equation involving infinitesimals,
those of higher order are to be discarded because they have no effect on
the final result is frequently erroneously attributed to Cavalieri’s
Geometria Indivisibilibus. The author undoubtedly was familiar with such
an idea, for it is implied in some of the work of Galileo, and it
appeared more specifically in results of contemporary French
mathematicians, but Cavalieri assumed almost the opposite of this
principle. There was in Cavalieri’s method no process of continued
approximation or any omission of terms, for he used a strict one-to-one
pairing of the elements in two configurations. No elements are
discarded, no matter what the dimension. The general approach and the
specious plausibility of the method of indivisibles are well illustrated
by the proposition still known in many solid geometry books as “the
theorem of Cavalieri”:</p>
<p>If two solids have equal altitudes, and if sections made by planes
parallel to the bases and at equal distances from them are always in a
given ratio, then the volumes of the solids also are in this ratio
(Smith 1959, pp. 605609).</p>
<p>Cavalieri concentrated on an extremely useful geometric theorem
equivalent to the modern statement in the calculus</p>
<p>a n an11 x dx5:</p>
<p>0 n11</p>
<p>The statement and the proof of the theorem are very different from
those with which a modern reader is familiar, for Cavalieri compared
powers of the lines in a parallelogram parallel to the base with the
corresponding powers of lines in either of the two triangles into which
a diagonal divides the parallelogram. Let the parallelogram AFDC be
divided into two triangles by the diagonal CF (Fig. 15.2) and let HE be
an indivisible of triangle CDF that is parallel to the base CD. Then, on
taking BC5FE and drawing BM parallel to CD, it is easy to show that the
indivisible BM in triangle ACF will be equal to HE. Hence, one can pair
all of the</p>
<p>FIG. 15.2</p>
<p>B onav entura C avalier i</p>
<p>indivisibles of triangle CDF with equal indivisibles in triangle ACF,
and, therefore, the two triangles are equal. Inasmuch as the
parallelogram is the sum of the indivisibles in the two triangles, it is
clear that the sum of the first powers of the lines in one of the
constituent triangles is half of the sum of the first powers of the
lines in the parallelogram; in other words,</p>
<p>a a2 xdx5:</p>
<p>0 2</p>
<p>Through a similar but considerably more involved argument, Cavalieri
showed that the sum of the squares of the lines in the triangle is
one-third the sum of the squares of the lines in the parallelogram. For
the cubes of the lines, he found the ratio to be 1/4. Later he carried
the proof to higher powers, finally asserting, in Exercitationes
Geometricae Sex (Six Geometrical Exercises) of 1647, the important
generalization that for the nth powers, the ratio will be 1/(n11). This
was known at the same time to French mathematicians, but Cavalieri was
first to publish this theorem—one that was to open the way to many
algorithms in the calculus. Geometrica Indivisibilibus, which so greatly
facilitated the problem of quadratures, appeared again in a second
edition in 1653, but by that time, mathematicians had achieved
remarkable results in new directions that outmoded Cavalieri’s laborious
geometric approach.</p>
<p>The most significant theorem by far in Cavalieri’s work was his
equivalent of</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>a n an11</p>
<p>x dx5; 0 n11</p>
<p>but another contribution would also lead to important results. The
spiral r5aθ and the parabola x2 5ay had been known since antiquity
without anyone’s having previously noted a relationship between them,
until Cavalieri thought of comparing straight-line indivisibles with
curvilinear indivisibles. If, for example, one were to twist the
parabola x2 5ay (Fig. 15.3) around like a watch spring so that vertex O
remains fixed while point P becomes point Pu, then the ordinates of the
parabola can be thought of as transformed into radius vectors through
the relationships x5r and y5rθ between what we now call rectangular and
polar coordinates. The points on the Apollonian parabola x2 5ay then
will lie on the Archimedean spiral r5aθ. Cavalieri noted further that if
PPu is taken equal to the circumference of the circle of radius OPu, the
area within the first turn of the spiral is exactly equal to the area
between the parabolic arc OP and the radius vector OP. Here we see work
that amounts to analytic geometry and the calculus, yet Cavalieri was
writing before either of these subjects had been formally invented. As
in other parts of the history of mathematics, we see that great
milestones do not</p>
<p>appear suddenly but are merely the more clear-cut formulations along
the thorny path of uneven development.</p>
