<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<p>From 1727 to 1783, the pen of Euler had been busy adding to knowledge
in virtually every branch of pure and applied mathematics, from the most
elementary to the most advanced. Moreover, in most respects Euler, the
most successful notation builder of all times, wrote in the language and
the notations we use today. On his arrival in Russia in 1727, he had
been engaged in experiments in the firing of cannons, and in a
manuscript account of his results, written probably in 1727 or 1728,
Euler had used the letter e more than a dozen times to represent the
base of the system of natural logarithms. The concept behind this number
had been well known ever since the invention of logarithms more than a
century earlier, yet no standard notation for it had become common. In a
letter to Goldbach in 1731, Euler again used his letter e for “that
number whose hyperbolic logarithm51.” It appeared in print for the first
time in Euler’s Mechanica of 1736, a book in which Newtonian dynamics is
presented for the first time in analytic form. This notation, suggested
perhaps by the first letter of the word “exponential,” soon became
standard. The definitive use of the Greek letter π for the ratio of
circumference to diameter in a circle is also largely due to Euler,
although a prior occurrence is found in 1706, the year before Euler was
born—in the Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos, or A New Introduction to the
Mathematics, by William Jones (1675 1749). It was Euler’s adoption of
the symbol π in 1737 and later in his many popular textbooks that made
it widely known and used. The symbol i for p21 is another notation first
used by Euler, although in this case the adoption came near the end of
his life, in 1777. This use probably came so late because in his earlier
works, he had used i to represent an “infinite number,” somewhat as
Wallis had used N. Thus, Euler wrote ex 5(11x/i)i where we should prefer
ex 5limh-Nð11x=hÞh: The three symbols e, π, and i, for which Euler was
in large measure responsible, can be combined with the two most
important integers, 0 and 1, in the celebrated equality eπi 1150, which
contains the five most significant numbers (as well as the most
important relation and the most important operation) in all of
mathematics. The equivalent of this equality, in generalized form, had
been included by Euler in 1748 in his best-known textbook, Introductio
in Analysin Infinitorum. The so-called Eulerian constant, often
represented by the Greek letter γ, is a sixth important mathematical
constant, the</p>
<p>F oundat ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>number defined as limn-Nð1111 11=n2lnnÞ; a well-known number that has
been calculated to hundreds of decimal places, of which the first ten
are 0.5772156649.</p>
<p>It is not only in connection with designations for important numbers
that today we use notations introduced by Euler. In geometry, algebra,
trigonometry, and analysis, we find ubiquitous use of Eulerian symbols,
terminology, and ideas. The use of the small letters a, b, and c for the
sides of a triangle and of the corresponding capitals A, B, and C for
the opposite angles stems from Euler, as does the application of the
letters r, R, and s for the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed
circles and the semiperimeter of the triangle, respectively. The
beautiful formula 4rRs5abc relating the six lengths is also one of the
many elementary results attributed to him, although equivalents of this
result are implied by ancient geometry. The designation lx for logarithm
of x, the use of the now-familiar Σ to indicate a summation, and,
perhaps most important of all, the notation f(x) for a function of x
(used in the Petersburg Commentaries for 1734 1735) are other Eulerian
notations related to ours.</p>
<p>Foundation of Analysis</p>
<p>In evaluating developments in mathematics, we must always bear in
mind that the ideas behind the notations are by far the better half; in
this respect also, the work of Euler was epoch-making. It may fairly be
said that Euler did for the infinite analysis of Newton and Leibniz what
Euclid had done for the geometry of Eudoxus and Theaetetus, or what
Vie`te had done for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi and Cardan. Euler took
the differential calculus and the method of fluxions and made them part
of a more general branch of mathematics that ever since has been known
as “analysis”—the study of infinite processes. Euler’s Introductio in
Analysin Infinitorum served as a fountainhead for the burgeoning
developments in mathematics during the second half of the eighteenth
century. From this time onward, the idea of “function” became
fundamental in analysis. It had been adumbrated in the medieval latitude
of forms, and it had been implicit in the analytic geometry of Fermat
and Descartes, as well as in the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. The
fourth paragraph of the Introductio defines function of a variable
quantity as “any analytic expression whatsoever made up from that
variable quantity and from numbers or constant quantities.” Today such a
definition is unacceptable, for it fails to explain what an “analytic
expression” is. Euler presumably had in mind primarily the algebraic
functions and the elementary transcendental functions; the strictly
analytic treatment of the trigonometric functions was, in fact, in large
measure established by the Introductio. The sine, for example, was no
longer a line segment; it was simply a number or a ratio—the ordinate of
a point on a unit circle, or the number defined by the series z2z3
/3!1z5 /5!2 for some value of z. From the infinite series for ex, sin x,
and cos x, it was a short step to the “Euler identities”</p>
<p>ep 1x 2ep 1x sinx5 p ;</p>
<p>2 21</p>
<p>ep 1x 1ep 1x cosx5;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ep 1x 5cosx1 2p 1sinx;</p>
<p>relationships that had in essence been known to Cotes and De Moivre
but that in Euler’s hands became familiar tools of analysis.</p>
<p>In 1740, Euler had used imaginary exponents in a letter to Jean
Bernoulli, in which he wrote exp 1 1e2xp 1 52 cos x; the familiar Euler
identities appeared in the influential Introductio of 1748. The
elementary transcendental functions—trigonometric, logarithmic, inverse
trigonometric, and exponential—were written and thought of in much the
form that they are treated today. The abbreviations sin., cos., tang.,
cot., sec., and cosec. that were used by Euler in the Latin Introductio
are closer to the present English forms than are the corresponding
abbreviations in the Romance languages. Moreover, Euler was among the
first to treat logarithms as exponents, in the manner now so
familiar.</p>
