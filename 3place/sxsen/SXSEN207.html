<h4 id="fourier">Fourier</h4>
<p>Fourier was the son of a tailor in Auxerre. Having been orphaned in
childhood, he obtained his education through the guidance of the Church,
first at the local military school, then in a school run by the
Benedictine Order. During the revolution, he taught school in his
hometown and was politically active. Arrested during the Terror, on his
release he enrolled in the E´cole Normale, which led to his becoming an
assistant to Lagrange and Monge at the newly formed E´cole
Polytechnique. In 1798, he joined Monge in Napoleon’s Egyptian
adventure, subsequently becoming secretary of the Institut d’E´gypte and
compiling the Description de l’E´gypte. On his return to France, he held
a number of administrative posts, but he nevertheless had opportunity to
continue his scholarly pursuits. In 1822, he was elected secretaire
perpetuel´ of the Academie´ des Sciences in Paris, which placed him in
an influential position during the 1820s. Among the young foreigners in
Paris in the 1820s who came under Fourier’s influence were P. G. Lejeune
Dirichlet (1805 1859) from Prussia, Jean-Jacques-Franc¸ois Sturm (1803
1855) from Switzerland, and Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky (1801 1861)
from Russia. Compatriots who benefited from his counsel included Sophie
Germain (1776 1831) and Joseph Liouville (1809 1882).</p>
<p>Fourier is best known today for his celebrated Theorie analytique de
la´ chaleur of 1822. This book, described by Lord Kelvin as “a great
mathematical poem,” was a development of ideas that ten years earlier
had won him the Academie prize for an essay on the mathematical´ theory
of heat. Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre, the referees, had criticized
the essay for a certain looseness of reasoning; the later clarification
of Fourier’s ideas was to some extent the reason that the nineteenth
century came to be called the age of rigor.</p>
<p>The chief contribution of Fourier and his classic in mathematics was
the idea, adumbrated by Daniel Bernoulli, that any function y5f(x) can
be represented by a series of the form</p>
<p>F our ier</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>y5a0 1a1 cosx1a2 cos2x1 1an cosnx1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>1b1 sinx1b2 sin2x1 1bn sinnx1 ;</p>
<p>now known as a Fourier series. Such a series representation affords
considerably greater generality in the type of functions that can be
studied than does the Taylor series. Even if there are many points at
which the derivative does not exist (as in Fig. 18.4) or at which the
function is not continuous (as in Fig. 18.5), the function may still
have a Fourier expansion. This expansion is easily found on noting
that</p>
<p>1 π 1 π</p>
<p>a0 5ð fðxÞdx; an 5ð fðxÞcosnxdx; π 2π π 2π</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>1 π bn 5ð sinnxdx: π 2π</p>
<p>Fourier, like Monge, had fallen from grace when the Bourbon
restoration followed the exile of Napoleon in 1815, but his work has
ever</p>
<p>FIG. 18.5</p>
<p>since been fundamental in both physics and mathematics. Functions no
longer needed to be of the well-behaved form with which mathematicians
had been familiar. In 1837, Lejeune Dirichlet, for instance, suggested a
very broad definition of function: If a variable y is so related to a
variable x that whenever a numerical value is assigned to x, there is a
rule according to which a unique value of y is determined, then y is
said to be a function of the independent variable x. This comes close to
the modern view of a correspondence between two sets of numbers, but the
concepts of “set” and “real number” had not at that time been
established. To indicate the completely arbitrary nature of the rule of
correspondence, Dirichlet proposed a very “badly behaved” function: When
x is rational, let y5c, and when x is irrational, let y5d 6¼ c. This
function, often known as Dirichlet’s function, is so pathological that
there is no value of x for which it is continuous. Dirichlet also gave
the first rigorous proof of the convergence of a Fourier series for a
function subject to certain restrictions, known as Dirichlet’s
conditions. A Fourier series does not always converge to the value of a
function from which it is derived, but in Leopold Crelle’s Journal for
1828, Dirichlet proved the following theorem: If f(x) is periodic of
period 2π, if for2π, x,π the function f(x) has a finite number of
maximum and minimum values and a finite number of discontinuities, and
if Ð2ππ fðxÞdx is finite, then the Fourier series converges to f(x) at
all points where f(x) is continuous, and at jump points it converges to
the arithmetic mean of the right-hand and left-hand limits of the
function. Also useful is another theorem known as Dirichlet’s test: If
the terms in the series a1b1 1a2b2 1 1anbn 1 are such that the b’s are
positive and monotonically tending toward zero, and if there is a number
M such that ja1 1a2 1 1amj,M for all values of m, then the series
converges.</p>
<p>The name of Dirichlet arises in many other connections in pure and
applied mathematics. Especially important in thermodynamics and
electrodynamics is the Dirichlet problem: Given a region R bounded by a
closed curve C and a function f(x, y) continuous on C, find a function
F(x, y) continuous in R and on C that satisfies the Laplace equation in
R and is equal to f on C. In pure mathematics, Dirichlet is well-known
for his application of analysis to the theory of numbers, in connection
with which he introduced the Dirichlet series, Σane2λnS, where the
Dirichlet coefficients an are complex numbers, the Dirichlet exponents
λn are real monotonically increasing numbers, and S is a complex
variable.</p>
