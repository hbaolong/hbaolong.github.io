<h4 id="chapter-4-hellenic-traditions">Chapter 4 Hellenic
Traditions</h4>
<p>To Thales . . . the primary question was not What do we know but How
do we know it. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p>—Aristotle</p>
<p>The Era and the Sources</p>
<p>The intellectual activity of the river valley civilizations in Egypt
and Mesopotamia had lost its verve well before the Christian era, but as
learning in the river valleys declined, and as bronze gave way to iron
in weaponry, vigorous new cultures sprang up all along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. To indicate this change in the centers of
civilization, the interval from roughly 800 BCE to 800 CE is sometimes
known as the Thalassic Age (that is, the “sea” age). There was no sharp
disruption to mark the transition in intellectual leadership from the
valleys of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers to the shores of the
Mediterranean. Egyptian and Babylonian scholars continued to produce
papyrus and cuneiform texts for many centuries after 800 BCE, but a new
civilization meanwhile was rapidly preparing to take over scholarly
hegemony, not only around the Mediterranean but, ultimately, in the
chief river valleys as well. To indicate the source of the new
inspiration, the first portion of the Thalassic Age is labeled the
Hellenic era, so that the older cultures are consequently known as
pre-Hellenic. The Greeks of today still call themselves Hellenes. Greek
history is traceable back into the second millennium BCE, when several
waves of invaders pressed down from the north. They brought with them no
known mathematical or literary tradition. They seem to have been very
eager to learn, however, and it did not take them long to improve on
what they absorbed. It is presumed that some rudiments of computation
traveled along trade routes. This is true of the early Greek alphabets
that had been taken over and expanded from the existing alphabet of the
Phoenicians, which consisted only of consonants. The alphabet seems to
have originated between the Babylonian and Egyptian worlds, possibly in
the region of the Sinai Peninsula, through a process of drastic
reduction in the number of cuneiform or hieratic symbols. This alphabet
found its way to the new colonies—Greek, Roman, and Carthaginian—through
the activities of traders. Before long, Greek traders, businessmen, and
scholars made their way to the centers of learning in Egypt and
Babylonia. There they made contact with pre-Hellenic mathematics, but
they were not willing merely to receive long-established traditions, for
they made the subject so thoroughly their own that it soon took a
drastically different form.</p>
<p>The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE, and by then, an
absorbing Greek literature had already developed. Of Greek mathematics
at the time we know nothing. Presumably, it lagged behind the
development of literary forms; the latter lend themselves more readily
to continuity of oral transmission. It would be almost another two
centuries before there was any word, even indirectly, concerning Greek
mathematics. Then, during the sixth century BCE, there appeared two men,
Thales and Pythagoras, to whom are ascribed definite mathematical
discoveries. They are somewhat indistinct figures, historically. No
mathematical masterpiece from either one has survived, nor is it even
established that either Thales or Pythagoras ever composed such a work.
Nevertheless, the earliest Greek accounts of the history of mathematics,
which no longer survive, ascribed to Thales and Pythagoras a number of
very definite discoveries in mathematics. We outline these contributions
in this chapter, but the reader should understand that it is largely
persistent tradition, rather than any extant historical document, on
which the account is based.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this situation prevails regarding any written
mathematical treatises or other works throughout the fifth century BCE.
There are virtually no extant mathematical or scientific documents until
we encounter those from the days of Plato in the fourth century BCE.
Nevertheless, during the last half of the fifth century, there
circulated persistent and consistent reports concerning a handful of
mathematicians who evidently were intensely concerned with problems that
formed the basis for most of the later developments in geometry. We
shall therefore refer to this period as the “Heroic Age of Mathematics,”
for seldom, either before or since, have men with so little to work with
tackled mathematical problems of such fundamental significance. No
longer was mathematical activity centered almost entirely in two regions
nearly at opposite ends of the Greek world; it flourished all around the
Mediterranean. In what is now southern Italy, there were Archytas of
Tarentum (born ca. 428 BCE) and Hippasus of Metapontum (fl. ca. 400
BCE); at Abdera in Thrace, we find Democritus (born ca. 460 BCE); nearer
the center of the Greek world, on the Attic peninsula, there was Hippias
of Elis (born ca. 460 BCE); and in nearby Athens, there lived at various
times during the pivotal last half of the fifth century BCE three
scholars from other regions: Hippocrates of Chios (fl. ca. 430 BCE),
Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (fl. 428 BCE), and Zeno of Elea (fl. ca. 450
BCE). Through the work of these seven men, we shall describe the
fundamental changes in mathematics that took place a little before the
year 400 BCE. Again, we must remember that although the histories of
Herodotus and Thucydides and the plays of Aeschylus, Euripides, and
Aristophanes have in some measure survived, scarcely a line is extant of
what was written by mathematicians of the time.</p>
<p>Firsthand mathematical sources from the fourth century BCE are almost
as scarce, but this inadequacy is made up for in large measure by
accounts written by philosophers who were au courant with the
mathematics of their day. We have most of what Plato wrote and about
half of the work of Aristotle; with the writings of these intellectual
leaders of the fourth century BCE as a guide, we can give a far more
dependable account of what happened in their day than we could about the
Heroic Age.</p>
<p>Thales and Pythagoras</p>
<p>Accounts of the origins of Greek mathematics center on the so-called
Ionian and Pythagorean schools and the chief representative of
each—Thales and Pythagoras—although, as just noted, reconstructions of
their thought rest on fragmentary reports and traditions built up during
later centuries. The Greek world had its center between the Aegean and
Ionian seas for many centuries, but Hellenic civilization was far from
localized there. By about 600 BCE, Greek settlements were scattered
along the borders of most of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea,
and it was in these outskirts that a new surge in mathematics developed.
In this respect, the sea-bordering colonists, especially in Ionia, had
two advantages: they had the bold and imaginative spirit typical of
pioneers, and they were in closer proximity to the two chief river
valleys where knowledge thrived. Thales of Miletus (ca. 624–548 BCE) and
Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 580–500 BCE) had a further advantage: they were
in a position to travel to centers of ancient learning and there acquire
firsthand information on astronomy and mathematics. In Egypt, they are
said to have learned geometry; in Babylon, under the enlightened
Chaldean ruler Nebuchadnezzar, Thales may have come in touch with
astronomical tables and instruments. Tradition has it that in 585 BCE,
Thales amazed his countrymen by predicting the solar eclipse of that
year. The historicity of this tradition is very much open to question,
however.</p>
<p>What is really known about the life and work of Thales is very little
indeed. Ancient opinion is unanimous in regarding Thales as an unusually
clever man and the first philosopher—by general agreement, the first of
the Seven Wise Men. He was regarded as “a pupil of the Egyptians and the
Chaldeans,” an assumption that appears plausible. The proposition now
known as the theorem of Thales—that an angle inscribed in a semicircle
is a right angle—may well have been learned by Thales during his travels
to Babylon. Tradition goes further, however, and attributes to him some
sort of demonstration of the theorem. For this reason, Thales has
frequently been hailed as the first true mathematician—as the originator
of the deductive organization of geometry. This report, or legend, was
embellished by adding to this theorem four others that Thales is said to
have proved:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A circle is bisected by a diameter.</p></li>
<li><p>The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.</p></li>
<li><p>The pairs of vertical angles formed by two intersecting lines are
equal.</p></li>
<li><p>If two triangles are such that two angles and a side of one are
equal, respectively, to two angles and a side of the other, then the
triangles are congruent.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There is no document from antiquity that can be pointed to as
evidence of this achievement, yet the tradition has been persistent.
About the nearest one can come to reliable evidence on this point is
derived from a source a thousand years after the time of Thales. A
student of Aristotle’s by the name of Eudemus of Rhodes (fl. ca. 320
BCE) wrote a history of mathematics. This has been lost, but before it
disappeared, someone had summarized at least part of the history. The
original of this summary has also been lost, but during the fifth
century of our era, information from the summary was incorporated by the
Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus (410–485) into the early pages of his
Commentary on the First Book of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>Designations of Thales as the first mathematician largely hinge on
the remarks of Proclus. Later in his Commentary, Proclus—again depending
on Eudemus—attributes to Thales the four theorems mentioned previously.
There are other scattered references to Thales in ancient sources, but
most of these describe his more practical activities. They do not
establish the bold conjecture that Thales created demonstrative
geometry, but in any case, Thales is the first man in history to whom
specific mathematical discoveries have been attributed.</p>
<p>That it was the Greeks who added the element of logical structure to
geometry is virtually universally admitted today, but the big question
remains whether this crucial step was taken by Thales or by others
later—perhaps as much as two centuries later. On this point, we must
suspend final judgment until there is additional evidence on the
development of Greek mathematics.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is scarcely less controversial a figure than Thales, for
he has been more thoroughly enmeshed in legend and apotheosis. Thales
had been a man of practical affairs, but Pythagoras was a prophet and a
mystic, born at Samos, one of the Dodecanese islands not far from
Miletus, the birthplace of Thales. Although some accounts picture
Pythagoras as having studied under Thales, this is rendered unlikely by
the half-century difference in their ages. Some similarity in their
interests can readily be accounted for by the fact that Pythagoras also
traveled to Egypt and Babylon—possibly even to India. During his
peregrinations, he evidently absorbed not only mathematical and
astronomical information but also much religious lore. Pythagoras was,
incidentally, virtually a contemporary of Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi
(Lao-tzu); the century was a crucial time in the development of
religion, as well as of mathematics. When Pythagoras returned to the
Greek world, he settled at Croton on the southeastern coast of what is
now Italy, but at that time was known as Magna Graecia. There he
established a secret society that somewhat resembled an Orphic cult,
except for its mathematical and philosophical basis.</p>
<p>That Pythagoras remains a very obscure figure is due in part to the
loss of documents from that age. Several biographies of Pythagoras were
written in antiquity, including one by Aristotle, but these have not
survived. A further difficulty in clearly identifying the figure of
Pythagoras lies in the fact that the order he established was communal
as well as secret. Knowledge and property were held in common, hence
attribution of discoveries was not to be made to a specific member of
the school. It is best, consequently, not to speak of the work of
Pythagoras, but rather of the contributions of the Pythagoreans,
although in antiquity it was customary to give all credit to the
master.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the Pythagorean order was
the confidence it maintained in the pursuit of philosophical and
mathematical studies as a moral basis for the conduct of life. The very
words “philosophy” (or “love of wisdom”) and “mathematics” (or “that
which is learned”) are supposed to have been coined by Pythagoras
himself to describe his intellectual activities.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Pythagoreans played an important role in the
history of mathematics. In Egypt and Mesopotamia, the elements of
arithmetic and geometry were primarily exercises in the application of
numerical procedures to specific problems, whether concerned with beer
or pyramids or the inheritance of land; we find nothing resembling a
philosophical discussion of principles. Thales is generally regarded as
having made a beginning in this direction, although tradition supports
the view of Eudemus and Proclus that the new emphasis in mathematics was
due primarily to the Pythagoreans. With them, mathematics was more
closely related to a love of wisdom than to the exigencies of practical
life. That Pythagoras was one of the most influential figures in history
is difficult to deny, for his followers, whether deluded or inspired,
spread their beliefs throughout most of the Greek world. The harmonies
and mysteries of philosophy and mathematics were essential parts of the
Pythagorean rituals. Never before or since has mathematics played so
large a role in life and religion as it did among the Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>The motto of the Pythagorean school is said to have been “All is
number.” Recalling that the Babylonians had attached numerical measures
to things around them, from the motions of the heavens to the values of
their slaves, we may perceive in the Pythagorean motto a strong
Mesopotamian affinity. The very theorem to which the name of Pythagoras
still clings quite likely was derived from the Babylonians. It has been
suggested, as justification for calling it the Theorem of Pythagoras,
that the Pythagoreans first provided a demonstration, but this
conjecture cannot be verified. It is reasonable to assume that the
earliest members of the Pythagorean school were familiar with geometric
properties known to the Babylonians, but when the Eudemus-Proclus
summary ascribes to them the construction of the “cosmic figures” (that
is, the regular solids), there is room for doubt. The cube, the
octahedron, and the dodecahedron could perhaps have been observed in
crystals, such as those of pyrite (iron disulfide), but a scholium in
Euclid’s Elements XIII reports that the Pythagoreans knew only three of
the regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube, and the dodecahedron.
Familiarity with the last figure is rendered plausible by the discovery
near Padua of an Etruscan dodecahedron of stone dating from before 500
BCE. It is not improbable, therefore, that even if the Pythagoreans did
not know of the octahedron and the icosahedron, they knew of some of the
properties of the regular pentagon. The figure of a five-pointed star
(which is formed by drawing the five diagonals of a pentagonal face of a
regular dodecahedron) is said to have been the special symbol of the
Pythagorean school. The star pentagon had appeared earlier in Babylonian
art, and it is possible that here, too, we find a connecting link
between pre-Hellenic and Pythagorean mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the tantalizing questions in Pythagorean geometry concerns the
construction of a pentagram or a star pentagon. If we begin with a
regular polygon ABCDE (Fig. 4.1) and draw the five diagonals, these
diagonals intersect in points A′B′C′D′E′, which form another regular
pentagon. Noting that the triangle BCD′, for example, is similar to the
isosceles triangle BCE, and noting also the many pairs of congruent
triangles in the diagram, it is not difficult to see that the diagonal
points A′B′C′D′E′ divide the diagonals in a striking manner. In each
case, a diagonal point divides a diagonal into two unequal segments such
that the ratio of the whole diagonal is to the larger segment as this
segment is to the smaller segment. This subdivision of a diagonal is the
well-known “golden section” of a line segment, but this name was not
used until a couple of thousand years later—just about the time when
Johannes Kepler wrote lyrically:</p>
<p>FIG. 4.1</p>
<p>Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras;
the other, the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first
we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious
jewel.</p>
<p>To the ancient Greeks, this type of subdivision soon became so
familiar that no need was felt for a special descriptive name; hence,
the longer designation “the division of a segment in mean and extreme
ratio” generally was replaced by the simple words “the section.”</p>
<p>One important property of “the section” is that it is, so to speak,
self-propagating. If a point P1 divides a segment RS (Fig. 4.2) in mean
and extreme ratio, with RP1 the longer segment, and if on this larger
segment we mark off a point P2 such that RP2 = P1S, then segment RP1
will in turn be subdivided in mean and extreme ratio at point P2. Again,
on marking off on RP2 point P3 such that RP3 = P2P1, segment RP2 will be
divided in mean and extreme ratio at P3. This iterative procedure can be
carried out as many times as desired, the result being an ever smaller
segment RPn divided in mean and extreme ratio by point Pn + 1. Whether
the earlier Pythagoreans noticed this unending process or drew
significant conclusions from it is not known. Even the more fundamental
question of whether the Pythagoreans of about 500 BCE could divide a
given segment into mean and extreme ratio cannot be answered with
certainty, although the probability that they could and did seems to be
high. The construction required is equivalent to the solution of a
quadratic equation. To show this, let RS = a and RP1 = x in Fig. 4.2.
Then, by the property of the golden section, a: x = x: (a − x), and on
multiplying means and extremes we have the equation x2 = a2 − ax. This
is a quadratic equation of type 1, as described in chapter 3, and
Pythagoras could have learned from the Babylonians how to solve this
equation algebraically. If a is a rational number, however, then there
is no rational number x satisfying the equation. Did Pythagoras realize
this? It seems unlikely. Perhaps instead of the Babylonian algebraic
type of solution, the Pythagoreans may have adopted a geometric
procedure similar to that found in Euclid’s Elements II.11 and VI.30. To
divide a line segment AB in mean and extreme ratio, Euclid first
constructed on the segment AB the square ABCD (Fig. 4.3). Then, he
bisected AC at point E, drew line segment EB, and extended line CEA to F
so that EF = EB. When the square AFGH is completed, point H will be the
point desired, for one can readily show that AB: AH = AH: HB. Knowing
what solution, if any, the earlier Pythagoreans used for the golden
section would go far toward clarifying the problem of the level and the
characteristics of pre-Socratic mathematics. If Pythagorean mathematics
began under a Babylonian aegis, with strong faith that all is number,
how (and when) did it happen that this gave way to the familiar emphasis
on pure geometry that is so firmly enshrined in the classical
treatises?</p>
<p>FIG. 4.2</p>
<p>FIG. 4.3</p>
<p>Number Mysticism</p>
<p>Number mysticism was not original with the Pythagoreans. The number
7, for example, had been singled out for special awe, presumably on
account of the seven wandering stars or planets from which the week
(hence our names for the days of the week) is derived. The Pythagoreans
were not the only people who fancied that the odd numbers had male
attributes and the even female—with the related (and not unprejudiced)
assumption, found as late as Shakespeare, that “there is divinity in odd
numbers.” Many early civilizations shared various aspects of numerology,
but the Pythagoreans carried number worship to its extreme, basing their
philosophy and their way of life on it. The number 1, they argued, is
the generator of numbers and the number of reason; the number 2 is the
first even or female number, the number of opinion; 3 is the first true
male number, the number of harmony, being composed of unity and
diversity; 4 is the number of justice or retribution, indicating the
squaring of accounts; 5 is the number of marriage, the union of the
first true male and female numbers; and 6 is the number of creation.
Each number in turn had its peculiar attributes. The holiest of all was
the number 10, or the tetractys, for it represented the number of the
universe, including the sum of all of the possible geometric dimensions.
A single point is the generator of dimensions, two points determine a
line of dimension one, three points (not on a line) determine a triangle
with area of dimension two, and four points (not in a plane) determine a
tetrahedron with volume of dimension three; the sum of the numbers
representing all dimensions, therefore, is the reversed number 10. It is
a tribute to the abstraction of Pythagorean mathematics that the
veneration of the number 10 evidently was not dictated by the anatomy of
the human hand or foot.</p>
<p>Arithmetic and Cosmology</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, geometry had been not much more than number applied
to spatial extension; it appears that, at first, it may have been much
the same among the Pythagoreans—but with a modification. Number in Egypt
had been the domain of the natural numbers and the unit fractions; among
the Babylonians, it had been the field of all rational fractions. In
Greece, the word “number” was used only for the integers. A fraction was
not looked on as a single entity but as a ratio or relationship between
two whole numbers. (Greek mathematics, in its earlier stages, frequently
came closer to the “modern” mathematics of today than to the ordinary
arithmetic of a generation ago.) As Euclid later expressed it (Elements
V.3), “A ratio is a kind of relation in respect of size of two
magnitudes of the same kind.” Such a view, focusing attention on the
connection between pairs of numbers, tends to sharpen the theoretical or
rational aspects of the number concept and to deemphasize the role of
number as a tool in computation or approximation in mensuration.
Arithmetic now could be thought of as an intellectual discipline as well
as a technique, and a transition to such an outlook seems to have been
nurtured in the Pythagorean school.</p>
<p>If tradition is to be trusted, the Pythagoreans not only established
arithmetic as a branch of philosophy; they seem to have made it the
basis of a unification of all aspects of the world around them. Through
patterns of points, or unextended units, they associated number with
geometric extension; this in turn led them to an arithmetic of the
heavens. Philolaus (died ca. 390 BCE), a later Pythagorean who shared
the veneration of the tetractys or decad, wrote that it was “great,
all-powerful and all-producing, the beginning and the guide of the
divine as of the terrestrial life.” This view of the number 10 as the
perfect number, the symbol of health and harmony, seems to have provided
the inspiration for the earliest nongeocentric astronomical system.
Philolaus postulated that at the center of the universe, there was a
central fire about which the earth and the seven planets (including the
sun and the moon) revolved uniformly. Inasmuch as this brought to only
nine the number of heavenly bodies (other than the sphere of fixed
stars), the Philolaic system assumed the existence of a tenth body—a
“counterearth” collinear with the earth and the central fire—having the
same period as the earth in its daily revolution about the central fire.
The sun revolved about the fire once a year, and the fixed stars were
stationary. The earth in its motion maintained the same uninhabited face
toward the central fire, hence neither the fire nor the counterearth was
ever seen. The postulate of uniform circular motion that the
Pythagoreans adopted was to dominate astronomical thought for more than
2,000 years. Copernicus, almost 2,000 years later, accepted this
assumption without question, and it was the Pythagoreans to whom
Copernicus referred to show that his doctrine of a moving earth was not
so new or revolutionary.</p>
<p>The thoroughness with which the Pythagoreans wove number into their
thought is well illustrated by their concern for figurate numbers.
Although no triangle can be formed by fewer than three points, it is
possible to have triangles of a larger number of points, such as six,
ten, or fifteen (see Fig. 4.4). Numbers such as 3, 6, 10, and 15 or, in
general, numbers given by the formula</p>
<p>were called triangular, and the triangular pattern for the number 10,
the holy tetractys, vied with the pentagon for veneration in Pythagorean
number theory. There were, of course, indefinitely many other categories
of privileged numbers. Successive square numbers are formed from the
sequence 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + . . . + (2n − 1), where each odd number in turn
was looked on as a pattern of dots resembling a gnomon (the Babylonian
shadow clock) placed around two sides of the preceding square pattern of
dots (see Fig. 4.4). Hence, the word “gnomon” (related to the word for
“knowing”) came to be attached to the odd numbers themselves.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.4</p>
<p>The sequence of even numbers, 2 + 4 + 6 + . . . + 2n = n(n + 1),
produces what the Greeks called “oblong numbers,” each of which is
double a triangular number. Pentagonal patterns of points illustrated
the pentagonal numbers given by the sequence</p>
<p>and hexagonal numbers were derived from the sequence</p>
<p>In a similar manner, polygonal numbers of all orders are designated;
the process, of course, is easily extended to three-dimensional space,
where one deals with polyhedral numbers. Emboldened by such views,
Philolaus is reported to have maintained that</p>
<p>All things which can be known have number; for it is not possible
that without number anything can be either conceived or known.</p>
<p>The dictum of Philolaus seems to have been a tenet of the Pythagorean
school; hence, stories arose about the discovery by Pythagoras of some
simple laws of music. Pythagoras is reputed to have noticed that when
the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of simple
whole numbers, such as 2 to 3 (for the fifth) or as 3 to 4 (for the
fourth), the tones will be harmonious. If, in other words, a string
sounds the note C when plucked, then a similar string twice as long will
sound the note C an octave below, and tones between these two notes are
emitted by strings whose lengths are given by intermediate ratios: 16:9
for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in
ascending order. Here we have perhaps the earliest quantitative laws of
acoustics—possibly the oldest of all quantitative physical laws. So
boldly imaginative were the early Pythagoreans that they hastily
extrapolated to conclude that the heavenly bodies in their motions
similarly emitted harmonious tones, the “harmony of the spheres.”
Pythagorean science, like Pythagorean mathematics, seems to have been an
odd congeries of sober thought and fanciful speculation. The doctrine of
a spherical earth is often ascribed to Pythagoras, but it is not known
whether this conclusion was based on observation (perhaps of new
constellations as Pythagoras traveled southward) or on imagination. The
very idea that the universe is a “cosmos,” or a harmoniously ordered
whole, seems to be a related Pythagorean contribution—one that at the
time had little basis in direct observation but that has been enormously
fruitful in the development of astronomy. As we smile at ancient number
fancies, we should at the same time be aware of the impulse these gave
to the development of both mathematics and science. The Pythagoreans
were among the earliest people to believe that the operations of nature
could be understood through mathematics.</p>
<p>Proportions</p>
<p>Proclus, quoting perhaps from Eudemus, ascribed to Pythagoras two
specific mathematical discoveries: (1) the construction of the regular
solids and (2) the theory of proportionals. Although there is question
about the extent to which this is to be taken literally, there is every
likelihood that the statement correctly reflects the direction of
Pythagorean thought. The theory of proportions clearly fits into the
pattern of early Greek mathematical interests, and it is not difficult
to find a likely source of inspiration. It is reported that Pythagoras
learned in Mesopotamia of three means—the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the subcontrary (later called the harmonic)—and of the “golden
proportion” relating two of these: the first of two numbers is to their
arithmetic mean as their harmonic mean is to the second of the numbers.
This relationship is the essence of the Babylonian square-root
algorithm; hence, the report is at least plausible. At some stage,
however, the Pythagoreans generalized this work by adding seven new
means to make ten in all. If b is the mean of a and c, where a &lt; c,
then the three quantities are related according to one of the following
ten equations:</p>
<p>The first three equations are, of course, the equations for the
arithmetic, the geometric, and the harmonic means, respectively.</p>
<p>It is difficult to assign a date to the Pythagorean study of means,
and similar problems arise with respect to the classification of
numbers. The study of proportions or the equality of ratios presumably
formed at first a part of Pythagorean arithmetic or theory of numbers.
Later, the quantities a, b, and c entering in such proportions were more
likely to be regarded as geometric magnitudes, but the period in which
the change took place is not clear. In addition to the polygonal numbers
mentioned previously and the distinction between odd and even, the
Pythagoreans at some stage spoke of odd-odd and even-odd numbers, based
on whether the number in question was the product of two odd numbers or
of an odd and an even number, so that sometimes the name “even number”
was reserved for integral powers of two. By the time of Philolaus, the
distinction between prime and composite numbers seems to have become
important. Speusippus, a nephew of Plato and his successor as head of
the Academy, asserted that 10 was “perfect” for the Pythagoreans
because, among other things, it is the smallest integer n for which
there are just as many primes between 1 and n as nonprimes.
(Occasionally, prime numbers were called linear, inasmuch as they are
usually represented by dots in one dimension only.) Neopythagoreans
sometimes excluded 2 from the list of primes on the ground that 1 and 2
are not true numbers, but the generators of the odd and even numbers.
The primacy of the odd numbers was assumed to be established by the fact
that odd + odd is even, whereas even + even remains even.</p>
<p>To the Pythagoreans has been attributed the rule for Pythagorean
triads given by (m2 − 1)/2, m, (m2 + 1)/2, where m is an odd integer,
but inasmuch as this rule is so closely related to the Babylonian
examples, it is perhaps not an independent discovery. Also ascribed to
the Pythagoreans, with doubt as to the period in question, are the
definitions of perfect, abundant, and deficient numbers, based on
whether the sum of the proper divisors of the number is equal to,
greater than, or less than the number itself. According to this
definition, 6 is the smallest perfect number, with 28 next. That this
view was probably a later development in Pythagorean thought is
suggested by the early veneration of 10 rather than 6. Hence, the
related doctrine of “amicable” numbers is also likely to have been a
later notion. Two integers a and b are said to be “amicable” if a is the
sum of the proper divisors of b and if b is the sum of the proper
divisors of a. The smallest such pair are the integers 220 and 284.</p>
<p>Numeration</p>
<p>The Hellenes were celebrated as shrewd traders and businessmen, and
there must have been a lower level of arithmetic or computation that
satisfied the needs of the vast majority of Greek citizens. Number
activities of this type would have been beneath the notice of
philosophers, and recorded accounts of practical arithmetic were
unlikely to find their way into the libraries of scholars. If, then,
there are not even fragments surviving of the more sophisticated
Pythagorean works, it is clear that it would be unreasonable to expect
manuals of trade mathematics to survive the ravages of time. Hence, it
is not possible to tell at this distance how the ordinary processes of
arithmetic were carried out in Greece 2,500 years ago. About the best
one can do is to describe the systems of numeration that appear to have
been in use.</p>
<p>In general, there seem to have been two chief systems of numeration
in Greece: one, probably the earlier, is known as the Attic (or
Herodianic) notation; the other is called the Ionian (or alphabetic)
system. Both systems are, for integers, based on the 10 scale, but the
former is the more primitive, being based on a simple iterative scheme
found in the earlier Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration and in the later
Roman numerals. In the Attic system, the numbers from 1 to 4 were
represented by repeated vertical strokes. For the number 5 a new
symbol—the first letter Π (or Γ) of the word for five, “pente”—was
adopted. (Only capital letters were used at the time, both in literary
works and in mathematics, lowercase letters being an invention of the
later ancient or early medieval period.) For numbers from 6 through 9,
the Attic system combined the symbol Γ with unit strokes, so that 8, for
example, was written as . For positive integral powers of the base (10),
the initial letters of the corresponding number words were adopted— for
deka (10), for hekaton (100), for khilioi (1,000), and for myrioi
(10,000). Except for the forms of the symbols, the Attic system is much
like the Roman, but it had one advantage. Where the Latin word adopted
distinctive symbols for 50 and 500, the Greeks wrote these numbers by
combining letters for 5, 10, and 100, using (or 5 times 10) for 50, and
(or 5 times 100) for 500. In the same way, they wrote for 5,000 and for
50,000. In Attic script, the number 45,678, for example, would appear
as</p>
<p>The Attic system of notation (also known as Herodianic, inasmuch as
it was described in a fragment attributed to Herodian, a grammarian of
the second century) appears in inscriptions at various dates from 454 to
95 BCE, but by the early Alexandrian Age, at about the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphius, it was being displaced by the Ionian or alphabetic
numerals. Similar alphabetic schemes were used at one time or another by
various Semitic peoples, including the Hebrews, the Syrians, the
Aramaeans, and the Arabs—as well as by other cultures, such as the
Gothic—but these would seem to have been borrowed from the Greek
notation. The Ionian system probably was used as early as the fifth
century BCE and perhaps as early as the eighth century BCE. One reason
for placing the origin of the notation relatively early is that the
scheme called for twenty-seven letters of the alphabet—nine for the
integers less than 10, nine for multiples of 10 that are less than 100,
and nine for multiples of 100 that are less than 1,000. The classical
Greek alphabet contains only twenty-four letters; hence, use was made of
an older alphabet that included three additional archaic letters— (vau
or digamma or stigma), (koppa), and (sampi)—to establish the following
association of letters and numbers:</p>
<p>After the introduction of small letters in Greece, the association of
letters and numbers appeared as follows:</p>
<p>Because these forms are more familiar today, we shall use them here.
For the first nine multiples of 1,000, the Ionian system adopted the
first nine letters of the alphabet, a partial use of the positional
principle, but for added clarity, these letters were preceded by a
stroke or accent:</p>
<p>Within this system, any number less than 10,000 was easily written
with only four characters. The number 8888, for example, would appear as
or as , the accent sometimes being omitted when the context was clear.
The use of the same letters for thousands as for units should have
suggested to the Greeks the full-fledged positional scheme in decimal
arithmetic, but they do not seem to have appreciated the advantages of
such a move. That they had such a principle more or less in mind is
evident not only in the repeated use of the letters α through θ for
units and thousands, but also in the fact that the symbols are arranged
in order of magnitude, from the smallest on the right to the largest on
the left. At 10,000, which for the Greeks was the beginning of a new
count or category (much as we separate thousands from lower powers by a
comma), the Ionian Greek notation adopted a multiplicative principle. A
symbol for an integer from 1 to 9999, when placed above the letter M, or
after it, separated from the rest of the number by a dot, indicated the
product of the integer and the number 10,000—the Greek myriad. Thus, the
number 88888888 would appear as . Where still larger numbers are called
for, the same principle could be applied to the double myriad, 100000000
or 108. Early Greek notations for integers were not excessively awkward,
and they served their purposes effectively. It was in the use of
fractions that the systems were weak.</p>
<p>Like the Egyptians, the Greeks were tempted to use unit fractions,
and for these they had a simple representation. They wrote down the
denominator and then simply followed this with a diacritical mark or
accent to distinguish it from the corresponding integer. Thus, would
appear as . This could, of course, be confused with the number , but
context or the use of words could be assumed to make the situation
clear. In later centuries, general common fractions and sexagesimal
fractions were in use; these will be discussed below in connection with
the work of Archimedes, Ptolemy, and Diophantus, for there are extant
documents that, while not actually dating from the time of these men,
are copies of works written by them—a situation strikingly different
from that concerning mathematicians of the Hellenic period.</p>
<p>Arithmetic and Logistic</p>
<p>Because documents from the period are entirely missing, there is far
more uncertainty about Greek mathematics from 600 to 450 BCE than about
Babylonian algebra or Egyptian geometry from about 1700 BCE. Not even
mathematical artifacts have survived from the early days of Greece. It
is evident that some form of counting board or abacus was used in
calculation, but the nature and operation of the device must be inferred
from the Roman abacus and from some casual references in works by Greek
authors. Herodotus, writing in the early fifth century BCE, said that in
counting with pebbles, as in writing, the Greek hand moved from left to
right, the Egyptian from right to left. A vase from a somewhat later
period pictures a collector of tribute with a counting board, which was
used not only for integral decimal multiples of the drachma but for
nondecimal fractional subdivisions. Beginning on the left, the columns
designate myriads, thousands, hundreds, and tens of drachmas
respectively, the symbols being in Herodianic notation. Then, following
the units column for drachmas, there are columns for obols (six obols =
one drachma), for the half obol, and for the quarter obol. Here we see
how ancient civilizations avoided an excessive use of fractions: they
simply subdivided units of length, weight, and money so effectively that
they could calculate in terms of integral multiples of the subdivisions.
This undoubtedly is the explanation for the popularity in antiquity of
duodecimal and sexagesimal subdivisions, for the decimal system here is
at a severe disadvantage. Decimal fractions were rarely used, either by
the Greeks or by other Western peoples, before the period of the
Renaissance. The abacus can be readily adapted to any system of
numeration or to any combination of systems; it is likely that the
widespread use of the abacus accounts at least in part for the amazingly
late development of a consistent positional system of notation for
integers and fractions. In this respect, the Pythagorean Age contributed
little if anything.</p>
<p>The point of view of the Pythagoreans seems to have been so
overwhelmingly philosophical and abstract that technical details in
computation were relegated to a separate discipline, called logistic.
This dealt with the numbering of things, rather than with the essence
and properties of number as such, matters of concern in arithmetic. That
is, the ancient Greeks made a clear distinction between mere
calculation, on the one hand, and what today is known as the theory of
numbers, on the other. Whether such a sharp distinction was a
disadvantage to the historical development of mathematics may be a moot
point, but it is not easy to deny to the early Ionian and Pythagorean
mathematicians the primary role in establishing mathematics as a
rational and liberal discipline. It is obvious that tradition can be
quite inaccurate, but it is seldom entirely misdirected.</p>
<p>Fifth-Century Athens</p>
<p>The fifth century BCE was a crucial period in the history of Western
civilization, for it opened with the defeat of the Persian invaders and
closed with the surrender of Athens to Sparta. Between these two events
lay the great Age of Pericles, with its accomplishments in literature
and art. The prosperity and intellectual atmosphere of Athens during the
century attracted scholars from all parts of the Greek world, and a
synthesis of diverse aspects was achieved. From Ionia came men such as
Anaxagoras, with a practical turn of mind; from southern Italy came
others, such as Zeno, with stronger metaphysical inclinations.
Democritus of Abdera espoused a materialistic view of the world, while
Pythagoras in Italy held idealistic attitudes in science and philosophy.
In Athens, one found eager devotees of old and new branches of learning,
from cosmology to ethics. There was a bold spirit of free inquiry that
sometimes came into conflict with established mores.</p>
<p>In particular, Anaxagoras was imprisoned in Athens for impiety in
asserting that the sun was not a deity but a huge red-hot stone as big
as the whole Peloponnesus, and that the moon was an inhabited earth that
borrowed its light from the sun. He well represents the spirit of
rational inquiry, for he regarded as the aim of his life the study of
the nature of the universe—a purposefulness that he derived from the
Ionian tradition of which Thales had been a founder. The intellectual
enthusiasm of Anaxagoras was shared with his countrymen through the
first scientific best-seller—a book On Nature—which could be bought in
Athens for only a drachma. Anaxagoras was a teacher of Pericles, who saw
to it that his mentor was ultimately released from prison. Socrates was
at first attracted to the scientific ideas of Anaxagoras but found the
naturalistic Ionian view less satisfying than the search for ethical
verities. Greek science had been rooted in a highly intellectual
curiosity that is often contrasted with the utilitarian immediacy of
pre-Hellenic thought; Anaxagoras clearly represented the typical Greek
motive—the desire to know. In mathematics also, the Greek attitude
differed sharply from that of the earlier potamic cultures. The contrast
was clear in the contributions generally attributed to Thales and
Pythagoras, and it continues to show through in the more reliable
reports about what went on in Athens during the Heroic Age. Anaxagoras
was primarily a natural philosopher, rather than a mathematician, but
his inquiring mind led him to share in the pursuit of mathematical
problems.</p>
<p>Three Classical Problems</p>
<p>We are told by Plutarch that while Anaxagoras was in prison, he
occupied himself with an attempt to square the circle. Here we have the
first mention of a problem that was to fascinate mathematicians for more
than 2,000 years. There are no further details concerning the origin of
the problem or the rules governing it. At a later date, it came to be
understood that the required square, exactly equal in area to the
circle, was to be constructed by the use of a compass and a straightedge
alone. Here we see a type of mathematics that is quite unlike that of
the Egyptians and the Babylonians. It is not the practical application
of a science of number to a facet of life experience, but a theoretical
question involving a nice distinction between accuracy in approximation
and exactitude in thought.</p>
<p>Anaxagoras died in 428 BCE, the year that Archytas was born, just one
year before Plato’s birth and one year after Pericles’ death. It is said
that Pericles died of the plague that carried off perhaps a quarter of
the Athenian population, and the deep impression that this catastrophe
created is perhaps the origin of a second famous mathematical problem.
It is reported that a delegation had been sent to the oracle of Apollo
at Delos to inquire how the plague could be averted, and the oracle had
replied that the cubical altar to Apollo must be doubled. The Athenians
are said to have dutifully doubled the dimensions of the altar, but this
was of no avail in curbing the plague. The altar had, of course, been
increased eightfold in volume, rather than twofold. Here, according to
the legend, was the origin of the “duplication of the cube” problem, one
that henceforth was usually referred to as the “Delian problem”—given
the edge of a cube, construct with compasses and straightedge alone the
edge of a second cube having double the volume of the first.</p>
<p>At about the same time, there circulated in Athens still a third
celebrated problem: given an arbitrary angle, construct by means of
compasses and straightedge alone an angle one-third as large as the
given angle. These three problems—the squaring of the circle, the
duplication of the cube, and the trisection of the angle—have since been
known as the “three famous (or classical) problems” of antiquity. More
than 2,200 years later, it was to be proved that all three of the
problems were unsolvable by means of straightedge and compass alone.
Nevertheless, the better part of Greek mathematics and of much later
mathematical thought was suggested by efforts to achieve the
impossible—or, failing this, to modify the rules. The Heroic Age failed
in its immediate objective, under the rules, but the efforts were
crowned with brilliant success in other respects.</p>
<p>Quadrature of Lunes</p>
<p>Somewhat younger than Anaxagoras and coming originally from about the
same part of the Greek world was Hippocrates of Chios. He should not be
confused with his still more celebrated contemporary, the physician
Hippocrates of Cos. Both Cos and Chios are islands in the Dodecanese
group, but in about 430 BCE, Hippocrates of Chios left his native land
for Athens in his capacity as a merchant. Aristotle reported that
Hippocrates was less shrewd than Thales and that he lost his money in
Byzantium through fraud; others say that he was beset by pirates. In any
case, the incident was never regretted by the victim, for he counted
this his good fortune, in that as a consequence he turned to the study
of geometry, in which he achieved remarkable success—a story typical of
the Heroic Age. Proclus wrote that Hippocrates composed an “Elements of
Geometry,” anticipating by more than a century the better-known Elements
of Euclid. Yet the textbook of Hippocrates—as well as another reported
to have been written by Leon, a later associate of the Platonic
school—has been lost, although it was known to Aristotle. In fact, no
mathematical treatise from the fifth century has survived, but we do
have a fragment concerning Hippocrates that Simplicius (fl. ca. 520 CE)
claims to have copied literally from the History of Mathematics (now
lost) by Eudemus. This brief statement, the nearest thing we have to an
original source on the mathematics of the time, describes a portion of
the work of Hippocrates dealing with the quadrature of lunes. A lune is
a figure bounded by two circular arcs of unequal radii; the problem of
the quadrature of lunes undoubtedly arose from that of squaring the
circle. The Eudemian fragment attributes to Hippocrates the following
theorem:</p>
<p>Similar segments of circles are in the same ratio as the squares on
their bases.</p>
<p>The Eudemian account reports that Hippocrates demonstrated this by
first showing that the areas of two circles are to each other as the
squares on their diameters. Here Hippocrates adopted the language and
the concept of proportion that played so large a role in Pythagorean
thought. In fact, it is thought by some that Hippocrates became a
Pythagorean. The Pythagorean school in Croton had been suppressed
(possibly because of its secrecy, perhaps because of its conservative
political tendencies), but the scattering of its adherents throughout
the Greek world served only to broaden the influence of the school. This
influence undoubtedly was felt, directly or indirectly, by
Hippocrates.</p>
<p>The theorem of Hippocrates on the areas of circles seems to be the
earliest precise statement on curvilinear mensuration in the Greek
world. Eudemus believed that Hippocrates gave a proof of the theorem,
but a rigorous demonstration at that time (say, about 430 BCE) would
appear to be unlikely. The theory of proportions at that stage probably
was established only for commensurable magnitudes. The proof as given in
Euclid XII.2 comes from Eudoxus, a man who lived halfway in time between
Hippocrates and Euclid. Just as much of the material in the first two
books of Euclid seems to stem from the Pythagoreans, however, so it
would appear reasonable to assume that the formulations, at least, of
much of Books III and IV of the Elements came from the work of
Hippocrates. Moreover, if Hippocrates did give a demonstration of this
theorem on the areas of circles, he may have been responsible for the
introduction into mathematics of the indirect method of proof. That is,
the ratio of the areas of two circles is equal to the ratio of the
squares on the diameters or it is not. By a reductio ad absurdum from
the second of the two possibilities, the proof of the only alternative
is established.</p>
<p>From this theorem on the areas of circles, Hippocrates readily found
the first rigorous quadrature of a curvilinear area in the history of
mathematics. He began with a semicircle circumscribed about an isosceles
right triangle, and on the base (hypotenuse) he constructed a segment
similar to the circular segments on the sides of the right triangle
(Fig. 4.5). Because the segments are to each other as squares on their
bases and from the Pythagorean theorem as applied to the right triangle,
the sum of the two small circular segments is equal to the larger
circular segment. Hence, the difference between the semicircle on AC and
the segment ADCE equals triangle ABC. Therefore, the lune ABCD is
precisely equal to triangle ABC, and because triangle ABC is equal to
the square on half of AC, the quadrature of the lune has been found.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.5</p>
<p>Eudemus also described a Hippocratean lune quadrature based on an
isosceles trapezoid, ABCD, inscribed in a circle so that the square on
the longest side (base), AD, is equal to the sum of the squares on the
three equal shorter sides, AB and BC and CD (Fig. 4.6). Then, if on side
AD one constructs a circular segment, AEDF, similar to those on the
three equal sides, lune ABCDE is equal to trapezoid ABCDF.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.6</p>
<p>That we are on relatively firm ground historically in describing the
quadrature of lunes by Hippocrates is indicated by the fact that
scholars other than Simplicius also refer to this work. Simplicius lived
in the sixth century, but he depended not only on Eudemus (fl. ca. 320
BCE) but also on Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE), one of the
chief commentators on Aristotle. Alexander described two quadratures
other than those given previously. (1) If on the hypotenuse and the
sides of an isosceles right triangle one constructs semicircles (Fig.
4.7), then the lunes created on the smaller sides together equal the
triangle. (2) If on a diameter of a semicircle one constructs an
isosceles trapezoid with three equal sides (Fig. 4.8), and if on the
three equal sides semicircles are constructed, then the trapezoid is
equal in area to the sum of four curvilinear areas: the three equal
lunes and a semicircle on one of the equal sides of the trapezoid. From
the second of these quadratures, it would follow that if the lunes can
be squared, the semicircle—hence, the circle—can also be squared. This
conclusion seems to have encouraged Hippocrates, as well as his
contemporaries and early successors, to hope that ultimately the circle
would be squared.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.7</p>
<p>FIG. 4.8</p>
<p>The Hippocratean quadratures are significant not so much as attempts
at circle-squaring as indications of the level of mathematics at the
time. They show that Athenian mathematicians were adept at handling
transformations of areas and proportions. In particular, there was
evidently no difficulty in converting a rectangle of sides a and b into
a square. This required finding the mean proportional or geometric mean
between a and b. That is, if a: x = x: b, geometers of the day easily
constructed the line x. It was natural, therefore, that geometers should
seek to generalize the problem by inserting two means between two given
magnitudes a and b. That is, given two line segments a and b, they hoped
to construct two other segments x and y such that a: x = x: y = y: b.
Hippocrates is said to have recognized that this problem is equivalent
to that of duplicating the cube, for if b = 2a, the continued
proportions, on the elimination of y, lead to the conclusion that x3 =
2a3.</p>
<p>There are three views on what Hippocrates deduced from his quadrature
of lunes. Some have accused him of believing that he could square all
lunes, hence also the circle; others think that he knew the limitations
of his work, concerned as it was with only some types of lunes. At least
one scholar has held that Hippocrates knew he had not squared the circle
but tried to deceive his countrymen into thinking that he had succeeded.
There are other questions, too, concerning Hippocrates’ contributions,
for to him has been ascribed, with some uncertainty, the first use of
letters in geometric figures. It is interesting to note that whereas he
advanced two of the three famous problems, he seems to have made no
progress in the trisecting of the angle, a problem studied somewhat
later by Hippias of Elis.</p>
<p>Hippias of Elis</p>
<p>Toward the end of the fifth century BCE, a group of professional
teachers quite unlike the Pythagoreans flourished in Athens. Disciples
of Pythagoras had been forbidden to accept payment for sharing their
knowledge with others. The Sophists, however, openly supported
themselves by tutoring fellow citizens—not only in honest intellectual
endeavor, but also in the art of “making the worse appear the better.”
To a certain extent, the accusation of shallowness directed against the
Sophists was warranted, but this should not conceal the fact that
Sophists were usually very broadly informed in many fields and that some
of them made real contributions to learning. Among these was Hippias, a
native of Elis who was active in Athens in the second half of the fifth
century BCE. He is one of the earliest mathematicians of whom we have
firsthand information, for we learn much about him from Plato’s
dialogues. We read, for example, that Hippias boasted that he had made
more money than any two other Sophists. He is said to have written much,
from mathematics to oratory, but none of his work has survived. He had a
remarkable memory, he boasted immense learning, and he was skilled in
handicrafts. To this Hippias (there are many others in Greece who bore
the same name), we apparently owe the introduction into mathematics of
the first curve beyond the circle and the straight line; Proclus and
other commentators ascribe to him the curve since known as the
trisectrix or quadratrix of Hippias. This is drawn as follows: In the
square ABCD (Fig. 4.9), let side AB move down uniformly from its present
position until it coincides with DC, and let this motion take place in
exactly the same time that side DA rotates clockwise from its present
position until it coincides with DC. If the positions of the two moving
lines at any given time are given by A′B′ and DA″, respectively, and if
P is the point of intersection of A′B′ and DA″, the locus of P during
the motions will be the trisectrix of Hippias—curve APQ in the figure.
Given this curve, the trisection of an angle is carried out with ease.
For example, if PDC is the angle to be trisected, one simply trisects
segments B′C and A′D at points R, S, T, and U. If lines TR and US cut
the trisectrix in V and W, respectively, lines VD and WD will, by the
property of the trisectrix, divide angle PDC in three equal parts.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.9</p>
<p>The curve of Hippias is generally known as the quadratrix, because it
can be used to square the circle. Whether Hippias himself was aware of
this application cannot now be determined. It has been conjectured that
Hippias knew of this method of quadrature but that he was unable to
justify it. Since the quadrature through Hippias’s curve was
specifically given later by Dinostratus, we shall describe this work
below.</p>
<p>Hippias lived at least as late as Socrates (d. 399 BCE), and from the
pen of Plato we have an unflattering account of him as a typical
Sophist—vain, boastful, and acquisitive. Socrates is reported to have
described Hippias as handsome and learned but boastful and shallow.
Plato’s dialogue on Hippias satirizes his show of knowledge, and
Xenophon’s Memorabilia includes an unflattering account of Hippias as
one who regarded himself an expert in everything from history and
literature to handicrafts and science. In judging such accounts,
however, we must remember that Plato and Xenophon were uncompromisingly
opposed to the Sophists in general. It is also well to bear in mind that
both Protagoras, the “founding father of the Sophists,” and Socrates,
the arch opponent of the movement, were antagonistic to mathematics and
the sciences. With respect to character, Plato contrasts Hippias with
Socrates, but one can bring out much the same contrast by comparing
Hippias with another contemporary—the Pythagorean mathematician Archytas
of Tarentum.</p>
<p>Philolaus and Archytas of Tarentum</p>
<p>Pythagoras is said to have retired to Metapontum toward the end of
his life and to have died there about 500 BCE. Tradition holds that he
left no written works, but his ideas were carried on by a large number
of eager disciples. The center at Croton was abandoned when a rival
political group from Sybaris surprised and murdered many of the leaders,
but those who escaped the massacre carried the doctrines of the school
to other parts of the Greek world. Among those who received instruction
from the refugees was Philolaus of Tarentum, and he is said to have
written the first account of Pythagoreanism—permission having been
granted, so the story goes, to repair his damaged fortunes. Apparently,
it was this book from which Plato derived his knowledge of the
Pythagorean order. The number fanaticism that was so characteristic of
the brotherhood evidently was shared by Philolaus, and it was from his
account that much of the mystical lore concerning the tetractys was
derived, as well as knowledge of the Pythagorean cosmology. The
Philolaean cosmic scheme is said to have been modified by two later
Pythagoreans, Ecphantus and Hicetas, who abandoned the central fire and
the counterearth and explained day and night by placing a rotating earth
at the center of the universe. The extremes of Philolaean number worship
also seem to have undergone some modification, more especially at the
hands of Archytas, a student of Philolaus’s at Tarentum.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean sect had exerted a strong intellectual influence
throughout Magna Graecia, with political overtones that may be described
as a sort of “reactionary international,” or perhaps better as a cross
between Orphism and Freemasonry. At Croton, political aspects were
especially noticeable, but at outlying Pythagorean centers, such as
Tarentum, the impact was primarily intellectual. Archytas believed
firmly in the efficacy of number; his rule of the city, which allotted
him autocratic powers, was just and restrained, for he regarded reason
as a force working toward social amelioration. For many years in
succession, he was elected general, and he was never defeated, yet he
was kind and a lover of children, for whom he is reported to have
invented “Archytas’s rattle.” Possibly also the mechanical dove, which
he is said to have fashioned of wood, was built to amuse the young
folk.</p>
<p>Archytas continued the Pythagorean tradition in placing arithmetic
above geometry, but his enthusiasm for number had less of the religious
and mystical admixture found earlier in Philolaus. He wrote on the
application of the arithmetic, geometric, and subcontrary means to
music, and it was probably either Philolaus or Archytas who was
responsible for changing the name of the last one to “harmonic mean.”
Among his statements in this connection was the observation that between
two whole numbers in the ratio n: (n + 1), there could be no integer
that is a geometric mean. Archytas gave more attention to music than had
his predecessors, and he felt that this subject should play a greater
role than literature in the education of children. Among his conjectures
was one that attributed differences in pitch to varying rates of motion
resulting from the flow that caused the sound. Archytas seems to have
paid considerable attention to the role of mathematics in the
curriculum, and to him has been ascribed the designation of the four
branches in the mathematical quadrivium—arithmetic (or numbers at rest),
geometry (or magnitudes at rest), music (or numbers in motion), and
astronomy (or magnitudes in motion). These subjects, together with the
trivium consisting of grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics (which Aristotle
traced back to Zeno), later constituted the seven liberal arts; hence,
the prominent role that mathematics has played in education is in no
small measure due to Archytas.</p>
<p>It is likely that Archytas had access to an earlier treatise on the
elements of mathematics, and the iterative square-root process often
known as Archytas’s had been used long before in Mesopotamia.
Nevertheless, Archytas was a contributor of original mathematical
results. The most striking contribution was a three-dimensional solution
of the Delian problem, which may be most easily described, somewhat
anachronistically, in the modern language of analytic geometry. Let a be
the edge of the cube to be doubled, and let the point (a, 0, 0) be the
center of three mutually perpendicular circles of radius a and each
lying in a plane perpendicular to a coordinate axis. Through the circle
perpendicular to the x-axis, construct a right circular cone with vertex
(0, 0, 0); through the circle in the xy-plane, pass a right circular
cylinder; and let the circle in the xz-plane be revolved about the
z-axis to generate a torus. The equations of these three surfaces are,
respectively, x2 = y2 + z2 and 2ax = x2 + y2 and (x2 + y2 + z2)2 =
4a2(x2 + y2). These three surfaces intersect in a point whose
x-coordinate is a ; hence, the length of this line segment is the edge
of the cube desired.</p>
<p>The achievement of Archytas is the more impressive when we recall
that his solution was worked out synthetically without the aid of
coordinates. Nevertheless, Archytas’s most important contribution to
mathematics may have been his intervention with the tyrant Dionysius to
save the life of his friend Plato. The latter remained to the end of his
life deeply committed to the Pythagorean veneration of number and
geometry, and the supremacy of Athens in the mathematical world of the
fourth century BCE resulted primarily from the enthusiasm of Plato, the
“maker of mathematicians.” Before taking up the role of Plato in
mathematics, however, it is necessary to discuss the work of an earlier
Pythagorean—an apostate by the name of Hippasus.</p>
<p>Hippasus of Metapontum (or Croton), roughly contemporaneous with
Philolaus, is reported to have originally been a Pythagorean but to have
been expelled from the brotherhood. One account has it that the
Pythagoreans erected a tombstone to him, as though he were dead; another
story reports that his apostasy was punished by death at sea in a
shipwreck. The exact cause of the break is unknown, in part because of
the rule of secrecy, but there are three suggested possibilities.
According to one, Hippasus was expelled for political insubordination,
having headed a democratic movement against the conservative Pythagorean
rule. A second tradition attributes the expulsion to disclosures
concerning the geometry of the pentagon or the dodecahedron—perhaps a
construction of one of the figures. A third explanation holds that the
expulsion was coupled with the disclosure of a mathematical discovery of
devastating significance for Pythagorean philosophy—the existence of
incommensurable magnitudes.</p>
<p>Incommensurability</p>
<p>It had been a fundamental tenet of Pythagoreanism that the essence of
all things, in geometry as well as in the practical and theoretical
affairs of man, is explainable in terms of arithmos, or intrinsic
properties of whole numbers or their ratios. The dialogues of Plato
show, however, that the Greek mathematical community had been stunned by
a disclosure that virtually demolished the basis for the Pythagorean
faith in whole numbers. This was the discovery that within geometry
itself, the whole numbers and their ratios are inadequate to account for
even simple fundamental properties. They do not suffice, for example, to
compare the diagonal of a square or a cube or a pentagon with its side.
The line segments are incommensurable, no matter how small a unit of
measure is chosen.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the earliest recognition of
incommensurable line segments are as uncertain as is the time of the
discovery. Ordinarily, it is assumed that the recognition came in
connection with the application of the Pythagorean theorem to the
isosceles right triangle. Aristotle referred to a proof of the
incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with respect to a side,
indicating that it was based on the distinction between odd and even.
Such a proof is easy to construct. Let d and s be the diagonal and the
side of a square, and assume that they are commensurable—that is, that
the ratio d / s is rational and equal to p / q, where p and q are
integers with no common factor. Now, from the Pythagorean theorem it is
known that d2 = s2 + s2; hence, (d / s)2 = p2 / q2 = 2, or p2 = 2q2.
Therefore, p2 must be even; hence, p must be even. Consequently, q must
be odd. Letting p = 2r and substituting in the equation p2 = 2q2, we
have 4r2 = 2q2, or q2 = 2r2. Then q2 must be even; hence, q must be
even. Yet q was previously shown to be odd, and an integer cannot be
both odd and even. It follows, therefore, by the indirect method, that
the assumption that d and s are commensurable must be false.</p>
<p>In this proof, the degree of abstraction is so high that the
possibility that it was the basis for the original discovery of
incommensurability has been questioned. There are, however, other ways
in which the discovery could have come about. Among these is the simple
observation that when the five diagonals of a regular pentagon are
drawn, these diagonals form a smaller regular pentagon (Fig. 4.10), and
the diagonals of the second pentagon in turn form a third regular
pentagon, which is still smaller. This process can be continued
indefinitely, resulting in pentagons that are as small as desired and
leading to the conclusion that the ratio of a diagonal to a side in a
regular pentagon is not rational. The irrationality of this ratio is, in
fact, a consequence of the argument presented in connection with Fig.
4.2, in which the golden section was shown to repeat itself over and
over again. Was it perhaps this property that led to the disclosure,
possibly by Hippasus, of incommensurability? There is no surviving
document to resolve the question, but the suggestion is at least a
plausible one. In this case, it would not have been but that first
disclosed the existence of incommensurable magnitudes, for the solution
of the equation a: x = x: (a − x) leads to as the ratio of the side of a
regular pentagon to a diagonal. The ratio of the diagonal of a cube to
an edge is , and here, too, the specter of the incommensurable rears its
ugly head.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.10</p>
<p>A geometric proof somewhat analogous to that for the ratio of the
diagonal of a pentagon to its side can also be provided for the ratio of
the diagonal of a square to its side. If in the square ABCD (Fig. 4.11)
one lays off on the diagonal AC the segment AP = AB and at P erects the
perpendicular PQ, the ratio of CQ to PC will be the same as the ratio of
AC to AB. Again, if on CQ one lays off QR = QP and constructs RS
perpendicular to CR, the ratio of hypotenuse to side again will be what
it was before. This process, too, can be continued indefinitely, thus
affording a proof that no unit of length, however small, can be found so
that the hypotenuse and a side will be commensurable.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.11</p>
<p>Paradoxes of Zeno</p>
<p>The Pythagorean doctrine that “Numbers constitute the entire heaven”
was now faced with a very serious problem indeed, but it was not the
only one, for the school was also confronted with arguments propounded
by the neighboring Eleatics, a rival philosophical movement. Ionian
philosophers of Asia Minor had sought to identify a first principle for
all things. Thales had thought to find this in water, but others
preferred to think of air or fire as the basic element. The Pythagoreans
had taken a more abstract direction, postulating that number in all of
its plurality was the basic stuff behind phenomena; this numerical
atomism, beautifully illustrated in the geometry of figurate numbers,
had come under attack by the followers of Parmenides of Elea (fl. ca.
450 BCE). The fundamental tenet of the Eleatics was the unity and
permanence of being, a view that contrasted with the Pythagorean ideas
of multiplicity and change. Of Parmenides’ disciples, the best known was
Zeno the Eleatic (fl. ca. 450 BCE), who propounded arguments to prove
the inconsistency in the concepts of multiplicity and divisibility. The
method Zeno adopted was dialectical, anticipating Socrates in this
indirect mode of argument: starting from his opponent’s premises, he
reduced these to an absurdity.</p>
<p>The Pythagoreans had assumed that space and time can be thought of as
consisting of points and instants, but space and time also have a
property, more easily intuited than defined, known as “continuity.” The
ultimate elements making up a plurality were assumed, on the one hand,
to have the characteristics of the geometric unit—the point—and, on the
other, to have certain characteristics of the numeric units or numbers.
Aristotle described a Pythagorean point as “unity having position” or as
“unity considered in space.” It has been suggested that it was against
such a view that Zeno propounded his paradoxes, of which those on motion
are cited most frequently. As they have come down to us, through
Aristotle and others, four of them seem to have caused the most trouble:
(1) the Dichotomy, (2) the Achilles, (3) the Arrow, and (4) the Stade.
The first argues that before a moving object can travel a given
distance, it must first travel half of this distance, but before it can
cover this, it must travel the first quarter of the distance, and before
this, the first eighth, and so on, through an infinite number of
subdivisions. The runner wishing to get started must make an infinite
number of contacts in a finite time, but it is impossible to exhaust an
infinite collection, hence the beginning of motion is impossible. The
second of the paradoxes is similar to the first, except that the
infinite subdivision is progressive, rather than regressive. Here
Achilles is racing against a tortoise that has been given a head start,
and it is argued that Achilles, no matter how swiftly he may run, can
never overtake the tortoise, no matter how slow it may be. By the time
that Achilles will have reached the initial position of the tortoise,
the latter will have advanced some short distance, and by the time that
Achilles will have covered this distance, the tortoise will have
advanced somewhat farther, and so the process continues indefinitely,
with the result that the swift Achilles can never overtake the slow
tortoise.</p>
<p>The Dichotomy and the Achilles argue that motion is impossible under
the assumption of the infinite subdivisibility of space and time; the
Arrow and the Stade, on the other hand, argue that motion is equally
impossible if one makes the opposite assumption—that the subdivisibility
of space and time terminates in indivisibles. In the Arrow, Zeno argues
that an object in flight always occupies a space equal to itself, but
that which always occupies a space equal to itself is not in motion.
Hence, the flying arrow is at rest at all times, so that its motion is
an illusion.</p>
<p>Most controversial of the paradoxes on motion and most awkward to
describe is the Stade (or Stadium), but the argument can be phrased
somewhat as follows. Let A1, A2, A3, A4 be bodies of equal size that are
stationary; let B1, B2, B3, B4 be bodies, of the same size as the A’s,
that are moving to the right so that each B passes each A in an
instant—the smallest possible interval of time. Let C1, C2, C3, C4 also
be of equal size with the A’s and B’s and let them move uniformly to the
left with respect to the A’s so that each C passes each A in an instant
of time. Let us assume that at a given time, the bodies occupy the
following relative positions:</p>
<p>Then, after the lapse of a single instant—that is, after an
indivisible subdivision of time—the positions will be as follows:</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that C1 will have passed two of the B’s; hence,
the instant cannot be the minimum time interval, for we can take as a
new and smaller unit the time it takes C1 to pass one of the B’s.</p>
<p>The arguments of Zeno seem to have had a profound influence on the
development of Greek mathematics, comparable to that of the discovery of
the incommensurable, with which they may have been related. Originally,
in Pythagorean circles, magnitudes were represented by pebbles or
calculi, from which our word “calculation” comes, but by the time of
Euclid there is a complete change in point of view. Magnitudes are not
in general associated with numbers or pebbles, but with line segments.
In the Elements, even the integers themselves are represented by
segments of lines. The realm of number continued to have the property of
discreteness, but the world of continuous magnitudes (and this includes
most of pre-Hellenic and Pythagorean mathematics) was a thing apart from
number and had to be treated through geometric method. It seemed to be
geometry, rather than number, that ruled the world. This was perhaps the
most far-reaching conclusion of the Heroic Age, and it is not unlikely
that this was due in large measure to Zeno of Elea and Hippasus of
Metapontum.</p>
<p>Deductive Reasoning</p>
<p>There are several conjectures as to the causes leading to the
conversion of the mathematical prescriptions of pre-Hellenic peoples
into the deductive structure that appears in Greece. Some have suggested
that Thales in his travels had noted discrepancies in pre-Hellenic
mathematics—such as the Egyptian and Babylonian rules for the area of a
circle—and that he and his early successors therefore saw the need for a
strict rational method. Others, more conservative, would place the
deductive form much later—perhaps even as late as the early fourth
century, following the discovery of the incommensurable. Other
suggestions find the cause outside mathematics. One, for example is that
deduction may have come out of logic, in attempts to convince an
opponent of a conclusion by looking for premises from which the
conclusion necessarily follows.</p>
<p>Whether deduction came into mathematics in the sixth century BCE or
the fourth and whether incommensurability was discovered before or after
400 BCE, there can be no doubt that Greek mathematics had undergone
drastic changes by the time of Plato. The dichotomy between number and
continuous magnitude required a new approach to the Babylonian algebra
that the Pythagoreans had inherited. The old problems in which, given
the sum and the product of the sides of a rectangle, the dimensions were
required had to be dealt with differently from the numerical algorithms
of the Babylonians. A “geometric algebra” had to take the place of the
older “arithmetic algebra,” and in this new algebra there could be no
adding of lines to areas or adding of areas to volumes. From now on,
there had to be a strict homogeneity of terms in equations, and the
Mesopotamian normal forms, xy = A, x ± y = b, were to be interpreted
geometrically. The obvious conclusion, which the reader can arrive at by
eliminating y, is that one must construct on a given line b a rectangle
whose unknown width x must be such that the area of the rectangle
exceeds the given area A by the square x2 or (in the case of the minus
sign) falls short of the area A by the square x2 (Fig. 4.12). In this
way, the Greeks built up the solution of quadratic equations by their
process known as “the application of areas,” a portion of geometric
algebra that is fully covered by Euclid’s Elements. Moreover, the
uneasiness resulting from incommensurable magnitudes led to an avoidance
of ratios, insofar as possible, in elementary mathematics. The linear
equation ax = bc, for example, was looked on as an equality of the areas
ax and bc, rather than as a proportion—an equality between the two
ratios a: b and c: x. Consequently, in constructing the fourth
proportion, x in this case, it was usual to construct a rectangle OCDB
with sides b = OB and c = OC (Fig. 4.13) and then along OC to lay off OA
= a. One completes rectangle OAEB and draws the diagonal OE cutting CD
at P. It is now clear that CP is the desired line x, for rectangle OARS
is equal in area to rectangle OCDB. Not until Book V of the Elements did
Euclid take up the difficult matter of proportionality.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.12</p>
<p>FIG. 4.13</p>
<p>Greek geometric algebra strikes the modern reader as excessively
artificial and difficult; to those who used it and became adept at
handling its operations, however, it probably appeared to be a
convenient tool. The distributive law a(b + c + d) = ab + ac + ad
undoubtedly was far more obvious to a Greek scholar than to the
beginning student of algebra today, for the former could easily picture
the areas of the rectangles in this theorem, which simply says that the
rectangle on a and the sum of segments b, c, d is equal to the sum of
the rectangles on a and each of the lines b, c, d taken separately (Fig.
4.14). Again, the identity (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 becomes obvious from
a diagram that shows the three squares and the two equal rectangles in
the identity (Fig. 4.15); and a difference of two squares a2 − b2 = (a +
b)(a − b) can be pictured in a similar fashion (Fig. 4.16). Sums,
differences, products, and quotients of line segments can easily be
constructed with a straightedge and a compass. Square roots also afford
no difficulty in geometric algebra. If one wishes to find a line x such
that x2 = ab, one simply follows the procedure found in elementary
geometry textbooks today. One lays off on a straight line the segment
ABC, where AB = a and BC = b (Fig. 4.17). With AC as the diameter, one
constructs a semicircle (with center O) and at B erects the
perpendicular BP, which is the segment x desired. It is interesting that
here, too, the proof as given by Euclid, probably following the earlier
avoidance of ratios, makes use of areas rather than proportions. If in
our figure we let PO = AO = CO = r and BO = s, Euclid would say
essentially that x2 = r2 − s2 = (r − s)(r + s) = ab.</p>

<p>Democritus of Abdera</p>
<p>The Heroic Age in mathematics produced half a dozen great figures,
and among them must be included a man who is better known as a chemical
philosopher. Democritus of Abdera (ca. 460–370 BCE) is today celebrated
as a proponent of a materialistic atomic doctrine, but in his time he
had also acquired a reputation as a geometer. He is reported to have
traveled more widely than anyone of his day—to Athens, Egypt,
Mesopotamia, and possibly India—acquiring what learning he could, but
his own achievements in mathematics were such that he boasted that not
even the “rope-stretchers” in Egypt excelled him. He wrote a number of
mathematical works, not one of which is extant today.</p>
<p>The key to the mathematics of Democritus is to be found in his
physical doctrine of atomism. All phenomena were to be explained, he
argued, in terms of indefinitely small and infinitely varied (in size
and shape), impenetrably hard atoms moving about ceaselessly in empty
space. The physical atomism of Leucippus and Democritus may have been
suggested by the geometric atomism of the Pythagoreans, and it is not
surprising that the mathematical problems with which Democritus was
chiefly concerned were those that demand some sort of infinitesimal
approach. The Egyptians, for example, were aware that the volume of a
pyramid is one-third the product of the base and the altitude, but a
proof of this fact almost certainly was beyond their capabilities, for
it requires a point of view equivalent to the calculus. Archimedes later
wrote that this result was due to Democritus but that the latter did not
prove it rigorously. This creates a puzzle, for if Democritus added
anything to the Egyptian knowledge here, it must have been some sort of
demonstration, albeit inadequate. Perhaps Democritus showed that a
triangular prism can be divided into three triangular pyramids that are
equal in height and area of the base and then deduced, from the
assumption that pyramids of the same height and equal bases are equal,
the familiar Egyptian theorem.</p>
<p>This assumption can be justified only by the application of
infinitesimal techniques. If, for example, one thinks of two pyramids of
equal bases and the same height as composed of indefinitely many
infinitely thin equal cross-sections in one-to-one correspondence (a
device usually known as Cavalieri’s principle, in deference to the
seventeenth-century geometer), the assumption appears to be justified.
Such a fuzzy geometric atomism might have been at the base of
Democritus’s thought, although this has not been established. In any
case, following the paradoxes of Zeno and the awareness of
incommensurables, such arguments based on an infinity of infinitesimals
were not acceptable. Archimedes consequently could well hold that
Democritus had not given a rigorous proof. The same judgment would be
true with respect to the theorem, also attributed by Archimedes to
Democritus, that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of the
circumscribing cylinder. This result was probably looked on by
Democritus as a corollary to the theorem on the pyramid, for the cone is
essentially a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon of infinitely many
sides.</p>
<p>Democritean geometric atomism was immediately confronted with certain
problems. If the pyramid or the cone, for example, is made up of
indefinitely many infinitely thin triangular or circular sections
parallel to the base, a consideration of any two adjacent laminae
creates a paradox. If the adjacent sections are equal in area, then,
because all sections are equal, the totality will be a prism or a
cylinder and not a pyramid or a cone. If, on the other hand, adjacent
sections are unequal, the totality will be a step pyramid or a step cone
and not the smooth-surfaced figure one has in mind. This problem is not
unlike the difficulties with the incommensurable and with the paradoxes
of motion. Perhaps, in his On the Irrational, Democritus analyzed the
difficulties here encountered, but there is no way of knowing what
direction his attempts may have taken. His extreme unpopularity in the
two dominant philosophical schools of the next century, those of Plato
and Aristotle, may have encouraged the disregard of Democritean ideas.
Nevertheless, the chief mathematical legacy of the Heroic Age can be
summed up in six problems: the squaring of the circle, the duplication
of the cube, the trisection of the angle, the ratio of incommensurable
magnitudes, the paradoxes on motion, and the validity of infinitesimal
methods. To some extent, these can be associated, although not
exclusively, with men considered in this chapter: Hippocrates, Archytas,
Hippias, Hippasus, Zeno, and Democritus. Other ages were to produce a
comparable array of talent, but perhaps never again was any age to make
so bold an attack on so many fundamental mathematical problems with such
inadequate methodological resources. It is for this reason that we have
called the period from Anaxagoras to Archytas the Heroic Age.</p>
<p>Mathematics and the Liberal Arts</p>
<p>We included Archytas among the mathematicians of the Heroic Age, but
in a sense he really is a transition figure in mathematics during
Plato’s time. Archytas was among the last of the Pythagoreans, both
literally and figuratively. He could still believe that number was
all-important in life and in mathematics, but the wave of the future was
to elevate geometry to the ascendancy, largely because of the problem of
incommensurability. On the other hand, Archytas is reported to have
established the quadrivium—arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy—as
the core of a liberal education, and here his views were to dominate
much of pedagogical thought to our day. The seven liberal arts, which
remained a shibboleth for almost two millennia, were made up of
Archytas’s quadrivium and the trivium of grammar, rhetoric, and Zeno’s
dialectic. Consequently, one may with some justice hold that the
mathematicians of the Heroic Age were responsible for much of the
direction in Western educational traditions, especially as transmitted
through the philosophers of the fourth century BCE.</p>
<p>The Academy</p>
<p>The fourth century BCE had opened with the death of Socrates, a
scholar who adopted the dialectic method of Zeno and repudiated the
Pythagoreanism of Archytas. Socrates admitted that in his youth, he had
been attracted by such questions as why the sum 2 + 2 was the same as
the product 2 × 2, as well as by the natural philosophy of Anaxagoras,
but on realizing that neither mathematics nor science could satisfy his
desire to know the essence of things, he gave himself up to his
characteristic search for the good.</p>
<p>In the Phaedo of Plato, the dialogue in which the last hours of
Socrates are so beautifully described, we see how deep metaphysical
doubts precluded a Socratic concern with either mathematics or natural
science:</p>
<p>I cannot satisfy myself that, when one is added to one, the one to
which the addition is made becomes two, or that the two units added
together make two by reason of the addition. I cannot understand how
when separated from the other, each of them was one and not two, and
now, when they are brought together, the mere juxtaposition or meeting
of them should be the cause of their becoming two.</p>
<p>Hence, the influence of Socrates in the development of mathematics
was negligible, if not actually negative. This makes it all the more
surprising that it was his student and admirer Plato who became the
mathematical inspiration of the fourth century BC.</p>
<p>Although Plato himself made no specific outstanding contribution to
technical mathematical results, he was the center of the mathematical
activity of the time and guided and inspired its development. Over the
doors of his school, the Academy in Athens, was inscribed the motto “Let
no one ignorant of geometry enter here.” His enthusiasm for the subject
led him to become known not as a mathematician, but as “the maker of
mathematicians.”</p>
<p>The men whose work we shall describe (in addition to that of Plato
and Aristotle) lived between the death of Socrates in 399 BCE and the
death of Aristotle in 322 BCE. They are Theodorus of Cyrene (fl. ca. 390
BCE), Theaetetus (ca. 414–369 BCE), Eudoxus of Cnidus (d. ca. 355 BCE),
Menaechmus (fl. ca. 350 BCE) and his brother Dinostratus (fl. ca. 350
BCE), and Autolycus of Pitane (fl. ca. 330 BCE).</p>
<p>These six mathematicians were not scattered throughout the Greek
world, as had been those in the fifth century BCE; they were associated
more or less closely with the Academy. It is clear that Plato’s high
regard for mathematics did not come from Socrates; in fact, the earlier
Platonic dialogues seldom refer to mathematics. The one who converted
Plato to a mathematical outlook was undoubtedly Archytas, a friend whom
he visited in Sicily in 388 BCE. Perhaps it was there that Plato learned
of the five regular solids, which were associated with the four elements
of Empedocles in a cosmic scheme that fascinated men for centuries.
Possibly, it was the Pythagorean regard for the dodecahedron that led
Plato to look on this, the fifth and last, regular solid as a symbol of
the universe. Plato put his ideas on the regular solids into a dialogue
titled the Timaeus, presumably named for a Pythagorean who serves as the
chief interlocutor. It is not known whether Timaeus of Locri really
existed or whether Plato invented him as a character through whom to
express the Pythagorean views that still were strong in what is now
southern Italy. The regular polyhedra have often been called “cosmic
bodies” or “Platonic solids” because of the way in which Plato in the
Timaeus applied them to the explanation of scientific phenomena.
Although this dialogue, probably written when Plato was near seventy,
provides the earliest definite evidence for the association of the four
elements with the regular solids, much of this fantasy may be due to the
Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>Proclus attributes the construction of the cosmic figures to
Pythagoras, but the scholiast Suidas reported that Plato’s friend
Theaetetus (ca. 414 BCE–369 BCE) and the son of one of the richest
patricians in Attica first wrote on them. A scholium (of uncertain date)
to Book XIII of Euclid’s Elements reports that only three of the five
solids were due to the Pythagoreans, and that it was through Theaetetus
that the octahedron and the icosahedron became known. It seems likely
that in any case, Theaetetus made one of the most extensive studies of
the five regular solids, and to him probably is due the theorem that
there are five and only five regular polyhedra. Perhaps he is also
responsible for the calculations in the Elements of the ratios of the
edges of the regular solids to the radius of the circumscribed
sphere.</p>
<p>Theaetetus was a young Athenian who died from a combination of
dysentery and wounds received in battle, and the Platonic dialogue
bearing his name was a commemorative tribute by Plato to his friend. In
the dialogue, purporting to take place some thirty years earlier,
Theaetetus discusses with Socrates and Theodorus the nature of
incommensurable magnitudes. It has been assumed that this discussion
somewhat took the form that we find in the opening of Book X of the
Elements. Here distinctions are made not only between commensurable and
incommensurable magnitudes, but also between those that while
incommensurable in length are, or are not, commensurable in square.
Surds such as and are incommensurable in length, but they are
commensurable in square, for their squares have the ratio 3 to 5. The
magnitudes and , on the other hand, are incommensurable both in length
and in square.</p>
<p>The dialogue that Plato composed in memory of his friend Theaetetus
contains information on another mathematician whom Plato admired and who
contributed to the early development of the theory of incommensurable
magnitudes. Reporting on the then recent discovery of what we call the
irrationality of , Plato in the Theaetetus says that his teacher,
Theodorus of Cyrene—of whom Theaetetus was also a pupil—was the first to
prove the irrationality of the square roots of the nonsquare integers
from 3 to 17 inclusive. It is not known how he did this or why he
stopped with . The proof, in any case, would have been constructed along
the lines of that for as given by Aristotle and interpolated in later
versions of Book X of the Elements. References in ancient historical
works indicate that Theodorus made discoveries in elementary geometry
that later were incorporated into Euclid’s Elements, but the works of
Theodorus are lost.</p>
<p>Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role
as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp
distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the
theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato
regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of
war, who “must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array
his troops.” The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an
arithmetician “because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay
hold of true being.” Moreover, Plato says in the Republic, “Arithmetic
has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the mind to reason
about abstract number.” So elevating are Plato’s thoughts concerning
numbers that they reach the realm of mysticism and apparent fantasy. In
the last book of the Republic, he refers to a number that he calls “the
lord of better and worse births.” There has been much speculation
concerning this “Platonic number,” and one theory is that it is the
number 604 = 12,960,000—important in Babylonian numerology and possibly
transmitted to Plato through the Pythagoreans. In the Laws, the number
of citizens in the ideal state is given as 5040 (that is, 7 · 6 · 5 · 4
· 3 · 2 · 1). This is sometimes referred to as the Platonic nuptial
number, and various theories have been advanced to suggest what Plato
had in mind.</p>
<p>As in arithmetic, where Plato saw a gulf separating the theoretical
and the computational aspects, so also in geometry he espoused the cause
of pure mathematics as against the materialistic views of the artisan or
the technician. Plutarch, in his Life of Marcellus, speaks of Plato’s
indignation at the use of mechanical contrivances in geometry.
Apparently, Plato regarded such use as “the mere corruption and
annihilation of the one good of geometry, which was thus shamefully
turning its back upon the unembodied objects of pure intelligence.”
Plato may consequently have been largely responsible for the prevalent
restriction in Greek geometric constructions to those that can be
effected by straightedge and compasses alone. The reason for the
limitation is not likely to have been the simplicity of the instruments
used in constructing lines and circles, but rather the symmetry of the
configurations. Any one of the infinitely many diameters of a circle is
a line of symmetry of the figure; any point on an infinitely extended
straight line can be thought of as a center of symmetry, just as any
line perpendicular to the given line is a line with respect to which the
given line is symmetric. Platonic philosophy, with its apotheosization
of ideas, would quite naturally find a favored role for the line and the
circle among geometric figures. In a somewhat similar manner, Plato
glorified the triangle. The faces of the five regular solids in Plato’s
view were not simple triangles, squares, and pentagons. Each of the four
faces of the tetrahedron, for example, is made up of six smaller right
triangles, formed by altitudes of the equilateral triangular faces. The
regular tetrahedron he therefore thought of as made up of twenty-four
scalene right triangles in which the hypotenuse is double one side; the
regular octahedron contains 8 × 6 or 48 such triangles, and the
icosahedron is made up of 20 × 6 or 120 triangles. In a similar way the
hexahedron (or cube) is constructed of twenty-four isosceles right
triangles, for each of the six square faces contains four right
triangles when the diagonals of the squares are drawn.</p>
<p>To the dodecahedron, Plato had assigned a special role as
representative of the universe, cryptically saying that “God used it for
the whole” (Timaeus 55C). Plato looked on the dodecahedron as composed
of 360 scalene right triangles, for when the five diagonals and the five
medians are drawn in each of the pentagonal faces, each of the twelve
faces will contain thirty right triangles. The association of the first
four regular solids with the traditional four universal elements
provided Plato in the Timaeus with a beautifully unified theory of
matter, according to which everything was constructed of ideal right
triangles. The whole of physiology, as well as the sciences of inert
matter, is based in the Timaeus on these triangles.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is reputed to have established mathematics as a liberal
subject, but Plato was influential in making the subject an essential
part of the curriculum for the education of statesmen. Influenced
perhaps by Archytas, Plato would add to the original subjects in the
quadrivium a new subject, stereometry, for he believed that solid
geometry had not been sufficiently emphasized. Plato also discussed the
foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions, and
reorganized the assumptions. He emphasized that the reasoning used in
geometry does not refer to the visible figures that are drawn but to the
absolute ideas that they represent. The Pythagoreans had defined a point
as “unity having position,” but Plato would rather think of it as the
beginning of a line. The definition of a line as “breadthless length”
seems to have originated in the school of Plato, as well as the idea
that a line “lies evenly with the points on it.” In arithmetic, Plato
emphasized not only the distinction between odd and even numbers, but
also the categories “even times even,” “odd times even,” and “odd times
odd.” Although we are told that Plato added to the axioms of
mathematics, we do not have an account of his premises.</p>
<p>Few specific mathematical contributions are attributed to Plato. A
formula for Pythagorean triples—(2n)2 + (n2 − 1)2 = (n2 + 1)2, where n
is any natural number—bears Plato’s name, but this is merely a slightly
modified version of a result known to the Babylonians and the
Pythagoreans. Perhaps more genuinely significant is the ascription to
Plato of the so-called analytic method. In demonstrative mathematics one
begins with what is given, either generally in the axioms and the
postulates or more specifically in the problems at hand. Proceeding step
by step, one then arrives at the statement that was to have been proved.
Plato seems to have pointed out that often it is pedagogically
convenient, when a chain of reasoning from premises to conclusion is not
obvious, to reverse the process. One might begin with the proposition
that is to be proved and from it deduce a conclusion that is known to
hold. If, then, one can reverse the steps in this chain of reasoning,
the result is a legitimate proof of the proposition. It is unlikely that
Plato was the first to note the efficacy in the analytic point of view,
for any preliminary investigation of a problem is tantamount to this.
What Plato is likely to have done is to formalize this procedure or
perhaps to give it a name.</p>
<p>The role of Plato in the history of mathematics is still bitterly
disputed. Some regard him as an exceptionally profound and incisive
thinker; others picture him as a mathematical pied piper who lured men
away from problems that concerned the world’s work and who encouraged
idle speculation. In any case, few would deny that Plato had a
tremendous effect on the development of mathematics. The Platonic
Academy in Athens became the mathematical center of the world, and it
was from this school that the leading teachers and research workers came
during the middle of the fourth century. Of these, the greatest was
Eudoxus of Cnidus (408?–335? BCE), a man who was at one time a pupil of
Plato and who became the most renowned mathematician and astronomer of
his day.</p>
<p>Eudoxus</p>
<p>We sometimes read of the “Platonic reform” in mathematics, and
although the phrase tends to exaggerate the changes taking place, the
work of Eudoxus was so significant that the word “reform” is not
inappropriate. In Plato’s youth, the discovery of the incommensurable
had caused a veritable logical scandal, for it had raised havoc with
theorems involving proportions. Two quantities, such as the diagonal and
the side of a square, are incommensurable when they do not have a ratio
such as a (whole) number has to a (whole) number. How, then, is one to
compare ratios of incommensurable magnitudes? If Hippocrates really did
prove that the areas of circles are to each other as squares on their
diameters, he must have had some way of handling proportions or the
equality of ratios. We do not know how he proceeded or whether to some
extent he anticipated Eudoxus, who gave a new and generally accepted
definition of equal ratios. Apparently, the Greeks had made use of the
idea that four quantities are in proportion, a: b = c: d, if the two
ratios a: b and c: d have the same mutual subtraction. That is, the
smaller in each ratio can be laid off on the larger the same integral
number of times, and the remainder in each case can be laid off on the
smaller the same integral number of times, and the new remainder can be
laid off on the former remainder the same integral number of times, and
so on. Such a definition would be awkward to use, and it was a brilliant
achievement of Eudoxus to discover the theory of proportion used in Book
V of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>The word “ratio” essentially denoted an undefined concept in Greek
mathematics, for Euclid’s “definition” of ratio as a kind of relation in
size between two magnitudes of the same type is quite inadequate. More
significant is Euclid’s statement that magnitudes are said to have a
ratio to one another if a multiple of either can be found to exceed the
other. This is essentially a statement of the so-called axiom of
Archimedes—a property that Archimedes himself attributed to Eudoxus. The
Eudoxian concept of ratio consequently excludes zero and clarifies what
is meant by magnitudes of the same kind. A line segment, for example, is
not to be compared, in terms of ratio, with an area; nor is an area to
be compared with a volume.</p>
<p>Following these preliminary remarks on ratios, Euclid gives in
Definition 5 of Book V the celebrated formulation by Eudoxus:</p>
<p>Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second
and the third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples whatever be
taken of the first and the third, and any equimultiples whatever of the
second and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike
equal to, or are alike less than, the latter equimultiples taken in
corresponding order (Heath 1981, vol. 2, p. 114).</p>
<p>That is, a / b = c / d if and only if given integers m and n,
whenever ma &lt; nb, then mc &lt; nd, or if ma = nb, then mc = nd, or if
ma &gt; nb, then mc &gt; nd.</p>
<p>The Eudoxian definition of equality of ratios is not unlike the
process of cross-multiplication that is used today for fractions—a / b =
c / d according as ad = bc—a process equivalent to a reduction to a
common denominator. To show that is equal to , for example, we multiply
3 and 6 by 4, to obtain 12 and 24, and we multiply 4 and 8 by 3,
obtaining the same pair of numbers 12 and 24. We could have used 7 and
13 as our two multipliers, obtaining the pair 21 and 42 in the first
case and 52 and 104 in the second, and as 21 is less than 52, so is 42
less than 104. (We have here interchanged the second and third terms in
Eudoxus’s definition to conform to the common operations as usually used
today, but similar relationships hold in either case.) Our arithmetical
example does not do justice to the subtlety and efficacy of Eudoxus’s
thought, for the application here appears to be trivial. To gain a
heightened appreciation of his definition, it would be well to replace
a, b, c, d by surds or, better still, to let a and b be spheres and c
and d cubes on the radii of the spheres. Here a cross-multiplication
becomes meaningless, and the applicability of Eudoxus’s definition is
far from obvious. In fact, it will be noted that strictly speaking, the
definition is not far removed from the nineteenth-century definitions of
real number, for it separates the class of rational numbers m / n into
two categories, according as ma≤nb or ma &gt; nb. Because there are
infinitely many rational numbers, the Greeks by implication were faced
with the concept they wished to avoid—that of an infinite set—but at
least it was now possible to give satisfactory proofs of theorems that
involved proportions.</p>
<p>Method of Exhaustion</p>
<p>A crisis resulting from the incommensurable had been successfully
met, thanks to the imagination of Eudoxus, but there remained another
unsolved problem—the comparison of curved and straight-line
configurations. Here, too, it seems to have been Eudoxus who supplied
the key. Earlier mathematicians apparently suggested that one try
inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures in and about the
curved figure and continue to multiply indefinitely the number of sides,
but they did not know how to clinch the argument, for the concept of a
limit was unknown at the time. According to Archimedes, it was Eudoxus
who provided the lemma that now bears Archimedes’ name—sometimes known
as the axiom of continuity—which served as the basis for the method of
exhaustion, the Greek equivalent of the integral calculus. The lemma or
axiom states that given two magnitudes having a ratio (that is, neither
being zero), one can find a multiple of either one that will exceed the
other. This statement excluded a fuzzy argument about indivisible line
segments, or fixed infinitesimals, that was sometimes maintained in
Greek thought. It also excluded the comparison of the so-called angle of
contingency or “horn angle” (formed by a curve C and its tangent T at a
point P on C) with ordinary rectilinear angles. The horn angle seemed to
be a magnitude different from zero, yet it does not satisfy the axiom of
Eudoxus with respect to the measures of rectilinear angles.</p>
<p>From the axiom of Eudoxus (or Archimedes) it is an easy step, by a
reductio ad absurdum, to prove a proposition that formed the basis of
the Greek method of exhaustion:</p>
<p>If from any magnitude there be subtracted a part not less than its
half, and if from the remainder one again subtracts not less than its
half, and if this process of subtraction is continued, ultimately there
will remain a magnitude less than any preassigned magnitude of the same
kind.</p>
<p>This proposition, which we shall refer to as the “exhaustion
property,” is equivalent to Euclid X.1 and to the modern statement that
if M is a given magnitude, ε is a preassigned magnitude of the same
kind, and r is a ratio such that , then we can find a positive integer N
such that M(1 − r)n &lt; ε for all positive integers n &gt; N. That is,
the exhaustion property is equivalent to the modern statement that .
Moreover, the Greeks made use of this property to prove theorems about
the areas and the volumes of curvilinear figures. In particular,
Archimedes ascribed to Eudoxus the earliest satisfactory proof that the
volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the cylinder having the
same base and altitude, a statement that would seem to indicate that the
method of exhaustion was derived by Eudoxus. If so, then it is to
Eudoxus (rather than to Hippocrates) that we probably owe the Euclidean
proofs of theorems concerning areas of circles and volumes of spheres.
Facile earlier suggestions had been made that the area of a circle could
be exhausted by inscribing in it a regular polygon and then increasing
the number of sides indefinitely, but the Eudoxian method of exhaustion
first made such a procedure rigorous. (It should be noted that the
phrase “method of exhaustion” was not used by the ancient Greeks, being
a modern invention, but the phrase has become so well established in the
history of mathematics that we shall continue to make use of it.) As an
illustration of the way in which Eudoxus probably carried out the
method, we give here, in somewhat modernized notation, the proof that
areas of circles are to each other as squares on their diameters. The
proof, as it is given in Euclid, Elements XII.2, is probably that of
Eudoxus.</p>
<p>Let the circles be c and C, with diameters d and D and areas a and A.
It is to be proved that a / A = d2 / D2. The proof is complete if we
proceed indirectly and disprove the only other possibilities, namely, a
/ A &lt; d2 / D2 and a / A &gt; d2 / D2. Hence, we first assume that a /
A &gt; d2 / D2. Then, there is a magnitude a′ &lt; a such that a′/A = d2
/ D2. Let a − a′ be a preassigned magnitude ε &gt; 0. Within the circles
c and C inscribe regular polygons of areas pn and Pn, having the same
number of sides n, and consider the intermediate areas outside the
polygons but inside the circles (Fig. 4.18). If the number of sides
should be doubled, it is obvious that from these intermediate areas, we
would be subtracting more than the half. Consequently, by the exhaustion
property, the intermediate areas can be reduced through successive
doubling of the number of sides (i.e., by letting n increase) until a −
pn &lt; ε. Then, because a − a′ = ε, we have pn &gt; a′. Now, from
earlier theorems it is known that pn / Pn = d2 / D2 and because it was
assumed that a′/A = d2 / D2, we have pn / Pn = a′/A. Hence, if pn &gt;
a′, as we have shown, we must conclude that Pn &gt; A. Inasmuch as Pn is
the area of a polygon inscribed within the circle of area A, it is
obvious that Pn cannot be greater than A. Because a false conclusion
implies a false premise, we have disproved the possibility that a / A
&gt; d2 / D2. In an analogous manner, we can disprove the possibility
that a / A &lt; d2 / D2, thereby establishing the theorem that areas of
circles are to each other as squares on their diameters.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.18</p>
<p>Mathematical Astronomy</p>
<p>The property that we have just demonstrated appears to have been the
first precise theorem concerning the magnitudes of curvilinear figures;
it marks Eudoxus as the apparent anticipator of the integral calculus,
the greatest contribution to mathematics made by associates of the
Platonic Academy. Eudoxus, moreover, was by no means only a
mathematician; in the history of science, he is known as the father of
scientific astronomy. Plato is said to have proposed to his associates
that they attempt to give a geometric representation of the movements of
the sun, the moon, and the five known planets. It evidently was tacitly
assumed that the movements were to be compounded of uniform circular
motions. Despite such a restriction, Eudoxus was able to give for each
of the seven heavenly bodies a satisfactory representation through a
composite of concentric spheres with centers at the earth and with
varying radii, each sphere revolving uniformly about an axis fixed with
respect to the surface of the next larger sphere. For each planet, then,
Eudoxus gave a system known to his successors as “homocentric spheres”;
these geometric schemes were combined by Aristotle into the well-known
Peripatetic cosmology of crystalline spheres that dominated thought for
almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Eudoxus was without doubt the most capable mathematician of the
Hellenic Age, but all of his works have been lost. In his astronomical
scheme, Eudoxus had seen that by a combination of circular motions, he
could describe the motions of the planets in looped orbits along a curve
known as the hippopede, or horse fetter. This curve, resembling a figure
eight on a sphere, is obtained as the intersection of a sphere and a
cylinder tangent internally to the sphere—one of the few new curves that
the Greeks recognized. At the time, there were only two means of
defining curves: (1) through combinations of uniform motions and (2) as
the intersections of familiar geometric surfaces. The hippopede of
Eudoxus is a good example of a curve that is derivable in either of
these two ways. Proclus, who wrote some 800 years after the time of
Eudoxus, reported that Eudoxus had added many general theorems in
geometry and had applied the Platonic method of analysis to the study of
the section (probably the golden section), but Eudoxus’s two chief
claims to fame remain the theory of proportions and the method of
exhaustion.</p>
<p>Menaechmus</p>
<p>Eudoxus is to be remembered in the history of mathematics not only
for his own work but also through that of his pupils. In Greece, there
was a strong thread of continuity of tradition from teacher to student.
Thus, Plato learned from Archytas, Theodorus, and Theaetetus; the
Platonic influence in turn was passed on through Eudoxus to the brothers
Menaechmus and Dinostratus, both of whom achieved eminence in
mathematics. We saw that Hippocrates of Chios had shown that the
duplication of the cube could be achieved provided that one could find
and was permitted to use curves with the properties expressed in the
continued proportion a / x = x / y = y/2a; we also noted that the Greeks
had only two approaches to the discovery of new curves. It was
consequently a signal achievement on the part of Menaechmus when he
disclosed that curves having the desired property were near at hand. In
fact, there was a family of appropriate curves obtainable from a single
source—the cutting of a right circular cone by a plane perpendicular to
an element of the cone. That is, Menaechmus is reputed to have
discovered the curves that were later known as the ellipse, the
parabola, and the hyperbola.</p>
<p>Of all of the curves, other than circles and straight lines, that are
apparent to the eye in everyday experience, the ellipse should be the
most obvious, for it is present by implication whenever a circle is
viewed obliquely or whenever one saws diagonally through a cylindrical
log. Yet the first discovery of the ellipse seems to have been made by
Menaechmus as a mere by-product in a search in which it was the parabola
and the hyperbola that proffered the properties needed in the solution
of the Delian problem.</p>
<p>Beginning with a single-napped right circular cone having a right
angle at the vertex (that is, a generating angle of 45°), Menaechmus
found that when the cone is cut by a plane perpendicular to an element,
the curve of intersection is such that in terms of modern analytic
geometry, its equation can be written in the form y2 = lx, where l is a
constant, depending on the distance of the cutting plane from the
vertex. We do not know how Menaechmus derived this property, but it
depends only on theorems from elementary geometry. Let the cone be ABC
and let it be cut in the curve EDG by a plane perpendicular to the
element ADC of the cone (Fig. 4.19). Then, through P, any point on the
curve, pass a horizontal plane cutting the cone in the circle PVR, and
let Q be the other point of intersection of the curve (parabola) and the
circle. From the symmetries involved, it follows that line PQ ⊥ RV at O.
Hence, OP is the mean proportional between RO and OV. Moreover, from the
similarity of triangles OVD and BCA it follows that OV / DO = BC / AB,
and from the similarity of triangles R′DA and ABC it follows that R′D /
AR′ = BC / AB. If OP = y and OD = x are coordinates of point P, we have
y2 = RO · OV, or, on substituting equals,</p>
<p>FIG. 4.19</p>
<p>Inasmuch as segments AR′, BC, and AB are the same for all points P on
the curve EQDPG, we can write the equation of the curve, a “section of a
right-angled cone,” as y2 = lx, where l is a constant, later to be known
as the latus rectum of the curve. In an analogous way, we can derive an
equation of the form y2 = lx − b2x2 / a2 for a “section of an
acute-angled cone” and an equation of the form y2 = lx + b2x2 / a2 for a
“section of an obtuse-angled cone,” where a and b are constants and the
cutting plane is perpendicular to an element of the acute-angled or
obtuse-angled right circular cone.</p>
<p>Duplication of the Cube</p>
<p>Menaechmus had no way of foreseeing the hosts of beautiful properties
that the future would disclose. He had hit on the conics in a successful
search for curves with the properties appropriate to the duplication of
the cube. In terms of modern notation, the solution is easily achieved.
By shifting the cutting plane (Fig. 4.19), we can find a parabola with
any latus rectum. If we wish to duplicate a cube of edge a, we locate on
a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum a and another
with latus rectum 2a. If, then, we place these with vertices at the
origin and with axes along the y- and x-axes, respectively, the point of
intersection of the two curves will have coordinates (x, y) satisfying
the continued proportion a / x = x / y = y/2a (Fig. 4.20); that is, .
The x-coordinate, therefore, is the edge of the cube sought.</p>
<p>FIG. 4.20</p>
<p>It is probable that Menaechmus knew that the duplication could also
be achieved by the use of a rectangular hyperbola and a parabola. If the
parabola with equation y2 = (a/2)x and the hyperbola xy = a2 are placed
on a common coordinate system, the point of intersection will have
coordinates the x-coordinate being the side of the cube desired.
Menaechmus was probably acquainted with many of the now-familiar
properties of the conic sections, including the asymptotes of the
hyperbola, which would have permitted him to operate with the
equivalents of the modern equations that we used earlier. Proclus
reported that Menaechmus was one of those who “made the whole of
geometry more perfect,” but we know little about his actual work. We do
know that Menaechmus taught Alexander the Great, and legend attributes
to Menaechmus the celebrated comment, when his royal pupil asked for a
shortcut to geometry: “O King, for traveling over the country there are
royal roads and roads for common citizens; but in geometry there is one
road for all.” Among the chief authorities for attributing to Menaechmus
the discovery of conic sections is a letter from Eratosthenes to King
Ptolemy Euergetes, quoted some 700 years later by Eutocius, in which
several duplications of the cube are mentioned. Among them is one by
Archytas’s unwieldy construction and another by “cutting the cone in the
triads of Menaechmus.”</p>
<p>Dinostratus and the Squaring of the Circle</p>
<p>Dinostratus, a brother of Menaechmus, was also a mathematician; one
of the brothers “solved” the duplication of the cube, the other “solved”
the squaring of the circle. The quadrature became a simple matter once a
striking property of the end point Q of the trisectrix of Hippias had
been noted, apparently by Dinostratus. If the equation of the trisectrix
(Fig. 4.21) is πr sin θ = 2aθ, where a is the side of the square ABCD
associated with the curve, the limiting value of r as θ tends toward
zero is 2a/π. This is obvious to one who has had calculus and recalls
that for radian measure. The proof, as given by Pappus and probably due
to Dinostratus, is based only on considerations from elementary
geometry. The theorem of Dinostratus states that side a is the mean
proportional between the segment DQ and the arc of the quarter circle
AC; that is, . Using a typically Greek indirect proof, we establish the
theorem by demolishing the alternatives. Hence, assume first that where
DR &gt; DQ. Then, let the circle with center D and radius DR intersect
the trisectrix at S and side AD of the square at T. From S drop the
perpendicular SU to side CD. Inasmuch as it was known to Dinostratus
that corresponding arcs of circles are to each other as the radii, we
have , and because by hypothesis , it follows that . But from the
definitional property of the trisectrix it is known that . Hence,
because , it must follow that , which obviously is false, because the
perpendicular is shorter than any other line or curve from point S to
line DC. Hence, the fourth term DR in the proportion cannot be greater
than DQ. In a similar manner, we can prove that this fourth proportional
cannot be less than DQ; hence, Dinostratus’s theorem is established—that
is, .</p>
<p>FIG. 4.21</p>
<p>Given the intersection point Q of the trisectrix with DC, we then
have a proportion involving three straight-line segments and the
circular arc AC. Hence, by a simple geometric construction of the fourth
term in a proportion, a line segment b equal in length to AC can easily
be drawn. On drawing a rectangle with 2b as one side and a as the other,
we have a rectangle exactly equal in area to the area of the circle with
radius a; a square equal to the rectangle is easily constructed by
taking as the side of the square the geometric mean of the sides of the
rectangle. Inasmuch as Dinostratus showed that the trisectrix of Hippias
serves to square the circle, the curve more commonly came to be known as
the quadratrix. It was, of course, always clear to the Greeks that the
use of the curve in the trisection and quadrature problems violated the
rules of the game—that only circles and straight lines were permitted.
The “solutions” of Hippias and Dinostratus, as their authors realized,
were sophistic; hence, the search for further solutions, canonical or
illegitimate, continued, with the result that several new curves were
discovered by Greek geometers.</p>
<p>Autolycus of Pitane</p>
<p>A few years after Dinostratus and Menaechmus, in the second half of
the fourth century BCE, there flourished an astronomer who has the
distinction of having written the oldest surviving Greek mathematical
treatise. Autolycus of Pitane is the author of a treatise, On the Moving
Sphere, that formed part of a collection known as the “Little
Astronomy,” which was widely used by ancient astronomers. On the Moving
Sphere is not a profound and probably not a very original work, for it
includes little beyond elementary theorems on the geometry of the sphere
that would be needed in astronomy. Its chief significance lies in the
fact that it indicates that Greek geometry had reached the form that we
regard as typical of the classical age. Theorems are clearly enunciated
and proved. Moreover, the author uses without proof or indication of
source other theorems that he regards as well known. We conclude,
therefore, that in Greece in his day, about 320 BCE, a thoroughly
established textbook tradition in geometry existed.</p>
<p>Aristotle</p>
<p>Aristotle (384–322 BCE), that most widely learned scholar, like
Eudoxus, was a student of Plato’s and, like Menaechmus, a tutor of
Alexander the Great. Aristotle was primarily a philosopher and a
biologist, but he was thoroughly au courant with the activities of the
mathematicians. He may have taken a role in one of the leading
controversies of the day, for to him was ascribed a treatise titled On
Indivisible Lines. Modern scholarship questions the authenticity of this
work, but, in any case, it probably was the result of discussions
carried on in the Aristotelian Lyceum. The thesis of the treatise is
that the doctrine of indivisibles espoused by Xenocrates, a successor of
Plato as head of the Academy, is untenable. Xenocrates thought that the
notion of an indivisible, or fixed infinitesimal of length or area or
volume, would resolve the paradoxes, such as those of Zeno, that plagued
mathematical and philosophical thought. Aristotle, too, devoted much
attention to the paradoxes of Zeno, but he sought to refute them on the
basis of common sense. He hesitated to follow Platonic mathematicians
into the abstractions and technicalities of the day and made no lasting
contribution to the subject. Through his foundation of logic and his
frequent allusion to mathematical concepts and theorems in his
voluminous works, Aristotle can be regarded as having contributed to the
development of mathematics. The Aristotelian discussion of the
potentially and actually infinite in arithmetic and geometry influenced
many later writers on the foundations of mathematics, but Aristotle’s
statement that mathematicians “do not need the infinite or use it”
should be compared with the assertions of our day that the infinite is
the mathematician’s paradise. Of more positive significance is
Aristotle’s analysis of the roles of definitions and hypotheses in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In 323 BCE, Alexander the Great suddenly died, and his empire fell
apart. His generals divided the territory over which the young conqueror
had ruled. In Athens, where Aristotle had been regarded as a foreigner,
the philosopher found himself unpopular now that his powerful
soldier-student was dead. He left Athens and died the following year.
Throughout the Greek world, the old order was changing, politically and
culturally. Under Alexander, there had been a gradual blending of
Hellenic and Oriental customs and learning, so that it was more
appropriate to speak of the newer civilization as Hellenistic, rather
than Hellenic. Moreover, the new city of Alexandria, established by the
world conqueror, now took the place of Athens as the center of the
mathematical world. In the history of civilization, it is therefore
customary to distinguish two periods in the Greek world, with the almost
simultaneous deaths of Aristotle and Alexander (as well as that of
Demosthenes) as a convenient dividing line. The earlier portion is known
as the Hellenic Age, the later as the Hellenistic or Alexandrian Age. In
the next few chapters, we describe the mathematics of the first century
of the new era, often known as the Golden Age of Greek mathematics.</p>
