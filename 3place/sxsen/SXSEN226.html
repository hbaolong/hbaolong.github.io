<h4 id="william-rowan-hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</h4>
<p>Hamilton’s father, a practicing attorney, and his mother, said to
have been intellectually gifted, both died while he was a boy, but even
before he was orphaned, the young Hamilton’s education had been
determined by an uncle who was a linguist. An extremely precocious
youngster, William read Greek, Hebrew, and Latin by the time he was
five; at the age of ten, he was acquainted with half a dozen oriental
languages. A meeting with a lightning calculator a few years later
perhaps spurred Hamilton’s already strong interest in mathematics, as
friendships with</p>
<p>W illiam Ro wan Hamilt on</p>
<p>William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge probably encouraged
him to continue to produce the bad poetry he had been writing since
boyhood. Hamilton entered Trinity College, Dublin, and while still an
undergraduate there, at the age of twenty-two, he was appointed Royal
Astronomer of Ireland, director of the Dunsink Observatory, and
professor of astronomy. In the same year, he presented to the Irish
Academy a paper on systems of rays, in which he expressed one of his
favorite themes—that space and time are “indissolubly connected with
each other.” Perhaps Hamilton here was following in algebra the lead of
Newton, who, when he had difficulty defining abstract concepts in the
method of fluxions, felt more comfortable in appealing to the notion of
time in the physical universe. Possibly, he was simply concluding that
because geometry is the science of space, and space and time are the two
aspects of sensuous intuition, algebra should be the science of
time.</p>
<p>Shortly after he presented his first paper, Hamilton’s prediction of
conical refraction in certain crystals was experimentally confirmed by
physicists. This verification of a mathematical theory assured his
reputation, and at the age of thirty, he was knighted. Two years
earlier, in 1833, he had presented a long and significant paper before
the Irish Academy, in which he introduced a formal algebra of real
number couples, the rules of combination of which are precisely those
given today for the system of complex numbers. The important rule for
multiplication of the couples is, of course,</p>
<p>ða;bÞðα;βÞ5ðaα2bβ;aβ1bαÞ;</p>
<p>and he interpreted this product as an operation involving rotation.
Here one sees the definitive view of a complex number as an ordered pair
of real numbers, an idea that had been implied in the graphical
representations of Wessel, Argand, and Gauss but that now for the first
time was made explicit.</p>
<p>Hamilton realized that his ordered pairs could be thought of as
directed entities in the plane, and he naturally tried to extend the
idea to three dimensions by going from the binary complex number a1bi to
ordered number triples a1bi1cj. The operation of addition created no
difficulty, but for ten years, he was baffled by multiplication of
n-tuples for n greater than 2. One day in 1843, as he was walking with
his wife along the Royal Canal, he had a flash of inspiration: his
difficulty would vanish if he used quadruples instead of triples and if
he abandoned the commutative law for multiplication. It had been more or
less clear that for number quadruples a1bi1cj1dk, one should take i2 5j2
5k2 521. Now Hamilton saw in addition that he should let ij5k, but
ji52k, and, similarly, jk52kj and ki5j52ik. In other respects, the laws
of operation are as in ordinary algebra.</p>
<p>Just as Lobachevsky had created a new geometry consistent within
itself, by abandoning the parallel postulate, so Hamilton created a new
algebra, also consistent within itself, by discarding the commutative
postulate for multiplication. He stopped in his walk, and, with a knife,
he cut the fundamental formula i2 5j2 5k2 5ijk on a stone of Brougham
Bridge; the same day, October 16, he asked the Royal Irish Academy for
leave to read a paper on quaternions at the next session. The key
discovery was sudden, but the discoverer had been working toward it for
some fifteen years. Hamilton, quite naturally, always regarded the
discovery of quaternions as his greatest achievement. In retrospect, it
is clear that it was not so much this particular type of algebra that
was significant, but rather the discovery of the tremendous freedom that
mathematics enjoys to build algebras that need not satisfy the
restrictions imposed by the so-called fundamental laws, which up to that
time, supported by the vague principle of permanence of form, had been
invoked without exception. For the last twenty years of his life,
Hamilton spent his energies on his favorite algebra, which he was
inclined to imbue with cosmic significance and which some British
mathematicians regarded as a kind of Leibnizian arithmetica universalis.
His Lectures on Quaternions appeared in 1853. Much of this bulky work is
devoted to applications of quaternions to geometry, differential
geometry, and physics. Of primary significance for the history of modern
algebra is the fact that Hamilton here presented a detailed theory of a
noncommutative algebraic system.</p>
<p>Among the basic concepts discussed in the book are those of vectors
and scalars. The quaternion units i, j, and k were variously described
as operators and as coordinates. Generally, Hamilton treated quaternions
as vectors and essentially showed that they form a linear vector space
over the real number field. He defined the addition of quaternions and
introduced the notion of two types of products, obtained by multiplying
a vector by a scalar or by another vector, respectively; he observed
that the first is associative, distributive, and commutative, whereas
the latter is only associative and distributive. He also discussed the
inner product (“scalar product”) of two vectors and demonstrated its
bilinearity.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Hamilton devoted himself to the preparation of the
enlarged Elements of Quaternions. This was not quite completed when he
died in 1865, but it was edited and published by his son in the
following year. It is gratifying for Americans to recall that in those
unhappy years of civil strife, the newly established National Academy of
Sciences named Sir William Rowan Hamilton its first foreign
associate.</p>
