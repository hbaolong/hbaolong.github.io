<h4 id="the-era-and-the-sources">The Era and the Sources</h4>
<p>About 450 BCE, Herodotus, the inveterate Greek traveler and narrative
historian, visited Egypt. He viewed ancient monuments, interviewed
priests, and observed the majesty of the Nile and the achievements of
those working along its banks. His resulting account would become a
cornerstone for the narrative of Egypt’s ancient history. When it came
to mathematics, he held that geometry had originated in Egypt, for he
believed that the subject had arisen there from the practical need for
resurveying after the
annualfloodingoftherivervalley.Acenturylater,thephilosopherAristotle
speculated on the same subject and attributed the Egyptians’ pursuit of
geometry to the existence of a priestly leisure class. The debate,

<p>The Era and t he S ource s</p>
<p>well beyond the confines of Egypt, about whether to credit progress
in mathematics to the practical men (the surveyors, or
“rope-stretchers”) or to the contemplative elements of society (the
priests and the philosophers) has continued to our times. As we shall
see, the history of mathematics displays a constant interplay between
these two types of contributors.</p>
<p>In attempting to piece together the history of mathematics in ancient
Egypt, scholars until the nineteenth century encountered two major
obstacles. The first was the inability to read the source materials that
existed. The second was the scarcity of such materials. For more than
thirty-five centuries, inscriptions used hieroglyphic writing, with
variations from purely ideographic to the smoother hieratic and
eventually the still more flowing demotic forms. After the third century
CE, when they were replaced by Coptic and eventually supplanted by
Arabic, knowledge of hieroglyphs faded. The breakthrough that enabled
modern scholars to decipher the ancient texts came early in the
nineteenth century when the French scholar Jean-Franc¸ois Champollion,
working with multilingual tablets, was able to slowly translate a number
of hieroglyphs. These studies were supplemented by those of other
scholars, including the British physicist Thomas Young, who were
intrigued by the Rosetta Stone, a trilingual basalt slab with
inscriptions in hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek writings that had been
found by members of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition in 1799. By 1822,
Champollion was able to announce a substantive portion of his
translations in a famous letter sent to the Academy of Sciences in
Paris, and by the time of his death in 1832, he had published a grammar
textbook and the beginning of a dictionary.</p>
<p>Although these early studies of hieroglyphic texts shed some light on
Egyptian numeration, they still produced no purely mathematical
materials. This situation changed in the second half of the nineteenth
century. In 1858, the Scottish antiquary Henry Rhind purchased a papyrus
roll in Luxor that is about one foot high and some eighteen feet long.
Except for a few fragments in the Brooklyn Museum, this papyrus is now
in the British Museum. It is known as the Rhind or the Ahmes Papyrus, in
honor of the scribe by whose hand it had been copied in about 1650 BCE.
The scribe tells us that the material is derived from a prototype from
the Middle Kingdom of about 2000 to 1800 BCE. Written in the hieratic
script, it became the major source of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian
mathematics. Another important papyrus, known as the Golenishchev or
Moscow Papyrus, was purchased in 1893 and is now in the Pushkin Museum
of Fine Arts in Moscow. It, too, is about eighteen feet long but is
onlyone-fourthaswideastheAhmesPapyrus.Itwaswrittenlesscarefully than the
work of Ahmes was, by an unknown scribe of circa. 1890 BCE. It
containstwenty-fiveexamples,mostlyfrompracticallifeandnotdiffering
greatly from those of Ahmes, except for two that will be discussed
further on. Yet another twelfth-dynasty papyrus, the Kahun, is now in
London; a Berlin papyrus is of the same period. Other, somewhat earlier,
materials are two wooden tablets from Akhmim of about 2000 BCE and a
leather roll containinga listof fractions.Mostof this
materialwasdeciphered withina hundred years of Champollion’s death.
There is a striking degree of coincidence between certain aspects of the
earliest known inscriptionsand the few mathematical texts of the Middle
Kingdom that constitute our known source material.</p>
