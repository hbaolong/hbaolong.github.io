<h4 id="chapter-10-ancient-and-medieval-india">Chapter 10 Ancient and
Medieval India</h4>
<p>A mixture of pearl shells and sour dates . . .or of costly crystal
and common pebbles.</p>
<p>—Al-Biruni’s India</p>
<p>Early Mathematics in India</p>
<p>Archaeological excavations at Mohenjo Daro and Harappa give evidence
of an old and highly cultured civilization in the Indus Valley during
the era of the Egyptian pyramid builders (ca. 2650 BCE), but we have no
Indian mathematical documents from that age. There is evidence of
structured systems of weights and measures, and samples of decimal-based
numeration have been found. During this period and succeeding centuries,
however, major movements and conquests of people occurred on the Indian
subcontinent. Many of the languages and the dialects that evolved as a
result have not been deciphered. It is therefore difficult at this stage
to plot a time-space chart of mathematical activities for this vast
area. The linguistic challenges are compounded by the fact that the
earliest known Indian language samples were part of an oral tradition,
rather than a written one. Nevertheless, Vedic Sanskrit, the language in
question, presents us with the earliest concrete information about
ancient Indian mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>The Vedas, groups of ancient, essentially religious texts, include
references to large numbers and decimal systems. Especially interesting
are dimensions, shapes, and proportions given for bricks used in the
construction of ritual fire altars. India, like Egypt, had its
“rope-stretchers,” and the sparse geometric lore acquired in connection
with the laying out of temples and the measurement and construction of
altars took the form of a body of knowledge known as the Sulbasutras, or
“rules of the cord.” Sulba (or sulva) refers to cords used for
measurements, and sutra means a book of rules or aphorisms relating to a
ritual or a science. The stretching of ropes is strikingly reminiscent
of the origin of Egyptian geometry, and its association with temple
functions reminds one of the possible ritual origin of mathematics. Yet,
the difficulty of dating the rules is also matched by doubt concerning
the influence the Egyptians had on later Hindu mathematicians. Even more
so than in the case of China, there is a striking lack of continuity of
tradition in the mathematics of India.</p>
<p>The Sulbasutras</p>
<p>There are a number of Sulbasutras; the major extant ones, all in
verse, are associated with the names of Baudhayama, Manava, Katyayana,
and the best-known, Apastamba. They may date from the first half of the
first millennium BCE, although earlier and later dates have been
suggested as well. We find rules for the construction of right angles by
means of triples of cords the lengths of which form “Pythagorean”
triads, such as 3, 4, and 5; or 5, 12, and 13; or 8, 15, and 17; or 12,
35, and 37. Although Mesopotamian influence in the Sulbasutras is not
unlikely, we know of no conclusive evidence for or against this.
Apastamba knew that the square on the diagonal of a rectangle is equal
to the sum of the squares on the two adjacent sides. Less easily
explained is another rule given by Apastamba—one that strongly resembles
some of the geometric algebra in Book II of Euclid’s Elements. To
construct a square equal in area to the rectangle ABCD (Fig. 10.1), lay
off the shorter sides on the longer, so that AF = AB = BE = CD, and draw
HG bisecting segments CE and DF; extend EF to K, GH to L, and AB to M so
that FK = HL = FH = AM, and draw LKM. Now construct a rectangle with a
diagonal equal to LG and with a shorter side HFE. Then, the longer side
of this rectangle is the side of the square desired.</p>
<p>FIG. 10.1</p>
<p>There are also rules for transforming rectilinear into curvilinear
shapes and vice versa. So conjectural are the origin and the period of
the Sulbasutras that we cannot tell whether the rules are related to
early Egyptian surveying or to the later Greek problem of altar
doubling.</p>
<p>The Siddhantas</p>
<p>There are references to arithmetic and geometric series in Vedic
literature that purport to go back to 2000 BCE, but no contemporary
documents from India are available to confirm this. It has also been
claimed that the first recognition of incommensurables is to be found in
India during the Sulbasutra period, but such claims are not well
substantiated. The period of the Sulbasutras was followed by the age of
the Siddhantas, or systems (of astronomy). Five different versions of
the Siddhantas are known by the names: Paulisha Siddhanta, Surya
Siddhanta, Vasisishta Siddhanta, Paitamaha Siddhanta, and Romanka
Siddhanta. Of these, the Surya Siddhanta (System of the Sun), written
about 400 CE, is the only one that seems to be completely extant.
According to the text, written in epic stanzas, it is the work of Surya,
the Sun God. The main astronomical doctrines are evidently Greek, but
with the retention of considerable old Hindu folklore. The Paulisha
Siddhanta, which dates from about 380 CE, was summarized by the Hindu
mathematician Varahamihira (fl. 505 CE), who also listed the other four
Siddhantas. It was referred to frequently by the Arabic scholar
al-Biruni, who suggested a Greek origin or influence. Later writers
report that the Siddhantas were in substantial agreement on substance,
only the phraseology varied; hence, we can assume that the others, such
as the Surya Siddhanta, were compendia of astronomy comprising cryptic
rules in Sanskrit verse, with little explanation and without proof.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the Siddhantas stem from the late fourth
or the early fifth century, but there is sharp disagreement about the
origin of the knowledge that they contain. Indian scholars insist on the
originality and independence of the authors, whereas Western writers are
inclined to see definite signs of Greek influence. It is not unlikely,
for example, that the Paulisha Siddhanta was derived in considerable
measure from the work of the astrologer Paul, who lived in Alexandria
shortly before the presumed date of composition of the Siddhantas.
(Al-Biruni, in fact, explicitly attributes this Siddhanta to Paul of
Alexandria.) This would account in a simple manner for the obvious
similarities between portions of the Siddhantas and the trigonometry and
the astronomy of Ptolemy. The Paulisha Siddhanta, for example, uses the
value 3 177/1250 for π, which is in essential agreement with the
Ptolemaic sexagesimal value 3;8,30.</p>
<p>Even if Indian authors did acquire their knowledge of trigonometry
from the cosmopolitan Hellenism at Alexandria, the material in their
hands took on a significantly new form. Whereas the trigonometry of
Ptolemy had been based on the functional relationship between the chords
of a circle and the central angles they subtend, the writers of the
Siddhantas converted this to a study of the correspondence between half
of a chord of a circle and half of the angle subtended at the center by
the whole chord. Thus was born, apparently in India, the predecessor of
the modern trigonometric function known as the sine of an angle, and the
introduction of the sine function represents the chief contribution of
the Siddhantas to the history of mathematics. It was through the
Indians, and not the Greeks, that our use of the half chord has been
derived, and our word “sine,” through misadventure in translation (see
further on), has descended from the Sanskrit name jiva.</p>
<p>Aryabhata</p>
<p>During the sixth century, shortly after the composition of the
Siddhantas, there lived two Indian mathematicians who are known to have
written books on the same type of material. The older and more important
of the two was Aryabhata, whose best-known work, written around 499 CE
and titled Aryabhatiya, is a slim volume, written in verse, covering
astronomy and mathematics. The names of several Hindu mathematicians
before this time are known, but nothing of their work has been preserved
beyond a few fragments. In this respect, then, the position of the
Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata in India is somewhat akin to that of the
Elements of Euclid in Greece some eight centuries earlier. Both are
summaries of earlier developments, compiled by a single author. There
are, however, more striking differences than similarities between the
two works. The Elements is a well-ordered synthesis of pure mathematics
with a high degree of abstraction, a clear logical structure, and an
obvious pedagogical inclination; the Aryabhatiya is a brief descriptive
work, in 123 metrical stanzas, intended to supplement rules of
calculation used in astronomy and mensurational mathematics, with no
appearance of deductive methodology. About a third of the work is on
ganitapada, or mathematics. This section opens with the names of the
powers of 10 up to the tenth place and then proceeds to give
instructions for square and cube roots of integers. Rules of mensuration
follow, about half of which are erroneous. The area of a triangle is
correctly given as half the product of the base and altitude, but the
volume of a pyramid is also taken to be half of the product of the base
and the altitude. The area of a circle is found correctly as the product
of the circumference and half of the diameter, but the volume of a
sphere is incorrectly stated to be the product of the area of a great
circle and the square root of this area. Again, in the calculation of
areas of quadrilaterals, correct and incorrect rules appear side by
side. The area of a trapezoid is expressed as half of the sum of the
parallel sides multiplied by the perpendicular between them, but then
follows the incomprehensible assertion that the area of any plane figure
is found by determining two sides and multiplying them. One statement in
the Aryabhatiya to which Indian scholars have pointed with pride is as
follows:</p>
<p>Add 4 to 100, multiply by 8, and add 62,000. The result is
approximately the circumference of a circle of which the diameter is
20,000. (Clark 1930, p. 28)</p>
<p>Here we see the equivalent of 3.1416 for π, but it should be recalled
that this is essentially the value Ptolemy had used. The likelihood that
Aryabhata here was influenced by Greek predecessors is strengthened by
his adoption of the myriad, 10,000, as the number of units in the
radius.</p>
<p>A typical portion of the Aryabhatiya is that involving arithmetic
progressions, which contains arbitrary rules for finding the sum of the
terms in a progression and for determining the number of terms in a
progression when given the first term, the common difference, and the
sum of the terms. The first rule had long been known by earlier writers.
The second is a curiously complicated bit of exposition:</p>
<p>Multiply the sum of the progression by eight times the common
difference, add the square of the difference between twice the first
term, and the common difference, take the square root of this, subtract
twice the first term, divide by the common difference, add one, divide
by two. The result will be the number of terms.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere in the Aryabhatiya, no motivation or justification
is given for the rule. It was probably arrived at through a solution of
a quadratic equation, knowledge of which might have come from
Mesopotamia or Greece. Following some complicated problems on compound
interest (that is, geometric progressions), the author turns, in flowery
language, to the very elementary problem of finding the fourth term in a
simple proportion:</p>
<p>In the rule of three multiply the fruit by the desire and divide by
the measure. The result will be the fruit of the desire.</p>
<p>This, of course, is the familiar rule that if a/b = c/x, then x =
bc/a, where a is the “measure,” b the “fruit,” c the “desire,” and x the
“fruit of the desire.” The work of Aryabhata is indeed a potpourri of
the simple and the complex, the correct and the incorrect. The Arabic
scholar al-Biruni, half a millennium later, characterized Indian
mathematics as a mixture of common pebbles and costly crystals, a
description quite appropriate to Aryabhatiya.</p>
<p>Numerals</p>
<p>The second half of the Aryabhatiya is on the reckoning of time and on
spherical trigonometry; here we note an element that would leave a
permanent impression on the mathematics of later generations—the decimal
place-value numeration. It is not known just how Aryabhata carried out
his calculations, but his phrase “from place to place each is ten times
the preceding” is an indication that the application of the principle of
position was in his mind. “Local value” had been an essential part of
Babylonian numeration, and perhaps the Hindus were becoming aware of its
applicability to the decimal notation for integers in use in India. The
development of numerical notations in India seems to have followed about
the same pattern found in Greece. Inscriptions from the earliest period
at Mohenjo Daro show at first simple vertical strokes, arranged into
groups, but by the time of Asoka (third century BCE) a system resembling
the Herodianic was in use. In the newer scheme the repetitive principle
was continued, but new symbols of higher order were adopted for 4, 10,
20, and 100. This so-called Karosthi script then gradually gave way to
another notation, known as the Brahmi characters, which resembled the
alphabetic cipherization in the Greek Ionian system; one wonders whether
it was only a coincidence that the change in India took place shortly
after the period when in Greece the Herodianic numerals were displaced
by the Ionian.</p>
<p>From the Brahmi ciphered numerals to our present-day notation for
integers, two short steps are needed. The first is a recognition that
through the use of the positional principle, the ciphers for the first
nine units can also serve as the ciphers for the corresponding multiples
of 10 or equally well as ciphers for the corresponding multiples of any
power of 10. This recognition would make superfluous all of the Brahmi
ciphers beyond the first nine. It is not known when the reduction to
nine ciphers occurred, and it is likely that the transition to the more
economical notation was made only gradually. It appears from extant
evidence that the change took place in India, but the source of the
inspiration for the change is uncertain. Possibly, the so-called Hindu
numerals were the result of internal development alone; perhaps they
developed first along the western interface between India and Persia,
where remembrance of the Babylonian positional notation may have led to
modification of the Brahmi system. It is possible that the newer system
arose along the eastern interface with China, where the pseudopositional
rod numerals may have suggested the reduction to nine ciphers. There is
also a theory that this reduction may first have been made at Alexandria
within the Greek alphabetic system and that subsequently the idea spread
to India. During the later Alexandrian period, the earlier Greek habit
of writing common fractions with the numerator beneath the denominator
was reversed, and it is this form that was adopted by the Hindus,
without the bar between the two. Unfortunately, the Hindus did not apply
the new numeration for integers to the realm of decimal fractions;
hence, the chief potential advantage of the change from Ionian notation
was lost.</p>
<p>The earliest specific reference to the Hindu numerals is found in 662
in the writings of Severus Sebokt, a Syrian bishop. After Justinian
closed the Athenian philosophical schools, some of the scholars moved to
Syria, where they established centers of Greek learning. Sebokt
evidently felt piqued by the disdain for non-Greek learning expressed by
some associates; hence, he found it expedient to remind those who spoke
Greek that “there are also others who know something.” To illustrate his
point, he called attention to the Hindus and their “subtle discoveries
in astronomy,” especially “their valuable methods of calculation, and
their computing that surpasses description. I wish only to say that this
computation is done by means of nine signs” (Smith 1958, Vol. I,
p. 167). That the numerals had been in use for some time is indicated by
the fact that they occur on an Indian plate of the year 595 CE, where
the date 346 is written in decimal place value notation.</p>
<p>The Symbol for Zero</p>
<p>It should be remarked that the reference to nine symbols, rather than
ten, implies that the Hindus evidently had not yet taken the second step
in the transition to the modern system of numeration—the introduction of
a notation for a missing position—that is, a zero symbol. The history of
mathematics holds many anomalies, and not the least of these is the fact
that “the earliest undoubted occurrence of a zero in India is in an
inscription of 876” (Smith 1958, Vol. II, p. 69)—that is, more than two
centuries after the first reference to the other nine numerals. It is
not even established that the number zero (as distinct from a symbol for
an empty position) arose in conjunction with the other nine Hindu
numerals. It is quite possible that zero originated in the Greek world,
perhaps at Alexandria, and that it was transmitted to India after the
decimal positional system had been established there.</p>
<p>The history of the zero placeholder in positional notation is further
complicated by the fact that the concept appeared independently, well
before the days of Columbus, in the western as well as the eastern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>With the introduction, in the Hindu notation, of the tenth numeral, a
round goose egg for zero, the modern system of numeration for integers
was completed. Although the medieval Hindu forms of the ten numerals
differ considerably from those in use today, the principles of the
system were established. The new numeration, which we generally call the
Hindu system, is merely a new combination of three basic principles, all
of ancient origin: (1) a decimal base; (2) a positional notation; and
(3) a ciphered form for each of the ten numerals. Not one of these three
was originally devised by the Hindus, but it presumably is due to them
that the three were first linked to form the modern system of
numeration.</p>
<p>It may be well to say a word about the form of the Hindu symbol for
zero—which is also ours. It was once assumed that the round form
originally stemmed from the Greek letter omicron, the initial letter in
the word “ouden,” or “empty,” but recent investigations seem to belie
such an origin. Although the symbol for an empty position in some of the
extant versions of Ptolemy’s tables of chords does seem to resemble an
omicron, the early zero symbols in Greek sexagesimal fractions are round
forms variously embellished and differing markedly from a simple goose
egg. Moreover, when in the fifteenth century in the Byzantine Empire a
decimal positional system was fashioned out of the old alphabetic
numerals by dropping the last eighteen letters and adding a zero symbol
to the first nine letters, the zero sign took forms quite unlike an
omicron. Sometimes it resembled an inverted form of our small letter h;
other times, it appeared as a dot.</p>
<p>Trigonometry</p>
<p>The development of our system of notation for integers was one of the
two most influential contributions of India to the history of
mathematics. The other was the introduction of an equivalent of the sine
function in trigonometry to replace the Greek tables of chords. The
earliest tables of the sine relationship that have survived are those in
the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya. Here the sines of angles up to 90°
are given for twenty-four equal intervals of each. In order to express
arc length and sine length in terms of the same unit, the radius was
taken as 3,438 and the circumference as 360 · 60 = 21,600. This implies
a value of π agreeing to four significant figures with that of Ptolemy.
In another connection, Aryabhata used the value for π, which appeared so
frequently in India that it is sometimes known as the Hindu value.</p>
<p>For the sine of , the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya took the number
of units in the arc—that is, 60 × or 225. In modern language, the sine
of a small angle is very nearly equal to the radian measure of the angle
(which is virtually what the Hindus were using). For further items in
the sine table, the Hindus used a recursion formula that may be
expressed as follows. If the nth sine in the sequence from n = 1 to n =
24 is designated as sn, and if the sum of the first n sines is Sn, then
sn + 1 = sn + s1 − Sn/s1. From this rule, one easily deduces that sin =
449, sin , sin 15° = 890, and so on, up to sin 90° = 3,438—the values
listed in the table in the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya. Moreover, the
table also includes values for what we call the versed sine of the angle
(that is, 1 − cos θ in modern trigonometry or 3,438 [1 − cos θ] in Hindu
trigonometry) from vers = 7 to vers 90° = 3,438. If we divide the items
in the table by 3,438, the results are found to be in close agreement
with the corresponding values in modern trigonometric tables (Smith
1958, Vol. II).</p>
<p>Multiplication</p>
<p>Trigonometry was evidently a useful and accurate tool in astronomy.
How the Indians arrived at results such as the recursion formula is
uncertain, but it has been suggested that an intuitive approach to
difference equations and interpolation may have prompted such rules.
Indian mathematics is frequently described as “intuitive,” in contrast
to the stern rationalism of Greek geometry. Although in Indian
trigonometry there is evidence of Greek influence, the Indians seem to
have had no occasion to borrow Greek geometry, concerned as they were
with simple mensurational rules. Of the classical geometric problems or
the study of curves other than the circle, there is little evidence in
India, and even the conic sections seem to have been overlooked by the
Indians, as by the Chinese. Hindu mathematicians were instead fascinated
by work with numbers, whether it involved the ordinary arithmetic
operations or the solution of determinate or indeterminate equations.
Addition and multiplication were carried out in India much as they are
by us today, except that the Indians seem at first to have preferred to
write numbers with the smaller units on the left, hence to work from
left to right, using small blackboards with white removable paint or a
board covered with sand or flour. Among the devices used for
multiplication was one that is known under various names: lattice
multiplication, gelosia multiplication, or cell or grating or
quadrilateral multiplication. The scheme behind this is readily
recognized in two examples. In the first example (Fig. 10.2), the number
456 is multiplied by 34. The multiplicand has been written above the
lattice and the multiplier appears to the left, with the partial
products occupying the square cells. Digits in the diagonal rows are
added, and the product 15,504 is read off at the bottom and the right.
To indicate that other arrangements are possible, a second example is
given in Fig. 10.3, in which the multiplicand 537 is placed at the top,
the multiplier 24 is on the right, and the product 12,888 appears to the
left and along the bottom. Still other modifications are easily devised.
In fundamental principle, gelosia multiplication is, of course, the same
as our own, the cell arrangement being merely a convenient device for
relieving the mental concentration called for in “carrying over” from
place to place the 10s arising in the partial products. The only
“carrying” required in lattice multiplication is in the final additions
along the diagonals.</p>

<p>Long Division</p>
<p>It is not known when or where gelosia multiplication arose, but India
seems to be the most likely source. It was used there at least by the
twelfth century, and from India, it seems to have been carried to China
and Arabia. From the Arabs, it passed over to Italy in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, where the name gelosia was attached to it
because of the resemblance to gratings placed on windows in Venice and
elsewhere. (The current word “jalousie” seems to stem from the Italian
gelosia and is used for Venetian blinds in France, Germany, Holland, and
Russia.) The Arabs (and, through them, the later Europeans) appear to
have adopted most of their arithmetic devices from the Hindus, so it is
likely that the pattern of long division known as the “scratch method”
or the “galley method” (from its resemblance to a boat) also came from
India. (See the following illustration.) To illustrate the method, let
it be required to divide 44,977 by 382. In Fig. 10.4 we give the modern
method, in Fig. 10.5 the galley method. The latter closely parallels the
former, except that the dividend appears in the middle, for subtractions
are performed by canceling digits and placing differences above, rather
than below, the minuends. Hence, the remainder, 283, appears above and
to the right, rather than below.</p>
<p>FIG. 10.4</p>
<p>FIG. 10.5</p>
<p>The process in Fig. 10.5 is easy to follow if we note that the digits
in a given subtrahend, such as 2,674, or in a given difference, such as
2,957, are not necessarily all in the same row and that subtrahends are
written below the middle and differences above the middle. Position in a
column is significant, but not position in a row. The determination of
roots of numbers probably followed a somewhat similar “galley” pattern,
coupled in the later years with the binomial theorem in “Pascal
triangle” form, but Indian writers did not provide explanations for
their calculations or proofs for their statements. It is possible that
Babylonian and Chinese influences played a role in the problem of
evolution or root extraction. It is often said that the “proof by
nines,” or the “casting out of nines,” is a Hindu invention, but it
appears that the Greeks knew earlier of this property, without using it
extensively, and that the method came into common use only with the
Arabs of the eleventh century.</p>

<p>Brahmagupta</p>
<p>The last few paragraphs may leave the unwarranted impression that
there was a uniformity in Hindu mathematics, for we have frequently
localized developments as merely “of Indian origin,” without specifying
the period. The trouble is that there is a high degree of uncertainty in
Hindu chronology. Material in the important Bakshali manuscript,
containing an anonymous arithmetic, is supposed by some to date from the
third or fourth century, by others from the sixth century, and by others
from the eighth or ninth century or later, and there is a suggestion
that it may not even be of Hindu origin. We have placed the work of
Aryabhata around the year 500 CE, but there were two mathematicians
named Aryabhata, and we cannot with certainty ascribe results to our
Aryabhata, the elder. Hindu mathematics presents more historical
problems than does Greek mathematics, for Indian authors referred to
predecessors infrequently, and they exhibited surprising independence in
mathematical approach. Thus, it is that Brahmagupta (fl. 628 CE), who
lived in Central India somewhat more than a century after Aryabhata, has
little in common with his predecessor, who had lived in eastern India.
Brahmagupta mentions two values of π—the “practical value” 3 and the
“neat value” —but not the more accurate value of Aryabhata; in the
trigonometry of his best-known work, the Brahmasphuta Siddhanta, he
adopted a radius of 3,270, instead of Aryabhata’s 3,438. In one respect,
he does resemble his predecessor—in the juxtaposition of good and bad
results. He found the “gross” area of an isosceles triangle by
multiplying half of the base by one of the equal sides; for the scalene
triangle with base fourteen and sides thirteen and fifteen, he found the
“gross area” by multiplying half of the base by the arithmetic mean of
the other sides. In finding the “exact” area, he used the
Archimedean-Heronian formula. For the radius of the circle circumscribed
about a triangle, he gave the equivalent of the correct trigonometric
result 2R = a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C, but this, of course, is only a
reformulation of a result known to Ptolemy in the language of chords.
Perhaps the most beautiful result in Brahmagupta’s work is the
generalization of “Heron’s” formula in finding the area of a
quadrilateral. This formula,</p>
<p>where a, b, c, d are the sides and s is the semiperimeter, still
bears his name, but the glory of his achievement is dimmed by failure to
remark that the formula is correct only in the case of a cyclic
quadrilateral. The correct formula for an arbitrary quadrilateral is</p>
<p>where α is half of the sum of two opposite angles. As a rule for the
“gross” area of a quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave the pre-Hellenic
formula, the product of the arithmetic means of the opposite sides. For
the quadrilateral with sides a = 25, b = 25, c = 25, d = 39, for
example, he found a “gross” area of 800.</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s Formula</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s contributions to algebra are of a higher order than are
his rules of mensuration, for here we find general solutions of
quadratic equations, including two roots even in cases in which one of
them is negative.</p>
<p>The systematized arithmetic of negative numbers and zero is, in fact,
first found in his work. The equivalents of rules on negative magnitudes
were known through the Greek geometric theorems on subtraction, such as
(a − b)(c − d) = ac + bd − ad − be, but the Indians converted these into
numerical rules on positive and negative numbers. Moreover, although the
Greeks had a concept of nothingness, they never interpreted this as a
number, as did the Indians. Yet here again Brahmagupta spoiled matters
somewhat by asserting that 0 ÷ 0 = 0, and on the touchy matter of a ÷ 0,
for a ≠ 0, he did not commit himself:</p>
<p>Positive divided by positive, or negative by negative, is
affirmative. Cipher divided by cipher is naught. Positive divided by
negative is negative. Negative divided by affirmative is negative.
Positive or negative divided by cipher is a fraction with that for
denominator. (Colebrook 1817, Vol. I)</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Hindus, unlike the Greeks,
regarded irrational roots of numbers as numbers. This was of enormous
help in algebra, and Indian mathematicians have been much praised for
taking this step. We have seen the lack of nice distinction on the part
of Hindu mathematicians between exact and inexact results, and it was
only natural that they should not have taken seriously the difference
between commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes. For them, there
was no impediment to the acceptance of irrational numbers, and later
generations uncritically followed their lead until in the
nineteenth-century mathematicians established the real number system on
a sound basis.</p>
<p>Indian mathematics was, as we have said, a mixture of good and bad.
But some of the good was superlatively good, and here Brahmagupta
deserves high praise. Hindu algebra is especially noteworthy in its
development of indeterminate analysis, to which Brahmagupta made several
contributions. For one thing, in his work we find a rule for the
formation of Pythagorean triads expressed in the form m, , , but this is
only a modified form of the old Babylonian rule, with which he may have
become familiar. Brahmagupta’s area formula for a quadrilateral,
mentioned previously, was used by him in conjunction with the
formulas</p>
<p>for the diagonals to find quadrilaterals whose sides, diagonals, and
areas are all rational. Among them was the quadrilateral with sides a =
52, b = 25, c = 39, d = 60, and diagonals 63 and 56. Brahmagupta gave
the “gross” area as , despite the fact that his formula provides the
exact area, 1,764 in this case.</p>
<p>Indeterminate Equations</p>
<p>Like many of his countrymen, Brahmagupta evidently loved mathematics
for its own sake, for no practical-minded engineer would raise questions
such as those Brahmagupta asked about quadrilaterals. One admires his
mathematical attitude even more when one finds that he was apparently
the first one to give a general solution of the linear Diophantine
equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. For this equation
to have integral solutions, the greatest common divisor of a and b must
divide c, and Brahmagupta knew that if a and b are relatively prime, all
solutions of the equation are given by x = p + mb, y = q − ma, where m
is an arbitrary integer. He also suggested the Diophantine quadratic
equation x2 = 1 + py2, which was mistakenly named for John Pell
(1611–1685) but first appeared in the Archimedean cattle problem. The
Pell equation was solved for some cases by Brahmagupta’s countryman
Bhaskara (1114–ca. 1185). It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta
that he gave all integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation,
whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular
solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some
of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek
influence in India—or the possibility that they both made use of a
common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is also interesting to note
that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was
syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by
placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor
below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar.
The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as
well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of
appropriate words.</p>
<p>Bhaskara</p>
<p>India produced a number of later medieval mathematicians, but we
shall describe the work of only one of these—Bhaskara, the leading
mathematician of the twelfth century. It was he who filled some of the
gaps in Brahmagupta’s work, as by giving a general solution of the Pell
equation and by considering the problem of division by zero. Aristotle
had once remarked that there is no ratio by which a number such as 4
exceeds the number zero, but the arithmetic of zero had not been part of
Greek mathematics, and Brahmagupta had been noncommittal on the division
of a number other than zero by the number zero. It is therefore in
Bhaskara’s Vija-Ganita that we find the first statement that such a
quotient is infinite.</p>
<p>Statement: Dividend 3. Divisor 0. Quotient the fraction 3/0. This
fraction of which the denominator is cipher, is termed an infinite
quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has cipher for a
divisor, there is no alteration, though many be inserted or extracted;
as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God.</p>
<p>This statement sounds promising, but a lack of clear understanding of
the situation is suggested by Bhaskara’s further assertion that a/0 · 0
= a.</p>
<p>Bhaskara was one of the last significant medieval mathematicians from
India, and his work represents the culmination of earlier Hindu
contributions. In his best-known treatise, the Lilavati, he compiled
problems from Brahmagupta and others, adding new observations of his
own. The very title of this book may be taken to indicate the uneven
quality of Indian thought, for the name in the title is that of
Bhaskara’s daughter, who, according to legend, lost the opportunity to
marry because of her father’s confidence in his astrological
predictions. Bhaskara had calculated that his daughter might
propitiously marry only at one particular hour on a given day. On what
was to have been her wedding day, the eager girl was bending over the
water clock, as the hour for the marriage approached, when a pearl from
her headdress fell, quite unnoticed, and stopped the outflow of water.
Before the mishap was noted, the propitious hour had passed. To console
the unhappy girl, the father gave her name to the book we are
describing.</p>
<p>The Lilavati</p>
<p>The Lilavati, like the Vija-Ganita, contains numerous problems
dealing with favorite Hindu topics: linear and quadratic equations, both
determinate and indeterminate; simple mensuration; arithmetic and
geometric progressions; surds; Pythagorean triads; and others. The
“broken bamboo” problem, popular in China (and also included by
Brahmagupta), appears in the following form: if a bamboo 32 cubits high
is broken by the wind so that the tip meets the ground 16 cubits from
the base, at what height above the ground was it broken? Also making use
of the Pythagorean theorem is the following problem: A peacock is
perched atop a pillar at the base of which is a snake’s hole. Seeing the
snake at a distance from the pillar, which is three times the height of
the pillar, the peacock pounces on the snake in a straight line before
it can reach its hole. If the peacock and the snake have gone equal
distances, how many cubits from the hole do they meet?</p>
<p>These two problems well illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the
Lilavati, for despite their apparent similarity and the fact that only a
single answer is required, one of the problems is determinate and the
other is indeterminate. In the treating of the circle and the sphere,
the Lilavati also fails to distinguish between exact and approximate
statements. The area of the circle is correctly given as one-quarter the
circumference multiplied by the diameter and the volume of the sphere as
one-sixth the product of the surface area and the diameter, but for the
ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle, Bhaskara suggests either
3,927 to 1,250 or the “gross” value 22/7. The former is equivalent to
the ratio mentioned, but not used, by Aryabhata. There is no hint in
Bhaskara or other Hindu writers that they were aware that all ratios
that had been proposed were only approximations. Yet, Bhaskara severely
condemns his predecessors for using the formulas of Brahmagupta for the
area and the diagonals of a general quadrilateral, because he saw that a
quadrilateral is not uniquely determined by its sides. Evidently, he did
not realize that the formulas are indeed exact for all cyclic
quadrilaterals.</p>
<p>Many of Bhaskara’s problems in the Lilavati and the Vija-Ganita were
evidently derived from earlier Hindu sources; hence, it is no surprise
to note that the author is at his best in dealing with indeterminate
analysis. In connection with the Pell equation, x2 = 1 + py2, proposed
earlier by Brahmagupta, Bhaskara gave particular solutions for the five
cases p = 8, 11, 32, 61, and 67. For x2 = 1 + 61y2, for example, he gave
the solution x = 1,776,319,049 and y = 22,615,390. This is an impressive
feat in calculation, and its verification alone will tax the efforts of
the reader. Bhaskara’s books are replete with other instances of
Diophantine problems.</p>
<p>Madhava and the Keralese School</p>
<p>Beginning in the late fourteenth century, a group of mathematicians
emerged along the southwestern coast of India and came to be known as
members of the “Keralese School,” named after their geographic location
of Kerala. The group appears to have started under the leadership of
Madhava, who is best known for his expansion of the power series for
sines and cosines that is usually named after Newton and the series for
π/4 credited to Leibniz. Among his other contributions are a computation
of π that is accurate to eleven decimal places, computation of the
circumference of a circle using polygons, and expansion of the
arctangent series usually attributed to James Gregory, as well as
various other series expansions and astronomical applications.</p>
<p>Few of Madhava’s original verses have been documented; most of his
work has come down to us through descriptions and references by his
students and other later members of the Keralese school.</p>
<p>The Keralese school, with its astonishing achievements in series
expansions and geometric, arithmetic, and trigonometric procedures, as
well as astronomical observations, has inspired considerable speculation
concerning transmission and influence. Until now, there is inadequate
documentation to support any of the related major conjectures. There is,
however, a great deal to be learned from recent translations of these
and prior texts. (We have given only a few examples of results usually
associated with the seventeenth-century giants of western Europe. For
samples of translations providing a closer appreciation of the nature of
the mathematical issues found in the ancient and medieval Sanskrit
texts, the reader is referred to Plofker 2009.)</p>
