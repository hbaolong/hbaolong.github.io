Twentieth-Century Legacies</h4>
<p>[M]athematics. . .is a ball of wool, a tangled hank where all
[strands]. . .react upon another in an almost unpredictable way.</p>
<p>—Dieudonné</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, it was clear that not only the
content of mathematics but also its institutional and interpersonal
framework had changed radically since the early 1800s. In addition to
the growth of mathematical journals and academic departments during the
century and the traditional individual communication among
mathematicians of different countries, the exchange of mathematical
ideas was furthered greatly by the establishment of national
mathematical societies and international meetings of mathematicians. The
London Mathematical Society, founded in 1865, and the Société
Mathématique de France, established in 1872, led the way. They were
followed in the 1880s by the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in Scotland,
the Circolo Matematico Palermo in Italy, and the New York Mathematical
Society, soon renamed the American Mathematical Society. The Deutsche
Mathematiker-Vereinigung followed in 1890. Each of these groups held
regular meetings and issued periodical publications. An International
Congress of Mathematicians was first held in Chicago in 1893, in
conjunction with the Columbian Exposition. This was followed in 1897 by
the first of a series of “official” congresses of mathematicians, held
every four years except for disruption by the two world wars and the
cold war. The first of these took place in Zurich. During most of the
twentieth century, congresses were held in Europe, the exceptions being
1924 (Toronto), 1974 (Vancouver), 1986 (Berkeley), and 1990 (Kyoto).
Despite major economic and political differences, for the most part,
twentieth-century mathematicians had more rapid awareness of the work of
their colleagues on other continents than their precursors had of
results obtained by someone in a neighboring province.</p>
<p>Other twentieth-century trends that were becoming noticeable toward
the end of the nineteenth century include the emphasis on common
underlying structures that point up correspondences among areas of
mathematics that had been considered unrelated until then. At the same
time, mathematics was no less immune to the fashions and dominance of
certain mathematical schools than were previous periods in history. This
is attributed to the state of research in a given area as well as to the
influence of individual contributors; there are also external factors,
such as developments in allied fields like physics, statistics, and
computer science, or economic and social pressures, which usually serve
to support applications.</p>
<p>Henri Poincaré</p>
<p>When Gauss died in 1855, it was generally thought that there would
never again be a universalist in mathematics—one who is at home in all
branches, pure and applied. If anyone has since proved this view wrong,
it was Poincaré, for he took all mathematics as his province. In several
respects, however, Poincaré differed fundamentally from Gauss. Gauss had
been a calculating prodigy who during his life did not flinch from
involved computations, whereas Poincaré was not especially early in
showing mathematical promise and readily admitted that he had difficulty
with simple arithmetic calculations. Poincaré’s case shows that to be a
great mathematician, one need not excel in number facility; there are
other, more advantageous aspects of innate mathematical ability. Also,
whereas Gauss wrote relatively little, polishing his works, Poincaré
wrote hastily and extensively, publishing more memoirs per year than any
other mathematician. Moreover, Poincaré, especially in later life, wrote
popular books with a philosophical flair, something that had not tempted
Gauss. On the other hand, similarities between Poincaré and Gauss are
numerous and fundamental. Both so teemed with ideas that it was
difficult for them to jot the thoughts down on paper, both had a strong
preference for general theorems over specific cases, and both
contributed to a wide variety of branches of science.</p>
<p>Henri Poincaré (1854–1912) was born in Nancy, a city that was to
harbor a number of leading mathematicians in the twentieth century. The
family achieved eminence in various ways; Henri’s cousin Raymond served
as president of France during World War I. Henri was clumsily
ambidextrous, and his ineptitude in physical exercise was legendary. He
had poor eyesight and was very absentminded, but, like Euler and Gauss,
he had a remarkable capacity for mental exercises in all aspects of
mathematical thought. On graduating from the École Polytechnique in
1875, he took a degree in mining engineering in 1879 and became attached
to the Department of Mines for the rest of his life. Also in 1879, he
earned his doctorate under Hermite at the University of Paris; he would
hold several professorships in mathematics and science there until his
death, besides serving as a professor at the École Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Automorphic Functions and Differential Equations</p>
<p>Poincaré’s doctoral thesis had been on differential equations (not on
methods of solution, but on existence theorems), which led to one of his
most celebrated contributions to mathematics—the properties of
automorphic functions. In fact, he was the virtual founder of the theory
of these functions. An automorphic function f(z) of the complex variable
z is one that is analytic, except for poles, in a domain D and that is
invariant under a denumerably infinite group of linear fractional
transformations</p>
<p>Such functions are generalizations of trigonometric functions (as we
see if a = 1 = d, c = 0, and b is of the form 2kπ) and of elliptic
functions. Hermite had studied such transformations for the restricted
case in which the coefficients a, b, c, and d are integers for which ad
− bc = 1 and had discovered a class of elliptic modular functions
invariant under these. But Poincaré’s generalizations disclosed a
broader category of functions, known as zeta-Fuchsian functions, which,
Poincaré showed, could be used to solve the second-order linear
differential equation with algebraic coefficients.</p>
<p>This was only the beginning of many important contributions by
Poincaré to the theory of differential equations. The subject runs like
a red thread through most of his work. In a synopsis of his own work, he
commented that analysts had faced three major problems since the
establishment of the calculus: the solution of algebraic equations, the
integration of algebraic differentials, and the integration of
differential equations. He observed that in all three cases, history had
shown that success lay not in the traditional attempts at reduction to a
simpler problem but in a head-on attack on the nature of the solution.
This had been the key to the algebraic problem provided by Galois. In
the second case, the attack on algebraic differentials, successes had
been achieved for several decades by those who no longer attempted a
reduction to elementary functions but used the new transcendental
functions. Poincaré had been certain that a similar approach would aid
with previously intractable problems in the solution of differential
equations.</p>
<p>As noted previously, the outlook was already present in his doctoral
thesis. It had been titled “On the Properties of Functions Defined by
Partial Differential Equations.” He tackled the main problem in a series
of papers published in the early 1880s, in which he set out to provide a
qualitative description of solutions. He first attacked the general
equation dx/f(x, y) = dy/g(x, y), where f and g are real polynomials. To
handle the problem of infinite branches, he projected the xy-plane onto
a sphere. He now examined his equation, paying special attention to the
points at which both polynomials vanish. Using the classification by
Briot and Bouquet, based on Cauchy, of such singularities into nodes,
saddle points, foci, and centers, he was able to establish general
properties of the solutions that depended purely on the presence or the
absence of a specific type of singularity. For example, he established
that the traditional solution of the type T(x, y) = C (with T analytic
and C constant) occurs only if there are no nodes or foci. In the third
of the four papers containing this theory, Poincaré extended his
analysis to higher-degree equations of the form F(x, y, y′) = 0, F being
a polynomial. He approached such equations by considering the surface
defined by F(x, y, y′) = 0. Letting the genus of the surface be p, the
number of foci be F, of nodes N, and of saddle points S, Poincaré showed
that N + F − S = 2 − 2P. After exploring the ramifications of this and
of other results, Poincaré proceeded to the study of equations of higher
order. Though not able to establish as comprehensive a set of results as
he had for dimension two, he generalized the new technique using
hypersurfaces and firmed up relationships between the singularities and
the Betti number of the hypersurface.</p>
<p>Among many other results in the study of differential equations, we
cite only a few. One of his earliest pertains to linear equations and
the neighborhood of an irregular singularity; here he provided a
pathbreaking example of expanding solutions into asymptotic series. In
1884, he turned to the study of first-order differential equations with
fixed singularities in the complex domain. Émile Picard (1856–1941) used
this work in his study of second-order equations. Poincaré’s work here
is also at the basis of Paul Painlevé’s (1863–1933) profound
investigations of nonlinear second-order equations with or without
(movable) singularities. Poincaré’s subsequent work in ordinary and
partial differential equations related mostly to physical applications,
especially in celestial mechanics and the n-body problem.</p>
<p>Mathematical Physics And Other Applications</p>
<p>Poincaré did not stay in any field long enough to round out his work.
A contemporary said of him, “He was a conqueror, not a colonist.” In his
teaching at the Sorbonne, he would lecture on a different topic each
school year—capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, optics,
electricity, telegraphy, cosmogony, and others; the presentation was
such that in many cases, the lectures appeared in print shortly after
they had been delivered. In astronomy alone, he published half a dozen
volumes—Les méthodes nouvelles de la mécanique celeste (3 vols.,
1892–1899) and Leçons de mécanique céleste (3 vols., 1905–1910)—being in
this respect a worthy successor of Laplace. Especially important were
the methods he used to attack the three-body problem and its
generalizations. Also significant for cosmogony was a memoir of 1885, in
which he showed that a pear shape can be a figure of relative
equilibrium assumed by a homogeneous fluid subject to Newtonian
gravitation and rotating uniformly about an axis; the question of a
pear-shaped earth has continued to interest geodesists to our day. Sir
George H. Darwin (1845–1912), the son of Charles Darwin (1809–1882),
wrote in 1909 that Poincaré’s celestial mechanics would be a vast mine
for researchers for half a century; a century later, the mine has not
been exhausted.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Poincaré, like Laplace, also wrote extensively
on probability. In some respects, his work is only a natural
continuation of that of Laplace and the analysts of the nineteenth
century, but Poincaré was Janus-faced and to some extent anticipated the
great interest in topology that was to be so characteristic of the
twentieth century. Topology was not the invention of any one man. Some
topological problems are found in the work of Euler, Möbius, and Cantor,
and even the word “topology” had been used in 1847 by J. B. Listing
(1808–1882) in the title of a book, Vorstudien zur Topologie
(Introductory Studies in Topology). But as a date for the beginning of
the subject, none is more appropriate than 1895, the year in which
Poincaré published its first systematic development in his Analysis
situs.</p>
<p>Topology</p>
<p>Topology is now a broad and fundamental branch of mathematics, with
many aspects, but it can be subdivided into two fairly distinct
sub-branches: combinatorial topology and point-set topology. Poincaré
had little enthusiasm for the latter, and when, in 1908, he addressed
the International Mathematical Congress at Rome, he referred to Cantor’s
Mengenlehre as a disease from which later generations would regard
themselves as having recovered. Combinatorial topology, or analysis
situs, as it was then generally called, is the study of intrinsic
qualitative aspects of spatial configurations that remain invariant
under continuous one-to-one transformations. It is often referred to
popularly as “rubber-sheet geometry,” for deformations of, say, a
balloon, without puncturing or tearing it, are instances of topological
transformations. A circle, for example, is topologically equivalent to
an ellipse; the dimensionality of a space is a topological invariant, as
is also the Descartes-Euler number N0 − N1 + N2 for simple polyhedra.
Among Poincaré’s original contributions to topology was a generalization
of the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula for spaces of higher
dimensionality, making use of what he called “Betti numbers,” in honor
of Enrico Betti (1823–1892), who had taught at the University of Pisa
and had noted some of the properties of these topological invariants.
Most of topology, nevertheless, deals with qualitative, rather than
quantitative, aspects of mathematics, and, in this respect, it typifies
a sharp break from the styles prevailing in nineteenth-century analysis.
Poincaré’s attention seems to have been directed toward analysis situs
by attempts at qualitative integrations of differential equations.
Poincaré, like Riemann, was especially adept at handling problems of a
topological nature, such as finding out the properties of a function
without worrying about its formal representation in the classical sense;
both men were intuitionists with sound judgment.</p>
<p>Poincaré stated that practically every problem he touched led him to
analysis situs. We have seen an example in his attack on differential
equations. In the decade that overlapped the end of the nineteenth
century and the beginning of the twentieth, he published a series of
papers on the subject. These became the basis of twentieth-century
combinatorial, or algebraic, topology. Here he elaborated on the
concepts derived from Riemann and Betti that we encountered in his work
on differential equations: treating a figure as an n-dimensional
manifold and considering the order of connectedness. He set forth the
fundamental definitions and theorems of simplicial homology theory; he
established the relationship between the fundamental group of a manifold
and the first Betti number; he also pointed to further relationships
involving the Betti numbers. These papers contained theorems and
conjectures that led to many of the subsequent explorations of
twentieth-century topologists. We shall outline the story of one of
these in our last chapter.</p>
<p>Other Fields and Legacy</p>
<p>Of Poincaré’s many other contributions to mathematics, we only
mention additional work in function theory, including Abelian functions;
substantive work on Lie groups and related problems in algebra; and
influential nontechnical writings—some polemical—on mathematics and the
philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p>As an instance of Poincaré’s many-sidedness, it is to him that we owe
a suggestive model of Lobachevskian geometry within a Euclidean
framework. Suppose that a world is bounded by a large sphere of radius R
and the absolute temperature at a point within the sphere is R2 − r2,
where r is the distance from the center of the sphere; also suppose that
the index of refraction of the pellucid medium is inversely proportional
to R2 − r2. Moreover, assume that the dimensions of objects change from
point to point, being proportional to the temperature at any given
place. To inhabitants of such a world, the universe would appear to be
infinite, and rays of light, or “straight lines,” would not be
rectilinear but would be circles orthogonal to the limiting sphere and
would appear to be infinite. “Planes” would be spheres orthogonal to the
limiting sphere, and two such non-Euclidean “planes” would intersect in
a non-Euclidean “line.” The axioms of Euclid would hold, with the
exception of the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>In addition to his universality, the powerful new tools he developed,
and the results he obtained, Poincaré’s importance for the twentieth
century lies in the “unfinished” but very open nature of many of his
memoirs. An example is a famous paper he wrote on number theory.
Published in 1901, this dealt with the study of diophantine equations.
In the direction established twenty years earlier by Dedekind and Weber,
this subject was now approached through the birational theory of
algebraic curves. In other words, given a curve f(x, y) = 0 with
rational coefficients, one wishes to find points with rational
coordinates lying on the curve. Poincaré again examined the genus of the
curve, especially for the case p = 1. Utilizing a technique made popular
by Clebsch, he used elliptic functions for a parametric representation
of the curve and noted that the rational points on the Jacobian form a
subgroup; its rank is what he called the rank of the curve. This paper
has led to several important studies. A 1917 paper by Alexander Hurwitz
(1859–1919) was followed by one from Louis Joel Mordell (1888–1972) in
1922 in which he proved that the rank of the subgroup is finite. In
1928, André Weil (1906–1998) extended this result to arbitrary
p. Echoing Fermat, Mordell and Weil used a “method of infinite descent”
based on the bisection of the elliptic functions, which Poincaré may
have suggested in related trisections. The subsequent history of the
Mordell conjecture and other expansions of these ideas belong to
contemporary mathematics; we note the 1901 paper simply as an example of
the tremendously suggestive nature of Poincaré’s publications.</p>
<p>On the day Poincaré died, Paul Painlevé issued a brief tribute. He
ended it by stressing Poincaré’s intellectual sincerity. In particular,
he linked to this quality Poincaré’s willingness to issue partial
results when he felt there was no time or little chance that he could
bring a problem to a complete solution. As an example, Painlevé quoted
from Poincaré’s last publication, in which Poincaré had justified his
presenting partial results. After noting that there seemed little chance
he might take up the problem again in the future, Poincaré had
written:</p>
<p>The importance of the subject is too great and the collection of
results obtained too considerable already for me to resign myself to
leave them definitely barren. I can hope that geometers who will
interest themselves in this problem, and who will be undoubtedly more
fortunate than I, can turn this to good use and have it serve them to
find the direction they must take.</p>
<p>David Hilbert</p>
<p>David Hilbert (1862–1943), like Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), had been
born in Königsberg in East Prussia, but, unlike Kant, he traveled
widely, especially to attend the international congresses of
mathematicians that had become so characteristic of this century. Except
for a semester spent at the University of Heidelberg, where he studied
under the analyst Lazarus Fuchs (1833–1902), Hilbert obtained his
mathematical training at the University of Königsberg. The main
professor for mathematics there was Heinrich Weber (1842–1913), who had
been encouraged to turn to the study of abstract concepts in algebra and
number theory by Dedekind. Weber presented some of the first abstract
definitions for groups and fields in the 1880s and 1890s and was the
author of a well-known and influential three-volume textbook of algebra
and the coauthor, with Dedekind, of the important paper on algebraic
functions mentioned in chapter 23. In 1883, Weber left Königsberg. His
successor, F. Lindemann, had just published his proof of the
transcendence of π. Lindemann suggested to Hilbert his doctoral thesis
topic in invariant theory and encouraged Hilbert’s early work in this
field. Hilbert’s interest in invariants was further stimulated by two
men closer to his own age, of whom he saw a great deal in the 1880s.
They were Adolf Hurwitz, who had studied with Felix Klein and joined
Lindemann on the Königsberg faculty in 1884, and Hermann Minkowski
(1864–1909), who, although still a student, in April 1893 won the “Grand
Prix des Sciences Mathématiques” awarded by the Paris Academy of
Sciences for his essay on the decomposition of integers into the sum of
five squares. Hurwitz’s early work dealt with number-theoretic and
geometric questions. Most of the research he did in Königsberg applied
Riemannian function-theoretic methods to problems in algebra,
specifically to algebraic functions. In 1892, he left Königsberg for
Zurich, where he spent the rest of his life, making important
contributions to the theory of algebraic numbers and number fields.
Minkowski obtained his doctorate in July 1885, a few months after
Hilbert. His thesis dealt with investigations of quadratic forms using
methods introduced by Dirichlet. Hilbert was the “opponent” in debating
the thesis with Minkowski at the latter’s public promotion. As will be
seen, Minkowski and Hilbert remained close friends.</p>
<p>Invariant Theory</p>
<p>Hilbert worked predominantly in invariant theory until 1892; his most
important contributions to that subject were published in 1890 and 1893.
To understand their place in the history of invariant theory, it is
useful to follow Hilbert’s own account of that theory, which he prepared
for the International Mathematical Congress in Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>For three decades after Boole, Cayley, and Sylvester’s early work on
invariant theory, much time was spent on computing specific invariants.
Aside from the English mathematicians previously mentioned, leading
contributors to this activity were Clebsch and Siegfried Heinrich
Aronhold (1819–1884), who discovered invariants for ternary cubic forms
and established a “symbolic” method for computing. To systematize this
work, it was proposed to find a complete system, or basis, of
invariants; that is, given a form of x of degree n, to find the smallest
number of rational integral invariants and covariants so that any other
rational integral invariant or covariant could be expressed as a
rational integral form with numerical coefficients of the complete set.
Paul Gordan (1837–1912), a professor of mathematics at the University of
Erlangen, proved the existence of a finite complete set for binary
forms. He showed that every binary form has a finite complete system of
invariants and covariants and that any finite system of binary forms has
such a system. Gordan’s proof was cumbersome but showed how the complete
system could be computed; in 1886, Franz Mertens (1840–1927) provided a
more streamlined inductive proof, which did not exhibit the system.
Hilbert’s famous result of 1888, known as his “basis theorem,” was far
more general. It was published as theorem I of a paper “On the Theory of
Algebraic Forms” in the Mathematische Annalen in 1890. As was customary,
Hilbert defined an algebraic form as an integral rational homogeneous
function in certain variables whose coefficients are numbers in a
certain “domain of rationality.” The theorem states that for any
infinite sequence S = F1, F2, F3, . . . of forms in n variables x1, x2,
. . . , xn, there exists a number m such that any form of that sequence
can be expressed as</p>
<p>where the Ai are forms in the same n variables. Hilbert applied this
result to the proof for the existence of a finite full system of
invariants for systems of forms in arbitrarily many variables. In a
subsequent influential paper, published in 1893, “On a Full System of
Invariants,” Hilbert developed his new methods for attacking problems in
invariant theory. He stressed that his approach was fundamentally
different from that of his predecessors because he treated the theory of
algebraic invariants as part of the general theory of algebraic function
fields.</p>
<p>“Zahlbericht”</p>
<p>The three-year period 1892–1895 brought major changes in Hilbert’s
life. He had begun his academic career as a privatdozent in Königsberg
in 1886, having spent the year after his doctorate on a study trip, part
of the time in Leipzig to visit Felix Klein and part in Paris to meet
Charles Hermite. In 1892, he became Hurwitz’s successor as an associate
(“extraordinary”) professor in Königsberg; he married the same year.
Already the next year, on Lindemann’s departure for Munich, Hilbert was
made a full (“ordinary”) professor. Yet, he stayed in Königsberg only
until 1895, for in that year Heinrich Weber, who had left Königsberg for
Göttingen twelve years earlier, now followed a call to Strassburg. Felix
Klein arranged to have Hilbert succeed Weber at Göttingen, and since
then, his name has been linked with that center of mathematical
activity, where he resided for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>At the 1893 meeting of the German Mathematical Society, Hilbert and
Minkowski were asked to write a report on number theory for the
Jahresbericht of that organization. The resulting work by Hilbert on
“The Theory of Algebraic Number Fields” became a classic; it is commonly
referred to as the “Zahlbericht.” Minkowski, who was working on his
Geometry of Numbers at that time, withdrew from the project, although he
provided Hilbert with crucial comments on his manuscript, as he did with
most of Hilbert’s manuscripts up to his untimely death in 1909.</p>
<p>In the introduction to his “Zahlbericht,” Hilbert expressed a point
of view that was to become typical of his work and his influence. It is
characterized by emphasis on the abstraction, arithmetization, and
logical development of mathematical concepts and theories. Noting that
while number theory has the fewest prerequisites necessary for an
understanding of its truths, it had been blamed for requiring a high
degree of abstraction to fully master arithmetic concepts and proof
techniques, Hilbert expressed the opinion that all other branches of
mathematics require at least an equally high degree of abstraction,
provided one subjects the foundation of these branches to the same
rigorous and complete study that is necessary. Next, he stressed the
interrelationship between number theory and algebra, as well as between
number theory and function theory, that had become apparent during the
nineteenth century. He saw the development in mathematics taking place
in his lifetime as being guided by number. According to Hilbert,
Dedekind and Weierstrass’s definition of arithmetic fundamental concepts
and Cantor’s work led to an “arithmetization of function theory,” while
modern investigations on non-Euclidean geometry, with their concern for
a rigorous logical development and a clear introduction of the number
concept, led to an “arithmetization of geometry.” In the body of the
report, Hilbert attempted to present a logical theory of algebraic
number fields. He joined in his comprehensive treatment the work of his
immediate predecessors and contemporaries and also included his own
results. Hilbert contributed a few more papers to this subject in the
1890s; these are his most mature efforts in the direction of obtaining a
generalized law of quadratic reciprocity over a variety of number
fields. With one notable exception, Hilbert produced no more new results
in number theory after the turn of the century, but until World War I,
he continued to supervise doctoral dissertations on number theory,
including those of R. Fueter (1880–1950) and E. Hecke (1887–1947).</p>
<p>The Foundations of Geometry</p>
<p>Hilbert, whose work tended to concentrate on one subject at a time,
turned to geometry after completion of the “Zahlbericht.” In 1894, he
had lectured on non-Euclidean geometry, and in 1898–1899, he presented a
small but celebrated volume titled Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations
of Geometry). This work, translated into numerous languages, exerted a
strong influence on the mathematics of the twentieth century. Through
the arithmetization of analysis and the axioms of Peano, most of
mathematics, except for geometry, had achieved a strict axiomatic
foundation. Geometry in the nineteenth century had flourished as never
before, but it was chiefly in Hilbert’s Grundlagen that an effort was
first made to give it the purely formal character found in algebra and
analysis. Euclid’s Elements did have a deductive structure, but it was
replete with concealed assumptions, meaningless definitions, and logical
inadequacies. Hilbert understood that not all terms in mathematics can
be defined and therefore began his treatment of geometry with three
undefined objects—point, line, and plane—and six undefined relations:
being on, being in, being between, being congruent, being parallel, and
being continuous. In place of Euclid’s five axioms (or common notions)
and five postulates, Hilbert formulated for his geometry a set of
twenty-one assumptions, since known as Hilbert’s axioms. Eight of these
concern incidence and include Euclid’s first postulate, four are on
order properties, five are on congruency, three are on continuity
(assumptions not explicitly mentioned by Euclid), and one is a parallel
postulate that is essentially equivalent to Euclid’s fifth postulate.
Following the pioneer work by Hilbert, alternative sets of axioms have
been proposed by others, and the purely formal and deductive character
of geometry, as well as of other branches of mathematics, has been
thoroughly established since the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Hilbert, through his Grundlagen, became the leading exponent of an
“axiomatic school” of thought that has been influential in fashioning
contemporary attitudes in mathematics and mathematical education. The
Grundlagen opened with a motto taken from Kant: “All human knowledge
begins with intuitions, proceeds to concepts, and terminates in ideas,”
but Hilbert’s development of geometry established a decidedly
anti-Kantian view of the subject. It emphasized that the undefined terms
in geometry should not be assumed to have any properties beyond those
indicated in the axioms. The intuitive-empirical level of the older
geometric views must be disregarded, and points, lines, and planes are
to be understood merely as elements of certain given sets. Set theory,
having taken over algebra and analysis, now was invading geometry.
Similarly, the undefined relations are to be treated as abstractions
indicating nothing more than a correspondence or a mapping.</p>
<p>Like the major papers on algebra and number theory discussed
previously, Hilbert’s research on the elements of geometry was partly
instigated by one of the mathematical meetings of the 1890s that he
attended. In 1891, he had heard and been captivated by a talk that H.
Wiener gave at a scientific meeting in Halle on the possibility of
axiomatizing the rules governing the unions and the intersections of
points and lines without regard to the existing (Euclidean) axioms of
geometry. Following this talk, Hilbert is reputed to have stated the
need for the abstraction of familiar geometric concepts in the form:
“One must at all times be able to replace ‘points, lines, planes’ by
‘tables, chairs, beer mugs.’”</p>
<p>The “Hilbert Problems”</p>
<p>Perhaps no contribution to an international congress has been as
celebrated as the one that Hilbert made in his address to the second
congress, held in Paris in 1900. Hilbert’s talk was titled “Mathematical
Problems.” It consisted of an introduction that has become a classic of
mathematical rhetoric, followed by a list of twenty-three problems
designed to serve as examples of the kind of problem whose treatment
should lead to a furthering of the discipline. In fact, on the advice of
Hurwitz and Minkowski, Hilbert cut the spoken version of the talk so
that it contained only ten of the twenty-three problems. Yet the
complete version of the talk, as well as excerpts, were soon translated
and published in several countries. For example, the 1902 volume of the
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society carried an authorized
translation by Mary Winston Newson (1869–1959), a specialist in partial
differential equations, who had been the first American woman to obtain
a Ph.D. degree in mathematics at Göttingen. Although Hilbert objected to
the view that the concepts of arithmetic alone are susceptible of a
fully rigorous treatment, he admitted that the development of the
arithmetic continuum by Cauchy, Bolzano, and Cantor was one of the two
most notable achievements of the nineteenth century—the other being the
non-Euclidean geometry of Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky—and thus the
first of the twenty-three problems concerned the structure of the real
number continuum. The question is made up of two related parts: (1) is
there a transfinite number between that of a denumerable set and the
number of the continuum; and (2) can the numerical continuum be
considered a well-ordered set? The second part asks whether the totality
of all real numbers can be arranged in another manner so that every
partial assemblage will have a first element. This is closely related to
the axiom of choice named for the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo
(1871–1956), who formulated it in 1904. Zermelo’s axiom asserts that
given any set of mutually exclusive nonempty sets, there exists at least
one set that contains one and only one element in common with each of
the nonempty sets. As an illustration of a problem involving Zermelo’s
axiom, consider the set of all real numbers n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 1; let
us call two of these real numbers equivalent if their difference is
rational. There obviously are infinitely many classes of equivalent real
numbers. If we form a set S made up of one number from each of these
classes, is S denumerable or nondenumerable? The axiom of choice,
indispensable in analysis, was in 1940 proved by Kurt Gödel (1906–1978)
to be consistent with other axioms of set theory, but in 1963, it was
demonstrated by Paul Cohen (1934–2007) that the axiom of choice is
independent of the other axioms in a certain system of set theory, thus
showing that the axiom cannot be proved within this system. This seems
to preclude a clear-cut solution to Hilbert’s first problem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s second problem, also suggested by the nineteenth-century
age of rigor, involved the question whether it can be proved that the
axioms of arithmetic are consistent—that a finite number of logical
steps based on them can never lead to contradictory results. A decade
later, there appeared the first volume of Principia mathematica (3
vols., 1910–1913), by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead
(1861–1947), the most elaborate attempt up to that time to develop the
fundamental notions of arithmetic from a precise set of axioms. This
work, in the tradition of Leibniz, Boole, and Frege and based on Peano’s
axioms, carried out in minute detail a program intended to prove that
all of pure mathematics can be derived from a small number of
fundamental logical principles. This would justify the view of Russell,
expressed earlier, that mathematics is indistinguishable from logic. But
the system of Russell and Whitehead, not entirely formalized, seems to
have met with more approval among logicians than among mathematicians.
Moreover, the Principia left unanswered the second query of Hilbert.
Efforts to solve this problem led in 1931 to a surprising conclusion on
the part of the young Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel. Gödel showed
that within a rigidly logical system such as Russell and Whitehead had
developed for arithmetic, propositions can be formulated that are
undecidable or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system. That is,
within the system there exist certain clear-cut statements that can be
neither proved nor disproved. Hence, one cannot, using the usual
methods, be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not lead to
contradictions. In a sense, Gödel’s theorem, sometimes regarded as the
most decisive result in mathematical logic, seems to dispose negatively
of Hilbert’s second query. In its implications, the discovery by Gödel
of undecidable propositions is as disturbing as was the disclosure by
Hippasus of incommensurable magnitudes, for it appears to foredoom hope
of mathematical certitude through use of the obvious methods. Perhaps
also doomed, as a result, is the ideal of science—to devise a set of
axioms from which all phenomena of the natural world can be deduced.
Nevertheless, mathematicians and scientists alike have taken the blow in
stride and have continued to pile theorem on theorem at a rate greater
than ever before. Most assuredly, no scholar of today would echo the
assertion of Babbage in 1813 that “The golden age of mathematical
literature is undoubtedly past.”</p>
<p>The problems raised by Gödel’s theorem have been approached from
outside arithmetic itself through a new aspect of mathematical logic
that arose toward the middle of the twentieth century and is known as
metamathematics. This is not concerned with the symbolism and the
operations of arithmetic but with the interpretation of these signs and
rules. If arithmetic cannot lift itself from the quagmire of possible
inconsistency, perhaps metamathematics, standing outside the arithmetic
bog, can save the day by other means—such as transfinite induction. Some
mathematicians would at least hope for a means of determining, for every
mathematical proposition, whether it is true, false, or undecidable. In
any case, even the discouragingly negative answer to Hilbert’s second
query has thus spurred, rather than daunted, mathematical
creativity.</p>
<p>The next three problems, problems three, four, and five, were among
those omitted at the actual reading of the paper. Problem three was
geometric; it asks to give two tetrahedra of equal basis and equal
height that cannot be decomposed into congruent tetrahedra, either
directly or by adjoining congruent tetrahedra. As Hilbert noted, this
problem goes back to a question raised by Gauss in his correspondence. A
negative answer was provided by a student of Hilbert’s, Max Dehn
(1878–1952), in 1902, and clarified by W. F. Kagan in 1903.</p>
<p>Problem four was formulated somewhat broadly; it asked for geometries
whose axioms are “closest” to those of Euclidean geometry if the axioms
of order and incidence are retained, but the congruence axioms are
weakened and the equivalent of the parallel axiom is omitted. The
earliest answer was provided in a doctoral dissertation by G. Hamel,
another Hilbert student.</p>
<p>The fifth problem was to prove more influential and difficult. It
asked whether one could avoid the assumption of differentiability for
the functions defining a continuous transformation group. This problem
came to be closely tied to the early history of topological groups.
Lie’s continuous transformation groups were locally Euclidean with
differentiable operations. As the concept of a topological group was
made the subject of special studies, first by L. E. J. Brouwer
(1882–1966), then by Lev Semenovich Pontryagin (1908–1988), the Hilbert
problem was reformulated to apply to the larger realm of topological
groups: Is a locally Euclidean topological group a Lie group? The
problem and related issues occupied numerous topologists until the
1950s. In the 1930s, John von Neumann solved it for bicompact groups;
Pontryagin, for commutative locally bicompact groups. C. Chevalley
(1909–1984) obtained the answer for solvable groups; in 1946, Anatoly
Ivanovich Malcev (1909–1967) solved it for a still wider set of locally
bicompact groups. By now, the problem had become truly international. In
1952, three Americans, Andrew Gleason (1921–2008), Deane Montgomery
(1909–1992), and Leo Zippin (1905–1995), finally obtained the answer for
all locally bicompact groups.</p>
<p>The sixth problem asked for an axiomatization of physics, a subject
to which Hilbert himself devoted some effort.</p>
<p>Problem seven inquired whether the number αβ, where α is algebraic
(and not zero or 1) and β is irrational and algebraic, is
transcendental. In alternative geometric form, Hilbert expressed this by
asking whether in an isosceles triangle, the ratio of the base to a side
is transcendental if the ratio of the vertex angle to the base angles is
algebraic and irrational. This question was disposed of in 1934 when
Aleksander Osipovich Gelfond (1906–1968) proved that Hilbert’s
conjecture, now known as Gelfond’s theorem, was indeed correct—αβ is
transcendental if α is algebraic and neither zero nor 1, and β is
algebraic and not rational. Later, Alan Baker provided a major
generalization to the Gelfond theorem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s eighth query simply renewed the call, familiar since the
nineteenth century, for a proof of Riemann’s conjecture that the zeros
of the zeta function, except for the negative-integral zeros, all have
real part equal to one half. A proof of this, he felt, might lead to a
proof of the familiar conjecture on the infinity of prime pairs, but no
demonstration has yet been given, although it is more than a century
since Riemann hazarded the guess.</p>
<p>These examples may suffice to indicate the diversity of formulation
and interest of the problems Hilbert chose; let us simply list the
nature of the remaining, which include some of the most intriguing and
have involved a large number of twentieth-century mathematicians.</p>
<p>The ninth problem called for generalizations of the reciprocity laws
of number theory. The tenth was the decision problem for solvability of
Diophantine equations. The eleventh called for extending results
obtained for quadratic fields to arbitrary algebraic fields. The twelfth
asked for an extension of a theorem by Kronecker to arbitrary algebraic
fields.</p>
<p>These number-theoretic problems were followed by the thirteenth,
which asked to show the impossibility of solving the general
seventh-degree equation by functions of two variables; the fourteenth
problem asked about the finiteness of systems of relatively integral
functions; the fifteenth asked for a justification for Hermann
Schubert’s (1848–1911) enumerative geometry.</p>
<p>The sixteenth problem was an invitation to develop a topology of real
algebraic curves and surfaces. The seventeenth asked for the
representation of definite forms by squares; the eighteenth posed the
challenge to build spaces with congruent polyhedra. The nineteenth deals
with the analytic character of solutions of variational problems.
Closely related to this was the twentieth, concerned with general
boundary problems. The twenty-first, which Hilbert himself solved in
1905, asked for the solution of differential equations with a given
monodromy group. The twenty-second was the uniformization problem, and
the final, twenty-third, problem asked for an extension of the methods
of the calculus of variations; in recent years, this has been tied to
research in optimization questions.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>Hilbert’s chief contributions to analysis fall in the period between
1900 and World War I. They revolve primarily around the study of
integral equations. His contributions to this subject were preceded,
however, by his “revival” of the Dirichlet principle. As previously
noted, the criticism of the Dirichlet principle had been followed by
only partially successful attempts to show its validity. The last major
effort in this direction had been published by Poincaré in 1890, in a
paper containing his ingenious “sweeping-out” (balayage) method. Hilbert
proceeded to establish the Dirichlet principle in its most general form
by treating it as a problem in the calculus of variations. First, he
sketched a constructive proof of the existence of minimal curves; then
he showed how the existence of a function minimizing the Dirichlet
region for plane regions could be inferred. This memoir was followed by
a very readable Weierstrassian review of the problem by the American W.
F. Osgood (1864–1943) the following year; in 1904, Hilbert himself
elaborated on his argument in a more detailed paper.</p>
<p>It was during this period, in 1901, that the subject of integral
equations captured Hilbert’s attention. One of his Scandinavian students
presented a seminar report on work done in that field by his professor
in Stockholm, Ivar Fredholm (1866–1927). Hilbert’s results, first
published between 1904 and 1910, were collected in a book that appeared
in 1912 and was designed to present a systematic theory of linear
integral equations. His work was streamlined by Erhard Schmidt
(1876–1959). What is interesting in following Hilbert’s progress of the
subject is the interplay between his often rough new approaches and
refinements and generalizations brought to bear by others. Indeed, the
great value of this work nowadays lies in the fact that from it came
many of the twentieth century’s most important ideas basic to the study
of abstract linear spaces and spectra.</p>
<p>Waring’s Problem and Hilbert’s Work after 1909</p>
<p>Perhaps as relief from his rather cumbersome work in integral
equations, Hilbert during this time returned to number theory and proved
Waring’s theorem that every positive integer can be represented as a sum
of at most m nth powers, m being a function of n. This triumph, tempered
by the unexpected death of his good friend Minkowski in 1909, marks the
end of the period during which Hilbert produced his most concentrated,
purely mathematical work.</p>
<p>Hilbert spent much of the next decade on mathematical physics. Until
the beginning of World War I, he studied the application of integral
equations to physical theories such as the kinetic theory of gases. With
the appearance of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity,
Hilbert turned to that subject, which also occupied his colleague Felix
Klein. Interestingly, the most lasting mathematical contribution out of
this effort came from an algebraist who had recently engaged in studies
of differential invariants. This was Emmy Noether (1888–1935), the
daughter of the algebraic geometer Max Noether, whom Hilbert and Klein
brought to Göttingen to assist them in this research. Her results were
published in 1918; best known is “Noether’s theorem,” which is still
referred to in the discussion of correspondences between certain
invariants and conservation laws.</p>
<p>Hilbert had initiated his studies in mathematical physics in the hope
of proceeding to the axiomatization for which he had called in 1900. He
came closest to this goal in his last work on physics, dealing with
quantum mechanics. Because Hilbert had begun to have serious health
problems by this time, this research was conducted in collaboration with
two younger men, L. Nordheim and J. von Neumann.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s major results in his last great effort at the
axiomatization of arithmetic and logic have come to us in the form given
to them by his successors, too. They are contained in the comprehensive
treatises Grundlagen der Mathematik and Grundzüge der mathematischen
Logik, better known by the names of the coauthors as Hilbert-Bernays and
Hilbert-Ackermann.</p>
<p>Integration and Measure</p>
<p>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis on rigor had
led numerous mathematicians to bring forth examples of “pathological”
functions that, because of some unusual property, violated a theorem
previously held to be generally valid. There was concern among some
distinguished analysts that a preoccupation with such special cases
would divert younger mathematicians from seeking answers to the major
open questions of the day. Hermite said that he turned away “with fright
and horror from this lamentable plague of functions which have no
derivatives.” Poincaré shared his teacher’s concern:</p>
<p>Formerly, when one invented a new function it was in view of some
practical goal; today one invents them expressly to point out flaws in
the reasoning of our fathers and one will never derive anything from
them but that. (Translated from a quotation in Saks, 1964)</p>
<p>Yet through the study of unusual cases and the questioning of their
elders, two younger French mathematicians arrived at the definitions of
concepts that were to be fundamental to the development of some of the
most general theories of twentieth-century mathematics. Henri Lebesgue
(1875–1941) had had the usual type of mathematical training, although he
had shown exceptional irreverence in questioning statements made by his
professors and supplemented his course work with library studies,
including the work of Camille Jordan (1838–1922) and René Baire
(1874–1934), among others. His dissertation, accepted in 1902, was most
unusual in virtually remaking the field of integration. His work was so
great a departure from accepted views that Lebesgue, like Cantor, at
first was assailed by both external criticism and internal self-doubt,
but the value of his views was increasingly recognized, and in 1910, he
was appointed to the Sorbonne. He did not create a “school of thought,”
however, nor did he concentrate on the field that he had opened.
Although his concept of the integral was in itself a striking case of
generalization, Lebesgue feared that “Reduced to general theories,
mathematics would be a beautiful form without content. It would quickly
die.” Later developments seem to indicate that his fears concerning the
baneful influence of generality in mathematics were without
foundation.</p>
<p>The Riemann integral had dominated studies in integration before
Lebesgue became the “Archimedes of the extension period.” But toward the
close of the nineteenth century, studies in trigonometric series and the
Mengenlehre of Cantor had made mathematicians more keenly aware that the
essential idea in functionality should be a pointwise correspondence or
“mapping” in the newer sense and not smoothness of variation. Cantor had
even struggled with notions of measurable sets, but under his
definition, the measure of the union of two sets could be less than the
sum of the measures of the sets. Defects in Cantor’s definition were
removed by Émile Borel (1871–1956), the immediate predecessor of
Lebesgue in studies on measure theory.</p>
<p>Borel, from 1909 until 1941 the holder of a chair for theory of
functions at the Sorbonne and, from 1921, a chair in probability and
mathematical physics, was also a multifaceted administrator. He
succeeded Jules Tannery as deputy director of the École Normale
Supérieure, a position he held for ten years; in the 1920s, he founded
the Institute for Statistics at the University of Paris and, in 1929,
the Institut Henri Poincaré. Having served in the military and run a
government office during World War I at the request of Painlevé, he
returned to public service as member of the Chamber of Deputies from
1925 to 1936, championed the European Union, and served as minister of
the navy until his arrest in 1940 under the Vichy regime. His record in
mathematical publication before 1924 had been impressive and included
more than half a dozen books. One of the earlier volumes had been on an
unusual theme: Leçons sur les séries divergentes (1901). Here, the
author showed how for some divergent series, a “sum” can be defined that
will make sense in relationships and operations involving such series.
For example, if the series is , then a “sum” can be defined as if this
integral exists. During the first decades of this century, there was
lively interest in such definitions, but Borel’s more lasting influence
was in the application of the theory of sets to the theory of functions,
where his name is recalled in the familiar Heine-Borel theorem:</p>
<p>If a closed set of points on a line can be covered by a set of
intervals so that every point of the set is an interior point of at
least one of the intervals, then there exists a finite number of
intervals with this covering property.</p>
<p>In somewhat different terminology, this theorem had been expressed by
Heine in 1872, but it had been overlooked until reenunciated in 1895 by
Borel. Borel’s name is also attached to any set that can be obtained
from closed and open sets on the real line by repeated applications of
the operations of union and intersection to denumerable numbers of sets.
Any Borel set is a measurable set in his sense.</p>
<p>Lebesgue, pondering Borel’s work on sets, saw that Riemann’s
definition of the integral has the drawback of applying only in
exceptional cases, for it assumes not more than a few points of
discontinuity in the function. If a function y = f(x) has many points of
discontinuity, then, as the interval xi+ 1 − xi becomes smaller, values
of f(xi+ 1) and f(xi) do not necessarily become closer together. Instead
of subdividing the domain of the independent variable, Lebesgue
therefore subdivided the range of the function into subintervals Δyi and
within each subinterval selected a value ηi. Then, he found the
“measure” m(Ei) of the set Ei of points on the x-axis for which values
of f(x) are approximately equal to ηi. As Lebesgue liked to express the
difference informally, the earlier integrators had added indivisibles,
large or small, in order from left to right, whereas he preferred to
group together indivisibles of comparable size before adding. That is,
for the earlier Riemann sums he substituted the Lebesgue-type sum Sn = η
im(Ei) and then let the intervals tend toward zero.</p>
<p>The Lebesgue integral that we have here very roughly described is in
actuality defined far more precisely in terms of upper and lower bounds
and the Lebesgue measure of a set; an illustrative example may suggest
how the Lebesgue procedures operate. Let it be granted that the Lebesgue
measure of all rational numbers in the interval [0,1] is zero and that
the Lebesgue measure of all irrational numbers in this interval is 1;
let the integral of f(x) be required over this interval, where f(x) is
zero for all rational values of x and f(x) is 1 for all irrational
values of x. Inasmuch as m(Ei) = 0 for all values of i except i = n,
where ηn = 1, we have Sn = 0 + 0 + . . . η + nm(En) = 1 · 1 = 1; hence,
the Lebesgue integral is 1. The Riemann integral of the same function
over the same interval does not, of course, exist.</p>
<p>The word “measure” can take on various meanings. When Lebesgue
presented his new concept of the integral, he used the word in the
specific sense now known as the Lebesgue measure. This was an extension
of classical notions of length and area to sets more general than those
associated with the usual curves and surfaces. Today the word “measure”
is used more broadly still, a measure on a field R being simply a
nonnegative function μ with the property μ(UAi) = Σμ(Ai) for every
countable disjoint class Ai contained in R. Not only does the new
concept of integral cover a wider class of functions than does that of
Riemann, but the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration (in Lebesgue’s generalized sense) is subject to fewer
exceptions. For example, if g(x) is differentiable in [a, b] and if g′
(x) = f(x) is bounded, then f(x) is Lebesgue integrable and , whereas
with the same restrictions on g(x) and g′(x) the Riemann integral might
not even exist.</p>
<p>Lebesgue’s ideas date from the closing years of the nineteenth
century, but they became widely known through his two classic treatises:
Leçons sur les series trigonométriques (1903) and Leçons sur
l’intégration et la recherche des fonctions primitives (1904). The
revolutionary views they contained paved the way for further
generalizations. Among these are the Denjoy integral and the Haar
integral, proposed by a Frenchman, Arnaud Denjoy (1884–1974), and a
Hungarian, Alfred Haar (1885–1933), respectively. Another well-known
integral of the twentieth century is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, a
combination of the ideas of Lebesgue and the Dutch analyst T.-J.
Stieltjes (1856–1894). The work of these men and others so altered the
concept of the integral, through generalization, that it has been said
that although integration is as old as the time of Archimedes, “the
theory of integration was a creation of the twentieth century.” Word of
the new theory spread. For example, N. N. Luzin (1883–1950), who had
spent most of his time during the years 1910–1914 in Göttingen,
introduced many of the new ideas to Moscow on his return.</p>
<p>Functional Analysis and General Topology</p>
<p>The new theories of integration were closely allied with another
pronounced characteristic of the twentieth century: the rapid growth of
point set topology. At the University of Paris, Maurice Fréchet
(1878–1973), in his doctoral dissertation of 1906, showed clearly that
function theory no longer could do without a very general view of set
theory. What Fréchet had in mind were not necessarily sets of numbers
but sets of elements of arbitrary nature, such as curves or points; on
such arbitrary sets, he built a “functional calculus,” in which a
functional operation is defined on a set E when to each element A of E
there corresponds a numerically determined value U(A). His interest was
not in a particular instance of a set E, but in those set-theoretical
results that are independent of the nature of the set elements. In this
very broad calculus, the notion of limit is much broader than limits as
previously defined, the latter being included in the former as special
cases, just as the Lebesgue integral includes the integrals of Riemann
and Cauchy. Probably no aspect of twentieth-century mathematics stands
out more clearly than does the ever-greater degree of generalization and
abstraction. From the time of Hilbert and Fréchet, the notions of
abstract set and abstract space have been fundamental in research.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Hilbert and Fréchet came to their
generalizations of the concept of space from somewhat differing
directions. Hilbert had become interested, as had Poincaré, in the study
of integral equations, especially through the work of Ivar Fredholm
(1866–1927). In a sense, an integral equation can be considered an
extension of a system of n equations in n unknowns to a system of
infinitely many equations in infinitely many unknowns, a topic that had
been touched on, in the form of infinite determinants, by Helge von Koch
(1870–1924). As Hilbert worked in integral equations from 1904 to 1910,
he did not explicitly refer to infinite dimensional spaces, but he did
develop the concept of continuity of a function of infinitely many
variables. To what extent Hilbert formally constructed the “space” that
later was named for him may be a moot point, but the basic ideas were
there, and their impact on the mathematical world was great. His work on
integral equations was soon extended to more general functions and
abstract spaces by Friedrich Riesz (1880–1956) and Ernst Fischer
(1875–1959).</p>
<p>During the years that Hilbert was concerned with integral equations,
Jacques Hadamard was doing research in the calculus of variations, and
his student Fréchet consciously sought in 1906 to generalize the methods
in this field through what he called functional calculus. Whereas the
ordinary calculus deals with functions, the functional calculus concerns
functionals. Whereas a function is a correspondence between a set S1 of
numbers and another set S2 of numbers, a functional is a correspondence
between a class C1 of functions and another class C2 of functions.
Fréchet formulated generalized definitions, corresponding roughly to
terms such as “limit,” “derivative,” and “continuity” in the ordinary
calculus, applicable to the function spaces he thus created, to a
considerable extent introducing a new vocabulary for the new situation.
Shortly thereafter, this would intrigue the group of young Russians
about to put their own stamp on the evolving subject of topology; that
includes the Luzin students P. S. Aleksandrov (1896–1982), Pavel Uryson
(1898–1924), and A. N. Kolmogorov (1903–1987).</p>
<p>Topology is said by some to have begun with the analysis situs of
Poincaré; others claim that it dates from the set theory of Cantor or
perhaps from the development of abstract spaces. Still others regard
Brouwer as the founder of topology, especially for his topological
invariance theorems of 1911 and for his fusion of the methods of Cantor
with those of analysis situs. At all events, with Brouwer there began
the period of intensive evolution of topology that has continued to the
present day. During this “golden age” of topology, American
mathematicians have been conspicuous contributors. It has been said that
“topology began as much geometry and little algebra, but that now it is
much algebra and little geometry.” Whereas once topology could be
described as geometry without measurement, algebraic topology came to
dominate the field, a change that resulted largely from leadership in
the United States.</p>
<p>Hermann Weyl (1885–1955), lecturing on Riemann surfaces at Göttingen,
also emphasized the abstract nature of a surface, or a “two-dimensional
manifold,” as he preferred to call it. The concept of a manifold, he
asserted, should not be tied to a point space (in the usual geometric
sense) but given broader meaning. We merely begin with a collection of
things called “points” (which can be any objects whatsoever) and
introduce a concept of continuity through appropriate definition. The
classical formulation of this view was given a year later by Felix
Hausdorff (1868–1942), the “high priest” of point set topology.</p>
<p>The first portion of Hausdorff’s Grundzüge der Mengenlehre (Basic
Features of Set Theory) of 1914 is a systematic exposition of the
characteristic features of set theory, where the nature of elements is
of no consequence; only the relations among the elements are important.
In the latter portion of the book, we find a clear-cut development of
“Hausdorff topological spaces” from a set of axioms. By a topological
space, the author understands a set E of elements x and certain subsets
Sx known as neighborhoods of x. The neighborhoods are assumed to satisfy
the following four “Hausdorff axioms”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To each point x there corresponds at least one neighborhood U(x),
and each neighborhood U(x) contains the point x.</p></li>
<li><p>If U(x) and V(x) are two neighborhoods of the same point x, there
must exist a neighborhood W(x) that is a subset of both.</p></li>
<li><p>If the point y lies in U(x), there must exist a neighborhood
U/(y) that is a subset of U(x).</p></li>
<li><p>For two different points x and y, there are two neighborhoods
U(x) and U(y) with no points in common.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Neighborhoods, as so defined, permitted Hausdorff to introduce the
concept of continuity. Through additional axioms, he developed the
properties of various more restricted spaces, such as the Euclidean
plane.</p>
<p>If any one book marks the emergence of point set topology as a
separate discipline, it is Hausdorff’s Grundzüge. It is interesting to
note that although it was the arithmetization of analysis that began the
train of thought that led from Cantor to Hausdorff, in the end the
concept of number is thoroughly submerged under a far more general point
of view. Moreover, although the word “point” is used in the title, the
new subject had as little to do with the points of ordinary geometry as
with the numbers of common arithmetic. This was underlined by Zygmunt
Janiszewski (1888–1920), Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1888–1945), and the
indefatigable Waclaw Sierpinski (1882–1969), the founders, in 1920, of
Fundamenta Mathematicae. When the journal that seemed at times to carry
nothing but contributions to point set topology was resurrected after
World War II, the cover noted that it was devoted to set theory,
mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics, topology and its
interactions with algebra, and dynamical systems. Here and elsewhere,
topology came to the fore in the twentieth century as one of the
subjects that appeared to unify almost the whole of mathematics,
providing it with an unexpected cohesiveness.</p>
<p>Algebra</p>
<p>The high degree of formal abstraction that had found its way into
analysis, geometry, and topology in the early twentieth century could
not help but invade algebra. The result was a new type of algebra,
sometimes inadequately described as “modern algebra,” largely a product
of the third decade of the century. It is indeed true that a gradual
process of generalization in algebra had developed during the nineteenth
century, but in the twentieth century, the degree of abstraction took a
sharp turn upward. For example, in 1903, the American Leonard Eugene
Dickson (1874–1954), E. H. Moore’s first student, published an axiomatic
definition of a linear associative algebra over an abstract field. Next,
Dickson, J. H. M. Wedderburn (1882–1948), who spent the year 1904–1905
in Chicago, and others published a series of papers dealing with various
aspects of hypercomplex number systems and finite algebras. The best
known of these is one by Wedderburn, in which he abstracted his subject
from dependence on a specific number field, thereby taking it beyond the
work done by Frobenius, Theodor Molien (1861–1941), and Elie Cartan
(1869–1951) on the Continent. Wedderburn here presented his influential
structure theorems. These state the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Any algebra can be expressed as the sum of a nilpotent and a
semisimple algebra.</p></li>
<li><p>Any semisimple algebra that is not simple is the direct sum of
simple algebras.</p></li>
<li><p>Any simple algebra is the direct product of a primitive algebra
and a simple matrix algebra.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another paper of great influence in the trend to abstraction was
Ernst Steinitz’s (1871–1928) work on the algebraic theory of fields,
which appeared in the winter of 1909–1910 and had been motivated by Kurt
Hensel’s (1861–1941) work on p-adic fields. Analogous work in ring
theory was first undertaken by A. Fraenkel (1891–1965), who had been a
student of Hensel’s. Following his work, Emmy Noether, in 1921,
transferred decomposition theorems for ideals in algebraic number fields
to those for ideals in arbitrary rings. On the basis of this work,
Wolfgang Krull (1899–1971) published a series of papers on the algebraic
theory of rings, in which he carried out the analogy to Steinitz’s
memoir on fields. Noether and her students made other major
contributions to ring theory before she turned to a treatment of finite
group representations from an ideal-theoretic point of view. By now,
Noether’s work and that of her students overlapped with related work of
Richard Brauer (1901–1977), Emil Artin (1898–1962), B. L. van der
Waerden (1903–1996), and Helmut Hasse (1898–1979). Simultaneously,
Wedderburn and the American school continued their generalizations.
Against this background of increased activity in abstract ring theory
and hypercomplex systems theory, Artin published a generalization of the
Wedderburn structure theorems to rings satisfying chain conditions.
Chain conditions had been used since the days of Otto Hölder (1859–1937)
and Dedekind but were brought to the fore in the 1921 paper of Emmy
Noether just mentioned. Through Noether’s influence, these algebraic
notions were linked to topology in the work of Heinz Hopf (1894–1971)
and Pavel Aleksandrov, both of whom had obtained their topological
orientation from L. E. J. Brouwer.</p>
<p>Differential Geometry and Tensor Analysis</p>
<p>Early-twentieth-century differential geometry would make an
interesting case study for examining the impact of external forces on
changing attitudes toward a branch of mathematics. The joint papers of
Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (1853–1925) and Tullio Levi-Civita (1873–1941)
on Ricci-Curbastro’s absolute calculus provided a fitting summary of
late-nineteenth-century accomplishments in differential geometry. The
subject had reached a certain plateau; workers in the field made minor
contributions, interesting alternatives were formulated, and complex
computational results were modified and simplified—yet altogether it was
a field apparently doomed to be of interest only to the specialist. This
changed dramatically after the announcement by Albert Einstein
(1879–1955) of his theory of general relativity. In 1915, he presented
the discovery of his gravitational equations by noting that it marked “a
true triumph of the methods of the general differential calculus founded
by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci” (Sitzungsbericht der Preussischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1915:778–786).</p>
<p>Interest in the general theory of relativity led to a spate of
publications designed to clarify or expand both the theory of general
relativity and differential geometry. In 1916, the German set theorist
Gerhard Hessenberg (1874–1925) had introduced the concept of a
connection. Levi-Civita introduced his concept of parallelism in 1917
and, in the early 1920s, lectured at the University of Rome on the
subject that he continued to call the absolute differential calculus; he
published a systematic exposition in 1923. Just one year earlier, Dirk
Struik (1894–2000), a student of, and a collaborator with, the Dutch
differential geometer J. A. Schouten (1883–1971), had issued a volume on
the elements of multidimensional differential geometry; it was followed
in 1924 by a treatise on the Ricci-Curbastro calculus by Schouten
himself. Simultaneously, a group of books by mathematicians and
physicists appeared that combined the exposition of known principles
with new contributions to the physical interpretation and the
mathematical theory. Among the best known of these works published
between 1916 and 1925 were those by the Americans G. D. Birkhoff and R.
D. Carmichael (1879–1967), the Englishman A. S. Eddington (1882–1944),
and the Germans Max von Laue and Hermann Weyl. Although some of these
volumes were brilliant examples of exposition, treating as clearly as
possible a subject the mathematical basis of which was wrapped up in a
cumbersome theory, their very popularity among the scientifically and
philosophically oriented reading public did much to spread the notion of
the incomprehensibility of mathematics and mathematical physics. For
more than a generation, relatively few mathematicians were aware that
the seeds of a new approach to differential geometry had already been
sown.</p>
<p>When Hermann Weyl left his position as privatdozent in Göttingen in
1913 to accept a professorship at the University of Zurich, he had just
completed a period of immersion in the mathematics of Riemann. In the
winter of 1911–1912, he had lectured on Riemann’s function theory; his
stated theme was to base Riemann’s work not on “visualizable
plausibility” but on set-theoretically exact proofs meeting requirements
of rigor. The outgrowth of this was Weyl’s classic book on the concept
of the Riemann surface, completed in April 1913. New concepts and
definitions, such as the introductory one of a complex manifold, made
this small work basic to much subsequent research on manifolds. Weyl
spent more time on Riemannian geometry after his move to Zurich and
during World War I. He explored the concept of a linear connection,
thinking for some time that linking this to the group of similitudes
might result in a unified field theory. A set of classical papers on the
theory of linear representations of Lie groups written in the mid-1920s
was partially an outgrowth of this work. In the meantime, Elie Cartan,
who had begun his career with the study of Lie groups, revamped
differential geometry.</p>
<p>Cartan, early in his research work, had developed the calculus of
exterior differential forms. He shaped it into a powerful tool that he
applied to differential geometry, as well as to many other areas of
mathematics. In his approach to differential geometry, he expanded the
nineteenth-century notion of a “moving frame” that had been used by
Gaston Darboux 1842–1917), among others. His main achievements were
based on the use of two concepts he fashioned: One was his definition of
a connection, which was widely adopted by differential geometers. The
other was the notion of a symmetric Riemann space. In such a space, each
point is assumed to be surrounded by a symmetry, that is, a certain
distance-preserving transformation that leaves the point fixed. Cartan
had earlier succeeded in classifying simple real Lie algebras and in
determining the irreducible linear representations of simple Lie
algebras. It turns out that the classification of simple Lie groups can
be applied to the description of symmetric Riemann spaces.</p>
<p>Among Cartan’s contribution to other areas of mathematics, we note
only his important work in the theory of differential systems. Here,
too, he was able to abstract the traditional problem from a choiceof
variables or functions, by defining a truly “general” solution of an
abstract system. He then turned his attention to seeking all singular
solutions; this work was completed by Masatake Kuranishi four years
after Cartan’s death.</p>
<p>Probability</p>
<p>Set theory and measure theory during the twentieth century invaded an
ever-widening portion of mathematics, and few branches have been as
thoroughly influenced by the trend as has the theory of probability, to
which Borel had contributed his Élements de la théorie des probabilités
(1909). The opening year of the new century was auspicious for
probability, both in physics and in genetics, for in 1901, Josiah
Willard Gibbs published his Elementary Principles in Statistical
Mechanics, and in the same year, Biometrika was founded by Karl Pearson
(1857–1936). Francis Galton (1822–1911), a precocious cousin of Charles
Darwin and a born statistician, had studied regression phenomena; in
1900, Pearson, the Galton Professor of Eugenics at the University of
London, had popularized the chi-square test. One of Poincaré’s titles
had been “Professor of the Calculus of Probabilities,” indicating the
rising interest in the subject.</p>
<p>In Russia, the study of linked chains of events was initiated,
especially in 1906–1907, by A. A. Markov (1856–1922), a student of
Chebyshev’s and the coeditor of his teacher’s Oeuvres (2 vols.,
1899–1904). In the kinetic theory of gases and in many social and
biological phenomena, the probability of an event often depends on
preceding outcomes, and especially since the middle of the twentieth
century, Markov chains of linked probabilities have been widely studied.
As mathematical foundations for the expanding theory of probability were
sought, statisticians found the appropriate tool at hand, and today no
rigorous presentation of probability theory is possible without using
the notions of measurable functions and modern theories of integration.
In Russia, for example, Kolmogorov made important advances in Markov
processes (1931) and satisfied in part Hilbert’s sixth project, calling
for axiomatic foundations of probability, through the use of Lebesgue
measure theory. Classical analysis had been concerned with continuous
functions, whereas probability problems generally involve discrete
cases. Measure theory and the extensions of the integration concept were
ideally suited to bring about a closer association of analysis and
probability, especially after the middle of the century, when Laurent
Schwartz (1915–2002) of Nancy and Paris generalized the concept of
differentiation through the theory of distributions (1950–1951).</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function of atomic physics had shown that the
pathological functions that had long occupied mathematicians were also
useful in science. In the more difficult cases, however,
differentiability breaks down, with resulting problems in the solution
of differential equations—one of the chief connecting links between
mathematics and physics, especially where singular solutions are
involved. To surmount this difficulty, Schwartz introduced a broader
view of differentiability, one made possible by the development, in the
first half of the century, of general vector spaces by Stefan Banach
(1892–1945), Fréchet, and others. A linear vector space is a set of
elements a, b, c, . . . satisfying certain conditions, especially
including the requirement that if a and b are elements of L, and if α
and β are complex numbers, then αa + βb is an element of L. If the
elements of L are functions, the linear vector space is called a linear
space, and a mapping of this case is called a linear functional. By a
“distribution,” Schwartz meant a linear and continuous functional on the
space of functions that are differentiable and that satisfy certain
other conditions. The Dirac measure, for example, is a special case of a
distribution. Schwartz then developed an appropriate definition of the
derivative of a distribution such that the derivative of a distribution
is always itself a distribution. This provides a powerful generalization
of the calculus, with immediate applications to probability theory and
physics.</p>
<p>Bounds and Approximations</p>
<p>While observing the growth of abstraction and generality during the
early twentieth century, it is easy to overlook the fact that this was
also a period of increased activity in the development of numerical
techniques designed to assist in solving problems that withstood direct
attack with closed form expressions. One of the best-known examples is
the Kutta-Runge method for the solution of differential equations known
since the first decade of the twentieth century. The strongest of the
Kutta-Runge algorithms proved to be superior to many of the more recent
competitors that flourished after numerical analysis gained new
prominence because of the advent of automatic computing. Similarly,
numerous approximations and bound calculations in number theory that
were achieved in the first three decades of the century would be
superseded only decades later.</p>
<p>A significant number of studies dealt with bounds for minimal forms,
a subject to which Hermite had called attention; it was he who gave an
upper bound for the minimum of an n-ary form with a given determinant
that is fixed—and to which A. N. Korkin (1837–1908) and Egor Zolotarev
(1847–1878) made significant contributions, which in turn inspired
Markov, who had studied with them as well as with Chebyshev at
St. Petersburg. Markov had won a gold medal for a paper on the
integration of differential equations by continued fractions and two
years later, in 1880, wrote a highly acclaimed thesis on binary
quadratic forms with positive determinant. Intrigued by the research
emanating from the St. Petersburg group—Markov’s thesis had been
published in the Mathematische Annalen—Frobenius wrote a number of
papers that built on Markov’s work; in addition, several of Frobenius’s
students made important contributions to this area of research. The
problem Markov addressed of finding a lower bound for an indefinite
binary quadratic form provides a good example. In several papers
published in 1913, Frobenius showed that in contrast to Markov, he could
obtain most of Markov’s results without the use of continued fractions.
The one case that had eluded Frobenius was resolved by Robert Remak
(1888–1942) by 1924. In his study of Markov’s problem, Issai Schur
(1875–1941) in 1913 had relied on minimal forms in a way that Remak now
used, along with Frobenius’s successful results. Having completely rid
the solution of Markov’s problem from continued fractions, Remak in 1925
first proved strictly arithmetically a number of related theorems and
then provided a geometric interpretation of the results obtained by
Markov, Frobenius, and himself.</p>
<p>Another major impetus to studies of bounds and approximations
emanated from Hermann Minkowski. In his Habilitationsschrift of 1886, he
had discussed minima of positive definite quadratic forms. The notions
found in this work would be elaborated in his Diophantische
Approximationen of 1907 and his posthumous Geometrie der Zahlen (1910).
Edmund Landau (1877–1938), Minkowski’s successor at Götttingen, although
a student of Frobenius’s, was primarily interested in analytic number
theory. In 1903, he produced a simplified proof of the prime number
theorem; in 1909, his magnum opus, a two-volume handbook concerning the
distribution of primes, was published. Yet in 1918, he was to obtain the
first estimation of units and regulators in algebraic number fields. He
used a procedure Remak had developed (without use of continued
fractions) in a 1913 paper that contained numerical bounds for the
equation t2 − Du2 = 1, along with Minkowski’s theorem concerning linear
forms. Landau, like Minkowski before him, did not shy away from using
ideal theory in these studies. Neither did he avoid analytic supports
where necessary; thus, in one of the 1918 papers, he made free use of
the functional equation of Dedekind’s zeta-function that Hecke had
brought forth the previous year. On the other hand, Remak, who would
excel in the estimation of units and regulators in the years to come,
strove for purely arithmetic proofs and eschewed ideal-theoretic, as
well as analytic tools.</p>
<p>Three men who freely used analytic tools were G. H. Hardy
(1877–1947), J. E. Littlewood (1885–1977), and the autodidactic Indian
genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920). In the second decade of the
century, Hardy and Littlewood began their well-known collaboration on
numerical partitions. During the time that he spent with them in
England, Ramanujan and Hardy produced a joint paper on asymptotic values
of p(n), where p(n) is the number of partitions of an integer n into
summands. Ramanujan had previously made a number of conjectures
concerning p(n), based on numerical data for small n; he had also proved
some of his guesses using elliptic functions. In the joint paper, he
suggested an asymptotic formula for p(n) that, as Hans Rademacher
(1892–1969) would subsequently prove, actually led to an exact value for
n.</p>
<p>The activities just outlined are of interest not only for the
specific results they produced but because of the competition among the
various participants to demonstrate the superiority, or at least the
usefulness, of their particular technique, whether arithmetic,
algebraic, analytic—singly or in combination. This would eventually shed
additional light on many underlying structural relationships.</p>
<p>The 1930s and World War II</p>
<p>The rise to power of Hitler and the National Socialist Party in
Germany precipitated a catastrophe that soon affected mathematical
institutions around the world. In the spring of 1933, numerous
professors were dismissed from German universities. This and the
subsequent more serious actions taken against individuals of Jewish
background or opposing political beliefs resulted in a vast migration of
scholars from Germany or German-occupied countries, as well as in the
deaths of many who remained. It also resulted in the diminution of some
of the most established mathematical centers of Western and Central
Europe. Attempted purges of mathematicians in the Soviet Union similarly
stifled growth in a number of the younger centers of activity. Some of
the most severe institutional and individual losses occurred in Poland
with the closing of the universities after 1939, the destruction of the
University of Warsaw’s mathematical collections, the deportation of
nearly 200 faculty members from the Jagellonian University in Krakow,
and the planned killing of professors in Lvov in July 1941.</p>
<p>A substantial number of European mathematicians came to the United
States. Among the best known were Hermann Weyl and the algebraists Emil
Artin, Richard Brauer, and Emmy Noether; the analysts Richard Courant
and Jacques Hadamard; the probability specialist William Feller; the
statistician Jerzy Neyman; the logicians Kurt Gödel and Alfred Tarski;
and the historian of mathematics Otto Neugebauer, to name but a few.
There were mathematicians not subject to persecution who left
professional life, often at the beginning of their careers, to avoid
institutional or organizational affiliations that were incompatible with
their moral beliefs; a few reemerged after World War II. On the other
hand, recalling only three of the multitude who did not escape,
Hausdorff committed suicide to avoid deportation; Otto Blumenthal,
Hilbert’s first Ph.D. student, died in Theresienstadt; and Stanislaw
Saks, the noted contributor to twentieth-century integration theory, was
killed in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The relocation of mathematicians who found refuge resulted in the
infusion of new ideas in many mathematical centers. This presented a
challenge both to those confronted with new concepts and those
attempting to superimpose them on existing systems. Mathematicians were
equally challenged by new problems encountered in World War II.
Especially important at that time were the needs in applied mathematics.
Table computations and the methodology of operations research are but
two examples of areas that redirected the attention of many
mathematicians who had been trained in entirely different fields.
Nevertheless, most of the enormous development during the twenty years
following World War II was spurred on by problems within pure
mathematics itself, yet within the same period, the applications of
mathematics to science multiplied exceedingly.</p>
<p>Nicolas Bourbaki</p>
<p>Mathematics of the twentieth century saw an emphasis on abstraction
and an increasing concern with the analysis of broad patterns. Perhaps
nowhere is this more clearly apparent than in the mid-twentieth-century
works that emanated from the polycephalic mathematician known as Nicolas
Bourbaki. This is a nonexistent Frenchman with a Greek name that has
appeared on the title pages of several dozen volumes in a continuing
major work, Éléments de mathématique, that was intended to survey all of
worthwhile mathematics. The home of Bourbaki is given as Nancy, a city
that provided a number of leading twentieth-century mathematicians. In
Nancy, there is a statue to the colorful and once-very-real General
Charles Denis Sauter Bourbaki (1816–1897), who in 1862 was offered, but
declined, the throne of Greece and whose role in the Franco-Prussian War
was very tangible. Nicolas Bourbaki, nevertheless, is not a relative in
any sense of the word; the name was simply appropriated to designate a
group of anonymous mathematicians, almost exclusively French. As an
institutional connection, N. Bourbaki sometimes used the University of
Nancago, a playful reference to the fact that two of the moving spirits
within the group were for a while connected with universities in the
Chicago area—André Weil at the University of Chicago (later, however, at
the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton) and Jean Dieudonné
(1906–1992) at Northwestern University (formerly at the University of
Nancy, later at the University of Paris).</p>
<p>Bourbaki originated as the result of conversations between André Weil
and Henri Cartan in Strasbourg in 1934 concerning the need for new,
up-to-date textbooks; they were spurred to action by their frustration
at their students’ having to rely on Goursat’s Traité d’Analyse, and
they invited a group of other young mathematicians to join them in a
remedial project of writing a new analysis textbook. The original group,
holding regular meetings in a Paris café, consisted of Claude Chevalley
(1909–1984), Jean Dieudonné, René de Possel (1905–1974) and Jean
Delsarte (1903–1968), in addition to Cartan and Weil. Also participating
were S. Mandelbrojt (1899–1983) and, for a shorter period, Paul Dubreil
(1904–1994) (replaced by Jean Coulomb) and Jean Leray (1906–1988)
(replaced by Charles Ehresmann (1905–1979). They rather quickly gave up
the original idea of a massive one-volume textbook and decided instead
on a series of self-contained, linearly ordered volumes. Each volume
would be characterized by strict adherence to an axiomatic approach, an
abstract form that brought out the structure of the underlying concepts,
and a progression from general to specific cases. Members chose and
discussed the topic for each volume; one person was chosen to act as
editor; members then reviewed the copy, with Dieudonné predominantly
acting as final reviser; and each volume was cleared for publication
after unanimous consent had been reached.</p>
<p>It was hoped that the emphasis on structure and logical coherence
would effect a considerable economy of thought. In the early nineteenth
century, the discovery that the structure of the complex number system
was the same as that of points in the Euclidean plane showed that the
properties of the latter, studied for more than two millennia, could be
applied to the former. The result was an exuberant proliferation in
complex analysis. It seemed that twentieth-century concern for
similarities in structure should, in the years to come, yield similar
dividends.</p>
<p>Romantics in mathematics earlier in the century had feared a takeover
of their subject by an arid formalism encouraged by logicism. By the
middle of the century, the feud between formalists and intuitionists had
quieted, and the Bourbaki group saw no need to take sides in the
controversy. “What the axiomatic method sets as its essential aim,”
Bourbaki wrote, “is exactly that which logical formalism by itself
cannot supply, namely the profound intelligibility of mathematics.” In
the same vein, one of the leaders of the group wrote that “If logic is
the hygiene of the mathematician, it is not his source of food.”</p>
<p>The first volume of Bourbaki’s Éléments appeared in 1939. After the
end of World War II, parts of the first three books were still
incomplete and the last three had to be started. New members who joined
Bourbaki before 1950 included Roger Godemont, Pierre Samuel, Jacques
Dixmier, and Jean-Pierre Serre, and they were soon followed by Samuel
Eilenberg, Jean-Louis Koszul, and Laurent Schwartz. By 1958, most of
what is known as Part I, Les structures fondamentales de l’analyse, had
been completed. This part contains half a dozen subheadings or “books”:
(1) Set Theory, (2) Algebra, (3) General Topology, (4) Functions of a
Real Variable, (5) Topological Vector Spaces, and (6) Integration. As
the titles indicate, only a small portion of the mathematics contained
in these volumes was in existence a century earlier.</p>
<p>By the time plans for the next volumes had to be firmed up, a “third
generation” joined the group. They included Armand Borel, François
Bruhat, Pierre Cartier, Alexander Grothendieck, Serge Lang, and John
Tate. They were faced with major challenges in determining the course
the project should now take. Should the original concept of the
self-contained linear order be followed when so many new topics would
require preliminaries that might be decades in the making? Should the
existing first six volumes be rewritten and brought up to date? Should
the volumes covering the newest research results in mathematics still be
treated as textbooks? Should all members of the group be expected to be
sufficiently knowledgeable in each topic to participate in the
decision-making process for that volume?</p>
<p>After a variety of proposals, substantial arguments, and considerable
debate—an activity that had always characterized the meetings of the
group—by 1984, Bourbaki had produced a certain amount of new material.
As before, chapters of the individual books were not always completed in
the planned, eventual order. There were two “summary” chapters on
differential and analytic manifolds, designed to serve as a compromise
for having to give up the rigorous linear order for these topics; seven
chapters on commutative algebra; eight chapters on Lie groups and Lie
algebras; and two chapters on spectral theories. In addition, there was
now an English translation of some of the first six books, of three of
the chapters on Lie groups and algebras, and of the chapters on
commutative algebra. Fifty years after the first café gatherings in
Paris, the future of Bourbaki was less certain than it had been during
the difficult days of its first quarter-century.</p>
<p>Homological Algebra and Category Theory</p>
<p>The fundamental concepts of modern (or abstract) algebra, topology,
and vector spaces were laid down between 1920 and 1940, but the next
twenty years saw a veritable upheaval in methods of algebraic topology
that carried over into algebra and analysis. The result was a new
subject known as homological algebra, the first book on which, by Henri
Cartan (1904–2008) and Samuel Eilenberg (1913–1998), appeared in 1955,
to be followed in the next dozen years by several other monographs,
including Saunders Mac Lane’s (1909–2005) Homology. Homological algebra
is a development of abstract algebra concerned with results that are
valid for many different kinds of spaces—an invasion of algebraic
topology in the domain of pure algebra. The rapidity with which this
general and powerful cross between abstract algebra and algebraic
topology has grown is apparent in the swift increase in the number of
articles on homological algebra listed in Mathematical Reviews.
Moreover, so widely applicable are results in the field that the older
labels of algebra, analysis, and geometry scarcely fit the results of
recent research. Never before has mathematics been so thoroughly unified
as in our day.</p>
<p>Symptomatic of this trend was the introduction of the notions of
functor and category in 1942 by Eilenberg and Mac Lane. In the words of
Eilenberg:</p>
<p>A category A has “objects” A, B, C, and so on, and arrows and so on.
Two consecutive arrows, , may be composed to give This composition is
associative. Each object A has an identity, that is, an arrow which,
when composed with any other arrow, does not change it. Functors are
simply ways of transforming one category into another. . .. For those
familiar with the terms, we list some examples. The category of groups:
here the objects are groups, and the arrows (technically called
morphisms) are homomorphisms of groups. Category of topological spaces:
the objects are topological spaces and the morphisms continuous
mappings. Category of differentiable manifolds: the morphisms are
differentiable mappings. Category of vector spaces: the morphisms are
linear transformations. Now some examples of functors. The rule which
associates with each topological space its one-dimensional homology
group and with each continuous mapping of one space into another the
induced homomorphism of homology groups is a functor from the category
of topological spaces to that of Abelian groups. The rule which
associates with each differentiable manifold the vector space of
differentiable functions denned on it and with each differentiable
mapping the induced linear mapping of the vector space is a functor from
the category of differentiable manifolds to that of vector spaces
[COSRIMS, 1969, p. 159].</p>
<p>Algebraic Geometry</p>
<p>Twentieth-century algebraic geometry was subject to a succession of
efforts to place its foundation on firmer groundwork. In the late 1920s,
Oscar Zariski (1899–1986), who had been trained in the Italian school of
algebraic geometers, working with Enriques, Castelnuovo, and Severi, set
out to use the most recent results of abstract algebra as building
blocks for algebraic geometry. Not surprisingly, B. L. van der Waerden,
the author of the paradigmatic two-volume Moderne Algebra, took a
similar approach. It was André Weil, in the introduction to his 1946
volume on Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, who described the issue at
hand from the following broader perspective:</p>
<p>However grateful we algebraic geometers should be to the modern
algebraic school for lending us temporary accommodation, makeshift
constructions full of rings, ideals and valuations, in which some of us
feel in constant danger of getting lost, our wish and aim must be to
return at the earliest possible moment to the palaces which are ours by
birthright, to consolidate shaky foundations, to provide roofs where
they are missing, to finish, in harmony with the portions already
existing, what has been left undone.</p>
<p>The next effort to stabilize the foundations occurred after World War
II. In 1946, Jean Leray began to publish several notes in the Comptes
rendus discussing the notions of sheaves and spectral sequences. Much of
this material was based on thoughts he had developed as a prisoner of
war. In the 1950s, Jean-Pierre Serre produced a series of publications
applying sheaves to algebraic geometry. This in turn was followed in the
1960s by Alexander Grothendieck’s series Éléments de géométrie
algébrique, where the idea of schemes came to the fore. The notes of
Grothendieck’s seminar of the same decade underlined the relationship of
algebraic geometry to algebraic number theory and called attention to
correspondences between algebraic geometry over finite fields and the
topology of manifolds. A major motivation of this work was an attack on
the Weil conjectures of the 1940s concerning the local zeta functions
obtained from the points on algebraic varieties over finite fields. The
most difficult of the conjectures—an analogue of the Riemann
hypothesis—was proved by Pierre Deligne in 1974, using etale cohomology
theory.</p>
<p>While much of algebraic geometry is concerned with abstract and
general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation
with concretely given polynomials were also developed. By the 1990s,
reputable undergraduate textbooks assured students and instructors that
they no longer needed to be conversant with the traditional abstract
content of graduate courses in algebraic geometry but, thanks to the
development of new algorithms, could work efficiently with polynomial
equations and should be able to use a computer algebra system and study
the most important of the newer techniques, the method of Gröbner bases,
which was employed in all computer algebra systems of the time.</p>
<p>Logic and Computing</p>
<p>It is one of the ironies of history that while Bourbaki and many
other pure mathematicians pursued the goal of substituting ideas for
calculations, engineers and applied mathematicians developed a tool that
revived interest in numerical and algorithmic techniques and sharply
affected the composition of many departments of mathematics: the
computer. In the first half of the twentieth century, the history of
computing machines involved more statisticians, physicists, and
electrical engineers than mathematicians. Desk calculating machines and
punched-card systems were indispensable to business, banking, and the
social sciences. The slide rule became the symbol of the engineer, and
integrators of various types were used by physicists, geodesists, and
statisticians. Paper and pencil remained the chief tools of the
mathematician. The situation changed somewhat in the 1940s because of
the involvement of mathematicians in the war effort. Although most of
the major efforts were driven by physicists and engineers, numerous
younger mathematicians played a part in the development of the automatic
digital electronic computer. Some of these pioneers stayed in the
computer field; others went into new fields more closely related to the
new technology; some turned to applied mathematics; a few returned to
their original specialties. Most of these mathematicians were at an
early stage of their careers when they became involved with computers,
many having received their Ph.D.s in the 1930s. Let us consider three
mathematicians whose contributions to the emerging computer field were
notable largely because of the fact that they had already gained a
reputation as mathematicians.</p>
<p>John von Neumann (1903–1957) was born in Budapest. After good
preparatory training that included individualized mathematical
instruction, he earned early recognition for his mathematical talents.
This permitted his obtaining a Ph.D. in mathematics from Budapest
practically in absentia while he spent his time in Zurich and Berlin. He
did, however, earn a degree in chemical engineering at the Polytechnic
Institute in Zurich. In a paper published when he was only twenty-one,
he gave a new definition for ordinal numbers; two years later, he
presented a system of axioms for set theory that provided an alternative
to those of Zermelo and A. Fraenkel. In 1926, he produced a pioneering
paper on game theory, following work by Borel. His teaching career began
in Germany, where he spent the three years from 1927 to 1930 at the
universities of Berlin and Hamburg. In 1930, he moved to Princeton, New
Jersey, where he was affiliated with Princeton University until asked to
become a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1933. One of the
most creative and versatile mathematicians of the century, von Neumann
was a pioneer in a new approach to mathematical economics. Econometrics
had long made use of mathematical analysis, but it was especially
through the Theory of Games and Economic Behavior of von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 that so-called finite mathematics came to play
an increasing role in the social sciences. Von Neumann’s contributions
to game theory involved primarily versions of cooperative games; the
1944 volume considered two-person zero-sum games. (This field of inquiry
was expanded considerably in the 1950s when John Forbes Nash developed
the equilibrium concept that allowed examination of noncooperative
games, which eventually resulted in his sharing the 1994 Nobel Prize in
Economics.)</p>
<p>Interrelationships among the various branches of thought had become
so complicated that Norbert Wiener (1894–1964), a mathematical prodigy
and for many years a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in 1948 published his Cybernetics, a book that
established a new subject devoted to the study of control and
communication in animals and machines. Von Neumann and Wiener were also
deeply involved in quantum theory, and the former in 1955 was appointed
to the Atomic Energy Commission. In addition to their contributions to
applied mathematics, these men contributed at least as extensively to
pure mathematics—to set theory, group theory, operational calculus,
probability, and mathematical logic and foundations. It had been von
Neumann, in fact, who in about 1929 had given Hilbert space its name,
its first axiomatization, and its present highly abstract form. Wiener
had been important in the early 1920s in the origins of the modern
theory of linear spaces and, in particular, in the development of Banach
space.</p>
<p>Alan Turing (1913–1954), the youngest of the three, was an Englishman
who graduated from King’s College at Cambridge University in 1934. The
following year, he made history by solving one of the outstanding
problems in mathematical logic. The paper containing this result,
published in 1937, was titled “On Computable Numbers, with an
Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.” In 1936, Turing had gone to
the United States to study at Princeton. While there, he worked with the
logician A. Church, who brought out his own proof of the
Entscheidungsproblem and became acquainted with John von Neumann. Having
been awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1938, Turing returned to England. On the
outbreak of World War II, Turing reported to the Government Code and
Cipher School at Bletchley Park. From then until his untimely death in
1954, he was deeply involved in cryptanalytic activity, the design of
electronic computers, and the design of programming systems.</p>
<p>Initial uses of computers for mathematical purposes were limited to
table computations and calculations of prime numbers, mathematical
constants, and the like. Some of the early computations of e and π were
carried out to test computing speed and capacity, as much as to
establish new results. In time, such efforts became more useful for
mathematics, theorem-proving programs were developed, and, as we shall
note in the next chapter, by 1977, the first computer-based proof of a
major mathematical theorem could be announced.</p>
<p>The Fields Medals</p>
<p>The international mathematical community has an award that is often
likened to the Nobel Prize in other disciplines. The award is named for
John Charles Fields (1863–1932), a Canadian mathematician based at the
University of Toronto who specialized in the study of algebraic
functions. He had good interpersonal relationships with European
mathematicians, notably Gösta Mittag-Leffler and appears to have had
considerable managerial skills. He succeeded in bringing the 1924
International Congress of Mathematicians to Toronto at a time when there
were sharp political differences among mathematicians. After World War I
(until 1928), Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey were
excluded from the International Mathematical Union (IMU) that was
established in 1920 to organize subsequent congresses. Fields
successfully persuaded many leading European mathematicians opposed to
the IMU to support and attend the 1924 congress; he raised funds for the
congress and its attendees; and when it turned out that there was excess
money at the end, he proposed, in 1931, that this money be used to
establish an international medal for mathematics. His will provided for
an additional amount.</p>
<p>At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932, it was
decided that beginning with the 1936 congress, “Fields medals” should be
awarded at the ICM to two mathematicians every four years. The
recipients should be under forty years old, and, as Fields had
suggested, the awards should call attention to past accomplishments as
well as future potential. The rules were modified in 1966 to stipulate
that the number of Fields medals awarded at each congress should be at
least two but no more than four.</p>
<p>The first two medals went to Lars V. Ahlfors (1907–1996) and Jesse
Douglas (1897–1965) for their work in analysis. Ahlfors was recognized
for his work “on covering surfaces related to Riemann surfaces of
inverse functions of entire and meromorphic functions”; Douglas received
recognition for his research in the area of Plateau’s problem.</p>
<p>World War II disrupted the International Congresses and the
concomitant medal awards; the next awards ceremony took place in 1950.
The 1950s reflected the waning dominance of classical analysis;
henceforth there was a steady increase of awards for research in
topology as well as in algebra, algebraic geometry, and number theory.
Since the 1990s, a number of awards have gone to individuals who
excelled in research that pulled together previously diverse areas of
mathematics.</p>
<p>Of the fifty-two Fields medals awarded prior to 2014, only four went
to recipients under thirty years of age. Eleven honorees were born in
the United States, eight each in France and the former Soviet Union or
Russia, six in England, and three each in Germany and Japan. The
remaining recipients were natives of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Italy,
Ukraine, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, China, Vietnam, and
Israel. These figures are of limited significance, however; for example,
two of those born in Germany studied and lived in France; numerous
others born outside North America spent at least part of their careers
in the United States. As we shall see in the next chapter, one honoree
declined the award and another potential recipient lost out because of
the proximity of his fortieth birthday; he received a silver plate
instead of a medal.</p>
