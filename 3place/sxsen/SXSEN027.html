<h4 id="geometry-as-applied-arithmetic">Geometry as Applied
Arithmetic</h4>
<p>Measurement was the keynote of algebraic geometry in the Mesopotamian
Valley, but a major flaw, as in Egyptian geometry, was that the
distinction between exact and approximate measures was not made clear.
The area of a quadrilateral was found by taking the product of the
arithmetic means of the pairs of opposite sides, with no warning that
this is in most cases only a crude approximation. Again, the volume of a
frustum of a cone or a pyramid was sometimes found by taking the
arithmetic mean of the upper and lower bases and multiplying by the
height; sometimes, for a frustum of a square pyramid with areas a2 and
b2 for the lower and upper bases, the formula</p>
<p>a1b 2</p>
<p>V 5 h</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Ge ome tr y a s A pplie d Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>was applied. For the latter, however, the Babylonians also used a
rule equivalent to</p>
<p>a1b 2 1 a2b 2</p>
<p>V 5h 1 ;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>a formula that is correct and reduces to the one used by the
Egyptians.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Egyptian and Babylonian results were always
independently discovered, but in any case, the latter were definitely
more extensive than the former, in both geometry and algebra. The
Pythagorean theorem, for example, does not appear in any form in
surviving documents from Egypt, but tablets even from the Old Babylonian
period show that in Mesopotamia the theorem was widely used. A cuneiform
text from the Yale Collection, for example, contains a diagram of a
square and its diagonals in which the number 30 is written along one
side and the numbers 42;25,35 and 1;24,51,10 appear along a diagonal.
The last number obviously is the ratio of the lengths of the diagonal
and ap side, and this is so accurately expressed that it agrees with 2
to within about a millionth. The accuracy of the result was made
possible by knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem. Sometimes, in less
precise computations, the Babylonians used 1;25 as a rough-and-ready
approximation to this ratio. Of more significance than the precision of
the values, however, is the implication that the diagonal of any square
could be foundp by multiplying the side by 2. Thus, there seems to have
been some awareness of general principles, despite the fact that these
are exclusively expressed in special cases.</p>
<p>Babylonian recognition of the Pythagorean theorem was by no means
limited to the case of a right isosceles triangle. In one Old Babylonian
problem text, a ladder or a beam of length 0;30 stands against a wall;
the question is, how far will the lower end move out from the wall if
the upper end slips down a distance of 0;6 units? The answer is
correctly found by use of the Pythagorean theorem. Fifteen hundred years
later, similar problems, some with new twists, were still being solved
in the Mesopotamian Valley. A Seleucid tablet, for example, proposes the
following problem. A reed stands against a wall. If the top slides down
3 units when the lower end slides away 9 units, how long is the reed?
The answer is given correctly as 15 units.</p>
<p>Ancient cuneiform problem texts provide a wealth of exercises in what
we might call geometry, but which the Babylonians probably thought of as
applied arithmetic. A typical inheritance problem calls for the
partition of a right-triangular property among six brothers. The area is
given as 11,22,30 and one of the sides is 6,30; the dividing lines are
to be equidistant and parallel to the other side of the triangle. One is
asked to find the difference in the allotments. Another text gives the
bases of an isosceles trapezoid as 50 and 40 units and the length of the
sides as 30; the altitude and the area are required (van der Waerden
1963, pp. 76 77).</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonians were aware of other important geometric
relationships. Like the Egyptians, they knew that the altitude in an
isosceles triangle bisects the base. Hence, given the length of a chord
in a circle of known radius, they were able to find the apothem. Unlike
the Egyptians, they were familiar with the fact that an angle inscribed
in a semicircle is a right angle, a proposition generally known as the
Theorem of Thales, despite the fact that Thales lived more than a
millennium after the Babylonians had begun to use it. This misnaming of
a well-known theorem in geometry is symptomatic of the difficulty in
assessing the influence of pre-Hellenic mathematics on later cultures.
Cuneiform tablets had a permanence that could not be matched by
documents from other civilizations, for papyrus and parchment do not so
easily survive the ravages of time. Moreover, cuneiform texts continued
to be recorded down to the dawn of the Christian era, but were they read
by neighboring civilizations, especially the Greeks? The center of
mathematical development was shifting from the Mesopotamian Valley to
the Greek world half a dozen centuries before the beginning of our era,
but reconstructions of early Greek mathematics are rendered hazardous by
the fact that there are virtually no extant mathematical documents from
the pre-Hellenistic period. It is important, therefore, to keep in mind
the general characteristics of Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics so as
to be able to make at least plausible conjectures concerning analogies
that may be apparent between pre-Hellenic contributions and the
activities and attitudes of later peoples.</p>
<p>There is a lack of explicit statements of rules and of clear-cut
distinctions between exact and approximate results. The omission in the
tables of cases involving irregular sexagesimals seems to imply some
recognition of such distinctions, but neither the Egyptians nor the
Babylonians appear to have raised the question of when the area of a
quadrilateral (or of a circle) is found exactly and when only
approximately. Questions about the solvability or unsolvability of a
problem do not seem to have been raised, nor was there any investigation
into the nature of proof. The word “proof” means various things at
different levels and ages; hence, it is hazardous to assert
categorically that pre-Hellenic peoples had no concept of proof, nor any
feeling of the need for proof. There are hints that these people were
occasionally aware that certain area and volume methods could be
justified through a reduction to simpler area and volume problems.
Moreover, pre-Hellenic scribes not infrequently checked or “proved”
their divisions by multiplication; occasionally, they verified the
procedure in a problem through a substitution that verified the
correctness of the answer. Nevertheless, there are no explicit
statements from the pre-Hellenic period that would indicate a felt need
for proofs or a concern for questions of logical principles. In
Mesopotamian problems, the words “length” and “width”</p>
<p>Ge ome tr y a s A pplie d Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>should perhaps be interpreted much as we interpret the letters x and
y, for the writers of cuneiform tablets may well have moved on from
specific instances to general abstractions. How else does one explain
the addition of a length to an area? In Egypt also, the use of the word
for quantity is not incompatible with an abstract interpretation such as
we read into it today. In addition, there were in Egypt and Babylonia
problems that have the earmarks of recreational mathematics. If a
problem calls for a sum of cats and measures of grain, or of a length
and an area, one cannot deny to the perpetrator either a modicum of
levity or a feeling for abstraction. Of course, much of pre-Hellenic
mathematics was practical, but surely not all of it. In the practice of
computation, which stretched over a couple of millennia, the schools of
scribes used plenty of exercise material, often, perhaps, simply as good
clean fun.</p>
