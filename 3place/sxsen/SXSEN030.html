<h4 id="thales-and-pythagoras">Thales and Pythagoras</h4>
<p>Accounts of the origins of Greek mathematics center on the so-called
Ionian and Pythagorean schools and the chief representative of each—
Thales and Pythagoras—although, as just noted, reconstructions of their
thought rest on fragmentary reports and traditions built up during later
centuries. The Greek world had its center between the Aegean and Ionian
seas for many centuries, but Hellenic civilization was far from
localized there. By about 600 BCE, Greek settlements were scattered
along the borders of most of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea,
and it was in these outskirts that a new surge in mathematics developed.
In this respect, the sea-bordering colonists, especially in Ionia, had
two advantages: they had the bold and imaginative spirit typical of
pioneers, and they were in closer proximity to the two chief river
valleys where knowledge thrived. Thales of Miletus (ca. 624 548 BCE) and
Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 580 500 BCE) had a further advantage: they were
in a position to travel to centers of ancient learning and there
acquire</p>
<p>firsthand information on astronomy and mathematics. In Egypt, they
are said to have learned geometry; in Babylon, under the enlightened
Chaldean ruler Nebuchadnezzar, Thales may have come in touch with
astronomical tables and instruments. Tradition has it that in 585 BCE,
Thales amazed his countrymen by predicting the solar eclipse of that
year. The historicity of this tradition is very much open to question,
however.</p>
<p>What is really known about the life and work of Thales is very little
indeed. Ancient opinion is unanimous in regarding Thales as an unusually
clever man and the first philosopher—by general agreement, the first of
the Seven Wise Men. He was regarded as “a pupil of the Egyptians and the
Chaldeans,” an assumption that appears plausible. The proposition now
known as the theorem of Thales—that an angle inscribed in a semicircle
is a right angle—may well have been learned by Thales during his travels
to Babylon. Tradition goes further, however, and attributes to him some
sort of demonstration of the theorem. For this reason, Thales has
frequently been hailed as the first true mathematician—as the originator
of the deductive organization of geometry. This report, or legend, was
embellished by adding to this theorem four others that Thales is said to
have proved:</p>
<p>1.A circle is bisected by a diameter.</p>
<p>2.The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.</p>
<p>3.The pairs of vertical angles formed by two intersecting lines
areequal.</p>
<p>4.If two triangles are such that two angles and a side of one are
equal,respectively, to two angles and a side of the other, then the
triangles are congruent.</p>
<p>There is no document from antiquity that can be pointed to as
evidence of this achievement, yet the tradition has been persistent.
About the nearest one can come to reliable evidence on this point is
derived from a source a thousand years after the time of Thales. A
student of Aristotle’s by the name of Eudemus of Rhodes (fl. ca. 320
BCE) wrote a history of mathematics. This has been lost, but before it
disappeared, someone had summarized at least part of the history. The
original of this summary has also been lost, but during the fifth
century of our era, information from the summary was incorporated by the
Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus (410 485) into the early pages of his
Commentary on the First Book of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>Designations of Thales as the first mathematician largely hinge on
the remarks of Proclus. Later in his Commentary, Proclus—again depending
on Eudemus—attributes to Thales the four theorems mentioned previously.
There are other scattered references to Thales in ancient sources, but
most of these describe his more practical activities. They do not
establish the bold conjecture that Thales created demonstrative
geometry, but in any case, Thales is the first man in history to whom
specific mathematical discoveries have been attributed.</p>
<p>That it was the Greeks who added the element of logical structure to
geometry is virtually universally admitted today, but the big question
remains whether this crucial step was taken by Thales or by others
later—perhaps as much as two centuries later. On this point, we must
suspend final judgment until there is additional evidence on the
development of Greek mathematics.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is scarcely less controversial a figure than Thales, for
he has been more thoroughly enmeshed in legend and apotheosis. Thales
had been a man of practical affairs, but Pythagoras was a prophet and a
mystic, born at Samos, one of the Dodecanese islands not far from
Miletus, the birthplace of Thales. Although some accounts picture
Pythagoras as having studied under Thales, this is rendered unlikely by
the half-century difference in their ages. Some similarity in their
interests can readily be accounted for by the fact that Pythagoras also
traveled to Egypt and Babylon—possibly even to India. During his
peregrinations, he evidently absorbed not only mathematical and
astronomical information but also much religious lore. Pythagoras was,
incidentally, virtually a contemporary of Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi
(Lao-tzu); the century was a crucial time in the development of
religion, as well as of mathematics. When Pythagoras returned to the
Greek world, he settled at Croton on the southeastern coast of what is
now Italy, but at that time was known as Magna Graecia. There he
established a secret society that somewhat resembled an Orphic cult,
except for its mathematical and philosophical basis.</p>
<p>That Pythagoras remains a very obscure figure is due in part to the
loss of documents from that age. Several biographies of Pythagoras were
written in antiquity, including one by Aristotle, but these have not
survived. A further difficulty in clearly identifying the figure of
Pythagoras lies in the fact that the order he established was communal
as well as secret. Knowledge and property were held in common, hence
attribution of discoveries was not to be made to a specific member of
the school. It is best, consequently, not to speak of the work of
Pythagoras, but rather of the contributions of the Pythagoreans,
although in antiquity it was customary to give all credit to the
master.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the Pythagorean order was
the confidence it maintained in the pursuit of philosophical and
mathematical studies as a moral basis for the conduct of life. The very
words “philosophy” (or “love of wisdom”) and “mathematics” (or “that
which is learned”) are supposed to have been coined by Pythagoras
himself to describe his intellectual activities.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Pythagoreans played an important role in the
history of mathematics. In Egypt and Mesopotamia, the elements of
arithmetic and geometry were primarily exercises in the application of
numerical procedures to specific problems, whether concerned with beer
or pyramids or the inheritance of land; we find nothing resembling a
philosophical discussion of principles. Thales is generally regarded as
having made a beginning in this direction, although tradition supports
the view of Eudemus and Proclus that the new emphasis in mathematics was
due primarily to the Pythagoreans. With them, mathematics was more
closely related to a love of wisdom than to the exigencies of practical
life. That Pythagoras was one of the most influential figures in history
is difficult to deny, for his followers, whether deluded or inspired,
spread their beliefs throughout most of the Greek world. The harmonies
and mysteries of philosophy and mathematics were essential parts of the
Pythagorean rituals. Never before or since has mathematics played so
large a role in life and religion as it did among the Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>The motto of the Pythagorean school is said to have been “All is
number.” Recalling that the Babylonians had attached numerical measures
to things around them, from the motions of the heavens to the values of
their slaves, we may perceive in the Pythagorean motto a strong
Mesopotamian affinity. The very theorem to which the name of Pythagoras
still clings quite likely was derived from the Babylonians. It has been
suggested, as justification for calling it the Theorem of Pythagoras,
that the Pythagoreans first provided a demonstration, but this
conjecture cannot be verified. It is reasonable to assume that the
earliest members of the Pythagorean school were familiar with geometric
properties known to the Babylonians, but when the Eudemus-Proclus
summary ascribes to them the construction of the “cosmic figures” (that
is, the regular solids), there is room for doubt. The cube, the
octahedron, and the dodecahedron could perhaps have been observed in
crystals, such as those of pyrite (iron disulfide), but a scholium in
Euclid’s Elements XIII reports that the Pythagoreans knew only three of
the regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube, and the dodecahedron.
Familiarity with the last figure is rendered plausible by the discovery
near Padua of an Etruscan dodecahedron of stone dating from before 500
BCE. It is not improbable, therefore, that even if the Pythagoreans did
not know of the octahedron and the icosahedron, they knew of some of the
properties of the regular pentagon. The figure of a five-pointed star
(which is formed by drawing the five diagonals of a pentagonal face of a
regular dodecahedron) is said to have been the special symbol of the
Pythagorean school. The star pentagon had appeared earlier in Babylonian
art, and it is possible that here, too, we find a connecting link
between pre-Hellenic and Pythagorean mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the tantalizing questions in Pythagorean geometry concerns the
construction of a pentagram or a star pentagon. If we begin with a
regular polygon ABCDE (Fig. 4.1) and draw the five diagonals, these
diagonals intersect in points AuBuCuDuEu, which form another regular
pentagon.</p>
<p>Noting that the triangle BCDu, for example, is similar to the
isosceles triangle BCE, and noting also the many pairs of congruent
triangles in the diagram, it is not difficult to see that the diagonal
points AuBuCuDuEu divide the diagonals in a striking manner. In each
case, a diagonal point divides a diagonal into two unequal segments such
that the ratio of the whole diagonal is to the larger segment as this
segment is to the smaller segment. This subdivision of a diagonal is the
well-known “golden section” of a line segment, but this name was not
used until a couple of thousand years later—just about the time when
Johannes Kepler wrote lyrically:</p>
<p>Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras;
the other, the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first
we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious
jewel.</p>
<p>To the ancient Greeks, this type of subdivision soon became so
familiar that no need was felt for a special descriptive name; hence,
the longer designation “the division of a segment in mean and extreme
ratio” generally was replaced by the simple words “the section.”</p>
<p>One important property of “the section” is that it is, so to speak,
selfpropagating. If a point P1 divides a segment RS (Fig. 4.2) in mean
and extreme ratio, with RP1 the longer segment, and if on this larger
segment we mark off a point P2 such that RP2 5P1S, then segment RP1 will
in turn be subdivided in mean and extreme ratio at point P2. Again, on
marking off on RP2 point P3 such that RP3 5P2P1, segment RP2 will be
divided in mean and extreme ratio at P3. This iterative procedure can be
carried out as many times as desired, the result being an ever smaller
segment RPn divided in mean and extreme ratio by point Pn11. Whether the
earlier Pythagoreans noticed this</p>
<p>R P3 P2 P1 S</p>
<p>FIG. 4.2</p>
<p>unending process or drew significant conclusions from it is not
known. Even the more fundamental question of whether the Pythagoreans of
about 500 BCE could divide a given segment into mean and extreme ratio
cannot be answered with certainty, although the probability that they
could and did seems to be high. The construction required is equivalent
to the solution of a quadratic equation. To show this, let RS5a and RP1
5x in Fig. 4.2. Then, by the property of the golden section,
a:x5x:(a2x), and on multiplying means and extremes we have the equation
x2 5a2 2ax. This is a quadratic equation of type 1, as described in
chapter 3, and Pythagoras could have learned from the Babylonians how to
solve this equation algebraically. If a is a rational number, however,
then there is no rational number x satisfying the equation. Did
Pythagoras realize this? It seems unlikely. Perhaps instead of the
Babylonian algebraic type of solution, the Pythagoreans may have adopted
a geometric procedure similar to that found in Euclid’s Elements II.11
and VI.30. To divide a line segment AB in mean and extreme ratio, Euclid
first constructed on the segment AB the square ABCD (Fig. 4.3). Then, he
bisected AC at point E, drew line segment EB, and extended line CEA to F
so that EF5EB. When the square AFGH is completed, point H will be the
point desired, for one can readily show that AB:AH5AH:HB. Knowing what
solution, if any, the earlier Pythagoreans used for the golden section
would go far toward clarifying the problem of the level and the
characteristics of pre-Socratic mathematics. If Pythagorean mathematics
began under a Babylonian aegis, with strong faith that all is number,
how (and when) did it happen that this gave way to the familiar emphasis
on pure geometry that is so firmly enshrined in the classical
treatises?</p>
<p>Number Mysticism</p>
<p>Number mysticism was not original with the Pythagoreans. The number
7, for example, had been singled out for special awe, presumably on
account of the seven wandering stars or planets from which the week
(hence our names for the days of the week) is derived. The Pythagoreans
were not the only people who fancied that the odd numbers had male
attributes and the even female—with the related (and not unprejudiced)
assumption, found as late as Shakespeare, that “there is divinity in odd
numbers.” Many early civilizations shared various aspects of numerology,
but the Pythagoreans carried number worship to its extreme, basing their
philosophy and their way of life on it. The number 1, they argued, is
the generator of numbers and the number of reason; the number 2 is the
first even or female number, the number of opinion; 3 is the first true
male number, the number of harmony, being composed of unity and
diversity; 4 is the number of justice or retribution, indicating the
squaring of accounts; 5 is the number of marriage, the union of the
first true male and female numbers; and 6 is the number of creation.
Each number in turn had its peculiar attributes. The holiest of all was
the number 10, or the tetractys, for it represented the number of the
universe, including the sum of all of the possible geometric dimensions.
A single point is the generator of dimensions, two points determine a
line of dimension one, three points (not on a line) determine a triangle
with area of dimension two, and four points (not in a plane) determine a
tetrahedron with volume of dimension three; the sum of the numbers
representing all dimensions, therefore, is the reversed number 10. It is
a tribute to the abstraction of Pythagorean mathematics that the
veneration of the number 10 evidently was not dictated by the anatomy of
the human hand or foot.</p>
<p>Arithmetic and Cosmology</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, geometry had been not much more than number applied
to spatial extension; it appears that, at first, it may have been much
the same among the Pythagoreans—but with a modification. Number in Egypt
had been the domain of the natural numbers and the unit fractions; among
the Babylonians, it had been the field of all rational fractions. In
Greece, the word “number” was used only for the integers. A fraction was
not looked on as a single entity but as a ratio or relationship between
two whole numbers. (Greek mathematics, in its earlier stages, frequently
came closer to the “modern” mathematics of today than to the ordinary
arithmetic of a generation ago.) As Euclid later expressed it (Elements
V.3), “A ratio is a kind of relation in respect of size of two
magnitudes of the same kind.” Such a view, focusing attention on the
connection between pairs of numbers, tends to sharpen the theoretical or
rational aspects of the number concept and to deemphasize the role of
number as a tool in computation or approximation in mensuration.
Arithmetic now could be thought of as an intellectual discipline as well
as a technique, and a transition to such an outlook seems to have been
nurtured in the Pythagorean school.</p>
<p>If tradition is to be trusted, the Pythagoreans not only established
arithmeticasabranchofphilosophy;theyseemtohavemadeitthebasisof a
unification of all aspects of the world around them. Through patterns of
points, or unextended units, they associated number with geometric
extension; this in turn led them to an arithmetic of the heavens.
Philolaus (died ca. 390 BCE), a later Pythagorean who shared the
veneration of the
tetractysordecad,wrotethatitwas“great,all-powerfulandall-producing, the
beginning and the guide of the divine as of the terrestrial life.” This
view of the number 10 as the perfect number, the symbol of health and
harmony, seems to have provided the inspiration for the earliest
nongeocentric astronomical system. Philolaus postulated that at the
center of the universe, there was a central fire about which the earth
and the seven planets (including the sun and the moon) revolved
uniformly. Inasmuch as this brought to only nine the number of heavenly
bodies (other than the
sphereoffixedstars),thePhilolaicsystemassumedtheexistenceofatenth body—a
“counterearth” collinear with the earth and the central fire— having the
same period as the earth in its daily revolution about the central fire.
The sun revolved about the fire once a year, and the fixed stars were
stationary. The earth in its motion maintained the same uninhabited face
toward the central fire, hence neither the fire nor the counterearth was
ever seen. The postulate of uniform circular motion that the
Pythagoreans adopted was to dominate astronomical thought for more than
2,000 years. Copernicus, almost 2,000 years later, accepted this
assumption without question, and it was the Pythagoreans to whom
Copernicus referred to show that his doctrine of a moving earth was not
so new or revolutionary.</p>
<p>The thoroughness with which the Pythagoreans wove number into their
thoughtiswellillustratedbytheirconcernforfiguratenumbers.Althoughno
triangle can be formed by fewer than three points, it is possible to
have triangles of a larger number of points, such as six, ten, or
fifteen (see Fig. 4.4).</p>

<p>were called triangular, and the triangular pattern for the number 10,
the holy tetractys, vied with the pentagon for veneration in Pythagorean
number theory. There were, of course, indefinitely many other categories
of privileged numbers. Successive square numbers are formed from the
sequence 11315171?1(2n21), where each odd number in turn was looked on
as a pattern of dots resembling a gnomon (the Babylonian shadow clock)
placed around two sides of the preceding square pattern of dots (see
Fig. 4.4). Hence, the word “gnomon” (related to the word for “knowing”)
came to be attached to the odd numbers themselves.</p>
<p>The sequence of even numbers, 214161?12n5n(n11), produces what the
Greeks called “oblong numbers,” each of which is double a triangular
number. Pentagonal patterns of points illustrated the pentagonal numbers
given by the sequence</p>

<p>2</p>
<p>and hexagonal numbers were derived from the sequence</p>
<p>115191?1ð4n23Þ52n2 2n:</p>
<p>In a similar manner, polygonal numbers of all orders are designated;
the process, of course, is easily extended to three-dimensional space,
where one deals with polyhedral numbers. Emboldened by such views,
Philolaus is reported to have maintained that</p>
<p>All things which can be known have number; for it is not possible
that without number anything can be either conceived or known.</p>
<p>The dictum of Philolaus seems to have been a tenet of the Pythagorean
school; hence, stories arose about the discovery by Pythagoras of some
simple laws of music. Pythagoras is reputed to have noticed that when
the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of simple
whole numbers, such as 2 to 3 (for the fifth) or as 3 to 4 (for the
fourth), the tones will be harmonious. If, in other words, a string
sounds the note C when plucked, then a similar string twice as long will
sound the note C an octave below, and tones between these two notes are
emitted by strings whose lengths are given by intermediate ratios: 16:9
for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in
ascending order. Here we have perhaps the earliest quantitative laws of
acoustics—possibly the oldest of all quantitative physical laws. So
boldly imaginative were the early Pythagoreans that they hastily
extrapolated to conclude that the heavenly bodies in their motions
similarly emitted harmonious tones, the “harmony of the spheres.”
Pythagorean science, like Pythagorean mathematics, seems to have been an
odd congeries of sober thought and fanciful speculation. The doctrine of
a spherical earth is often ascribed to Pythagoras, but it is not known
whether this conclusion was based on observation (perhaps of new
constellations as Pythagoras traveled southward) or on imagination. The
very idea that the universe is a “cosmos,” or a harmoniously ordered
whole, seems to be a related Pythagorean contribution—one that at the
time had little basis in direct observation but that has been enormously
fruitful in the development of astronomy. As we smile at ancient number
fancies, we should at the same time be aware of the impulse these gave
to the development of both mathematics and science. The Pythagoreans
were among the earliest people to believe that the operations of nature
could be understood through mathematics.</p>
<p>Proportions</p>
<p>Proclus, quoting perhaps from Eudemus, ascribed to Pythagoras two
specific mathematical discoveries: (1) the construction of the regular
solids and (2) the theory of proportionals. Although there is question
about the extent to which this is to be taken literally, there is every
likelihood that the statement correctly reflects the direction of
Pythagorean thought. The theory of proportions clearly fits into the
pattern of early Greek mathematical interests, and it is not difficult
to find a likely source of inspiration. It is reported that Pythagoras
learned in Mesopotamia of three means—the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the subcontrary (later called the harmonic)—and of the “golden
proportion” relating two of these: the first of two numbers is to their
arithmetic mean as their harmonic mean is to the second of the numbers.
This relationship is the essence of the Babylonian square-root
algorithm; hence, the report is at least plausible. At some stage,
however, the Pythagoreans generalized this work by adding seven new
means to make ten in all. If b is the mean of a and c, where a,c, then
the three quantities are related according to one of the following ten
equations:</p>
<p>b2a a b2a c</p>
<p>ð1Þ 5 ð6Þ 5 c2b a c2b b b2a a c2a c</p>
<p>ð2Þ 5 ð7Þ 5 c2b b b2a a b2a a c2a c</p>
<p>ð3Þ 5 ð8Þ 5 c2b c c2b a b2a c c2a b</p>
<p>ð4Þ 5 ð9Þ 5 c2b a b2a a</p>
<p>b2a b c2a b</p>
<p>ð5Þ 5 ð10Þ 5 : c2b a c2b a
Thefirstthreeequationsare,ofcourse,theequationsforthearithmetic,the
geometric, and the harmonic means, respectively.</p>
<p>It is difficult to assign a date to the Pythagorean study of means,
and similar problems arise with respect to the classification of
numbers. The study of proportions or the equality of ratios presumably
formed at first a part of Pythagorean arithmetic or theory of numbers.
Later, the quantities a, b, and c entering in such proportions were more
likely to be regarded as geometric magnitudes, but the period in which
the change took place is not clear. In addition to the polygonal numbers
mentioned previously and the distinction between odd and even, the
Pythagoreans at some stage spoke of odd-odd and even-odd numbers, based
on whether the number in question was the product of two odd numbers or
of an odd and an even number, so that sometimes the name “even number”
was reserved for integral powers of two. By the time of Philolaus, the
distinction between prime and composite numbers seems to have become
important. Speusippus, a nephew of Plato and his successor as head of
the Academy, asserted that 10 was “perfect” for the Pythagoreans
because, among other things, it is the smallest integer n for which
there are just as
manyprimesbetween1andnasnonprimes.(Occasionally,primenumbers were called
linear, inasmuch as they are usually represented by dots in one
dimension only.) Neopythagoreans sometimes excluded 2 from the list of
primes on the ground that 1 and 2 are not true numbers, but the
generators of the odd and even numbers. The primacy of the odd numbers
was assumed to be established by the fact that odd1odd is even, whereas
even1even remains even.</p>
<p>To the Pythagoreans has been attributed the rule for Pythagorean
triads given by (m2 21)/2, m, (m2 11)/2, where m is an odd integer, but
inasmuch as this rule is so closely related to the Babylonian examples,
it is perhaps not an independent discovery. Also ascribed to the
Pythagoreans, with doubt as to the period in question, are the
definitions of perfect, abundant, and deficient numbers, based on
whether the sum of the proper divisors of the number is equal to,
greater than, or less than the number itself. According to this
definition, 6 is the smallest perfect number, with 28 next. That this
view was probably a later development in Pythagorean thought is
suggested by the early veneration of 10 rather than 6. Hence, the
related doctrine of “amicable” numbers is also likely to have been a
later notion. Two integers a and b are said to be “amicable” if a is the
sum of the proper divisors of b and if b is the sum of the proper
divisors of a. The smallest such pair are the integers 220 and 284.</p>
