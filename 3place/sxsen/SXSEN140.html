<h4 id="decimal-fractions">Decimal Fractions</h4>
<p>In 1579, Vie`te had urged the replacement of sexagesimal fractions
with decimal fractions. In 1585, an even stronger plea for the use of
the tenscale for fractions, as well as for integers, was made by the
leading mathematician in the Low Countries, Simon Stevin of Bruges.
Under Prince Maurice of Nassau he served as quartermaster and as
commissioner of public works, and for a time he tutored the prince in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In the history of science, as well as in mathematics, Stevin is an
important figure. He and a friend dropped two spheres of lead, one ten
times the weight of the other, from a height of thirty feet onto a board
and found the sounds of their striking the board to be almost
simultaneous. But Stevin’s published report (in Flemish in 1586) of the
experiment has received far less notice than the similar and later
experiment attributed, on very doubtful evidence, to Galileo. On the
other hand, Stevin usually receives credit for the discovery of the law
of the inclined plane, justified by his familiar “wreath of spheres”
diagram, whereas this law had been given earlier by Jordanus
Nemorarius.</p>
<p>Although Stevin was a great admirer of the theoretical treatises of
Archimedes, there runs through the works of the Flemish engineer a
strain of practicality that is more characteristic of the Renaissance
period. Thus, Stevin was largely responsible for the introduction into
the Low Countries of double-entry bookkeeping fashioned after that of
Pacioli in Italy almost a century earlier. Of far more widespread
influence in economic practice, in engineering, and in mathematical
notations was Stevin’s little book with the Flemish title De thiende
(The Tenth), published in Leyden in 1585. A French version titled La
disme appeared in the same year and increased the popularity of the
book.</p>
<p>It is clear that Stevin was in no sense the inventor of decimal
fractions, nor was he the first systematic user of them. As we have
noted, more than incidental use of decimal fractions is found in ancient
China, in medieval Arabia, and in Renaissance Europe; by the time of
Vie<code>te’s forthright advocacy of decimal fractions in 1579, they were generally accepted by mathematicians on the frontiers of research. Among the common people, however, and even among mathematical practitioners, decimal fractions became widely known only when Stevin undertook to explain the system in full and elementary detail. He wished to teach everyone “how to perform with an ease, unheard of, all computations necessary between men by integers without fractions.” He did not write his decimal expressions with denominators, as Vie</code>te
had; instead, in a circle above or after each</p>

<p>digit he wrote the power of ten assumed as a divisor. Thus, the value
of π, approximately, appeared as</p>
<p>Instead of the words “tenth,” “hundredth,” and so on, he used
“prime,” “second,” and so on, somewhat as we still designate the places
in sexagesimal fractions.</p>
