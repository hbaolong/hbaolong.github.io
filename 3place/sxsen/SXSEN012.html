<p>Bees . . . by virtue of a certain geometrical forethought . . . know
that the hexagon is greater than the square and the triangle and will
hold more honey for the same expenditure of material.</p>
<p>—Pappus of Alexandria</p>
<p>Changing Trends</p>
<p>Today, we use the conventional phrase “Greek mathematics” as if it
indicates a homogeneous and well-defined body of doctrine. Such a view
can be very misleading, however, for it implies that the sophisticated
geometry of the Archimedean-Apollonian type was the only sort that the
Hellenes knew. We must remember that mathematics in the Greek world
spanned a time interval from at least 600 BCE to at least 600 CE and
that it traveled from Ionia to the toe of Italy, to Athens, to
Alexandria, and to other parts of the civilized world. The paucity of
surviving works, especially on the lower level, tends to obscure the
fact that our knowledge about the Greek world is far from complete.</p>
<p>The death of Archimedes by the hand of a Roman soldier may have been
inadvertent, but it was truly portentous. Both Perge and Syracuse would
flourish under Roman control, but during its long history, ancient Rome
contributed little to science or philosophy and less to mathematics.
Whether during the Republic or in the days of the Empire, Romans were
little attracted to speculative or logical investigation. The practical
arts of medicine and agriculture were cultivated with some eagerness,
and descriptive geography met with favor. Impressive engineering
projects and architectural monuments were related to the simpler aspects
of science, but Roman builders were satisfied with elementary
rule-of-thumb procedures that called for little in the way of
understanding of the great corpus of theoretical Greek thought. The
extent of Roman acquaintance with science may be judged from the De
architectura of Vitruvius, written during the middle part of the
Augustine Age and dedicated to the emperor. At one point, the author
describes what to him appeared to be the three greatest mathematical
discoveries: the incommensurability of the side and the diagonal of a
cube; the right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5; and Archimedes’
calculation on the composition of the king’s crown. It is sometimes
claimed that impressive works of engineering, such as the Egyptian
pyramids and the Roman aqueducts, imply a high level of mathematical
achievement, but historical evidence does not bear this out.</p>
<p>The two major institutions associated with mathematics in ancient
Greece, the Academy in Athens and the Library in Alexandria, were
subject to several changes in direction before their eventual demise.
The Academy no longer maintained the strong support of mathematical
studies that Plato had made mandatory; by the time of Proclus, a renewed
interest in mathematics can be attributed to its role as safe haven for
Neoplatonists. The Museum and Library at Alexandria no longer benefited
from the support they had been given by the first two Ptolemies, and
even Cleopatra, the last ruling Ptolemy, who is said to have enjoyed the
Museum gatherings, probably could not have persuaded either Antony or
Caesar to fund its scholarly pursuits.</p>
<p>Eratosthenes</p>
<p>When Archimedes sent his Method to Eratosthenes in Alexandria, he
chose as recipient a man who represented the many diverse areas of study
at the Alexandrian library. Eratosthenes (ca. 275–194 BCE) was a native
of Cyrene who had spent much of his early life in Athens. He had
achieved prominence in many fields—poetry, astronomy, history,
mathematics, athletics—when, in middle life, he was called by Ptolemy
III to Alexandria to tutor his son and to serve as head of the library
there.</p>
<p>Today, Eratosthenes is best remembered for his measurement of the
earth—not the first or last such estimate made in antiquity, but by all
odds the most successful. Eratosthenes observed that at noon on the day
of the summer solstice, the sun shone directly down a deep well at
Syene. At the same time in Alexandria, taken to be on the same meridian
and 5,000 stades north of Syene, the sun was found to cast a shadow
indicating that the sun’s angular distance from the zenith was
one-fiftieth of a circle. From the equality of the corresponding angles
S′AZ and S″OZ in Fig. 8.1, it is clear that the circumference of the
earth must be fifty times the distance between Syene and Alexandria.
This results in a perimeter of 250,000 stades. How accurate this
measurement was has been a subject of debate among scholars, partly
because there are differing accounts concerning the length of a stadium.
There is consensus, however, that the result of the measurement was a
remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.1</p>
<p>A contributor to many fields of learning, Eratosthenes is well known
in mathematics for the “sieve of Eratosthenes,” a systematic procedure
for isolating the prime numbers. With all of the natural numbers
arranged in order, one simply strikes out every second number following
the number 2, every third number (in the original sequence) following
the number 3, every fifth number following the number 5, and continues
in this manner to strike out every nth number following the number
n. The remaining numbers, from 2 on, will, of course, be primes.
Eratosthenes also wrote works on means and on loci, but these have been
lost. Even his treatise On the Measurement of the Earth is no longer
extant, although some details from it have been preserved by others,
including Heron and Ptolemy of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Angles and Chords</p>
<p>Like Eratosthenes, in his work on mathematical geography, a number of
astronomers of the Alexandrian Age handled problems that pointed to a
need for systematic relationships between angles and chords. Theorems on
the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern law of
sines.</p>
<p>Aristarchus</p>
<p>Among Eratosthenes’ predecessors was Aristarchus of Samos (ca.
310–ca. 230 BCE), who, according to Archimedes and Plutarch, proposed a
heliocentric system; but whatever he may have written on this scheme has
been lost. Instead, we have an Aristarchan treatise, perhaps composed
earlier (ca. 260 BCE), On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon,
which assumes a geocentric universe. In this work, Aristarchus made the
observation that when the moon is just half-full, the angle between the
lines of sight to the sun and the moon is less than a right angle by
one-thirtieth of a quadrant. (The systematic introduction of the 360°
circle came a little later.) In trigonometric language of today, this
would mean that the ratio of the distance of the moon to that of the sun
(the ratio ME to SE in Fig. 8.2) is sin 3°. Trigonometric tables not
having been developed yet, Aristarchus fell back on a well-known
geometric theorem of the time that now would be expressed in the
inequalities sin α/sin β &lt; α &lt; β &lt; tan α/tan β, where 0° &lt; β
&lt; α &lt; 90°. From these, he derived the conclusion that ; hence, he
asserted that the sun is more than 18, but less than 20, times as far
from the earth as is the moon. This is far from the modern
value—somewhat less than 400—but it is better than the values 9 and 12
that Archimedes ascribed, respectively, to Eudoxus and to Phidias
(Archimedes’ father). Moreover, the method used by Aristarchus was
unimpeachable, the result being vitiated only by the error of
observation in measuring the angle MES as 87° (when in actuality it
should have been about 89° 50’).</p>
<p>FIG. 8.2</p>
<p>Having determined the relative distances of the sun and the moon,
Aristarchus also knew that the sizes of the sun and the moon were in the
same ratio. This follows from the fact that the sun and the moon have
very nearly the same apparent size—that is, they subtend about the same
angle at the eye of an observer on the earth. In the treatise in
question, this angle is given as 2°, but Archimedes attributed to
Aristarchus the much better value of . From this ratio, Aristarchus was
able to find an approximation for the sizes of the sun and the moon, as
compared with the size of the earth. From lunar eclipse observations, he
concluded that the breadth of the shadow cast by the earth at the
distance of the moon was twice the width of the moon. Then, if Rs, Re,
and Rm are the radii of the sun, the earth, and the moon, respectively,
and if Ds and Dm are the distances of the sun and the moon from the
earth, then, from the similarity of triangles BCD and ABE (Fig. 8.3),
one has the proportion (Re − 2Rm)/(Rs − Re) = Dm/Ds. If in this equation
one replaces Ds and Rs with the approximate values 19Dm and 19Rm, one
obtains the equation or . Here the actual computations of Aristarchus
have been considerably simplified. His reasoning was in reality much
more carefully carried out and led to the conclusion that</p>
<p>FIG. 8.3</p>
<p>Hipparchus of Nicaea</p>
<p>For some two and a half centuries, from Hippocrates to Eratosthenes,
Greek mathematicians had studied relationships between lines and circles
and had applied these in a variety of astronomical problems, but no
systematic trigonometry had resulted. Then, presumably during the second
half of the second century, the first trigonometric table apparently was
compiled by the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 180–ca. 125 BCE).
Aristarchus had known that in a given circle, the ratio of arc to chord
decreased as the angle decreases from 180° to 0°, tending toward a limit
of 1. Yet it appears that not until Hipparchus undertook the task had
anyone tabulated corresponding values of arc and chord for a whole
series of angles. It has, however, been suggested that Apollonius may
have anticipated Hipparchus in this respect, and that the contribution
of the latter to trigonometry was simply the calculation of a better set
of chords than had been drawn up by his predecessors. Hipparchus
evidently drew up his tables for use in his astronomy. He was a
transitional figure between Babylonian astronomy and the work of
Ptolemy. The chief contributions attributed to Hipparchus in astronomy
were his organization of the empirical data derived from the
Babylonians, the drawing up of a star catalogue, improvement in
important astronomical constants (such as the length of the month and
the year, the size of the moon, and the angle of obliquity of the
ecliptic), and, finally, the discovery of the precession of the
equinoxes.</p>
<p>It is not known just when the systematic use of the 360° circle came
into mathematics, but it seems to be due largely to Hipparchus in
connection with his table of chords. It is possible that he took over
from Hypsicles, who earlier had divided the order into 360 parts, a
subdivision that may have been suggested by Babylonian astronomy. Just
how Hipparchus made up his table is not known, for his works are not
extant (except for a commentary on a popular astronomical poem by
Aratus). It is likely that his methods were similar to those of Ptolemy,
to be described further on, for Theon of Alexandria, commenting on
Ptolemy’s table of chords in the fourth century, reported that
Hipparchus had earlier written a treatise in twelve books on chords in a
circle.</p>
<p>Menelaus of Alexandria</p>
<p>Theon also mentions another treatise, in six books, by Menelaus of
Alexandria (ca. 100 CE) dealing with Chords in a Circle. Other
mathematical and astronomical works by Menelaus are mentioned by later
Greek and Arabic commentators, including an Elements of Geometry, but
the only one that has survived—and only through the Arabic
translation—is his Sphaerica. In Book I of this treatise, Menelaus
established a basis for spherical triangles analogous to that of Euclid
I for plane triangles. Included is a theorem without Euclidean
analogue—that two spherical triangles are congruent if corresponding
angles are equal (Menelaus did not distinguish between congruent and
symmetric spherical triangles), and the theorem A + B + C &gt; 180° is
established. The second book of the Sphaerica describes the application
of spherical geometry to astronomical phenomena and is of little
mathematical interest. Book III, the last, contains the well-known
“theorem of Menelaus” as part of what is essentially spherical
trigonometry in the typical Greek form—a geometry or trigonometry of
chords in a circle. In the circle in Fig. 8.4, we should write that
chord AB is twice the sine of half of the central angle AOB (multiplied
by the radius of the circle). Menelaus and his Greek successors instead
referred to AB simply as the chord corresponding to the arc AB. If BOB′
is a diameter of the circle, then chord AB′ is twice the cosine of half
the angle AOB (multiplied by the radius of the circle). Hence, the
theorems of Thales and Pythagoras, which lead to the equation AB2 + AB′2
− 4r2, are equivalent to the modern trigonometric identity sin2θ + cos2θ
= 1. Menelaus, as Hipparchus probably also before him, was familiar with
other identities, two of which he used as lemmas in proving his theorem
on transversals. The first of these lemmas may be stated in modern
terminology as follows. If a chord AB in a circle with center O (Fig.
8.5) is cut in point C by a radius OD, then . The second lemma is
similar: If the chord AB extended is cut in point C′ by a radius OD′
extended, then . These lemmas were assumed by Menelaus without proof,
presumably because they could be found in earlier works, possibly in
Hipparchus’s twelve books on chords. (The reader can easily prove the
lemmas by drawing AO and BO, dropping perpendiculars from A and B to OD,
and using similar triangles.)</p>
<p>FIG. 8.4</p>
<p>FIG. 8.5</p>
<p>It is probable that the “theorem of Menelaus” for the case of plane
triangles had been known to Euclid, perhaps having appeared in the lost
Porisms. The theorem in the plane states that if the sides AB, BC, CA of
a triangle are cut by a transversal in points D, E, F, respectively
(Fig. 8.6), then AD · BE · CF = BD · CE · AF. In other words, any line
cuts the sides of a triangle so that the product of three nonadjacent
segments equals the product of the other three, as can readily be proved
by elementary geometry or through the application of simple
trigonometric relationships. The theorem was assumed by Menelaus to be
well known to his contemporaries, but he went on to extend it to
spherical triangles in a form equivalent to sinAD sinBE sinCF = sinBD
sinCE sinAF. If sensed segments are used, rather than absolute
magnitudes, the two products are equal in magnitude but differ in
sign.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.6</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Almagest</p>
<p>By far the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all
antiquity was the Mathematical Syntaxis, a work in thirteen books
composed by Ptolemy of Alexandria about half a century after Menelaus.
This celebrated Mathematical Synthesis was distinguished from another
group of astronomical treatises by other authors (including Aristarchus)
by referring to that of Ptolemy as the “greater” collection and to that
of Aristarchus et al. as the “lesser” collection.</p>
<p>From the frequent reference to the former as megiste, there arose
later in Arabia the custom of calling Ptolemy’s book Almagest (“the
greatest”), and it is by this name that the work has since been
known.</p>
<p>Of the life of its author, we are as little informed as we are of
that of the author of the Elements. We know that Ptolemy made
observations in Alexandria from 127 to 151 CE, and we therefore assume
that he was born at the end of the first century. Suidas, a writer who
lived in the tenth century, reported that Ptolemy was still alive under
Marcus Aurelius (the emperor from 161 to 180 CE).</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Almagest is presumed to be heavily indebted for its methods
to the Chords in a Circle of Hipparchus. Ptolemy made use of the
catalogue of star positions bequeathed by Hipparchus, but whether
Ptolemy’s trigonometric tables were derived in large part from his
distinguished predecessor cannot be determined. Fortunately, Ptolemy’s
Almagest has survived the ravages of time; hence, we have not only his
trigonometric tables but also an account of the methods used in their
construction. Central to the calculation of Ptolemy’s chords was a
geometric proposition still known as “Ptolemy’s theorem”: If ABCD is a
(convex) quadrilateral inscribed in a circle (Fig. 8.7), then AB · CD +
BC · DA = AC · BD; that is, the sum of the products of the opposite
sides of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the
diagonals. The proof of this is easily carried through by drawing BE so
that angle ABE is equal to angle DBC and noting the similarity of the
triangles ABE and BCD.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.7</p>
<p>Another, and more useful, special case of the general theorem of
Ptolemy is that in which one side—say, AD—is a diameter of the circle
(Fig. 8.8). Then, if AD = 2r, we have 2r · BC + AB · CD = AC · BD. If we
let arc BD = 2α and arc CD = 2β, then BC = 2r sin (α − β), AB = 2r sin
(90° − α), BD = 2r sin α, CD = 2r sin β, and AC = 2r sin (90° − β).
Ptolemy’s theorem therefore leads to the result sin (α − β) = sinα cos β
− cosα sinα. Similar reasoning leads to the formula sin (α + β) = sinα
cosβ + cosα sinβ and to the analogous pair cos (α±β) = cosα cosβ ∓sinα
sinβ. These four sum-and-difference formulas consequently are often
known today as Ptolemy’s formulas.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.8</p>
<p>It was the formula for sine of the difference—or, more accurately,
chord of the difference—that Ptolemy found especially useful in building
up his tables. Another formula that served him effectively was the
equivalent of our half-angle formula. Given the chord of an arc in a
circle, Ptolemy found the chord of half of the arc as follows: let D be
the midpoint of arc BC in a circle with diameter AC = 2r (Fig. 8.9), let
AB = AE, and let DF bisect EC (perpendicularly). Then, it is not
difficult to show that But from elementary geometry, it is known that
DC2 = AC · FC, from which it follows that DC2 = r (2r − AB). If we let
arc BC = 2α, then DC = 2r sinα/2 and AB = 2r cosα; hence, we have the
familiar modern formula . In other words, if the chord of any arc is
known, the chord of half of the arc is also known. Now Ptolemy was
equipped to build up a table of chords as accurate as might be desired,
for he had the equivalent of our fundamental formulas.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.9</p>
<p>The 360-Degree Circle</p>
<p>It should be recalled that from the days of Hipparchus until modern
times, there were no such things as trigonometric ratios. The
Greeks—and, after them, the Hindus and the Arabs—used trigonometric
lines. These at first took the form, as we have seen, of chords in a
circle, and it became incumbent on Ptolemy to associate numerical values
(or approximations) with the chords. To do this, two conventions were
needed: (1) some scheme for subdividing the circumference of a circle
and (2) some rule for subdividing the diameter. The division of a
circumference into 360 degrees seems to have been in use in Greece since
the days of Hipparchus, although it is not known just how the convention
arose. It is not unlikely that the 360-degree measure was carried over
from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve “signs” or
36 “decans.” A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be
made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by
subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts.
Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence.
Moreover, because the Babylonian positional system for fractions was so
obviously superior to the Egyptian unit fractions and the Greek common
fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into
sixty panes minutae primae, each of these latter into sixty partes
minutae secundae, and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that
translators used in this connection that our words “minute” and “second”
were derived.</p>
<p>Our trigonometric identities are easily converted into the language
of Ptolemaic chords through the simple relationships</p>
<p>The formulas become (chord is abbreviated to cd)</p>
<p>where a line over an arc (angle) indicates the supplementary arc.
Note that not only angles and arcs but also their chords were expressed
sexagesimally. In fact, whenever scholars in antiquity wished an
accurate system of approximation, they turned to the sixty-scale for the
fractional portion; this led to the phrases “astronomers’ fractions” and
“physicists’ fractions” to distinguish sexagesimal from common
fractions.</p>
<p>Construction of Tables</p>
<p>Having decided on his system of measurement, Ptolemy was ready to
compute the chords of angles within the system. For example, because the
radius of the circle of reference contained sixty parts, the chord of an
arc of 60 degrees also contained sixty linear parts. The chord of 120°
will be or approximately 103 parts and 55 minutes and 33 seconds or, in
Ptolemy’s Ionic or alphabetic notation, ργp υε′ λγ″. Ptolemy could now
have used his half-angle formula to find the chord of 30°, then the
chord of 15°, and so on, for still smaller angles. Yet, he preferred to
delay the application of this formula and computed instead the chords of
36° and 72°. He used a theorem from Elements XIII.9, which shows that a
side of a regular pentagon, a side of a regular hexagon, and a side of a
regular decagon, all being inscribed within the same circle, constitute
the sides of a right triangle. Incidentally, this theorem from Euclid
provides the justification for Ptolemy’s elegant construction of a
regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Let O be the center of a circle
and AB a diameter (Fig. 8.10). Then, if C is the midpoint of OB and OD
is perpendicular to AB, and if CE is taken equal to CD, the sides of the
right triangle EDO are the sides of the regular inscribed pentagon,
hexagon, and decagon. Then, if the radius OB contains 60 parts, from the
properties of the pentagon and the golden section, it follows that OE,
the chord of 36°, is or about 37.083 or 37p 4′ 5″ or λζpνε″. By the
Pythagorean theorem, the chord of 72° is or approximately 70.536 or 70p
32′ 3″ or opλβ′γ″.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.10</p>
<p>Knowing the chord of an arc of s degrees in a circle, one can easily
find the chord of the arc 180° − s from the theorems of Thales and
Pythagoras, for . Hence, Ptolemy knew the chords of the supplements of
36° and 72°. Moreover, from the chords of 72° and 60°, he found chord
12° by means of his formula for the chord of the difference of two arcs.
Then, by successive applications of his half-angle formula, he derived
the chords of arcs of 6°, 3°, , and , the last two being 1p 34′ 15″ and
0p 47′ 8″, respectively. Through a linear interpolation between these
values, Ptolemy arrived at 1p 2′ 50″ as the chord of 1°. By using the
half-angle formula—or, because the angle is very small, simply dividing
by 2—he found the value of 0p 31′ 25″ for the chord of 30′. This is
equivalent to saying that sin 15’ is 0.00873, which is correct to almost
half a dozen decimal places.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s value of the chord of is, of course, the length of a side
of a polygon of 720 sides inscribed in a circle of radius 60 units.
Whereas Archimedes’ polygon of 96 sides had led to as an approximation
to the value of π, Ptolemy’s is equivalent to 6(0p 31′ 25″) or 3;8,30.
This approximation to π, used by Ptolemy in the Almagest, is the same as
, which leads to a decimal equivalent of about 3.1416, a value that may
have been given earlier by Apollonius.</p>
<p>Ptolemaic Astronomy</p>
<p>Armed with formulas for the chords of sums and differences and chords
of half an arc and having a good value of chord , Ptolemy went on to
build up his table, correct to the nearest second, of chords of arcs
from to 180° for every . This is virtually the same as a table of sines
from to 90°, proceeding by steps of . The table formed an integral part
of Book I of the Almagest and remained an indispensable tool of
astronomers for more than a thousand years. The remaining twelve books
of this celebrated treatise contain, among other things, the beautifully
developed theory of cycles and epicycles for the planets known as the
Ptolemaic system. Like Archimedes, Hipparchus, and most other great
thinkers of antiquity, Ptolemy postulated an essentially geocentric
universe, for a moving earth appeared to be faced with difficulties—such
as lack of apparent stellar parallax and seeming inconsistency with the
phenomena of terrestrial dynamics. In comparison with these problems,
the implausibility of an immense speed required for the daily rotation
of the sphere of the “fixed” stars seemed to shrink into
insignificance.</p>
<p>Plato had set for Eudoxus the astronomical problems of “saving the
phenomena”—that is, producing a mathematical device, such as a
combination of uniform circular motions, which should serve as a model
for the apparent motions of the planets. The Eudoxian system of
homocentric spheres had been largely abandoned by mathematicians in
favor of the system of cycles and epicycles of Apollonius and
Hipparchus. Ptolemy, in turn, made an essential modification in the
latter scheme. In the first place, he displaced the earth somewhat from
the center of the deferent circle, so that he had eccentric orbits. Such
changes had been made before him, but Ptolemy introduced a novelty so
drastic in scientific implication that later Nicholas Copernicus could
not accept it, effective though the device, known as the equant, was in
reproducing the planetary motions. Try as he would, Ptolemy had not been
able to arrange a system of cycles, epicycles, and eccentrics in close
agreement with the observed motions of the planets. His solution was to
abandon the Greek insistence on uniformity of circular motions and to
introduce instead a geometric point, the equant E collinear with the
earth G and the center C of the deferent circle, such that the apparent
angular motion of the center Q of the epicycle in which a planet P
revolves is uniform as seen from E (Fig. 8.11). In this way, Ptolemy
achieved accurate representations of planetary motions, but, of course,
the device was only kinematic and made no effort to answer the questions
in dynamics raised by nonuniform circular movements.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.11</p>
<p>Other Works by Ptolemy</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s fame today is largely associated with a single book, the
Almagest, but there are other Ptolemaic works as well. Among the more
important was a Geography, in eight books, which was as much a bible to
geographers of his day as the Almagest was to astronomers. The Geography
of Ptolemy introduced the system of latitudes and longitudes as used
today, described methods of cartographic projection, and catalogued some
8,000 cities, rivers, and other important features of the earth.
Unfortunately, there was at the time no satisfactory means of
determining longitudes, hence substantial errors were inevitable. Even
more significant was the fact that Ptolemy seems to have made a poor
choice when it came to estimating the size of the earth. Instead of
accepting the figure 252,000 stadia, given by Eratosthenes, he preferred
the value 180,000 stadia that was proposed by Posidonius, a Stoic
teacher of Pompey and Cicero. Hence, Ptolemy thought that the known
Eurasian world was a larger fraction of the circumference than it really
is—more than 180° in longitude, instead of the actual figure of about
130°. This large error suggested to later navigators, including
Columbus, that a voyage westward from Europe to India would not be
nearly so far as it turned out to be. Had Columbus known how badly
Ptolemy had underestimated the size of the earth, he might never have
set sail.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s geographical methods were better in theory than in
practice, for in separate monographs, which have survived only through
Latin translations from the Arabic, Ptolemy described two types of map
projection. Orthographic projection is explained in the Analemma, the
earliest account we have of this method, although it may have been used
by Hipparchus. In this transformation from a sphere to a plane, points
on the spherical surface are projected orthogonally on three mutually
perpendicular planes. In the Planisphaerium, Ptolemy described the
stereographic projection in which points on the sphere are projected by
lines from a pole onto a plane—in Ptolemy’s case, from the South Pole to
the plane of the equator. He knew that under such a transformation, a
circle not through the pole of projection went into a circle in the
plane, and that a circle through the pole was projected into a straight
line. Ptolemy was also aware of the important fact that such a
transformation is conformal, that is, angles are preserved. Ptolemy’s
importance for geography can be gauged from the fact that the earliest
maps in the Middle Ages that have come down to us in manuscripts, none
before the thirteenth century, had as prototypes the maps made by
Ptolemy more than a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>Optics and Astrology</p>
<p>Ptolemy also wrote an Optics that has survived, imperfectly, through
a Latin version of an Arabic translation. This deals with the physics
and the psychology of vision, with the geometry of mirrors, and with an
early attempt at a law of refraction.</p>
<p>No account of Ptolemy’s work would be complete without mention of his
Tetrabiblos (or Quadripartitum), for it shows us a side of ancient
scholarship that we are prone to overlook. The Almagest is indeed a
model of good mathematics and accurate observational data put to work in
building a sober scientific astronomy, but the Tetrabiblos (or work in
four books) addresses a kind of sidereal religion to which much of the
ancient world had succumbed. Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos argued that one
should not, because of the possibility of error, discourage the
astrologer any more than the physician.</p>
<p>The Tetrabiblos differs from the Almagest not only as astrology
differs from astronomy; the two works also make use of different types
of mathematics. The latter makes good use of synthetic Greek geometry;
the former suggests that the populace in general was more concerned with
arithmetical computation than with rational thought. At least from the
days of Alexander the Great to the close of the classical world, there
was undoubtedly much intercommunication between Greece and Mesopotamia,
and it seems clear that the Babylonian arithmetic and algebraic geometry
continued to exert considerable influence in the Hellenistic world.
Greek deductive geometry, on the other hand, seems not to have been
welcomed in Mesopotamia until after the Arabic conquest.</p>
<p>Heron of Alexandria</p>
<p>Heron of Alexandria is best known in the history of mathematics for
the formula, bearing his name, for the area of a triangle:</p>
<p>where a, b, and c are the sides and s is half of the sum of these
sides, that is, the semiperimeter. The Arabs tell us that “Heron’s
formula” was known earlier to Archimedes, who undoubtedly had a proof of
it, but the demonstration of it in Heron’s Metrica is the earliest that
we have. Although now the formula is usually derived trigonometrically,
Heron’s proof is conventionally geometric. The Metrica, like the Method
of Archimedes, was long lost, until rediscovered at Constantinople in
1896 in a manuscript dating from about 1100. The word “geometry”
originally meant “earth measure,” but classical geometry, such as that
found in Euclid’s Elements and Apollonius’s Conics, was far removed from
mundane surveying. Heron’s work, on the other hand, shows us that not
all mathematics in Greece was of the “classical” type. There evidently
were two levels in the study of configurations—comparable to the
distinction made in numerical context between arithmetic (or theory of
numbers) and logistic (or techniques of computation)—one of which,
eminently rational, might be known as geometry and the other, largely
practical, might better be described as geodesy. The Babylonians lacked
the former but were strong in the latter, and it was essentially the
Babylonian type of mathematics that is found in Heron. It is true that
in the Metrica an occasional demonstration is included, but the body of
the work is concerned with numerical examples in mensuration of lengths,
areas, and volumes. There are strong resemblances between his results
and those found in ancient Mesopotamian problem texts. For example,
Heron gave a tabulation of the areas An, of regular polygons of n sides
in terms of the square of one side sn, beginning with and continuing to
. As was the case in pre-Hellenic mathematics, Heron also made no
distinction between results that are exact and those that are only
approximations.</p>
<p>The gap that separated classical geometry from Heronian mensuration
is clearly illustrated by certain problems set and solved by Heron in
another of his works, the Geometrica. One problem calls for the
diameter, the perimeter, and the area of a circle, given the sum of
these three magnitudes. The axiom of Eudoxus would rule out such a
problem from theoretical consideration, for the three magnitudes are of
unlike dimensions, but from an uncritical numerical point of view, the
problem makes sense. Moreover, Heron did not solve the problem in
general terms but, taking a cue again from pre-Hellenic methods, chose
the specific case in which the sum is 212; his solution is like the
ancient recipes in which only steps, without reasons, are given. The
diameter 14 is easily found by taking the Archimedean value for π and
using the Babylonian method of completing the square to solve a
quadratic equation. Heron simply gives the laconic instructions
“Multiply 212 by 154, add 841, take the square root and subtract 29, and
divide by 11.” This is scarcely the way to teach mathematics, but
Heron’s books were intended as manuals for the practitioner.</p>
<p>Heron paid as little attention to the uniqueness of his answer as he
did to the dimensionality of his magnitudes. In one problem, he called
for the sides of a right triangle if the sum of the area and the
perimeter is 280. This is, of course, an indeterminate problem, but
Heron gave only one solution, making use of the Archimedean formula for
the area of a triangle. In modern notation, if s is the semiperimeter of
the triangle and r the radius of the inscribed circle, then rs + 2s =
s(r + 2) = 280. Following his own cookbook rule, “Always look for the
factors,” he chose r + 2 = 8 and s = 35. Then, the area rs is 210. But
the triangle is a right triangle, hence the hypotenuse c is equal to s −
r or 35 − 6, or 29; the sum of the two sides a and b is equal to s + r,
or 41. The values of a and b are then easily found to be 20 and 21.
Heron says nothing about other factorizations of 280, which, of course,
would lead to other answers.</p>
<p>Principle of Least Distance</p>
<p>Heron was interested in mensuration in all its forms—in optics and
mechanics, as well as in geodesy. The law of reflection for light had
been known to Euclid and Aristotle (probably also to Plato), but it was
Heron who showed by a simple geometric argument, in a work on Catoptrics
(or reflection), that the equality of the angles of incidence and
reflection is a consequence of the Aristotelian principle that nature
does nothing the hard way. That is, if light is to travel from a source
S to a mirror MM′ and then to the eye E of an observer (Fig. 8.12), the
shortest possible path SPE is that in which the angles SPM and EPM′ are
equal. That no other path SP′E can be as short as SPE is apparent on
drawing SQS′ perpendicular to MM′, with SQ = QS′ and comparing the path
SPE with the path SP′E. Because paths SPE and SP′E are equal in length
to paths S′PE and S′P′E, respectively, and inasmuch as S′PE is a
straight line (because angle M′PE is equal to angle MPS), it follows
that S′PE is the shortest path.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.12</p>
<p>Heron is remembered in the history of science and technology as the
inventor of a primitive type of steam engine, described in his
Pneumatics; of a forerunner of the thermometer; and of various toys and
mechanical contrivances based on the properties of fluids and on the
laws of the simple machines. He suggested in the Mechanics a law (clever
but incorrect) of the simple machine whose principle had eluded even
Archimedes—the inclined plane. His name is also attached to “Heron’s
algorithm” for finding square roots, but this method of iteration was in
reality due to the Babylonians of 2,000 years before his day. Although
Heron evidently learned much of Mesopotamian mathematics, he seems not
to have appreciated the importance of the positional principle for
fractions. Sexagesimal fractions had become the standard tool of
scholars in astronomy and physics, but it is likely that they remained
unfamiliar to the common man. Common fractions were used to some extent
by the Greeks, at first with the numerator placed below the denominator
and later with the positions reversed (and without the bar separating
the two), but Heron, writing for the practical man, seems to have
preferred unit fractions. In dividing 25 by 13, he wrote the answer as .
The old Egyptian addiction to unit fractions continued in Europe for at
least a thousand years after the time of Heron.</p>
<p>The Decline of Greek Mathematics</p>
<p>The period from Hipparchus to Ptolemy, covering three centuries, was
one in which applied mathematics was in the ascendant. It is sometimes
held that mathematics develops most effectively when in close touch with
the world’s work, but the period we have been considering would argue
for the opposite thesis. From Hipparchus to Ptolemy, there were advances
in astronomy and geography, optics and mechanics, but no significant
developments in mathematics outside of trigonometry. Some attribute the
decline to the inadequacies and difficulties in Greek geometric algebra,
others to the cold breath of Rome. In any event, the period during which
trigonometry and mensuration came to the fore was characterized by a
lack of progress, yet it was precisely these aspects of Greek
mathematics that most attracted the Hindu and Arabic scholars who served
as a bridge to the modern world. Before we turn to these peoples,
however, we must look at the Indian summer of Greek mathematics,
sometimes known as the “Silver Age.”</p>
<p>The period that we consider next, from Ptolemy to Proclus, covers
almost four centuries (from the second to the sixth), but our account is
based in large part on only two chief treatises, mere portions of which
are now extant, as well as on a number of works of lesser
significance.</p>
<p>Nicomachus of Gerasa</p>
<p>It should be recalled that in ancient Greece, the word “arithmetic”
meant the theory of numbers, rather than computation. Often Greek
arithmetic had more in common with philosophy than with what we think of
as mathematics; hence, the subject had played a large role in
Neoplatonism during the Later Alexandrian Age. This had been
particularly true of the Introductio arithmeticae of Nicomachus of
Gerasa, a Neopythagorean who lived not far from Jerusalem about the year
100 CE. The author is sometimes held to be of Syrian background, but
Greek philosophical tendencies certainly predominate in his work. The
Introductio of Nicomachus, as we have it, contains only two books, and
it is possible that this is only an abridged version of what was
originally a more extensive treatise. At all events, the possible loss
in this case is far less to be regretted than the loss of seven books of
the Arithmetica of Diophantus. Nicomachus had, so far as we can see,
little mathematical competence and was concerned only with the most
elementary properties of numbers. The level of the work may be judged
from the fact that the author found it expedient to include a
multiplication table up to ι times ι (that is, 10 times 10).</p>
<p>The Introductio of Nicomachus opens with the anticipated Pythagorean
classification of numbers into even and odd, then into evenly even
(powers of two) and evenly odd (2n · p, where p is odd and p &gt; 1 and
n &gt; 1) and oddly even (2 · p, where p is odd and p &gt; 1). Prime,
composite, and perfect numbers are defined, and a description of the
sieve of Eratosthenes is included, as well as a list of the first four
perfect numbers (6 and 28 and 496 and 8,128). The work also includes a
classification of ratios and combinations of ratios (ratios of integers
are essential in the Pythagorean theory of musical intervals), an
extensive treatment of figurate numbers (which had loomed so large in
Pythagorean arithmetic) in both two and three dimensions, and a
comprehensive account of the various means (again a favorite topic in
Pythagorean philosophy). As did some other writers, Nicomachus regarded
the number 3 as the first number in the strict sense of the word, for 1
and 2 were really only the generators of the number system. For
Nicomachus, numbers were endowed with such qualities as better or worse,
younger or older, and they could transmit characters, as parents to
their progeny. Despite such arithmetical anthropomorphism as a
background, the Introductio contains a moderately sophisticated theorem.
Nicomachus noticed that if the odd integers are grouped in the pattern
1; 3 + 5; 7 + 9 + 11; 13 + 15 + 17 + 19; . . . , the successive sums are
the cubes of the integers. This observation, coupled with the early
Pythagorean recognition that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2,
leads to the conclusion that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is
equal to the square of the sum of the first n integers.</p>
<p>Diophantus of Alexandria</p>
<p>We have seen that Greek mathematics was not uniformly on a high
level, for the glorious period of the third century BCE had been
followed by a decline, perhaps to some extent arrested in the days of
Ptolemy, but not effectively reversed until the century of the “Silver
Age,” about 250 CE to 350. At the beginning of this period, also known
as the Later Alexandrian Age, we find the leading Greek algebraist
Diophantus of Alexandria, and toward its close there appeared the last
significant Greek geometer, Pappus of Alexandria. No other city has been
the center of mathematical activity for so long a period as was
Alexandria from the days of Euclid (ca. 300 BCE) to the time of Hypatia
(415 CE).</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the life of Diophantus is so great that we do not
definitely know in which century he lived. Generally, he is assumed to
have flourished about 250 CE. According to a tradition that is reported
in a collection of problems known as the Greek Anthology (described
further on):</p>
<p>God granted him to be a boy for the sixth part of his life, and
adding a twelfth part to this, He clothed his cheeks with down; He lit
him the light of wedlock after a seventh part, and five years after his
marriage He granted him a son. Alas! late-born wretched child; after
attaining the measure of half his father’s life, chill Fate took him.
After consoling his grief by this science of numbers for four years he
ended his life (Cohen and Drabkin 1958; p. 27).</p>
<p>If this conundrum is historically accurate, Diophantus lived to be
eighty-four years old.</p>
<p>Diophantus is often called the father of algebra, but we shall see
that such a designation is not to be taken literally. His work is not at
all the type of material that forms the basis of modern elementary
algebra, nor is it yet similar to the geometric algebra found in Euclid.
The chief Diophantine work known to us is the Arithmetica, a treatise
originally in thirteen books, only the first six of which have
survived.</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus was a treatise characterized by a high
degree of mathematical skill and ingenuity. In this respect, the book
can be compared with the great classics of the earlier Alexandrian Age,
yet it has practically nothing in common with these or, in fact, with
any traditional Greek mathematics. It essentially represents a new
branch and makes use of a different approach. Being divorced from
geometric methods, it resembles Babylonian algebra to a large extent.
But whereas Babylonian mathematicians had been concerned primarily with
the approximate solution of determinate equations as far as the third
degree, the Arithmetica of Diophantus (such as we have it) is almost
entirely devoted to the exact solution of equations, both determinate
and indeterminate. Because of the emphasis given in the Arithmetica to
the solution of indeterminate problems, the subject dealing with this
topic, sometimes known as indeterminate analysis, has since become known
as Diophantine analysis.</p>
<p>Algebra now is based almost exclusively on symbolic forms of
statement, rather than on the customary written language of ordinary
communication in which earlier Greek mathematics, as well as Greek
literature, had been expressed. It has been said that three stages in
the historical development of algebra can be recognized: (1) the
rhetorical or early stage, in which everything is written out fully in
words; (2) a syncopated or intermediate stage, in which some
abbreviations are adopted; and (3) a symbolic or final stage. Such an
arbitrary division of the development of algebra into three stages is,
of course, a facile oversimplification, but it can serve effectively as
a first approximation to what has happened, and within such a framework
the Arithmetica of Diophantus is to be placed in the second
category.</p>
<p>Throughout the six surviving books of the Arithmetica, there is a
systematic use of abbreviations for powers of numbers and for
relationships and operations. An unknown number is represented by a
symbol that resembles the Greek letter (perhaps for the last letter of
arithmos); the square of this appears as ; the cube as Kγ; the fourth
power, called square-square, as ; the fifth power, or square-cube, as ;
and the sixth power, or cube-cube, as KγK. Diophantus was familiar with
the rules of combination equivalent to our laws of exponents. The chief
difference between the Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic
notation is in the lack of special symbols for operations and relations,
as well as of the exponential notation.</p>
<p>Diophantine Problems</p>
<p>If we think primarily of matters of notation, Diophantus has a good
claim to be known as the father of algebra, but in terms of motivation
and concepts, the claim is less appropriate. The Arithmetica is not a
systematic exposition of the algebraic operations or of algebraic
functions or of the solution of algebraic equations. It is instead a
collection of 150 problems, all worked out in terms of specific
numerical examples, although perhaps generality of method was intended.
There is no postulational development, nor is an effort made to find all
possible solutions. No clear-cut distinction is made between determinate
and indeterminate problems, and even for the latter, for which the
number of solutions generally is unlimited, only a single answer is
given. Diophantus solved problems involving several unknown numbers by
skillfully expressing all unknown quantities, where possible, in terms
of only one of them.</p>
<p>Diophantus used much the same approach in indeterminate analysis. In
one problem, it is required to find two numbers such that either when
added to the square of the other will yield a perfect square. This is a
typical instance of Diophantine analysis, in which only rational numbers
are acceptable as answers. In solving the problem, Diophantus did not
call the numbers x and y, but rather x and 2x + 1. Here the second, when
added to the square of the first, will yield a perfect square no matter
what value one chooses for x. Now, it is also required that (2x + 1)2 +
x must be a perfect square. Here Diophantus does not point out the
infinity of possible answers. He is satisfied to choose a particular
case of a perfect square, in this instance the number (2x − 2)2, such
that when equated to (2x + 1)2 + x, an equation that is linear in x
results. Here the result is , so that the other number, 2x + 1, is . One
could, of course, have used (2x − 3)2 or (2x − 4)2 or expressions of
similar form, instead of (2x − 2)2, to arrive at other pairs of numbers
having the desired property. Here we see an approach that comes close to
a “method” in Diophantus’s work: When two conditions are to be satisfied
by two numbers, the two numbers are so chosen that one of the two
conditions is satisfied, and then one turns to the problem of satisfying
the second condition. That is, instead of handling simultaneous
equations on two unknowns, Diophantus operates with successive
conditions, so that only a single unknown number appears in the
work.</p>
<p>The Place of Diophantus in Algebra</p>
<p>Among the indeterminate problems in the Arithmetica are some
involving equations such as x2 = 1 + 30y2 and x2 = 1 + 26y2, which are
instances of the so-called Pell equation, x2 = 1 + py2; again, a single
answer is thought to suffice. In a sense, it is not fair to criticize
Diophantus for being satisfied with a single answer, for he was solving
problems, not equations. The Arithmetica is not an algebra textbook, but
a problem collection in the application of algebra. In this respect,
Diophantus is like the Babylonian algebraists, but his numbers are
entirely abstract and do not refer to measures of grain or dimensions of
fields or monetary units, as was the case in Egyptian and Mesopotamian
algebra. Moreover, he is interested only in exact rational solutions,
whereas the Babylonians were computationally inclined and were willing
to accept approximations to irrational solutions of equations.</p>
<p>We do not know how many of the problems in the Arithmetica were
original or whether Diophantus had borrowed from other similar
collections. Possibly, some of the problems or methods are traceable
back to Babylonian sources, for puzzles and exercises have a way of
reappearing generation after generation. To us today, the Arithmetica of
Diophantus looks strikingly original, but possibly this impression
results from the loss of rival problem collections. Indications that
Diophantus may have been less isolated a figure than has been supposed
are found in a collection of problems from about the early second
century of our era (hence, presumably antedating the Arithmetica), in
which some Diophantine symbols appear. Nevertheless, Diophantus has had
a greater influence on modern number theory than any other nongeometric
Greek mathematician has. In particular, Pierre de Fermat was led to his
celebrated “great” or “last” theorem when he sought to generalize a
problem that he had read in the Arithmetica of Diophantus (II.8): to
divide a given square into two squares.</p>
<p>Pappus of Alexandria</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus is a brilliant work worthy of the
period of revival in which it was written, but it is, in motivation and
content, far removed from the beautifully logical treatises of the great
geometric triumvirate of the earlier Alexandrian Age. Algebra seemed to
be more appropriate for problem solving than for deductive exposition,
and the great work of Diophantus remained outside the mainstream of
Greek mathematics. A minor work on polygonal numbers by Diophantus comes
closer to the earlier Greek interests, but even this cannot be regarded
as approaching the Greek logical ideal. Classical geometry had found no
ardent supporter, with the possible exception of Menelaus, since the
death of Apollonius some four hundred and more years earlier. But during
the reign of Diocletian (284–305 CE), there lived again in Alexandria a
scholar who was moved by the spirit that had possessed Euclid,
Archimedes, and Apollonius.</p>
<p>The Collection</p>
<p>In about 320 CE, Pappus of Alexandria composed a work with the title
Collection (Synagoge), which is important for several reasons. In the
first place, it provides a most valuable historical record of parts of
Greek mathematics that otherwise would be unknown to us. For instance,
it is in Book V of the Collection that we learn of Archimedes’ discovery
of the thirteen semiregular polyhedra or “Archimedean solids.” Then,
too, the Collection includes alternative proofs and supplementary lemmas
for propositions in Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Ptolemy.
Finally, the treatise includes new discoveries and generalizations not
found in any earlier work. The Collection, Pappus’s most important
treatise, contained eight books, but the first book and the first part
of the second book are now lost.</p>
<p>Book III of the Collection shows that Pappus thoroughly shared the
classical Greek appreciation of the niceties of logical precision in
geometry. Here he distinguishes sharply among “plane,” “solid,” and
“linear” problems—the first being constructible with only circles and
straight lines, the second being solvable through the use of conic
sections, and the last requiring curves other than lines, circles, and
conics. Then, Pappus describes some solutions of the three famous
problems of antiquity, the duplication and the trisection being problems
in the second or solid category and the squaring of the circle being a
linear problem. Here Pappus virtually asserts the fact that the
classical problems are impossible to solve under the Platonic
conditions, for they do not belong among the plane problems; but
rigorous proofs were not given until the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In Book IV, Pappus is again insistent that one should give for a
problem a construction appropriate to it. That is, one should not use
linear loci in the solution of a solid problem or solid or linear loci
in the solution of a plane problem. Asserting that the trisection of an
angle is a solid problem, he therefore suggests methods that make use of
conic sections, whereas Archimedes in one case had used a neusis, or
sliding-ruler type of construction, and in another the spiral, which is
a linear locus. One of the Pappus trisections is as follows. Let the
given angle AOB be placed in a circle with center O (Fig. 8.13) and let
OC be the angle bisector. Draw the hyperbola having A as one focus, OC
as the corresponding directrix, and with an eccentricity equal to 2.
Then, one branch of this hyperbola will cut the circumference of the
circle in a point T such that ∠AOT is one-third ∠AOB.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.13</p>
<p>A second trisection construction proposed by Pappus makes use of an
equilateral hyperbola as follows. Let the side OB of the given angle AOB
be a diagonal of a rectangle ABCO, and through A draw the equilateral
hyperbola having BC and OC (extended) as asymptotes (Fig. 8.14). With A
as center and with radius twice OB, draw a circle intersecting the
hyperbola in P, and from P drop the perpendicular PT to the line CB
extended. Then, it is readily proved, from the properties of the
hyperbola, that the straight line through O and T is parallel to AP and
that ∠AOT is one-third ∠AOB. Pappus gives no source for his trisections,
and we cannot help but wonder whether this trisection was known to
Archimedes. If we draw the semicircle passing through B, having QT as
diameter and M as center, we have essentially the Archimedean neusis
construction, for OB = QM = MT = MB.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.14</p>
<p>In Book III, Pappus also describes the theory of means and gives an
attractive construction that includes the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the harmonic means within a single semicircle. Pappus shows that if in
the semicircle ADC with center O (Fig. 8.15) one has DB ⊥ AC and BF ⊥
OD, then DO is the arithmetic mean, DB the geometric mean, and DF the
harmonic mean of the magnitudes AB and BC. Here Pappus claims for
himself only the proof, attributing the diagram to an unnamed
geometer.</p>
<p>FIG. 8.15</p>
<p>Theorems of Pappus</p>
<p>The Collection of Pappus is replete with bits of interesting
information and significant new results. In many cases, the novelties
take the form of generalizations of earlier theorems, and a couple of
these instances appear in Book IV. Here we find an elementary
generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. If ABC is any triangle (Fig.
8.16) and if ABDE and CBGF are any parallelograms constructed on two of
the sides, then Pappus constructs on side AC a third parallelogram ACKL
equal to the sum of the other two. This is easily accomplished by
extending sides FG and ED to meet in H, then drawing HB and extending it
to meet side AC in J, and finally drawing AL and CK parallel to HBJ. It
is not known whether this generalization, usually bearing the name of
Pappus, was original with Pappus, and it has been suggested that
possibly it was known earlier to Heron. Another instance of
generalization in Book IV, also bearing Pappus’s name, extends theorems
of Archimedes on the shoemaker’s knife. It asserts that if circles C1,
C2, C3, C4, . . ., Cn, . . . are inscribed successively as in Fig. 8.17,
all being tangent to the semicircles on AB and on AC, and successively
to one another, the perpendicular distance from the center of the nth
circle to the base line ABC is n times the diameter of the nth
circle.</p>

<p>FIG. 8.17</p>
<p>The Pappus Problem</p>
<p>Book V of the Collection was a favorite with later commentators, for
it raised a question about the sagacity of bees. Inasmuch as Pappus
showed that of two regular polygons having equal perimeters, the one
with the greater number of sides has the greater area, he concluded that
bees demonstrated some degree of mathematical understanding in
constructing their cells as hexagonal, rather than square or triangular,
prisms. The book goes into other problems of isoperimetry, including a
demonstration that the circle has a greater area, for a given perimeter,
than does any regular polygon. Here Pappus seems to have been closely
following On Isometric Figures, written almost half a millennium earlier
by Zenodorus (ca. 180 BCE), some fragments of which were preserved by
later commentators. Among the propositions in Zenodorus’s treatise was
one asserting that of all solid figures the surfaces of which are equal,
the sphere has the greatest volume, but only an incomplete justification
was given.</p>
<p>Books VI and VIII of the Collection are chiefly on applications of
mathematics to astronomy, optics, and mechanics (including an
unsuccessful attempt at finding the law of the inclined plane). Of far
more significance in the history of mathematics is Book VII, in which,
through his penchant for generalization, Pappus came close to the
fundamental principle of analytic geometry. The only means recognized by
the ancients for defining plane curves were (1) kinematic definitions in
which a point moves the subject to two superimposed motions, and (2) the
section by a plane of a geometric surface, such as a cone or a sphere or
a cylinder. Among the latter curves were certain quartics known as
spiric sections, described by Perseus (ca. 150 BCE), obtained by cutting
the anchor ring or torus by a plane. Occasionally, a twisted curve
caught the attention of the Greeks, including the cylindrical helix and
an analogue of the Archimedean spiral described on a spherical surface,
both of which were known to Pappus, but Greek geometry was primarily
restricted to the study of plane curves, in fact, to a very limited
number of plane curves. It is significant to note, therefore, that in
Book VII of the Collection, Pappus proposed a generalized problem that
implied infinitely many new types of curves. This problem, even in its
simplest form, is usually known as the “Pappus problem,” but the
original statement, involving three or four lines, seems to go back to
the days of Euclid. As first considered, the problem is referred to as
“the locus to three or four lines,” described previously in connection
with the work of Apollonius. Euclid evidently had identified the locus
only for certain special cases, but it appears that Apollonius, in a
work now lost, had given a complete solution. Pappus nevertheless gave
the impression that geometers had failed in attempts at a general
solution and implied that it was he who had first shown the locus in all
cases to be a conic section.</p>
<p>More important, Pappus then went on to consider the analogous problem
for more than four lines. For six lines in a plane, he recognized that a
curve is determined by the condition that the product of the distances
from three of the lines shall be in a fixed ratio to the product of the
distances to the other three lines. In this case, a curve is defined by
the fact that a solid is in a fixed ratio to another solid. Pappus
hesitated to go on to cases involving more than six lines, inasmuch as
“there is not anything contained by more than three dimensions.” But, he
continued, “men a little before our time have allowed themselves to
interpret such things, signifying nothing at all comprehensible,
speaking of the product of the content of such and such lines by the
square of this or the content of those. These things might however be
stated and shown generally by means of compounded proportions.” The
unnamed predecessors evidently were prepared to take a highly important
step in the direction of an analytic geometry that should include curves
of a degree higher than three, just as Diophantus had used the
expressions square-square and cube-cube for higher powers of numbers.
Had Pappus pursued the suggestion further, he might have anticipated
Descartes in a general classification and theory of curves far beyond
the classical distinction between plane, solid, and linear loci. His
recognition that, no matter what the number of lines in the Pappus
problem, a specific curve is determined is the most general observation
on loci in all of ancient geometry, and the algebraic syncopations that
Diophantus had developed would have been adequate to have disclosed some
of the properties of the curves. But Pappus was at heart only a
geometer, as Diophantus had been only an algebraist; hence, Pappus
merely remarked with surprise that no one had made a synthesis of this
problem for any case beyond that of four lines. Pappus himself made no
deeper study of these loci, “of which one has no further knowledge and
which are simply called curves.” What was needed for the next step in
this connection was the appearance of a mathematician equally concerned
about algebra and geometry; it is significant to note that when such a
figure appeared in the person of Descartes, it was this very problem of
Pappus’s that served as the point of departure in the invention of
analytic geometry.</p>
<p>The Treasury of Analysis</p>
<p>There are other important topics in Book VII of the Collection, apart
from the Pappus problem. For one thing, there is a full description of
what was called the method of analysis and of a collection of works
known as the Treasury of Analysis. Pappus describes analysis as “a
method of taking that which is sought as though it were admitted and
passing from it through its consequences in order to something which is
admitted as a result of synthesis.” That is, he recognized analysis as a
“reverse solution,” the steps of which must be retraced in opposite
order to constitute a valid demonstration. If analysis leads to
something admitted to be impossible, the problem will also be
impossible, for a false conclusion implies a false premise. Pappus
explains that the method of analysis and synthesis is used by the
authors whose works constitute the Treasury of Analysis: “This is a body
of doctrine furnished for the use of those who, after going through the
usual elements, wish to obtain power to solve problems set to them
involving curves,” and Pappus lists among the works in the Treasury of
Analysis the treatises on conics by Aristaeus, Euclid, and Apollonius.
It is from Pappus’s description that we learn that Apollonius’s Conics
contained 487 theorems. Because the seven books now extant comprise 382
propositions, we can conclude that the lost eighth book had 105
propositions. About half of the works listed by Pappus in the Treasury
of Analysis are now lost, including Apollonius’s Cutting-off of a Ratio,
Eratosthenes’ On Means, and Euclid’s Porisms.</p>
<p>The Pappus-Guldin Theorems</p>
<p>Book VII of the Collection contains the first statement on record of
the focus-directrix property of the three conic sections. It appears
that Apollonius knew of the focal properties for central conics, but it
is possible that the focus-directrix property for the parabola was not
known before Pappus. Another theorem in Book VII that appears for the
first time is one usually named for Paul Guldin, a seventeenth-century
mathematician: If a closed plane curve is revolved about a line not
passing through the curve, the volume of the solid generated is found by
taking the product of the area bounded by the curve and the distance
traversed during the revolution by the center of gravity of the area.
Pappus was rightfully proud of this very general theorem, for it
included “a large number of theorems of all sorts about curves,
surfaces, and solids, all of which are proved simultaneously by one
demonstration.” There is a possibility that the “Guldin theorem”
represents an interpolation in the manuscript of the Collection. In any
case, the theorem is a striking advance by someone during or following
the long period of decline. Pappus also gave the analogous theorem that
the surface area generated by the revolution of a curve about a line not
cutting the curve is equal to the product of the length of the curve and
the distance traversed by the centroid of the curve during the
revolution.</p>
<p>The End of Alexandrian Dominance</p>
<p>The Collection of Pappus is the last truly significant ancient
mathematical treatise, for the attempt of the author to revive geometry
was not successful. Mathematical works continued to be written in Greek
for about another thousand years, continuing an influence that had begun
almost a millennium earlier, but authors following Pappus never again
rose to his level. Their works are almost exclusively in the form of
commentary on earlier treatises. Pappus himself is in part responsible
for the ubiquitous commentaries that ensued, for he had composed
commentaries on the Elements of Euclid and on the Almagest of Ptolemy,
among others, only fragments of which survive. Later commentaries, such
as those of Theon of Alexandria (fl. 365 CE), are more useful for
historical information than for mathematical results. Theon was
responsible for an important edition of the Elements that has survived;
he is also remembered as the father of Hypatia, who wrote commentaries
on Diophantus and Apollonius and also revised part of her father’s
commentary on Ptolemy. An ardent and influential teacher of pagan
Neoplatonism, Hypatia incurred the enmity of a fanatical Christian mob
at whose hands she suffered a cruel death in 415 CE. The dramatic impact
of her death in Alexandria has caused that year to be taken by some to
mark the end of ancient mathematics; more specifically, it marks the end
of Alexandria as the major mathematical center it had been.</p>
<p>Proclus of Alexandria</p>
<p>Alexandria produced in Proclus (410–485 CE) a young scholar who went
to Athens, where he became one of the last heads of the Academy and a
leader of the Neoplatonic school. Proclus was more a philosopher than a
mathematician, but his remarks are often essential for the history of
early Greek geometry. Of great significance is his Commentary on Book I
of the Elements of Euclid, for, while writing this, Proclus undoubtedly
had at hand a copy of the History of Geometry by Eudemus, now lost, as
well as Pappus’s Commentary on the Elements, largely lost. For our
information on the history of geometry before Euclid, we are heavily
indebted to Proclus, who included in his Commentary a summary or a
substantial extract from Eudemus’s History. This passage, which has come
to be known as the Eudemian Summary, may be taken as Proclus’s chief
contribution to mathematics, although to him is ascribed the theorem
that if a line segment of fixed length moves with its end points on two
intersecting lines, a point on the segment will describe a portion of an
ellipse.</p>
<p>Boethius</p>
<p>During the years when Proclus was writing in Athens, the Roman Empire
in the West was gradually collapsing. The end of the empire is usually
placed at 476 CE, for in this year the incumbent Roman emperor was
displaced by Odoacer, a Goth. Some of the old Roman senatorial pride
remained, but the senatorial party had lost political control. In this
situation, Boethius (ca. 480–524 CE), one of the foremost mathematicians
produced by ancient Rome, found his position difficult, for he came of
an old distinguished patrician family. He was not only a philosopher and
a mathematician but also a statesman, and he probably viewed with
distaste the rising Ostrogothic power. He was the author of textbooks
for each of the four mathematical branches in the liberal arts, but
these were jejune and exceedingly elementary abbreviations of earlier
classics—an Arithmetic that was only an abridgement of the Introductio
of Nicomachus; a Geometry based on Euclid and including only statements,
without proof, of some of the simpler portions of the first four books
of the Elements; an Astronomy derived from Ptolemy’s Almagest; and a
Music that is indebted to the earlier works of Euclid, Nicomachus, and
Ptolemy. In some cases, these primers, used extensively in medieval
monastic schools, may have suffered later interpolations; hence, it is
difficult to determine precisely what is genuinely due to Boethius
himself. It is nevertheless clear that the author was primarily
concerned with two aspects of mathematics: its relationship to
philosophy and its applicability to simple problems of mensuration.</p>
<p>Boethius seems to have been a statesman of high purpose and
unquestioned integrity. He and his sons in turn served as consuls, and
Boethius was among the chief advisers of Theodoric, but for some reason,
whether political or religious, the philosopher incurred the displeasure
of the emperor. It has been suggested that Boethius was a Christian (as
perhaps Pappus was also) and that he espoused Trinitarian views that
alienated the Arian emperor. It is also possible that Boethius was too
closely associated with political elements that looked to the Eastern
Empire for help in restoring the old Roman order in the West. In any
case, Boethius was executed in 524 or 525 CE, following a long
imprisonment. (Theodoric, incidentally, died only about a year later, in
526 CE.) While in prison, he wrote his most celebrated work, De
consolatione philosophiae. This essay, written in prose and verse while
he faced death, discusses moral responsibility in the light of
Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy.</p>
<p>Athenian Fragments</p>
<p>The death of Boethius may be taken to mark the end of ancient
mathematics in the Western Roman Empire, as the death of Hypatia had
marked the close of Alexandria as a mathematical center, but work
continued for a few years longer in Athens. There one found no great
original mathematician, but the Peripatetic commentator Simplicius
(fl. 520 CE) was sufficiently concerned about Greek geometry to have
preserved for us what may be the oldest fragment extant. Aristotle in
the Physica had referred to the quadrature of the circle or of a
segment, and Simplicius took this opportunity to quote “word for word”
what Eudemus had written on the subject of the quadrature of lunes by
Hippocrates. The account, several pages long, gives full details on the
quadratures of lunes, quoted by Simplicius from Eudemus, who in turn is
presumed to have given at least part of the proofs in Hippocrates’ own
words, especially where certain archaic forms of expression are used.
This source is the closest we can come to direct contact with Greek
mathematics before the days of Plato.</p>
<p>Simplicius was primarily a philosopher, but in his day there
circulated a work usually described as the Greek Anthology, the
mathematical portions of which remind us strongly of the problems in the
Ahmes Papyrus of more than two millennia earlier. The Anthology
contained some six thousand epigrams; of these, more than forty are
mathematical problems, presumably collected by Metrodorus, a grammarian
of perhaps the fifth or sixth century. Most of them, including the
epigram in this chapter on the age of Diophantus, lead to simple linear
equations. For example, one is asked to find how many apples are in a
collection if they are to be distributed among six people so that the
first person receives one-third of the apples, the second receives
one-fourth, the third person receives one-fifth, the fourth person
receives one-eighth, the fifth person receives ten apples, and there is
one apple left for the last person. Another problem is typical of
elementary algebra texts of our day: If one pipe can fill a cistern in
one day, a second in two days, a third in three days, and a fourth in
four days, how long will it take all four running together to fill it?
The problems presumably were not original with Metrodorus but were
collected from various sources. Some probably go back before the days of
Plato, reminding us that not all Greek mathematics was of the type that
we think of as classical.</p>
<p>Byzantine Mathematicians</p>
<p>There were contemporaries of Simplicius and Metrodorus who had
training that was adequate for an understanding of the works of
Archimedes and Apollonius. Among these was Eutocius (born ca. 480 CE),
who commented on several Archimedean treatises and on the Apollonian
Conics. We owe to Eutocius the Archimedean solution of a cubic through
intersecting conics, referred to in The Sphere and Cylinder but not
otherwise extant except through the commentary of Eutocius. The
commentary by Eutocius on the Conics of Apollonius was dedicated to
Anthemius of Tralles (fl. ca. 534 CE), an able mathematician and
architect of St. Sophia of Constantinople, who described the string
construction of the ellipse and wrote a work, On Burning-Mirrors, in
which the focal properties of the parabola are described. His colleague
and successor in the building of St. Sophia, Isidore of Miletus (fl. 520
CE), was also a mathematician of some ability. It was Isidore who made
known the commentaries of Eutocius and spurred a revival of interest in
the works of Archimedes and Apollonius. To him perhaps we owe the
familiar T-square and string construction of the parabola—and possibly
also the apocryphal Book XV of Euclid’s Elements. It may be in large
measure due to the activities of the Constantinople group—Eutocius,
Isidore, and Anthemius—that Greek versions of Archimedean works and of
the first four books of Apollonius’s Conics have survived to this
day.</p>
<p>When in 527 CE Justinian became emperor in the East, he evidently
felt that the pagan learning of the philosophical schools in Athens was
a threat to orthodox Christianity; hence, in 529 CE the philosophical
schools were closed and the scholars dispersed. About this time,
Simplicius and some of the other philosophers looked to the East for a
haven, which they found in Persia, where under Sassanid rule they
established what has been called the “Athenian Academy in Exile.” The
date 529 CE is therefore often taken to mark the close of European
mathematical development in antiquity. Henceforth, the seeds of Greek
science were to develop in Near and Far Eastern countries until, some
600 years later, the Latin world was in a more receptive mood. The date
529 CE has another significance that may be taken as symptomatic of a
change in values—in this year, the venerable monastery of Monte Cassino
was established.</p>
<p>Greek mathematics did not, of course, entirely disappear from Europe
in 529 CE, for commentaries continued to be written in Greek in the
Byzantine Empire, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and copied.
During the days of Proclus, the Academy at Athens had become a center of
Neoplatonic learning. Neoplatonic thought exerted a strong influence in
the Eastern Empire, which accounts for commentaries on Nicomachus’s
Introduction to Arithmetic by John Philoponus in the sixth century and
by Michael Constantine Psellus in the eleventh. Psellus also wrote a
Greek summary of the mathematical quadrivium, as did Georgios Pachymeres
(1242–1316) two centuries later. Both Pachymeres and his contemporary
Maximos Planudes wrote commentaries on the Arithmetic of Diophantus.
These examples show that a thin thread of the old Greek tradition
continued in the Eastern Empire to the very end of the medieval period.
The spirit of mathematics languished, however, where men argued less
about the value of geometry and more about the way to salvation. For the
next steps in mathematical development, we must therefore turn our backs
on Europe and look toward the East.</p>
