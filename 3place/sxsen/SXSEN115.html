<h4 id="fibonacci">Fibonacci</h4>
<p>Fibonacci’s father, Bonaccio, was a Pisan engaged in business in
northern Africa, and his son Leonardo studied under a Muslim teacher and
traveled in Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It therefore was natural that
Fibonacci should have been steeped in Arabic algebraic methods,
including, fortunately, the Hindu-Arabic numerals and, unfortunately,
the rhetorical form of expression. The Liber abaci opens with an idea
that sounds almost modern but that was characteristic of both Islamic
and Christian medieval thought—that arithmetic and geometry are
connected and support each other. This view is, of course, reminiscent
of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, but it was equally accepted in the Latin
Boethian tradition. The Liber abaci, nevertheless, is much more
concerned with number than with geometry. It first describes “the nine
Indian figures,” together with the sign 0, “which is called zephirum
in</p>
<p>Arabic.” Incidentally, it is from zephirum and its variants that our
words “cipher” and “zero” are derived. Fibonacci’s account of
Hindu-Arabic numeration was important in the process of transmission,
but it was not, as we have seen, the first such exposition, nor did it
achieve the popularity of the later but more elementary descriptions by
Sacrobosco and Villedieu. The horizontal bar in fractions, for example,
was used regularly by Fibonacci (and was known earlier in Arabia), but
it was only in the sixteenth century that it came into general use. (The
slanted solidus was suggested in 1845 by Augustus De Morgan.)</p>
<p>The LiberAbaci</p>
<p>The Liber abaci is not a rewarding book for the modern reader, for
after an explanation of the usual algoristic or arithmetic processes,
including the extraction of roots, it stresses problems in commercial
transactions, using a complicated systemof fractionsto compute
exchangesof currency. It is one of the ironies of history that the chief
advantage of positional notation—its applicability to fractions—almost
entirely escaped the users of the HinduArabic numerals for the first
thousand years of their existence. In this respect, Fibonacci was as
much to blame as anyone, for he used three types
offractions—common,sexagesimal,andunit—butnotdecimalfractions.In the
Liber abaci, in fact, the two worst of these systems, unit fractions and
common fractions, are extensively used. Moreover, problems of the
following type abound: If 1 solidus imperial, which is 12 deniers
imperial, is sold for 31 deniers Pisan, how many deniers Pisan should
one obtain for 11 deniers imperial? In a recipe-type of exposition, the
answer is laboriously found to be 28 (or, as we should write it, 28).
Fibonacci customarily placed the fractional part or parts of a mixed
number before the integral part. Instead of writing 11, for example, he
wrote 11, with the juxtaposition of unit fractions and integers implying
addition.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently was fond of unit fractions—or he thought his
readers were—for the Liber abaci includes tables of conversion from
common fractions to unit fractions. The fraction , for instance, is
broken into , and appears as . An unusual quirk in his notation led him
to express the sum of and as 1, the notation meaning in this case</p>
<p>11:</p>
<p>Analogously, in another of the many problems on monetary conversion
in the Liber abaci, we read that if of a rotulus is worth of a
bizantium, then of a bizantium is worth of a rotulus. Pity the poor
medieval businessman who had to operate with such a system!</p>
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence</p>
<p>Much of the Liber abaci makes dull reading, but some of the problems
were so lively that they were used by later writers. Among these is a
hardy perennial that may have been suggested by a similar problem in the
Ahmes Papyrus. As expressed by Fibonacci, it read,</p>
<p>Seven old women went to Rome; each woman had seven mules; each mule
carried seven sacks, each sack contained seven loaves; and with each
loaf were seven knives; each knife was put up in seven sheaths.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the problem in the Liber abaci that has most inspired
future mathematicians was the following:</p>
<p>How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with
a single pair, if in every month each pair bears a new pair which
becomes productive from the second month on?</p>
<p>F ib onac c i</p>
<p>This celebrated problem gives rise to the “Fibonacci sequence” 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,…, un,…, where un 5un 1 1un 2, that is, where each
term after the first two is the sum of the two terms immediately
preceding it. This sequence has been found to have many beautiful and
significant properties. For instance, it can be proved that any two
successive terms are relatively prime and that limp Þ n-Nun1=un is the
golden section ratio ð 521 =2. The sequence is also applicable to
questions in phyllotaxy and organic growth.</p>
<p>A Solution of a Cubic Equation</p>
<p>The Liber abaci was Fibonacci’s best-known book, appearing in another
edition in 1228, but it was evidently not widely appreciated in the
schools, and it did not appear in print until the nineteenth century.
Fibonacci was without doubt the most original and most capable
mathematician of the medieval Christian world, but much of his work was
too advanced to be understood by his contemporaries. His treatises other
than the Liber abaci also contain many good things. In the Flos, dating
from 1225, there are indeterminate problems reminiscent of Diophantus
and determinate problems reminiscent of Euclid, the Arabs, and the
Chinese.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently drew from many and varied sources. Especially
interesting for its interplay of algorithm and logic is Fibonacci’s
treatment of the cubic equation x3 12x2 110x520. The author showed an
attitude close to that of the modern period in first proving the
impossibility of a root in the Euclidean sense, such as a ratio of
integers or a number of the form a1pb, where a and b are rational. As of
that time, this meant that the equation could not be solved exactly by
algebraic means. Fibonacci then went on to express the positive root
approximately as a sexagesimal fraction to half a dozen places—
1;22,7,42,33,4,40. This was a remarkable achievement, but we do not know
how he did it. Perhaps through the Arabs he had learned what we call
“Horner’s method,” a device known before this time in China, as we saw
earlier. This is the most accurate European approximation to an
irrational root of an algebraic equation up to that time or anywhere in
Europe for another 300 years and more. It is characteristic of the era
that Fibonacci should have used sexagesimal fractions in theoretical
mathematical work but not in mercantile affairs. Perhaps this explains
why the Hindu-Arabic numerals were not promptly used in astronomical
tables, such as the Alfonsine Tables of the thirteenth century. Where
the “Physicists’” (sexagesimal) fractions were in use, there was less
urgency in displacing them than there was in connection with the common
and unit fractions in commerce.</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers and Geometry</p>
<p>In 1225, Fibonacci published not only the Flos, but also the Liber
quadratorum, a brilliant work on indeterminate analysis. This, like the
Flos, contains a variety of problems, some of which stemmed from the
mathematical contests held at the court of the emperor Frederick II, to
which Fibonacci had been invited. One of the proposed problems
strikingly resembles the type in which Diophantus had delighted—to find
a rational number such that if 5 is added to, or subtracted from, the
square of the number, the result will be the square of a rational
number. Both the problem and a solution, 3, are given in Liber
quadratorum.</p>
<p>The book makes frequent use of the identities ða2 1b2Þðc2
1d2Þ5ðac1bdÞ2 1ðbc2adÞ2 5ðad 1bcÞ2 1ðac2bdÞ2;</p>
<p>which had appeared in Diophantus and had been widely used by the
Arabs. Fibonacci, in some of his problems and methods, seems to closely
follow the Arabs.</p>
<p>Fibonacci was primarily an algebraist, but he also wrote, in 1220, a
book titled Practica geometriae. This seems to be based on an Arabic
version of Euclid’s Division of Figures (which is now lost) as well as
on Heron’s works on mensuration. It contains, among other things, a
proof that the medians of a triangle divide each other in the ratio 2 to
1 and a three-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem.
Continuing a Babylonian and Arabic tendency, he used algebra to solve
geometric problems.</p>
