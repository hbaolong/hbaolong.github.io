<h4 id="newton">Newton</h4>
<p>Isaac Newton was born prematurely on Christmas Day of 1642, the year
of Galileo’s death. A maternal uncle who was a Cambridge graduate
recognized unusual ability in his nephew and persuaded Isaac’s mother to
enter the boy at Cambridge. Young Newton, therefore, enrolled at Trinity
College in 1661, probably with no thought of being a mathematician, for
he had made no particular study of the subject. Early in his first year,
however, he bought and studied a copy of Euclid, and, shortly
thereafter, he read Oughtred’s Clavis, the Van Schooten Geometria a
Renato Des Cartes, Kepler’s Optics, the works of Vie`te, and, perhaps
most important of all, Wallis’s Arithmetica Infinitorum. Moreover, to
this training we must add the lectures that Barrow gave as Lucasian
professor, which Newton attended, after 1663. Newton also became
acquainted with work of Galileo, Fermat, Huygens, and others.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Newton later wrote to Robert Hooke, “If I have
seen farther than Descartes, it is because I have stood on the shoulders
of giants.”</p>
<p>Early Work</p>
<p>By the end of 1664, Newton seems to have reached the frontiers of
mathematical knowledge and was ready to make contributions of his</p>
<p>own. His first discoveries, dating from the early months of 1665,
resulted from his ability to express functions in terms of infinite
series—the very thing that Gregory was doing in Italy at about that
time, although Newton could scarcely have known of this. In 1665, Newton
also began to think of the rate of change, or fluxion, of continuously
varying quantities, or fluents, such as lengths, areas, volumes,
distances, and temperatures. From that time on, Newton linked together
these two problems—of infinite series and of rates of change—as “my
method.”</p>
<p>During much of 1665 1666, immediately after Newton had earned his
A.B. degree, Trinity College was closed because of the plague, and
Newton went home to live and think. The result was the most productive
period of mathematical discovery ever reported, for it was during these
months, Newton later averred, that he had made four of his chief
discoveries: (1) the binomial theorem, (2) the calculus, (3) the law of
gravitation, and (4) the nature of colors.</p>
<p>The Binomial Theorem</p>
<p>The binomial theorem seems so obvious to us now that it is difficult
to see whyitsdiscoverywassolongdelayed.ItwasonlywithWallisthatfractional
exponents came into common use, and we have seen that even Wallis, the
great interpolator, was unable to write down an expansion for2 1 2
ðx2x2Þ1=2 or ð12x Þ= . It remained for Newton to supply the expansions
as part of his method of infinite series. Discovered in 1664 or 1665,
the binomial theorem was described in two letters of 1676 from Newton to
Henry Oldenburg (1619? 1677), the secretary of the Royal Society, and
published byWallis(withcredittoNewton)inWallis’sAlgebraof1685.Theformof
expression given by Newton (and Wallis) strikes the modern reader as
awkward, but it indicates that the discovery was not just a simple
replacement of an integral power with a fraction; it was the result of
much trial and error on Newton’s part, in connection with divisions and
radicals involving algebraic quantities. Finally, Newton discovered
that</p>
<p>The Extractions of Roots are much shortened by the Theorem</p>
<p>m n P1PQ 5P 1 AQ1</p>
<p>DQ1etc:</p>
<p>3n 4n</p>
<p>where P1PQ stands for a Quantity whose Root or Power or whose Root of
a Power is to be found, P being the first term of that quantity, Q being
the remaining terms divided by the first term and m/n the numerical
Index of the powers of P1PQ …. Finally, in place of the terms that occur
in the course of the work in the Quotient, I shall use A, B, C, D, etc.
Thus A stands for the first term P(m/n); B for the second term (m/n)AQ;
and so on.</p>
<p>This theorem was first announced by Newton in a letter of June 13,
1676, sent to Oldenburg but intended for Leibniz. In a second letter of
October 24 of the same year, Newton explained in detail just how he had
been led to this binomial series. He wrote that toward the beginning of
his study of mathematics, he had happened on the work of Wallis on
finding the area (from x 5 0 to x5x) under curves whose ordinates are of
the form (12x2)n. On examining the areas for exponents n equal to 0, 1,
2, 3, and so on, he found the first term always to be x, the second term
to be 03x3 or 13x3 or 23x3 or 33x3, according as the power of n is 0 or
1 or 2 or 3, and so on. Hence, by Wallis’s principle of “intercalation,”
Newton assumed that the first two terms in the area for n5 should be</p>
<p>x3 x2:</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In the same fashion, proceeding by analogy, he found further terms,
the first five being</p>
<p>x3 x5 x7 x9 x2222:</p>
<p>3 5 7 9</p>
<p>He then realized that the same result could have been found by first
deriving ð12x2Þ1=2 51212x2 218x4 2161 x6 21285 x8 2 , by interpolation
in the same manner, and then finding the area through integration of the
terms in this series. In other words, Newton did not proceed directly
from the Pascal triangle to the binomial theorem but indirectly from a
quadrature problem to the binomial theorem.</p>
