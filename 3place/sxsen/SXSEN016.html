<h4 id="arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic Operations</h4>
<p>The 2/n table in the Ahmes Papyrus is followed by a short n/10 table
for n from 1 to 9, the fractions again being expressed in terms of the
favorites—unit fractions and the fraction . The fraction , for example,
is broken into and and . Ahmes had begun his work with the assurance
that it would provide a “complete and thorough study of all things…and
the knowledge of all secrets,” and therefore the main portion of the
material, following the 2/n and n/10 tables, consists of eighty-four
widely assorted problems. The first six of these require the division of
one or two or six or seven or eight or nine loaves of bread among ten
men, and the scribe makes use of the n/10 table that he has just given.
In the first problem, the scribe goes to considerable trouble to show
that it is correct to give to each of the ten men one tenth of a loaf!
If one man receives of a loaf, two men will receive or and four men will
receive of a loaf or 1 of a loaf. Hence, eight men will receive 1 of a
loaf or 11 of a loaf, and eight men plus two men will receive 111, or a
whole loaf. Ahmes seems to have had a kind of equivalent to our least
common multiple, which enabled him to complete the proof. In the
division of seven loaves among ten men, the scribe might have chosen 1
of a loaf for each, but the predilection for led him instead to and of a
loaf for each.</p>
<p>The fundamental arithmetic operation in Egypt was addition, and our
operations of multiplication and division were performed in Ahmes’s day
through successive doubling, or “duplation.” Our own word
“multiplication,” or manifold, is, in fact, suggestive of the Egyptian
process. A multiplication of, say, 69 by 19 would be performed by adding
69 to itself to obtain 138, then adding this to itself to reach 276,
applying duplation again to get 552, and once more to obtain 1104, which
is, of course, 16 times 69. Inasmuch as 195161211, the result of
multiplying 69 by 19 is 11041138169, that is, 1311. Occasionally, a
multiplication by 10 was also used, for this was a natural concomitant
of the decimal hieroglyphic notation. Multiplication of combinations of
unit fractions was also a part of Egyptian arithmetic. Problem 13 in the
Ahmes Papyrus, for example, asks for the product of 1 and 111; the
result is correctly found to be . For division, the duplation process is
reversed, and the divisor, instead of the multiplicand, is successively
doubled. That the Egyptians had developed a high degree of artistry in
applying the duplation process and the unit fraction concept is apparent
from the calculations in the problems of Ahmes. Problem 70 calls for the
quotient when 100 is divided by 7111; the result,</p>
<p>‘‘He ap’’ P r oble ms</p>
<p>12111, is obtained as follows. Doubling the divisor successively, we
first obtain 1511, then 311, and finally 63, which is 8 times the
divisor. Moreover, of the divisor is known to be 51. Hence, the divisor
when multiplied by 8141 will total 99, which is short of the product 100
that is desired. Here a clever adjustment was made. Inasmuch as 8 times
the divisor is 63, it follows that the divisor when multiplied by will
produce . From the 2/n table, one knows that is</p>
<p>1; hence, the desired quotient is 12111. Incidentally, this procedure
makes use of a commutative principle in multiplication, with which the
Egyptians evidently were familiar.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmes’s problems show knowledge of manipulations of
proportions equivalent to the “rule of three.” Problem 72 calls for the
number of loaves of bread of “strength” 45, which are equivalent to 100
loaves of “strength” 10, and the solution is given as 100/10 3 45, or
450 loaves. In bread and beer problems, the “strength,” or pesu, is the
reciprocal of the grain density, being the quotient of the number of
loaves or units of volume divided by the amount of grain. Bread and beer
problems are numerous in the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 63, for example,
requires the division of 700 loaves of bread among four recipients if
the amounts they are to receive are in the continued proportion : : : .
The solution is found by taking the ratio of 700 to the sum of the
fractions in the proportion. In this case, the quotient of 700 divided
by 1 is found by multiplying 700 by the reciprocal of the divisor, which
is 1. The result is 400; by taking and and and of this, the required
shares of bread are found.</p>
<p>‘‘Heap’’ Problems</p>
<p>The Egyptian problems so far described are best classified as
arithmetic, but there are others that fall into a class to which the
term “algebraic” is appropriately applied. These do not concern specific
concrete objects, such as bread and beer, nor do they call for
operations on known numbers. Instead, they require the equivalent of
solutions of linear equations of the form x1ax5b or x1ax1bx5c, where a
and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as
“aha,” or heap. Problem 24, for instance, calls for the value of heap if
heap and of heap is 19. The solution given by Ahmes is not that of
modern textbooks but is characteristic of a procedure now known as the
“method of false position,” or the “rule of false.” A specific value,
most likely a false one, is assumed for heap, and the operations
indicated on the left-hand side of the equality sign are performed on
this assumed number. The result of these operations is then compared
with the result desired, and by the use of proportions the correct
answer is found. In problem 24, the tentative value of the unknown is
taken as 7, so that x1x is 8, instead of the desired answer, which was
19. Inasmuch as 8ð211Þ519, one must multiply 7 by 211 to obtain the
correct heap; Ahmes found the answer to be 1611. Ahmes then “checked”
his result by showing that if to 1611 one adds of this (which is 211),
one does indeed obtain 19. Here we see another significant step in the
development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a
proof. Although the method of false position was generally used by
Ahmes, there is one problem (Problem 30) in which x1x1x1x537 is solved
by factoring the left-hand side of the equation and dividing 37 by</p>
<p>1111; the result being 16111:</p>
<p>Many of the “aha” calculations in the Rhind (Ahmes) Papyrus appear to
be practice exercises for young students. Although a large proportion of
them are of a practical nature, in some places the scribe seemed to have
had puzzles or mathematical recreations in mind. Thus, Problem 79 cites
only “seven houses, 49 cats, 343 mice, 2401 ears of spelt, 16807
hekats.” It is presumed that the scribe was dealing with a problem,
perhaps quite well known, where in each of seven houses there are seven
cats, each of which eats seven mice, each of which would have eaten
seven ears of grain, each of which would have produced seven measures of
grain. The problem evidently called not for the practical answer, which
would be the number of measures of grain that were saved, but for the
impractical sum of the numbers of houses, cats, mice, ears of spelt, and
measures of grain. This bit of fun in the Ahmes Papyrus seems to be a
forerunner of our familiar nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>As I was going to St. Ives,</p>
<p>I met a man with seven wives;</p>
<p>Every wife had seven sacks,</p>
<p>Every sack had seven cats,</p>
<p>Every cat had seven kits,</p>
<p>Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,</p>
<p>How many were going to St. Ives?</p>
<p>Geometric Problems</p>
<p>It is often said that the ancient Egyptians were familiar with the
Pythagorean theorem, but there is no hint of this in the papyri that
have come down to us. There are nevertheless some geometric problems in
the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 51 of Ahmes shows that the area of an
isosceles triangle was found by taking half of what we would call the
base and multiplying this by the altitude. Ahmes justified his method of
finding the area by suggesting that the isosceles triangle can be
thought of as two right triangles, one of which can be shifted in
position, so that together the two triangles form a rectangle. The
isosceles trapezoid is</p>
<p>Ge ome tr ic P r oble ms</p>
<p>similarly handled in Problem 52, in which the larger base of a
trapezoid is 6, the smaller base is 4, and the distance between them is
20. Taking of the sum of the bases, “so as to make a rectangle,” Ahmes
multiplied this by 20 to find the area. In transformations such as
these, in which isosceles triangles and trapezoids are converted into
rectangles, we may see the beginnings of a theory of congruence and the
idea of proof in geometry, but there is no evidence that the Egyptians
carried such work further. Instead, their geometry lacks a clear-cut
distinction between relationships that are exact and those that are only
approximations.</p>
<p>A surviving deed from Edfu, dating from a period some 1,500 years
after Ahmes, gives examples of triangles, trapezoids, rectangles, and
more general quadrilaterals. The rule for finding the area of the
general quadrilateral is to take the product of the arithmetic means of
the opposite sides. Inaccurate though the rule is, the author of the
deed deduced from it a corollary—that the area of a triangle is half of
the sum of two sides multiplied by half of the third side. This is a
striking instance of the search for relationships among geometric
figures, as well as an early use of the zero concept as a replacement
for a magnitude in geometry.</p>
<p>The Egyptian rule for finding the area of a circle has long been
regarded as one of the outstanding achievements of the time. In Problem
50, the scribe Ahmes assumed that the area of a circular field with a
diameter of 9 units is the same as the area of a square with a side of 8
units. If we compare this assumption with the modern formula A5πr2, we
find the Egyptian rule to be equivalent to giving π a value of about 3,
a commendably close approximation, but here again we miss any hint that
Ahmes was aware that the areas of his circle and square were not exactly
equal. It is possible that Problem 48 gives a hint to the way in which
the Egyptians were led to their area of the circle. In this problem, the
scribe formed an octagon from a square having sides of 9 units by
trisecting the sides and cutting off the four corner isosceles
triangles, each having an area of 4 units. The area of the octagon,
which does not differ greatly from that of a circle inscribed within the
square, is 63 units, which is not far removed from the area of a square
with 8 units on a side. That the number 4(8/9)2 did indeed play a role
comparable to our constant π seems to be confirmed by the Egyptian rule
for the circumference of a circle, according to which the ratio of the
area of a circle to the circumference is the same as the ratio of the
area of the circumscribed square to its perimeter. This observation
represents a geometric relationship of far greater precision and
mathematical significance than the relatively good approximation for
π.</p>
<p>Degree of accuracy in approximation is not a good measure of either
mathematical or architectural achievement, and we should not
overemphasize this aspect of Egyptian work. Recognition by the Egyptians
of interrelationships among geometric figures, on the other hand, has
too often been overlooked, and yet it is here that they came closest in
attitude to their successors, the Greeks. No theorem or formal proof is
known in Egyptian mathematics, but some of the geometric comparisons
made in the Nile Valley, such as those on the perimeters and the areas
of circles and squares, are among the first exact statements in history
concerning curvilinear figures.</p>
<p>The value of is often used today for π; but we must recall that
Ahmes’s value for π is about 3, not 3. That Ahmes’s value was also used
by other Egyptians is confirmed in a papyrus roll from the twelfth
dynasty (the Kahun Papyrus), in which the volume of a cylinder is found
by multiplying the height by the area of the base, the base being
determined according to Ahmes’s rule.</p>
<p>Associated with Problem 14 in the Moscow Papyrus is a figure that
looks like an isosceles trapezoid (see Fig. 2.1), but the calculations
associated with it indicate that a frustum of a square pyramid is
intended. Above and below the figure are signs for 2 and 4,
respectively, and within the figure are the hieratic symbols for 6 and
56. The directions</p>
<p>Reproduction (top) of a portion of the Moscow Papyrus, showing the
problem of the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid, together with
hieroglyphic transcription (below)</p>
<p>Ge ome tr ic P r oble ms</p>
<p>alongside make it clear that the problem calls for the volume of a
frustum of a square pyramid 6 units high if the edges of the upper and
lower bases are 2 and 4 units, respectively. The scribe directs one to
square the numbers 2 and 4 and to add to the sum of these squares the
product of 2 and 4, the result being 28. This result is then multiplied
by a third of 6, and the scribe concludes with the words “See, it is 56;
you have found it correctly.” That is, the volume of the frustum has
been calculated in accordance with the modern formula V5h(a2 1ab1b2)/3,
where h is the altitude and a and b are the sides of the square bases.
Nowhere is this formula written out, but in substance it evidently was
known to the Egyptians. If, as in the deed from Edfu, one takes b50, the
formula reduces to the familiar formula, one-third the base times the
altitude, for the volume of a pyramid.</p>
<p>How these results were arrived at by the Egyptians is not known. An
empirical origin for the rule on the volume of a pyramid seems to be a
possibility, but not for the volume of the frustum. For the latter, a
theoretical basis seems more likely, and it has been suggested that the
Egyptians may have proceeded here as they did in the cases of the
isosceles triangle and the isosceles trapezoid—they may mentally have
broken the frustum into parallelepipeds, prisms, and pyramids. On
replacing the pyramids and the prisms by equal rectangular blocks, a
plausible grouping of the blocks leads to the Egyptian formula. One
could, for example, have begun with a pyramid having a square base and
with the vertex directly over one of the base vertices. An obvious
decomposition of the frustum would be to break it into four parts as in
Fig. 2.2—a rectangular parallelepiped having a volume b2h, two
triangular prisms, each with a volume of b(a2b)h/2, and a pyramid of
volume (a2b)2h/3. The prisms can be combined into a rectangular
parallelepiped with dimensions b and a2b and h; and the pyramid can be
thought of as a rectangular parallelepiped with dimensions a2b and a2b
and h/3. On cutting up the tallest parallelepipeds so that all altitudes
are h/3, one can easily arrange the slabs so as to form three layers,
each of altitude h/3, and having cross-sectional areas of a2 and ab and
b2, respectively.</p>
<p>FIG. 2.2</p>
<p>Problem 10 in the Moscow Papyrus presents a more difficult question
of interpretation than does Problem 14. Here the scribe asks for the
surface area of what looks like a basket with a diameter of 4. He
proceeds as though he were using the equivalent of a formula S5ð12
19Þ12ð22xÞUx; where x is 4, obtaining an answer of 32 units. Inasmuch as
ð12 9Þ is the Egyptian approximation of π/4, the answer 32 would
correspond to the surface of a hemisphere of diameter 4, and this was
the interpretation given to the problem in 1930. Such a result,
antedating the oldest known calculation of a hemispherical surface by
some 1,500 years, would have been amazing, and it seems, in fact, to
have been too good to be true. Later analysis indicates that the
“basket” may have been a roof—somewhat like that of a Quonset hut in the
shape of a half-cylinder of diameter 4 and length 4. The calculation in
this case calls for nothing beyond knowledge of the length of a
semicircle, and the obscurity of the text makes it admissible to offer
still more primitive interpretations, including the possibility that the
calculation is only a rough estimate of the area of a domelike barn
roof. In any case, we seem to have here an early estimation of a
curvilinear surface area.</p>
