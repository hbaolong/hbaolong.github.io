<p>Neglect of mathematics works injury to all knowledge, since he who is
ignorant of it cannot know the other sciences or the things of this
world.</p>
<p>—Roger Bacon</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Time and history are seamless wholes, and any subdivision into
periods is man’s handiwork, but just as a coordinate framework is useful
in geometry, so also the subdivision of events into periods or eras is
convenient in history. For purposes of political history, it has been
customary to designate the fall of Rome in 476 as the beginning of the
Middle Ages and the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 as the
end. For the history of mathematics, let us simply consider the period
500 to 1450 as encompassing mathematics of the Middle Ages. We remind
readers that five great civilizations, writing in five major languages,
make up the bulk of the history of medieval mathematics. In the four
preceding chapters, we described contributions in Greek, Chinese,
Sanskrit, and Arabic from the Byzantine Empire, China, India, and Islam,
four of the five leading medieval cultures. In this chapter, we look at
the mathematics of the Western or Roman Empire, which had no one center
and no single spoken language, but in which Latin was the lingua franca
of scholars.</p>
<p>Compendia of the Dark Ages</p>
<p>The sixth century was a grim period for the countries that had formed
part of the Western Empire. Internal conflicts, invasions, and
migrations left much of the region depopulated and in poverty. Roman
institutions, including the notable school system, were largely defunct.
The growing Christian Church, itself not immune to internal strife, was
only gradually building up an educational system. It is against this
background that we must assess the limited mathematical contributions of
Boethius, as well as Cassiodorus (ca. 480–ca. 575) and Isidore of
Seville (570–636). Neither of the three was particularly adept at
mathematics; their arithmetic and geometric contributions should be seen
in the context of their aiming to supply the monastic schools and
libraries with an introduction to the liberal arts.</p>
<p>Cassiodorus, a contemporary of Boethius, whom he succeeded as
magister officiorum in the service of Theodorus, spent his retirement in
a monastery that he had founded, where he established a library and
instructed the monks in the fine art of accurately copying both Greek
and Latin manuscript texts. This set the stage for an activity that
played a large role in the preservation of ancient texts, both Christian
and “pagan.”</p>
<p>Isidore of Seville, considered by contemporaries to be the most
learned man of his time, was the author of the voluminous Origines or
Etymologies, consisting of twenty books, one of which dealt with
mathematics. It comprised four parts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and
astronomy—the quadrivium. Similar to the Arithmetic of Boethius, the
arithmetic and geometric portions were restricted to elementary
definitions and properties of numbers and figures.</p>
<p>These men are distinguished for being instrumental in preserving
elements of traditional learning in what were truly the “Dark Ages” of
science. For the next two centuries, the gloom continued to such an
extent that it has been said nothing scholarly could be heard in Europe
but the scratching of the pen of the Venerable Bede (ca. 673–735),
writing in England about the mathematics needed to determine the date of
Easter or about the representation of numbers by means of the fingers.
Both topics were significant: the first was necessary to establish the
annual calendar in the Christian era; the second enabled an illiterate
populace to conduct arithmetic transactions.</p>
<p>Gerbert</p>
<p>In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope. He endeavored to
pull his empire out of the doldrums of the Dark Ages and under that
program called on the educator Alcuin of York (ca. 735–804), whom he had
brought to Tours some years earlier, to revitalize education in France.
This brought sufficient improvement to lead some historians to speak of
a Carolingian Renaissance. Alcuin was no mathematician, however;
presumably, he showed Neopythagorean influence in his explanation that
the act of creation had taken six days because 6 was a perfect number.
Beyond some arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy that Alcuin is reputed
to have written for beginners, there was little mathematics in France or
England for another two centuries. In Germany, Hrabanus Maurus (784–856)
continued the slight mathematical and astronomical efforts of Bede,
especially in connection with the computation of the date of Easter. But
not for another century and a half was there any notable change in the
mathematical climate in Western Europe, and then it came in the person
of one who rose ultimately to become Pope Sylvester II.</p>
<p>Gerbert (ca. 940–1003) was born in France, educated in Spain and
Italy, and then served in Germany as tutor and later adviser to the Holy
Roman Emperor Otto III. Having also served as archbishop, first at Reims
and later at Ravenna, Gerbert in 999 was elevated to the papacy, taking
the name Sylvester—possibly in recollection of an earlier pope who had
been noted for scholarship, but more probably because Sylvester I, the
pope during the days of Constantine, symbolized the unity of papacy and
empire. Gerbert was active in politics, both lay and ecclesiastical, but
he also had time for educational matters. He wrote on both arithmetic
and geometry, likely depending on the Boethian tradition, which had
dominated the teaching in Western church schools. More interesting than
these expository works, however, is the fact that Gerbert was perhaps
the first one in Europe to have taught the use of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. It is not clear how he came in contact with these. Moorish
learning included Arabic numeration with the Western, or Gobar (dust),
forms of the numerals, although there is little evidence of Arabic
influence in extant documents. A Spanish copy of the Origines of
Isidore, dating from 992, contains the numerals, without the zero. In
certain manuscripts of Boethius, however, similar numeral forms, or
apices, appear as counters for use on a computing board or an abacus.
The Boethian apices, on the other hand, may themselves have been later
interpolations. The situation with respect to the introduction of the
numerals into Europe is about as confused as is that surrounding the
invention of the system perhaps half a millennium earlier. Moreover, it
is not clear that there was any continued use of the new numerals in
Europe during the two centuries following Gerbert. Not until the
thirteenth century was the Hindu-Arabic system definitively introduced
into Europe, and then the achievement was not the work of one man but of
several.</p>
<p>The Century of Translation</p>
<p>One cannot absorb the wisdom of one’s neighbors if one cannot
understand their language. The Muslims had broken down the language
barrier to Greek culture in the ninth century, and the Latin Europeans
overcame the language barrier to Arabic learning in the twelfth century.
At the beginning of the twelfth century, no European could expect to be
a mathematician or an astronomer, in any real sense, without a good
knowledge of Arabic, and Europe, during the earlier part of the twelfth
century, could not boast of a mathematician who was not a Moor, a Jew,
or a Greek. By the end of the century, the leading and most original
mathematician came from Christian Italy. The period was one of
transition from an older to a newer point of view. The revival began of
necessity with a spate of translations. At first, these were almost
exclusively from Arabic into Latin, but by the thirteenth century there
were many variants—Arabic to Spanish, Arabic to Hebrew, Greek to Latin,
or combinations such as Arabic to Hebrew to Latin.</p>
<p>It is not easy to tell whether the religious crusades had a positive
influence on the transmission of learning, but it is likely that they
disrupted channels of communication more than they facilitated them. At
all events, the channels through Spain and Sicily were the most
important in the twelfth century, and these were largely undisturbed by
the marauding armies of the crusaders between 1096 and 1272. The revival
of learning in Latin Europe took place during, but probably despite, the
crusades.</p>
<p>There were at the time three chief bridges between Islam and the
Christian world—Spain, Sicily, and the Eastern Empire—and of these the
first was the most important. Yet, not all of the major translators
availed themselves of the Spanish intellectual bridge. For example, the
Englishman Adelard of Bath (ca. 1075–1160) is known to have been in
Sicily and the East but seems not to have been in Spain; it is not clear
how he had come into contact with Muslim learning. In 1126, Adelard
translated Khwarizmi’s astronomical tables from Arabic into Latin. In
1142, he produced a major version of the Elements of Euclid, among the
earliest of the mathematical classics to appear in Latin translation
from the Arabic. Adelard’s translation of the Elements did not become
very influential for another century, but it was far from an isolated
event. Later (ca. 1155), he translated Ptolemy’s Almagest from Greek
into Latin.</p>
<p>On the Iberian peninsula, especially at Toledo, where the archbishop
promoted such work, a veritable school of translation was developing.
The city, once a Visigothic capital and later, from 712 to 1085, in
Muslim hands before falling to the Christians, was an ideal spot for the
transfer of learning. In Toledo libraries, there was a wealth of Muslim
manuscripts, and of the populace, including Christians, Mohammedans, and
Jews, many spoke Arabic, facilitating the interlingual flow of
information. The cosmopolitanism of the translators is evident from some
of the names: Robert of Chester, Hermann the Dalmatian, Plato of Tivoli,
Rudolph of Bruges, Gerard of Cremona, and John of Seville, the last a
converted Jew. These are but a small portion of the men associated with
the translation projects in Spain.</p>
<p>Of the translators in Spain, perhaps the most prolific was Gerard of
Cremona (1114–1187). He had gone to Spain to learn Arabic in order to
understand Ptolemy, but he devoted the rest of his life to translations
from the Arabic. Among these exemplary works was the translation into
Latin of a revised version of Thabit ibn-Qurra’s Arabic edition of
Euclid’s Elements; Gerard’s later translation of the Almagest, through
which Ptolemy came chiefly to be known in the West; and translations of
more than eighty other manuscripts.</p>
<p>Among the works of Gerard was a Latin adaptation of the Algebra of
al-Khwarizmi, but an earlier and more popular translation of the Algebra
had been made in 1145 by Robert of Chester. This, the first translation
of al-Khwarizmi’s treatise (as Robert’s translation of the Koran, a few
years before, had marked another “first”), may be taken as marking the
beginning of European algebra. Robert of Chester returned to England in
1150, but the Spanish work of translation continued unabated through
Gerard and others. The works of al-Khwarizmi were evidently among the
more popular subjects of the time, and the names of Plato of Tivoli and
John of Seville are attached to still other adaptations of the Algebra.
Western Europe suddenly took far more favorably to Arabic mathematics
than it ever had to Greek geometry. Perhaps part of the reason for this
is that Arabic arithmetic and algebra were on a more elementary level
than Greek geometry had been during the days of the Roman republic and
empire. The Romans, however, had never displayed much interest in Greek
trigonometry, relatively useful and elementary though it was, yet Latin
scholars of the twelfth century devoured Arabic trigonometry as it
appeared in astronomical works.</p>
<p>Abacists and Algorists</p>
<p>It was during the twelfth-century period of translation and the
following century that confusion arose concerning the name al-Khwarizmi
and led to the word “algorithm.” The Hindu numerals had been explained
to Latin readers by Adelard of Bath and John of Seville at about the
same time that an analogous scheme was introduced to the Jews by Abraham
ibn-Ezra (ca. 1090–1167), an author of books on astrology, philosophy,
and mathematics. As in the Byzantine culture, the first nine Greek
alphabetic numerals, supplemented by a special zero symbol, took the
place of the Hindu numerals, so ibn-Ezra used the first nine Hebraic
alphabetic numerals and a circle for zero in the decimal positional
system for integers. Despite the numerous accounts of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals, the transition from the Roman number scheme was surprisingly
slow. Perhaps this was because computation with the abacus was quite
common, and in this case the advantages of the new scheme are not nearly
so apparent as in calculation with only pen and paper. For several
centuries, there was keen competition between the “abacists” and the
“algorists,” and the latter triumphed definitively only in the sixteenth
century.</p>
<p>A woodcut from Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica (Freiburg,
1503). Arithmetic is instructing the algorist and the abacist, here
inaccurately represented by Boethius and Pythagoras.</p>
<p>Thirteenth-century authors from many walks of life helped popularize
“algorism,” but we shall mention three in particular. One of them,
Alexandre de Villedieu (fl. ca. 1225), was a French Franciscan; another,
John of Halifax (ca. 1200–1256), also known as Sacrobosco, was an
English schoolman; and the third was Leonardo of Pisa (ca. 1180–1250),
better known as Fibonacci, or “son of Bonaccio,” an Italian merchant.
The Carmen de algorismo of Alexandre is a poem in which the fundamental
operations on integers are fully described, using the Hindu-Arabic
numerals and treating zero as a number. The Algorismus vulgaris of
Sacrobosco is a practical account of reckoning that rivaled in
popularity his Sphaera, an elementary tract on astronomy used in the
schools during the later Middle Ages. The book in which Fibonacci
described the new algorism is a celebrated classic, completed in 1202,
but it bears a misleading title—Liber abaci (or Book of the Abacus). It
is not on the abacus; it is a very thorough treatise on algebraic
methods and problems in which the use of the Hindu-Arabic numerals is
strongly advocated.</p>
<p>Fibonacci</p>
<p>Fibonacci’s father, Bonaccio, was a Pisan engaged in business in
northern Africa, and his son Leonardo studied under a Muslim teacher and
traveled in Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It therefore was natural that
Fibonacci should have been steeped in Arabic algebraic methods,
including, fortunately, the Hindu-Arabic numerals and, unfortunately,
the rhetorical form of expression. The Liber abaci opens with an idea
that sounds almost modern but that was characteristic of both Islamic
and Christian medieval thought—that arithmetic and geometry are
connected and support each other. This view is, of course, reminiscent
of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, but it was equally accepted in the Latin
Boethian tradition. The Liber abaci, nevertheless, is much more
concerned with number than with geometry. It first describes “the nine
Indian figures,” together with the sign 0, “which is called zephirum in
Arabic.” Incidentally, it is from zephirum and its variants that our
words “cipher” and “zero” are derived. Fibonacci’s account of
Hindu-Arabic numeration was important in the process of transmission,
but it was not, as we have seen, the first such exposition, nor did it
achieve the popularity of the later but more elementary descriptions by
Sacrobosco and Villedieu. The horizontal bar in fractions, for example,
was used regularly by Fibonacci (and was known earlier in Arabia), but
it was only in the sixteenth century that it came into general use. (The
slanted solidus was suggested in 1845 by Augustus De Morgan.)</p>
<p>The Liber Abaci</p>
<p>The Liber abaci is not a rewarding book for the modern reader, for
after an explanation of the usual algoristic or arithmetic processes,
including the extraction of roots, it stresses problems in commercial
transactions, using a complicated system of fractions to compute
exchanges of currency. It is one of the ironies of history that the
chief advantage of positional notation—its applicability to
fractions—almost entirely escaped the users of the Hindu-Arabic numerals
for the first thousand years of their existence. In this respect,
Fibonacci was as much to blame as anyone, for he used three types of
fractions—common, sexagesimal, and unit—but not decimal fractions. In
the Liber abaci, in fact, the two worst of these systems, unit fractions
and common fractions, are extensively used. Moreover, problems of the
following type abound: If 1 solidus imperial, which is 12 deniers
imperial, is sold for 31 deniers Pisan, how many deniers Pisan should
one obtain for 11 deniers imperial? In a recipe-type of exposition, the
answer is laboriously found to be (or, as we should write it, ).
Fibonacci customarily placed the fractional part or parts of a mixed
number before the integral part. Instead of writing , for example, he
wrote , with the juxtaposition of unit fractions and integers implying
addition.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently was fond of unit fractions—or he thought his
readers were—for the Liber abaci includes tables of conversion from
common fractions to unit fractions. The fraction , for instance, is
broken into , and appears as . An unusual quirk in his notation led him
to express the sum of and as 1, the notation meaning in this case</p>
<p>Analogously, in another of the many problems on monetary conversion
in the Liber abaci, we read that if of a rotulus is worth of a
bizantium, then of a bizantium is worth of a rotulus. Pity the poor
medieval businessman who had to operate with such a system!</p>
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence</p>
<p>Much of the Liber abaci makes dull reading, but some of the problems
were so lively that they were used by later writers. Among these is a
hardy perennial that may have been suggested by a similar problem in the
Ahmes Papyrus. As expressed by Fibonacci, it read,</p>
<p>Seven old women went to Rome; each woman had seven mules; each mule
carried seven sacks, each sack contained seven loaves; and with each
loaf were seven knives; each knife was put up in seven sheaths.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the problem in the Liber abaci that has most inspired
future mathematicians was the following:</p>
<p>How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with
a single pair, if in every month each pair bears a new pair which
becomes productive from the second month on?</p>
<p>This celebrated problem gives rise to the “Fibonacci sequence” 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . ., un, . . ., where un = un−1 + un−2, that is,
where each term after the first two is the sum of the two terms
immediately preceding it. This sequence has been found to have many
beautiful and significant properties. For instance, it can be proved
that any two successive terms are relatively prime and that is the
golden section ratio . The sequence is also applicable to questions in
phyllotaxy and organic growth.</p>
<p>A Solution of a Cubic Equation</p>
<p>The Liber abaci was Fibonacci’s best-known book, appearing in another
edition in 1228, but it was evidently not widely appreciated in the
schools, and it did not appear in print until the nineteenth century.
Fibonacci was without doubt the most original and most capable
mathematician of the medieval Christian world, but much of his work was
too advanced to be understood by his contemporaries. His treatises other
than the Liber abaci also contain many good things. In the Flos, dating
from 1225, there are indeterminate problems reminiscent of Diophantus
and determinate problems reminiscent of Euclid, the Arabs, and the
Chinese.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently drew from many and varied sources. Especially
interesting for its interplay of algorithm and logic is Fibonacci’s
treatment of the cubic equation x3 + 2x2 + 10x = 20. The author showed
an attitude close to that of the modern period in first proving the
impossibility of a root in the Euclidean sense, such as a ratio of
integers or a number of the form , where a and b are rational. As of
that time, this meant that the equation could not be solved exactly by
algebraic means. Fibonacci then went on to express the positive root
approximately as a sexagesimal fraction to half a dozen
places—1;22,7,42,33,4,40. This was a remarkable achievement, but we do
not know how he did it. Perhaps through the Arabs he had learned what we
call “Horner’s method,” a device known before this time in China, as we
saw earlier. This is the most accurate European approximation to an
irrational root of an algebraic equation up to that time or anywhere in
Europe for another 300 years and more. It is characteristic of the era
that Fibonacci should have used sexagesimal fractions in theoretical
mathematical work but not in mercantile affairs. Perhaps this explains
why the Hindu-Arabic numerals were not promptly used in astronomical
tables, such as the Alfonsine Tables of the thirteenth century. Where
the “Physicists’” (sexagesimal) fractions were in use, there was less
urgency in displacing them than there was in connection with the common
and unit fractions in commerce.</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers and Geometry</p>
<p>In 1225, Fibonacci published not only the Flos, but also the Liber
quadratorum, a brilliant work on indeterminate analysis. This, like the
Flos, contains a variety of problems, some of which stemmed from the
mathematical contests held at the court of the emperor Frederick II, to
which Fibonacci had been invited. One of the proposed problems
strikingly resembles the type in which Diophantus had delighted—to find
a rational number such that if 5 is added to, or subtracted from, the
square of the number, the result will be the square of a rational
number. Both the problem and a solution, , are given in Liber
quadratorum. The book makes frequent use of the identities</p>
<p>which had appeared in Diophantus and had been widely used by the
Arabs. Fibonacci, in some of his problems and methods, seems to closely
follow the Arabs.</p>
<p>Fibonacci was primarily an algebraist, but he also wrote, in 1220, a
book titled Practica geometriae. This seems to be based on an Arabic
version of Euclid’s Division of Figures (which is now lost) as well as
on Heron’s works on mensuration. It contains, among other things, a
proof that the medians of a triangle divide each other in the ratio 2 to
1 and a three-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem.
Continuing a Babylonian and Arabic tendency, he used algebra to solve
geometric problems.</p>
<p>Jordanus Nemorarius</p>
<p>It will be clear from the few illustrations we have given that
Fibonacci was an unusually capable mathematician. It is true that he had
no worthy rival during the 900 years of medieval European culture, but
he was not quite the isolated figure he is sometimes held to be. He had
an able, though less gifted, younger contemporary in Jordanus Nemorarius
(1225–1260). Jordanus Nemorarius, or Jordanus de Nemore, represents a
more Aristotelian aspect of science than others we have met in the
thirteenth century, and he became the founder of what is sometimes known
as the medieval school of mechanics. To him, we owe the first correct
formulation of the law of the inclined plane, a law that the ancients
had sought in vain: the force along an oblique path is inversely
proportional to the obliquity, where obliquity is measured by the ratio
of a given segment of the oblique path to the amount of the vertical
intercepted by that path, that is, the “run” over the “rise.” In the
language of trigonometry, this means that F: W = 1/csc θ, which is
equivalent to the modern formulation F = W sin θ, where W is weight, F
is force, and θ is the angle of inclination.</p>
<p>Jordanus was the author of books on arithmetic, geometry, and
astronomy, as well as mechanics. His Arithmetica, in particular, was the
basis of popular commentaries at the University of Paris as late as the
sixteenth century; this was not a book on computation but a
quasi-philosophical work in the tradition of Nicomachus and Boethius. It
contains such theoretical results as the theorem that any multiple of a
perfect number is abundant and that a divisor of a perfect number is
deficient. The Arithmetica is especially significant for the use of
letters instead of numerals as numbers, thus making possible the
statement of general algebraic theorems. In the arithmetical theorems in
Euclid’s Elements VII–IX, numbers had been represented by line segments
to which letters had been attached, and the geometric proofs in
al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra made use of lettered diagrams, but all
coefficients in the equations used in the Algebra are specific numbers,
whether represented by numerals or written out in words. The idea of
generality is implied in al-Khwarizmi’s exposition, but he had no scheme
for expressing algebraically the general propositions that are so
readily available in geometry.</p>
<p>In the Arithmetica, the use of letters suggests the concept of
“parameter,” but Jordanus’s successors generally overlooked his scheme
of letters. They seem to have been more interested in the Arabic aspects
of algebra found in another Jordanian work, De numeris datis, a
collection of algebraic rules for finding, from a given number, other
numbers related to it according to certain conditions, or for showing
that a number satisfying specific restrictions is determined. A typical
instance is the following: if a given number is divided into two parts
such that the product of one part by the other is given, then each of
the two parts is necessarily determined.</p>
<p>It is greatly to his credit that he first stated the rule, equivalent
to the solution of a quadratic equation, completely in general form.
Only later did he provide a specific example of it, expressed in Roman
numerals: to divide the number X into two parts the product of which is
to be XXI, Jordanus follows through the steps indicated previously to
find that the parts are III and VII.</p>
<p>Campanus of Novara</p>
<p>To Jordanus is also attributed an Algorismus (or Algorithmus)
demonstratus, an exposition of arithmetic rules that was popular for
three centuries. The Algorismus demonstratus again shows Boethian and
Euclidean inspiration, as well as Arabic algebraic characteristics.
Still greater preponderance of Euclidean influence is seen in the work
of Johannes Campanus of Novara (fl. ca. 1260), the chaplain to Pope
Urban IV. To him, the late medieval period owed the authoritative
translation of Euclid from Arabic into Latin, the one that first
appeared in printed form in 1482. In making the translation, Campanus
used various Arabic sources, as well as the earlier Latin version by
Adelard. Both Jordanus and Campanus discussed the angle of contact, or
horn angle, a topic that produced lively discussions in the later
medieval period, when mathematics took on a more philosophical and
speculative aspect. Campanus noticed that if one compared the angle of
contact—that is, the angle formed by an arc of a circle and the tangent
at an end point—with the angle between two straight lines, there appears
to be an inconsistency with Euclid’s Elements X.1, the fundamental
proposition of the “method of exhaustion.” The rectilineal angle is
obviously greater than the horn angle. Then, if from the larger angle we
take away more than half, and if from the remainder we take away more
than half, and if we continue in this way, each time taking away more
than half, ultimately we should reach a rectilineal angle less than the
horn angle, but this obviously is not true. Campanus correctly concluded
that the proposition applies to magnitudes of the same kind, and horn
angles are different from rectilineal angles.</p>
<p>Similarity in the interests of Jordanus and Campanus is seen in the
fact that Campanus, at the end of Book IV of his translation of the
Elements, describes an angle trisection that is exactly the same as that
which had appeared in Jordanus’s De triangulis. The only difference is
that the lettering of the Campanus diagram is Latin, whereas that of
Jordanus is Greco-Arabic. The trisection, unlike those in antiquity, is
essentially as follows.</p>
<p>Let the angle AOB that is to be trisected be placed with its vertex
at the center of a circle of any radius OA = OB (Fig. 12.1). From O draw
a radius OC ⊥ OB, and through A place a straight line AED in such a way
that DE = OA. Finally, through O draw line OF parallel to AED. Then,
∠FOB is one-third ∠AOB, as required.</p>

<p>Learning in the Thirteenth Century</p>
<p>In the work of Fibonacci, Western Europe had come to rival other
civilizations in the level of its mathematical achievement, but this was
only a small part of what was taking place in Latin culture as a whole.
Many of the famous universities—Bologna, Paris, Oxford, and
Cambridge—were established in the late twelfth and early thirteenth
centuries, and this was the period in which great Gothic
cathedrals—Chartres, Notre Dame, Westminster, Reims—were built.
Aristotelian philosophy and science had been recovered and were taught
in the universities and the church schools. The thirteenth century is
the period of great scholars and churchmen, such as Albertus Magnus,
Robert Grosseteste, Thomas Aquinas, and Roger Bacon. Two of these,
Grosseteste and Bacon, made strong pleas for the importance of
mathematics in the curriculum, although neither was himself much of a
mathematician. It was during the thirteenth century that many practical
inventions became known in Europe: gunpowder and the compass, both
perhaps from China, and spectacles from Italy, with mechanical clocks
appearing only a little later.</p>
<p>Archimedes Revived</p>
<p>The twelfth century had seen the great tide of translation from
Arabic into Latin, but there now were other crosscurrents of
translations. Most of the works of Archimedes, for example, had been
virtually unknown to the medieval West, but in 1269, William of Moerbeke
(ca. 1215–1286) published a translation (the original manuscript of
which was discovered in 1884 in the Vatican) from Greek into Latin of
the chief Archimedean scientific and mathematical treatises. Moerbeke,
who came from Flanders and was named Archbishop of Corinth, knew little
mathematics; hence, his excessively literal translation (helpful now in
reconstructing the original Greek text) was of limited usefulness, but
from this time on, most of Archimedes’ works were at least accessible.
In fact, the Moerbeke translation included parts of Archimedes’ works
with which the Arabs evidently were not familiar, such as the treatises
On Spirals, the Quadrature of the Parabola, and Conoids and Spheroids.
Nevertheless, the Muslims had been able to make more progress in
understanding the mathematics of Archimedes than did the Europeans
during the medieval period.</p>
<p>During the twelfth century, the works of Archimedes had not
completely escaped the attention of the indefatigable Gerard of Cremona,
who had converted into Latin an Arabic version of the short work
Measurement of the Circle, which was used in Europe for several
centuries. There had also circulated, before 1269, a portion of the
Archimedean Sphere and Cylinder. These two examples could provide only a
very inadequate idea of what Archimedes had done, and, therefore, the
translation by Moerbeke was of the greatest importance, including as it
did a number of major treatises. It is true that the version was only
occasionally used during the next two centuries, but it at least
remained extant. It was this translation that became known to Leonardo
da Vinci and other Renaissance scholars, and it was Moerbeke’s version
that was first printed in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Medieval Kinematics</p>
<p>The history of mathematics has not been a record of smooth and
continuous development; hence, it should come as no surprise that the
upward surge during the thirteenth century should have lost some of its
momentum. There was no Latin equivalent of Pappus to stimulate a revival
of classical higher geometry. The works of Pappus were not available in
Latin or Arabic. Even Apollonius’s Conics was little known, beyond some
of the simplest properties of the parabola that arose in connection with
the ubiquitous treatises on optics, a branch of science that fascinated
the Scholastic philosophers. The science of mechanics, too, appealed to
the scholars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, for now they
had at hand both the statics of Archimedes and the kinematics of
Aristotle.</p>
<p>We noted earlier that the Aristotelian conclusions on motion had not
gone unchallenged and modifications had been suggested, notably by
Philoponus. During the fourteenth century, the study of change, in
general, and of motion, in particular, was a favorite topic in the
universities, especially at Oxford and Paris. At Merton College in
Oxford, the Scholastic philosophers had deduced a formulation for
uniform rate of change that today is generally known as the Merton rule.
Expressed in terms of distance and time, the rule essentially says that
if a body moves with uniformly accelerated motion, then the distance
covered will be that which another body would have covered had it been
moving uniformly for the same length of time with a speed equal to that
of the first body at the midpoint of the time interval. As we should
formulate it, the average velocity is the arithmetic mean of the initial
and terminal velocities. Meanwhile, at the University of Paris, there
was developed a more specific and clear-cut doctrine of impetus than
that proposed by Philoponus. In it, we can recognize a concept akin to
our inertia.</p>
<p>Thomas Bradwardine</p>
<p>The late medieval physicists comprised a large group of university
teachers and churchmen, but we call attention to only two, for these
were also prominent mathematicians. The first is Thomas Bradwardine
(1290?–1349), a philosopher, a theologian, and a mathematician who rose
to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury; the second is Nicole Oresme
(1323?–1382), a Parisian scholar who became the Bishop of Lisieux. To
these two men was due a broadened view of proportionality.</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid had included a logically sound theory of
proportion, or the equality of ratios, and this had been applied by
ancient and medieval scholars to scientific questions. For a given time,
the distance covered in uniform motion is proportional to the speed, and
for a given distance, the time is inversely proportional to the
speed.</p>
<p>Aristotle had thought, none too correctly, that the speed of an
object subject to a moving force acting in a resisting medium is
proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the resistance.
In some respects, this formulation seemed to later scholars to
contradict common sense. When force F is equal to or less than
resistance, a velocity V will be imparted according to the law V = KF/R,
where K is a nonzero constant of proportionality, but when resistance
balances or exceeds force, one should expect no velocity to be acquired.
To avoid this absurdity, Bradwardine made use of a generalized theory of
proportions. In his Tractatus de proportionibus of 1328, Bradwardine
developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally,
what we would call “n-tuple” proportion. His arguments are expressed in
words, but in modern notation we would say that in these cases,
quantities vary as the second or third or nth power. In the same way,
the theory of proportions included subduple or subtriple or sub-n-tuple
proportion, in which quantities vary as the second or third or nth
root.</p>
<p>Now Bradwardine was ready to propose an alternative to the
Aristotelian law of motion. To double a velocity that arises from some
ratio or proportion F/R, he said, it was necessary to square the ratio
F/R; to triple the velocity, one must cube the “proportio,” or ratio
F/R; to increase the velocity n-fold, one must take the nth power of the
ratio F/R. This is tantamount to asserting that velocity is given, in
our notation, by the relationship V = K log F/R, for log (F/R)n = n log
F/R. That is, if V0 = log F0/R0, then Vn = log (F0/R0)n = n log F0/R0 =
nV0. Bradwardine himself evidently never sought experimental
confirmation of his law, and it seems not to have been widely
accepted.</p>
<p>In addition, Bradwardine wrote several other mathematical works, all
pretty much in the spirit of the times. His Arithmetic and his Geometry
show the influence of Boethius, Aristotle, Euclid, and Campanus.
Bradwardine, known in his day as “Doctor profundus,” was also attracted
to topics such as the angle of contact and star polygons, both of which
occur in Campanus and earlier works. Star polygons, which include
regular polygons as special cases, go back to ancient times. A star
polygon is formed by connecting with straight lines every mth point,
starting from a given one, of the n points that divide the circumference
of a circle into n equal parts, where n &gt; 2 and m is prime to
n. There is in the Geometry even a touch of Archimedes’ Measurement of
the Circle. The philosophical bent in all of Bradwardine’s works is seen
most clearly in the Geometrica speculativa and the Tractatus de
continuo, in which he argued that continuous magnitudes, although
including an infinite number of indivisibles, are not made up of such
mathematical atoms but are instead composed of an infinite number of
continua of the same kind. His views are sometimes said to resemble
those of the modern intuitionists; at any rate, medieval speculations on
the continuum, popular among Scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas,
later influenced the Cantorian infinite of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Nicole Oresme</p>
<p>Nicole Oresme lived later than Bradwardine, and in the work of the
former, we see extensions of ideas of the latter. In De proportionibus
proportionum, composed about 1360, Oresme generalized Bradwardine’s
proportion theory to include any rational fractional power and to give
rules for combining proportions that are the equivalents of our laws of
exponents, now expressed in the notations xm · xn = xm + n and (xm)n =
xmn. For each rule, specific instances are given, and the latter part of
another work, the Algorismus proportionum, applies the rules in
geometric and physical problems. Oresme also suggested the use of
special notations for fractional powers, for in his Algorismus
proportionum there are expressions such as</p>
<p>to denote the “one and one-half proportion,” that is, the cube of the
principal square root, and forms such as</p>
<p>for . We now take for granted our symbolic notations for powers and
roots, with little thought for the slowness with which these developed
in the history of mathematics. Even more imaginative than Oresme’s
notations was his suggestion that irrational proportions are possible.
Here, he was striving toward what we should write as , for example,
which is perhaps the first hint in the history of mathematics of a
higher transcendental function, but lack of adequate terminology and
notation prevented him from effectively developing his notion of
irrational powers.</p>
<p>The Latitude of Forms</p>
<p>The notion of irrational powers may have been Oresme’s most brilliant
idea, but it was not in this direction that he was most influential. For
almost a century before his time, Scholastic philosophers had been
discussing the quantification of variable “forms,” a concept of
Aristotle roughly equivalent to qualities. Among these forms were such
things as the velocity of a moving object and the variation in
temperature from point to point in an object with nonuniform
temperature. The discussions were interminably prolix, for the available
tools of analysis were inappropriate. Despite this handicap, the
logicians at Merton College had reached, as we saw, an important theorem
concerning the mean value of a “uniformly difform” form—that is, one in
which the rate of change of the rate of change is constant. Oresme was
well aware of this result, and a brilliant thought occurred to him,
sometime before 1361—why not draw a picture or a graph of the way in
which things vary? Here we see, of course, an early suggestion of what
we now describe as the graphical representation of functions. Marshall
Clagett has found what looks like an earlier graph, drawn by Giovanni di
Cosali, in which the line of longitude is placed in a vertical position
(Clagett 1959, pp. 332–333, 414). The exposition of Oresme surpasses
that of Cosali in clarity and influence, however.</p>
<p>Everything measurable, Oresme wrote, is imaginable in the manner of
continuous quantity; hence, he drew a velocity-time graph for a body
moving with uniform acceleration. Along a horizontal line, he marked
points that represented instants of time (or longitudes), and for each
instant he drew perpendicular to the line of longitudes a line segment
(latitude) the length of which represented the velocity. The end points
of these segments, he saw, lie along a straight line, and if the
uniformly accelerated motion starts from rest, the totality of velocity
lines (which we call ordinates) will make up the area of a right
triangle (see Fig. 12.2). Inasmuch as this area represents the distance
covered, Oresme has provided a geometric verification of the Merton
rule, for the velocity at the midpoint of the time interval is half of
the terminal velocity. Moreover, the diagram obviously leads to the law
of motion generally ascribed to Galileo in the seventeenth century. It
is clear from the geometric diagram that the area in the first half of
the time is to that in the second half in the ratio 1:3. If we subdivide
the time into three equal parts, the distances covered (given by the
areas) are in the ratio 1:3:5. For four equal subdivisions, the
distances are in the ratio 1:3:5:7. In general, as Galileo later
observed, the distances are to one another as the odd numbers, and
because the sum of the first n consecutive odd numbers is the square of
n, the total distance covered varies as the square of the time, the
familiar Galilean law for falling bodies.</p>
<p>FIG. 12.2</p>
<p>The terms “latitude” and “longitude” that Oresme used are in a
general sense equivalent to our ordinate and abscissa, and his graphical
representation is akin to our analytic geometry. His use of coordinates
was not, of course, new, for Apollonius and others before him had used
coordinate systems, but Oresme’s graphical representation of a variable
quantity was novel. He seems to have grasped the essential principle
that a function of one unknown can be represented as a curve, but he was
unable to make any effective use of this observation except in the case
of the linear function. Moreover, Oresme was chiefly interested in the
area under the curve; hence, it is not very likely that he saw that
every plane curve can be represented, with respect to a coordinate
system, as a function of one variable. Where we say that the velocity
graph in uniformly accelerated motion is a straight line, Oresme wrote,
“Any uniformly difform quality terminating in zero intensity is imagined
as a right triangle.” That is, Oresme was more concerned with (1) the
way in which the function varies (that is, the differential equation of
the curve), and (2) the way in which the area under the curve varies
(that is, the integral of the function). He pointed out the
constant-slope property for his graph of uniformly accelerated motion—an
observation equivalent to the modern two-point equation of the line in
analytic geometry and leading to the concept of the differential
triangle. Moreover, in finding the distance function, the area, Oresme
is obviously performing a simple integration geometrically that results
in the Merton rule. He did not explain why the area under a
velocity-time curve represents the distance covered, but it is probable
that he thought of the area as made up of many vertical lines or
indivisibles, each of which represented a velocity that continued for a
very short time.</p>
<p>The graphical representation of functions, known then as the latitude
of forms, remained a popular topic from the time of Oresme to that of
Galileo. The Tractatus de latitudinibus formarum, written perhaps by a
student of Oresme’s, if not by Oresme himself, appeared in numerous
manuscript forms and was printed at least four times between 1482 and
1515, but this was only a précis of a larger work by Oresme titled
Tractatus de figuratione potentiarum et mensurarum. Here, Oresme went so
far as to suggest a three-dimensional extension of his “latitude of
forms,” in which a function of two independent variables was pictured as
a volume made up of all of the ordinates erected according to a given
rule at points in a portion of the reference plane.</p>
<p>Infinite Series</p>
<p>Mathematicians of the Western world in the fourteenth century had
imagination and precision of thought, but they lacked algebraic and
geometric facility; hence, their contributions lay not in extensions of
classical work but in new points of view. Among these was an occupation
with infinite series, an essentially novel topic in the West anticipated
only by some ancient iterative algorithms and Archimedes’ summation of
an infinite geometric progression. Where the Greeks had a horror
infiniti, the late medieval Scholastic philosophers frequently referred
to the infinite, both as a potentiality and as an actuality (or
something “completed”). In England in the fourteenth century, a logician
by the name of Richard Suiseth (fl. ca. 1350), but better known as
Calculator, solved the following problem in the latitude of forms:</p>
<p>If throughout the first half of a given time interval a variation
continues at a certain intensity, throughout the next quarter of the
interval at double this intensity, throughout the following eighth at
triple the intensity and so ad infinitum; then the average intensity for
the whole interval will be the intensity of the variation during the
second subinterval (or double the initial intensity).</p>
<p>This is equivalent to saying that .</p>
<p>Calculator gave a long and tedious verbal proof, for he did not know
about graphical representation, but Oresme used his graphical procedure
to prove the theorem more easily. Oresme also handled other cases, such
as</p>
<p>in which the sum is . Problems similar to these continued to occupy
scholars during the next century and a half.</p>
<p>Among Oresme’s other contributions to infinite series was his proof
that the harmonic series is divergent. He grouped the successive terms
in the series</p>
<p>placing the first term in the first group, the next two terms in the
second group, the next four terms in the third group, and so on, the mth
group containing 2m−1 terms. Then, it is obvious that we have infinitely
many groups and that the sum of the terms within each group is at least
. Hence, by adding together enough terms in order, we can exceed any
given number.</p>
<p>Levi ben Gerson</p>
<p>Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344), a Jewish scholar living in Provence,
contributed a number of mathematical works in Hebrew. Provence then not
being part of France, where Jews were persecuted under Philip the Fair,
Levi ben Gerson benefited from the tolerant support of the Avignon pope
Clement VI and wrote one of his texts at the request of the Bishop of
Meaux. His scholarship was extensive; perhaps best known as a theologian
and a philosopher, he was well versed in numerous disciplines and
appears to have been respected by the educated elite of Provence. He was
an independent thinker, apparently questioning accepted belief in most
areas he studied, whether it was Jewish theology or Ptolemaic
astronomical doctrine.</p>
<p>He wrote the Art of Calculation in 1321, in which he described many
topics later found in courses of so-called higher algebra: extraction of
square roots and cube roots, the summation of series, permutations and
combinations, and binomial coefficients, among others. He provided
proofs using methods not customary at the time. In 1342, he wrote The
Harmony of Numbers, which contains a proof that (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and
(8,9) are the only pairs of consecutive numbers whose only factors are 2
or 3. His chief contributions to geometry consisted of two books, in one
of which he provided a commentary on the first five books of Euclid; he
also provided arguments concerning the independence of the parallel
postulate.</p>
<p>His largest work, The Wars of the Lord, which he wrote between 1317
and 1328, consists of six books. The fifth, a voluminous Astronomy,
translated into Latin at the Avignon court, included his On Sines,
Chords and Arcs, which was also issued separately. This contains his
main discussion of trigonometry, including proof of the sine theorem for
plane triangles and a discussion on the construction of tables for sines
and versed sines. His tables are very accurate down to 3/4°. His
astronomical contributions include descriptions of the Jacob’s staff,
which is used for measuring angular distances, and of other astronomical
measuring instruments, as well as the critique of Ptolemy alluded to
previously, which called for better coincidence of theory and
observation.</p>
<p>Nicholas of Cusa</p>
<p>Oresme had argued that everything measurable can be represented by a
line (latitude), and a mathematics of mensuration, from both a
theoretical and a practical standpoint, would flourish during the early
Renaissance period. A similar view was adopted by Nicholas of Cusa
(1401–1464), a man who well represents the weaknesses of the age, for he
was on the borderline between medieval and modern times. Nicholas saw
that a scholastic weakness in science had been a failure to measure;
“mens,” he thought, was etymologically related to “mensura,” so that
knowledge must be based on measurement.</p>
<p>Nicholas of Cusa was also influenced by the Humanist concern for
antiquity and espoused Neoplatonic views. Moreover, he studied the works
of Ramon Lull and had access to a translation of some of Archimedes’
works. But, alas, Nicholas of Cusa was better as an ecclesiastic than as
a mathematician. In the church, he rose to the rank of cardinal, but in
the field of mathematics, he is known as a misguided circle-squarer. His
philosophical doctrine of the “concordance of contraries” led him to
believe that maxima and minima are related, hence that the circle (a
polygon with the greatest possible number of sides) must be reconcilable
with the triangle (the polygon with the smallest number of sides). He
believed that through an ingenious averaging of inscribed and
circumscribed polygons, he had arrived at a quadrature. That he was
wrong was of less significance than that he was one of the first modern
Europeans to attempt a problem that had fascinated the best minds of
antiquity, and that his effort stimulated contemporaries to criticize
his work.</p>
<p>The Decline of Medieval Learning</p>
<p>We have traced the history of mathematics in Europe through the Dark
Ages of the early medieval centuries to the high point in the time of
the Scholastics. From the nadir in the seventh century to the work of
Fibonacci and Oresme in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the
improvement had been striking, but medieval efforts were in no sense
comparable to the mathematical achievements in ancient Greece. The
progress of mathematics had not been steadily upward in any part of the
world—Babylonia, Greece, China, India, Islam, or the Roman Empire—and it
should come as no surprise that in Western Europe, a decline set in
after the work of Bradwardine and Oresme. In 1349, Thomas Bradwardine
had succumbed to the Black Death, the worst scourge ever to strike
Europe. Estimates of the number of those who died of the plague within
the short space of a year or two run between one-third and one-half of
the population. This catastrophe inevitably caused severe dislocations
and loss of morale. If we note that England and France, the nations that
had seized the lead in mathematics in the fourteenth century, were
further devastated in the fifteenth century by the Hundred Years’ War
and the Wars of the Roses, the decline in learning will be
understandable. Italian, German, and Polish universities during the
fifteenth century took over the lead in mathematics from the waning
Scholasticism of Oxford and Paris, and it is primarily to
representatives from these lands that we now turn.</p>
