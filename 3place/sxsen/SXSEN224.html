<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The development of algebraic concepts in England in the first half of
the nineteenthcenturydifferedfundamentallyfromthatontheContinent.Abel,
Galois, and other Continental mathematicians evolved new concepts while
working on unsolved problems and adapting—through fusion,
generalization, or straight transfer—existing successful methods. As we
have seen,
thisallowedtheirworktoberecognizedforitsimmediateresults,evenifthe full
significance of a new concept contained therein went undetected. The
British contributors to algebra who belonged to the generation of Abel
and Galois, on the other hand, set out to establish algebra as a
“demonstrative science.” These men were strongly affected by the fact
that England’s analytic contributions lagged behind those of the
Continent. This was attributed to the superiority of “symbolic
reasoning,” or, more specifically, of the Leibnizian dy/dx notation over
the fluxional dots still prevalent in</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>Br i t i s h Algebra and t he Op erat ional C alc ulus of F unc t
ions</p>
<p>England.Sincetheseventeenthcentury,however,mathematicianshadbeen
noting that neither higher analysis nor algebra had attained the degree
of rigor found in geometry.</p>
<p>British Algebra and the Operational Calculus of Functions</p>
<p>It was George Peacock who produced the first major work “written with
a view of conferring upon Algebra the character of a demonstrative
science.” To accomplish this goal, Peacock proposed a reevaluation of
the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. Rather than being
viewed as the foundation of algebra, arithmetic “can only be considered
as a Science of Suggestion, to which the principles and operations of
Algebra are adapted, but by which they are neither limited nor
determined.” Peacock therefore separated “arithmetical” from
“symbolical” algebra. The elements of arithmetical algebra are numbers,
and its operations are those of arithmetic. Symbolical algebra, however,
is “a science, which regards the combinations of signs and symbols only
according to determinate laws, which are altogether independent of the
specific values of the symbols themselves.” Peacock related the two by a
principle reminiscent of Franc¸ois-Joseph Servois’s (1768 1847)
principle of the preservation of formal laws; it is the “principle of
the permanence of equivalent forms”:</p>
<p>Whatever form is algebraically equivalent to another when expressed
in general symbols, must continue to be equivalent whatever these
symbols denote.</p>
<p>Conversely,</p>
<p>Whatever equivalent form is discoverable in arithmetical algebra
considered as the science of suggestion when the symbols are general in
their form, though specific in their value, will continue to be an
equivalent form when the symbols are general in their nature as well as
in their form.</p>
<p>The justification for such a bold extrapolation is not made clear.
Peacock merely accepts this as a “principle of the permanence of
equivalent forms” somewhat akin to the correlation principle that Carnot
and Poncelet had used so fruitfully in geometry. Yet in one respect, the
algebraic form of this fuzzy postulate served as a deterrent to
progress, for it suggested that the laws of algebra are the same no
matter what the numbers or the objects within the algebra may be.
Peacock, it appears, was thinking primarily of the number system of
integers and the real magnitudes of geometry, and his distinction
between the two types of algebra was not so different from that which
Vie`te had made between logistica numerosa and logistica speciosa.</p>
<p>Peacock restated his views on algebra in a report on analysis
presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in
1833, whereby they became widely known. Within a few years, several
authors treated the subject anew, to varying degrees linking the
foundations of algebra to the operational calculus of functions, which
was also treated with renewed interest. Robert Murphy (1806 1843) did so
in a paper read to the Royal Society in December 1836; Augustus De
Morgan (1806 1871) did so in a Treatise on the Calculus of Functions
published the same year; and D. F. Gregory (1813 1844) did so in a
series of memoirs on the nature of algebra published in the Transactions
of the Edinburgh Royal Society a few years later. Gregory remarked on
the identity of the laws of combination for the symbols of
differentiation and differences and those of number and placed his and
Peacock’s studies in line of succession to those of Leibniz, Lagrange,
John F. W. Herschel, and Servois on the calculus. Gregory’s friend
George Boole, in a prizewinning essay presented to the Royal Society in
1844, stressed that</p>
<p>any great advances in the higher analysis must be sought for by an
increased attention to the laws of combinations of symbols. The value of
this principle can scarcely be overrated.</p>
<p>Three years later, Boole illustrated his position by applying the
laws of combination of symbols to logic.</p>
<p>Boole and theAlgebra of Logic</p>
<p>Born into an impecunious lower-class tradesman’s family in Lincoln,
England, George Boole (1815 1864) had only a common school education,
but he learned both Greek and Latin independently, believing that this
knowledge would help him rise above his station. Having become friendly
with De Morgan, he also took a keen interest in a controversy over logic
that the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788 1856), not to
be confused with the Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton
(1805 1865), had raised with De Morgan. The result was that in 1847,
Boole published a short work titled The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,
a little book that De Morgan recognized as epoch making.</p>
<p>The history of logic may be divided, with some slight degree of
oversimplification, into three stages: (1) Greek logic, (2) Scholastic
logic, and (3) mathematical logic. In the first stage, logical formulas
consisted of words of ordinary language, subject to the usual
syntactical rules. In the second stage, logic was abstracted from
ordinary language but characterized by differentiated syntactical rules
and specialized semantic functions. In the third stage, logic became
marked by the use of</p>
<p>B o ole and t he Algebra of L o gic</p>
<p>an artificial language in which words and signs have narrowly limited
semantic functions. Whereas in the first two stages, logical theorems
were derived from ordinary language, the logic of the third stage
proceeds in a contrary manner—it first constructs a purely formal
system, and only later does it look for an interpretation in everyday
speech. Although Leibniz is sometimes regarded as a precursor of the
latter point of view, its floruit date is really the year in which
Boole’s first book appeared, as well as De Morgan’s Formal Logic. The
work of Boole, in particular, emphasized that logic should be associated
with mathematics, rather than with metaphysics, as the Scottish Sir
William Hamilton had argued.</p>
<p>More important even than his mathematical logic was Boole’s view of
mathematics itself. In the introduction to his Mathematical Analysis of
Logic, the author objected to the then current view of mathematics as
the science of magnitude or number (a definition still adopted in some
of the weaker dictionaries). Espousing a far more general view, Boole
wrote,</p>
<p>We might justly assign it as the definitive character of a true
Calculus, that it is a method resting upon the employment of Symbols,
whose laws of combination are known and general, and whose results admit
of a consistent interpretation… . It is upon the foundation of this
general principle, that I propose to establish the Calculus of Logic,
and that I claim for it a place among the acknowledged forms of
Mathematical Analysis,</p>
<p>Peacock’s Algebra of 1830 had suggested that the symbols of objects
in algebra need not stand for numbers, and De Morgan argued that
interpretations of the symbols for operations were also arbitrary; Boole
carried the formalism to its conclusion. No longer was mathematics to be
limited to questions of number and continuous magnitude. Here, for the
first time, the view is clearly expressed that the essential
characteristic of mathematics is not so much its content as its form. If
any topic is presented in such a way that it consists of symbols and
precise rules of operation on these symbols, subject only to the
requirement of inner consistency, this topic is part of mathematics.
Although the Mathematical Analysis of Logic did not achieve wide
recognition, it probably was on the weight of this work that two years
later, Boole was appointed professor of mathematics at the newly
established Queens College in Cork.</p>
<p>Boole’s Investigation of the Laws of Thought of 1854 is a classic in
the history of mathematics, for it amplified and clarified the ideas
presented in 1847, establishing both formal logic and a new algebra,
known as Boolean algebra, the algebra of sets, or the algebra of logic.
Boole used the letters x, y, z, … to represent objects of a subset of
things—numbers, points, ideas, or other entities—selected from a
universal set or universe of discourse, the totality of which he
designated by the symbol or “number”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For example, if the symbol 1 represents all Europeans, x might stand
for all Europeans who are French citizens, y might be all European men
over twenty-one, and z might be all Europeans who are between five and
six feet tall. The symbol or number 0 Boole took to indicate the empty
set, containing no element of the universal set, what now is known as
the null set. The sign1between two letters or symbols, as x1y, he took
to be the union of the subsets x and y—that is, the set made up of all
of the elements in x or y (or both). The multiplication sign 3
represented the intersection of sets, so that x3y means the elements or
the objects that are in the subset x and also in the subset y. In the
previous example, x1y consists of all Europeans who are French citizens
or are men over twenty-one or both; x3y (also written as x y or simply
as xy) is the set of French citizens who are men over twenty-one.
(Boole, unlike De Morgan, used exclusive union, not permitting common
elements in x and y, but modern Boolean algebra more conveniently
takes1to be the inclusive union of sets that may have elements in
common.) The sign5represents the relationship of identity. It is clear
that the five fundamental laws of algebra now hold for this Boolean
algebra, for x1y5y1x, xy5yx, x1(y1z)5(x1y)1z, x(yz)5(xy)z, and
x(y1z)5xy1xz. Nevertheless, not all of the rules of ordinary algebra
continue to be valid: for example, 11151 and x x5x. (The second of these
appears in the work of Boole, but not the first, because he used
exclusive union). The equation x2 5x has only the two roots, in ordinary
algebra, x 50 and x 51; in this respect, the algebra of logic and
ordinary algebra are in agreement. The equation x2 5x, when written in
the form x(l2x)50, also suggests that 1 2x should designate the
complement of the subset x, that is, all of the elements in the
universal set that are not in the subset x. Although it is true in
Boolean algebra that x3 5x or x(l2x2) 50 or x(1 2x)(l1x)50, the solution
in ordinary algebra differs from that in Boolean algebra, in which there
are no negative numbers. Boolean algebra also differs from ordinary
algebra in that if zx 5zy (where z is not the null set), it does not
follow that x5y; nor is it necessarily true that if xy 50, then x or y
must be 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Boole showed that his algebra provided an easy algorithm for
syllogistic reasoning. The equation xy5x, for example, says very neatly
that all x’s are y’s. If it is also given that all y’s are z’s, then
yz5y. On substituting in the first equation the value of y given by the
second equation, the result is x(yz)5x. Using the associative law for
multiplication, the last equation can be written as (xy)z5x, and, on
replacing xy with x, we have xz5x, which is simply the symbolic way of
saying that all x’s are z’s.</p>
<p>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) and, a fortiori,
Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854) contain much more of the
algebra of sets than we have indicated. In particular, the latter work
includes applications to probability. Notations have changed somewhat
since Boole’s day, so that union and intersection are generally
indicated by</p>
<p>Augus tus D e Mor gan</p>
<p>,and -, rather than by1and 3, and the symbol for the null set is φ,
rather than 0, but the fundamental principles of Boolean algebra are
those that were laid down by Boole more than a century ago.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of Boole’s work that is not closely related to his
treatises in logic or the theory of sets but that is familiar to every
student of differential equations. This is the algorithm of differential
operators, which he introduced to facilitate the treatment of linear
differential equations. If, for example, we wish to solve the
differential equation ayv 1 byu 1cy50, the equation is written in the
notation (aD2 1bD1c)y50. Then, regarding D as an unknown quantity,
rather than as an operator, we solve the algebraic quadratic equation
aD2 1bD1c50. If the roots of the algebraic equation are p and q, then
epx and eqx are solutions of the differential equation, and Aepx 1Beqx
is a general solution of the differential equation. There are many other
situations in which Boole, in his Treatise on Differential Equations of
1859, pointed out parallels between the properties of the differential
operator (and its inverse) and the rules of algebra. British
mathematicians in the second half of the nineteenth century were thus
again becoming leaders in algorithmic analysis, a field in which, fifty
years earlier, they had been badly deficient.</p>
<p>Boole died in 1864, only ten years after publishing his Investigation
of the Laws of Thought, but recognition, including an honorary degree
from the University of Dublin, had come to him before his death. It is
curious to note that Georg Cantor, who like Boole was one of the chief
trailblazers of the century, was one of the few who declined to accept
the work of Boole. On the other hand, Boole’s work prompted a sequence
of axiomatic studies by W. S. Jevons (1835 1882), C. S. Peirce (1839
1914), E. Schro¨der (1841 1902), and others, which led to a complete set
of postulates for the algebra of logic after 1900.</p>
