<h4 id="carnot">Carnot</h4>
<p>Monge was an outstanding figure of the revolution, yet the
mathematician whose name was on the tongue of every Frenchman during the
revolution was not Monge but Carnot. Lazare Carnot (1753 1823), was
sufficiently above bourgeois standing to be permitted to attend the
E´cole Militaire at Mezie`res, where Monge was one of his teachers. On
graduation, Carnot entered the army, although, lacking a title, he could
not, under the ancien regime, aspire to a rank above that of captain.
The´ proverb arose at examination time that “the competent were not
noble and the noble were not competent.”</p>
<p>It was Lazare Carnot who, when the success of the revolution was
threatened by confusion within and invasion from without, organized the
armies and led them to victory. As ardent a republican as Monge, Carnot
nevertheless shunned all political cliques. Having a high sense of
intellectual honesty, he tried to be impartial in reaching decisions.
After investigation, he absolved the royalists of the infamous charge
that they had mixed powdered glass in flour intended for the
revolutionary armies, but he felt bound by conscience to vote for the
death of the king.</p>
<p>C arnot</p>
<p>Reasoned impartiality, however, is difficult to maintain in times of
crisis, and Robespierre, whom Carnot had antagonized, threatened that
Carnot would lose his head at the first military disaster. But Carnot
had won the admiration of his countrymen for his remarkable military
successes, and when a voice in the Convention proposed his arrest, the
deputies spontaneously rose to his defense, acclaiming him the
“Organizer of Victory.” It was instead the head of Robespierre that
fell, and Carnot survived to take an active part in the formation of the
E´cole Polytechnique. Carnot was greatly interested in education at all
levels, even though he seems never to have taught a class. His son
Hippolyte served as minister of public instruction in 1848. (Another
son, Sadi, became a celebrated physicist, and a grandson, also named
Sadi, became the fourth president of the Third French Republic.)</p>
<p>Carnot led a charmed political life until 1797. He had gone from the
National Assembly to the Legislative Assembly, to the National
Convention, to the powerful Committee of Public Safety, to the Council
of Five Hundred and the Directorate. In 1797, however, he refused to
join a partisan coup d’etat and was promptly ordered deported. His name
was´ stricken from the roles of the Institut, and his chair of geometry
was voted unanimously to General Bonaparte. Even Monge, a fellow
republican and mathematician, approved the intellectual outrage. Monge
seems to have been mesmerized by Napoleon. Monge followed his idol
through thick and thin, his devotion being such that he literally became
sick every time Napoleon lost a battle. This is in contrast to Carnot,
who was responsible for Bonaparte’s rise to power through his
appointment to the Italian campaign, but who did not hesitate to oppose
him.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Carnot’s proscription turned out to be a good thing,
for it gave him an opportunity, while in exile, to complete a work that
had been on his mind for some time. By 1786, he had published a second
edition of his Essai sur les machines en general, as well as some verses
and a work on fortifications. But the work that Carnot had been planning
during his politically busy days was, mirabile dictu, the Reflexions sur
la´ metaphysique du calcul infinit´ esimal´ , which appeared in 1797.
This was not a work on applied mathematics; it came closer to philosophy
than to physics, and in this respect, it adumbrated the period of rigor
and concern for foundations that was so typical of the next century.</p>
<p>Metaphysics of the Calculus and Geometry</p>
<p>During the second half of the eighteenth century, there was
enthusiasm for the results of the calculus but confusion about its basic
principles. Not one of the usual approaches, whether by the fluxions of
Newton, the differentials of Leibniz, or the limits of d’Alembert,
seemed to be satisfying. Hence, Carnot, considering the conflicting
interpretations, sought to show “in what the veritable spirit” of the
new analysis consisted. In his selection of the unifying principle,
however, he made a most deplorable choice. He concluded that “the true
metaphysical principles” are “the principles of the compensation of
errors.” Infinitesimals, he argued, are “quantites´ inappreciables,”
which, like imaginary numbers, are introduced only to´ facilitate the
computation and are eliminated in reaching the final result. “Imperfect
equations” are made “perfectly exact,” in the calculus, by eliminating
the quantities, such as infinitesimals of higher order, the presence of
which occasioned the errors. To the objection that vanishing quantities
either are or are not zero, Carnot responded that “what are called
infinitely small quantities are not simply any null quantities at all,
but rather null quantities assigned by a law of continuity which
determines the relationship”—an argument that is strongly reminiscent of
Leibniz. The diverse approaches to the calculus, he claimed, were
nothing but simplifications of the ancient method of exhaustion,
reducing this in various ways to a convenient algorithm. Carnot’s
Reflexions´ enjoyed a wide popularity, appearing in many languages and
editions. Unsuccessful though its synthesis of views was, it undoubtedly
helped make mathematicians dissatisfied with the “abominable little
zeros” of the eighteenth century and helped lead toward the age of rigor
in the nineteenth. Carnot’s reputation today, however, depends primarily
on other works.</p>
<p>In 1801, he published De la correlation des figures de geometrie´ ,
again a work characterized by its high degree of generality. In it,
Carnot sought to establish for pure geometry a universality comparable
to that enjoyed by analytic geometry. He showed that several of Euclid’s
theorems can be regarded as specific instances of a more inclusive
theorem for which a single demonstration suffices. We find in the
Elements, for instance, the theorem that if two chords AD and BC in a
circle intersect in a point K, the product of AK by KD is equal to the
product of BK by KC (Fig. 18.1). Later, we run across the theorem that
if KDA and KCB are secants to a circle, the product of AK by KD is equal
to the product of BK by KC. These two theorems Carnot would regard
merely as special cases, correlated through the use of negative
quantities, of a general property of</p>
<p>C arnot</p>
<p>lines and circles. If we note that for the chords CK5CB2BK, whereas
for the secants CK5BK2CB, the relationship AKKD5CKKB can be carried over
from the one case to the other simply by a change of sign. And tangency
is only another case in which B and C, say, coincide, so that BC50.
Although the graphical representation of complex numbers had not yet
come into general use, Carnot did not hesitate to also suggest a
correlation of figures through imaginary numbers. He cited as an example
the fact that the circle y2 5a2 2x2 is related to the hyperbola y2 5x2
2a2 through the identity x2 2a2 5ðp21Þ2ða2 2x2Þ.</p>
<p>Geom´ etrie de Position´</p>
<p>Carnot greatly expanded his correlation of figures in his Geom´ etrie
de´ position in 1803, a book that placed him beside Monge as a founder
of modern pure geometry. The development of mathematics has been
characterized by a striving for ever higher and higher degrees of
generality, and it is this quality that gives significance to the work
of Carnot. His penchant for generalization led him to beautiful
analogues of well-known theorems of plane geometry. The equivalent of
the familiar law of cosines in trigonometry, a2 5b2 1c2 22bc cos A, had
been known at least as far back as the days of Euclid; Carnot extended
this ancient theorem to an equivalent form, a2 5b2 1c2 1d2 22cd cos
B22bd cos C22bc cos D, for a tetrahedron, where a, b, c, and d are the
areas of the four faces and B, C, and D are the angles between the faces
of areas c and d, b and d, and b and c, respectively. The passion for
generality that is found in his work has been the driving force of
modern mathematics.</p>
<p>The Geom´ etrie de position´ is a classic in pure geometry, but it
also contains significant contributions to analysis. Although analytic
geometry had completely overshadowed synthetic geometry for more than a
century, its supremacy had been won in terms of two coordinate systems,
rectangular and polar. In the rectangular system, the coordinates of a
point P in a plane are the distances of P from two mutually
perpendicular lines or axes; in the polar system, one of the coordinates
of P is the distance of P from a fixed point O (the pole), and the other
is the angle that line OP makes with a fixed line (polar axis) through
O. Carnot saw that coordinate systems could be modified in many ways.
For example, the coordinates of P may be the distances of P from two
fixed points O and Q, or one coordinate may be the distance OP and the
other the area of the triangle OPQ. In such generalizations, Carnot
simply rediscovered and extended a suggestion that Newton had made but
that had been generally overlooked; however, Carnot’s thought
characteristically carried him further. In all of the cases so far
considered, the equation of a curve depends on the particular coordinate
frame of reference that is used, yet the properties of a curve are not
bound to any one choice of pole or axes. It should be possible, Carnot
reasoned, to find coordinates that do not “depend on any particular
hypothesis or on any basis of comparison taken in absolute space.” Thus,
he initiated the search for what are now known as intrinsic coordinates.
One of these he found in the familiar radius of curvature of a curve at
a point. For the other, he introduced a quantity to which he gave no
name but that has since come to be called aberrancy, or angle of
deviation. This is an extension of the ideas of tangency and curvature.
The tangent to a curve at a point P is the limiting position of a secant
line PQ as Q approaches P along the curve; the circle of curvature is
the limiting position of the circle through the points P, Q, and R as Q
and R approach P along the curve. If, now, one passes a parabola through
points P, Q, R, and S and finds the limiting position of this parabola
as the points Q, R, and S approach P along the curve, the aberrancy at P
is the angle between the axis of this parabola and the normal to the
curve. Aberrancy is related to the third derivative of a function, in
much the same sense that slope and curvature are related to the first
and second derivatives, respectively.</p>
<p>Transversals</p>
<p>Carnot’s name is known among mathematicians for a theorem that bears
his name, which appeared in 1806 in an Essai sur la theorie des
transversales´ . This, again, is an extension of an ancient result.
Menelaus of Alexandria had shown that if a straight line intersects the
sides AB, BC, and CA of a triangle (or these sides extended) in points
P, Q, and R, respectively, and if au 5AP, bu 5BQ, cu 5CR and av 5AR, bv
5BP, cv 5CQ, then aubucu 5avbvcv (Fig. 18.2). Carnot showed that if the
straight line in the theorem of Menelaus is replaced by a curve of order
n that intersects AB in the (real or imaginary) points P1, P2, P3,…, Pn,
BC in the points Q1, Q2, Q3,…, Qn, and CA in the points R1, R2, R3,…,
Rn, then the theorem of Menelaus holds if one takes au as the product of
the n distances AP1, AP2, AP3,…, APn, with similar definitions for bu
and cu and analogous definitions for av, bv, and cv (Fig. 18.3). The
theory of transversals is only a small part</p>
<p>L aplace</p>
<p>of a work that contains other interesting generalizations. From the
familiar formula of Heron of Alexandria for the area of a triangle in
terms of its three sides, Carnot went on to a corresponding result for
the volume of the tetrahedron in terms of its six edges; finally, he
derived a formula, consisting of 130 terms, for finding the tenth of the
ten segments joining five points at random in space if the other nine
are known.</p>
