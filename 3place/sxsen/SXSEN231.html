<h4 id="algebraic-and-arithmetic-integers">Algebraic and Arithmetic
Integers</h4>
<p>The work of Galois had been important not only in making the abstract
notion of group fundamental in the theory of equations, but also in
leading, through the contributions of Dedekind, Kronecker, and Ernst
Eduard Kummer, to what may be called an arithmetical approach to
algebra, somewhat akin to the arithmetization of analysis. This means
the development of a careful postulational treatment of algebraic
structure in terms of various number fields. The concept of field was
implicit in work by Abel and Galois, but in 1879, Dedekind seems to have
been the first one to give</p>
<p>A lgebraic and Ar i t hme t ic Int e ger s</p>
<p>an explicit definition of a number field—a set of numbers that form
an Abelian group with respect to addition and with respect to
multiplication (except for the inverse of zero) and for which
multiplication distributes over addition. Simple examples are the system
of rational numbers, the real number system, and the complex number
field. In 1881, Kronecker gave other instances through his domains of
rationality. The set of numbers of the form a1bp2, where a and b are
rational, form a field, as is easily verified. In this case, the number
of elements in the field is infinite. A field with a finite number of
elements is known as a Galois field, and a simple instance of this is
the field of integers modulo 5 (or any prime).</p>
<p>The concern for structure and the rise of new algebras, especially
during the second half of the nineteenth century, led to broad
generalizations about number and arithmetic. We have already noted that
Gauss extended the idea of integer through the study of Gaussian
integers of the form a1bi, where a and b are integers. Dedekind
generalized further in the theory of “algebraic integers”—numbers
satisfying a polynomial equation with integral coefficients that have
leading coefficient unity. Such systems of “integers” do not, of course,
form a field, for inverses under multiplication are lacking. They do
have something in common, in that they satisfy the other requirements
for a number field; they are thus said to form an “integral domain.”
Such generalizations of the word
“integer”are,however,boughtataprice—thelossofuniquefactorization.
Therefore, Dedekind, adapting ideas developed by the contemporary
mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer (1810 1893), introduced into
arithmetic the concept of an “ideal.”</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a ring if (1) it is an Abelian
group with respect to addition, (2) the set is closed under
multiplication, and (3) multiplication is associative and is
distributive over addition. (Hence, a ring that is commutative under
multiplication has a unit element and has no divisors of zero is an
integral domain.) An ideal, then, is a subset I of elements of a ring R
that (1) form an additive group and (2) are such that whenever x belongs
to R and y belongs to I, then xy belong to I. The set of even integers,
for example, is an ideal in the ring of integers. It turns out that in
the ring (or integral domain) R of algebraic integers, any ideal I of R
can be represented uniquely (except for the order of the factors) as a
product of prime ideals. That is, uniqueness of factorization can be
saved through the theory of ideals.</p>
<p>Kummer earned his doctorate at the University of Halle. After about a
dozen years of teaching in gymnasia, he succeeded Dirichlet at Berlin
when, in 1855, the latter became Gauss’s successor at Go¨ttingen; Kummer
remained there until his retirement in 1883. Shortly after earning his
degree, Kummer had become interested in Fermat’s Last Theorem. Kummer
was able to prove the theorem for a large class of exponents, but a
general proof eluded him. The stumbling block seems to have been the
fact that in the factoring of xn 1yn, through the solution of xn 1yn 50
for x in terms of y, the algebraic integers, or roots of the equation,
do not necessarily satisfy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic; that
is, they are not uniquely factorable. The result was that although he
failed to solve Fermat’s theorem, in the attempt to do so he created, in
a sense, a new arithmetic. This was a theory, not of our ideals, but of
devices that he called “ideal complex numbers.” One of the lessons that
the history of mathematics teaches is that the search for solutions to
unsolved problems, whether solvable or unsolvable, invariably leads to
important discoveries along the way.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s concern with algebra goes back to the 1850s, when he
attended Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory in Go¨ttingen and pursued
intensive studies of Galois theory. His notes of the period show that he
developed an abstract treatment of elementary group theory at that time.
After Dirichlet’s death, Dedekind was charged with publishing
Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory. In appendices to that work, he
presented a number of results of his own. Best known among these was his
ideal theory, various versions of which can be compared in the
successive editions of Dirichlet-Dedekind. The most axiomatic approach,
which appeared in the 1894 edition, was the one that especially
influenced Emmy Noether and her school of algebraists in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In 1897 and 1900, Dedekind also published two memoirs on a new
structure he called a “dual group.” In the first of these memoirs, the
modern reader easily recognizes a set of axioms for a lattice. In the
second, devoted to a study of the free modular lattice with three
generators, Dedekind showed that a lattice forms a partially ordered
set. Here the reader also finds the important concepts of a covering
relation and of the dimension of a lattice. Dedekind also utilized chain
conditions.</p>
<p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, numerous other
abstract and often axiomatic treatments of groups and fields were
published. Several of these were instigated by Dedekind; this is true
particularly of the work of Heinrich Weber, whom Dedekind interested in
algebra.</p>
