<p>Foreword to the Second Edition</p>
<p>By Isaac Asimov</p>
<p>Mathematics is a unique aspect of human thought, and its history
differs in essence from all other histories.</p>
<p>As time goes on, nearly every field of human endeavor is marked by
changes which can be considered as correction and/or extension. Thus,
the changes in the evolving history of political and military events are
always chaotic; there is no way to predict the rise of a Genghis Khan,
for example, or the consequences of the short-lived Mongol Empire. Other
changes are a matter of fashion and subjective opinion. The
cavepaintings of 25,000 years ago are generally considered great art,
and while art has continuously—even chaotically—changed in the
subsequent millennia, there are elements of greatness in all the
fashions. Similarly, each society considers its own ways natural and
rational, and finds the ways of other societies to be odd, laughable, or
repulsive.</p>
<p>But only among the sciences is there true progress; only there is the
record one of continuous advance toward ever greater heights.</p>
<p>And yet, among most branches of science, the process of progress is
one of both correction and extension. Aristotle, one of the greatest
minds ever to contemplate physical laws, was quite wrong in his views on
falling bodies and had to be corrected by Galileo in the 1590s. Galen,
the greatest of ancient physicians, was not allowed to study human
cadavers and was quite wrong in his anatomical and physiological
conclusions. He had to be corrected by Vesalius in 1543 and Harvey in
1628. Even Newton, the greatest of all scientists, was wrong in his view
of the nature of light, of the achromaticity of lenses, and missed the
existence of spectral lines. His masterpiece, the laws of motion and the
theory of universal gravitation, had to be modified by Einstein in
1916.</p>
<p>Now we can see what makes mathematics unique. Only in mathematics is
there no significant correction—only extension. Once the Greeks had
developed the deductive method, they were correct in what they did,
correct for all time. Euclid was incomplete and his work has been
extended enormously, but it has not had to be corrected. His theorems
are, every one of them, valid to this day.</p>
<p>Ptolemy may have developed an erroneous picture of the planetary
system, but the system of trigonometry he worked out to help him with
his calculations remains correct forever.</p>
<p>Each great mathematician adds to what came previously, but nothing
needs to be uprooted. Consequently, when we read a book like A History
of Mathematics, we get the picture of a mounting structure, ever taller
and broader and more beautiful and magnificent and with a foundation,
moreover, that is as untainted and as functional now as it was when
Thales worked out the first geometrical theorems nearly 26 centuries
ago. Nothing pertaining to humanity becomes us so well as
mathematics.</p>
<p>There, and only there, do we touch the human mind at its peak.</p>
<h4 id="preface-to-the-third-edition">Preface to the Third Edition</h4>
<p>During the two decades since the appearance of the second edition of
this work, there have been substantial changes in the course of
mathematics and the treatment of its history. Within mathematics,
outstanding results were achieved by a merging of techniques and
concepts from previously distinct areas of specialization. The history
of mathematics continued to grow quantitatively, as noted in the preface
to the second edition; but here, too, there were substantial studies
that overcame the polemics of “internal” versus “external” history and
combined a fresh approach to the mathematics of the original texts with
the appropriate linguistic, sociological, and economic tools of the
historian.</p>
<p>In this third edition I have striven again to adhere to Boyer’s
approach to the history of mathematics. Although the revision this time
includes the entire work, changes have more to do with emphasis than
original content, the obvious exception being the inclusion of new
findings since the appearance of the first edition. For example, the
reader will find greater stress placed on the fact that we deal with
such a small number of sources from antiquity; this is one of the
reasons for condensing three previous chapters dealing with the Hellenic
period into one. On the other hand, the chapter dealing with China and
India has been split, as content demands. There is greater emphasis on
the recurring interplay between pure and applied mathematics as
exemplified in chapter 14. Some reorganization is due to an attempt to
underline the impact of institutional and personal transmission of
ideas; this has affected most of the pre-nineteenth-century chapters.
The chapters dealing with the nineteenth century have been altered the
least, as I had made substantial changes for some of this material in
the second edition. The twentieth-century material has been doubled, and
a new final chapter deals with recent trends, including solutions of
some longstanding problems and the effect of computers on the nature of
proofs.</p>
<p>It is always pleasant to acknowledge those known to us for having had
an impact on our work. I am most grateful to Shirley Surrette Duffy for
responding judiciously to numerous requests for stylistic advice, even
at times when there were more immediate priorities. Peggy Aldrich
Kidwell replied with unfailing precision to my inquiry concerning
certain photographs in the National Museum of American History. Jeanne
LaDuke cheerfully and promptly answered my appeals for help, especially
in confirming sources. Judy and Paul Green may not realize that a casual
conversation last year led me to rethink some recent material. I have
derived special pleasure and knowledge from several recent publications,
among them Klopfer 2009 and, in a more leisurely fashion, Szpiro 2007.
Great thanks are due to the editors and production team of John Wiley
andandandand Sons who worked with me to make this edition possible:
Stephen Power, the senior editor, was unfailingly generous and
diplomatic in his counsel; the editorial assistant, Ellen Wright,
facilitated my progress through the major steps of manuscript creation;
the senior production manager, Marcia Samuels, provided me with clear
and concise instructions, warnings, and examples; senior production
editors Kimberly Monroe-Hill and John Simko and the copyeditor, Patricia
Waldygo, subjected the manuscript to painstakingly meticulous scrutiny.
The professionalism of all concerned provides a special kind of
encouragement in troubled times.</p>
<p>I should like to pay tribute to two scholars whose influence on
others should not be forgotten. The Renaissance historian Marjorie N.
Boyer (Mrs. Carl B. Boyer) graciously and knowledgeably complimented a
young researcher at the beginning of her career on a talk presented at a
Leibniz conference in 1966. The brief conversation with a total stranger
did much to influence me in pondering the choice between mathematics and
its history.</p>
<p>More recently, the late historian of mathematics Wilbur Knorr set a
significant example to a generation of young scholars by refusing to
accept the notion that ancient authors had been studied definitively by
others. Setting aside the “magister dixit,” he showed us the wealth of
knowledge that emerges from seeking out the texts.</p>
<p>—Uta C. Merzbach March 2010</p>
<h4 id="preface-to-the-second-edition">Preface to the Second
Edition</h4>
<p>This edition brings to a new generation and a broader spectrum of
readers a book that became a standard for its subject after its initial
appearance in 1968. The years since then have been years of renewed
interest and vigorous activity in the history of mathematics. This has
been demonstrated by the appearance of numerous new publications dealing
with topics in the field, by an increase in the number of courses on the
history of mathematics, and by a steady growth over the years in the
number of popular books devoted to the subject. Lately, growing interest
in the history of mathematics has been reflected in other branches of
the popular press and in the electronic media. Boyer’s contribution to
the history of mathematics has left its mark on all of these
endeavors.</p>
<p>When one of the editors of John Wiley andandandand Sons first
approached me concerning a revision of Boyer’s standard work, we quickly
agreed that textual modifications should be kept to a minimum and that
the changes and additions should be made to conform as much as possible
to Boyer’s original approach. Accordingly, the first twenty-two chapters
have been left virtually unchanged. The chapters dealing with the
nineteenth century have been revised; the last chapter has been expanded
and split into two. Throughout, an attempt has been made to retain a
consistent approach within the volume and to adhere to Boyer’s stated
aim of giving stronger emphasis on historical elements than is customary
in similar works.</p>
<p>The references and general bibliography have been substantially
revised. Since this work is aimed at English-speaking readers, many of
whom are unable to utilize Boyer’s foreign-language chapter references,
these have been replaced by recent works in English. Readers are urged
to consult the General Bibliography as well, however. Immediately
following the chapter references at the end of the book, it contains
additional works and further bibliographic references, with less regard
to language. The introduction to that bibliography provides some overall
guidance for further pleasurable reading and for solving problems.</p>
<p>The initial revision, which appeared two years ago, was designed for
classroom use. The exercises found there, and in the original edition,
have been dropped in this edition, which is aimed at readers outside the
lecture room. Users of this book interested in supplementary exercises
are referred to the suggestions in the General Bibliography.</p>
<p>I express my gratitude to Judith V. Grabiner and Albert Lewis for
numerous helpful criticisms and suggestions. I am pleased to acknowledge
the fine cooperation and assistance of several members of the Wiley
editorial staff. I owe immeasurable thanks to Virginia Beets for lending
her vision at a critical stage in the preparation of this manuscript.
Finally, thanks are due to numerous colleagues and students who have
shared their thoughts about the first edition with me. I hope they will
find beneficial results in this revision.</p>

<h4 id="preface-to-the-first-edition">Preface to the First Edition</h4>
<p>Numerous histories of mathematics have appeared during this century,
many of them in the English language. Some are very recent, such as J.
F. Scott’s A History of Mathematics〔 London: Taylor and Francis,
1958.〕; a new entry in the field, therefore, should have
characteristics not already present in the available books. Actually,
few of the histories at hand are textbooks, at least not in the American
sense of the word, and Scott’s History is not one of them. It appeared,
therefore, that there was room for a new book—one that would meet more
satisfactorily my own preferences and possibly those of others.</p>
<p>The two-volume History of Mathematics by David Eugene Smith〔 Boston:
Ginn and Company, 19231925.〕 was indeed written “for the purpose of
supplying teachers and students with a usable textbook on the history of
elementary mathematics,” but it covers too wide an area on too low a
mathematical level for most modern college courses, and it is lacking in
problems of varied types. Florian Cajori’s History of Mathematics〔 New
York: Macmillan, 1931, 2nd edition.〕 still is a very helpful reference
work; but it is not adapted to classroom use, nor is E. T. Bell’s
admirable The Development of Mathematics.〔 New York: McGraw Hill, 1945,
2nd edition.〕 The most successful and appropriate textbook today
appears to be Howard Eves, An Introduction to the History of
Mathematics,〔 New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1964, revised
edition.〕 which I have used with considerable satisfaction in at least
a dozen classes since it first appeared in 1953.</p>
<p>I have occasionally departed from the arrangement of topics in the
book in striving toward a heightened sense of historicalmindedness and
have supplemented the material by further reference to the contributions
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries especially by the use of D.
J. Struik, A Concise History of Mathematics.〔 New York: Dover
Publications, 1967, 3rd edition.〕</p>
<p>The reader of this book, whether layman, student, or teacher of a
course in the history of mathematics, will find that the level of
mathematical background that is presupposed is approximately that of a
college junior or senior, but the material can be perused profitably
also by readers with either stronger or weaker mathematical preparation.
Each chapter ends with a set of exercises that are graded roughly into
three categories. Essay questions that are intended to indicate the
reader’s ability to organize and put into his own words the material
discussed in the chapter are listed first. Then follow relatively easy
exercises that require the proofs of some of the theorems mentioned in
the chapter or their application to varied situations. Finally, there
are a few starred exercises, which are either more difficult or require
specialized methods that may not be familiar to all students or all
readers. The exercises do not in any way form part of the general
exposition and can be disregarded by the reader without loss of
continuity.</p>
<p>Here and there in the text are references to footnotes, generally
bibliographical, and following each chapter there is a list of suggested
readings. Included are some references to the vast periodical literature
in the field, for it is not too early for students at this level to be
introduced to the wealth of material available in good libraries.
Smaller college libraries may not be able to provide all of these
sources, but it is well for a student to be aware of the larger realms
of scholarship beyond the confines of his own campus. There are
references also to works in foreign languages, despite the fact that
some students, hopefully not many, may be unable to read any of these.
Besides providing important additional sources for those who have a
reading knowledge of a foreign language, the inclusion of references in
other languages may help to break down the linguistic provincialism
which, ostrichlike, takes refuge in the mistaken impression that
everything worthwhile appeared in, or has been translated into, the
English language.</p>
<p>The present work differs from the most successful presently available
textbook in a stricter adherence to the chronological arrangement and a
stronger emphasis on historical elements. There is always the temptation
in a class in history of mathematics to assume that the fundamental
purpose of the course is to teach mathematics. A departure from
mathematical standards is then a mortal sin, whereas an error in history
is venial. I have striven to avoid such an attitude, and the purpose of
the book is to present the history of mathematics with fidelity, not
only to mathematical structure and exactitude, but also to historical
perspective and detail. It would be folly, in a book of this scope, to
expect that every date, as well as every decimal point, is correct. It
is hoped, however, that such inadvertencies as may survive beyond the
stage of page proof will not do violence to the sense of history,
broadly understood, or to a sound view of mathematical concepts. It
cannot be too strongly emphasized that this single volume in no way
purports to present the history of mathematics in its entirety. Such an
enterprise would call for the concerted effort of a team, similar to
that which produced the fourth volume of Cantor’s Vorlesungen iiber
Geschichte der Mathematik in 1908 and brought the story down to 1799. In
a work of modest scope the author must exercise judgment in the
selection of the materials to be included, reluctantly restraining the
temptation to cite the work of every productive mathematician; it will
be an exceptional reader who will not note here what he regards as
unconscionable omissions. In particular, the last chapter attempts
merely to point out a few of the salient characteristics of the
twentieth century. In the field of the history of mathematics perhaps
nothing is more to be desired than that there should appear a latter-day
Felix Klein who would complete for our century the type of project Klein
essayed for the nineteenth century, but did not live to finish.</p>
<p>A published work is to some extent like an iceberg, for what is
visible constitutes only a small fraction of the whole. No book appears
until the author has lavished time on it unstintingly and unless he has
received encouragement and support from others too numerous to be named
individually. Indebtedness in my case begins with the many eager
students to whom I have taught the history of mathematics, primarily at
Brooklyn College, but also at Yeshiva University, the University of
Michigan, the University of California (Berkeley), and the University of
Kansas. At the University of Michigan, chiefly through the encouragement
of Professor Phillip S. Jones, and at Brooklyn College through the
assistance of Dean Walter H. Mais and Professors Samuel Borofsky and
James Singer, I have on occasion enjoyed a reduction in teaching load in
order to work on the manuscript of this book. Friends and colleagues in
the field of the history of mathematics, including Professor Dirk</p>
<p>J.StruikoftheMassachusettsInstituteofTechnology,ProfessorKennethO.</p>
<p>May at the University of Toronto, Professor Howard Eves of the
University of Maine, and Professor Morris Kline at New York University,
have made many helpful suggestions in the preparation of the book, and
these have been greatly appreciated. Materials in the books and articles
of others have been expropriated freely, with little acknowledgment
beyond a cold bibliographical reference, and I take this opportunity to
express to these authors my warmest gratitude. Libraries and publishers
have been very helpful in providing information and illustrations needed
in the text; in particular it has been a pleasure to have worked with
the staff of John Wiley andandandand Sons. The typing of the final copy,
as well as of much of the difficult preliminary manuscript, was done
cheerfully and with painstaking care by Mrs. Hazel Stanley of Lawrence,
Kansas. Finally, I must express deep gratitude to a very understanding
wife. Dr. Marjorie N. Boyer, for her patience in tolerating disruptions
occasioned by the development of yet another book within the family.</p>

<a href="./dicts/dict.5103数学史EN_010.html">本章字典</a></h4>
<p>Contemporary mathematicians formulate statements about abstract
concepts that are subject to verification by proof. For centuries,
mathematics was considered to be the science of numbers, magnitudes, and
forms. For that reason, those who seek early examples of mathematical
activity will point to archaeological remnants that reflect human
awareness of operations on numbers, counting, or “geometric” patterns
and shapes. Even when these vestiges reflect mathematical activity, they
rarely evidence muchhistorical significance.Theymaybe
interestingwhentheyshowthat peoples in different parts of the world
conducted certain actions dealing with concepts that have been
considered mathematical. For such an action to assume historical
significance, however, we look for relationships that indicate this
action was known to another individual or group that engaged
inarelatedaction.Oncesuchaconnectionhasbeenestablished,thedooris open to
more specifically historical studies, such as those dealing with
transmission, tradition, and conceptual change.</p>
<p>Mathematical vestiges are often found in the domain of nonliterate
cultures, making the evaluation of their significance even more complex.
Rules of operation may exist as part of an oral tradition, often in
musical or verse form, or they may be clad in the language of magic or
ritual. Sometimes they are found in observations of animal behavior,
removing them even further from the realm of the historian. While
studies of canine arithmetic or avian geometry belong to the zoologist,
of the impact of brain lesions on number sense to the neurologist, and
of numerical healing incantations to the anthropologist, all of these
studies may prove to be useful to the historian of mathematics without
being an overt part of that history.</p>
<p>At first, the notions of number, magnitude, and form may have been
related to contrasts rather than likenesses—the difference between one
wolf and many, the inequality in size of a minnow and a whale, the
unlikeness of the roundness of the moon and the straightness of a pine
tree. Gradually, there may have arisen, out of the welter of chaotic
experiences, the realization that there are samenesses, and from this
awareness of similarities in number and form both science and
mathematics were born. The differences themselves seem to point to
likenesses, for the contrast between one wolf and many, between one
sheep and a herd, between one tree and a forest suggests that one wolf,
one sheep, and one tree have something in common—their uniqueness. In
the same way it would be noticed that certain other groups, such as
pairs, can be put into one-to-one correspondence. The hands can be
matched against the feet, the eyes, the ears, or the nostrils. This
recognition of an abstract property that certain groups hold in common,
and that we call “number,” represents a long step toward modern
mathematics. It is unlikely to have been the discovery of any one
individual or any single tribe; it was more probably a gradual awareness
that may have developed as early in man’s cultural development as the
use of fire, possibly some 300,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That the development of the number concept was a long and gradual
process is suggested by the fact that some languages, including Greek,
have preserved in their grammar a tripartite distinction between 1 and 2
and more than 2, whereas most languages today make only the dual
distinction in “number” between singular and plural. Evidently, our very
early ancestors at first counted only to 2, and any set beyond this
level was designated as “many.” Even today, many people still count
objects by arranging them into sets of two each.</p>
<p>The awareness of number ultimately became sufficiently extended and
vivid so that a need was felt to express the property in some way,
presumably at first in sign language only. The fingers on a hand can be
readily used to indicate a set of two or three or four or five objects,
the number 1 generally not being recognized at first as a true “number.”
By the use of the fingers on both hands, collections containing up to
ten elements could be represented; by combining fingers and toes, one
could count as high as 20. When the human digits were inadequate, heaps
of stones or knotted strings could be used to represent a correspondence
with the elements of another set. Where nonliterate peoples used such a
scheme of representation, they often piled the stones in groups of five,
for they had become familiar with quintuples through observation of the
human hand and foot. As Aristotle noted long ago, the widespread use
today of the decimal system is but the result of the anatomical accident
that most of us are born with ten fingers and ten toes.</p>
<p>Groups of stones are too ephemeral for the preservation of
information; hence, prehistoric man sometimes made a number record by
cutting notches in a stick or a piece of bone. Few of these records
remain today, but in Moravia a bone from a young wolf was found that is
deeply incised with fifty-five notches. These are arranged in two
series, with twenty-five in the first and thirty in the second: within
each series, the notches are arranged in groups of five. It has been
dated as being approximately 30,000 years old. Two other prehistoric
numerical artifacts were found in Africa: a baboon fibula having
twenty-nine notches, dated as being circa 35,000 years old, and the
Ishango bone, with its apparent examples of multiplicative entries,
initially dated as approximately 8,000 years old but now estimated to be
as much as 30,000 years old as well. Such archaeological discoveries
provide evidence that the idea of number is far older than previously
acknowledged.</p>
<h4 id="early-number-bases">Early Number Bases</h4>
<p>Historically, finger counting, or the practice of counting by fives
and tens, seems to have come later than counter-casting by twos and
threes, yet the quinary and decimal systems almost invariably displaced
the binary and ternary schemes. A study of several hundred tribes among
the American Indians, for example, showed that almost one-third used a
decimal base, and about another third had adopted a quinary or a
quinary-decimal system; fewer than a third had a binary scheme, and
those using a ternary system constituted less than 1 percent of the
group. The vigesimal system, with the number 20 as a base, occurred in
about 10 percent of the tribes.</p>
<p>An interesting example of a vigesimal system is that used by the Maya
of Yucatan and Central America. This was deciphered some time before the
rest of the Maya languages could be translated. In their representation
of time intervals between dates in their calendar, the Maya used a place
value numeration, generally with 20 as the primary base and with 5 as an
auxiliary. (See the following illustration.) Units were represented by
dots and fives by horizontal bars, so that the number</p>

<p>17, for example, would appear as (that is, as 3(5)12). A vertical
positional arrangement was used, with the larger units of time above;
hence, the notation denoted 352 (that is, 17(20)112). Because the system
was primarily for counting days within a calendar that had 360 days in a
year, the third position usually did not represent multiples of
(20)(20), as in a pure vigesimal system, but (18)(20). Beyond this
point, however, the base 20 again prevailed. Within this positional
notation, the Maya indicated missing positions through the use of a
symbol, which appeared in variant forms, somewhat resembling a half-open
eye.</p>
<p>Number Language and Counting</p>
<p>In their scheme, then, the notationdenoted 17(201820)1

<h4 id="number-language-and-counting">Number Language and Counting</h4>
<p>It is generally believed that the development of language was
essential to the rise of abstract mathematical thinking. Yet words
expressing numerical ideas were slow in arising. Number signs probably
preceded number words, for it is easier to cut notches in a stick than
it is to establish a well-modulated phrase to identify a number. Had the
problem of language not been so difficult, rivals to the decimal system
might have made greater headway. The base 5, for example, was one of the
earliest to leave behind some tangible written evidence, but by the time
that language became formalized, 10 had gained the upper hand. The
modern languages of today are built almost without exception around the
base 10, so that the number 13, for example, is not described as 3 and 5
and 5, but as 3 and 10. The tardiness in the development of language to
cover abstractions such as number is also seen in the fact that
primitive numerical verbal expressions invariably refer to specific
concrete collections—such as “two fishes” or “two clubs”—and later some
such phrase would be adopted conventionally to indicate all sets of two
objects. The tendency for language to develop from the concrete to the
abstract is seen in many of our present-day measures of length. The
height of a horse is measured in “hands,” and the words “foot” and “ell”
(or elbow) have similarly been derived from parts of the body.</p>
<p>The thousands of years required for man to separate out the abstract
concepts from repeated concrete situations testify to the difficulties
that must have been experienced in laying even a very primitive basis
for mathematics. Moreover, there are a great many unanswered questions
relatingtotheoriginsofmathematics.Itisusuallyassumedthatthesubject arose
in answer to practical needs, but anthropological studies suggest the
possibility of an alternative origin. It has been suggested that the art
of counting arose in connection with primitive religious ritual and that
the ordinal aspect preceded the quantitative concept. In ceremonial
rites depicting creation myths, it was necessary to call the
participants onto the scenein aspecificorder,
andperhapscountingwasinvented to takecare of this problem. If theories
of the ritual origin of counting are correct, the concept of the ordinal
number may have preceded that of the cardinal number. Moreover, such an
origin would tend to point to the possibility that counting stemmed from
a unique origin, spreading subsequently to other areas of the world.
This view, although far from established, would bein harmonywith
theritualdivisionoftheintegersintooddand even,the former being regarded
as male, the latter as female. Such distinctions
wereknowntocivilizationsinallcornersoftheearth,andmythsregarding the
male and female numbers have been remarkably persistent.</p>
<p>The concept of the whole number is one of the oldest in mathematics,
and its origin is shrouded in the mists of prehistoric antiquity. The
notion of a rational fraction, however, developed relatively late and
was not in general closely related to systems for the integers. Among
nonliterate tribes, there seems to have been virtually no need for
fractions. For quantitative needs, the practical person can choose units
that are sufficiently small to obviate the necessity of using fractions.
Hence, there was no orderly advance from binary to quinary to decimal
fractions, and the dominance of decimal fractions is essentially the
product of the modern age.</p>
<h4 id="spatial-relationships">Spatial Relationships</h4>
<p>Statements about the origins of mathematics, whether of arithmetic or
geometry, are of necessity hazardous, for the beginnings of the subject
are older than the art of writing. It is only during the last half-dozen
millennia, in a passage that may have spanned thousands of millennia,
that human beings have been able to put their records and thoughts into
written form. For data about the prehistoric age, we must depend on
interpretations based on the few surviving artifacts, on evidence
provided by current anthropology, and on a conjectural backward
extrapolation from surviving documents. Neolithic peoples may have had
little leisure and little need for surveying, yet their drawings and
designs suggest a concern for spatial relationships that paved the way
for geometry. Pottery, weaving, and basketry show instances of
congruence and symmetry, which are in essence parts of elementary
geometry, and they appear on every continent. Moreover, simple sequences
in design, such as that in Fig. 1.1, suggest a sort of applied group
theory, as well as</p>
<p>FIG. 1.1</p>
<p>Spat ial Relat ions hips</p>
<p>propositions in geometry and arithmetic. The design makes it
immediately obvious that the areas of triangles are to one another as
squares on a side, or, through counting, that the sums of consecutive
odd numbers, beginning from unity, are perfect squares. For the
prehistoric period there are no documents; hence, it is impossible to
trace the evolution of mathematics from a specific design to a familiar
theorem. But ideas are like hardy spores, and sometimes the presumed
origin of a concept may be only the reappearance of a much more ancient
idea that had lain dormant.</p>
<p>The concern of prehistoric humans for spatial designs and
relationships may have stemmed from their aesthetic feeling and the
enjoyment of beauty of form, motives that often actuate the
mathematician of today. We would like to think that at least some of the
early geometers pursued their work for the sheer joy of doing
mathematics, rather than as a practical aid in mensuration, but there
are alternative theories. One of these is that geometry, like counting,
had an origin in primitive ritualistic practice. Yet the theory of the
origin of geometry in a secularization of ritualistic practice is by no
means established. The development of geometry may
justaswellhavebeenstimulatedbythepracticalneedsofconstructionand
surveying or by an aesthetic feeling for design and order.</p>
<p>We can make conjectures about what led people of the Stone Age to
count, to measure, and to draw. That the beginnings of mathematics are
older than the oldest civilizations is clear. To go further and
categorically identify a specific origin in space or time, however, is
to mistake conjecture for history. It is best to suspend judgment on
this matter and to move on to the safer ground of the history of
mathematics as found in the written documents that have come down to
us.</p>
<h2 id="ancient-egypt">2 Ancient Egypt</h2>
<p>Sesostris … made a division of the soil of Egypt among the
inhabitants. … If the river carried away any portion of a man’s lot, …
the king sent persons to examine, and determine by measurement the exact
extent of the loss. … From this practice, I think, geometry first came
to be known in Egypt, whence it passed into Greece.</p>
<p>Herodotus</p>
<h4 id="the-era-and-the-sources">The Era and the Sources</h4>
<p>About 450 BCE, Herodotus, the inveterate Greek traveler and narrative
historian, visited Egypt. He viewed ancient monuments, interviewed
priests, and observed the majesty of the Nile and the achievements of
those working along its banks. His resulting account would become a
cornerstone for the narrative of Egypt’s ancient history. When it came
to mathematics, he held that geometry had originated in Egypt, for he
believed that the subject had arisen there from the practical need for
resurveying after the
annualfloodingoftherivervalley.Acenturylater,thephilosopherAristotle
speculated on the same subject and attributed the Egyptians’ pursuit of
geometry to the existence of a priestly leisure class. The debate,

<p>The Era and t he S ource s</p>
<p>well beyond the confines of Egypt, about whether to credit progress
in mathematics to the practical men (the surveyors, or
“rope-stretchers”) or to the contemplative elements of society (the
priests and the philosophers) has continued to our times. As we shall
see, the history of mathematics displays a constant interplay between
these two types of contributors.</p>
<p>In attempting to piece together the history of mathematics in ancient
Egypt, scholars until the nineteenth century encountered two major
obstacles. The first was the inability to read the source materials that
existed. The second was the scarcity of such materials. For more than
thirty-five centuries, inscriptions used hieroglyphic writing, with
variations from purely ideographic to the smoother hieratic and
eventually the still more flowing demotic forms. After the third century
CE, when they were replaced by Coptic and eventually supplanted by
Arabic, knowledge of hieroglyphs faded. The breakthrough that enabled
modern scholars to decipher the ancient texts came early in the
nineteenth century when the French scholar Jean-Franc¸ois Champollion,
working with multilingual tablets, was able to slowly translate a number
of hieroglyphs. These studies were supplemented by those of other
scholars, including the British physicist Thomas Young, who were
intrigued by the Rosetta Stone, a trilingual basalt slab with
inscriptions in hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek writings that had been
found by members of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition in 1799. By 1822,
Champollion was able to announce a substantive portion of his
translations in a famous letter sent to the Academy of Sciences in
Paris, and by the time of his death in 1832, he had published a grammar
textbook and the beginning of a dictionary.</p>
<p>Although these early studies of hieroglyphic texts shed some light on
Egyptian numeration, they still produced no purely mathematical
materials. This situation changed in the second half of the nineteenth
century. In 1858, the Scottish antiquary Henry Rhind purchased a papyrus
roll in Luxor that is about one foot high and some eighteen feet long.
Except for a few fragments in the Brooklyn Museum, this papyrus is now
in the British Museum. It is known as the Rhind or the Ahmes Papyrus, in
honor of the scribe by whose hand it had been copied in about 1650 BCE.
The scribe tells us that the material is derived from a prototype from
the Middle Kingdom of about 2000 to 1800 BCE. Written in the hieratic
script, it became the major source of our knowledge of ancient Egyptian
mathematics. Another important papyrus, known as the Golenishchev or
Moscow Papyrus, was purchased in 1893 and is now in the Pushkin Museum
of Fine Arts in Moscow. It, too, is about eighteen feet long but is
onlyone-fourthaswideastheAhmesPapyrus.Itwaswrittenlesscarefully than the
work of Ahmes was, by an unknown scribe of circa. 1890 BCE. It
containstwenty-fiveexamples,mostlyfrompracticallifeandnotdiffering
greatly from those of Ahmes, except for two that will be discussed
further on. Yet another twelfth-dynasty papyrus, the Kahun, is now in
London; a Berlin papyrus is of the same period. Other, somewhat earlier,
materials are two wooden tablets from Akhmim of about 2000 BCE and a
leather roll containinga listof fractions.Mostof this
materialwasdeciphered withina hundred years of Champollion’s death.
There is a striking degree of coincidence between certain aspects of the
earliest known inscriptionsand the few mathematical texts of the Middle
Kingdom that constitute our known source material.</p>
<h4 id="numbers-and-fractions">Numbers and Fractions</h4>
<p>Once Champollion and his contemporaries could decipher inscriptions
on tombs and monuments, Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration was easily
disclosed. The system, at least as old as the pyramids, dating some
5,000 years ago, was based on the 10 scale. By the use of a simple
iterative scheme and of distinctive symbols for each ofthefirst
half-dozen powers of 10, numbers greater than a million were carved on
stone, wood, and other materials. A single vertical stroke represented a
unit, an inverted wicket was used for 10,a
snaresomewhatresemblingacapitalCstoodfor 100,a lotusflowerfor 1,000, a
bent finger for 10,000, a tadpole for 100,000, and a kneeling figure,
apparently Heh, the god of the Unending, for 1,000,000. Through
repetition of these symbols, the number 12,345, for example, would
appear as</p>
<p>Sometimes the smaller digits were placed on the left, and other times
the digits were arranged vertically. The symbols themselves were
occasionally reversed in orientation, so that the snare might be convex
toward either the right or the left.</p>
<p>Egyptian inscriptions indicate familiarity with large numbers at an
early date. A museum at Oxford has a royal mace more than 5,000 years
old, on which a record of 120,000 prisoners and 1,422,000 captive goats
appears. These figures may have been exaggerated, but from other
considerations it is clear that the Egyptians were commendably accurate
in counting and measuring. The construction of the Egyptian solar
calendar is an outstanding early example of observation, measurement,
and counting. The pyramids are another famous instance; they exhibit
such a high degree of precision in construction and orientation that
ill-founded legends have grown up around them.</p>
<p>The more cursive hieratic script used by Ahmes was suitably adapted
to the use of pen and ink on prepared papyrus leaves. Numeration
remained decimal, but the tedious repetitive principle of hieroglyphic
numeration was replaced by the introduction of ciphers or special signs
to represent digits and multiples of powers of 10. The number 4, for
example, usually was no longer represented by four vertical strokes
but</p>
<p>Numb er s and F rac t ions</p>
<p>by a horizontal bar, and 7 is not written as seven strokes but as a
single cipher resembling a sickle. The hieroglyphic form for the number
28 was ; the hieratic form was simply . Note that the cipher for the
smaller digit 8 (or two 4s) appears on the left, rather than on the
right. The principle of cipherization, introduced by the Egyptians some
4,000 years ago and used in the Ahmes Papyrus, represented an important
contribution to numeration, and it is one of the factors that makes our
own system in use today the effective instrument that it is.</p>
<p>Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions have a special notation for unit
fractions—that is, fractions with unit numerators. The reciprocal of any
integer was indicated simply by placing over the notation for the
integer an elongated oval sign. The fraction thus appeared as and was
written as . In the hieratic notation, appearing in papyri, the
elongated oval is replaced by a dot, which is placed over the cipher for
the corresponding integer (or over the right-hand cipher in the case of
the reciprocal of a multidigit number). In the Ahmes Papyrus, for
example, the fraction appears as , and is written as . Such unit
fractions were freely handled in Ahmes’s day, but the general fraction
seems to have been an enigma to the Egyptians. They felt comfortable
with the fraction , forwhichtheyhadaspecial
hieraticsign;occasionally,theyused special signs for fractions of the
form n=ðn11Þ, the complements of the unit fractions. To the fraction ,
the Egyptians assigned a special role in arithmetic processes, so that
in finding one-third of a number, they first found two-thirds of it and
subsequently took half of the result! They knew and used the fact that
two-thirds of the unit fraction 1=p is the sum of the two unit fractions
1=2p and 1=6p; they were also aware that double the unit fraction 1=2p
is the unit fraction 1=p. Yet it looks as though, apart fromthe
fraction,theEgyptiansregardedthegeneralproperrationalfractionofthe form
m=n not as an elementary “thing” but as part of an uncompleted process.
Where today we think of as a single irreducible fraction, Egyptian
scribes thought of it as reducible to the sum of three unit fractions,
and and .</p>
<p>To facilitate the reduction of “mixed” proper fractions to the sum of
unit fractions, the Ahmes Papyrus opens with a table expressing 2=n as a
sum of unit fractions for all odd values of n from 5 to 101. The
equivalent of is given as and , is written as and , and is expressed as
and . The last item in the table decomposes into and and and . It is not
clear why one form of decomposition was preferred to another of the
indefinitely many that are possible. This last entry certainly
exemplifies the Egyptian prepossession for halving and taking a third;
it is not at all clear to us why the decomposition
2=n51=n11=2n11=3n11=2U3Un is better than 1=n11=n. Perhaps one of the
objects of the 2=n decomposition was to arrive at unit fractions smaller
than 1=n. Certain passages indicate that the Egyptians had some
appreciation of general rules and methods above and beyond the specific
case at hand, and this represents an important step in the development
of mathematics.</p>
<h4 id="arithmetic-operations">Arithmetic Operations</h4>
<p>The 2/n table in the Ahmes Papyrus is followed by a short n/10 table
for n from 1 to 9, the fractions again being expressed in terms of the
favorites—unit fractions and the fraction . The fraction , for example,
is broken into and and . Ahmes had begun his work with the assurance
that it would provide a “complete and thorough study of all things…and
the knowledge of all secrets,” and therefore the main portion of the
material, following the 2/n and n/10 tables, consists of eighty-four
widely assorted problems. The first six of these require the division of
one or two or six or seven or eight or nine loaves of bread among ten
men, and the scribe makes use of the n/10 table that he has just given.
In the first problem, the scribe goes to considerable trouble to show
that it is correct to give to each of the ten men one tenth of a loaf!
If one man receives of a loaf, two men will receive or and four men will
receive of a loaf or 1 of a loaf. Hence, eight men will receive 1 of a
loaf or 11 of a loaf, and eight men plus two men will receive 111, or a
whole loaf. Ahmes seems to have had a kind of equivalent to our least
common multiple, which enabled him to complete the proof. In the
division of seven loaves among ten men, the scribe might have chosen 1
of a loaf for each, but the predilection for led him instead to and of a
loaf for each.</p>
<p>The fundamental arithmetic operation in Egypt was addition, and our
operations of multiplication and division were performed in Ahmes’s day
through successive doubling, or “duplation.” Our own word
“multiplication,” or manifold, is, in fact, suggestive of the Egyptian
process. A multiplication of, say, 69 by 19 would be performed by adding
69 to itself to obtain 138, then adding this to itself to reach 276,
applying duplation again to get 552, and once more to obtain 1104, which
is, of course, 16 times 69. Inasmuch as 195161211, the result of
multiplying 69 by 19 is 11041138169, that is, 1311. Occasionally, a
multiplication by 10 was also used, for this was a natural concomitant
of the decimal hieroglyphic notation. Multiplication of combinations of
unit fractions was also a part of Egyptian arithmetic. Problem 13 in the
Ahmes Papyrus, for example, asks for the product of 1 and 111; the
result is correctly found to be . For division, the duplation process is
reversed, and the divisor, instead of the multiplicand, is successively
doubled. That the Egyptians had developed a high degree of artistry in
applying the duplation process and the unit fraction concept is apparent
from the calculations in the problems of Ahmes. Problem 70 calls for the
quotient when 100 is divided by 7111; the result,</p>
<p>‘‘He ap’’ P r oble ms</p>
<p>12111, is obtained as follows. Doubling the divisor successively, we
first obtain 1511, then 311, and finally 63, which is 8 times the
divisor. Moreover, of the divisor is known to be 51. Hence, the divisor
when multiplied by 8141 will total 99, which is short of the product 100
that is desired. Here a clever adjustment was made. Inasmuch as 8 times
the divisor is 63, it follows that the divisor when multiplied by will
produce . From the 2/n table, one knows that is</p>
<p>1; hence, the desired quotient is 12111. Incidentally, this procedure
makes use of a commutative principle in multiplication, with which the
Egyptians evidently were familiar.</p>
<p>Many of Ahmes’s problems show knowledge of manipulations of
proportions equivalent to the “rule of three.” Problem 72 calls for the
number of loaves of bread of “strength” 45, which are equivalent to 100
loaves of “strength” 10, and the solution is given as 100/10 3 45, or
450 loaves. In bread and beer problems, the “strength,” or pesu, is the
reciprocal of the grain density, being the quotient of the number of
loaves or units of volume divided by the amount of grain. Bread and beer
problems are numerous in the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 63, for example,
requires the division of 700 loaves of bread among four recipients if
the amounts they are to receive are in the continued proportion : : : .
The solution is found by taking the ratio of 700 to the sum of the
fractions in the proportion. In this case, the quotient of 700 divided
by 1 is found by multiplying 700 by the reciprocal of the divisor, which
is 1. The result is 400; by taking and and and of this, the required
shares of bread are found.</p>
<p>‘‘Heap’’ Problems</p>
<p>The Egyptian problems so far described are best classified as
arithmetic, but there are others that fall into a class to which the
term “algebraic” is appropriately applied. These do not concern specific
concrete objects, such as bread and beer, nor do they call for
operations on known numbers. Instead, they require the equivalent of
solutions of linear equations of the form x1ax5b or x1ax1bx5c, where a
and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as
“aha,” or heap. Problem 24, for instance, calls for the value of heap if
heap and of heap is 19. The solution given by Ahmes is not that of
modern textbooks but is characteristic of a procedure now known as the
“method of false position,” or the “rule of false.” A specific value,
most likely a false one, is assumed for heap, and the operations
indicated on the left-hand side of the equality sign are performed on
this assumed number. The result of these operations is then compared
with the result desired, and by the use of proportions the correct
answer is found. In problem 24, the tentative value of the unknown is
taken as 7, so that x1x is 8, instead of the desired answer, which was
19. Inasmuch as 8ð211Þ519, one must multiply 7 by 211 to obtain the
correct heap; Ahmes found the answer to be 1611. Ahmes then “checked”
his result by showing that if to 1611 one adds of this (which is 211),
one does indeed obtain 19. Here we see another significant step in the
development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a
proof. Although the method of false position was generally used by
Ahmes, there is one problem (Problem 30) in which x1x1x1x537 is solved
by factoring the left-hand side of the equation and dividing 37 by</p>
<p>1111; the result being 16111:</p>
<p>Many of the “aha” calculations in the Rhind (Ahmes) Papyrus appear to
be practice exercises for young students. Although a large proportion of
them are of a practical nature, in some places the scribe seemed to have
had puzzles or mathematical recreations in mind. Thus, Problem 79 cites
only “seven houses, 49 cats, 343 mice, 2401 ears of spelt, 16807
hekats.” It is presumed that the scribe was dealing with a problem,
perhaps quite well known, where in each of seven houses there are seven
cats, each of which eats seven mice, each of which would have eaten
seven ears of grain, each of which would have produced seven measures of
grain. The problem evidently called not for the practical answer, which
would be the number of measures of grain that were saved, but for the
impractical sum of the numbers of houses, cats, mice, ears of spelt, and
measures of grain. This bit of fun in the Ahmes Papyrus seems to be a
forerunner of our familiar nursery rhyme:</p>
<p>As I was going to St. Ives,</p>
<p>I met a man with seven wives;</p>
<p>Every wife had seven sacks,</p>
<p>Every sack had seven cats,</p>
<p>Every cat had seven kits,</p>
<p>Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,</p>
<p>How many were going to St. Ives?</p>
<p>Geometric Problems</p>
<p>It is often said that the ancient Egyptians were familiar with the
Pythagorean theorem, but there is no hint of this in the papyri that
have come down to us. There are nevertheless some geometric problems in
the Ahmes Papyrus. Problem 51 of Ahmes shows that the area of an
isosceles triangle was found by taking half of what we would call the
base and multiplying this by the altitude. Ahmes justified his method of
finding the area by suggesting that the isosceles triangle can be
thought of as two right triangles, one of which can be shifted in
position, so that together the two triangles form a rectangle. The
isosceles trapezoid is</p>
<p>Ge ome tr ic P r oble ms</p>
<p>similarly handled in Problem 52, in which the larger base of a
trapezoid is 6, the smaller base is 4, and the distance between them is
20. Taking of the sum of the bases, “so as to make a rectangle,” Ahmes
multiplied this by 20 to find the area. In transformations such as
these, in which isosceles triangles and trapezoids are converted into
rectangles, we may see the beginnings of a theory of congruence and the
idea of proof in geometry, but there is no evidence that the Egyptians
carried such work further. Instead, their geometry lacks a clear-cut
distinction between relationships that are exact and those that are only
approximations.</p>
<p>A surviving deed from Edfu, dating from a period some 1,500 years
after Ahmes, gives examples of triangles, trapezoids, rectangles, and
more general quadrilaterals. The rule for finding the area of the
general quadrilateral is to take the product of the arithmetic means of
the opposite sides. Inaccurate though the rule is, the author of the
deed deduced from it a corollary—that the area of a triangle is half of
the sum of two sides multiplied by half of the third side. This is a
striking instance of the search for relationships among geometric
figures, as well as an early use of the zero concept as a replacement
for a magnitude in geometry.</p>
<p>The Egyptian rule for finding the area of a circle has long been
regarded as one of the outstanding achievements of the time. In Problem
50, the scribe Ahmes assumed that the area of a circular field with a
diameter of 9 units is the same as the area of a square with a side of 8
units. If we compare this assumption with the modern formula A5πr2, we
find the Egyptian rule to be equivalent to giving π a value of about 3,
a commendably close approximation, but here again we miss any hint that
Ahmes was aware that the areas of his circle and square were not exactly
equal. It is possible that Problem 48 gives a hint to the way in which
the Egyptians were led to their area of the circle. In this problem, the
scribe formed an octagon from a square having sides of 9 units by
trisecting the sides and cutting off the four corner isosceles
triangles, each having an area of 4 units. The area of the octagon,
which does not differ greatly from that of a circle inscribed within the
square, is 63 units, which is not far removed from the area of a square
with 8 units on a side. That the number 4(8/9)2 did indeed play a role
comparable to our constant π seems to be confirmed by the Egyptian rule
for the circumference of a circle, according to which the ratio of the
area of a circle to the circumference is the same as the ratio of the
area of the circumscribed square to its perimeter. This observation
represents a geometric relationship of far greater precision and
mathematical significance than the relatively good approximation for
π.</p>
<p>Degree of accuracy in approximation is not a good measure of either
mathematical or architectural achievement, and we should not
overemphasize this aspect of Egyptian work. Recognition by the Egyptians
of interrelationships among geometric figures, on the other hand, has
too often been overlooked, and yet it is here that they came closest in
attitude to their successors, the Greeks. No theorem or formal proof is
known in Egyptian mathematics, but some of the geometric comparisons
made in the Nile Valley, such as those on the perimeters and the areas
of circles and squares, are among the first exact statements in history
concerning curvilinear figures.</p>
<p>The value of is often used today for π; but we must recall that
Ahmes’s value for π is about 3, not 3. That Ahmes’s value was also used
by other Egyptians is confirmed in a papyrus roll from the twelfth
dynasty (the Kahun Papyrus), in which the volume of a cylinder is found
by multiplying the height by the area of the base, the base being
determined according to Ahmes’s rule.</p>
<p>Associated with Problem 14 in the Moscow Papyrus is a figure that
looks like an isosceles trapezoid (see Fig. 2.1), but the calculations
associated with it indicate that a frustum of a square pyramid is
intended. Above and below the figure are signs for 2 and 4,
respectively, and within the figure are the hieratic symbols for 6 and
56. The directions</p>
<p>Reproduction (top) of a portion of the Moscow Papyrus, showing the
problem of the volume of a frustum of a square pyramid, together with
hieroglyphic transcription (below)</p>
<p>Ge ome tr ic P r oble ms</p>
<p>alongside make it clear that the problem calls for the volume of a
frustum of a square pyramid 6 units high if the edges of the upper and
lower bases are 2 and 4 units, respectively. The scribe directs one to
square the numbers 2 and 4 and to add to the sum of these squares the
product of 2 and 4, the result being 28. This result is then multiplied
by a third of 6, and the scribe concludes with the words “See, it is 56;
you have found it correctly.” That is, the volume of the frustum has
been calculated in accordance with the modern formula V5h(a2 1ab1b2)/3,
where h is the altitude and a and b are the sides of the square bases.
Nowhere is this formula written out, but in substance it evidently was
known to the Egyptians. If, as in the deed from Edfu, one takes b50, the
formula reduces to the familiar formula, one-third the base times the
altitude, for the volume of a pyramid.</p>
<p>How these results were arrived at by the Egyptians is not known. An
empirical origin for the rule on the volume of a pyramid seems to be a
possibility, but not for the volume of the frustum. For the latter, a
theoretical basis seems more likely, and it has been suggested that the
Egyptians may have proceeded here as they did in the cases of the
isosceles triangle and the isosceles trapezoid—they may mentally have
broken the frustum into parallelepipeds, prisms, and pyramids. On
replacing the pyramids and the prisms by equal rectangular blocks, a
plausible grouping of the blocks leads to the Egyptian formula. One
could, for example, have begun with a pyramid having a square base and
with the vertex directly over one of the base vertices. An obvious
decomposition of the frustum would be to break it into four parts as in
Fig. 2.2—a rectangular parallelepiped having a volume b2h, two
triangular prisms, each with a volume of b(a2b)h/2, and a pyramid of
volume (a2b)2h/3. The prisms can be combined into a rectangular
parallelepiped with dimensions b and a2b and h; and the pyramid can be
thought of as a rectangular parallelepiped with dimensions a2b and a2b
and h/3. On cutting up the tallest parallelepipeds so that all altitudes
are h/3, one can easily arrange the slabs so as to form three layers,
each of altitude h/3, and having cross-sectional areas of a2 and ab and
b2, respectively.</p>
<p>FIG. 2.2</p>
<p>Problem 10 in the Moscow Papyrus presents a more difficult question
of interpretation than does Problem 14. Here the scribe asks for the
surface area of what looks like a basket with a diameter of 4. He
proceeds as though he were using the equivalent of a formula S5ð12
19Þ12ð22xÞUx; where x is 4, obtaining an answer of 32 units. Inasmuch as
ð12 9Þ is the Egyptian approximation of π/4, the answer 32 would
correspond to the surface of a hemisphere of diameter 4, and this was
the interpretation given to the problem in 1930. Such a result,
antedating the oldest known calculation of a hemispherical surface by
some 1,500 years, would have been amazing, and it seems, in fact, to
have been too good to be true. Later analysis indicates that the
“basket” may have been a roof—somewhat like that of a Quonset hut in the
shape of a half-cylinder of diameter 4 and length 4. The calculation in
this case calls for nothing beyond knowledge of the length of a
semicircle, and the obscurity of the text makes it admissible to offer
still more primitive interpretations, including the possibility that the
calculation is only a rough estimate of the area of a domelike barn
roof. In any case, we seem to have here an early estimation of a
curvilinear surface area.</p>
<h4 id="slope-problems">Slope Problems</h4>
<p>In the construction of the pyramids, it had been essential to
maintain a uniform slope for the faces, and it may have been this
concern that led the Egyptians to introduce a concept equivalent to the
cotangent of an angle. In modern technology, it is customary to measure
the steepness of a straight line through the ratio of the “rise” to the
“run.” In Egypt, it was</p>
<p>Ar i t hme t ic P ra gmat i sm</p>
<p>customary to use the reciprocal of this ratio. There, the word “seqt”
meant the horizontal departure of an oblique line from the vertical axis
for every unit change in the height. The seqt thus corresponded, except
for the units of measurement, to the batter used today by architects to
describe the inward slope of a masonry wall or pier. The vertical unit
of length was the cubit, but in measuring the horizontal distance, the
unit used was the “hand,” of which there were seven in a cubit. Hence,
the seqt of the face of a pyramid was the ratio of run to rise, the
former measured in hands, the latter in cubits.</p>
<p>In Problem 56 of the Ahmes Papyrus, one is asked to find the seqt of
a pyramid that is 250 ells or cubits high and has a square base 360 ells
on a side. The scribe first divided 360 by 2 and then divided the result
by 250, obtaining 11 in ells. Multiplying the result by 7, he gave the
seqt as 5 in hands per ell. In other pyramid problems in the Ahmes
Papyrus, the seqt turns out to be 5, agreeing somewhat better with that
of the great Cheops Pyramid, 440 ells wide and 280 high, the seqt being
5 hands per ell.</p>
<h4 id="arithmetic-pragmatism">Arithmetic Pragmatism</h4>
<p>The knowledge indicated in extant Egyptian papyri is mostly of a
practical nature, and calculation was the chief element in the
questions. Where some theoretical elements appear to enter, the purpose
may have been to facilitate technique. Even the once-vaunted Egyptian
geometry turns out to have been mainly a branch of applied arithmetic.
Where elementary congruence relations enter, the motive seems to be to
provide mensurational devices. The rules of calculation concern specific
concrete cases only. The Ahmes and Moscow papyri, our two chief sources
of information, may have been only manuals intended for students, but
they nevertheless indicate the direction and tendencies in Egyptian
mathematical instruction. Further evidence provided by inscriptions on
monuments, fragments of other mathematical papyri, and documents from
related scientific fields serves to confirm the general impression. It
is true that our two chief mathematical papyri are from a relatively
early period, a thousand years before the rise of Greek mathematics, but
Egyptian mathematics seems to have remained remarkably uniform
throughout its long history. It was at all stages built around the
operation of addition, a disadvantage that gave to Egyptian computation
a peculiar primitivity, combined with occasionally astonishing
complexity.</p>
<p>The fertile Nile Valley has been described as the world’s largest
oasis in the world’s largest desert. Watered by one of the most
gentlemanly of rivers and geographically shielded to a great extent from
foreign invasion, it was a haven for peace-loving people who pursued, to
a large extent, a calm and unchallenged way of life. Love of the
beneficent gods, respect for tradition, and preoccupation with death and
the needs of the dead all encouraged a high degree of stagnation.
Geometry may have been a gift of the Nile, as Herodotus believed, but
the available evidence suggests that Egyptians used the gift but did
little to expand it. The

<p>How much is one god beyond the other god?</p>
<p>An Old Babylonian astronomical text</p>
<h4 id="the-era-and-the-sources-1">The Era and the Sources</h4>
<p>The fourth millennium before our era was a period of remarkable
cultural development, bringing with it the use of writing, the wheel,
and metals. As in Egypt during the first dynasty, which began toward the
end of this extraordinary millennium, so also in the Mesopotamian Valley
there was at the time a high order of civilization. There the Sumerians
had built homes and temples decorated with artistic pottery and mosaics
in geometric patterns. Powerful rulers united the local principalities
into an empire that completed vast public works, such as a system of
canals to irrigate the land and control flooding between the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers, where the overflow of the rivers was not predictable,
as was the inundation of the Nile Valley. The cuneiform pattern of
writing that the Sumerians had developed during the fourth millennium
probably antedates the Egyptian hieroglyphic system.</p>
<p>The Mesopotamian civilizations of antiquity are often referred to
as</p>
<p>Babylonian, although such a designation is not strictly correct. The
city of</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Babylon was not at first, nor was it always at later periods, the
center of the culture associated with the two rivers, but convention has
sanctioned
theinformaluseofthename“Babylonian”fortheregionduringtheinterval from

Persia, the city was spared, but the Babylonian Empire had come to an
end. “Babylonian” mathematics, however, continued through the Seleucid
period in Syria almost to the dawn of Christianity.</p>
<p>Then, as today, the Land of the Two Rivers was open to invasions from
many directions, making the Fertile Crescent a battlefield with
frequently
changinghegemony.Oneofthemostsignificantoftheinvasionswasthatby the
Semitic Akkadians under Sargon I (ca. 2276 2221 BCE), or Sargon the
Great. He established an empire that extended from the Persian Gulf in
the south to the Black Sea in the north, and from the steppes of Persia
in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Under Sargon, the
invaders began a gradual absorption of the indigenous Sumerian culture,
including the cuneiform script. Later invasions and revolts brought
various racial strains—Ammorites, Kassites, Elamites, Hittites,
Assyrians, Medes, Persians, andothers—to political power at onetime or
another inthevalley, but there remained in the area a sufficiently high
degree of cultural unity to justify referring to the civilization simply
as Mesopotamian. In particular, the use of cuneiform script formed a
strong bond.</p>

site of ancient Nippur, we have some 50,000 tablets. The university
libraries at Columbia, Pennsylvania, and Yale, among others, have large

mathematical. Despite the availability of documents, however, it was the
Egyptian hieroglyphic, rather than the Babylonian cuneiform, that was
first decipheredin moderntimes.The GermanphilologistF.W.Grotefendhadmade
some progress in the reading of Babylonian script early in the
nineteenth century, but only during the second quarter of the twentieth
century did substantial accounts of Mesopotamian mathematics begin to
appear in histories of antiquity.</p>
<h4 id="cuneiform-writing">Cuneiform Writing</h4>
<p>The early use of writing in Mesopotamia is attested to by hundreds of
clay tablets found in Uruk and dating from about 5,000 years ago. By
this time, picture writing had reached the point where conventionalized
stylized forms were used for many things: for water, for eye, and</p>
<p>Po s i t ional Num erat ion</p>
<p>combinations of these to indicate weeping. Gradually, the number of
signs became smaller, so that of some 2,000 Sumerian signs originally
used, only a third remained by the time of the Akkadian conquest.
Primitive drawings gave way to combinations of wedges: water became and
eye . At first, the scribe wrote from top to bottom in columns from
right to left; later, for convenience, the table was rotated
counterclockwise through 90, and the scribe wrote from left to right in
horizontal rows from top to bottom. The stylus, which formerly had been
a triangular prism, was replaced by a right circular cylinder—or,
rather, two cylinders of unequal radius. During the earlier days of the
Sumerian civilization, the end of the stylus was pressed into the clay
vertically to represent 10 units and obliquely to represent a unit,
using the smaller stylus; similarly, an oblique impression with the
larger stylus indicated 60 units and a vertical impression indicated
3,600 units. Combinations of these were used to represent intermediate
numbers.</p>
<h4 id="numbers-and-fractions-sexagesimals">Numbers and Fractions:
Sexagesimals</h4>
<p>As the Akkadians adopted the Sumerian form of writing, lexicons were
compiled giving equivalents in the two tongues, and forms of words and
numerals became less varied. Thousands of tablets from about the time of
the Hammurabi dynasty (ca. 1800 1600 BCE) illustrate a number system
that had become well established. The decimal system, common to most
civilizations, both ancient and modern, had been submerged in
Mesopotamia under a notation that made fundamental the base 60. Much has
been written about the motives behind this change; it has been suggested
that astronomical considerations may have been instrumental or that the
sexagesimal scheme might have been the natural combination of two
earlier schemes, one decimal and the other using the base 6. It appears
more likely, however, that the base 60 was consciously adopted and
legalized in the interests of metrology, for a magnitude of 60 units can
be subdivided easily into halves, thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths,
tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths, thus affording
ten possible subdivisions. Whatever the origin, the sexagesimal system
of numeration has enjoyed a remarkably long life, for remnants survive,
unfortunately for consistency, even to this day in units of time and
angle measure, despite the fundamentally decimal form of mathematics in
our society.</p>
<p>Positional Numeration</p>
<p>Babylonian cuneiform numeration, for smaller whole numbers, proceeded
along the same lines as did the Egyptian hieroglyphic, with repetitions
of the symbols for units and tens. Where the Egyptian architect, carving
on stone, might write 59 as , the Mesopotamian scribe could similarly
represent the same number on a clay tablet through fourteen wedge-shaped
marks—five broad sideways wedges or “angle-brackets,” each representing
10 units, and nine thin vertical wedges, each standing for a unit, all
juxtaposed in a neat group as . Beyond the number 59, however, the
Egyptian and Babylonian systems differed markedly. Perhaps it was the
inflexibility of the Mesopotamian writing materials, possibly it was a
flash of imaginative insight that made the Babylonians realize that
their two symbols for units and tens sufficed for the representation of
any integer, however large, without excessive repetitiveness. This was
made possible through their invention, some 4,000 years ago, of the
positional notation—the same principle that accounts for the
effectiveness of our present numeral forms. That is, the ancient
Babylonians saw that their symbols could be assigned values that depend
on their relative positions in the representation of a number. Our
number 222 makes use of the same cipher three times, but with a
different meaning each time. Once it represents two units, the second
time it means two 10s, and finally it stands for two 100s (that is,
twice the square of the base 10). In a precisely analogous way, the</p>
<p>Babylonians made multiple use of such a symbol as . When they
wrote</p>
<p>, clearly separating the three groups of two wedges each, they
understood the right-hand group to mean two units, the next group to
mean twice their base, 60, and the left-hand group to signify twice the
square of their base. This numeral, therefore, denoted 2(60)2 12(60)12
(or 7,322 in our notation).</p>
<p>A wealth of primary material exists concerning Mesopotamian
mathematics, but, oddly enough, most of it comes from two periods widely
separated in time. There is an abundance of tablets from the first few
hundred years of the second millennium BCE (the Old Babylonian age), and
many tablets have also been found dating from the last few centuries of
the first millennium BCE (the Seleucid period). Most of the important
contributions to mathematics will be found to go back to the earlier
period, but one contribution is not in evidence until almost 300 BCE.
The Babylonians seem at first to have had no clear way in which to
indicate an “empty” position—that is, they did not have a zero symbol,
although they sometimes left a space where a zero was intended. This
meant that their forms for the numbers 122 and 7,202 looked very much
alike, for might mean either 2(60)12 or 2(60)2 12. Context in many cases
could be relied on to relieve some of the ambiguity, but the lack of a
zero symbol, such as enables us to distinguish at a glance between 22
and 202, must have been quite inconvenient.</p>
<p>By about the time of the conquest by Alexander the Great, however, a
special sign, consisting of two small wedges placed obliquely, was
invented to serve as a placeholder where a numeral was missing. From
that time on, as long as cuneiform was used, the number , or 2(60)2
10(60)12, was readily distinguishable from , or 2(60)12.</p>
<p>A pp r o x imat ions</p>
<p>The Babylonian zero symbol apparently did not end all ambiguity, for
the sign seems to have been used for intermediate empty positions only.
There are no extant tablets in which the zero sign appears in a terminal
position. This means that the Babylonians in antiquity never achieved an
absolute positional system. Position was only relative; hence, the
symbol could represent 2(60)12 or 2(60)2 12(60) or 2(60)3 12(60)2 or any
one of indefinitely many other numbers in which two successive positions
are involved.</p>
<h4 id="sexagesimal-fractions">Sexagesimal Fractions</h4>
<p>Had Mesopotamian mathematics, like that of the Nile Valley, been
based on the addition of integers and unit fractions, the invention of
the positional notation would not have been greatly significant at the
time. It is not much more difficult to write 98,765 in hieroglyphic
notation than in cuneiform, and the latter is definitely more difficult
to write than the same number in hieratic script. The secret of the
superiority of Babylonian mathematics over that of the Egyptians lies in
the fact that those who lived “between the two rivers” took the most
felicitous step of extending the principle of position to cover
fractions as well as whole numbers. That is, the notation was used not
only for 2(60)12, but also for 212(60) 1 or for 2(60) 1 12(60) 2 or for
other fractional forms involving two successive positions. This meant
that the Babylonians had at their command the computational power that
the modern decimal fractional notation affords us today. For the
Babylonian scholar, as for the modern engineer, the addition or the
multiplication of 23.45 and 9.876 was essentially no more difficult than
was the addition or the multiplication of the whole numbers 2,345 and
9,876, and the Mesopotamians were quick to exploit this important
discovery.</p>
<h4 id="approximations">Approximations</h4>
<p>An Old Babylonian tablet from the Yale Collection (No. 7289) includes
the calculation of the square root of 2 to three sexagesimal places, the
answer being written . In modern characters, this number can be
appropriately written as 1;24,51,10, where a semicolon is used to
separate the integral and fractional parts, and a comma is used as a
separatrix for the sexagesimal positions. This form will generally be
used throughout this chapter to designate numbers in sexagesimal
notation. Translating this notation into decimal form, we have 1124(60)
1 151</p>
<ol start="60" type="1">
<li>2 110(60) 3. This Babylonian value for p2 is equal to approximately
1.414222, differing by about 0.000008 from the true value. Accuracy in
approximations was relatively easy for the Babylonians to achieve with
their fractional notation, which was rarely equaled until the time of
the Renaissance.</li>
</ol>
<p>The effectiveness of Babylonian computation did not result from their
system of numeration alone. Mesopotamian mathematicians were skillful in
developing algorithmic procedures, among which was a square-root process
often ascribed to later men. It is sometimes attributed to the Greek
scholar Archytas (428 365 BCE) or to Heron of Alexandria (ca. 100 CE);
occasionally, one finds it called Newton’s algorithm. This Babylonian
procedure is as simple as it is effective. Let x5pa be the root desired,
and let a1 be a first approximation to this root; let a second
approximation be found from the equation b1 5a/a1. If a1 is too small,
then b1 is too large, and vice versa. Hence, the arithmetic mean a2
512ða1 1b1Þ is a plausible next approximation. Inasmuch as a2 is always
too large, the next approximation, b2 5a/a2, will be too small, and one
takes the arithmetic mean a3 512ða2 1b2Þ to obtain a still better
result; the procedure can bep continued indefinitely. The value of 2 on
Yale Tablet 7289 will be found to be that of a3, where a1 51;30. In the
Babylonian square-root algorithm, one finds an iterative procedure that
could have put the mathematicians of the time in touch with infinite
processes, but scholars of that era did not pursue the implications of
such problems.</p>
<p>The algorithm just described is equivalent to a two-term
approximation to the binomial series, a case with which the Babylonians
were familiar. If pa2 1b is desired, the approximation a1 5a leads to b1
5(a2 1b)/a and a2 5(a1 1b1)/25a1b/(2a), which is in agreement with the
first two terms in the expansion of (a2 1b)1/2 and provides an
approximation found in Old Babylonian texts.</p>
<h4 id="tables">Tables</h4>
<p>A substantial proportion of the cuneiform tablets that have been
unearthed are “table texts,” including multiplication tables, tables of
reciprocals, and tables of squares and cubes and of square and cube
roots written, of course, in cuneiform sexagesimals. One of these, for
example, carries the equivalents of the entries shown in the following
table:</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>320</p>
<p>415</p>
<p>512</p>
<p>610</p>
<p>87;30</p>
<p>96;40</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>12 5</p>
<p>The product of elements in the same line is in all cases 60, the
Babylonian number base, and the table apparently was thought of as a
table of reciprocals. The sixth line, for example, denotes that the
reciprocal of 8 is 7/60130/(60)2. It will be noted that the reciprocals
of 7 and 11 are</p>
<p>Table s</p>
<p>missing from the table, because the reciprocals of such “irregular”
numbers are nonterminating sexagesimals, just as in our decimal system
the reciprocals of 3, 6, 7, and 9 are infinite when expanded decimally.
Again, the Babylonians were faced with the problem of infinity, but they
did not consider it systematically. At one point, however, a
Mesopotamian scribe seems to give upper and lower bounds for the
reciprocal of the irregular number 7, placing it between 0;8,34,16,59
and 0;8,34,18.</p>
<p>It is clear that the fundamental arithmetic operations were handled
by the Babylonians in a manner not unlike that which would be employed
today, and with comparable facility. Division was not carried out by the
clumsy duplication method of the Egyptians, but through an easy
multiplication of the dividend by the reciprocal of the divisor, using
the appropriate items in the table texts. Just as today the quotient of
34 divided by 5 is easily found by multiplying 34 by 2 and shifting the
decimal point, so in antiquity the same division problem was carried out
by finding the product of 34 by 12 and shifting one sexagesimal place to
obtain 6. Tables of reciprocals in general furnished reciprocals only of
“regular” integers—that is, those that can be written as products of
twos, threes, and fives—although there are a few exceptions. One table
text includes the approximations 5;1,1,1 and 5;0,59,0,59. Here we
have</p>
<p>sexagesimal analogues of our decimal expressions 5:111 and</p>
<p>5:0909, unit fractions in which the denominator is one more or one
less than the base, but it appears again that the Babylonians did not
notice, or at least did not regard as significant, the infinite periodic
expansions in this connection.</p>
<p>One finds among the Old Babylonian tablets some table texts
containing successive powers of a given number, analogous to our modern
tables of logarithms or, more properly speaking, of antilogarithms.
Exponential (or logarithmic) tables have been found in which the first
ten powers are listed for the bases 9 and 16 and 1,40 and 3,45 (all
perfect squares). The question raised in a problem text asking to what
power a certain number must be raised in order to yield a given number
is equivalent to our question “What is the logarithm of the given number
in a system with a certain number as base?” The chief differences
between the ancient tables and our own, apart from matters of language
and notation, are that no single number was systematically used as a
base in various connections and that the gaps between entries in the
ancient tables are far larger than in our tables. Then, too, their
“logarithm tables” were not used for general purposes of calculation,
but rather to solve certain very specific questions.</p>
<p>Despite the large gaps in their exponential tables, Babylonian
mathematicians did not hesitate to interpolate by proportional parts to
approximate intermediate values. Linear interpolation seems to have been
a commonplace procedure in ancient Mesopotamia, and the positional
notation lent itself conveniently to the rule of three. A clear instance
of the practical use of interpolation within exponential tables is seen
in a problem text that asks how long it will take money to double at 20
percent annually; the answer given is 3;47,13,20. It seems to be quite
clear that the scribe used linear interpolation between the values for
(1;12)3 and (1;12)4, following the compound interest formula a5 P(11r)n,
where r is 20 percent, or , and reading values from an exponential table
with powers of 1;12.</p>
<h4 id="equations">Equations</h4>
<p>One table for which the Babylonians found considerable use is a
tabulation of the values of n3 1n2 for integral values of n, a table
essential in Babylonian algebra; this subject reached a considerably
higher level in Mesopotamia than in Egypt. Many problem texts from the
Old Babylonian period show that the solution of the complete three-term
quadratic equation afforded the Babylonians no serious difficulty, for
flexible algebraic operations had been developed. They could transpose
terms in an equation by adding equals to equals, and they could multiply
both sides by like quantities to remove fractions or to eliminate
factors. By adding 4ab to (a 2b)2 they could obtain (a 1b)2, for they
were familiar with many simple forms of factoring. They did not use
letters for unknown quantities, for the alphabet had not yet been
invented, but words such as “length,” “breadth,” “area,” and “volume”
served effectively in this capacity. That these words may well have been
used in a very abstract sense is suggested by the fact that the
Babylonians had no qualms about adding a “length” to an “area” or an
“area” to a “volume.”</p>
<p>Egyptian algebra had been much concerned with linear equations, but
the Babylonians evidently found these too elementary for much attention.
In one problem, the weight x of a stone is called for if ðx1x / 7Þ1ðx1x
/ 7Þ is one mina; the answer is simply given as 48;7,30 gin, where 60
gin make a mina. In another problem in an Old Babylonian text, we find
two simultaneous linear equations in two unknown quantities, called
respectively the “first silver ring” and the “second silver ring.” If we
call these x and y in our notation, the equations are x/71y/1151 and
6x/75l0y/11. The answer is expressed laconically in terms of the
rule</p>
<p>x 11 1 y 7 1</p>
<p>5 1 and 5 2 :</p>
<p>7 7111 72 11 7111 72</p>
<p>In another pair of equations, part of the method of solution is
included in the text. Here width1length57 hands, and length1width510
hands. The solution is first found by replacing each “hand” with 5
“fingers” and then noticing that a width of 20 fingers and a length of
30 fingers will satisfy both equations. Following this, however, the
solution is found by an alternative method equivalent to an elimination
through combination.</p>
<p>Equat ions</p>
<p>Expressing all dimensions in terms of hands, and letting the length
and the width be x and y, respectively, the equations become y14x528 and
x1y510. Subtracting the second equation from the first, one has the
result 3x518; hence, x56 hands, or 30 fingers, and y520 fingers.</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The solution of a three-term quadratic equation seems to have
exceeded by far the algebraic capabilities of the Egyptians, but Otto
Neugebauer in 1930 disclosed that such equations had been handled
effectively by the Babylonians in some of the oldest problem texts. For
instance, one problem calls for the side of a square if the area less
the side is 14,30. The solution of this problem, equivalent to solving
x2 2x5870, is expressed as follows:</p>
<p>Take half of 1, which is 0;30, and multiply 0;30 by 0;30, which is
0;15; add this to 14,30 to get l4,30;15. This is the square of 29;30.
Now add 0;30 to 29;30, and the result is 30, the side of the square.</p>
<p>The Babylonian solution is, of course, exactly equivalent to the
forwhich is the quadratic formula that is familiar to high school
students ofpð Þ2 2 2 mula x5 p=2 1q1p=2 for a root of the equation x
2px5q,</p>
<p>today. In another text, the equation 1x 17x56;15 was reduced by the
Babylonians to the standard type x2 1px5q by first multiplying through
by 11 to obtain (11x)2 17(11x)51,8;45. This is a quadratic in normal
form in the unknown quantity y511x, and the solution for y is easily
value of x is then determined. This solution is remarkable as an
instancepð Þ2 obtained by the familiar rule y5 p=2 1q2p=2, from which
the</p>
<p>of the use of algebraic transformations.</p>
<p>Until modern times, there was no thought of solving a quadratic
equation of the form x2 1px1q50, where p and q are positive, for the
equation has no positive root. Consequently, quadratic equations in
ancient and medieval times—and even in the early modern period— were
classified under three types:</p>
<p>1.x2 1px5q</p>
<p>2.x2 5px1q 3. x2 1q5px</p>
<p>All three types are found in Old Babylonian texts of some 4,000 years
ago. The first two types are illustrated by the problems given
previously; the third type appears frequently in problem texts, where it
is treated as equivalent to the simultaneous system x1y5p, xy5q. So
numerous are problems in which one is asked to find two numbers when
given their product and either their sum or their difference that these
seem to have constituted for the ancients, both Babylonian and Greek, a
sort of “normal form” to which quadratics were reduced. Then, by
transforming the simultaneous equations xy5a and x 6 y5b into the pair
of linear equations x6y5b and x7y5pb2 74a; the values of x and y are
found through an addition and a subtraction. A Yale cuneiform tablet,
for example, asks for the solution of the system x1y56;30 and xy57;30.
The instructions of the scribe are essentially as follows. First
find</p>
<p>x1y</p>
<p>53;15 2</p>
<p>and then find x1y 2</p>
<p>510;33;45:</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>and x1y 2</p>
<p>2xy53;3;45</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>x1y 2</p>
<p>2xy51;45:</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>1 53;1511;45</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>2 53;1521;45:</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>From the last two equations, it is obvious that x55 and y51. Because
the quantities x and y enter symmetrically in the given conditional
equations, it is possible to interpret the values of x and y as the two
roots of the quadratic equation x2 17;3056;30x. Another Babylonian text
calls for a number that when added to its reciprocal becomes
2;0,0,33,20. This leads to a quadratic of type 3, and again we have two
solutions, 1;0,45 and 0;59,15,33,20.</p>
<p>Cubic Equations</p>
<p>The Babylonian reduction of a quadratic equation of the form ax2
1bx5c to the normal form y2 1by5ac through the substitution y5ax shows
the extraordinary degree of flexibility in Mesopotamian algebra. There
is no record in Egypt of the solution of a cubic equation, but among the
Babylonians there are many instances of this.</p>
<p>Me a sur e ment s: P y t ha gor e an Tr ia d s</p>
<p>Pure cubics, such as x3 50;7,30, were solved by direct reference to
tables of cubes and cube roots, where the solution x50;30 was read off.
Linear interpolation within the tables was used to find approximations
for values not listed in the tables. Mixed cubics in the standard form
x3 1x2 5a were solved similarly by reference to the available tables,
which listed values of the combination n3 1n2 for integral values of n
from 1 to 30. With the help of these tables, they easily read off that
the solution, for example, of x3 1x2 54,12 is equal to 6. For still more
general cases of equations of the third degree, such as 144x3 112x2 521,
the Babylonians used their method of substitution. Multiplying both
sides by 12 and using y512x, the equation becomes y3 1y2
54,12,fromwhichyisfoundtobeequalto6,hencexisjustor0;30. Cubics of the
form ax3 1bx2 5c are reducible to the Babylonian normal form by
multiplying through by a2 /b3 to obtain (ax/b)3 1(ax/b)2 5 ca2 /b3, a
cubic of standard type in the unknown quantity ax/b. Reading off from
the tables the value of this unknown quantity, the value of x is
determined. Whether the Babylonians were able to reduce the general
fourterm cubic, ax3 1bx2 1ex5d, to their normal form is not known. It is
not too unlikely that they could reduce it, as is indicated by the fact
that a solution of a quadratic suffices to carry the four-term equation
to the three-term form px3 1qx2 5r, from which, as we have seen, the
normal form is readily obtained. There is, however, no evidence now
available to suggest that the Mesopotamian mathematicians actually
carried out such a reduction of the general cubic equation.</p>
<p>With modern symbolism, it is a simple matter to see that (ax)3 1(ax)2
5b is essentially the same type of equation as y3 1y2 5b, but to
recognize this without our notation is an achievement of far greater
significance for the development of mathematics than even the vaunted
positional principle in arithmetic that we owe to the same civilization.
Babylonian algebra had reached such an extraordinary level of
abstraction that the equations ax4 1bx2 5c and ax8 1bx4 5c were
recognized as nothing worse than quadratic equations in disguise—that
is, quadratics in x2 and x4.</p>
<p>Measurements: Pythagorean Triads</p>
<p>The algebraic achievements of the Babylonians are admirable, but the
motives behind this work are not easy to understand. It has commonly
been supposed that virtually all pre-Hellenic science and mathematics
were purely utilitarian, but what sort of real-life situation in ancient
Babylon could possibly lead to problems involving the sum of a number
and its reciprocal or a difference between an area and a length? If
utility was the motive, then the cult of immediacy was less strong than
it is now, for direct connections between purpose and practice in
Babylonian mathematics are far from apparent. That there may well have
been toleration for, if not

the Plimpton Collection at Columbia University. The tablet dates from
the Old Babylonian period (ca. 1900 1600 BCE), and the tabulations it
contains could easily be interpreted as a record of business accounts.
Analysis,however,showsthatithasdeepmathematicalsignificanceinthetheory
of numbers and that it was perhaps related to a kind of
proto-trigonometry. Plimpton 322 was part of a larger tablet, as is
illustrated by the break along the left-hand edge, and the remaining
portion contains four columns of
numbersarrangedinfifteenhorizontalrows.Theright-handcolumncontains the
digits from 1 to 15, and, evidently, its purpose was simply to identify
in order the items in the other three columns, arranged as follows:</p>
<p>1,59,0,15 1,59 2,49 1</p>

<p>1,23,13,46,40 56 1,46 15</p>
<p>The tablet is not in such excellent condition that all of the numbers
can still be read, but the clearly discernible pattern of construction
in the table made it possible to determine from the context the few
items that were missing because of small fractures. To understand what
the entries in the table probably meant to the Babylonians, consider the
right triangle ABC (Fig. 3.1). If the numbers in the second and third
columns (from left to right) are thought of as the sides a and c,
respectively, of the right triangle, then the first, or left-hand,
column contains in each case the square of the ratio of c to b. The
left-hand column, therefore, is a short table of values of sec2 A, but
we must not assume that the Babylonians were familiar with our secant
concept. Neither the Egyptians nor the Babylonians introduced a measure
of angles in the modern sense. Nevertheless, the rows of numbers in
Plimpton 322 are not arranged in haphazard fashion, as a superficial
glance might imply. If the first comma in column one (on the left) is
replaced by a semicolon, it is obvious that the numbers in this column
decrease steadily from top to bottom. Moreover, the first number is
quite close to sec2 45, and the last number in the column is
approximately sec2 31, with the intervening numbers close to</p>
<p>Me a sur e ment s: P y t ha gor e an Tr ia d s</p>
<p>the values of sec2 A as A decreases by degrees from 45 to 31. This
arrangement obviously is not the result of chance alone. Not only was
the arrangement carefully thought out, but the dimensions of the
triangle were also derived according to a rule. Those who constructed
the table evidently began with two regular sexagesimal integers, which
we shall call p and q, with p.q, and then formed the triple of numbers
p2 2q2 and 2pq and p2 1q2. The three integers thus obtained are easily
seen to form a Pythagorean triple, in which the square of the largest is
equal to the sum of the squares of the other two. Hence, these numbers
can be used as the dimensions of the right triangle ABC, with a5p2 2q2
and b52pq and c5p2 1q2. Restricting themselves to values of p less than
60 and to corresponding values of q such that 1, p=q,11p2, that is, to
right triangles for which a,b, the Babylonians presumably found that
there were just 38 possible pairs of values of p and q satisfying the
conditions, and for these they apparently formed the 38 corresponding
Pythagorean triples. Only the first 15, arranged in descending order for
the ratio (p2 1q2)/2pq, are included in the table on the tablet, but it
is likely that the scribe had intended to continue the table on the
other side of the tablet. It has also been suggested that the portion of
Plimpton 322 that has broken off from the left side contained four
additional columns, in which were tabulated the values of p and q and
2pq and what we should now call tan2 A.</p>
<p>The Plimpton Tablet 322 might give the impression that it is an
exercise in the theory of numbers, but it is likely that this aspect of
the subject was merely ancillary to the problem of measuring the areas
of squares on the sides of a right triangle. The Babylonians disliked
working with the reciprocals of irregular numbers, for these could not
be expressed exactly in finite sexagesimal fractions. Hence, they were
interested in values of p and q that should give them regular integers
for the sides of right triangles of varying shapes, from the isosceles
right</p>
<p>triangle down to one with a small value for the ratio a/b. For
example, the numbers in the first row are found by starting with p512
and q55, with the corresponding values a5119 and b5120 and c5169. The
values of a and c are precisely those in the second and third positions
from the left in the first row on the Plimpton tablet; the ratio c2 /b2
528561/14400 is the number 1;59,0,15 that appears in the first position
in this row. The same relationship is found in the other fourteen rows;
the Babylonians carried out the work so accurately that the ratio c2/b2
in the tenth row is expressed as a fraction with eight sexagesimal
places, equivalent to about fourteen decimal places in our notation.</p>
<p>So much of Babylonian mathematics is bound up with tables of
reciprocals that it is not surprising to find that the items in Plimpton
322 are related to reciprocal relationships. If a51, then 15(c1b)(c2b),
so that c1b and c2b are reciprocals. If one starts with c1b5n, where n
is any regular sexagesimal, then c2b5l/n; hence, a51 and b5ðn21=nÞ and
c5ðn11=nÞ are a Pythagorean fraction triple, which can easily be
converted to a Pythagorean integer triple by multiplying each of the
three by 2n. All triples in the Plimpton tablet are easily calculated by
this device.</p>
<p>The account of Babylonian algebra that we have given is
representative of their work, but it is not intended to be exhaustive.
There are in the Babylonian tablets many other things, although none so
striking as those</p>
<p>Pol y gonal Ar e a s</p>
<p>in the Plimpton Tablet 322; as in this case, many are still open to
multiple interpretations. For instance, in one tablet the geometric
progression 112122 1?129 is summed, and in another the sum of the series
of squares 12 122 132 1?1102 is found. One wonders whether the
Babylonians knew the general formulas for the sum of a geometric
progression and the sum of the first n perfect squares. It is quite
possible that they did, and it has been conjectured that they were aware
that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is equal to the square of the
sum of the first n integers. Nevertheless, it must be borne in mind that
tablets from Mesopotamia resemble Egyptian papyri in that only specific
cases are given, with no general formulations.</p>
<h4 id="polygonal-areas">Polygonal Areas</h4>
<p>It used to be held that the Babylonians were better in algebra than
were the Egyptians, but that they had contributed less to geometry. The
first half of this statement is clearly substantiated by what we have
learned in previous paragraphs; attempts to bolster the second half of
the comparison generally are limited to the measure of the circle or to
the volume of the frustum of a pyramid. In the Mesopotamian Valley, the
area of a circle was generally found by taking three times the square of
the radius, and in accuracy this falls considerably below the Egyptian
measure. Yet the counting of decimal places in the approximations for π
is scarcely an appropriate measure of the geometric stature of a
civilization, and a twentieth-century discovery has effectively
nullified even this weak argument.</p>
<p>In 1936, a group of mathematical tablets was unearthed at Susa, a
couple of hundred miles from Babylon, and these include significant
geometric results. True to the Mesopotamian penchant for making tables
and lists, one tablet in the Susa group compares the areas and the
squares of the sides of the regular polygons of three, four, five, six,
and seven sides. The ratio of the area of the pentagon, for example, to
the square on the side of the pentagon is given as 1;40, a value that is
correct to two significant figures. For the hexagon and the heptagon,
the ratios are expressed as 2;37,30 and 3;41, respectively. In the same
tablet, the scribe gives 0;57,36 as the ratio of the perimeter of the
regular hexagon to the circumference of the circumscribed circle, and
from this, we can readily conclude that the Babylonian scribe had
adopted 3;7,30, or 3, as an approximation for π. This is at least as
good as the value adopted in Egypt. Moreover, we see it in a more
sophisticated context than in Egypt, for the tablet from Susa is a good
example of the systematic comparison of geometric figures. One is almost
tempted to see in it the genuine origin of geometry, but it is important
to note that it was not so much the geometric context that interested
the Babylonians as the numerical approximations that they used in
mensuration. Geometry for</p>
<p>them was not a mathematical discipline in our sense, but a sort of
applied algebra or arithmetic in which numbers are attached to
figures.</p>
<p>There is some disagreement as to whether the Babylonians were
familiar with the concept of similar figures, although this appears to
be likely. The similarity of all circles seems to have been taken for
granted in Mesopotamia, as it had been in Egypt, and the many problems
on triangle measure in cuneiform tablets seem to imply a concept of
similarity. A tablet in the Baghdad Museum has a right triangle ABC
(Fig. 3.2) with sides a560 and b545 and c575, and it is subdivided into
four smaller right triangles, ACD, CDE, DEF, and EFB. The areas of these
four triangles are then given as 8,6 and 5,11;2,24 and 3,19;3,56,9,36
and 5,53;53,39,50,24, respectively. From these values, the scribe
computed the length of AD as 27, apparently using a sort of “similarity
formula” equivalent to our theorem that areas of similar figures are to
each other as squares on corresponding sides. The lengths of CD and BD
are found to be 36 and 48, respectively, and through an application of
the “similarity formula” to triangles BCD and DCE, the length of CE is
found to be 21;36. The text breaks off in the middle of the calculation
of DE.</p>
<h4 id="geometry-as-applied-arithmetic">Geometry as Applied
Arithmetic</h4>
<p>Measurement was the keynote of algebraic geometry in the Mesopotamian
Valley, but a major flaw, as in Egyptian geometry, was that the
distinction between exact and approximate measures was not made clear.
The area of a quadrilateral was found by taking the product of the
arithmetic means of the pairs of opposite sides, with no warning that
this is in most cases only a crude approximation. Again, the volume of a
frustum of a cone or a pyramid was sometimes found by taking the
arithmetic mean of the upper and lower bases and multiplying by the
height; sometimes, for a frustum of a square pyramid with areas a2 and
b2 for the lower and upper bases, the formula</p>
<p>a1b 2</p>
<p>V 5 h</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Ge ome tr y a s A pplie d Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>was applied. For the latter, however, the Babylonians also used a
rule equivalent to</p>
<p>a1b 2 1 a2b 2</p>
<p>V 5h 1 ;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>a formula that is correct and reduces to the one used by the
Egyptians.</p>
<p>It is not known whether Egyptian and Babylonian results were always
independently discovered, but in any case, the latter were definitely
more extensive than the former, in both geometry and algebra. The
Pythagorean theorem, for example, does not appear in any form in
surviving documents from Egypt, but tablets even from the Old Babylonian
period show that in Mesopotamia the theorem was widely used. A cuneiform
text from the Yale Collection, for example, contains a diagram of a
square and its diagonals in which the number 30 is written along one
side and the numbers 42;25,35 and 1;24,51,10 appear along a diagonal.
The last number obviously is the ratio of the lengths of the diagonal
and ap side, and this is so accurately expressed that it agrees with 2
to within about a millionth. The accuracy of the result was made
possible by knowledge of the Pythagorean theorem. Sometimes, in less
precise computations, the Babylonians used 1;25 as a rough-and-ready
approximation to this ratio. Of more significance than the precision of
the values, however, is the implication that the diagonal of any square
could be foundp by multiplying the side by 2. Thus, there seems to have
been some awareness of general principles, despite the fact that these
are exclusively expressed in special cases.</p>
<p>Babylonian recognition of the Pythagorean theorem was by no means
limited to the case of a right isosceles triangle. In one Old Babylonian
problem text, a ladder or a beam of length 0;30 stands against a wall;
the question is, how far will the lower end move out from the wall if
the upper end slips down a distance of 0;6 units? The answer is
correctly found by use of the Pythagorean theorem. Fifteen hundred years
later, similar problems, some with new twists, were still being solved
in the Mesopotamian Valley. A Seleucid tablet, for example, proposes the
following problem. A reed stands against a wall. If the top slides down
3 units when the lower end slides away 9 units, how long is the reed?
The answer is given correctly as 15 units.</p>
<p>Ancient cuneiform problem texts provide a wealth of exercises in what
we might call geometry, but which the Babylonians probably thought of as
applied arithmetic. A typical inheritance problem calls for the
partition of a right-triangular property among six brothers. The area is
given as 11,22,30 and one of the sides is 6,30; the dividing lines are
to be equidistant and parallel to the other side of the triangle. One is
asked to find the difference in the allotments. Another text gives the
bases of an isosceles trapezoid as 50 and 40 units and the length of the
sides as 30; the altitude and the area are required (van der Waerden
1963, pp. 76 77).</p>
<p>The ancient Babylonians were aware of other important geometric
relationships. Like the Egyptians, they knew that the altitude in an
isosceles triangle bisects the base. Hence, given the length of a chord
in a circle of known radius, they were able to find the apothem. Unlike
the Egyptians, they were familiar with the fact that an angle inscribed
in a semicircle is a right angle, a proposition generally known as the
Theorem of Thales, despite the fact that Thales lived more than a
millennium after the Babylonians had begun to use it. This misnaming of
a well-known theorem in geometry is symptomatic of the difficulty in
assessing the influence of pre-Hellenic mathematics on later cultures.
Cuneiform tablets had a permanence that could not be matched by
documents from other civilizations, for papyrus and parchment do not so
easily survive the ravages of time. Moreover, cuneiform texts continued
to be recorded down to the dawn of the Christian era, but were they read
by neighboring civilizations, especially the Greeks? The center of
mathematical development was shifting from the Mesopotamian Valley to
the Greek world half a dozen centuries before the beginning of our era,
but reconstructions of early Greek mathematics are rendered hazardous by
the fact that there are virtually no extant mathematical documents from
the pre-Hellenistic period. It is important, therefore, to keep in mind
the general characteristics of Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics so as
to be able to make at least plausible conjectures concerning analogies
that may be apparent between pre-Hellenic contributions and the
activities and attitudes of later peoples.</p>
<p>There is a lack of explicit statements of rules and of clear-cut
distinctions between exact and approximate results. The omission in the
tables of cases involving irregular sexagesimals seems to imply some
recognition of such distinctions, but neither the Egyptians nor the
Babylonians appear to have raised the question of when the area of a
quadrilateral (or of a circle) is found exactly and when only
approximately. Questions about the solvability or unsolvability of a
problem do not seem to have been raised, nor was there any investigation
into the nature of proof. The word “proof” means various things at
different levels and ages; hence, it is hazardous to assert
categorically that pre-Hellenic peoples had no concept of proof, nor any
feeling of the need for proof. There are hints that these people were
occasionally aware that certain area and volume methods could be
justified through a reduction to simpler area and volume problems.
Moreover, pre-Hellenic scribes not infrequently checked or “proved”
their divisions by multiplication; occasionally, they verified the
procedure in a problem through a substitution that verified the
correctness of the answer. Nevertheless, there are no explicit
statements from the pre-Hellenic period that would indicate a felt need
for proofs or a concern for questions of logical principles. In
Mesopotamian problems, the words “length” and “width”</p>
<p>Ge ome tr y a s A pplie d Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>should perhaps be interpreted much as we interpret the letters x and
y, for the writers of cuneiform tablets may well have moved on from
specific instances to general abstractions. How else does one explain
the addition of a length to an area? In Egypt also, the use of the word
for quantity is not incompatible with an abstract interpretation such as
we read into it today. In addition, there were in Egypt and Babylonia
problems that have the earmarks of recreational mathematics. If a
problem calls for a sum of cats and measures of grain, or of a length
and an area, one cannot deny to the perpetrator either a modicum of
levity or a feeling for abstraction. Of course, much of pre-Hellenic
mathematics was practical, but surely not all of it. In the practice of
computation, which stretched over a couple of millennia, the schools of
scribes used plenty of exercise material, often, perhaps, simply as good
clean fun.</p>

<h4 id="the-era-and-the-sources-2">The Era and the Sources</h4>
<p>The intellectual activity of the river valley civilizations in Egypt
and Mesopotamia had lost its verve well before the Christian era, but as
learning in the river valleys declined, and as bronze gave way to iron
in weaponry, vigorous new cultures sprang up all along the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea. To indicate this change in the centers of
civilization, the interval from roughly 800 BCE to 800 CE is sometimes
known as the Thalassic Age (that is, the “sea” age). There was no sharp
disruption to mark the transition in intellectual leadership from the
valleys of the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates rivers to the shores of the
Mediterranean. Egyptian and Babylonian scholars continued to produce
papyrus and cuneiform texts for many centuries after 800 BCE, but a new
civilization meanwhile was rapidly preparing to take over scholarly
hegemony, not only around the Mediterranean but, ultimately, in the
chief river valleys as well. To</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>The Era and t he S ource s</p>
<p>indicate the source of the new inspiration, the first portion of the
Thalassic Age is labeled the Hellenic era, so that the older cultures
are consequently known as pre-Hellenic. The Greeks of today still call
themselves Hellenes. Greek history is traceable back into the second
millennium BCE, when several waves of invaders pressed down from the
north. They brought with them no known mathematical or literary
tradition. They seem to have been very eager to learn, however, and it
did not take them long to improve on what they absorbed. It is presumed
that some rudiments of computation traveled along trade routes. This is
true of the early Greek alphabets that had been taken over and expanded
from the existing alphabet of the Phoenicians, which consisted only of
consonants. The alphabet seems to have originated between the Babylonian
and Egyptian worlds, possibly in the region of the Sinai Peninsula,
through a process of drastic reduction in the number of cuneiform or
hieratic symbols. This alphabet found its way to the new colonies—
Greek, Roman, and Carthaginian—through the activities of traders. Before
long, Greek traders, businessmen, and scholars made their way to the
centers of learning in Egypt and Babylonia. There they made contact with
pre-Hellenic mathematics, but they were not willing merely to receive
long-established traditions, for they made the subject so thoroughly
their own that it soon took a drastically different form.</p>
<p>The first Olympic Games were held in 776 BCE, and by then, an
absorbing Greek literature had already developed. Of Greek mathematics
at the time we know nothing. Presumably, it lagged behind the
development of literary forms; the latter lend themselves more readily
to continuity of oral transmission. It would be almost another two
centuries before there was any word, even indirectly, concerning Greek
mathematics.Then,duringthesixthcenturyBCE,thereappearedtwomen,Thales and
Pythagoras, to whom are ascribed definite mathematical discoveries. They
are somewhat indistinct figures, historically. No mathematical
masterpiece from either one has survived, nor is it even established
that either Thales or Pythagoras ever composed such a work.
Nevertheless, the earliest Greek accounts of the history of mathematics,
which no longer survive, ascribed to Thales and Pythagoras a number of
very definite discoveries in mathematics. We outline these
contributionsin this chapter,
butthereadershouldunderstandthatitislargelypersistenttradition,rather
than any extant historical document, on which the account is based.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this situation prevails regarding any written
mathematical treatises or other works throughout the fifth century BCE.
There are virtually no extant mathematical or scientific documents until
we encounter those from the days of Plato in the fourth century BCE.
Nevertheless, during the last half of the fifth century, there
circulated persistent and consistent reports concerning a handful of
mathematicians who evidently were intensely concerned with problems that
formed the basis for most of the later developments in geometry. We
shall therefore refer to this period as the “Heroic Age of Mathematics,”
for seldom, either before or since, have men with so little to work with
tackled mathematical problems of such fundamental significance. No
longer was mathematical activity centered almost entirely in two regions
nearly at opposite ends of the Greek world; it flourished all around the
Mediterranean. In what is now southern Italy, there were Archytas of
Tarentum (born ca. 428 BCE) and Hippasus of Metapontum (fl. ca. 400
BCE); at Abdera in Thrace, we find Democritus (born ca. 460 BCE); nearer
the center of the Greek world, on the Attic peninsula, there was Hippias
of Elis (born ca. 460 BCE); and in nearby Athens, there lived at various
times during the pivotal last half of the fifth century BCE three
scholars from other regions: Hippocrates of Chios (fl. ca. 430 BCE),
Anaxagoras of Clazomenae (fl. 428 BCE), and Zeno of Elea (fl. ca. 450
BCE). Through the work of these seven men, we shall describe the
fundamental changes in mathematics that took place a little before the
year 400 BCE. Again, we must remember that although the histories of
Herodotus and Thucydides and the plays of Aeschylus, Euripides, and
Aristophanes have in some measure survived, scarcely a line is extant of
what was written by mathematicians of the time.</p>
<p>Firsthand mathematical sources from the fourth century BCE are almost
as scarce, but this inadequacy is made up for in large measure by
accounts written by philosophers who were au courant with the
mathematics of their day. We have most of what Plato wrote and about
half of the work of Aristotle; with the writings of these intellectual
leaders of the fourth century BCE as a guide, we can give a far more
dependable account of what happened in their day than we could about the
Heroic Age.</p>
<h4 id="thales-and-pythagoras">Thales and Pythagoras</h4>
<p>Accounts of the origins of Greek mathematics center on the so-called
Ionian and Pythagorean schools and the chief representative of each—
Thales and Pythagoras—although, as just noted, reconstructions of their
thought rest on fragmentary reports and traditions built up during later
centuries. The Greek world had its center between the Aegean and Ionian
seas for many centuries, but Hellenic civilization was far from
localized there. By about 600 BCE, Greek settlements were scattered
along the borders of most of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea,
and it was in these outskirts that a new surge in mathematics developed.
In this respect, the sea-bordering colonists, especially in Ionia, had
two advantages: they had the bold and imaginative spirit typical of
pioneers, and they were in closer proximity to the two chief river
valleys where knowledge thrived. Thales of Miletus (ca. 624 548 BCE) and
Pythagoras of Samos (ca. 580 500 BCE) had a further advantage: they were
in a position to travel to centers of ancient learning and there
acquire</p>
<p>firsthand information on astronomy and mathematics. In Egypt, they
are said to have learned geometry; in Babylon, under the enlightened
Chaldean ruler Nebuchadnezzar, Thales may have come in touch with
astronomical tables and instruments. Tradition has it that in 585 BCE,
Thales amazed his countrymen by predicting the solar eclipse of that
year. The historicity of this tradition is very much open to question,
however.</p>
<p>What is really known about the life and work of Thales is very little
indeed. Ancient opinion is unanimous in regarding Thales as an unusually
clever man and the first philosopher—by general agreement, the first of
the Seven Wise Men. He was regarded as “a pupil of the Egyptians and the
Chaldeans,” an assumption that appears plausible. The proposition now
known as the theorem of Thales—that an angle inscribed in a semicircle
is a right angle—may well have been learned by Thales during his travels
to Babylon. Tradition goes further, however, and attributes to him some
sort of demonstration of the theorem. For this reason, Thales has
frequently been hailed as the first true mathematician—as the originator
of the deductive organization of geometry. This report, or legend, was
embellished by adding to this theorem four others that Thales is said to
have proved:</p>
<p>1.A circle is bisected by a diameter.</p>
<p>2.The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal.</p>
<p>3.The pairs of vertical angles formed by two intersecting lines
areequal.</p>
<p>4.If two triangles are such that two angles and a side of one are
equal,respectively, to two angles and a side of the other, then the
triangles are congruent.</p>
<p>There is no document from antiquity that can be pointed to as
evidence of this achievement, yet the tradition has been persistent.
About the nearest one can come to reliable evidence on this point is
derived from a source a thousand years after the time of Thales. A
student of Aristotle’s by the name of Eudemus of Rhodes (fl. ca. 320
BCE) wrote a history of mathematics. This has been lost, but before it
disappeared, someone had summarized at least part of the history. The
original of this summary has also been lost, but during the fifth
century of our era, information from the summary was incorporated by the
Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus (410 485) into the early pages of his
Commentary on the First Book of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>Designations of Thales as the first mathematician largely hinge on
the remarks of Proclus. Later in his Commentary, Proclus—again depending
on Eudemus—attributes to Thales the four theorems mentioned previously.
There are other scattered references to Thales in ancient sources, but
most of these describe his more practical activities. They do not
establish the bold conjecture that Thales created demonstrative
geometry, but in any case, Thales is the first man in history to whom
specific mathematical discoveries have been attributed.</p>
<p>That it was the Greeks who added the element of logical structure to
geometry is virtually universally admitted today, but the big question
remains whether this crucial step was taken by Thales or by others
later—perhaps as much as two centuries later. On this point, we must
suspend final judgment until there is additional evidence on the
development of Greek mathematics.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is scarcely less controversial a figure than Thales, for
he has been more thoroughly enmeshed in legend and apotheosis. Thales
had been a man of practical affairs, but Pythagoras was a prophet and a
mystic, born at Samos, one of the Dodecanese islands not far from
Miletus, the birthplace of Thales. Although some accounts picture
Pythagoras as having studied under Thales, this is rendered unlikely by
the half-century difference in their ages. Some similarity in their
interests can readily be accounted for by the fact that Pythagoras also
traveled to Egypt and Babylon—possibly even to India. During his
peregrinations, he evidently absorbed not only mathematical and
astronomical information but also much religious lore. Pythagoras was,
incidentally, virtually a contemporary of Buddha, Confucius, and Laozi
(Lao-tzu); the century was a crucial time in the development of
religion, as well as of mathematics. When Pythagoras returned to the
Greek world, he settled at Croton on the southeastern coast of what is
now Italy, but at that time was known as Magna Graecia. There he
established a secret society that somewhat resembled an Orphic cult,
except for its mathematical and philosophical basis.</p>
<p>That Pythagoras remains a very obscure figure is due in part to the
loss of documents from that age. Several biographies of Pythagoras were
written in antiquity, including one by Aristotle, but these have not
survived. A further difficulty in clearly identifying the figure of
Pythagoras lies in the fact that the order he established was communal
as well as secret. Knowledge and property were held in common, hence
attribution of discoveries was not to be made to a specific member of
the school. It is best, consequently, not to speak of the work of
Pythagoras, but rather of the contributions of the Pythagoreans,
although in antiquity it was customary to give all credit to the
master.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the Pythagorean order was
the confidence it maintained in the pursuit of philosophical and
mathematical studies as a moral basis for the conduct of life. The very
words “philosophy” (or “love of wisdom”) and “mathematics” (or “that
which is learned”) are supposed to have been coined by Pythagoras
himself to describe his intellectual activities.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Pythagoreans played an important role in the
history of mathematics. In Egypt and Mesopotamia, the elements of
arithmetic and geometry were primarily exercises in the application of
numerical procedures to specific problems, whether concerned with beer
or pyramids or the inheritance of land; we find nothing resembling a
philosophical discussion of principles. Thales is generally regarded as
having made a beginning in this direction, although tradition supports
the view of Eudemus and Proclus that the new emphasis in mathematics was
due primarily to the Pythagoreans. With them, mathematics was more
closely related to a love of wisdom than to the exigencies of practical
life. That Pythagoras was one of the most influential figures in history
is difficult to deny, for his followers, whether deluded or inspired,
spread their beliefs throughout most of the Greek world. The harmonies
and mysteries of philosophy and mathematics were essential parts of the
Pythagorean rituals. Never before or since has mathematics played so
large a role in life and religion as it did among the Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>The motto of the Pythagorean school is said to have been “All is
number.” Recalling that the Babylonians had attached numerical measures
to things around them, from the motions of the heavens to the values of
their slaves, we may perceive in the Pythagorean motto a strong
Mesopotamian affinity. The very theorem to which the name of Pythagoras
still clings quite likely was derived from the Babylonians. It has been
suggested, as justification for calling it the Theorem of Pythagoras,
that the Pythagoreans first provided a demonstration, but this
conjecture cannot be verified. It is reasonable to assume that the
earliest members of the Pythagorean school were familiar with geometric
properties known to the Babylonians, but when the Eudemus-Proclus
summary ascribes to them the construction of the “cosmic figures” (that
is, the regular solids), there is room for doubt. The cube, the
octahedron, and the dodecahedron could perhaps have been observed in
crystals, such as those of pyrite (iron disulfide), but a scholium in
Euclid’s Elements XIII reports that the Pythagoreans knew only three of
the regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, the cube, and the dodecahedron.
Familiarity with the last figure is rendered plausible by the discovery
near Padua of an Etruscan dodecahedron of stone dating from before 500
BCE. It is not improbable, therefore, that even if the Pythagoreans did
not know of the octahedron and the icosahedron, they knew of some of the
properties of the regular pentagon. The figure of a five-pointed star
(which is formed by drawing the five diagonals of a pentagonal face of a
regular dodecahedron) is said to have been the special symbol of the
Pythagorean school. The star pentagon had appeared earlier in Babylonian
art, and it is possible that here, too, we find a connecting link
between pre-Hellenic and Pythagorean mathematics.</p>
<p>One of the tantalizing questions in Pythagorean geometry concerns the
construction of a pentagram or a star pentagon. If we begin with a
regular polygon ABCDE (Fig. 4.1) and draw the five diagonals, these
diagonals intersect in points AuBuCuDuEu, which form another regular
pentagon.</p>
<p>Noting that the triangle BCDu, for example, is similar to the
isosceles triangle BCE, and noting also the many pairs of congruent
triangles in the diagram, it is not difficult to see that the diagonal
points AuBuCuDuEu divide the diagonals in a striking manner. In each
case, a diagonal point divides a diagonal into two unequal segments such
that the ratio of the whole diagonal is to the larger segment as this
segment is to the smaller segment. This subdivision of a diagonal is the
well-known “golden section” of a line segment, but this name was not
used until a couple of thousand years later—just about the time when
Johannes Kepler wrote lyrically:</p>
<p>Geometry has two great treasures: one is the Theorem of Pythagoras;
the other, the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio. The first
we may compare to a measure of gold; the second we may name a precious
jewel.</p>
<p>To the ancient Greeks, this type of subdivision soon became so
familiar that no need was felt for a special descriptive name; hence,
the longer designation “the division of a segment in mean and extreme
ratio” generally was replaced by the simple words “the section.”</p>
<p>One important property of “the section” is that it is, so to speak,
selfpropagating. If a point P1 divides a segment RS (Fig. 4.2) in mean
and extreme ratio, with RP1 the longer segment, and if on this larger
segment we mark off a point P2 such that RP2 5P1S, then segment RP1 will
in turn be subdivided in mean and extreme ratio at point P2. Again, on
marking off on RP2 point P3 such that RP3 5P2P1, segment RP2 will be
divided in mean and extreme ratio at P3. This iterative procedure can be
carried out as many times as desired, the result being an ever smaller
segment RPn divided in mean and extreme ratio by point Pn11. Whether the
earlier Pythagoreans noticed this</p>
<p>R P3 P2 P1 S</p>
<p>FIG. 4.2</p>
<p>unending process or drew significant conclusions from it is not
known. Even the more fundamental question of whether the Pythagoreans of
about 500 BCE could divide a given segment into mean and extreme ratio
cannot be answered with certainty, although the probability that they
could and did seems to be high. The construction required is equivalent
to the solution of a quadratic equation. To show this, let RS5a and RP1
5x in Fig. 4.2. Then, by the property of the golden section,
a:x5x:(a2x), and on multiplying means and extremes we have the equation
x2 5a2 2ax. This is a quadratic equation of type 1, as described in
chapter 3, and Pythagoras could have learned from the Babylonians how to
solve this equation algebraically. If a is a rational number, however,
then there is no rational number x satisfying the equation. Did
Pythagoras realize this? It seems unlikely. Perhaps instead of the
Babylonian algebraic type of solution, the Pythagoreans may have adopted
a geometric procedure similar to that found in Euclid’s Elements II.11
and VI.30. To divide a line segment AB in mean and extreme ratio, Euclid
first constructed on the segment AB the square ABCD (Fig. 4.3). Then, he
bisected AC at point E, drew line segment EB, and extended line CEA to F
so that EF5EB. When the square AFGH is completed, point H will be the
point desired, for one can readily show that AB:AH5AH:HB. Knowing what
solution, if any, the earlier Pythagoreans used for the golden section
would go far toward clarifying the problem of the level and the
characteristics of pre-Socratic mathematics. If Pythagorean mathematics
began under a Babylonian aegis, with strong faith that all is number,
how (and when) did it happen that this gave way to the familiar emphasis
on pure geometry that is so firmly enshrined in the classical
treatises?</p>
<p>Number Mysticism</p>
<p>Number mysticism was not original with the Pythagoreans. The number
7, for example, had been singled out for special awe, presumably on
account of the seven wandering stars or planets from which the week
(hence our names for the days of the week) is derived. The Pythagoreans
were not the only people who fancied that the odd numbers had male
attributes and the even female—with the related (and not unprejudiced)
assumption, found as late as Shakespeare, that “there is divinity in odd
numbers.” Many early civilizations shared various aspects of numerology,
but the Pythagoreans carried number worship to its extreme, basing their
philosophy and their way of life on it. The number 1, they argued, is
the generator of numbers and the number of reason; the number 2 is the
first even or female number, the number of opinion; 3 is the first true
male number, the number of harmony, being composed of unity and
diversity; 4 is the number of justice or retribution, indicating the
squaring of accounts; 5 is the number of marriage, the union of the
first true male and female numbers; and 6 is the number of creation.
Each number in turn had its peculiar attributes. The holiest of all was
the number 10, or the tetractys, for it represented the number of the
universe, including the sum of all of the possible geometric dimensions.
A single point is the generator of dimensions, two points determine a
line of dimension one, three points (not on a line) determine a triangle
with area of dimension two, and four points (not in a plane) determine a
tetrahedron with volume of dimension three; the sum of the numbers
representing all dimensions, therefore, is the reversed number 10. It is
a tribute to the abstraction of Pythagorean mathematics that the
veneration of the number 10 evidently was not dictated by the anatomy of
the human hand or foot.</p>
<p>Arithmetic and Cosmology</p>
<p>In Mesopotamia, geometry had been not much more than number applied
to spatial extension; it appears that, at first, it may have been much
the same among the Pythagoreans—but with a modification. Number in Egypt
had been the domain of the natural numbers and the unit fractions; among
the Babylonians, it had been the field of all rational fractions. In
Greece, the word “number” was used only for the integers. A fraction was
not looked on as a single entity but as a ratio or relationship between
two whole numbers. (Greek mathematics, in its earlier stages, frequently
came closer to the “modern” mathematics of today than to the ordinary
arithmetic of a generation ago.) As Euclid later expressed it (Elements
V.3), “A ratio is a kind of relation in respect of size of two
magnitudes of the same kind.” Such a view, focusing attention on the
connection between pairs of numbers, tends to sharpen the theoretical or
rational aspects of the number concept and to deemphasize the role of
number as a tool in computation or approximation in mensuration.
Arithmetic now could be thought of as an intellectual discipline as well
as a technique, and a transition to such an outlook seems to have been
nurtured in the Pythagorean school.</p>
<p>If tradition is to be trusted, the Pythagoreans not only established
arithmeticasabranchofphilosophy;theyseemtohavemadeitthebasisof a
unification of all aspects of the world around them. Through patterns of
points, or unextended units, they associated number with geometric
extension; this in turn led them to an arithmetic of the heavens.
Philolaus (died ca. 390 BCE), a later Pythagorean who shared the
veneration of the
tetractysordecad,wrotethatitwas“great,all-powerfulandall-producing, the
beginning and the guide of the divine as of the terrestrial life.” This
view of the number 10 as the perfect number, the symbol of health and
harmony, seems to have provided the inspiration for the earliest
nongeocentric astronomical system. Philolaus postulated that at the
center of the universe, there was a central fire about which the earth
and the seven planets (including the sun and the moon) revolved
uniformly. Inasmuch as this brought to only nine the number of heavenly
bodies (other than the
sphereoffixedstars),thePhilolaicsystemassumedtheexistenceofatenth body—a
“counterearth” collinear with the earth and the central fire— having the
same period as the earth in its daily revolution about the central fire.
The sun revolved about the fire once a year, and the fixed stars were
stationary. The earth in its motion maintained the same uninhabited face
toward the central fire, hence neither the fire nor the counterearth was
ever seen. The postulate of uniform circular motion that the
Pythagoreans adopted was to dominate astronomical thought for more than
2,000 years. Copernicus, almost 2,000 years later, accepted this
assumption without question, and it was the Pythagoreans to whom
Copernicus referred to show that his doctrine of a moving earth was not
so new or revolutionary.</p>

thoughtiswellillustratedbytheirconcernforfiguratenumbers.Althoughno
triangle can be formed by fewer than three points, it is possible to
have triangles of a larger number of points, such as six, ten, or
fifteen (see Fig. 4.4).</p>

<p>were called triangular, and the triangular pattern for the number 10,
the holy tetractys, vied with the pentagon for veneration in Pythagorean
number theory. There were, of course, indefinitely many other categories
of privileged numbers. Successive square numbers are formed from the
sequence 11315171?1(2n21), where each odd number in turn was looked on
as a pattern of dots resembling a gnomon (the Babylonian shadow clock)
placed around two sides of the preceding square pattern of dots (see
Fig. 4.4). Hence, the word “gnomon” (related to the word for “knowing”)
came to be attached to the odd numbers themselves.</p>
<p>The sequence of even numbers, 214161?12n5n(n11), produces what the
Greeks called “oblong numbers,” each of which is double a triangular
number. Pentagonal patterns of points illustrated the pentagonal numbers

<p>In a similar manner, polygonal numbers of all orders are designated;
the process, of course, is easily extended to three-dimensional space,
where one deals with polyhedral numbers. Emboldened by such views,
Philolaus is reported to have maintained that</p>
<p>All things which can be known have number; for it is not possible
that without number anything can be either conceived or known.</p>
<p>The dictum of Philolaus seems to have been a tenet of the Pythagorean
school; hence, stories arose about the discovery by Pythagoras of some
simple laws of music. Pythagoras is reputed to have noticed that when
the lengths of vibrating strings are expressible as ratios of simple
whole numbers, such as 2 to 3 (for the fifth) or as 3 to 4 (for the
fourth), the tones will be harmonious. If, in other words, a string
sounds the note C when plucked, then a similar string twice as long will
sound the note C an octave below, and tones between these two notes are
emitted by strings whose lengths are given by intermediate ratios: 16:9
for D, 8:5 for E, 3:2 for F, 4:3 for G, 6:5 for A, and 16:15 for B, in
ascending order. Here we have perhaps the earliest quantitative laws of
acoustics—possibly the oldest of all quantitative physical laws. So
boldly imaginative were the early Pythagoreans that they hastily
extrapolated to conclude that the heavenly bodies in their motions
similarly emitted harmonious tones, the “harmony of the spheres.”
Pythagorean science, like Pythagorean mathematics, seems to have been an
odd congeries of sober thought and fanciful speculation. The doctrine of
a spherical earth is often ascribed to Pythagoras, but it is not known
whether this conclusion was based on observation (perhaps of new
constellations as Pythagoras traveled southward) or on imagination. The
very idea that the universe is a “cosmos,” or a harmoniously ordered
whole, seems to be a related Pythagorean contribution—one that at the
time had little basis in direct observation but that has been enormously
fruitful in the development of astronomy. As we smile at ancient number
fancies, we should at the same time be aware of the impulse these gave
to the development of both mathematics and science. The Pythagoreans
were among the earliest people to believe that the operations of nature
could be understood through mathematics.</p>
<p>Proportions</p>
<p>Proclus, quoting perhaps from Eudemus, ascribed to Pythagoras two
specific mathematical discoveries: (1) the construction of the regular
solids and (2) the theory of proportionals. Although there is question
about the extent to which this is to be taken literally, there is every
likelihood that the statement correctly reflects the direction of
Pythagorean thought. The theory of proportions clearly fits into the
pattern of early Greek mathematical interests, and it is not difficult
to find a likely source of inspiration. It is reported that Pythagoras
learned in Mesopotamia of three means—the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the subcontrary (later called the harmonic)—and of the “golden
proportion” relating two of these: the first of two numbers is to their
arithmetic mean as their harmonic mean is to the second of the numbers.
This relationship is the essence of the Babylonian square-root
algorithm; hence, the report is at least plausible. At some stage,
however, the Pythagoreans generalized this work by adding seven new
means to make ten in all. If b is the mean of a and c, where a,c, then
the three quantities are related according to one of the following ten
equations:</p>
<p>b2a a b2a c</p>
<p>ð1Þ 5 ð6Þ 5 c2b a c2b b b2a a c2a c</p>
<p>ð2Þ 5 ð7Þ 5 c2b b b2a a b2a a c2a c</p>

<p>b2a b c2a b</p>
<p>ð5Þ 5 ð10Þ 5 : c2b a c2b a
Thefirstthreeequationsare,ofcourse,theequationsforthearithmetic,the
geometric, and the harmonic means, respectively.</p>
<p>It is difficult to assign a date to the Pythagorean study of means,
and similar problems arise with respect to the classification of
numbers. The study of proportions or the equality of ratios presumably
formed at first a part of Pythagorean arithmetic or theory of numbers.
Later, the quantities a, b, and c entering in such proportions were more
likely to be regarded as geometric magnitudes, but the period in which
the change took place is not clear. In addition to the polygonal numbers
mentioned previously and the distinction between odd and even, the
Pythagoreans at some stage spoke of odd-odd and even-odd numbers, based
on whether the number in question was the product of two odd numbers or
of an odd and an even number, so that sometimes the name “even number”
was reserved for integral powers of two. By the time of Philolaus, the
distinction between prime and composite numbers seems to have become
important. Speusippus, a nephew of Plato and his successor as head of
the Academy, asserted that 10 was “perfect” for the Pythagoreans
because, among other things, it is the smallest integer n for which
there are just as
manyprimesbetween1andnasnonprimes.(Occasionally,primenumbers were called
linear, inasmuch as they are usually represented by dots in one
dimension only.) Neopythagoreans sometimes excluded 2 from the list of
primes on the ground that 1 and 2 are not true numbers, but the
generators of the odd and even numbers. The primacy of the odd numbers
was assumed to be established by the fact that odd1odd is even, whereas
even1even remains even.</p>
<p>To the Pythagoreans has been attributed the rule for Pythagorean
triads given by (m2 21)/2, m, (m2 11)/2, where m is an odd integer, but
inasmuch as this rule is so closely related to the Babylonian examples,
it is perhaps not an independent discovery. Also ascribed to the
Pythagoreans, with doubt as to the period in question, are the
definitions of perfect, abundant, and deficient numbers, based on
whether the sum of the proper divisors of the number is equal to,
greater than, or less than the number itself. According to this
definition, 6 is the smallest perfect number, with 28 next. That this
view was probably a later development in Pythagorean thought is
suggested by the early veneration of 10 rather than 6. Hence, the
related doctrine of “amicable” numbers is also likely to have been a
later notion. Two integers a and b are said to be “amicable” if a is the
sum of the proper divisors of b and if b is the sum of the proper
divisors of a. The smallest such pair are the integers 220 and 284.</p>
<h4 id="numeration">Numeration</h4>
<p>The Hellenes were celebrated as shrewd traders and businessmen, and
there must have been a lower level of arithmetic or computation that</p>
<p>Numerat ion</p>
<p>satisfied the needs of the vast majority of Greek citizens. Number
activities of this type would have been beneath the notice of
philosophers, and recorded accounts of practical arithmetic were
unlikely to find their way into the libraries of scholars. If, then,
there are not even fragments surviving of the more sophisticated
Pythagorean works, it is clear that it would be unreasonable to expect
manuals of trade mathematics to survive the ravages of time. Hence, it
is not possible to tell at this distance how the ordinary processes of
arithmetic were carried out in Greece 2,500 years ago. About the best
one can do is to describe the systems of numeration that appear to have
been in use.</p>
<p>In general, there seem to have been two chief systems of numeration
in Greece: one, probably the earlier, is known as the Attic (or
Herodianic) notation; the other is called the Ionian (or alphabetic)
system. Both systems are, for integers, based on the 10 scale, but the
former is the more primitive, being based on a simple iterative scheme
found in the earlier Egyptian hieroglyphic numeration and in the later
Roman numerals. In the Attic system, the numbers from 1 to 4 were
represented by repeated vertical strokes. For the number 5 a new
symbol—the first letter Π (or Γ) of the word for five, “pente”—was
adopted. (Only capital letters were used at the time, both in literary
works and in mathematics, lowercase letters being an invention of the
later ancient or early medieval period.) For numbers from 6 through 9,
the Attic system combined the symbol Γ with unit strokes, so that 8, for
example, was written as . For positive integral powers of the base (10),
the initial letters of the corresponding number words were adopted— for
deka (10), for hekaton (100), for khilioi (1,000), and for myrioi
(10,000). Except for the forms of the symbols, the Attic system is much
like the Roman, but it had one advantage. Where the Latin word adopted
distinctive symbols for 50 and 500, the Greeks wrote these numbers by
combining letters for 5, 10, and 100, using (or 5 times 10) for 50, and
(or 5 times 100) for 500. In the same way, they wrote for 5,000 andfor
50,000. In Attic script, the number 45,678, for example, would appear
as</p>
<p>The Attic system of notation (also known as Herodianic, inasmuch as
it was described in a fragment attributed to Herodian, a grammarian of
the second century) appears in inscriptions at various dates from 454 to
95 BCE, but by the early Alexandrian Age, at about the time of Ptolemy
Philadelphius, it was being displaced by the Ionian or alphabetic
numerals. Similar alphabetic schemes were used at one time or another by
various Semitic peoples, including the Hebrews, the Syrians, the
Aramaeans, and the Arabs—as well as by other cultures, such as the
Gothic—but these would seem to have been borrowed from the Greek
notation. The Ionian system probably was used as early as the fifth
century BCE and perhaps as early as the eighth century BCE. One reason
for placing the origin of the notation relatively early is that the
scheme called for twenty-seven letters of the alphabet—nine for the
integers less than 10, nine for multiples of 10 that are less than 100,
and nine for multiples of 100 that are less than 1,000. The classical
Greek alphabet contains only twenty-four letters; hence, use was made of
an older alphabet that included three additional archaic letters— (vau
or digamma or stigma), (koppa), and (sampi)—to establish the following
association of letters and numbers:</p>
<p>After the introduction of small letters in Greece, the association of
letters and numbers appeared as follows:</p>
<p>Because these forms are more familiar today, we shall use them here.
For the first nine multiples of 1,000, the Ionian system adopted the
first nine letters of the alphabet, a partial use of the positional
principle, but for added clarity, these letters were preceded by a
stroke or accent:</p>
<p>Within this system, any number less than 10,000 was easily written
with only four characters. The number 8888, for example, would appear as
or as , the accent sometimes being omitted when the context was clear.
The use of the same letters for thousands as for units should have
suggested to the Greeks the full-fledged positional scheme in decimal
arithmetic, but they do not seem to have appreciated the advantages of
such a move. That they had such a principle more or less in mind is
evident not only in the repeated use of the letters α through θ for
units and thousands, but also in the fact that the symbols are arranged
in order of magnitude, from the smallest on the right to the largest on
the left. At 10,000, which for the Greeks was the beginning of a new
count</p>
<p>Ar i t hme t ic and L o gi s t ic</p>
<p>or category (much as we separate thousands from lower powers by a
comma), the Ionian Greek notation adopted a multiplicative principle. A
symbol for an integer from 1 to 9999, when placed above the letter M, or
after it, separated from the rest of the number by a dot, indicated the
product of the integer and the number 10,000—the Greek myriad. Thus, the
number 88888888 would appear as . Where still larger numbers are called
for, the same principle could be applied to the double myriad, 100000000
or 108. Early Greek notations for integers were not excessively awkward,
and they served their purposes effectively. It was in the use of
fractions that the systems were weak.</p>
<p>Like the Egyptians, the Greeks were tempted to use unit fractions,
and for these they had a simple representation. They wrote down the
denominator and then simply followed this with a diacritical mark or
accent to distinguish it from the corresponding integer. Thus, would
appear as λδ0. This could, of course, be confused with the number 30,
but context or the use of words could be assumed to make the situation
clear. In later centuries, general common fractions and sexagesimal
fractions were in use; these will be discussed below in connection with
the work of Archimedes, Ptolemy, and Diophantus, for there are extant
documents that, while not actually dating from the time of these men,
are copies of works written by them—a situation strikingly different
from that concerning mathematicians of the Hellenic period.</p>
<h4 id="arithmetic-and-logistic">Arithmetic and Logistic</h4>
<p>Because documents from the period are entirely missing, there is far
more uncertainty about Greek mathematics from 600 to 450 BCE than about
Babylonian algebra or Egyptian geometry from about 1700 BCE. Not even
mathematical artifacts have survived from the early days of Greece. It
is evident that some form of counting board or abacus was used in
calculation, but the nature and operation of the device must be inferred
from the Roman abacus and from some casual references in works by Greek
authors. Herodotus, writing in the early fifth century BCE, said that in
counting with pebbles, as in writing, the Greek hand moved from left to
right, the Egyptian from right to left. A vase from a somewhat later
period pictures a collector of tribute with a counting board, which was
used not only for integral decimal multiples of the drachma but for
nondecimal fractional subdivisions. Beginning on the left, the columns
designate myriads, thousands, hundreds, and tens of drachmas
respectively, the symbols being in Herodianic notation. Then, following
the units column for drachmas, there are columns for obols (six
obols5one drachma), for the half obol, and for the quarter obol. Here we
see how ancient civilizations avoided an excessive use of fractions:
they simply subdivided units of length, weight, and money so effectively
that they could calculate in terms of integral multiples of the
subdivisions. This undoubtedly is the explanation for the popularity in
antiquity of duodecimal and sexagesimal subdivisions, for the decimal
system here is at a severe disadvantage. Decimal fractions were rarely
used, either by the Greeks or by other Western peoples, before the
period of the Renaissance. The abacus can be readily adapted to any
system of numeration or to any combination of systems; it is likely that
the widespread use of the abacus accounts at least in part for the
amazingly late development of a consistent positional system of notation
for integers and fractions. In this respect, the Pythagorean Age
contributed little if anything.</p>
<p>The point of view of the Pythagoreans seems to have been so
overwhelmingly philosophical and abstract that technical details in
computation were relegated to a separate discipline, called logistic.
This dealt with the numbering of things, rather than with the essence
and properties of number as such, matters of concern in arithmetic. That
is, the ancient Greeks made a clear distinction between mere
calculation, on the one hand, and what today is known as the theory of
numbers, on the other. Whether such a sharp distinction was a
disadvantage to the historical development of mathematics may be a moot
point, but it is not easy to deny to the early Ionian and Pythagorean
mathematicians the primary role in establishing mathematics as a
rational and liberal discipline. It is obvious that tradition can be
quite inaccurate, but it is seldom entirely misdirected.</p>
<p>Fifth-CenturyAthens</p>
<p>The fifth century BCE was a crucial period in the history of Western
civilization, for it opened with the defeat of the Persian invaders and
closed with the surrender of Athens to Sparta. Between these two events
lay the great Age of Pericles, with its accomplishments in literature
and art. The prosperity and intellectual atmosphere of Athens during the
century attracted scholars from all parts of the Greek world, and a
synthesis of diverse aspects was achieved. From Ionia came men such as
Anaxagoras, with a practical turn of mind; from southern Italy came
others, such as Zeno, with stronger metaphysical inclinations.
Democritus of Abdera espoused a materialistic view of the world, while
Pythagoras in Italy held idealistic attitudes in science and philosophy.
In Athens, one found eager devotees of old and new branches of learning,
from cosmology to ethics. There was a bold spirit of free inquiry that
sometimes came into conflict with established mores.</p>
<p>In particular, Anaxagoras was imprisoned in Athens for impiety in
asserting that the sun was not a deity but a huge red-hot stone as big
as the whole Peloponnesus, and that the moon was an inhabited earth
that</p>
<p>T hr e e Cla s s ic al P r oble ms</p>
<p>borrowed its light from the sun. He well represents the spirit of
rational inquiry, for he regarded as the aim of his life the study of
the nature of the universe—a purposefulness that he derived from the
Ionian tradition of which Thales had been a founder. The intellectual
enthusiasm of Anaxagoras was shared with his countrymen through the
first scientific best-seller—a book On Nature—which could be bought in
Athens for only a drachma. Anaxagoras was a teacher of Pericles, who saw
to it that his mentor was ultimately released from prison. Socrates was
at first attracted to the scientific ideas of Anaxagoras but found the
naturalistic Ionian view less satisfying than the search for ethical
verities. Greek science had been rooted in a highly intellectual
curiosity that is often contrasted with the utilitarian immediacy of
pre-Hellenic thought; Anaxagoras clearly represented the typical Greek
motive—the desire to know. In mathematics also, the Greek attitude
differed sharply from that of the earlier potamic cultures. The contrast
was clear in the contributions generally attributed to Thales and
Pythagoras, and it continues to show through in the more reliable
reports about what went on in Athens during the Heroic Age. Anaxagoras
was primarily a natural philosopher, rather than a mathematician, but
his inquiring mind led him to share in the pursuit of mathematical
problems.</p>
<h4 id="three-classical-problems">Three Classical Problems</h4>
<p>We are told by Plutarch that while Anaxagoras was in prison, he
occupied himself with an attempt to square the circle. Here we have the
first mention of a problem that was to fascinate mathematicians for more
than 2,000 years. There are no further details concerning the origin of
the problem or the rules governing it. At a later date, it came to be
understood that the required square, exactly equal in area to the
circle, was to be constructed by the use of a compass and a straightedge
alone. Here we see a type of mathematics that is quite unlike that of
the Egyptians and the Babylonians. It is not the practical application
of a science of number to a facet of life experience, but a theoretical
question involving a nice distinction between accuracy in approximation
and exactitude in thought.</p>
<p>Anaxagoras died in 428 BCE, the year that Archytas was born, just one
year before Plato’s birth and one year after Pericles’ death. It is said
that Pericles died of the plague that carried off perhaps a quarter of
the Athenian population, and the deep impression that this catastrophe
created is perhaps the origin of a second famous mathematical problem.
It is reported that a delegation had been sent to the oracle of Apollo
at Delos to inquire how the plague could be averted, and the oracle had
replied that the cubical altar to Apollo must be doubled. The Athenians
are said to have dutifully doubled the dimensions of the altar, but this
was of no avail in curbing the plague. The altar had, of course, been
increased eightfold in volume, rather than twofold. Here, according to
the legend, was the origin of the “duplication of the cube” problem, one
that henceforth was usually referred to as the “Delian problem”— given
the edge of a cube, construct with compasses and straightedge alone the
edge of a second cube having double the volume of the first.</p>
<p>At about the same time, there circulated in Athens still a third
celebrated problem: given an arbitrary angle, construct by means of
compasses and straightedge alone an angle one-third as large as the
given angle. These
threeproblems—thesquaringofthecircle,theduplicationofthecube,and
thetrisectionoftheangle—havesincebeenknownasthe“threefamous(or
classical) problems” of antiquity. More than 2,200 years later, it was
to be proved that all three of the problems were unsolvable by means of
straightedge and compass alone. Nevertheless, the better part of Greek
mathematics and of much later mathematical thought was suggested by
efforts to achieve the impossible—or, failing this, to modify the rules.
The Heroic Age failed in its immediate objective, under the rules, but
the efforts were crowned with brilliant success in other respects.</p>
<h4 id="quadrature-of-lunes">Quadrature of Lunes</h4>
<p>Somewhat younger than Anaxagoras and coming originally from about the
same part of the Greek world was Hippocrates of Chios. He should not be
confused with his still more celebrated contemporary, the physician
Hippocrates of Cos. Both Cos and Chios are islands in the Dodecanese
group, but in about 430 BCE, Hippocrates of Chios left his native land
for Athens in his capacity as a merchant. Aristotle reported that
Hippocrates was less shrewd than Thales and that he lost his money in
Byzantium through fraud; others say that he was beset by pirates. In any
case, the incident was never regretted by the victim, for he counted
this his good fortune, in that as a consequence he turned to the study
of geometry, in which he achieved remarkable success—a story typical of
the Heroic Age. Proclus wrote that Hippocrates composed an “Elements of
Geometry,” anticipating by more than a century the better-known Elements
of Euclid. Yet the textbook of Hippocrates— as well as another reported
to have been written by Leon, a later associate of the Platonic
school—has been lost, although it was known to Aristotle. In fact, no
mathematical treatise from the fifth century has survived, but we do
have a fragment concerning Hippocrates that Simplicius (fl. ca. 520 CE)
claims to have copied literally from the History of Mathematics (now
lost) by Eudemus. This brief statement, the nearest thing we have to an
original source on the mathematics of the time, describes a portion of
the work of Hippocrates dealing with the quadrature of lunes. A lune is
a figure bounded by two circular arcs of</p>
<p>Q ua drature of Lune s</p>
<p>unequal radii; the problem of the quadrature of lunes undoubtedly
arose from that of squaring the circle. The Eudemian fragment attributes
to Hippocrates the following theorem:</p>
<p>Similar segments of circles are in the same ratio as the squares on
their bases.</p>
<p>The Eudemian account reports that Hippocrates demonstrated this by
first showing that the areas of two circles are to each other as the
squares on their diameters. Here Hippocrates adopted the language and
the concept of proportion that played so large a role in Pythagorean
thought. In fact, it is thought by some that Hippocrates became a
Pythagorean. The Pythagorean school in Croton had been suppressed
(possibly because of its secrecy, perhaps because of its conservative
political tendencies), but the scattering of its adherents throughout
the Greek world served only to broaden the influence of the school. This
influence undoubtedly was felt, directly or indirectly, by
Hippocrates.</p>
<p>The theorem of Hippocrates on the areas of circles seems to be the
earliest precise statement on curvilinear mensuration in the Greek
world. Eudemus believed that Hippocrates gave a proof of the theorem,
but a rigorous demonstration at that time (say, about 430 BCE) would
appear to be unlikely. The theory of proportions at that stage probably
was established only for commensurable magnitudes. The proof as given in
Euclid XII.2 comes from Eudoxus, a man who lived halfway in time between
Hippocrates and Euclid. Just as much of the material in the first two
books of Euclid seems to stem from the Pythagoreans, however, so it
would appear reasonable to assume that the formulations, at least, of
much of Books III and IV of the Elements came from the work of
Hippocrates. Moreover, if Hippocrates did give a demonstration of this
theorem on the areas of circles, he may have been responsible for the
introduction into mathematics of the indirect method of proof. That is,
the ratio of the areas of two circles is equal to the ratio of the
squares on the diameters or it is not. By a reductio ad absurdum from
the second of the two possibilities, the proof of the only alternative
is established.</p>
<p>From this theorem on the areas of circles, Hippocrates readily found
the first rigorous quadrature of a curvilinear area in the history of
mathematics. He began with a semicircle circumscribed about an isosceles
right triangle, and on the base (hypotenuse) he constructed a segment
similar to the circular segments on the sides of the right triangle
(Fig. 4.5). Because the segments are to each other as squares on their
bases and from the Pythagorean theorem as applied to the right triangle,
the sum of the two small circular segments is equal to the larger
circular segment. Hence, the difference between the semicircle on AC and
the segment ADCE equals triangle ABC. Therefore, the lune ABCD is</p>
<p>precisely equal to triangle ABC, and because triangle ABC is equal to
the square on half of AC, the quadrature of the lune has been found.</p>
<p>Eudemus also described a Hippocratean lune quadrature based on an
isosceles trapezoid, ABCD, inscribed in a circle so that the square on
the longest side (base), AD, is equal to the sum of the squares on the
three equal shorter sides, AB and BC and CD (Fig. 4.6). Then, if on side
AD one constructs a circular segment, AEDF, similar to those on the
three equal sides, lune ABCDE is equal to trapezoid ABCDF.</p>
<p>That we are on relatively firm ground historically in describing the
quadrature of lunes by Hippocrates is indicated by the fact that
scholars other than Simplicius also refer to this work. Simplicius lived
in the sixth century, but he depended not only on Eudemus (fl. ca. 320
BCE) but also on Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE), one of the
chief commentators on Aristotle. Alexander described two quadratures
other than those given previously. (1) If on the hypotenuse and the
sides of an isosceles right triangle one constructs semicircles (Fig.
4.7), then the lunes created on the smaller sides together equal the
triangle. (2) If on a diameter of a semicircle one constructs an
isosceles trapezoid with three equal sides (Fig. 4.8), and if on the
three equal sides semicircles are constructed, then the trapezoid is
equal in area to the sum of four curvilinear areas: the three equal
lunes and a semicircle on one of the equal sides of the trapezoid. From
the second of these quadratures, it would follow that if the lunes can
be squared, the semicircle—hence, the circle—can also be squared. This
conclusion seems to have encouraged</p>
<p>FIG. 4.7</p>
<p>Hippia s of Eli s</p>
<p>Hippocrates, as well as his contemporaries and early successors, to
hope that ultimately the circle would be squared.</p>
<p>The Hippocratean quadratures are significant not so much as attempts
at circle-squaring as indications of the level of mathematics at the
time. They show that Athenian mathematicians were adept at handling
transformations of areas and proportions. In particular, there was
evidently no difficulty in converting a rectangle of sides a and b into
a square. This required finding the mean proportional or geometric mean
between a and b. That is, if a:x5x:b, geometers of the day easily
constructed the line x. It was natural, therefore, that geometers should
seek to generalize the problem by inserting two means between two given
magnitudes a and b. That is, given two line segments a and b, they hoped
to construct two other segments x and y such that a:x5x:y5y:b.
Hippocrates is said to have recognized that this problem is equivalent
to that of duplicating the cube, for if b52a, the continued proportions,
on the elimination of y, lead to the conclusion that x3 52a3.</p>
<p>There are three views on what Hippocrates deduced from his quadrature
of lunes. Some have accused him of believing that he could square all
lunes, hence also the circle; others think that he knew the limitations
of his work, concerned as it was with only some types of lunes. At least
one scholar has held that Hippocrates knew he had not squared the circle
but tried to deceive his countrymen into thinking that he had succeeded.
There are other questions, too, concerning Hippocrates’ contributions,
for to him has been ascribed, with some uncertainty, the first use of
letters in geometric figures. It is interesting to note that whereas he
advanced two of the three famous problems, he seems to have made no
progress in the trisecting of the angle, a problem studied somewhat
later by Hippias of Elis.</p>
<h4 id="hippias-of-elis">Hippias of Elis</h4>
<p>Toward the end of the fifth century BCE, a group of professional
teachers quite unlike the Pythagoreans flourished in Athens. Disciples
of Pythagoras had been forbidden to accept payment for sharing their
knowledge with others. The Sophists, however, openly supported
themselves by tutoring fellow citizens—not only in honest intellectual
endeavor, but also in the art of “making the worse appear the better.”
To a certain extent, the accusation of shallowness directed against the
Sophists was warranted, but this should not conceal the fact that
Sophists were usually very broadly informed in many fields and that some
of them made real contributions to learning. Among these was Hippias, a
native of Elis who was active in Athens in the second half of the fifth
century BCE. He is one of the earliest mathematicians of whom we have
firsthand information, for we learn much about him from Plato’s
dialogues. We read, for example, that Hippias boasted that he had made
more money than any two other Sophists. He is said to have written much,
from mathematics to oratory, but none of his work has survived. He had a
remarkable memory, he boasted immense learning, and he was skilled in
handicrafts. To this Hippias (there are many others in Greece who bore
the same name), we apparently owe the introduction into mathematics of
the first curve beyond the circle and the straight line; Proclus and
other commentators ascribe to him the curve since known as the
trisectrix or quadratrix of Hippias. This is drawn as follows: In the
square ABCD (Fig. 4.9), let side AB move down uniformly from its present
position until it coincides with DC, and let this motion take place in
exactly the same time that side DA rotates clockwise from its present
position until it coincides with DC. If the positions of the two moving
lines at any given time are given by AuBu and DAv, respectively, and if
P is the point of intersection of AuBu and DAv, the locus of P during
the motions will be the trisectrix of Hippias—curve APQ in the figure.
Given this curve, the trisection of an angle is carried out with ease.
For example, if PDC is the angle to be trisected, one simply trisects
segments BuC and AuD at points R, S, T, and U. If lines TR and US cut
the trisectrix in V and W, respectively, lines VD and WD will, by the
property of the trisectrix, divide angle PDC in three equal parts.</p>
<p>P hilolaus and Arc hy t a s of Tar entum</p>
<p>The curve of Hippias is generally known as the quadratrix, because it
can be used to square the circle. Whether Hippias himself was aware of
this application cannot now be determined. It has been conjectured that
Hippias knew of this method of quadrature but that he was unable to
justify it. Since the quadrature through Hippias’s curve was
specifically given later by Dinostratus, we shall describe this work
below.</p>
<p>Hippias lived at least as late as Socrates (d. 399 BCE), and from the
pen of Plato we have an unflattering account of him as a typical
Sophist— vain, boastful, and acquisitive. Socrates is reported to have
described Hippias as handsome and learned but boastful and shallow.
Plato’s dialogue on Hippias satirizes his show of knowledge, and
Xenophon’s Memorabilia includes an unflattering account of Hippias as
one who regarded himself an expert in everything from history and
literature to handicrafts and science. In judging such accounts,
however, we must remember that Plato and Xenophon were uncompromisingly
opposed to the Sophists in general. It is also well to bear in mind that
both Protagoras, the “founding father of the Sophists,” and Socrates,
the arch opponent of the movement, were antagonistic to mathematics and
the sciences. With respect to character, Plato contrasts Hippias with
Socrates, but one can bring out much the same contrast by comparing
Hippias with another contemporary—the Pythagorean mathematician Archytas
of Tarentum.</p>
<h4 id="philolaus-and-archytas-of-tarentum">Philolaus and Archytas of
Tarentum</h4>
<p>Pythagoras is said to have retired to Metapontum toward the end of
his life and to have died there about 500 BCE. Tradition holds that he
left no written works, but his ideas were carried on by a large number
of eager disciples. The center at Croton was abandoned when a rival
political group from Sybaris surprised and murdered many of the leaders,
but those who escaped the massacre carried the doctrines of the school
to other parts of the Greek world. Among those who received instruction
from the refugees was Philolaus of Tarentum, and he is said to have
written the first account of Pythagoreanism—permission having been
granted, so the story goes, to repair his damaged fortunes. Apparently,
it was this book from which Plato derived his knowledge of the
Pythagorean order. The number fanaticism that was so characteristic of
the brotherhood evidently was shared by Philolaus, and it was from his
account that much of the mystical lore concerning the tetractys was
derived, as well as knowledge of the Pythagorean cosmology. The
Philolaean cosmic scheme is said to have been modified by two later
Pythagoreans, Ecphantus and Hicetas, who abandoned the central fire and
the counterearth and explained day and night by placing a rotating earth
at the center of the universe. The extremes of Philolaean number worship
also seem to have undergone some modification, more especially at the
hands of Archytas, a student of Philolaus’s at Tarentum.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean sect had exerted a strong intellectual influence
throughout Magna Graecia, with political overtones that may be described
asasortof“reactionaryinternational,”orperhapsbetterasacrossbetween
Orphism and Freemasonry. At Croton, political aspects were especially
noticeable, but at outlying Pythagorean centers, such as Tarentum, the
impact was primarily intellectual. Archytas believed firmly in the
efficacy of number; his rule of the city, which allotted him autocratic
powers, was justandrestrained,forheregarded

there could be no integer that is a geometric mean. Archytas gave more
attention to music than had his predecessors, and he felt that this
subjectshouldplayagreaterrolethanliteratureintheeducationofchildren.
Amonghisconjectureswasonethatattributeddifferencesinpitchtovarying rates
of motion resulting from the flow that caused the sound. Archytas seems
to have paid considerable attention to the role of mathematics in the
curriculum, and to him has been ascribed the designation of the four
branches in the mathematical quadrivium—arithmetic (or numbers at rest),
geometry (or magnitudes at rest), music (or numbers in motion), and
astronomy (or magnitudes in motion). These subjects, together with the
trivium consisting of grammar, rhetoric, and dialectics (which Aristotle
traced back to Zeno), later constituted the seven liberal arts; hence,
the prominent role that mathematics has played in education is in no
small measure due to Archytas.</p>
<p>It is likely that Archytas had access to an earlier treatise on the
elements of mathematics, and the iterative square-root process often
known as Archytas’s had been used long before in Mesopotamia.
Nevertheless, Archytas was a contributor of original mathematical
results. The most striking contribution was a three-dimensional solution
of the Delian problem, which may be most easily described, somewhat
anachronistically, in the modern language of analytic geometry. Let a be
the edge of the cube to be doubled, and let the point (a, 0, 0) be the
center of three</p>
<p>Inc ommensurabili t y</p>
<p>mutually perpendicular circles of radius a and each lying in a plane
perpendicular to a coordinate axis. Through the circle perpendicular to
the x-axis, construct a right circular cone with vertex (0, 0, 0);
through the circle in the xy-plane, pass a right circular cylinder; and
let the circle in the xz-plane be revolved about the z-axis to generate
a torus. The equations of these three surfaces are, respectively, x2 5y2
1z2 and 2ax5x2 1y2 and (x2 1y2 1z2)2 54a2(px32 1y2). These three
surfaces intersect in a point whose x-coordinate is a 12; hence, the
length of this line segment is the edge of the cube desired.</p>
<p>The achievement of Archytas is the more impressive when we recall
that his solution was worked out synthetically without the aid of
coordinates. Nevertheless, Archytas’s most important contribution to
mathematics may have been his intervention with the tyrant Dionysius to
save the life of his friend Plato. The latter remained to the end of his
life deeply committed to the Pythagorean veneration of number and
geometry, and the supremacy of Athens in the mathematical world of the
fourth century BCE resulted primarily from the enthusiasm of Plato, the
“maker of mathematicians.” Before taking up the role of Plato in
mathematics, however, it is necessary to discuss the work of an earlier
Pythagorean—an apostate by the name of Hippasus.</p>
<p>Hippasus of Metapontum (or Croton), roughly contemporaneous with
Philolaus, is reported to have originally been a Pythagorean but to have
been expelled from the brotherhood. One account has it that the
Pythagoreans erected a tombstone to him, as though he were dead; another
story reports that his apostasy was punished by death at sea in a
shipwreck. The exact cause of the break is unknown, in part because of
the rule of secrecy, but there are three suggested possibilities.
According to one, Hippasus was expelled for political insubordination,
having headed a democratic movement against the conservative Pythagorean
rule. A second tradition attributes the expulsion to disclosures
concerning the geometry of the pentagon or the dodecahedron—perhaps a
construction of one of the figures. A third explanation holds that the
expulsion was coupled with the disclosure of a mathematical discovery of
devastating significance for Pythagorean philosophy—the existence of
incommensurable magnitudes.</p>
<h4 id="incommensurability">Incommensurability</h4>
<p>It had been a fundamental tenet of Pythagoreanism that the essence of
all things, in geometry as well as in the practical and theoretical
affairs of man, is explainable in terms of arithmos, or intrinsic
properties of whole numbers or their ratios. The dialogues of Plato
show, however, that the Greek mathematical community had been stunned by
a disclosure that virtually demolished the basis for the Pythagorean
faith in whole numbers. This was the discovery that within geometry
itself, the whole numbers and their ratios are inadequate to account for
even simple fundamental properties. They do not suffice, for example, to
compare the diagonal of a square or a cube or a pentagon with its side.
The line segments are incommensurable, no matter how small a unit of
measure is chosen.</p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the earliest recognition of
incommensurable line segments are as uncertain as is the time of the
discovery. Ordinarily, it is assumed that the recognition came in
connection with the application of the Pythagorean theorem to the
isosceles right triangle. Aristotle referred to a proof of the
incommensurability of the diagonal of a square with respect to a side,
indicating that it was based on the distinction between odd and even.
Such a proof is easy to construct. Let d and s be the diagonal and the
side of a square, and assume that they are commensurable—that is, that
the ratio d/s is rational and equal to p/q, where p and q
areintegerswithnocommonfactor.Now,fromthePythagoreantheoremit is known
that d2 5s2 1s2; hence, (d/s)2 5p2 /q2 52, or p2 52q2. Therefore, p2
mustbe even; hence,p mustbe even.Consequently,q mustbe odd. Lettingp52r
andsubstituting in the equation p2 52q2,we have 4r2 52q2, or q2 52r2.
Then q2 must be even; hence, q must be even. Yet q was previously shown
to be odd, and an integer cannot be both odd and even. It follows,
therefore, by the indirect method, that the assumption that d and s are
commensurable must be false.</p>
<p>In this proof, the degree of abstraction is so high that the
possibility that it was the basis for the original discovery of
incommensurability has been questioned. There are, however, other ways
in which the discovery could have come about. Among these is the simple
observation that when the five diagonals of a regular pentagon are
drawn, these diagonals form a smaller regular pentagon (Fig. 4.10), and
the diagonals of the second pentagon in turn form a third regular
pentagon, which is still smaller. This process can be continued
indefinitely, resulting in pentagons that are as small as desired and
leading to the conclusion that the ratio of a diagonal to a side in a
regular pentagon is not rational. The irrationality of this ratio is, in
fact, a consequence of the argument presented in connection with Fig.
4.2, in which the golden section was shown to repeat itself over and
over again. Was it perhaps this property that led to the disclosure,
possibly by Hippasus, of incommensurability? There is no surviving
document to resolve the question, but the suggestion is at least a
plausible one. In this case, it would notp p have been 2 but 5 that
first disclosed the existence of incommensurable magnitudes, for the
solution of the equation a:x5x:(a2x) leads to ðp521Þ=2 as the ratio of
the side of a regular pentagon to a diagonal.p The ratio of the diagonal
of a cube to an edge is 3, and here, too, the specter of the
incommensurable rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>Para do x e s of Z eno</p>
<p>FIG. 4.10 FIG. 4.11</p>
<p>A geometric proof somewhat analogous to that for the ratio of the
diagonal of a pentagon to its side can also be provided for the ratio of
the diagonal of a square to its side. If in the square ABCD (Fig. 4.11)
one lays off on the diagonal AC the segment AP5AB and at P erects the
perpendicular PQ, the ratio of CQ to PC will be the same as the ratio of
AC to AB. Again, if on CQ one lays off QR5QP and constructs RS
perpendicular to CR, the ratio of hypotenuse to side again will be what
it was before. This process, too, can be continued indefinitely, thus
affording a proof that no unit of length, however small, can be found so
that the hypotenuse and a side will be commensurable.</p>
<h4 id="paradoxes-of-zeno">Paradoxes of Zeno</h4>
<p>The Pythagorean doctrine that “Numbers constitute the entire heaven”
was now faced with a very serious problem indeed, but it was not the
only one, for the school was also confronted with arguments propounded
by the neighboring Eleatics, a rival philosophical movement. Ionian
philosophers of Asia Minor had sought to identify a first principle for
all things. Thales had thought to find this in water, but others
preferred to think of air or fire as the basic element. The Pythagoreans
had taken a more abstract direction, postulating that number in all of
its plurality was the basic stuff behind phenomena; this numerical
atomism, beautifully illustrated in the geometry of figurate numbers,
had come under attack by the followers of Parmenides of Elea (fl. ca.
450 BCE). The fundamental tenet of the Eleatics was the unity and
permanence of being, a view that contrasted with the Pythagorean ideas
of multiplicity and change. Of Parmenides’ disciples, the best known was
Zeno the Eleatic (fl. ca. 450 BCE), who propounded arguments to prove
the inconsistency in the concepts of multiplicity and divisibility. The
method Zeno adopted was dialectical, anticipating Socrates in this
indirect mode of argument: starting from his opponent’s premises, he
reduced these to an absurdity.</p>
<p>The Pythagoreans had assumed that space and time can be thought of as
consisting of points and instants, but space and time also have a
property, more easily intuited than defined, known as “continuity.” The
ultimate elements making up a plurality were assumed, on the one hand,
to have the characteristics of the geometric unit—the point—and, on the
other, to have certain characteristics of the numeric units or numbers.
Aristotle described a Pythagorean point as “unity having position” or as
“unity considered in space.” It has been suggested that it was against
such a view that Zeno propounded his paradoxes, of which those on motion
are cited most frequently. As they have come down to us, through
Aristotle and others, four of them seem to have caused the most trouble:
(1) the Dichotomy, (2) the Achilles, (3) the Arrow, and (4) the Stade.
The first argues that before a moving object can travel a given
distance, it must first travel half of this distance, but before it can
cover this, it must travel the first quarter of the distance, and before
this, the first eighth, and so on, through an infinite number of
subdivisions. The runner wishing to get started must make an infinite
number of contacts in a finite time, but it is impossible to exhaust an
infinite collection, hence the beginning of motion is impossible. The
second of the paradoxes is similar to the first, except that the
infinite subdivision is progressive, rather than regressive. Here
Achilles is racing against a tortoise that has been given a head start,
and it is argued that Achilles, no matter how swiftly he may run, can
never overtake the tortoise, no matter how slow it may be. By the time
that Achilles will have reached the initial position of the tortoise,
the latter will have advanced some short distance, and by the time that
Achilles will have covered this distance, the tortoise will have
advanced somewhat farther, and so the process continues indefinitely,
with the result that the swift Achilles can never overtake the slow
tortoise.</p>
<p>The Dichotomy and the Achilles argue that motion is impossible under
the assumption of the infinite subdivisibility of space and time; the
Arrow and the Stade, on the other hand, argue that motion is equally
impossible if one makes the opposite assumption—that the subdivisibility
of space and time terminates in indivisibles. In the Arrow, Zeno argues
that an object in flight always occupies a space equal to itself, but
that which always occupies a space equal to itself is not in motion.
Hence, the flying arrow is at rest at all times, so that its motion is
an illusion.</p>
<p>Most controversial of the paradoxes on motion and most awkward to
describe is the Stade (or Stadium), but the argument can be phrased
somewhat as follows. Let A1, A2, A3, A4 be bodies of equal size that are
stationary; let B1, B2, B3, B4 be bodies, of the same size as the A’s,
that are moving to the right so that each B passes each A in an
instant—the smallest possible interval of time. Let C1, C2, C3, C4 also
be of equal size with the A’s and B’s and let them move uniformly to the
left with respect</p>
<p>Para do x e s of Z eno</p>
<p>to the A’s so that each C passes each A in an instant of time. Let us
assume that at a given time, the bodies occupy the following relative
positions:</p>
<p>Then, after the lapse of a single instant—that is, after an
indivisible subdivision of time—the positions will be as follows:</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that C1 will have passed two of the B’s; hence,
the instant cannot be the minimum time interval, for we can take as a
new and smaller unit the time it takes C1 to pass one of the B’s.</p>
<p>The arguments of Zeno seem to have had a profound influence on the
developmentofGreekmathematics,comparabletothatofthediscoveryof the
incommensurable, with which they may have been related. Originally,
inPythagoreancircles,magnitudeswererepresentedbypebblesorcalculi, from
which our word “calculation” comes, but by the time of Euclid there is a
complete change in point of view. Magnitudes are not in general
associated with numbers or pebbles, but with line segments. In the
Elements, even the integers themselves are represented by segments of
lines. The realm of number continued to have the property of
discreteness, but the world of continuous magnitudes (and this includes
most of preHellenic and Pythagorean mathematics) was a thing apart from
number andhadtobetreated throughgeometricmethod.Itseemedtobe geometry,
rather than number, that ruled the world. This was perhaps the most
farreaching conclusion of the Heroic Age, and it is not unlikely that
this was due in large measure to Zeno of Elea and Hippasus of
Metapontum.</p>
<h4 id="deductive-reasoning">Deductive Reasoning</h4>
<p>There are several conjectures as to the causes leading to the
conversion of the mathematical prescriptions of pre-Hellenic peoples
into the deductive structure that appears in Greece. Some have suggested
that Thales in his travels had noted discrepancies in pre-Hellenic
mathematics—such as the Egyptian and Babylonian rules for the area of a
circle—and that he and his early successors therefore saw the need for a
strict rational method. Others, more conservative, would place the
deductive form much later—perhaps even as late as the early fourth
century, following the discovery of the incommensurable. Other
suggestions find the cause outside mathematics. One, for example is that
deduction may have come out of logic, in attempts to convince an
opponent of a conclusion by looking for premises from which the
conclusion necessarily follows.</p>
<p>Whether deduction came into mathematics in the sixth century BCE or
the fourth and whether incommensurability was discovered before or after
400 BCE, there can be no doubt that Greek mathematics had undergone
drastic changes by the time of Plato. The dichotomy between number and
continuous magnitude required a new approach to the Babylonian algebra
that the Pythagoreans had inherited. The old problems in which, given
the sum and the product of the sides of a rectangle, the dimensions were
required had to be dealt with differently from the numerical algorithms
of the Babylonians. A “geometric algebra” had to take the place of the
older “arithmetic algebra,” and in this new algebra there could be no
adding of lines to areas or adding of areas to volumes. From now on,
there had to be a strict homogeneity of terms in equations, and the
Mesopotamian normal forms, xy5A, x6y5b, were to be interpreted
geometrically. The obvious conclusion, which the reader can arrive at by
eliminating y, is that one must construct on a given line b a rectangle
whose unknown width x must be such that the area of the rectangle
exceeds the given area A by the square x2 or (in the case of the minus
sign) falls short of the area A by the square x2 (Fig. 4.12). In this
way, the Greeks built up the solution of quadratic equations by their
process known as “the application of areas,” a portion of geometric
algebra that is fully covered by Euclid’s Elements. Moreover, the
uneasiness resulting from incommensurable magnitudes led to an avoidance
of ratios, insofar as possible, in elementary mathematics. The</p>
<p>FIG. 4.12</p>
<p>D e duc t i v e Re a s oning</p>
<p>linear equation ax5bc, for example, was looked on as an equality of
the areas ax and bc, rather than as a proportion—an equality between the
two ratios a:b and c:x. Consequently, in constructing the fourth
proportion, x in this case, it was usual to construct a rectangle OCDB
with sides b5OB and c5OC (Fig. 4.13) and then along OC to lay off OA5a.
One completes rectangle OAEB and draws the diagonal OE cutting CD at P.
It is now clear that CP is the desired line x, for rectangle OARS is
equal in area to rectangle OCDB. Not until Book V of the Elements did
Euclid take up the difficult matter of proportionality.</p>
<p>Greek geometric algebra strikes the modern reader as excessively
artificial and difficult; to those who used it and became adept at
handling its operations, however, it probably appeared to be a
convenient tool. The distributive law a(b1c1d)5ab1ac1ad undoubtedly was
far more obvious to a Greek scholar than to the beginning student of
algebra today, for the former could easily picture the areas of the
rectangles in this theorem, which simply says that the rectangle on a
and the sum of segments b, c, d is equal to the sum of the rectangles on
a and each of the lines b, c, d taken separately (Fig. 4.14). Again, the
identity (a1b)2 5a2 12ab1b2 becomes obvious from a diagram that shows
the three squares and the two equal rectangles in the identity (Fig.
4.15); and a difference of two squares a2 2b2 5(a1b)(a2b) can be
pictured in a similar fashion (Fig. 4.16). Sums, differences, products,

<p>line segments can easily be constructed with a straightedge and a
compass. Square roots also afford no difficulty in geometric algebra. If
one wishes to find a line x such that x2 5ab, one simply follows the
procedure found in elementary geometry textbooks today. One lays off on
a straight line the segment ABC, where AB5a and BC5b (Fig. 4.17). With
AC as the diameter, one constructs a semicircle (with center O) and at B
erects the perpendicular BP, which is the segment x desired. It is
interesting that here, too, the proof as given by Euclid, probably
following the earlier avoidance of ratios, makes use of areas rather
than proportions. If in our figure we let PO5AO5CO5r and BO5s, Euclid
would say essentially that x2 5r2 2s2 5(r2s)(r1s)5ab.</p>
<h4 id="democritus-of-abdera">Democritus of Abdera</h4>
<p>The Heroic Age in mathematics produced half a dozen great figures,
and among them must be included a man who is better known as a chemical
philosopher. Democritus of Abdera (ca. 460 370 BCE) is today celebrated
as a proponent of a materialistic atomic doctrine, but in his time he
had also acquired a reputation as a geometer. He is reported to have
traveled more widely than anyone of his day—to Athens, Egypt,
Mesopotamia, and possibly India—acquiring what learning he could, but
his own achievements in mathematics were such that he boasted that not
even the “rope-stretchers” in Egypt excelled him. He wrote a number of
mathematical works, not one of which is extant today.</p>
<p>The key to the mathematics of Democritus is to be found in his
physical doctrine of atomism. All phenomena were to be explained, he
argued, in terms of indefinitely small and infinitely varied (in size
and shape), impenetrably hard atoms moving about ceaselessly in empty
space. The physical atomism of Leucippus and Democritus may have been
suggested by the geometric atomism of the Pythagoreans, and it is</p>
<p>D e mo c r i tus of Ab dera</p>
<p>not surprising that the mathematical problems with which Democritus
was chiefly concerned were those that demand some sort of infinitesimal
approach. The Egyptians, for example, were aware that the volume of a
pyramid is one-third the product of the base and the altitude, but a
proof of this fact almost certainly was beyond their capabilities, for
it requires a point of view equivalent to the calculus. Archimedes later
wrote that this result was due to Democritus but that the latter did not
prove it rigorously. This creates a puzzle, for if Democritus added
anything to the Egyptian knowledge here, it must have been some sort of
demonstration, albeit inadequate. Perhaps Democritus showed that a
triangular prism can be divided into three triangular pyramids that are
equal in height and area of the base and then deduced, from the
assumption that pyramids of the same height and equal bases are equal,
the familiar Egyptian theorem.</p>
<p>This assumption can be justified only by the application of
infinitesimal techniques. If, for example, one thinks of two pyramids of
equal bases and the same height as composed of indefinitely many
infinitely thin equal cross-sections in one-to-one correspondence (a
device usually known as Cavalieri’s principle, in deference to the
seventeenthcentury geometer), the assumption appears to be justified.
Such a fuzzy geometric atomism might have been at the base of
Democritus’s thought, although this has not been established. In any
case, following the paradoxes of Zeno and the awareness of
incommensurables, such arguments based on an infinity of infinitesimals
were not acceptable. Archimedes consequently could well hold that
Democritus had not given a rigorous proof. The same judgment would be
true with respect to the theorem, also attributed by Archimedes to
Democritus, that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of the
circumscribing cylinder. This result was probably looked on by
Democritus as a corollary to the theorem on the pyramid, for the cone is
essentially a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon of infinitely many
sides.</p>
<p>Democritean geometric atomism was immediately confronted with certain
problems. If the pyramid or the cone, for example, is made up of
indefinitely many infinitely thin triangular or circular sections
parallel to the base, a consideration of any two adjacent laminae
creates a paradox. If the adjacent sections are equal in area, then,
because all sections are equal, the totality will be a prism or a
cylinder and not a pyramid or a cone. If, on the other hand, adjacent
sections are unequal, the totality will be a step pyramid or a step cone
and not the smooth-surfaced figure one has in mind. This problem is not
unlike the difficulties with the incommensurable and with the paradoxes
of motion. Perhaps, in his On the Irrational, Democritus analyzed the
difficulties here encountered, but there is no way of knowing what
direction his attempts may have taken. His extreme unpopularity in the
two dominant philosophical schools of the next century, those of Plato
and Aristotle, may have encouraged the disregard of Democritean ideas.
Nevertheless, the chief mathematical legacy of the Heroic Age can be
summed up in six problems: the squaring of the circle, the duplication
of the cube, the trisection of the angle, the ratio of incommensurable
magnitudes, the paradoxes on motion, and the validity of infinitesimal
methods. To some extent, these can be associated, although not
exclusively, with men considered in this chapter: Hippocrates, Archytas,
Hippias, Hippasus, Zeno, and Democritus. Other ages were to produce a
comparable array of talent, but perhaps never again was any age to make
so bold an attack on so many fundamental mathematical problems with such
inadequate methodological resources. It is for this reason that we have
called the period from Anaxagoras to Archytas the Heroic Age.</p>
<h4 id="mathematics-and-the-liberal-arts">Mathematics and the Liberal
Arts</h4>
<p>We included Archytas among the mathematicians of the Heroic Age, but
in a sense he really is a transition figure in mathematics during
Plato’s time. Archytas was among the last of the Pythagoreans, both
literally and figuratively. He could still believe that number was
all-important in life and in mathematics, but the wave of the future was
to elevate geometry to the ascendancy, largely because of the problem of
incommensurability. On the other hand, Archytas is reported to have
established the quadrivium—arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy—as
the core of a liberal education, and here his views were to dominate
much of pedagogical thought to our day. The seven liberal arts, which
remained a shibboleth for almost two millennia, were made up of
Archytas’s quadrivium and the trivium of grammar, rhetoric, and Zeno’s
dialectic. Consequently, one may with some justice hold that the
mathematicians of the Heroic Age were responsible for much of the
direction in Western educational traditions, especially as transmitted
through the philosophers of the fourth century BCE.</p>
<h4 id="the-academy">The Academy</h4>
<p>The fourth century BCE had opened with the death of Socrates, a
scholar who adopted the dialectic method of Zeno and repudiated the
Pythagoreanism of Archytas. Socrates admitted that in his youth, he had
been attracted by such questions as why the sum 212 was the same as the
product 232, as well as by the natural philosophy of Anaxagoras, but on
realizing that neither mathematics nor science could satisfy his desire
to know the essence of things, he gave himself up to his characteristic
search for the good.</p>
<p>In the Phaedo of Plato, the dialogue in which the last hours of
Socrates are so beautifully described, we see how deep metaphysical
doubts precluded a Socratic concern with either mathematics or natural
science:</p>
<p>I cannot satisfy myself that, when one is added to one, the one to
which the addition is made becomes two, or that the two units added
together make two by reason of the addition. I cannot understand how
when separated from the other, each of them was one and not two, and
now, when they are brought together, the mere juxtaposition or meeting
of them should be the cause of their becoming two.</p>
<p>Hence, the influence of Socrates in the development of mathematics
was negligible, if not actually negative. This makes it all the more
surprising that it was his student and admirer Plato who became the
mathematical inspiration of the fourth century BC.</p>
<p>Although Plato himself made no specific outstanding contribution to
technical mathematical results, he was the center of the mathematical
activity of the time and guided and inspired its development. Over the
doors of his school, the Academy in Athens, was inscribed the motto “Let
no one ignorant of geometry enter here.” His enthusiasm for the subject
led him to become known not as a mathematician, but as “the maker of
mathematicians.”</p>
<p>The men whose work we shall describe (in addition to that of Plato
and Aristotle) lived between the death of Socrates in 399 BCE and the
death of Aristotle in 322 BCE. They are Theodorus of Cyrene (fl. ca. 390
BCE), Theaetetus (ca. 414 369 BCE), Eudoxus of Cnidus (d. ca. 355 BCE),
Menaechmus (fl. ca. 350 BCE) and his brother Dinostratus (fl. ca.
350</p>
<p>BCE), and Autolycus of Pitane (fl. ca. 330 BCE).</p>
<p>These six mathematicians were not scattered throughout the Greek
world, as had been those in the fifth century BCE; they were associated
more or less closely with the Academy. It is clear that Plato’s high
regard for mathematics did not come from Socrates; in fact, the earlier
Platonic dialogues seldom refer to mathematics. The one who converted
Plato to a mathematical outlook was undoubtedly Archytas, a friend whom
he visited in Sicily in 388 BCE. Perhaps it was there that Plato learned
of the five regular solids, which were associated with the four elements
of Empedocles in a cosmic scheme that fascinated men for centuries.
Possibly, it was the Pythagorean regard for the dodecahedron that led
Plato to look on this, the fifth and last, regular solid as a symbol of
the universe. Plato put his ideas on the regular solids into a dialogue
titled the Timaeus, presumably named for a Pythagorean who serves as the
chief interlocutor. It is not known whether Timaeus of Locri really
existed or whether Plato invented him as a character through whom to
express the Pythagorean views that still were strong in what is now
southern Italy. The regular</p>
<p>Elements and regular solids</p>
<p>polyhedra have often been called “cosmic bodies” or “Platonic solids”
because of the way in which Plato in the Timaeus applied them to the
explanation of scientific phenomena. Although this dialogue, probably
written when Plato was near seventy, provides the earliest definite
evidence for the association of the four elements with the regular
solids, much of this fantasy may be due to the Pythagoreans.</p>
<p>Proclus attributes the construction of the cosmic figures to
Pythagoras, but the scholiast Suidas reported that Plato’s friend
Theaetetus (ca. 414 BCE 369 BCE) and the son of one of the richest
patricians in Attica first wrote on them. A scholium (of uncertain date)
to Book XIII of Euclid’s Elements reports that only three of the five
solids were due to the Pythagoreans, and that it was through Theaetetus
that the octahedron and the icosahedron became known. It seems likely
that in any case, Theaetetus made one of the most extensive studies of
the five regular solids, and to him probably is due the theorem that
there are five and only five regular polyhedra. Perhaps he is also
responsible for the calculations in the Elements of the ratios of the
edges of the regular solids to the radius of the circumscribed
sphere.</p>
<p>Theaetetus was a young Athenian who died from a combination of
dysentery and wounds received in battle, and the Platonic dialogue
bearing his name was a commemorative tribute by Plato to his friend. In
the dialogue, purporting to take place some thirty years earlier,
Theaetetus discusses with Socrates and Theodorus the nature of
incommensurable magnitudes. It has been assumed that this discussion
somewhat took the form that we find in the opening of Book X of the
Elements. Here distinctions are made not only between commensurable and
incommensurable magnitudes, but also between those that while
incommensurable in length are, or are not, commensurable inp p square.
Surds such as 3 and 5 are incommensurable in length, but they are
commensurable in square, for their squares have the ratio 3 to 5.</p>
<p>The magnitudes 11p3 and 11p5, on the other hand, are</p>
<p>incommensurable both in length and in square.p p</p>
<p>The dialogue that Plato composed in memory of his friend Theaetetus
contains information on another mathematician whom Plato admired and who
contributed to the early development of the theory of incommensurable
magnitudes. Reporting on the then recent discovery of what wep call the
irrationality of 2, Plato in the Theaetetus says that his teacher,
Theodorus of Cyrene—of whom Theaetetus was also a pupil—was the first to
prove the irrationality of the square roots of the nonsquare integers
from 3 to 17 inclusive. It is not known how he did this or whyp he
stopped with 17. The proof, in any case, would have been con-p structed
along the lines of that for 2 as given by Aristotle and interpolated in
later versions of Book X of the Elements. References in ancient
historical works indicate that Theodorus made discoveries in elementary
geometry that later were incorporated into Euclid’s Elements, but the
works of Theodorus are lost.</p>
<p>Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role
as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp
distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the
theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato
regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of
war, who “must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array
his troops.” The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an
arithmetician “because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay
hold of true being.” Moreover, Plato says in the Republic, “Arithmetic
has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the mind to reason
about abstract number.” So elevating are Plato’s thoughts concerning
numbers that they reach the realm of mysticism and apparent fantasy. In
the last book of the Republic, he refers to a number that he calls “the
lord of better and worse births.” There has been much speculation
concerning this “Platonic number,” and one theory is that it is the
number 604 512,960,000—important in Babylonian numerology and possibly
transmitted to Plato through the Pythagoreans. In the Laws, the number
of citizens in the ideal state is given as 5040 (that is, 7 U 6 U 5 U 4
U 3 U 2 U 1). This is sometimes referred to as the Platonic nuptial
number, and various theories have been advanced to suggest what Plato
had in mind.</p>
<p>As in arithmetic, where Plato saw a gulf separating the theoretical
and the computational aspects, so also in geometry he espoused the cause
of pure mathematics as against the materialistic views of the artisan or
the technician. Plutarch, in his Life of Marcellus, speaks of Plato’s
indignation at the use of mechanical contrivances in geometry.
Apparently, Plato regarded such use as “the mere corruption and
annihilation of the one good of geometry, which was thus shamefully
turning its back upon the unembodied objects of pure intelligence.”
Plato may consequently have been largely responsible for the prevalent
restriction in Greek geometric constructions to those that can be
effected by straightedge and compasses alone. The reason for the
limitation is not likely to have been the simplicity of the instruments
used in constructing lines and circles, but rather the symmetry of the
configurations. Any one of the infinitely many diameters of a circle is
a line of symmetry of the figure; any point on an infinitely extended
straight line can be thought of as a center of symmetry, just as any
line perpendicular to the given line is a line with respect to which the
given line is symmetric. Platonic philosophy, with its apotheosization
of ideas, would quite naturally find a favored role for the line and the
circle among geometric figures. In a somewhat similar manner, Plato
glorified the triangle. The faces of the five regular solids in Plato’s
view were not simple triangles, squares, and pentagons. Each of the four
faces of the tetrahedron, for example, is made up of six smaller right
triangles, formed by altitudes of the equilateral triangular faces. The
regular tetrahedron he therefore thought of as made up of twenty-four
scalene right triangles in which the hypotenuse is double one side; the
regular octahedron contains 836 or 48 such triangles, and the
icosahedron is made up of 2036 or 120 triangles. In a similar way the
hexahedron (or cube) is constructed of twenty-four isosceles right
triangles, for each of the six square faces contains four right
triangles when the diagonals of the squares are drawn.</p>
<p>To the dodecahedron, Plato had assigned a special role as
representative of the universe, cryptically saying that “God used it for
the whole” (Timaeus 55C). Plato looked on the dodecahedron as composed
of 360 scalene right triangles, for when the five diagonals and the five
medians are drawn in each of the pentagonal faces, each of the twelve
faces will contain thirty right triangles. The association of the first
four regular solids with the traditional four universal elements
provided Plato in the Timaeus with a beautifully unified theory of
matter, according to which everything was constructed of ideal right
triangles. The whole of physiology, as well as the sciences of inert
matter, is based in the Timaeus on these triangles.</p>
<p>Pythagoras is reputed to have established mathematics as a liberal
subject, but Plato was influential in making the subject an essential
part of the curriculum for the education of statesmen. Influenced
perhaps by Archytas, Plato would add to the original subjects in the
quadrivium a new subject, stereometry, for he believed that solid
geometry had not been sufficiently emphasized. Plato also discussed the
foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions, and
reorganized the assumptions. He emphasized that the reasoning used in
geometry does not refer to the visible figures that are drawn but to the
absolute ideas that they represent. The Pythagoreans had defined a point
as “unity having position,” but Plato would rather think of it as the
beginning of a line. The definition of a line as “breadthless length”
seems to have originated in the school of Plato, as well as the idea
that a line “lies evenly with the points on it.” In arithmetic, Plato
emphasized not only the distinction between odd and even numbers, but
also the categories “even times even,” “odd times even,” and “odd times
odd.” Although we are told that Plato added to the axioms of
mathematics, we do not have an account of his premises.</p>
<p>Few specific mathematical contributions are attributed to Plato. A
formula for Pythagorean triples—(2n)2 1(n2 21)2 5(n2 11)2, where n is
any natural number—bears Plato’s name, but this is merely a slightly
modified version of a result known to the Babylonians and the
Pythagoreans. Perhaps more genuinely significant is the ascription to
Plato of the so-called analytic method. In demonstrative mathematics one
begins with what is given, either generally in the axioms and the
postulates or more specifically in the problems at hand. Proceeding step
by step, one then arrives at the statement that was to have been proved.
Plato seems to have pointed out that often it is pedagogically
convenient, when a chain of reasoning from premises to conclusion is not
obvious, to reverse the process. One might begin with the proposition
that is to be proved and from it deduce a conclusion that is known to
hold. If, then, one can reverse the steps in this chain of reasoning,
the result is a legitimate proof of the proposition. It is unlikely that
Plato was the first to note the efficacy in the analytic point of view,
for any preliminary investigation of a problem is tantamount to this.
What Plato is likely to have done is to formalize this procedure or
perhaps to give it a name.</p>
<p>The role of Plato in the history of mathematics is still bitterly
disputed. Some regard him as an exceptionally profound and incisive
thinker; others picture him as a mathematical pied piper who lured men
away from problems that concerned the world’s work and who encouraged
idle speculation. In any case, few would deny that Plato had a
tremendous effect on the development of mathematics. The Platonic
Academy in Athens became the mathematical center of the world, and it
was from this school that the leading teachers and research workers came
during the middle of the fourth century. Of these, the greatest was
Eudoxus of Cnidus (408? 335? BCE), a man who was at one time a pupil of
Plato and who became the most renowned mathematician and astronomer of
his day.</p>
<p>Eudoxus</p>
<p>We sometimes read of the “Platonic reform” in mathematics, and
although the phrase tends to exaggerate the changes taking place, the
work of Eudoxus was so significant that the word “reform” is not
inappropriate. In Plato’s youth, the discovery of the incommensurable
had caused a veritable logical scandal, for it had raised havoc with
theorems involving proportions. Two quantities, such as the diagonal and
the side of a square, are incommensurable when they do not have a ratio
such as a (whole) number has to a (whole) number. How, then, is one to
compare ratios of incommensurable magnitudes? If Hippocrates really did
prove that the areas of circles are to each other as squares on their
diameters, he must have had some way of handling proportions or the
equality of ratios. We do not know how he proceeded or whether to some
extent he anticipated Eudoxus, who gave a new and generally accepted
definition of equal ratios. Apparently, the Greeks had made use of the
idea that four quantities are in proportion, a:b5c:d, if the two ratios
a:b and c:d have the same mutual subtraction. That is, the smaller in
each ratio can be laid off on the larger the same integral number of
times, and the remainder in each case can be laid off on the smaller the
same integral number of times, and the new remainder can be laid off on
the former remainder the same integral number of times, and so on. Such
a definition would be awkward to use, and it was a brilliant achievement
of Eudoxus to discover the theory of proportion used in Book V of
Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<p>The word “ratio” essentially denoted an undefined concept in Greek
mathematics, for Euclid’s “definition” of ratio as a kind of relation in
size between two magnitudes of the same type is quite inadequate. More
significant is Euclid’s statement that magnitudes are said to have a
ratio to one another if a multiple of either can be found to exceed the
other. This is essentially a statement of the so-called axiom of
Archimedes—a property that Archimedes himself attributed to Eudoxus. The
Eudoxian concept of ratio consequently excludes zero and clarifies what
is meant by magnitudes of the same kind. A line segment, for example, is
not to be compared, in terms of ratio, with an area; nor is an area to
be compared with a volume.</p>
<p>Following these preliminary remarks on ratios, Euclid gives in
Definition 5 of Book V the celebrated formulation by Eudoxus:</p>
<p>Magnitudes are said to be in the same ratio, the first to the second
and the third to the fourth, when, if any equimultiples whatever be
taken of the first and the third, and any equimultiples whatever of the
second and fourth, the former equimultiples alike exceed, are alike
equal to, or are alike less than, the latter equimultiples taken in
corresponding order (Heath 1981, vol. 2, p. 114).</p>
<p>That is, a/b5c/d if and only if given integers m and n, whenever ma ,
nb, then mc , nd, or if ma5nb, then mc5nd, or if ma . nb, then mc .
nd.</p>
<p>The Eudoxian definition of equality of ratios is not unlike the
process of cross-multiplication that is used today for fractions—a / b5c
/ d according as ad5bc—a process equivalent to a reduction to a common
denominator. To show that is equal to , for example, we multiply 3 and 6
by 4, to obtain 12 and 24, and we multiply 4 and 8 by 3, obtaining the
same pair of numbers 12 and 24. We could have used 7 and 13 as our two
multipliers, obtaining the pair 21 and 42 in the first case and 52 and
104 in the second, and as 21 is less than 52, so is 42 less than 104.
(We have here interchanged the second and third terms in Eudoxus’s
definition to conform to the common operations as usually used today,
but similar relationships hold in either case.) Our arithmetical example
does not do justice to the subtlety and efficacy of Eudoxus’s thought,
for the application here appears to be trivial. To gain a heightened
appreciation of his definition, it would be well to replace a, b, c, d
by surds or, better still, to let a and b be spheres and c and d cubes
on the radii of the spheres. Here a cross-multiplication becomes
meaningless, and the applicability of Eudoxus’s definition is far from
obvious. In fact, it will be noted that strictly speaking, the
definition is not far removed from the nineteenthcentury definitions of
real number, for it separates the class of rational numbers m/n into two
categories, according as ma#nb or ma.nb. Because there are infinitely
many rational numbers, the Greeks by implication were faced with the
concept they wished to avoid—that of an infinite set—but at least it was
now possible to give satisfactory proofs of theorems that involved
proportions.</p>
<p>Method of Exhaustion</p>
<p>A crisis resulting from the incommensurable had been successfully
met, thanks to the imagination of Eudoxus, but there remained another
unsolved problem—the comparison of curved and straight-line
configurations. Here, too, it seems to have been Eudoxus who supplied
the key. Earlier mathematicians apparently suggested that one try
inscribing and circumscribing rectilinear figures in and about the
curved figure and continue to multiply indefinitely the number of sides,
but they did not know how to clinch the argument, for the concept of a
limit was unknown at the time. According to Archimedes, it was Eudoxus
who provided the lemma that now bears Archimedes’ name—sometimes known
as the axiom of continuity—which served as the basis for the method of
exhaustion, the Greek equivalent of the integral calculus. The lemma or
axiom states that given two magnitudes having a ratio (that is, neither
being zero), one can find a multiple of either one that will exceed the
other. This statement excluded a fuzzy argument about indivisible line
segments, or fixed infinitesimals, that was sometimes maintained in
Greek thought. It also excluded the comparison of the so-called angle of
contingency or “horn angle” (formed by a curve C and its tangent T at a
point P on C) with ordinary rectilinear angles. The horn angle seemed to
be a magnitude different from zero, yet it does not satisfy the axiom of
Eudoxus with respect to the measures of rectilinear angles.</p>
<p>From the axiom of Eudoxus (or Archimedes) it is an easy step, by a
reductio ad absurdum, to prove a proposition that formed the basis of
the Greek method of exhaustion:</p>
<p>If from any magnitude there be subtracted a part not less than its
half, and if from the remainder one again subtracts not less than its
half, and if this process of subtraction is continued, ultimately there
will remain a magnitude less than any preassigned magnitude of the same
kind.</p>
<p>This proposition, which we shall refer to as the “exhaustion
property,” is equivalent to Euclid X.1 and to the modern statement that
if M is a given magnitude, ε is a preassigned magnitude of the same
kind, and r is a ratio such that #r ,1, then we can find a positive
integer N such that M(12r)n ,ε for all positive integers n.N. That is,
the exhaustion property is equivalent to the modern statement that
limn-NMð12rÞn 50. Moreover, the Greeks made use of this property to
prove theorems about the areas and the volumes of curvilinear figures.
In particular, Archimedes ascribed to Eudoxus the earliest satisfactory
proof that the volume of the cone is one-third the volume of the
cylinder having the same base and altitude, a statement that would seem
to indicate that the method of exhaustion was derived by Eudoxus. If so,
then it is to Eudoxus (rather than to Hippocrates) that we probably owe
the Euclidean proofs of theorems concerning areas of circles and volumes
of spheres. Facile earlier suggestions had been made that the area of a
circle could be exhausted by inscribing in it a regular polygon and then
increasing the number of sides indefinitely, but the Eudoxian method of
exhaustion first made such a procedure rigorous. (It should be noted
that the phrase “method of exhaustion” was not used by the ancient
Greeks, being a modern invention, but the phrase has become so well
established in the history of mathematics that we shall continue to make
use of it.) As an illustration of the way in which Eudoxus probably
carried out the method, we give here, in somewhat modernized notation,
the proof that areas of circles are to each other as squares on their
diameters. The proof, as it is given in Euclid, Elements XII.2, is
probably that of Eudoxus.</p>
<p>Let the circles be c and C, with diameters d and D and areas a and A.
It is to be proved that a/A5d2 /D2. The proof is complete if we proceed
indirectly and disprove the only other possibilities, namely, a/A,d2 /D2
and a / A.d2 / D2. Hence, we first assume that a / A.d2 / D2. Then,
there is a magnitude au ,a such that au/A5d2 / D2. Let a2au be a
preassigned magnitude ε.0. Within the circles c and C inscribe regular
polygons of areas pn and Pn, having the same number of sides n, and
consider the intermediate areas outside the polygons but inside the
circles (Fig. 4.18). If the number of sides should be doubled, it is
obvious that from these intermediate areas, we would be subtracting more
than the half. Consequently, by the exhaustion property, the
intermediate</p>
<p>areas can be reduced through successive doubling of the number of
sides (i.e., by letting n increase) until a2pn ,ε. Then, because a2au
5ε, we have pn .au. Now, from earlier theorems it is known that pn / Pn
5d2 / D2 and because it was assumed that au / A5d2 / D2, we have pn /Pn
5au / A. Hence, if pn .au, as we have shown, we must conclude that Pn
.A. Inasmuch as Pn is the area of a polygon inscribed within the circle
of area A, it is obvious that Pn cannot be greater than A. Because a
false conclusion implies a false premise, we have disproved the
possibility that a/A.d2 /D2. In an analogous manner, we can disprove the
possibility that a/A,d2 /D2, thereby establishing the theorem that areas
of circles are to each other as squares on their diameters.</p>
<p>Mathematical Astronomy</p>
<p>The property that we have just demonstrated appears to have been the
first precise theorem concerning the magnitudes of curvilinear figures;
it marks Eudoxus as the apparent anticipator of the integral calculus,
the greatest contribution to mathematics made by associates of the
Platonic Academy. Eudoxus, moreover, was by no means only a
mathematician; in the history of science, he is known as the father of
scientific astronomy. Plato is said to have proposed to his associates
that they attempt to give a geometric representation of the movements of
the sun, the moon, and the five known planets. It evidently was tacitly
assumed that the movements were to be compounded of uniform circular
motions. Despite such a restriction, Eudoxus was able to give for each
of the seven heavenly bodies a satisfactory representation through a
composite of concentric spheres with centers at the earth and with
varying radii, each sphere revolving uniformly about an axis fixed with
respect to the surface of the next larger sphere. For each planet, then,
Eudoxus gave a system known to his successors as “homocentric spheres”;
these geometric schemes were combined by Aristotle into the well-known
Peripatetic cosmology of crystalline spheres that dominated thought for
almost 2,000 years.</p>
<p>Eudoxus was without doubt the most capable mathematician of the
Hellenic Age, but all of his works have been lost. In his astronomical
scheme, Eudoxus had seen that by a combination of circular motions, he
could describe the motions of the planets in looped orbits along a curve
known as the hippopede, or horse fetter. This curve, resembling a figure
eight on a sphere, is obtained as the intersection of a sphere and a
cylinder tangent internally to the sphere—one of the few new curves that
the Greeks recognized. At the time, there were only two means of
defining curves: (1) through combinations of uniform motions and (2) as
the intersections of familiar geometric surfaces. The hippopede of
Eudoxus is a good example of a curve that is derivable in either of
these two ways. Proclus, who wrote some 800 years after the time of
Eudoxus, reported that Eudoxus had added many general theorems in
geometry and had applied the Platonic method of analysis to the study of
the section (probably the golden section), but Eudoxus’s two chief
claims to fame remain the theory of proportions and the method of
exhaustion.</p>
<p>Menaechmus</p>
<p>Eudoxus is to be remembered in the history of mathematics not only
for his own work but also through that of his pupils. In Greece, there
was a strong thread of continuity of tradition from teacher to student.
Thus, Plato learned from Archytas, Theodorus, and Theaetetus; the
Platonic influence in turn was passed on through Eudoxus to the brothers
Menaechmus and Dinostratus, both of whom achieved eminence in
mathematics. We saw that Hippocrates of Chios had shown that the
duplication of the cube could be achieved provided that one could find
and was permitted to use curves with the properties expressed in the
continued proportion a/x5x/y5y/ 2a; we also noted that the Greeks had
only two approaches to the discovery of new curves. It was consequently
a signal achievement on the part of Menaechmus when he disclosed that
curves having the desired property were near at hand. In fact, there was
a family of appropriate curves obtainable from a single source—the
cutting of a right circular cone by a plane perpendicular to an element
of the cone. That is, Menaechmus is reputed to have discovered the
curves that were later known as the ellipse, the parabola, and the
hyperbola.</p>
<p>Of all of the curves, other than circles and straight lines, that are
apparent to the eye in everyday experience, the ellipse should be the
most obvious, for it is present by implication whenever a circle is
viewed obliquely or whenever one saws diagonally through a cylindrical
log. Yet the first discovery of the ellipse seems to have been made by
Menaechmus as a mere by-product in a search in which it was the parabola
and the hyperbola that proffered the properties needed in the solution
of the Delian problem.</p>
<p>Beginning with a single-napped right circular cone having a right
angle at the vertex (that is, a generating angle of 45), Menaechmus
found that when the cone is cut by a plane perpendicular to an element,
the curve of intersection is such that in terms of modern analytic
geometry, its equation can be written in the form y2 5lx, where l is a
constant, depending on the distance of the cutting plane from the
vertex. We do not know how Menaechmus derived this property, but it
depends only on theorems from elementary geometry. Let the cone be ABC
and let it be cut in the curve EDG by a plane perpendicular to the
element ADC of the cone (Fig. 4.19).
Then,throughP,anypointonthecurve,pass a horizontal plane cutting the
cone in the circle PVR, and let Q be the other point of intersection of
the curve (parabola) and the circle. From the symmetries involved, it
follows that line PQ &gt; RV at O. Hence, OP is the mean proportional
between RO and OV. Moreover, from the similarity of triangles OVD and
BCA it follows that OV / DO5BC / AB, and from the similarity of
triangles RuDA and ABC it follows that RuD / ARu 5BC / AB. If OP5y and
OD5x are coordinates of point P, we have y2 5RO OV,</p>
<p>or, on substituting equals,</p>
<p>y2 5R0DUOV 5AR0U BC UDOU BC 5 AR0UBC2 2 x:</p>
<p>AB AB AB</p>
<p>Inasmuch as segments ARu, BC, and AB are the same for all points P on
the curve EQDPG, we can write the equation of the curve, a “section of a
rightangled cone,” as y2 5lx, where l is a constant, later to be known
as the latus rectum of the curve. In an analogous way, we can derive an
equation of the form y2 5lx2b2x2 /a2 for a “section of an acute-angled
cone” and an equation of the form y2 5lx1b2x2 /a2 for a “section of an
obtuse-angled</p>
<p>FIG. 4.19</p>
<p>cone,” where a and b are constants and the cutting plane is
perpendicular to an element of the acute-angled or obtuse-angled right
circular cone.</p>
<p>Duplication of the Cube</p>
<p>Menaechmus had no way of foreseeing the hosts of beautiful properties
that the future would disclose. He had hit on the conics in a successful
search for curves with the properties appropriate to the duplication of
the cube. In terms of modern notation, the solution is easily achieved.
By shifting the cutting plane (Fig. 4.19), we can find a parabola with
any latus rectum. If we wish to duplicate a cube of edge a, we locate on
a right-angled cone two parabolas, one with latus rectum a and another
with latus rectum 2a. If, then, we place these with vertices at the
origin and with axes along the y- and x-axes, respectively, the point of
intersection of the two curves will have coordinates (x, y) satisfying
the continued proportion a/x5x/y5y/2a (Fig. 4.20); that is, x5ap3 2, x,
y5ap3 4. The x-coordinate, therefore, is the edge of the cube
sought.</p>
<p>It is probable that Menaechmus knew that the duplication could also
be achieved by the use of a rectangular hyperbola and a parabola. If the
parabola with equation y2 5(a/2)x and the hyperbola xy5a2 are placed on
a common coordinate system, the point of intersection will have
coordinates x5ap3 2; y5ap3 2; the x-coordinate being the side of the
cube desired. Menaechmus was probably acquainted with many of the
now-familiar properties of the conic sections, including the asymptotes
of the hyperbola, which would have permitted him to operate with the
equivalents of the modern equations that we used earlier. Proclus
reported that Menaechmus was one of those who “made the whole of
geometry more perfect,” but we know little about his actual work. We do
know that Menaechmus taught Alexander the Great, and legend attributes
to Menaechmus the celebrated comment, when his royal pupil asked for a
shortcut to geometry: “O King, for traveling over the country there are
royal roads and roads for common citizens; but in</p>
<p>geometry there is one road for all.” Among the chief authorities for
attributing to Menaechmus the discovery of conic sections is a letter
from Eratosthenes to King Ptolemy Euergetes, quoted some 700 years later
by Eutocius, in which several duplications of the cube are mentioned.
Among them is one by Archytas’s unwieldy construction and another by
“cutting the cone in the triads of Menaechmus.”</p>
<p>Dinostratus and the Squaring of the Circle</p>
<p>Dinostratus, a brother of Menaechmus, was also a mathematician; one
of the brothers “solved” the duplication of the cube, the other “solved”
the squaring of the circle. The quadrature became a simple matter once a
striking property of the end point Q of the trisectrix of Hippias had
been noted, apparently by Dinostratus. If the equation of the trisectrix
(Fig. 4.21) is πrsinθ52aθ, where a is the side of the square ABCD
associated with the curve, the limiting value of r as θ tends toward
zero is 2a/π. This is obvious to one who has had calculus and recalls
that limθ-0 sinθ=θ51 for radian measure. The proof, as given by Pappus
and probably due to Dinostratus, is based only on considerations from
elementary geometry. The theorem of Dinostratus states that side a is
the mean proportional between the segment DQ and the arc of the
quarter</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>circle AC; that is, AC=AB5AB=DQ. Using a typically Greek indirect
proof, we establish the theorem by demolishing the alternatives.
Hence,</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>assume first that AC=AB5AB=DR where DR.DQ. Then, let the circle with
center D and radius DR intersect the trisectrix at S and side AD of the
square at T. From S drop the perpendicular SU to side CD. Inasmuch</p>
<p>as it was known to Dinostratus that corresponding arcs of circles are
to</p>
<p>_ _</p>
<p>each other as the radii, we have_ AC=AB5TR_=DR, and because by
hypothesis AC=AB5AB=DR, it follows that TR 5AB_. But from the_
definitional property of the trisectrix it is known that TR=SR
5AB=SU.</p>
<p>_ _</p>
<p>Hence, because TR 5AB, it must follow that SR 5SU, which obviously is
false, because the perpendicular is shorter than any other line or curve
from point S to line DC. Hence, the fourth term DR in the proportion</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>AC=AB5AB=DR cannot be greater than DQ. In a similar manner, we</p>
<p>can prove that this fourth proportional cannot be less than DQ;
hence,</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Dinostratus’s theorem is established—that is, AC=AB5AB=DQ.</p>
<p>Given the intersection point Q of the trisectrix with DC, we then
have a proportion involving three straight-line segments and the
circular arc AC. Hence, by a simple geometric construction of the fourth
term in a proportion, a line segment b equal in length to AC can easily
be drawn. On drawing a rectangle with 2b as one side and a as the other,
we have a rectangle exactly equal in area to the area of the circle with
radius a; a square equal to the rectangle is easily constructed by
taking as the side of the square the geometric mean of the sides of the
rectangle. Inasmuch as Dinostratus showed that the trisectrix of Hippias
serves to square the circle, the curve more commonly came to be known as
the quadratrix. It was, of course, always clear to the Greeks that the
use of the curve in the trisection and quadrature problems violated the
rules of the game—that only circles and straight lines were permitted.
The “solutions” of Hippias and Dinostratus, as their authors realized,
were sophistic; hence, the search for further solutions, canonical or
illegitimate, continued, with the result that several new curves were
discovered by Greek geometers.</p>
<p>Autolycus of Pitane</p>
<p>A few years after Dinostratus and Menaechmus, in the second half of
the fourth century BCE, there flourished an astronomer who has the
distinction of having written the oldest surviving Greek mathematical
treatise. Autolycus of Pitane is the author of a treatise, On the Moving
Sphere, that formed part of a collection known as the “Little
Astronomy,” which was widely used by ancient astronomers. On the Moving
Sphere is not a profound and probably not a very original work, for it
includes little beyond elementary theorems on the geometry of the sphere
that would be needed in astronomy. Its chief significance lies in the
fact that it indicates that Greek geometry had reached the form that we
regard as typical of the classical age. Theorems are clearly enunciated
and proved. Moreover, the author uses without proof or indication of
source other theorems that he regards as well known. We conclude,
therefore, that in Greece in his day, about 320 BCE, a thoroughly
established textbook tradition in geometry existed.</p>
<h4 id="aristotle-1">Aristotle</h4>
<p>Aristotle (384 322 BCE), that most widely learned scholar, like
Eudoxus, was a student of Plato’s and, like Menaechmus, a tutor of
Alexander the Great. Aristotle was primarily a philosopher and a
biologist, but he was</p>
<p>Ar i s t o t le</p>
<p>thoroughly au courant with the activities of the mathematicians. He
may have taken a role in one of the leading controversies of the day,
for to him was ascribed a treatise titled On Indivisible Lines. Modern
scholarship questions the authenticity of this work, but, in any case,
it probably was the result of discussions carried on in the Aristotelian
Lyceum. The thesis of the treatise is that the doctrine of indivisibles
espoused by Xenocrates, a successor of Plato as head of the Academy, is
untenable. Xenocrates thought that the notion of an indivisible, or
fixed infinitesimal of length or area or volume, would resolve the
paradoxes, such as those of Zeno, that plagued mathematical and
philosophical thought. Aristotle, too, devoted much attention to the
paradoxes of Zeno, but he sought to refute them on the basis of common
sense. He hesitated to follow Platonic mathematicians into the
abstractions and technicalities of the day and made no lasting
contribution to the subject. Through his foundation of logic and his
frequent allusion to mathematical concepts and theorems in his
voluminous works, Aristotle can be regarded as having contributed to the
development of mathematics. The Aristotelian discussion of the
potentially and actually infinite in arithmetic and geometry influenced
many later writers on the foundations of mathematics, but Aristotle’s
statement that mathematicians “do not need the infinite or use it”
should be compared with the assertions of our day that the infinite is
the mathematician’s paradise. Of more positive significance is
Aristotle’s analysis of the roles of definitions and hypotheses in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In 323 BCE, Alexander the Great suddenly died, and his empire fell
apart. His generals divided the territory over which the young conqueror
had ruled. In Athens, where Aristotle had been regarded as a foreigner,
the philosopher found himself unpopular now that his powerful
soldierstudent was dead. He left Athens and died the following year.
Throughout the Greek world, the old order was changing, politically and
culturally. Under Alexander, there had been a gradual blending of
Hellenic and Oriental customs and learning, so that it was more
appropriate to speak of the newer civilization as Hellenistic, rather
than Hellenic. Moreover, the new city of Alexandria, established by the
world conqueror, now took the place of Athens as the center of the
mathematical world. In the history of civilization, it is therefore
customary to distinguish two periods in the Greek world, with the almost
simultaneous deaths of Aristotle and Alexander (as well as that of
Demosthenes) as a convenient dividing line. The earlier portion is known
as the Hellenic Age, the later as the Hellenistic or Alexandrian Age. In
the next few chapters, we describe the mathematics of the first century
of the new era, often known as the Golden Age of Greek mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="euclid-of-alexandria">5 Euclid of Alexandria</h2>
<p>Ptolemy once asked Euclid whether there was any shorter way to a
knowledge of geometry than by a study of the Elements, whereupon Euclid
answered that there was no royal road to geometry.</p>
<p>Proclus Diadochus</p>
<h4 id="alexandria">Alexandria</h4>
<p>The death of Alexander the Great had led to internecine strife among
the generals in the Greek army, but after 300 BCE, control of the
Egyptian portion of the empire was firmly in the hands of the Ptolemies,
the Macedonian rulers of Egypt. Ptolemy I laid the foundations for two
institutions at Alexandria that would make it the leading center of
scholarship for generations. They were the Museum and the Library, both
amply endowed by him and his son, Ptolemy II, who brought to this great
research center men of outstanding scholarship in a variety of fields.
Among these was Euclid, the author of the most successful mathematics
textbook ever written—the Elements (Stoichia). Considering the fame of
the author and of his best-seller, remarkably little is known of
Euclid’s life. He was so obscure that no birthplace is</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>E x t ant Wor k s</p>
<p>associated with his name. Although editions of the Elements often
bore the identification of the author as Euclid of Megara and a portrait
of Euclid of Megara appears in histories of mathematics, this is a case
of mistaken identity.</p>
<p>From the nature of his work, it is presumed that Euclid of Alexandria
had studied with students of Plato, if not at the Academy itself. There
is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use
was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student
three pence, “since he must needs make gain of what he learns.”</p>
<h4 id="lost-works">Lost Works</h4>
<p>Of what Euclid wrote, more than half has been lost, including some of
his more important compositions, such as a treatise on conics in four
books. Both this work and an earlier lost treatise on Solid Loci (the
Greek name for the conic sections) by the somewhat older geometer
Aristaeus were soon superseded by the more extensive work on conics by
Apollonius. Among Euclid’s lost works are also one on Surface Loci,
another on Pseudaria (or fallacies), and three books on Porisms. It is
not even clear from ancient references what material these contained. As
far as we know, the Greeks did not study any surface other than that of
a solid of revolution.</p>
<p>The loss of the Euclidean Porisms is particularly tantalizing. Pappus
later reported that a porism is intermediate between a theorem, in which
something is proposed for demonstration, and a problem, in which
something is proposed for construction. Others have described a porism
as a proposition in which one determines a relationship between known
and variable or undetermined quantities, perhaps the closest approach in
antiquity to the concept of function.</p>
<h4 id="extant-works">Extant Works</h4>
<p>Five works by Euclid have survived to our day: the Elements, the
Data, the Division of Figures, the Phaenomena, and the Optics. The
lastmentioned is of interest as an early work on perspective, or the
geometry of direct vision. The ancients had divided the study of optical
phenomena into three parts: (1) optics (the geometry of direct vision),
(2) catoptrics (the geometry of reflected rays), and (3) dioptrics (the
geometry of refracted rays). A Catoptrica sometimes ascribed to Euclid
is of doubtful authenticity, being perhaps by Theon of Alexandria, who
lived some six centuries later. Euclid’s Optics is noteworthy for its
espousal of an “emission” theory of vision, according to which the eye
sends out rays that travel to the object, in contrast to a rival
Aristotelian doctrine in which an</p>
<p>activity in a medium travels in a straight line from the object to
the eye. It should be noted that the mathematics of perspective (as
opposed to the physical description) is the same, no matter which of the
two theories is adopted. Among the theorems found in Euclid’s Optics is
one widely used in antiquity—tanα/tan β,α/β if 0,α,β,π/2. One object of
the Optics was to combat an Epicurean insistence that an object was just
as large as it looked, with no allowance to be made for the
foreshortening suggested by perspective.</p>
<p>The Euclidean Division of Figures is a work that would have been lost
had it not been for the learning of Arabic scholars. It has not survived
in the original Greek, but before the disappearance of the Greek
versions, an Arabic translation had been made (omitting some of the
original proofs “because the demonstrations are easy”), which in turn
was later translated into Latin and ultimately into current modern
languages. This is not atypical of other ancient works. The Division of
Figures includes a collection of thirty-six propositions concerning the
division of plane configurations. For example, Proposition 1 calls for
the construction of a straight line that shall be parallel to the base
of a triangle and shall divide the triangle into two equal areas.
Proposition 4 requires a bisection of a trapezoid abqd (Fig. 5.1) by a
line parallel to the bases; the required line zi is found by determining
z such that ze2 5 ðeb2 1ea2Þ. Other propositions call for the division
of a parallelogram into two equal parts by a line drawn through a given
point on one of the sides (Proposition 6) or through a given point
outside the parallelogram (Proposition 10). The final proposition asks
for the division of a quadrilateral in a given ratio by a line through a
point on one of the sides of the quadrilateral.</p>
<p>Somewhat similar in nature and purpose to the Division of Figures is
Euclid’s Data, a work that has come down to us through both the Greek
and the Arabic. It seems to have been composed for use at the Museum of
Alexandria, serving as a companion volume to the first six books of the
Elements in much the way that a manual of tables supplements a textbook.
It opens with fifteen definitions concerning magnitudes and loci. The
body of the text comprises ninety-five statements concerning the
implications of conditions and magnitudes that may be given in a
problem. The first two state that if two magnitudes a and b are
given,</p>
<p>E B D</p>
<p>A F C</p>
<p>FIG. 5.2</p>
<p>their ratio is given, and that if one magnitude is given and also its
ratio to a second, the second magnitude is given. There are about two
dozen similar statements, serving as algebraic rules or formulas. After
this, the work lays out simple geometric rules concerning parallel lines
and proportional magnitudes, while reminding the student of the
implications of the data given in a problem, such as the advice that
when two line segments have a given ratio then one knows the ratio of
the areas of similar rectilinear figures constructed on these segments.
Some of the statements are geometric equivalents of the solution of
quadratic equations. For example, we are told that if a given
(rectangular) area AB is laid off along a line segment of given length
AC (Fig. 5.2) and if the area BC by which the area AB falls short of the
entire rectangle AD is given, the dimensions of the rectangle BC are
known. The truth of this statement is easily demonstrated by modern
algebra. Let the length of AC be a, the area of AB be b2, and the ratio
of FC to CD be c:d. Then, if FC5x and CD5y, we have x/y5c/d and (a
x)y5b2. Eliminating y, we have (a2x)dx5b2c or dx2 2adx1b2c50, from which
equivalent to this, except that the negative sign before the radical is
used.p x5a=26 ða=2Þ2 2b2c=d: The geometric solution given by Euclid
is</p>
<p>Statements 84 and 85 in the Data are geometric replacements of the
familiar Babylonian algebraic solutions of the systems xy5a2, x 6 y 5b,
which again are the equivalents of solutions of simultaneous equations.
The last few statements in the Data concern relationships between linear
and angular measures in a given circle.</p>
<h4 id="the-elements">The Elements</h4>
<p>The Elements was a textbook and by no means the first one. We know of
at least three earlier such Elements, including that by Hippocrates of
Chios, but there is no trace of these or of other potential rivals from
ancient times. The Elements of Euclid so far outdistanced competitors
that it alone survived. The Elements was not, as is sometimes thought, a
compendium of all geometric knowledge; it was instead an introductory
textbook covering all elementary mathematics—that is, arithmetic (in the
sense of the English “higher arithmetic” or the American “theory of
numbers”), synthetic geometry (of points, lines, planes, circles, and
spheres), and algebra (not in the modern symbolic sense, but an
equivalent in geometric garb). It will be noted that the art of
calculation is not included, for this was not a part of mathematical
instruction; nor was the study of the conics or higher plane curves part
of the book, for these formed a part of more advanced mathematics.
Proclus described the Elements as bearing to the rest of mathematics the
same sort of relation as that which the letters of the alphabet have in
relation to language. Were the Elements intended as an exhaustive store
of information, the author might have included references to other
authors, statements of recent research, and informal explanations. As it
is, the Elements is austerely limited to the business in hand—the
exposition in logical order of the fundamentals of elementary
mathematics. Occasionally, however, later writers interpolated into the
text explanatory scholia, and such additions were copied by later
scribes as part of the original text. Some of these appear in every one
of the manuscripts now extant. Euclid himself made no claim to
originality, and it is clear that he drew heavily from the works of his
predecessors. It is believed that the arrangement is his own, and,
presumably, some of the proofs were supplied by him, but beyond that, it
is difficult to estimate the degree of originality that is to be found
in this, the most renowned mathematical work in history.</p>
<p>Definitions and Postulates</p>
<p>The Elements is divided into thirteen books or chapters, of which the
first half-dozen are on elementary plane geometry, the next three on the
theory of numbers, the tenth on incommensurables, and the last three
chiefly on solid geometry. There is no introduction or preamble to the
work, and the first book opens abruptly with a list of twenty-three
definitions. The weakness here is that some of the definitions do not
define, inasmuch as there is no prior set of undefined elements in terms
of which to define the others. Thus, to say, as does Euclid, that “a
point is that which has no part,” or that “a line is breadthless
length,” or that “a surface is that which has length and breadth only,”
is scarcely to define these entities, for a definition must be expressed
in terms of things that precede and are better known than the things
defined. Objections can easily be raised on the score of logical
circularity to other so-called definitions of Euclid, such as “The
extremities of a line are points,” or “A straight line is a line which
lies evenly with the points on itself,” or “The extremities of a surface
are lines,” all of which may have been due to Plato.</p>
<p>Following the definitions, Euclid lists five postulates and five
common notions. Aristotle had made a sharp distinction between axioms
(or common notions) and postulates; the former, he said, must be
convincing in themselves—truths common to all studies—but the latter are
less obvious and do not presuppose the assent of the learner, for they
pertain only to the subject at hand. We do not know whether Euclid
distinguished between two types of assumptions. Surviving manuscripts
are not in agreement here, and in some cases, the ten assumptions appear
together in a single category. Modern mathematicians see no essential
difference between an axiom and a postulate. In most manuscripts of the
Elements, we find the following ten assumptions:</p>
<p>Postulates. Let the following be postulated:</p>
<p>1.To draw a straight line from any point to any point.</p>
<p>2.To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight
line.</p>
<p>3.To describe a circle with any center and radius.</p>
<p>4.That all right angles are equal.</p>
<p>5.That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines makes the
interiorangles on the same side less than two right angles, the two
straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the
angles are less than the two right angles.</p>
<p>Common notions:</p>
<p>1.Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one
another.</p>
<p>2.If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.</p>
<p>3.If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</p>
<p>4.Things which coincide with one another are equal to one
another.</p>
<p>5.The whole is greater than the part.</p>
<p>Aristotle had written that “other things being equal, that proof is
the better which proceeds from the fewer postulates,” and Euclid
evidently subscribed to this principle. For example, Postulate 3 is
interpreted in the very limited literal sense, sometimes described as
the use of the Euclidean (collapsible) compass, whose legs maintain a
constant opening so long as the point stands on the paper, but fall back
on each other when they are lifted. That is, the postulate is not
interpreted to permit the use of a pair of dividers to lay off a
distance equal to one line segment on a noncontiguous longer line
segment, starting from an end point. It is proved in the first three
propositions of Book I that the latter construction is always possible,
even under the strict interpretation of Postulate 3. The first
proposition justifies the construction of an equilateral triangle ABC on
a given line segment AB by constructing through B a circle with a center
at A and another circle through A with a center at B, and letting C be
the point of intersection of the two circles. (That they do intersect is
tacitly assumed.) Proposition 2 then builds on Proposition 1 by showing
that from any point A as extremity (Fig. 5.3), one can lay off a
straight line segment equal to a given line segment BC. First, Euclid
drew AB,</p>
<p>and on this he constructed the equilateral triangle ABD, extending
the sides DA and DB to E and F, respectively. With B as center, describe
the circle through C, intersecting BF in G; then, with D as center, draw
a circle through G, intersecting DE in H. Line AH is then easily shown
to be the line required. Finally, in Proposition 3 Euclid made use of
Proposition 2 to show that given any two unequal straight lines, one can
cut off from the greater a segment equal to the smaller.</p>
<p>Scope of Book I</p>
<p>In the first three propositions, Euclid went to great pains to show
that a very restricted interpretation of Postulate 3 nevertheless
implies the free use of a compass as is usually done in laying off
distances in elementary geometry. Nevertheless, by modern standards of
rigor, the Euclidean assumptions are woefully inadequate, and in his
proofs Euclid often makes use of tacit postulates. In the first
proposition of the Elements, for example, he assumes without proof that
the two circles will intersect in a point. For this and similar
situations, it is necessary to add to the postulates one equivalent to a
principle of continuity. Moreover, Postulates 1 and 2, as they were
expressed by Euclid, guarantee neither the uniqueness of the straight
line through two noncoincident points nor even its infinitude; they
simply assert that there is at least one and that it has no termini.</p>
<p>Most of the propositions in Book I of the Elements are well known to
anyone who has had a high school course in geometry. Included are the
familiar theorems on the congruence of triangles (but without an axiom
justifying the method of superposition), on simple constructions by
straightedge and compass, on inequalities concerning angles and sides of
a triangle, on properties of parallel lines (leading to the fact that
the sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to two right angles), and
on parallelograms (including the construction of a parallelogram having
given angles and equal in area to a given triangle or a given
rectilinear figure). The book closes (in Propositions 47 and 48) with
the proof of the Pythagorean theorem and its converse. The proof of the
theorem as given by Euclid was not that usually given in textbooks of
today, in which simple proportions are applied to the sides of similar
triangles formed by dropping an altitude on the hypotenuse. For the
Pythagorean theorem, Euclid used instead the beautiful proof with a
figure sometimes described as a windmill or the peacock’s tail or the
bride’s chair (Fig. 5.4). The proof is accomplished by showing that the
square on AC is equal to twice the triangle FAB or to twice the triangle
CAD or to the rectangle AL, and that the square on BC is equal to twice
the triangle ABK or to twice the triangle BCE or to the rectangle BL.
Hence, the sum of the squares is equal to the sum of the rectangles—that
is, to the square on AB. It has been assumed that this proof was
original with Euclid, and many conjectures have been made as to the
possible form of earlier proofs. Since the days of Euclid, many
alternative proofs have been proposed.</p>
<p>It is to Euclid’s credit that the Pythagorean theorem is immediately
followed by a proof of the converse: If in a triangle the square on one
of the sides is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides,
the angle between these other two sides is a right angle. Not
infrequently in modern textbooks, the exercises following the proof of
the Pythagorean theorem are such that they require not the theorem
itself but the still unproved converse. There may be many a minor flaw
in the Elements, but the book had all of the major logical virtues.</p>
<p>Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>Book II of the Elements is a short one, containing only fourteen
propositions, not one of which plays any role in modern textbooks, yet
in Euclid’s day this book was of great significance. This sharp
discrepancy between ancient and modern views is easily explained—today
we have symbolic algebra and trigonometry, which have replaced the
geometric equivalents from Greece. For instance, Proposition 1 of Book
II states, “If there be two straight lines, and one of them be cut into
any number of segments whatever, the rectangle contained by the two
straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut
straight line and each of the segments.” This theorem, which asserts
(Fig. 5.5) that AD (AP1PR1RB)5ADAP1ADPR1ADRB, is nothing more than a
geometric statement of one of the fundamental laws of arithmetic known
today as the distributive law: a(b1c1d)5ab1ac1ad. In later books of the
Elements (V and VII), we find demonstrations of the commutative and
associative laws for multiplication. In Euclid’s day magnitudes were
pictured as line segments satisfying the axioms and the theorems of
geometry.</p>
<p>Book II of the Elements, which is a geometric algebra, served much
the same purpose as does our symbolic algebra. There can be little doubt
that modernalgebragreatlyfacilitatesthemanipulationofrelationshipsamong
magnitudes. Yet, it is undoubtedly also true that a Greek geometer
versed in the fourteen theorems of Euclid’s “algebra” was far more adept
in applying these theorems to practical mensuration than is an
experienced geometer of today. Ancient geometric algebra was not an
ideal tool, but it was far from ineffective and its visual appeal to an
Alexandrian schoolboy must have been far more vivid than its modern
algebraic counterpart can ever be. For example, Elements II.5 contains
what we should regard as an impractical circumlocution for a2 2b2
5(a1b)(a2b):</p>
<p>If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the
rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole, together with
the square on the straight line between the points of section, is equal
to the square on the half.</p>

<p>The diagram that Euclid uses in this connection played a key role in
Greek algebra; hence, we reproduce it with further explanation.
(Throughout this chapter, the translations and most of the diagrams are
based on the Thirteen Books of Euclid’s Elements, as edited by T. L.
Heath.) If in the diagram (Fig. 5.6) we let AC5CB5a, and CD5b, the
theorem asserts that (a1b)(a2b)1b2 5a2. The geometric verification of
this statement is not difficult; however, the significance of the
diagram lies not so much in the proof of the theorem as in the use to
which similar diagrams were put by Greek geometric algebraists. If the
Greek scholar were required to construct a line x having the property
expressed by ax x2 5 b2, where a and b are line segments with a.2b, he
would draw line AB5a and bisect it at C. Then, at C he would erect a
perpendicular CP equal in length to b; with P as center and radius a/2,
he would draw a circle cutting AB in point D. Then, on AB he would
construct rectangle ABMK of width BM5BD and complete the square BDHM.
This square is the area x2, having the property specified in the
quadratic equation. As the Greeks expressed it, we have applied to the
segment AB (5a) a rectangle AH (5ax2x2), which is equal to a given
square (b2) and falls short (of AM) by a square DM. The demonstration of
this is provided by the proposition cited earlier (II.5), in which it is
clear that the rectangle ADHK equals the concave polygon</p>
<p>CBFGHL—that is, it differs from (a/2)2 by the square LHGE, the side
of</p>
<p>The figure used by Euclid inpElementsð Þ2 II.11 and again in VI.30
(our2 which by construction is CD5 a=2 2b :</p>
<p>Fig. 5.7) is the basis for a diagram that appears today in many
geometry books to illustrate the iterative property of the golden
section. To the gnomon BCDFGH (Fig. 5.7), we add point L to complete the
rectangle CDFL (Fig. 5.8), and within the smaller rectangle LBGH, which
is similar to the larger rectangle LCDF, we construct, by making GO5GL,
the gnomon LBMNOG similar to gnomon BCDFGH. Now within the</p>
<p>FIG. 5.6</p>
<p>FIG. 5.7</p>
<p>rectangle BHOP, which is similar to the larger rectangles CDFL and
LBHG, we construct the gnomon PBHQRN similar to the gnomons BCDFGH and
LBMNOG. Continuing indefinitely in this manner, we have an unending
sequence of nested similar rectangles tending toward a limiting point Z.
It turns out that Z, which is easily seen to be the point of
intersection of lines FB and DL, is also the pole of a logarithmic
spiral tangent to the sides of the rectangles at points C, A, G, P, M,
Q, … Other striking properties can be found in this fascinating
diagram.</p>
<p>Propositions 12 and 13 of Book II are of interest because they
adumbrate the concern with trigonometry that was shortly to blossom in
Greece. These propositions will be recognized by the reader as geometric
formulations—first for the obtuse angle and then for the acute angle—of
what later became known as the law of cosines for plane triangles:</p>
<p>Proposition 12. In obtuse-angled triangles, the square on the side
subtending the obtuse angle is greater than the squares on the sides
containing</p>
<p>the obtuse angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of the sides
about the obtuse angle, namely, that on which the perpendicular falls,
and the straight line cut off outside by the perpendicular toward the
obtuse angle.</p>
<p>Proposition 13. In acute-angled triangles, the square on the side
subtending the acute angle is less than the squares on the sides
containing the acute angle by twice the rectangle contained by one of
the sides of the acute angle, namely, that on which the perpendicular
falls, and the straight line cut off within by the perpendicular toward
the acute angle.</p>
<p>The proofs of Propositions 12 and 13 are analogous to those used
today in trigonometry through double application of the Pythagorean
theorem.</p>
<p>Books III and IV</p>
<p>It has generally been supposed that the contents of the first two
books of the Elements are largely the work of the Pythagoreans. Books
III and IV, on the other hand, deal with the geometry of the circle, and
here the material is presumed to have been drawn primarily from
Hippocrates of Chios. The two books are not unlike the theorems on
circles contained in textbooks of today. The first proposition of Book
III, for example, calls for the construction of the center of a circle,
and the last, Proposition 37, is the familiar statement that if from a
point outside a circle a tangent and a secant are drawn, the square on
the tangent is equal to the rectangle on the whole secant and the
external segment. Book IV contains sixteen propositions, largely
familiar to modern students, concerning figures inscribed in, or
circumscribed about, a circle. Theorems on the measure of angles are
reserved until after a theory of proportions has been established.</p>
<p>Theory of Proportion</p>
<p>Of the thirteen books of the Elements, those most admired have been
the fifth and the tenth—the one on the general theory of proportion and
the other on the classification of incommensurables. The discovery of
the incommensurable had threatened a logical crisis that cast doubt on
proofs appealing to proportionality, but the crisis had been
successfully averted through the principles enunciated by Eudoxus.
Nevertheless, Greek mathematicians tended to avoid proportions. We have
seen that Euclid put off their use as long as possible, and such a
relationship among lengths as x:a5b:c would be thought of as an equality
of the areas cx5ab. Sooner or later, however, proportions are needed,
and so Euclid tackled the problem in Book V of the Elements. Some
commentators have gone so far as to suggest that the whole book,
consisting of twenty-five propositions, was the work of Eudoxus, but
this seems to be unlikely. Some of the definitions—such as that of a
ratio—are so vague as to be useless. Definition 4, however, is
essentially the axiom of Eudoxus and Archimedes: “Magnitudes are said to
have a ratio to one another which are capable, when multiplied, of
exceeding one another.” Definition 5, the equality of ratios, is
precisely that given earlier in connection with Eudoxus’s definition of
proportionality.</p>
<p>Book V deals with topics of fundamental importance in all
mathematics. It opens with propositions that are equivalent to such
things as the left-hand and right-hand distributive laws for
multiplication over addition, the left-hand distributive law for
multiplication over subtraction, and the associative law for
multiplication (ab)c5a(bc). Then the book lays out rules for “greater
than” and “less than” and the wellknown properties of proportions. It is
often asserted that Greek geometric algebra could not rise above the
second degree in plane geometry or above the third degree in solid
geometry, but this is not really the case. The general theory of
proportions would permit work with products of any number of dimensions,
for an equation of the form x4 5abcd is equivalent to one involving
products of ratios of lines such as x/ax/b 5c/xd/x.</p>
<p>Having developed the theory of proportions in Book V, Euclid
exploited it in Book VI by proving theorems concerning ratios and
proportions related to similar triangles, parallelograms, and other
polygons. Noteworthy is Proposition 31, a generalization of the
Pythagorean theorem: “In right-angled triangles the figure on the side
subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly
described figures on the sides containing the right angle.” Proclus
credits this extension to Euclid himself. Book VI also contains (in
Propositions 28 and 29) a generalization of the method of application of
areas, for the sound basis for proportion given in Book V now enabled
the author to make free use of the concept of similarity. The rectangles
of Book II are now replaced by parallelograms, and it is required to
apply to a given straight line a parallelogram equal to a given
rectilinear figure and deficient (or exceeding) by a parallelogram
similar to a given parallelogram. These constructions, like those of
II.5 6, are in reality solutions of the quadratic equations bx5ac6x2,
subject to the restriction (implied in IX.27) that the discriminant is
not negative.</p>
<p>Theory of Numbers</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid is often mistakenly thought of as restricted
to geometry. We already have described two books (II and V) that are
almost exclusively algebraic; three books (VII, VIII, and IX) are
devoted to the theory of numbers. The word “number,” to the Greeks,
always referred to what we call the natural numbers—the positive whole
numbers or integers. Book VII opens with a list of twenty-two
definitions distinguishing various types of numbers—odd and even, prime
and composite, plane and solid (that is, those that are products of two
or three integers)—and finally defining a perfect number as “that which
is equal to its own parts.” The theorems in Books VII, VIII, and IX are
likely to be familiar to the reader who has had an elementary course in
the theory of numbers, but the language of the proofs will certainly be
unfamiliar. Throughout these books, each number is represented by a line
segment, so that Euclid will speak of a number as AB. (The discovery of
the incommensurable had shown that not all line segments could be
associated with whole numbers, but the converse statement—that numbers
can always be represented by line segments—obviously remains true.)
Hence, Euclid does not use the phrases “is a multiple of” or “is a
factor of,” for he replaces these by “is measured by” and “measures,”
respectively. That is, a number n is measured by another number m if
there is a third number k such that n5km.</p>
<p>Book VII opens with two propositions that constitute a celebrated
rule in the theory of numbers, which today is known as “Euclid’s
algorithm” for finding the greatest common divisor (measure) of two
numbers. It is a scheme suggestive of a repeated inverse application of
the axiom of Eudoxus. Given two unequal numbers, one subtracts the
smaller a from the larger b repeatedly until a remainder r1 less than
the smaller is obtained; then, one repeatedly subtracts this remainder
r1 from a until a remainder r2 ,r1 results; then, one repeatedly
subtracts r2 from r1; and so on. Ultimately, the process will lead to a
remainder rn, which will measure rn 1, hence all preceding remainders,
as well as a and b; this number rn will be the greatest common divisor
of a and b. Among succeeding propositions, we find equivalents of
familiar theorems in arithmetic. Thus, Proposition 8 states that if
an5bm and cn5dm, then (a2c)n5(b2d)m; Proposition 24 states that if a and
b are prime to c, then ab is prime to c. The book closes with a rule
(Proposition 39) for finding the least common multiple of several
numbers.</p>
<p>Book VIII is one of the less rewarding of the thirteen books of the
Elements. It opens with propositions on numbers in continued proportion
(geometric progression) and then turns to some simple properties of
squares and cubes, closing with Proposition 27: “Similar solid numbers
have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.”
This statement simply means that if we have a “solid number” mamb3 3mc
and a “similar solid number” nanbnc, then their ratio will be m :n —that
is, as a cube is to a cube.</p>
<p>Book IX, the last of the three books on the theory of numbers,
contains several theorems that are of special interest. Of these, the
most celebrated is Proposition 20: “Prime numbers are more than any
assigned multitude of prime numbers.” Euclid here gives the well-known
elementary proof that the number of primes is infinite. The proof is
indirect, for one shows that the assumption of a finite number of primes
leads to a contradiction. Let P be the product of all of the primes,
assumed to be finite in number, and consider the number N5P11. Now, N
cannot be prime, for this would contradict the assumption that P was the
product of all primes. Hence, N is composite and must be measured by
some prime p. But p cannot be any of the prime factors in P, for then it
would have to be a factor of 1. Hence, p must be a prime different from
all of those in the product P; therefore, the assumption that P was the
product of all of the primes must be false.</p>
<p>Proposition 35 of this book contains a formula for the sum of numbers
in geometric progression, expressed in elegant but unusual terms:</p>
<p>If as many numbers as we please be in continued proportion, and there
be subtracted from the second and the last numbers equal to the first,
then as the excess of the second is to the first, so will the excess of
the last be to all those before it.</p>
<p>This statement is, of course, equivalent to the formula</p>
<p>an112a1 a2 2a1</p>
<p>5 ;</p>
<p>a1 1a2 1?1an a1</p>
<p>which in turn is equivalent to</p>
<p>a2arn</p>
<p>Sn 5:</p>
<p>12r</p>
<p>The following and last proposition in Book IX is the well-known
formula for perfect numbers: “If as many numbers as we please, beginning
from unity, be set out continuously in double proportion until the sum
of all becomes prime, and if the sum is multiplied by the last, the
product will be perfect.” That is, in modern notation, if Sn 5112122 1?1
2n 1 52n 21 is prime, then 2n 1(2n 21) is a perfect number. The proof is
easily established in terms of the definition of a perfect number given
in Book VII. The ancient Greeks knew the first four perfect numbers: 6,
28, 496, and 8128. Euclid did not answer the converse question— whether
his formula provides all perfect numbers. It is now known that all even
perfect numbers are of Euclid’s type, but the question of the existence
of odd perfect numbers remains an unsolved problem. Of the two dozen
perfect numbers now known, all are even, but to conclude by induction
that all must be even would be hazardous.</p>
<p>In Propositions 21 through 36 of Book IX, there is a unity that
suggests that these theorems were at one time a self-contained
mathematical system, possibly the oldest in the history of mathematics
and stemming presumably from the middle or early fifth century BCE. It
has even been suggested that Propositions 1 through 36 of Book IX were
taken over by Euclid, without essential changes, from a Pythagorean
textbook.</p>
<h4 id="incommensurability-1">Incommensurability</h4>
<p>Book X of the Elements was, before the advent of early modern
algebra, the most admired—and the most feared. It is concerned with a
systematic classification of incommensurable line segments of the forms
a6pb; pa6pb; a6pb and pa6pb, where a and b, when of the same dimension,
are commensurable. Today, we would be inclinedp p to think of this as a
book on irrational numbers of the types above, where a and b are
rational numbers, but Euclid regarded this book as a part of geometry,
rather than of arithmetic. In fact, Propositions 2 and 3 of the book
duplicate for geometric magnitudes the first two propositions of Book
VII, where the author had dealt with whole numbers. Here he proves that
if to two unequal line segments one applies the process described
previously as Euclid’s algorithm, and if the remainder never measures
the one before it, the magnitudes are incommensurable. Proposition 3
shows that the algorithm, when applied to two commensurable magnitudes,
will provide the greatest common measure of the segments.</p>
<p>Book X contains 115 propositions—more than any other—most of which
contain geometric equivalents of what we now know arithmetically as
surds. Among the theorems are counterparts of rationalizing denominators
of fractions of the form a=ðb6pcÞ and a=ðpb6pcÞ:</p>
<p>Line segments given by square roots, or by square roots of sums of
square roots, are about as easily constructed by straightedge and
compasses as are rational combinations. One reason that the Greeks
turned to a geometric, rather than an arithmetic, algebra was that in
view of the lack of the real-number concept, the former appeared to be
more general than the latter. The roots of ax2x2 5b2, for example, can
always be constructed (provided that a.2b). Why, then, should Euclid
have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, in Propositions 17 and 18 of
Book X, the conditions under which the roots of this equation are
commensurable with a? He showed that the roots are commensurable or
incommensurable, with respect to a, according as pa2 24b2 and a are
commensurable or incommensurable. It has been suggested that such
considerations indicate that the Greeks also used their solutions of
quadratic equations for numerical problems, much as the Babylonians had
in their system of equations x1y5a, xy5b2. In such cases, it would be
advantageous to know whether the roots will or will not be expressible
as quotients of integers. A close study of Greek mathematics seems to
give evidence that beneath the geometric veneer, there was more concern
for logistic and numerical approximations than the surviving classical
treatises portray.</p>
<p>Solid Geometry</p>
<p>The material in Book XI, containing thirty-nine propositions on the
geometry of three dimensions, will be largely familiar to one who has
taken a course in the elements of solid geometry. Again, the definitions
are easily criticized, for Euclid defines a solid as “that which has
length, breadth, and depth” and then tells us that “an extremity of a
solid is a surface.” The last four definitions are of four of the
regular solids. The tetrahedron is not included, presumably because of
an earlier definition of a pyramid as “a solid figure, contained by
planes, which is constructed from one plane to any point.” The eighteen
propositions of Book XII are all related to the measurement of figures,
using the method of exhaustion. The book opens with a careful proof of
the theorem that areas of circles are to each other as squares on the
diameters. Similar applications of the typical double reductio ad
absurdum method are then applied to the volumetric mensuration of
pyramids, cones, cylinders, and spheres. Archimedes ascribed the
rigorous proofs of these theorems to Eudoxus, from whom Euclid probably
adapted much of this material.</p>
<p>The last book is devoted entirely to properties of the five regular
solids. The closing theorems are a fitting climax to a remarkable
treatise. Their object is to “comprehend” each of the regular solids in
a sphere— that is, to find the ratio of an edge of the solid to the
radius of the circumscribed sphere. Such computations are ascribed by
Greek commentators to Theaetetus, to whom much of Book XIII is probably
due. In preliminaries to these computations, Euclid referred once more
to the division of a line in mean and extreme ratio, showing that “the
square on the greater segment added to half the whole is five times the
square on the half”—as is easily verified by solving a/x5x/(a2x)—and
citing other properties of the diagonals of a regular pentagon. Then, in
Proposition 10, Euclid proved the well-known theorem that a triangle
whose sides are respectively sides of an equilateral pentagon, hexagon,
and decagon inscribed in the same circle is a right triangle.
Propositions 13 through 17 express the ratio of edge to diameter for
each of thepp inscribed regular solids in turn:pp13 Þ p e/d is for the
tetrahedron,p þ p for the octahedron, for the cube or hexahedron, (5 5)
10= for the icosahedron, and ð 521 =2 3 for the dodecahedron. Finally,
in Proposition 18, the last in the Elements, it is easily proved that
there can be no regular polyhedron beyond these five. About 1,900 years
later, the astronomer Kepler was so struck by this fact that he built a
cosmology on the five regular solids, believing that they must have been
the Creator’s key to the structure of the heavens.</p>
<p>Apocrypha</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was not uncommon to attribute to a celebrated
author works that were not by him; thus, some versions of Euclid’s
Elements include a fourteenth and even a fifteenth book, both shown by
later scholars to be apocryphal. The so-called Book XIV continues
Euclid’s comparison of the regular solids inscribed in a sphere, the
chief results being that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron
and the icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the
ratio of their volumes, the ratio being that of the edge of the cube to
the edge of the icosahedron, that is, 10 〔3(5= p5)〕. This book may
have been composed by Hypsicles (fl. ca. 150p BCE) on the basis of a
treatise (now lost) by Apollonius comparing the dodecahedron and the
icosahedron. Hypsicles is also the author of an astronomical work, De
ascensionibus, an adaptation for the latitude of Alexandria of a
Babylonian technique for computing the rise times of the signs of the
zodiac; this work also contains the division of the ecliptic into 360
degrees.</p>
<p>The spurious Book XV, which is inferior, is thought to have been (at
least in part) the work of a student of Isidore of Miletus’s (fl. ca.
532 CE), the architect of the Hagia Sophia at Constantinople. This book
also deals with the regular solids, showing how to inscribe certain of
them within others, counting the number of edges and solid angles in the
solids, and finding the measures of the dihedral angles of faces meeting
at an edge. It is of interest to note that despite such enumerations,
all of the ancients apparently missed the so-called polyhedral formula,
known to Rene´ Descartes and later enunciated by Leonhard Euler.</p>
<p>Influence of the Elements</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid was composed in about 300 BCE and was copied
and recopied repeatedly after that. Errors and variations inevitably
crept in, and some later editors, notably Theon of Alexandria in the
late fourth century, sought to improve on the original. Later
accretions, generally appearing as scholia, add supplementary
information, often of a historical nature, and in most cases they are
readily distinguished from the original. The transmission of
translations from Greek to Latin, starting with Boethius, has been
traced in some detail. Numerous copies of the Elements have also come
down to us through Arabic translations, later turned into Latin, largely
in the twelfth century, and finally, in the sixteenth century, into the
vernacular. The study of transmission of these variants presents
continuing challenges.</p>
<p>The first printed version of the Elements appeared at Venice in 1482,
one of the very earliest of mathematical books to be set in type. It has
been estimated that since then, at least a thousand editions have been
published. Perhaps no book other than the Bible can boast so many
editions, and, certainly, no mathematical work has had an influence
comparable to that of Euclid’s Elements.</p>
<h2 id="archimedes-of-syracuse">6 Archimedes of Syracuse</h2>
<p>There was more imagination in the head of Archimedes than in that of
Homer.</p>
<p>Voltaire</p>
<h4 id="the-siege-of-syracuse">The Siege of Syracuse</h4>
<p>During the Second Punic War, the city of Syracuse was caught in the
power struggle between Rome and Carthage, and the city was besieged by
the Romans for three years beginning in 214 BCE. We are told that
throughout the siege, Archimedes, the leading mathematician of the age,
invented ingenious war machines to keep the enemy at bay—catapults to
hurl stones; ropes, pulleys, and hooks to raise and smash the Roman
ships; devices to set fire to the ships. Ultimately, however, during the
sack of the city in 212, Archimedes was slain by a Roman soldier,
despite orders from the Roman general Marcellus that the life of the
geometer be spared. Inasmuch as Archimedes at the time is reported to
have been seventy-five years old, he was most likely born in 287 BCE.
His father was an astronomer, and Archimedes also established a
reputation in astronomy. Marcellus is said to have reserved for himself,
as booty,</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>ingenious planetaria that Archimedes had constructed to portray the
motions of the heavenly bodies. Accounts of the life of Archimedes are
in agreement, however, in depicting him as placing less value in his
mechanical contrivances than in the unusually innovative approach to
abstract products of his thought. Even when dealing with levers and
other simple machines, he was reputedly more concerned with general
principles than with practical applications. Nearly a dozen works
survive that illustrate the problems that interested him.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-equilibriums-of-planes">On the Equilibriums of
Planes</h4>
<p>Archimedes was not the first to use the lever or even the first to
formulate the general law of the lever. Aristotelian works contain the
statement that two weights on a lever balance when they are inversely
proportional to their distances from the fulcrum, and the Peripatetics
associated the law with their assumption that vertical rectilinear
motion is the only natural terrestrial motion. Archimedes, on the other
hand, deduced the law from a more plausible static postulate—that
bilaterally symmetric bodies are in equilibrium. That is, let one assume
that a weightless bar four units long and supporting three unit weights,
one at either end and one in the middle (Fig. 6.1), is balanced by a
fulcrum at the center. By the Archimedean axiom of symmetry, the system
is in equilibrium. But the principle of symmetry also shows that
considering only the right-hand half of the system, the balancing effect
will remain the same if the two weights two units apart are brought
together at the midpoint of the right-hand side. This means that a unit
weight two units from the fulcrum will support on the other arm a weight
of two units that is one unit from the fulcrum. Through a generalization
of this procedure, Archimedes established the law of the lever on static
principles alone, without recourse to the Aristotelian kinematic
argument. After examining the history of these concepts during the
medieval period, one concludes that a conjunction of static and
kinematic views produced advances in both science and mathematics.</p>
<p>Archimedes’ work on the law of the lever is part of his treatise, in
two books, On the Equilibriums of Planes. This is not the oldest extant
book on what may be called physical science, for about a century
earlier, Aristotle had published an influential work, in eight books,
titled Physics. But whereas the Aristotelian approach was speculative
and nonmathematical,</p>
<p>FIG. 6.1</p>
<h4 id="on-floating-bodies">On Floating Bodies</h4>
<p>the Archimedean development was similar to the geometry of Euclid.
From a set of simple postulates, Archimedes deduced deep conclusions,
establishing the close relationship between mathematics and mechanics
that was to become so significant for both physics and mathematics.</p>
<h4 id="on-floating-bodies-1">On Floating Bodies</h4>
<p>Archimedes can well be called the father of mathematical physics, not
only for his On the Equilibriums of Planes, but also for another
treatise, in two books, On Floating Bodies. Again, beginning from a
simple postulate about the nature of fluid pressure, he obtained some
very deep results. Among the earlier propositions are two that formulate
the wellknown Archimedean hydrostatic principle:</p>
<p>Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in a fluid, be so far
immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the
fluid displaced (I.5).</p>
<p>A solid heavier than a fluid will, if placed in it, descend to the
bottom of the fluid, and the solid will, when weighed in the fluid, be
lighter than its true weight by the weight of the fluid displaced
(I.7).</p>
<p>The mathematical derivation of this principle of buoyancy is
undoubtedly the discovery that led the absentminded Archimedes to jump
from his bath and run home naked, shouting, “Eureka!” (“I have found
it!”). It is also possible, although less likely, that the principle
aided him in checking on the honesty of a goldsmith suspected of
fraudulently substituting some silver for gold in a crown (or, more
likely, a wreath) made for King Hieron II of Syracuse. Such fraud could
easily have been detected by the simpler method of comparing the
densities of gold, silver, and the crown by measuring displacements of
water when equal weights of each are in turn immersed in a vessel full
of water.</p>
<p>The Archimedean treatise On Floating Bodies contains much more than
the simple fluid properties so far described. Virtually the whole of
Book II, for example, is concerned with the position of equilibrium of
segments of paraboloids when placed in fluids, showing that the position
of rest depends on the relative specific gravities of the solid
paraboloid and the fluid in which it floats. Typical of these is
Proposition 4:</p>
<p>Given a right segment of a paraboloid of revolution whose axis a is
greater than p (where p is the parameter), and whose specific gravity is
less than that of a fluid but bears to it a ratio not less than ða pÞ2 :
a2, if the segment of the paraboloid be placed in the fluid with its
axis at any inclination to the vertical, but so that its base does not
touch the surface of the fluid, it will not remain in that position but
will return to the position in which its axis is vertical.</p>
<p>Still more complicated cases, with long proofs, follow. It was
probably through his Alexandrian contacts that Archimedes became
interested in the technical problem of raising water from the Nile River
to irrigate the arable portions of the valley; for this purpose he
invented a device, now known as the Archimedean screw, made up of
helical pipes or tubes fastened to an inclined axle with a handle by
which it was rotated. He is supposed to have boasted that if he were
given a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to rest it, he could
move the earth.</p>
<h4 id="the-sand-reckoner">The Sand-Reckoner</h4>
<p>A clear distinction was made in Greek antiquity not only between
theory and application, but also between routine mechanical computation
and the theoretical study of the properties of number. The former, for
which Greek scholars are said to have shown scorn, was given the name
logistic, while arithmetic, an honorable philosophical pursuit, was
understood to be concerned solely with the latter.</p>
<p>Archimedes lived at about the time that the transition from Attic to
Ionian numeration was effected, and this may account for the fact that
he stooped to make a contribution to logistic. In a work titled the
Psammites (Sand-Reckoner), Archimedes boasted that he could write down a
number greater than the number of grains of sand required to fill the
universe. In doing so, he referred to one of the boldest astronomical
speculations of antiquity—that in which Aristarchus of Samos, toward the
middle of the third century BCE, proposed putting the earth in motion
about the sun. Aristarchus asserted that a lack of parallax can be
attributed to the enormity of the distance of the fixed stars from the
earth. Now, to make good his boast, Archimedes had to provide against
all possible dimensions for the universe, so he showed that he could
enumerate the grains of sand needed to fill even Aristarchus’s immense
world.</p>
<p>For the universe of Aristarchus, which is to the ordinary universe as
the latter is to the earth, Archimedes showed that not more than 1063
grains of sand are required. Archimedes did not use this notation but
instead described the number as ten million units of the eighth order of
numbers (where the numbers of second order begin with a myriadmyriads
and the numbers of eighth order begin with the seventh power of a
myriad-myriads). To show that he could express numbers ever so much
larger even than this, Archimedes extended his terminology to call
allnumbersoforderlessthanamyriad-myriadsthoseofthefirstperiod,the second
period consequently beginning with the number (108)108, one that would
contain 800,000,000 ciphers. That is, his system would go up to a</p>
<h4 id="on-spirals">On Spirals</h4>
<p>number that would be written as 1 followed by some eighty thousand
million millions of ciphers. It was in connection with this work on huge
numbers that Archimedes mentioned, all too incidentally, a principle
that later led to the invention of logarithms—the addition of “orders”
of numbers (the equivalent of their exponents when the base is
100,000,000) corresponds to finding the product of the numbers.</p>
<h4 id="measurement-of-the-circle">Measurement of the Circle</h4>
<p>In his approximate evaluation of the ratio of the circumference to
diameter for a circle, Archimedes again showed his skill in computation.
Beginning with the inscribed regular hexagon, he computed the perimeters
of polygons obtained by successively doubling the number of sides until
one reached ninety-six sides. His iterative procedure for these polygons
was related to what is sometimes called the Archimedean algorithm. One
sets out the sequence Pn, pn, P2n, p2n, P4n, p4n … , where Pn and pn are
the perimeters of the circumscribed and inscribed regular polygons of n
sides. Beginning with the third term, one calculates any term from the
two preceding terms by taking alternately their harmonic and geometric
means. That is, P2n 52pnPn /(pn 1Pn), p2n 5ppnP2n, and so on. If one
prefers, one can use instead the sequence an, An, a2n, A2n,…, where an
and An are the areas of the inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons
of n sides. The third and successive terms are calculated by taking
alternately the geometric and harmonic means, so that a2n 5panAn, A2n
52Ana2n =ðAn 1a2nÞ; and so on. His method for computing square roots, in
finding the perimeter of the circumscribed hexagon, and for the
geometric means was similar to that used by the Babylonians. The result
of the Archimedean computation on the circle was an approximation to the
value of π expressed by the inequality 3,π,3, a better estimate than
those of the Egyptians and the Babylonians. (It should be borne in mind
that neither Archimedes nor any other Greek mathematician ever used our
notation π for the ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle.) This
result was given in Proposition 3 of the treatise on the Measurement of
the Circle, one of the most popular of the Archimedean works during the
medieval period.</p>
<h4 id="on-spirals-1">On Spirals</h4>
<p>Archimedes, like his predecessors, was attracted by the three famous
problems of geometry, and the well-known Archimedean spiral provided
solutions to two of these (but not, of course, with straightedge and
compass alone). The spiral is defined as the plane locus of a point that
when starting from the end point of a ray or half line, moves uniformly
along this ray, while the ray in turn rotates uniformly about its end
point. In polar coordinates, the equation of the spiral is r5aθ. Given
such a spiral, the trisection of an angle is easily accomplished. The
angle is so placed that the vertex and the initial side of the angle
coincide with the initial point O of the spiral and the initial position
OA of the rotating line. Segment OP, where P is the intersection of the
terminal side of the angle with the spiral, is then trisected at points
R and S (Fig. 6.2), and circles are drawn with O as center and OR and OS
as radii. If these circles intersect the spiral in points U and V, lines
OH and OV will trisect the angle AOP.</p>
<p>Greek mathematics has sometimes been described as essentially static,
with little regard for the notion of variability, but Archimedes, in his
study of the spiral, apparently found the tangent to a curve through
kinematic considerations akin to the differential calculus. Thinking of
a point on the spiral r5aθ as subjected to a double motion—a uniform
radial motion away from the origin of coordinates and a circular motion
about the origin—he seems to have found (through the parallelogram of
velocities) the direction of motion (hence of the tangent to the curve)
by noting the resultant of the two component motions. This appears to be
the first instance in which a tangent was found to a curve other than a
circle.</p>
<p>Archimedes’ study of the spiral, a curve that he ascribed to his
friend Conon of Alexandria, was part of the Greek search for solutions
of the three famous problems. The curve lends itself so readily to angle
multisections that it may well have been devised by Conon for this
purpose. As in the case of the quadratrix, however, it can also serve to
square the circle, as Archimedes showed. At point P let the tangent to
the spiral OPR be drawn and let this tangent intersect in point Q the
line through O that is perpendicular to OP. Then, as Archimedes showed,
the straightline segment OQ (known as the polar subtangent for point P)
is equal in length to the circular arc PS of the circle with center O
and radius OP (Fig. 6.3) that is intercepted between the initial line
(polar axis) and line OP (radius vector). This theorem, proved by
Archimedes through a typical double reductio ad absurdum demonstration,
can be verified by a student</p>
<h4 id="quadrature-of-the-parabola">Quadrature of the Parabola</h4>
<p>of the calculus who recalls that tan ψ5r/ru, where r5f(θ) is the
polar equation of a curve, ru is the derivative of r with respect to θ,
and ψ is the angle between the radius vector at a point P and the
tangent line to the curve at the point P. A large part of the work of
Archimedes is such that it would now be included in a calculus course;
this is particularly true of the work On Spirals. If point P on the
spiral is chosen as the intersection of the spiral with the 90 line in
polar coordinates, the polar subtangent OQ will be precisely equal to a
quarter of the circumference of the circle of radius OP. Hence, the
entire circumference is easily constructed as four times the segment OQ,
and by Archimedes’ theorem, a triangle equal in area to the area of the
circle is found. A simple geometric transformation will then produce a
square in place of the triangle, and the quadrature of the circle is
effected.</p>
<h4 id="quadrature-of-the-parabola-1">Quadrature of the Parabola</h4>
<p>The work On Spirals was much admired but little read, for it was
generally regarded as the most difficult of all Archimedean works. Of
the treatises concerned chiefly with “the method of exhaustion,” the
most popular was Quadrature of the Parabola. The conic sections had been
known for almost a century when Archimedes wrote it, yet no progress had
been made in finding their areas. It took the greatest mathematician of
antiquity to square a conic section—a segment of the parabola— which he
accomplished in Proposition 17 of the work in which the quadrature was
the goal. The proof by the standard Eudoxean method of exhaustion is
long and involved, but Archimedes rigorously proved that the area K of a
parabolic segment APBQC (Fig. 6.4) is four-thirds the area of a triangle
T having the same base and equal height. In the succeeding (and last)
seven propositions, Archimedes gave a second but different proof of the
same theorem. He first showed that the area of the largest inscribed
triangle, ABC, on the base AC is four times the sum of the corresponding
inscribed triangles on each of the lines AB and BC as base. If you
continue the process suggested by this relationship, it</p>
<p>becomes clear that the area K of the parabolic segment ABC is given
by the sum of the infinite series T 1T=41T =42 1?1T =4n 1?; which, of
course, is T. Archimedes did not refer to the sum of the infinite
series, for infinite processes were frowned on in his day; instead, he
proved by a double reductio ad absurdum that K can be neither more nor
less than T. (Archimedes, like his predecessors, did not use the name
“parabola” but the word “orthotome,” or “section of a right cone.”)</p>
<p>In the preamble to Quadrature of the Parabola, we find the assumption
or lemma that is usually known today as the axiom of Archimedes: “That
the excess by which the greater of two unequal areas exceeds the less
can, by being added to itself, be made to exceed any given finite area.”
This axiom in effect rules out the fixed infinitesimal or indivisible
that had been much discussed in Plato’s day. Archimedes freely admitted
that</p>
<p>the earlier geometers have also used this lemma, for it is by the use
of this same lemma that they have shown that circles are to one another
in the duplicate ratio of their diameters, and that spheres are to one
another in the triplicate ratio of their diameters, and further that
every pyramid is one third part of the prism which has the same base
with the pyramid and equal height; also, that every cone is one third
part of the cylinder having the same base as the cone and equal height
they proved by assuming a certain lemma similar to that aforesaid.</p>
<p>The “earlier geometers” mentioned here presumably included Eudoxus
and his successors.</p>
<h4 id="on-conoids-and-spheroids">On Conoids and Spheroids</h4>
<p>Archimedes apparently was unable to find the area of a general
segment of an ellipse or a hyperbola. Finding the area of a parabolic
segment by modern integration involves nothing worse than polynomials,
but the integrals arising in the quadrature of a segment of an ellipse
or a hyperbola (as well as the arcs of these curves or the parabola)
require</p>
<h4 id="on-conoids-and-spheroids-1">On Conoids and Spheroids</h4>
<p>transcendental functions. Nevertheless, in his important treatise On
Conoids and Spheroids, Archimedes found the area of the entire ellipse:
“The areas of ellipses are as the rectangles under their axes”
(Proposition 6). This is, of course, the same as saying that the area of
x2 /a2 1 y2 /b2 51 is πab or that the area of an ellipse is the same as
the area of a circle whose radius is the geometric mean of the semiaxes
of the ellipse. Moreover, in the same treatise Archimedes showed how to
find the volumes of segments cut from an ellipsoid or a paraboloid or a
hyperboloid (of two sheets) of revolution about the principal axis. The
process that he used is so nearly the same as that in modern integration
that we shall describe it for one case. Let ABC be a paraboloidal
segment (or paraboloidal “conoid”) and let its axis be CD (Fig. 6.5);
about the solid circumscribe the circular cylinder ABFE, also having CD
as axis. Divide the axis into n equal parts of length h, and through the
points of division pass planes parallel to the base. On the circular
sections that are cut from the paraboloid by these planes, construct
inscribed and circumscribed cylindrical frusta, as shown in the figure.
It is then easy to establish, through the equation of the parabola and
the sum of an arithmetic progression, the following proportions and
inequalities:</p>
<p>Cylinder ABEF n2h n2h</p>
<p>5 . 1 2 ;</p>
<p>Inscribed figure h12h13h1?1ðn21Þh 2n h</p>
<p>Cylinder ABEF n2h n2h</p>
<p>5 , 1 2 :</p>
<p>Circumscribed figure h12h13h1?1nh 2n h</p>
<p>Archimedes had previously shown that the difference in volume between
the circumscribed and inscribed figures was equal to the volume of the
lowest slice of the circumscribed cylinder; by increasing the number n
of subdivisions on the axis, thereby making each slice thinner, the
difference between the circumscribed and inscribed figures can be made
less than any preassigned magnitude. Hence, the inequalities lead to the
necessary conclusion that the volume of the cylinder is twice the volume
of the conoidal segment. This work differs from the modern procedure in
integral calculus chiefly in the lack of the concept of limit of</p>
<p>a function—a concept that was so near at hand and yet was never
formulated by the ancients, not even by Archimedes, the man who came
closest to achieving it.</p>
<h4 id="on-the-sphere-and-cylinder">On the Sphere and Cylinder</h4>
<p>Archimedes composed many marvelous treatises; his successors were
inclined to admire most the one On Spirals. The author himself seems to
have been partial to another, On the Sphere and Cylinder. Archimedes
requested that on his tomb be carved a representation of a sphere
inscribed in a right circular cylinder the height of which is equal to
its diameter, for he had discovered and proved that the ratio of the
volumes of cylinder and sphere is the same as the ratio of the
areas—that is, 3 to 2. This property, which Archimedes discovered
subsequent to his Quadrature of the Parabola, remained unknown, he said,
to geometers before him. It had once been thought that the Egyptians
knew how to find the area of a hemisphere, but Archimedes now appears to
be the first one to have known and proved that the area of a sphere is
just four times the area of a great circle of the sphere. Moreover,
Archimedes showed that “the surface of any segment of a sphere is equal
to a circle whose radius is equal to the straight line drawn from the
vertex of the segment to the circumference of the circle which is the
base of the segment.” This, of course, is equivalent to the more
familiar statement that the surface area of any segment of a sphere is
equal to that of the curved surface of a cylinder whose radius is the
same as that of the sphere and whose height is the same as that of the
segment. That is, the surface area of the segment does not depend on the
distance from the center of the sphere, but only on the altitude (or
thickness) of the segment. The crucial theorem on the surface of the
sphere appears in Proposition 33, following a long series of preliminary
theorems, including one that is equivalent to an integration of the sine
function:</p>
<p>If a polygon be inscribed in a segment of a circle LALu so that all
its sides excluding the base are equal and their number even, as
LK…A…KuLu, A being the middle point of the segment; and if the lines
BBu, CCu,… parallel to the base LLu and joining pairs of angular points
be drawn, then (BBu 1CCu 11LM):AM5AuB:BA, where M is the middle point of
LLu and AAu is the diameter through M 〔Fig. 6.6〕.</p>
<p>This is the geometric equivalent of the trigonometric equation</p>

<h4 id="on-the-sphere-and-cylinder-1">On the Sphere and Cylinder</h4>
<p>From this theorem, it is easy to derive the modern expression ϕ</p>
<p>0 sinxdx512cosφ by multiplying both sides of the previous equation by
θ/n and taking limits as n increases indefinitely. The left-hand side
becomes</p>

<p>n-N 2n 2n</p>
<p>π The equivalent of the special case 0 sinxdx512cosπ52 had been given
by Archimedes in the preceding proposition.R</p>
<p>An interesting light on Greek geometric algebra is cast by a problem
in Book II of On the Sphere and Cylinder. In Proposition 2, Archimedes
justified his formula for the volume of a segment of a given sphere; in
Proposition 3, he showed that to cut a given sphere by a plane so that
the surfaces of the segments are in a given ratio, one simply passes a
plane perpendicular to a diameter through a point on the diameter that
divides the diameter into two segments having the desired ratio. He then
showed in Proposition 4 how to cut a given sphere so that the volumes of
the two segments are in a given ratio—a far more difficult problem. In
modern notation, Archimedes was led to the equation</p>
<p>4a22 ð3a2xÞðm1nÞ</p>
<p>5 ;</p>
<p>x ma</p>
<p>where m:n is the ratio of the segments. This is a cubic equation, and
Archimedes attacked its solution as had his predecessors in solving the
Delian problem—through intersecting conics. Interestingly, the Greek
approach to the cubic was quite different from that to the quadratic
equation. By analogy with the “application of areas” in the latter case,
we would anticipate an “application of volumes,” but this was not
adopted. Through substitutions, Archimedes reduced his cubic equation to
the form x2(c2x)5db2 and promised to give separately a complete analysis
of this cubic with respect to the number of positive roots. This
analysis had apparently been lost for many centuries when Eutocius, an
important commentator of the early sixth century, found a fragment that
seems to contain the authentic Archimedean analysis. The solution was
carried out by means of the intersection of the parabola cx2 5b2y and
the hyperbola (c2x)y5cd. Going further, he found a condition on the
coefficients that determines the number of real roots satisfying the
given requirements—a condition equivalent to finding the discriminant,
27b2d24c3, of the cubic equation b2d5x2(c2x). Inasmuch as all cubic
equations can be transformed to the Archimedean type, we have here the
essence of a complete analysis of the general cubic.</p>
<h4 id="book-of-lemmas">Book of Lemmas</h4>
<p>Most of the Archimedean treatises that we have described are a part
of advanced mathematics, but the great Syracusan was not above proposing
elementary problems. In his Book of Lemmas, for example, we find a study
of the so-called arbelos, or “shoemaker’s knife.” The shoemaker’s knife
is the region bounded by the three semicircles tangent in pairs in Fig.
6.7, the area in question being that which lies inside the largest
semicircle and outside the two smallest. Archimedes showed in
Proposition 4 that if CD is perpendicular to AB, the area of the circle
with CD as diameter is equal to the area of the arbelos. In the next
proposition, it is shown that the two circles inscribed within the two
regions into which CD divides the shoemaker’s knife are equal.</p>
<p>S e mir e gular S olids and Tr igonome tr y</p>
<p>It is in the Book of Lemmas that we also find (as Proposition 8) the
well-known Archimedean trisection of the angle. Let ABC be the angle to
be trisected (Fig. 6.8). Then, with B as center, draw a circle of any
radius intersecting AB in P and BC in Q, with BC extended in R. Then,
draw a line STP such that S lies on CQBR extended and T lies on the
circle and such that ST5BQ5BP5BT. It is then readily shown, because
triangles STB and TBP are isosceles, that angle BST is precisely a third
of angle QBP, the angle that was to have been trisected. Archimedes and
his contemporaries were, of course, aware that this is not a canonical
trisection in the Platonic sense, for it involves what they called a
neusis—that is, an insertion of a given length, in this case ST5BQ,
between two figures, here the line QR extended, and the circle.</p>
<p>The Book of Lemmas has not survived in the original Greek, but
through Arabic translation that later was turned into Latin. (Hence, it
is often cited by its Latin title of Liber assumptorum.) In fact, the
work as it has come down to us cannot be genuinely Archimedean, for his
name is quoted several times within the text. Yet, even if the treatise
is nothing more than a collection of miscellaneous theorems that were
attributed by the Arabs to Archimedes, the work probably is
substantially authentic. There is also doubt about the authenticity of
the “cattle-problem,” which is a challenge to mathematicians to solve a
set of indeterminate simultaneous equations in eight unknown quantities.
The problem incidentally provides a first example of what later was to
be known as a “Pell equation.”</p>
<p>Semiregular Solids andTrigonometry</p>
<p>That quite a number of Archimedean works have been lost is clear from
many references. We learn (from Pappus) that Archimedes discovered all
of the thirteen possible so-called semiregular solids, or convex
polyhedrons whose faces are regular polygons but not all of the same
type. Arabic scholars inform us that the familiar area formula for a
triangle in terms of its three sides, usually known as Heron’s formula—
K 5psðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞ, where s is the semiperimeter—was known</p>
<p>FIG. 6.8</p>
<p>to Archimedes several centuries before Heron lived. Arabic scholars
also attribute to Archimedes the“theorem onthe brokenchord”—if AB and BC
make up any broken chord in a circle (with AB 6¼ BC) and if M is the
midpoint of the arc ABC and F the foot of the perpendicular from M to
the longer chord, F will be the midpoint of the broken chord ABC (Fig.
6.9). Al-Birunigaveseveralproofsofthetheorem,oneofwhichiscarriedoutby
drawing in the dotted lines in the figure, making FCu 5FC and proving
that ΔMBCu DΔMBA. Hence, BCu 5BA, and it therefore follows that
CuF5AB1BF5FC. We do not know whether Archimedes saw any trigonometric
significance in the theorem, but it has been suggested that it</p>
<p>served for him as a formula analogous to our sin(x2y)5sinxcos</p>
<p>_ _</p>
<p>y2cosxsiny. To show the equivalence, we let MC 52x and BM 52y.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Then, AB 52x22y. Now, the chords corresponding to these three arcs
are, respectively, MC52sinx, BM52siny, and AB52sin(x2y). Moreover, the
projections of MC and MB on BC are FC52sinxcosy and FB52sinycosx. If,
finally, we write the broken-chord theorem in the form AB5FC2FB, and if
for these three chords we substitute their trigonometric equivalents,
the formula for sin(x2y) results. Other trigonometric identities can, of
course, be derived from the same broken-chord theorem, indicating that
Archimedes may have found it a useful tool in his astronomical
calculations.</p>
<h4 id="the-method">The Method</h4>
<p>Unlike the Elements of Euclid, which have survived in many Greek and
Arabic manuscripts, the treatises of Archimedes have reached us through
a slender thread. Almost all copies are from a single Greek original
that was in existence in the early sixteenth century and itself was
copied from an original of about the ninth or tenth century. The
Elements of Euclid has been familiar to mathematicians virtually without
interruption since its composition, but Archimedean treatises have had a
more checkered career. There have been times when few or even none of
Archimedes’</p>
<h4 id="the-method-1">The Method</h4>
<p>works were known. In the days of Eutocius, a first-rate scholar and
skillful commentator of the sixth century, only three of the many
Archimedean works were generally known—On the Equilibrium of Planes, the
incomplete Measurement of a Circle, and the admirable On the Sphere and
Cylinder. Under the circumstances, it is a wonder that such a large
proportion of what Archimedes wrote has survived to this day. Among the
amazing aspects of the provenance of Archimedean works is the discovery
within the twentieth century of one of the most important treatises—one
that Archimedes simply called The Method and that had been lost since
the early centuries of our era until its rediscovery in 1906.</p>
<p>The Method of Archimedes is of particular significance because it
discloses for us a facet of Archimedes’ thought that is not found
elsewhere. His other treatises are gems of logical precision, with
little hint of the preliminary analysis that may have led to the
definitive formulations. So thoroughly without motivation did his proofs
appear to some writers of the seventeenth century that they suspected
Archimedes of having concealed his method of approach in order that his
work might be admired more. How unwarranted such an ungenerous estimate
of the great Syracusan was became clear in 1906 with the discovery of
the manuscript containing The Method. Here Archimedes had published a
description of the preliminary “mechanical” investigations that had led
to many of his chief mathematical discoveries. He thought that his
“method” in these cases lacked rigor, because it assumed an area, for
example, to be a sum of line segments.</p>
<p>The Method, as we have it, contains most of the text of some fifteen
propositions sent in the form of a letter to Eratosthenes, a
mathematician and the chief of the Alexandrian Library. The author
opened by saying that it is easier to supply a proof of a theorem if we
first have some knowledge of what is involved; as an example, he cites
the proofs of Eudoxus on the cone and the pyramid, which had been
facilitated by the preliminary assertions, without proof, made by
Democritus. Then, Archimedes announced that he himself had a
“mechanical” approach that paved the way for some of his proofs. The
very first theorem that he discovered by this approach was the one on
the area of a parabolic segment; in Proposition 1 of The Method, the
author describes how he arrived at this theorem by balancing lines as
one balances weights in mechanics. He thought of the areas of the
parabolic segment ABC and the triangle AFC (where FC is tangent to the
parabola at C) as the totality of a set of lines parallel to the
diameter QB of the parabola, such as OP (Fig. 6.10) for the parabola and
OM for the triangle. If one were to place at H (where HK5KC) a line
segment equal to OP, this would just balance the line OM where it now
is, K being the fulcrum. (This can be shown through the law of the lever
and the property of the parabola.) Hence, the area of the parabola, if
placed with its center of gravity at H, will just balance the triangle,
whose center of gravity is along KC and a</p>
<p>C</p>
<p>third of the way from K to C. From this, one easily sees that the
area of the parabolic segment is one-third the area of triangle AFC, or
fourthirds the area of the inscribed triangle ABC.</p>
<p>Archimedes’ favorite theorem, the one represented on his tomb, was
also suggested to him by his mechanical method. It is described in
Proposition 2 of The Method:</p>
<p>Any segment of a sphere has to the cone with the same base and height
the ratio which the sum of the radius of the sphere and the height of
the complementary segment has to the height of the complementary
segment.</p>
<p>The theorem readily follows from a beautiful balancing property that
Archimedes discovered (and that can be easily verified in terms of
modern formulas). Let AQDCP be a cross-section of a sphere with center 0
and diameter AC (Fig. 6.11) and let AUV be a plane section of a right
circular cone with axis AC and UV as diameter of the base. Let IJUV be a
right circular cylinder with axis AC and with UV5IJ as diameter and let
AH5AC. If a plane is passed through any point S on the axis AC and
perpendicular to AC, the plane will cut the cone, the sphere, and the
cylinder in circles of radii r1 5SR, r2 5SP, and r3 5SN, respectively.
If we call the areas of these circles A1, A2, and A3, then, Archimedes
found, A1 and A2, when placed with their centers at H, will just balance
A3 where it now is, with A as the fulcrum. Hence, if we call the volumes
of the sphere, the cone, and the cylinder V1, V2, and V3, it follows
that V1 1V2 512V3, andbecauseV2 513V3; thespheremust be 16V3: Because
the volume V3 ofthe cylinder is known (from Democritus and Eudoxus), the
volume of the sphere is also known—in modern notation, V 5πr3. By
applying the same balancing technique to the spherical segment with base
diameter BD,</p>
<h4 id="the-method-2">The Method</h4>
<p>FIG. 6.11</p>
<p>to the cone with base diameter EF, and to the cylinder with base
diameter KL, the volume of the spherical segment is found in the same
manner as for the whole sphere.</p>
<p>The method of equilibrium of circular sections about a vertex as
fulcrum was applied by Archimedes to discover the volumes of the
segments of three solids of revolution—the ellipsoid, the paraboloid,
and the hyperboloid, as well as the centers of gravity of the paraboloid
(conoid), of any hemisphere, and of a semicircle. The Method closes with
the determination of volumes of two solids that are favorites in modern
calculus books—a wedge cut from a right circular cylinder by two planes
(as in Fig. 6.12) and the volume common to two equal right circular
cylinders intersecting at right angles.</p>
<p>The work that contained such marvelous results of more than 2,000
years ago was recovered almost by accident in 1906. The indefatigable
Danish scholar J. L. Heiberg had read that at Constantinople, there was
a palimpsest of mathematical content. (A palimpsest is a parchment the
original writing on which has been only imperfectly washed off and
replaced with a new and different text.) Close inspection showed him
that the original manuscript had contained something by Archimedes, and
through photographs, he was able to read most of the Archimedean text.
The manuscript consisted of 185 leaves, mostly of parchment but a few of
paper, with the Archimedean text copied in a tenth-century hand.</p>
<p>An attempt—fortunately, none too successful—had been made to expunge
this text in order to use the parchment for a Euchologion (a collection
of prayers and liturgies used in the Eastern Orthodox Church) written in
about the thirteenth century. The mathematical text contained On the
Sphere and Cylinder, most of the work On Spirals, part of Measurement of
the Circle and On the Equilibrium of Planes, and On Floating Bodies, all
of which have been preserved in other manuscripts; most important of
all, the palimpsest gives us the only surviving copy of The Method.</p>
<p>The palimpsest, lost after World War I, once again came to public
notice in the 1990s when it was put up for sale at auction. In 1999, the
anonymous purchaser deposited it at the Walters Art Gallery in
Baltimore, Maryland, and proceeded to fund intensive study of the
palimpsest by a group of specialists brought from the areas of
conservation, classical and medieval studies, and imaging techniques.
They have been able to capture most of the partially destroyed
Archimedean text, a task made difficult not only by the
thirteenth-century reuse of the parchment but by an additional
twentieth-century forgery that superimposed religious images over the
text. Twentieth-century technology that was used to assist in the
revelation of the original text included spectral imaging devices from
the Rochester Institute of Technology and the Johns Hopkins University,
among others, and even a synchrotron from the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center.</p>
<p>In a sense, the palimpsest is symbolic of the contributions of the
Middle Ages, as well as the Modern Age of Technology. Intense
preoccupation with religious concerns very nearly wiped out one of the
most important works of the greatest mathematician of antiquity, yet in
the end, it was medieval scholarship that inadvertently preserved this
and much besides, which might otherwise have been lost. Similarly,
modern technology, despite its potential for material destruction, has
enabled us to glimpse in detail what it is that was preserved.</p>
<h2 id="apollonius-of-perge">7 Apollonius of Perge</h2>
<p>He who understands Archimedes and Apollonius will admire less the
achievements of the foremost men of later times.</p>
<h4 id="leibniz">Leibniz</h4>
<p>Works andTradition</p>
<p>During the Hellenistic period, Alexandria remained the mathematical
focus of the Western world. Apollonius was born in Perge in Pamphylia
(southern Asia Minor), but he may have been educated in Alexandria, and
he seems to have spent some time teaching there. For a while, he was in
Pergamum, where there was a library second only to that in Alexandria.
Little is known about his life, and we do not know the precise dates of
his birth and death: the years 262 to 190 BCE have been suggested.</p>
<p>His most famous and influential work and only one of two that
survives is the treatise on Conics. The other, the Cutting-off of a
Ratio, was known only in Arabic until 1706, when Edmund Halley published
a Latin translation. It dealt with the various cases of a general
problem— given two straight lines and a point on each, draw through a
third given</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>point a straight line that cuts off on the given lines segments
(measured from the fixed points on them, respectively) that are in a
given ratio. This problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic equation
of the type ax2x2 5bc, that is, of applying to a line segment a
rectangle equal to a rectangle and falling short by a square.</p>
<p>What we know of his other, lost, works is based largely on the
summaries of the fourth-century commentator Pappus. Apollonius touched
on several themes that we discussed in the preceding chapter. For
example, he developed a scheme for expressing large numbers. The
numerical scheme of Apollonius was probably the one of which part is
described in the surviving last portion of Book II of the Mathematical
Collection of Pappus.</p>
<p>In a lost work titled Quick Delivery, Apollonius seems to have taught
speedy methods of calculation. In it, the author is said to have
calculated a closer approximation to π than that given by
Archimedes—probably the value we know as 3.1416. We have the titles of
many lost works. In some cases, we know what the treatise was about, for
Pappus gave brief descriptions of them. Six of the works of Apollonius
were included, together with a couple of Euclid’s more advanced
treatises (now lost), in a collection known as the “Treasury of
Analysis.” Pappus described this as a special body of doctrine for those
who, after going through the usual elements, wish to be capable of
solving problems involving curves.</p>
<h4 id="lost-works-1">Lost Works</h4>
<p>When in the seventeenth century the game of reconstructing lost
geometric books was at its height, the treatises of Apollonius were
among the favorites. From restorations of the one called Plane Loci, for
example, we infer that the following were two of the loci considered:
(1) the locus of points the difference of the squares of whose distances
from two fixed points is constant is a straight line perpendicular to
the line joining the points; (2) the locus of points the ratio of whose
distances from two fixed points is constant (and not equal to one) is a
circle. The latter locus is, in fact, now known as the “Circle of
Apollonius,” but this is a misnomer because it had been known to
Aristotle, who used it to give a mathematical justification of the
semicircular form of the rainbow.</p>
<p>In Cutting-off of an Area, the problem is similar to that considered
in the Cutting-off of a Ratio, except that the intercepted segments are
required to contain a given rectangle, rather than being in a given
ratio. This problem leads to a quadratic of the form ax1x2 5bc, so that
one has to apply to a segment a rectangle equal to a rectangle and
exceeding by a square.</p>
<p>The Apollonian treatise On Determinate Section dealt with what might
be called an analytic geometry of one dimension. It considered the
following</p>
<p>C yc le s and Epic yc le s</p>
<p>general problem, using the typical Greek algebraic analysis in
geometric form: Given four points A, B, C, D on a straight line,
determine a fifth point P on it such that the rectangle on AP and CP is
in a given ratio to the rectangle on BP and DP. Here, too, the problem
reduces easily to the solution of a quadratic, and, as in other cases,
Apollonius treated the question exhaustively, including the limits of
possibility and the number of solutions.</p>
<p>The treatise on Tangencies is of a different sort from the three
previously mentioned works, for, as Pappus describes it, we see the
problem familiarly known today as the “Problem of Apollonius.” Given
three things, each of which may be a point, a line, or a circle, draw a
circle that is tangent to each of the three given things (where tangency
to a point is to be understood to mean that the circle passes through
the point). This problem involves ten cases, from the two easiest (in
which the three things are three points or three lines) to the most
difficult of all (to draw a circle tangent to three circles). We do not
have the solutions of Apollonius, but they can be reconstructed on the
basis of information from Pappus. Nevertheless, scholars of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries generally were under the impression
that Apollonius had not solved the last case; hence, they regarded this
problem as a challenge to their abilities. Newton, in his Arithmetica
universalis, was among those who gave a solution, using straightedge and
compass alone.</p>
<p>Apollonius’s treatise on Vergings considered the class of neusis
problems that can be solved by “plane” methods—that is, by the use of a
compass and a straightedge only. (The Archimedean trisection, of course,
is not such a problem, for in modern times it has been proved that the
general angle cannot be trisected by “plane” methods.) According to
Pappus, one of the problems dealt with in Vergings is the insertion
within a given circle of a chord of given length verging to a given
point.</p>
<p>There were in antiquity allusions to still other works by Apollonius,
including one on Comparison of the Dodecahedron and the Icosahedron. In
this, the author gave a proof of the theorem (known perhaps to
Aristaeus) that the plane pentagonal faces of a dodecahedron are the
same distance from the center of the circumscribing sphere as are the
plane triangular faces of an icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere.
The main result in the spurious Book XIV of the Elements follows
immediately from the Apollonian proposition.</p>
<h4 id="cycles-and-epicycles">Cycles and Epicycles</h4>
<p>Apollonius was also a celebrated astronomer. Whereas Eudoxus had used
concentric spheres to represent the motions of the planets, according to
Ptolemy, Apollonius proposed instead two alternative systems, one made
up of epicyclic motions and the other involving eccentric motions. In
the</p>
<p>first scheme, a planet P was assumed to move uniformly about a small
circle (epicycle), the center C of which in turn moved uniformly along
the circumference of a larger circle (deferent) with its center at the
earth E (Fig. 7.1).</p>
<p>In the eccentric scheme, the planet P moves uniformly along the
circumference of a large circle, the center Cu of which in turn moves
uniformly in a small circle with its center at E. If PC5CuE, the two
geometric schemes will be equivalent, as Apollonius evidently knew.
Although the theory of homocentric spheres had become, through the work
of Aristotle, the favorite astronomical scheme of those satisfied by a
gross representation of the approximate motions, the theory of cycles
and epicycles, or of eccentrics, became, through the work of Ptolemy,
the choice of mathematical astronomers who wanted refinement of detail
and predictive precision. For some 1,800 years, the two schemes—the one
of Eudoxus and the other of Apollonius—were friendly rivals vying for
the favor of scholars.</p>
<h4 id="the-conics">The Conics</h4>
<p>Of the chefs d’oeuvre of Apollonius, the Conics, only half—the first
four of the original eight books—remains extant in Greek. Fortunately,
in the ninth century Thabit ibn Qurra translated the next three books
into Arabic, and this version has survived. In 1710, Halley provided a
Latin translation of the seven books, and editions in many languages
have appeared since then.</p>
<p>The conic sections had been known for about a century and a half when
Apollonius composed his celebrated treatise on these curves. At least
twice in the interval, general surveys had been written—by Aristaeus and
by Euclid—but just as Euclid’s Elements had displaced earlier elementary
textbooks, so on the more advanced level of the conic sections the
Conics of Apollonius superseded all rivals in its field, including the
Conics of Euclid.</p>
<p>Before the time of Apollonius, the ellipse, the parabola, and the
hyperbola were derived as sections of three distinctly different types
of</p>
<p>right circular cones, according as the vertex angle was acute, right,
or obtuse. Apollonius, apparently for the first time, systematically
showed that it is not necessary to take sections perpendicular to an
element of the cone and that from a single cone one can obtain all three
varieties of conic sections simply by varying the inclination of the
cutting plane. This was an important step in linking the three types of
curve. A second important generalization was made when Apollonius
demonstrated that the cone need not be a right cone—that is, one whose
axis is perpendicular to the circular base—but can equally well be an
oblique or scalene circular cone. If Eutocius, in commenting on the
Conics, was well informed, we can infer that Apollonius was the first
geometer to show that the properties of the curves are not different
according as they are cut from oblique cones or from right cones.
Finally, Apollonius brought the ancient curves closer to the modern
point of view by replacing the single-napped cone (somewhat like a
modern ice-cream cone) by a double-napped cone (resembling two
oppositely oriented, indefinitely long ice-cream cones placed so that
the vertices coincide and the axes are in a straight line). Apollonius
gave, in fact, the same definition of a circular cone as that used
today:</p>
<p>If a straight line indefinite in length and passing always through a
fixed point be made to move around the circumference of a circle which
is not in the same plane with the point so as to pass successively
through every point of that circumference, the moving straight line will
trace out the surface of a double cone.</p>
<p>This change made the hyperbola the double-branched curve that is
familiar to us today. Geometers often referred to the “two hyperbolas,”
rather than to the “two branches” of a single hyperbola, but in either
case, the duality of the curve was recognized.</p>
<p>Concepts are more important in the history of mathematics than is
terminology, but there is more than ordinary significance in a change of
name for the conic sections that was due to Apollonius. For about a
century and a half, the curves had had no more distinctive appellations
than banal descriptions of the manner in which the curves had been
discovered—sections of an acute-angled cone (oxytome), sections of a
right-angled cone (orthotome), and sections of an obtuse-angled cone
(amblytome). Archimedes had continued using these names (although he is
reported to have also used the word “parabola” as a synonym for a
section of a right-angled cone). It was Apollonius (possibly following
up a suggestion of Archimedes) who introduced the names “ellipse” and
“hyperbola” in connection with these curves. The words “ellipse,”
“parabola,” and “hyperbola” were not newly coined for the occasion; they
were adapted from an earlier use, perhaps by the Pythagoreans, in the
solution of quadratic equations through the application of areas.
“Ellipsis” (meaning a deficiency) had been used when a rectangle of a
given area was applied to a given line segment and fell short by a
square (or other specified figure), and the word “hyperbola” (a throwing
beyond) had been adopted when the area exceeded the line segment. The
word “parabola” (a placing beside, or comparison) had indicated neither
excess nor deficiency. Apollonius now applied these words in a new
context as names for the conic sections. The familiar modern equation of
the parabola with vertex at the origin is y2 5lx (where l is the “latus
rectum,” or parameter, now often represented by 2p, or occasionally by
4p). That is, the parabola has the property that no matter what point on
the curve one chooses, the square on the ordinate is precisely equal to
the rectangle on the abscissa x and the parameter l. The equations of
the ellipse and the hyperbola, similarly referred to a vertex as origin,
are ðx7aÞ2=a2 6y2=b2 51, or2 y2 5lx7b2x2=a2 (where l again is the latus2
rectum, or parameter, 2b /a). That is, for the ellipse y ,lx and for the
hyperbola y2 .lx, and it is the properties of the curves that are
represented by these inequalities that prompted the names given by
Apollonius more than two millennia ago, names that are still firmly
attached to them. The commentator Eutocius was responsible for an
erroneous impression, still fairly widespread, that the words “ellipse,”
“parabola,” and “hyperbola” were adopted by Apollonius to indicate that
the cutting plane fell short of or ran along with or ran into the second
nappe of the cone. This is not at all what Apollonius reported in the
Conics.</p>
<p>In deriving all conic sections from a single double-napped oblique
circular cone and in giving them eminently appropriate names, Apollonius
made an important contribution to geometry, but he failed to go as far
in generality as he might have. He could as well have begun with an
elliptic cone—or with any quadric cone—and still have derived the same
curves. That is, any plane section of Apollonius’s “circular” cone could
have served as the generating curve or “base” in his definition, and the
designation “circular cone” is unnecessary. In fact, as Apollonius
himself showed (Book I, Proposition 5), every oblique circular cone has
not only an infinite number of circular sections parallel to the base,
but also another infinite set of circular sections given by what he
called subcontrary sections. Let BFC be the base of the oblique circular
cone and let ABC be a triangular section of the cone (Fig. 7.2). Let P
be any point on a circular section DPE parallel to BFC and let HPK be a
section by a plane such that triangles AHK and ABC are similar but
oppositely oriented. Apollonius then called the section HPK a
subcontrary section and showed that it is a circle. The proof is easily
established in terms of the similarity of triangles HMD and EMK, from
which it follows that HMMK5DMME5PM2, the characteristic property of a
circle. (In the language of analytic geometry, if we let HM5x, HK5a, and
PM5y, then y2 5x(a x) or x2 1y2 5ax, which is the equation of a
circle.)</p>
<p>Fundamental Properties</p>
<p>Greek geometers divided curves into three categories. The first,
known as “plane loci,” consisted of all straight lines and circles; the
second, known as “solid loci,” was made up of all conic sections; the
third category, known as “linear loci,” lumped together all other
curves. The name applied to the second category was undoubtedly
suggested by the fact that the conics were not defined as loci in a
plane that satisfy a certain condition, as is done today; they were
described stereometrically as sections of a three-dimensional figure.
Apollonius, like his predecessors, derived his curves from a cone in
three-dimensional space, but he dispensed with the cone as promptly as
possible. From the cone, he derived a fundamental plane property or
“symptome” for the section, and thereafter he proceeded with a purely
planimetric study based on this property. This step, which we here
illustrate for the ellipse (Book I, Proposition 13), probably was much
the same as that used by his predecessors, including Menaechmus. Let ABC
be a triangular section of an oblique circular cone (Fig. 7.3), and let
P be any point on a section HPK cutting all elements of the cone. Extend
HK to meet BC in G and through P pass a horizontal plane, cutting the
cone in the circle DPE and the plane HPK in the line PM. Draw DME, a
diameter of the circle perpendicular to PM. Then, from the similarity of
triangles HDM and HBG we have DM/HM5BG/HC, and from the similarity of
triangles MEK and KCG we have ME/MK5CG/KG. Now, from the property of the
circle we have PM2 5DMME; hence, PM2 5(HMBG/HG) (MKCG)/KG. If PM5y,
HM5x, and HK52a2, the property in the preceding sentence is equivalent
to the equation y 5kx(2a2x), which we recognize as the equation of an
ellipse with H as vertex and HK as</p>
<p>FIG. 7.3</p>
<p>major axis. In a similar manner, Apollonius derived for the hyperbola
the equivalent of the equation y2 5kx(x12a). These forms are easily
reconciled with the previously mentioned “name” forms by taking k5b2 /a2
and l52b2 /a.</p>
<p>Conjugate Diameters</p>
<p>After Apollonius had derived from a stereometric consideration of the
cone the basic relationship between what we should now call the plane
coordinatesofapointonthecurve—givenbythethree equationsy2 5lx2 b2x2 /a2,
y2 5lx, and y2 5lx1b2x2 /a—he derived further properties from the plane
equations without reference to the cone. The author of the Conics
reported that in Book I he had worked out the fundamental properties of
the curves “more fully and generally than in the writings of other
authors.” The extent to which this statement holds true is suggested by
the fact that here, in the very first book, the theory of conjugate
diameters of a conic is developed. That is, Apollonius showed that the
midpoints of a set of chords parallel to one diameter of an ellipse or a
hyperbola will constitute a second diameter, the two being called
“conjugate diameters.” In fact, whereas today we invariably refer a
conic to a pair of mutually perpendicular lines as axes, Apollonius
generally used a pair of conjugate diameters as equivalents of oblique
coordinate axes. The system of conjugate diameters provided an
exceptionally useful frame of reference for a conic, for Apollonius
showed that if a line is drawn through an extremity of one diameter of
an ellipse or a hyperbola parallel to the conjugate diameter, the line
“will touch the conic, and no other straight line can fall between it
and the conic”—that is, the line will be tangent to the conic. Here we
see clearly the Greek static concept of a tangent to a curve, in
contrast to the Archimedean kinematic view. In fact, often in the Conics
we find a diameter and a tangent at its extremity used as a coordinate
frame of reference.</p>
<p>Among the theorems in Book I are several (Propositions 41 through 49)
that are tantamount to a transformation of coordinates from a system
based on the tangent and the diameter through a point P on the conic to
a new system determined by a tangent and a diameter at a second point Q
on the same curve, together with the demonstration that a conic can be
referred to as any such system as axes. In particular, Apollonius was
familiar with the properties of the hyperbola and referred to its
asymptotes as axes, given, for the equilateral hyperbola, by the
equation xy5c2. He had no way of knowing, of course, that someday this
relationship would be fundamental in the study of gases or that his
study of the ellipse would be essential to modern astronomy.</p>
<p>Book II continues the study of conjugate diameters and tangents. For
example, if P is any point on any hyperbola, with center C, the tangent
at P will cut the asymptotes in points L and Lu (Fig. 7.4) that are
equidistant from P (Propositions 8 and 10). Moreover (Propositions 11
and 16), any chord QQu parallel to CP will meet the asymptotes in points
K and Ku such that QK5QuKu and QKQK5CP2. (These properties were verified
synthetically, but the reader can double-check their validity by the use
of modern analytic methods.) Later propositions in Book II show how to
draw tangents to a conic by making use of the theory of harmonic
division. In the case of the ellipse (Proposition 49), for example, if Q
is a point on the curve (Fig. 7.5), Apollonius dropped a perpendicular
QN from Q to the axis AAu and found the harmonic conjugate T of N with
respect to A and Au. (That is, he found the point T on line AAu extended
such that AT/AuT5AN/NAu; in other words, he determined the point T that
divides the segment AAu externally in the same ratio as N divides AAu
internally.) The line through T and Q, then, will be tangent to the
ellipse. The case in which Q does not lie on the curve can be reduced to
this through familiar properties of harmonic division. (It can be proved
that there are no plane curves other than the conic sections such that
given the curve and a point, a tangent can be drawn, with
straightedge</p>
<p>Q</p>
<p>T A’</p>
<p>FIG. 7.5</p>
<p>and compass, from the point to the curve, but this was, of course,
unknown to Apollonius.)</p>
<p>The Three- and Four-Line Locus</p>
<p>Apollonius was apparently especially proud of Book III, for in the
general preface to the Conics he wrote:</p>
<p>The third book contains many remarkable theorems useful for the
synthesis of solid loci and determinations of limits; the most and
prettiest of these theorems are new and, when I had discovered them, I
observed that Euclid had not worked out the synthesis of the locus with
respect to three and four lines, but only a chance portion of it and
that not successfully: for it was not possible that the synthesis could
have been completed without my additional discoveries.</p>
<p>The three- and four-line locus to which reference is made played an
important role in mathematics from Euclid to Newton. Given three lines
(or four lines) in a plane, find the locus of a point P that moves so
that the square of the distance from P to one of these is proportional
to the product of the distances to the other two (or, in the case of
four lines, the product of the distances to two of them is proportional
to the product of the distances to the other two), the distances being
measured at given angles with respect to the lines. Through modern
analytic methods, including the normal form of the straight line, it is
easy to show that the locus is a conic section—real or imaginary,
reducible or irreducible. If, for the three-line locus, equations of the
given lines are A1x1B1y1 C1 50, A2x1B2y1C2 50, and A3x1B3y1C3 50, and if
the angles at which the distances are to be measured are θ1, θ2, and θ3,
then the locus of</p>
<p>P(x, y) is given by</p>
<p>ðA1x2 1B21y1C2 1Þ2 KðA2x1B2y1C2Þ ðA3x1B3y1C3Þ</p>
<p>5 U :</p>
<p>ðA1 1B1Þ sin θ1 pA22 1B22 sin θ2 pA23B23 sin θ3</p>
<p>This equation is, in general, of second degree in x and y; hence, the
locus is a conic section. Our solution does not do justice to the
treatment given by Apollonius in Book III, in which more than fifty
carefully worded propositions, all proved by synthetic methods, lead
eventually to the required locus. Half a millennium later, Pappus
suggested a generalization of this theorem for n lines, where n.4, and
it was against this generalized problem that Descartes in 1637 tested
his analytic geometry. Thus, few problems have played as important a
role in the history of mathematics as did the “locus to three and four
lines.”</p>
<p>Intersecting Conics</p>
<p>Book IV of the Conics is described by its author as showing “in how
many ways the sections of cones meet one another,” and he is especially
proud of theorems, “none of which has been discussed by earlier
writers,” concerning the number of points in which a section of a cone
meets the “opposite branches of a hyperbola.” The idea of the hyperbola
as a double-branched curve was new with Apollonius, and he thoroughly
enjoyed the discovery and the proof of theorems concerning it. It is in
connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a
statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded
opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the
usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted, “They are
worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in
the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and
for no other reason” (Heath 1961, p. lxxiv).</p>
<p>Books V VII</p>
<p>The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines
drawn to a conic, again argues that “the subject is one of those which
seem worthy of study for their own sake.” Although one must admire the
author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently
pointed out that what in his day was beautiful theory, with no prospect
of applicability to the science or the engineering of his time, has
since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and
celestial mechanics. Apollonius’s theorems on maxima and minima are in
reality theorems on tangents and normals to conic sections. Without
knowledge of the properties of tangents to a parabola, an analysis of
local trajectories would be impossible, and a study of the paths of the
planets is unthinkable without reference to the tangents to an ellipse.
It is clear, in other words, that it was the pure mathematics of
Apollonius that made possible, some 1,800 years later, the Principia of
Newton; the latter, in turn, gave scientists of the 1960s the hope that
a round-trip visit to the moon would be possible. Even in ancient
Greece, the Apollonian theorem that every oblique cone has two families
of circular sections was applicable to cartography in the stereographic
transformation, used by Ptolemy and possibly by Hipparchus, of a
spherical region into a portion of a plane. It has often been true in
the development of mathematics that topics that originally could be
justified only as “worthy of study for their own sake” later became of
inestimable value to the “practical man.”</p>
<p>Greek mathematicians had no satisfactory definition of tangent to a
curve C at a point P, thinking of it as a line L such that no other line
could be drawn through P between C and L. Perhaps it was dissatisfaction
with this definition that led Apollonius to avoid defining a normal to a
curve C from a point Q as a line through Q that cuts the curve C in a
point P and is perpendicular to the tangent to C at P. Instead, he made
use of the fact that the normal from Q to C is a line such that the
distance from Q to C is a relative maximum or minimum. In Conics V.8,
for example, Apollonius proved a theorem concerning the normal to a
parabola, which today is generally part of a course in the calculus. In
modern terminology, the theorem states that the subnormal of the
parabola y2 52px for any point P on the curve is constant and equal to
p; in the language of Apollonius, this property is expressed somewhat as
follows:</p>
<p>If A is the vertex of a parabola y2 5px, and if G is a point on the
axis such that AG.p, and, if N is a point between A and G such that NG
5p, and if NP is drawn perpendicular to the axis meeting the parabola in
P 〔Fig. 7.6〕, then PG is the minimum straight line from G to the curve
and hence is normal to the parabola at P.</p>
<p>The proof by Apollonius is ofthe typicalindirectkind—it is shownthat
if Pu isany other point on the parabola, PuG increases asPu moves
further from P in either direction. A proof of the corresponding, but
more involved, theorem concerning the normal to an ellipse or a
hyperbola from a point on the axis is then given, and it is shown that
if P is a point on a conic, only one normal can be drawn through P,
whether the normal be regarded as a minimum or a maximum, and this
normal is perpendicular to the tangent at
P.Notethattheperpendicularitythatwetakeasadefinitionishereprovedas a
theorem, whereas the maximum-minimum property that we take as a</p>
<p>theoremserves,forApollonius,asadefinition.LaterpropositionsinBookV
carry the topic of normals to a conic to such a point that the author
gives criteria enabling one to tell how many normals can be drawn from a
given point to a conic section. These criteria are tantamount to what we
should describe as theequations of theevolutesto theconics. Forthe

is, points on this cubic are the centers of curvature for points on the
conic (in other words, the centers of osculating circles for the
parabola). In the case of the ellipse and the hyperbola, whose equations
are, respectively, x2 /a2 6 y2 /b2 51, the corresponding equations of
the evolute are ðaxÞ2=3 6 ðbyÞ2=3 5ða2 7 b2Þ2=3.</p>
<p>After giving the conditions for the evolute of a conic, Apollonius
showed howtoconstructanormaltoaconicsectionfromapointQ.Inthecaseofthe
parabola y2 52px, and for Q outside the parabola and not on the axis,
one drops a perpendicular QM to the axis AK, measures off MH5p, and
erects HR perpendicular to HA (Fig. 7.7). Then, through Q one draws the
rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes HA and HR, intersecting the
parabola in a point P. Line QP is the normal required, as one can prove
by showing that NK5HM5p. If point Q lies inside the parabola, the
construction is similar, except that P lies between Q and R. Apollonius
also gave constructions, likewise making use of an auxiliary hyperbola,
for the normal from a point to a given ellipse or hyperbola. It should
be noted that the construction of normals to the ellipse and the
hyperbola, unlike the construction of tangents, requires more than a
straightedge and a compass. As the ancients described the two problems,
the drawing of a tangent to a conic is a “plane problem,” for
intersecting circles and straight lines suffice. By contrast, the
drawing of a normal from an arbitrary point in the plane to a given
central conic is a “solid problem,” for it cannot be accomplished by the
use of lines and circles alone but can be done through the use of solid
loci (in our case, a hyperbola). Pappus later severely criticized
Apollonius for his construction of a normal to the</p>
<p>parabola, in that he treated it as a solid problem, rather than a
plane problem. That is, the hyperbola that Apollonius used could have
been replaced by a circle. Perhaps Apollonius felt that the
line-and-circle fetish should give way, in his construction of normals,
to a desire for uniformity of approach with respect to the three types
of conics.</p>
<p>Apollonius described the sixth book of the Conics as embracing
propositions about “segments of conics equal and unequal, similar and
dissimilar, besides some other matters left out by those who have
preceded me. In particular, you will find in this book how, in a given
right cone, a section is to be cut equal to a given section.” Two conics
are said to be similar if the ordinates, when drawn to the axis at
proportional distances from the vertex, are respectively proportional to
the corresponding abscissas. Among the easier of the propositions in
Book VI are those demonstrating that all parabolas are similar (VI.11)
and that a parabola cannot be similar to an ellipse or a hyperbola nor
an ellipse to a hyperbola (VI.14, 15). Other propositions (VI.26, 27)
prove that if any cone is cut by two parallel planes making hyperbolic
or elliptic sections, the sections will be similar but not equal.</p>
<p>Book VII returns to the subject of conjugate diameters and “many new
propositions concerning diameters of sections and the figures described
upon them.” Among these are some that are found in modern textbooks,
such as the proof (VII.12, 13, 29, 30) that</p>
<p>In every ellipse the sum, and in every hyperbola the difference, of
the squares on any two conjugate diameters is equal to the sum or
difference respectively of the squares on the axes.</p>
<p>There is also the proof of the familiar theorem that if tangents are
drawn at the extremities of a pair of conjugate axes of an ellipse or a
hyperbola, the parallelogram formed by these four tangents will be equal
to the rectangle on the axes. It has been conjectured that the lost Book
VIII of the Conics continued with similar problems, for in the preface
to Book VII the author wrote that the theorems of Book VII were used in
Book VIII to solve determinate conic problems, so that the last book “is
by way of an appendix.”</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<p>The Conics of Apollonius is a treatise of such extraordinary breadth
and depth that we are startled to note the omission of some of the
properties that to us appear so obviously fundamental. As the curves are
now introduced in textbooks, the foci play a prominent role, yet
Apollonius had no name for these points, and he referred to them only
indirectly. It is not clear whether the author was aware of the
now-familiar role of the directrix. He seems to have known how to
determine a conic through five points, but this topic is omitted in the
Conics. It is quite possible, of course, that some or all such
tantalizing omissions resulted from the fact that they had been treated
elsewhere, in works no longer extant, by Apollonius or other authors. So
much of ancient mathematics has been lost that an argument e silencio is
precarious indeed.</p>
<p>Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes;
moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed a
posteriori on a given curve in order to study its properties. Of Greek
geometry, we may say that equations are determined by curves, but not
that curves were defined by equations. Coordinates, variables, and
equations were subsidiary notions derived from a specific geometric
situation, and one gathers that in the Greek view, it was not sufficient
to define curves abstractly as loci satisfying given conditions on two
coordinates. To guarantee that a locus was really a curve, the ancients
felt it incumbent on them to exhibit it stereometrically as a section of
a solid or to describe a kinematic mode of construction.</p>
<p>TheGreekdefinitionandstudyofcurveslackedtheflexibilityandextent of
the modern treatment. Although the Greeks were esthetically one of the
most gifted peoples of all times, the only curves that they explored in
the heavens and on the earth were combinations of circles and straight
lines.ThatApollonius,thegreatestgeometerofantiquity,failedtodevelop
analytic geometry, was probably the result of a poverty of curves,
rather than of thought. Moreover, the early modern inventors of analytic
geometry had all of Renaissance algebra at their disposal, whereas
Apollonius necessarily worked with the more rigorous but far more
awkward tool of geometric algebra.</p>

<p>ChangingTrends</p>
<p>Today, we use the conventional phrase “Greek mathematics” as if it
indicates a homogeneous and well-defined body of doctrine. Such a view
can be very misleading, however, for it implies that the sophisticated
geometry of the Archimedean-Apollonian type was the only sort that the
Hellenes knew. We must remember that mathematics in the Greek world
spanned a time interval from at least 600 BCE to at least 600 CE and
that it traveled from Ionia to the toe of Italy, to Athens, to
Alexandria, and to other parts of the civilized world. The paucity of
surviving works, especially on the lower level, tends to obscure the
fact that our knowledge about the Greek world is far from complete.</p>
<p>The death of Archimedes by the hand of a Roman soldier may have been
inadvertent, but it was truly portentous. Both Perge and Syracuse</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>Erat o s t hene s</p>
<p>would flourish under Roman control, but during its long history,
ancient Rome contributed little to science or philosophy and less to
mathematics. Whether during the Republic or in the days of the Empire,
Romans were little attracted to speculative or logical investigation.
The practical arts of medicine and agriculture were cultivated with some
eagerness, and descriptive geography met with favor. Impressive
engineering projects and architectural monuments were related to the
simpler aspects of science, but Roman builders were satisfied with
elementary rule-of-thumb procedures that called for little in the way of
understanding of the great corpus of theoretical Greek thought. The
extent of Roman acquaintance with science may be judged from the De
architectura of Vitruvius, written during the middle part of the
Augustine Age and dedicated to the emperor. At one point, the author
describes what to him appeared to be the three greatest mathematical
discoveries: the incommensurability of the side and the diagonal of a
cube; the right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5; and Archimedes’
calculation on the composition of the king’s crown. It is sometimes
claimed that impressive works of engineering, such as the Egyptian
pyramids and the Roman aqueducts, imply a high level of mathematical
achievement, but historical evidence does not bear this out.</p>
<p>The two major institutions associated with mathematics in ancient
Greece, the Academy in Athens and the Library in Alexandria, were
subject to several changes in direction before their eventual demise.
The Academy no longer maintained the strong support of mathematical
studies that Plato had made mandatory; by the time of Proclus, a renewed
interest in mathematics can be attributed to its role as safe haven for
Neoplatonists. The Museum and Library at Alexandria no longer benefited
from the support they had been given by the first two Ptolemies, and
even Cleopatra, the last ruling Ptolemy, who is said to have enjoyed the
Museum gatherings, probably could not have persuaded either Antony or
Caesar to fund its scholarly pursuits.</p>
<h4 id="eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</h4>
<p>When Archimedes sent his Method to Eratosthenes in Alexandria, he
chose as recipient a man who represented the many diverse areas of study
at the Alexandrian library. Eratosthenes (ca. 275 194 BCE) was a native
of Cyrene who had spent much of his early life in Athens. He had
achieved prominence in many fields—poetry, astronomy, history,
mathematics, athletics—when, in middle life, he was called by Ptolemy
III to Alexandria to tutor his son and to serve as head of the library
there.</p>
<p>Today, Eratosthenes is best remembered for his measurement of the
earth—not the first or last such estimate made in antiquity, but by all
odds the most successful. Eratosthenes observed that at noon on the
day</p>
<p>of the summer solstice, the sun shone directly down a deep well at
Syene. At the same time in Alexandria, taken to be on the same meridian
and 5,000 stades north of Syene, the sun was found to cast a shadow
indicating that the sun’s angular distance from the zenith was
one-fiftieth of a circle. From the equality of the corresponding angles
SuAZ and SvOZ in Fig. 8.1, it is clear that the circumference of the
earth must be fifty times the distance between Syene and Alexandria.
This results in a perimeter of 250,000 stades. How accurate this
measurement was has been a subject of debate among scholars, partly
because there are differing accounts concerning the length of a stadium.
There is consensus, however, that the result of the measurement was a
remarkable achievement.</p>
<p>A contributor to many fields of learning, Eratosthenes is well known
in mathematics for the “sieve of Eratosthenes,” a systematic procedure
for isolating the prime numbers. With all of the natural numbers
arranged in order, one simply strikes out every second number following
the number 2, every third number (in the original sequence) following
the number 3, every fifth number following the number 5, and continues
in this manner to strike out every nth number following the number
n. The remaining numbers, from 2 on, will, of course, be primes.
Eratosthenes also wrote works on means and on loci, but these have been
lost. Even his treatise On the Measurement of the Earth is no longer
extant, although some details from it have been preserved by others,
including Heron and Ptolemy of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Angles and Chords</p>
<p>Like Eratosthenes, in his work on mathematical geography, a number of
astronomers of the Alexandrian Age handled problems that pointed to a
need for systematic relationships between angles and chords.
Theorems</p>
<p>A ngle s and C hor d s</p>
<p>on the lengths of chords are essentially applications of the modern
law of sines.</p>
<p>Aristarchus</p>
<p>Among Eratosthenes’ predecessors was Aristarchus of Samos (ca. 310
ca. 230 BCE), who, according to Archimedes and Plutarch, proposed a
heliocentric system; but whatever he may have written on this scheme has
been lost. Instead, we have an Aristarchan treatise, perhaps composed
earlier (ca. 260 BCE), On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon,
which assumes a geocentric universe. In this work, Aristarchus made the
observation that when the moon is just half-full, the angle between the
lines of sight to the sun and the moon is less than a right angle by
one-thirtieth of a quadrant. (The systematic introduction of the 360
circle came a little later.) In trigonometric language of today, this
would mean that the ratio of the distance of the moon to that of the sun
(the ratio ME to SE in Fig. 8.2) is sin 3. Trigonometric tables not
having been developed yet, Aristarchus fell back on a well-known
geometric theorem of the time that now would be expressed in the
inequalities sinα/sinβ, α, β, tanα/tanβ, where 0, β, α, 90. From these,
he derived the conclusion that ,sin3,; hence, he asserted that the sun
is more than 18, but less than 20, times as far from the earth as is the
moon. This is far from the modern value—somewhat less than 400—but it is
better than the values 9 and 12 that Archimedes ascribed, respectively,
to Eudoxus and to Phidias (Archimedes’ father). Moreover, the method
used by Aristarchus was unimpeachable, the result being vitiated only by
the error of observation in measuring the angle MES as 87 (when in
actuality it should have been about 89 50u).</p>
<p>Having determined the relative distances of the sun and the moon,
Aristarchus also knew that the sizes of the sun and the moon were in the
same ratio. This follows from the fact that the sun and the moon have
very nearly the same apparent size—that is, they subtend about the same
angle at the eye of an observer on the earth. In the treatise in
question, this angle is given as 2, but Archimedes attributed to
Aristarchus the much better value of . From this ratio, Aristarchus was
able</p>
<p>M</p>
<p>S</p>
<p>E</p>
<p>FIG. 8.2</p>
<p>to find an approximation for the sizes of the sun and the moon, as
compared with the size of the earth. From lunar eclipse observations, he
concluded that the breadth of the shadow cast by the earth at the
distance of the moon was twice the width of the moon. Then, if Rs, Re,
and Rm are the radii of the sun, the earth, and the moon, respectively,
and if Ds and Dm are the distances of the sun and the moon from the
earth, then, from the similarity of triangles BCD and ABE (Fig. 8.3),
one has the proportion (Re 22Rm)/(Rs 2Re)5Dm /Ds. If in this equation
one replaces Ds and Rs with the approximate values 19Dm and 19Rm, one
obtains the equation ðRe 22RmÞ=ð19Rm 2ReÞ5 or Rm 52057Re. Here the
actual computations of Aristarchus have been considerably simplified.
His reasoning was in reality much more carefully carried out and led to
the conclusion that</p>

<p>Hipparchus of Nicaea</p>
<p>For some two and a half centuries, from Hippocrates to Eratosthenes,
Greek mathematicians had studied relationships between lines and circles
and had applied these in a variety of astronomical problems, but no
systematic trigonometry had resulted. Then, presumably during the second
half of the second century, the first trigonometric table apparently was
compiled by the astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea (ca. 180 ca. 125 BCE).
Aristarchus had known that in a given circle, the ratio of arc to chord
decreasedastheangledecreasesfrom180 to0,tendingtowardalimitof1. Yet it
appears that not until Hipparchus undertook the task had anyone
tabulated corresponding values of arc and chord for a whole series of
angles. It has, however, been suggested that Apollonius may have
anticipated Hipparchus in this respect, and that the contribution of the
latter to trigonometry was simply the calculation of a better set of
chords than had been drawn up by his predecessors. Hipparchus evidently
drew up his tables for use in his astronomy. He was a transitional</p>
<p>A ngle s and C hor d s</p>
<p>figure between Babylonian astronomy and the work of Ptolemy. The
chief contributions attributed to Hipparchus in astronomy were his
organization of the empirical data derived from the Babylonians, the
drawing up of a star catalogue, improvement in important astronomical
constants (such as the length of the month and the year, the size of the
moon, and the angle of obliquity of the ecliptic), and, finally, the
discovery of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
<p>It is not known just when the systematic use of the 360 circle came
into mathematics, but it seems to be due largely to Hipparchus in
connection with his table of chords. It is possible that he took over
from Hypsicles, who earlier had divided the order into 360 parts, a
subdivision that may have been suggested by Babylonian astronomy. Just
how Hipparchus made up his table is not known, for his works are not
extant (except for a commentary on a popular astronomical poem by
Aratus). It is likely that his methods were similar to those of Ptolemy,
to be described further on, for Theon of Alexandria, commenting on
Ptolemy’s table of chords in the fourth century, reported that
Hipparchus had earlier written a treatise in twelve books on chords in a
circle.</p>
<p>Menelaus of Alexandria</p>
<p>Theon also mentions another treatise, in six books, by Menelaus of
Alexandria (ca. 100 CE) dealing with Chords in a Circle. Other
mathematical and astronomical works by Menelaus are mentioned by later
Greek and Arabic commentators, including an Elements of Geometry, but
the only one that has survived—and only through the Arabic translation—
is his Sphaerica. In Book I of this treatise, Menelausestablished a
basis for spherical triangles analogous to that of Euclid I for plane
triangles. Included is a theorem without Euclidean analogue—that two
spherical triangles are congruent if corresponding angles are equal
(Menelaus did notdistinguishbetweencongruentandsymmetricspherical
triangles),and the theorem A1B1C.180 is established. The second book of
the</p>
<p>Sphaerica describes the application of spherical geometry to
astronomical phenomena and is of little mathematical interest. Book III,
the last, contains the well-known “theorem of Menelaus” as part of what
is essentially spherical trigonometry in the typical Greek form—a
geometry or
trigonometryofchordsinacircle.InthecircleinFig.8.4,weshouldwritethatchord
ABistwicethesineofhalfofthecentralangleAOB(multipliedbytheradius of the
circle). Menelaus and his Greek successors instead referred to AB
simplyasthechordcorrespondingtothearc AB.IfBOBu isadiameterofthe circle,
then chord ABu is twice the cosine of half the angle AOB (multiplied by
the radius of the circle). Hence, the theorems of Thales and Pythagoras,
which lead to the equation AB2 1ABu2 24r2, are equivalent to the modern
trigonometric identity sin2 θ1cos2 θ51. Menelaus, as Hipparchus
probably</p>
<p>also before him, was familiar with other identities, two of which he
used as lemmas in proving his theorem on transversals. The first of
these lemmas

becausetheycouldbefoundinearlierworks,possiblyinHipparchus’stwelve books
on chords. (The reader can easily prove the lemmas by drawing AO and BO,
dropping perpendiculars from A and B to OD, and using similar
triangles.)</p>
<p>It is probable that the “theorem of Menelaus” for the case of plane
triangles had been known to Euclid, perhaps having appeared in the lost
Porisms. The theorem in the plane states that if the sides AB, BC, CA of
a triangle are cut by a transversal in points D, E, F, respectively
(Fig. 8.6),</p>
<p>B</p>
<p>FIG. 8.6</p>
<p>then ADBECF5BDCEAF. In other words, any line cuts the sides of a
triangle so that the product of three nonadjacent segments equals the
product of the other three, as can readily be proved by elementary
geometry or through the application of simple trigonometric
relationships. The theorem was assumed by Menelaus to be well known to
his contemporaries, but he went on to extend it to spherical triangles
in a form equivalent to sinAD sinBE sinCF5sinBD sinCE sinAF. If sensed
segments are used, rather than absolute magnitudes, the two products are
equal in magnitude but differ in sign.</p>
<h4 id="ptolemys-almagest">Ptolemy’s Almagest</h4>
<p>By far the most influential and significant trigonometric work of all
antiquity was the Mathematical Syntaxis, a work in thirteen books
composed by Ptolemy of Alexandria about half a century after Menelaus.
This celebrated Mathematical Synthesis was distinguished from another
group of astronomical treatises by other authors (including Aristarchus)
by referring to that of Ptolemy as the “greater” collection and to that
of Aristarchus et al. as the “lesser” collection.</p>
<p>From the frequent reference to the former as megiste, there arose
later in Arabia the custom of calling Ptolemy’s book Almagest (“the
greatest”), and it is by this name that the work has since been
known.</p>
<p>Of the life of its author, we are as little informed as we are of
that of the author of the Elements. We know that Ptolemy made
observations in Alexandria from 127 to 151 CE, and we therefore assume
that he was born at the end of the first century. Suidas, a writer who
lived in the tenth century, reported that Ptolemy was still alive under
Marcus Aurelius (the emperor from 161 to 180 CE).</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s Almagest is presumed to be heavily indebted for its methods
to the Chords in a Circle of Hipparchus. Ptolemy made use of the
catalogue of star positions bequeathed by Hipparchus, but whether
Ptolemy’s trigonometric tables were derived in large part from his
distinguished predecessor cannot be determined. Fortunately, Ptolemy’s
Almagest has survived the ravages of time; hence, we have not only his
trigonometric tables but also an account of the methods used in their
construction. Central to the calculation of Ptolemy’s chords was a
geometric proposition still known as “Ptolemy’s theorem”: If ABCD is a
(convex) quadrilateral inscribed in a circle (Fig. 8.7), then
ABCD1BCDA5ACBD; that is, the sum of the products of the opposite sides
of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the product of the diagonals. The
proof of this is easily carried through by drawing BE so that angle ABE
is equal to angle DBC and noting the similarity of the triangles ABE and
BCD.</p>
<p>Another, and more useful, special case of the general theorem of
Ptolemy is that in which one side—say, AD—is a diameter of the circle
(Fig. 8.8). Then, if AD52r, we have 2rBC1ABCD5ACBD. If we let arcBD52α
and arc CD52β, then BC52r sin(α2β), AB52r sin(90 2α), BD52rsinα,
CD52rsinβ, and AC52rsin(90 2β). Ptolemy’s theorem therefore leads to the
result sin(α2β)5sinαcosβ2 cosαsinα. Similar reasoning leads to the
formula sin(α1β)5sinα cosβ1cosαsinβ and to the analogous pair
cos(α6β)5cosαcosβ7 sinαsinβ. These four sum-and-difference formulas
consequently are often known today as Ptolemy’s formulas.</p>
<p>It was the formula for sine of the difference—or, more accurately,
chord of the difference—that Ptolemy found especially useful in building
up his tables. Another formula that served him effectively was the
equivalent of our half-angle formula. Given the chord of an arc in a
circle, Ptolemy found the chord of half of the arc as follows: let D be
the midpoint of arc BC in a circle with diameter AC52r (Fig. 8.9), let
AB5AE, and let</p>
<p>DF bisect EC (perpendicularly). Then, it is not difficult to show
that FC 5ð2r 2ABÞ: But from elementary geometry, it is known that2 DC2
5ACFC,fromwhichit followsthatDC 5r(2r2AB).If we let arc BC52α, then
DC52r sinα/2 and AB52r cosα; hence, we have the familiar modern formula
sinα=25pð12cosαÞ=2. In other words, if the chord of any arc is known,
the chord of half of the arc is also known. Now Ptolemy was equipped to
build up a table of chords as accurate as might be desired, for he had
the equivalent of our fundamental formulas.</p>
<p>The 360-Degree Circle</p>
<p>It should be recalled that from the days of Hipparchus until modern
times, there were no such things as trigonometric ratios. The Greeks—
and, after them, the Hindus and the Arabs—used trigonometric lines.
These at first took the form, as we have seen, of chords in a circle,
and it became incumbent on Ptolemy to associate numerical values (or
approximations) with the chords. To do this, two conventions were</p>
<p>needed: (1) some scheme for subdividing the circumference of a circle
and (2) some rule for subdividing the diameter. The division of a
circumference into 360 degrees seems to have been in use in Greece since
the days of Hipparchus, although it is not known just how the convention
arose. It is not unlikely that the 360-degree measure was carried over
from astronomy, where the zodiac had been divided into twelve “signs” or
36 “decans.” A cycle of the seasons of roughly 360 days could readily be
made to correspond to the system of zodiacal signs and decans by
subdividing each sign into thirty parts and each decan into ten parts.
Our common system of angle measure may stem from this correspondence.
Moreover, because the Babylonian positional system for fractions was so
obviously superior to the Egyptian unit fractions and the Greek common
fractions, it was natural for Ptolemy to subdivide his degrees into
sixty panes minutae primae, each of these latter into sixty partes
minutae secundae, and so on. It is from the Latin phrases that
translators used in this connection that our words “minute” and “second”
were derived.</p>
<p>Our trigonometric identities are easily converted into the language
of Ptolemaic chords through the simple relationships</p>
<p>chord2x chordð180 22xÞ sinx5 and cosx5:</p>
<p>120 120</p>
<p>The formulas cosðx6yÞ5cosxcosy7sinxsiny become (chord is abbreviated
to cd)</p>
<p>cd 2x cd 2y 7cd 2xcd 2y cd 2x62y 5 ;</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>where a line over an arc (angle) indicates the supplementary arc.
Note that not only angles and arcs but also their chords were expressed
sexagesimally. In fact, whenever scholars in antiquity wished an
accurate system of approximation, they turned to the sixty-scale for the
fractional portion; this led to the phrases “astronomers’ fractions” and
“physicists’ fractions” to distinguish sexagesimal from common
fractions.</p>
<p>Construction of Tables</p>
<p>Having decided on his system of measurement, Ptolemy was ready to
compute the chords of angles within the system. For example, because the
radius of the circle of reference contained sixty parts, the chord of an
arc of 60 degrees also contained sixty linear parts. The chord of 120
will be 60p3 or approximately 103 parts and 55 minutes and 33 seconds
or, in Ptolemy’s Ionic or alphabetic notation, ργp υεu λγv. Ptolemy
could now have used his half-angle formula to find the chord of 30, then
the chord of 15, and so on, for still smaller angles. Yet, he preferred
to delay the application of this formula and computed instead the chords
of 36 and 72. He used a theorem from Elements XIII.9, which shows that a
side of a regular pentagon, a side of a regular hexagon, and a side of a
regular decagon, all being inscribed within the same circle, constitute
the sides of a right triangle. Incidentally, this theorem from Euclid
provides the justification for Ptolemy’s elegant construction of a
regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. Let O be the center of a circle
and AB a diameter (Fig. 8.10). Then, if C is the midpoint of OB and OD
is perpendicular to AB, and if CE is taken equal to CD, the sides of the
right triangle EDO are the sides of the regular inscribed pentagon,
hexagon, and decagon. Then, if the radius OB contains 60 parts, from the
properties of the pentagon and the golden section, it follows that OE,
the chord of 36, is 30ðp521Þ or about 37.083 or 37p 4u 5pv or λζpνεv. By
the Pythagorean</p>
<p>theorem, the chord of 72 is 30 1022 5; or approximately 70.536 or</p>
<p>70p 32u 3v or opλβuγv. p</p>
<p>Knowing the chord of an arc of s degrees in a circle, one can easily
find the chord of the arc 180 2s from the theorems of Thales and
Pythagoras, for cd2s1cd2s51202. Hence, Ptolemy knew the chords of the
supplements of 36 and 72. Moreover, from the chords of 72 and 60, he
found chord 12 by means of his formula for the chord of the difference
of two arcs. Then, by successive applications of his half-angle formula,
he derived the chords of arcs of 6, 3, 1, and , the last two being 1p
34u 15v and 0p 47u 8v, respectively. Through a linear interpolation
between these values, Ptolemy arrived at 1p 2u 50v as the chord of 1. By
using the half-angle formula—or, because the angle is very small, simply
dividing by 2—he found the value of 0p 31u 25v for the chord of 30u.
This is equivalent to saying that sin 150 is 0.00873, which is correct
to almost half a dozen decimal places.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s value of the chord of is, of course, the length of a side
of a polygon of 720 sides inscribed in a circle of radius 60 units.
Whereas Archimedes’ polygon of 96 sides had led to as an approximation
to the value of π, Ptolemy’s is equivalent to 6(0p 31u 25v) or 3;8,30.
This approximation to π, used by Ptolemy in the Almagest, is the same as
,</p>
<p>which leads to a decimal equivalent of about 3.1416, a value that may
have been given earlier by Apollonius.</p>
<p>Ptolemaic Astronomy</p>
<p>Armed with formulas for the chords of sums and differences and chords
of half an arc and having a good value of chord , Ptolemy went on to
build up his table, correct to the nearest second, of chords of arcs
from to 180 for every . This is virtually the same as a table of sines
from to 90, proceeding by steps of . The table formed an integral part
of Book I of the Almagest and remained an indispensable tool of
astronomers for
morethanathousandyears.Theremainingtwelvebooksofthiscelebrated treatise
contain, among other things, the beautifully developed theory of cycles
and epicycles for the planets known as the Ptolemaic system. Like
Archimedes, Hipparchus, and most other great thinkers of antiquity,
Ptolemy postulated an essentially geocentric universe, for a moving
earth appeared to be faced with difficulties—such as lack of apparent
stellar parallax and seeming inconsistency with the phenomena of
terrestrial dynamics. In comparison with these problems, the
implausibility of an immense speed required for the daily rotation of
the sphere of the “fixed” stars seemed to shrink into
insignificance.</p>
<p>Plato had set for Eudoxus the astronomical problems of “saving the
phenomena”—that is, producing a mathematical device, such as a
combination of uniform circular motions, which should serve as a model
for the apparent motions of the planets. The Eudoxian system of
homocentric spheres had been largely abandoned by mathematicians in
favor of the system of cycles and epicycles of Apollonius and
Hipparchus. Ptolemy, in turn, made an essential modification in the
latter scheme. In the first place, he displaced the earth somewhat from
the center of the deferent circle, so that he had eccentric orbits. Such
changes had been made before him, but Ptolemy introduced a novelty so
drastic in scientific implication that later Nicholas Copernicus could
not accept it, effective though the device, known as the equant, was in
reproducing the planetary motions. Try as he would, Ptolemy had not been
able to arrange a system of cycles, epicycles, and eccentrics in close
agreement with the observed motions of the planets. His solution was to
abandon the Greek insistence on uniformity of circular motions and to
introduce instead a geometric point, the equant E collinear with the
earth G and the center C of the deferent circle, such that the apparent
angular motion of the center Q of the epicycle in which a planet P
revolves is uniform as seen from E (Fig. 8.11). In this way, Ptolemy
achieved accurate representations of planetary motions, but, of course,
the device was only kinematic and made no effort to answer the questions
in dynamics raised by nonuniform circular movements.</p>
<p>Other Works by Ptolemy</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s fame today is largely associated with a single book, the
Almagest, but there are other Ptolemaic works as well. Among the more
important was a Geography, in eight books, which was as much a bible to
geographers of his day as the Almagest was to astronomers. The Geography
of Ptolemy introduced the system of latitudes and longitudes as used
today, described methods of cartographic projection, and catalogued some
8,000 cities, rivers, and other important features of the earth.
Unfortunately, there was at the time no satisfactory means of
determining longitudes, hence substantial errors were inevitable. Even
more significant was the fact that Ptolemy seems to have made a poor
choice when it came to estimating the size of the earth. Instead of
accepting the figure 252,000 stadia, given by Eratosthenes, he preferred
the value 180,000 stadia that was proposed by Posidonius, a Stoic
teacher of Pompey and Cicero. Hence, Ptolemy thought that the known
Eurasian world was a larger fraction of the circumference than it really
is—more than 180 in longitude, instead of the actual figure of about
130. This large error suggested to later navigators, including Columbus,
that a voyage westward from Europe to India would not be nearly so far
as it turned out to be. Had Columbus known how badly Ptolemy had
underestimated the size of the earth, he might never have set sail.</p>
<p>Ptolemy’s geographical methods were better in theory than in
practice, for in separate monographs, which have survived only through
Latin translations from the Arabic, Ptolemy described two types of map
projection. Orthographic projection is explained in the Analemma, the
earliest account we have of this method, although it may have been used
by Hipparchus. In this transformation from a sphere to a plane, points
on the spherical surface are projected orthogonally on three mutually
perpendicular planes. In the Planisphaerium, Ptolemy described the
stereographic projection in which points on the sphere are projected by
lines from a pole onto a plane—in Ptolemy’s case, from the South Pole to
the plane of the equator. He knew that under such a transformation, a
circle not through the pole of projection went into a circle in the
plane, andthatacirclethroughthepolewasprojectedintoastraightline.Ptolemy
was also aware of the important fact that such a transformation is
conformal, that is, angles are preserved. Ptolemy’s importance for
geography can be gauged from the fact that the earliest maps in the
Middle Ages that have come down to us in manuscripts, none before the
thirteenth century, had as prototypes the maps made by Ptolemy more than
a thousand years earlier.</p>
<p>Optics and Astrology</p>
<p>Ptolemy also wrote an Optics that has survived, imperfectly, through
a Latin version of an Arabic translation. This deals with the physics
and the psychology of vision, with the geometry of mirrors, and with an
early attempt at a law of refraction.</p>
<p>No account of Ptolemy’s work would be complete without mention of his
Tetrabiblos (or Quadripartitum), for it shows us a side of ancient
scholarship that we are prone to overlook. The Almagest is indeed a
model of good mathematics and accurate observational data put to work in
building a sober scientific astronomy, but the Tetrabiblos (or work in
four books) addresses a kind of sidereal religion to which much of the
ancient world had succumbed. Ptolemy in the Tetrabiblos argued that one
should not, because of the possibility of error, discourage the
astrologer any more than the physician.</p>
<p>The Tetrabiblos differs from the Almagest not only as astrology
differs from astronomy; the two works also make use of different types
of mathematics. The latter makes good use of synthetic Greek geometry;
the former suggests that the populace in general was more concerned with
arithmetical computation than with rational thought. At least from the
days of Alexander the Great to the close of the classical world, there
was undoubtedly much intercommunication between Greece and Mesopotamia,
and it seems clear that the Babylonian arithmetic and algebraic geometry
continued to exert considerable influence in the Hellenistic world.
Greek deductive geometry, on the other hand, seems not to have been
welcomed in Mesopotamia until after the Arabic conquest.</p>
<h4 id="heron-of-alexandria">Heron of Alexandria</h4>
<p>Heron of Alexandria is best known in the history of mathematics for
the formula, bearing his name, for the area of a triangle:</p>
<p>K 5psðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞ</p>
<p>where a, b, and c are the sides and s is half of the sum of these
sides, that is, the semiperimeter. The Arabs tell us that “Heron’s
formula” was</p>
<p>Her on of A le x andr ia</p>
<p>known earlier to Archimedes, who undoubtedly had a proof of it, but
the demonstration of it in Heron’s Metrica is the earliest that we have.
Although now the formula is usually derived trigonometrically, Heron’s
proof is conventionally geometric. The Metrica, like the Method of
Archimedes, was long lost, until rediscovered at Constantinople in 1896
in a manuscript dating from about 1100. The word “geometry” originally
meant “earth measure,” but classical geometry, such as that found in
Euclid’s Elements and Apollonius’s Conics, was far removed from mundane
surveying. Heron’s work, on the other hand, shows us that not all
mathematics in Greece was of the “classical” type. There evidently were
two levels in the study of configurations—comparable to the distinction
made in numerical context between arithmetic (or theory of numbers) and
logistic (or techniques of computation)—one of which, eminently
rational, might be known as geometry and the other, largely practical,
might better be described as geodesy. The Babylonians lacked the former
but were strong in the latter, and it was essentially the Babylonian
type of mathematics that is found in Heron. It is true that in the
Metrica an occasional demonstration is included, but the body of the
work is concerned with numerical examples in mensuration of lengths,
areas, and volumes. There are strong resemblances between his results
and those found in ancient Mesopotamian problem texts. For example,
Heron gave a tabulation of the areas An, of regular polygons of n sides
in terms of the square of one side sn, beginning with A3 51330s23 and
continuing to A12 5454 s212: As was the case in pre-Hellenic
mathematics, Heron also made no distinction between results that are
exact and those that are only approximations.</p>
<p>The gap that separated classical geometry from Heronian mensuration
is clearly illustrated by certain problems set and solved by Heron in
another of his works, the Geometrica. One problem calls for the
diameter, the perimeter, and the area of a circle, given the sum of
these three magnitudes. The axiom of Eudoxus would rule out such a
problem from theoretical consideration, for the three magnitudes are of
unlike dimensions, but from an uncritical numerical point of view, the
problem makes sense. Moreover, Heron did not solve the problem in
general terms but, taking a cue again from pre-Hellenic methods, chose
the specific case in which the sum is 212; his solution is like the
ancient recipes in which only steps, without reasons, are given. The
diameter 14 is easily found by taking the Archimedean value for π and
using the Babylonian method of completing the square to solve a
quadratic equation. Heron simply gives the laconic instructions
“Multiply 212 by 154, add 841, take the square root and subtract 29, and
divide by 11.” This is scarcely the way to teach mathematics, but
Heron’s books were intended as manuals for the practitioner.</p>
<p>Heron paid as little attention to the uniqueness of his answer as he
did to the dimensionality of his magnitudes. In one problem, he called
for the sides of a right triangle if the sum of the area and the
perimeter is 280.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an indeterminate problem, but Heron gave only one
solution,makinguseof theArchimedeanformulafortheareaof atriangle. In
modern notation,if s is thesemiperimeter of thetriangle and r theradius
of the inscribed circle, then rs12s5s(r12)5280. Following his own
cookbook rule, “Always look for the factors,” he chose r1258 and
s535.Then,thearearsis210.Butthetriangleisarighttriangle,hencethe
hypotenuse c is equal to s2r or 3526, or 29; the sum of the two sides a
and b is equal to s1r, or 41. The values of a and b are then easily
found to be 20 and 21. Heron says nothing about other factorizations of
280, which, of course, would lead to other answers.</p>
<p>Principle of Least Distance</p>
<p>Heron was interested in mensuration in all its forms—in optics and
mechanics, as well as in geodesy. The law of reflection for light had
been known to Euclid and Aristotle (probably also to Plato), but it was
Heron who showed by a simple geometric argument, in a work on Catoptrics
(or reflection), that the equality of the angles of incidence and
reflection is a consequence of the Aristotelian principle that nature
does nothing the hard way. That is, if light is to travel from a source
S to a mirror MMu and then to the eye E of an observer (Fig. 8.12), the
shortest possible path SPE is that in which the angles SPM and EPMu are
equal. That no other path SPuE can be as short as SPE is apparent on
drawing SQSu perpendicular to MMu, with SQ5QSu and comparing the path
SPE with the path SPuE. Because paths SPE and SPuE are equal in length
to paths SuPE and SuPuE, respectively, and inasmuch as SuPE is a
straight line (because angle MuPE is equal to angle MPS), it follows
that SuPE is the shortest path.</p>
<p>Heron is remembered in the history of science and technology as the
inventor of a primitive type of steam engine, described in his
Pneumatics; of a forerunner of the thermometer; and of various toys and
mechanical contrivances based on the properties of fluids and on the
laws of the</p>
<p>FIG. 8.12</p>
<p>Nic omac hus of Gera s a</p>
<p>simple machines. He suggested in the Mechanics a law (clever but
incorrect) of the simple machine whose principle had eluded even
Archimedes—the inclined plane. His name is also attached to “Heron’s
algorithm” for finding square roots, but this method of iteration was in
reality due to the Babylonians of 2,000 years before his day. Although
Heron evidently learned much of Mesopotamian mathematics, he seems not
to have appreciated the importance of the positional principle for
fractions. Sexagesimal fractions had become the standard tool of
scholars in astronomy and physics, but it is likely that they remained
unfamiliar to the common man. Common fractions were used to some extent
by the Greeks, at first with the numerator placed below the denominator
and later with the positions reversed (and without the bar separating
the two), but Heron, writing for the practical man, seems to have
preferred unit fractions. In dividing 25 by 13, he wrote the answer as
11111. The old Egyptian addiction to unit fractions continued in Europe
for at least a thousand years after the time of Heron.</p>
<h4 id="the-decline-of-greek-mathematics">The Decline of Greek
Mathematics</h4>
<p>The period from Hipparchus to Ptolemy, covering three centuries, was
one in which applied mathematics was in the ascendant. It is sometimes
held that mathematics develops most effectively when in close touch with
the world’s work, but the period we have been considering would argue
for the opposite thesis. From Hipparchus to Ptolemy, there were advances
in astronomy and geography, optics and mechanics, but no significant
developments in mathematics outside of trigonometry. Some attribute the
decline to the inadequacies and difficulties in Greek geometric algebra,
others to the cold breath of Rome. In any event, the period during which
trigonometry and mensuration came to the fore was characterized by a
lack of progress, yet it was precisely these aspects of Greek
mathematics that most attracted the Hindu and Arabic scholars who served
as a bridge to the modern world. Before we turn to these peoples,
however, we must look at the Indian summer of Greek mathematics,
sometimes known as the “Silver Age.”</p>
<p>The period that we consider next, from Ptolemy to Proclus, covers
almost four centuries (from the second to the sixth), but our account is
based in large part on only two chief treatises, mere portions of which
are now extant, as well as on a number of works of lesser
significance.</p>
<p>Nicomachus of Gerasa</p>
<p>It should be recalled that in ancient Greece, the word “arithmetic”
meant the theory of numbers, rather than computation. Often Greek
arithmetic had more in common with philosophy than with what we think of
as mathematics; hence, the subject had played a large role in
Neoplatonism during the Later Alexandrian Age. This had been
particularly true of the Introductio arithmeticae of Nicomachus of
Gerasa, a Neopythagorean who lived not far from Jerusalem about the year
100 CE. The author is sometimes held to be of Syrian background, but
Greek philosophical tendencies certainly predominate in his work. The
Introductio of Nicomachus, as we have it, contains only two books, and
it is possible that this is only an abridged version of what was
originally a more extensive treatise. At all events, the possible loss
in this case is far less to be regretted than the loss of seven books of
the Arithmetica of Diophantus. Nicomachus had, so far as we can see,
little mathematical competence and was concerned only with the most
elementary properties of numbers. The level of the work may be judged
from the fact that the author found it expedient to include a
multiplication table up to ι times ι (that is, 10 times 10).</p>
<p>The Introductio of Nicomachus opens with the anticipated Pythagorean
classification of numbers into even and odd, then into evenly even
(powers of two) and evenly odd (2n p, where p is odd and p. 1 and n. 1)
and oddly even (2 p, where p is odd and p. 1). Prime, composite, and
perfect numbers are defined, and a description of the sieve of
Eratosthenes is included, as well as a list of the first four perfect
numbers (6 and 28 and 496 and 8,128). The work also includes a
classification of ratios and combinations of ratios (ratios of integers
are essential in the Pythagorean theory of musical intervals), an
extensive treatment of figurate numbers (which had loomed so large in
Pythagorean arithmetic) in both two and three dimensions, and a
comprehensive account of the various means (again a favorite topic in
Pythagorean philosophy). As did some other writers, Nicomachus regarded
the number 3 as the first number in the strict sense of the word, for 1
and 2 were really only the generators of the number system. For
Nicomachus, numbers were endowed with such qualities as better or worse,
younger or older, and they could transmit characters, as parents to
their progeny. Despite such arithmetical anthropomorphism as a
background, the Introductio contains a moderately sophisticated theorem.
Nicomachus noticed that if the odd integers are grouped in the pattern
1; 315; 719111; 13115117119;…, the successive sums are the cubes of the
integers. This observation, coupled with the early Pythagorean
recognition that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2, leads to the
conclusion that the sum of the first n perfect cubes is equal to the
square of the sum of the first n integers.</p>
<h4 id="diophantus-of-alexandria">Diophantus of Alexandria</h4>
<p>We have seen that Greek mathematics was not uniformly on a high
level, for the glorious period of the third century BCE had been
followed by a</p>
<p>Diophantus of Ale x andr ia</p>
<p>decline, perhaps to some extent arrested in the days of Ptolemy, but
not effectively reversed until the century of the “Silver Age,” about
250 CE to 350. At the beginning of this period, also known as the Later
Alexandrian Age, we find the leading Greek algebraist Diophantus of
Alexandria, and toward its close there appeared the last significant
Greek geometer, Pappus of Alexandria. No other city has been the center
of mathematical activity for so long a period as was Alexandria from the
days of</p>
<p>Euclid (ca. 300 BCE) to the time of Hypatia (415 CE).</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the life of Diophantus is so great that we do not
definitely know in which century he lived. Generally, he is assumed to
have flourished about 250 CE. According to a tradition that is reported
in a collection of problems known as the Greek Anthology (described
further on):</p>
<p>God granted him to be a boy for the sixth part of his life, and
adding a twelfth part to this, He clothed his cheeks with down; He lit
him the light of wedlock after a seventh part, and five years after his
marriage He granted him a son. Alas! late-born wretched child; after
attaining the measure of half his father’s life, chill Fate took him.
After consoling his grief by this science of numbers for four years he
ended his life (Cohen and Drabkin 1958; p. 27).</p>
<p>If this conundrum is historically accurate, Diophantus lived to be
eighty-four years old.</p>
<p>Diophantus is often called the father of algebra, but we shall see
that such a designation is not to be taken literally. His work is not at
all the type of material that forms the basis of modern elementary
algebra, nor is it yet similar to the geometric algebra found in Euclid.
The chief Diophantine work known to us is the Arithmetica, a treatise
originally in thirteen books, only the first six of which have
survived.</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus was a treatise characterized by a high
degree of mathematicalskill and ingenuity.In thisrespect, thebookcan be
compared with the great classics of the earlier Alexandrian Age, yet it
has practically nothing in common with these or, in fact, with any
traditional Greek mathematics. It essentially represents a new branch
and makes use of a different approach. Being divorced from geometric
methods, it resembles Babylonian algebra to a large extent. But whereas
Babylonian mathematicians had been concerned primarily with the
approximate
solutionofdeterminateequationsasfarasthethirddegree,theArithmetica of
Diophantus (such as we have it) is almost entirely devoted to the exact
solution of equations, both determinate and indeterminate. Because of
the emphasis given in the Arithmetica to the solution of indeterminate
problems, the subject dealing with this topic, sometimes known as
indeterminate analysis, has since become known as Diophantine
analysis.</p>
<p>Algebra now is based almost exclusively on symbolic forms of
statement, rather than on the customary written language of ordinary
communication in which earlier Greek mathematics, as well as Greek
literature, had been expressed. It has been said that three stages in
the historical development of algebra can be recognized: (1) the
rhetorical or early stage, in which everything is written out fully in
words; (2) a syncopated or intermediate stage, in which some
abbreviations are adopted; and (3) a symbolic or final stage. Such an
arbitrary division of the development of algebra into three stages is,
of course, a facile oversimplification, but it can serve effectively as
a first approximation to what has happened, and within such a framework
the Arithmetica of Diophantus is to be placed in the second
category.</p>
<p>Throughout the six surviving books of the Arithmetica, there is a
systematic use of abbreviations for powers of numbers and for
relationships and operations. An unknown number is represented by a
symbol that resembles the Greek letter (perhaps for the last letter of
arithmos); the square of this appears as Δγ; the cube as Kγ; the fourth
power, called square-square, as ΔγΔ; the fifth power, or square-cube, as
ΔKγ; and the sixth power, or cube-cube, as KγK. Diophantus was familiar
with the rules of combination equivalent to our laws of exponents. The
chief difference between the Diophantine syncopation and the modern
algebraic notation is in the lack of special symbols for operations and
relations, as well as of the exponential notation.</p>
<p>Diophantine Problems</p>
<p>If we think primarily of matters of notation, Diophantus has a good
claim to be known as the father of algebra, but in terms of motivation
and concepts, the claim is less appropriate. The Arithmetica is not a
systematic exposition of the algebraic operations or of algebraic
functions or of the solution of algebraic equations. It is instead a
collection of 150 problems, all worked out in terms of specific
numerical examples, although perhaps generality of method was intended.
There is no postulational development, nor is an effort made to find all
possible solutions. No clearcut distinction is made between determinate
and indeterminate problems, and even for the latter, for which the
number of solutions generally is unlimited, only a single answer is
given. Diophantus solved problems involving several unknown numbers by
skillfully expressing all unknown quantities, where possible, in terms
of only one of them.</p>
<p>Diophantus used much the same approach in indeterminate analysis. In
one problem, it is required to find two numbers such that either
when</p>
<p>Diophantus of Ale x andr ia</p>
<p>added to the square of the other will yield a perfect square. This is
a typical instance of Diophantine analysis, in which only rational
numbers are acceptable as answers. In solving the problem, Diophantus
did not call the numbers x and y, but rather x and 2x11. Here the
second, when added to the square of the first, will yield a perfect
square no matter what value one chooses for x. Now, it is also required
that (2x11)2 1x must be a perfect square. Here Diophantus does not point
out the infinity of possible answers. He is satisfied to choose a
particular case of a perfect square, in this instance the number
(2x22)2, such that when equated to (2x11)2 1x, an equation that is
linear in x results. Here the result is x5, so that the other number,
2x11, is . One could, of course, have used (2x23)2 or (2x24)2 or
expressions of similar form, instead of (2x22)2, to arrive at other
pairs of numbers having the desired property. Here we see an approach
that comes close to a “method” in Diophantus’s work: When two conditions
are to be satisfied by two numbers, the two numbers are so chosen that
one of the two conditions is satisfied, and then one turns to the
problem of satisfying the second condition. That is, instead of handling
simultaneous equations on two unknowns, Diophantus operates with
successive conditions, so that only a single unknown number appears in
the work.</p>
<p>The Place of Diophantus in Algebra</p>
<p>Among the indeterminate problems in the Arithmetica are some
involving equations such as x2 51130y2 and x2 51126y2, which are
instances of the so-called Pell equation, x2 511py2; again, a single
answer is thought to suffice. In a sense, it is not fair to criticize
Diophantus for being satisfied with a single answer, for he was solving
problems, not equations. The Arithmetica is not an algebra textbook, but
a problem collection in the application of algebra. In this respect,
Diophantus is like the Babylonian algebraists, but his numbers are
entirely abstract and do not refer to measures of grain or dimensions of
fields or monetary units, as was the case in Egyptian and Mesopotamian
algebra. Moreover, he is interested only in exact rational solutions,
whereas the Babylonians were computationally inclined and were willing
to accept approximations to irrational solutions of equations.</p>
<p>We do not know how many of the problems in the Arithmetica were
original or whether Diophantus had borrowed from other similar
collections. Possibly, some of the problems or methods are traceable
back to Babylonian sources, for puzzles and exercises have a way of
reappearing generation after generation. To us today, the Arithmetica of
Diophantus looks strikingly original, but possibly this impression
results from the loss of rival problem collections. Indications that
Diophantus may have been less isolated a figure than has been supposed
are found in a collection of problems from about the early second
century of our era (hence, presumably antedating the Arithmetica), in
which some Diophantine symbols appear. Nevertheless, Diophantus has had
a greater influence on modern number theory than any other nongeometric
Greek mathematician has. In particular, Pierre de Fermat was led to his
celebrated “great” or “last” theorem when he sought to generalize a
problem that he had read in the Arithmetica of Diophantus (II.8): to
divide a given square into two squares.</p>
<p>Pappus of Alexandria</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus is a brilliant work worthy of the
period of revival in which it was written, but it is, in motivation and
content, far removed from the beautifully logical treatises of the great
geometric triumvirate of the earlier Alexandrian Age. Algebra seemed to
be more appropriate for problem solving than for deductive exposition,
and the great work of Diophantus remained outside the mainstream of
Greek mathematics. A minor work on polygonal numbers by Diophantus comes
closer to the earlier Greek interests, but even this cannot be regarded
as approaching the Greek logical ideal. Classical geometry had found no
ardent supporter, with the possible exception of Menelaus, since the
death of Apollonius some four hundred and more years earlier. But during
the reign of Diocletian (284 305 CE), there lived again in Alexandria a
scholar who was moved by the spirit that had possessed Euclid,
Archimedes, and Apollonius.</p>
<p>The Collection</p>
<p>In about 320 CE, Pappus of Alexandria composed a work with the title
Collection (Synagoge), which is important for several reasons. In the
first place, it provides a most valuable historical record of parts of
Greek mathematics that otherwise would be unknown to us. For instance,
it is in Book V of the Collection that we learn of Archimedes’ discovery
of the thirteen semiregular polyhedra or “Archimedean solids.” Then,
too, the Collection includes alternative proofs and supplementary lemmas
for propositions in Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Ptolemy.
Finally, the treatise includes new discoveries and generalizations not
found in any earlier work. The Collection, Pappus’s most important
treatise, contained eight books, but the first book and the first part
of the second book are now lost.</p>
<p>Book III of the Collection shows that Pappus thoroughly shared the
classical Greek appreciation of the niceties of logical precision in
geometry. Here he distinguishes sharply among “plane,” “solid,” and
“linear” problems—the first being constructible with only circles</p>
<p>and straight lines, the second being solvable through the use of
conic sections, and the last requiring curves other than lines, circles,
and conics. Then, Pappus describes some solutions of the three famous
problems of antiquity, the duplication and the trisection being problems
in the second or solid category and the squaring of the circle being a
linear problem. Here Pappus virtually asserts the fact that the
classical problems are impossible to solve under the Platonic
conditions, for they do not belong among the plane problems; but
rigorous proofs were not given until the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In Book IV, Pappus is again insistent that one should give for a
problem a construction appropriate to it. That is, one should not use
linear loci in the solution of a solid problem or solid or linear loci
in the solution of a plane problem. Asserting that the trisection of an
angle is a solid problem, he therefore suggests methods that make use of
conic sections, whereas Archimedes in one case had used a neusis, or
slidingruler type of construction, and in another the spiral, which is a
linear locus. One of the Pappus trisections is as follows. Let the given
angle AOB be placed in a circle with center O (Fig. 8.13) and let OC be
the angle bisector. Draw the hyperbola having A as one focus, OC as the
corresponding directrix, and with an eccentricity equal to 2. Then, one
branch of this hyperbola will cut the circumference of the circle in a
point T such that +AOT is one-third +AOB.</p>
<p>A second trisection construction proposed by Pappus makes use of an
equilateral hyperbola as follows. Let the side OB of the given angle AOB
be a diagonal of a rectangle ABCO, and through A draw the equilateral
hyperbola having BC and OC (extended) as asymptotes (Fig. 8.14). With A
as center and with radius twice OB, draw a circle intersecting the
hyperbola in P, and from P drop the perpendicular PT to the line CB
extended. Then, it is readily proved, from the properties of the
hyperbola, that the straight line through O and T is parallel to AP and
that +AOT is one-third +AOB. Pappus gives no source for his trisections,
and we cannot help but wonder whether this trisection was known to
Archimedes. If we draw the semicircle passing through B, having QT
as</p>
<p>diameter and M as center, we have essentially the Archimedean neusis
construction, for OB5QM5MT5MB.</p>
<p>In Book III, Pappus also describes the theory of means and gives an
attractive construction that includes the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the harmonic means within a single semicircle. Pappus shows that if in
the semicircle ADC with center O (Fig. 8.15) one has DB ? AC and BF ?
OD, then DO is the arithmetic mean, DB the geometric mean, and DF the
harmonic mean of the magnitudes AB and BC. Here Pappus claims for
himself only the proof, attributing the diagram to an unnamed
geometer.</p>
<p>Theorems of Pappus</p>
<p>The Collection of Pappus is replete with bits of interesting
information and significant new results. In many cases, the novelties
take the form of generalizations of earlier theorems, and a couple of
these instances appear in Book IV. Here we find an elementary
generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. If ABC is any triangle (Fig.
8.16) and if ABDE and</p>
<p>FIG. 8.15</p>
<p>CBGF are any parallelograms constructed on two of the sides, then
Pappus constructs on side AC a third parallelogram ACKL equal to the sum
of the other two. This is easily accomplished by extending sides FG and
ED to meet in H, then drawing HB and extending it to meet side AC in J,
and finally drawing AL and CK parallel to HBJ. It is not known whether
this generalization, usually bearing the name of Pappus, was original
with Pappus, and it has been suggested that possibly it was known
earlier to Heron. Another instance of generalization in Book IV, also
bearing Pappus’s name, extends theorems of Archimedes on the shoemaker’s
knife. It asserts that if circles C1, C2, C3, C4,…, Cn,… are inscribed
successively as in Fig. 8.17, all being tangent to the semicircles on AB
and on AC, and successively to one another, the perpendicular distance
from the center of the nth circle to the base line ABC is n times the
diameter of the nth circle.</p>
<p>The Pappus Problem</p>
<p>Book V of the Collection was a favorite with later commentators, for
it raised a question about the sagacity of bees. Inasmuch as Pappus
showed that of two regular polygons having equal perimeters, the one
with the greater number of sides has the greater area, he concluded that
bees demonstrated some degree of mathematical understanding in
constructing</p>
<p>their cells as hexagonal, rather than square or triangular, prisms.
The book goes into other problems of isoperimetry, including a
demonstration that the circle has a greater area, for a given perimeter,
than does any regular polygon. Here Pappus seems to have been closely
following On Isometric Figures, written almost half a millennium earlier
by Zenodorus (ca. 180 BCE), some fragments of which were preserved by
later commentators. Among the propositions in Zenodorus’s treatise was
one asserting that of all solid figures the surfaces of
whichareequal,thespherehasthegreatestvolume,butonlyanincomplete
justification was given.</p>
<p>Books VI and VIII of the Collection are chiefly on applications of
mathematics to astronomy, optics, and mechanics (including an
unsuccessful attempt at finding the law of the inclined plane). Of far
more significance in the history of mathematics is Book VII, in which,
through his penchant for generalization, Pappus came close to the
fundamental principle of analytic geometry. The only means recognized by
the ancients for defining plane curves were (1) kinematic definitions in
which a point moves the subject to two superimposed motions, and (2) the
section by a plane of a geometric surface, such as a cone or a sphere or
a cylinder. Among the latter curves were certain quartics known as
spiric sections, described by Perseus (ca. 150 BCE), obtained by cutting
the anchor ring or torus by a plane. Occasionally, a twisted curve
caught the attention of the Greeks, including the cylindrical helix and
an analogue of the Archimedean spiral described on a spherical surface,
both of which were known to Pappus, but Greek geometry was primarily
restricted to the study of plane curves, in fact, to a very limited
number of plane curves. It is significant to note, therefore, that in
Book VII of the Collection, Pappus proposed a generalized problem that
implied infinitely many new types of curves. This problem, even in its
simplest form, is usually known as the “Pappus problem,” but the
original statement, involving three or four lines, seems to go back to
the days of Euclid. As first considered, the problem is referred to as
“the locus to three or four lines,” described previously in connection
with the work of Apollonius. Euclid evidently had identified the locus
only for certain special cases, but it appears that Apollonius, in a
work now lost, had given a complete solution. Pappus nevertheless gave
the impression that geometers had failed in attempts at a general
solution and implied that it was he who had first shown the locus in all
cases to be a conic section.</p>
<p>More important, Pappus then went on to consider the analogous problem
for more than four lines. For six lines in a plane, he recognized that a
curve is determined by the condition that the product of the distances
from three of the lines shall be in a fixed ratio to the product of the
distances to the other three lines. In this case, a curve is defined by
the fact that a solid is in a fixed ratio to another solid. Pappus
hesitated to go on to cases involving more than six lines, inasmuch as
“there is not anything contained by more than three dimensions.” But, he
continued, “men a little before our time have allowed themselves to
interpret such things, signifying nothing at all comprehensible,
speaking of the product of the content of such and such lines by the
square of this or the content of those. These things might however be
stated and shown generally by means of compounded proportions.” The
unnamed predecessors evidently were prepared to take a highly important
step in the direction of an analytic geometry that should include curves
of a degree higher than three, just as Diophantus had used the
expressions square-square and cube-cube for higher powers of numbers.
Had Pappus pursued the suggestion further, he might have anticipated
Descartes in a general classification and theory of curves far beyond
the classical distinction between plane, solid, and linear loci. His
recognition that, no matter what the number of lines in the Pappus
problem, a specific curve is determined is the most general observation
on loci in all of ancient geometry, and the algebraic syncopations that
Diophantus had developed would have been adequate to have disclosed some
of the properties of the curves. But Pappus was at heart only a
geometer, as Diophantus had been only an algebraist; hence, Pappus
merely remarked with surprise that no one had made a synthesis of this
problem for any case beyond that of four lines. Pappus himself made no
deeper study of these loci, “of which one has no further knowledge and
which are simply called curves.” What was needed for the next step in
this connection was the appearance of a mathematician equally concerned
about algebra and geometry; it is significant to note that when such a
figure appeared in the person of Descartes, it was this very problem of
Pappus’s that served as the point of departure in the invention of
analytic geometry.</p>
<p>TheTreasury of Analysis</p>
<p>There are other important topics in Book VII of the Collection, apart
from the Pappus problem. For one thing, there is a full description of
what was called the method of analysis and of a collection of works
known as the Treasury of Analysis. Pappus describes analysis as “a
method of taking that which is sought as though it were admitted and
passing from it through its consequences in order to something which is
admitted as a result of synthesis.” That is, he recognized analysis as a
“reverse solution,” the steps of which must be retraced in opposite
order to constitute a valid demonstration. If analysis leads to
something admitted to be impossible, the problem will also be
impossible, for a false conclusion implies a false premise. Pappus
explains that the method of analysis and synthesis is used by the
authors whose works constitute the Treasury of Analysis: “This is a body
of doctrine furnished for the use of those who, after going through the
usual elements, wish to obtain power to solve problems set to them
involving curves,” and Pappus lists among the works in the Treasury of
Analysis the treatises on conics by Aristaeus, Euclid, and Apollonius.
It is from Pappus’s description that we learn that Apollonius’s Conics
contained 487 theorems. Because the seven books now extant comprise 382
propositions, we can conclude that the lost eighth book had 105
propositions. About half of the works listed by Pappus in the Treasury
of Analysis are now lost, including Apollonius’s Cutting-off of a Ratio,
Eratosthenes’ On Means, and Euclid’s Porisms.</p>
<p>The Pappus-Guldin Theorems</p>
<p>Book VII of the Collection contains the first statement on record of
the focus-directrix property of the three conic sections. It appears
that Apollonius knew of the focal properties for central conics, but it
is possible that the focus-directrix property for the parabola was not
known before Pappus. Another theorem in Book VII that appears for the
first time is one usually named for Paul Guldin, a seventeenth-century
mathematician: If a closed plane curve is revolved about a line not
passing through the curve, the volume of the solid generated is found by
taking the product of the area bounded by the curve and the distance
traversed during the revolution by the center of gravity of the area.
Pappus was rightfully proud of this very general theorem, for it
included “a large number of theorems of all sorts about curves,
surfaces, and solids, all of which are proved simultaneously by one
demonstration.” There is a possibility that the “Guldin theorem”
represents an interpolation in the manuscript of the Collection. In any
case, the theorem is a striking advance by someone during or following
the long period of decline. Pappus also gave the analogous theorem that
the surface area generated by the revolution of a curve about a line not
cutting the curve is equal to the product of the length of the curve and
the distance traversed by the centroid of the curve during the
revolution.</p>
<h4 id="the-end-of-alexandrian-dominance">The End of Alexandrian
Dominance</h4>
<p>The Collection of Pappus is the last truly significant ancient
mathematical treatise, for the attempt of the author to revive geometry
was not successful. Mathematical works continued to be written in Greek
for about another thousand years, continuing an influence that had begun
almost a millennium earlier, but authors following Pappus never again
rose to his level. Their works are almost exclusively in the form of
commentary on earlier treatises. Pappus himself is in part responsible
for the ubiquitous commentaries that ensued, for he had composed
commentaries on the</p>
<p>B o e t hius</p>
<p>Elements of Euclid and on the Almagest of Ptolemy, among others, only
fragments of which survive. Later commentaries, such as those of Theon
of Alexandria (fl. 365 CE), are more useful for historical information
than for mathematical results. Theon was responsible for an important
edition of the Elements that has survived; he is also remembered as the
father of Hypatia, who wrote commentaries on Diophantus and Apollonius
and also revised part of her father’s commentary on Ptolemy. An ardent
and influential teacher of pagan Neoplatonism, Hypatia incurred the
enmity of a fanatical Christian mob at whose hands she suffered a cruel
death in 415 CE. The dramatic impact of her death in Alexandria has
caused that year to be taken by some to mark the end of ancient
mathematics; more specifically, it marks the end of Alexandria as the
major mathematical center it had been.</p>
<h4 id="proclus-of-alexandria">Proclus of Alexandria</h4>
<p>Alexandria produced in Proclus (410 485 CE) a young scholar who went
to Athens, where he became one of the last heads of the Academy and a
leader of the Neoplatonic school. Proclus was more a philosopher than a
mathematician, but his remarks are often essential for the history of
early Greek geometry. Of great significance is his Commentary on Book I
of the Elements of Euclid, for, while writing this, Proclus undoubtedly
had at hand a copy of the History of Geometry by Eudemus, now lost, as
well as Pappus’s Commentary on the Elements, largely lost. For our
information on the history of geometry before Euclid, we are heavily
indebted to Proclus, who included in his Commentary a summary or a
substantial extract from Eudemus’s History. This passage, which has come
to be known as the Eudemian Summary, may be taken as Proclus’s chief
contribution to mathematics, although to him is ascribed the theorem
that if a line segment of fixed length moves with its end points on two
intersecting lines, a point on the segment will describe a portion of an
ellipse.</p>
<h4 id="boethius">Boethius</h4>
<p>During the years when Proclus was writing in Athens, the Roman Empire
in the West was gradually collapsing. The end of the empire is usually
placed at 476 CE, for in this year the incumbent Roman emperor was
displaced by Odoacer, a Goth. Some of the old Roman senatorial pride
remained, but the senatorial party had lost political control. In this
situation, Boethius (ca. 480 524 CE), one of the foremost mathematicians
produced by ancient Rome, found his position difficult, for he came of
an old distinguished patrician family. He was not only a philosopher and
a mathematician but also a statesman, and he probably viewed with
distaste the rising Ostrogothic power. He was the author of textbooks
for each of the four mathematical branches in the liberal arts, but
these were jejune and exceedingly elementary abbreviations of earlier
classics—an Arithmetic that was only an abridgement of the Introductio
of Nicomachus; a Geometry based on Euclid and including only statements,
without proof, of some of the simpler portions of the first four books
of the Elements; an Astronomy derived from Ptolemy’s Almagest; and a
Music that is indebted to the earlier works of Euclid, Nicomachus, and
Ptolemy. In some cases, these primers, used extensively in medieval
monastic schools, may have suffered later interpolations; hence, it is
difficult to determine precisely what is genuinely due to Boethius
himself. It is nevertheless clear that the author was primarily
concerned with two aspects of mathematics: its relationship to
philosophy and its applicability to simple problems of mensuration.</p>
<p>Boethius seems to have been a statesman of high purpose and
unquestioned integrity. He and his sons in turn served as consuls, and
Boethius was among the chief advisers of Theodoric, but for some reason,
whether political or religious, the philosopher incurred the displeasure
of the emperor. It has been suggested that Boethius was a Christian (as
perhaps Pappus was also) and that he espoused Trinitarian views that
alienated the Arian emperor. It is also possible that Boethius was too
closely associated with political elements that looked to the Eastern
Empire for help in restoring the old Roman order in the West. In any
case, Boethius was executed in 524 or 525 CE, following a long
imprisonment. (Theodoric, incidentally, died only about a year later, in
526 CE.) While in prison, he wrote his most celebrated work, De
consolatione philosophiae. This essay, written in prose and verse while
he faced death, discusses moral responsibility in the light of
Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy.</p>
<h4 id="athenian-fragments">Athenian Fragments</h4>
<p>The death of Boethius may be taken to mark the end of ancient
mathematics in the Western Roman Empire, as the death of Hypatia had
marked the close of Alexandria as a mathematical center, but work
continued for a few years longer in Athens. There one found no great
original mathematician, but the Peripatetic commentator Simplicius
(fl. 520 CE) was sufficiently concerned about Greek geometry to have
preserved for us what may be the oldest fragment extant. Aristotle in
the Physica had referred to the quadrature of the circle or of a
segment, and Simplicius took this opportunity to quote “word for word”
what Eudemus had written on the subject of the quadrature of lunes by
Hippocrates. The account, several pages long, gives full details on the
quadratures of lunes, quoted by Simplicius from Eudemus, who in turn is
presumed to have given at least part of the proofs in Hippocrates’ own
words,</p>
<p>B y z ant ine Mat he mat ic ians</p>
<p>especially where certain archaic forms of expression are used. This
source is the closest we can come to direct contact with Greek
mathematics before the days of Plato.</p>
<p>Simplicius was primarily a philosopher, but in his day there
circulated a work usually described as the Greek Anthology, the
mathematical portions of which remind us strongly of the problems in the
Ahmes Papyrus of more than two millennia earlier. The Anthology
contained some six thousand epigrams; of these, more than forty are
mathematical problems, presumably collected by Metrodorus, a grammarian
of perhaps the fifth or sixth century. Most of them, including the
epigram in this chapter on the age of Diophantus, lead to simple linear
equations. For example, one is asked to find how many apples are in a
collection if they are to be distributed among six people so that the
first person receives one-third of the apples, the second receives
one-fourth, the third person receives one-fifth, the fourth person
receives one-eighth, the fifth person receives ten apples, and there is
one apple left for the last person. Another problem is typical of
elementary algebra texts of our day: If one pipe can fill a cistern in
one day, a second in two days, a third in three days, and a fourth in
four days, how long will it take all four running together to fill it?
The problems presumably were not original with Metrodorus but were
collected from various sources. Some probably go back before the days of
Plato, reminding us that not all Greek mathematics was of the type that
we think of as classical.</p>
<h4 id="byzantine-mathematicians">Byzantine Mathematicians</h4>
<p>There were contemporaries of Simplicius and Metrodorus who had
training that was adequate for an understanding of the works of
Archimedes and Apollonius. Among these was Eutocius (born ca. 480 CE),
who commented on several Archimedean treatises and on the Apollonian
Conics. We owe to Eutocius the Archimedean solution of a cubic through
intersecting conics, referred to in The Sphere and Cylinder but not
otherwise extant except through the commentary of Eutocius. The
commentary by Eutocius on the Conics of Apollonius was dedicated to
Anthemius of Tralles (fl. ca. 534 CE), an able mathematician and
architect of St. Sophia of Constantinople, who described the string
construction of the ellipse and wrote a work, On Burning-Mirrors, in
which the focal properties of the parabola are described. His colleague
and successor in the building of St. Sophia, Isidore of Miletus (fl. 520
CE), was also a mathematician of some ability. It was Isidore who made
known the commentaries of Eutocius and spurred a revival of interest in
the works of Archimedes and Apollonius. To him perhaps we owe the
familiar T-square and string construction of the parabola—and possibly
also the apocryphal Book XV of Euclid’s Elements. It may be in large
measure due to the activities of the Constantinople group—Eutocius,
Isidore, and Anthemius—that Greek versions of Archimedean works and of
the first four books of Apollonius’s Conics have survived to this
day.</p>
<p>When in 527 CE Justinian became emperor in the East, he evidently
felt that the pagan learning of the philosophical schools in Athens was
a threat to orthodox Christianity; hence, in 529 CE the philosophical
schools were closed and the scholars dispersed. About this time,
Simplicius and some of the other philosophers looked to the East for a
haven, which they found in Persia, where under Sassanid rule they
established what has been called the “Athenian Academy in Exile.” The
date 529 CE is therefore often taken to mark the close of European
mathematical development in antiquity. Henceforth, the seeds of Greek
science were to develop in Near and Far Eastern countries until, some
600 years later, the Latin world was in a more receptive mood. The date
529 CE has another significance that may be taken as symptomatic of a
change in values—in this year, the venerable monastery of Monte Cassino
was established.</p>
<p>Greek mathematics did not, of course, entirely disappear from Europe
in 529 CE, for commentaries continued to be written in Greek in the
Byzantine Empire, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and copied.
During the days of Proclus, the Academy at Athens had become a center of
Neoplatonic learning. Neoplatonic thought exerted a strong influence in
the Eastern Empire, which accounts for commentaries on Nicomachus’s
Introduction to Arithmetic by John Philoponus in the sixth century and
by Michael Constantine Psellus in the eleventh. Psellus also wrote a
Greek summary of the mathematical quadrivium, as did Georgios Pachymeres
(1242 1316) two centuries later. Both Pachymeres and his contemporary
Maximos Planudes wrote commentaries on the Arithmetic of Diophantus.
These examples show that a thin thread of the old Greek tradition
continued in the Eastern Empire to the very end of the medieval period.
The spirit of mathematics languished, however, where men argued less
about the value of geometry and more about the way to salvation. For the
next steps in mathematical development, we must therefore turn our backs
on Europe and look toward the East.</p>

<p>No one has the good method…. In this world there are no naturally
correct ways, and among methods, no solely good techniques.</p>
<p>Ji Kang</p>
<h4 id="the-oldest-known-texts">The Oldest Known Texts</h4>
<p>Civilizations along the Yangtze and Yellow rivers are comparable in
age with those along the Nile or between the Tigris and Euphrates, but
chronological accounts in the mathematical history of China are less
dependable than those for Egypt and Babylonia. As in the case of other
ancient civilizations, there are vestiges of early mathematical
activities in the form of counting, measuring, and weighing of objects.
Awareness of the Pythagorean theorem appears to predate the earliest
known mathematical texts. The dating of mathematical documents from
China is far from easy, however. None of the original versions of the
early classics are known to have survived. A set of texts on bamboo
strips discovered in the early 1980s sheds light on the age of some
related classics because they were found in sealed tombs dating from the
second century BCE. Estimates concerning the Zhoubi Suanjing (Chou Pei
Suan Ching),</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>generally considered to be the oldest of the mathematical classics,
have differed by almost a thousand years. Some considered the Zhoubi to
be a good record of Chinese mathematics of about 1200 BCE, but others
placed the work in the first century before our era. It may, in fact,
represent the work of different periods. A date after 300 BCE would
appear reasonable, thus placing it near or in the period of the Han
dynasty (202 BCE). “Zhoubi” seems to refer to the use of the gnomon in
studying the circular paths of the heavens, and the book of this title
is concerned with astronomical calculations, although it includes an
introduction on the properties of the right triangle, the Pythagorean
theorem, and some work on the use of fractions. The work is cast in the
form of a dialogue between a prince and his minister concerningthe
calendar; the ministertellshis rulerthat the art ofnumbersis derived
from the circle and the square,the square pertainingto the earth and the
circle belonging to the heavens.</p>
<h4 id="the-nine-chapters">The Nine Chapters</h4>
<p>Almost as old as the Zhoubi and perhaps the most influential of all
Chinese mathematical books was the Jiuzhang suanshu (Chui-chang
suan-shu), or Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. This book includes
246 problems on surveying, agriculture, partnerships, engineering,
taxation, calculation, the solution of equations, and the properties of
right triangles. Whereas the Greeks of this period were composing
logically ordered and systematically expository treatises, the Chinese,
like the Babylonians and the Egyptians, had the custom of compiling sets
of specific problems.</p>
<p>In this and other Chinese works, one is struck by the juxtaposition
of exact results and approximations. Correct rules are used for the
areas of triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids. The area of the circle
was found by taking three-fourths of the square on the diameter or
one-twelfth of the square of the circumference—a correct result if the
value 3 is adopted for π—but for the area of a segment of a circle, the
Nine Chapters uses the approximate results s(s1c)/2, where s is the
sagitta (that is, the radius minus the apothem) and c the chord or base
of the segment. There are problems that are solved by the rule of three;
in others, square and cube roots are found. Chapter 8 of the Nine
Chapters is significant for its solution of problems in simultaneous
linear equations, using both positive and negative numbers. The last
problem in the chapter involves four equations in five unknowns, and the
topic of indeterminate equations was to remain a favorite among
mathematicians of the Orient. The ninth and last chapter includes
problems on rightangled triangles, some of which later reappeared in
India and Europe. One of these asks for the depth of a pond 10 feet
square if a reed growing in the center and extending 1 foot above the
water just reaches the surface if drawn to the edge of the pond. Another
of these well-known problems is that of the “broken bamboo”: There is a
bamboo 10 feet</p>
<p>Ro d Numeral s</p>
<p>high, the upper end of which being broken reaches the ground 3 feet
from the stem. Find the height of the break.</p>
<p>The Chinese were especially fond of patterns; hence, it is not
surprising that the first record (of ancient but unknown origin) of a
magic square appeared there. The square</p>

<h4 id="rod-numerals">Rod Numerals</h4>
<p>Had Chinese mathematics enjoyed uninterrupted continuity of
tradition, some of the striking anticipations of modern methods might
have significantly modified the development of mathematics. But Chinese
culture was seriously hampered by abrupt breaks. In 213 BCE, for
example, the Chinese emperor ordered the burning of books, an
internationally popular activity at times of political stress. Some
works obviously must have survived, either through the existence of
copies or through oral transmission, and learning did indeed persist,
with mathematical emphasis on problems of commerce and the calendar.</p>
<p>There seems to have been contact between India and China, as well as
between China and the West, but scholars differ on the extent and
direction of borrowing. The temptation to see Babylonian or Greek
influence in China, forexample, is faced with theproblem that theChinese
did not make use of sexagesimal fractions. Chinese numeration remained
essentially decimal, with notations rather strikingly different from
those in other lands. In China, from early times, two schemes of
notation were in use. In one, the multiplicative principle predominated;
in the other, a form of positional notation was used. In the first of
these, there were distinct ciphers for the digits from 1 to 10 and
additional ciphers for the powers of 10, and in the written forms, the
digits in odd positions (from left to right or from bottom to top) were
multiplied by their successor. Thus, the number 678 would be written as
a 6, followed by the symbol for 100, then a 7, followed by the symbol
for 10, and finally the symbol for 8.</p>
<p>In the system of “rod numerals,” the digits from 1 to 9 appeared as ,
and the first nine multiples of 10 as</p>
<p>. By the use of these eighteen symbols</p>
<p>alternately in positions from right to left, numbers as large as
desired could be represented. The number 56,789, for instance, would
appear as</p>
<p>. As in Babylonia, a symbol for an empty position appeared</p>
<p>only relatively late. In a work of 1247, the number 1,405,536 is
written with a round zero symbol as . (Occasionally, as in the
fourteenth-century form of the arithmetic triangle, the vertical and
horizontal rods or strokes were interchanged.)</p>
<p>The precise age of the original rod numerals cannot be determined,
but they were certainly in use several hundred years before our era that
is, long before the positional notation had been adopted in India. The
use of a centesimal, rather than a decimal, positional system in China
was convenient for adaptation to computations with the counting board.
Distinctive notations for neighboring powers often enabled the Chinese
to use, without confusion, a counting board with unmarked vertical
columns. Before the eighth century, the place in which a zero was
required was simply left blank. Although in texts older than 300 CE, the
numbers and multiplication tables were written out in words,
calculations actually were made with rod numerals on a counting
board.</p>
<p>TheAbacus and Decimal Fractions</p>
<p>The rod numerals of about 300 BCE were not merely a notation for the
written result of a computation. Actual bamboo, ivory, or iron rods were
carried about in a bag by administrators and used as a calculating
device. Counting rods were manipulated with such dexterity that an
eleventhcentury writer described them as “flying so quickly that the eye
could not follow their movement.” Cancellations probably were more
rapidly carried out with rods on a counting board than in written
calculations. So effective, in fact, was the use of the rods on a
counting board that the abacus or rigid counting frame with movable
markers on wires was not used so early as has been generally supposed.
The first clear descriptions of the modern forms, known in China as the
suan phan and in Japan as the soroban, are of the sixteenth century, but
anticipations would appear</p>
<p>T he Ab ac us and D e c imal F rac t ions</p>
<p>to have been in use perhaps a thousand years earlier. The word
“abacus” is probably derived from the Semitic word “abq,” or “dust,”
indicating that in other lands, as well as in China, the device grew out
of a dust or sand tray used as a counting board. It is possible, but by
no means certain, that the use of the counting board in China antedates
the European, but clear-cut and reliable dates are not available. We
have noted that in the National Museum in Athens, there is a marble
slab, dating probably from the fourth century BCE, that appears to be a
counting board. And when a century earlier Herodotus wrote, “The
Egyptians move their hand from right to left in calculation, while the
Greeks move it from left to right,” he was probably referring to the use
of some sort of counting board. Just when such devices gave way to the
abacus proper is difficult to determine, nor can we tell whether the
appearances of the abacus in China, Arabia, and Europe were independent
inventions. The Arabic abacus had ten balls on each wire and no center
bar, whereas the Chinese had five lower and two upper counters on each
wire, separated by a bar. Each of the upper counters on a wire of the
Chinese abacus is</p>
<p>An early printed picture of an abacus, from the Suan Fa Tongzong,</p>
<p>1592 (Reproduced from J. Needham 1959, Vol. 3, p. 76.)</p>
<p>equivalent to five on the lower wire; a number is registered by
sliding the appropriate counters against the separating bar.</p>
<p>No description of Chinese numeration would be complete without
referencetotheuseoffractions.TheChinesewerefamiliarwithoperations on
common fractions, in connection with which they found lowest common
denominators. As in other contexts, they saw analogies with the
differences in the sexes, referring to the numerator as the “son” and to
the denominator as the “mother.” Emphasis on yin and yang (opposites,
especially in sex) made it easier to follow the rules for the
manipulation of fractions. More important than these, however, was the
tendency in China toward decimalization of fractions. As in Mesopotamia,
a sexagesimal metrology led to sexagesimal numeration, so also in China
adherence to the decimal idea in weights and measures resulted in a
decimal habit in the treatment of fractions that, it is said, can be
traced back as far as the fourteenth century BCE. Decimal devices in
computation were sometimes adopted to lighten manipulations of
fractions. In a first-century commentary on the Nine Chapters, for
example, we find the use of the now-familiar rules for square and cube
roots, equivalent to pa5p100a=10 and p3 a5p3 1000a=10; which facilitate
the decimalization of root extractions. The idea of negative numbers
seems not to have occasioned much difficulty for the Chinese because
they were accustomed to calculating with two sets of rods—a red set for
positive coefficients or numbers and a black set for negatives.
Nevertheless, they did not accept the notion that a negative number
might be a solution of an equation.</p>
<h4 id="values-of-pi">Values of Pi</h4>
<p>The earliest Chinese mathematics is so different from that of
comparable periods in other parts of the world that the assumption of
independent development would appear to be justified. At all events, it
seems safe to say that if there was some intercommunication before 400
CE, then more mathematics came out of China than went in. For later
periods, the question becomes more difficult. The use of the value 3 for
π in early Chinese mathematics is scarcely an argument for dependence on
Mesopotamia, especially since the search for more accurate values, from
the first centuries of the Christian era, was more persistent in China
thanp elsewhere. Values such as 3.1547, 10, 92/29, and 142/45 are found,
and in the third century Liu Hui, an important commentator on the Nine
Chapters, derived the figure 3.14 by use of a regular polygon of 96
sides and the approximation 3.14159 by considering a polygon of 3,072
sides. In Liu Hui’s reworking of the Nine Chapters, there are many
problems in mensuration, including the correct determination of the
volume of a frustum of a square pyramid. For a frustum of a</p>
<p>Value s of P i</p>
<p>circular cone, a similar formula was applied, but with a value of 3
for π. Unusual is the rule that the volume of a tetrahedron with two
opposite edges perpendicular to each other is one-sixth the product of
these two edges and their common perpendicular. The method of false
position is used in solving linear equations, but there are also more
sophisticated results, such as the solution, through a matrix pattern,
of a Diophantine problem involving four equations in five unknown
quantities. The approximate solution of equations of higher degree seems
to have been carried out by a device similar to what we know as
“Horner’s method.” Liu Hui also included, in his work on the Nine
Chapters, numerous problems involving inaccessible towers and trees on
hillsides.</p>
<p>The Chinese fascination with the value of π reached its high point in
the work of Zu Chongzhi (Tsu Ch’ung-chih) (430 501). One of his values
was the familiar Archimedean 22/7, described by Zu Chongzhi as
“inexact”; his “accurate” value was 355/113. If one persists in seeking
possible Western influence, one can explain away this remarkably good
approximation, not equaled anywhere until the fifteenth century, by
subtracting the numerator and the denominator, respectively, of the
Archimedean value from the numerator and the denominator of the
Ptolemaic value 377/120. Yet, Zu Chongzhi went even further in his
calculations, for he gave 3.1415927 as an “excess” value and 3.1415926
as a “deficit value.” The calculations by which he arrived at these
bounds, apparently aided by his son Zu Chengzhi, were probably contained
in one of his books, since lost. In any case, his results were
remarkable for that age, and it is fitting that today a landmark on the
moon bears his name.</p>
<p>The work of Liu Hui and Zu Chongzhi represents a greater interest in
theory and proofs than known examples of earlier mathematical activity
in China; the example of the computation of π may obscure this fact
because accuracy in the value of π is more a matter of computational
stamina than of theoretical insight. The Pythagorean theorem alone
suffices to give as accurate an approximation as may be desired.
Starting with the known perimeter of a regular polygon of n sides
inscribed in a circle, the perimeter of the inscribed regular polygon of
2π sides can be calculated by two applications of the Pythagorean
theorem. Let C be a circle with center O and radius r (Fig. 9.1), and
let PQ5s be a side of a regular inscribed polygon of n sides having a
known perimeter. Then, MR5v5r2u is known. Then, the sidepRQ2 5ðw 2of the
inscribed regularÞ2 2 the apothem OM5u is given by u5 r 2 s=2 ; hence,
the sagitta perimeter of this polygon is known. The calculation, as Liu
Hui saw, canp ð Þ polygon of 2n sides is found from w5 v 1 s=2 ; hence,
the</p>
<p>be shortened by noting that w2 52rv. An iteration of the procedure
will result in an ever closer approximation to the perimeter of the
circle, in terms of which π is defined.</p>
<p>From the sixth to the tenth century, a group of a dozen “classics,”
covering topics in arithmetic and number theory, served as a foundation
for mathematics taught in the “School for the Sons of the State.” These
works included the early Zhoubi and Nine Chapters, as well as later,
largely derivative, textbooks such as works by Liu Hui and others. The
group of a dozen books covered topics in arithmetic and the theory of
numbers, right triangles, the computation of irregular areas and
volumes, and more.</p>
<p>Between the tenth and the thirteenth centuries, we know of no new
Chinese mathematical breakthroughs, although some major technological
innovations such as paper and the mariner’s compass appeared at this
time. Generally, we may note that Chinese mathematical problems often
appear to be more picturesque than practical, yet Chinese civilization
was responsible for a substantial number of other technological
innovations. The use of printing and gunpowder (eighth century) was
earlier in China than elsewhere and earlier also than the high-water
mark in Chinese mathematics that occurred in the thirteenth century,
during the latter part of the Sung period.</p>
<h4 id="thirteenth-century-mathematics">Thirteenth-Century
Mathematics</h4>
<p>The later Sung period may be regarded as a high plateau of medieval
mathematics in China. During this period, which coincides with the time
of Mongol expansion and increased interaction with Islam, numerous
mathematicians combined traditional teachings of arithmetic and
measurement with new approaches to the solution of equations of higher
degree, both determinate and indeterminate.</p>
<p>At that time, there were mathematicians working in various parts of
China, but relations between them seem to have been remote, and, as in
the case of Greek mathematics, we evidently have relatively few of the
treatises that once were available.</p>
<p>One of the mathematicians of the period was Li Zhi (1192 1279), a
mathematician of Peking who spent a long and interesting life as an
occasional administrator, hermit, scholar, and academician. He was</p>
<p>T hir t e ent h C entur y Mat he mat ic s</p>
<p>offered a post as a royal annalist by Kublai Khan in 1260 but
politely found an excuse to decline it. His Ceyuan Haijing (Ts’e-yuan
hai-ching) (Sea-Mirror of the Circle Measurements) includes 170 problems
dealing with circles inscribed within, or circumscribed without, a right
triangle and with determining the relationships between the sides and
the radii, and some of the problems lead to equations of the fourth
degree. Although he did not describe his method of solving equations,
including some of the sixth degree, it appears that it was not very
different from that used by Zhu Shijie (Chu Shih-chieh) (fl. 1280 1303)
and Horner. Others who used the Horner method were Qin Jiushao (Ch’in
Chiu-shao) (ca. 1202 ca. 1261) and Yang Hui (fl. ca. 1261 1275). The
former was an unprincipled governor and minister who acquired immense
wealth within a hundred days of assuming office. His Shushu jiuzhang
(Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections) marks the high point in Chinese
indeterminate analysis, with the invention of routines for solving
simultaneous congruences. In this work, he also found the square root of
71,824 by steps paralleling those in the Horner method. With 200 as the
first approximation to a root of x2 271,82450, he diminished the roots
of this by 200 to obtain y2 1400y231,82450. For the latter equation, he
found 60 as an approximation and diminished the roots by 60, arriving at
a third equation, z2 1520z24,22450, of which 8 is a root. Hence, the
value of x is 268. In a similar way, he solved cubic and quartic
equations.</p>
<p>The same “Horner” device was used by Yang Hui, about whose life
almost nothing is known. He was a prolific arithmetician; among his
contributions that are extant are the earliest Chinese magic squares of
order greater than three, including two each of orders four through
eight and one each of orders nine and ten.</p>
<p>Yang Hui’s works also included results in the summation of series and
the so-called Pascal triangle, things that were published and better
known through the Precious Mirror (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of
Zhu Shijie, with which the Golden Age of Chinese mathematics closed.</p>
<p>Zhu Shijie was the last and greatest of the Sung mathematicians, yet
we know little about him—not even when he was born or when he died. He
was a resident of Yanshan, near modern Peking, but he seems to have
spent some twenty years as a wandering scholar who earned his living by
teaching mathematics, even though he had the opportunity to write two
treatises. The first of these, written in 1299, was the Suanxue qimeng
(Suan-hsueh ch’i-meng) (Introduction to Mathematical Studies), a
relatively elementary work that strongly influenced Korea and Japan,
although in China it was lost until it reappeared in the nineteenth
century. Of greater historical and mathematical interest is the Siyuan
yujian (Ssu-yuan yu-chien) (Jade Mirror of the Four Origins) of 1303. In
the eighteenth century, this, too, disappeared in China, only to be
rediscovered in the next century. The four origins, called heaven,
earth, man, and matter, are the representations of four unknown
quantities in the same equation.</p>
<p>The book marks the peak in the development of Chinese algebra, for it
deals with simultaneous equations and with equations of degrees as high
as fourteen. In it, the author describes a transformation method that he
calls fan fa, the elements of which seem to have arisen much earlier
than this in China, but which generally bears the name of Horner, who
lived half a millennium later. In solving the equation x2 1252x25,29250,
for example, Zhu Shijie first obtained x519 as an approximation (a root
lies between x519 and x520) and then used the fan fa, in this case the
transformation y5x219, to obtain the equation y2 1290y214350 (with a
root between y50 and y51). He then gave the root of the latter as
(approximately) y5143/(11290); hence, the corresponding value of x is
19. For the equation x3 257450, he used y5x28 to obtain y3 124y2
1192y26250, and he gave the root as x58162/</p>
<ol start="11241192" type="1">
<li>or x58. In some cases, he found decimal approximations.</li>
</ol>
<p>A few of the many summations of series found in the Jade Mirror are
the following:</p>
<p>2n11</p>
<p>12 122 132 1?1n2 5nðn11ÞðÞ</p>
<p>3!</p>
<p>1181301801?1n2ðn11Þð Þ n12</p>
<p>3!</p>
<p>4n11</p>
<p>5nðn11Þðn12Þðn13Þ3ðÞ:</p>
<p>5!</p>
<p>No proofs are given, however, nor does the topic seem to have been
continued again in China until about the nineteenth century. Zhu Shijie
handled his summations through the method of finite differences, some
elements of which seem to date in China from the seventh century, but
shortly after his work, the method disappeared for many centuries.</p>
<p>The Jade Mirror opens with a diagram of the arithmetic triangle,
inappropriately known in the West as “Pascal’s triangle.” (See the
following illustration.) In Zhu’s arrangement, we have the coefficients
of binomial expansions through the eighth power, clearly given in rod
numerals and a round zero symbol. Zhu disclaims credit for the triangle,
referring to it as a “diagram of the old method for finding eighth and
lower powers.” A similar arrangement of coefficients through the sixth
power had appeared in the work of Yang Hui, but without the round zero
symbol. There are references in Chinese works of about 1100 to
tabulation systems for binomial coefficients, and it is likely that the
arithmetic triangle originated in China by about that date. It is
interesting to note that the Chinese discovery of the binomial theorem
for integral powers was associated in its origin with root extractions,
rather than with powers. The equivalent of the theorem apparently was
known to Omar Khayyam at about the time that it was being used in China,
but the earliest extant</p>
<p>T hir t e ent h C entur y Mat he mat ic s</p>
<p>The “Pascal” triangle, as depicted in 1303 at the front of Zhu</p>
<p>Shijie’s Jade Mirror. It is titled “The Old Method Chart of the Seven
Multiplying Squares” and tabulates the binomial coeffi cients up to the
eighth power. (Reproduced from J. Needham</p>
<p>1959, Vol. 3, p. 135.)</p>
<p>Arabic work containing it is by al-Kashi in the fifteenth century. By
that time, Chinese mathematics had declined. Emphasis was placed once
again on the tradition of the Nine Chapters and the requirements of
commercial arithmetic. The impressive theoretical achievements, cloaked
in symbolic language that lent them an aura of mystery, would be revived
only after the more intense interaction with Western European
scholarship of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>

<h4 id="early-mathematics-in-india">Early Mathematics in India</h4>
<p>Archaeological excavations at Mohenjo Daro and Harappa give evidence
of an old and highly cultured civilization in the Indus Valley during
the era of the Egyptian pyramid builders (ca. 2650 BCE), but we have no
Indian mathematical documents from that age. There is evidence of
structured systems of weights and measures, and samples of decimalbased
numeration have been found. During this period and succeeding centuries,
however, major movements and conquests of people occurred on the Indian
subcontinent. Many of the languages and the dialects that evolved as a
result have not been deciphered. It is therefore difficult at this stage
to plot a time-space chart of mathematical activities for this vast
area. The linguistic challenges are compounded by the fact that the
earliest known Indian language samples were part of an oral tradition,
rather than a written one. Nevertheless, Vedic Sanskrit, the language
in</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>T he Sulbasutras</p>
<p>question, presents us with the earliest concrete information about
ancient Indian mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>The Vedas, groups of ancient, essentially religious texts, include
references to large numbers and decimal systems. Especially interesting
are dimensions, shapes, and proportions given for bricks used in the
construction of ritual fire altars. India, like Egypt, had its
“rope-stretchers,” and the sparse geometric lore acquired in connection
with the laying out of temples and the measurement and construction of
altars took the form of a body of knowledge known as the Sulbasutras, or
“rules of the cord.” Sulba (or sulva) refers to cords used for
measurements, and sutra means a book of rules or aphorisms relating to a
ritual or a science. The stretching of ropes is
strikinglyreminiscentoftheoriginofEgyptiangeometry,anditsassociation
with temple functions reminds one of the possible ritual origin of
mathematics. Yet, the difficulty of dating the rules is also matched by
doubt concerning the influence the Egyptians had on later Hindu
mathematicians. Even more so than in the case of China, there is a
striking lack of continuity of tradition in the mathematics of
India.</p>
<h4 id="the-sulbasutras">The Sulbasutras</h4>
<p>There are a number of Sulbasutras; the major extant ones, all in
verse, are associated with the names of Baudhayama, Manava, Katyayana,
and the best-known, Apastamba. They may date from the first half of the
first millennium BCE, although earlier and later dates have been
suggested as well. We find rules for the construction of right angles by
means of triples of cords the lengths of which form “Pythagorean”
triads, such as 3, 4, and 5; or 5, 12, and 13; or 8, 15, and 17; or 12,
35, and 37. Although Mesopotamian influence in the Sulbasutras is not
unlikely, we know of no conclusive evidence for or against this.
Apastamba knew that the square on the diagonal of a rectangle is equal
to the sum of the squares on the two adjacent sides. Less easily
explained is another rule given by Apastamba—one that strongly resembles
some of the geometric algebra in Book II of Euclid’s Elements. To
construct a square equal in area to the rectangle ABCD (Fig. 10.1), lay
off the shorter sides on the longer, so that AF5AB5BE5CD, and draw HG
bisecting segments CE and DF; extend EF to K, GH to L, and AB to M so
that FK5HL5FH5AM, and draw LKM. Now construct a rectangle with a
diagonal equal to LG and with a shorter side HFE. Then, the longer side
of this rectangle is the side of the square desired.</p>
<p>There are also rules for transforming rectilinear into curvilinear
shapes and vice versa. So conjectural are the origin and the period of
the Sulbasutras that we cannot tell whether the rules are related to
early Egyptian surveying or to the later Greek problem of altar
doubling.</p>

<h4 id="the-siddhantas">The Siddhantas</h4>
<p>There are references to arithmetic and geometric series in Vedic
literature that purport to go back to 2000 BCE, but no contemporary
documents from India are available to confirm this. It has also been
claimed that the first recognition of incommensurables is to be found in
India during the Sulbasutra period, but such claims are not well
substantiated. The period of the Sulbasutras was followed by the age of
the Siddhantas, or systems (of astronomy). Five different versions of
the Siddhantas are known by the names: Paulisha Siddhanta, Surya
Siddhanta, Vasisishta Siddhanta, Paitamaha Siddhanta, and Romanka
Siddhanta. Of these, the Surya</p>
<p>Siddhanta (System of the Sun), written about 400 CE, is the only one
that seems to be completely extant. According to the text, written in
epic stanzas, it is the work of Surya, the Sun God. The main
astronomical doctrines are evidently Greek, but with the retention of
considerable old Hindu folklore. The Paulisha Siddhanta, which dates
from about 380 CE, was summarized by the Hindu mathematician
Varahamihira (fl. 505 CE), who also listed the other four Siddhantas. It
was referred to frequently by the Arabic scholar al-Biruni, who
suggested a Greek origin or influence. Later writers report that the
Siddhantas were in substantial agreement on substance, only the
phraseology varied; hence, we can assume that the others, such as the
Surya Siddhanta, were compendia of astronomy comprising cryptic rules in
Sanskrit verse, with little explanation and without proof.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the Siddhantas stem from the late fourth
or the early fifth century, but there is sharp disagreement about the
origin of the knowledge that they contain. Indian scholars insist on the
originality and independence of the authors, whereas Western writers are
inclined to see definite signs of Greek influence. It is not unlikely,
for example, that the Paulisha Siddhanta was derived in considerable
measure from the work of the astrologer Paul, who lived in Alexandria
shortly before the presumed date of composition of the Siddhantas.</p>
<p>Ar yabhat a</p>
<p>(Al-Biruni, in fact, explicitly attributes this Siddhanta to Paul of
Alexandria.) This would account in a simple manner for the obvious
similarities between portions of the Siddhantas and the trigonometry and
the astronomy of Ptolemy. The Paulisha Siddhanta, for example, uses the
value 3 177/1250 for π, which is in essential agreement with the
Ptolemaic sexagesimal value 3;8,30.</p>
<p>Even if Indian authors did acquire their knowledge of trigonometry
from the cosmopolitan Hellenism at Alexandria, the material in their
hands took on a significantly new form. Whereas the trigonometry of
Ptolemy had been based on the functional relationship between the chords
of a circle and the central angles they subtend, the writers of the
Siddhantas converted this to a study of the correspondence between half
of a chord of a circle and half of the angle subtended at the center by
the whole chord. Thus was born, apparently in India, the predecessor of
the modern trigonometric function known as the sine of an angle, and the
introduction of the sine function represents the chief contribution of
the Siddhantas to the history of mathematics. It was through the
Indians, and not the Greeks, that our use of the half chord has been
derived, and our word “sine,” through misadventure in translation (see
further on), has descended from the Sanskrit name jiva.</p>
<h4 id="aryabhata">Aryabhata</h4>
<p>During the sixth century, shortly after the composition of the
Siddhantas, there lived two Indian mathematicians who are known to have
written books on the same type of material. The older and more important
of the two was Aryabhata, whose best-known work, written around 499 CE
and titled Aryabhatiya, is a slim volume, written in verse, covering
astronomy and mathematics. The names of several Hindu mathematicians
before this time are known, but nothing of their work has been preserved
beyond a few fragments. In this respect, then, the position of the
Aryabhatiya of Aryabhata in India is somewhat akin to that of the
Elements of Euclid in Greece some eight centuries earlier. Both are
summaries of earlier developments, compiled by a single author. There
are, however, more striking differences than similarities between the
two works. The Elements is a well-ordered synthesis of pure mathematics
with a high degree of abstraction, a clear logical structure, and an
obvious pedagogical inclination; the Aryabhatiya is a brief descriptive
work, in 123 metrical stanzas, intended to supplement rules of
calculation used in astronomy and mensurational mathematics, with no
appearance of deductive methodology. About a third of the work is on
ganitapada, or mathematics. This section opens with the names of the
powers of 10 up to the tenth place and then proceeds to give
instructions for square and cube roots of integers. Rules of mensuration
follow, about half of which are erroneous. The area of a triangle is
correctly given as half the product of the base and altitude, but the
volume of a pyramid is also taken to be half of the product of the base
and the altitude. The area of a circle is found correctly as the product
of the circumference and half of the diameter, but the volume of a
sphere is incorrectly stated to be the product of the area of a great
circle and the square root of this area. Again, in the calculation of
areas of quadrilaterals, correct and incorrect rules appear side by
side. The area of a trapezoid is expressed as half of the sum of the
parallel sides multiplied by the perpendicular between them, but then
follows the incomprehensible assertion that the area of any plane figure
is found by determining two sides and multiplying them. One statement in
the Aryabhatiya to which Indian scholars have pointed with pride is as
follows:</p>
<p>Add 4 to 100, multiply by 8, and add 62,000. The result is
approximately the circumference of a circle of which the diameter is
20,000. (Clark 1930, p. 28)</p>
<p>Here we see the equivalent of 3.1416 for π, but it should be recalled
that this is essentially the value Ptolemy had used. The likelihood that
Aryabhata here was influenced by Greek predecessors is strengthened by
his adoption of the myriad, 10,000, as the number of units in the
radius.</p>
<p>A typical portion of the Aryabhatiya is that involving arithmetic
progressions, which contains arbitrary rules for finding the sum of the
terms in a progression and for determining the number of terms in a
progression when given the first term, the common difference, and the
sum of the terms. The first rule had long been known by earlier writers.
The second is a curiously complicated bit of exposition:</p>
<p>Multiply the sum of the progression by eight times the common
difference, add the square of the difference between twice the first
term, and the common difference, take the square root of this, subtract
twice the first term, divide by the common difference, add one, divide
by two. The result will be the number of terms.</p>
<p>Here, as elsewhere in the Aryabhatiya, no motivation or justification
is given for the rule. It was probably arrived at through a solution of
a quadratic equation, knowledge of which might have come from
Mesopotamia or Greece. Following some complicated problems on compound
interest (that is, geometric progressions), the author turns, in flowery
language, to the very elementary problem of finding the fourth term in a
simple proportion:</p>
<p>In the rule of three multiply the fruit by the desire and divide by
the measure. The result will be the fruit of the desire.</p>
<p>Numeral s</p>
<p>This, of course, is the familiar rule that if a/b5c/x, then x5bc/a,
where a is the “measure,” b the “fruit,” c the “desire,” and x the
“fruit of the desire.” The work of Aryabhata is indeed a potpourri of
the simple and the complex, the correct and the incorrect. The Arabic
scholar alBiruni, half a millennium later, characterized Indian
mathematics as a mixture of common pebbles and costly crystals, a
description quite appropriate to Aryabhatiya.</p>
<h4 id="numerals">Numerals</h4>
<p>The second half of the Aryabhatiya is on the reckoning of time and on
spherical trigonometry; here we note an element that would leave a
permanent impression on the mathematics of later generations—the decimal
place-value numeration. It is not known just how Aryabhata carried out
his calculations, but his phrase “from place to place each is ten times
the preceding” is an indication that the application of the principle of
position was in his mind. “Local value” had been an essential part of
Babylonian numeration, and perhaps the Hindus were becoming aware of its
applicability to the decimal notation for integers in use in India. The
development of numerical notations in India seems to have followed about
the same pattern found in Greece. Inscriptions from the earliest period
at Mohenjo Daro show at first simple vertical strokes, arranged into
groups, but by the time of Asoka (third century BCE) a system resembling
the Herodianic was in use. In the newer scheme the repetitive principle
was continued, but new symbols of higher order were adopted for 4, 10,
20, and 100. This so-called Karosthi script then gradually gave way to
another notation, known as the Brahmi characters, which resembled the
alphabetic cipherization in the Greek Ionian system; one wonders whether
it was only a coincidence that the change in India took place shortly
after the period when in Greece the Herodianic numerals were displaced
by the Ionian.</p>
<p>From the Brahmi ciphered numerals to our present-day notation for
integers, two short steps are needed. The first is a recognition that
through the use of the positional principle, the ciphers for the first
nine units can also serve as the ciphers for the corresponding multiples
of 10 or equally well as ciphers for the corresponding multiples of any
power of 10. This recognition would make superfluous all of the Brahmi
ciphers beyond the first nine. It is not known when the reduction to
nine ciphers occurred, and it is likely that the transition to the more
economical notation was made only gradually. It appears from extant
evidence that the change took place in India, but the source of the
inspiration for the change is uncertain. Possibly, the so-called Hindu
numerals were the result of internal development alone; perhaps they
developed first along the western interface between India and Persia,
where remembrance of the Babylonian positional notation may have led to
modification of the Brahmi system. It is possible that the newer system
arose along the eastern interface with China, where the pseudopositional
rod numerals may have suggested the reduction to nine ciphers. There is
also a theory that this reduction may first have been made at Alexandria
within the Greek alphabetic system and that subsequently the idea spread
to India. During the later Alexandrian period, the earlier Greek habit
of writing common fractions with the numerator beneath the denominator
was reversed, and it is this form that was adopted by the Hindus,
without the bar between the two. Unfortunately, the Hindus did not apply
the new numeration for integers to the realm of decimal fractions;
hence, the chief potential advantage of the change from Ionian notation
was lost.</p>
<p>The earliest specific reference to the Hindu numerals is found in 662
in the writings of Severus Sebokt, a Syrian bishop. After Justinian
closed the Athenian philosophical schools, some of the scholars moved to
Syria, where they established centers of Greek learning. Sebokt
evidently felt piqued by the disdain for non-Greek learning expressed by
some associates; hence, he found it expedient to remind those who spoke
Greek that “there are also others who know something.” To illustrate his
point, he called attention to the Hindus and their “subtle discoveries
in astronomy,” especially “their valuable methods of calculation, and
their computing that surpasses description. I wish only to say that this
computation is done by means of nine signs” (Smith 1958, Vol. I,
p. 167). That the numerals had been in use for some time is indicated by
the fact that they occur on an Indian plate of the year 595 CE, where
the date 346 is written in decimal place value notation.</p>
<p>The Symbol for Zero</p>
<p>It should be remarked that the reference to nine symbols, rather than
ten, implies that the Hindus evidently had not yet taken the second step
in the transition to the modern system of numeration—the introduction of
a notation for a missing position—that is, a zero symbol. The history of
mathematics holds many anomalies, and not the least of these is the fact
that “the earliest undoubted occurrence of a zero in India is in an
inscription of 876” (Smith 1958, Vol. II, p. 69)—that is, more than two
centuries after the first reference to the other nine numerals. It is
not even established that the number zero (as distinct from a symbol for
an empty position) arose in conjunction with the other nine Hindu
numerals. It is quite possible that zero originated in the Greek world,
perhaps at Alexandria, and that it was transmitted to India after the
decimal positional system had been established there.</p>
<p>Tr igonome tr y</p>
<p>The history of the zero placeholder in positional notation is further
complicated by the fact that the concept appeared independently, well
before the days of Columbus, in the western as well as the eastern
hemisphere.</p>
<p>With the introduction, in the Hindu notation, of the tenth numeral, a
round goose egg for zero, the modern system of numeration for integers
was completed. Although the medieval Hindu forms of the ten numerals
differ considerably from those in use today, the principles of the
system were established. The new numeration, which we generally call the
Hindu system, is merely a new combination of three basic principles, all
of ancient origin: (1) a decimal base; (2) a positional notation; and
(3) a ciphered form for each of the ten numerals. Not one of these three
was originally devised by the Hindus, but it presumably is due to them
that the three were first linked to form the modern system of
numeration.</p>
<p>It may be well to say a word about the form of the Hindu symbol for
zero—which is also ours. It was once assumed that the round form
originally stemmed from the Greek letter omicron, the initial letter in
the word “ouden,” or “empty,” but recent investigations seem to belie
such an origin. Although the symbol for an empty position in some of the
extant versions of Ptolemy’s tables of chords does seem to resemble an
omicron, the early zero symbols in Greek sexagesimal fractions are round
forms variously embellished and differing markedly from a simple goose
egg. Moreover, when in the fifteenth century in the Byzantine Empire a
decimal positional system was fashioned out of the old alphabetic
numerals by dropping the last eighteen letters and adding a zero symbol
to the first nine letters, the zero sign took forms quite unlike an
omicron. Sometimes it resembled an inverted form of our small letter h;
other times, it appeared as a dot.</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The development of our system of notation for integers was one of the
two most influential contributions of India to the history of
mathematics. The other was the introduction of an equivalent of the sine
function in trigonometry to replace the Greek tables of chords. The
earliest tables of the sine relationship that have survived are those in
the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya. Here the sines of angles up to 90
are given for twenty-four equal intervals of 3 each. In order to express
arc length and sine length in terms of the same unit, the radius was
taken as 3,438 and the circumference as 360 60521,600. This implies a
value of π agreeing to four significant figures with that of Ptolemy. In
another connection, Aryabhata used the value p10 for π, which appeared
so frequently in India that it is sometimes known as the Hindu
value.</p>
<p>For the sine of 3, the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya took the number
of units in the arc—that is, 60 3 3 or 225. In modern language, the sine
of a small angle is very nearly equal to the radian measure of the angle
(which is virtually what the Hindus were using). For further items in
the sine table, the Hindus used a recursion formula that may be
expressed as follows. If the nth sine in the sequence from n51 to n524
is designated as sn, and if the sum of the first n sines is Sn, then
sn11 5sn 1s1 2Sn /s1. From this rule, one easily deduces that sin7 5449,
sin 11 5671, sin 15 5890, and so on, up to sin90 53,438—the values
listed in the table in the Siddhantas and the Aryabhatiya. Moreover, the
table also includes values for what we call the versed sine of the angle
(that is, 12cos θ in modern trigonometry or 3,438 〔12cosθ〕 in Hindu
trigonometry) from vers 3 57 to vers 90 53,438. If we divide the items
in the table by 3,438, the results are found to be in close agreement
with the corresponding values in modern trigonometric tables (Smith
1958, Vol. II).</p>
<h4 id="multiplication">Multiplication</h4>
<p>Trigonometry was evidently a useful and accurate tool in astronomy.
How the Indians arrived at results such as the recursion formula is
uncertain, but it has been suggested that an intuitive approach to
difference equations and interpolation may have prompted such rules.
Indian mathematics is frequently described as “intuitive,” in contrast
to the stern rationalism of Greek geometry. Although in Indian
trigonometry there is evidence of Greek influence, the Indians seem to
have had no occasion to borrow Greek geometry, concerned as they were
with simple mensurational rules. Of the classical geometric problems or
the study of curves other than the circle, there is little evidence in
India, and even the conic sections seem to have been overlooked by the
Indians, as by the Chinese. Hindu mathematicians were instead fascinated
by work with numbers, whether it involved the ordinary arithmetic
operations or the solution of determinate or indeterminate equations.
Addition and multiplication were carried out in India much as they are
by us today, except that the Indians seem at first to have preferred to
write numbers with the smaller units on the left, hence to work from
left to right, using small blackboards with white removable paint or a
board covered with sand or flour. Among the devices used for
multiplication was one that is known under various names: lattice
multiplication, gelosia multiplication, or cell or grating or
quadrilateral multiplication. The scheme behind this is readily
recognized in two examples. In the first example (Fig. 10.2), the number
456 is multiplied by 34. The multiplicand has been written above the
lattice and the multiplier appears to the left, with the partial
products occupying the square cells. Digits in the diagonal rows are
added, and the product 15,504 is read off at the bottom and the right.

<p>are possible, a second example is given in Fig. 10.3, in which the
multiplicand 537 is placed at the top, the multiplier 24 is on the
right, and the product 12,888 appears to the left and along the bottom.
Still other modifications are easily devised. In fundamental principle,
gelosia multiplication is, of course, the same as our own, the cell
arrangement being merely a convenient device for relieving the mental
concentration called for in “carrying over” from place to place the 10s
arising in the partial products. The only “carrying” required in lattice
multiplication is in the final additions along the diagonals.</p>
<h4 id="long-division">Long Division</h4>
<p>It is not known when or where gelosia multiplication arose, but India
seems to be the most likely source. It was used there at least by the
twelfth century, and from India, it seems to have been carried to China
and Arabia. From the Arabs, it passed over to Italy in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, where the name gelosia was attached to it
because of the resemblance to gratings placed on windows in Venice and
elsewhere. (The current word “jalousie” seems to stem from the Italian
gelosia and is used for Venetian blinds in France, Germany, Holland, and
Russia.) The Arabs (and, through them, the later Europeans) appear to
have adopted most of their arithmetic devices from the Hindus, so it is
likely that the pattern of long division known as the “scratch method”
or the “galley method” (from its resemblance to a boat) also came from
India. (See the following illustration.) To illustrate the method, let
it be required to divide 44,977 by 382. In Fig. 10.4 we give the modern
method, in Fig. 10.5 the galley method. The latter closely parallels the
former, except that the dividend appears in the middle, for subtractions
are performed by canceling digits and placing differences above, rather
than below, the minuends. Hence, the remainder, 283, appears above and
to the right, rather than below.</p>
<p>The process in Fig. 10.5 is easy to follow if we note that the digits
in a given subtrahend, such as 2,674, or in a given difference, such as
2,957, are not necessarily all in the same row and that subtrahends are
written below the middle and differences above the middle. Position in a
column</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>FIG. 10.4</p>
<p>is significant, but not position in a row. The determination of roots
of numbers probably followed a somewhat similar “galley” pattern,
coupled in the later years with the binomial theorem in “Pascal
triangle” form, but Indian writers did not provide explanations for
their calculations or proofs for their statements. It is possible that

<p>Chinese influences played a role in the problem of evolution or root
extraction. It is often said that the “proof by nines,” or the “casting
out of nines,” is a Hindu invention, but it appears that the Greeks knew
earlier of this property, without using it extensively, and that the
method came into common use only with the Arabs of the eleventh
century.</p>
<h4 id="brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</h4>
<p>The last few paragraphs may leave the unwarranted impression that
there was a uniformity in Hindu mathematics, for we have frequently
localized developments as merely “of Indian origin,” without specifying
the period. The trouble is that there is a high degree of uncertainty in
Hindu chronology. Material in the important Bakshali manuscript,
containing an anonymous arithmetic, is supposed by some to date from the
third or fourth century, by others from the sixth century, and by others
from the eighth or ninth century or later, and there is a suggestion
that it may not even be of Hindu origin. We have placed the work of
Aryabhata around the year 500 CE, but there were two mathematicians
named Aryabhata, and we cannot with certainty ascribe results to our
Aryabhata, the elder. Hindu mathematics presents more historical
problems than does Greek mathematics, for Indian authors referred to
predecessors infrequently, and they exhibited surprising independence in
mathematical approach. Thus, it is that Brahmagupta (fl. 628 CE), who
lived in Central India somewhat more than a century after Aryabhata, has
little in common with his predecessor, who had lived in eastern India.
Brahmagupta mentions two values of π—the “practical value” 3 and the
“neat value” p10—but not the more accurate value of Aryabhata; in the
trigonometry of his best-known work, the Brahmasphuta Siddhanta, he
adopted a radius of 3,270, instead of Aryabhata’s 3,438. In one respect,
he does resemble his predecessor—in the juxtaposition of good and bad
results. He found the “gross” area of an isosceles triangle by
multiplying half of the base by one of the equal sides; for the scalene
triangle with base fourteen and sides thirteen and fifteen, he found the
“gross area” by multiplying half of the base by the arithmetic mean of
the other sides. In finding the “exact” area, he used the
Archimedean-Heronian formula. For the radius of the circle circumscribed
about a triangle, he gave the equivalent of the correct trigonometric
result 2R5a/sin A5b/sin B5 c/sin C, but this, of course, is only a
reformulation of a result known to Ptolemy in the language of chords.
Perhaps the most beautiful result in Brahmagupta’s work is the
generalization of “Heron’s” formula in finding the area of a
quadrilateral. This formula,</p>
<p>K 5pðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞðs2dÞ</p>
<p>where a, b, c, d are the sides and s is the semiperimeter, still
bears his name, but the glory of his achievement is dimmed by failure to
remark that the formula is correct only in the case of a cyclic
quadrilateral. The correct formula for an arbitrary quadrilateral is</p>
<p>K 5pðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞðs2dÞ2abcd cos2 α</p>
<p>where α is half of the sum of two opposite angles. As a rule for the
“gross” area of a quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave the pre-Hellenic
formula, the product of the arithmetic means of the opposite sides. For
the quadrilateral with sides a525, b525, c525, d539, for example, he
found a “gross” area of 800.</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s Formula</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s contributions to algebra are of a higher order than are
his rules of mensuration, for here we find general solutions of
quadratic equations, including two roots even in cases in which one of
them is negative.</p>
<p>The systematized arithmetic of negative numbers and zero is, in fact,
first found in his work. The equivalents of rules on negative magnitudes
were known through the Greek geometric theorems on subtraction, such as
(a2b)(c2d)5ac1bd2ad2be, but the Indians converted these into numerical
rules on positive and negative numbers. Moreover, although the Greeks
had a concept of nothingness, they never interpreted this as a number,
as did the Indians. Yet here again Brahmagupta spoiled matters somewhat
by asserting that 0 4 050, and on the touchy matter of a40, for a 6¼ 0,
he did not commit himself:</p>
<p>Positive divided by positive, or negative by negative, is
affirmative. Cipher divided by cipher is naught. Positive divided by
negative is negative. Negative divided by affirmative is negative.
Positive or negative divided by cipher is a fraction with that for
denominator. (Colebrook 1817, Vol. I)</p>
<p>Ind e t er minat e Equat ions</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Hindus, unlike the Greeks,
regarded irrational roots of numbers as numbers. This was of enormous
help in algebra, and Indian mathematicians have been much praised for
taking this step. We have seen the lack of nice distinction on the part
of Hindu mathematicians between exact and inexact results, and it was
only natural that they should not have taken seriously the difference
between commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes. For them, there
was no impediment to the acceptance of irrational numbers, and later
generations uncritically followed their lead until in the
nineteenth-century mathematicians established the real number system on
a sound basis.</p>
<p>Indian mathematics was, as we have said, a mixture of good and bad.
But some of the good was superlatively good, and here Brahmagupta
deserves high praise. Hindu algebra is especially noteworthy in its
development of indeterminate analysis, to which Brahmagupta made several
contributions. For one thing, in his work we find a rule for the
formation of Pythagorean triads expressed in the form2 m, ðm2=n2nÞ, ðm
=n1nÞ, but this is only a modified form of the old Babylonian rule, with
which he may have become familiar. Brahmagupta’s area formula for a
quadrilateral, mentioned previously, was used by him in conjunction with
the formulas</p>
<p>pðab1cdÞðac1bdÞ=ðad1bcÞ and pðac1bdÞðad1bcÞ=ðab1cdÞ</p>
<p>for the diagonals to find quadrilaterals whose sides, diagonals, and
areas are all rational. Among them was the quadrilateral with sides
a552, b525, c539, d560, and diagonals 63 and 56. Brahmagupta gave the
“gross” area as 1;933, despite the fact that his formula provides the
exact area, 1,764 in this case.</p>
<h4 id="indeterminate-equations">Indeterminate Equations</h4>
<p>Like many of his countrymen, Brahmagupta evidently loved mathematics
for its own sake, for no practical-minded engineer would raise questions
such as those Brahmagupta asked about quadrilaterals. One admires his
mathematicalattitudeevenmorewhenonefindsthathewasapparentlythe first one
to give a general solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax1by5c,
where a, b, and c are integers. For this equation to have integral
solutions, the greatest common divisor of a and b must divide c, and
Brahmagupta knew that if a and b are relatively prime, all solutions of
the equation are given by x5p1mb, y5q2ma, where m is an arbitrary
integer.He alsosuggestedtheDiophantinequadraticequationx2 511py2, which
was mistakenly named for John Pell (1611 1685) but first appeared in the
Archimedean cattle problem. The Pell equation was solved for some cases
by Brahmagupta’s countryman Bhaskara (1114 ca. 1185). It is
greatlytothecreditofBrahmaguptathathegave all integralsolutionsofthe
linearDiophantineequation,whereasDiophantushimselfhadbeensatisfied to
give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as
Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again
the likelihood of Greek influence in India—or the possibility that they
both madeuseofacommonsource,possiblyfromBabylonia.Itisalsointeresting to
note that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was
syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by
placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor
below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar.
The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as
well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of
appropriate words.</p>
<h4 id="bhaskara">Bhaskara</h4>
<p>India produced a number of later medieval mathematicians, but we
shall describe the work of only one of these—Bhaskara, the leading
mathematician of the twelfth century. It was he who filled some of the
gaps in Brahmagupta’s work, as by giving a general solution of the Pell
equation and by considering the problem of division by zero. Aristotle
had once remarked that there is no ratio by which a number such as 4
exceeds the number zero, but the arithmetic of zero had not been part of
Greek mathematics, and Brahmagupta had been noncommittal on the division
of a number other than zero by the number zero. It is therefore in
Bhaskara’s Vija-Ganita that we find the first statement that such a
quotient is infinite.</p>
<p>Statement: Dividend 3. Divisor 0. Quotient the fraction 3/0. This
fraction of which the denominator is cipher, is termed an infinite
quantity. In this quantity consisting of that which has cipher for a
divisor, there is no alteration, though many be inserted or extracted;
as no change takes place in the infinite and immutable God.</p>
<p>This statement sounds promising, but a lack of clear understanding of
the situation is suggested by Bhaskara’s further assertion that a/0
05a.</p>
<p>Bhaskara was one of the last significant medieval mathematicians from
India, and his work represents the culmination of earlier Hindu
contributions. In his best-known treatise, the Lilavati, he compiled
problems from Brahmagupta and others, adding new observations of his
own. The very title of this book may be taken to indicate the uneven
quality of Indian thought, for the name in the title is that of
Bhaskara’s daughter, who, according to legend, lost the opportunity to
marry because of her father’s confidence in his astrological
predictions. Bhaskara had calculated that his daughter might
propitiously marry only at one particular</p>
<p>B ha sk ara</p>
<p>hour on a given day. On what was to have been her wedding day, the
eager girl was bending over the water clock, as the hour for the
marriage approached, when a pearl from her headdress fell, quite
unnoticed, and stopped the outflow of water. Before the mishap was
noted, the propitious hour had passed. To console the unhappy girl, the
father gave her name to the book we are describing.</p>
<p>The Lilavati</p>
<p>The Lilavati, like the Vija-Ganita, contains numerous problems
dealing with favorite Hindu topics: linear and quadratic equations, both
determinate and indeterminate; simple mensuration; arithmetic and
geometric progressions; surds; Pythagorean triads; and others. The
“broken bamboo” problem, popular in China (and also included by
Brahmagupta), appears in the following form: if a bamboo 32 cubits high
is broken by the wind so that the tip meets the ground 16 cubits from
the base, at what height above the ground was it broken? Also making use
of the Pythagorean theorem is the following problem: A peacock is
perched atop a pillar at the base of which is a snake’s hole. Seeing the
snake at a distance from the pillar, which is three times the height of
the pillar, the peacock pounces on the snake in a straight line before
it can reach its hole. If the peacock and the snake have gone equal
distances, how many cubits from the hole do they meet?</p>
<p>These two problems well illustrate the heterogeneous nature of the
Lilavati, for despite their apparent similarity and the fact that only a
single answer is required, one of the problems is determinate and the
other is indeterminate. In the treating of the circle and the sphere,
the Lilavati also fails to distinguish between exact and approximate
statements. The area of the circle is correctly given as one-quarter the
circumference multiplied by the diameter and the volume of the sphere as
one-sixth the product of the surface area and the diameter, but for the
ratio of circumference to diameter in a circle, Bhaskara suggests either
3,927 to 1,250 or the “gross” value 22/7. The former is equivalent to
the ratio mentioned, but not used, by Aryabhata. There is no hint in
Bhaskara or other Hindu writers that they were aware that all ratios
that had been proposed were only approximations. Yet, Bhaskara severely
condemns his predecessors for using the formulas of Brahmagupta for the
area and the diagonals of a general quadrilateral, because he saw that a
quadrilateral is not uniquely determined by its sides. Evidently, he did
not realize that the formulas are indeed exact for all cyclic
quadrilaterals.</p>
<p>Many of Bhaskara’s problems in the Lilavati and the Vija-Ganita were
evidently derived from earlier Hindu sources; hence, it is no surprise
to note that the author is at his best in dealing with indeterminate
analysis. In connection with the Pell equation, x2 511py2, proposed
earlier by Brahmagupta, Bhaskara gave particular solutions for the five
cases p58, 11, 32, 61, and 67. For x2 51161y2, for example, he gave the
solution x51,776,319,049 and y522,615,390. This is an impressive feat in
calculation, and its verification alone will tax the efforts of the
reader. Bhaskara’s books are replete with other instances of Diophantine
problems.</p>
<h4 id="madhava-and-the-keralese-school">Madhava and the Keralese
School</h4>
<p>Beginning in the late fourteenth century, a group of mathematicians
emerged along the southwestern coast of India and came to be known as
members of the “Keralese School,” named after their geographic location
of Kerala. The group appears to have started under the leadership of
Madhava, who is best known for his expansion of the power series for
sines and cosines that is usually named after Newton and the series for
π/4 credited to Leibniz. Among his other contributions are a computation
of π that is accurate to eleven decimal places, computation of the
circumference of a circle using polygons, and expansion of the
arctangent series usually attributed to James Gregory, as well as
various other series expansions and astronomical applications.</p>
<p>Few of Madhava’s original verses have been documented; most of his
work has come down to us through descriptions and references by his
students and other later members of the Keralese school.</p>
<p>The Keralese school, with its astonishing achievements in series
expansions and geometric, arithmetic, and trigonometric procedures, as
well as astronomical observations, has inspired considerable speculation
concerning transmission and influence. Until now, there is inadequate
documentation to support any of the related major conjectures. There is,
however, a great deal to be learned from recent translations of these
and prior texts. (We have given only a few examples of results usually
associated with the seventeenth-century giants of western Europe. For
samples of translations providing a closer appreciation of the nature of
the mathematical issues found in the ancient and medieval Sanskrit
texts, the reader is referred to Plofker 2009.)</p>
<h2 id="the-islamic-hegemony">11 The Islamic Hegemony</h2>
<p>Ah, but my Computations, People say, Have squared the Year to human

<p>Omar Khayyam (Rubaiyat in the FitzGerald version)</p>
<h4 id="arabic-conquests">Arabic Conquests</h4>
<p>One of the most transformative developments affecting mathematics in
the Middle Ages was the remarkable spread of Islam. Within one century
from 622 CE, the year of the prophet Mohammed’s Hegira, Islam had
expanded from Arabia to Persia, to North Africa, and to Spain.</p>
<p>At the time that Brahmagupta was writing, the Sabean Empire of Arabia
Felix had fallen, and the peninsula was in a severe crisis. It was
inhabited largely by desert nomads, known as Bedouins, who could neither
read nor write. Among them was the prophet Mohammed, born in Mecca in
about 570. During his journeys, Mohammed came in contact with Jews and
Christians, and the amalgam of religious feelings that were raised in
his mind led to the belief that he was the apostle of God sent to lead
his people. For some ten years, he preached at Mecca but in 622,</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>faced by a plot on his life, he accepted an invitation to Medina.
This “flight,” known as the Hegira, marked the beginning of the
Mohammedan era—one that was to exert a strong influence on the
development of mathematics. Mohammed now became a military, as well as a
religious, leader. Ten years later, he had established a Mohammedan
state, with its center at Mecca, within which Jews and Christians, being
also monotheistic, were afforded protection and freedom of worship. In
632, while planning to move against the Byzantine Empire, Mohammed died
in Medina. His sudden death in no way impeded the expansion of the
Islamic state, for his followers overran neighboring territories with
astonishing rapidity. Within a few years, Damascus and Jerusalem and
much of the Mesopotamian Valley fell to the conquerors; by 641,
Alexandria, which for many years had been the mathematical center of the
world, was captured. As happens so often in these conquests, the books
in the library were burned. The extent of the damage done at that time
is unclear; it has been assumed that following depredations by earlier
military and religious fanatics and long ages of sheer neglect, there
may have been relatively few books left to fuel the flames in the
library that had once been the greatest in the world.</p>
<p>For more than a century, the Arab conquerors fought among themselves
and with their enemies, until by about 750 the warlike spirit subsided.
By this time, a schism had arisen between the western Arabs in Morocco
and the eastern Arabs, who, under the caliph al-Mansur, had established
a new capital at Baghdad, a city that was shortly to become the new
center for mathematics. Yet the caliph at Baghdad could not even command
the allegiance of all Moslems in the eastern half of his empire,
although his name appeared on coins of the realm and was included in the
prayers of his “subjects.” The unity of the Arab world, in other words,
was more economic and religious than it was political. Arabic was not
necessarily the common language, although it was a kind of lingua franca
for intellectuals. Hence, it may be more appropriate to speak of the
culture as Islamic, rather than Arabic, although we shall use the terms
more or less interchangeably.</p>
<p>During the first century of the Arabic conquests, there had been
political and intellectual confusion, and possibly this accounts for the
difficulty in localizing the origin of the modern system of numeration.
The Arabs were at first without known intellectual interest, and they
had little culture, beyond a language, to impose on the peoples they
conquered. In this respect, we see a repetition of the situation when
Rome conquered Greece, of which it was said that in a cultural sense,
captive Greece took captive the captor Rome. By about 750 CE, the Arabs
were ready to have history repeat itself, for the conquerors became
eager to absorb the learning of the civilizations they had overrun. We
learn that by the 770s, an astronomical-mathematical work known to the
Arabs as the Sindhind was brought to Baghdad</p>
<p>T he Hous e of W i s dom</p>
<p>from India. A few years later, perhaps about 775, this Siddhanta was
translated into Arabic, and it was not long afterward (ca. 780) that
Ptolemy’s astrological Tetrabiblos was translated into Arabic from the
Greek. Alchemy and astrology were among the first studies to appeal to
the dawning intellectual interests of the conquerors. The “Arabic
miracle” lies not so much in the rapidity with which the political
empire rose, as in the alacrity with which, their tastes once aroused,
the Arabs absorbed the learning of their neighbors.</p>
<h4 id="the-house-of-wisdom">The House of Wisdom</h4>
<p>The first century of the Muslim Empire had been devoid of scientific
achievement. This period (from about 650 to 750) had been, in fact,
perhaps the nadir in the development of mathematics, for the Arabs had
not yet achieved intellectual drive, and concern for learning in other
parts of the world had pretty much faded. Had it not been for the sudden
cultural awakening in Islam during the second half of the eighth
century, considerably more of ancient science and mathematics would have
been lost. To Baghdad at that time were called scholars from Syria,
Iran, and Mesopotamia, including Jews and Nestorian Christians; under
three great Abbasid patrons of learning—al-Mansur, Haroun al-Raschid,
and al-Mamun—the city became a new Alexandria. During the reign of the
second of these caliphs, familiar to us today through the Arabian
Nights, part of Euclid was translated. It was during the caliphate of
al-Mamun (809 833), however, that the Arabs fully indulged their passion
for translation. The caliph is said to have had a dream in which
Aristotle appeared, and as a consequence alMamun determined to have
Arabic versions made of all of the Greek works he could lay his hands
on, including Ptolemy’s Almagest and a complete version of Euclid’s
Elements. From the Byzantine Empire, with which the Arabs maintained an
uneasy peace, Greek manuscripts were obtained through treaties.</p>
<p>Al-Mamun established in Baghdad a “House of Wisdom” (Bait al-hikma)
comparable to the ancient Museum in Alexandria. Major emphasis from its
beginning was placed on translations, initially from Persian to Arabic,
laterfromSanskritandGreek.Gradually,theHouseofWisdomincludeda collection
of ancient manuscripts, obtained largely from Byzantine sources.
Finally, an observatory was added to the institutional holdings. Among
the mathematicians and astronomers there, we note Mohammed ibn Musa
al-Khwarizmi, whose name, like that of Euclid, was later to become a
household word in Western Europe. Others active in the ninth century of
translation were the brothers Banu Musa, al Kindi, and Thabit ibn Qurra.
By the thirteenth century, during the Mongol invasion of Baghdad, the
library of the House of Wisdom was destroyed; this time, we are told,
books were not burned but thrown into the river, which was equally
effective because water quickly washed out the ink.</p>
<h4 id="al-khwarizmi">Al-Khwarizmi</h4>
<p>Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (ca. 780 ca. 850) wrote more than half
a dozen astronomical and mathematical works, of which the earliest were
probably based on the Sindhind. Besides astronomical tables and
treatises on the astrolabe and the sundial, al-Khwarizmi wrote two books
on arithmetic and algebra that played very important roles in the
history of mathematics. One of these survives only in a unique copy of a
Latin translation with the title De numero indorum, the original Arabic
version having since been lost. In this work, based presumably on an
Arabic translation of Brahmagupta, al-Khwarizmi gave so full an account
of the Hindu numerals that he is probably responsible for the widespread
but false impression that our system of numeration is Arabic in origin.
Al-Khwarizmi made no claim to originality in connection with the system,
the Hindu source of which he assumed as a matter of course, but when
Latin translations of his work subsequently appeared in Europe, cursory
readers began to attribute not only the book but also the numeration to
the author. The new notation came to be known as that of al-Khwarizmi
or, more carelessly, algorismi; ultimately, the scheme of numeration
that made use of the Hindu numerals came to be called simply “algorism”
or “algorithm,” a word that, originally derived from the name
al-Khwarizmi, now means, more generally, any peculiar rule of procedure
or operation—such as the Euclidean method for finding the greatest
common divisor.</p>
<p>Al-Jabr</p>
<p>Through his arithmetic, al-Khwarizmi’s name has become a common
English word; through the title of his most important book, Hisob
al-jabr wa’l muqabalah, he has supplied us with an even more popular
household term. From this title has come the word “algebra,” for it is
from this book that Europe later learned the branch of mathematics
bearing this name. Neither al-Khwarizmi nor other Arabic scholars made
use of syncopation or of negative numbers. Nevertheless, the Al-jabr
comes closer to the elementary algebra of today than do the works of
either Diophantus or Brahmagupta, for the book is not concerned with
difficult problems in indeterminate analysis but with a straightforward
and elementary exposition of the solution of equations, especially of
the second degree. The Arabs in general loved a good clear argument from
premise to conclusion, as well as systematic organization—respects in
which</p>
<p>neither Diophantus nor the Hindus excelled. The Hindus were strong in
association and analogy, in intuition and an aesthetic and imaginative
flair, whereas the Arabs were more practical-minded and down-to-earth in
their approach to mathematics.</p>
<p>The Al-jabr has come down to us in two versions, Latin and Arabic,
but in the Latin translation, Liber algebrae et al mucabala, a
considerable portion of the Arabic draft is missing. The Latin, for
example, has no preface, perhaps because the author’s preface in Arabic
gave fulsome praise to Mohammed, the prophet, and to al-Mamun, “the
Commander of the Faithful.” Al-Khwarizmi wrote that the latter had
encouraged him to</p>
<p>compose a short work on Calculating by (the rules of) Completion and
Reduction, confining it to what is easiest and most useful in
arithmetic, such as men constantly require in cases of inheritance,
legacies, partitions, lawsuits, and trade, and in all their dealings
with one another, or where the measuring of lands, the digging of
canals, geometrical computation, and other objects of various sorts and
kinds are concerned (Karpinski 1915, p. 96).</p>
<p>It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but
the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the previous
translation. The word “al-jabr” presumably meant something like
“restoration” or “completion” and seems to refer to the transposition of
subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word “muqabalah”
is said to refer to “reduction” or “balancing”—that is, the cancellation
of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. Arabic influence in
Spain long after the time of al-Khwarizmi is found in Don Quixote, where
the word “algebrista” is used for a bone-setter, that is, a
“restorer.”</p>
<p>Quadratic Equations</p>
<p>The Latin translation of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra opens with a brief
introductory statement of the positional principle for numbers and then
proceeds to the solution, in six short chapters, of the six types of
equations made up of the three kinds of quantities: roots, squares, and
numbers (i.e., x, x2, and numbers). Chapter I, in three short
paragraphs, covers the case of squares equal to roots, expressed in
modern notation as x2 55x, x2 /3 54x, and 5x2 510x, giving the answers x
55, x 512, and x52, respectively. (The root x 50 was not recognized.)
Chapter II covers the case of squares equal to numbers, and Chapter III
solves the case of roots equal to numbers, again with three
illustrations per chapter to cover the cases in which the coefficient of
the variable term is equal to, more than, or less than 1. Chapters IV,
V, and VI are more interesting, for they cover in turn the three
classical cases of three-term quadratic equations: (1) squares and roots
equal to numbers, (2) squares and numbers equal to roots, and (3) roots
and numbers equal to squares. The solutions are “cookbook” rules for
“completing the square” applied to specific instances. Chapter IV, for
example, includes the three illustrations x2 110x 539, 2x2 110x548, and
12x2 15x528. In each case, only the positive answer is given. In Chapter
V, only a single example, x2 121510x, is used, but both roots, 3 and 7,
are given, corresponding to the rule x557p25221. Al-Khwarizmi here calls
attention to the fact that what we designate as the discriminant must be
positive:</p>
<p>You ought to understand also that when you take the half of the roots
in this form of equation and then multiply the half by itself; if that
which proceeds or results from the multiplication is less than the units
abovementioned as accompanying the square, you have an equation.</p>
<p>In Chapter VI, the author again uses only a single example, 3x145x2,
for whenever the coefficient of x2 is not unity, the author reminds us
to divide first by this coefficient (as in Chapter IV). Once more, the
steps in completing the square are meticulously indicated, without
justification, the procedure being equivalent to the solution
negative.pð 12Þ2</p>
<p>x511 1 14. Again, only one root is given, for the other is</p>
<p>The six cases of equations given previously exhaust all possibilities
for linear and quadratic equations having a positive root. The
arbitrariness of the rules and the strictly numerical form of the six
chapters remind us of ancient Babylonianandmedieval Indian
mathematics.The exclusionof indeterminate analysis, a favorite Hindu
topic, and the avoidance of any syncopation, such as is found in
Brahmagupta, might suggest Mesopotamia as more likely a source than
India. As we read beyond the sixth chapter, however, an entirely new
light is thrown on the question. Al-Khwarizmi continues:</p>
<p>We have said enough so far as numbers are concerned, about the six
types of equations. Now, however, it is necessary that we should
demonstrate
geometricallythetruthofthesameproblemswhichwehaveexplainedinnumbers.</p>
<p>The ring in this passage is obviously Greek, rather than Babylonian
or</p>
<p>Indian. There are thus three main schools of thought on the origin of
Arabic algebra: one emphasizes Hindu influences; another stresses the
Mesopotamian, or Syriac-Persian, tradition; and the third points to
Greek inspiration. The truth is probably approached if we combine the
three theories. The philosophers of Islam admired Aristotle to the point
of aping him, but eclectic Mohammedan mathematicians seem to have chosen
appropriate elements from various sources.</p>
<p>Geometric Foundation</p>
<p>TheAlgebraofal-KhwarizmibetraysunmistakableHellenicelements,but the
first geometric demonstrations have little in common with classical
Greek mathematics. For the equation x2 110x539, al-Khwarizmi drew a
square, ab, to represent x2, and on the four sides of this square he
placed rectangles c, d, e, and f, each 2 units wide. To complete the
larger square, one must add the four small corner squares (dotted in
Fig. 11.1), each of which has an area of 6 units. Hence, to “complete
the square” we add 4 times 6 units, or 25 units, thus obtaining a square
of total area 391 25564 units (as is clear from the right-hand side of
the given equation). The side of the large square must therefore be 8
units, from which we subtract 2times 2,or5,unitstofindthatx53, thus
provingthattheanswer found in Chapter IV is correct.</p>
<p>The geometric proofs for Chapters V and VI are somewhat more
involved. For the equation x2 121510x, the author draws the square ab to
represent x2 and the rectangle bg to represent 21 units. Then the large
rectangle, comprising the square and the rectangle bg, must have an area
equal to 10x, so that the side ag or hd must be 10 units. If, then, one
bisects hd at e, draws et perpendicular to hd, extends te to c so that
tc5tg, and completes the squares tclg and cmne (Fig. 11.2), the area tb
is equal to the area md. But the square tl is 25, and the gnomon tenmlg
is 21 (because the gnomon is equal to the rectangle bg). Hence, the
square nc is 4, and its side ec is 2. Inasmuch as ec5be, and because
he55, we see that x5hb5522 or 3, which proves that the arithmetic
solution given in Chapter V is correct. A modified diagram is given for

<p>Algebraic Problems</p>
<p>A comparison of Fig. 11.2, taken from al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, with
diagrams found in the Elements of Euclid in connection with Greek
geometric algebra leads to the inevitable conclusion that Arabic algebra
had much in common with Greek geometry; however, the first, or
arithmetic, part of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra is obviously alien to Greek
thought. What apparently happened in Baghdad was just what one would
expect in a cosmopolitan intellectual center. Arabic scholars had great
admiration for Greek astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and
philosophy—subjects that they mastered as best they could. Yet, they
could scarcely help but notice the same thing that the Nestorian bishop
Sebokt had observed when in 662 he first called attention to the nine
marvelous digits of the Hindus: “There are also others who know
something.” It is probable that al-Khwarizmi typified the Arabic
eclecticism that will so frequently be observed in other cases. His
system of numeration most likely came from India, his systematic
algebraic solution of equations may have been a development from
Mesopotamia, and the logical geometric framework for his solutions was
palpably derived from Greece.</p>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi contains more than the solution of
equations, material that occupies about the first half. There are, for
example, rules for operations on binomial expressions, including
products such as (1012)(1021) and (101x)(102x). Although the Arabs
rejected negative roots and absolute negative magnitudes, they were
familiar with the rules governing what are now known as signed numbers.
There are also alternative geometric proofs of some of the author’s six
cases of equations. Finally, the Algebra includes a wide variety of
problems illustrating the six chapters or cases. As an illustration of
the fifth chapter, for example, al-Khwarizmi asks for the division of 10
into two parts in such a way that “the sum of the products obtained by
multiplying each part by itself is equal to fifty eight.” The extant
Arabic version, unlike the Latin, also includes an extended discussion
of inheritance problems, such as the following:</p>
<p>A man dies, leaving two sons behind him, and bequeathing one-third of
his capital to a stranger. He leaves ten dirhems of property and a claim
of ten dirhems upon one of the sons.</p>
<p>The answer is not what one would expect, for the stranger gets only 5
dirhems. According to Arabic law, a son who owes to the estate of his
father an amount greater than the son’s portion of the estate retains
the whole sum that he owes, one part being regarded as his share of the
estate and the remainder as a gift from his father. To some extent, it
seems to have been the complicated nature of laws governing inheritance
that encouraged the study of algebra in Arabia.</p>
<p>A Problem from Heron</p>
<p>A few of al-Khwarizmi’s problems give rather clear evidence of Arabic
dependence on the Babylonian-Heronian stream of mathematics. One of them
presumably was taken directly from Heron, for the figure and the
dimensions are the same. Within an isosceles triangle having sides of 10
yards and a base of 12 yards (Fig. 11.3), a square is to be inscribed,
and the side of this square is called for. The author of the Algebra
first finds through the Pythagorean theorem that the altitude of the
triangle is 8 yards, so that the area of the triangle is 48 square
yards. Calling the side of the square the “thing,” he notes that the
square of the “thing” will be found by taking from the area of the large
triangle the areas of the three small triangles lying outside the square
but inside the large triangle. The sum of the areas of the two</p>
<p>FIG. 11.3</p>
<p>lower small triangles he knows to be the product of the “thing” by 6
less half of the “thing,” and the area of the upper small triangle is
the product of 8 less the “thing” by half of the “thing.” Hence, he is
led to the obvious conclusion that the “thing” is 4 yards—the side of
the square. The chief difference between the form of this problem in
Heron and that of alKhwarizmi is that Heron had expressed the answer in
terms of unit fractions as 4. The similarities are so much more
pronounced than the differences that we may take this case as
confirmation of the general axiom that continuity in the history of
mathematics is the rule, rather than the exception. Where a
discontinuity seems to arise, we should first consider the possibility
that the apparent saltus may be explained by the loss of intervening
documents.</p>
<h4 id="abd-al-hamid-ibn-turk">’Abd Al-Hamid ibn-Turk</h4>
<p>The Algebra of al-Khwarizmi is usually regarded as the first work on
the subject, but a publication in Turkey raises some question about
this. A manuscript of a work by ’Abd-al-Hamid ibn-Turk, titled “Logical
Necessities in Mixed Equations,” was part of a book on Al-jabr wa’l
muqabalah, which was evidently very much the same as that by
al-Khwarizmi and was published at about the same time— possibly even
earlier. The surviving chapters on “Logical Necessities” give precisely
the same type of geometric demonstration as alKhwarizmi’s Algebra and in
one case the same illustrative example, x2 121 510x. In one respect,
’Abd al-Hamid’s exposition is more thorough than that of al-Khwarizmi
for he gives geometric figures to prove that if the discriminant is
negative, a quadratic equation has no solution. Similarities in the work
of the two men and the systematic organization found in them seem to
indicate that algebra in their day was not so recent a development as
has usually been assumed. When textbooks with a conventional and
well-ordered exposition appear simultaneously, a subject is likely to be
considerably beyond the formative stage. Successors of al-Khwarizmi were
able to say, once a problem had been reduced to the form of an equation,
“Operate according to the rules of algebra and almucabala.” In any case,
the survival of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra can be taken to indicate that it
was one of the better textbooks typical of Arabic algebra of the time.
It was to algebra what Euclid’s Elements was to geometry—the best
elementary exposition available until modern times—but al-Khwarizmi’s
work had a serious deficiency that had to be removed before it could
effectively serve its purpose in the modern world: a symbolic notation
had to be developed to replace the rhetorical form. This step the Arabs
never took, except for the replacement of number words by number
signs.</p>
<p>T habi t ibn Q ur ra</p>
<h4 id="thabit-ibn-qurra">Thabit ibn-Qurra</h4>
<p>The ninth century was a glorious one in mathematical transmission and
discovery. It produced not only al-Khwarizmi in the first half of the
century, but also Thabit ibn-Qurra (826 901) in the second half. Thabit,
a Sabean, was born in Harran, the ancient Mesopotamian city that is
located in present-day southeastern Turkey and once lay along one of the
notable trade routes of the region. Thabit, trilingual since his youth,
came to the attention of one of the Musa brothers, who encouraged him to
come to Baghdad to study with his brothers in the House of Wisdom.
Thabit became proficient in medicine, as well as in mathematics and
astronomy, and, when appointed court astronomer by the caliph of
Baghdad, established a tradition of translations, especially from Greek
and Syriac. To him we owe an immense debt for translations into Arabic
of works by Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, Ptolemy, and Eutocius. Had
it not been for Thabit’s efforts, the number of Greek mathematical works
extant today would be smaller. For example, we should have only the
first four, rather than the first seven, books of Apollonius’s
Conics.</p>
<p>Moreover, Thabit had so thoroughly mastered the content of the
classics he translated that he suggested modifications and
generalizations. To him is due a remarkable formula for amicable
numbers: if p, q, andn r1 are prime numbers, and if they are of the
form2n 1 n n p532n 21, q532 21, and r 592 21, then 2 pq and 2 r are
amicable numbers, for each is equal to the sum of the proper divisors of
the other. Like Pappus, Thabit also gave a generalization of the
Pythagorean theorem that is applicable to all triangles, whether right
or scalene. If from vertex A of any triangle ABC one draws lines
intersecting BC in points Bu and Cu such that angles ABuB and ACuC are
each</p>
<p>equal to angle A (Fig. 11.4), then AB2 1AC2 5BCðBB0 1CC0Þ: Thabit
gave no proof of the theorem, but this is easily supplied through
theorems on similar triangles. In fact, the theorem provides a beautiful
generalization of the pinwheel diagram used by Euclid in the proof of
the Pythagorean theorem. If, for example, angle A is obtuse, then the
square on side AB is equal to the rectangle BBu Bv Buv, and the square
on AC is equal to the rectangle CCv Cu Cuv, here BBv 5CCv 5BC5Bv Cv.
That is, the sum of the squares on AB and AC is the square on BC less
the rectangle Bu Cu Buv Cuv. If angle A is acute, then the positions of
Bu and Cu are reversed with respect to AP, where P is the projection of
A on BC, and in this case, the sum of the squares on AB and AC is equal
to the square on BC increased by the rectangle Bu Cu Buv Cuv. If A is a
right angle, then Bu and Cu coincide with P, and for this case, Thabit’s
theorem becomes the Pythagorean theorem. (Thabit did not draw the dotted
lines that are shown in Fig. 11.4, but he did consider the several
cases.)</p>
<p>Alternative proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, works on parabolic and
paraboloidal segments, a discussion of magic squares, angle trisections,
and new astronomical theories are among Thabit’s further contributions
to scholarship. Thabit boldly added a ninth sphere to the eight
previously assumed in simplified versions of Aristotelian-Ptolemaic
astronomy, and instead of the Hipparchan precession of the equinoxes in
one direction or sense only, Thabit proposed a “trepidation of the
equinoxes” in a reciprocating type of motion.</p>
<h4 id="numerals-1">Numerals</h4>
<p>Within the confines of the Arabic empire lived peoples of very varied
ethnic backgrounds: Syrian, Greek, Egyptian, Persian, Turkish, and many
others. Most of them shared a common faith, Islam, although Christians
and Jews were tolerated; very many shared a common language, Arabic,
althoughGreekandHebrewweresometimesused.Therewasconsiderable
factionalism at all times, and it sometimes erupted into conflict.
Thabit himself had grown up in a pro-Greek community, which opposed him
for his pro-Arabic sympathies. Cultural differences occasionally became
quite apparent, as in the works of the tenth- and eleventh-century
scholars Abu’l-Wefa (940 998) and al-Karkhi (or al-Karagi, ca. 1029). In
some of their works, they used the Hindu numerals, which had reached
Arabia through the astronomical Sindhind; at other times, they adopted
the Greek alphabetic pattern of numeration (with, of course, Arabic
equivalents for the Greek letters). Ultimately, the superior Hindu
numerals won out, but even within the circle of those who used the
Indian numeration, the forms of the numerals differed considerably.
Variations had obviously been prevalent in India, but in Arabia variants
were so striking that there are</p>
<p>Numeral s</p>
<p>Genealogy of our digits. Following Karl Menninger, Zahlwort und
Ziffer (Go¨ttingen: Vanderhoeck andandandand Ruprecht 1957 1958, 2
vols.), Vol. II, p. 233</p>
<p>theories suggesting entirely different origins for forms used in the
eastern and western halves of the Arabic world. Perhaps the numerals of
the Saracens in the east came directly from India, while the numerals of
the Moors in the west were derived from Greek or Roman forms. More
likely, the variants were the result of gradual changes taking place in
space and time, for the Arabic numerals of today are strikingly
different from the modern Devanagari (or “divine”) numerals still in use
in India. After all, it is the principles within the system of
numeration that are important, rather than the specific forms of the
numerals. Our numerals are often known as
Arabic,despitethefactthattheybearlittleresemblancetothosenowinuse in
Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Arabia, Iran, and other lands within the Islamic
culture—that is, the forms We call our numerals Arabic because the
principles in the two systems are the same and because our forms may
have been derived from the Arabic. Yet the principles behind the Arabic
numerals presumably were derived from India; hence, it is better to call
ours the Hindu or the Hindu-Arabic system (see the illustration
above).</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry-1">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>As in numeration, there was competition between systems of Greek and
Indian origin, so also in astronomical calculations there were at first
in Arabia two types of trigonometry—the Greek geometry of chords, as
found in the Almagest, and the Hindu tables of sines, as derived through
the Sindhind. Here, too, the conflict resulted in triumph for the Hindu
aspect, and most Arabic trigonometry was ultimately built on the sine
function. It was, in fact, again through the Arabs, rather than directly
from the Hindus, that this trigonometry of the sine reached Europe.</p>
<p>Sometimes attempts are made to attribute the functions tangent,
cotangent, secant, and cosecant to specific times and even to specific
individuals, but this cannot be done with any assurance. In India and
Arabia, there had been a general theory of shadow lengths, as related to
a unit of length or gnomon, for varying solar altitudes. There was no
one standard unit of length for the staff or the gnomon used, although a
hand span or a man’s height was frequently adopted. The horizontal
shadow, for a vertical gnomon of given length, was what we call the
cotangent of the angle of elevation of the sun. The “reverse
shadow”—that is, the shadow cast on a vertical wall by a stick or a
gnomon projecting horizontally from the wall—was what we know as the
tangent of the solar elevation. The “hypotenuse of the shadow”—that is,
the distance from the tip of the gnomon to the tip of the shadow—was the
equivalent of the cosecant function, and the “hypotenuse of the reverse
shadow” played the role of our secant. This shadow tradition seems to
have been well established in Asia by the time of Thabit ibn-Qurra, but
values of the hypotenuse (secant or cosecant) were seldom tabulated.</p>
<h4 id="tenth--and-eleventh-century-highlights">Tenth- and
Eleventh-Century Highlights</h4>
<p>With Abu’l-Wefa, trigonometryassumes a more systematic form in which
such theorems as double and half-angle formulas are proved. Although the
Hindu sine function had displaced the Greek chord, it was nevertheless
the Almagest of Ptolemy that motivated the logical arrangement of
trigonometric results. The law of sines had been known to Ptolemy in
essence and is implied in the work of Brahmagupta, but it is frequently
attributed to Abu’l-Wefa and his contemporary Abu Nasr Mensur because of
their clear-cut formulation of the law for spherical triangles.
Abu’l-Wefa also made up a new sine table for angles differing by , using
the equivalent of eight decimal places. In addition, he contributed a
table of tangents and made use of all six of the common trigonometric
functions, together with relations among them, but his use of the new
functions seems not to have been widely followed in the medieval
period.</p>
<p>Tent h and Ele v ent h Centur y Highlight s</p>
<p>Abu’l-Wefa was a capable algebraist, as well as a trigonometer. He
commented on al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra and translated from the Greek one of
the last great classics—the Arithmetica of Diophantus. His successor
al-Karkhi evidently used this translation to become an Arabic disciple
of Diophantus—but without Diophantine analysis! That is, al-Karkhi was
concerned with the algebra of al-Khwarizmi, rather than with the
indeterminate analysis of the Hindus, but like Diophantus (and unlike
al-Khwarizmi), he did not limit himself to quadratic equations— despite
the fact that he followed the Arabic custom of giving geometric proofs
for quadratics. In particular, to al-Karkhi is attributed the first
numerical solution of equations of the form ax2n 1bxn 5c (only equations
with positive roots were considered), where the Diophantine restriction
to rational numbers was abandoned. It was in just this direction, toward
the algebraic solution (in terms of radicals) of equations of more than
the second degree, that the early developments in mathematics in the
Renaissance were destined to take place.</p>
<p>The time of al-Karkhi—the early eleventh century—was a brilliant era
in the history of Arabic learning, and a number of his contemporaries
deserve brief mention—brief not because they were less capable, but
because they were not primarily mathematicians.</p>
<p>Ibn-Sina (980 1037), better known to the West as Avicenna, was the
foremost scholar and scientist in Islam, but in his encyclopedic
interests, mathematics played a smaller role than medicine and
philosophy. He made a translation of Euclid and explained the
casting-out of nines (which consequently is sometimes unwarrantedly
attributed to him), but he is better remembered for his application of
mathematics to astronomy and physics.</p>
<p>As Avicenna reconciled Greek learning with Muslim thought, so his
contemporary al-Biruni (973 1048) made the Arabs—hence, us—familiar with
Hindu mathematics and culture through his well-known book titled India.
An indefatigable traveler and a critical thinker, he gave a sympathetic
but candid account,including full descriptions of the Siddhantas and the
positional principle of numeration. It is he who told us that Archimedes
was familiar with Heron’s formula and gave a proof of this and of
Brahmagupta’s formula, correctly insisting that the latter applies only
to a cyclic quadrilateral. In inscribing a nonagon in a circle, alBiruni
reduced the problem, through the trigonometric formula for cos3θ, to
solving the equation x3 5113x, and for this, he gave the approximate
solution in sexagesimal fractions as 1;52,15,17,13— equivalent to more
than six-place accuracy. Al-Biruni also gave us, in a chapter on gnomon
lengths, an account of the Hindu shadow reckoning. The boldness of his
thought is illustrated by his discussion of whether the earth rotates on
its axis, a question to which he did not give an answer. (Earlier,
Aryabhata seems to have suggested a rotating earth at the center of
space.)</p>
<p>Al-Biruni also contributed to physics, especially through studies in
specific gravity and the causes of artesian wells, but as a physicist
and a mathematician he was excelled by ibn-al-Haitham (ca. 965 1039),
known to the West as Alhazen. The most important treatise written by
Alhazen was the Treasury of Optics, a book that was inspired by work of
Ptolemy on reflection and refraction and that in turn inspired
scientists of medieval and early modern Europe. Among the questions that
Alhazen considered were the structure of the eye, the apparent increase
in the size of the moon when near the horizon, and an estimate, from the
observation that twilight lasts until the sun is 19 below the horizon,
of the height of the atmosphere. The problem of finding the point on a
spherical mirror at which light from a source will be reflected to the
eye of an observer is known to this day as “Alhazen’s problem.” It is a
“solid problem” in the old Greek sense, solvable by conic sections, a
subject with which Alhazen was quite familiar. He extended Archimedes’
results on conoids by finding the volume generated by revolving about
the tangent at the vertex the area bounded by a parabolic arc and the
axis and an ordinate of the parabola.</p>
<h4 id="omar-khayyam">Omar Khayyam</h4>
<p>Arabic mathematics can with some propriety be divided into four
parts: (1) an arithmetic presumably derived from India and based on the
principle of position; (2) an algebra that, although from Greek, Hindu,
and Babylonian sources, nevertheless in Muslim hands assumed a
characteristically new and systematic form; (3) a trigonometry the
substance of which came chiefly from Greece but to which the Arabs
applied the Hindu form and added new functions and formulas; and (4) a
geometry that came from Greece but to which the Arabs contributed
generalizations here and there. There was a significant contribution
about a century after Alhazen by a man who in the East is known as a
scientist but whom the West recalls as one of the greatest Persian
poets. Omar Khayyam (ca. 1050 1123), the “tent-maker,” wrote an Algebra
that went beyond that of al-Khwarizmi to include equations of the third
degree. Like his Arabic predecessors, Omar Khayyam provided both
arithmetic and geometric solutions for quadratic equations; for general
cubic equations, he believed (mistakenly, as the sixteenth century later
showed), arithmetic solutions were impossible; hence, he gave only
geometric solutions. The scheme of using intersecting conics to solve
cubics had been used earlier by Menaechmus, Archimedes, and Alhazen, but
Omar Khayyam took the praiseworthy step of generalizing the method to
cover all third-degree equations (having positive roots). When in an
earlier work he came across a cubic equation, he specifically remarked,
“This cannot be solved by plane geometry 〔i.e., using straightedge
and</p>
<p>Omar K hay yam</p>
<p>compasses only〕 since it has a cube in it. For the solution we need
conic sections” (Amir-Moez 1963, p. 328).</p>
<p>For equations of a higher degree than three, Omar Khayyam evidently
did not envision similar geometric methods, for space does not contain
more than three dimensions, “what is called square-square by algebraists
in continuous magnitude is a theoretical fact. It does not exist in
reality in any way.” The procedure that Omar Khayyam so tortuously—and
so proudly—applied to cubic equations can be stated with far greater
succinctness in modern notation and concepts as follows. Let the cubic
be x3 1ax2 1b2x 1c3 50. Then, if for x2 in this equation we substitute
22 py, we obtain (recalling that3 x3 5x2 x) the result 2pxy12apy1b x 1c
50. Because the resulting equation represents a hyperbola, and the
equality x2 52py used in the substitution represents a parabola, it is
clear that if the hyperbola and the parabola are sketched on the same
set of coordinate axes, then the abscissas of the points of intersection
of the two curves will be the roots of the cubic equation. Obviously,
many other pairs of conic sections can be used in a similar way to solve
the cubic.</p>
<p>Our exposition of Omar Khayyam’s work does not do justice to his
genius, for, lacking the concept of negative coefficients, he had to
break the problem into many separate cases according as the parameters
a, b, c
arepositive,negative,orzero.Moreover,hehadtospecificallyidentifyhis
conicsectionsforeachcase,fortheconceptofageneralparameterwasnot
athandinhisday.Notallrootsofagivencubicequationweregiven,forhe did not
accept the appropriateness of negative roots and did not note all
intersections of the conic sections. It should also be mentioned that in
the earlier Greek geometric solutions of cubic equations, the
coefficients had been line segments, whereas in the work of Omar Khayyam
they were specific numbers. One of the most fruitful contributions of
Arabic eclecticism was the tendency to close the gap between numerical
and geometric
algebra.ThedecisivestepinthisdirectioncamemuchlaterwithDescartes, but
Omar Khayyam was moving in this direction when he wrote, “Whoever thinks
algebra is a trick in obtaining unknowns has thought it in vain. No
attention should be paid to the fact that algebra and geometry are
different in appearance. Algebras are geometric facts which are proved.”
In replacing Euclid’s theory of proportions with a numerical approach,
he cameclosetoadefinitionoftheirrationalandstruggledwiththeconceptof
real number in general.</p>
<p>In his Algebra, Omar Khayyam wrote that elsewhere he had set forth a
rule that he had discovered for finding fourth, fifth, sixth, and higher
powers of a binomial, but such a work is not extant. It is presumed that
he was referring to the Pascal triangle arrangement, one that seems to
have appeared in China at about the same time. Such a coincidence is not
easy to explain, but until further evidence is available, independence
of discovery is to be assumed. Intercommunication between Arabia and
China was not extensive at that time, but there was a silk route
connecting China with Persia, and information might have trickled along
it.</p>
<h4 id="the-parallel-postulate">The Parallel Postulate</h4>
<p>Islamic mathematicians were clearly more attracted to algebra and
trigonometrythantogeometry,butoneaspectofgeometryheldaspecialfascination
for them—the proof of Euclid’s fifth postulate. Even among the Greeks,
the attempt to prove the postulate had become virtually a “fourth famous
problemofgeometry,”andseveralMuslimmathematicianscontinuedtheeffort.
Alhazen had begun with a trirectangular quadrilateral (sometimes known
as “Lambert’s quadrangle” in recognition of efforts in the eighteenth
century)
andthoughtthathehadprovedthatthefourthanglemustalsobearightangle. From
this “theorem” on the quadrilateral, the fifth postulate can easily be
showntofollow.Inhis“proof,”Alhazenhadassumedthatthelocusofapoint that
moves so as to remain equidistant from a given line is necessarily a
line parallel to the given line—an assumption shown in modern times to
be equivalent to Euclid’s postulate. Omar Khayyam criticized Alhazen’s
proof on the ground that Aristotle had condemned the use of motion in
geometry. Omar Khayyam then began with a quadrilateral the two sides of
which are equal and are both perpendicular to the base (usually known as
a “Saccheri quadrilateral,” again in recognition of eighteenth-century
efforts), and he asked about the other (upper) angles of the
quadrilateral, which necessarily are equal to each other. There are, of
course, three possibilities. The angles
maybe(1)acute,(2)right,or(3)obtuse.ThefirstandthirdpossibilitiesOmar
Khayyam ruled out on the basis of a principle, which he attributed to
Aristotle, that two converging lines must intersect—again, an assumption
equivalent to Euclid’s parallel postulate.</p>
<h4 id="nasir-al-din-al-tusi">Nasir al-Din al-Tusi</h4>
<p>When Omar Khayyam died in 1123, Islamic science was in a state of
decline, but Muslim contributions did not come to a sudden stop with his
death. Both in the thirteenth century and again in the fifteenth
century, we find an Islamic mathematician of note. At Maragha, for
example, Nasir al-Din (Eddin) al-Tusi (1201 1274), an astronomer to
Hulagu Khan, a grandson of the conqueror Genghis Khan and a brother of
Kublai Khan, continued efforts to prove the parallel postulate, starting
from the usual three hypotheses on a Saccheri quadrilateral. His “proof”
depends on the following hypothesis, again equivalent to Euclid’s:</p>
<p>If a line u is perpendicular to a line w at A, and if line v is
oblique to w at 3, then the perpendiculars drawn from u upon v are less
than AB on the</p>
<p>A l K a s hi</p>
<p>side on which v makes an acute angle with w and greater on the side
on which v makes an obtuse angle with w.</p>
<p>The views of al-Tusi, the last in the sequence of three Arabic
precursors of non-Euclidean geometry, were translated and published by
John Wallis in the seventeenth century. It appears that this work was
the starting point for the developments by Saccheri in the first third
of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Continuing the work of Abu’l-Wefa, al-Tusi was responsible for the
first systematic treatise on plane and spherical trigonometry, treating
the material as an independent subject in its own right and not simply
as the handmaid of astronomy, as had been the case in Greece and India.
The six usual trigonometric functions are used, and rules for solving
the various cases of plane and spherical triangles are given.
Unfortunately, the work of al-Tusi had limited influence, inasmuch as it
did not become well known in Europe. In astronomy, however, al-Tusi made
a contribution that may have come to the attention of Copernicus. The
Arabs had adopted theories of both Aristotle and Ptolemy for the
heavens; noticing elements of conflict between the cosmologies, they
sought to reconcile and refine them. In this connection, al-Tusi
observed that a combination of two uniform circular motions in the usual
epicyclic construction can produce a reciprocating rectilinear motion.
That is, if a point moves with uniform circular motion clockwise around
the epicycle, while the center of the epicycle moves counterclockwise
with half of this speed along an equal deferent circle, the point will
describe a straight-line segment. (In other words, if a circle rolls
without slipping along the inside of a circle whose diameter is twice as
great, the locus of a point on the circumference of the smaller circle
will be a diameter of the larger circle.) This “theorem of Nasir Eddin”
became known to, or was rediscovered by, Nicholas Copernicus and Jerome
Cardan in the sixteenth century.</p>
<h4 id="al-kashi">Al-Kashi</h4>
<p>The mathematics of Islam continued to decline after al-Tusi, but our
account of the Muslim contribution would not be adequate without
reference to the work of a figure in the early fifteenth century.
Jamshid al-Kashi (ca. 1380 1429) found a patron in the prince Ulugh Beg,
who was a grandson of the Mongol conqueror Tamerlane. In Samarkand,
where he held his court, Ulugh Beg had built an observatory and
established a center of learning, and al-Kashi joined the group of
scientists gathered there. In numerous works, written in Persian and
Arabic, alKashi contributed to mathematics and astronomy. He also
produced a major textbook for the use of students in Samarkand, which
provided an introduction to arithmetic, algebra, and their applications
to architecture, surveying, commerce, and other interest areas. His
computational skills appear to have been unequalled. Noteworthy is the
accuracy of his computations, especially in connection with the solution
of equations by a special case of Horner’s method, derived perhaps from
the Chinese. From China, too, al-Kashi may have taken the practice of
using decimal fractions. Al-Kashi is an important figure in the history
of decimal fractions, and he realized the significance of his
contribution in this respect, regarding himself as the inventor of
decimal fractions. Although to some extent he had had precursors, he was
perhaps the first user of sexagesimal fractions to suggest that decimals
are just as convenient for problems requiring many-place accuracy.
Nevertheless, in his systematic computations of roots, he continued to
make use of sexagesimals. In illustrating his method for finding the nth
root of a number, he took the sixth root of the sexagesimal</p>
<p>34,59,1,7,14,54,23,3,47,37;40.</p>
<p>This was a prodigious feat of computation, using the steps that we
follow in Horner’s method—locating the root, diminishing the roots, and
stretching or multiplying the roots—and using a pattern similar to our
synthetic division.</p>
<p>Al-Kashi evidently delighted in long calculations, and he was
justifiably proud of his approximation of π, which was more accurate
than any of the values given by his predecessors. He expressed his value
of 2π in both
sexagesimalanddecimalforms.Theformer—6;16,59,28,34,51,46,15,50— is more
reminiscent of the past, and the latter, 6.2831853071795865, in a sense
presaged the future use of decimal fractions. No mathematician
approached the accuracy in this tour de force of computation until the
late sixteenth century. His computational skills appear to have been at
the basis of the table of sines produced at the Samarkand observatory.
In alKashi, the binomial theorem in “Pascal triangle” form again
appears, just about a century after its publication in China and about a
century before it was printed in European books.</p>
<p>The number of significant Islamic contributors to mathematics before
al-Kashi was considerably larger than our exposition would suggest, for
we have concentrated only on major figures, but after al-Kashi the
number is negligible. It was very fortunate indeed that when Arabic
learning began to decline, scholarship in Europe was on the upgrade and
was prepared to accept the intellectual legacy bequeathed by earlier
ages.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Time and history are seamless wholes, and any subdivision into
periods is man’s handiwork, but just as a coordinate framework is useful
in geometry, so also the subdivision of events into periods or eras is
convenient in history. For purposes of political history, it has been
customary to designate the fall of Rome in 476 as the beginning of the
Middle Ages and thefallof Constantinopleto theTurksin 1453as theend.
Forthehistoryof mathematics, let us simply consider the period 500 to
1450 as encompassing mathematics of the Middle Ages. We remind readers
that five great civilizations, writing in five major languages, make up
the bulk of the history of medieval mathematics. In the four preceding
chapters, we described contributions in Greek, Chinese, Sanskrit, and
Arabic from the Byzantine Empire, China, India, and Islam, four of the
five leading medieval cultures. In this chapter, we look at the
mathematics of the</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Western or Roman Empire, which had no one center and no single spoken
language, but in which Latin was the lingua franca of scholars.</p>
<h4 id="compendia-of-the-dark-ages">Compendia of the Dark Ages</h4>
<p>Thesixthcenturywasagrimperiodforthecountriesthathadformedpartof the
Western Empire. Internal conflicts, invasions, and migrations left much
of the region depopulated and in poverty. Roman institutions, including
the notable school system, were largely defunct. The growing Christian
Church, itself not immune to internal strife, was only gradually
building up an educational system. It is against this background that we
must assess the limited mathematical contributions of Boethius, as well
as Cassiodorus (ca. 480 ca. 575) and Isidore of Seville (570 636).
Neither of the three was particularly adept at mathematics; their
arithmetic and geometric contributions should be seen in the context of
their aiming to supply the monastic schools and libraries with an
introduction to the liberal arts.</p>
<p>Cassiodorus, a contemporary of Boethius, whom he succeeded as
magister officiorum in the service of Theodorus, spent his retirement in
a monastery that he had founded, where he established a library and
instructed the monks in the fine art of accurately copying both Greek
and Latin manuscript texts. This set the stage for an activity that
played a large role in the preservation of ancient texts, both Christian
and “pagan.”</p>
<p>Isidore of Seville, considered by contemporaries to be the most
learned man of his time, was the author of the voluminous Origines or
Etymologies, consisting of twenty books, one of which dealt with
mathematics. It comprised four parts: arithmetic, geometry, music, and
astronomy—the quadrivium. Similar to the Arithmetic of Boethius, the
arithmetic and geometric portions were restricted to elementary
definitions and properties of numbers and figures.</p>
<p>These men are distinguished for being instrumental in preserving
elements of traditional learning in what were truly the “Dark Ages” of
science. For the next two centuries, the gloom continued to such an
extent that it has been said nothing scholarly could be heard in Europe
but the scratching of the pen of the Venerable Bede (ca. 673 735),
writing in England about the mathematics needed to determine the date of
Easter or about the representation of numbers by means of the fingers.
Both topics were significant: the first was necessary to establish the
annual calendar in the Christian era; the second enabled an illiterate
populace to conduct arithmetic transactions.</p>
<h4 id="gerbert">Gerbert</h4>
<p>In 800, Charlemagne was crowned emperor by the pope. He endeavored to
pull his empire out of the doldrums of the Dark Ages and under that</p>
<p>Ger b er t</p>
<p>program called on the educator Alcuin of York (ca. 735 804), whom he
had brought to Tours some years earlier, to revitalize education in
France. This brought sufficient improvement to lead some historians to
speak of a Carolingian Renaissance. Alcuin was no mathematician,
however; presumably, he showed Neopythagorean influence in his
explanation that the act of creation had taken six days because 6 was a
perfect number. Beyond some arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy that
Alcuin is reputed to have written for beginners, there was little
mathematics in France or England for another two centuries. In Germany,
Hrabanus Maurus (784 856) continued the slight mathematical and
astronomical efforts of Bede, especially in connection with the
computation of the date of Easter. But not for another century and a
half was there any notable change in the mathematical climate in Western
Europe, and then it came in the person of one who rose ultimately to
become Pope</p>
<p>Sylvester II.</p>
<p>Gerbert (ca. 940 1003) was born in France, educated in Spain and
Italy, and then served in Germany as tutor and later adviser to the Holy
Roman Emperor Otto III. Having also served as archbishop, first at Reims
and later at Ravenna, Gerbert in 999 was elevated to the papacy, taking
the name Sylvester—possibly in recollection of an earlier pope who had
been noted for scholarship, but more probably because Sylvester I, the
pope during the days of Constantine, symbolized the unity of papacy and
empire. Gerbert was active in politics, both lay and ecclesiastical, but
he also had time for educational matters. He wrote on both arithmetic
and geometry, likely depending on the Boethian tradition, which had
dominated the teaching in Western church schools. More interesting than
these expository works, however, is the fact that Gerbert was perhaps
the first one in Europe to have taught the use of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. It is not clear how he came in contact with these. Moorish
learning included Arabic numeration with the Western, or Gobar (dust),
forms of the numerals, although there is little evidence of Arabic
influence in extant documents. A Spanish copy of the Origines of
Isidore, dating from 992, contains the numerals, without the zero. In
certain manuscripts of Boethius, however, similar numeral forms, or
apices, appear as counters for use on a computing board or an abacus.
The Boethian apices, on the other hand, may themselves have been later
interpolations. The situation with respect to the introduction of the
numerals into Europe is about as confused as is that surrounding the
invention of the system perhaps half a millennium earlier. Moreover, it
is not clear that there was any continued use of the new numerals in
Europe during the two centuries following Gerbert. Not until the
thirteenth century was the Hindu-Arabic system definitively introduced
into Europe, and then the achievement was not the work of one man but of
several.</p>
<h4 id="the-century-of-translation">The Century of Translation</h4>
<p>One cannot absorb the wisdom of one’s neighbors if one cannot
understand their language. The Muslims had broken down the language
barrier to Greek culture in the ninth century, and the Latin Europeans
overcame the language barrier to Arabic learning in the twelfth century.
At the beginning of the twelfth century, no European could expect to be
a mathematician or an astronomer, in any real sense, without a good
knowledge of Arabic, and Europe, during the earlier part of the twelfth
century, could not boast of a mathematician who was not a Moor, a Jew,
or a Greek. By the end of the century, the leading and most original
mathematician came from Christian Italy. The period was one of
transition from an older to a newer point of view. The revival began of
necessity with a spate of translations. At first, these were almost
exclusively from Arabic into Latin, but by the thirteenth century there
were many variants—Arabic to Spanish, Arabic to Hebrew, Greek to Latin,
or combinations such as Arabic to Hebrew to Latin.</p>
<p>It is not easy to tell whether the religious crusades had a positive
influence on the transmission of learning, but it is likely that they
disrupted channels of communication more than they facilitated them. At
all events, the channels through Spain and Sicily were the most
important in the twelfth century, and these were largely undisturbed by
the marauding armies of the crusaders between 1096 and 1272. The revival
of learning in Latin Europe took place during, but probably despite, the
crusades.</p>
<p>There were at the time three chief bridges between Islam and the
Christian world—Spain, Sicily, and the Eastern Empire—and of these the
first was the most important. Yet, not all of the major translators
availed themselves of the Spanish intellectual bridge. For example, the
Englishman Adelard of Bath (ca. 1075 1160) is known to have been in
Sicily and theEastbutseemsnottohavebeeninSpain;itisnotclearhowhehadcome
into contact with Muslim learning. In 1126, Adelard translated
Khwarizmi’s astronomical tables from Arabic into Latin. In 1142, he
produced a major version of the Elements of Euclid, among the earliest
of the mathematical classics to appear in Latin translation from the
Arabic. Adelard’s translation of the Elements did not become very
influential for another
century,butitwasfarfromanisolatedevent.Later(ca.1155),hetranslated
Ptolemy’s Almagest from Greek into Latin.</p>
<p>On the Iberian peninsula, especially at Toledo, where the archbishop
promoted such work, a veritable school of translation was developing.
The city, once a Visigothic capital and later, from 712 to 1085, in
Muslim hands before falling to the Christians, was an ideal spot for the
transfer of learning. In Toledo libraries, there was a wealth of Muslim
manuscripts, and of the populace, including Christians, Mohammedans, and
Jews,</p>
<p>A b ac i s t s and A lgor i s t s</p>
<p>many spoke Arabic, facilitating the interlingual flow of information.
The cosmopolitanism of the translators is evident from some of the
names: Robert of Chester, Hermann the Dalmatian, Plato of Tivoli,
Rudolph of Bruges, Gerard of Cremona, and John of Seville, the last a
converted Jew. These are but a small portion of the men associated with
the translation projects in Spain.</p>
<p>Of the translators in Spain, perhaps the most prolific was Gerard of
Cremona (1114 1187). He had gone to Spain to learn Arabic in order to
understand Ptolemy, but he devoted the rest of his life to translations
from the Arabic. Among these exemplary works was the translation into
Latin of a revised version of Thabit ibn-Qurra’s Arabic edition of
Euclid’s Elements; Gerard’s later translation of the Almagest, through
which Ptolemy came chiefly to be known in the West; and translations of
more than eighty other manuscripts.</p>
<p>Among the works of Gerard was a Latin adaptation of the Algebra of
al-Khwarizmi, but an earlier and more popular translation of the Algebra
had been made in 1145 by Robert of Chester. This, the first translation
of al-Khwarizmi’s treatise (as Robert’s translation of the Koran, a few
years before, had marked another “first”), may be taken as marking the
beginning of European algebra. Robert of Chester returned to England in
1150, but the Spanish work of translation continued unabated through
Gerard and others. The works of al-Khwarizmi were evidently among the
more popular subjects of the time, and the names of Plato of Tivoli and
John of Seville are attached to still other adaptations of the Algebra.
Western Europe suddenly took far more favorably to Arabic mathematics
than it ever had to Greek geometry. Perhaps part of the reason for this
is that Arabic arithmetic and algebra were on a more elementary level
than Greek geometry had been during the days of the Roman republic and
empire. The Romans, however, had never displayed much interest in Greek
trigonometry, relatively useful and elementary though it was, yet Latin
scholars of the twelfth century devoured Arabic trigonometry as it
appeared in astronomical works.</p>
<h4 id="abacists-and-algorists">Abacists and Algorists</h4>
<p>It was during the twelfth-century period of translation and the
following centurythatconfusionaroseconcerning thenameal-Khwarizmi
andledto the word “algorithm.” The Hindu numerals had been explained to
Latin readers by Adelard of Bath and John of Seville at about the same
time that ananalogousschemewasintroducedtotheJewsbyAbrahamibn-Ezra(ca.
1090 1167), an author of books on astrology, philosophy, and
mathematics. As in the Byzantine culture, the first nine Greek
alphabetic numerals, supplemented by a special zero symbol, took the
place of the Hindu numerals, so ibn-Ezra used the first nine Hebraic
alphabetic
numeralsandacircleforzerointhedecimalpositionalsystemforintegers.
Despite the numerous accounts of the Hindu-Arabic numerals, the
transitionfromthe Romannumberschemewas surprisinglyslow.Perhapsthis was
because computation with the abacus was quite common, and in this case
the advantages of the new scheme are not nearly so apparent as in
calculation with only pen and paper. For several centuries, there was
keen competition between the “abacists” and the “algorists,” and the
latter triumphed definitively only in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Thirteenth-century authors from many walks of life helped popularize
“algorism,” but we shall mention three in particular. One of them,
Alexandre de Villedieu (fl. ca. 1225), was a French Franciscan;
another,</p>
<p>John of Halifax (ca. 1200 1256), also known as Sacrobosco, was an</p>

<p>F ib onac c i</p>
<p>English schoolman; and the third was Leonardo of Pisa (ca. 1180
1250), better known as Fibonacci, or “son of Bonaccio,” an Italian
merchant. The Carmen de algorismo of Alexandre is a poem in which the
fundamental operations on integers are fully described, using the
Hindu-Arabic numerals and treating zero as a number. The Algorismus
vulgaris of Sacrobosco is a practical account of reckoning that rivaled
in popularity his Sphaera, an elementary tract on astronomy used in the
schools during the later Middle Ages. The book in which Fibonacci
described the new algorism is a celebrated classic, completed in 1202,
but it bears a misleading title—Liber abaci (or Book of the Abacus). It
is not on the abacus; it is a very thorough treatise on algebraic
methods and problems in which the use of the Hindu-Arabic numerals is
strongly advocated.</p>
<h4 id="fibonacci">Fibonacci</h4>
<p>Fibonacci’s father, Bonaccio, was a Pisan engaged in business in
northern Africa, and his son Leonardo studied under a Muslim teacher and
traveled in Egypt, Syria, and Greece. It therefore was natural that
Fibonacci should have been steeped in Arabic algebraic methods,
including, fortunately, the Hindu-Arabic numerals and, unfortunately,
the rhetorical form of expression. The Liber abaci opens with an idea
that sounds almost modern but that was characteristic of both Islamic
and Christian medieval thought—that arithmetic and geometry are
connected and support each other. This view is, of course, reminiscent
of al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra, but it was equally accepted in the Latin
Boethian tradition. The Liber abaci, nevertheless, is much more
concerned with number than with geometry. It first describes “the nine
Indian figures,” together with the sign 0, “which is called zephirum
in</p>
<p>Arabic.” Incidentally, it is from zephirum and its variants that our
words “cipher” and “zero” are derived. Fibonacci’s account of
Hindu-Arabic numeration was important in the process of transmission,
but it was not, as we have seen, the first such exposition, nor did it
achieve the popularity of the later but more elementary descriptions by
Sacrobosco and Villedieu. The horizontal bar in fractions, for example,
was used regularly by Fibonacci (and was known earlier in Arabia), but
it was only in the sixteenth century that it came into general use. (The
slanted solidus was suggested in 1845 by Augustus De Morgan.)</p>
<p>The LiberAbaci</p>
<p>The Liber abaci is not a rewarding book for the modern reader, for
after an explanation of the usual algoristic or arithmetic processes,
including the extraction of roots, it stresses problems in commercial
transactions, using a complicated systemof fractionsto compute
exchangesof currency. It is one of the ironies of history that the chief
advantage of positional notation—its applicability to fractions—almost
entirely escaped the users of the HinduArabic numerals for the first
thousand years of their existence. In this respect, Fibonacci was as
much to blame as anyone, for he used three types
offractions—common,sexagesimal,andunit—butnotdecimalfractions.In the
Liber abaci, in fact, the two worst of these systems, unit fractions and
common fractions, are extensively used. Moreover, problems of the
following type abound: If 1 solidus imperial, which is 12 deniers
imperial, is sold for 31 deniers Pisan, how many deniers Pisan should
one obtain for 11 deniers imperial? In a recipe-type of exposition, the
answer is laboriously found to be 28 (or, as we should write it, 28).
Fibonacci customarily placed the fractional part or parts of a mixed
number before the integral part. Instead of writing 11, for example, he
wrote 11, with the juxtaposition of unit fractions and integers implying
addition.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently was fond of unit fractions—or he thought his
readers were—for the Liber abaci includes tables of conversion from
common fractions to unit fractions. The fraction , for instance, is
broken into , and appears as . An unusual quirk in his notation led him
to express the sum of and as 1, the notation meaning in this case</p>
<p>11:</p>
<p>Analogously, in another of the many problems on monetary conversion
in the Liber abaci, we read that if of a rotulus is worth of a
bizantium, then of a bizantium is worth of a rotulus. Pity the poor
medieval businessman who had to operate with such a system!</p>
<p>The Fibonacci Sequence</p>
<p>Much of the Liber abaci makes dull reading, but some of the problems
were so lively that they were used by later writers. Among these is a
hardy perennial that may have been suggested by a similar problem in the
Ahmes Papyrus. As expressed by Fibonacci, it read,</p>
<p>Seven old women went to Rome; each woman had seven mules; each mule
carried seven sacks, each sack contained seven loaves; and with each
loaf were seven knives; each knife was put up in seven sheaths.</p>
<p>Without doubt, the problem in the Liber abaci that has most inspired
future mathematicians was the following:</p>
<p>How many pairs of rabbits will be produced in a year, beginning with
a single pair, if in every month each pair bears a new pair which
becomes productive from the second month on?</p>
<p>F ib onac c i</p>
<p>This celebrated problem gives rise to the “Fibonacci sequence” 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,…, un,…, where un 5un 1 1un 2, that is, where each
term after the first two is the sum of the two terms immediately
preceding it. This sequence has been found to have many beautiful and
significant properties. For instance, it can be proved that any two
successive terms are relatively prime and that limp Þ n-Nun1=un is the
golden section ratio ð 521 =2. The sequence is also applicable to
questions in phyllotaxy and organic growth.</p>
<p>A Solution of a Cubic Equation</p>
<p>The Liber abaci was Fibonacci’s best-known book, appearing in another
edition in 1228, but it was evidently not widely appreciated in the
schools, and it did not appear in print until the nineteenth century.
Fibonacci was without doubt the most original and most capable
mathematician of the medieval Christian world, but much of his work was
too advanced to be understood by his contemporaries. His treatises other
than the Liber abaci also contain many good things. In the Flos, dating
from 1225, there are indeterminate problems reminiscent of Diophantus
and determinate problems reminiscent of Euclid, the Arabs, and the
Chinese.</p>
<p>Fibonacci evidently drew from many and varied sources. Especially
interesting for its interplay of algorithm and logic is Fibonacci’s
treatment of the cubic equation x3 12x2 110x520. The author showed an
attitude close to that of the modern period in first proving the
impossibility of a root in the Euclidean sense, such as a ratio of
integers or a number of the form a1pb, where a and b are rational. As of
that time, this meant that the equation could not be solved exactly by
algebraic means. Fibonacci then went on to express the positive root
approximately as a sexagesimal fraction to half a dozen places—
1;22,7,42,33,4,40. This was a remarkable achievement, but we do not know
how he did it. Perhaps through the Arabs he had learned what we call
“Horner’s method,” a device known before this time in China, as we saw
earlier. This is the most accurate European approximation to an
irrational root of an algebraic equation up to that time or anywhere in
Europe for another 300 years and more. It is characteristic of the era
that Fibonacci should have used sexagesimal fractions in theoretical
mathematical work but not in mercantile affairs. Perhaps this explains
why the Hindu-Arabic numerals were not promptly used in astronomical
tables, such as the Alfonsine Tables of the thirteenth century. Where
the “Physicists’” (sexagesimal) fractions were in use, there was less
urgency in displacing them than there was in connection with the common
and unit fractions in commerce.</p>
<p>The Theory of Numbers and Geometry</p>
<p>In 1225, Fibonacci published not only the Flos, but also the Liber
quadratorum, a brilliant work on indeterminate analysis. This, like the
Flos, contains a variety of problems, some of which stemmed from the
mathematical contests held at the court of the emperor Frederick II, to
which Fibonacci had been invited. One of the proposed problems
strikingly resembles the type in which Diophantus had delighted—to find
a rational number such that if 5 is added to, or subtracted from, the
square of the number, the result will be the square of a rational
number. Both the problem and a solution, 3, are given in Liber
quadratorum.</p>
<p>The book makes frequent use of the identities ða2 1b2Þðc2
1d2Þ5ðac1bdÞ2 1ðbc2adÞ2 5ðad 1bcÞ2 1ðac2bdÞ2;</p>
<p>which had appeared in Diophantus and had been widely used by the
Arabs. Fibonacci, in some of his problems and methods, seems to closely
follow the Arabs.</p>
<p>Fibonacci was primarily an algebraist, but he also wrote, in 1220, a
book titled Practica geometriae. This seems to be based on an Arabic
version of Euclid’s Division of Figures (which is now lost) as well as
on Heron’s works on mensuration. It contains, among other things, a
proof that the medians of a triangle divide each other in the ratio 2 to
1 and a three-dimensional analogue of the Pythagorean theorem.
Continuing a Babylonian and Arabic tendency, he used algebra to solve
geometric problems.</p>
<h4 id="jordanus-nemorarius">Jordanus Nemorarius</h4>
<p>It will be clear from the few illustrations we have given that
Fibonacci was an unusually capable mathematician. It is true that he had
no worthy rival during the 900 years of medieval European culture, but
he was not quite the isolated figure he is sometimes held to be. He had
an able, though less gifted, younger contemporary in Jordanus Nemorarius
(1225 1260). Jordanus Nemorarius, or Jordanus de Nemore, represents a
more Aristotelian aspect of science than others we have met in the
thirteenth century, and he became the founder of what is sometimes known
as the medieval school of mechanics. To him, we owe the first correct
formulation of the law of the inclined plane, a law that the ancients
had sought in vain: the force along an oblique path is inversely
proportional to the obliquity, where obliquity is measured by the ratio
of a given segment of the oblique path to the amount of the vertical
intercepted by that path, that is, the “run” over the “rise.” In the
language of trigonometry, this means that F:W51/csc θ, which is
equivalent to</p>
<p>C amp anus of No vara</p>
<p>the modern formulation F5W sin θ, where W is weight, F is force, and
θ is the angle of inclination.</p>
<p>Jordanus was the author of books on arithmetic, geometry, and
astronomy, as well as mechanics. His Arithmetica, in particular, was the
basis of popular commentaries at the University of Paris as late as the
sixteenth century; this was not a book on computation but a
quasiphilosophical work in the tradition of Nicomachus and Boethius. It
contains such theoretical results as the theorem that any multiple of a
perfect number is abundant and that a divisor of a perfect number is
deficient. The Arithmetica is especially significant for the use of
letters instead of numerals as numbers, thus making possible the
statement of general algebraic theorems. In the arithmetical theorems in
Euclid’s Elements VII IX, numbers had been represented by line segments
to which letters had been attached, and the geometric proofs in
al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra made use of lettered diagrams, but all
coefficients in the equations used in the Algebra are specific numbers,
whether represented by numerals or written out in words. The idea of
generality is implied in al-Khwarizmi’s exposition, but he had no scheme
for expressing algebraically the general propositions that are so
readily available in geometry.</p>
<p>In the Arithmetica, the use of letters suggests the concept of
“parameter,” but Jordanus’s successors generally overlooked his scheme
of letters. They seem to have been more interested in the Arabic aspects
of algebra found in another Jordanian work, De numeris datis, a
collection of algebraic rules for finding, from a given number, other
numbers related to it according to certain conditions, or for showing
that a number satisfying specific restrictions is determined. A typical
instance is the following: if a given number is divided into two parts
such that the product of one part by the other is given, then each of
the two parts is necessarily determined.</p>
<p>It is greatly to his credit that he first stated the rule, equivalent
to the solution of a quadratic equation, completely in general form.
Only later did he provide a specific example of it, expressed in Roman
numerals: to divide the number X into two parts the product of which is
to be XXI, Jordanus follows through the steps indicated previously to
find that the parts are III and VII.</p>
<h4 id="campanus-of-novara">Campanus of Novara</h4>
<p>To Jordanus is also attributed an Algorismus (or Algorithmus)
demonstratus, an exposition of arithmetic rules that was popular for
three centuries. The Algorismus demonstratus again shows Boethian and
Euclidean inspiration, as well as Arabic algebraic characteristics.
Still greater preponderance of Euclidean influence is seen in the work
of Johannes CampanusofNovara(fl.ca.1260),thechaplaintoPopeUrbanIV.Tohim,
the late medieval period owed the authoritative translation of Euclid
from Arabic into Latin, the one that first appeared in printed form in
1482. In making the translation, Campanus used various Arabic sources,
as well as the earlier Latin version by Adelard. Both Jordanus and
Campanus discussed the angle of contact, or horn angle, a topic that
produced lively
discussionsinthelatermedievalperiod,whenmathematicstookonamore
philosophical and speculative aspect. Campanus noticed that if one
compared the angle of contact—that is, the angle formed by an arc of a
circle and the tangent at an end point—with the angle between two
straight lines, there appears to be an inconsistency with Euclid’s
Elements X.1, the fundamental proposition of the “method of exhaustion.”
The rectilineal angle is obviously greater than the horn angle. Then, if

ultimately we should reach a rectilineal angle less than the horn
angle,butthisobviouslyisnottrue.Campanuscorrectlyconcludedthatthe
proposition applies to magnitudes of the same kind, and horn angles are
different from rectilineal angles.</p>
<p>Similarity in the interests of Jordanus and Campanus is seen in the
fact that Campanus, at the end of Book IV of his translation of the
Elements, describes an angle trisection that is exactly the same as that
which had appeared in Jordanus’s De triangulis. The only difference is
that the

The trisection, unlike those in antiquity, is essentially as

at the center of a circle of any radius OA5OB (Fig. 12.1). From O draw a

that DE5OA. Finally, through O draw line OF parallel to AED. Then, +FOB
is one-third +AOB, as required.</p>

<p>Learning in the Thirteenth Century</p>
<p>In the work of Fibonacci, Western Europe had come to rival other
civilizations in the level of its mathematical achievement, but this was
only a small part of what was taking place in Latin culture as a whole.
Many of the famous universities—Bologna, Paris, Oxford, and
Cambridge—were established in the late twelfth and early thirteenth
centuries, and this was the period in which great Gothic
cathedrals—Chartres, Notre Dame, Westminster, Reims—were built.
Aristotelian philosophy and science had been recovered and were taught
in the universities and the church schools. The thirteenth century is
the period of great scholars and churchmen, such as Albertus Magnus,
Robert Grosseteste, Thomas Aquinas, and Roger Bacon. Two of these,
Grosseteste and Bacon, made strong pleas for the importance of
mathematics in the curriculum, although neither was himself much of a
mathematician. It was during the thirteenth century that many practical
inventions became known in Europe: gunpowder and the compass, both
perhaps from China, and spectacles from Italy, with mechanical clocks
appearing only a little later.</p>
<h4 id="archimedes-revived">Archimedes Revived</h4>
<p>The twelfth century had seen the great tide of translation from
Arabic into Latin, but there now were other crosscurrents of
translations. Most of the works of Archimedes, for example, had been
virtually unknown to the medieval West, but in 1269, William of Moerbeke
(ca. 1215 1286) published a translation (the original manuscript of
which was discovered in 1884 in the Vatican) from Greek into Latin of
the chief Archimedean scientific and mathematical treatises. Moerbeke,
who came from Flanders and was named Archbishop of Corinth, knew little
mathematics; hence, his excessively literal translation (helpful now in
reconstructing the original Greek text) was of limited usefulness, but
from this time on, most of Archimedes’ works were at least accessible.
In fact, the Moerbeke translation included parts of Archimedes’ works
with which the Arabs evidently were not familiar, such as the treatises
On Spirals, the Quadrature of the Parabola, and Conoids and Spheroids.
Nevertheless, the Muslims had been able to make more progress in
understanding the mathematics of Archimedes than did the Europeans
during the medieval period.</p>
<p>During the twelfth century, the works of Archimedes had not
completely escaped the attention of the indefatigable Gerard of Cremona,
who had converted into Latin an Arabic version of the short work
Measurement of the Circle, which was used in Europe for several
centuries. There had also circulated, before 1269, a portion of the
Archimedean Sphere and Cylinder. These two examples could provide only a
very inadequate idea of what Archimedes had done, and, therefore, the
translation by Moerbeke was of the greatest importance, including as it
did a number of major treatises. It is true that the version was only
occasionally used during the next two centuries, but it at least
remained extant. It was this translation that became known to Leonardo
da Vinci and other Renaissance scholars, and it was Moerbeke’s version
that was first printed in the sixteenth century.</p>
<h4 id="medieval-kinematics">Medieval Kinematics</h4>
<p>The history of mathematics has not been a record of smooth and
continuous development; hence, it should come as no surprise that the
upward surge during the thirteenth century should have lost some of its
momentum. There was no Latin equivalent of Pappus to stimulate a revival
of classical higher geometry. The works of Pappus were not available in
Latin or Arabic. Even Apollonius’s Conics was little known, beyond some
of the simplest properties of the parabola that arose in connection with
the ubiquitous treatises on optics, a branch of science that fascinated
the Scholastic philosophers. The science of mechanics, too, appealed to
the scholars of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, for now they
had at hand both the statics of Archimedes and the kinematics of
Aristotle.</p>
<p>We noted earlier that the Aristotelian conclusions on motion had not
gone unchallenged and modifications had been suggested, notably by
Philoponus. During the fourteenth century, the study of change, in
general, and of motion, in particular, was a favorite topic in the
universities, especially at Oxford and Paris. At Merton College in
Oxford, the Scholastic philosophers had deduced a formulation for
uniform rate of change that today is generally known as the Merton rule.
Expressed in terms of distance and time, the rule essentially says that
if a body moves with uniformly accelerated motion, then the distance
covered will be that which another body would have covered had it been
moving uniformly for the same length of time with a speed equal to that
of the first body at the midpoint of the time interval. As we should
formulate it, the average velocity is the arithmetic mean of the initial
and terminal velocities. Meanwhile, at the University of Paris, there
was developed a more specific and clear-cut doctrine of impetus than
that proposed by Philoponus. In it, we can recognize a concept akin to
our inertia.</p>
<h4 id="thomas-bradwardine">Thomas Bradwardine</h4>
<p>The late medieval physicists comprised a large group of university
teachers and churchmen, but we call attention to only two, for these
were also</p>
<p>T homa s Bra d war dine</p>
<p>prominent mathematicians. The first is Thomas Bradwardine (1290?
1349), a philosopher, a theologian, and a mathematician who rose to the
position of Archbishop of Canterbury; the second is Nicole Oresme (1323?
1382), a Parisian scholar who became the Bishop of Lisieux. To these two
men was due a broadened view of proportionality.</p>
<p>The Elements of Euclid had included a logically sound theory of
proportion, or the equality of ratios, and this had been applied by
ancient and medieval scholars to scientific questions. For a given time,
the distance covered in uniform motion is proportional to the speed, and
for a given distance, the time is inversely proportional to the
speed.</p>
<p>Aristotle had thought, none too correctly, that the speed of an
object subject to a moving force acting in a resisting medium is
proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the resistance.
In some respects, this formulation seemed to later scholars to
contradict common sense. When force F is equal to or less than
resistance, a velocity V will be imparted according to the law V 5KF /
R, where K is a nonzero constant of proportionality, but when resistance
balances or exceeds force, one should expect no velocity to be acquired.
To avoid this absurdity, Bradwardine made use of a generalized theory of
proportions. In his Tractatus de proportionibus of 1328, Bradwardine
developed the Boethian theory of double or triple or, more generally,
what we would call “n-tuple” proportion. His arguments are expressed in
words, but in modern notation we would say that in these cases,
quantities vary as the second or third or nth power. In the same way,
the theory of proportions included subduple or subtriple or subn-tuple
proportion, in which quantities vary as the second or third or nth
root.</p>
<p>Now Bradwardine was ready to propose an alternative to the
Aristotelian law of motion. To double a velocity that arises from some
ratio or proportion F/R, he said, it was necessary to square the ratio
F/R; to triple the velocity, one must cube the “proportio,” or ratio
F/R; to increase the velocity n-fold, one must take the nth power of the
ratio F/R. This is tantamount to asserting that velocity is given, in
our notation, by the relationship V5KlogF/R, for log(F/R)n 5nlogF/R.
That is, if V0 5logF0 /R0, then Vn 5log(F0 /R0)n 5nlogF0 /R0 5nV0.
Bradwardine himself evidently never sought experimental confirmation of
his law, and it seems not to have been widely accepted.</p>
<p>In addition, Bradwardine wrote several other mathematical works, all
pretty much in the spirit of the times. His Arithmetic and his Geometry
show the influence of Boethius, Aristotle, Euclid, and Campanus.
Bradwardine, known in his day as “Doctor profundus,” was also attracted
to topics such as the angle of contact and star polygons, both of which
occur in Campanus and earlier works. Star polygons, which include
regular polygons as special cases, go back to ancient times. A star
polygon is formed by connecting with straight lines every mth point,
starting from a given one, of the n points that divide the circumference
of a circle into n equal parts, where n.2 and m is prime to n. There is
in the Geometry even a touch of Archimedes’ Measurement of the Circle.
The philosophical bent in all of Bradwardine’s works is seen most
clearly in the Geometrica speculativa and the Tractatus de continuo, in
which he argued that continuous magnitudes, although including an
infinite number of indivisibles, are not made up of such mathematical
atoms but are instead composed of an infinite number of continua of the
same kind. His views are sometimes said to resemble those of the modern
intuitionists; at any rate, medieval speculations on the continuum,
popular among Scholastic thinkers such as Thomas Aquinas, later
influenced the Cantorian infinite of the nineteenth century.</p>
<h4 id="nicole-oresme">Nicole Oresme</h4>
<p>Nicole Oresme lived later than Bradwardine, and in the work of the
former, we see extensions of ideas of the latter. In De proportionibus
proportionum, composed about 1360, Oresme generalized Bradwardine’s
proportion theory to include any rational fractional power and to give
rules for combining proportions that are the equivalents of our laws of
exponents, now expressed in the notations xm xn 5xm1n and</p>
<p>(xm)n 5xmn. For each rule, specific instances are given, and the
latter part of another work, the Algorismus proportionum, applies the
rules in geometric and physical problems. Oresme also suggested the use
of special notations for fractional powers, for in his Algorismus
proportionum there are expressions such as</p>
<p>to denote the “one and one-half proportion,” that is, the cube of
the</p>
<p>principal square root, and forms such as</p>
<p>for p4 212. We now take for granted our symbolic notations for powers
and roots, with little thought for the slowness with which these
developed in the history of mathematics. Even more imaginative than
Oresme’s notations was his suggestion that irrational proportions are
possible. p2</p>
<p>Here, he was striving toward what we should write as x , for example,
which is perhaps the first hint in the history of mathematics of a
higher</p>
<p>T he L at i tude of F or ms</p>
<p>transcendental function, but lack of adequate terminology and
notation prevented him from effectively developing his notion of
irrational powers.</p>
<h4 id="the-latitude-of-forms">The Latitude of Forms</h4>
<p>The notion of irrational powers may have been Oresme’s most brilliant
idea, but it was not in this direction that he was most influential. For
almost a century before his time, Scholastic philosophers had been
discussing the quantification of variable “forms,” a concept of
Aristotle roughly equivalent to qualities. Among these forms were such
things as the velocity of a moving object and the variation in
temperature from point to point in an object with nonuniform
temperature. The discussions were interminably prolix, for the available
tools of analysis were inappropriate. Despite this handicap, the
logicians at Merton College had reached, as we saw, an important theorem
concerning the mean value of a “uniformly difform” form—that is, one in
which the rate of change of the rate of change is constant. Oresme was
well aware of this result, and a brilliant thought occurred to him,
sometime before 1361—why not draw a picture or a graph of the way in
which things vary? Here we see, of course, an early suggestion of what
we now describe as the graphical representation of functions. Marshall
Clagett has found what looks like an earlier graph, drawn by Giovanni di
Cosali, in which the line of longitude is placed in a vertical position
(Clagett 1959, pp. 332 333, 414). The exposition of Oresme surpasses
that of Cosali in clarity and influence, however.</p>
<p>Everything measurable, Oresme wrote, is imaginable in the manner of
continuous quantity; hence, he drew a velocity-time graph for a body
moving with uniform acceleration. Along a horizontal line, he marked
points that represented instants of time (or longitudes), and for each
instant he drew perpendicular to the line of longitudes a line segment
(latitude) the length of which represented the velocity. The end points
of these segments, he saw, lie along a straight line, and if the
uniformly accelerated motion starts from rest, the totality of velocity
lines (which we call ordinates) will make up the area of a right
triangle (see Fig. 12.2). Inasmuch as this area represents the distance
covered, Oresme has provided a geometric verification of the Merton
rule, for the velocity at the midpoint of the time interval is half of
the terminal velocity. Moreover, the diagram obviously leads to the law
of motion generally ascribed to Galileo in the seventeenth century. It
is clear from the geometric diagram that the area in the first half of
the time is to that in the second half in the ratio 1 : 3. If we
subdivide the time into three equal parts, the distances covered (given
by the areas) are in the ratio 1 : 3 : 5. For four equal subdivisions,
the</p>
<p>distances are in the ratio 1:3:5:7. In general, as Galileo later
observed, the distances are to one another as the odd numbers, and
because the sum of the first n consecutive odd numbers is the square of
n, the total distance covered varies as the square of the time, the
familiar Galilean law for falling bodies.</p>
<p>The terms “latitude” and “longitude” that Oresme used are in a
general sense equivalent to our ordinate and abscissa, and his graphical
representation is akin to our analytic geometry. His use of coordinates
was not, of course, new, for Apollonius and others before him had used
coordinate systems, but Oresme’s graphical representation of a variable
quantity was novel. He seems to have grasped the essential principle
that a function of one unknown can be represented as a curve, but he was
unable to make any effective use of this observation except in the case
of the linear function. Moreover, Oresme was chiefly interested in the
area under the curve; hence, it is not very likely that he saw that
every plane curve can be represented, with respect to a coordinate
system, as a function of one variable. Where we say that the velocity
graph in uniformly accelerated motion is a straight line, Oresme wrote,
“Any uniformly difform quality terminating in zero intensity is imagined
as a right triangle.” That is, Oresme was more concerned with (1) the
way in which the function varies (that is, the differential equation of
the curve), and (2) the way in which the area under the curve varies
(that is, the integral of the function). He pointed out the
constant-slope property for his graph of uniformly accelerated motion—an
observation equivalent to the modern two-point equation of the line in
analytic geometry and leading to the concept of the differential
triangle. Moreover, in finding the distance function, the area, Oresme
is obviously performing a simple integration geometrically that results
in the Merton rule. He did not explain why the area under a
velocity-time curve represents the distance covered, but it is probable
that he thought of the area as made up of many vertical lines or
indivisibles, each of which represented a velocity that continued for a
very short time.</p>
<p>Inf ini t e S er ie s</p>
<p>The graphical representation of functions, known then as the latitude
of forms, remained a popular topic from the time of Oresme to that of
Galileo. The Tractatus de latitudinibus formarum, written perhaps by a
student of Oresme’s, if not by Oresme himself, appeared in numerous
manuscript forms and was printed at least four times between 1482 and
1515, but this was only a pre´cis of a larger work by Oresme titled
Tractatus de figuratione potentiarum et mensurarum. Here, Oresme went so
far as to suggest a three-dimensional extension of his “latitude of
forms,” in which a function of two independent variables was pictured as
a volume made up of all of the ordinates erected according to a given
rule at points in a portion of the reference plane.</p>
<h4 id="infinite-series">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>Mathematicians of the Western world in the fourteenth century had
imagination and precision of thought, but they lacked algebraic and
geometric facility; hence, their contributions lay not in extensions of
classical work but in new points of view. Among these was an occupation
with infinite series, an essentially novel topic in the West anticipated
only by some ancient iterative algorithms and Archimedes’ summation of
an infinite geometric progression. Where the Greeks had a horror
infiniti, the late medieval Scholastic philosophers frequently referred
to the infinite, both as a potentiality and as an actuality (or
something “completed”). In England in the fourteenth century, a logician
by the name of Richard Suiseth (fl. ca. 1350), but better known as
Calculator, solved the following problem in the latitude of forms:</p>
<p>If throughout the first half of a given time interval a variation
continues at a certain intensity, throughout the next quarter of the
interval at double this intensity, throughout the following eighth at
triple the intensity and so ad infinitum; then the average intensity for
the whole interval will be the intensity of the variation during the
second subinterval (or double the initial intensity).</p>
<p>This is equivalent to saying that 111?12nn 1?52.</p>
<p>Calculator gave a long and tedious verbal proof, for he did not know
aboutgraphicalrepresentation,butOresmeusedhisgraphicalprocedureto prove
the theorem more easily. Oresme also handled other cases, such as</p>
<p>1U3 2U3 3U3 nU3</p>
<p>1 1 1?1 n 1? 4 16 64 4</p>
<p>in which the sum is . Problems similar to these continued to occupy
scholars during the next century and a half.</p>
<p>Among Oresme’s other contributions to infinite series was his proof
that the harmonic series is divergent. He grouped the successive terms
in the series</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>11 1 1 1 1 1?11?;</p>
<p>23 4 5 6 7 8 n</p>
<p>placing the first term in the first group, the next two terms in the
second group, the next four terms in the third group, and so on, the mth
group containing 2m 1 terms. Then, it is obvious that we have infinitely
many groups and that the sum of the terms within each group is at least
. Hence, by adding together enough terms in order, we can exceed any
given number.</p>
<h4 id="levi-ben-gerson">Levi ben Gerson</h4>
<p>Levi ben Gerson (1288 1344), a Jewish scholar living in Provence,
contributed a number of mathematical works in Hebrew. Provence then not
being part of France, where Jews were persecuted under Philip the Fair,
Levi ben Gerson benefited from the tolerant support of the Avignon pope
Clement VI and wrote one of his texts at the request of the Bishop of
Meaux. His scholarship was extensive; perhaps best known as a theologian
and a philosopher, he was well versed in numerous disciplines and
appears to have been respected by the educated elite of Provence. He was
an independent thinker, apparently questioning accepted belief in most
areas he studied, whether it was Jewish theology or Ptolemaic
astronomical doctrine.</p>
<p>He wrote the Art of Calculation in 1321, in which he described many
topics later found in courses of so-called higher algebra: extraction of
square roots and cube roots, the summation of series, permutations and
combinations, and binomial coefficients, among others. He provided
proofs using methods not customary at the time. In 1342, he wrote The
Harmony of Numbers, which contains a proof that (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and
(8,9) are the only pairs of consecutive numbers whose only factors are 2
or 3. His chief contributions to geometry consisted of two books, in one
of which he provided a commentary on the first five books of Euclid; he
also provided arguments concerning the independence of the parallel
postulate.</p>
<p>His largest work, The Wars of the Lord, which he wrote between 1317
and 1328, consists of six books. The fifth, a voluminous Astronomy,
translated into Latin at the Avignon court, included his On Sines,
Chords and Arcs, which was also issued separately. This contains his
main discussion of trigonometry, including proof of the sine theorem for
plane triangles and a discussion on the construction of tables for sines
and</p>
<p>T he D e c line of Me die val L e ar ning</p>
<p>versed sines. His tables are very accurate down to 3/4. His
astronomical contributions include descriptions of the Jacob’s staff,
which is used for measuring angular distances, and of other astronomical
measuring instruments, as well as the critique of Ptolemy alluded to
previously, which called for better coincidence of theory and
observation.</p>
<h4 id="nicholas-of-cusa">Nicholas of Cusa</h4>
<p>Oresme had argued that everything measurable can be represented by a
line (latitude), and a mathematics of mensuration, from both a
theoretical and a practical standpoint, would flourish during the early
Renaissance period. A similar view was adopted by Nicholas of Cusa (1401
1464), a man who well represents the weaknesses of the age, for he was
on the borderline between medieval and modern times. Nicholas saw that a
scholastic weakness in science had been a failure to measure; “mens,” he
thought, was etymologically related to “mensura,” so that knowledge must
be based on measurement.</p>
<p>Nicholas of Cusa was also influenced by the Humanist concern for
antiquity and espoused Neoplatonic views. Moreover, he studied the works
of Ramon Lull and had access to a translation of some of Archimedes’
works. But, alas, Nicholas of Cusa was better as an ecclesiastic than as
a mathematician. In the church, he rose to the rank of cardinal, but in
the field of mathematics, he is known as a misguided circle-squarer. His
philosophical doctrine of the “concordance of contraries” led him to
believe that maxima and minima are related, hence that the circle (a
polygon with the greatest possible number of sides) must be reconcilable
with the triangle (the polygon with the smallest number of sides). He
believed that through an ingenious averaging of inscribed and
circumscribed polygons, he had arrived at a quadrature. That he was
wrong was of less significance than that he was one of the first modern
Europeans to attempt a problem that had fascinated the best minds of
antiquity, and that his effort stimulated contemporaries to criticize
his work.</p>
<h4 id="the-decline-of-medieval-learning">The Decline of Medieval
Learning</h4>
<p>We have traced the history of mathematics in Europe through the Dark
Ages of the early medieval centuries to the high point in the time of
the Scholastics. From the nadir in the seventh century to the work of
Fibonacci and Oresme in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the
improvement had been striking, but medieval efforts were in no sense
comparable to the mathematical achievements in ancient Greece. The
progress of mathematics had not been steadily upward in any part of the
world—Babylonia, Greece, China, India, Islam, or the Roman Empire—and it
should come as no surprise that in Western Europe, a decline set in
after the work of Bradwardine and Oresme. In 1349, Thomas Bradwardine
had succumbed to the Black Death, the worst scourge ever to strike
Europe. Estimates of the number of those who died of the plague within
the short space of a year or two run between onethird and one-half of
the population. This catastrophe inevitably caused severe dislocations
and loss of morale. If we note that England and France, the nations that
had seized the lead in mathematics in the fourteenth century, were
further devastated in the fifteenth century by the Hundred Years’ War
and the Wars of the Roses, the decline in learning will be
understandable. Italian, German, and Polish universities during the
fifteenth century took over the lead in mathematics from the waning
Scholasticism of Oxford and Paris, and it is primarily to
representatives from these lands that we now turn.</p>

<p>The fall of Constantinople in 1453 signaled the collapse of the
Byzantine Empire. It is frequently asserted that at that time, refugees
fled to Italy with treasured manuscripts of ancient Greek treatises,
thereby putting the Western European world in touch with the works of
antiquity. It is as likely,
though,thatthefallofthecityhadjusttheoppositeeffect:thatnowtheWest could
no longer count on what had been a dependable source of manuscript
material for ancient classics, both literary and mathematical. Whatever
the ultimate decision may be on this matter, there can be no question
that mathematical activity was again rising during the middle years of
the fifteenthcentury.Europewasrecoveringfromthephysicalandspiritualshock

<p>The recovery of unfamiliar Greek geometric classics was at first less
significant than the printing of medieval Latin translations of Arabic
algebraic and arithmetic treatises, for few men of the fifteenth century
either read Greek or were sufficiently proficient in mathematics to
profit from the works of the better Greek geometers. In this respect,
mathematics differed from literature and even from the natural sciences.
As Humanists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries fell ever more
deeply in love with the newly rediscovered Greek treasures in science
and the arts, their estimate of the immediately preceding Latin and
Arabic achievements declined. On the other hand, classical mathematics,
except for the most elementary portions of Euclid, was accessible only
to those with a high degree of preliminary training; hence, the
disclosure of Greek treatises in this field did not at first seriously
impinge on the continuing medieval mathematical tradition. Medieval
Latin studies in elementary geometry and the theory of proportions, as
well as Arabic contributions to arithmetic operations and algebraic
methods, did not present difficulties comparable to those associated
with the works of Archimedes and Apollonius. It was the more elementary
branches that were to attract notice and to appear in printed works. At
the same time, significant differences characterizing the language and
scope of a reborn mathematics emerged. Probably no one’s life is more
representative of the changing factors that affected this transitional
period than that of the man known as Regiomontanus.</p>
<h4 id="regiomontanus">Regiomontanus</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most influential mathematician of the fifteenth century,
Johann Mu¨ller (1436 1476), born near Ko¨nigsberg in Franconia, adopted
the name Regiomontanus, the Latin form of “King’s Mountain.” A
precocious student with an early interest in mathematics and astronomy,
he attended the University of Leipzig before heading for the University
of Vienna at age fourteen, where he studied with Georg Peurbach (1423
1469), taught courses in geometry, and collaborated with Peurbach in
observational and theoretical studies of astronomy. A year before
Peurbach’s death, Cardinal Bessarion, then papal legate to the Holy
Roman Empire, who was known for his efforts on behalf of uniting the
Greek and Roman churches and for wishing to spread knowledge of the
Greek classics, came to Vienna. He had a special interest in seeing a
new translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest and suggested to Peurbach that he
undertake this work. Peurbach bequeathed the task to Regiomontanus, who
became attached to Bessarion, accompanying him to Rome,</p>
<p>Re giomont anus</p>
<p>spending time and lecturing at Padua when Bessarion became papal
legate to the Venetian Republic, and meeting numerous international
scholars, some of whom were influential in helping him gain access to
major observatories and library collections.</p>
<p>Among the cities in Central Europe where individuals and institutions
assumed leadership in mathematics and astronomy at this time were
Vienna, Cracow, Prague, and Nuremberg. It was Nuremberg where
Regiomontanus settled on returning to Germany; it would become a center
for the printing of books (as well as for learning, art, and invention),
and some of the greatest scientific classics were published there toward
the middle of the sixteenth century. In Nuremberg, Regiomontanus had
acquired a new patron, and with this merchant’s support, Regiomontanus
established a printing press and an observatory. The trade list of books
he hoped to print survives. It includes translations of works by
Archimedes, Apollonius, Heron, Ptolemy, and Diophantus. We also know of
a variety of astronomical instruments that he designed, including
torqueta, astrolabes, and other astronomical measuring devices; some
were built in his small workshop. Like his other plans, his hopes to
straighten out various discrepancies in astronomy remained largely
unfulfilled, however, because, having been called to Rome for a
conference on reform of the calendar, he died there under disputed
circumstances.</p>
<p>In astronomy, Regiomontanus’s chief contribution was the completion
of the new Latin version, begun by Peurbach, of Ptolemy’s Almagest. A
new textbook of astronomy, Peurbach’s Theoricae Novae Planetarum, was
published in Regiomontanus’s shop in 1472; it was an improvement on the
ubiquitous copies of the Sphere of Sacrobosco. Regiomontanus’s
translation project also resulted in textbooks of his own. His Epitome
of Ptolemy’s Almagest is noteworthy for its emphasis on the mathematical
portions that had often been omitted in commentaries dealing with
elementary descriptive astronomy. Of greater significance for
mathematics, however, was his De Triangulis Omnimodis, a systematic
account of the methods for solving triangles that marked the rebirth of
trigonometry.</p>
<p>Humanists, who insisted on elegance and purity in their classical
languages, welcomed new translations in the sciences, as well as the
humanities, because they abhorred the barbarous medieval Latin, as well
as the Arabic from which it often was derived. Regiomontanus shared the
Humanists’ love of classical learning, but unlike most of them, he
respected the traditions of Scholastic and Islamic scholarship, as well
as the practical innovations of mathematical practitioners.</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry-2">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The first book of De Triangulis, composed about 1464, opens with
fundamental notions, derived largely from Euclid, on magnitudes and
ratios; then there are more than fifty propositions on the solution of
triangles, using the properties of right triangles. Book II begins with
a clear statement and proof of the law of sines and then includes
problems on determining sides, angles, and areas of plane triangles when
given determinate conditions. Among the problems, for example, is the
following: if the base of a triangle and the angle opposite are known,
and if either the altitude to the base or the area is given, then the
sides can be found. Book III contains theorems of the sort found in
ancient Greek texts on “spherics” before the use of trigonometry; Book
IV is on spherical trigonometry, including the spherical law of
sines.</p>
<p>The use of area “formulas,” written out in words, was among the
novelties in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, but in the avoidance of the
tangent function, the work falls short of al-Tusi’s (Nasir Eddin’s)
treatment. The tangent function nevertheless was included in another
trigonometric treatise by Regiomontanus—Tabulae Directionum.</p>
<p>Revisions of Ptolemy had suggested the need for new tables, and these
were supplied by a number of fifteenth-century astronomers, of whom
Regiomontanus was one. In order to avoid fractions, it was customary to
adopt a large value for the radius of the circle, or the sinus totus.
For one of his sine tables, Regiomontanus followed his immediate
predecessors in using a radius of 600,000; for others, he adopted
10,000,000 or 600,000,000. For his tangent table in Tabulae Directionum,
he chose 100,000. He does not call the function “tangent” but uses only
the word “numerus” for the entries, degree by degree, in a tabulation
headed “Tabula fecunda” (“Productive Table”). The entry for 89 is
5,729,796, and for 90 it is simply infinite.</p>
<p>The sudden death of Regiomontanus occurred before his two
trigonometric works were published, and this considerably delayed their
effect. The Tabulae Directionum was published in 1490, but the more
important treatise, De Triangulis, appeared in print only in 1533 (and
again in 1561). Nevertheless, the works were known in manuscript form to
the circle of mathematicians in Nuremberg, where Regiomontanus was
working, and it is very likely that they influenced work of the early
sixteenth century.</p>
<h2 id="algebra">Algebra</h2>
<p>A general study of triangles led Regiomontanus to consider problems
of geometric construction somewhat reminiscent of Euclid’s Division of
Figures. For example, one is asked to construct a triangle given one
side, the altitude to this side, and the ratio of the other two sides.
Here, however, we find a striking departure from ancient customs:
whereas Euclid’s problems invariably had been given in terms of general
quantities, Regiomontanus gave his lines specific numerical values, even
where he intended that his methods should be general. This enabled him
to make use of the algorithmic methods developed by Arabic algebraists
and</p>

familiar from Euclid’s Elements or al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra. (As
Regiomontanus expressed it, he let one part be the “thing” and then
solved by the rule of “thing” and “square”—that is, through quadratic
equations.) Another problem in which Regiomontanus called for the
construction of a cyclic quadrilateral, given the four sides, can be
handled similarly.</p>

adherence to the rhetorical form of expression and by his early death;
his manuscripts, on his death, came into the hands of his Nuremberg
patron, who failed to make the work effectively accessible to posterity.
Europe learned its algebra painfully and slowly from the thin Greek,
Arabic, and Latin traditions that trickled down through the
universities, the church scribes, rising mercantile activities, and
scholars from other fields.</p>
<p>Nicolas Chuquet’s Triparty</p>
<p>It was Germany and Italy that provided most of the early Renaissance
mathematicians, but in France in 1484 a manuscript was composed that in
level and significance was perhaps the most outstanding algebra since
the Liber abaci of Fibonacci almost three centuries earlier and that,
like the Liber abaci, was not printed until the nineteenth century. This
work, titled Triparty en la science des nombres, was by Nicolas Chuquet
(1445 1488), about whom we know virtually nothing except that he was
born in Paris, attained his bachelor’s degree in medicine, and practiced
in Lyons. The Triparty does not closely resemble any earlier work in
arithmetic or algebra, and the only writers the author mentions are
Boethius and Campanus. There is evidence of Italian influence, which
possibly resulted from acquaintance with Fibonacci’s Liber abaci.</p>
<p>The first of the “Three Parts” concerns the rational arithmetic
operations on numbers, including an explanation of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. Of these, Chuquet said that “the tenth figure does not have or
signify a value, and hence it is called cipher or nothing or figure of
no value.” The work is essentially rhetorical, the four fundamental
operations being indicated by the words and the phrases plus, moins,
multiplier par, and partyr par, the first two sometimes abbreviated in
the medieval manner as p and m. In connection with the computation of
averages, Chuquet gave a regle des nombres moyens, according to which
(a1c)/(b1d) lies between a/b and c/d if a, b, c, d are positive numbers.
In the second part, concerning roots of numbers, there is some
syncopation, so that the modern expression 142p180 appears in the not
very dissimilar form R)2.14.m.R)2180.</p>
<p>The last and by far the most important part of the Triparty concerns
the “Regle des premiers,” that is, the rule of the unknown, or what we
should call algebra. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there
were various names for the unknown thing, such as res (in Latin) or
chose (in French) or cosa (in Italian) or coss (in German); Chuquet’s
word “premier” is unusual in this connection. The second power he called
champs (whereas the Latin had been census), the third cubiez, and the
fourth champs de champ. For multiples of these, Chuquet invented an
exponential notation of great significance. The denomination or power of
the unknown quantity was indicated by an exponent associated with the
coefficient of the term, so that our modern expressions 5x and 6x2 and
l0x3 appeared in the Triparty as .5.1 and .6.2 and .10.3. Moreover, zero
and negative exponents take their place along with the positive integral
powers, so that our 9x0 became .9.0, and 9x 2 was written as .9.2.m,
meaning .9. seconds moins. Such a notation laid bare the laws of
exponents, with which Chuquet may have become familiar through the work
of Oresme on proportions. Chuquet wrote, for example, that .72.1 divided
by .8.3 is .9.2.m—that is, 72x48x3 59x 2. Related to these laws is his
observation of the relationships between the powers of the number 2 and
the indices of these powers set out in a table from 0 to 20, in which
sums of the indices correspond to products of the powers. Except for the
magnitude of the gaps between entries, this constituted a miniature
table of logarithms to the base 2. Observations similar to those of
Chuquet were to be repeated several times during the next century, and
these undoubtedly played a role in the ultimate invention of
logarithms.</p>
<p>The second half of the last part of the Triparty is devoted to the
solution of equations. Here are many of the problems that had appeared
among his predecessors’ works, but there is also at least one
significant novelty. In writing.4.1 egaulx a m.2.0 (that is,
4x522),Chuquet wasfor thefirst time expressing an isolated negative
number in an algebraic equation. Generally, he rejected zero as a root
of an equation, but on one occasion, he remarked that the number sought
was 0. In considering equations of the form axm 1bxm1n 5cx m12n (where
the coefficients and the exponents are specific positive integers), he
found that some implied imaginary solutions; in these cases, he simply
added, “Tel nombre est ineperible.”</p>
<p>The Triparty of Chuquet, like the Collectio of Pappus, is a book in
which the extent of the author’s originality cannot be determined. Each
undoubtedly was indebted to his immediate predecessors, but we are
unable to identify any of them. Moreover, in the case of Chuquet, we
cannot determine his influence on later writers. The Triparty was not
printed until 1880 and probably was known to few mathematicians, but one
of those into whose hands it fell used so much of the material that by
modern standards, he might be charged with plagiarism, even though he
mentioned Chuquet’s name. The Larismethique nouvellement composee,
published in Lyons by Etienne de la Roche in 1520 and again in 1538,
depended heavily, as we now know, on Chuquet; hence, it is safe to say
that the Triparty was not without effect.</p>

the three headed figure in the center are grouped the seven liberal

<h4 id="luca-paciolis-summa">Luca Pacioli’s Summa</h4>
<p>The earliest Renaissance algebra, that of Chuquet, was the product of
a Frenchman, but the best-known algebra of that period was published ten
years later in Italy. In fact, the Summa de Arithmetica, Geometrica,
Proportioni et Proportionalita of the friar Luca Pacioli (1445 1514)
overshadowed the Triparty so thoroughly that older historical accounts
of algebra leap directly from the Liber abaci of 1202 to the Summa of
1494 without mentioning the work of Chuquet or other intermediaries.</p>
<p>The way for the Summa, however, had been prepared by a generation of
algebraists, for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi was translated into Italian
at least by 1464, the date of a manuscript copy in the Plimpton
Collection in New York; the writer of this manuscript stated that he
based his work on numerous predecessors in this field, naming some from
the earlier fourteenth century. The Renaissance in science is often
assumed to have been sparked by the recovery of ancient Greek works, but
the Renaissance in mathematics was especially characterized by the rise
of algebra, and in this respect, it was but a continuation of the
medieval tradition.</p>
<p>TheSumma,thewritingofwhichhadbeencompletedby1487,wasmore influential
than it was original. It is an impressive compilation (with sources of
information not generally indicated) of material in four fields:
arithmetic, algebra, very elementary Euclidean geometry, and doubleentry
bookkeeping. Pacioli (also known as Luca di Borgo) for a time had been a
tutor to the sons of a wealthy merchant in Venice, and he was
undoubtedly familiar with the rising importance of commercial arithmetic
in Italy. The earliest printed arithmetic, appearing anonymously at
Treviso in 1478, had featured the fundamental operations, the rules of
two and three, and business applications. Several more technical
commercial arithmetics appeared shortly thereafter, and Pacioli borrowed
freely from them. One of these, the Compendia de lo abaco of Francesco
Pellos (fl. 1450 1500), which was published at Torino in the year
Columbus discovered America, made use of a dot to denote the division of
an integer by a power of 10, thus adumbrating our decimal point.</p>
<p>The Summa, which like the Triparty was written in the vernacular, was
a summing up of unpublished works that the author had composed earlier,
as well as of general knowledge at the time. The portion on arithmetic
is much concerned with devices for multiplication and for finding square
roots; the section on algebra includes the standard solution of linear
and quadratic equations. Although it lacks the exponential notation of
Chuquet, there is increased use of syncopation through abbreviations.
The letters p and m were by this time widely used in Italy for addition
and subtraction, and Pacioli used co, ce, and ae for cosa (the unknown),
censo (the square of the unknown), and aequalis, respectively. For the
fourth power of the unknown, he naturally used cece (for square-square).
Echoing a sentiment of Omar Khayyam, he believed that cubic equations
could not be solved algebraically.</p>
<p>Pacioli’s work in geometry in the Summa was not significant, although
some of his geometric problems remind one of the geometry of
Regiomontanus, specific numerical cases being employed. Although
Pacioli’s geometry did not attract much attention, so popular did the
commercial aspect of the book become that the author is generally
regarded as the father of double-entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Pacioli, the first mathematician of whom we have an authentic
portrait, in 1509 tried his hand twice more at geometry, publishing an
undistinguished</p>
<p>Ger man A lgeb ra s and Ar i t hme t ic s</p>
<p>edition of Euclid and a work with the impressive title De Divina
Proportione. The latter concerns regular polygons and solids and the
ratio later known as “the golden section.” It is noteworthy for the
excellence of the figures, which have been attributed to Leonardo da
Vinci (1452 1519). Leonardo is frequently thought of as a mathematician.
In his notebooks, we find quadratures of lunes, constructions of regular
polygons, and thoughts on centers of gravity and on curves of double
curvature, but he is best known for his application of mathematics to
science and the theory of perspective. Hundreds of years later,
Renaissance notions on mathematical perspective were to blossom into a
new branch of geometry, but these developments were not perceptibly
influenced by the thoughts that the lefthanded Leonardo entrusted to his
notebooks in the form of mirror-written entries. Da Vinci is pictured as
the typical all-round Renaissance man, and in fields other than
mathematics, there is much to support such a view. Leonardo was a genius
of bold and original thought, a man of action as well as contemplation,
at once an artist and an engineer. Yet he appears not to have been in
close touch with the chief mathematical trend of the time—the
development of algebra.</p>
<h4 id="german-algebras-and-arithmetics">German Algebras and
Arithmetics</h4>
<p>The word “Renaissance” inevitably brings to mind Italian literary,
artistic, and scientific treasures, for renewed interest in art and
learning became apparent in Italy earlier than in other parts of Europe.
There, in a roughand-tumble conflict of ideas, men learned to put
greater trust in independent observations of nature and judgments of the
mind. Moreover, Italy had been one of the two chief avenues along which
Arabic learning, including algorism and algebra, had entered Europe.
Nevertheless, other parts of Europe did not remain far behind, as the
work of Regiomontanus
andChuquetshows.InGermany,forexample,booksonalgebrabecameso numerous
that for a time, the Germanic word “coss” for the unknown triumphed in
other parts of Europe, and the subject became known as the
“cossicart.”Moreover,theGermanicsymbolsforadditionandsubtraction
ultimately displaced the Italian p and m. In 1489, before the
publication of Pacioli’s Summa, a German lecturer (“Master in the
Liberal Arts”) at Leipzig, Johann Widman (1462 1498), had published a
commercial arithmetic, Behendeund hu¨bsche Rechnungauff allen
Kauffmanschafften, theoldestbookinwhichourfamiliar 1
and2signsappearinprint.Atfirst used to indicate excess and deficiency in
warehouse measures, they later became symbols of the familiar arithmetic
operations. Widman, incidentally,possesseda manuscriptcopyof the
Algebraof al-Khwarizmi,a work well known to other German
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Among the numerous Germanic algebras was Die Coss, written in 1524 by
Germany’s celebrated Rechenmeister Adam Riese (1492 1559). The author
was the most influential German writer in the move to replace the old
computation (in terms of counters and Roman numerals) with the newer
method (using the pen and Hindu-Arabic numerals). So effective were his
numerous arithmetic books that the phrase “nach Adam Riese” still
survives in Germany as a tribute to accuracy in arithmetic processes.
Riese, in his Coss, mentions the Algebra of al-Khwarizmi and refers to a
number of Germanic predecessors in the field.</p>
<p>The first half of the sixteenth century saw a flurry of German
algebras, among the most important of which were the Coss (1525) of
Christoph Rudolff (ca. 15002ca. 1545), a tutor of mathematics in Vienna;
the Rechnung (1527) of Peter Apian(1495 1552);and the ArithmeticaIntegra
(1544) of Michael Stifel (ca. 1487 1567). The first is especially
significant as one of theearliest printedworkstomake
useofdecimalfractions, as well as of the modern symbol for roots; the
second is worth recalling for the fact that here, in a commercial
arithmetic, the so-called Pascal triangle was printed on the title page,
almost a century before Pascal was born. The third work, Stifel’s
Arithmetica Integra, was the most important of all of the
sixteenth-century German algebras. It, too, includes the Pascal
triangle, but</p>
<p>Title page of an edition (1529) of one of the Rechenbucher of Adam
Riese, the Rechenmeister. It depicts a contest between an algorist and
an abacist.</p>
<p>it is more significant for its treatment of negative numbers,
radicals, and powers. Through the use of negative coefficients in
equations, Stifel was able to reduce the multiplicity of cases of
quadratic equations to what
appearedtobeasingleform,buthehadtoexplain,underaspecialrule,when to
use1and when 2. Moreover, even he failed to admit negative numbers as
roots of an equation. Stifel, a onetime monk turned itinerant Lutheran
preacher and for a time professor of mathematics at Jena, was one of the
many writers who popularized the “German” symbols 1 and 2 at the expense
of the “Italian” p and m notation. He was thoroughly familiar with the
properties of negative numbers, despite the fact that he called them
“numeri absurdi.” About irrational numbers he was somewhat hesitant,
saying that they are “hidden under some sort of cloud of infinitude.”
Again calling attention to the relations between arithmetic and
geometric progressions, as had Chuquet for powers of 2 from 0 to 20,
Stifel extended the table to include 21 5 and 22 5 and 23 5 (without,
however, using
exponentialnotation).Forpowersoftheunknownquantityinalgebra,Stifel in
Arithmetica Integra used abbreviations for the German words “coss,”
“zensus,” “cubus,” and “zenzizensus,” but in a later treatise, De
Algorithmi Numerorum Cossicorum, he proposed using a single letter for
the unknown and repeating the letter for higher powers of the unknown, a
scheme later employed by Thomas Harriot (1560 1621).</p>
<h4 id="cardans-ars-magna">Cardan’s Ars Magna</h4>
<p>The Arithmetica Integra was as thorough a treatment of algebra as was
generally known up to 1544, yet by the following year, it was in a sense
quite outmoded. Stifel gave many examples that led to quadratic
equations,butnoneofhisproblemsledtomixedcubicequations,forthesimple
reason that he knew no more about the algebraic solution of the cubic
than did Pacioli or Omar Khayyam. In 1545, however, the solution not
only of the cubic, but also of the quartic, became common knowledge
through the publication of the Ars Magna of Geronimo Cardano (1501
1576). Such a striking and unanticipated development made so strong an
impact on algebraists that the year 1545 is frequently taken to mark the
beginning of the modern period in mathematics. It must immediately be
pointed out, however, that Cardano (or Cardan) was not the original
discoverer of the solution of either the cubic or the quartic. He
himself candidly admitted this in his book. The hint for solving the
cubic, he averred, he had obtained from Niccolo Tartaglia (ca. 1500
1557); the solution of the quartic was first discovered by Cardan’s
quondam amanuensis, Ludovico Ferrari (1522 1565). What Cardan failed to
mention in Ars Magna is the solemn oath he had sworn to Tartaglia that
he would not disclose the secret, for the latter intended to make his
reputation by publishing the solution of the cubic as the crowning part
of his treatise on algebra.</p>
<p>Lest one feel undue sympathy for Tartaglia, it may be noted that he
had published an Archimedean translation (1543), derived from Moerbeke,
leaving the impression that it was his own, and in his Quesiti et
Inventioni Diverse (Venice, 1546), he gave the law of the inclined
plane, presumably derived from Jordanus Nemorarius, without proper
credit. It is, in fact, possible that Tartaglia himself had received a
hint concerning the solution of the cubic from an earlier source.
Whatever may be the truth in a rather complicated and sordid controversy
between proponents of Cardan and Tartaglia, it is clear that neither of
the principals was the first to make the discovery. The hero in the case
evidently was one whose name is scarcely remembered today—Scipione del
Ferro (ca. 1465 1526), a professor of mathematics at Bologna, one of the
oldest of the medieval universities and a school with a strong
mathematical tradition. How or when del Ferro made his wonderful
discovery is not known. He did not publish the solution, but before his
death he disclosed it to a student, Antonio Maria Fior (or Floridus in
Latin).</p>
<p>Word of the existence of an algebraic solution of the cubic seems to
have gotten around, and Tartaglia told us that knowledge of the
possibility of solving the equation inspired him to devote his time to
discovering the method for himself. Whether independently or on the
basis of a hint, Tartaglia did indeed learn, by 1541, how to solve cubic
equations. When news of this spread, a mathematical contest between Fior
and Tartaglia was arranged. Each contestant proposed thirty questions
for the other to solve within a stated time interval. When the day for
the decision had arrived, Tartaglia had solved all questions posed by
Fior, whereas the unfortunate Fior had not solved a single one set by
his opponent. The explanation is relatively simple. Today we think of
cubic equations as all essentially of one type and as amenable to a
single unified method of solution. At that time, however, when negative
coefficients were virtually unused, there were as many types of cubics
as there are possibilities in positive or negative signs for
coefficients. Fior was able to solve only equations of the type in which
cubes and roots equal a number, that is, those of the type x3 1px5q,
although at that time only specific numerical (positive) coefficients
were used. Tartaglia, meanwhile, had also learned how to solve equations
of the form where cubes and squares equal a number. It is likely that
Tartaglia had learned how to reduce this case to Fior’s by removing the
squared term, for it became known by this time that if the leading
coefficient is unity, then the coefficient of the squared term, when it
appears on the other side of the equality sign, is the sum of the
roots.</p>
<p>News of Tartaglia’s triumph reached Cardan, who promptly invited the
winner to his home, with a hint that he would arrange to have him meet a
prospective patron. Tartaglia had been without a substantial source of
support,partlyperhapsbecauseofaspeechimpediment.Asachild,hehad received
a saber cut in the fall of Brescia to the French in 1512, which impaired
his speech. This earned him the nickname “Tartaglia,” or</p>
<p>“stammerer,” a name that he thereafter used instead of the name
“Niccolo Fontana” that had been given him at birth. Cardan, in contrast
to Tartaglia, had achieved worldly success as a physician. So great was
his fame that he was once called to Scotland to diagnose an ailment of
the Archbishop of St. Andrews (evidently, a case of asthma). By birth
illegitimate and by habit an astrologer, a gambler, and a heretic,
Cardan was nevertheless a respected professor at Bologna and Milan, and,
ultimately, he was granted a pension by the pope. One of his sons
poisoned his own wife, the other son was a scoundrel, and Cardan’s
secretary Ferrari probably died of poison at the hands of his own
sister. Despite such distractions, Cardan was a prolific writer on
topics ranging from his own life and praise of gout to science and
mathematics.</p>
<p>In his chief scientific work, a ponderous volume with the title De
Subtilitate, Cardan is clearly a child of his age, interminably
discussing the Aristotelian physics handed down through Scholastic
philosophy, while at the same time waxing enthusiastic about the new
discoveries of the then recent times. Much the same can be said of his
mathematics, for this, too, was typical of the day. He knew little of
Archimedes and less of Apollonius, but he was thoroughly familiar with
algebra and trigonometry. He had already published a Practica
Arithmetice in 1539, which included, among other things, the
rationalization of denominators containing cube roots. By the time he
published the Ars Magna, half a dozen years later, he was probably the
ablest algebraist in Europe. Nevertheless, the Ars Magna makes dull
reading today. Case after case of the cubic equation is laboriously
worked out in detail, according as terms of the various degrees appear
on the same or on opposite sides of the equality, for coefficients were
necessarily positive. Despite the fact that he was dealing with
equations on numbers, he followed al-Khwarizmi in thinking
geometrically, so that we might refer to his method as “completing the
cube.” There are, of course, certain advantages in such an approach. For
instance, because x3 is a volume, 6x, in Cardan’s following equation,
must also be thought of as a volume. Hence, the number 6 must have the
dimensionality of an area, suggesting the type of substitution that
Cardan used, as we shall shortly see.</p>
<p>Cardan used little syncopation, being a true disciple of
al-Khwarizmi, and, like the Arabs, he thought of his equations with
specific numerical coefficients as representative of general categories.
For example, when he wrote,“Letthe cubeandsixtimesthesidebe
equalto20”(orx3 16x 5 20),
heobviouslythoughtofthisequationastypicalofallofthosehaving“acube and
thing equal to a number”—that is, of the form x3 1px5q. The solution of
this equation covers a couple of pages of rhetoric that we should now
put in symbols as follows: Substitute u2v for x and let u and v be
related so that their product (thought of as an area) is one-third the x
coefficient in the cubic equation—that is, uv52. On substitution in the
equation, the result is u3 2v3 520, and, on eliminating v, we have u6
520u3 18, a quadratic in u3. Hence, u3 is known to be p108110. From the
relationship u3 2v3 520, we see that v3 5p108210: hence, from x5u2v, we
have x5 3 p1081102 3 p108210. Having carried through the method for this
specific case, Cardan closed with a verbal formulation of the rulep p 3
equivalent to our modern solution of x 1px5q as x5r3 qðp=3Þ3 1ðq=2Þ2
1q=22r3 qðp=3Þ3 1ðq=2Þ2 2q=2</p>
<p>Cardan then went on to other cases, such as “cube equal to thing and
number.” Here, one makes the substitution x5u1v, instead of x5 u2v, the
rest of the method remaining essentially the same. In this case,
however, there is a difficulty. When the rule is applied to x3 5 15x14,
for example, the result is x5 3 21 2p 1211 3 22 2p 121.</p>
<p>Cardanknewthattherewasnosquarerootofanegativenumber,yetheknewp p
x54tobearoot.Hewasunabletounderstandhowhisrulecouldmakesense in this
situation. He had toyed with square roots of negative numbers in another
connection when he asked thatonedivide 10 into two parts such that the
product of the parts is 40. The usual rules of algebra lead to the
answers 51 2p 15 and 52 2p 15 (or, in Cardan’s notation, 5p:Rm:15 and
5m:Rm:15. Cardan referred to these square roots of negative numbers as
“sophistic” and concluded that his result in this case was “as subtile
as it is useless.” Later writers were to show that such manipulations
were indeed subtle but far from useless. It is to Cardan’s credit that
at least he paid some attention to this puzzling situation.</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Solution of the Quartic Equation</p>
<p>Of the rule for solving quartic equations, Cardan in the Ars Magna
wrote that it “is due to Luigi Ferrari, who invented it at my request.”
Again separate cases, twenty in all, are considered in turn, but for the
modern reader, one case will suffice. Let square-square and square and
number be equal to side. (Cardan knew how to eliminate the cubic term by
increasing or diminishing the roots by one-fourth of the coefficient in
the cubic term.) Then, the steps in the solution of x4 16x2 136560x are
expressed by Cardan essentially as follows:</p>
<p>1.First, add enough squares and numbers to both sides to make the
lefthand side a perfect square.</p>
<p>2.Now add to both sides of the equation terms involving a newunknown
y such that the left-hand side remains a perfect square.</p>
<p>3.The next, and crucial, step is to choose y so that the trinomial on
the right-hand side will be a perfect square. This is done, of course,
by setting thediscriminantequalto zero, an ancient
andwell-knownrule.</p>
<p>4.The result of step 3 is a cubic equation in y: y3 115y2 136y5450,
today known as the “resolvent cubic” for the given quartic equation.
This is now solved for y by the rules previously given for the solution
of cubic equations.</p>
<p>5.Substitute a value of y from step 4 into the equation for x in step
2 and take the square root of both sides.</p>
<p>6.The result of step 5 is a quadratic equation, which must now
besolved to find the value of x desired.</p>
<p>The solution of cubic and quartic equations was perhaps the greatest
contribution to algebra since the Babylonians, almost four millennia
earlier, had learned how to complete the square for quadratic equations.
No other discoveries had had quite the stimulus to algebraic development
as did those disclosed in the Ars Magna. The solutions of the cubic and
the quartic were in no sense the result of practical considerations, nor
were they of any value to engineers or mathematical practitioners.
Approximate solutions of some cubic equations had been known in
antiquity, and al-Kashi a century before Cardan could have solved to any
desired degree of accuracy any cubic equation resulting from a practical
problem. The Tartaglia-Cardan formula is of great logical significance,
but it is not nearly so useful for applications as are methods of
successive approximation.</p>
<p>Influence of the Ars Magna</p>
<p>The most important outcome of the discoveries published in the Ars
Magna was the tremendous stimulus they gave to algebraic research in
various directions. It was natural that study should be generalized and
that, in particular, a solution should be sought for the quintic. Here,
mathematicians were faced with an unsolvable algebraic problem
comparable to the classical geometric problems of antiquity. Much good
mathematics, but only a negative conclusion, was the outcome.</p>
<p>Another immediate result of the solution of the cubic was the first
significant glance at a new kind of number. Irrational numbers had been
accepted by the time of Cardan, even though they were not soundly based,
for they are readily approximated by rational numbers. Negative numbers
afforded more difficulty because they are not readily approximated by
positive numbers, but the notion of sense (or direction on a line) made
them plausible. Cardan used them even while calling them numeri ficti.
If an algebraist wished to deny the existence of irrational or negative
numbers, he would simply say, as had the ancient Greeks, that the
equations x2 52 and x1250 are not solvable. In a similar way,
algebraists had been able to avoid imaginaries simply by saying that an
equation such as x2 1150 is not solvable. There was no need for square
roots of negative numbers. With the solution of the cubic equation,
however, the situation became markedly different. Whenever the three
roots of a cubic equation are real and different from zero, the
CardanTartaglia formula inevitably leads to square roots of negative
numbers. The goal was known to be a real number, but it could not be
reached without understanding something about imaginary numbers. The
imaginary now had to be reckoned with, even if one did agree to restrict
oneself to real roots.</p>
<h4 id="rafael-bombelli">Rafael Bombelli</h4>
<p>At this stage, Rafael Bombelli (1526 1572), a largely self-taught
Florentine hydraulic engineer studying the algebraic publications of his
time, had what he called “a wild thought,” for the whole matter “seemed
to rest on sophistry.” The two radicands of the cube roots resulting
from the usual formula differ only in one sign. We have seen that the
solution by</p>
<p>R afael B omb elli</p>
<p>formula of x3 515x14 leads to x5 3 21 2p 1211 3 22 2p 121, whereas it
is known by direct substitution thatp x54 is the only positivep root of
the equation. (Cardan had noted that when all terms on one side of the
equality sign are of higher degree than the terms on the other side, the
equation has one and only one positive root—an anticipation, in a small
way, of part of Descartes’ rule of signs.) Bombelli had the happy
thought that the radicals themselves might be related in much the way
that the radicands are related; that, as we should now say, they are
conjugate imaginaries that lead to the real number 4. It is obvious that
if the sum of the real parts is 4, then the real part of each is 2, and
if a number of the form 21bp21 is to be a cube root of 2111p21, then it
is easy to see that b must be 1. Hence, x5211p2112 21p21, or 4.</p>
<p>Through his ingenious reasoning, Bombelli had shown the important
role that conjugate imaginary numbers were to play in the future. But at
that time, the observation was of no help in the actual work of solving
cubic equations, for Bombelli had had to know beforehand what one of the
roots is. In this case, the equation is already solved, and no formula
is needed; without such foreknowledge, Bombelli’s approach fails. Any
attempt to find algebraically the cube roots of the imaginary numbers in
the Cardan-Tartaglia rule leads to the very cubic in the solution of
which the cube roots arose in the first place, so that one is back where
one started from. Because this impasse arises whenever all three roots
are real, this is known as the “irreducible case.” Here, an expression
for the unknown is indeed provided by the formula, but the form in which
this appears is useless for most purposes.</p>
<p>Bombelli composed his Algebra in about 1560, but it was not printed
until 1572, about a year before he died, and then only in part. One of
the significant things about this book is that it contains symbolisms
reminiscent of those of Chuquet. Bombelli sometimes wrote 1 Z p.5Rm.4
(that is, 1 zenus plus 5 res minus 4) for x2 15x24. But he also used
another form of expression, influenced perhaps by de la Roche’s
Larismethique, in which the power of the unknown quantity is represented
simply as an Arabic numeral above a short circular arc. Books IV and VI
of his Algebra are full of problems in geometry that are solved
algebraically, somewhat in the manner of Regiomontanus but making use of
new symbolisms. In problems such as that of finding the side of a square
inscribed in a certain triangle, a highly symbolic algebra comes to the
aid of geometry, but Bombelli worked in the other direction, too. In the
Algebra, the algebraic solution of cubic equations is accompanied by
geometric demonstrations in terms of the subdivision of the cube.
Unfortunately for the future of geometry—and of mathematics in
general—the last books of Bombelli’s Algebra were not included in the
publication of 1572 but remained in manuscript until 1929.</p>
<p>The Algebra uses the standard Italian symbols p and m for addition
and subtraction, but Bombelli still had no symbol for equality. Our
standard equality sign had been published before Bombelli wrote his
book; the symbol had appeared in England in 1557 in The Whetstone of
Witte of Robert Recorde (1510 1558).</p>
<h4 id="robert-recorde-1">Robert Recorde</h4>
<p>Mathematics had not prospered in England during the period of almost
two centuries since the death of Bradwardine, and what little work was
done there in the early sixteenth century depended much on Italian
writers such as Pacioli. Recorde was, in fact, just about the only
mathematician of any stature in England during the entire century. He
was born in Wales and studied and taught mathematics at both Oxford and
Cambridge. In 1545, he received his medical degree at Cambridge, and
thereafter he became the physician of Edward VI and Queen Mary. Recorde
virtually established the English mathematical school. Like Chuquet and
Pacioli before him and Galileo after him, he wrote in the vernacular;
this may have limited his effect on the Continent. Recorde’s first
extant mathematical work is the Grounde of Artes (1541), a popular
arithmetic containing computation by abacus and algorism, with
commercial applications. The level and style of this book, dedicated to
Edward VI and appearing in more than two dozen editions, may be judged
from the following problem:</p>
<p>Then what say you to this equation? If I sold unto you an horse
having 4 shoes, and in every shoe 6 nayles, with this condition, that
you shall pay for the first nayle one ob: for the second nayle two ob:
for the third nayle foure ob: and so fourth, doubling untill the end of
all the nayles, now I ask you, how much would the price of the horse
come unto?</p>
<p>His Castle of Knowledge, an astronomy in which the Copernican system
is cited with approval, and his Pathewaie to Knowledge, an abridgement
of the Elements and the first geometry to appear in English, both
appeared in 1551. The work of Recorde that is most often cited is The
Whetstone of Witte, published only a year before he died in prison. The
title Whetstone evidently was a play on the word “coss,” for “cos” is
the Latin for “whetstone,” and the book is devoted to “the cossike
practise” (that is, algebra). It did for England what Stifel had done
for Germany—with one addition. The well-known equality sign first
appeared in it, explained by Recorde in the quotation at the beginning
of this chapter. Yet it was to be a century or more before the sign
triumphed over rival notations. Recorde died in the year in which Queen
Mary also died, and no comparable English mathematical author appeared
during the long reign of Elizabeth I. It was France, rather than
England,</p>
<p>Tr igonome tr y</p>
<p>Germany, or Italy, that produced the outstanding mathematician of the
Elizabethan Age. But before we turn to his work, there are certain
aspects of the earlier sixteenth century that should be clarified.</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry-3">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The direction of greatest progress in mathematics during the
sixteenth century was obviously in algebra, but developments in
trigonometry were not far behind, although they were not nearly so
spectacular. The construction of trigonometric tables is a dull task,
but they are of great usefulness to astronomers and mathematicians;
here, early sixteenthcentury Poland and Germany were very helpful
indeed. Most of us today think of Nicholas Copernicus (1473 1543) as an
astronomer who revolutionized the worldview by successfully putting the
earth in motion about the sun (where Aristarchus had tried and failed),
but an astronomer is almost inevitably a trigonometer as well, and we
owe to Copernicus a mathematical obligation, as well as an astronomical
debt.</p>
<p>Copernicus and Rheticus</p>
<p>During the lifetime of Regiomontanus, Poland had enjoyed a “Golden
Age” of learning, and the University of Cracow, where Copernicus
enrolled in 1491, had great prestige in mathematics and astronomy. After
further studies in law, medicine, and astronomy at Bologna, Padua, and
Ferrara and after some teaching at Rome, Copernicus returned to Poland
in 1510 to become Canon of Frauenburg. Despite multitudinous
administrative obligations, including currency reform and the curbing of
the Teutonic Order, Copernicus completed the celebrated treatise De
Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, which was published in 1543, the year
he died. This contains substantial sections on trigonometry that had
been separately published in the previous year under the title De
Lateribus et Angulis Triangulorum. The trigonometric material is similar
to that in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, published in Nuremberg only a
decade earlier, but Copernicus’s trigonometric ideas seem to date from
before 1533, at which time he probably did not know of the work of
Regiomontanus. It is quite likely, nevertheless, that the final form of
Copernicus’s trigonometry was in part derived from Regiomontanus, for in
1539 he received as a student Georg Joachim Rheticus (or Rhaeticus, 1514
1576), a professor at Wittenberg, who had visited in Nuremberg. Rheticus
worked with Copernicus for some three years, and it was he who, with his
teacher’s approval, published the first short account of Copernican
astronomy in a work titled Narratio Prima (1540) and who made the first
arrangements, completed by Andreas Osiander, for the printing of the
celebrated De Revolutionibus. It is likely, therefore, that the
trigonometry in the classic work of Copernicus is closely related,
through Rheticus, to that of Regiomontanus.</p>
<p>We see the thorough trigonometric capabilities of Copernicus not only
in the theorems included in De Revolutionibus, but also in a proposition
originally included by the author in an earlier manuscript version of
the book but not in the printed work. The deleted proposition is a
generalization of the theorem of Nasir Eddin (which does appear in the
book) on the rectilinear motion resulting from the compounding of two
circular motions. The theorem of Copernicus is as follows: if a smaller
circle rolls without slipping along the inside of a larger circle with a
diameter twice as great, then the locus of a point that is not on the
circumference of the smaller circle, but that is fixed with respect to
this smaller circle, is an ellipse. Cardan, incidentally, knew of the
Nasir Eddin theorem but not of the Copernican locus, a theorem
rediscovered in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Through the trigonometric theorems in De Revolutionibus, Copernicus
spread the influence of Regiomontanus, but his student Rheticus went
further. He combined the ideas of Regiomontanus and Copernicus, together
with views of his own, in the most elaborate trigonometric treatise
composed up to that time: the two-volume Opus Palatinum de Triangulis.
Here,trigonometryreallycameofage.Theauthordiscardedthetraditional
considerationofthefunctionswithrespecttothearcofacircleandfocused
instead on the lines in a right triangle. Moreover, all six
trigonometric functions now came into full use, for Rheticus calculated
elaborate tables of all of them. Decimal fractions still had not come
into common use; hence, for the sine and cosine functions he used a
hypotenuse (radius) of
10,000,000andfortheotherfourfunctionsabase(oradjacentsideorradius) of
10,000,000 parts, for intervals in the angle of 10v. He began tables of

the treatise was completed and edited, with additions, by his pupil
Valentin Otho (ca. 1550 1605) in 1596.</p>
<h2 id="geometry">Geometry</h2>
<p>Pure geometry in the sixteenth century presented fewer conspicuous
advances than algebra or trigonometry did, but it was not entirely
without representatives. Contributions were made in Germany by Johannes
Werner (1468 1522) and Albrecht Du¨rer (1471 1528) and in Italy by
Francesco Maurolico (1494 1575) and Pacioli. Once more, we note the
preeminence of these two countries in contributions to mathematics
during the Renaissance. Werner had aided in preserving the trigonometry
of Regiomontanus, but of more geometric significance was</p>
<p>his Latin work, in twenty-two books, on the Elements of Conics,
printed in Nuremberg in 1522. Although this cannot be favorably compared
with the Conics of Apollonius, which was almost entirely unknown in
Werner’s day, it marks the renewal of interest in the curves for almost
the first time since Pappus. Because the author was primarily concerned
with the duplication of the cube, he concentrated on the parabola and
the hyperbola, deriving the standard plane equations stereometrically
from the cone, as had his predecessors in Greece, but there seems to be
an element of originality in his plane method for plotting points on a
parabola with compasses and straightedge. One first draws a pencil of
circles tangent to each other and intersecting the common normal in
points c, d, e, f, g,…(Fig. 13.1). Then, along the common normal, one
marks off a distance ab equal to a desired parameter. At b one erects
the line bG perpendicular to ab and cutting the circles in points C, D,
E, F, G,…respectively. Then, at c one erects line segments cCuand cCv
perpendicular to ab and equal to bC; at d one erects perpendicular
segments dDu and dDv equal to bD; at e one erects segments eEu and eEv
equal to bE; and so on. Then, Cu, Cv, Du, Dv, Eu, Ev,…will all lie on
the parabola with vertex b, axis along ab, and having ab as the
magnitude of the parameter—as is readily seen from the relationships</p>
<p>ðcCuÞ2 5ab be; ðdDuÞ2 5ab bd; and so on:</p>
<p>The Theory of Perspective</p>
<p>Werner’s work is closely related to ancient studies of conics, but
meanwhile, in Italy and Germany, a relatively novel relationship between
mathematics and art was developing. One important respect in which
Renaissance art differed from art in the Middle Ages was in the</p>
<p>use of perspective in the plane representation of objects in
threedimensional space. The Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi
(1377 1446) is said to have given much attention to this problem, but
the first formal account of some of the problems was given by Leon
Battista Alberti (1404 1472) in a treatise of 1435 (printed in 1511)
titled Della pittura. Alberti opens with a general discussion of the
principles of foreshortening and then describes a method he invented for
representing in a vertical “picture plane” a set of squares in a
horizontal “ground plane.” Let the eye be at a “station point” S that is
h units above the ground plane and k units in front of the picture
plane. The intersection of the ground plane and the picture plane is
called the “groundline,” the foot V of the perpendicular from S to the
picture plane is called the “center of vision” (or the principal
vanishing point), the line through V parallel to the groundline is known
as the “vanishing line” (or horizon line), and the points P and Q on
this line, which are k units from V, are called the “distance points.”
If we take points A, B, C, D, E, F, G marking off equal distances along
the groundline RT (Fig. 13.2), where D is the intersection of this line
with the vertical plane through S and V, and if we draw lines connecting
these points with V, then the projection of these last lines, with S as
a center, on the ground plane will be a set of parallel and equidistant
lines. If P (or Q) is connected with the points B, C, D, E, F, G to form
another set of lines intersecting AV in points H, I, J, K, L, M, and if
through the latter points parallels are drawn to the groundline RT, then
the set of trapezoids in the picture plane will correspond to a set of
squares in the ground plane.</p>
<p>A further step in the development of perspective was taken by the</p>
<p>Italian painter of frescoes Piero della Francesca (ca. 1415 1492),
in</p>
<p>De prospectiva pingendi (ca. 1478). Where Alberti had concentrated
on</p>
<p>FIG. 13.2</p>
<p>representing on the picture plane figures in the ground plane, Piero
handled the more complicated problem of depicting on the picture plane
objects in three dimensions as seen from a given station point. He also
wrote De Corporibus Regularibus, where he noted the “divine proportion”
in which diagonals of a regular pentagon cut each other and where he
found the volume common to two equal circular cylinders whose axes cut
each other at right angles (unaware of Archimedes’ Method, which was
unknown at the time). The connection between art and mathematics was
also strong in the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He wrote a work, now lost,
on perspective; his Trattato della pittura opens with the admonition,
“Let no one who is not a mathematician read my works.” The same
combination of mathematical and artistic interests is seen in Albrecht
Du¨rer, a contemporary of Leonardo and a fellow townsman of Werner at
Nuremberg. In Du¨rer’s work, we also see the influence of Pacioli,
especially in the celebrated engraving of 1514 titled Melancholia. Here
the magic square figures prominently.</p>
<p>This is often regarded as the first use of a magic square in the
West, but Pacioli had left an unpublished manuscript, De viribus
quantitatis, in which interest in such squares is indicated.</p>
<p>Du¨rer’s interests in mathematics, however, were far more geometric
than arithmetic, as the title of his most important book indicates:
Investigation of the Measurement with Circles and Straight Lines of
Plane and Solid Figures. This work, which appeared in several German and
Latin editions from 1525 to 1538, contains some striking novelties, of
which the most important were his new curves. This is one direction in
which the Renaissance could easily have improved on the work of the
ancients, who had studied only a handful of types of curves. Du¨rer took
a fixed point on a circle and then allowed the circle to roll along the
circumference of another circle, generating an epicycloid, but, not
having the necessary algebraic tools, he did not study this
analytically. The same was true of other plane curves that he obtained
by projecting helical space curves onto a plane to form spirals. In
Du¨rer’s work, we find the Ptolemaic construction of the regular
pentagon, which is exact, as well as another original construction that
is only an approximation.</p>
<p>Albrecht Du¨rer’s Melancholia (the British Museum). Note the four
celled magic square in the upper right hand corner.</p>
<p>For the heptagon and the enneagon, he also gave ingenious but, of
course, inexact constructions. Du¨rer’s construction of an approximately
regular nonagon is as follows: Let O be the center of a circle ABC in
which A, B, and C are vertices of the inscribed equilateral triangle
(Fig. 13.3). Through A, O, and C draw a circular arc; draw similar arcs
through B, O, and C and through B, O, and A. Let AO be trisected at</p>
<p>points D and E, and through E draw a circle with center at O and
cutting arcs AFO and AGO in points F and G, respectively. Then, the
straight line segment FG will be very nearly equal to the side of the
regular nonagon inscribed in this smaller circle, the angle FOG
differing from 40 by less than 1. The relation of art and geometry might
have been very productive indeed, had it gained the attention of
professionally minded mathematicians, but in this respect, it failed for
more than a century after Du¨rer’s time.</p>
<p>Cartography</p>
<p>Projections of various sorts are essential to cartographers.
Geographical explorations had widened horizons and created a need for
better maps, but Scholasticism and Humanism were of little help here
because new discoveries had outmoded medieval and ancient maps. One of
the most important of the innovators was the German mathematician and
astronomer Peter Apian (or Bienewitz). In 1520, he published perhaps the
earliest map of the Old World and the New World in which the name
“America” was used; in 1527, he issued the business arithmetic in which,
on the title page, the arithmetic, or Pascal, triangle appeared in print
for the first time. The maps of Apian were well done, but they followed
Ptolemy closely wherever possible. For the novelty that is thought to be
so characteristic of the Renaissance, it is better to look instead to a
Flemish geographer, Gerard Mercator (or Gerhard Kremer, 1512 1594), who
was for a time associated with the court of Charles V in Brussels.
Mercator may be said to have broken with Ptolemy in geography as
Copernicus had revolted against Ptolemaic astronomy.</p>
<p>For the first half of his life, Mercator depended heavily on Ptolemy,
but by 1554, he had emancipated himself sufficiently to cut down the
Ptolemaic estimate of the width of the Mediterranean from 62 to 53.
(Actually, it is close to 40.) More important, in 1569 he published the
first map, Nova et aucta orbis terrae descriptio, drawn up on a new
principle. Maps</p>
<p>The Pascal triangle as first printed. Title page of the arithmetic of
Petrus Apianus, Ingolstadt, 1527, more than a century before Pascal
investigated the properties of the triangle.</p>
<p>in common use in Mercator’s day were usually based on a rectangular
grid made up of two sets of equidistant parallel lines, one set for
latitudes, the other for longitudes. The length of a degree of
longitude, however, varies with the parallel of latitude along which it
is measured, an inequality disregarded in common practice and resulting
in a distortion of shape and in errors of direction on the part of
navigators, who based a course on the straight line drawn between two
points on the map. The Ptolemaic stereographic projection preserved
shapes, but it did not use the common grid</p>
<p>Renai s s anc e Tr end s</p>
<p>of lines. To bring theory and practice into some accord, Mercator
introduced the projection that bears his name and that, with later
improvement, has been basic in cartography ever since. The first step in
the Mercator projection is to think of a spherical earth inscribed
within an indefinitely long right circular cylinder touching the earth
along the equator (or some other great circle), and to project, from the
center of the earth, points on the surface of the earth onto the
cylinder. If the cylinder is then cut along an element and flattened
out, the meridians and the parallels on the earth will have been
transformed into a rectangular network of lines. Distances between
successive meridian lines will be equal, but not distances between
successive lines of latitude. In fact, the latter distances increase so
rapidly, as one moves away from the equator, that distortions of shape
and direction occur, but Mercator found that through an empirically
determined modification of these distances, preservation of direction
and shape (although not of size) was possible. In 1599, Edward Wright
(1558 1615)—a fellow at Cambridge, a tutor to Henry, Prince of Wales,
and a good sailor— developed the theoretical basis of the Mercator
projection by computing the functional relationship D5alntan(φ/2145)
between map distance D from the equator and latitudeφ.</p>
<h4 id="renaissance-trends">Renaissance Trends</h4>
<p>Several characteristics of the period under review stand out: the
diversity of occupations engaging the men we have considered, the
variety of languages in which mathematical works became available, and
the growth of mathematical applications. Whereas most medieval
contributors to mathematics received institutional support from the
Church, Renaissance mathematicians such as Regiomontanus gradually
shifted their support base to the growing commercial interests of the
time. An increasing number found employment from heads of states or
municipal institutions that needed calculators or teachers, mapmakers or
engineers. A considerable number were physicians or professors of
medicine. Most mathematical works at the beginning of the period were
available in Latin, or, as we have noted, if they had originally been
produced in Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew, were translated into Latin. By the
late sixteenth century, original works were available in English,
German, French, Italian, and Dutch.</p>
<p>Mathematics during the Renaissance had been widely applied to
bookkeeping, mechanics, surveying, art, cartography, and optics, and
numerous books were devoted to the practical arts. No one encouraged the
burgeoning emphasis on applications more strongly than Pierre de la
Rame´e, or Ramus (1515 1572), a man who contributed to mathematics in a
pedagogical sense. At the College de Navarre, he had in 1536` defended,
for his master’s degree, the audacious thesis that everything Aristotle
had said was wrong—at a time when Peripateticism was the same as
orthodoxy. Ramus was at odds with his age in many ways; banned from
teaching philosophy in France, he proposed revisions in the university
curricula so that logic and mathematics should receive more attention.
Not satisfied even with the Elements of Euclid, Ramus edited this with
revisions. Yet his competence in geometry was limited. Ramus had more
confidence in practical elementary mathematics than in speculative
higher algebra and geometry. His logic enjoyed considerable popularity
in Protestant countries, in part because he died a martyr in the
St. Bartholomew massacre. This brings to our attention the fact that in
this first century of the Reformation, most works written in the vulgate
and intended for the mathematical practitioner were created in the
Protestant areas of Europe, whereas most of the traditional classical
treatises were studied and commented on in the Catholic parts.</p>
<p>Interest in the classical works of antiquity remained strong, as we
see in the case of Maurolico, a priest of Greek parentage who was born,
lived, and died in Sicily. Maurolico was a scholar who did much to
revive interest in the more advanced of the antique works. Geometry in
the first half of the sixteenth century had been heavily dependent on
the elementary properties found in Euclid. With the exception of Werner,
few were really familiar with the geometry of Archimedes, Apollonius, or
Pappus. The reason for this was simple: Latin translations of these did
not become generally available until the middle of the century. In this
process of translation, Maurolico was joined by an Italian scholar,
Federigo Commandino. We have mentioned Tartaglia’s borrowed translation
of Archimedes that was printed in 1543; this was followed by a Greek
edition of 1544 and a Latin translation by Commandino at Venice in
1558.</p>
<p>Four books of the Conics of Apollonius had survived in Greek, and
these had been translated into Latin and printed in Venice in 1537.
Maurolico’s translation, completed in 1548, was not published for more
than a century, appearing in 1654, but another translation by Commandino
was printed in Bologna in 1566. The Mathematical Collection of Pappus
had been virtually unknown to the Arabs and the medieval Europeans, but
this, too, was translated by the indefatigable Commandino, although it
was not printed until 1588. Maurolico was acquainted with the vast
treasures of ancient geometry that were becoming available, for he read
Greek, as well as Latin. In fact, from some indications in Pappus of
Apollonius’s work on maxima and minima—that is, on normals to the conic
sections—Maurolico tried his hand at a reconstruction of the then lost
Book V of the Conics. In this respect, he represented a vogue that was
to be one of the chief stimuli to geometry before Descartes: the
reconstruction of lost works in general and of the last four books of
the Conics in particular. During the interval from Maurolico’s death in
1575 to the publication of La ge´ome´trie by Descartes in 1637, geometry
was marking time until developments in algebra had reached a level that
made algebraic geometry possible. The Renaissance could well have
developed pure geometry in the direction suggested by art and
perspective, but the possibility went unheeded until almost precisely
the same time that algebraic geometry was created.</p>
<p>By 1575, Western Europe had recovered most of the major mathematical
works of antiquity that are now extant. Arabic algebra had been mastered
and improved on, both through the solution of the cubic and the quartic
and through a partial use of symbolism, and trigonometry had become an
independent discipline. A central figure in the transition to the
seventeenth century was the Frenchman Franc¸ois Viete.`</p>
<p>Francois Vi¸ ete`</p>
<p>Viete
(1540<code>1603) was not a mathematician by vocation. As a young man, he studied and practiced law, becoming a member of the Bretagne parliament; later he became a member of the king’s council, serving first under Henry III and later under Henry IV. It was during his service with the latter, Henry of Navarre, that Viete became so successful in deci-</code>
phering cryptic enemy messages that the Spanish accused him of being in
league with the devil. Only Viete’s leisure time was devoted
to<code>mathematics, yet he made contributions to arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. There was a period of almost half a dozen years, before the accession of Henry IV, during which Viete was out of</code>
favor, and these years he spent largely on mathematical studies. In
arithmetic, he should be remembered for his plea for the use of decimal,
rather than sexagesimal, fractions. In one of his earliest works, the
Canon Mathematicus of 1579, he wrote:</p>
<p>Sexagesimals and sixties are to be used sparingly or never in
mathematics, and thousandths and thousands, hundredths and hundreds,
tenths and tens, and similar progressions, ascending and descending, are
to be used frequently or exclusively.</p>
<p>In the tables and the computations, he adhered to his word and used
decimal fractions. The sides of the squares inscribed in and
circumscribed about a circle of diameter 200,000 he wrote as
141,421,356;24 and 200,000,000;00, and their mean as 177,245385;09. A
few pages further on, he wrote the semi-circumference as 314,159,, and
still later this figure appeared as 314,159,265,36, with the integral
portion in boldface type. Occasionally, he used a vertical stroke to
separate the integral and fractional portions, as when writing the
apothem of the 96-sided regular polygon, in a circle of diameter
200,000, as about 99,9469458,75.</p>
<p>The Analytic Art</p>
<p>Without doubt, it was in algebra that Viete made his most
estimable<code>contributions, for it was here that he came closest to modern views. Mathematics is a form of reasoning and not a bag of tricks. There could be little advance in algebraic theory so long as the chief preoccupation was with finding “the thing” in an equation with specific numerical coefficients. Symbols and abbreviations for an unknown and for powers of the unknown, as well as for operations and for the relationship of equality, had been developed. Stifel had gone so far as to write AAAA for the fourth power of an unknown quantity, yet he had no scheme for writing an equation that might represent any one of a whole class of equations—of all quadratics, say, or of all cubics. A geometer, by means of a diagram, could let ABC represent all triangles, but an algebraist had no counterpart for writing down all equations of the second degree. Letters had indeed been used to represent magnitudes, known or unknown, since the days of Euclid, and Jordanus had done this freely, but there had been no way of distinguishing magnitudes assumed to be known from those unknown quantities that are to be found. Here, Viete</code>
introduced a convention as simple as it was fruitful. He used a vowel to
represent the quantity in algebra that was assumed to be unknown or
undetermined and a consonant to represent a magnitude or a number
assumed to be known or given. Here we find for the first time in algebra
a clear-cut distinction between the important concept of a parameter and
the idea of an unknown quantity. Had Viete adopted other
symbo-<code>lisms extant in his day, he might have written all quadratic equations in the single form BA2 1CA1D50, where A is the unknown and B, C, and D are parameters, but unfortunately, he was modern only in some ways and ancient and medieval in others. Although he wisely adopted the Germanic symbols for addition and subtraction and, still more wisely, used differing symbols for parameters and unknowns, the remainder of his algebra consisted of words and abbreviations. The third power of the unknown quantity was not A3 or even AAA, but A cubus, and the second power was A quadratus. Multiplication was signified by the Latin word “in,” division was indicated by the fraction line, and for equality Viete used an abbreviation for the Latin</code>
aequalis. It is not given for one man to make the whole of a given
change; it must come in steps.</p>
<p>One of the steps beyond the work of Viete was taken by Harriot
when<code>he revived the idea Stifel had had of writing the cube of the unknown as AAA. This notation was used systematically by Harriot in his posthumous book titled Artis Analyticae Praxis and printed in 1631. Its title had been suggested by the earlier work of Viete, who had disliked the</code>
Arabic name “algebra.” In looking for a substitute, Viete noted that in`
problems involving the “cosa,” or unknown quantity, one generally
proceeds in a manner that Pappus and the ancients had described as
analysis. That is, instead of reasoning from what is known to what was
to be demonstrated, algebraists invariably reasoned from the assumption
that the unknown was given and deduced a necessary conclusion from which
the unknown can be determined. In modern symbols, if we wish to solve x2
23x1250, for example, we proceed on the premise that there is a value of
x satisfying this equation; from this assumption, we draw the necessary
conclusion that (x22)(x21)50, so that either x2250 or x2150 (or both) is
satisfied, hence that x necessarily is 2 or 1. Yet, this does not mean
that one or both of these numbers will satisfy the equation unless we
can reverse the steps in the reasoning process. That is, the analysis
must be followed by the synthetic demonstration.</p>
<p>In view of the type of reasoning so frequently used in algebra,
Viete<code>called the subject “the analytic art.” Moreover, he had a clear awareness of the broad scope of the subject, realizing that the unknown quantity need not be either a number or a geometric line. Algebra reasons about “types” or species, hence Viete contrasted</code>
logistica speciosa with logistica numerosa. His algebra was presented in
the Isagoge (or Introduction), printed in 1591, but his several other
algebraic works did not appear until many years after his death. In all
of these, he maintained a principle of homogeneity in equations, so that
in an equation such as x3 13ax5b, the a is designated as planum and the
b as solidum. This suggests a certain inflexibility, which Descartes
removed a generation later, but homogeneity also has certain advantages,
as Viete undoubt-` edly saw.</p>
<p>The algebra of Viete is noteworthy for the generality of its
expression,<code>but there are also other novel aspects. For one thing, Viete suggested a</code>
new approach to the solution of the cubic. Having reduced it to the
standard form equivalent to x3 13ax5b, he introduced a new unknown
quantity, y, that was related to x through the equation in y3, for which
the solution is readily obtained. Moreover, Viete was aware of some
of<code>the relations between roots and coefficients of an equation, although here he was hampered by his failure to allow the coefficients and roots to be negative. He realized, for example, that if x3 1b 5 3ax has two positive roots, x1 and x2, then, 3a5x12 1x1x2 1x22 and b5x1x22 1x2x12. This is, of course, a special case of our theorem that the coefficient of the term in x, in a cubic with leading coefficient unity, is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, and the constant term is the negative of the product of the roots. Viete, in other words, was close to the subject of</code>
symmetric functions of the roots in the theory of equations. It remained
for Albert Girard (1595 1632) in 1629, in Invention nouvelle en
l’alge<code>bre, to state clearly the relations between roots and coefficients, for he allowed for negative and imaginary roots, whereas Viete had recog-</code>
nized only the positive roots. In a general way, Girard realized that
negative roots are directed in a sense opposite to that for positive
numbers, thus anticipating the idea of the number line. “The negative in
geometry indicates a retrogression,” he said, “where the positive is an
advance.” To him also seems to be largely due the realization that an
equation can have as many roots as is indicated by the degree of the
equation. Girard retained imaginary roots of equations because they show
the general principles in the formation of an equation from its
roots.</p>
<p>Discoveries much like those of Girard had been made even earlier by
Thomas Harriot, but these did not appear in print until ten years after
Harriot had died of cancer in 1621. Harriot had been hampered in
publication by conflicting political currents during the closing years
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He had been sent by Sir Walter
Raleigh as a surveyor on the latter’s expeditions to the New World in
1585, thus becoming the first substantial mathematician to set foot in
North America. (Brother Juan Diaz, a young chaplain with some
mathematical training, had earlier joined Cortes on an expedition to
Yucatan in 1518.) On his return, Harriot published A Briefe and True
Report of the Newfound Land of Virginia (1586). When his patron lost
favor with the queen and was executed, Harriot was granted a pension of
d300 a year by Henry, Earl of Northumberland, but in 1606, the earl was
committed to the Tower by James I, Elizabeth’s successor. Harriot
continued to meet with Henry in the Tower, and distractions and poor
health contributed to his failure to publish results.</p>
<p>Harriot knew of relationships between roots and coefficients and
between roots and factors, but like Viete, he was hampered by failure
to<code>take note of negative and imaginary roots. In notations, however, he advanced the use of symbolism, being responsible for the signs.and,for “greater than” and “less than.” It was also partly his use of Recorde’s equality sign that led to its ultimate adoption. Harriot showed much more moderation in the use of new notations than did his younger contemporary William Oughtred. The latter published his Clavis mathematicae in the same year, 1631, in which Harriot’s Praxis was printed. In the Clavis, the notation for powers was a step back toward Viete, for where Harriot had</code>
written AAAAAAA, for example, Oughtred used Aqqc (that is, A squared
squared cubed). Of all of Oughtred’s new notations, only one is now
widely used—the cross 3 for multiplication.</p>
<p>The homogeneous form of his equations shows that Viete’s
thought<code>was always close to geometry, but his geometry was not on the elementary level of so many of his predecessors’; it was on the higher level of Apollonius’s and Pappus’s. Interpreting the fundamental algebraic operations geometrically, Viete realized that straightedge and compasses suffice</code>
up through square roots. If, however, one permits the interpolation of
two geometric means between two magnitudes, one can construct cube
roots, or, a fortiori, geometrically solve any cubic equation. In this
case, one can, Viete showed, construct the regular heptagon, for this
construction leads
to<code>a cubic of the form x3 5ax1a. In fact, every cubic or quartic equation is solvable by angle trisections and the insertion of two geometric means between two magnitudes. Here we clearly see a very significant trend—the association of the new higher algebra with the ancient higher geometry. Analytic geometry could not, then, be far away, and Viete might have</code>
discovered this branch had he not avoided the geometric study of
indeterminate equations. The mathematical interests of Viete were
unusually<code>broad; hence, he had read Diophantus’s Arithmetica. Yet when a geometric problem led Viete to a final equation in two unknown quantities, he dis-</code>
missed it with the casual observation that the problem was
indeterminate. One wishes that with his general point of view, he had
inquired into the geometric properties of the indeterminacy.</p>
<p>The Approximate Solution of Equations</p>
<p>In many respects, the work of Viete is greatly undervalued, but in
one` case, it is possible that he has been given undue credit for a
method known much earlier in China. In one of his later works, the De
Numerosa Potestatum…Resolutione (1600), he gave a method for the
approximate solution of equations, which is virtually that known today
as Horner’s method.</p>
<h4 id="trigonometry-4">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The trigonometry of Viete, like his algebra, was characterized by
a<code>heightened emphasis on generality and a breadth of view. As Viete was</code>
the effective founder of a literal algebra, so he may with some
justification be called the father of a generalized analytic approach to
trigonometry that is sometimes known as goniometry. Here, too, of
course, Viete started from the work of his predecessors—notably,
Regio-<code>montanus and Rheticus. Like the former, he thought of trigonometry as an independent branch of mathematics; like the latter, he generally worked without direct reference to half chords in a circle. Viete, in the</code>
Canon Mathematicus (1579), prepared extensive tables of all six
functions for angles to the nearest minute. We have seen that he had
urged the use of decimal, rather than sexagesimal, fractions, but to
avoid all fractions as much as possible, Viete chose a “sinus totus” or
hypotenuse` of 100,000 parts for the sine and cosine table and a “basis”
or “perpendiculum” of 100,000 parts for the tangent, cotangent, secant,
and cosecant tables. (Except for the sine function, he did not, however,
use these names.)</p>
<p>In solving oblique triangles, Viete in the` Canon Mathematicus broke
them down into right triangles, but in another work a few years later,
Variorum de Rebus Mathematicis (1593), there is a statement equivalent
to our law of tangents:</p>
<p>ða1bÞ A1B</p>
<p>tan</p>
<p>2 5 2</p>
<p>ða2bÞ A2B</p>
<p>tan</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>Though Viete may have been the first to use this formula, it was`
first published by the German physician and professor of mathematics
Thomas Finck (1561 1656) in 1583, in Geometriae Rotundi Libri XIV.</p>
<p>Trigonometric identities of various sorts were appearing about this
time in all parts of Europe, resulting in reduced emphasis on
computation in the solution of triangles and more on analytic functional
relationships. Among these were a group of formulas known as the
prosthaphaeretic rules—that is, formulas that would convert a product of
functions into a sum or difference (hence the name “prosthaphaeresis,” a
Greek word meaning “addition and subtraction”). From the following type
of diagram, for example, Viete derived the formula`</p>
<p>x1y x2y</p>
<p>sin x1sin y52sin cos :</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>Let sinx5AB (Fig. 13.4) and siny5CD. Then</p>
<p>x2y x1y x2y</p>
<p>sinx1siny5AB1CD5AE 5AC cos 52sin cos :</p>
<p>2 2 2</p>
<p>On making the substitutions (x1y)/25A and (x2y)/25B, we have the more
useful form sin(A1B)1sin(A2B)52 sin A cos B. In a similar manner, one
derives sin (A1B)2sin (A2B)52 cos A sin B by placing the angles x and y
on the same side of the radius OD. The formulas
2cosAcosB5cos(A1B)1cos(A2B)and2sinAsinB5cos(A2B)2 cos(A1B) are somewhat
similarly derived.</p>
<p>y</p>
<p>The previous rules sometimes bear the name “formulas of Werner,” for
they seem to have been used by Werner to simplify astronomical
calculations. At least one of these, that converting a product of
cosines to a sum of cosines, had been known to the Arabs in the time of
ibn-Yunus, but it was only in the sixteenth century, and more
particularly near the end of the century, that the method of
prosthaphaeresis came to be widely used. If, for example, one wished to
multiply 98,436 by 79,253, one could let cos A549,218 (that is,
98,436/2) and cos B579,253. (In modern notation, we would place a
decimal point, temporarily, before each of the numbers and adjust the
decimal point in the answer.) Then, from the table of trigonometric
functions one reads off angles A and B, and from the table one looks up
cos (A1B) and cos (A2B), the sum of these being the product desired.
Note that the product is found without any multiplication having been
performed. In our example of prosthaphaeretic multiplication, there is
not a great saving of time and energy, but when we recall that at that
time, trigonometric tables of a dozen or fifteen significant figures
were not uncommon, the laborsaving possibilities of prosthaphaeresis
become more pronounced. The device was adopted at major astronomical
observatories, including that of Tycho Brahe (1546 1601) in Denmark,
from where word of it was carried to Napier in Scotland. Quotients are
handled in the same manner by using a table of secants and
cosecants.</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is Viete’s generalization of trigonometry into
gonio-<code>metrymorepronouncedthaninconnectionwithhismultiple-angleformulas. The double-angle formulas for the sine and the cosine had, of course, been knowntoPtolemy,andthetriple-angleformulasaretheneasilyderivedfrom Ptolemy’s formulas for the sine and the cosine of the sum of two angles. By continuing to use the Ptolemy formulas recursively, a formula for sin nx or cos nx can be derived, but only with great effort. Viete used an ingenious</code>
manipulation of right triangles and the well-known identity</p>
<p>(a2 1b2)(c2 1d2)5(ad1bc)2 1(bd2ac)2</p>
<p>5(ad2bc)2 1(bd1ac)2</p>
<p>to arrive at formulas for multiple angles equivalent to what we
should</p>
<p>now write as</p>
<p>n nðn21Þ n 2 2</p>

<p>1U2U3</p>
<p>where the signs alternate and the coefficients are in magnitude the
alternate numbers in the appropriate line of the arithmetic triangle.
Here we see a striking link between trigonometry and the theory of
numbers.</p>
<p>Trigonometric Solution of Equations</p>
<p>Viete also noted an important link between his formulas and the
solution<code>of the cubic equation. Trigonometry could serve as a handmaid to algebra where the latter had run up against a stone wall—in the irreducible case of the cubic. This evidently occurred to Viete when he noticed that the angle</code>
trisection problem led to a cubic equation. If in the equation x3 13px1
q50 one substitutes mx5y (to obtain a degree of freedom in the later
selection of a value for m), the result is y3 13m2py1m3q50. Comparing
this with the formula cos3 θ2 cos θ2 cos 3θ50, one notes that if y5cos
θ, and if 3m2p52, then2 cos 3θ5m3q. Because p is given, m is now known
(and will be real whenever the three roots are real). Hence, 3θ is
readily determined, because q is known; hence, cos θ is known.
Therefore, y, and from it x, will be known. Moreover, by considering all
possible angles satisfying the conditions, all three real roots will be
found. This trigonometric solution of the irreducible case of the cubic,
suggested by Viete, was later carried out in detail by Girard in 1629
in<code>Invention nouvelle en l’alge</code>bre.</p>
<p>In 1593, Viete found an unusual opportunity to use his
multiple-angle` formulas. The Belgian mathematician and professor of
medicine Adriaen van Roomen (1561 1615) had issued a public challenge to
anyone to solve an equation of the forty-fifth degree:</p>
<p>x45 45x43 1945x41 3795x3 145x5K.</p>
<p>The ambassador from the Low Countries to the court of Henry IV
boasted that France had no mathematician capable of solving the problem
proposed by his countryman. Viete, called on to defend the
honor<code>of France, noted that the proposed equation was one that arises in expressing K5sin45θ in terms of x52sinθ, and he promptly found the positive roots. The achievement so impressed van Roomen that he paid Viete a special visit; this resulted in their frequently communicating and</code>
challenging each other with problems. When Viete sent van Roomen the`
Apollonian problem of constructing a circle tangent to three given
circles, the latter solved it with the use of hyperbolas.</p>
<p>In applying trigonometrytoarithmetic andalgebraicproblems, Vietewas`
broadening the scope of the subject. Moreover, his multiple-angle
formulas should have disclosed the periodicity of the goniometric
functions, but it was probably his hesitancy with respect to negative
numbers that prevented him—or his contemporaries—from going as far as
this. There was considerable enthusiasm for trigonometry in the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, but this primarily took the
form of synthesis and textbooks. It was during this period that the name
“trigonometry” came to be attached to the subject. It was used as the
title of an exposition by Bartholomaeus Pitiscus (1561 1613), the
successor to Valentin Otho at Heidelberg; this was first published in
1595 as a supplement to a book on spherics and again independently in
1600, 1606, and 1612. Coincidentally, the development of logarithms,
ever since a close ally of trigonometry, was also taking place during
these years.</p>

<p>Francis Bacon</p>
<h4 id="accessibility-of-computation">Accessibility of Computation</h4>
<p>During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, a growing
number of merchants, estate holders, scientists, and mathematical
practitioners were impressed by the need for means to simplify
arithmetic
computationsandgeometricmeasurementsandtoenableapopulationthat was
largely illiterate and numerically challenged to participate in the
commercial transactions of the day.</p>
<p>Among those seeking more effective aids for solving mathematical
problems were numerous well-known individuals. A few of the more
influential of these, scattered over Western Europe, we shall now
consider. Galileo Galilei (1564 1642) came from Italy; several more,
such as Henry Briggs (1561 1639), Edmund Gunter (1581 1626), and William
Oughtred (1574 1660), were English; Simon Stevin (1548 1620) was</p>
<p>Flemish; John Napier (1550 1617), Scottish; Jobst Bu¨rgi (1552
1632),</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>D e c imal F rac t ions</p>
<p>Swiss; and Johann Kepler (1571 1630), German. Bu¨rgi was a clock and
instrument maker, Galileo was a physical scientist, and Stevin was an
engineer. We have seen that the work of Vie`te grew out of two factors
in particular: (1) the recovery of ancient Greek classics and (2) the
relatively new developments in medieval and early modern algebra.
Throughout the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, both
professional and amateur theoretical mathematicians showed concern for
the practical techniques of computation, which contrasted strongly with
the dichotomy emphasized two millennia earlier by Plato.</p>
<h4 id="decimal-fractions">Decimal Fractions</h4>
<p>In 1579, Vie`te had urged the replacement of sexagesimal fractions
with decimal fractions. In 1585, an even stronger plea for the use of
the tenscale for fractions, as well as for integers, was made by the
leading mathematician in the Low Countries, Simon Stevin of Bruges.
Under Prince Maurice of Nassau he served as quartermaster and as
commissioner of public works, and for a time he tutored the prince in
mathematics.</p>
<p>In the history of science, as well as in mathematics, Stevin is an
important figure. He and a friend dropped two spheres of lead, one ten
times the weight of the other, from a height of thirty feet onto a board
and found the sounds of their striking the board to be almost
simultaneous. But Stevin’s published report (in Flemish in 1586) of the
experiment has received far less notice than the similar and later
experiment attributed, on very doubtful evidence, to Galileo. On the
other hand, Stevin usually receives credit for the discovery of the law
of the inclined plane, justified by his familiar “wreath of spheres”
diagram, whereas this law had been given earlier by Jordanus
Nemorarius.</p>
<p>Although Stevin was a great admirer of the theoretical treatises of
Archimedes, there runs through the works of the Flemish engineer a
strain of practicality that is more characteristic of the Renaissance
period. Thus, Stevin was largely responsible for the introduction into
the Low Countries of double-entry bookkeeping fashioned after that of
Pacioli in Italy almost a century earlier. Of far more widespread
influence in economic practice, in engineering, and in mathematical
notations was Stevin’s little book with the Flemish title De thiende
(The Tenth), published in Leyden in 1585. A French version titled La
disme appeared in the same year and increased the popularity of the

<p>It is clear that Stevin was in no sense the inventor of decimal
fractions, nor was he the first systematic user of them. As we have
noted, more than incidental use of decimal fractions is found in ancient
China, in medieval Arabia, and in Renaissance Europe; by the time of
Vie<code>te’s forthright advocacy of decimal fractions in 1579, they were generally accepted by mathematicians on the frontiers of research. Among the common people, however, and even among mathematical practitioners, decimal fractions became widely known only when Stevin undertook to explain the system in full and elementary detail. He wished to teach everyone “how to perform with an ease, unheard of, all computations necessary between men by integers without fractions.” He did not write his decimal expressions with denominators, as Vie</code>te
had; instead, in a circle above or after each</p>

<p>Instead of the words “tenth,” “hundredth,” and so on, he used

in sexagesimal fractions.</p>
<h4 id="notation">Notation</h4>
<p>Stevin was a practical-minded mathematician who saw little point in
the more speculative aspects of the subject. Of imaginary numbers, he
wrote, “There are enough legitimate things to work on without need to
get busy on uncertain matter.” Nevertheless, he was not narrow-minded,
and his reading of Diophantus impressed him with the importance of
appropriate notations as an aid to thought. Although he followed the
custom of Vie`te and other contemporaries in writing out some words,
such as that for equality, he preferred a purely symbolic notation for
powers. Carrying over to algebra his positional notation for decimal
fractions, he wrote instead of Q (or square), for C (or cube), for QQ
(or square-square), and so on. This notation may well have been
suggested by Bombelli’s Algebra. It also paralleled a notation of
Bu¨rgi, who indicated powers of an unknown by placing Roman numerals
over the coefficients. Thus, x4 13x2 27x, for example, would be written
by Bu¨rgi as</p>
<p>iv ii i</p>
<p>1 1 3 2 7</p>
<p>and by Stevin as</p>
<p>StevinwentfurtherthanBombelliorBu¨rgiinproposingthatsuchnotations be
extended to fractional powers. (It is interesting to note that although
Oresme had used both fractional-power indices and coordinate methods in
geometry, these seem to have had only a very indirect influence, if any,
on the progress of mathematics in the Low Countries and France in the
early seventeenth century.) Even though Stevin had no occasion to use
the fractional index notation, he clearly stated that in a circle would
mean square root and that in a circle would indicate the square root of
the cube.</p>
<p>A little later, Albert Girard, the editor of Stevin’s works, adopted
the circled-numericalnotation forpowers,and
he,too,indicatedthatthiscouldp p3 be used for roots instead of such
symbols as and . Symbolic algebra was developing apace, and it reached
its maturity, only eight years after Girard’s Invention nouvelle, in
Descartes’ La ge´ome´trie.</p>
<p>The use of a decimal point separatrix is generally attributed either
to G. A. Magini (1555 1617), the cartographer who assumed the chair for
mathematics at his alma mater in Bologna in 1588, in his De planis
triangulis of 1592, or to Christopher Clavius (1537 1612), in a table of
sines of 1593. Clavius, born in Bamberg, joined the Jesuit Order before
age eighteen; received his education, including early studies at the
University of Coimbra in Portugal, within the order; and spent most of
his life teaching at the Collegio Romano in Rome. He was the author of
many widely read textbooks, and it is safe to assume that this helped
promote the use of the decimal point. But the decimal point did not
become popular until Napier used it more than twenty years later. In the
1616 English translation of Napier’s Descriptio, decimal fractions
appear as today, with a decimal point separating the integral and
fractional portions. In 1617, in the Rhabdologia, in which he described
computation using his rods, Napier referred to Stevin’s decimal
arithmetic and proposed a point or a comma as the decimal separatrix. In
the Napierian Constructio of 1619, the decimal point became standard in
England, but many European countries continue to this day to use the
decimal comma.</p>
<h4 id="logarithms">Logarithms</h4>
<p>John Napier (or Neper), who published his description of logarithms
in 1614, was a Scottish laird, the Baron of Merchiston, who managed his
large estates, championed Protestantism, and wrote on varied topics. He
was interested only in certain aspects of mathematics, chiefly those
relating to computation and trigonometry. “Napier’s rods” or “bones”
were sticks on which multiplication tables were carved in a form ready
to be applied to lattice multiplication; “Napier’s analogies” and
“Napier’s rule of circular parts” were devices to aid the memory in
connection with spherical trigonometry.</p>
<p>Napier tells us that he had been working on his invention of
logarithms for twenty years before he published his results, a statement
that would place the origin of his ideas about 1594. He evidently had
been thinking of the sequences, which had been published now and then,
of successive powers of a given number—as in Stifel’s Arithmetica
Integra fifty years earlier and as in the works of Archimedes. In such
sequences, it was obvious that sums and differences of indices of the
powers corresponded to products and quotients of the powers themselves,
but a sequence of</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms</p>
<p>integral powers of a base, such as two, could not be used for
computational purposes because the large gaps between successive terms
made interpolation too inaccurate. While Napier was pondering the
matter, Dr. John Craig, a physician to James VI of Scotland, called on
him and told him of prosthaphaeresis being used in Tycho Brahe’s
observatory in Denmark. Word of this encouraged Napier to redouble his
efforts and ultimately to publish in 1614 the Mirifici Logarithmorum
Canonis Descriptio (A Description of the Marvelous Rule of
Logarithms).</p>
<p>The key to Napier’s work can be explained very simply. To keep the
terms in a geometric progression of integral powers of a given number
close together, it is necessary to take as the given number something
quite close to 1. Napier therefore chose to use 1210 7 (or .9999999) as
his given number. Now the terms in the progression of increasing powers
are indeed close together—too close, in fact. To achieve a balance and
to avoid decimals, Napier multiplied each power by 107. That is, if
N5107(121/107)L, then L is Napier’s “logarithm” of the number N. Thus,
his logarithm of 107 is 0, his logarithm of 107(121/107)59999999 is 1,
and so on. If his numbers and his logarithms were to be divided by 107,
one would virtually have a system of logarithms to the base 1/e, for
(121/107)107 isclosetolimn-N(121/n)n 51/e.Itmustberemembered,
however,thatNapierhadnoconceptofabaseforasystemoflogarithms,for his
definition was different from ours. The principles of his work were
explained in geometric terms as follows. Let a line segment AB and a
half line or ray CDE … be given (Fig. 14.1). Let a point P start from A
and move along AB with variable speed decreasing in proportion to its
distance from B; during the same time, let a point Q start from C and
move along CDE … with uniform speed equal to the rate with which point P
began its motion. Napier called this variable distance CQ the logarithm
of the distance PB.</p>
<p>Napier’s geometric definition is, of course, in agreement with the
numerical description given earlier. To show this, let PB5x and CQ 5y.
If AB is taken as 107, and if the initial speed of P is also taken as
107, then in modern calculus notations we have dx/dt52x and dy/dt5107,
x0 5107, y0 50. Then, dy/dx52107 /x, or y52107 ln cx, where c is found
from the initial boundary conditions to be 10 7. Hence, y52107 ln
(x/l07) or y/107 5log1/e(x/107). That is, if the distances PB and CQ
were divided by 107, Napier’s definition would lead precisely to a
system of logarithms to the base 1/e, as mentioned earlier. Needless to
say, Napier built up his tables numerically, rather than geometrically,
as the word “logarithm,” which he coined, implies. At first, he called
his power indices “artificial numbers,” but later he made up the
compound of the two Greek words Logos (or ratio) and arithmos (or
number).</p>
<p>Napier did not think of a base for his system, but his tables
nevertheless were compiled through repeated multiplications, equivalent
to powers of .9999999. Obviously, the power (or number) decreases as
the</p>
<p>A P B</p>
<p>C D Q E</p>
<p>FIG. 14.1</p>
<p>index (or logarithm) increases. This is to be expected, because he
was essentially using a base 1/e, which is less than 1. A more striking
difference between his logarithms and ours lies in the fact that his
logarithm of a product (or a quotient) generally was not equal to the
sum (or difference) of the logarithms. If L1 5Log N1 and L2 5Log N2,
then7 N151077ð112102 7ÞL1 and N25107ð1210 7ÞL2, whence N1N2=1075</p>
<p>L 1L</p>
<p>10 ð1210 Þ so that the sum of Napier’s logarithms will be the7
logarithm not of N1N2 but of N1N2 /10 . Similar modifications hold, of
course, for logarithms of quotients, powers, and roots. If L 5Log N, for
instance, then nL5Log Nn /107(n 1). These differences are not too
significant, for they merely involve shifting a decimal point. That
Napier was thoroughly familiar with rules for products and powers is
seen in his remark that all numbers (he called them “sines”) in the
ratio of 2 to 1 have differences of 6,931,469.22 in logarithms, and all
of those in the proportion of 10 to 1 have differences of 23,025,842.34
in logarithms. In these differences we see, if we shift the decimal
point, the natural logarithms of the numbers 2 and 10. Hence, it is not
unreasonable to use the name “Napierian” for natural logarithms, even
though these logarithms are not strictly the ones that Napier had in
mind.</p>
<p>The concept of the logarithmic function is implied in Napier’s
definition and in all of his work with logarithms, but this relationship
was not uppermost in his mind. He had laboriously built up his system
for one purpose—the simplification of computations, especially of
products and quotients. Moreover, that he had trigonometric computations
in view is made clear by the fact that what we, for simplification of
exposition, referred to as Napier’s logarithm of a number, he actually
called the logarithm of a sine. In Fig. 14.1, the line CQ was called the
logarithm of the sine PB. This makes no real difference either in theory
or in practice.</p>
<p>Henry Briggs</p>
<p>The publication in 1614 of the system of logarithms was greeted with
prompt recognition, and among the most enthusiastic admirers was Henry
Briggs, the first Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford and the first
Gresham College professor of geometry. In 1615, he visited Napier at his
home in Scotland, and there they discussed possible modifications</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms</p>
<p>in the method of logarithms. Briggs proposed that powers of 10 should
be used, and Napier said he had thought of this and was in agreement.
Napier at one time had proposed a table using log 150 and log 1051010
(to avoid fractions). The two men finally concluded that the logarithm
of 1 should be zero and that the logarithm of 10 should be 1. Napier,
however, no longer had the energy to put their ideas into practice. He
died in 1617, the year in which his Rhabdologia, with its description of
his rods, appeared. The second of his classic treatises on logarithms,
the Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Constructio, in which he gave a full
account of the methods he used in building up his tables, appeared
posthumously in 1619. To Briggs, therefore, fell the task of making up
the first table of common, or Briggsian, logarithms. Instead of taking
powers of a number close to 1, as had Napier, Briggs began with log 1051
and then found other logarithms by taking successive roots. By finding
p1053:162277, for example, Briggs had log 3.1622775.5000000, and from
103=2 5p31:6227755:623413 he had log 5.6234135.7500000. Continuing in
this manner, he computed other common logarithms. In the year of
Napier’s death, 1617, Briggs published his Logarithmorum chilias
prima—that is, the logarithms of numbers from 1 to 1,000, each carried
out to fourteen places. In 1624, in Arithmetica logarithmica, Briggs
extended the table to include common logarithms of numbers from 1 to
20,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000, again to fourteen places. The
complete ten-place table of logarithms from 1 to 100,000 was published
three years later by two Dutchmen, the surveyor Ezechiel DeDecker and
the book publisher Adriaan Vlacq; with added corrections, it remained
the standard for more than three centuries. Work with logarithms now
could be carried out just as it is today, for all of the usual laws of
logarithms applied in connection with Briggs’s tables. Incidentally, it
is from Briggs’s book of 1624 that our words “mantissa” and
“characteristic” are derived. While Briggs was working out tables of
common logarithms, a contemporary mathematics teacher, John Speidell,
drew up natural logarithms of trigonometric functions and published
these in his New Logarithmes of 1619. A few natural logarithms had, in
fact, appeared earlier in 1616 in an English translation by Edward
Wright (1559 1615) of Napier’s first work on logarithms designed for the
use of navigators. Seldom has a new discovery “caught on” so rapidly as
did the invention of logarithms, and the result was the prompt
appearance of tables of logarithms.</p>
<p>Jobst Bu¨rgi</p>
<p>Napier was the first one to publish a work on logarithms, but very
similar ideas were developed independently in Switzerland by Jobst
Bu¨rgi at about the same time. In fact, it is possible that the idea of
logarithms had occurred to Bu¨rgi as early as 1588, which would be half
a dozen years before Napier began work in the same direction. Yet Bu¨rgi
printed his results only in 1620, half a dozen years after Napier had
published his Descriptio. Bu¨rgi’s work appeared at Prague in a book
titled Arithmetische und geometrische Progress-Tabulen, and this
indicates that the influences leading to his work were similar to those
operating in the case of Napier. The differences between the work of the
two men lie chiefly in their terminology and in the numerical values
they used; the fundamental principles were the same. Instead of
proceeding from a number a little less than 1 (as had Napier, who used
1210 7), Bu¨rgi chose a number a little greater than 1—the number 1110
4, and instead of multiplying powers of this number by 107, Bu¨rgi
multiplied by 108. There was one other minor difference: Bu¨rgi
multiplied all of his power indices by 10 in his tabulation. That is, if
N5108(1110 4)L, Bu¨rgi called 10L the “red” number corresponding to the
“black” number N. If in this scheme we were to divide all of the black
numbers by 108 and all of the red numbers by 105, we should virtually
have a system of natural logarithms. For instance, Bu¨rgi gave for the
black number 1,000,000,000 the red number 230,270.022, which, on
shifting decimal points, is equivalent to saying that ln 1052.30270022.
This is not a bad approx-4 imation to the modern value, especially when
we recall thatn ð1110 4Þ10 is not quite the same as limn-Nð111=nÞ ,
although the values agree to four significant figures.</p>
<p>Bu¨rgi must be regarded as an independent discoverer who lost credit
for the invention because of Napier’s priority in publication. In one
respect, his logarithms come closer to ours than do Napier’s, for as
Bu¨rgi’s black numbers increase, so do the red numbers, but the two
systems share the disadvantage that the logarithm of a product or a
quotient is not the sum or the difference of the logarithms.</p>
<h4 id="mathematical-instruments">Mathematical Instruments</h4>
<p>The invention of logarithms, as well as the spreading use of decimal
fractions, is closely linked to seventeenth-century efforts to invent
mathematical instruments that would facilitate computation. Three groups
of devices merit our attention: those leading to the computing sector of
the eighteenthandearly nineteenthcenturies:theGuntersscaleandearlyslide
rules, and the first mechanical adding and calculating machines.</p>
<p>Computing Sectors</p>
<p>The first group of instruments originated with Thomas Hood and
Galileo Galilei. Galileo had originally intended to take a degree in
medicine, but</p>
<p>a taste for Euclid and Archimedes led him instead to become a
professor of mathematics, first at Pisa and later at Padua. This does
not mean, however, that he taught on the level of the authors he
admired. Little mathematics was included in university curricula of the
time, and a large proportion of what was taught in Galileo’s courses
would now be classified as physics or astronomy or engineering
applications. Moreover, Galileo was not a “mathematician’s
mathematician,” as was Vie`te; he came close to being what we should
call a mathematical practitioner. Among his first inventions that may be
called special-purpose computing devices was a pulse measuring device.
His interest in computational techniques led him in 1597 to construct
and market a better-known device that he called his “geometric and
military compasses.”</p>
<p>In a pamphlet of 1606 with the title Le operazioni del compasso
geometricoetmilitare,hedescribedindetailthewayinwhichthegeometricand
militarycompasscouldbeusedtoquicklyperformavarietyofcomputations,
without pen or paper or an abacus. The theory behind this was extremely
elementary, and the degree of accuracy was very limited, but the
financial success of Galileo’s device shows that military engineers and
other practitioners found a need for such an aid in calculation. Bu¨rgi
had constructed a similar device, but Galileo had a better
entrepreneurial sense, one that gave him an advantage. The Galilean
compasses consisted of two arms pivoted as in the ordinary compasses of
today, but each of the arms was engraved with graduated scales of
varying types. Fig. 14.2 shows a reduced version with only one
arithmetic scale, the simple equi-spaced markings up to 250, and only
the simplest of the many possible computations, the first one
explainedbyGalileo,isdescribedhere.If,forinstance,onewishestodividea
given line segment into five equal parts, one opens a pair of ordinary
compasses (or dividers) to the length of the line segment. Then, one
opens the geometric compasses so that the distance between the points of
the dividers just spans the distance between two markings, one on each
arm of the geometric compasses, which are simple integral multiples of
five, say, the number 200 on each scale. Then, if one holds the opening
of the geometric</p>
<p>FIG. 14.2</p>
<p>A Butterfield sector (from the collections of the National Museum of
American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<p>compasses fixed and places the ends of the dividers on the mark for
40 on each scale, the distance between the divider points will be the
desired fifth of
thelengthoftheoriginallinesegment.TheinstructionsGalileoprovidedwith his
compasses included many other operations, from changing the scale of a
drawing to computing amounts of money under compound interest.</p>
<p>Gunters Scale and Slide Rules</p>
<p>It was Edmund Gunter (1581 1626), a graduate of Christ Church,
Oxford, and the rector of two churches, who invented a widely used
computing device and the precursor of the logarithmic slide rule. A
friend of Henry Briggs’s and a frequent visitor of Briggs at Gresham
College, he was appointed professor of astronomy at Gresham in 1620.
Shortly thereafter, he published a Description and Use of the Sector,
the Crosse-staffe and Other Instruments. Here he described what came to
be known as “the gunter” or Gunters scale, consisting of a 2-foot-long
logarithmic scale used with a pair of dividers. This and his other
contributions to mathematical instrumentation were motivated by his
interest in assisting sailors, surveyors, and others not skilled in
multiplication and other mathematical computational techniques. Other
devices that bear his name include the surveyor’s Gunters chain, a
portable chain 66 feet long consisting of 100 links (note that 1 acre is
43,560 or 66366310square feet). He also contributed to navigation by his
studies of magnetic declination and his observation of the secular
variation.</p>
<p>In 1624, Edmund Wingate displayed a Gunters scale to a group of
scientists and engineers in Paris. This resulted in a French description
of the device being published that same year. Wingate called it a rule
of proportion, and the French description indicated that it included
four lines: a line of numbers; a line of tangents; a line of sines; and
two 1-foot lines, one divided into inches and tenths of inches, the
other into tenths and hundredths.</p>
<p>A major drawback of the device was its length. By midcentury, Wingate
had circumvented this by splitting the scales, adding additional ones,
and using both sides of the rule. A number of other British innovators
brought out improvements on the rule as well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the early 1630s, several slide rules were publicized.
William Oughtred (1574 1660) invented a circular and a linear slide
rule. To do away with the dividers, he used two Gunter rules. Another
early deviser of slide rules was Richard Delamain, who claimed priority
over Oughtred’s invention by virtue of an earlier publication.</p>
<p>The interest aroused by the inventions, as well as the ensuing
priority disputes, led to the slide rule rapidly becoming a standard
accessory for people in occupations that involved computation on a
regular basis. Although the mathematical principles remained those
linked to the discoveries of the early seventeenth century, the form of
the slide rule best known in the twentieth century followed the 1850
design of the French army officer Ame´de´e Mannheim (1831 1906), who had
a long affiliation with the E´cole Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Adding and Calculating Machines</p>
<p>Mechanical adding and calculating machines also appeared in the
seventeenth century. Their history was the converse of that of computing
scales and slide rules. Here, there were no new mathematical principles,
as was true in the case of the devices that used the concept of
logarithms. Yet their acceptance was long delayed, largely because of
more complex</p>
<p>Pascal’s adding machine (from the collection of IBM)</p>
<p>Thomas’s first arithmometer (from the collections of the National
Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<p>construction requirements and higher costs. We mention the three best
known. Wilhelm Schickard (1592 1635), a Lutheran minister who held
academic positions as professor of Hebrew and, later, as professor of
mathematics and astronomy, was a correspondent of Kepler’s who used
Schickard’s talents as an engraver and arithmetician. Schickard produced
several designs of a mechanical device; the only one constructed at the
time was destroyed in a fire. Blaise Pascal designed an adding machine
to assist his father in tax and commercial computations, but although he
had several of his machines produced for sale and some have even turned
up in China, production was stopped after about ten years. Leibniz,
whose teacher Erhard Weigel had used an open meadow to drill multitudes
of adults in their multiplication tables, used the principle of a
movable carriage to emulate the concept of the carry in multiplication,
but his attempts to interest members of the leading scientific societies
in his machine were unsuccessful. The calculating machine industry did
not get off the ground until the nineteenth century, when Charles X.
Thomas of Colmar produced his so-called arithmometer, a stepped-drum,
movable-carriage machine.</p>
<h4 id="tables-1">Tables</h4>
<p>The application of logarithms was most notably successful in the
construction and use of mathematical tables. From the seventeenth
century, when the first logarithmic tables appeared, to the end of the
twentieth, when electronic devices replaced most other aids to
computation, tables were in the pockets and on the desks of men, women,
and children. Until the electronic computer became established, the
chief computing journal was called Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to
Computation.</p>
<p>Henry Briggs had already produced tables before he became aware of
Napier’s logarithms. In 1602, he had published “A Table to Find the
Height of the Pole, the Magnetic Declination Being Given,” and in 1610,
“Tables for the Improvement of Navigation.” After Briggs and Napier
first met, they frequently discussed tables of logarithms. We noted
earlier Briggs’s first publication on the subject of 1617 and his
subsequent Arithmetica Logarithmica. A posthumous English version,
titled Trigonometria Britannica, was issued by Gellibrand in 1633. In
1924, the tercentenary of Briggs’s Arithmetica Logarithmica, the first
part of a table to 20 decimal places appeared.</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1620, Gunter, too, had published seven-figure tables of
logarithms of sines and tangents in Canon Triangulorum, or Table of
Artificial Sines and Tangents. Most subsequent tables of logarithmic
trigonometric functions did not exceed this number of decimal places,
although in 1911, Andoyer in Paris published a table to 14 decimal
places with differences for every ten sexagesimal seconds. By that time,
table computation had been mechanized. In the 1820s, Charles Babbage had
designed a “difference engine,” a machine designed to eliminate errors
in table computation by applying the method of differences, performing
simultaneous additions, and printing the results. The first successfully
operating difference engine was designed by the Swedes Georg and his son
Edvard Scheutz and performed a variety of specialized table computations
at the Dudley Observatory in Albany, New York, in the late 1850s.</p>
<p>The Scheutz difference engine (from the collections of the National
Museum of</p>
<p>American History, Smithsonian Institution)</p>
<h4 id="infinitesimal-methods-stevin">Infinitesimal Methods: Stevin</h4>
<p>Being practical men, Stevin, Kepler, and Galileo all had need for
Archimedean methods, but they wished to avoid the logical niceties of
the method of exhaustion. It was largely the resulting modifications of
the ancient infinitesimal methods that ultimately led to the calculus,
and Stevin was one of the first to suggest changes. In his Statics of
1586, almost exactly a century before Newton and Leibniz published their
calculus, the engineer of Bruges demonstrated as follows that the center
of gravity of a triangle lies on its median. In the triangle ABC
inscribe a number of parallelograms of equal height whose sides are
pairwise parallel to one side and to the median drawn to this side (Fig.
14.3). The center of gravity of the inscribed figures will lie on the
median, by the Archimedean principle that bilaterally symmetrical
figures are in equilibrium. We may inscribe in the triangle an infinite
number of such parallelograms, however, and the greater the number of
parallelograms, the smaller will be the difference between the inscribed
figure and the triangle. Inasmuch as the difference can be made as small
as one pleases, the center of gravity of the triangle also lies on the
median. In some of the propositions on fluid pressure, Stevin
supplemented this geometric approach with a “demonstration by numbers,”
in which a sequence of numbers tended to a limiting value, but the
“Dutch Archimedes” had more confidence in a geometric proof than in an
arithmetic one.</p>
<h4 id="johannes-kepler">Johannes Kepler</h4>
<p>Whereas Stevin was interested in physical applications of infinitely
many infinitely small elements, Kepler had need for astronomical
applications, especially in connection with his elliptic orbits of 1609.
As early as 1604, Kepler had become involved with conic sections through
work in optics and the properties of parabolic mirrors. Whereas
Apollonius had been inclined to think of the conics as three distinct
types of curves—ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—Kepler preferred to
think of five species of conics, all belonging to a single family or
genus. With a strong imagination and a Pythagorean feeling for
mathematical</p>
<p>FIG. 14.3</p>
<p>Johanne s Kepler</p>
<p>harmony, in 1604 Kepler developed for conics (in his Ad Vitellionem
Paralipomena—i.e., Introduction to Vitello’s Optics) what we call the
principle of continuity. From the conic section made up simply of two
intersecting lines, in which the two foci coincide at the point of
intersection, we pass gradually through infinitely many hyperbolas as
one focus moves farther and farther from the other. When the one focus
is infinitely far away, we no longer have the double-branched hyperbola
but the parabola. As the moving focus passes beyond infinity and
approaches again from the other side, we pass through infinitely many
ellipses until, when the foci again coincide, we reach the circle.</p>
<p>The idea that a parabola has two foci, one at infinity, is due to
Kepler, as is also the word “focus” (Latin for “hearthside”); we find
this bold and fruitful speculation on “points at infinity” extended a
generation later in the geometry of Girard Desargues. Meanwhile, Kepler
found a useful approach to the problem of the infinitely small in
astronomy.</p>
<h4 id="johannes-kepler-1">Johannes Kepler</h4>
<p>In his Astronomia nova of 1609, he announced his first two laws of
astronomy: (1) the planets move about the sun in elliptical orbits with
the sun at one focus, and (2) the radius vector joining a planet to the
sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times.</p>
<p>In handling problems of areas such as these, Kepler thought of the
area as made up of infinitely small triangles with one vertex at the sun
and the other two vertices at points infinitely close together along the
orbit. In this way, he was able to use a crude type of integral calculus
resembling that of Oresme. The area of a circle, for example, is thereby
found by noting that the altitudes of the infinitely thin triangles
(Fig. 14.4) are equal to the radius. If we call the infinitely small
bases, lying along the circumference, b1, b2, … , bn, … , then the area
of the circle—that is, the sum of the areas of the triangles—will be
12b1r 112b2r 1?112bnr 1? or rðb11b21?1bn1?Þ. Inasmuch as the sum of the
b’s is the circumference C, the area A will be given by A5rC, the
well-known ancient theorem that Archimedes had proved more
carefully.</p>
<p>By analogous reasoning, Kepler knew the area of the ellipse, a result
of Archimedes’ that was not then extant. The ellipse can be obtained
from a circle of radius a through a transformation under which the
ordinate of the circle at each point is shortened according to a given
ratio, say b:a. Then, following Oresme, one can think of the area of the
ellipse and the area of the circle as made up of all of the ordinates
for points on the curves (Fig. 14.5), but inasmuch as the ratio of the
components of the areas is in the ratio b:a, the areas themselves must
have the same ratio. Yet the area of the circle is known to be πa2;
hence, the area of the ellipse x2 /a2 1y2 /b2 51 must be πab. This
result is correct, but the best that Kepler could do for the
circumference of the ellipse was to give the approximate formula π(a1b).
Lengths of curves in general and of the ellipse in particular were to
elude mathematicians for another half a century.</p>
<p>Kepler had worked with Tycho Brahe first in Denmark and later in
Prague, where, following Brahe’s death, Kepler became mathematician to
the emperor Rudolph II. One of his duties was the casting of</p>
<p>FIG. 14.4</p>
<p>Johanne s Kepler</p>
<p>horoscopes. Mathematicians, whether in the service of emperors or at
universities, found various applications for their talents. The year
1612 had been a very good one for wine, and, while Kepler was in Linz,
in Austria, he began to meditate on the crude methods then in use for
estimating the volumes of wine casks. He compared these with Archimedes’
methods on the volumes of conoids and spheroids, and then he proceeded
to find the volumes of various solids of revolution not previously
considered by Archimedes. For example, he revolved a segment of a circle
about its chord, calling the result a citron if the segment was less
than a semicircle and an apple if the segment exceeded a semicircle. His
volumetric method consisted of regarding the solids as composed of
infinitely many infinitesimal elements, and he proceeded much as we have
indicated earlier for areas. He dispensed with the Archimedean double
reductio ad absurdum, and in this, he was followed by most
mathematicians from that time to the present.</p>
<p>Kepler collected his volumetric thoughts in a book that appeared in
1615 under the title Stereometria Doliorum (Volume-Measurement of
Barrels). For a score of years, it seemed to have excited no great
interest, but in 1635, the Keplerian ideas were systematically expanded
in a celebrated book titled Geometria Indivisibilibus, written by
Bonaventura Cavalieri, a disciple of Galileo’s.</p>

<p>The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me.</p>
<p>Pascal</p>
<h4 id="galileos-two-new-sciences">Galileo’s Two New Sciences</h4>
<p>While Kepler had been studying wine barrels, Galileo was scanning the
heavens with his telescope and rolling balls down inclined planes. The
results of Galileo’s efforts were two famous treatises, one astronomical
and the other physical. They were both written in Italian, but we shall
refer to them in English as The Two Chief Systems (1632) and The Two New
Sciences (1638). The first was a dialogue concerning the relative merits
of the Ptolemaic and Copernican views of the universe, carried on by
three men: Salviati (a scientifically informed scholar), Sagredo (an
intelligent layman), and Simplicio (an obtuse Aristotelian). In the
dialogue, Galileo left little doubt about where his preferences lay, and
the consequences were his trial and detention. During the years of his
exile, he nevertheless prepared The Two New Sciences, a dialogue
concerning dynamics and the strength of materials, carried out by the
same three characters. Although neither of the two great Galilean</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>Galile o’s Two New Sciences</p>
<p>treatises was in a strict sense mathematical, there are in both of
them many points at which appeal is made to mathematics, frequently to
the properties of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.</p>
<p>The infinitely small was of more immediate relevance to Galileo than
the infinitely large, for he found it essential in his dynamics. Galileo
gave the impression that dynamics was a totally new science created by
him, and all too many writers since have agreed with this claim. It is
virtually certain, however, that he was thoroughly familiar with the
work of Oresme on the latitude of forms, and several times in The Two
New Sciences, Galileo had occasion to use a diagram of velocities
similar to the triangle graph of Oresme’s. Nevertheless, Galileo
organized Oresme’s ideas and gave them a mathematical precision that had
been lacking. Among the new contributions to dynamics was Galileo’s
analysis of projectile motion into a uniform horizontal component and a
uniformly accelerated vertical component. As a result, he was able to
show that the path of a projectile, disregarding air resistance, is a
parabola. It is a striking fact that the conic sections had been studied
for almost 2,000 years before two of them almost simultaneously found
applicability in science: the ellipse in astronomy and the parabola in
physics. Galileo mistakenly thought he had found a further application
of the parabola in the curve of suspension of a flexible rope or wire or
chain (catena), but mathematicians later in the century proved that this
curve, the catenary, not only is not a parabola, it is not even
algebraic. Galileo had noted the curve now known as the cycloid, traced
out by a point on the rim of a wheel as it rolls along a horizontal
path, and he tried to find the area under one arch of it. The best he
could do was to trace the curve on paper, cut out an arch, and weigh it;
then he concluded that the area was a little less than three times the
area of the generating circle. Galileo abandoned study of the curve,
suggesting only that the cycloid would make an attractive arch for a
bridge.</p>
<p>Amore important contribution to mathematics was made by Galileo inthe
Two Chief Systems of 1632, at a point on the “third day” when Salviati
adumbrated the idea of an infinitesimal of higher order. Simplicio had
argued that an object on a rotating earth should be thrown off
tangentially by the motion, but Salviati argued that the distance QR
through which an object has to fall to remain on the earth, while the
latter rotates through a small angle θ (Fig. 15.1), is infinitely small
compared with the tangential distance PQ through which the object
travels horizontally. Hence, even a very small downward tendency, as
compared with the forward impetus, will be sufficient to hold the object
on the earth. Galileo’s argument here is equivalent to saying that
PS5vers θ is an infinitesimal of higher order with respect to lines PQ
or RS or arc PR.</p>
<p>From the infinite in geometry, Salviati led Simplicio to the infinite
in arithmetic, pointing out that a one-to-one correspondence can be set
up between all of the integers and the perfect squares, despite the fact
that the further one proceeds in the sequence of integers, the scarcer
the perfect squares become. Through the simple expedient of counting</p>
<p>Bonav entura C avalier i</p>
<p>the perfect squares, a one-to-one correspondence is established in
which each integer inevitably is matched against a perfect square, and
vice versa. Even though there are many whole numbers that are not
perfect squares (and the proportion of these increases as we consider
larger and larger numbers), “we must say that there are as many squares
as there are numbers.” Galileo here was face-to-face with the
fundamental property of an infinite set—that a part of the set can be
equal to the whole set— but Galileo did not draw this conclusion.
Although Salviati correctly concluded that the number of perfect squares
is not less than the number of integers, he could not bring himself to
make the statement that they are equal. Instead, he simply concluded
that “the attributes ‘equal,’ ‘greater,’ and ‘less’ are not applicable
to infinite, but only to finite quantities.” He even asserted
(incorrectly, we now know) that one cannot say that one infinite number
is greater than another infinite number or even that an infinite number
is greater than a finite number. Galileo, like Moses, came within sight
of the promised land, but he could not enter it.</p>
<h4 id="bonaventura-cavalieri">Bonaventura Cavalieri</h4>
<p>Galileo had intended to write a treatise on the infinite in
mathematics, but if he did, it has not been found. Meanwhile, his
disciple Bonaventura Cavalieri (1598 1647) was spurred by Kepler’s
Stereometria, as well as by ancient and medieval views and by Galileo’s
encouragement, to organize his thoughts on infinitesimals in the form of
a book. Cavalieri was a member of a religious order (a Jesuate, not a
Jesuit, as is frequently but incorrectly stated) who lived in Milan and
Rome before becoming professor of mathematics at Bologna in 1629.
Characteristically for that time, he wrote on many aspects of pure and
applied mathematics— geometry, trigonometry, astronomy, and optics—and
he was the first Italian writer to appreciate the value of logarithms.
In his Directorium Universale Uranometricum of 1632, he published tables
of sines, tangents, secants, and versed sines, together with their
logarithms, to eight places; but the world remembers him instead for one
of the most influential books of the early modern period, the Geometria
Indivisibilibus Continuorum, published in 1635.</p>
<p>The argument on which the book is based is essentially that implied
by Oresme, Kepler, and Galileo—that an area can be thought of as made up
of lines or “indivisibles” and that a solid volume can be regarded
similarly as composed of areas that are indivisible or quasi-atomic
volumes. Although Cavalieri at the time could scarcely have realized it,
he was following in very respectable footsteps indeed, for this is
precisely the type of reasoning that Archimedes had used in the Method,
which at that time had been lost. But Cavalieri, unlike Archimedes, felt
no compunction about the logical deficiencies behind such
procedures.</p>
<p>The general principle that in an equation involving infinitesimals,
those of higher order are to be discarded because they have no effect on
the final result is frequently erroneously attributed to Cavalieri’s
Geometria Indivisibilibus. The author undoubtedly was familiar with such
an idea, for it is implied in some of the work of Galileo, and it
appeared more specifically in results of contemporary French
mathematicians, but Cavalieri assumed almost the opposite of this
principle. There was in Cavalieri’s method no process of continued
approximation or any omission of terms, for he used a strict one-to-one
pairing of the elements in two configurations. No elements are
discarded, no matter what the dimension. The general approach and the
specious plausibility of the method of indivisibles are well illustrated
by the proposition still known in many solid geometry books as “the
theorem of Cavalieri”:</p>
<p>If two solids have equal altitudes, and if sections made by planes
parallel to the bases and at equal distances from them are always in a
given ratio, then the volumes of the solids also are in this ratio
(Smith 1959, pp. 605609).</p>
<p>Cavalieri concentrated on an extremely useful geometric theorem
equivalent to the modern statement in the calculus</p>
<p>a n an11 x dx5:</p>
<p>0 n11</p>
<p>The statement and the proof of the theorem are very different from
those with which a modern reader is familiar, for Cavalieri compared
powers of the lines in a parallelogram parallel to the base with the
corresponding powers of lines in either of the two triangles into which
a diagonal divides the parallelogram. Let the parallelogram AFDC be
divided into two triangles by the diagonal CF (Fig. 15.2) and let HE be
an indivisible of triangle CDF that is parallel to the base CD. Then, on
taking BC5FE and drawing BM parallel to CD, it is easy to show that the
indivisible BM in triangle ACF will be equal to HE. Hence, one can pair
all of the</p>
<p>FIG. 15.2</p>
<p>B onav entura C avalier i</p>
<p>indivisibles of triangle CDF with equal indivisibles in triangle ACF,
and, therefore, the two triangles are equal. Inasmuch as the
parallelogram is the sum of the indivisibles in the two triangles, it is
clear that the sum of the first powers of the lines in one of the
constituent triangles is half of the sum of the first powers of the
lines in the parallelogram; in other words,</p>
<p>a a2 xdx5:</p>
<p>0 2</p>
<p>Through a similar but considerably more involved argument, Cavalieri
showed that the sum of the squares of the lines in the triangle is
one-third the sum of the squares of the lines in the parallelogram. For
the cubes of the lines, he found the ratio to be 1/4. Later he carried
the proof to higher powers, finally asserting, in Exercitationes
Geometricae Sex (Six Geometrical Exercises) of 1647, the important
generalization that for the nth powers, the ratio will be 1/(n11). This
was known at the same time to French mathematicians, but Cavalieri was
first to publish this theorem—one that was to open the way to many
algorithms in the calculus. Geometrica Indivisibilibus, which so greatly
facilitated the problem of quadratures, appeared again in a second
edition in 1653, but by that time, mathematicians had achieved
remarkable results in new directions that outmoded Cavalieri’s laborious
geometric approach.</p>
<p>The most significant theorem by far in Cavalieri’s work was his
equivalent of</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>a n an11</p>
<p>x dx5; 0 n11</p>
<p>but another contribution would also lead to important results. The
spiral r5aθ and the parabola x2 5ay had been known since antiquity
without anyone’s having previously noted a relationship between them,
until Cavalieri thought of comparing straight-line indivisibles with
curvilinear indivisibles. If, for example, one were to twist the
parabola x2 5ay (Fig. 15.3) around like a watch spring so that vertex O
remains fixed while point P becomes point Pu, then the ordinates of the
parabola can be thought of as transformed into radius vectors through
the relationships x5r and y5rθ between what we now call rectangular and
polar coordinates. The points on the Apollonian parabola x2 5ay then
will lie on the Archimedean spiral r5aθ. Cavalieri noted further that if
PPu is taken equal to the circumference of the circle of radius OPu, the
area within the first turn of the spiral is exactly equal to the area
between the parabolic arc OP and the radius vector OP. Here we see work
that amounts to analytic geometry and the calculus, yet Cavalieri was
writing before either of these subjects had been formally invented. As
in other parts of the history of mathematics, we see that great
milestones do not</p>
<p>appear suddenly but are merely the more clear-cut formulations along
the thorny path of uneven development.</p>
<h4 id="evangelista-torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</h4>
<p>The year 1647 in which Cavalieri died also marked the death of
another disciple of Galileo’s, the young Evangelista Torricelli (1608
1647). But in many ways, Torricelli represented the new generation of
mathematicians that was building rapidly on the infinitesimal foundation
that Cavalieri had sketched all too vaguely. Had Torricelli not died so
prematurely, Italy might have continued to share the lead in new
developments; as it turned out, France was the undisputed mathematical
center during the second third of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Torricelli was trained in mathematics at several Jesuit institutions
before studying with Benedetto Castelli, whose secretary he was for six
years. He became interested in the cycloid, possibly on the suggestion
of Marin Mersenne, perhaps through Galileo, whom Torricelli, like
Mersenne, greatly admired. He had brought himself to Galileo’s attention
while handling Castelli’s correspondence. In 1643, Torricelli sent
Mersenne the quadrature of the cycloid, and in 1644, he published a work
with the title De Dimensione Parabolae, to which he appended both the
quadrature of the cycloid and the construction of the tangent.
Torricelli made no mention of the fact that Gilles Persone de Roberval
had arrived at these results before him, and so in 1646, Roberval wrote
a letter accusing Torricelli of plagiarism from him and from Pierre de
Fermat (on maxima and minima). It is clear now that priority of
discovery belongs to Roberval, but priority in publication goes to
Torricelli, who probably rediscovered the area and the tangent
independently. Torricelli gave two quadratures, one making use of
Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles and the other of the ancient “method
of exhaustion.” For finding the tangent of the curve, he employed a
composition of motions reminiscent of Archimedes’ tangent to his
spiral.</p>
<p>E vangeli s t a Torricelli</p>
<p>The idea of the composition of movements was not original with either
Torricelli or Roberval, for Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, and others
had used it. Torricelli may have derived the idea from any one of these
men. Both Torricelli and Roberval applied the kinematic method to other
curves as well. A point on the parabola, for example, moves away from
the focus at the same rate at which it moves away from the directrix;
hence, the tangent will be the bisector of the angle between lines in
these two directions. Torricelli also made use of Fermat’s method of
tangents for the higher parabolas and extended Cavalieri’s comparison of
the parabola and the spiral by considering arc length, as well as area.
In the 1640s, they showed that the length of the first rotation of the
spiral r5aθ is equal to the length of the parabola x2 52ay from x50 to
x52πa. Fermat, ever one to seek generalizations, introduced the higher
spirals rn 5aθ and compared the arcs of these with the lengths of his
higher parabolas xn 1 52ay. Torricelli studied spirals of various kinds,
discovering the rectification of the logarithmic spiral.</p>
<p>Problems involving infinitesimals were by far the most popular at the
time, and Torricelli in particular delighted in these. In the De
Dimensione Parabolae, for instance, Torricelli gave twenty-one different
proofs of the quadrature of the parabola, using approaches about evenly
divided between the use of indivisibles and the “method of exhaustion.”
One in the first category is almost identical with the mechanical
quadrature given by Archimedes in his Method, presumably not then
extant. As might be anticipated, one in the second category is virtually
that given in Archimedes’ treatise On the Quadrature of the Parabola,
extant and well known at the time. Had Torricelli arithmetized his
procedures in this connection, he would have been very close to the
modern limit concept, but he remained under the heavily geometric
influence of Cavalieri and his other Italian contemporaries.
Nevertheless, Torricelli far outdid them in the flexible use of
indivisibles to achieve new discoveries.</p>
<p>One novel result of 1641 that greatly pleased Torricelli was his
proof that if an infinite area, such as that bounded by the hyperbola
xy5a2, an ordinate x2b, and the axis of abscissas, is revolved about the
x-axis, the volume of the solid generated may be finite. Torricelli
believed that he was first to discover that a figure with infinite
dimensions can have a finite magnitude, but in this respect, he may have
been anticipated by Fermat’s work on the areas under the higher
hyperbolas or possibly by Roberval and certainly by Oresme in the
fourteenth century.</p>
<p>Among the problems that Torricelli handled just before his premature
death in 1647 was one in which he sketched the curve whose equation we
should write as x5logy, perhaps the first graph of a logarithmic
function, thirty years after the death of the discoverer of logarithms
as a computational device. Torricelli found the area bounded by the
curve, its asymptote, and an ordinate, as well as the volume of the
solid obtained on revolving the area about the x-axis.</p>
<p>Torricelli was one of the most promising mathematicians of the
seventeenth century, which is often referred to as the century of
genius. Mersenne had made the work of Fermat, Descartes, and Roberval
known in Italy, both through correspondence with Galileo dating from
1635 and during a pilgrimage to Rome in 1644. Torricelli promptly
mastered the new methods, although he always favored the geometric over
the algebraic approach. Torricelli’s brief association with the blind
and aged Galileo in 1641 1642 had also aroused in the younger man an
interest in physical science, and today he is probably better recalled
as the inventor of the barometer than as a mathematician. He studied the
parabolic paths of projectiles fired from a point with fixed initial
speeds but with varying angles of elevation and found that the envelope
of the parabolas is another parabola. In going from an equation for
distance in terms of time to that for speed as a function of time, and
inversely, Torricelli saw the inverse character of quadrature and
tangent problems. Had he enjoyed the normal span of years, it is
possible that he would have become the inventor of the calculus, but a
cruel malady cut short his life in Florence only a few days after his
thirty-ninth birthday.</p>
<h4 id="mersennes-communicants">Mersenne’s Communicants</h4>
<p>France was the undisputed mathematical center during the second third
of the seventeenth century. The leading figures were Rene Descartes´
(1596 1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601 1665), but three other
contemporary Frenchmen also made important contributions: Gilles Persone
de Roberval (1602 1675), Girard Desargues (1591 1661), and Blaise Pascal
(1623 1662). The rest of this chapter focuses attention on these men. A
second focal point is provided by the generation following Descartes,
whose members, active in the Low Countries, produced some of the high
points of Cartesian mathematics.</p>
<p>No professional mathematical organizations yet existed, but in Italy,
France, and England, there were loosely organized scientific groups: the
Accademia dei Lincei (to which Galileo belonged) and the Accademia del
Cimento in Italy, the Cabinet DuPuy in France, and the Invisible College
in England. There was in addition an individual who, during the period
we are now considering, served through correspondence as a clearing
house for mathematical information. This was the Minimite friar Marin
Mersenne (1588 1648), a close friend of Descartes’ and Fermat’s, as of
many another mathematician of the time. Had Mersenne lived a century
earlier, the delay in information concerning the solution of the cubic
might not have occurred, for when Mersenne knew something, the whole of
the “Republic of Letters” was shortly informed about it.</p>
<p>Rene Descartes´</p>
<p>Descartes was born in La Haye and received a thorough education at
the Jesuit college at La Fleche, where the textbooks of Clavius were
fun-` damental. Later he took a degree at Poitiers, where he had studied
law, without much enthusiasm. For a number of years, he traveled about
in conjunction with various military campaigns, first in Holland with
Maurice, Prince of Nassau; then with Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria; and
later still with the French army at the siege of La Rochelle. Descartes
was not really a professional soldier, and his brief periods of service
in connection with campaigns were separated by intervals of independent
travel and study, during which he met some of the leading scholars in
various parts of Europe. In Paris, he met Mersenne and a circle of
scientists who freely discussed criticisms of Peripatetic thought; from
such stimulation, Descartes went on to become the “father of modern</p>
<p>Rene Descartes´</p>
<p>philosophy,” to present a changed scientific worldview, and to
establish a new branch of mathematics. In his most celebrated treatise,
the Discours de la me´thode pour bien conduire sa raison et chercher la
ve´rite´ dans les sciences (Discourse on the Method of Reasoning Well
and Seeking Truth in the Sciences) of 1637, he announced his program for
philosophical research. In this he hoped, through systematic doubt, to
reach clear and distinct ideas from which it would then be possible to
deduce innumerably many valid conclusions. This approach to science led
him to assume that everything was explainable in terms of matter (or
extension) and motion. The entire universe, he postulated, was made up
of matter in ceaseless motion in vortices, and all phenomena were to be
explained mechanically in terms of forces exerted by contiguous matter.
Cartesian science enjoyed great popularity for almost a century, but it
then necessarily gave way to the mathematical reasoning of Newton.
Ironically, it was in large part the mathematics of Descartes that later
made possible the defeat of Cartesian science.</p>
<p>Invention of Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>The philosophy and the science of Descartes were almost revolutionary
in their break with the past; his mathematics, by contrast, was linked
with earlier traditions.</p>
<p>Descartes had become seriously interested in mathematics by the time
he spent the cold winter of 1619 with the Bavarian army, where he lay
abed until ten in the morning, thinking out problems. It was during this
early period in his life that he discovered the polyhedral formula that
is usually named for Leonhard Euler: v1f5e12, where v, f, and e are the
number of vertices, faces, and edges, respectively, of a simple
polyhedron. Nine years later, Descartes wrote to a friend in Holland
that he had made such strides in arithmetic and geometry that he had no
more to wish for. Just what the strides were is not known, for Descartes
had published nothing, but the direction of his thoughts is indicated in
a letter of 1628 to his Dutch friend, where he gave a rule for the
construction of the roots of any cubic or quartic equation by means of a
parabola. This is, of course, essentially the type of thing that
Menaechmus had done for the duplication of the cube some 2,000 years
earlier and that Omar Khayyam had carried out for cubics in general
around the year 1100.</p>
<p>Whether Descartes by 1628 was in full possession of his analytic
geometry is not clear, but the effective date for the invention of
Cartesian geometry cannot be much later than that. At this time,
Descartes left France for Holland, where he spent the next twenty years.
Three or four years after he settled down there, another Dutch friend, a
classicist, called his attention to the three-and-four-line problem of
Pappus. Under the mistaken impression that the ancients had been unable
to solve this problem, Descartes applied his new methods to it and
succeeded without difficulty. This made him aware of the power and
generality of his point of view, and he consequently wrote the
well-known work La ge´ome´trie, which made analytic geometry known to
his contemporaries.</p>
<p>Arithmetization of Geometry</p>
<p>La g´eome´trie was not presented to the world as a separate treatise,
but as one of three appendices to the Discours de la me´thode, in which
Descartes thought to give illustrations of his general philosophical
method. The other two appendices were La dioptrique, containing the
first publication of the law of refraction (discovered earlier by
Willebrord Snell), and Les m´ete´ores, which included, among other
things, the first generally satisfactory quantitative explanation of the
rainbow. The original edition of the Discours was published without the
name of the author, but the authorship of the work was generally
known.</p>
<p>Cartesian geometry is now synonymous with analytic geometry, but
Descartes’ fundamental purpose was far removed from that of modern
textbooks. The theme is set by the opening sentence:</p>
<p>Any problem in geometry can easily be reduced to such terms that a
knowledge of the lengths of certain lines is sufficient for its
construction.</p>
<p>As this statement indicates, the goal is generally a geometric
construction and not necessarily the reduction of geometry to algebra.
The work of Descartes is far too often described simply as the
application of algebra to geometry, whereas it actually could be
characterized equally well as the translation of the algebraic
operations into the language of geometry. The very first section of La
g´eome´trie is titled “How the Calculations of Arithmetic Are Related to
the Operations of Geometry.” The second section
describes“HowMultiplication,Division,andtheExtractionofSquareRoots Are
Performed Geometrically.” Here Descartes was doing what had to some
extent been done from the time of al-Khwarizmi to Oughtred—furnishing a
geometric background for the algebraic operations. The five arithmetic
operationsareshowntocorrespondtosimpleconstructionswithstraightedge and
compasses, thus justifying the introduction of arithmetic terms in
geometry.</p>
<p>Descartes was more thorough in his symbolic algebra and in the
geometric interpretation of algebra than any of his predecessors. Formal
algebra had been advancing steadily since the Renaissance, and it found
its culmination in Descartes’ La g´eome´trie, the earliest mathematical
text that a present-day student of algebra can follow without
encountering difficulties in notation. About the only archaic symbol in
the book is the use of instead of 5 for equality. In one essential
respect, he broke from Greek tradition, for instead of considering x2
and x3, for example, as an area and a volume, he also interpreted them
as lines. This permitted him to abandon the principle of homogeneity, at
least explicitly, and yet retain geometric meaning. Descartes could
write an expression such as a2b2 2b, for, as he expressed it, one “must
consider the quantity a2b2 divided once by unity (that is, the unit line
segment), and the quantity b multiplied twice by unity.” It is clear
that Descartes substituted homogeneity in thought for homogeneity in
form, a step that made his geometric algebra more flexible—so flexible
indeed that today we read xx as “x squared” without ever seeing a square
in our mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Geometric Algebra</p>
<p>Book I includes detailed instructions on the solution of quadratic
equations, not in the algebraic sense of the ancient Babylonians, but
geometrically, somewhat in the manner of the ancient Greeks. To solve
the equation z2 5az1b2, for example, Descartes proceeded as follows.
Draw a line segment LM of length b (Fig. 15.4) and at L erect a segment
NL equal to a/2 and perpendicular to LM. With center N construct a
circle of radius a/2 and draw the line through M and N intersecting the
circle at O and P. Then, z5OM is the line desired. (Descartes ignored
the root PM of the equation because it is “false,” that is, negative.)
Similar constructions are given for z2 5az2b2 and for z2 1az5b2, the
only other quadratic equations with positive roots.</p>
<p>Having shown how algebraic operations, including the solution of
quadratics, are interpreted geometrically, Descartes turned to the
application of algebra to determine geometric problems, formulating far
more clearly than the Renaissance cossists the general approach:</p>
<p>If, then, we wish to solve any problem, we first suppose the solution
already effected, and give names to all the lines that seem needful for
its</p>
<p>construction to those that are unknown as well as to those that are
known. Then, making no distinction between known and unknown lines, we
must unravel the difficulty in any way that shows most naturally the
relations between these lines, until we find it possible to express a
single quantity in two ways. This will constitute an equation (in a
single unknown), since the terms of the one of these two expressions are
together equal to the terms of the other.</p>
<p>Throughout Books I and III of La ge´ome´trie, Descartes is primarily
concerned with this type of geometric problem, in which the final
algebraic equation can contain only one unknown quantity. Descartes was
well aware that it was the degree of this resulting algebraic equation
that determined the geometric means by which the required geometric
construction can be carried out.</p>
<p>If it can be solved by ordinary geometry, that is, by the use of
straight lines and circles traced on a plane surface, when the last
equation shall have been entirely solved there will remain at most only
the square of an unknown quantity, equal to the product of its root by
some known quantity, increased or diminished by some other quantity also
known.</p>
<p>Here we see a clear-cut statement that what the Greeks had called
“plane problems” lead to nothing worse than a quadratic equation.
Because Viete had already shown that the duplication of the cube and the
tri-` section of the angle lead to cubic equations, Descartes stated,
with inadequate proof, that these cannot be solved with straightedge and
compasses. Of the three ancient problems, therefore, only the squaring
of the circle remained open to question.</p>
<p>The title La ge´ome´trie should not mislead one into thinking that
the treatise is primarily geometric. Already in the Discourse, to which
the Geometry had been appended, Descartes had discussed the relative
merits of algebra and geometry, without being partial to either. He
charged the latter with relying too heavily on diagrams that
unnecessarily fatigue the imagination, and he stigmatized the former as
being a confused and obscure art that embarrasses the mind. The aim of
his method, therefore, was twofold: (1) through algebraic procedure to
free geometry from the use of diagrams and (2) to give meaning to the
operations of algebra through geometric interpretation. Descartes was
convinced that all mathematical sciences proceed from the same basic
principles, and he decided to use the best of each branch. His procedure
in La g´eome´trie, then, was to begin with a geometric problem, to
convert it to the language of an algebraic equation, and then, having
simplified the equation as far as possible, to solve this equation
geometrically, in a manner similar to that which he had used for the
quadratics.</p>
<p>Classification of Curves</p>
<p>Descartes was much impressed by the power of his method in handling
the three- and four-line locus, so he moved on to generalizations of
this problem—aproblemthatrunslikeathreadofAriadnethroughthethreebooks of
La ge´ome´trie. He knew that Pappus had been unable to tell anything
about the loci when the number of lines was increased to six or eight or
more, so Descartes proceeded to study such cases. He was aware that for
five or six lines the locus is a cubic, for seven or eight it is a
quartic, and so on. But Descartes showed no real interest in the shapes
of these loci, for he was obsessed with the question of the means needed
to construct geometrically the ordinates corresponding to given
abscissas. For five lines, for
example,heremarkedtriumphantlythatiftheyarenotallparallel,thenthe locus
is elementary in the sense that given a value for x, the line
representingyisconstructiblebyrulerandcompassalone.Iffourofthelinesare
parallel and equal distances a apart and the fifth is perpendicular to
the others (Fig. 15.5), and if the constant of proportionality in the
Pappus problem is taken as this same constant a, then the locus is given
by (a1x) (a2x)(2a2x)5axy, a cubic that Newton later called the Cartesian
parabolaortrident:x3 22ax2 2a2x12a3 5axy.Thiscurvecomesuprepeatedly in
La g´eome´trie, yet Descartes at no point gave a complete sketch of it.
His interest in the curve was threefold: (1) deriving its equation as a
Pappus locus, (2) showing its generation through the motion of curves of
lower degree, and (3) using it in turn to construct the roots of
equations of higher degree.</p>
<p>Descartes considered the trident constructible by plane means alone,
inasmuch as, for each point x on the axis of abscissas, the ordinate y
can be drawn with only ruler and compass. This is not, in general,
possible for five or more lines taken at random in the Pappus problem.
In the case</p>
<p>of not more than eight lines, the locus is a polynomial in x and y
such that for a given point on the x-axis, the construction of the
corresponding ordinate y requires the geometric solution of a cubic or
quartic equation, which, as we have seen, usually calls for the use of
conic sections. For not more than twelve lines in the Pappus problem,
the locus is a polynomial in x and y of not more than the sixth degree,
and the construction in general requires curves beyond the conic
sections. Here Descartes made an important advance beyond the Greeks in
problems of geometric constructibility. The ancients had never really
legitimized constructions that made use of curves other than straight
lines or circles, although they sometimes reluctantly recognized, as
Pappus did, the classes that they called solid problems and linear
problems. The second category in particular was a catchall class of
problems with no real standing.</p>
<p>Descartes now took the step of specifying an orthodox classification
of determinate geometric problems. Those that lead to quadratic
equations, and can therefore be constructed by lines and circles, he
placed in class one; those leading to cubic and quartic equations, the
roots of which can be constructed by means of conic sections, he placed
in class two; those leading to equations of degree five or six can be
constructed by introducing a cubic curve, such as the trident or the
higher parabola y5x3, and these he placed in class three. Descartes
continued in this manner, grouping geometric problems and algebraic
equations into classes, assuming that the construction of the roots of
an equation of degree 2n or 2n21 was a problem of class n.</p>
<p>The Cartesian classification by pairs of degrees seemed to be
confirmed by algebraic considerations. It was known that the solution of
the quartic was reducible to that of the resolvent cubic, and Descartes
extrapolated prematurely to assume that the solution of an equation of
degree 2n can be reduced to that of a resolvent equation of degree 2n21.
Many years later, it was shown that Descartes’ tempting generalization
does not hold. But his work did have the salutary effect of encouraging
the relaxation of the rules on constructibility so that higher plane
curves might be used.</p>
<p>Rectification of Curves</p>
<p>It will be noted that the Cartesian classification of geometric
problems included some, but not all, of those that Pappus had lumped
together as “linear.” In introducing the new curves that he needed for
geometric constructions beyond the fourth degree, Descartes added to the
usual axioms of geometry one more axiom:</p>
<p>Two or more lines (or curves) can be moved, one upon the other,
determining by their intersection other curves.</p>
<p>This in itself is not unlike what the Greeks had actually done in
their kinematic generation of curves such as the quadratrix, the
cissoid, the conchoid, and the spiral. But whereas the ancients had
lumped these together, Descartes now carefully distinguished between
those, such as the cissoid and the conchoid, that we should call
algebraic, and others, such as the quadratrix and the spiral, that are
now known as transcendental. To the first type, Descartes gave
full-fledged geometric status, along with the line, the circle, and the
conics, calling all of these the “geometric curves”; the second type he
ruled out of geometry entirely, stigmatizing them as “mechanical
curves.” The basis on which Descartes made this decision was “exactness
of reasoning.” Mechanical curves, he said, “must be conceived of as
described by two separate movements whose relation does not admit of
exact determination”—such as the ratio of circumference to diameter of a
circle in the case of the motions describing the quadratrix and the
spiral. In other words, Descartes thought of algebraic curves as exactly
described and of transcendental curves as inexactly described, for the
latter are generally defined in terms of arc lengths. On this matter he
wrote, in La ge´ome´trie:</p>
<p>Geometry should not include lines (or curves) that are like strings,
in that they are sometimes straight and sometimes curved, since the
ratios between straight and curved lines are not known, and I believe
cannot be discovered by human minds, and therefore no conclusion based
upon such ratios can be accepted as rigorous and exact.</p>
<p>Descartes here is simply reiterating the dogma, suggested by
Aristotle and affirmed by Averroe¨s (Ibn Rushd, 1126 1198), that no
algebraic curve can be exactly rectified. Interestingly enough, in 1638,
the year after the publication of La ge´ome´trie, Descartes ran across a
“mechanical” curve that turned out to be rectifiable. Through Mersenne,
Galileo’s representative in France, the question, raised in The Two New
Sciences, of the path of fall of an object on a rotating earth (assuming
the earth permeable) was widely discussed, and this led Descartes to the
equiangular or logarithmic spiral r5aebθ as the possible path. Had
Descartes not been so firm in his rejection of such nongeometric curves,
he might have anticipated Torricelli in discovering, in 1645, the first
modern rectification of a curve. Torricelli showed, by infinitesimal
methods that he had learned from Archimedes, Galileo, and Cavalieri,
that the total length of the logarithmic spiral from θ50 as it winds
backward about the pole O is exactly equal to the length of the polar
tangent PT (Fig. 15.6) at the point for which θ50. This striking result
did not, of course, disprove the Cartesian doctrine of the
nonrectifiability of algebraic curves. In fact, Descartes could have
asserted not only that the curve was not exactly determined, being
mechanical, but also that the arc of the curve has an asymptotic point
at the pole, which it never reaches.</p>
<p>Identification of Conics</p>
<p>Virtually the whole of La ge´ome´trie is devoted to a thoroughgoing
application of algebra to geometry and of geometry to algebra, but there
is little in the treatise that resembles what usually is thought of
today as analytic geometry. There is nothing systematic about
rectangular coordinates, for oblique ordinates are usually taken for
granted; hence, there are no formulas for distance, slope, point of
division, angle between two lines, or other similar introductory
material. Moreover, in the whole of the work there is not a single new
curve plotted directly from its equation, and the author took so little
interest in curve sketching that he never fully understood the meaning
of negative coordinates. He knew in a general sort of way that negative
ordinates are directed in a sense opposite to that taken as positive,
but he never made use of negative abscissas. Moreover, the fundamental
principle of analytic geometry—the discovery that indeterminate
equations in two unknowns correspond to loci—does not appear until the
second book, and then only somewhat incidentally.</p>
<p>The solution of any one of these problems of loci is nothing more
than the finding of a point for whose complete determination one
condition is wanting. … In every such case an equation can be obtained
containing two unknown quantities.</p>
<p>In one case only did Descartes examine a locus in detail, and this
was in connection with the three- and four-line locus problem of Pappus,
for which Descartes derived the equation y2 5ay 2bxy1cx2dx2. This is the
general equation of a conic passing through the origin; even though the
literal coefficients are understood to be positive, this is by far the
most comprehensive approach ever made to the analysis of the family of
conic sections. Descartes indicated conditions on the coefficients for
which the conic is a straight line, a parabola, an ellipse, or a
hyperbola, the analysis being in a sense equivalent to a recognition of
the characteristic of the equation of the conic. The author knew that by
a proper choice of the origin and the axes, the simplest form of the
equation is obtained, but he did not give any of the canonical forms.
The omission of much of the elementary detail made the work exceedingly
difficult for his contemporaries to follow. In concluding remarks,
Descartes sought to justify his inadequacy of exposition by the
incongruous assertion that he had left much unsaid in order not to rob
the reader of the joy of discovery.</p>
<p>Inadequate though the exposition is, it is Book II of La ge´ometrie´
that comes closest to modern views of analytic geometry. There is even a
statement of a fundamental principle of solid analytic geometry:</p>
<p>If two conditions for the determination of a point are lacking, the
locus of the point is a surface.</p>
<p>Yet, Descartes did not give any illustrations of such equations or
expand the brief hint of analytic geometry of three dimensions.</p>
<p>Normals and Tangents</p>
<p>Descartes was so fully aware of the significance of his work that he
regarded it as bearing to ancient geometry somewhat the same
relationship as the rhetoric of Cicero bears to the ABC’s of children.
His mistake, from our point of view, was in emphasizing determinate
equations, rather than indeterminate equations. He realized that all of
the properties of a curve, such as the magnitude of its area or the
direction of its tangent, are fully determined when an equation in two
unknowns is given, but he did not take full advantage of this
recognition. He wrote,</p>
<p>I shall have given here a sufficient introduction to the study of
curves when I shall have given a general method of drawing a straight
line making right angles with a curve at an arbitrarily chosen point
upon it. And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most
general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever
desired to know.</p>
<p>Descartes was quite right that the problem of finding the normal (or
the tangent) to a curve was of great importance, but the method that he
published in La ge´ome´trie was less expeditious than that which Fermat
had developed at about the same time.</p>
<p>Book II of La g´eome´trie also contains much material on the “ovals
of Descartes,” which are very useful in optics and are obtained by
generalizing the “gardener’s method” for constructing an ellipse by
means of strings. If D1 and D2 are the distances of a variable point P
from two fixed points F1 and F2, respectively, and if m and n are
positive integers and K is any positive constant, then the locus of P
such that mD11 nD2 5K is now known as an oval of Descartes, but the
author did not use the equations of the curves. Descartes realized that
his methods can be extended to “all those curves which can be conceived
of as generated by the regular movement of the points of a body in
three-dimensional space,” but he did not carry out any details. The
sentence with which Book II concludes, “And so I think I have omitted
nothing essential to an understanding of curved lines,” is presumptuous
indeed.</p>
<p>The third and last book of La ge´ome´trie resumes the topic of Book
I: the construction of the roots of determinate equations. Here the
author warns that in such constructions, “We should always choose with
care the simplest curve that can be used in the solution of a problem.”
This means, of course, that one must be fully aware of the nature of the
roots of the equation under consideration, and in particular one must
know whether the equation is reducible. For this reason, Book III is
virtually a course in the elementary theory of equations. It tells how
to discover rational roots, if any; how to depress the degree of the
equation when a root is known; how to increase and decrease the roots of
an equation by any amount or to multiply or divide them by a number; how
to eliminate the second term; how to determine the number of possible
“true” and “false” roots (that is, positive and negative roots) through
the well-known “Descartes’ rule of signs”; and how to find the algebraic
solution of cubic and quartic equations. In closing, the author reminds
the reader that he has given the simplest constructions possible for
problems in the various classes mentioned earlier. In particular, the
trisection of the angle and the duplication of the cube are in class
two, requiring more than circles and lines for their construction.</p>
<p>Descartes’ Geometric Concepts</p>
<p>Our account of Descartes’ analytic geometry should make clear how far
removed the author’s thought was from the practical considerations that
are now so often associated with the use of coordinates. He did not lay
down a coordinate frame to locate points as a surveyor or a geographer
might do, nor were his coordinates thought of as number pairs. In this
respect, the phrase “Cartesian product,” so often used today, is an
anachronism. La ge´ome´trie was in its day just as much a triumph of
impractical theory as was the Conics of Apollonius in antiquity, despite
the inordinately useful role that both were ultimately destined to play.
Moreover, the use of oblique coordinates was much the same in both
cases, thus confirming that the origin of modern analytic geometry lies
in antiquity, rather than in the medieval latitude of forms. The
coordinates of Oresme, which influenced Galileo, are closer, both in
motive and in appearance, to the modern point of view than are those of
Apollonius and Descartes. Even if Descartes was familiar with Oresme’s
graphical representation of functions, and this is not evident, there is
nothing in Cartesian thought to indicate that he would have seen any
similarity between the purpose of the latitude of forms and his own
classification of geometric constructions. The theory of functions
ultimately profited greatly from the work of Descartes, but the notion
of a form or a function played no apparent role in leading to Cartesian
geometry.</p>
<p>In terms of mathematical ability, Descartes was probably the most
able thinker of his day, but he was at heart not really a mathematician.
His geometry was only an episode in a life devoted to science and
philosophy, and although occasionally in later years he contributed to
mathematics through correspondence, he left no other great work in this
field. In 1649, he accepted an invitation from Queen Christina of Sweden
to instruct her in philosophy and to establish an academy of sciences in
Stockholm. Descartes had never enjoyed robust health, and the rigors of
a Scandinavian winter were too much for him; he died early in 1650.</p>
<h4 id="fermats-loci">Fermat’s Loci</h4>
<p>If Descartes had a rival in mathematical ability, it was Fermat, but
the latter was in no sense a professional mathematician. Fermat studied
law at Toulouse, where he then served in the local parlement, first as a
lawyer and later as councilor. This meant that he was a busy man, yet he
seems to have had time to enjoy as an avocation a taste for classical
literature, science, and mathematics. The result was that by 1629, he
began to make discoveries of capital importance in mathematics. In this
year, he joined in one of the favorite sports of the time—the
“restoration” of lost works of antiquity on the basis of information
found in extant classical treatises. Fermat undertook to reconstruct the
Plane Loci of Apollonius, depending on allusions contained in the
Mathematical Collection of Pappus. A by-product of this effort was the
discovery, at least by 1636, of the fundamental principle of analytic
geometry:</p>
<p>Whenever in a final equation two unknown quantities are found, we
have a locus, the extremity of one of these describing a line, straight
or curved.</p>
<p>This profound statement, written a year before the appearance of
Descartes’ Geometry, seems to have grown out of Fermat’s application of
the analysis of Viete to the study of loci in Apollonius. In this case,
as also in` that of Descartes, the use of coordinates did not arise from
practical considerations or from the medieval graphical representation
of functions. It came about through the application of Renaissance
algebra to problems from ancient geometry. Yet Fermat’s point of view
was not entirely in</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L o c i</p>
<p>conformity with that of Descartes, for Fermat emphasized the
sketching of
solutionsofindeterminateequations,insteadofthegeometricconstruction of
the roots of determinate algebraic equations. Moreover, where Descartes
had built his Geometry around the difficult Pappus problem, Fermat
limitedhisexposition,intheshorttreatisetitledAdLocosPlanosetSolidos
Isagoge (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci), to the simplest loci
only. Where Descartes had begun with the three- and four-line locus,
using one of the lines as an axis of abscissas, Fermat began with the
linear equation and chose an arbitrary coordinate system on which to
sketch it.</p>
<p>Using the notation of Viete, Fermat first sketched the simplest case
of<code>a linear equation—given in Latin as “D in A aequetur B in E” (that is, Dx5By in modern symbolism). The graph is, of course, a straight line through the origin of coordinates—or rather a half line with the origin as end point, for Fermat, like Descartes, did not use negative abscissas. The more general linear equation ax1by5c2 (for Fermat retained Viete’s</code>
homogeneity) he sketched as a line segment in the first quadrant
terminated by the coordinate axes. Next, to show the power of his method
for handling loci, Fermat announced the following problem that he had
discovered by the new approach:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, in a plane, the locus of a point
such that the sum of any multiples of the segments drawn at given angles
from the point to the given lines is constant, is a straight line.</p>
<p>That is, of course, a simple corollary of the fact that the segments
are linear functions of the coordinates and of Fermat’s proposition that
every equation of the first degree represents a straight line.</p>
<p>Fermat next showed that xy5k2 is a hyperbola and that an equation of
the form xy1a2 5bx1cy can be reduced to one of the form xy5k2 (by a
translation of axes). The equation x2 5y2 he considered as a single
straight
line(orray),forheoperatedonlyinthefirstquadrant,andhereducedother
homogeneous equations of the second degree to this form. Then, he showed
that a2 6x2 5by is a parabola, that x2 1y2 12ax12by5c2 is a circle, that
a2 2x2 5ky2 is an ellipse, and that a2 1x2 5ky2 is a hyperbola
(forwhichhegavebothbranches).Tomoregeneralquadraticequations,in
whichtheseveralsecond-degreetermsappear,Fermatappliedarotationof axes to
reduce them to the earlier forms. As the “crowning point” of his
treatise, Fermat considered the following proposition:</p>
<p>Given any number of fixed lines, the locus of a point such that the
sum of the squares of the segments drawn at given angles from the point
to the lines is constant, is a solid locus.</p>
<p>This proposition is obvious in terms of Fermat’s exhaustive analysis
of the various cases of quadratic equations in two unknowns. As an
appendix to the Introduction to Loci, Fermat added “The Solution of
Solid Problems by Means of Loci,” pointing out that determinate cubic
and quartic equations can be solved by conics, the theme that had loomed
so large in the geometry of Descartes.</p>
<p>Higher-Dimensional Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Fermat’s Introduction to Loci was not published during the author’s
lifetime; hence, analytic geometry in the minds of many was regarded as
the unique invention of Descartes. It is now clear that Fermat had
discovered
essentiallythesamemethodwellbeforetheappearanceofLag´eome´trieand that
his work circulated in manuscript form until its publication in 1679 in
Varia opera mathematica. It is a pity that Fermat published almost
nothing during his lifetime, for his exposition was much more systematic
and didactic than that of Descartes. Moreover, his analytic geometry was
somewhat closer to ours,in that ordinatesare usuallytaken at
rightanglesto the line of abscissas. Like Descartes, Fermat was aware of
an analytic geometry of more than two dimensions, for in another
connection he wrote,</p>
<p>Therearecertainproblemswhichinvolveonlyoneunknown,andwhichcan be
called determinate, to distinguish them from the problems of loci. There
are certain others which involve two unknowns and which can never be
reduced to a single one; these are the problems of loci. In the first
problems we seek a unique point, in the latter a curve. But if the
proposed problem involves three unknowns, one has to find, to satisfy
the equation, not only a point or a curve, but an entire surface. In
this way surface loci arise, etc.</p>
<p>Here in the final “etc.” there is a hint of geometry of more than
three dimensions, but if Fermat really had this in mind, he did not
carry it further. Even the geometry of three dimensions had to wait
until the eighteenth century for its effective development.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Differentiations</p>
<p>It is possible that Fermat was in possessionof his analytic geometry
asearly as 1629, for about this time he made two significant discoveries
that are closely related to his work on loci. The more important of
these was described a few years later in a treatise, again unpublished
in his lifetime,
titledMethodofFindingMaximaandMinima.Fermathadbeenconsidering
locigiven(inmodernnotation)byequationsoftheformy5xn;hence,today
theyareoftenknownas“parabolasofFermat”ifnispositiveor“hyperbolas of
Fermat” if n is negative. Here we have an analytic geometry of higher
plane curves, but Fermat went further. For polynomial curves of the form
y5f(x), he noted a very ingenious method of finding points at which
the</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L o c i</p>
<p>function takes on a maximum or a minimum value. He compared the value
of f(x) at a point with the value f(x1E) at a neighboring point.
Ordinarily, these values will be distinctly different, but at the top or
the bottom of a smooth curve, the change will be almost imperceptible.
Hence, to find maximum and minimum points Fermat equated f(x) and
f(x1E), realizing thatthevalues,althoughnotexactly
thesame,arealmostequal.Thesmaller the interval E between the two points,
the nearer the pseudoequality comes to being a true equation, so Fermat,
after dividing through by E, set E50.
Theresultsgavehimtheabscissasofthemaximumandtheminimumpoints of the
polynomial. Here in essence is the process now called differentiation,
for the method of Fermat is equivalent to finding</p>
<p>fðx1EÞ2fðxÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>E-0 E</p>
<p>and setting this equal to zero. Hence, it is appropriate to follow
Laplace in acclaiming Fermat as the discoverer of the differential
calculus, as well as a codiscoverer of analytic geometry. Fermat was not
in possession of the limit concept, but, otherwise, his method of maxima
and minima parallels that used in the calculus today.</p>
<p>During the very years in which Fermat was developing his analytic
geometry, he also discovered how to apply his neighborhood process to
find the tangent to an algebraic curve of the form y5f(x). If P is a
point on the curve y5f(x) at which the tangent is desired, and if the
coordinates of P are (a, b), then a neighboring point on the curve with
coordinates x2a1E, y5f(a1E) will lie so close to the tangent that one
can think of it as approximately on the tangent, as well as on the
curve. If, therefore, the subtangent at the point P is TQ5c (Fig. 15.7),
the triangles TPQ and TPuQu can be taken as being virtually similar.
Hence, one has the proportion</p>
<p>b fða1EÞ</p>
<p>5 :</p>
<p>c c1E</p>
<p>On cross-multiplying, canceling like terms, recalling that b5f(a),
then dividing through by E, and finally setting E50, the subtangent c is
readily found.</p>
<p>Fermat’s procedure amounts to saying that</p>
<p>fða1EÞ2fðaÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>E-0 E</p>
<p>is the slope of the curve at x 5a, but Fermat did not explain his
procedure satisfactorily, saying simply that it was similar to his
method of maxima and minima. Descartes in particular, when the method
was reported to him in 1638 by Mersenne, attacked it as not generally
valid. He proposed as a challenge the curve ever since known as the
“folium of Descartes”: x3 1y3 53axy. That mathematicians of the time
were quite unfamiliar with negative coordinates is apparent, in that the
curve was drawn as but a single folium or “leaf” in the first
quadrant—or sometimes as a four-leaf clover, with one leaf in each
quadrant! Ultimately, Descartes grudgingly conceded the validity of
Fermat’s tangent method, but Fermat was never accorded the esteem to
which he was entitled.</p>
<p>Fermat’s Integrations</p>
<p>Fermat not only had a method for finding the tangent to curves of the
form y5xm, he also, some time after 1629, hit on a theorem on the area
under these curves—the theorem that Cavalieri published in 1635 and
1647. In finding the area, Fermat at first seems to have used formulas
for the sums of powers of the integers, or inequalities of the form</p>
<p>m m m m nm11 m m m</p>
<p>1 12 13 1 1n ..1 12 13 1 1ðn21Þm m11</p>
<p>to establish the result for all positive integral values of m. This,
in itself, was an advance over the work of Cavalieri, who limited
himself to the cases from m51 to m59, but later Fermat developed a
better method for handling the problem, which was applicable to
fractional, as well as integral, values of m. Let the curve be y5xn, and
seek the area under the curve from x50 to x5a. Then Fermat subdivided
the interval from x50 to x5a into infinitely many subintervals by taking
the points with abscissas a, aE, aE2, aE3,…, where E is a quantity less
than 1. At these points, he erected ordinates to the curve and then
approximated to the area under the curve by means of rectangles (as
indicated in Fig. 15.8). The areas of the successive approximating
circumscribed rectangles, beginning with the largest, are given by the
terms in geometric progression an(a2aE), anEn(aE2aE2), anE2n(aE2 2aE3)….
The sum to infinity of these terms is</p>
<p>Gr e gor y of St. V|ncent</p>
<p>an11ð12n1E1 Þ a2n11 n or :</p>
<p>12E 11E 1E 1 1E</p>
<p>As E tends toward 1—that is, as the rectangles become narrower—the
sum of the areas of the rectangles approaches the area under the curve.
On letting E 5 1 in the previous formula for the sum of the rectangles,
we obtain (an11)/(n11), the desired area under the curve y5xn from x50
to x5a. To show that this also holds for rational fractional values,

<p>Gregory of St.Vincent</p>
<p>For n5 1 the procedure fails, but Fermat’s older contemporary Gregory
of St. Vincent (1584 1667) disposed of this case in his Opus Geometricum
Quadraturae Circuli et Sectionum Coni (Geometrical Work on the Squaring
of the Circle and of Conic Sections). Much of this work had been
completed before the time that Fermat was working on tangents and areas,
perhaps as early as 1622 1625, although it was not published until 1647.
Gregory of St. Vincent, born in Ghent, was a Jesuit teacher in Rome and
Prague and later became a tutor at the court of Philip IV of Spain.
Through his travels, he became separated from his papers, with the
result that the appearance of the Opus Geometricum was long delayed. In
this treatise, Gregory had shown that if along the x-axis one marks off
from x5a points the intervals between which are increasing in continued
geometric proportion, and if at these points ordinates are erected to
the hyperbola xy51, then the areas under the curve intercepted between
successive ordinates are equal. That is, as the abscissa increases
geometrically, the area under the curve increases arithmetically. Hence,
the equivalent of bx 1dx5lnb2lna was known to Gregory and his
contemporaries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a faulty application of the method of indivisibles had
ledÐa Gregory of St. Vincent to believe that he had squared the circle,
an error that damaged his reputation.</p>
<p>Fermat had been concerned with many aspects of infinitesimal
analysis—tangents, quadratures, volumes, lengths of curves, centers of
gravity. He could scarcely have failed to notice that in finding
tangents to y5kxn, one multiplies the coefficient by the exponent and
lowers the exponent by 1, whereas in finding areas one raises the
exponent and divides by the new exponent. Could the inverse nature of
these two problems have escaped him? Although this seems unlikely, it
nevertheless appears that he nowhere called attention to the
relationship now known as the fundamental theorem of the calculus.</p>
<p>The inverse relationship between area and tangent problems should
have been apparent from a comparison of Gregory of St. Vincent’s area
under the hyperbola and Descartes’ analysis of inverse tangent problems
proposed through Mersenne in 1638. The problems had been set by
Florimond Debeaune (1601 1652), a jurist at Blois who was also an
accomplished mathematician, for whom even Descartes expressed
admiration. One of the problems called for the determination of a curve
whose tangent had the property now expressed by the differential
equation ady/dx5x2y. Descartes recognized the solution as nonalgebraic,
but he evidently just missed seeing that logarithms were involved.</p>
<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>Fermat’s contributions to analytic geometry and to infinitesimal
analysis were but two aspects of his work—and probably not his favorite
topics. In 1621, the Arithmetica of Diophantus had come to life again
through the Greek and Latin edition by Claude Gaspard de Bachet (1591
1639), a member of an informal group of scientists in Paris.
Diophantus’s Arithmetica had not been unknown, for Regiomontanus had
thought of printing it; several translations had appeared in the
sixteenth century, with little result for the theory of numbers. Perhaps
the work of Diophantus was too impractical for the practitioners and too
algorithmic for the speculatively inclined, but it appealed strongly to
Fermat, who became the founder of the modern theory of numbers. Many
aspects of</p>
<p>T he T he or y of Numb er s</p>
<p>the subject caught his fancy, including perfect and amicable numbers,
figurate numbers, magic squares, Pythagorean triads, divisibility, and,
above all, prime numbers. He proved some of his theorems by a method
that he called his “infinite descent”—a sort of inverted mathematical
induction, a process that Fermat was among the first to use. As an
illustration of his process of infinite descent, let us apply it to an
old andp familiar problem—the proof that 3 is not rational. Let us
assume that p35a1=b1, where al and b1 are positive integers with a1 .b1.
Because</p>
<p>1 p311 p 5 ;</p>
<p>321 2</p>
<p>on replacing the first p3 by its equal a1 /b1, we have</p>
<p>p 3b1 2a1</p>
<p>35: a1 2b1</p>
<p>In view of the inequality ,a1=b1 ,2, it is clear that 3b1 2a1 and a1
2b1 are positive integers, a2 and b2, each less than a1 and b1,
respectively, and such that p35a2=b2. This reasoning can be repeated
indefinitely, leading to an infinite descent in which an and bn are ever
smaller integers such that p35an=bn. This implies the false conclusion
that there is no smallest positive integer. Hence, the premise that p3
is a quotient of integers must be false.</p>
<p>Using his method of infinite descent, Fermat was able to prove
Girard’s assertion that every prime number of the form 4n11 can be
written in one and only one way as the sum of two squares. He showed
that if 4n11 is not the sum of two squares, there is always a smaller
integer of this form that is not the sum of two squares. Using this
recursive relationship backward leads to the false conclusion that the
smallest integer of this type, 5, is not the sum of two squares (whereas
5512 122). Hence, the general theorem is proved to be true. Because it
is easy to show that no integer of the form 4n21 can be the sum of two
squares and because all primes except 2 are of the form 4n11 or 4n21, by
Fermat’s theorem one can easily classify prime numbers into those that
are and those that are not the sum of two squares. The prime 23, for
example, cannot be so divided, whereas the prime 29 can be written as 22
152. Fermat knew that a prime of either form can be expressed as the
difference of two squares in one and only one way.</p>
<p>The Theorems of Fermat</p>
<p>Fermat used his method of infinite descent to prove that there is no
cube that is divisible into two cubes—that is, that there are no
positive integers x, y, and z such that x3 1y3 5z3. Going further,
Fermat stated the general proposition that for n, an integer greater
than 2, there are no positive integral values x, y, and z such that xn
1yn 5zn. He wrote in the margin of his copy of Bachet’s Diophantus that
he had a truly marvelous proof of this celebrated theorem, which has
since become known as Fermat’s “last,” or “great,” theorem. Fermat, most
unfortunately, did not give his proof but only described it as one
“which this margin is too narrow to contain.” If Fermat did indeed have
such a proof, it has remained lost to this day. Despite all efforts to
find a proof, once stimulated by a pre2World War I prize offer of
100,000 marks for a solution, the problem remained unsolved until the
1990s. Yet the search for solutions has led to even more good
mathematics than that which in antiquity resulted from efforts to solve
the three classical and unsolvable geometric problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps two millennia before Fermat’s day, there had been a “Chinese
hypothesis” that held that n is prime if and only if 2n 22 is divisible
by n, wherenisanintegergreaterthan1.Halfofthisconjectureisnowknownto
befalse,for2341 22isdivisibleby341,and34151131iscomposite, but the other
half is indeed valid, and Fermat’s “lesser” theorem is a generalization
of this. A consideration of many cases of numbers of the form ap 1 21,
including 236 21, suggested that whenever p is prime and a is prime to
p, then ap l 21 is divisible by p. On the basis of an induction from
only five cases (n50, 1, 2, 3, and 4), Fermat formulated a second
conjecture—that integers of the form 22n, now known as “Fermat numbers,”
are always prime. A century later, Euler showed this conjecture to be
false, for 225 11 is composite. In fact, it is now known that 22n 11 is
not prime for numerous ns above 5, and we begin to wonder whether there
is even one more prime Fermat number beyond those that Fermat knew.</p>
<p>Fermat’slessertheoremfaredbetterthanhisconjectureonprimeFermat
numbers. A proof of the theorem was left in manuscript by Leibniz, and
another elegant and elementary demonstration was published by Euler in
1736. The proof by Euler makes ingenious use of mathematical induction,
a device with which Fermat, as well as Pascal, was quite familiar. In
fact, mathematical induction, or reasoning by recurrence, is sometimes
referred to as “Fermatian induction,” to distinguish it from scientific,
or “Baconian,” induction.</p>
<p>Fermat was truly “the prince of amateurs” in mathematics. No
professional mathematician of his day made greater discoveries or
contributed more to the subject, yet Fermat was so modest that he
published virtually nothing. He was content to write of his thoughts to
Mersenne (whose name, incidentally, is preserved in connection with the
“Mersenne numbers,” that is, primes of the form 2p 21) and thus lost
priority credit for much of his work. In this respect, he shared the
fate of one of his most capable friends and contemporaries—the unamiable
professor Roberval, a</p>
<p>Gille s P er s one de Rob er val</p>
<p>member of the “Mersenne group” and the only truly professional
mathematician among the Frenchmen whom we discuss in this chapter.</p>

phrase “the Helen of geometers” came to be applied because of the
frequency with which it provoked quarrels during the seventeenth
century. In 1615, Mersenne had called mathematicians’ attention to the
cycloid, perhaps having heard of the curve through Galileo; in 1628,
when Roberval arrived in Paris, Mersenne proposed to the young man that
he study the curve. By 1634, Roberval was able to show that the area
under one arch of thecurveis exactly threetimesthearea
ofthegeneratingcircle.By1638,he had found how to draw the tangent to the
curve at any point (a problem also solved at about the same time by
Fermat and Descartes) and had found the volumes generated when the area
under an arch is revolved about the baseline. Later still, he found the
volumes generated by revolving the area about the axis of symmetry or
about the tangent at the vertex.</p>
<p>Robervaldidnotpublishhisdiscoveriesconcerningthecycloid(whichhe named
the “trochoid,” from the Greek word for “wheel”), for he may have wished
to set similar questions for prospective candidates for his chair. As
noted previously, this gave Torricelli the priority of publication.
Roberval thought of a point P on the cycloid as subject to two equal
motions, one a

along the baseline AB (Fig. 15.9), P is carried horizontally, at the

therefore draws a horizontal linePS, for the motion of translation, and
a line PRtangent to the generating circle, for the rotary component.

<h4 id="girard-desargues-and-projective-geometry">Girard Desargues and
Projective Geometry</h4>
<p>The great developments in mathematics during the days of Descartes
and Fermat were in analytic geometry and infinitesimal analysis. It is
likely that the very success in these branches made men of the time
relatively oblivious to other aspects of mathematics. We already have
seen that Fermat found no one to share his fascination with the theory
of numbers; pure geometry likewise suffered a wholly undeserved neglect
in the same period. The Conics of Apollonius had once been among
Fermat’s favorite works, but analytic methods redirected his views.
Meanwhile, the Conics had attracted the attention of a practical man
with a very impractical imagination—Girard Desargues, an architect and a
military engineer of Lyons. For some years, Desargues had been in Paris,
where he was part of the group of mathematicians that we have been
considering, but his very unorthodox views on the role of perspective in
architecture and geometry met with little favor, and he returned to
Lyons to work out his new type of mathematics largely by himself. The
result was one of the most unsuccessful great books ever produced. Even
the ponderous title repelled—Brouillon projet d’une atteinte aux
e´ve´nemens des rencontres d’un cone avec un plan (Paris, 1639). This
may be translated as Rough Draft of an Attempt to Deal with the Outcome
of a Meeting of a Cone with a Plane, the prolixity of which stands in
sharp contrast to the brevity and simplicity of Apollonius’s title
Conics. The thought on which Desargues’ work is based, nevertheless, is
simplicity itself—a thought derived from perspective in Renaissance art
and from Kepler’s principle of continuity. Everyone knows that a circle,
when viewed obliquely, looks like an ellipse or that the outline of the
shadow of a lampshade will be a circle or a hyperbola according as it is
projected on the ceiling or a wall. Shapes and sizes change according to
the plane</p>
<p>Girar d D e s ar gue s and P r oje c t i v e Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>of incidence that cuts the cone of visual rays or of light rays, but
certain properties remain the same throughout such changes, and it is
these properties that Desargues studied. For one thing, a conic section
remains a conic section no matter how many times it undergoes a
projection. The conics form a single close-knit family, as Kepler had
suggested for somewhat different reasons. But in accepting this view,
Desargues had to assume, with Kepler, that the parabola has a focus “at
infinity” and that parallel lines meet at “a point at infinity.” The
theory of perspective makes such ideas plausible, for light from the sun
is ordinarily considered to be made up of rays that are
parallel—composing a cylinder or a parallel pencil of rays—whereas rays
from a terrestrial light source are treated as a cone or a point
pencil.</p>
<p>Desargues’ treatment of the conics is beautiful, although his
language is unconventional. He called a conic section a “coup de
rouleau” (i.e., incidence with a rolling pin). About the only one of his
many new terms that has survived is the word “involution”—that is, pairs
of points on a line the
productofwhosedistancesfromafixedpointisagivenconstant.Hecalled
pointsinharmonicdivisionafour-pointinvolution,andheshowedthatthis
configuration is projectively invariant, a result known, under a
different point of view, to Pappus. Because of its harmonic properties,
the complete quadrangle played a large role in Desargues’ treatment, for
he knew that
whensuchaquadrangle(asABCDinFig.15.10)isinscribedinaconic,the line
through two of the diagonal points (E, F, and G in Fig. 15.10) is the
polarline,withrespecttotheconic,ofthethirddiagonalpoint.Heknew,of
course, that the intersections with the conic of the polar of a point
with respect to the conic were the points of contact of the tangents
from the point to the conic, and instead of defining a diameter
metrically, Desargues introduced it as the polar of a point at infinity.
There is a pleasing unity in Desargues’ treatment of the conics through
projective methods, but it was too thorough a break with the past to
meet with acceptance.</p>
<p>Desargues’ projective geometry had a tremendous advantage in
generality over the metric geometry of Apollonius, Descartes, and
Fermat, for many special cases of a theorem blend into one
all-inclusive</p>
<p>statement. Yet mathematicians of the time not only failed to accept
the methods of the new geometry, they actively opposed them as dangerous
and unsound. So rare were copies of Desargues’ Brouillon projet that by
the end of the century, all copies had disappeared, for Desargues
published his works not to sell but to distribute to friends. The work
was completely lost until in 1847, a handwritten copy made by Philippe
de Lahire, one of Desargues’ few admirers, was found in a Paris library.
Even today, the name of Desargues is familiar not as that of the author
of the Brouillon projet but for a proposition that does not appear in
the book, the famous theorem of Desargues:</p>
<p>If two triangles are so situated that lines joining pairs of
corresponding vertices are concurrent, then the points of intersection
of pairs of corresponding sides are collinear, and conversely.</p>
<p>This theorem, which holds for either two or three dimensions, was
first published in 1648 by Desargues’ devoted friend and follower
Abraham Bosse (1602 1676),anengraver.Itappears in a book withthe title
Maniere` universelle de S. Desargues, pour pratiquer la perspective. The
theorem, which Bosse explicitly attributed to Desargues, became, in the
nineteenth century, one of the fundamental propositions of projective
geometry. Note that whereas in three dimensions the theorem is an easy
consequence of incidence axioms, the proof for two dimensions requires
an additional assumption.</p>
<h4 id="blaise-pascal">Blaise Pascal</h4>
<p>Desargues was the prophet of projective geometry, but he went without
honor in his day, largely because his most promising disciple, Blaise
Pascal, abandoned mathematics for theology. Pascal was a mathematical
prodigy. His father, too, was mathematically inclined, and the “limac¸on
of Pascal” is named for the father, E´tienne, rather than for the son,
Blaise. The limac¸on r5a1bcosθ had been known to Jordanus</p>
<p>Nemorarius and possibly to the ancients as “the conchoid of the
circle,” but E´tienne Pascal studied the curve so thoroughly that on the
suggestion of Roberval, it has ever since borne his name.</p>
<p>When he was fourteen, Blaise joined with his father in the informal
meetings of the Mersenne Academy at Paris. Here he became familiar with
the ideas of Desargues; two years later, in 1640, the young Pascal, then
sixteen years old, published an Essay pour les coniques. This consisted
of only a single printed page—but one of the most fruitful pages in
history. It contained the proposition described by the author as
mysterium hexagrammicum, which has ever since been known as Pascal’s
theorem. This states, in essence, that the opposite sides of a</p>
<p>Blai s e Pa s c al</p>
<p>hexagon inscribed in a conic intersect in three collinear points.
Pascal did not state the theorem in this way, for it is not true unless,
as in the case of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, one resorts
to the ideal points and line of projective geometry. Instead, he
followed the special language of Desargues, saying that if A, B, C, D,
E, and F are successive vertices of a hexagon in a conic, and if P is
the intersection point of AB and DE and Q is the point of intersection
of BC and EF (Fig. 15.11), then PQ and CD and FA are lines “of the same
order” (or, as we should say, the lines are members of a pencil, whether
a point pencil or a parallel pencil). The young Pascal went on to say
that he had deduced many corollaries from this theorem, including the
construction of the tangent to a conic at a point on the conic. The
inspiration for the little Essay was candidly admitted, for, after
citing a theorem of Desargues, the young author wrote, “I should like to
say that I owe the little that I have found on this subject to his
writings.”</p>
<p>The Essay was an auspicious opening for a mathematical career, but
Pascal’smathematicalinterestswerechameleonlike.Henextturned,when he was
about eighteen, to plans for an adding machine, and within a few years,
he had built and sold some fifty machines (see the illustration on page
293, chapter 14). Then, in 1648, Pascal became interested in
hydrostatics,andtheresults werethecelebratedPuy-de-Doˆmeexperiment
confirming the weight of the air and the experiments on fluid pressure
that clarified the hydrostatic paradox. In 1654, he returned again to
mathematics and worked on two unrelated projects. One of these was to be
a Complete Work on Conics, evidently a continuation of the little Essay
he had published when sixteen, but this larger work on conics was never
printedandisnotnowextant.Leibnizsawamanuscriptcopy,andthenotes that he
took are now all that we have of Pascal’s larger work on conics. (Only
two copies of the smaller work have survived.) According to Leibniz’s
notes, the Complete Work on Conics contained a section on the</p>
<p>familiar three- and four-line locus and a section on the magna
problema— to place a given conic on a given cone of revolution.</p>
<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>While Pascal in 1654 was working on his Conics, his friend the
Chevalier de Mer´ e raised with him questions such as the following: In
eight throws´ of a die, a player is to attempt to throw a 1, but after
three unsuccessful trials, the game is interrupted. How should he be
indemnified? Pascal wrote to Fermat on this, and their resulting
correspondence became the effective starting point for the modern theory
of probability, the thoughts of Cardan of a century earlier having been
overlooked. Although neither Pascal nor Fermat wrote up their results,
Christiaan Huygens in 1657 published a little tract, De ratiociniis in
ludo aleae (On Reasoning in Games of Dice), that was prompted by the
correspondence of the Frenchmen. Pascal, meanwhile, had connected the
study of probability with the arithmetic triangle, carrying the
discussion so far beyond the work of Cardan that the triangular
arrangement has ever since been known as Pascal’s triangle. The triangle
itself was more than 600 years old, but Pascal disclosed some new
properties, such as the following:</p>
<p>In every arithmetic triangle, if two cells are contiguous in the same
base, the upper is to the lower as the number of cells from the upper to
the top of the base is to the number of those from the lower to the
bottom inclusive.</p>
<p>(Pascal called positions in the same vertical column, in Fig. 15.12,
“cells of the same perpendicular rank,” and those in the same horizontal
row “cells of the same parallel rank”; cells in the same upward-sloping
diagonal he called “cells of the same base.”) The method of proof of
this property is of more significance than the property itself, for here
in 1654 Pascal gave an eminently clear-cut explanation of the method of
mathematical induction.</p>

<p>Blai s e Pa s c al</p>
<p>Fermat hoped to interest Pascal in the theory of numbers, and in
1654, he sent him a statement of one of his most beautiful theorems
(unproved until the nineteenth century):</p>
<p>Every integer is composed of one, two, or three triangular numbers,
of one, two, three, or four squares, of one, two, three, four, or five
pentagons, of one, two, three, four, five, or six hexagons, and thus to
infinity.</p>
<p>Pascal, however, was a mathematical dilettante, as well as a
virtuoso, and did not pursue this problem.</p>
<p>The Cycloid</p>
<p>On the night of November 23, 1654, from ten thirty to about twelve
thirty, Pascal experienced a religious ecstasy that caused him to</p>
<p>Pascal’s triangle in Japan. From Murai Chuzen’s Sampo Doshi mon
(1781), also showing the sangi forms of the numerals.</p>
<p>abandon science and mathematics for theology. The result was the
writing of the Lettres provinciales and the Pense´es; for only one brief
period, in 1658 1659, did Pascal return to mathematics. One night in
1658, toothache or illness prevented him from falling asleep, and as a
distraction from the pain, he turned to the study of the cycloid.
Miraculously, the pain eased, and Pascal took this as a sign from God
that the study of mathematics was not displeasing to Him. Having found
certain areas, volumes, and centers of gravity associated with the
cycloid, Pascal proposed half a dozen such questions to the
mathematicians of his day, offering first and second prizes for their
solution—and naming Roberval as one of the judges. Publicity and timing
were so poor that only two sets of solutions were submitted, and these
contained at least some errors in computation. Pascal therefore awarded
no prize, but he did publish his own solutions, along with other
results, all preceded by a Histoire de la roulette (the name usually
used for the curve in France), in a series of Lettres de A. Dettonville
(1658 1659). (The name Amos Dettonville was an anagram of Louis de
Montalte, the pseudonym used in the Lettres provinciales.) The contest
questions and the Lettres de A. Dettonville brought interest in the
cycloid to a focus, but they also stirred up a hornets’ nest of
controversy. The two finalists, Antoine de Lalouvere and John Wallis,`
both capable mathematicians, were disgruntled that prizes were withheld,
and the Italian mathematicians were indignant that Pascal’s History of
the Cycloid gave virtually no credit to Torricelli, priority in
discovery being conceded only to Roberval.</p>
<p>Much of the material in the Lettres de A. Dettonville, such as the
equality of the arcs of spirals and parabolas, as well as the cycloid
contest questions, had been known to Roberval and Torricelli, but some
of this appeared in print for the first time. Among the new results was
the equality of the arc length of an arch of the generalized cycloid
x5aKφ2asinφ, y5a2acosφ and the semicircumference of the ellipse
x52a(11K)cosφ, y52a(l2K)sinφ. The theorem was expressed rhetorically,
rather than symbolically, and it was demonstrated in an essentially
Archimedean manner, as were most of Pascal’s demonstrations in 1658
1659.</p>
<p>In connection with an integration of the sine function in his 1658
Traite´ des sinus du quart de cercle (Treatise on the Sines of a
Quadrant of a Circle), Pascal came remarkably close to a discovery of
the calculus—so close that Leibniz later wrote that it was on reading
this work by Pascal that a light suddenly burst on him. Had Pascal not
died, like Torricelli, shortly after his thirty-ninth birthday, or had
he been more single-mindedly the mathematician or had he been more
attracted by algorithmic methods than by geometry and speculations on
the philosophy of mathematics, there is little doubt that he would have
anticipated Newton and Leibniz in their greatest discovery.</p>
<p>P hilipp e de L ahir e</p>
<h4 id="philippe-de-lahire">Philippe de Lahire</h4>
<p>With the death of Desargues in 1661, of Pascal in 1662, and of Fermat
in</p>
<p>1665, a great period in French mathematics came to a close. It is
true that Roberval lived about another decade, but his contributions
were no longer significant, and his influence was limited by his refusal
to publish. About the only mathematician of stature in France at the
time was Philippe de Lahire (1640 1718), a disciple of Desargues and,
like his master, an architect. Pure geometry obviously appealed to him,
and his first work on
conicsin1673wassynthetic,buthedidnotbreakwiththeanalyticwaveof the
future. Lahire kept an eye out for a patron; hence, in his Nouveaux

proceeding, in the case of the ellipse and the hyperbola, from the
definitions in terms of the sum and the difference of focal radii and,
in the case of the parabola, from the equality of distances to focus and

Desargues’ language. Of his analytic language, only the term “origin”
has survived. Perhaps it was because of his terminology that
contemporaries did not give proper weight to a significant point in his
Nouveaux e´le´mens— Lahire provided one of the first examples of a

referencepointororiginOonasinglelineofreferenceoraxisOB,towhich he now
added the reference or coordinate plane OBA (Fig. 15.13). Lahire found
that then the equation of the locus of a point P such that its
perpendicular distance PB from the axis shall exceed the distance OB
(the abscissaofP)byafixedquantitya,withrespecttohiscoordinatesystem,is
a2 12ax1x2 5y2 1v2 (where v is the coordinate that is now generally
designated by z). The locus is, of course, a cone.</p>
<p>In 1685, Lahire returned to synthetic methods in a book with the
simple title Sectiones Conicae. This might be described as a version by
Lahire of the Greek Conics of Apollonius translated into Latin from the
French</p>
<p>language of Desargues. The harmonic properties of the complete
quadrangle, poles and polars, tangents and normals, and conjugate
diameters are among the familiar topics treated from a projective point
of view.</p>
<p>Today, Lahire’s name is attached not to anything in his synthetic or
analytic treatises on conics, but to a theorem from a paper of 1706 on
“roulettes” in the Me´moires of the Academie des Sciences. Here he´
showed that if a smaller circle rolls without slipping along the inside
of a larger circle with a diameter twice as great, then (1) the locus of
a point on the circumference of the smaller circle is a line segment (a
diameter of the larger circle), and (2) the locus of a point that is not
on the circumference but that is fixed with respect to the smaller
circle is an ellipse. As we have seen, the first part of this theorem
was known to al-Tusi (Nasir Eddin) and the second to Copernicus. The
name of Lahire deserves to be remembered, but it is a pity that it
should be attached to a theorem that he was not first to discover.</p>
<h4 id="georg-mohr">Georg Mohr</h4>
<p>Lahire was not the only geometer of the time to be unappreciated. In
1672, the Danish mathematician Georg Mohr (1640 1697) published an
unusual book titled Euclides danicus, in which he showed that any
pointwise construction that can be performed with compasses and
straightedge (i.e., any “plane” problem) can be carried out with
compasses alone. Despite all of the insistence by Pappus, Descartes, and
others on the principle of parsimony, many of the classical
constructions were shown by Mohr to have violated this principle through
the use of two instruments where one would suffice! Obviously, one
cannot draw a straight line with compasses, but if one regards the line
as known whenever two distinct points on it are known, then the use of a
straightedge in Euclidean geometry is superfluous. So little attention
did mathematicians of the time pay to this amazing discovery that
geometry using compasses only, without the straightedge, bears the name
not of Mohr but of Lorenzo Mascheroni, who rediscovered the principle
125 years later. Mohr’s book disappeared so thoroughly that not until
1928, when a copy was accidentally found by a mathematician browsing in
a Copenhagen bookstore, did it become known that Mascheroni had been
anticipated in proving the supererogation of the straightedge.</p>
<h4 id="pietro-mengoli">Pietro Mengoli</h4>
<p>The year of Mohr’s stillborn Euclides danicus, 1672, marked the
publication in Italy of yet another work on circle-squaring, Il
problema</p>
<p>F rans van S c ho o t en</p>
<p>della quadratura del circolo, by Pietro Mengoli (1625 1686), a third
unappreciated mathematician of the time. Mengoli, a clergyman, had grown
up under the influence of Cavalieri (whose successor he was at Bologna),
Torricelli, and Gregory of St. Vincent. Continuing their work on
indivisibles and the area under hyperbolas, Mengoli learned how to
handle such problems through a device the usefulness of which now began
to be apparent almost for the first time—the use of infinite series.
Mengoli saw, for example, that the sum of the alternating harmonic
series 2121 1ð21nÞ=n1 is ln2. He had rediscovered</p>
<p>Oresme’s conclusion, arrived at by a grouping of terms, that the
ordinary harmonic series does not converge, a theorem usually attributed
to Jacques Bernoulli in 1689; he also showed the convergence of the
reciprocals of the triangular numbers, a result for which Huygens is
usually given credit.</p>
<p>We have considered three unappreciated mathematicians working in the
1670s, and one reason they were not adequately recognized was that the
center of mathematics was not in their countries. France and Italy, once
the leaders, were mathematically in decline, and Denmark remained
outside the main current. During the period that we are considering—the
interval between Descartes and Fermat, on the one hand, and Newton and
Leibniz, on the other—there were two regions in particular where
mathematics was thriving: Great Britain and the Low Countries. Here we
find not isolated figures, as in France, Italy, and Denmark, but a
handful of prominent Britons and another handful of Dutch and Flemish
mathematicians.</p>
<h4 id="frans-van-schooten">Frans van Schooten</h4>
<p>We have already noted that Descartes had spent a score of years in
Holland, and his mathematical influence was decisive, in that analytic
geometry took root there more quickly than elsewhere in Europe. At
Leyden in 1646, Frans van Schooten (1615 1660) had succeeded his father
as professor of mathematics, and it was chiefly through the younger Van
Schooten and his pupils that the rapid development of Cartesian geometry
took place. Descartes’ La ge´ome´trie had not originally been published
in Latin, the universal language of scholars, and the exposition had
been far from clear; both of these handicaps were overcome when Van
Schooten printed a Latin version in 1649, together with supplementary
material. Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes (Geometry by
Rene´ Descartes) appeared in a greatly expanded two-volume version in
1659 1661, and additional editions were published in 1683 and 1695.
Thus, it is probably not too much to say that although analytic geometry
was introduced by Descartes, it was established by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>The need for explanatory introductions to Cartesian geometry had been
recognized so promptly that an anonymous “Introduction” to it had been
composed but not published by a “Dutch gentleman” within a year of its
appearance. In another year, Descartes received and approved a more
extensive commentary on the Geometry, this one by Florimond Debeaune
under the title Notae Breves. The ideas of Descartes were here
explained, with greater emphasis on loci represented by simple
second-degree equations, much in the manner of Fermat’s Isagoge.
Debeaune showed, for example, that y2 5xy1bx, y2 522dy1bx, and y2 5bx2x2
represent hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipses, respectively. This work
by Debeaune
receivedwidepublicitythroughitsinclusioninthe1649Latintranslationof the
Geometria, together with further commentary by Van Schooten.</p>
<p>Jan deWitt</p>
<p>A more extensive contribution to analytic geometry was composed in
1658 by one of Van Schooten’s associates, Jan De Witt (1629 1672), the
well-known Grand Pensionary of Holland. De Witt had studied law at
Leyden, but he had acquired a taste for mathematics while living in Van
Schooten’s house. He led a hectic life while directing the affairs of
the United Provinces through periods of war in which he opposed the
designs of Louis XIV. When in 1672 the French invaded the Netherlands,
De Witt was dismissed from office by the Orange Party and seized by an
infuriated mob that tore him to pieces. Although he had been a man of
action, he had found the time in his earlier years to compose a work
titled Elementa Curvarum. This is divided into two parts, the first of
which gives various kinematic and planimetric definitions of the conic
sections. Among these are the focus-directrix ratio definitions; our
word “directrix” is due to him. Another construction of the ellipse that
he gave is through the now familiar use of two concentric circles with
the eccentric angle as parameter. Here the treatment is largely
synthetic, but Book II, by contrast, makes such systematic use of
coordinates that it has been described, with some justification, as the
first textbook on analytic geometry. The purpose of De Witt’s work is to
reduce all second-degree equations in x and y to canonical form through
translation and rotation of axes. He knew how to recognize when such an
equation represented an ellipse, when a parabola, and when a hyperbola,
based on whether the so-called discriminant is negative, zero, or
positive.</p>
<p>Only a year before his tragic death, De Witt combined the aims of the
statesman with the views of a mathematician in his A Treatise on Life
Annuities (1671), motivated perhaps by the little essay by Huygens on
probabilities. In this Treatise, De Witt expressed what now would be
described as the notion of mathematical expectation, and in his
correspondence with Hudde, he considered the problem of an annuity based
on the last survivor of two or more people.</p>
<h4 id="johann-hudde">Johann Hudde</h4>
<h4 id="johann-hudde-1">Johann Hudde</h4>
<p>In 1656 1657, Van Schooten had published a work of his own,
Exercitationes Mathematicae, in which he gave new results in the
application of algebra to geometry. Included are also discoveries made
by his most capable disciples, such as Johann Hudde (1629 1704), a
patrician who served for some thirty years as burgomaster of Amsterdam.
Hudde corresponded with Huygens and De Witt on the maintenance of canals
and on problems of probability and life expectancy; in 1672, he directed
the work of inundating Holland to obstruct the advance of the French
army. In 1656, Hudde had written on the quadrature of the hyperbola by
means of infinite series, as had Mengoli, but the manuscript has been
lost. In Van Schooten’s Exercitationes, there is a section by Hudde on a
study of coordinates of a fourth-degree surface, an anticipation of
solid analytic geometry antedating even that of Lahire, although less
explicitly described. Moreover, it appears that Hudde was the first
mathematician to permit a literal coefficient in an equation to
represent any real number, whether positive or negative. This final step
in the process of generalizing the notations of Viete in the theory of
equations was made in a work by` Hudde titled De Reductione Aequationum,
which also formed part of the 1659 1661 Van Schooten edition of
Descartes’ La ge´ome´trie.</p>
<p>The two most popular subjects in Hudde’s day were analytic geometry
and mathematical analysis, and the burgomaster-to-be contributed to
both. In 1657 1658, Hudde had discovered two rules that pointed clearly
toward algorithms of the calculus:</p>
<p>1.If r is a double root of the polynomial equation</p>
<p>a0xn 1a1xn 1 1 1an 1x1an 50</p>
<p>and if b0, b1, … , bn 1, bn are numbers in arithmetic progression,
then r is also a root of</p>
<p>a0b0xn 1a1b1xn 1 1 1an 1bn 1x1anbn 50:</p>
<p>2.If for x5a the polynomial</p>
<p>a0xn 1a1xn 1 1 1an 1x1an</p>
<p>takes on a relative maximum or minimum value, then a is a root of the
equation: na0xn 1ðn21Þa1xn 1 1 12an 2x2 1an 1x50:</p>
<p>The first of these “Hudde’s rules” is a camouflaged form of the
modern theorem that if r is a double root of f(x)50, then r is also a
root of f u(x)50. The second is a slight modification of Fermat’s
theorem that today appears in the form that if f(a) is a relative
maximum or minimum value of a polynomial f(x), then f u(a)50.</p>
<p>Rene Fran´ cois de Sluse¸</p>
<p>The rules of Hudde were widely known, for they were published by Van
Schooten in 1659 in Volume I of Geometria a Renato Des Cartes. A few
years earlier, a similar rule for tangents had been used by another
representative from the Low Countries, the canon Rene Franc¸ois de
Sluse´ (1622 1685), a native of Liege who came from a distinguished
Walloon` family. He had studied in Lyons and Rome, where he may have
become familiar with the work of Italian mathematicians. Possibly
through Torricelli, perhaps independently, in 1652 Sluse arrived at a
routine for finding the tangent to a curve whose equation is of the form
f(x, y)50, where f is a polynomial. The rule, not published until 1673,
when it appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,
may be stated as follows: The subtangent will be the quotient obtained
by placing in the numerator all of the terms containing y, each
multiplied by the exponent of the power of y appearing in it, and
placing in the denominator all of the terms containing it, each
multiplied by the exponent of the power of x appearing in it and then
divided by x. This is, of course, equivalent to forming the quotient now
written as yfy /fx, a result also known to Hudde in about 1659. Such
instances show how discoveries in the calculus were crowding on one
another even before the work of Newton.</p>
<p>Sluse, sharing in the tradition of the Low Countries, was also quite
active in promoting Cartesian geometry, even though he preferred the A
and E of VieteandFermattothe`
xandyofDescartes.In1659,hepublishedapopular book, Mesolabum (OfMeans),
in which he pursued the familiar topic onthe geometric constructions of
the rootsof equations. Heshowed thatgivenany conic, one can construct
the roots of any cubic or quartic equation through the intersection of
the conic and a circle. The name of Sluse is also attached to afamily
ofcurvesthatheintroducedin hiscorrespondencewithHuygens and Pascal in
1657 1658. These so-called pearls of Sluse, so named by Pascal, are
curves given by equations of the form ym 5kxn(a2x)b. Sluse mistakenly
thought that such cases as y5x2(a2x) were pearl-shaped, for, negative
coordinates not then being understood, Sluse assumed symmetry with
respect to the axis (of abscissas); however, Christiaan Huygens (1629
1695), who had the reputation of being Van Schooten’s best pupil, found
the maximum and minimum points and the point of inflection and was able
to sketch the curve correctly for both positive and negative
coordinates.Otherpointsofinflectionhadalsobeenfoundbyseveralmenbefore
Huygens, including Fermat and Roberval.</p>
<h4 id="christiaan-huygens">Christiaan Huygens</h4>
<p>Christiaan Huygens, a member of a prominent Dutch family and the son
of the diplomat Constantin Huygens, was encouraged in mathematical
pursuits as a youngster by both Descartes and Mersenne, who were</p>
<p>associates of his father’s. Christiaan became a scientist of
international reputation, who is recalled for the principle that bears
his name in the wave theory of light, the observation of the rings of
Saturn, and the effective invention of the pendulum clock. It was in
connection with his search for improvements in horology that he made his
most important mathematical discovery.</p>
<p>The Pendulum Clock</p>
<p>Huygens knew that the oscillations of a simple pendulum are not
strictly isochronous but depend on the magnitude of the swing. To phrase
it differently, if an object is placed on the side of a smooth
hemispherical bowl and released, the time it takes to reach the lowest
point will be almost, but not quite, independent of the height from
which it is released. Now it happened that Huygens invented the pendulum
clock at just about the time of the Pascal cycloid contest, in 1658, and
it occurred to him to consider what would happen if one were to replace
the hemispherical bowl with one whose cross-section is an inverted
cycloidal arch. Huygens was delighted to find that for such a bowl, the
object will</p>
<p>Diagrams from Huygens’s Horologium oscillatorium (1673). The one
labeled Fig. II shows the cycloidal jaws that caused the pendulum to
swing in a cycloidal arc.</p>
<p>reach the lowest point in exactly the same time, no matter what
height on the inner surface of the bowl the object is released from. The
cycloid curve is truly a tautochrone—that is, on an inverted cycloidal
arch an object will slide from any point to the bottom in exactly the
same time, no matter what the starting point. But a big question
remained: how does one get a pendulum to oscillate in a cycloidal,
rather than a circular, arc? Here Huygens made a further beautiful
discovery. If one suspends from a point P at the cusp between two
inverted cycloidal semiarches PQ and PR (Fig. 15.14) a pendulum the
length of which is equal to the length of one of the semiarches, the
pendulum bob will swing in an arc that is an arch of a cycloid QSR of
exactly the same size and shape as the cycloid of which arcs PQ and PR
are parts. In other words, if the pendulum of the clock oscillates
between cycloidal jaws, it will be truly isochronous.</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>Huygens made some pendulum clocks with cycloidal jaws, but he found
that in operation, they were no more accurate than those depending on
the oscillations of an ordinary simple pendulum, which are nearly
isochronous for very small swings. Yet in this investigation, Huygens
had made a discovery of capital mathematical significance: the involute
of a cycloid is a similar cycloid, or, inversely, the evolute of a
cycloid is a similar cycloid. This theorem and further results on
involutes and evolutes for other curves were proved by Huygens in an
essentially Archimedean and Fermatian manner by taking neighboring
points and noting the result when the interval vanishes. Descartes and
Fermat had used this device for normals and tangents to a curve, and now
Huygens applied it to find what we call the radius of curvature of a
plane curve. If at neighboring points P and Q on a curve (Fig. 15.15)
one finds the normals and their point of intersection I, then, as Q
approaches P along the curve, the variable point I tends toward a fixed
point O, which is called the center of curvature of the curve for the
point P, and the distance OP is known as the radius of curvature. The
locus of the centers of curvature O for points P on a given curve Ci lie
on a second curve Ce known as the evolute of C, and any curve Ci of
which</p>
<p>Ce is the evolute is called an involute of the curve Ce. It is clear
that the envelope of the normals to Ci, will be Ce, a curve tangent to
each of the normals. In Fig. 15.14, the curve QPR is the evolute of the
curve QSR and the curve QSR is an involute of the curve QPR. The
positions of the string, as the pendulum bob swings back and forth, are
the normals to QSR and the tangents to QPR. As the pendulum bob moves
farther to one side, the string winds more and more about the cycloidal
jaw, and as the bob falls toward the lowest point S, the string unwinds.
Hence, Huygens described the cycloid QSR as ex evolutione descripta, the
cycloid QPR being the evoluta. (In French, the terms de´veloppante and
d´eveloppe´e have since been adopted.)</p>
<p>Involutes and Evolutes</p>
<p>The concepts of radius of curvature and evolute had been adumbrated
in Apollonius’s purely theoretical work on Conics, but only with
Huygens’s interest in horology did the concepts find a permanent place
in mathematics. Analytic geometry had been a product of essentially
theoretical considerations, but Huygens’s development of the idea of
curvature was prompted by practical concerns. An interplay of the two
points of view, the theoretical and the practical, often proves to be
fruitful in mathematics, as the work of Huygens aptly illustrates. His
cycloidal pendulum presented him with an obvious rectification of the
cycloid, a result that Roberval had found earlier but had not published.
The fact that the arc QS (in Fig. 15.14) is formed as the pendulum
string winds about the curve QP shows that the length of the line PS is
exactly equal to the length of the arc QP. Inasmuch as the line PS is
twice the diameter of the circle that generates the cycloid QSR, the
length of a complete arch of the cycloid must be four times the diameter
of the generating circle. The theory of involutes and evolutes similarly
led to the rectification of many other curves, and the
Peripatetic-Cartesian dogma of the nonrectifiability of algebraic curves
came more seriously into question.</p>
<p>In 1658, one of Huygens’s associates, Heinrich van Heuraet (1633
1660?), also a proteg´ e of Van Schooten’s, discovered that the´
semicubical parabola ay2 5x3 can be rectified by Euclidean means, thus
ending the uncertainty. The disclosure appeared in 1659 as one of the
more important aspects of Van Schooten’s Geometria a Renato Des Cartes.
This result had been reached independently a little earlier by the
Englishman William Neil (1637 1670) and was known independently a little
later to Fermat in France, constituting another striking case of virtual
simultaneity of discovery. Of all of Fermat’s discoveries in
mathematics, it was only the rectification of the semicubical parabola,
usually known as Neil’s parabola, that was published by him. The
solution appeared in 1660 as a supplement in the Veterum Geometria
Promota in Septem de Cycloide Libris (Geometry of the Ancients Promoted
in Seven Books on the Cycloid) by Antoine de Lalouvere` (1600 1664), the
circle-squarer who had striven for Pascal’s prize. The rectification of
Fermat was found by comparing a small arc of a curve with the
circumscribed figure made up of tangents at the extremities of the arc.
Van Heuraet’s method was based on the rate of change in the arc,
expressed in modern notation by the equation The rectification by Neil
depended on the recognition, already noted byp ð Þ2 ds=dx5 11 y0 .</p>
<p>Wallis in Arithmetica infinitorum, that a small arc is virtually the
hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are the increments in the
abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the equivalent of the modern
formula ds5pdx2 1dy2. Neil’s rectification was published in 1659 by John
Wallis in a treatise titled Tractatus Duo, Prior de Cycloide, Posterior
de Cissoide (Two Treatises, the First on the Cycloid, the Second on the
Cissoid). This work followed by a few months the work of Pascal on the
cycloid, indicating the extent to which cycloid fever had seized
mathematicians just before the invention of the calculus.</p>
<p>Huygens’s work on involutes and evolutes was not published until
1673, when it appeared in his celebrated Horologium Oscillatorium. This
treatise on pendulum clocks is a classic that served as an introduction
to Newton’s Principia a little more than a decade later. It contained
the law of centripetal force for circular motion, Huygens’s law for
pendular motion, the principle of the conservation of kinetic energy,
and other important results in mechanics. During his entire life, he
maintained a broad interest in all things mathematical but especially in
higher plane curves. He rectified the cissoid and studied the tractrix.
Whereas Galileo had thought that the catenary was a parabola, Huygens
showed that it is a nonalgebraic curve. In 1656, he had applied
infinitesimal analysis to the conics, reducing the rectification of the
parabola to the quadrature of the hyperbola (that is, to finding a
logarithm). By the next year, Huygens had become the first one to find
the surface area of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution (the
“conoid” of Archimedes), showing that the complanation can be achieved
by elementary means.</p>
<p>Van Schooten died in 1660, the year in which the Royal Society was
founded in England, and the date can be taken as marking a new shift in
the mathematical center of the world. The Leyden group, gathered about
Van Schooten, was losing its momentum, and it suffered a further blow
when Huygens left for Paris in 1666. Meanwhile, a vigorous development
in mathematics had been taking place in Great Britain; this was further
encouraged by the formation of the Royal Society, which, granted its
charter in 1662, has run its prestigious course for 350 years.</p>

<p>Isaac Barrow</p>
<p>JohnWallis</p>
<p>One of the charter members of the Royal Society, John Wallis (1616
1703) was known amongoldercontemporaries asa
brilliantstudentofmathematics and among later historians as the most
influential English predecessor of Newton. Wallis, like Oughtred,
entered Holy Orders, yet he spent most of his time as a mathematician.
Educated at Cambridge, he was appointed Savilian professor of geometry
at Oxford in 1649, holding the chair that had first been filled by
Briggs when it was established in 1619. Wallis was known to be a
Royalist, although the regime of Cromwell was not averse to using his
services in the deciphering of secret codes, and when Charles II was
restored to the throne, Wallis became the king’s chaplain. Earlier, in
1655, he had published two very important books, one in analytic
geometry, the other in infinite analysis. These were the two leading
branches of mathematics at the time, and the genius of Wallis was well
suited to advance them.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>John Walli s</p>
<p>On Conic Sections</p>
<p>The Tractatus de Sectionibus Conicis of Wallis did for analytic
geometry in England what De Witt’s Elementa Curvarum had done for the
subject on the Continent. Wallis complained, in fact, that De Witt’s
work was an imitation of his own Tractatus, but De Witt’s treatise,
although published four years after that of Wallis, had actually been
composed before 1655. The books of both men may be described as the
completion of the arithmetization of conic sections that had been begun
by Descartes. Wallis, in particular, replaced geometric concepts by
numerical ones wherever possible. Even proportion, the stronghold of
ancient geometry, Wallis held to be an arithmetic concept.</p>
<p>The Conics of Wallis opened by paying lip service to the generation
of the curves as sections of a cone, yet the author deduced all of the
familiar properties through plane coordinate methods from the three
standard forms e2 5ld2ld2 /t, p2 5ld, and h2 5ld1ld2 /t, where e, p, and
h are the ordinates of the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola,
respectively, corresponding to abscissas d measured from a vertex at the
origin, and where l and t are the latus rectum and “diameter” or axis.
Later still, he took these equations as the definitions of the conic
sections, considered “absolutely,” that is, without reference to the
cone. Here, he was even closer than Fermat to the modern definition of a
conic as the locus of points on a plane coordinate system whose
coordinates satisfy an equation of the second degree in two variables, a
fact that Descartes had been aware of but that he had not
emphasized.</p>
<p>Arithmetica Infinitorum</p>
<p>Had Wallis’s Conics not appeared, the loss would not have been
serious, for De Witt’s work appeared only four years later. Yet there
was no substitute for the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis, which was
also published in 1655. Here, Wallis arithmetized the Geometria
indivisibilibus of Cavalieri, as he had arithmetized the Conics of
Apollonius. Whereas Cavalieri had arrived at the result</p>
<p>a m am11 x dx5</p>
<p>0 m11</p>
<p>through a laborious pairing of geometric indivisibles in a
parallelogram with those in one of the two triangles into which a
diagonal divides it, Wallis abandoned the geometric background after
having associated the infinitely many indivisibles in the figures with
numerical values. If, for example, one wishes to compare the squares of
the indivisibles in the triangle with the squares of the indivisibles in
the parallelogram, one takes the length of the first indivisible in the
triangle as zero, the second as 1, the third as 2, and so on, up to the
last, of length n21, if there are n indivisibles. The ratio of the
squares of the indivisibles in the two figures would then be</p>
<p>02 112 1 1 1</p>
<p>2 2 or 5 1</p>
<p>1 11 2 3 6</p>
<p>if there were only two indivisibles in each, or</p>
<p>02 112 122 5 1 1</p>
<p>5 5 1</p>
<p>if there were three, or</p>
<p>02 112 122 132 14 1 1</p>
<p>22 2 2 5 5 1</p>
<p>313 13 13 36 3 18</p>
<p>if there were four. For n11 indivisibles, the result is</p>
<p>02 1212 1222 12 1ðn221Þ2 12 n2 1 1</p>
<p>5 1 ;</p>
<p>n 1n 1n 1 1n 1n 3 6n</p>
<p>and if n is infinite, the ratio obviously is . (For n infinite, the
remainder term l/6n becomes l/N, or zero. Here, Wallis was the first one
to use the now familiar “love knot” symbol for infinity.) This is, of
course, the equivalent of saying that 10x2dx5; Wallis extended the same
procedure to higher integral powers of xÐ. By incomplete induction, he
concluded that</p>
<p>1 m 1 x dx5</p>
<p>0 m11</p>
<p>for all integral values of m.</p>
<p>Fermat rightly criticized Wallis’s induction, for it lacks the rigor
of the method of complete induction that Fermat and Pascal frequently
used. Moreover, Wallis followed a still more questionable principle of
interpolation, under which he assumed that his result also held for
fractional values of m, as well as for negative values (except m5 1). He
even had the hardihood to assume that the formula held for irrational
powers— the earliest statement in the calculus concerning what now would
be called “a higher transcendental function.” The use of exponential
notation for fractional and negative powers was an important
generalization of suggestions made earlier, as by Oresme and Stevin, but
Wallis did not give a sound basis for his extension of the Cartesian
exponentiation.</p>
<p>Wallis was a chauvinistic Englishman, and when he later (in 1685)
published his Treatise of Algebra, Both Historical and Practical, he
belittled the work of Descartes, arguing, very unfairly, that most of it
had been taken from Harriot’s Artis analyticae praxis. The fact that</p>
<p>John Walli s</p>
<p>Wallis’s solutions of the Pascal contest questions had been rejected
as not worthy of the prize evidently did not ameliorate his anti-Gallic
bias. This bias, as well as his casual interpretation of the historical
record, also seems to explain why Wallis, a far better mathematician
than historian, equated algebra (or the analytics of Vie`te) with the
ancient geometric analysis.</p>
<p>Christopher Wren and William Neil</p>
<p>At the time that Wallis sent in his reply to the Pascal challenge,
Christopher Wren (1632 1723) sent Pascal his rectification of the
cycloid. Wren was educated at Oxford and later held there the Savilian
professorship in astronomy. He, too, was elected to the Royal Society,
of which he was president for a few years. Had not the great fire of
1666 destroyed much of London, Wren might now be known as a
mathematician, rather than as the architect of St. Paul’s Cathedral and
some fifty other churches. The mathematical circle to which Wren and
Wallis belonged in 1657 1658 evidently was applying the equivalent of
the formula for arc length ds2 5dx2 1dy2 to various curves and was
meeting with brilliant success. We mentioned earlier that William Neil,
when he was only twenty years old, first succeeded in rectifying his
curve, the semicubical parabola, in 1657. Wren found the length of the
cycloid a year later. The rectification by Neil depended on the
recognition, already noted by Wallis in Arithmetica Infinitorum, that a
small arc is virtually the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides
are the increments in the abscissa and the ordinate—that is, on the
equivalent of the modern formula ds5pdx2 1dy2. Both Neil’s and Wren’s
discoveries were incorporated, with due credit to the discoverers, by
Wallis in his Tractatus Duo of 1659, a book on infinitesimal problems
related to the cycloid and the cissoid. This work followed by a few
months the work of Pascal on the cycloid, indicating the extent to which
cycloid fever had seized mathematicians just before the invention of the
calculus.</p>
<p>It is a pity that the geometry of surfaces and curves in three
dimensions was then attracting so little attention that almost a century
later, solid analytic geometry was still virtually undeveloped. Wallis,
in his Algebra of 1685, included a study of a surface that belonged to
the class now known as conoids (not, of course, in the Archimedean
sense). Wallis’s surface, which he called the “cono-cuneus” (or conical
wedge), can be described as follows: Let C be a circle, let L be a line
parallel to the plane of C, and let P be a plane perpendicular to L.
Then, the cono-cuneus is the totality of lines that are parallel to P
and pass through points of L and C. Wallis suggested other conoidal
surfaces obtained by replacing the circle C by a conic, and in his
Mechanica of 1670, he had noted the parabolic sections on Wren’s
hyperboloid (or “hyperbolic cylindroid”).</p>
<p>Yet Wallis did not give equations for the surfaces, nor did he
arithmetize geometry of three dimensions, as he had plane geometry.</p>
<p>Wallis’s Formulas</p>
<p>Wallis made his most important contributions in infinitesimal
analysis. Among these was one in which, while evaluating 10px2x2 dx, he
anticipatedsomeofEuler’sworkonthegammaorfactorialfunction.FromÐ the work
of Cavalieri, Fermat, and others, Wallis knew that this integral
represents the area under the semicircle y5px2x2 and that this area
therefore is π/8. But how can one obtain the answer through a direct
evaluationoftheintegralbyinfinitesimaldevices?Walliscouldnotanswer this
question, but his method of induction and interpolation produced an
interesting result. After an evaluation of Ð 102ðx2x2Þndx for several
positive integral values of n, Wallis arrived by incomplete induction at
the conclusion that the value of this integral is (n!) /(2n11)! Assuming
that the formula holds for fractional values of n as well, Wallis
concluded that</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>1p 2 ð Þ12 2</p>
<p>x2x dx5 ! =2!</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>hence, π=85ð12!Þ2 or !51 pmπ1=2: This is a special case of the
Euleriann 1 beta function, Bðm;nÞ5Ð 0x ð12xÞ dx; where m5 and n5.</p>
<p>Among Wallis’s best-known results is the infinite product</p>
<p>2 1U3U3U5U5U7</p>
<p>5 : π 2U2U4U4U6U6</p>
<p>This expression can readily be obtained from the modern theorem</p>
<p>π=2</p>
<p>sinnxdx</p>
<p>limn-Nπ=02 n11 51 sin xdx</p>
<p>0</p>
<p>and the formulas</p>
<p>π=2 m ðm21Þ!! sin xdx5</p>
<p>0 m!!</p>
<p>for m an odd integer and</p>
<p>π=2 m ðm21Þ!! π sin xdx5</p>
<p>0 m!! 2</p>
<p>Jame s Gr e gor y</p>
<p>for m even. (The symbol m!! represents the product m(m22)(m24) …,
which terminates in 1 or 2, according as m is odd or even.) Hence, the
previous expressions for 0π=2sinmxdx are known as Wallis’s formulas. Yet
the method that Wallis actually used to achieve his product for 2/Ð π
was in reality again based on his principles of induction and
interpolation, applied this time to 10p12x2dx, which he was unable to
evaluate directly for lack of the binomial theorem.Ð</p>
<h4 id="james-gregory">James Gregory</h4>
<p>The binomial theorem for integral powers had been known in Europe at
least since 1527, but Wallis was unable, surprisingly, to apply his
method of interpolation here. It looks as though this result may have
been known to the young Scotsman James Gregory (1638 1675), a
predecessor of Newton who died when he was only thirty-six. Gregory had
evidently come in contact with the mathematics of several countries. His
great-uncle Alexander Anderson (1582 1620?) had edited Vie`te’s works,
and James Gregory had studied mathematics not only at school in
Aberdeen, but also with his older brother, David Gregory (1627 1720). A
wealthy patron had introduced him to John Collins (1625 1683), the
librarian of the Royal Society. Collins was to British mathematicians
what Mersenne had been to the French a generation earlier—the
correspondent extraordinary. In 1663, Gregory went to Italy, where the
patron introduced him to the successors of Torricelli, especially
Stefano degli Angeli (1623 1697). The many works of Angeli, a prote´ge´
of Cardinal Michelangelo Ricci (1619 1682) who had been a close friend
of Torricelli’s, were almost all on infinitesimal methods, with emphasis
on the quadrature of generalized spirals, parabolas, and hyperbolas. It
is likely that it was in Italy that Gregory came to appreciate the power
of infinite series expansions of functions and of infinite processes in
general.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Quadratures</p>
<p>In 1667, Gregory published in Padua a work titled Vera circuli et
hyperbolae quadratura, which contained very significant results in
infinitesimal analysis. For one thing, Gregory extended the Archimedean
algorithm to the quadrature of ellipses and hyperbolas. He took an
inscribed triangle of area a0 and a circumscribed quadrilateral of area
A0; by successively doubling the number of sides of these figures, he
formed the sequence a0, A0, a1, A1, a2, A2, a3, A3,…and showed that an
is the geometric mean of the two terms immediately preceding and An the
harmonic mean of the two preceding terms. Thus, he had two
sequences—that of the inscribed areas and that of the circumscribed
areas—both converging to the area of the conic; he used these to get
very good approximations to elliptic and hyperbolic sectors.
Incidentally, the word “coverage” was here used by Gregory in this sense
for the first time. Through this infinite process, Gregory sought,
unsuccessfully, to prove the impossibility of squaring the circle by
algebraic means. Huygens, regarded as the leading mathematician of the
day, believed that π could be expressed algebraically, and a dispute
arose over the validity of Gregory’s methods. The question of π’s
transcendence was a difficult one, and it would be another two centuries
before it was resolved in Gregory’s favor.</p>
<p>Gregory’s Series</p>
<p>In 1668, Gregory published two more works, bringing together results
from France, Italy, Holland, and England, as well as new discoveries of
his own. One of these, Geometriae Pars Universalis (The Universal Part
of Geometry), was published in Padua; the other, Exercitationes
Geometricae (Geometrical Exercises), in London. As the title of the
first book implies, Gregory broke from the Cartesian distinction between
“geometrical” and “mechanical” curves. He preferred to divide
mathematics into “general” and “special” groups of theorems, rather than
into algebraic and transcendental functions. Gregory did not wish to
distinguish even between algebraic and geometric methods, and,
consequently, his work appeared in an essentially geometric garb that is
not easy to follow. Had he expressed his work analytically, he might
have anticipated Newton in the invention of the calculus, for virtually
all of the fundamental elements were known to him by the end of 1668. He
was thoroughly familiar with quadratures and rectifications and probably
saw that these are the inverses of tangent problems. He even knew the
equivalent of secxdx5ln(secx 1 tanx). He had independently found the
binomial theorem for fractional powers, a result known earlier toÐ
Newton (but as yet unpublished), and he had, through a process
equivalent to successive differentiation, discovered the Taylor series
more than forty years before Taylor published it. The Maclaurin series
for tan x and sec x and for arctan x and arcsec x were all known to him,
but only one of these, the series for arctan x, bears his name. He could
have learned in Italy that the area under the curve y51/(11x2), from x50
to x5x, is arctan x, and a simple long division converts 1/(11x2) to
12x2 1x4 2x6 1 . Hence, it is at once apparent from</p>
<p>Cavalieri’s formula that</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>x dx x3 x5 x7</p>
<p>2 5arctan x5x2 1 2 1 :</p>
<p>0 11x 3 5 7</p>
<p>This result is still known as “Gregory’s series.”</p>
<p>Nic olaus Merc at or and W illiam Br ounc ker</p>
<p>Nicolaus Mercator andWilliam Brouncker</p>
<p>Aresult somewhat analogous to Gregory’s series was derived at about
thesame time by Nicolaus Mercator (1620 1687) and published in his
Logarithmotechnia of 1668. Mercator (real name Kaufmann) was born in
Holstein in Denmark, but he lived in London for a long time and became
one of the first members of the Royal Society. In 1683, he went to
France and designed the fountains at Versailles; he died in Paris four
years later. The first part of Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia is on the
calculation of logarithms by methods stemming from those of Napier and
Briggs; the second part contains various approximation formulas for
logarithms, one of which is essentially that now known as “Mercator’s
series.” From the work of Gregory of St. Vincent, it had been known that
the area under the hyperbola y51/(11x), from x 5 0 to x5x, is ln(l1x).
Hence, using
JamesGregory’smethodoflongdivisionfollowedbyintegration,wehave</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>x dx x 2 3</p>
<p>5ð ð12x1x 2x 1 Þdx5lnð11xÞ</p>
<p>0 11x 0</p>
<p>x x2 x3 x4</p>
<p>5 2 1 2 1 :</p>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
<p>Mercator took over from Mengoli the name “natural logarithms” for
values that are derived by means of this series. Although the series
bears Mercator’s name, it appears that it was known earlier to both
Hudde and Newton, although not published by them.</p>
<p>During the 1650s and 1660s, a wide variety of infinite methods were
developed, including the infinite continued fraction method for π that
had been given by William Brouncker (1620? 1684), the first president of
the Royal Society. The first steps in continued fractions had been taken
many years prior to this in Italy, where Pietro Antonio Cataldi (1548
1626) of Bologna had expressed square roots in this form. Suchp
expressions are easily obtained as follows: Let 2 be desired and let
x115p2. Then, (x11)2 52 or x2 12x 5 1 or x 5 1/(21x). If, on the
right-hand side, one continues to replace x as often as it appears
by</p>
<p>1/(21x), one finds that</p>
<p>x 1 √–2 1.</p>
<p>2 . . .</p>
<p>Through manipulation of Wallis’s product for 2/π, Brouncker was led
somehow to the expression</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>2 . . .</p>
<p>In addition, Brouncker and Gregory found certain infinite series for
logarithms, but these were overshadowed by the greater simplicity of the
Mercator series. It is sad to report, however, that Gregory did not have
an influence commensurate with his achievement. He returned to Scotland
tobecomeaprofessorofmathematics,firstatSt.Andrewsin1668andthen at
Edinburgh in 1674, where he became blind and died a year later. After
histhreetreatisesof1667 1668hadappeared,henolongerpublished,and many of
his results had to be rediscovered by others.</p>
<h4 id="barrows-method-of-tangents">Barrow’s Method of Tangents</h4>
<p>Newton could have learned much from Gregory, but the young Cambridge
student evidently was not well acquainted with the work of the Scot.
Instead, it was two Englishmen, one at Oxford and the other at
Cambridge, who made a deeper impression on him. They were John Wallis
and Isaac Barrow (1630 1677). Barrow, like Wallis, entered Holy Orders
but taught mathematics. A mathematical conservative, Barrow disliked the
formalisms of algebra, and in this respect, his work is antithetical to
that of Wallis. He thought that algebra should be part of logic, rather
than of mathematics. An admirer of the ancients, he edited the works of
Euclid, Apollonius, and Archimedes, besides publishing his own Lectiones
opticae (1669) and Lectiones geometriae (1670), both of which Newton
assisted in editing. The date 1668 is important for the fact that Barrow
was giving his geometric lectures at the same time that Gregory’s
Geometriae Pars Universalis and Mercator’s Logarithmotechnia appeared,
as well as a revised edition of Sluse’s Mesolabum. Sluse’s book included
a new section dealing with infinitesimal problems and containing a
method of maxima and minima. Wishing his Lectiones Geometriae to take
account of the state of the subject at the time, Barrow included an
especially full account of the new discoveries. Tangent problems and
quadratures were all the rage, and they figure prominently in Barrow’s
1670 treatise. Here, Barrow preferred the kinematic views of Torricelli
to the static arithmetic of Wallis, and he liked to think of geometric
magnitudes as generated by a steady flow of points. Time, he said, has
many analogies with a line, yet he viewed both as made up of
indivisibles. Although his reasoning is much more like Cavalieri’s than
like Wallis’s or Fermat’s, there is one point at</p>
<p>Bar r o w ’s Me t ho d of Tangent s</p>
<p>which algebraic analysis obtrudes prominently. At the end of Lecture
X,</p>
<p>Barrow wrote,</p>
<p>Supplementary to this we add, in the form of appendices, a method for
finding tangents by calculation frequently used by us, although I hardly
know, after so many well-known and well-worn methods of the kind above,
whether there is any advantage in doing so. Yet I do so on the advice of
a friend 〔later shown to have been Newton〕; and all the more willingly
because it seems to be more profitable and general than those which I
have discussed.</p>
<p>Then Barrow went on to explain a method of tangents that is virtually
identical with the one used in the differential calculus. It is much
like that of Fermat, but it makes use of two quantities—instead of
Fermat’s single letter E—quantities that are equivalent to the modern Δx
and Δy. Barrow explained his tangent rule essentially as follows. If M
is a point on a curve given (in modern notation) by a polynomial
equation f(x, y)50 and if T is the point of intersection of the desired
tangent MT with the x-axis, then Barrow marked off “an indefinitely
small arc, MN, of the curve.” He then drew the ordinates at M and N and
through M a line MR parallel to the x-axis (Fig. 16.1). Then,
designating by m the known ordinate at M, by t the desired subtangent
PT, and by a and e the vertical and horizontal sides of the triangle
MRN, Barrow pointed out that the ratio of a to e is equal to the ratio
of m to t. As we should now express it, the ratio of a to e for
infinitely close points is the slope of the curve. To find this ratio,
Barrow proceeded much as Fermat had. He replaced x and y in f(x, y)50
with x1e and y1a, respectively; then, in the resulting equation, he
disregarded all terms not containing a or e (because these by themselves
equal zero) and all terms of a degree higher than the first degree in a
and e, and, finally, he replaced a with m and e with t. From this, the
subtangent is found in terms of x and m, and if x and m are known, the
quantity t is determined. Barrow apparently did not directly know of
Fermat’s work, for he nowhere mentioned his name,</p>
<p>but the men to whom he referred as sources of his ideas include
Cavalieri, Huygens, Gregory of St. Vincent, James Gregory, and Wallis,
and it may be that Fermat’s method became known to Barrow through them.
Huygens and James Gregory, in particular, made frequent use of the
procedure, and Newton, with whom Barrow was working, recognized that
Barrow’s algorithm was only an improvement of Fermat’s.</p>
<p>Of all of the mathematicians who anticipated portions of the
differential and the integral calculus, none approached more closely to
the new analysis than Barrow. He seems to have clearly recognized the
inverse relationship between tangent and quadrature problems. But his
conservative adherence to geometric methods evidently kept him from
making effective use of the relationship, and his contemporaries found
his Lectiones geometricae difficult to understand. Fortunately, Barrow
knew that at that very time, Newton himself was working on the same
problems, and the older man entreated his young associate to collect and
publish his own results. In 1669, Barrow was called to London as
chaplain to Charles II, and Newton, on Barrow’s suggestion, succeeded
him in the Lucasian chair at Cambridge. That the succession was most
felicitous will become apparent in the rest of this chapter.</p>
<h4 id="newton">Newton</h4>
<p>Isaac Newton was born prematurely on Christmas Day of 1642, the year
of Galileo’s death. A maternal uncle who was a Cambridge graduate
recognized unusual ability in his nephew and persuaded Isaac’s mother to
enter the boy at Cambridge. Young Newton, therefore, enrolled at Trinity
College in 1661, probably with no thought of being a mathematician, for
he had made no particular study of the subject. Early in his first year,
however, he bought and studied a copy of Euclid, and, shortly
thereafter, he read Oughtred’s Clavis, the Van Schooten Geometria a
Renato Des Cartes, Kepler’s Optics, the works of Vie`te, and, perhaps
most important of all, Wallis’s Arithmetica Infinitorum. Moreover, to
this training we must add the lectures that Barrow gave as Lucasian
professor, which Newton attended, after 1663. Newton also became
acquainted with work of Galileo, Fermat, Huygens, and others.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that Newton later wrote to Robert Hooke, “If I have
seen farther than Descartes, it is because I have stood on the shoulders
of giants.”</p>
<p>Early Work</p>
<p>By the end of 1664, Newton seems to have reached the frontiers of
mathematical knowledge and was ready to make contributions of his</p>
<p>own. His first discoveries, dating from the early months of 1665,
resulted from his ability to express functions in terms of infinite
series—the very thing that Gregory was doing in Italy at about that
time, although Newton could scarcely have known of this. In 1665, Newton
also began to think of the rate of change, or fluxion, of continuously
varying quantities, or fluents, such as lengths, areas, volumes,
distances, and temperatures. From that time on, Newton linked together
these two problems—of infinite series and of rates of change—as “my
method.”</p>
<p>During much of 1665 1666, immediately after Newton had earned his
A.B. degree, Trinity College was closed because of the plague, and
Newton went home to live and think. The result was the most productive
period of mathematical discovery ever reported, for it was during these
months, Newton later averred, that he had made four of his chief
discoveries: (1) the binomial theorem, (2) the calculus, (3) the law of
gravitation, and (4) the nature of colors.</p>
<p>The Binomial Theorem</p>
<p>The binomial theorem seems so obvious to us now that it is difficult
to see whyitsdiscoverywassolongdelayed.ItwasonlywithWallisthatfractional
exponents came into common use, and we have seen that even Wallis, the
great interpolator, was unable to write down an expansion for2 1 2
ðx2x2Þ1=2 or ð12x Þ= . It remained for Newton to supply the expansions
as part of his method of infinite series. Discovered in 1664 or 1665,
the binomial theorem was described in two letters of 1676 from Newton to
Henry Oldenburg (1619? 1677), the secretary of the Royal Society, and
published byWallis(withcredittoNewton)inWallis’sAlgebraof1685.Theformof
expression given by Newton (and Wallis) strikes the modern reader as
awkward, but it indicates that the discovery was not just a simple
replacement of an integral power with a fraction; it was the result of
much trial and error on Newton’s part, in connection with divisions and
radicals involving algebraic quantities. Finally, Newton discovered
that</p>
<p>The Extractions of Roots are much shortened by the Theorem</p>
<p>m n P1PQ 5P 1 AQ1</p>
<p>DQ1etc:</p>
<p>3n 4n</p>
<p>where P1PQ stands for a Quantity whose Root or Power or whose Root of
a Power is to be found, P being the first term of that quantity, Q being
the remaining terms divided by the first term and m/n the numerical
Index of the powers of P1PQ …. Finally, in place of the terms that occur
in the course of the work in the Quotient, I shall use A, B, C, D, etc.
Thus A stands for the first term P(m/n); B for the second term (m/n)AQ;
and so on.</p>
<p>This theorem was first announced by Newton in a letter of June 13,
1676, sent to Oldenburg but intended for Leibniz. In a second letter of
October 24 of the same year, Newton explained in detail just how he had
been led to this binomial series. He wrote that toward the beginning of
his study of mathematics, he had happened on the work of Wallis on
finding the area (from x 5 0 to x5x) under curves whose ordinates are of
the form (12x2)n. On examining the areas for exponents n equal to 0, 1,
2, 3, and so on, he found the first term always to be x, the second term
to be 03x3 or 13x3 or 23x3 or 33x3, according as the power of n is 0 or
1 or 2 or 3, and so on. Hence, by Wallis’s principle of “intercalation,”
Newton assumed that the first two terms in the area for n5 should be</p>
<p>x3 x2:</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In the same fashion, proceeding by analogy, he found further terms,
the first five being</p>
<p>x3 x5 x7 x9 x2222:</p>
<p>3 5 7 9</p>
<p>He then realized that the same result could have been found by first
deriving ð12x2Þ1=2 51212x2 218x4 2161 x6 21285 x8 2 , by interpolation
in the same manner, and then finding the area through integration of the
terms in this series. In other words, Newton did not proceed directly
from the Pascal triangle to the binomial theorem but indirectly from a
quadrature problem to the binomial theorem.</p>
<h4 id="infinite-series-1">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>It is likely that Newton’s indirect approach was fortunate for the
future of his work, for it made clear to him that one could operate with
infinite series in much the same way as with finite polynomial
expressions. The generality of this new infinite analysis was then
confirmed for him when he derived the same infinite series through the
extraction of the square root of 12x2 by the usual algebraic process,
finally verifying the result by multiplying the infinite series by
itself to recover the original radicand 12x2. In the same way, Newton
found that the result obtained for (12x2) 1 by interpolation (that is,
the binomial theorem for n521) agreed with the result found by long
division. Through these examples, Newton had discovered something far
more important than the binomial theorem; he had found that the analysis
by infinite series had the same inner consistency and was subject to the
same general laws as the algebra of finite quantities. Infinite series
were no longer to be regarded only as approximating devices; they were
alternative forms of the functions they represented.</p>
<p>Newton himself never published the binomial theorem, nor did he prove
it, but he wrote out and ultimately published several accounts of his
infinite analysis. The first of these, chronologically, was the De
analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, composed in 1669 on
the basis of ideas acquired in 1665 1666 but not published until 1711.
In this, he wrote,</p>
<p>And whatever the common Analysis 〔that is, algebra〕 performs by
Means of Equations of a finite number of Terms (provided that can be
done) this new method can always perform the same by Means of infinite
Equations. So that I have not made any Question of giving this the Name
of Analysis likewise. For the Reasonings in this are no less certain
than in the other; nor the Equations less exact; albeit we Mortals whose
reasoning Powers are confined within narrow Limits, can neither express,
nor so conceive all the Terms of these Equations as to know exactly from
thence the Quantities we want. To conclude, we may justly reckon that to
belong to the Analytic Art, by the help of which the Areas and Lengths,
etc. of Curves may be exactly and geometrically determined.</p>
<p>From then on, encouraged by Newton, men no longer tried to avoid
infinite processes, as had the Greeks, for these were now regarded as
legitimate in mathematics.</p>
<p>Newton’s De Analysi contained more, of course, than some work on
infinite series; it is also of great significance as the first
systematic account of Newton’s chief mathematical discovery—the
calculus. Barrow, the most important of Newton’s mentors, was primarily
a geometer, and Newton himself has often been described as an exponent
of pure geometry, but the earliest manuscript drafts of his thoughts
show that Newton made free use of algebra and a variety of algorithmic
devices and notations. He had not, by 1666, developed his notation of
fluxions, but he had formulated a systematic method of differentiation
that was not far removed from that published in 1670 by Barrow. It is
only necessary to replace Barrow’s a with Newton’s qo and Barrow’s e
with Newton’s po to arrive at Newton’s first form for the calculus.
Evidently, Newton regarded o as a very small interval of time and op and
oq as the small increments by which x and y change in this interval. The
ratio q/p, therefore, will be the ratio of the instantaneous rates of
change of y and x, that is, the slope of the curve f(x, y)50. The slope
of the curve yn 5xm, for example, is found from (y1oq)n 5 (x1op)m by
expanding both sides by the binomial theorem, dividing through by o, and
disregarding terms that still contain o, the result being</p>
<p>qp 5 mn xymn11 or qp 5 mn xm=n1 :</p>
<p>Fractional powers no longer bothered Newton, for his method of
infinite series had given him a universal algorithm.</p>
<p>When dealing later with an explicit function of x alone, Newton
dropped his p and q and used o as a small change in the independent
variable, a notation that was also used by Gregory. In the De analysi,
for example, Newton proved as follows that the area under the curve
y5axm/n is given by</p>
<p>axðm=nÞ11</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>ðm=nÞ11</p>
<p>Let the area be z and assume that</p>
<p>z5 n axðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>Let the moment or infinitesimal increase in the abscissa be o. Then
the new abscissa will be x1o, and the augmented area will be</p>
<p>z1oy5 n aðx1oÞðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>If here one applies the binomial theorem, cancels the equal term</p>
<p>z and n axðm1nÞ=n; m1n</p>
<p>divides through by o, and discards the terms that still contain o,
the result will be y5axm/n. Conversely, if the curve is y5axm/n, then
the area will be</p>
<p>z5 n axðm1nÞ=n: m1n</p>
<p>This seems to be the first time in the history of mathematics that an
area was found through the inverse of what we call differentiation,
although the possibility of such a procedure evidently was known to
Barrow and Gregory and perhaps also to Torricelli and Fermat. Newton
became the effective inventor of the calculus because he was able to
exploit the inverse relationship between slope and area through his new
infinite analysis. This is why in later years he frowned on any effort
to separate his calculus from his analysis by infinite series.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions</p>
<dl>
<dt>In Newton’s most popular presentation of his infinitesimal methods,
he looked on x and y as flowing quantities, or fluents, of which the
quantities p and q (above) were the fluxions or rates of change; when he
wrote up this view of the calculus in about 1671, he replaced p and q
by</dt>
<dd>
<p>:</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>the “pricked letters” x and y. The quantities or fluents of which x
and y are the fluxions he designated by x0 and y0. By doubling the dots
and dashes, he was able to represent fluxions of fluxions or fluents of
fluents. The title of the work, when published long afterward in 1742
(although an English translation appeared earlier in 1736), was not
simply the method of fluxions, but Methodus Fluxionum et Serierum
Infinitorum.</p>
<p>In 1676, Newton wrote yet a third account of his calculus, under the
title De Quadratura Curvarum, and this time he sought to avoid both
infinitely small quantities and flowing quantities, replacing these with
a doctrine of “prime and ultimate ratios.” He found the “prime ratio of
nascent augments” or the “ultimate ratio of evanescent increments” as
follows. Let the ratio of the changes in x and xn be desired. Let o be
the increment in x and (x1o)n 2xn the corresponding increment in xn.
Then the ratio of the increments will be</p>
<p>n 1 nðn21Þ n 2</p>
<p>1 :nx 1ox 1 :</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>To find the prime and the ultimate ratio, one lets o vanish,
obtaining the ratio 1:(nxn 1). Here, Newton is very close indeed to the
limit concept, the chief objection being the use of the word “vanish.”
Is there really a ratio between increments that have vanished? Newton
did not clarify this question, and it continued to distract
mathematicians during the entire eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The Principia</p>
<p>Newton discovered his method of infinite series and the calculus in
1665 1666, and within the next decade he wrote at least three
substantial accounts of the new analysis. The De Analysi circulated
among friends, including John Collins (1625 1683) and Isaac Barrow, and
the infinite binomial expansion was sent to Oldenburg and Leibniz, but
Newton made no move to publish his results, even though he knew that
Gregory and Mercator in 1668 had disclosed their work on infinite
series. The first account of the calculus that Newton put into print
appeared in 1687 in Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica. This
book is generally described as presenting the foundations of physics and
astronomy in the language of pure geometry. It is true that a large part
of the work is in synthetic form, but there is also a large admixture of
analytic passages. Section I of Book I is, in fact, titled “The method
of first and last ratios of quantities, by the help of which we
demonstrate the propositions that follow,” including Lemma I:</p>
<p>Quantities, and the ratios of quantities, which in any finite time
converge continually to equality, and before the end of that time
approach nearer to each other than by any given difference, become
ultimately equal.</p>
<p>This is, of course, an attempt to define the limit of a function.
Lemma VII in Section I postulates that “the ultimate ratio of the arc,
chord, and tangent, any one to any other, is the ratio of equality.”
Other lemmas in that section assume the similarity of certain
“evanescent triangles.” Every now and then in Book I, the author has
recourse to an infinite series. Yet calculus algorithms do not appear
until in Book II, Lemma II, we come to the cryptic formulation</p>
<p>The moment of any genitum is equal to the moments of each of the
generating sides multiplied by the indices of the powers of those sides,
and by their coefficients continually.</p>
<p>Newton’s explanation shows that by the word “genitum,” he has in mind
what we call a “term,” and that by the “moment” of a genitum, he means
the infinitely small increment. Designating by a the moment of A and by
b the moment of B, Newton proves that the moment of AB is aB1bA, that
the moment of An is naAn 1, and that the moment of 1/A is 2a/(A2). Such
expressions, which are the equivalents of the differential of a product,
a power, and a reciprocal, respectively, constitute Newton’s first
official pronouncement on the calculus, making it easy to understand why
so few mathematicians of the time mastered the new analysis in terms of
Newtonian language.</p>
<p>Newton was not the first one to differentiate or to integrate or to
see the relationship between these operations in the fundamental theorem
of the calculus. His discovery consisted of the consolidation of these
elements into a general algorithm that is applicable to all functions,
whether algebraic or transcendental. This was emphasized in a scholium
that Newton published in the Principia immediately following Lemma
II:</p>
<p>In a letter of mine to Mr. J. Collins, dated December 10, 1672,
having described a method of tangents, which I suspected to be the same
with Sluse’s method, which at that time was not made public, I added
these words: This is one particular, or rather a Corollary, of a general
method, which extends itself, without any troublesome calculation, not
only to the drawing of tangents to any curved lines whether geometrical
or mechanical …but also to the resolving other abstruser kinds of
problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centres of gravity of
curves, etc.; nor is it (as Hudden’s method de maximis et minimis)
limited to equations which are free from surd quantities. This method I
have interwoven with that other of working in equations by reducing them
to infinite series.</p>
<p>In the first edition of the Principia, Newton admitted that Leibniz
was in possession of a similar method, but in the third edition of 1726,
following the bitter quarrel between adherents of the two men concerning
the independence and priority of the discovery of the calculus, Newton
deleted the reference to the calculus of Leibniz. It is now fairly clear
that Newton’s discovery antedated that of Leibniz by about ten years,
but that the discovery by Leibniz was independent of that of Newton.
Moreover, Leibniz is entitled to priority of publication, for he printed
an account of his calculus in 1684 in the Acta Eruditorum, a sort of
“scientific monthly” that had been established only two years
earlier.</p>
<p>In the opening sections of the Principia, Newton had so generalized
and clarified Galileo’s ideas on motion that ever since, we refer to
this formulation as “Newton’s laws of motion.” Then Newton went on to
combine these laws with Kepler’s laws in astronomy and Huygens’s law of
centripetal force in circular motion to establish the great unifying
principle that any two particles in the universe, whether two planets or
two mustard seeds, or the sun and a mustard seed, attract each other
with a force that varies inversely as the square of the distance between
them. In the statement of this law, Newton had been anticipated by
others, including Robert Hooke (1638 1703), professor of geometry at
Gresham College and Oldenburg’s successor as secretary of the Royal
Society. But Newton was the first to convince the world of the truth of
the law because he was able to handle the mathematics required in the
proof.</p>
<p>For circular motion, the inverse square law is easily derived from
Newton’s f5ma, Huygens’s a5v2 /r, and Kepler’s T2 5Kr3 simply by noting
that T ~r=v and then eliminating T and v from the equations, to arrive
at f ~1=r2. To prove the same thing for ellipses, however, required
considerably more mathematical skill. Moreover, to prove that the
distance is to be measured from the center of the bodies was so
difficult a task that it evidently was this integration problem that
induced Newton to lay the work on gravitation aside for almost twenty
years following his discovery of the law in the plague year of 1665
1666. When, in 1684, his friend Edmund Halley (1656 1742), a
mathematician of no mean ability who also had guessed at the inverse
square law, pressed Newton for a proof, the result was the exposition in
the Principia. So impressed was Halley with the quality of this book
that he had it published at his own expense.</p>
<p>The Principia, of course, contains far more than the calculus, the
laws of motion, and the law of gravitation. It includes, in science,
such things as the motions of bodies in resisting media and the proof
that for isothermal vibrations, the velocity of sound should be the
speed with which a body would strike the earth if falling without
resistance through a height that is half that of a uniform atmosphere
having the density of air at the surface of the earth and exerting the
same pressure. Another of the scientific conclusions in the Principia is
a mathematical proof of the invalidity of the prevailing cosmic
scheme—the Cartesian theory of vortices—for Newton showed, at the close
of Book II, that according to the laws of mechanics, planets in vortical
motion would move more swiftly in aphelion than in perihelion, which
contradicts the astronomy of Kepler. Nevertheless, it took about forty
years before the Newtonian gravitational view of the universe displaced
the Cartesian vortical cosmology in France.</p>
<p>Theorems on Conics</p>
<p>One who reads only the headings of the three books in the Principia
will get the erroneous impression that it contains nothing but physics
and astronomy, for the books are titled, respectively, I. The Motion of
Bodies, II. The Motion of Bodies (in Resisting Mediums), and III. The
System of the World. Yet the treatise also contains a great deal of pure
mathematics, especially concerning the conic sections. In Lemma XIX of
Book I, for example, the author solves the Pappus four-line-locus
problem, adding that his solution is “not an analytical calculus but a
geometrical composition, such as the ancients required,” an oblique and
pejorative reference, apparently, to the treatment of the problem given
by Descartes.</p>
<p>Throughout the Principia, Newton gave preference to a geometric
approach, but we have seen that where he found it expedient to do so, he
did not hesitate to appeal to his method of infinite series and the
calculus. Most of Section II of Book II, for example, is analytic. On
the other hand, Newton’s handling of the properties of conics is almost
exclusively synthetic, for here Newton had no need to resort to
analysis. Following the Pappus problem, he gave a couple of organic
generations of conics through intersections of moving lines, and then he
used these in half a dozen succeeding propositions to show how to
construct a conic satisfying five conditions: passing through five
points, for example, or tangent to five lines or through two points and
tangent to three lines.</p>
<p>Optics and Curves</p>
<p>The Principia is the greatest monument to Newton, but it is by no
means the only one. His paper in the 1672 Philosophical Transactions
concerning the nature of color was of great importance to physics, for
it was here that Newton announced what he regarded as one of the oddest
of all of the operations of nature—that white light was merely a
combination of rays of varying color, each color having its own
characteristic index of refraction. Such a revolutionary view was not
easy for his contemporaries to accept, and the ensuing controversy upset
Newton. For fifteen years, he published nothing further until the urging
of Halley induced him to write and publish the Principia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three versions of his calculus that he had written
from 1669 to 1676, as well as a treatise on optics that he had composed,
remained in manuscript form.</p>
<p>About fifteen years after the Principia appeared, Hooke died, and
then, finally, Newton’s aversion to publication seems to have abated
somewhat. The Opticks appeared in 1704, and appended to it were two
mathematical works: the De Quadratura Curvarum, in which an intelligible
account of the Newtonian methods in the calculus finally appeared in
print, and a little treatise titled Enumeratio Curvarum Tertii Ordinis
(Enumeration of Curves of Third Degree). The Enumeratio had also been
composed by 1676, and it is the earliest instance of a work devoted
solely to graphs of higher plane curves in algebra. Newton noted
seventy-two species of cubics (half a dozen are omitted), and a curve of
each species is carefully drawn. For the first time, two axes are
systematically used, and there is no hesitation about negative
coordinates. Among the interesting properties of cubics indicated in
this treatise are the fact that a third-degree curve can have not more
than three asymptotes (as a conic can have no more than two) and that as
all conics are projections of the circle, so all cubics are projections
of a “divergent parabola” y2 5ax3 1bx2 1cx1d.</p>
<p>Polar and Other Coordinates</p>
<p>The Enumeratio was not Newton’s only contribution to analytic
geometry. In the Method of Fluxions, written in Latin about 1671, he had
suggested eight new types of coordinate system. One of these, Newton’s
“Third Manner” of determining a curve was through what now are called
“bipolar coordinates.” If x and y are the distances of a variable point
from two fixed points or poles, then the equations x1y5a and x2y5a
represent ellipses and hyperbolas, respectively, and ax1by 5 c are ovals
of Descartes. This type of coordinate system is infrequently used today,
but that given by Newton as his “Seventh Manner; For Spirals” is now
familiarly known under the name of “polar coordinates.” Using x where we
now use 0 or φ and y where we use r or ρ, Newton found the subtangent to
the spiral of Archimedes by5ax, as well as to other spirals. Having
given the formula for radius of curvature in rectangular
coordinates,</p>
<p>5ð11y:2Þp1:1y:2 ;</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>z</p>
<p>where z5y:; he wrote the corresponding formula in polar coordinates
as</p>
<p>y1yzz</p>
<p>Rsinc5 1zz2z:;</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>where z5y:=y and c is the angle between the tangent and the radius
vector.</p>
<p>Newton also gave equations for the transformation from rectangular to
polar coordinates, expressing these as xx1yy5tt and tv5y, where t is the
radius vector and v is a line representing the sine of the vectorial
angle associated with the point (x, y) in Cartesian coordinates.</p>
<p>Newton’s Method and Newton’s Parallelogram</p>
<p>In the Method of Fluxions, as well as in De Analysi, we find
“Newton’s method” for the approximate solution of equations. If the
equation to be solved is f(x)50, one first locates the desired root
between two values x5a1 and x5b1 such that in the interval (a1, b1)
neither the first nor the second derivative vanishes, or fails to exist.
Then, for one of the values, say, x5a1, f(x) and fv(x) will have the
same sign. In this case, the value x5a2 will be a better approximation
if</p>
<p>a25a1 2 fða1Þ ;</p>
<p>f 0ða1Þ</p>
<p>and this procedure can be applied iteratively to obtain as precise an
approximation an as may be desired. If f(x) is of the form x2 2a2, the
successive approximations in the Newton method are the same as those
found in the Old Babylonian square-root algorithm; hence, this ancient
procedure is sometimes unwarrantedly called “Newton’s algorithm.” If
f(x) is a polynomial, Newton’s method is in essence the same as the
Chinese-Arabic method named for Horner, but the great advantage of the
Newtonian method is that it applies equally to equations involving
transcendental functions.</p>
<p>The Method of Fluxions also contained a diagram that later became
known as “Newton’s parallelogram,” useful in developments in infinite
series and in the sketching of curves. For a polynomial equation f(x,
y)50, one forms a grid or a lattice the intersection points of which are
to correspond to terms of all possible degrees in the equation f(x,
y)50. On this “parallelogram,” one connects by straight-line segments
those intersections that correspond to terms actually appearing in the
equation and then forms a portion of a polygon convex toward the point
of zero degree. In Fig. 16.2, we have drawn the diagram for the folium
of Descartes, x3 1y3 23axy50. Then, the equations that are obtained by
equating to zero in turn the totality of terms from the given equation
whose lattice points lie on each of the segments will be approximating
equations for branches of the curve through the origin. In the case of
the folium of Descartes, the approximating curves are x3 23axy50 (or the
parabola x2 53ay) and</p>
<p>y3 23axy50 (or the parabola y2 53ax). The graphing of portions of
these parabolas near the origin will aid in the rapid sketching of the
given equation f(x, y) 50.</p>
<p>The Arithmetica Universalis</p>
<p>The three Newtonian books that are best known today are the
Principia, the Method of Fluxions, and the Opticks; there is also a
fourth work that in the eighteenth century appeared in a greater number
of editions than did the other three, and it, too, contained valuable
contributions. This was the Arithmetica Universalis, a work composed
between 1673 and 1683, perhaps for Newton’s lectures at Cambridge, and
first published in 1707. This influential treatise contains the
formulas, usually known as “Newton’s identities,” for the sums of the
powers of the roots of a polynomial equation. Cardan had known that the
sum of the roots of xn 1a1xn 1 1an 1x1an 5 0 is 2a1, and</p>
<p>Vie`te had carried the relations between roots and coefficients
somewhat further. In 1629, Girard had shown how to find the sum of the
squares of the roots or the sum of the cubes or of the fourth powers,
but it was Newton who generalized this work to cover all powers. If K#
n, the</p>
<p>relationships</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK 1 1 1aKK 50 and</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK1 1 1aKS0 1aK 11S1 1 1anSKn 50 both hold; if K.n, the
relationship</p>
<p>SK 1a1SK1 1 1an1SKn11 1anSK n 50</p>
<p>holds, where Si is the sum of the ith powers of the roots. Using
these relationships recursively, the sums of the powers of the roots can
readily be found for any integral power. In the Arithmetica Universalis,
there is also a theorem generalizing Descartes’ rule of signs to
determine the number of imaginary roots of a polynomial, as well as a
rule for an upper bound for the positive roots.</p>
<p>The longest section in the Arithmetica Universalis is that on the
resolution of geometric questions. Here the solution of cubic equations
is carried out with the help of a given conic section, for Newton
regarded geometric constructions through curves other than the line and
the circle as part of algebra, rather than of geometry:</p>
<p>Equations are Expressions of Arithmetical Computation and properly
have no place in Geometry. Therefore the conic sections and all other
Figures must be cast out of plane Geometry, except the right Line and
the Circle. Therefore all these descriptions of the Conicks in piano,
which the Moderns are so fond of, are foreign to Geometry.</p>
<p>Newton’s conservatism here is in sharp contrast with his radical
views in analysis—and with pedagogical views of the mid-twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Later Years</p>
<p>The Principia was the first of Newton’s mathematical treatises to be
published, but it was the last in order of composition. Fame had come to
him relatively promptly, for he had been elected to the Royal Society in
1672, four years after he had constructed his reflecting telescope (the
idea for which had also occurred to Gregory even earlier). The Principia
met with enthusiastic approval, and in 1689, Newton was elected to
represent Cambridge in the British Parliament. Despite the generous
recognition he received, Newton became depressed and suffered a nervous
breakdown in 1692. He accepted an appointment as Warden of the Mint in
1696, becoming Master of the Mint three years later. Newton retained his
extraordinary mathematical ability to the very last; when Leibniz in
1716 (the last year of his life) challenged Newton to find the
orthogonal trajectories of a one-parameter family of plane curves,
Newton solved the problem within a few hours and gave a method for
finding trajectories in general. (Earlier, in 1696, Newton had been
challenged to find the brachistochrone, or curve of quickest descent,
and the day after receiving the problem he gave the solution, showing
the curve to be a cycloid.)</p>
<p>Honors were heaped on Newton in his later years. In 1699, he was
elected a foreign associate of the Acade´mie des Sciences; in 1703, he
became president of the Royal Society, holding the post for the rest of
his life; and in 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne. Nevertheless, one
event cast a cloud over Newton’s life after 1695. In that year, Wallis
told him that in Holland, the calculus was regarded as the discovery of
Leibniz. In 1699, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (1664 1753), an obscure
Swiss mathematician who had moved to England, implied in a paper to the
Royal Society that Leibniz may have taken his ideas on the calculus from
Newton. At this affront, Leibniz, in the Acta Eruditorum for 1704,
insisted that he was entitled to priority in publication and protested
to the Royal Society against the imputation of plagiarism. In 1705,
Newton’s De Quadratura Curvarum was unfavorably reviewed (by Leibniz?)
in the Acta Eruditorum, and in 1708, John Keill (1671 1721), an Oxford
professor, vigorously supported Newton’s claims against those of Leibniz
in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions. Leibniz’s repeated appeals
to the Royal Society for justice finally led the Society to appoint a
committee to study the matter and to report on it. The committee’s
report, under the title Commercium epistolicum, was published in 1712,
but it left matters unimproved. It reached the banal conclusion that
Newton was the first inventor, a point that had not been questioned
seriously in the first place. Implications of plagiarism were supported
by the committee in terms of documents that they assumed Leibniz had
seen, but that we now know he had not received. The bitterness of
national feeling reached such a point that in 1726, a decade after
Leibniz had died, Newton deleted from the third edition of the Principia
all reference to the fact that Leibniz had possessed a method in the
calculus similar to the Newtonian.</p>
<p>As a consequence to the disgraceful priority dispute, British
mathematicians were to some extent alienated from workers on the
Continent during much of the eighteenth century. On his death, Newton
was buried in
WestminsterAbbeywithsuchpompthatVoltaire,whoattendedthefuneral, said
later, “I have seen a professor of mathematics, only because he was
great in his vocation, buried like a king who had done good to his
subjects.”</p>
<h4 id="abraham-de-moivre">Abraham De Moivre</h4>
<p>British mathematics boasted an impressive number of capable
contributors during the earlier part of the eighteenth century. Abraham
De Moivre (1667 1754) had been born a French Huguenot, but shortly after
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, he went to England, where he made
the acquaintance of Newton and Halley and became a private teacher of
mathematics. In 1697, he was elected to the Royal Society and
subsequently to the Academies of Paris and Berlin. He hoped to obtain a
university position in mathematics, but this he never secured, partly
because of his non-British origin, and Leibniz tried in vain to secure a
professional position for him in Germany. Nevertheless, despite the
long</p>
<p>Abraham D e Moi vr e</p>
<p>hours of tutoring that were necessary to support himself, De Moivre
produced a considerable quantity of research.</p>
<h4 id="probability-1">Probability</h4>
<p>The theory of probability had many devotees during the early
eighteenth century, and De Moivre was one of the most important of
these. In 1711, he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions a long
memoir on the laws of chance, and this he expanded into a celebrated
volume, the Doctrine of Chances, that appeared in 1718 (and in later
editions). The memoir and the volume contained numerous questions on
dice, the problem of points (with unequal chances of winning), drawing
balls of various colors from a bag, and other games. Some of the
problems had appeared in Jacques Bernoulli’s Ars Conjectandi, the
publication of which was earlier than the Doctrine of Chances but later
than De Moivre’s memoir. In the preface to the Doctrine of Chances, the
author referred to the work on probability of Jacques, Jean, and
Nicolaus Bernoulli. The various editions of the volume contain more than
fifty problems on probability, as well as questions relating to life
annuities. In general, De Moivre derived the theory of permutations and
combinations from the principles of probability, whereas now it is
customary to reverse the roles. For example, to find the number of
permutations of two letters chosen from the six letters a, b, c, d, e,
and f, he argued that the probability that a particular letter will be
first is and the probability that another specific letter will be second
is . Hence, the probability that these two letters will appear in that
order is U, from which one concludes that the number of all possible
permutations, two at a time, is 30. De Moivre is often credited with the
principle, published in the Doctrine of Chances, that the probability of
a compound event is the product of the probabilities of its components,
but this had been implied in earlier works.</p>
<p>De Moivre was especially interested in developing for probability
general procedures and notations that he thought of as a new “algebra.”
A generalization of a problem given earlier by Huygens usually is
appropriately called De Moivre’s problem: to find the probability of
throwing a given number on a throw of n dice, each having m faces. Some
of his contributions to probability were published in a further volume,
the Miscellanea Analytica of 1730. In a supplement to this work, De
Moivre included some results that also appeared in the Methodus
Differentialis of James Stirling (1692 1770), published in the same year
as the Miscellanea Analytica. Among these is the approximation n!
p2πnðn=eÞn, which is usually known as Stirling’s formula, although it
was known earlier to De Moivre, and a series, also named for Stirling,
relating ln n! and the Bernoulli numbers.</p>
<p>De Moivre apparently was the first one to work with the probability
formula</p>
<p>N 2x2 5 pπ; e dx</p>
<p>0 2</p>
<p>a result that unobtrusively appeared in a privately printed pamphlet
of 1733 titled Approximatio ad summam terminorum binomii (a1b)n in
seriem expansi. This work, representing the first appearance of the law
of errors or the distribution curve, was translated by De Moivre and was
included in the second edition (1738) of his Doctrine of Chances. In his
work on Annuities upon Lives, which formed a part of the Doctrine of
Chances and was separately reprinted in more than half a dozen editions,
he adopted a rough-and-ready rule, known as “De Moivre’s hypothesis of
equal decrements,” that annuities can be computed on the assumption that
the number of a given group that die is the same during each year.</p>
<p>De Moivre’s Theorem</p>
<p>The Miscellanea Analytica is important not only in probability but
also in the development of the analytic side of trigonometry. The
well-known De Moivre’s theorem, ðcosθ1isinθÞn 5cosnθ1isinnθ, is not
explicitly given, but it is clear from the work on cyclometry and other
contexts that the author was quite familiar with this relationship,
probably as early as 1707. In a paper in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1707, De Moivre wrote that</p>
<p>1p 1=n 1 p 1=n ðsinnθ1 21cosnθÞ 1ðsinnθ2 21cosnθÞ 5sinθ:</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In his Miscellanea Analytica of 1730, he expressed the equivalent
of</p>
<p>ðcosθ6isinθÞ1=n 5cos 2Kπ6θ 6isin 2Kπ6θ; n n</p>
<p>which he used to factor x2n 12x cos nθ11 into quadratic factors of
the form x2 12x cos θ11. Again in a Philosophical Transactions paper of
1739, he found the nth roots of the “impossible binomial” a1 2p b
through the procedure that we now use in taking the nth root of the
modulus, dividing the amplitude by n, and adding multiples of 2π/n.</p>
<p>De Moivre, dealing with imaginary numbers and the circular functions
in Miscellanea Analytica, came close to recognizing the hyperbolic
functions in extending theorems on sectors of circles to analogous
results on sectors of the rectangular hyperbola. In view of</p>
<p>Ro ger Co t e s</p>
<p>the breadth and depth of his results, it was natural that Newton in
his later years should have told those who came to him with questions on
mathematics, “Go to Mr. De Moivre; he knows these things better than I
do.”</p>
<p>In the Philosophical Transactions for 1697 1698, De Moivre had
written on the “infinitonome,” that is, an infinite polynomial or
infinite series, including the process of finding a root of such an
expression, and it was largely in recognition of this paper that he had
been elected a member of the Royal Society. De Moivre’s interest in
infinite series and probability is reminiscent of the Bernoullis’. De
Moivre carried on an extensive and cordial correspondence with Jean
Bernoulli during the decade 1704 to 1714, and it was the former who
proposed the latter for election to the Royal Society in 1712.</p>
<h4 id="roger-cotes">Roger Cotes</h4>
<p>One of the motives that had led De Moivre to be concerned with the
factoring of x2n 1axn 11 into quadratic factors was the desire to
complete some of the work of Roger Cotes (1682 1716) on the integration
of rational fractions through decompositions into partial fractions. The
life of Cotes is another tragic instance of a very promising career cut
short by premature death. As Newton remarked, “If Cotes had lived, we
might have known something.” A student and later a professor at
Cambridge, the young man had spent much of the time from 1709 to 1713
preparing the second edition of Newton’s Principia. Three years later he
died, leaving behind him some significant but uncompleted work. Much of
this was collected and published posthumously in 1722 under the title
Harmonia Mensurarum. The title is derived from the following
theorem:</p>
<p>If through a fixed point O a variable straight line is drawn cutting
an algebraic curve in points Q1, Q2,…, Qn, and if a point P is taken on
the line such that the reciprocal of OP is the arithmetic mean of the
reciprocals of OQ1, OQ2,…, OQn, then the locus of P is a straight
line.</p>
<p>Most of the treatise, however, is devoted to the integration of
rational fractions, including decomposition into quadratic factors of xn
21, work later completed by De Moivre. The Harmonia Mensurarum is among
the early works to recognize the periodicity of the trigonometric
functions, cycles of the tangent and secant functions appearing here in
print for perhaps the first time. It is one of the earliest books with a
thorough treatment of the calculus as applied to the logarithmic and
circular functions, including a table of integrals that depends on
these. In this connection, the author gave what is known in trigonometry
books as “Cotes’s property of the circle,” a result closely related to
De Moivre’s theorem, which allows one to write such expressions as</p>
<p>2n2 π 2 3π</p>
<p>x 115 x 22xcos11x 22xcos11</p>
<p>2n 2n</p>
<p>2 ð2n21Þπ</p>
<p>2x 22xcos11 :</p>
<p>2n</p>
<p>This result is readily confirmed if, having plotted on the unit
circle the roots of 21 of order 2n, one forms the products of conjugate
imaginary pairs. Cotes apparently was among the earliest of
mathematicians to anticipate the relationship ln(cosθ1isinθ)5iθ, an
equivalent of which had been given by him in a Philosophical
Transactions article in 1714 and which was reprinted in the Harmonia
Mensurarum. This theorem is usually attributed to Euler, who first gave
it in modern exponential form.</p>
<h4 id="james-stirling">James Stirling</h4>
<p>Stirling, a Jacobite who had studied at Oxford, published in 1717 a
work titled Lineae Tertii Ordinis Neutonianae, in which he completed the
classification of cubic curves, drawn up by Newton in 1704, by adding
some cubics that Newton missed and by adding demonstrations that had
been lacking in the original Enumeratio. Stirling showed, among other
things, that if the y-axis is an asymptote of a curve of order n, the
equation of the curve cannot contain a term in yn and an asymptote
cannot cut the curve in more than n22 points. For graphs of rational
functions y5f(x)/g(x), he found the vertical asymptotes by equating g(x)
to zero. For conic sections, Stirling gave a full treatment in which the
axes, vertices, and asymptotes are found analytically from the general
second-degree equation with respect to oblique coordinates.</p>
<p>His Methodus Differentialis of 1730 contained significant
contributions to the study of convergence of infinite series,
interpolation, and special functions defined by series; he is best
known, however, for the approximation formula for n! mentioned
previously.</p>
<h4 id="colin-maclaurin">Colin Maclaurin</h4>
<p>Colin Maclaurin (1698 1746), perhaps the outstanding British
mathematician of the generation after Newton, was born in Scotland and
educated at the University of Glasgow. He became a professor of
mathematics at Aberdeen when he was nineteen and half a dozen years
later taught at the University of Edinburgh. In Great Britain,
Switzerland, and the Low</p>
<p>C olin Mac laur in</p>
<p>Countries, the leading mathematicians in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries were connected with universities, whereas in
France, Germany, and Russia, they were more likely to be associated with
the academies established by the absolute rulers.</p>
<p>Maclaurin had begun to contribute papers to the Philosophical
Transactions before he was twenty-one, and in 1720, he published two
treatises on curves: Geometrica Organica and De Linearum Geometricarum
proprietatibus. The former, in particular, was a well-known work that
extended the results of Newton and Stirling on conics, cubics, and
higher algebraic curves. Among the propositions is one often known as
the theorem of Be´zout (in honor of the man who later gave an imperfect
proof): a curve of order m intersects a curve of order n in general in
mn points. In connection with this theorem, Maclaurin noticed a
difficulty that is usually known as Cramer’s paradox, in honor of a
later rediscoverer. A curve of order n is generally determined, as
Stirling had indicated, by n(n13)/2 points. Thus, a conic is uniquely
determined by five points and a cubic should be determined by nine
points. By the Maclaurin-Be´zout theorem, however, two curves of degree
n intersect in n2 points, so that two different cubics intersect in nine
points. Hence, it is obvious that n(n13)/2 points do not always uniquely
determine a single curve of order n. The answer to the paradox did not
appear until a century later, when it was explained in the work of
Julius Plu¨cker.</p>
<p>Taylor’s Series</p>
<p>In view of Maclaurin’s striking results in geometry, it is ironic
that today his name is recalled almost exclusively in connection with
the so-called Maclaurin series, which appeared in his Treatise of
Fluxions of 1742 but is only a special case of the more general Taylor
series, published by Brook Taylor (1685 1731) in 1715 in his Methodus
Incrementorum Directa et Inversa. Taylor was a Cambridge graduate, an
enthusiastic admirer of Newton, and secretary of the Royal Society. He
was much interested in perspective; on this subject he published two
books in 1715 and 1719, in the second of which he gave the first general
statement of the principle of vanishing points. Yet today his name is
recalled almost exclusively in connection with the series</p>
<p>fðx1aÞ5fðaÞ1f 0ðaÞx1f nðaÞ x2</p>
<p>2!</p>
<p>1f 000ðaÞ x3 1 1f ðnÞðaÞ xn 1</p>
<p>3! n!</p>
<p>which appeared in the Methodus Incrementorum. The series becomes the
familiar Maclaurin series on substituting zero for a. The general Taylor
series had been known many years prior to James Gregory and also, in
essence, to Jean Bernoulli, but Taylor was unaware of this. Moreover,
the Maclaurin series had appeared in Stirling’s Methodus Differentialis
more than a dozen years before it was published by Maclaurin. Clio, the
muse of history, is often fickle in the matter of attaching names to
theorems!</p>
<p>The Analyst Controversy</p>
<p>The Methodus Incrementorum also contained a number of other familiar
parts of the calculus, such as formulas relating the derivative of a
function to the derivative of the inverse function—for example, d2x/dy2
52d2y/ dx2 /(dy/dx)3—singular solutions of differential equations, and
an attempt to find an equation for a vibrating string. After 1719,
Taylor gave up the pursuit of mathematics, but the young Maclaurin was
then just beginning his fruitful career. His Treatise of Fluxions was
not merely another book on the techniques of the calculus, but was an
effort to establish the subject on a sound basis, similar to that of the
geometry of Archimedes. The motive here was to defend the subject from
attacks that had been launched, especially by Bishop George Berkeley
(1685 1753) in a 1734 tract titled The Analyst. Berkeley did not deny
the utility of the techniques of fluxions or the validity of the results
obtained by using these, but he had been nettled on having a sick friend
refuse spiritual consolation because Halley had convinced the friend of
the untenable nature of Christian doctrine. Hence, the subtitle of the
Analyst reads,</p>
<p>Or a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician 〔presumably
Halley〕. Wherein It Is Examined Whether the Object, Principles, and
Inferences of the Modern Analysis are More Distinctly Conceived, or More
Evidently Deduced, than Religious Mysteries and Points of Faith. “First
Cast the Beam Out of Thine Own Eye; and Then Shalt Thou See Clearly to
Cast Out the Mote Out of Thy Brother’s Eye.”</p>
<p>Berkeley’s account of the method of fluxions was quite fair, and his
criticisms were well taken. He pointed out that in finding either
fluxions or the ratios of differentials, mathematicians first assume
that increments are given to the variables and then take the increments
away by assuming them to be zero. The calculus, as then explained,
seemed to Berkeley to be only a compensation of errors. Thus, “by virtue
of a twofold mistake you arrive, though not at science, yet at the
truth.” Even Newton’s explanation of fluxions in terms of prime and
ultimate ratios was condemned by Berkeley, who denied the possibility of
a literally “instantaneous” velocity in which distance and time
increments have vanished to leave the meaningless quotient 0/0. As he
expressed it,</p>
<p>And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments.
And what are these same evanescent increments? They are neither
finite</p>
<p>C olin Mac laur in</p>
<p>quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we
not call them ghosts of departed quantities?</p>
<p>It was to answer such criticisms that Maclaurin wrote his Treatise of
Fluxions in the rigorous manner of the ancients, but in doing so, he
used a geometric approach that is less suggestive of the new
developments that were to feature the analysis of Continental Europe.
Perhaps this is not unrelated to the fact that Maclaurin was almost the
last significant mathematician in Great Britain during the eighteenth
century, a time when analysis, rather than geometry, was on the crest of
the wave. Nevertheless, the Treatise of Fluxions contained a number of
relatively new results, including the integral test for convergence of
infinite series (given earlier by Euler in 1732 but generally
overlooked).</p>
<p>After Maclaurin and De Moivre died, British mathematics suffered an
eclipse, so that despite the recognition accorded mathematical
achievement in England up to that time, development of mathematics there
failed to match the rapid strides taken elsewhere in Europe during the
eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Cramer’s Rule</p>
<p>If today the name of Maclaurin is recalled in connection with a
series of which he was not the first discoverer, this is compensated for
by the fact that a contribution he made bears the name of someone else
who discovered and printed it later. The well-known Cramer’s rule,
published in 1750 by Gabriel Cramer (1704 1752), was probably known to
Maclaurin as early as 1729, the time when he was composing an algebra
intended as commentary on Newton’s Arithmetica Universalis. The
Maclaurin Treatise of Algebra was published in 1748, two years after the
author had died, and in it, the rule for solving simultaneous equations
by determinants appeared, two years earlier than in Cramer’s
Introduction a` l’analyse des lignes courbes alge´briques. The solution
for y in the system</p>
<p>ax1by5c</p>
<p>dx1ey5f</p>
<p>is given as</p>
<p>af 2dc y5: ae2db</p>
<p>The solution for z in the system</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>ax1by1cz5m dx1ey1fz5n</p>
<p>:gx1hy1kz5p</p>
<p>is expressed as</p>
<p>aep2ahn1dhm2dbp1gbn2gem z5: aek 2ahf 1dhc2dbk 1gbf 2gec</p>
<p>Maclaurin explained that the denominator consists, in the former
case, of “the Difference of the Products of the opposite Coefficients
taken from the Orders that involve the two unknown Quantities” and, in
the latter case, “of all the Products that can be made of the three
opposite Coefficients taken from the Orders that involve the three
unknown Quantities.” The numerators in Maclaurin’s patterns differ from
the denominators merely in the substitution in the former of the
constant terms for the coefficients of the terms in the unknown sought.
He explained how to write out the solution similarly for four equations
in four unknowns, “prefixing contrary signs to those that involve the
Products of two opposite Coefficients.” This statement shows that
Maclaurin had in mind a rule for alternations in sign akin to that now
ordinarily described in terms of the inversion principle.</p>
<p>Maclaurin’s posthumous Treatise of Algebra enjoyed an even wider
popularity than his other works, with a sixth edition appearing in
London in 1796. The world nevertheless seems to have learned of the
solution of simultaneousequations by determinantsmorethrough
Cramerthanthrough Maclaurin, mainly, we suspect, because of the
superiority of Cramer’s notation, in which superscripts were attached to
literal coefficients to facilitate the determination of signs. Another
possible factor is the previously mentioned alienation of British from
Continental mathematicians. Textbooks</p>
<p>Maclaurin and others had composed good textbooks on an elementary
level. Maclaurin’s Treatise of Algebra went through half a dozen
editions from 1748 to 1796. A rival Treatise of Algebra by Thomas
Simpson (1710 1761) boasted at least eight editions in London from 1745
to 1809; another, Elements of Algebra, by Nicholas Saunderson (1682
1739), enjoyed five editions between 1740 and 1792.</p>
<p>Simpson was a self-taught genius who won election to the Royal
Society in 1745, but whose turbulent life ended in failure half a dozen
years later. His name nevertheless is preserved in the so-called
Simpson’s rule, published in his Mathematical Dissertations on Physical
and Analytical Subjects (1743), for approximate quadratures using
parabolic arcs, but this result had appeared in somewhat different form
in 1668 in the Exercitationes geometricae of James Gregory. Saunderson’s
life, by contrast, was an example of personal triumph over an enormous
handicap—total blindness from the age of one, resulting from an attack
of smallpox.</p>
<p>Algebra textbooks of the eighteenth century illustrate a tendency
toward increasingly algorithmic emphasis, while at the same time
there</p>
<p>Rigor and P r o gr e s s</p>
<p>remained considerable uncertainty about the logical bases for the
subject. Most authors felt it necessary to dwell at length on the rules
governing multiplications of negative numbers, and some categorically
rejected the possibility of multiplying two negative numbers. The
century was, par excellence, a textbook age in mathematics, and never
before had so many books appeared in so many editions. Simpson’s Algebra
had a companion volume, Elements of Plane Geometry, which went through
five editions from 1747 to 1800. But among the host of textbooks of the
time, few achieved quite the record of the edition by Robert Simson
(1687 1768) of the Elements of Euclid. This work, by a man trained in
medicine who became a professor in mathematics at the University of
Glasgow, first appeared in 1756, and by 1834, it boasted a twenty-fourth
English edition, not to mention translations into other languages or
geometries more or less derived from it, for most modern English
versions of Euclid are heavily indebted to it.</p>
<h4 id="rigor-and-progress">Rigor and Progress</h4>
<p>Simson sought to revive ancient Greek geometry, and in this
connection, he published “restorations” of lost works, such as Euclid’s
Porisms and the Determinate Sections of Apollonius. England during the
eighteenth century remained a stronghold of synthetic geometry, and
analytic methods made little headway in geometry.</p>
<p>It is customary to place much of the blame for the backwardness in
analysis on the supposedly clumsy method of fluxions, as compared with
that of the differential calculus, but such a view is not easily
justified. Fluxional notations even today are conveniently used by
physicists, and they are readily adapted to analytic geometry, but no
calculus, whether differential or fluxional, is appropriately wedded to
synthetic geometry. Hence, the British predilection for pure geometry
seems to have been a far more effective deterrent to research in
analysis than was the notation of fluxions. Nor is it fair to place the
blame for British geometric conservatism largely on the shoulders of
Newton. After all, Newton’s Method of Fluxions was replete with analytic
geometry, and even the Principia contained more analysis than is
generally recognized. Perhaps it was an excessive insistence on logical
precision that had led the British into a narrow geometric view. We
previously noted Berkeley’s arguments against mathematicians, and
Maclaurin had felt that the most effective way to meet these on a
rational basis was to return to the rigor of classical geometry. On the
Continent, on the other hand, the feeling was akin to the advice that
Jean Le Rond d’Alembert is said to have given to a hesitating
mathematical friend: “Just go on ahead, and faith will soon return.”</p>
<h4 id="leibniz-1">Leibniz</h4>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646 1716) was born in Leipzig, where he
studied theology, law, philosophy, and mathematics at the university. By
the time he was twenty, he was prepared for the degree of doctor of
laws, but this was refused because of his youth. He thereupon left
Leipzig and took his doctorate at the University of Altdorf in
Nuremberg. He then entered the diplomatic service, first for the elector
of Mainz, then for the Brunswick family, and finally for the
Hanoverians, whom he served for forty years. Among the electors of
Hanover whom Leibniz served was the future (1714) King George I of
England. As an influential governmental representative, Leibniz traveled
widely.</p>
<p>In 1672, he went to Paris, where he met Huygens, who suggested that
if he wished to become a mathematician, he should read Pascal’s
treatises of 1658 1659.</p>
<p>In 1673, a political mission took him to London, where he bought a
copy of Barrow’s Lectiones geometricae, met Oldenburg and Collins, and
became a member of the Royal Society. It is largely around this visit
that the later quarrel over priority centered, for Leibniz could have
seen Newton’s De Analysi in manuscript. It is doubtful, however, that at
this</p>
<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</p>
<p>stage he would have derived much from it, for Leibniz was not yet
well prepared in geometry or analysis. In 1676, Leibniz again visited
London, bringing with him his calculating machine; it was during these
years between his two London visits that the differential calculus had
taken shape.</p>
<h4 id="infinite-series-2">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>As was the case with Newton, infinite series played a large role in
the early work of Leibniz. Huygens had set him the problem of finding
the sum of the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, that is, 2/n(n11).
Leibniz cleverly wrote each term as the sum of two fractions, using</p>
<p>2 1 1</p>
<p>52 2</p>
<p>nðn11Þ n n11</p>
<p>from which it is obvious, on writing out a few terms, that the sum of
the first n terms is</p>
<p>1 1</p>
<p>22 ;</p>
<p>1 n11</p>
<p>hence that the sum of the infinite series is 2. From this success, he
ingenuously concluded that he would be able to find the sum of almost
any infinite series.</p>
<p>The summation of series again came up in the harmonic triangle, whose
analogies with the arithmetic (Pascal) triangle fascinated Leibniz.</p>
<p>In the arithmetic triangle, each element (that is not in the first
column) is the difference of the two terms directly below it and to the
left; in the harmonic triangle, each term (that is not in the first row)
is the difference of the two terms directly above it and to the right.
Moreover, in the arithmetic triangle, each element (not in the first row
or column) is the sum of all of the terms in the line above it and to
the left, whereas in the harmonic triangle, each element is the sum of
all of the terms in the line below it and to the right. The series in
the first line is the harmonic series, which diverges; for all other
lines, the series converge. The numbers in the second line are one-half
the reciprocals of the triangular numbers, and Leibniz knew that the sum
of this series is 1. The numbers in the third line are one-third the
reciprocals of the pyramidal numbers</p>
<p>nðn11Þðn12Þ</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>1U2U3</p>
<p>and the harmonic triangle indicates that the sum of this series is ;
and so on, for the succeeding rows in the harmonic triangle. The numbers
in the nth diagonal row in this triangle are the reciprocals of the
numbers in the corresponding nth diagonal row of the arithmetic triangle
divided by n.</p>
<p>From his studies on infinite series and the harmonic triangle,
Leibniz turned to reading Pascal’s works on the cycloid and other
aspects of infinitesimal analysis. In particular, it was on reading the
letter of Amos Dettonville on Traite´ des sinus du quart de cercle that
Leibniz reported that a light burst on him. He then realized, in about
1673, that the determination of the tangent to a curve depended on the
ratio of the differences in the ordinates and the abscissas, as these
became infinitely small, and that quadratures depended on the sum of the
ordinates or infinitely thin rectangles making up the area. Just as in
the arithmetic and harmonic triangles the processes of summing and
differencing are oppositely related, so also in geometry the quadrature
and tangent problems, depending on sums and differences, respectively,
are inverses of each other. The connecting link seemed to be through the
infinitesimal or “characteristic” triangle, for where Pascal had used it
to find the quadrature of sines, Barrow had applied it to the tangent
problem. A comparison of the triangle in Barrow’s diagram (Fig. 16.1)
with that in Pascal’s figure (Fig. 16.3) will disclose the marked
similarity that evidently struck Leibniz so forcibly. If EDE is tangent
at D to the unit quarter circle BDC (Fig. 16.3), then,
Pascalsaw,ADistoDIasEEistoRR or EK. For a very small interval RR, the
line EE can be considered to be virtually the same as the arc of the
circle intercepted between the ordinates ER. Hence, in the notation that
Leibniz developed a few years later, we have 1/sinθ5dθ/dx, where θ is
the angle DAC. Because sinθ5p12cos2θ and cosθ5x, we have dθ5dx=p12x2. By
the square-root algorithm and long division (or by the binomial theorem
that Newton communicated to Leibniz, through Oldenburg, in 1676), it
is</p>
<p>a simple matter to find dθ5ð11x2=2138x4 1165 x6 1 Þdx. By use of the
usual method of quadratures, as found in Gregory and Mercator, one
obtains arcsin x5x1x3 /613x5 /4015x7 /1121 (or, allowing for the
negative slope and the constant of integration, arccos x5π/22 x2x3
/623x5 /4025x7 /1122 ). Newton, too, had arrived at this result earlier
and by a similar method. From this, it was possible to find the
seriesforsinxbytheprocessknownasreversion,aschemeapparentlyfirst used by
Newton but rediscovered by Leibniz. If we let y5arcsinx or x5siny and
for x assume a power series of the form x5a1y1a2y2 1a3y3 1 1anyn 1 ,
then, on replacing each x in the power series for arcsin x by this
series in y, we have an identity in y. From this, the quantities a1, a2,
a3,…, an,…are determined by equating coefficients of terms of like
degree. The resulting series, sin y5y2y3 /3!1 y5 /5!2 2 , was therefore
known to both Newton and Leibniz, and2 through sin y1cos y51, the series
for cosy was obtained. The quotient of the sine and cosine series

<p>The Differential Calculus</p>
<p>By 1676, Leibniz had arrived at the same conclusion that Newton had
reached several years earlier, namely, that he was in possession of a
method that was highly important because of its generality. Whether a
function was rational or irrational, algebraic or transcendental (a word
that Leibniz coined), his operations of finding sums and differences
could always be applied. It therefore was incumbent on him to develop an
appropriate language and notation for the new subject. Leibniz always
had a keen appreciation of the importance of good notations as a help to
thought, and his choice in the case of the calculus was especially
happy. After some trial and error, he fixed on dx and dy for the
smallest possible differences (differentials) in x and y, although,
initially, he had used instead x/d and y/d to indicate the lowering of
the degree. At first, he wrote simply omn. y (or “all y’s”) for the sum
later Ð ydx, the integral sign being an enlarged letter s for sum.
FindingÐ of the ordinates under a curve, but later he used the symbol y
and still</p>
<p>tangents called for the use of the calculus differentialis, and
finding quadratures required the calculus summatorius or the calculus
integralis; from these phrases arose our words “differential calculus”
and “integral calculus.”</p>
<p>The first account of the differential calculus was published by
Leibniz in 1684 under the long but significant title of Nova Methodus
pro Maximis et Minimis, itemque Tangentibus, qua nec Irrationales
Quantitates Moratur (A New Method for Maxima and Minima, and Also for
Tangents, which Is Not Obstructed by Irrational Quantities). Here
Leibniz gave the formulas dxy5x dy1y dx, d(x/y)5(y dx2x dy)/y2, and dxn
5nxn 1 dx for products, quotients, and powers (or roots), together with
geometric applications. These formulas were derived by neglecting
infinitesimals of higher order. If, for example, the smallest
differences in x and y are dx and dy, respectively, then dxy or the
smallest difference in xy is (x1dx) (y1dy)2xy. Inasmuch as dx and dy are
infinitely small, the term dx dy is infinitely infinitely small and can
be disregarded, giving the result dxy5x dy1y dx.</p>
<p>Two years later, again in the Acta Eruditorum, Leibniz published an
explanation of the integral calculus in which quadratures are shown to
be special cases of the inverse method of tangents. Here Leibniz
emphasized the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration in the fundamental theorem of the calculus; he pointed out
that in the integration of familiar functions “is included the greatest
part of all transcendental geometry.” Where Descartes’ geometry had once
excluded all nonalgebraic curves, the calculus of Newton and Leibniz
showed how essential is the role of these in their new analysis. Were
one to exclude transcendental functions from the new analysis, there
would be no integrals of such algebraic functions as 1/x or 1/(11x2).
Moreover, Leibniz seems to have appreciated, as did Newton, that the
operations in the new analysis can be applied to infinite series, as
well as to finite algebraic expressions. In this respect, Leibniz was
less cautious than Newton, for he argued that the infinite series
l2l1l2l112 is equal to . In the light of recent work on divergent
series, we cannot say that it is necessarily “wrong” to assign the “sum”
in this case. It is nevertheless clear that Leibniz allowed himself to
be carried away by the very success of his algorithms and was not
deterred by uncertainty over concepts. Newton’s reasoning was far closer
to the modern foundations of the calculus than was that of Leibniz, but
the plausibility of the Leibnizian view and the effectiveness of the
differential notation made for a readier acceptance of differentials
than of fluxions.</p>
<p>Newton and Leibniz both developed their new analysis rapidly to
include differentials and fluxions of higher order, as in the case of
the formula for curvature of a curve at a point. It probably was lack of
clarity on Leibniz’s part about higher orders of infinitesimals that led
him to the mistaken conclusion that an osculating circle has four
“consecutive” or coincident points of contact with a curve, rather than
the three that determine the circle of curvature.</p>
<p>The formula for the nth derivative (to use the modern language) of a
product, (uv)(n) 5u(n)v(0) 1nu(n 1)v(1) 1 1nu(1)v(n 1) 1n u(0)v(n), a
development paralleling the binomial expansion of (u 1v) , bears the
name of Leibniz. (In the Leibnizian theorem, the exponents in
parentheses indicate orders of differentiation, rather than powers.)
Also named for Leibniz is the rule, given in a memoir of 1692, for
finding the envelope of a one-parameter family of plane curves f(x, y,
c) 50 through the elimination of c from the simultaneous equations f 50
and fc 5 0, where fc is the result of differentiating f partially with
respect to c.</p>
<p>The name of Leibniz is also usually attached to the infinite series
π=45 2121 , one of his first discoveries in mathematics. This series,
which arose in his quadrature of the circle, is only a special case of
the arctangent expansion that had been given earlier by Gregory. The
fact that Leibniz was virtually self-taught in mathematics accounts in
part for the frequent cases of rediscovery that appear in his work.</p>
<p>Determinants, Notations, and Imaginary Numbers</p>
<p>Leibniz’s great contribution to mathematics was the calculus, but
other aspects of his work deserve mention. The generalization of the
binomial theorem to the multinomial theorem—the expansion of such
expressions as (x1y1z)n—is attributed to him, as is also the first
reference in the Western world to the method of determinants. In
Leibniz’s letters to G. F. A. de L’Hospital in 1693, he wrote that he
occasionally used numbers indicating rows and columns in a set of
simultaneous equations:</p>

<p>Leibniz’s anticipation of determinants went unpublished until 1850
and had to be rediscovered more than half a century later.</p>
<p>Leibniz was very conscious of the power in analysis of
“characteristic” or notation that properly displays the elements of a
given situation. Evidently, he thought highly of this contribution to
notation because of its easy generalization, and he boasted that he
showed that “Vie`te and Descartes hadn’t yet discovered all the
mysteries” of analysis. Leibniz was, in fact, one of the greatest of all
notation builders, being second only to Euler in this respect. It was in
large part due to Leibniz and Newton that the 5 sign of Recorde
triumphed over the symbol of Descartes. To Leibniz, we also owe the
symbols B for “is similar to” and ’ for “is congruent to.” Nevertheless,
Leibniz’s symbols for differentials and integrals remain his greatest
triumphs in the field of notation.</p>
<p>Among relatively minor contributions by Leibniz were his comments on
complex numbers, at a time when they were almost forgotten, and his
noting of the binary system of numeration. He factored x4 1a4 into</p>
<p>ðx1app21Þðx 2 app21Þðx1ap2 2p 1Þðx2ap2 2p 1Þ and he showed that p65
11 2p 31 12 2p 3, an imaginary decomposition of a positive real number
that surprised his contemporaries.p p</p>
<p>Yet Leibniz did not write the square roots of complex numbers in
standard complex form, nor was he able to prove his conjecture that fðx1
2p 1yÞ1fðx 2 2p 1yÞ is real if f(z) is a real polynomial. The ambivalent
status of complex numbers is well illustrated by the remark of Leibniz,
who was also a prominent theologian, that imaginary numbers are a sort
of amphibian, halfway between existence and nonexistence, resembling in
this respect the Holy Ghost in Christian theology. His theology obtruded
itself again in his view of the binary system in arithmetic (in which
only two symbols, unity and zero, are used) as a symbol of the creation
in which God, represented by unity, drew all things from nothingness. He
was so pleased with the idea that he wrote about it to the Jesuits, who
had missionaries in China, hoping that they might use the analogy to
convert the scientifically inclined Chinese emperor to Christianity.</p>
<p>The Algebra of Logic</p>
<p>Leibniz was a philosopher, as well as a mathematician; his most
significant mathematical contribution, other than the calculus, was in
logic. In the calculus, it was the element of universality that
impressed him, and so it was with his other efforts. He hoped to reduce
all things to order. To reduce logical discussions to systematic form,
he wished to develop a universal characteristic that would serve as a
sort of algebra of logic. His first mathematical paper had been a thesis
on combinatorial analysis in 1666, and even at this early date, he had
visions of a formal symbolic logic. Universal symbols or ideograms were
to be introduced for the small number of fundamental concepts needed in
thought, and composite ideas were to be made up from this “alphabet” of
human thoughts, just as formulas are developed in mathematics. The
syllogism itself was to be reduced to a sort of calculus expressed in a
universal symbolism intelligible in all languages. Truth and error would
then be simply a matter of correct or erroneous calculation within the
system, and there would be an end to philosophical controversies.
Moreover, new discoveries could be derived through correct but more or
less routine operations on the symbols, according to the rules of the
logical calculus. Leibniz was justifiably proud of this idea, but his
own enthusiasm for it was not matched by that of others. Leibniz’s
optimism today appears to have been unwarranted, but his suggestion of
an algebra of logic developed in his own thinking over the years and was
revived in the nineteenth century. Since then, it has played a very
significant role in mathematics.</p>
<p>Leibniz as Scientist and Supporter of Science</p>
<p>Leibniz was also a scientist, and he and Huygens developed the notion
of kinetic energy, which ultimately, in the nineteenth century, became
part of the broader concept of energy in general—one that Leibniz would
most certainly have applauded for its universality. Among his general
contributions to the progress of science and mathematics in the
eighteenth century, his impact on the establishment of two major
scientific academies of Europe cannot be underrated. These were the
Prussian Academy of Science, founded in Berlin in 1710, and the Russian
Academy, founded during the decade after Leibniz’s death.</p>
<p>The Bernoulli Family</p>
<p>The discoveries of a great mathematician do not automatically become
part of the mathematical tradition. They may be lost to the world unless
other scholars understand them and take enough interest to look at them
from various points of view, clarify and generalize them, and point out
their implications. Newton, unfortunately, was hypersensitive and did
not communicate freely, and, consequently, the method of fluxions was
not well known outside of England. Leibniz, on the other hand, appeared
to take pleasure in alerting others to the power of his methods and
found devoted disciples who were eager to learn about the differential
and the integral calculus and to transmit the knowledge further.
Foremost among the enthusiasts were two Swiss brothers, Jacques
Bernoulli (1654 1705) and Jean Bernoulli (1667 1748), who were often
also known by the Anglicized forms of their names, James and John (or by
the German equivalents Jakob and Johann); each was as quick to offend as
to feel offended. No family in the history of mathematics has produced
as many celebrated mathematicians as did the Bernoulli family, which,
unnerved by the Spanish Fury in 1576, had fled to Basel from the
Catholic Spanish Netherlands in 1583. Some dozen members of the family
(see the genealogical chart further on) achieved distinction in
mathematics and physics, and four of them were elected foreign
associates of the Acade´mie des Sciences.</p>
<p>The first to attain prominence in mathematics was Jacques Bernoulli.
He was born and died in Basel, but he traveled widely to meet scholars
in other countries. His interest had been directed toward infinitesimals
by works of Wallis and Barrow, and the papers of Leibniz in 1684 1686
enabled him to master the new methods. By 1690, when he suggested the
name “integral” to Leibniz, Jacques Bernoulli was himself contributing
papers on the subject to the Acta Eruditorum. Among other things, he
pointed out that at a maximum or minimum point, the derivative of the
function need not vanish but can take on an “infinite value” or assume
an indeterminate form. Early on, he was interested in infinite series,
and in his first paper on the subject in 1689, he gave the well-known
“Bernoulli inequality” (1 1x)n .1 1nx, where x is real and x .21 and x
6¼ 0 and n is an integer greater than 1, but this can be found earlier
in the seventh lecture of Barrow’s Lectiones geometriae of 1670. To him
is frequently also attributed the demonstration that the harmonic series
is divergent, for most men were unaware of anticipations by Oresme and
Mengoli. Jacques Bernoulli believed, in fact, that his brother had been
the first to observe the divergence of the harmonic series.</p>
<p>The mathematical Bernoullis: a genealogical chart</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by the series of reciprocals of the
figurate numbers, and although he knew that the series of reciprocals of
the perfect squares is convergent, he was unable to find the sum of the
series. Inasmuch as the terms of</p>
<p>1 1 1 1</p>
<p>1 1 2 1 1 2 1</p>
<p>3 n</p>
<p>are, term for term, less than or equal to those of</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1 ð Þ 1 1 1U2 2U3 3U4 n n21</p>
<p>and the latter series was known to converge to 2, it was clear to
Bernoulli that the former must converge.</p>
<p>A frequent correspondent with other mathematicians of the day,
Jacques Bernoulli was au courant with the popular problems, many of
which he solved independently. Among these were finding the equations of
the catenary, the tractrix, and the isochrone, all of which had been
treated by Huygens and Leibniz. The isochrone called for the equation of
a plane curve along which an object would fall with uniform vertical
velocity, and Bernoulli showed that the required curve is the
semicubical parabola. It was in connection with such problems that the
Bernoulli brothers discovered the power of the calculus, and they
remained in touch with Leibniz on all aspects of the new subject.
Jacques Bernoulli, in his work on the isochrone in the Acta Eruditorum
for 1690, used the word “integral,” and a few years later, Leibniz
agreed that calculus integralis would be a better name than calculus
summatorius for the inverse of the calculus differentialis. To
differential equations, Jacques Bernoulli contributed the study of the
“Bernoulli equation” yu 1P(x)y 5Q(x)yn that he and Leibniz and Jean
Bernoulli solved—Jean by reducing it to a linear equation through the
substitution z 5y1 n. Leibniz and the Bernoullis were seeking a solution
to the brachistochrone problem. Jean had first found an incorrect proof
that the curve is a cycloid, but after he challenged his brother to
discover the required curve, Jacques correctly proved that the curve
sought is a cycloid.</p>
<p>The Logarithmic Spiral</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli was fascinated by curves and the calculus, and one
curve bears his name—the “lemniscate of Bernoulli,” given by the polar
equation r2 5a cos 2θ. The curve was described in the Acta Eruditorum of
1694 as resembling a figure eight or a knotted ribbon (lemniscus). Yet
the curve that most caught his fancy was the logarithmic spiral.
Bernoulli showed that it had several striking properties not noted
earlier: (1) the evolute of a logarithmic spiral is an equal logarithmic
spiral; (2) the pedal curve of a logarithmic spiral with respect to its
pole (that is, the locus of the projections of the pole on the tangents
to the given curve) is an equal logarithmic spiral; (3) the caustic by
reflection for rays emanating from the pole (that is, the envelope of
the rays reflected at points on the given curve) is an equal logarithmic
spiral; and (4) the caustic by refraction for rays emanating from the
pole (that is, the envelope of rays refracted at points on the curve) is
an equal logarithmic spiral. These properties led him to request that
the spira mirabilis be engraved on his tombstone, together with the
inscription “Eadem mutata resurgo” (“Though changed, I arise again the
same”).</p>
<p>Jacques Bernoulli had been led to spirals of a different type when he
repeated Cavalieri’s procedure in bending half of the parabola x2 5ay
about the origin to produce a spiral of Archimedes, but whereas
Cavalieri had studied the transformation by essentially synthetic
methods, Bernoulli used rectangular and polar coordinates. Newton had
used polar coordinates earlier—perhaps as early as 1671—but priority in
publication seems to go to Bernoulli, who in the Acta Eruditorum for
1691 proposed measuring abscissas along the arc of a fixed circle and
ordinates radially along the normals. Three years later, in the same
journal, he proposed a modification that agreed with the system of
Newton. The coordinate y now was the length of the radius vector of the
point, and x was the arc cut off by the sides of the vectorial angle on
a circle of radius a described about the pole as center. These
coordinates are essentially what we would now write as (r, aθ).
Bernoulli,likeNewton,wasinterestedprimarilyinapplicationsofthesystem to
the calculus; hence, he, too, derived formulas for arc length and radius
of curvature in polar coordinates.</p>
<p>Probability and Infinite Series</p>
<p>The mathematical contributions of the Bernoullis, like those of
Leibniz, are found chiefly in articles in journals, especially the Acta
Eruditorum, but Jacques Bernoulli also wrote a classical treatise titled
Ars Conjectandi (or Art of Conjecturing), published in 1713, eight years
after the author’s death. This is the earliest substantial volume on the
theory of probability, for Huygens’s De Ludo Aleae had been only a brief
introduction. The treatise of Huygens is, in fact, reproduced as the
first of the four parts of the Ars Conjectandi, together with a
commentary by Bernoulli. The second part of the Ars Conjectandi includes
a general theory of permutations and combinations, facilitated by the
binomial and multinomial theorems. Here we find the first adequate proof
of the binomial theorem for positive integral powers. The proof is by
mathematical induction, a method of approach that Bernoulli had
rediscovered while reading the Arithmetica Infinitorum of Wallis and
that he had published in the Acta Eruditorum in 1686. He gave Pascal
credit for the binomial theorem with general exponent, but this
attribution appears to be gratuitous. Newton seems to have first stated
the theorem in general form for any rational exponent, although he gave
no proof, this being supplied later by Euler. In connection with the
expansion of (1 11/n)n, Jacques Bernoulli proposed the problem of the
continuous compounding of interest, that is, finding limn-Nð111=nÞn,
because</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>!</p>
<p>1 1 1 1</p>

<p>11 1</p>
<p>,1111 1 2 1 n 1 , 3</p>
<p>22 2</p>
<p>it was clear to him that the limit existed.</p>
<p>The second part of the Ars Conjectandi also contains the “Bernoulli
numbers.” These arose as coefficients in a recursion formula for the
sums of the powers of the integers, and they now find many applications
in other connections. The formula was written by Bernoulli as
follows:</p>
<p>1 1 c c c 2 1 c 2 2 c11 2 2 2U3U4</p>
<p>nc 5 nc11 1 nc 1 Anc1 1 ð Þð ÞBnc3</p>
<p>1ð Þð Þð Þð ÞCnc5 ; c c 2 1 c 2 2 c 2 3 c 2 4</p>
<p>2U 3 U 4 U 5 U 6</p>
<p>and the lettersÐ c A, B, C, … (the Bernoulli numbers) are the
coefficients of2 4 where n means the sum of the cth powers of the first
n positive integers Ð n6,… (The numbers can also be defined as n! times
thecoefficients of theÐ Ð the term in n (the last term) in the
corresponding expressions for n , n ,</p>
<p>even-powered terms in the Maclaurin expansion of the function x/(ex
21).) The Bernoulli numbers are useful in writing the infinite series
expansions of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The first three of
the numbers are readily verified as A5, B52, and C 5.</p>
<p>The third and fourth parts of the Ars Conjectandi are devoted
primarily to problems illustrating the theory of probability. The fourth
and last part contains the celebrated theorem that now bears the
author’s name and on which Bernoulli and Leibniz had corresponded: the
so-called law of large numbers. This states that if p is the probability
of an event, if m is the number of occurrences of the event in n trials,
if ε is an arbitrarily small positive number, and if P is the
probability that the inequality jm=n2pj,ε is satisfied, then
limn-NP51.</p>
<p>Appended to the Ars Conjectandi is a long memoir on infinite series.
Besides the harmonic series and the sum of the reciprocals of the
perfect squares, Bernoulli considered the series</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 p 1 :</p>
<p>1 2 3 4</p>
<p>He knew (by comparing the terms with those in the harmonic series)
that this diverges, and he pointed to the paradox that the ratio of the
“sum” of all of the odd terms to the “sum” of all of the even terms is
as p221 is to 1, from which the sum of all of the odd terms appears to
be less than the sum of all of the even terms, but this is impossible
because, term for term, the former are larger than the latter.</p>
<p>L’Hospital’s Rule</p>
<p>While Jean Bernoulli was in Paris in 1692, he instructed a young
French marquis, G. F. A. de L’Hospital (1661 1704), in the new
Leibnizian discipline, and Jean Bernoulli signed a pact under which, in
return for a regular salary, he agreed to send L’Hospital his
discoveries in mathematics, to be used as the marquis might wish. The
result was that one of Bernoulli’s chief contributions, dating from
1694, has ever since been known as L’Hospital’s rule on indeterminate
forms. Jean Bernoulli had found that if f(x) and g(x) are functions
differentiable at x5a such that f(a)50 and g(a)50 and</p>
<p>f 0ðxÞ</p>
<p>lim</p>
<p>x-a g0ðxÞ</p>
<p>exists, then</p>
<p>fðxÞ f 0ðxÞ lim5 lim: x-a gðxÞ x-a g0ðxÞ</p>
<p>This well-known rule was incorporated by L’Hospital in the first
textbook on the differential calculus to appear in print—Analyse des
infiniment petits, published in Paris in 1696. This book, the influence
of which dominated most of the eighteenth century, is based on two
postulates: (1) that one can take as equal two quantities that differ
only by an infinitely small quantity; and (2) that a curve can be
considered as made up of infinitely small straight line segments that
determine, by the angles they make with each other, the curvature of the
curve. These would today scarcely be regarded as acceptable, but
L’Hospital considered them “so self-evident as not to leave the least
scruple about their truth and certainty on the mind of an attentive
reader.” The basic differential formulas for algebraic functions are
derived in the manner of Leibniz, and applications are made to tangents,
maxima and minima, points of inflection, curvature, caustics, and
indeterminate forms. L’Hospital was an exceptionally effective writer,
for his Traite´ analytique des sections coniques, published posthumously
in 1707, did for analytic geometry of the eighteenth century what the
Analyse did for the calculus.</p>
<p>Exponential Calculus</p>
<p>The recent publication of the Bernoulli-L’Hospital correspondence
indicates that much of the work evidently was due to Bernoulli.
Nevertheless, some of the material in the Analyse was undoubtedly the
result of L’Hospital’s independent work, for he was a capable
mathematician. The rectification of the logarithmic curve, for example,
seems to have appeared for the first time in 1692 in a letter from
L’Hospital to Leibniz. Bernoulli did not publish his own textbook on the
differential calculus (which was finally printed in 1924), and the text
on the integral calculus appeared fifty years after it had been
written—in his Opera Omnia of 1742. In the interval, Jean Bernoulli
wrote prolifically on many advanced aspects of analysis—the isochrone,
solids of least resistance, the catenary, the tractrix, trajectories,
caustic curves, isoperimetric problems—achieving a reputation that led
to his being called to Basel in 1705 to fill the chair left vacant by
his brother’s death. He is frequently regarded as the inventor of the
calculus of variations, because of his proposal in 1696 1697 of the
problem of the brachistochrone, and he contributed to differential
geometry through his work on geodesic lines on a surface. To him is also
often ascribed the exponential calculus, for he studied not only the
simple exponential curves y5ax, but general exponentials such as y5xx.
For the area under the curve y5xx from x50 to x51, he found the striking
infinite series representation</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>2 1 2 4 1 :</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>This result he obtained by writing xx 5exlnx, expanding this in the
exponential series, and integrating term by term, using integration by
parts.</p>
<p>Logarithms of Negative Numbers</p>
<p>Jean and Jacques Bernoulli rediscovered the series for sin nθ and cos
nθ, in terms of sin θ and cos θ, which Vie`te had known, and they
extended them, uncritically, to include fractional values of n. Jean was
also aware of relationships between inverse trigonometric functions and
imaginary logarithms, discovering in 1702, through differential
equations, the relationship</p>
<p>arctan z5 lnr : 1 11iz i 12iz</p>
<p>He corresponded with other mathematicians on the logarithms of
negative numbers, but here he mistakenly believed that log (2n)5log
n. He tended to develop trigonometry and the theory of logarithms from
an analytic point of view, and he experimented with several notations
for a function of x, the one nearest to the modern being φx. His vague
notion of a function was expressed as “a quantity composed in any manner
of a variable and any constants.” Among his numerous controversies was
one with British mathematicians over whether the well-known series of
Brook Taylor (1685 1731), published in the Methodus incrementorum of
1715, was a plagiarism of the Bernoulli series</p>
<p>x2 dy x3 d2y ydx5yx 2 1 2 2 :</p>
<p>2! dx 3! dx</p>
<p>Neither Bernoulli nor Taylor was aware that both had been anticipated
by Gregory in the discovery of “Taylor’s series.”</p>
<p>Petersburg Paradox</p>
<p>Jean Bernoulli maintained a zeal for mathematics as lively as was his
persistence in controversy. Moreover, he was the father of three sons,
Nicolaus (1695 1726), Daniel (1700 1782), and Jean II (1710 1790), all
of whom at some stage filled a position as professor of mathematics:
Nicolaus and Daniel at St. Petersburg and Daniel and Jean II at Basel.
(Another Nicolaus (1687 1759), a cousin of the one mentioned previously,
for a time held the chair in mathematics at Padua that Galileo once had
filled.) There were still other Bernoullis who attained some eminence in
mathematics, but of these, none achieved fame comparable to that of the
original two brothers, Jacques and Jean. The most celebrated of the
younger generation was Daniel, whose work in hydrodynamics is recalled
in “Bernoulli’s principle.” In mathematics, he is best known for his
distinction, in the theory of probability, between mathematical
expectation and “moral expectation,” or between “physical fortune” and
“moral fortune.” He assumed that a small increase in a person’s material
means causes an increase in satisfaction that is inversely proportional
to the means. In the form of an equation, dm5K(dp/p), where m is the
moral fortune, p is the physical fortune, and K is a constant of
proportionality. This leads to the conclusion that as the physical
fortune increases geometrically, the moral fortune increases
arithmetically. In 1734, he and his father shared the prize offered by
the Acade´mie des Sciences for an essay on probabilities related to the
inclinations of the orbital planes of the planets; in 1760, he read to
the Paris Acade´mie a paper on the application of probability theory to
the question of the advantage of inoculation against smallpox.</p>
<p>When Daniel Bernoulli went to St. Petersburg in 1725, his older
brother was also called there as professor of mathematics; in the
discussions of the two men, there arose a problem that has come to be
known as the “Petersburg paradox,” probably because it first appeared in
the Commentarii of the Academy there. The problem is as follows: Suppose
that Peter and Paul agree to play a game based on the toss of a coin. If
a head is thrown on the first toss, Paul will give Peter one crown; if
the first toss is a tail, but a head appears on the second toss, Paul
will give Peter two crowns; if a head appears for the first time on the
third toss, Paul will give Peter four crowns, and so on, the amount to
be paid if head appears for the first time on the nth toss being 2n 1
crowns. What should Peter pay Paul for the privilege of playing the
game? Peter’s mathematical expectation, given by</p>
<p>12 1 n 1</p>
<p>U11 U21 3 U2 1 1 n U2 1 ;</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>evidently is infinite, yet common sense suggests a very modest finite
sum. When Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707 1788), made an
empirical test of the matter, he found that in 2084 games Paul would
have paid Peter 10,057 crowns. This indicates that for any one game,
Paul’s expectation, instead of being infinite, is actually something
less than 5 crowns! The paradox raised in the Petersburg problem was
widely discussed during the eighteenth century, with differing
explanations being given. Daniel Bernoulli sought to resolve it through
his principle of moral expectation, in accordance with which he replaced
the amounts 1, 2, 22, 23,…2n,…by 11=2;21=4;41=8;81=16;…. Others
preferred, as a solution of the paradox, to point out that the problem
is inherently impossible in view of the fact that Paul’s fortune is
necessarily finite; hence, he could not pay the unlimited sums that
might be required in the case of a long delay in the appearance of a
head.</p>
<h4 id="tschirnhaus-transformations">Tschirnhaus Transformations</h4>
<p>Continental Europe had not escaped controversy over the foundations
of the calculus, but there the effect was felt less than in England. As
early as in Leibniz’s day, objections to the new analysis had been
raised by a Saxon nobleman, Count Ehrenfried Walter von Tschirnhaus
(1651 1708). His name is still perpetuated in the “Tschirnhaus
transformations” in algebra, by which he hoped to find a general method
for solving equations of higher degree. A Tschirnhaus transformation of
a polynomial equation f(x)50 is one of the form y5g(x)/h(x), where g and
h are polynomials and h does not vanish for a root of f(x)50. The
transformations by which Cardan and Vie`te solved the cubic were special
cases of such transformations. In the Acta Eruditorum of 1683,
Tschirnhaus (or Tschirnhausen) showed that a polynomial of degree n.2
can be reduced by his transformations to a form in which the
coefficients of the terms of degrees n21 and n22 are both zero; for the
cubic, he found a transformation of the form y5x2 1ax1b, which reduced
the general cubic to the form y3 5K.</p>
<p>Another such transformation reduced the quartic to y4 1py2 1q50, thus
adding new methods of solving the cubic and the quartic.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus hoped to develop similar algorithms that would reduce the
general equation of nth degree to a “pure” equation of nth degree
containing only the terms of degree n and degree zero. His
transformations constituted the most promising contribution to the
solution of equations during the seventeenth century, but his
elimination of the second and third coefficients by means of such
transformations was far from adequate for the solution of the quintic.
Even when the Swedish mathematician E. S. Bring (1736 1798) showed in
1786 that a</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus transformation can be found that reduces the general
quintic to the form y5 1py1q50, the solution still remained elusive. In
1834,</p>
<p>S olid Anal y t ic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>G. B. Jerrard (1804 1863), a Briton, showed that a Tschirnhaus
transformation can be found that will eliminate the terms of degrees n21
and n22 and n23 from any polynomial equation of degree n.3, but the
power of the method is limited by the fact that equations of the fifth
and higher degree are not solvable algebraically. Jerrard’s belief that
he could solve all algebraic equations was illusory.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus is noted as the discoverer of caustics by reflection
(catacaustics), which bear his name. It was his report on these curves,
the envelopes of a family of rays from a point source and reflected in a
curve, that resulted in his election in 1682 to the Paris Acade´mie des
Sciences, and interest in caustics and similar families was continued by
Leibniz, L’Hospital, Jacques and Jean Bernoulli, and others. His name is
also attached to the “Tschirnhaus cubic” a5rcos3θ/3, a form later
generalized by Maclaurin to rn 5a cosnθ for n rational.</p>
<p>Tschirnhaus had been in touch with Oldenburg and Leibniz during the
formative years of the calculus, and he had also contributed many
mathematical articles to the Acta Eruditorum after its establishment in
1682. Some of Tschirnhaus’s work, however, was hastily composed and
published prematurely, and the Bernoulli brothers and others pointed out
errors. At one point, Tschirnhaus rejected the basic concepts of the
calculus and of infinite series, insisting that algebraic methods would
suffice. In Holland, objections to the calculus of Leibniz had been
raised in 1694 1696 by the physician and geometer Bernard Nieuwentijt
(1654 1718). In three separate treatises published during these years in
Amsterdam, he admitted the correctness of the results, but he criticized
the vagueness of Newton’s evanescent quantities and the lack of clear
definition in Leibniz’s differentials of higher order.</p>
<p>Solid Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>In 1695, Leibniz had defended himself in the Acta Eruditorum from his
“overprecise” critic, and in 1701, a more detailed refutation of
Nieuwentijt came from Switzerland from the pen of Jacob Hermann (1678
1733), a devoted pupil of Jacques Bernoulli. Illustrating the mobility
of mathematicians during the early eighteenth century, Hermann taught
mathematics at the Universities of Padua, Frankfort on the Oder, and
St. Petersburg before concluding his career at the University of Basel,
his hometown. In the Commentarii Academiae Petropolitanae for the years
1729 1733, Hermann made contributions to solid analytic geometry and to
polar coordinates in continuation of results made by the older Bernoulli
brothers. Where Jacques Bernoulli had rather hesitantly applied polar
coordinates to spirals, Hermann gave polar equations of algebraic curves
as well, together with equations of transformation from rectangular to
polar coordinates. Hermann’s use of space coordinates was also bolder
than that of Jean Bernoulli, who as early as 1692 had first referred to
the use of coordinates as “Cartesian geometry.” Bernoulli had rather
timidly suggested an extension of Cartesian geometry to three
dimensions, but Hermann effectively applied space coordinates to planes
and several types of quadratic surfaces. He made a beginning in the use
of direction angles by showing that the sine of the angle that the plane
az1by1cx5c2 makes with the xy-plane is given by pb2 1c2=pa2 1b2 1c2.</p>
<p>Michel Rolle and PierreVarignon</p>
<p>In France, as well as in England, Germany, and Holland, there was a
group in the Acade´mie des Sciences, especially shortly after 1700, that
questioned the validity of the new infinitesimal methods as presented by
L’Hospital. Among these was Michel Rolle (1652 1719), whose name is
recalled in connection with Rolle’s theorem, published in 1691 in an
obscure book on geometry and algebra titled Me´thode pour re´soudre les
e´galite´z: If a function is differentiable in the interval from a to b,
and if f(a)505f(b), then fu(x)50 has at least one real root between a
and b. The theorem, now so important in the calculus, was given only
incidentally by Rolle in connection with an approximate solution of
equations.</p>
<p>Rolle’s attack on the calculus, which he described as a collection of
ingenious fallacies, was answered vigorously by Pierre Varignon (1654
1722), Jean Bernoulli’s “best friend in France” and one who had also
been corresponding with Leibniz. Bernoulli simply told Rolle that he did
not understand the subject, but Varignon sought to clarify the situation
by showing indirectly that the infinitesimal methods could be reconciled
with the geometry of Euclid. Most of the group opposing the calculus
were admirers of the ancient synthetic geometry, and the controversy in
the Acade´mie des Sciences reminds one of the then contemporary literary
controversy on “ancients vs. moderns.”</p>
<p>Varignon, like the Bernoullis, had not at first expected to be a
mathematician, being intended for the church, but when he accidentally
came across a copy of Euclid’s Elements, he changed his mind and held
professorships in mathematics in Paris, becoming a member of the
Acade´mie. In the Memoirs of the Acade´mie des Sciences for 1704, he
continued and extended Jacques Bernoulli’s use of polar coordinates,
including an elaborate classification of spirals obtained from algebraic
curves, such as the parabolas and the hyperbolas of Fermat, by
interpreting the ordinate as a radius vector and the abscissa as a
vectorial arc. Varignon, one of the first French scholars to appreciate
the calculus, had prepared a commentary on L’Hospital’s Analyse, but
this appeared only in 1725, after both men had died, under the title
Eclaircissemens sur l’analyse des infiniments petits. Varignon was a
more careful writer than</p>
<p>T he C lairaut s</p>
<p>L’Hospital, and he warned that infinite series were not to be used
without investigation of the remainder term. Hence, he had been rather
worried about the attacks on the calculus, and in 1701, he had written
to Leibniz about his differences with Rolle:</p>
<p>The Abbe´ Galloys, who is really behind the whole thing, is spreading
the report here 〔in Paris〕 that you have explained that you mean by
the “differential” or the “infinitely small” a very small, but
nevertheless constant and definite, quantity….I, on the other hand, have
called a thing infinitely small, or the differential of a quantity, if
that quantity is inexhaustible in comparison with the thing.</p>
<p>The view that Varignon expressed here is far from clear, but at least
he recognized that a differential is a variable, rather than a constant.
Leibniz’s reply from Hanover in 1702 seeks to avoid metaphysical
quarrels, but his use of the phrase “incomparably small quantities” for
differentials was scarcely more satisfactory than Varignon’s
explanation. Varignon’s defense of the calculus nevertheless seems to
have won Rolle’s approval.</p>
<p>Rolle had also raised embarrassing questions about analytic geometry,
especially concerning the Cartesian graphical solution of equations, so
popular at the time. To solve f(x)50, for example, one arbitrarily chose
a curve g(x, y)50 and, on combining it with f(x)50, obtained a new curve
h(x, y)50 the intersections of which with g(x, y)50 furnish the
solutions of f(x)50. Rolle saw that extraneous solutions may be
introduced through this procedure. In his best-known work, the Traite´
d’alge`bre of 1690, Rolle seems to have been first to state that there
are n values for the nth root of a number, but he was able to prove this
only for n53, for he died before the relevant works of Cotes and De
Moivre appeared.</p>
<p>Rolle was the most capable mathematician in the group from the
Acade´mie des Sciences that criticized the calculus. When he was
convinced by Varignon of the essential soundness of the new analysis,
opposition collapsed, and the subject entered a century of unimpeded and
rapid development on the continent of Europe. An outstanding example of
how much a talented and dedicated member of a later generation could
achieve using the new methods is provided by Alexis Clairaut.</p>
<h4 id="the-clairauts">The Clairauts</h4>
<p>Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713 1765) was one of the most precocious of
mathematicians, outdoing even Blaise Pascal in this respect. At the age
of ten, he was reading the textbooks of L’Hospital on conics and the
calculus; when he was thirteen, he read a paper on geometry to the
Acade´mie des Sciences; and when only eighteen, he was admitted, through
special dispensation with respect to age requirements, to membership in
the Acade´mie. In the year of his election, Clairaut published a
celebrated treatise, Recherches sur les courbes
a<code>double courbure, the substance of which had been presented to the Acade´mie two years earlier. Like the Ge´ome´trie of Descartes, the Recherches of Clairaut appeared without the name of the author on the title page, although in this case, too, the authorship was generally known. The treatise of Clairaut carried out for space curves the program that Descartes had suggested almost a century earlier—their study through projections on two coordinate planes. It was, in fact, this method that suggested the name given by Clairaut to gauche or twisted curves, inasmuch as their curvature is determined by the curvatures of the two projections. In the Recherches, numerous space curves are determined through intersections of various surfaces, distance formulas for two and three dimensions are explicitly given, an intercept form of the plane is included, and tangent lines to space curves are found. This book by the teenage Clairaut constitutes the first treatise on solid analytic geometry. He observed that the mixed second-order partial derivatives fxy and fyx of a function f(x, y) are in general equal (we know now that this holds if these derivatives are continuous at the point in question), and he used this fact in the test My Nx, familiar in differential equations, for exactness of the differential expression M(x, y)dx1N(x, y)dy. In celebrated works on applied mathematics, such as The´orie de la figure de la terre (1743) and The´orie de la lune (1752), he made use of potential theory. His textbooks, Ele´ments de ge´ome´trie and Ele´ments d’alge</code>bre,
were part of a plan, reminiscent of those of our own day, to improve the
teaching of mathematics.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Clairaut had a younger brother who rivaled him in
precocity, for at the age of fifteen, the brother, known to history only
as “le cadet Clairaut,” published in 1731 (the same year as that in
which the older brother’s Recherches had appeared) a book on calculus
titled Traite´ de quadratures circulaires et hyperboliques. This
virtually unknown genius died tragically of smallpox during the next
year. The father of the two Clairaut brothers was himself a capable
mathematician, but today he is recalled primarily through the work of
his sons.</p>
<h4 id="mathematics-in-italy">Mathematics in Italy</h4>
<p>While the Bernoullis and their associates were defending and
espousing developments in analytic geometry, the calculus, and
probability, mathematics in Italy flowed along more or less
unobtrusively with some preference for geometry. No outstanding figure
appeared there, although several men left results important enough to be
noted. Giovanni Ceva</p>
<p>T he Parallel Po s tulat e</p>
<p>(1648 1734) is recalled today for the theorem that bears his name: A
necessary and sufficient condition that lines from the vertices A, B, C
of a triangle to points X, Y, Z on the opposite sides be concurrent is
that</p>
<p>AZUBXUCY 511:</p>
<p>ZBUXCUYA</p>
<p>This is closely related to the theorem of Menelaus, which had been
forgotten but was rediscovered and also published by Ceva in 1678.</p>
<p>More closely related to the interests of the Bernoullis were the
contributions of Jacopo Riccati (1676 1754), who made Newton’s work
known in Italy. Riccati is especially remembered for his extensive study
of the differential equation dy/dx5A(x)1B(x)y1C(x)y2, now bearing his
name, although Jacques Bernoulli had earlier studied the special case
dy/dx5x2 1y2. Riccati may have known of this study, for Nicolaus
Bernoulli taught at Padua, where Riccati had been a student of Angeli’s
and where Riccati came in contact with both Nicolaus Bernoulli and
Hermann. The work of the Bernoullis was well known in Italy. Count</p>
<p>G. C. Fagnano (1682 1766) followed up work on the lemniscate of
Bernoulli to show, around 1717 1718, that the rectification of this
curve leads to an elliptic integral, as does the arc length of the
ellipse, although certain arcs are rectifiable by elementary means.
Fagnano’s name is still attached to the ellipse x2 12y2 51, which
presents certain analogies to the equilateral or rectangular hyperbola.
The eccentricity of this ellipse, for example, is 1p =p2, whereas the
eccentricity of the rectangular hyperbola is 2.</p>
<h4 id="the-parallel-postulate-1">The Parallel Postulate</h4>
<p>Italian mathematicians during the eighteenth century made few, if
any, fundamental discoveries. The nearest approach to such a discovery
undoubtedly was that of Girolamo Saccheri (1667 1733), a Jesuit who
taught at colleges of his order in Italy. In the very year in which he
died, he published a book titled Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus
(Euclid Cleared of Every Flaw), in which he made an elaborate effort to
prove the parallel postulate. Saccheri had known of Nasir Eddin
al-Tusi’s efforts to prove the postulate almost half a millennium
earlier, and he determined to apply the method of reductio ad absurdum
to the problem. He began with a birectangular isosceles quadrilateral,
now known as a “Saccheri quadrilateral”—one having sides AD and BC equal
to each other and both perpendicular to the base AB. Without using the
parallel postulate, he easily showed that the “summit” angles C and D
are equal and that there are, then, just three possibilities for these
angles, described by Saccheri as (1) the hypothesis of the acute angle,
(2) the hypothesis of the right angle, and (3) the hypothesis of the
obtuse angle. By showing that hypotheses 1 and 3 lead to absurdities, he
thought by indirect reasoning to establish hypothesis 2 as a necessary
consequence of Euclid’s postulates other than the parallel postulate.
Saccheri had little trouble disposing of hypothesis 3, for he implicitly
assumed a straight line to be infinitely long. From hypothesis 1, he
derived theorem after theorem without encountering difficulty. Although
we know now that he was here building up a perfectly consistent
non-Euclidean geometry, Saccheri was so thoroughly imbued with the
conviction that Euclid’s was the only valid geometry that he permitted
this preconception to interfere with his logic. Where no contradiction
existed, he twisted his reasoning until he thought that hypothesis 1 led
to an absurdity. Hence, he lost credit for what would undoubtedly have
been the most significant discovery of the eighteenth
century—non-Euclidean geometry. As it was, his name remained unsung for
another century, for the importance of his work was overlooked by those
who followed him.</p>
<h4 id="divergent-series">Divergent Series</h4>
<p>Saccheri had as his student another Italian mathematician who
deserves brief mention—Guido Grandi (1671 1742), whose name is
remembered in the rose-petal curves so familiar in polar coordinates
through the equations r5a cos nθ and r5a sin nθ. These are known as
“roses of Grandi,” in recognition of his study of them. Grandi is also
recalled as one who had corresponded with Leibniz on the question of
whether the sum of the alternating infinite series 121112111211 can be
taken to be . This is suggested not only as the arithmetic mean of the
two values of the partial sums of the first n terms, but also as the
value when x 511 of the generating function 1/(11x) from which the
series 12x1x2 2x3 1x4 2 is obtained through division. In this
correspondence, Grandi suggested that here, one has a paradox comparable
to the mysteries of Christianity, for on grouping terms in pairs, one
reaches the result</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>1211121112 5010101 5;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>which parallels the creation of the world out of nothing.</p>
<p>Continuing such uncritical ideas to the integral of the generating
function 1/(11x), Leibniz and Jean Bernoulli had corresponded on the
nature of the logarithms of negative numbers. The series ln (11x)5 x2x2
/21x3 /32x4 /41 , however, is of little help here, because the series
diverges for x, 1. Leibniz argued that negative numbers do not</p>
<p>Di v er gent S er ie s</p>
<p>have real logarithms, but Bernoulli, believing the logarithmic curve
to be symmetric with respect to the function axis, held that ln (2x)5ln
(x), a view that seems to be confirmed by the fact that d/dx ln
(2x)5d/dx ln (1x)51/x. The question of the nature of logarithms of
negative numbers was not definitively resolved by either of the
correspondents, but rather by Bernoulli’s most brilliant student. Jean
Bernoulli had continued to exert an encouraging enthusiasm, through his
correspondence, during the first half of the eighteenth century, for he
outlived his older brother by forty-three years. Nevertheless, long
before his death in 1748, as an octogenarian, his influence had become
far less felt than that of his famous pupil Euler, whose contributions
to analysis, including the logarithms of negative numbers, were the
essential core of mathematical developments during the middle years of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Algebra is generous; she often gives more than is asked of her.</p>
<h4 id="dalembert">D’Alembert</h4>
<h4 id="the-life-of-euler">The Life of Euler</h4>
<p>Switzerland was the birthplace of many of the leading figures in the
mathematics of the early eighteenth century, and the most significant
mathematician to come from Switzerland during that time—or any time—was
Leonhard Euler (1707 1783).</p>
<p>Euler’s father was a clergyman who, like Jacques Bernoulli’s father,
hoped that his son would enter the ministry. The young man, however,
studied under Jean Bernoulli and associated with his sons, Nicolaus and
Daniel, and through them discovered his vocation. Euler was broadly
trained, for to the study of mathematics he added theology, medicine,
astronomy, physics, and oriental languages. This breadth stood him in
good stead when, in 1727, he heard from Russia that there was an opening
in medicine in the St. Petersburg Academy, where the young Bernoullis
had gone as professors of mathematics. On the recommendation of the
Bernoullis, two of the brightest luminaries in the early days</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>T he L i fe of Euler</p>
<p>of the Academy, Euler was called to be a member of the section on
medicine and physiology.</p>
<p>In 1730, Euler found himself in the chair of natural philosophy,
rather than in the medical section. His friend Nicolaus Bernoulli had
died, by drowning, in St. Petersburg the year before Euler arrived, and
in 1733, Daniel Bernoulli left Russia to occupy the chair in mathematics
at Basel. Thereupon Euler, at the age of twenty-six, became the
Academy’s chief mathematician. The St. Petersburg Academy had
established a research journal, the Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum
Imperialis Petropolitanae, and almost from the start, Euler contributed
a spate of mathematical articles. It was said by the French academician
Franc¸ois Arago that Euler could calculate without any apparent effort,
“just as men breathe, as eagles sustain themselves in the air.” As a
result, Euler composed mathematical memoirs while playing with his
children. In 1735, he had lost the sight of his right eye, but this
misfortune in no way diminished the rate of output of his research. He
is supposed to have said that his pencil seemed to surpass him in
intelligence, so easily did memoirs flow. He published more than 500
books and papers during his lifetime. For almost half a century after
his death, works by Euler continued to appear in the publications of the
St. Petersburg Academy. A bibliographical list of Euler’s works,
including posthumous items, contains 886 entries, and it is anticipated
that his collected works (including his correspondence), now being
published under Swiss auspices, will run to 82 substantial volumes. His
mathematical research averaged about 800 pages a year; no mathematician
has ever exceeded the output of this man whom Arago characterized as
“Analysis Incarnate.”</p>
<p>Early on, Euler acquired an international reputation. Even before
leaving Basel, he had received an honorable mention from the Parisian
Acade´mie des Sciences for an essay on the masting of ships. In later
years, he frequently entered essays in the contests set by the
Acade´mie, and twelve times he won the coveted biennial prize. The
topics ranged widely, and on one occasion, in 1724, Euler snared with
Maclaurin and Daniel Bernoulli a prize for an essay on the tides. (The
Paris prize was won twice by Jean Bernoulli and ten times by Daniel
Bernoulli.) Euler was never guilty of false pride, and he wrote works on
all levels, including textbook material for use in the Russian schools.
He generally wrote in Latin and sometimes in French, although German was
his native tongue. Euler had unusual language facility, as one should
expect of a person with a Swiss background. This was fortunate, for one
of the distinguishing marks of eighteenth-century mathematics was the
readiness with which scholars moved from one country to another, and
here Euler encountered no language problems. In 1741, Euler was invited
by Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy, and the invitation
was accepted. Euler spent twentyfive years at Frederick’s court, and he
submitted numerous papers to the St. Petersburg Academy, as well as to
the Prussian Academy.</p>
<p>Euler spent almost all of the last seventeen years of his life in
total darkness due to cataracts. Even this tragedy failed to stem the
flood of his research and publication, which continued unabated until in
1783, at the age of seventy-six, he suddenly died while sipping tea and
enjoying the company of one of his grandchildren.</p>
<h4 id="notation-1">Notation</h4>
<p>From 1727 to 1783, the pen of Euler had been busy adding to knowledge
in virtually every branch of pure and applied mathematics, from the most
elementary to the most advanced. Moreover, in most respects Euler, the
most successful notation builder of all times, wrote in the language and
the notations we use today. On his arrival in Russia in 1727, he had
been engaged in experiments in the firing of cannons, and in a
manuscript account of his results, written probably in 1727 or 1728,
Euler had used the letter e more than a dozen times to represent the
base of the system of natural logarithms. The concept behind this number
had been well known ever since the invention of logarithms more than a
century earlier, yet no standard notation for it had become common. In a
letter to Goldbach in 1731, Euler again used his letter e for “that
number whose hyperbolic logarithm51.” It appeared in print for the first
time in Euler’s Mechanica of 1736, a book in which Newtonian dynamics is
presented for the first time in analytic form. This notation, suggested
perhaps by the first letter of the word “exponential,” soon became
standard. The definitive use of the Greek letter π for the ratio of
circumference to diameter in a circle is also largely due to Euler,
although a prior occurrence is found in 1706, the year before Euler was
born—in the Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos, or A New Introduction to the
Mathematics, by William Jones (1675 1749). It was Euler’s adoption of
the symbol π in 1737 and later in his many popular textbooks that made
it widely known and used. The symbol i for p21 is another notation first
used by Euler, although in this case the adoption came near the end of
his life, in 1777. This use probably came so late because in his earlier
works, he had used i to represent an “infinite number,” somewhat as
Wallis had used N. Thus, Euler wrote ex 5(11x/i)i where we should prefer
ex 5limh-Nð11x=hÞh: The three symbols e, π, and i, for which Euler was
in large measure responsible, can be combined with the two most
important integers, 0 and 1, in the celebrated equality eπi 1150, which
contains the five most significant numbers (as well as the most
important relation and the most important operation) in all of
mathematics. The equivalent of this equality, in generalized form, had
been included by Euler in 1748 in his best-known textbook, Introductio
in Analysin Infinitorum. The so-called Eulerian constant, often
represented by the Greek letter γ, is a sixth important mathematical
constant, the</p>
<p>F oundat ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>number defined as limn-Nð1111 11=n2lnnÞ; a well-known number that has
been calculated to hundreds of decimal places, of which the first ten
are 0.5772156649.</p>
<p>It is not only in connection with designations for important numbers
that today we use notations introduced by Euler. In geometry, algebra,
trigonometry, and analysis, we find ubiquitous use of Eulerian symbols,
terminology, and ideas. The use of the small letters a, b, and c for the
sides of a triangle and of the corresponding capitals A, B, and C for
the opposite angles stems from Euler, as does the application of the
letters r, R, and s for the radius of the inscribed and circumscribed
circles and the semiperimeter of the triangle, respectively. The
beautiful formula 4rRs5abc relating the six lengths is also one of the
many elementary results attributed to him, although equivalents of this
result are implied by ancient geometry. The designation lx for logarithm
of x, the use of the now-familiar Σ to indicate a summation, and,
perhaps most important of all, the notation f(x) for a function of x
(used in the Petersburg Commentaries for 1734 1735) are other Eulerian
notations related to ours.</p>
<p>Foundation of Analysis</p>
<p>In evaluating developments in mathematics, we must always bear in
mind that the ideas behind the notations are by far the better half; in
this respect also, the work of Euler was epoch-making. It may fairly be
said that Euler did for the infinite analysis of Newton and Leibniz what
Euclid had done for the geometry of Eudoxus and Theaetetus, or what
Vie`te had done for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi and Cardan. Euler took
the differential calculus and the method of fluxions and made them part
of a more general branch of mathematics that ever since has been known
as “analysis”—the study of infinite processes. Euler’s Introductio in
Analysin Infinitorum served as a fountainhead for the burgeoning
developments in mathematics during the second half of the eighteenth
century. From this time onward, the idea of “function” became
fundamental in analysis. It had been adumbrated in the medieval latitude
of forms, and it had been implicit in the analytic geometry of Fermat
and Descartes, as well as in the calculus of Newton and Leibniz. The
fourth paragraph of the Introductio defines function of a variable
quantity as “any analytic expression whatsoever made up from that
variable quantity and from numbers or constant quantities.” Today such a
definition is unacceptable, for it fails to explain what an “analytic
expression” is. Euler presumably had in mind primarily the algebraic
functions and the elementary transcendental functions; the strictly
analytic treatment of the trigonometric functions was, in fact, in large
measure established by the Introductio. The sine, for example, was no
longer a line segment; it was simply a number or a ratio—the ordinate of
a point on a unit circle, or the number defined by the series z2z3
/3!1z5 /5!2 for some value of z. From the infinite series for ex, sin x,
and cos x, it was a short step to the “Euler identities”</p>
<p>ep 1x 2ep 1x sinx5 p ;</p>
<p>2 21</p>
<p>ep 1x 1ep 1x cosx5;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ep 1x 5cosx1 2p 1sinx;</p>
<p>relationships that had in essence been known to Cotes and De Moivre
but that in Euler’s hands became familiar tools of analysis.</p>
<p>In 1740, Euler had used imaginary exponents in a letter to Jean
Bernoulli, in which he wrote exp 1 1e2xp 1 52 cos x; the familiar Euler
identities appeared in the influential Introductio of 1748. The
elementary transcendental functions—trigonometric, logarithmic, inverse
trigonometric, and exponential—were written and thought of in much the
form that they are treated today. The abbreviations sin., cos., tang.,
cot., sec., and cosec. that were used by Euler in the Latin Introductio
are closer to the present English forms than are the corresponding
abbreviations in the Romance languages. Moreover, Euler was among the
first to treat logarithms as exponents, in the manner now so
familiar.</p>
<h4 id="infinite-series-3">Infinite Series</h4>
<p>The first volume of the Introductio is concerned from start to finish
with infinite processes—infinite products and infinite continued
fractions, as well as innumerable infinite series. In this respect, the
work is the natural generalization of the views of Newton, Leibniz, and
the Bernoullis, all of whom were fond of infinite series. Yet Euler was
surprisingly unrestrained in his use of such series. Although on
occasion he warned against the risk in working with divergent series, he
himself used the binomial series 1/ (1 2x) 511x 1x2 1x3 1 for values of
x. In fact, by combining the two series x/ (1 2x) 5 x 1x2 1x3 1 and x/
(x21)52 113 1 /x 11 /x2 1, Euler concluded that 1/ x2 11/ x11 1x 1x 1x
150.</p>
<p>Despite his hardihood, through manipulations of infinite series Euler
achieved results that had baffled his predecessors. Among these was the
summation of the reciprocals of the perfect squares: 1/12 11/22 1</p>
<p>1/32 11/42 1. Oldenburg, in a letter to Leibniz in 1673, had
asked</p>
<p>F oundat ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>for the sum of this series, but Leibniz failed to answer; in 1689,
Jacques Bernoulli had admitted his own inability to find the sum. Euler
began with the familiar series sin z5z2z3 /3!1z5 /5!2z7 /7!1. Then, sin2
z4 50 canbethoughtofastheinfinitepolynomialequation0512z /3!1z /5! 2z6
/7!1 (obtained by dividing through by2 3 z), or, if z2 is replaced with
w, as the equation 0512w/3!1w /5!2w /7! 1 . From the theory of algebraic
equations it is known, if the constant term is 1, that the sum of the
reciprocals of the roots is the negative of the coefficient of the
linear term,inthiscase1/3!.Moreover,therootsoftheequationinzareknownto

<p>Through this carefree application to polynomials of infinite degree
of algebraic rules valid for the finite case, Euler had achieved a
result that had baffled the older Bernoulli brothers; in later years,
Euler repeatedly made discoveries in similar fashion.</p>
<p>Euler’s summation of the reciprocals of the squares of the integers
seems to date from about 1736, and it is likely that it was to Daniel
Bernoulli that he promptly communicated the result. His interest in such
series always was strong, and in later years, he published the sums of
the reciprocals of other powers of the integers. Using the cosine series
instead of the sine series, Euler similarly found the result</p>

<p>85</p>
<p>hence the corollary summation</p>

<p>124</p>
<p>Many of these results also appeared in the Introductio of 1748,
including the sums of reciprocals of even powers from n52 through n526.
The series of reciprocals of odd powers are so intractable that it is
still not known whether the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes of the
positive integers is a rational multiple of π3, whereas Euler knew that
for the 26th power, the sum of the reciprocals is</p>

<p>Convergent and Divergent Series</p>
<p>Euler’s imaginative treatment of series led him to some striking
relationships between analysis and the theory of numbers. He showed, in
a relatively easy proof, that the divergence of the harmonic series
implies the Euclidean theorem on the infinitude of primes. If there were
only K primes, that is, p1, p2,…, pK, then every number n would be of
the form n5pα11pα22…pαKK. Let α be the greatest of the exponents αi for
the number n and form the product</p>
<p>1 1 1 1 1 1</p>
<p>P5 11 p1 1 p21 1 1 pα1! 11 p2 1 p22 1 pα2!</p>
<p>1 1 1</p>
<p>11 1 2 1 1 α!:</p>
<p>pK pK pK</p>
<p>In this product, the terms , , , 1n are bound to appear, as well as1
others, hence the product P cannot be smaller than 11 1n. From the
formula for the sum of a geometric progression, we see that the factors
in the product are respectively smaller than</p>
<p>1 1 1</p>
<p>; ; ;</p>
<p>121=p1 121=p2 121=p3</p>
<p>and so on. Hence,</p>

<p>1 2 3 n p 21 p 21 p 21 p 21</p>
<p>for all values of n. Therefore, if K, the number of primes, were
finite, the harmonic series would necessarily be convergent. In a
considerably more involved analysis, Euler showed that the infinite
series made up of the reciprocals of the primes is itself divergent, the
sum Sn being asymptotic to ln ln n for increasing values of the integer
n.</p>
<p>Euler delighted in relationships between the theory of numbers and
his rough-and-ready manipulations of infinite series. Heedless of the
dangers lurking in alternating series, he found such results as
π511112</p>
<p>111121 : Here the sign of a term, after the first two, is determined
as follows: If the denominator is a prime of form 4m11, a minus signis
used;if thedenominatoris a prime of form4m21, a plussign is used; and if
the denominator is a composite number, the signindicated by the product
of the signs of its components is used. Operations on infinite</p>
<p>series were handled with great abandon. From the result ln 1/(12x)5
x1x2 /21x3 /31x4 /41, Euler concluded that lnN 5111</p>
<p>11 , hence that 1=lnN 50512221212 ;</p>
<p>L o gar i t hms and t he Euler Id ent i t ie s</p>
<p>where the last series is made up of all of the reciprocals of primes
(in which case, the terms are taken as negative) and reciprocals of
products of two distinct primes (in which case, the terms are positive).
The Introductio is replete with such series and with related infinite
products, such as 05 U U U U U U U and N 5 U U U U U U U .</p>

<h4 id="logarithms-and-the-euler-identities">Logarithms and the Euler

<p>To the subject of logarithms, Euler contributed not only the
definition in
termsofexponentsthatweusetoday,butalsothecorrectviewwithrespectto
thelogarithmsofnegativenumbers.Thenotionthatlog(2x)5log(1x)was upheld by
Jean Le Rond d’Alembert, the leading mathematician in France during the
mid-eighteenth century. By 1747, Euler was able to write to d’Alembert
correctly explaining the status of logarithms of negative
numbers.TheresultshouldreallyhavebeenapparenttoJeanBernoulliandothers

ln(21)5πi. Logarithms of negative numbers therefore are not real, as
Jean Bernoulli and d’Alembert had thought, but pure imaginaries.</p>
<p>Euler also called attention to another property of logarithms that
became apparent from his identity. Any number, positive or negative, has
not one logarithm but infinitely many. From the relationship eiðθ62KπÞ
5cosθ1isinθ, one sees that if ln a5c, then c62Kπi are also natural
logarithms of a. Moreover, from Euler’s identity one sees that
logarithms of complex numbers, real or imaginary, are also complex
numbers. If, for example, one wishes a natural logarithm of a1bi, one
writes a1bi5ex1iy. One obtains ex eiy 5xa1bi5ex(cosyx1isiny). The
solution of the simultaneous equations e cosy5a and e siny5b (obtained
by equating real and imaginary parts of the complex equation) yields the
values y5arctanb/a and x5ln(bcscarctanb/a) 〔or x5
ln(asecarctanb/a)〕.</p>
<p>D’Alembert wished to show that the result of any algebraic operation
performed on a complex number is in turn a complex number. In a sense,
Euler did for elementary transcendental operations what d’Alembert tried
to do for algebraic operations. Through the Euler identities, it is not
difficult to find, for example, such quantities as sin (11i) or arccos
i, expressed in standard complex-number form. In the former case, one
writes</p>
<p>eið11 iÞ 2e2 ið11 iÞ</p>
<p>sinð11iÞ5;</p>
<p>2i</p>
<p>from which one finds that sin(11i)5a1bi, where a5〔(11e2) sin 1〕/ 2e
and b5〔(e2 21) cos 1〕 / 2e. In the latter case, one writes arccos
i5x1iy or i5cos(x1iy) or</p>
<p>eiðx1 iyÞ 1e2iðx1 iyÞ 11e2y ð12ey 2yÞ i5 5 cosx1i sinx:</p>
<p>2 2ey 2e</p>
<p>Equating real and imaginary parts, one sees that cosx50 and
x56π/2.</p>
<p>Hence,</p>
<p>12e2y y p</p>
<p>2ey 561 or e 5716 2:</p>
<p>Inasmuch as both x and y must be real, we see that x56π=2 and
y5lnð711p2). In a similar manner, one can carry out other elementary
transcendental operations on complex numbers, the results being complex
numbers. That is, the work of Euler showed that the system of complex
numbers is closed under the elementary transcendental operations.</p>
<p>Euler similarly showed that, surprisingly, an imaginary power of an
imaginary number can be a real number. In a letter to Christian Goldbach
(1690 1764) in 1746, he gave the remarkable result ii 5e2π=2. From
eiθ5cos θ1i sin θ we have, for θ5π/2, eπi/2 5i; hence,</p>
<p>ðeπi=2Þi 5eπi2=2 5e2π=2: There are, in fact, infinitely many real
values for ii, as Euler later showed, given by e2π=262Kπ, where K is an
integer. In the Memoirs of the Berlin Academy for 1749, Euler showed
that any complex power of a complex number, (a1bi)c1di, can be written
as a complex number p1qi. This aspect of Euler’s work was overlooked,
and the real values of ii had to be rediscovered in the nineteenth
century.</p>
<h4 id="differential-equations">Differential Equations</h4>
<p>Euler was, without any doubt, the individual most responsible for
methods used today in introductory college courses in the solution of
differential equations, and even many of the specific problems appearing
in current textbooks can be traced back to the great treatises Euler
wrote on the calculus—Institutiones Calculi Differentialis (Petersburg,
1755) and Institutiones Calculi Integralis (Petersburg, 1768 1770, 3
vols.). The use of integrating factors, the systematic methods of
solving linear equations of higher order with constant coefficients, and
the distinction between linear homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations
and between particular and general solutions are among his contributions
to</p>
<p>Di f fer ent ial Equat ions</p>
<p>the subject, although on some points credit must be shared with
others. Daniel Bernoulli, for example, had solved the equation yv
1Ky5f(x) independently of Euler and at about the same time in 1739 1740,
and d’Alembert, as well as Euler, had general methods, in about 1747,
for solving complete linear equations.</p>
<p>The solution of ordinary differential equations had, in a sense,
begun as soon as the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration had been recognized. But most differential equations cannot
easily be reduced to simple quadratures, requiring instead ingenious
substitutions or algorithms for their solution. One of the achievements
of the eighteenth century was the discovery of groups of differential
equations that are solvable by means of fairly simple devices. One of
the interesting differential equations of the eighteenth century is the
so-called Riccati equation: yu 5p(x)y2 1q(x)y1r(x). It was Euler who
first called attention to the fact that if a particular solution v5f(x)
is known, then the substitution y5v11/z converts the Riccati equation
into a linear differential equation in z, so that a general solution can
be found. In the Petersburg Commentarii for 1760 1763, Euler also
pointed out that if two particular solutions are known, then a general
solution is expressible in terms of a simple quadrature. To some extent,
our ubiquitous indebtedness to Euler in the field of differential
equations is betokened in the fact that a type of linear equation with
variable coefficients bears his name. The Euler equation xny(n) 1a1xn
1y(n 1) 11any(0) 5f(x) (where exponents included within parentheses
indicate orders of differentiation) is easily reduced, through the
substitution x5eu, to a linear equation having constant coefficients.
Euler also made progress in partial differential equations, which were
still a field for pioneers, by giving for the equation <span

<p>Euler’s four volumes of Institutiones contain by far the most
exhaustive treatment of the calculus up to that time. Besides the
elements of the subject and the solution of differential equations, we
find such things as “Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions,” namely,
if f (x, y) is homogeneous of order n, then xfx 1yfy 5nf; a development
of the calculus of finite differences; standard forms for elliptic
integrals; and the theory of the beta and gamma (or factorial) functions

<p>12x dx and related through such formulas as B m;n 5Γ m Γ n = Γðm1nÞ:
Wallis had anticipated some of the properties of these integrals, but
through Euler’s organization, these higher transcendental functions
became an essential part of advanced calculus and of applied
mathematics. About a century later, the integral in the beta function
was generalized by Pafnuty L. Chebyshev (1821 1894), who demonstrated
that the “Chebyshev integral” xp(12x)q dx is a higher transcendental
function unless p or q or p1qÐis an integer.</p>
<h4 id="probability-2">Probability</h4>
<p>One characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment was the tendency to
apply to all aspects of society the quantitative methods that had been
so successful in the physical sciences. In this respect, it is not
surprising to find both Euler and d’Alembert writing on problems of life
expectancy, the value of an annuity, lotteries, and other aspects of
social science. Probability, after all, had been among the chief
interests of Euler’s friends Daniel and Nicolaus Bernoulli. Among the
lottery problems that he published in the Berlin Academy Memoirs for
1765, the following is one of the simplest. Let n tickets be numbered
consecutively from 1 to n and let three tickets be drawn at random.
Then, the probability that a sequence of three consecutive numbers will
be drawn is</p>
<p>2U3</p>

<p>the probability that two consecutive numbers (but not three) will be

<p>No new concepts are required for the solution, but, as we might
anticipate, Euler contributed to notations here as he had elsewhere. He
wrote that he found it useful to represent the expression</p>

<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers-1">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>The theory of numbers has held strong attraction for many of the
greatest mathematicians, such as Fermat and Euler, but no appeal for
others—for example, Newton and d’Alembert. Euler did not publish a
treatise on the subject, but he wrote letters and articles on various
aspects of the theory of numbers. It will be recalled that Fermat had
asserted, among other things, (1) that numbers of the form 22n11
apparently are always prime; and (2) that if p is prime and a is an
integer not divisible by p, then ap 1 21 is divisible by p. Euler
exploded the first of these conjectures in 1732 through his uncanny
ability for computation, showing that 2251154;294;967;297 is factorable
into 6,700,4173641. Today the Fermat conjecture has been so thoroughly
deflated that mathematicians incline to the contrary opinion—that there
are no prime Fermat numbers beyond the number 65,537 corresponding to
n54.</p>
<p>Just as Euler, by means of a counterexample, had upset one of
Fermat’s conjectures, so a suggestion made by Euler was disproved in
1966. If n is greater than 2, Euler believed, at least n nth powers are
required to provide a sum that is itself an nth power. But it was shown
that the sum of only four fifth powers can be a fifth power, for 275
1845 11105 11335 51445. It should be noted, however, that in the latter
case, it required two centuries and the services of a high-speed
computing device to provide the counterexample.</p>
<p>For the second of Fermat’s conjectures, known as Fermat’s lesser
theorem, Euler was the first one to publish a proof (although Leibniz
had left an earlier demonstration in manuscript). Euler’s proof, which
appeared in the Petersburg Commentarii for 1736, is so surprisingly
elementary that we describe it here. The proof depends on an induction
on a. If a51, the theorem obviously holds. We now show that if the
theorem holds for any positive integral value of a, such as a5k, then it
necessarilyholdsfora5k11.Toshowthis,weusethebinomialtheorem to write
(k11)p as kp 1mp11, where m is an integer. On subtracting k11 from both
sides, we see that (k11)p 2(k11)5mp1(kp 2k).</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the last term on the right is divisible by p, by
hypothesis the right-hand side of the equation, hence also the left-hand
side, is obviously divisible by p. The theorem therefore holds, through
mathematical induction, for all values of a, provided that a is prime to
p.</p>
<p>Having proved Fermat’s lesser theorem, Euler demonstrated a somewhat
more general statement in which he used what has been called “Euler’s
φ-function.” If m is a positive integer greater than 1, the φ(m) is
defined as the number of integers less than m that are prime to m (but
including the integer 1 in each case). It is customary to define φ(1) as
1; for n52, 3, and 4, for example, the values of φ(n) are 1, 2, and 2,
respectively. If p is a prime, then clearly φ(p)5p21. It can be proved
that</p>
<p>φðmÞ5m12 1112 12 12 1;</p>
<p>p p pr</p>
<p>where p1, p2, pr are the distinct prime factors of(m) m. Using this
result,</p>
<p>Euler showed that aφ 21 is divisible by m if a is relatively prime to
m.</p>
<p>Euler settled two of Fermat’s conjectures but did not dispose of
“Fermat’s last theorem,” although he did prove the impossibility of
integer solutions of xn 1yn 5zn for the case n53.</p>
<p>In 1747, Euler added to the three pairs of amicable numbers known to
Fermat, bringing the list up to thirty pairs; later, he increased this
to more than sixty. Euler also gave a proof that all even perfect
numbers are of the form given by Euclid: 2n 1 (2n 21), where 2n 21 is
prime. Whether there can be an odd perfect number remains an open
question.</p>
<p>Also unresolved to this day is a question raised in correspondence by
Christian Goldbach (1690 1764). In writing to Euler in 1742, Goldbach
said that every even integer (.2) is the sum of two primes. This
socalled Goldbach’s theorem appeared in print (without proof) in 1770 in
England in the Meditationes Algebraicae of Edward Waring (1734
1793).</p>
<p>Among other unproved assertions is one known as Waring’s theorem, or
Waring’s problem. Euler had proved that every positive integer is the
sum of not more than four squares; Waring surmised that every positive
integer is the sum of not more than nine cubes or the sum of not more
than nineteen fourth powers. The first half of this bold guess was
proved in the early twentieth century; the second part is still
unproved. Waring also published in the Meditationes Algebraicae a
theorem named for his friend and pupil John Wilson (1741 1793)—if p is a
prime, then (p21)!11 is a multiple of p.</p>
<h4 id="textbooks">Textbooks</h4>
<p>The leading Continental mathematicians of the mid-eighteenth century
were primarily analysts, but we have seen that their contributions were
not limited to analysis. Euler not only contributed to the theory of
numbers but also composed a popular algebra textbook that appeared in
German and Russian editions at the St. Petersburg Academy in 1770 1772,
in French (under the auspices of d’Alembert) in 1774, and in numerous
other versions, including American editions in English. The
exceptionally didactic quality of Euler’s Algebra is attributed to the
fact that it was dictated by the blind author through a relatively
untutored domestic.</p>
<p>Synthetic geometry was not entirely forgotten on the Continent. Euler
contributed little to the field, despite the fact that today the
line</p>
<p>A nal y t ic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>containing the circumcenter, the orthocenter, and the barycenter of a
triangle is known as the Euler line of the triangle. That these centers
of a triangle are collinear seems to have been known earlier to Simson,
whose name has been attached to another line related to a triangle. Such
minor additions to pure geometry pale into insignificance, however, when
compared to Continental contributions to analytic geometry during the
mid-eighteenth century.</p>
<h4 id="analytic-geometry">Analytic Geometry</h4>
<p>We have described the analytic geometry of Clairaut, especially in
connection with developments in three dimensions, but the material in
the second volume of Euler’s Introductio was more extensive, more
systematic, and more effective. As early as 1728, Euler contributed to
the Petersburg Commentarii papers on the use of coordinate geometry in
three-space, giving general equations for three broad classes of
surfaces: cylinders, cones, and surfaces of revolution. He recognized
that the equation of a cone with its vertex at the origin is necessarily
homogeneous. He also showed that the shortest curve (geodesic) between
two points on a conical surface would become the straight line between
these points if the surface were flattened out into the form of a
plane—one of the earliest theorems concerning developable surfaces.</p>
<p>Euler’s awareness of the significance of making work as general as
possible is especially seen in the second volume of his Introductio.
This book did more than any other to make the use of coordinates, in
both two and three dimensions, the basis of a systematic study of curves
and surfaces. Instead of concentrating on the conic sections, Euler gave
a theory of curves in general, based on the function concept that had
been central in the first volume. Transcendental curves are not given
short shrift, as had been customary, so that here, practically for the
first time, graphical study of trigonometric functions formed a part of
analytic geometry.</p>
<p>The Introductio also includes two accounts of polar coordinates that
are so thorough and systematic that the system frequently, but
erroneously, is attributed to Euler. Whole classes of curves, both
algebraic and transcendental, are considered; for the first time, the
equations for transformations from rectangular to polar coordinates
appear in strictly modern trigonometric form. Moreover, Euler made use
of the general vectorial angle and of negative values for the radius
vector, so that the spiral of Archimedes, for example, appeared in its
dual form, symmetric with respect to the 90 axis. D’Alembert evidently
was influenced by this work when he wrote the article on “Ge´ome´trie”
for the Encyclope´die. Euler’s Introductio was also chiefly responsible
for the systematic use of what is called the parametric representation
of curves, that is, an expression of each of the Cartesian coordinates
as a function of an auxiliary independent variable. For the cycloid, for
example, Euler used the form</p>
<p>z</p>
<p>x5b 2 bcos</p>
<p>a z y5z1bsin:</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>A long and systematic appendix to the Introductio is perhaps Euler’s
most significant contribution to geometry, for it represents virtually
the first textbook exposition of solid analytic geometry. Surfaces, both
algebraic and transcendental, are considered in general and then are
subdivided into categories. Here we find, evidently for the first time,
the notion that surfaces of the second degree constitute a family of
quadrics in space analogous to the conic sections in plane geometry.
Beginning with the general ten-term quadratic equation f(x, y, z)50,
Euler noted that the aggregate of terms of the second degree, when
equated to zero, gives the equation of the asymptotic cone, real or
imaginary. More important, he used the equations for translation and
rotation of axes (in the form that, incidentally, still bears Euler’s
name) to reduce the equation of a nonsingular quadric surface to one of
the canonical forms corresponding to the five fundamental types: the
real ellipsoid, the hyperboloids of one and two sheets, and the elliptic
and hyperbolic paraboloids. The work of Euler comes closer to modern
textbooks than did any other book before the French Revolution.</p>
<h4 id="the-parallel-postulate-lambert">The Parallel Postulate:
Lambert</h4>
<p>Many mathematicians, including Euler, have also fancied themselves
philosophers. Euler missed an opportunity that another philosophically
inclined Swiss mathematician tried to exploit. This was Johann Heinrich
Lambert (1728 1777), a Swiss-German writer on a wide variety of
mathematical and nonmathematical themes, who for a couple of years was
an associate of Euler’s at the Berlin Academy. It is said that when
Frederick the Great asked him which science he was most proficient in,
Lambert curtly replied, “All.”</p>
<p>We have seen that Saccheri had believed that he had demolished the
possibilities that the sum of the angles of a plane triangle might be
more or less than two right angles. Lambert called attention to the
well-known fact that on the surface of a sphere, the angle sum of a
triangle is indeed more than two right angles, and he suggested that a
surface might be found on which the triangle angle sum falls short of
two right angles. In trying to complete what Saccheri had attempted—a
proof that denial of</p>
<p>T he Parallel Po s tulat e: L amb er t</p>
<p>Euclid’s parallel postulate leads to a contradiction—Lambert, in
1766, wrote Die Theorie der Parallellinien, although this appeared,
posthumously, only in 1786. Instead of beginning with a Saccheri
quadrilateral, he adopted as his starting point a quadrilateral having
three right angles (now known as a Lambert quadrilateral) and then
considered for the fourth angle the three possibilities, namely, that it
might be acute, right, or obtuse. Corresponding to these three cases, he
showed, in the manner of Saccheri, that the angle sum of a triangle
would be respectively less than, equal to, or greater than two right
angles. Going beyond Saccheri, he demonstrated that the extent to which
the sum falls short of, or exceeds, two right angles is proportional to
the area of the triangle. In the obtuse-angled case, this situation is
similar to a classical theorem in spherical geometry—that the area of a
triangle is proportional to its spherical excess—and Lambert speculated
that the hypothesis of the acute angle might correspond to a geometry on
a novel surface, such as a sphere of imaginary radius. In 1868, it was
shown by Eugenio Beltrami (1835 1900) that Lambert had indeed been
correct in his conjecture of the existence of some such surface. It
turned out to be, however, not a sphere with an imaginary radius but a
real surface known as a pseudosphere, that is, a surface of constant
negative curvature generated by revolving the tractrix above its
axis.</p>
<p>Although Lambert, like Saccheri, tried to prove the parallel
postulate, he seems to have been aware of his lack of success. He
wrote,</p>
<p>Proofs of the Euclidean postulate can be developed to such an extent
that apparently a mere trifle remains. But a careful analysis shows that
in this seeming trifle lies the crux of the matter; usually it contains
either the proposition that is being proved or a postulate equivalent to
it.</p>
<p>No one else came so close to the truth without actually discovering
non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Lambert is also known today for other contributions. One of these is
the first proof, presented to the Berlin Academy in 1761, that π is an
irrational number. (In 1737, Euler had shown that e is irrational.)
Lambert showed that if x is a nonzero rational number, then tan x cannot
be rational. Inasmuch as tan π/451, a rational number, it follows that
π/4 cannot be a rational number, hence neither can π. This did not, of
course, dispose of the circle-squaring question, for quadratic
irrationalities are constructible. At about this time, circle-squarers
had become so numerous that the Academy in Paris passed a resolution in
1775 that no purported solutions of the quadrature problem would be
officially examined.</p>
<p>As another of Lambert’s contributions to mathematics, we should
recall that he did for the hyperbolic functions what Euler had done for
the circular functions, providing the modern view and notation.
Comparisons of the ordinates of the circle x2 1y2 51 and of the
hyperbola x2 2y2 51 had fascinated mathematicians for a century, and by
1757, Vincenzo Riccati had suggested a development of hyperbolic
functions. It remained for Lambert to introduce the notations sinh x,
cosh x, and tanh x for the hyperbolic equivalents of the circular
functions of ordinary trigonometry and to popularize the new hyperbolic
trigonometry that modern science finds so useful. Corresponding to
Euler’s three identities for sin x, cos x, and eix, there are three
similar relationships for the hyperbolic functions expressed by the
equations</p>
<p>ex 2ex ex 1ex</p>
<p>sinhx5; coshx5</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>and ex 5coshx1sinhx:</p>
<p>Lambert also wrote on cosmography, descriptive geometry, map making,
logic, and the philosophy of mathematics, but his influence did not
match that of Euler or of d’Alembert, whose work we shall consider in
the next chapter.</p>

<p>Mathematicians of France at the time of the revolution not only
contributed handsomely to the fund of knowledge but they were in large
measure responsible for the chief lines of development in the explosive
proliferation of mathematics during the succeeding century. Of six men
whom we may name as mathematical leaders during the revolution, all had
produced abundantly before 1789; not one of the six expressed regret
later when the old order passed away. They were Gaspard Monge,
Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre Simon Laplace, Adrien Marie Legendre,
Lazare Carnot, and Nicolas Condorcet; they were to be in the midst of
the turmoil, and one of them fell victim to it.</p>
<p>Two mathematicians, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert and Condorcet, were among
the heralds of the French Revolution. Only Condorcet lived to see the
fall of the Bastille, and he succumbed as a result.</p>

<p>The chief scientific institution in France supporting mathematical
research through publications, meetings, and prizes during most of the
eighteenth century was the Royal Academy of Sciences. In 1793, the
Revolutionary Convention shut down operation of the Academy of Sciences,
along with that of four other major academies. Two years later, the
Directory established the Institut National des Sciences et des Arts,
composed of three classes: physical and mathematical sciences, moral and
political sciences, literature and fine arts. Various reorganizations
and name changes followed, initially at the behest of Napoleon, who had
joined the Institut in 1797. Only in 1816 could the classes resume under
the name “Academy,” which had been considered reactionary. During the
early years of this strife-torn period, mathematical activities of the
Academy were greatly diminished; the one project that survived the
political gyrations was the reform of weights and measures.</p>
<p>The year 1793 marked the shutting down not only of the academies but
also of the activities of most of the colleges making up the University
of Paris. Universities had not been the mathematical foci that they are
today. Most French mathematicians of the eighteenth century who were
active before the revolution were associated not with the universities,
but with either the church or the military; others found royal patronage
or became private teachers.</p>
<p>Within a few years of the fall of the Bastille in 1789, the system of
higher education in France was to undergo a drastic revision as a result
of the upheaval produced by the French Revolution. During this short but
significant period, France once more became the mathematical center of
the world, as it had been during the middle of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>The Committee onWeights and Measures</p>
<p>The reform of the system of weights and measures is an especially
appropriate example of the way in which mathematicians patiently
persisted in their efforts despite confusion and political difficulties.
As early in the revolution as 1790, Talleyrand proposed the reform of
weights and measures. The problem was referred to the Academie des´
Sciences, in which a committee that had Lagrange and Condorcet as two of
its members was established to draw up a proposal.</p>
<p>The committee considered two alternatives for the basic length in the
new system. One was the length of the pendulum that should beat seconds.
The equation for the pendulum being T 52π l=g; this would make the
standard length g=π2 But the committee was so impressed byp the accuracy
with which Legendre and others had measured the length of a terrestrial
meridian that in the end, the meter was defined to be the tenmillionth
part of the distance between the equator and the pole. The</p>
<p>D’Ale mb er t</p>
<p>resulting metric system was ready in most respects in 1791, but there
was confusion and delay in establishing it.</p>
<p>The closing of the Academie in 1793 was a blow to mathematics, but
the´ convention continued the Committee on Weights and Measures,
although it purged the committee of some members, such as A. L.
Lavoisier, and enlarged it by adding others, including Monge. At one
point, Lagrange was very nearly lost to the committee, for the
Convention had banned foreigners from France, but Lagrange was
specifically exempted from the decree and remained to serve as head of
the committee. Still later, the committee was made responsible to the
Institut national; Lagrange, Laplace, Legendre, and Monge all served on
the committee at this stage. By 1799, the work of the committee had been
completed, and the metric system, as we have it today, became a reality.
The metric system is, of course, one of the more tangible mathematical
results of the revolution, but in terms of the development of our
subject, it cannot be compared in significance with other
contributions.</p>
<h4 id="dalembert-1">D’Alembert</h4>
<p>Like Euler and the Bernoullis, Jean Le Rond d’Alembert (1717 1783),
too, was broadly educated—in law, medicine, science, and mathematics—a
background that served him well when, from 1751 to 1772, he collaborated
with Denis Diderot (1713 1784) in the twenty-eight volumes of the
celebrated Encyclopedie´ or Dictionnaire raisonne des´ sciences, des
arts, et des metiers´ . For the Encyclopedie´ , d’Alembert wrote the
much-admired “Discours preliminaire,” as well as most of the
mathematical and scientific articles. The Encyclopedie´ , despite
d’Alembert’s Jansenist education, showed strong tendencies toward the
secularization of learning so characteristic of the Enlightenment, and
it met with strong attack from Jesuits. Through his defense of the
project, d’Alembert became known as “the fox of the Encyclopedia” and
incidentally played a significant role in the expulsion of the Jesuit
order from France. As a result of his activities and his friendships
with Voltaire and others among the Philosophes, he was one of those who
paved the way for the French Revolution. At the early age of
twenty-four, he had been elected to the Academie des Sciences, and in
1754, he became its´ secretaire perpetuel´ , and as such, perhaps the
most influential scientist in France.</p>
<p>While Euler was busy with mathematical research in Berlin, d’Alembert
was active in Paris. Until 1757, when controversy over the problem of
vibrating strings brought estrangement, correspondence between the two
wasfrequentandcordial,fortheirinterestsweremuchthesame.Statements such
as log(21)2 5log(11)2, equivalent to 2 log(21)52 log(11) or to
log(2l)5log(1l), had puzzled the best mathematicians of the earlier part
of the eighteenth century, but, as noted in the previous chapter, by
1747, Euler was able to write to d’Alembert correctly explaining the
status of logarithms of negative numbers.</p>
<p>D’Alembert had spent much of his time and effort attempting to prove
the theorem conjectured by Girard and known today as the fundamental
theorem of algebra—that every polynomial equation f(x)50, having complex
coefficients and of degree n, has at least one complex root. So earnest
were his efforts to prove the theorem (especially in a prize essay on
“The General Cause of Winds,” published in the Memoirs of the Berlin
Academy for 1746) that in France today, the theorem is widely known as
the theorem of d’Alembert. If we think of the solution of such a
polynomial equation as a generalization of the explicit algebraic
operations, we can say that in essence, d’Alembert wished to show that
the result of any algebraic operation performed on a complex number is
in turn a complex number. In a paper of 1752 on the resistance of
fluids, he arrived at the so-called Cauchy-Riemann equations that loom
so large in complex analysis.</p>
<p>Limits</p>
<p>D’Alembert was an unusual combination of caution and boldness in his
view of mathematical developments. He regarded Euler’s use of divergent
series as open to suspicion (1768), despite the successes achieved.
Moreover, d’Alembert objected to the Eulerian assumption that
differentials are symbols for quantities that are zero and yet
qualitatively different. Inasmuch as Euler restricted himself to
well-behaved functions, he had not become involved in the subtle
difficulties that later were to make his naive position untenable.
Meanwhile, d’Alembert believed that the “true metaphysics” of the
calculus was to be found in the idea of a limit. In the article on the
“differential” that he wrote for the Encyclopedie´ , d’Alembert stated
that “the differentiation of equations consists simply in finding the
limits of the ratio of finite differences of two variables included in
the equation.” Opposing the views of Leibniz and Euler, d’Alembert
insisted that “a quantity is something or nothing; if it is something,
it has not yet vanished; if it is nothing, it has literally vanished.
The supposition that there is an intermediate state between these two is
a chimera.” This view would rule out the vague notion of differentials
as infinitely small magnitudes, and d’Alembert held that the
differential notation is merely a convenient manner of speaking that
depends for its justification on the language of limits. His
Encyclopedie´ article on the differential referred to Newton’s De
Quadratura Curvarum, but d’Alembert interpreted Newton’s phrase “prime
and ultimate ratio” as a limit, rather than as a first or last ratio of
two quantities just springing into being. In the article on “Limit” that
he composed for the Encyclopedie´ , he called one quantity the limit of
a second</p>
<p>B ez out´</p>
<p>(variable) quantity if the second can approach the first nearer than
by any given quantity (without actually coinciding with it). The
imprecision in this
definitionwasremovedintheworksofnineteenth-centurymathematicians.</p>
<p>Euler had thought of an infinitely large quantity as the reciprocal
of an infinitely small magnitude, but d’Alembert, having outlawed the
infinitesimal, defined the indefinitely large in terms of limits. A
line, for example, is said to be infinite with respect to another if
their ratio is greater than any given number. He went on to define
indefinitely large quantities of higher order in a manner similar to
that used by mathematicians today in speaking of orders of infinity with
respect to functions. D’Alembert denied the existence of the actually
infinite, for he was thinking of geometric magnitudes, rather than of
the theory of aggregates proposed a century later.</p>
<h4 id="differential-equations-1">Differential Equations</h4>
<p>D’Alembert, a man of wide interests, is perhaps best known today for
what is referred to as d’Alembert’s principle: the internal actions and
reactions of a system of rigid bodies in motion are in equilibrium. This
appeared in 1743 in his celebrated treatise Traite de dynamique´ . Other
treatises by d’Alembert concerned music, the three-body problem, the
precession of the equinoxes, motion in resisting media, and lunar
perturbations. In studying the problem of vibrating strings, he was led
to the partial differential equation <span class="citation"
data-cites="2u">@2u</span>=<span class="citation"
data-cites="t2">@t2</span> 5@2u=<span class="citation"
data-cites="x2">@x2</span>, for which in 1747 he gave (in the Memoirs of
the Berlin Academy) the solution u5 f(x1t)1g(x2t), where f and g are
arbitrary functions. D’Alembert also found the singular solution of the
differential equation y5xf(yu)1g(yu); hence, this is known as
d’Alembert’s equation.</p>
<p>Bezout´</p>
<p>The year 1783, when d’Alembert and Euler died, was also the year of
E´tienne Bezout’s (1730 1783) death. The son and grandson of
magistrates´ in Nemours, inspired by exposure to works of Euler, he
chose a mathematical career and published his first papers in the 1750s.
One was a memoir on dynamics, which was followed by two papers on
integration. He was appointed to the Academie des Sciences, first as an´
adjoint in mechanics, then an associe´ and, in 1770, a pensionnaire. In
1763, as royal censor, he was appointed examiner of the Gardes de la
Marine. In this position, he was expected to provide textbooks, an
assignment that resulted in a series of widely adopted works. The first
was a four-volume Cours de mathematiques a´
<code>l’usage des Gardes du Pavillon et de la Marine, which appeared between 1764 and 1767. In 1768, the examiner for the artillery died, and Bezout was appointed to´ succeed him, becoming examiner of the Corps d’Artillerie. This resulted in his producing an even more expansive and successful textbook, the Cours complet de mathematiques a´</code>
l’usage de la marine et de l’artillerie, a six-volume work that appeared
between 1770 and 1782. For decades, it was this Cours that students
studied when preparing to enter advanced scientific schools. He took
into account that he was writing for beginners and attempted to build on
subjects familiar to them, such as elementary geometry, conveying a
sense of the range of usefulness of the subject, rather than stressing
fine points of rigor. Judging from repeated editions, his was the most
successful of the late-eighteenth-century Cours that covered the subject
matter of mathematics from the lowest to the highest level. His
textbooks were translated into English and in the early decades of the
nineteenth century were still used at West Point, as well as at Harvard
and other institutions; in 1826, the first American textbook in analytic
geometry was derived from Bezout’s´ Cours. The fourth part of Bezout’s´
Cours— the principles of mechanics—is the raison d’eˆtre of the program.
The mathematical preeminence of France (and, indeed, of Continental
Europe as a whole) in the eighteenth century was based in large measure
on the application of analysis to mechanics as taught in technical
schools, and it was under this influence that the mathematicians of the
French Revolution had been brought up. The emphasis given to mechanics
and to the closing section on navigation is in keeping with the use of
the Cours de mathematiques´ as a text in a military academy such as the
one at Mezie`res, which both Monge and Carnot attended. It was through
such compilations, rather than through the original works of the authors
themselves, that the mathematical advances of Euler and d’Alembert
became widely known.</p>
<p>Bezout’s name is familiar today in connection with the use of deter-´
minants in algebraic elimination. In a memoir of the Paris Academy for
1764 and more extensively in a treatise of 1779 titled Theorie g´ en´
erale´ des equations alg´ ebriques´ , Bezout gave rules, similar to
Cramer’s, for´ solving n simultaneous linear equations in n unknowns. He
is best known for an extension of these to a system of equations in one
or more unknowns, in which it is required to find the condition on the
coefficients necessary for the equations to have a common solution. To
take a very simple case, one might ask for the condition that the
equations a1x1b1y1c1 50, a2x1b2y1c2 50, a3x1b3y1c3 50 have a common
solution. The necessary condition is that the eliminant</p>
<p>a1 b1 c1</p>
<p>a2 b2 c2 ;</p>
<p>a3 b3 c3</p>
<p>C ondorc e t</p>
<p>here a special case of the “Bezoutiant,” should be 0. Somewhat more´
complicated eliminants arise when conditions are sought for two
polynomial equations of unequal degree to have a common solution.
Bezout´ was also the first one to give a satisfactory proof of the
theorem, known to Maclaurin and Cramer, that two algebraic curves of
degrees m and n, respectively, intersect in general in mn points; hence,
this is often called Bezout’s theorem. Euler had contributed to the
theory of elim-´ ination as well, but less extensively than did
Bezout.´</p>
<h4 id="condorcet">Condorcet</h4>
<p>Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet (1743 1794), a
physiocrat, a Philosophe, and an encyclopedist, belonged to the circle
of Voltaire and d’Alembert. The family of Condorcet included influential
members in the cavalry and the church; hence, his education presented no
problem. At Jesuit schools and later at the Colle`ge de Navarre, he made
an enviable reputation in mathematics, but instead of becoming a captain
of cavalry, as his family had hoped, he lived the life of a scholar in
much the same sense as Voltaire, Diderot, and d’Alembert.</p>
<p>He was a capable mathematician who had published books on probability
and the integral calculus, but he was also a restless visionary and an
idealist who was interested in anything related to the welfare of
mankind. He, like Voltaire, had a passionate hatred of injustice;
although he held the title of marquis, he saw so many inequalities in
the ancien regime´ that he wrote and worked toward reform. With implicit
faith in the perfectibility of mankind and believing that education
would eliminate vice, he argued for free public education, an admirably
forwardlooking view, especially for those days. Condorcet is perhaps
best remembered mathematically as a pioneer in social mathematics,
especially through the application of probability and statistics to
social problems. When, for example, conservative elements (including the
Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Theology) attacked those who
advocated inoculation against smallpox, Condorcet (together with
Voltaire and Daniel Bernoulli) came to the defense of variolation.</p>
<p>With the opening of the revolution, Condorcet’s thoughts turned from
mathematics to administrative and political problems. The educational
system had collapsed under the effervescence of the revolution, and
Condorcet saw that this was the time to try to introduce the reforms he
had in mind. He presented his plan to the Legislative Assembly, of which
he became president, but agitation over other matters precluded serious
consideration of it. Condorcet published his scheme in 1792, but the
provision for free education became a target of attack. Not until years
after his death did France achieve Condorcet’s ideal of free public
instruction.</p>
<p>Condorcet, who had been sympathetic to the moderate Gironde wing of
the revolution, had had high hopes for the revolution—until extremists
seized control. He then boldly denounced the Septembrists and was
ordered arrested for his pains. He sought hiding, and during the long
months of concealment, he composed the celebrated Sketch for a
Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, indicating nine
steps in the rise of mankind from a tribal stage to the founding of the
French Republic, with a prediction of the bright tenth stage that he
believed the revolution was about to usher in. Shortly after completing
this work (in 1794) and believing that his presence endangered the lives
of his hosts, he left his hiding place. Promptly recognized as an
aristocrat, he was arrested. The following morning, he was found dead on
the floor of his prison.</p>
<p>Condorcet, who is interesting because of the breadth of his
interests, had published De calcul integral as early as 1765 and Essai
sur l’application de l’analyse
a<code>la probabilite des d´ ecisions rendues a´</code> la pluralite des
voix´ in 1785. Condorcet was the only one of our six leading
mathematicians at the time of the revolution who can be said to have
played an anticipatory role in the events leading to 1789, and he was
the only one to lose his life through it.</p>
<h4 id="lagrange">Lagrange</h4>
<p>Educated in Turin, as a young man Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736</p>
<ol start="1813" type="1">
<li>became a professor of mathematics in the military academy of Turin,
but later he found successive royal patrons in Frederick the Great of
Prussia and Louis XVI of France.</li>
</ol>
<p>If Carnot and Legendre were disciples of clear and rigorous thought,
Lagrange was the high priest of the cult. He had published his
Mecanique´ analytique (1788), as well as frequent papers on algebra,
analysis, and geometry, before the revolution. At the height of the
Terror, Lagrange had thought seriously of leaving France, but just at
this critical juncture, the E´cole Normale and the E´cole Polytechnique
were established, and Lagrange was invited to lecture on analysis.
Lagrange seems to have welcomed the opportunity to teach. The new
curriculum called for new lecture notes, and these Lagrange supplied for
various levels. For students at the E´cole Normale in 1795, he prepared
and delivered lectures that today would be appropriate for a high school
class in advanced algebra or for a course in college algebra; the
material in these notes enjoyed a popularity that extended to America,
where they were published as Lectures on Elementary Mathematics. For
scholars on the higher level of the E´cole Polytechnique, Lagrange
lectured on analysis and prepared what has ever since been regarded as a
classic in mathematics. The results, in his Theorie des fonctions
analytiques´ , appeared in</p>
<p>L a grange</p>
<p>the same year as Carnot’s Reflexions´ , and together they make 1797 a
banner year for the rise of rigor.</p>
<p>Theory of Functions</p>
<p>Lagrange’s function theory, which developed some ideas that he had
presented in a paper about twenty-five years earlier, certainly was not
useful in the narrower sense, for the notation of the differential was
far more expeditious and suggestive than the Lagrangian “derived
function,” from which our name “derivative” comes. The whole motive of
the work was not to try to make the calculus more utilitarian but to
make it more logically satisfying. The key idea is easy to describe. The
function f(x)51/(12x), when expanded by long division, yields the
infinite series 111x11x2 11x3 111xn 1. If the coefficient of xn is
multiplied by n!, Lagrange called the result the value of the nth
derived function of f(x) for the point x50, with suitable modification
for expansions of functions about other points. To this work by
Lagrange, we owe the commonly used notation for derivatives of various
orders, fu(x), fv(x),…, f (n)(x)…. Lagrange thought that through the use
of this device, he had eliminated the need for limits or infinitesimals,
although he continued to use the latter side by side with his derived
functions. But, alas, there are flaws in his fine new scheme. Not every
function can be so expanded, for there were lapses in Lagrange’s
putative proof of the expandability; moreover, the question of the
convergence of the infinite series brings back the need for the limit
concept. Yet the work of Lagrange during the revolution can be said to
have had a broader influence through the initiation of a new subject
that has ever since been a center of attention in mathematics—the theory
of functions of a real variable.</p>
<p>Calculus of Variations</p>
<p>Lagrange’s first and perhaps his greatest contribution is the
calculus of variations. This was a new branch of mathematics, the name
of which originated from notations used by Lagrange from about 1760 on.
In its simplest form, the subject seeks to determine a functional
relationship y5f(x) such that an integral bagðx;yÞdx shall be a maximum
or a minimum. Problems of isoperimetry or of quickest descent are
specialÐ cases in the calculus of variations. In 1755, Lagrange had
written to Euler about the general methods that he had developed for
handling problems of this type, and Euler generously held up publication
of somewhat related work of his own, in order that the younger man
should receive full credit for the newer methods that Euler regarded as
superior.</p>
<p>From the time of his first publications in the Miscellanea of the
Turin Academy in 1759 1761, the reputation of Lagrange was
established.</p>
<p>When, in 1766, Euler and d’Alembert advised Frederick the Great on
Euler’s successor at the Berlin Academy, they both urged the appointment
of Lagrange. Frederick then presumptuously wrote to Lagrange that it was
necessary that the greatest geometer of Europe should live near the
greatest of kings. Lagrange assented; he remained in Berlin for twenty
years, leaving only after Frederick’s death, three years before the
start of the French Revolution.</p>
<h2 id="algebra-1">Algebra</h2>
<p>It was during his days at the Berlin Academy that Lagrange published
important memoirs on mechanics, the three-body problem, his early ideas
on derived functions, and influential work on the theory of equations.
In 1767, he published a memoir on the approximation of roots of
polynomial equations by means of continued fractions; in another paper
in 1770, he considered the solvability of equations in terms of
permutations on their roots. The latter work would lead to the
enormously successful theory of groups and to the proofs by E´variste
Galois and Niels Henrik Abel of the insolvability, in the usual terms,
of equations of a degree greater than four. Today the name of Lagrange
is attached to what is perhaps the most important theorem of group
theory: if o is the order of a subgroup g of a group G of order O, then
o is a factor of O. Finding that a resolvent of a quintic equation, far
from being of a degree less than five, as one should have expected, was
a sextic, Lagrange conjectured that polynomial equations above the
fourth degree are not solvable in the usual sense.</p>
<p>Lagrange Multipliers</p>
<p>Ever on the lookout for generality and elegance in the treatment of
problems, Lagrange was responsible for the method of variation of
parameters in the solution of nonhomogeneous linear differential
equations. That is, if c1u1 1c2u2 is a general solution of yv 1a1yu
1a2y50 (where u1 and u2 are functions of x), he replaced the parameters
c1 and c2 with undetermined variables v1 and v2 (functions of x) and
determined the latter so that v1u1 1v2u2, should be a solution of yv
1a1yu 1a2y5f(x). In the determination of maxima and minima of a function
such as f(x, y, z, w) subject to constraints g(x, y, z, w)5 0 and h(x,
y, z, w)50, he suggested the use of Lagrange multipliers to provide an
elegant and symmetric algorithm. Under this method, one introduces two
undetermined constants λ and μ; forms the function F5f1λg1μh from
the</p>
<p>six equations Fx 50, Fy 50, FZ 50, Fw 50, g50, and h50; eliminates
the multipliers λ and μ; and solves for the desired values of x, y, z,
and w.</p>
<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers-2">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>Like many leading modern mathematicians, Lagrange had a deep interest
in the theory of numbers. Although he did not use the language of
congruences, Lagrange showed, in 1768, the equivalent of the statement
that for a prime modulus p the congruence f(x)0 can have not more than n
distinct solutions, where n is the degree (except for the trivial case
in which all coefficients of f(x) are divisible by p). Two years later,
he published a demonstration of the theorem, for which Fermat claimed to
have had a proof, that every positive integer is the sum of at most four
perfect squares; hence, this theorem is often known as Lagrange’s
four-square theorem. At the same time, he also gave the first proof of a
result known as Wilson’s theorem, which had appeared in Waring’s
Meditationes Algebraicae of the same year—for any prime p, the integer
(p21)!11 is divisible by p.</p>
<p>Lagrange also contributed to the theory of probability, but in this
branch, he took second place to Laplace, who was younger.</p>
<h4 id="monge">Monge</h4>
<p>Gaspard Monge (1746 1818) was the son of a poor tradesman. Through
the influence of a lieutenant colonel who had been struck by the boy’s
ability, however, Monge was permitted to attend some courses at the
E´cole Militaire de Mezie`res; he so impressed those in authority that
he soon became a member of the teaching staff—the only one of our group
of six who was primarily a teacher, perhaps one of the most influential
mathematics teachers since the days of Euclid.</p>
<p>Monge contributed numerous mathematical articles to the Memoires of´
the Academie des Sciences´ . Inasmuch as he succeeded Bezout as´
examiner for the School of the Navy, Monge was more urged by those in
authority to do what Bezout had done—write a´ Cours de mathematiques´
for the use of candidates. Monge, however, was more interested in
teaching and research, and he completed only one volume of the project:
Traite´ elementaire de statique (Paris, 1788). He was attracted not only
to both pure and applied mathematics but also to physics and chemistry.
In particular, he participated with Lavoisier in experiments, including
those on the composition of water, which led to the chemical revolution
of 1789. At the time of the revolution, Monge had become one of the best
known of French scientists, but his geometry had not been properly
appreciated. His chief work, the Geom´ etrie descriptive´ , had not been
published because his superiors felt that it was in the interests of
national defense to keep it confidential.</p>
<p>Monge made efforts after the crisis of foreign invasion had subsided
to establish a school for the preparation of engineers. As Condorcet had
been the guiding spirit in the Committee on Instruction, so Monge was
the leading advocate of institutions of higher learning. He was an
active member of the Commission of Public Works, charged with the
establishment of an appropriate institution in 1794. The school was the
famous E´cole Polytechnique, which took form so rapidly that students
were admitted in the following year. At all stages of its creation,
Monge’s role was essential, both as administrator and as teacher. It is
gratifying to note that the two functions are not incompatible, for
Monge was eminently successful in both. He was even able to overcome his
reluctance about writing textbooks, for in the reform of the mathematics
curriculum, the need for suitable books was acute.</p>
<p>Descriptive and Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge found himself lecturing on two subjects that were both
essentially new to a university curriculum. The first of these was known
as stereotomy, now more commonly called descriptive geometry. Monge gave
a concentrated course in the subject to 400 students, and a manuscript
outline of the syllabus survives. This shows that the course was of
wider scope, both on the pure and the applied side, than is now usual.
Besides the study of shadow, perspective, and topography, attention was
paid to the properties of surfaces, including normal lines and tangent
planes, and to the theory of machines. Among the problems set by Monge,
for example, was that of determining the curve of intersection of two
surfaces, each of which is generated by a line that moves so as to
intersect three skew lines in space. Another was the determination of a
point in space equidistant from four lines.</p>
<p>Such problems point up a change in mathematical education that was
sponsored primarily by the French Revolution. As long ago as the Golden
Age of Greece, Plato had pointed out that the state of solid geometry
was deplorable, and the medieval decline in mathematics had hit solid
geometry harder than it had plane geometry. One who could not cross the
pons asinorum could scarcely be expected to reach the study of three
dimensions. Descartes and Fermat had been well aware of the fundamental
principle of solid analytic geometry that every equation in three
unknowns represents a surface, and conversely, but they had not taken
steps to develop it. Whereas the seventeenth century was the century of
curves—the cycloid; the limac¸on; the catenary; the lemniscate; the
equiangular spiral; the hyperbolas, parabolas, and spirals of Fermat;
the pearls of Sluse; and many others—the eighteenth was the century that
really began the study of surfaces. It was Euler who called attention to
the quadric surfaces as a family analogous to the conics, and his
Introductio, in a sense, established the subject of solid analytic
geometry (although Clairaut was a precursor). Lagrange, perhaps
influenced by his calculus of variations, manifested interest in
problems in three dimensions and emphasized their analytic solution. He
was the first, for example, to give the formula</p>
<p>ap1bq1cr 2 d</p>
<p>D5 p 2 2</p>
<p>a 1b 1c2</p>
<p>for the distance D from a point (p, q, r) to the plane ax1by1cz5d.
But Lagrange did not have a geometer’s heart, nor did he have
enthusiastic disciples. Monge, by contrast, was a specialist in geometry
as well as a superior teacher and a curriculum builder. Consequently,
the rise of solid geometry was due in part to the mathematical and
revolutionary activities of Gaspard Monge. Had he not been politically
active, the E´cole Polytechnique might never have come into being; had
he not been an inspiring teacher, the revival of geometry in three
dimensions might not have taken place.</p>
<p>The E´cole Polytechnique was not the only school created at the time.
The E´cole Normale had been hastily opened to some 1,400 or 1,500
students, less carefully selected than those at the E´cole
Polytechnique, and it boasted a mathematical faculty of high caliber,
Monge, Lagrange, Legendre, and Laplace being among the instructors. Due
to administrative difficulties, however the school was short-lived. It
was the lectures of Monge at the E´cole Normale in 1794 1795 that were
finally published as his Geom´ etrie descriptive´ .</p>
<p>The idea behind the new descriptive geometry, or method of double
orthographic projection, is essentially very easy to understand. One
simply takes two planes at right angles to each other, one vertical, the
other horizontal, and then projects the figure to be represented
orthogonally on these planes, the projections of all edges and vertices
being clearly indicated. The projection on the vertical plane is known
as the “elevation,” the other projection is called the “plan.” Finally,
the vertical plane is folded or rotated about the line of intersection
of the two planes until it also is horizontal. The elevation and the
plan thus provide one with a diagram in two dimensions of the
three-dimensional object. This simple procedure, now so common in
mechanical drawing, almost produced a revolution in military engineering
design in the days of Monge.</p>
<p>Descriptive geometry was not Monge’s only contribution to
threedimensional mathematics, for at the E´cole Polytechnique he also
taught a course in “application of analysis to geometry.” Just as the
abbreviated title “analytic geometry” had not yet come into general use,
there was also no “differential geometry,” but the course given by Monge
was essentially an introduction to this field. Here, too, no textbook
was available, so Monge found himself compelled to compose and print his
Feuilles d’analyse (1795) for the use of students. Here the analytic
geometry of three dimensions really came into its own; it was this
course, required of all students at the E´cole Polytechnique, that
formed the prototype of the present program in solid analytic geometry.
Students, however, evidently found the course difficult, for the
lectures skimmed very rapidly over the elementary forms of the line and
the plane, the bulk of the material being on the applications of the
calculus to the study of curves and surfaces in three dimensions. Monge
was ever reluctant to write textbooks on the elementary level or to
organize material that was not primarily his own. Yet he found
collaborators who were ready to edit material that he included in his
course, and so, in 1802, there appeared in the Journal de l’E´cole
Polytechnique an extensive memoir by Monge and Jean-Nicolas-Pierre
Hachette (1769 1834) on “Application d’alge<code>bre a</code> la geom´
etrie.” Its first theorem is typical of a more´ elementary approach to
the subject. It is the well-known eighteenthcentury generalization of
the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares of the projections of a
plane figure on three mutually perpendicular planes is equal to the
square of the area of the figure. Monge and Hachette proved the theorem
just as in modern courses; in fact, the whole volume could serve without
difficulty as a text in the twenty-first century. Equations for
transformations of axes, the usual treatment of lines and planes, and
the determination of the principal planes of a quadric are treated
fully. It is in the analytic geometry of Monge that we first find a
systematic study of the straight line in three dimensions.</p>
<p>Most of Monge’s results on the analytic geometry of the line and the
plane were given in memoirs dating from 1771. In his systematic
arrangement of the material in the Feuilles d’analyse of 1795 and
especially in the 1802 memoir with Hachette, we find most of the solid
analytic geometry and the elementary differential geometry that are
included in undergraduate college textbooks. One thing that might be
missed is the explicit use of determinants, for this was the work of the
nineteenth century. Nevertheless, we might, as in the case of Lagrange,
look on Monge’s use of symmetric notations as an anticipation of
determinants but without the now customary arrangement (due to Arthur
Cayley).</p>
<p>Among the new results given by Monge are two theorems that bear his
name: (1) The planes drawn through the midpoints of the edges of a
tetrahedron perpendicular to the opposite edges meet at a point M (which
has since been called the “Monge point” of the tetrahedron); M turns out
to be the midpoint of the segment joining the centroid and the
circumcenter. (2) The locus of the vertices of the trirectangular angle
whose faces are tangent to a given quadric surface is a sphere, known as
the “Monge sphere,” or director sphere, of the quadric. The equivalent
of this locus in two dimensions leads to what is called the “Monge
circle” of a conic, even though the locus had been given a century
earlier in synthetic form by Lahire. In 1809, Monge proved in various
ways that the centroid of a tetrahedron is the point of concurrency of
the lines joining the midpoints of opposite edges; he also gave the
analogue of the Euler line in three-space, showing that for the
orthocentric tetrahedron, the centroid is twice as far from the
orthocenter as from the circumcenter. Lagrange was so impressed by the
work of Monge that he is said to have exclaimed, “With his application
of analysis to geometry, this devil of a man will make himself
immortal.”</p>
<h4 id="textbooks-1">Textbooks</h4>
<p>Monge was a capable administrator, an imaginative research
mathematician, and an inspiring teacher. The pupils of Monge let loose a
spate of elementary textbooks on analytic geometry such as has never
been equaled—not even in our own day. If we judge from the sudden
appearance of so many analytic geometries beginning in 1798, a
revolution had taken place in mathematical instruction. Analytic
geometry, which for a century and more had been overshadowed by the
calculus, suddenly achieved a recognized place in the schools. This
“analytical revolution” can be credited primarily to Monge. Between the
years 1798 and 1802, four elementary analytic geometries appeared from
the pens of Sylvestre Franc¸ois Lacroix (1765 1843), Jean-Baptiste Biot
(1774 1862), Louis Puissant (1769 1843), and F. L. Lefranc¸ois, all
directly inspired by the lectures at the E´cole Polytechnique.
Polytechnicians were responsible for as many books again in the next
decade. Most of these were eminently successful texts, appearing in
numerous editions. The volume by Biot achieved a fifth edition in less
than a dozen years; that by Lacroix, a student and colleague of Monge’s,
appeared in twenty-five editions within ninety-nine years! Perhaps we
should speak instead of the “textbook revolution,” for Lacroix’s other
textbooks were almost as spectacularly successful, his Arithmetic and
his Geometry appearing in 1848 in the twentieth and sixteenth editions,
respectively. The twentieth edition of his Algebra was published in
1859, and the ninth edition of his Calculus in 1881.</p>
<p>Lacroix on Analytic Geometry</p>
<p>Monge is known to most readers as a founder of modern synthetic
geometry. But there is an aspect of Monge’s work that is less well
known. Virtually without exception, the textbook writers in analytic
geometry ascribe the inspiration for their work to Monge, although
Lagrange is occasionally mentioned as well. Lacroix most clearly
expressed the point of view as follows:</p>
<p>In carefully avoiding all geometric constructions, I would have the
reader realize that there exists a way of looking at geometry which one
might call analytic geometry, and which consists in deducing the
properties of extension from the smallest possible number of principles
by purely analytic methods, as Lagrange has done in his mechanics with
regard to the properties of equilibrium and movement.</p>
<p>Lacroix held that algebra and geometry “should be treated separately,
as far apart as they can be; and that the results in each should serve
for mutual clarification, corresponding, so to speak, to the text of a
book and its translation.” Lacroix believed that Monge “was the first
one to think of presenting in this form the application of algebra to
geometry.” Lacroix admitted that his own section on solid analytic
geometry was almost entirely the work of Monge.</p>
<p>The phrase “analytic geometry” seems to have first been used as the
title of a textbook by Lefranc¸ois in the second edition of his Essais
de geom´ etrie analytiques´ of 1804 and by Biot in an 1805 edition of
his Essais de geom´ etrie analytique´ , the latter of which, translated
into English as well as other languages, was used for many years at
West</p>
<p>Point.</p>
<h4 id="carnot">Carnot</h4>
<p>Monge was an outstanding figure of the revolution, yet the
mathematician whose name was on the tongue of every Frenchman during the
revolution was not Monge but Carnot. Lazare Carnot (1753 1823), was
sufficiently above bourgeois standing to be permitted to attend the
E´cole Militaire at Mezie`res, where Monge was one of his teachers. On
graduation, Carnot entered the army, although, lacking a title, he could
not, under the ancien regime, aspire to a rank above that of captain.
The´ proverb arose at examination time that “the competent were not
noble and the noble were not competent.”</p>
<p>It was Lazare Carnot who, when the success of the revolution was
threatened by confusion within and invasion from without, organized the
armies and led them to victory. As ardent a republican as Monge, Carnot
nevertheless shunned all political cliques. Having a high sense of
intellectual honesty, he tried to be impartial in reaching decisions.
After investigation, he absolved the royalists of the infamous charge
that they had mixed powdered glass in flour intended for the
revolutionary armies, but he felt bound by conscience to vote for the
death of the king.</p>
<p>C arnot</p>
<p>Reasoned impartiality, however, is difficult to maintain in times of
crisis, and Robespierre, whom Carnot had antagonized, threatened that
Carnot would lose his head at the first military disaster. But Carnot
had won the admiration of his countrymen for his remarkable military
successes, and when a voice in the Convention proposed his arrest, the
deputies spontaneously rose to his defense, acclaiming him the
“Organizer of Victory.” It was instead the head of Robespierre that
fell, and Carnot survived to take an active part in the formation of the
E´cole Polytechnique. Carnot was greatly interested in education at all
levels, even though he seems never to have taught a class. His son
Hippolyte served as minister of public instruction in 1848. (Another
son, Sadi, became a celebrated physicist, and a grandson, also named
Sadi, became the fourth president of the Third French Republic.)</p>
<p>Carnot led a charmed political life until 1797. He had gone from the
National Assembly to the Legislative Assembly, to the National
Convention, to the powerful Committee of Public Safety, to the Council
of Five Hundred and the Directorate. In 1797, however, he refused to
join a partisan coup d’etat and was promptly ordered deported. His name
was´ stricken from the roles of the Institut, and his chair of geometry
was voted unanimously to General Bonaparte. Even Monge, a fellow
republican and mathematician, approved the intellectual outrage. Monge
seems to have been mesmerized by Napoleon. Monge followed his idol
through thick and thin, his devotion being such that he literally became
sick every time Napoleon lost a battle. This is in contrast to Carnot,
who was responsible for Bonaparte’s rise to power through his
appointment to the Italian campaign, but who did not hesitate to oppose
him.</p>
<p>Mathematically, Carnot’s proscription turned out to be a good thing,
for it gave him an opportunity, while in exile, to complete a work that
had been on his mind for some time. By 1786, he had published a second
edition of his Essai sur les machines en general, as well as some verses
and a work on fortifications. But the work that Carnot had been planning
during his politically busy days was, mirabile dictu, the Reflexions sur
la´ metaphysique du calcul infinit´ esimal´ , which appeared in 1797.
This was not a work on applied mathematics; it came closer to philosophy
than to physics, and in this respect, it adumbrated the period of rigor
and concern for foundations that was so typical of the next century.</p>
<p>Metaphysics of the Calculus and Geometry</p>
<p>During the second half of the eighteenth century, there was
enthusiasm for the results of the calculus but confusion about its basic
principles. Not one of the usual approaches, whether by the fluxions of
Newton, the differentials of Leibniz, or the limits of d’Alembert,
seemed to be satisfying. Hence, Carnot, considering the conflicting
interpretations, sought to show “in what the veritable spirit” of the
new analysis consisted. In his selection of the unifying principle,
however, he made a most deplorable choice. He concluded that “the true
metaphysical principles” are “the principles of the compensation of
errors.” Infinitesimals, he argued, are “quantites´ inappreciables,”
which, like imaginary numbers, are introduced only to´ facilitate the
computation and are eliminated in reaching the final result. “Imperfect
equations” are made “perfectly exact,” in the calculus, by eliminating
the quantities, such as infinitesimals of higher order, the presence of
which occasioned the errors. To the objection that vanishing quantities
either are or are not zero, Carnot responded that “what are called
infinitely small quantities are not simply any null quantities at all,
but rather null quantities assigned by a law of continuity which
determines the relationship”—an argument that is strongly reminiscent of
Leibniz. The diverse approaches to the calculus, he claimed, were
nothing but simplifications of the ancient method of exhaustion,
reducing this in various ways to a convenient algorithm. Carnot’s
Reflexions´ enjoyed a wide popularity, appearing in many languages and
editions. Unsuccessful though its synthesis of views was, it undoubtedly
helped make mathematicians dissatisfied with the “abominable little
zeros” of the eighteenth century and helped lead toward the age of rigor
in the nineteenth. Carnot’s reputation today, however, depends primarily
on other works.</p>
<p>In 1801, he published De la correlation des figures de geometrie´ ,
again a work characterized by its high degree of generality. In it,
Carnot sought to establish for pure geometry a universality comparable
to that enjoyed by analytic geometry. He showed that several of Euclid’s
theorems can be regarded as specific instances of a more inclusive
theorem for which a single demonstration suffices. We find in the
Elements, for instance, the theorem that if two chords AD and BC in a
circle intersect in a point K, the product of AK by KD is equal to the
product of BK by KC (Fig. 18.1). Later, we run across the theorem that
if KDA and KCB are secants to a circle, the product of AK by KD is equal
to the product of BK by KC. These two theorems Carnot would regard
merely as special cases, correlated through the use of negative
quantities, of a general property of</p>
<p>C arnot</p>
<p>lines and circles. If we note that for the chords CK5CB2BK, whereas
for the secants CK5BK2CB, the relationship AKKD5CKKB can be carried over
from the one case to the other simply by a change of sign. And tangency
is only another case in which B and C, say, coincide, so that BC50.
Although the graphical representation of complex numbers had not yet
come into general use, Carnot did not hesitate to also suggest a
correlation of figures through imaginary numbers. He cited as an example
the fact that the circle y2 5a2 2x2 is related to the hyperbola y2 5x2
2a2 through the identity x2 2a2 5ðp21Þ2ða2 2x2Þ.</p>
<p>Geom´ etrie de Position´</p>
<p>Carnot greatly expanded his correlation of figures in his Geom´ etrie
de´ position in 1803, a book that placed him beside Monge as a founder
of modern pure geometry. The development of mathematics has been
characterized by a striving for ever higher and higher degrees of
generality, and it is this quality that gives significance to the work
of Carnot. His penchant for generalization led him to beautiful
analogues of well-known theorems of plane geometry. The equivalent of
the familiar law of cosines in trigonometry, a2 5b2 1c2 22bc cos A, had
been known at least as far back as the days of Euclid; Carnot extended
this ancient theorem to an equivalent form, a2 5b2 1c2 1d2 22cd cos
B22bd cos C22bc cos D, for a tetrahedron, where a, b, c, and d are the
areas of the four faces and B, C, and D are the angles between the faces
of areas c and d, b and d, and b and c, respectively. The passion for
generality that is found in his work has been the driving force of
modern mathematics.</p>
<p>The Geom´ etrie de position´ is a classic in pure geometry, but it
also contains significant contributions to analysis. Although analytic
geometry had completely overshadowed synthetic geometry for more than a
century, its supremacy had been won in terms of two coordinate systems,
rectangular and polar. In the rectangular system, the coordinates of a
point P in a plane are the distances of P from two mutually
perpendicular lines or axes; in the polar system, one of the coordinates
of P is the distance of P from a fixed point O (the pole), and the other
is the angle that line OP makes with a fixed line (polar axis) through
O. Carnot saw that coordinate systems could be modified in many ways.
For example, the coordinates of P may be the distances of P from two
fixed points O and Q, or one coordinate may be the distance OP and the
other the area of the triangle OPQ. In such generalizations, Carnot
simply rediscovered and extended a suggestion that Newton had made but
that had been generally overlooked; however, Carnot’s thought
characteristically carried him further. In all of the cases so far
considered, the equation of a curve depends on the particular coordinate
frame of reference that is used, yet the properties of a curve are not
bound to any one choice of pole or axes. It should be possible, Carnot
reasoned, to find coordinates that do not “depend on any particular
hypothesis or on any basis of comparison taken in absolute space.” Thus,
he initiated the search for what are now known as intrinsic coordinates.
One of these he found in the familiar radius of curvature of a curve at
a point. For the other, he introduced a quantity to which he gave no
name but that has since come to be called aberrancy, or angle of
deviation. This is an extension of the ideas of tangency and curvature.
The tangent to a curve at a point P is the limiting position of a secant
line PQ as Q approaches P along the curve; the circle of curvature is
the limiting position of the circle through the points P, Q, and R as Q
and R approach P along the curve. If, now, one passes a parabola through
points P, Q, R, and S and finds the limiting position of this parabola
as the points Q, R, and S approach P along the curve, the aberrancy at P
is the angle between the axis of this parabola and the normal to the
curve. Aberrancy is related to the third derivative of a function, in
much the same sense that slope and curvature are related to the first
and second derivatives, respectively.</p>
<p>Transversals</p>
<p>Carnot’s name is known among mathematicians for a theorem that bears
his name, which appeared in 1806 in an Essai sur la theorie des
transversales´ . This, again, is an extension of an ancient result.
Menelaus of Alexandria had shown that if a straight line intersects the
sides AB, BC, and CA of a triangle (or these sides extended) in points
P, Q, and R, respectively, and if au 5AP, bu 5BQ, cu 5CR and av 5AR, bv
5BP, cv 5CQ, then aubucu 5avbvcv (Fig. 18.2). Carnot showed that if the
straight line in the theorem of Menelaus is replaced by a curve of order
n that intersects AB in the (real or imaginary) points P1, P2, P3,…, Pn,
BC in the points Q1, Q2, Q3,…, Qn, and CA in the points R1, R2, R3,…,
Rn, then the theorem of Menelaus holds if one takes au as the product of
the n distances AP1, AP2, AP3,…, APn, with similar definitions for bu
and cu and analogous definitions for av, bv, and cv (Fig. 18.3). The
theory of transversals is only a small part</p>
<p>L aplace</p>
<p>of a work that contains other interesting generalizations. From the
familiar formula of Heron of Alexandria for the area of a triangle in
terms of its three sides, Carnot went on to a corresponding result for
the volume of the tetrahedron in terms of its six edges; finally, he
derived a formula, consisting of 130 terms, for finding the tenth of the
ten segments joining five points at random in space if the other nine
are known.</p>
<h4 id="laplace">Laplace</h4>
<p>Pierre Simon Laplace (1749 1827) was also born without wealth; like
Monge, he found influential friends who saw that he obtained an
education, again in a military academy. Laplace took virtually no part
in revolutionary activities. He seems to have had a strong sense of
intellectual honesty in science, but in politics he was without
convictions. This does not mean that he was timid, for he seems to have
associated freely with those of his scientific colleagues who were
suspect during the period of crisis. It has been said that he, too,
would have been in danger of the guillotine except for his contributions
to science, but this statement seems to be questionable, because he
often appeared to be a brazen opportunist. His publications were
primarily on celestial mechanics, in which he stands preeminent in the
period since Newton.</p>
<h4 id="probability-3">Probability</h4>
<p>The theory of probability owes more to Laplace than to any other
mathematician. From 1774 on, he wrote many memoirs on the subject, the
results of which he embodied in the classic Theorie analytique des´
probabilites´ of 1812. He considered the theory from all aspects and at
all levels, and his Essai philosophique des probabilite´ of 1814 is an
introductory account for the general reader. Laplace wrote that “at the
bottom the theory of probabilities is only common sense expressed in
numbers,” but his Theorie analytique´ shows the hand of a master analyst
who knows his advanced calculus. It is replete with integrals involving
beta and gamma functions, and Laplace was among the earliest to show
that 2NNe2x2dx, the area under the probability curve is pπ. Although the
method by which he achieved this result was somewhat artificial, it is
not far removed from the modern device of transforming</p>

<p>which is easily evaluated and leads to</p>

been all but forgotten for thirty-five years. This is sometimes known as
the Buffon-Laplace needle problem, inasmuch as Laplace extended the
original problem to a crisscross of two mutually perpendicular sets of
equidistant parallel lines. If the distances are a and b, the
probability that a needle of length l (less than a and b) will fall on
one of the lines is</p>
<p>2lða1bÞ2l2 p5:</p>
<p>πab</p>
<p>Laplace also rescued from oblivion the work of the Reverend Thomas
Bayes (1761) on inverse probability. Furthermore, we find in Laplace’s
book the theory of least squares, invented by Legendre, together with a
formal proof that Legendre had failed to give. The Theorie analytique´
also contains the Laplace transform, which is so useful in differential
equations. If fðxÞ5ÐN0 extgðtÞdt; the function f(x) is said to be the
Laplace transform of the function g(x).</p>
<p>Celestial Mechanics and Operators</p>
<p>The works of Laplace involve a considerable application of higher
mathematical analysis. Typical was his studyof the conditions for the
equilibrium of a rotating fluid mass, a subject that he had considered
in connection with the nebular hypothesis of the origin of the solar
system. In 1796, the
hypothesishadbeenpresentedinapopularforminExpositiondusyste`medu</p>

.AccordingtothetheoryofLaplace,thesolarsystem evolved from an

conservation of angular momentum, until successive rings broke off from

remaining central core of the nebula. The idea behind this hypothesis
was not entirely original with Laplace, for it had been proposed in
qualitative skeletal form by Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant, but the
quantitative fleshing out of the theory forms part of the multivolume
Mecanique c´ eleste´ . It is also in this classic that we find, in
connection with the attraction of a spheroid on a particle, the
Laplacian use of the idea of potential and the Laplace equation. In a
highly technical paper of 1782 on “Theorie des´ attractions des spheroı´
¨des et de la figure des plane`tes,” also included in the Mecaniquec´
eleste´ ,Laplacedevelopedtheveryusefulconceptofpotential— a function
whose directional derivative at every point is equal to the component of
the field intensity in the given direction. Also of fundamental
importance in astronomy and mathematical physics is the so-called
Laplacian of a function u5f(x, y, z). This is simply the sum of the
second-order partial derivatives of u, namely, uxx 1uvv 1uzz, often
abbreviated r2u (“del-square”), where r2 is called Laplace’s operator.
The function r2u is independent of the particular coordinate system that
is used; under certain conditions, gravitational, electrical, and other
potentials satisfy the Laplace equation uxx 1uyy 1uzz 50. Euler had run
across this equation somewhat incidentally in 1752 in studies on
hydrodynamics, but Laplace made it a standard part of mathematical
physics.</p>
<p>The publication of the Mecanique c´ eleste´ of Laplace is commonly
regarded as marking the culmination of the Newtonian view of
gravitation. Accounting for all of the perturbations in the solar
system, Laplace showed the motions to be secular, so that the system
could be regarded as stable. There no longer appeared to be any need for
occasional divine intervention. Napoleon is said to have commented to
Laplace on the latter’s failure to mention God in his monumental work,
whereupon Laplace is reported to have replied, “I have no need for that
hypothesis.” Lagrange, being told about this, is quoted as saying, “Ah,
but it is a beautiful hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Laplace completed not only the gravitational portion of Newton’s
Principiabutalsosomepointsinthephysics.Newtonhadcomputedavelocityof
soundonpurelytheoreticalgrounds,onlytofindthatthecalculationresulted in
toosmall a value for the speed. In 1816, Laplace was the first one to
point out that the lack of agreement between calculated and observed
speeds was due to the fact that the computations in the Principia were
based on the assumption of isothermal compressions and expansions,
whereas in reality the oscillations for sound are so rapid that
compressions are adiabatic, thereby increasing the elasticity of the air
and the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The minds of Laplace and Lagrange, the two leading mathematicians of
the revolution, were in many ways direct opposites. For Laplace, nature
was the essence, and mathematics was only a kit of tools that he handled
with extraordinary skill; for Lagrange, mathematics was a sublime art
that was its own excuse for being. The mathematics of the Mecanique´
celeste´ has often been described as difficult, but no one calls it
beautiful; the Mecanique analytique´ , on the other hand, has been
admired as “a scientific poem” in the perfection and grandeur of its
structure.</p>
<h4 id="legendre">Legendre</h4>
<p>Adrien Marie Legendre (1752 1833) experienced no difficulty in
securing an education, but even he was not a university teacher in the
strict sense, although for five years he taught in the E´cole Militaire
in Paris. Like Carnot, he felt the need for greater rigor in
mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="geometry-1">Geometry</h2>
<p>The lack of rigor in geometry as portrayed by Bezout’s´ Cours de
mathematiques´ prompted Legendre, who was, after all, primarily an
analyst, to revive some of the intellectual quality of Euclid. The
result was the E´lements de g´ eom´ etrie´ , which appeared in 1794, the
year of the Terror. Here, too, we see the very antithesis of what is
generally regarded as practical. As Legendre said in the preface, his
object is to present a geometry that shall satisfy l’esprit. The result
of Legendre’s efforts was a remarkably successful textbook, for twenty
editions appeared within the author’s lifetime.</p>
<p>We are prone to forget that during much of the nineteenth century, it
was French mathematics that dominated American teaching, and this was
primarily through the work of the men whom we have been considering.
Textbooks by Lacroix, Biot, and Lagrange were published in America for
use in the schools, but perhaps the most influential of all was the
geometry of Legendre. Davies’ Legendre became almost a synonym for
geometry in America.</p>
<p>Elliptic Integrals</p>
<p>The success of Legendre’s E´lements´ should not lead one to think of
the author as a geometer. The fields in which Legendre made significant
advances were numerous but chiefly nongeometric—differential equations,
calculus, theory of functions, theory of numbers, and applied
mathematics. He composed a three-volume treatise, Exercices du calcul
integral´</p>
<p>L e gendr e</p>
<p>(1811 1819), that rivaled Euler’s for comprehensiveness and
authoritativeness; later, he expanded aspects of this in another three
volumes that comprised the Traite des fonctions elliptiques et des int´
egrales eul´ eriennes´ (1825 1832). In these important treatises, as
well as in earlier memoirs, Legendre introduced the name “Eulerian
integrals” for the beta and gamma functions. More important, he provided
some basic tools of analysis, so helpful to mathematical physicists,
that bear his name. Among these are the Legendre functions, which are
solutions of the Legendre differential equation (12x2)yv 22xyu
1n(n11)y50. Polynomial solutions for positive integral values of n are
known as Legendre polynomials.</p>
<p>Legendre spent much effort in reducing elliptic integrals
(quadratures root of a polynomial of the third or fourth degree) to
three standardÐ of the form R(x, s)dx, where R is a rational function
and s is the square</p>
<p>forms that have since borne his name. The elliptic integrals of the
first and second kind in Legendre’s form are</p>

varying values of φ, can be found in most comprehensive handbooks, for
the integrals arise in many problems. Legendre’s elliptic integral of
the first kind arises naturally in solving the differential equation for
the motion of a simple pendulum; that of the second kind appears in
seeking the length of arc of an ellipse. Elliptic integrals also arose
in Legendre’s earlier memoirs, especially in one of 1785 on the
gravitational attraction of an ellipsoid, a problem in connection with
which there appeared what are known as zonal harmonics or “Legendre’s
coefficients”—functions used effectively by Laplace in potential
theory.</p>
<p>Legendre was an important figure in geodesy, and in this connection,
he developed the statistical method of least squares. A simple case of
the method of least squares may be described as follows. If observations
have led to three or more approximate equations in two variables, say,
a1x 1 b1y1c1 50, a2x1b2y1c2 50, and a3x1b3y1c3 50, one adopts as the
“best” values of x and y the solution of the two simultaneous equations

<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers-3">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>The Memoirs of the Institut also contain one of Legendre’s attempts
to prove the parallel postulate, but of all of his contributions to
mathematics, Legendre was most pleased with the works on elliptic
integrals and the theory of numbers. He published a two-volume Essai sur
la theorie des nombres´ (1797 1798), the first treatise to be devoted
exclusively to the subject. The famous “last theorem of Fermat”
attracted him, and in about 1825, he gave a proof of its insolvability
for n55. Almost equally famous is a theorem on congruences that Legendre
published in the treatise of 1797 1798. If, given integers p and q,
there exists an integer x such that x2 2q is divisible by p, then q is
known as a quadratic residue of p; we now write (following a notation
introduced by Carl Friedrich Gauss) x2 q (mod p), reading this as “x2 is
congruent to q modulo p.”</p>
<p>Legendre rediscovered a beautiful theorem, given earlier in less
modern form by Euler, known as the law of quadratic reciprocity: if p
and q are odd primes, then the congruences x2 q (mod p) and x2 p (mod q)
are either both solvable or both unsolvable, unless both p and q are of
the form 4n13, in which case one is solvable and the other is not. For
example, x2 13 (mod 17) has the solution x582, and x2 17 (mod 13) has
the solution x511, and it can be shown that x 2 5 (mod 13) and x2 13
(mod 5) have no solution. On the other hand, x 19 (mod 11) is not
solvable, whereas x2 11 (mod 19) has the solution x57. The theorem is
here stated in the customary modern form. In the exposition of Legendre,
it becomes</p>
<p>5ð21Þðp 1Þðq 1Þ=4; p q q p</p>
<p>where the Legendre symbol (p/q) denotes 1 or 21, according as x2 p
(mod q) is, or is not, solvable for x.</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Euclid, it had been known that the number of
primes is infinite, yet it is obvious that the density of prime numbers
decreases as we move on to ever larger integers. Hence, it became one of
the most famous problems to describe the distribution of primes among
the natural numbers. Mathematicians were looking for a rule, known as
the prime number theorem, that should express the number of primes less
than a given integer n as a function of n, usually written π(n). In his
well-known treatise of 1797 1798, Legendre conjectured, on the basis of
a count of a large number of primes, that π(n) approaches
n/(lnn21.08366) as n increases indefinitely. This conjecture comes close
to the truth, but a precise statement of the theorem that πðnÞ-n = lnn,
suggested several times during the following century, was not proved
until 1896. Legendre showed that there is no rational algebraic</p>
<p>Par i s in t he 1820 s</p>
<p>function that always gives primes, but he noted that n2 1n117 is
prime for all values of n from 1 to 16 and 2n2 129 is prime for values
of n from 1 to 28. (Earlier, Euler had shown that n2 2n141 is prime for
values of n from 1 to 40.)</p>
<h4 id="aspects-of-abstraction">Aspects of Abstraction</h4>
<p>In looking at the achievements of these six men, one is struck by a
lack of utilitarian motive in their work. Carnot’s deals with broad
principles, not with technology. The Mecanique´ of Lagrange is likewise
concerned with a postulational treatment of the subject, far removed
from criteria of practicability. It is primarily to him that we owe such
compact forms, though somewhat differently expressed, as</p>
<p>x y z 1</p>
<p>x1 y1 1 231 231 123</p>
<p>1 1 x4 y4 z4 1 x2 y2 1 and</p>
<p>2!3 3 3! x y z 1 x y 1</p>
<p>x y z 1</p>
<p>for the area of a triangle and for the volume of a tetrahedron,
respectively, results that appeared in a paper, “Solutions analytiques
de quelques proble`mes sur les pyramides triangulaires,” delivered in
1773 and published in 1775. Such work looks pretty but inconsequential,
yet it contained an idea that was to become, through the educational
reforms of the revolution, very important. As Lagrange expressed it, “I
flatter myself that the solutions which I am going to give will be of
interest to geometers as much for the methods as for the results. These
solutions are purely analytic and can even be understood without
figures.” True to his promise, there is not a single diagram throughout
the work. Monge, too, although he used diagrams and models in
descriptive and differential geometry, somehow seems to have come to the
conclusion that one should avoid the use of diagrams in elementary
analytic geometry. Perhaps Carnot felt somewhat the same way, for his
Essai, antedating the Mecanique´ of Lagrange, contains not a single
diagram.</p>
<p>Paris in the1820s</p>
<p>Paris appeared particularly attractive to students of mathematics in
the 1820s. Not only did it boast the opportunity for systematic training
epitomized by the E´cole Polytechnique, with its sizable staff of
exceptional mathematicians who offered lectures on a wide area of
subjects in pure and applied fields, but there were cutting-edge
mathematical publications. Aside from independent works printed in the
French capital, both the Memoires´ of the Academy of Sciences and the
Journal of the E´cole Polytechnique reported major new mathematical
research results. Moreover, the Colle`ge de France and other
institutions harbored additional mathematicians. Still living in Paris,
though at the end of their careers, were Laplace and Legendre. Laplace
published the last volume of his Mecanique celeste´ in 1825, two years
before his death. Legendre was active in the Academy, reviewing the work
of younger men and updating his own results, such as his standard work
on number theory, the third edition of which appeared in 1830. Perhaps
the most influential of the next generation of mathematicians who was
active in Paris in the 1820s was J.-B. Fourier (1768 1830).</p>
<h4 id="fourier">Fourier</h4>
<p>Fourier was the son of a tailor in Auxerre. Having been orphaned in
childhood, he obtained his education through the guidance of the Church,
first at the local military school, then in a school run by the
Benedictine Order. During the revolution, he taught school in his
hometown and was politically active. Arrested during the Terror, on his
release he enrolled in the E´cole Normale, which led to his becoming an
assistant to Lagrange and Monge at the newly formed E´cole
Polytechnique. In 1798, he joined Monge in Napoleon’s Egyptian
adventure, subsequently becoming secretary of the Institut d’E´gypte and
compiling the Description de l’E´gypte. On his return to France, he held
a number of administrative posts, but he nevertheless had opportunity to
continue his scholarly pursuits. In 1822, he was elected secretaire
perpetuel´ of the Academie´ des Sciences in Paris, which placed him in
an influential position during the 1820s. Among the young foreigners in
Paris in the 1820s who came under Fourier’s influence were P. G. Lejeune
Dirichlet (1805 1859) from Prussia, Jean-Jacques-Franc¸ois Sturm (1803
1855) from Switzerland, and Mikhail Vasilievich Ostrogradsky (1801 1861)
from Russia. Compatriots who benefited from his counsel included Sophie
Germain (1776 1831) and Joseph Liouville (1809 1882).</p>
<p>Fourier is best known today for his celebrated Theorie analytique de
la´ chaleur of 1822. This book, described by Lord Kelvin as “a great
mathematical poem,” was a development of ideas that ten years earlier
had won him the Academie prize for an essay on the mathematical´ theory
of heat. Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre, the referees, had criticized
the essay for a certain looseness of reasoning; the later clarification
of Fourier’s ideas was to some extent the reason that the nineteenth
century came to be called the age of rigor.</p>
<p>The chief contribution of Fourier and his classic in mathematics was
the idea, adumbrated by Daniel Bernoulli, that any function y5f(x) can
be represented by a series of the form</p>
<p>F our ier</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>y5a0 1a1 cosx1a2 cos2x1 1an cosnx1</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>1b1 sinx1b2 sin2x1 1bn sinnx1 ;</p>
<p>now known as a Fourier series. Such a series representation affords
considerably greater generality in the type of functions that can be
studied than does the Taylor series. Even if there are many points at
which the derivative does not exist (as in Fig. 18.4) or at which the
function is not continuous (as in Fig. 18.5), the function may still
have a Fourier expansion. This expansion is easily found on noting
that</p>
<p>1 π 1 π</p>
<p>a0 5ð fðxÞdx; an 5ð fðxÞcosnxdx; π 2π π 2π</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>1 π bn 5ð sinnxdx: π 2π</p>
<p>Fourier, like Monge, had fallen from grace when the Bourbon
restoration followed the exile of Napoleon in 1815, but his work has
ever</p>
<p>FIG. 18.5</p>
<p>since been fundamental in both physics and mathematics. Functions no
longer needed to be of the well-behaved form with which mathematicians
had been familiar. In 1837, Lejeune Dirichlet, for instance, suggested a
very broad definition of function: If a variable y is so related to a
variable x that whenever a numerical value is assigned to x, there is a
rule according to which a unique value of y is determined, then y is
said to be a function of the independent variable x. This comes close to
the modern view of a correspondence between two sets of numbers, but the
concepts of “set” and “real number” had not at that time been
established. To indicate the completely arbitrary nature of the rule of
correspondence, Dirichlet proposed a very “badly behaved” function: When
x is rational, let y5c, and when x is irrational, let y5d 6¼ c. This
function, often known as Dirichlet’s function, is so pathological that
there is no value of x for which it is continuous. Dirichlet also gave
the first rigorous proof of the convergence of a Fourier series for a
function subject to certain restrictions, known as Dirichlet’s
conditions. A Fourier series does not always converge to the value of a
function from which it is derived, but in Leopold Crelle’s Journal for
1828, Dirichlet proved the following theorem: If f(x) is periodic of
period 2π, if for2π, x,π the function f(x) has a finite number of
maximum and minimum values and a finite number of discontinuities, and
if Ð2ππ fðxÞdx is finite, then the Fourier series converges to f(x) at
all points where f(x) is continuous, and at jump points it converges to
the arithmetic mean of the right-hand and left-hand limits of the
function. Also useful is another theorem known as Dirichlet’s test: If
the terms in the series a1b1 1a2b2 1 1anbn 1 are such that the b’s are
positive and monotonically tending toward zero, and if there is a number
M such that ja1 1a2 1 1amj,M for all values of m, then the series
converges.</p>
<p>The name of Dirichlet arises in many other connections in pure and
applied mathematics. Especially important in thermodynamics and
electrodynamics is the Dirichlet problem: Given a region R bounded by a
closed curve C and a function f(x, y) continuous on C, find a function
F(x, y) continuous in R and on C that satisfies the Laplace equation in
R and is equal to f on C. In pure mathematics, Dirichlet is well-known
for his application of analysis to the theory of numbers, in connection
with which he introduced the Dirichlet series, Σane2λnS, where the
Dirichlet coefficients an are complex numbers, the Dirichlet exponents
λn are real monotonically increasing numbers, and S is a complex
variable.</p>
<h4 id="cauchy">Cauchy</h4>
<p>The star of the 1820s was a man born in the year of the revolution,
when Fourier was twenty-one. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789 1857), the son
of well-educated parents, studied at the E´cole Polytechnique, which
he</p>
<p>entered in 1805, and the E´cole des Ponts et Chaussees, where he
matri-´ culated in 1807. He served as an engineer until 1813, when he
returned to Paris. By that time, he had already solved several problems
of interest to mathematicians. These included the determination of a
convex polyhedron by its faces, the expression of a number as a sum of
n-gonal numbers, and a study of determinants. The latter is one of the
few branches in which the role of Gauss was slight, although it was from
the terminology of Gauss in a somewhat different context that Cauchy
derived the name “determinant” for what he otherwise described as a
class of alternating symmetric functions, such as a1b2 2b1a2. A good
case could be made for having the definitive history of determinants
begin in 1812, when Cauchy read to the Institut a long memoir on the
subject, although in doing so, one would fail to do justice to some
pioneer work as early as 1772 by Laplace and Alexandre-Theophile
Vandermonde´ (1735 1796). Both Lagrange and Laplace had taken an
interest in Cauchy’s progress, and he followed in the tradition of
Lagrange in his preference for pure mathematics in elegant form with due
attention to rigorous proofs. His 1812 paper on determinants, to be
followed by many others from him on the same topic, was in this
tradition of giving emphasis to the symmetries of notation with which it
abounds.</p>
<p>In the pedagogical approach to determinants, today it is customary to
begin with the square array and then to attach a meaning or a value to
this through an expansion in terms of transpositions or permutations. In
the memoir of Cauchy, the author did the opposite. He began with the n
elements or numbers, a1, a2, a3,…an, and formed the product of these by
all of the differences of distinct elements: a1a2a3 …an(a2 2a1) (a3
2a1)…(an 2a1)(a3 2a2)…(an 2a2)…(an 2an 1). He then defined the
determinant as the expression obtained on changing every indicated power
into a second subscript, so that asr becomes ars; he wrote this as S (6
a11a2 2a33 …ann). Then he arranged the n2 different quantities in this
determinant in a square array not unlike that used today:</p>
<p>a1 1;a1 2;a1 3;…a1 n a2 1;a2 2;a2 3;…a2 n a n 1;an 2;an 3;…an n</p>
<p>As thus arranged, the n2 quantities in his determinant were said to
form “a symmetric system of order n.” He defined conjugate terms as
elements the orders of whose subscripts are reversed, and he called
terms that are selfconjugate “principal terms”; the product of the terms
in what we call the “main diagonal” or the “principal diagonal,” he
called the “principal product.” Later in the memoir, Cauchy gave other
rules for determining the sign of a term in the expansion, using
circular substitutions.</p>
<p>Cauchy’s eighty-four-page memoir of 1812 was not his only work on the
subject of determinants; from then on, he found many opportunities to
use them in a variety of situations. In a memoir of 1815, on wave
propagation, he applied the language of determinants to a problem in
geometry and also to one in physics. Cauchy asserted that if A, B, and C
are the lengths of three edges of a parallelepiped, and if the
projections of these on the x, y, and z axes of a rectangular coordinate
system are</p>
<p>A1; B1; C1 A2; B2; C2</p>
<p>A3; B3; C3;</p>
<p>then the volume of the parallelepiped will be A1B2C3 2A1B3C2 1
A2B3C12A2B1C3 1A3B1C2 2A3B2C1 5S(6A1B2C3). In the same memoir, in
connection with the propagation of waves, he applied his determinant
notation to partial derivatives, replacing a condition that required two
lines for its expression by the simple abbreviation</p>
<p>S 651: dx dy dz da db dc</p>
<p>The left-hand side of this is obviously what is now called the
“Jacobian” of x, y, z with respect to a, b, c. The name of Carl Gustav
Jacob Jacobi is attached to functional determinants of this form not
because he was the first to use them, but because he was an algorithm
builder who was especially enthusiastic about the possibilities inherent
in determinant notations. It was not until 1829 that Jacobi first used
the functional determinants that bear his name.</p>
<p>By this time, Cauchy was well established in Paris. In 1814, two
years after the memoir on determinants, he had presented to the French
Academy a paper that contains the germs of some of his major
contributions to the theory of complex functions. After another two
years, he received praise for a prize-winning memoir on hydrodynamics.
The year 1819 finds him displaying the method of characteristics in the
solution of partial differential equations; shortly thereafter, he
submitted a classic on the theory of elasticity. During this decade, he
was appointed to membership in the Academy of Sciences, as well as a
professorship at the E´cole Polytechnique; after this, he married.</p>
<p>Cauchy filled the Journal of the E´cole Polytechnique and the
Cornptes Rendus of the Academie with ever longer memoirs. These were on
a´ variety of topics but especially on the theory of functions of a
complex variable, a field of which, from 1814 on, Cauchy became the
effective founder. In 1806, Jean Robert Argand (1768 1822) of Geneva had
published an account of the graphical representation of complex numbers.
Although, at first, this went almost as unnoticed as the work of Caspar
Wessel, by the end of the second decade of the nineteenth century, most
of Europe was familiar, through Cauchy, not only with the
WesselArgand-Gaussian diagram for a complex number, but with the
fundamental properties of complex functions as well. In the eighteenth
century, problems in complex variables occasionally had arisen in
connection with the physics of Euler and d’Alembert, but now they became
a part of pure mathematics. Inasmuch as two dimensions are required for
a pictorial representation of the independent variable alone, it would
take four dimensions to graphically portray a functional relationship
between two complex variables, w5f(z). Complex variable theory entails a
higher degree of abstraction and complexity than does the study of
functions of a real variable. Definitions and rules of differentiation,
for example, cannot readily be carried over from the real case to the
complex, and the derivative in the latter case is no longer pictured as
the slope of the tangent to a curve. Without the crutch of
visualization, one is likely to require more precise and careful
definitions of concepts. To supply this need was one of Cauchy’s
contributions to the calculus, for both real variables and complex
variables.</p>
<p>The first teachers in the E´cole Polytechnique had set a precedent
according to which even the greatest of mathematicians are not above
writing textbooks on all levels, and Cauchy followed in this tradition.
In three books—Cours d’ analyse de l’E´cole Polytechnique (1821),
Resume´ des lec¸ons sur le calcul infinitesimal (1823), and Lec¸ons sur
le calcul differentiel´ (1829)—he gave to elementary calculus the
character that it bears today. Rejecting the “Taylor’s theorem approach”
of Lagrange, he made the limit concept of d’Alembert fundamental, but he
gave it an arithmetic character of greater precision. Dispensing with
geometry and with infinitesimals or velocities, he gave a relatively
clear-cut definition of limit:</p>
<p>When the successive values attributed to a variable approach
indefinitely a fixed value so as to end by differing from it by as
little as one wishes, this last is called the limit of all the
others.</p>
<p>Where many earlier mathematicians had thought of an infinitesimal as
a very small fixed number, Cauchy clearly defined it as a dependent
variable:</p>
<p>One says that a variable quantity becomes infinitely small when its
numerical value decreases indefinitely in such a way as to converge
toward the limit zero.</p>
<p>In the calculus of Cauchy, the concepts of function and limit of a
function were fundamental. In defining the derivative of y5f(x) with
respect to x, he gave to the variable x an increment Δx5i and formed the
ratio</p>
<p>Δy fðx1iÞ2fðxÞ</p>
<p>5 :</p>
<p>Δx i</p>
<p>The limit of this difference quotient as i approaches zero he defined
as the derivative fu(x) of y with respect to x. The differential he
relegated to a subsidiary role, although he was aware of its operational
facility. If dx is a finite quantity, the differential dy of y5f(x) is
defined simply as fu(x)dx. Cauchy also gave a satisfactory definition of
a continuous function. The function f(x) is continuous within given
limits if between these limits an infinitely small increment i in the
variable x always produces an infinitely small increment, f(x1i)2f(x),
in the function itself. When we bear in mind Cauchy’s definition of
infinitely small quantities in terms of limits, his definition of
continuity parallels that used today.</p>
<p>During the eighteenth century, integration had been treated as the
inverse of differentiation. Cauchy’s definition of derivative makes it
clear that the derivative will not exist at a point for which the
function is discontinuous, yet the integral may afford no difficulty.
Even discontinuous curves may determine a well-defined area. Hence,
Cauchy defined the definite integral in terms of the limit of the
integral sums in a manner not very different from that used in
elementary textbooks today, except that he took the value of the
function always at the left-hand end point of the interval. If Sn 5(x1
2x0)f(x0)1(x2 2x1 )f(x1) 1(X2xn 1) f(xn 1), then the limit S of this sum
Sn, as the magnitudes of the intervals xi 2xi 1 decrease indefinitely,
is the definite integral of the function f(x) for the interval from x5x0
to x5X. It is from Cauchy’s concept of the integral as a limit of a sum,
rather than from the antiderivative, that the many fruitful modern
generalizations of the integral have arisen.</p>
<p>Having defined the integral independently of differentiation, it was
necessary for Cauchy to prove the usual relation between the integral
and the antiderivative, and this he accomplished through use of the
theorem of mean value. If f(x) is continuous over the closed interval
〔a, b〕 and differentiable over the open interval (a, b), then there
will be some value x0 such that a,x0 ,b and f(b)2f(a)5(b2a)fu(x0). This
is a fairly obvious generalization of Rolle’s theorem, which was known a
century earlier. The mean-value theorem, however, did not attract
serious attention until the days of Cauchy, but it has since continued
to play a basic role in analysis. It is with justice, therefore, that a
still more general form,</p>
<p>fðbÞ2fðaÞ f 0ðx0Þ</p>
<p>5 gðbÞ2gðaÞ g0ðx0Þ</p>
<p>with suitable restrictions on f(x) and g(x), is known as Cauchy’s
meanvalue theorem.</p>
<p>The history of mathematics teems with cases of simultaneity and near
simultaneity of discovery, some of which have already been noted. The
work by Cauchy that we have just described is another case in point, for
similar views were developed at about the same time by Bernhard Bolzano
(1781 1848), a Czechoslovakian priest whose theological views were
frowned on by his church and whose mathematical work was most
undeservedly overlooked by his lay and clerical contemporaries. For a
time Cauchy lived at Prague, where Bolzano was born and died, yet there
is no indication that the men met. The similarity in their
arithmetization of the calculus and of their definitions of limit,
derivative, continuity, and convergence was only a coincidence. In 1817,
Bolzano had published a book, Rein analytischer Beweis, devoted to a
purely arithmetic proof of the location theorem in algebra, and this had
required a nongeometric approach to the continuity of a curve or a
function. Going considerably further in his unorthodox ideas, he
disclosed some important properties of infinite sets in a posthumous
work of 1850, Paradoxien des Unendlichen.</p>
<p>From Galileo’s paradox on the one-to-one correspondence between
integers and perfect squares, Bolzano went on to show that similar
correspondences between the elements of an infinite set and a proper
subset are commonplace. For example, a simple linear equation, such as
y52x, establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the real numbers y
in the interval from 0 to 2, for example, and the real numbers x in half
of this interval. That is, there are just as many real numbers between 0
and 1 as between 0 and 2, or just as many points in a line segment 1
inch long as in a line segment 2 inches long. Bolzano even seems to have
recognized, by about 1840, that the infinity of real numbers is of a
type different from the infinity of integers, being nondenumerable. In
such speculations on infinite sets, the Bohemian philosopher came closer
to parts of modern mathematics than had his better-known contemporaries.
Both Gauss and Cauchy seem to have had a kind of horror infiniti,
insisting that there could be no such thing as a completed infinite in
mathematics. Their work on “orders of infinity” in reality was far
removed from the concepts of Bolzano, for to say, as Cauchy in essence
did, that a function y is infinite of order n with respect to x if
limx-Ny=xn 5K 6¼ 0 is quite different from making a statement about
correspondences between sets.</p>
<p>Bolzano was a “voice crying in the wilderness,” and many of his
results had to be rediscovered later. Among these was the recognition
that there are pathological functions that do not behave as
mathematicians had always expected them to behave. Newton, for instance,
had assumed that curves are generated by smooth and continuous motions.
There might be occasional abrupt changes in direction or even some
discontinuities at isolated points, but during the first half of the
nineteenth century, it was generally assumed that a continuous real
function must have a derivative at most points. In 1834, however,
Bolzano had thought up a function continuous for an interval but,
despite physical intuition to the contrary, having no derivative at any
point in the interval. The example given by Bolzano unfortunately did
not become known; hence, credit for building the first continuous but
nowhere differentiable function generally goes to Karl Weierstrass about
a third of a century later. Similarly, it is the name of Cauchy, rather
than that of Bolzano, that is attached to an important test of
convergence for an infinite series or sequence. Occasionally, before
their time, there had been warnings about the need to test an infinite
series for convergence. For example, as early as 1812, Gauss used the
ratio test to show that his hypergeometric series</p>
<p>αβðα11Þðβ1Þ 1Þ 2</p>
<p>11x1x 1</p>
<p>1U2γðγ11 αβðα11Þðβ11Þ ðα1n21Þðβ1n21Þ n 1U2 ðn21Þγðγ11Þ ðλ1n21Þ x
1</p>
<p>converges for 7x7,1 and diverges for 7x7.1. This test seems to have
been first used much earlier, in England, by Edward Waring, although it
generally bears the name of d’Alembert or, more occasionally, that of
Cauchy. In 1811, Gauss informed an astronomer friend, F. W. Bessel
(1784</p>
<p>1846), of a discovery that he had made in what was soon to become a
new subject in the hands of Cauchy and that today bears the latter’s
name. The theory of functions of a real variable had been developed by
Lagrange, but the theory of functions of a complex variable awaited the
efforts of Cauchy, yet Gauss perceived a theorem of fundamental
significance in the as-yet-unworked field. If, in the complex or
Gaussian plane, one draws a simple closed curve, and if a function f(z)
of the complex variable z5x1iy is analytic (that is, has a derivative)
at every point on the curve and within the curve, then the line integral
of f(z) taken along the curve is zero.</p>
<p>The name of Cauchy appears today in connection with a number of
theorems on infinite series, for, despite some efforts on the part of
Gauss and Abel, it was largely through Cauchy that the mathematician’s
conscience was pricked concerning the need for vigilance with regard to
convergence. Having defined a series to be convergent if, for increasing
values of n, the sum Sn of the first n terms approaches a limit S,
called the sum of the series, Cauchy proved that a necessary and
sufficient condition that an infinite series converge is that for a
given value of p, the magnitude of the difference between Sn and Sn1p
tends toward zero as n increases indefinitely. This condition for
“convergence within itself” has come to be known as Cauchy’s criterion,
but it was known earlier to Bolzano (and possibly still earlier to
Euler).</p>
<p>In 1831, Cauchy also announced the theorem that an analytic function
of a complex variable w5f(z) can be expanded about a point z5z0 in a
power series that is convergent for all values of z within a circle
having z0 as center and passing through the singular point of f(z)
nearest to z0. From this time on, the use of infinite series became an
essential part of the theory of functions of both real and complex
variables. Several tests for convergence bear Cauchy’s name, as does a
particular form of the remainder in the Taylor series expansion of a
function, the more usual form being attributed to Lagrange. The period
of rigor in mathematics was taking hold rapidly. It is said that when
Cauchy read his first paper on the convergence of series to the
Academie, Laplace hurried home to verify´ that he had not made use of
any divergent series in his Mecanique c´ eleste´ . Toward the end of his
life, Cauchy became aware of the important notion of “uniform
convergence,” but here, too, he was not alone, having been anticipated
by the physicist G. G. Stokes (1819 1903) and others.</p>
<p>As broader classes of differential equations were considered, the
question under what conditions a solution exists moved to the
foreground. Cauchy provided two widely used methods for answering this
question. Building on the work of Euler, Cauchy showed how to use a
method of approximations by difference equations, providing an existence
proof for the approximate solutions; this became the basis of the
CauchyLipschitz technique in the solution of ordinary differential
equations. Rudolf Lipschitz (1831 1904), a student of Dirichlet’s,
refined and generalized Cauchy’s work in 1876; he replaced the so-called
Lipschitz condition with Cauchy’s condition that the first derivatives
be continuous and extended the work to systems of higher-order
equations. Also due to Cauchy, though best known in the form given by
the French mathematicians Briot and Jean-Claude Bouquet in 1854, is the
method of majorants, which Cauchy called his calcul des limites. After
successfully using it for ordinary differential equations, Cauchy
applied it to certain systems of first-order partial differential
equations. Here again, his work cametobe known in the generalized form
it received from a later nineteenth-century mathematician. Sofia
Kovalevskaya (Sonia Kowalewski) (1850 1891) extended Cauchy’s result to
a broad class of equations of higher order, simplifying his technique in
the process; further streamlined by subsequent analysts, the
Cauchy-Kowalewski theorem received its best-known form in a textbook by
E´douard Goursat (1858 1936) that was widely used in the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Because of the legendary, voluminous nature of his publications,
Cauchy often lost track of results he had obtained. Also, as often
happens, he assessed the relative significance of his own work quite
differently from the way later generations have seen it. The best-known
illustration of this is found in complex function theory; here, he had
provided a powerful tool for analysts with the so-called Cauchy integral
theorem, yet he attached far more significance to his “calculus of
residues,” which failed to gain favor with later workers in the
field.</p>
<p>The prolific Cauchy contributed to almost as many fields as did his
contemporary Gauss. He, too, contributed to mechanics and error theory.
Although in the theory of numbers, his work is less well known than that
of Legendre and Gauss, it is to Cauchy that we owe the first general
proof of one of the most beautiful and difficult theorems of Fermat—that
every positive integer is the sum of at most three triangular numbers or
four square numbers or five pentagonal numbers or six hexagonal numbers,
and so on, indefinitely. This proof is a fitting climax to the study of
figurate numbers initiated by the Pythagoreans some 2,300 years
earlier.</p>
<p>Cauchy evidently was little attracted to geometry in its various
forms. In 1811, however, in one of his very earliest memoirs, he
presented a generalization of the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula
E125 F1V, where E, F, and V are, respectively, the number of edges,
faces, and vertices of the polyhedron; we have noted a case of his
application of determinants in finding the volume of a tetrahedron.</p>
<h4 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h4>
<p>The leadership role of the mathematical community in Paris diminished
rapidly after 1830. This was due in part to the dying out of an older
generation; in part, to efforts elsewhere, notably in England and
Prussia, to establish mathematics more solidly; and, in part, to
political circumstances in France. After the deaths in 1827, 1830, and
1833, respectively, of Laplace, Fourier, and Legendre, and the departure
of Cauchy from Paris in 1830, the best-known French mathematician born
before the revolution and still active was Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781´
1840).</p>
<p>Poisson</p>
<p>Poisson would become a physician, but strong mathematical interests
led him in 1798 to enter the E´cole Polytechnique, where on graduation
he became successively a lecturer, a professor, and an examiner. He is
said to have once remarked that life is good for only two things: to do
mathematics and to teach it. Consequently, he published almost 400
works, and he enjoyed a reputation as an excellent instructor.</p>
<p>The direction of his research is indicated in part by a sentence from
a letter written in 1826 by Abel concerning the mathematicians in Paris:
“Cauchy is the only one occupied with pure mathematics; Poisson,
Fourier, Ampe`re, etc., busy themselves exclusively with magnetism and
other physical subjects.” This should not be taken too literally,
but</p>
<p>Di f fus ion</p>
<p>Poisson, in memoirs of 1812, did help make electricity and magnetism
a branch of mathematical physics, as did Gauss, Cauchy, and Green.
Poisson was also a worthy successor to Laplace in studies on celestial
mechanics and the attraction of spheroids. The Poisson integral in
potential theory, the Poisson brackets in differential equations, the
Poisson ratio in elasticity, and Poisson’s constant in electricity
indicate the importance of his contributions to various fields of
applied mathematics. Two of his best-known treatises were the Traite de
m´ ecanique´ (2 vols., 1811, 1833) and Recherches sur la probabilite des
jugements´ (1837). In the latter appears the familiar Poisson
distribution, or Poisson’s law of large numbers. In the binomial
distribution (p1q)n, (where p1q51 and n is the number of trials), as n
increases indefinitely, the binomial distribution ordinarily tends
toward a normal distribution, but if, as n increases indefinitely, p
approaches zero, the product np remaining constant, the limiting case of
the binomial distribution is the Poisson distribution.</p>
<p>His analytic skill in refining the mathematical physics of Lagrange
and Laplace gained him early fame. His critical analyses of the work of
others often led him to innovative new concepts; an example is his
memoir on potential theory following his study of the work of James
Ivory (1765 1842). Poisson’s important memoir, in turn, was studied by
George Green (1793 1841) and was a significant ingredient in Green’s
1828 memoir on the subject. Yet Poisson’s clinging to superseded
physical concepts and his claims to a rigor that applied to his
selfassurance more than to his mathematics kept him from assuming the
mantle of mathematical leadership in later years. When men such as
Jacobi and Dirichlet chose the problems of Poisson for special treatment
in their lectures and memoirs, it was to recast them in a new mold.</p>
<p>Reforms in England and Prussia</p>
<p>Reform characterized much of the activity affecting mathematicians in
England, as well as in Prussia. The turning point in British mathematics
came in 1813 with the formation at Trinity College, Cambridge, of the
Analytical Society, which was led by three young Cantabrigians: the
algebraist George Peacock (1791 1858), the astronomer John Herschel
(1792 1871), and Charles Babbage (1791/2 1871) of “Calculating Engines”
fame. The immediate purpose of the society was to reform the teaching
and the notation of the calculus, and in 1817, when Peacock was
appointed an examiner for the mathematical tripos, differential notation
replaced fluxional symbols on the Cambridge examination. Peacock was
himself a Cambridge graduate and teacher, the first of many Trinity
College men who were to lead in the development of algebra. He graduated
as second wrangler—that is, he took second place in the celebrated
tripos examination (initiated in 1725) for undergraduates who had
specialized in mathematics—the first wrangler being John Herschel,
another of the founders of the Analytical Society. Peacock was a zealous
administrator and reformer, taking an active part in modifying the
university statutes and in establishing the Astronomical Society of
London, the Philosophical Society of Cambridge, and the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, the latter of which set the
pattern for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The
last twenty years of his life were spent as dean of Ely cathedral.</p>
<p>Peacock did not produce any outstanding new results in mathematics,
but he was of great importance in reforming the subject in Britain,
especially with respect to algebra. At Cambridge, there had been a
tendency in algebra as conservative as that in geometry and analysis.
Whereas on the Continent, mathematicians were developing the graphical
representation of complex numbers, in England there were protests that
not even negative numbers had validity.</p>
<p>In the words of Charles Babbage, the aim of the Analytical Society
was to promote “the principles of pure d-ism as opposed to the dot-age
of the university.” (A second aim of the Society was “to leave the world
wiser than they found it.”) This was, of course, a reference to the
continued refusal of the English to abandon the dotted fluxions of
Newton for the differentials of Leibniz; more generally, it also implied
a desire to take advantage of the great strides in mathematics that had
been made on the Continent. In 1816, as a result of the society’s
inspiration, an English translation of Lacroix’s one-volume Calculus was
published, and within a few years, British mathematicians were in a
position to vie with their contemporaries on the Continent. For example,
George Green, a selfeducated miller’s son, who, as we noted, studied
Poisson’s memoir on potential theory, in 1828 published for private
circulation the essay on electricity and magnetism that contained the
important theorem bearing his name: If P(x, y) and Q(x, y) have
continuous partial derivatives over a region R of the xy-plane bounded
by a curve C, then C Pdx1 Qdy5ÐÐRðQx 2PyÞdxdy: This theorem, or its
analogue in threeÐ dimensions, is also known as Gauss’s theorem, for
Green’s results were largely overlooked until rediscovered by Lord
Kelvin in 1846. The theorem, meanwhile, had also been discovered by
Mikhail Ostrogradski and in Russia, it bears his name to this day.</p>
<p>In Prussia, a large share of the credit for the rejuvenation of
mathematics goes to the brothers Humboldt. Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767
1835), a philologist, is best known for his reform of the Prussian
educational system. Alexander von Humboldt (1769 1859), a liberal
courtier, a natural historian, and a friend of mathematical scientists,
used his considerable influence in Berlin to assure Dirichlet’s return
to Prussia from Paris; he also aided the careers of C. G. J. Jacobi and
G. Eisenstein, among others, and showed interest in Abel.</p>
<p>Di f fus ion</p>
<p>As a result, by midcentury a substantial number of mathematicians
were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and England. Each
country had established a major mathematical journal in the second
quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the Journal de
Mathematiques Pures et Appliqu´ ees´ . The Cambridge Mathematical
Journal followed. Crelle’s Journal continued to thrive, with much active
support from Dirichlet and his students.</p>

<h4 id="nineteenth-century-overview">Nineteenth-Century Overview</h4>
<p>The nineteenth century deserves to be known as the Golden Age in
mathematics. The additions to the subject during these one hundred years
far outweigh the total combined productivity of all preceding ages. The
century was also one of the most revolutionary in the history of
mathematics. The introduction into the mathematician’s repertoire of
concepts such as non-Euclidean geometries, n-dimensional spaces,
noncommutative algebras, infinite processes, and nonquantitative
structures all contributed to a radical transformation that changed the
appearance, as well as the definitions, of mathematics.</p>
<p>The geographic distribution of mathematical activity also began to
change. Hitherto, each major period of history seemed to be
characterized by specific geographic clusters where most advances in
mathematics took place. During the first half of the nineteenth century,
the</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>Gaus s: E ar l y Wor k</p>
<p>center of mathematical activity became diffused. Nevertheless,
several decades passed before there were institutions that could boast
the mathematical strength of the French, epitomized by the E´cole
Polytechnique. Most countries supported mathematical efforts directed
toward surveying, navigation, or other areas of application. Support for
research in pure mathematics—in time or money—was the exception, rather
than the rule. This is illustrated in the career of the greatest
mathematician of the time, who was German.</p>
<p>Gauss: EarlyWork</p>
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 1855) enjoyed numerical computation as a
child; an anecdote that is told of his early schooling is
characteristic. One day, in order to keep the class occupied, the
teacher had the students add up all of the numbers from 1 to 100, with
instructions that each child should place his slate on a table as soon
as he had completed the task. Almost immediately, Carl placed his slate
on the table, saying, “There it is.” When the instructor finally looked
at the results, Gauss’s slate was the only one to have the correct
answer, 5050, with no further calculation. Evidently, the ten-year-old
boy had mentally computed the sum of the arithmetic progression
1121311991100, presumably through the formula m(m11)/2. His teachers
soon called Gauss’s talent to the attention of the Duke of Brunswick,
who supported his education, which first enabled him to study at the
local college, then at the University in Go¨ttingen, where he
matriculated in October 1795.</p>
<p>The following March, still a month short of being nineteen years old,
Gauss made a brilliant discovery. For more than 2,000 years, men had
known how to construct, with compasses and straightedge, the equilateral
triangle and the regular pentagon (as well as certain other regular
polygons, the numbers of whose sides are multiples of two, three, and
five), but no other polygon with a prime number of sides. Gauss showed
that the regular polygon of seventeen sides could also be constructed
with compasses and straightedge.</p>
<p>Gauss commemorated his discovery by starting a diary in which, for
the next eighteen years, he noted many of his discoveries. He obtained
numerous results while still a student. Some were rediscoveries of
theorems established by Euler, Lagrange, and other eighteenth-century
mathematicians; many were new. Among the more significant discoveries of
his student days, we may single out the method of least squares, the
proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity in number theory, and his work
on the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</p>
<p>He earned his doctorate with a thesis titled “New Demonstration of
the Theorem That Every Rational Integral Algebraic Function in One</p>
<p>Facsimile of a page in the famous diary of Gauss</p>
<p>Variable Can Be Resolved into Real Factors of First or Second
Degree.” In this, the first of four proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra that he published during his life, Gauss stressed the importance
of demonstrating the existence of at least one root in proving the
theorem in question.</p>
<p>Gauss presented this doctoral thesis to the University of Helmstedt,
which had on its faculty Johann Friedrich Pfaff (1765 1825), who, next
to Gauss, was widely regarded as the ranking German mathematician of his
time. Today he is best known for an 1813 memoir on the integration of
systems of differential equations. On leaving Go¨ttingen in 1798, he
returned to his native Brunswick, where he spent the next nine years
enjoying the continued support of the duke, waited for a suitable job,
got married, and made some of his major discoveries.</p>
<h4 id="number-theory">Number Theory</h4>
<p>While still a student in Go¨ttingen, Gauss had begun work on a major
publication in number theory. Appearing two years after his doctoral
dissertation, the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is one of the great
classics of mathematical literature. It consists of seven sections.
Culminating in two</p>
<p>Numb er T he or y</p>
<p>proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, the first four sections
are essentially a tightened recasting of eighteenth-century number
theory. Fundamental in the discussion are the concepts of congruence and
residue class. Section 5 is devoted to the theory of binary quadratic
forms, specifically the question of solutions for equations of the form
ax2 1 2bxy1cy2 5m; the techniques developed in this section became the
basis for much work done by later generations of number theorists.
Section 6 consists of various applications. The last section, which
initially drew the most attention, deals with the solution of the
general cyclotomic equation of prime degree.</p>
<p>Gauss called the law of quadratic reciprocity, which Legendre had
published a couple of years earlier, the theorema aureum, or the gem of
arithmetic. In his later work, Gauss sought to find comparable theorems
for congruences xn p(mod q) for n53 and 4, but for these cases, he found
it necessary to extend the meaning of the word “integer” to include the
so-called Gaussian integers, that is, numbers of the form a1bi, where a
and b are integers. The Gaussian integers form an integral domain like
that of the real integers but more general. Problems in divisibility
become more complicated, for 5 no longer is a prime, being factorable
into the product of the two “primes” 112i and 122i. In fact, no real
prime of the form 4n11 is a “Gaussian prime,” whereas real primes of the
form 4n21 remain primes in the generalized sense. In the Disquisitiones,
Gauss included the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, one of the basic
principles that continues to hold in the integral domain of Gaussian
integers. In fact, any integral domain for which factoring is unique is
known today as a Gaussian integral domain. One of the contributions of
the Disquisitiones was a rigorous proof of the theorem, known since the
days of Euclid, that any positive integer can be represented in one and
only one way (except for the order of the factors) as a product of
primes.</p>
<p>Not all that Gauss discovered about prime numbers is contained in the
Disquisitiones. On the back page of a copy of a table of logarithms that
he had obtained as a boy of fourteen is written cryptically in
German:</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>Primzahlen unter að5NÞ: 1a</p>
<p>This is a statement of the celebrated prime number theorem: the
number of primes less than a given integer a approaches asymptotically
the quotient a/ln a as a increases indefinitely. The odd thing is that
if Gauss wrote this, as we presume he did, he kept this beautiful result
to himself. We do not know whether he had a proof of the theorem or even
when the statement was written.</p>
<p>In 1845, a Parisian professor, Joseph L. F. Bertrand (1822 1900),
guessed that if n.3, there is always at least one prime between n and 2n
(or, more precisely, 2n22) inclusive. This conjecture, known as
Bertrand’s postulate, was proved in 1850 by Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev
(1821 1894) of the University of St. Petersburg. Chebyshev was a rival
of Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevsky as the leading Russian mathematician of
his day and became a foreign associate of the Institut de France and of
the Royal Society of London. Chebyshev, evidently unaware of Gauss’s
work on primes, was able to show that if π(n)(ln n)/n approaches a limit
as n increases indefinitely, this limit must be 1, but he could not
demonstrate the existence of a limit. Not until two years after
Chebyshev’s death was a proof generally known. Then, in 1896, two
mathematicians, working independently, came up with demonstrations in
the same year. One was the Belgian mathematician C. J. de la
Valle´ePoussin (1866 1962), who lived to be almost ninety-six; the other
was a Frenchman, Jacques Hadamard (1865 1963), who was almost
ninetyeight when he died.</p>
<p>Problems on the number and the distribution of primes have fascinated
many mathematicians from Euclid’s day to our own. What may be regarded
as a deep and difficult corollary to Euclid’s theorem on the infinity of
primes was proved by the mathematician who in 1855 was to succeed Gauss
at Go¨ttingen. This was Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805 1859), the
man who did more than anyone else to amplify the Disquisitiones. The
Dirichlet theorem states not only that the number of prime numbers is
infinite, but that if one considers only those integers in an arithmetic
progression a, a1b, a12b,…, a1nb, in which a and b are relatively prime,
then even in this relatively sparser subset of the integers, there still
will be infinitely many primes. The proof Dirichlet gave required
complicated tools from analysis, where Dirichlet’s name is again
preserved in the Dirichlet test for uniform convergence of a series.
Among Dirichlet’s other contributions was the first proof of Bertrand’s
postulate. It should be noted that Dirichlet’s theorem showed that the
discrete domain of the theory of numbers cannot be studied in isolation
from the branch of mathematics dealing with continuous variables—that
is, that number theory requires the aid of analysis. Gauss himself, in
the Disquisitiones, had given a striking example of the fact that the
properties of prime numbers intrude in the most unexpected ways even
into the realm of geometry.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Disquisitiones, Gauss included the first
important discovery he had made in mathematics: the construction of the
regular polygon of seventeen sides. He carried the topic to its logical
conclusion by showing which of the infinitely many possible regular
polygons can be constructed and which cannot. General theorems, such as
that which Gauss now proved, are of ever so much more value than a
single case, no matter how spectacular the single case may be. It will
be recalled that Fermat had believed that numbers of the form 22n11 are
primes, a conjecture that Euler had shown to be incorrect. The number
22211517 is indeed prime, as are also 223115257 and</p>
<p>Re cept ion of t he Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</p>
<p>224 11565;537. Gauss had already shown the polygon of seventeen sides
to be constructible, and the question naturally arises whether a regular
polygon of 257 or 65,537 sides can be constructed with Euclidean tools.
In the Disquisitiones, Gauss answered the question in the affirmative,
showing that a regular polygon of N sides can be constructed with
Euclidean tools if and only if the number N is of the form N52mplp2p3 …
pr, where m is any positive integer and the p’s are distinct Fermat
primes. There remains one aspect of the problem that Gauss did not
answer, and that has not yet been answered. Is the number of Fermat
primes finite or infinite? For n55, 6, 7, 8, and 9, it is known that the
Fermat numbers are not prime, and it appears possible that there are
five and only five constructible regular polygons of a prime number of
sides, two that were known in antiquity and the three that were
discovered by Gauss. A young man whom the aging Gauss admired, Ferdinand
Gotthold Eisenstein (1823 1852), an instructor of mathematics at Berlin,
added a new conjecture about prime numbers when he hazarded the thought,
unverified up to the present time, that numbers of</p>
<p>2 the form 22 11; 222 11; 222 11, and so on, are primes. To Gauss is
attributed the remark that “There have been only three epoch-making
mathematicians, Archimedes, Newton, and Eisenstein.” Whether, given a
normal span of years, Eisenstein might have fulfilled such a glowing
prediction is a matter of conjecture, for the young privatdozent died
when he was not yet thirty years old.</p>
<p>Reception of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</p>
<p>Many mathematicians introducing new methods or concepts have found
that these are viewed with skepticism until it becomes clear not only
that they are useful in obtaining new results but that they so far
exceed existing techniques as to make it worthwhile for a mature
researcher to learn them. Gauss, too, found this to be true in the case
of his great book on number theory. It created little initial attention;
only the algebraic contribution of the last section was noted with
approbation by French authors of the time. One of the very few
individuals who initiated a correspondence with Gauss for the purpose of
exchanging ideas about the number-theoretic aspects of the book was a
certain “Monsieur Leblanc”; this turned out to be Sophie Germain, a
mathematician who worked outside the established institutions that were
closed to women. Germain earned the respect and assistance not only of
Gauss but of Lagrange and Legendre; the latter attached her name to a
theorem that marks a major step in the three-century marathon effort to
prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. In another field, the Paris Academy of
Sciences awarded her a prize for a memoir on the mathematical theory of
elastic surfaces.</p>
<p>In general, however—and despite the availability in Paris of a French
translation after 1807—Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae lay dormant
until the late 1820s, when C. G. J. Jacobi (1804 1851) and P. G. Lejeune
Dirichlet first brought to light some of the deeper consequences to be
derived from the work.</p>
<h4 id="astronomy">Astronomy</h4>
<p>It was astronomy, rather than number theory, that gained immediate
fame for the twenty-four-year-old author of the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae. On January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi (1746 1826), the
director of the Palermo observatory, had discovered the new minor planet
(asteroid) Ceres, but a few weeks afterward, the tiny body was lost to
sight. Having most unusual computational ability, as well as the added
advantage of the method of least squares, Gauss took up the challenge to
compute, from the few recorded observations of the planet, the orbit in
which it moved. For the task of computing orbits from a limited number
of observations, he devised a scheme, known as Gauss’s method, that is
still used to track satellites. The result was a resounding success, the
planet being rediscovered at the end of the year in very nearly the
position indicated by his calculations. Gauss’s orbit computations
captured the attention of astronomers internationally and soon brought
him to prominence among German mathematical scientists, most of whom
were engaged in astronomical and geodesic activities at the time. In
1807, he was appointed director of the Go¨ttingen observatory, a post he
held for nearly half a century. Two years later, his classic treatise on
theoretical astronomy, the Theoria Motus, appeared. It provided a clear
guide for carrying out orbital computations and by the time of his death
had been translated into English, French, and German.</p>
<p>Orbital computations were not the only area of astronomical research
in which Gauss distinguished himself and paved a path for succeeding
generations, however. Much of his time during the first decade of the
nineteenth century was spent in working on the problem of perturbations.
This had moved to the foreground of astronomers’ interests after the
discovery in 1802 of the minor planet Pallas by Gauss’s good friend, the
physician and amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758 1840).
Pallas has a relatively large eccentricity and is particularly affected
by the gravitational attraction of other planets such as Jupiter and
Saturn. Determining the effect of these attractions is a specific
example of the n-body problem that Euler and Lagrange had previously
attacked for n52 or 3. Gauss’s work on this problem resulted not only in
astronomical memoirs but in two classical mathematical papers: one dealt
with infinite series, the other with a new method for numerical
analysis.</p>
<p>Gaus s’s Middle Ye ar s</p>
<p>Gauss’s MiddleYears</p>
<p>The decade in which Gauss arrived at the preceding results had been
filled with new discoveries, as well as emotionally draining events. He
had experienced early recognition and honors, happiness in marriage, and
fatherhood. But then came financial concerns resulting from levies
imposed by the occupying administration in Go¨ttingen; the deaths of his
patron, the Duke of Brunswick, and of his wife and third child;
annoyance at the lack of appreciation of his work among scientists such
as the French astronomer J. B. J. Delambre; concern over raising his
children; and rapid entry into a second marriage. The previously
cheerful young genius became an austere figure whose strict sense of
duty often led him to seemingly rigid decisions in the nonscientific
realm. This image was intensified after the 1820s by the lingering
illness of his second wife, who died in 1831, and an estrangement from
one of his sons that lasted for more than a decade.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gauss’s position as director of the Go¨ttingen
observatory presented new challenges. Between 1810 and 1820, much of his
energy was absorbed by the building and outfitting of a new observatory.
He made the acquaintance of major instrument makers of the period and
involved himself with the details of instrument construction. Studies of
instruments and observations led him to significant results in error
theory. After 1815, his increasing comprehension of the nature of
instrumental, observational, and technical errors was reinforced by his
immersion in surveying and geodesy. The result was a set of reports on
error theory. During the 1820s, he was charged with the survey of the
Kingdom of Hannover, which meant that he spent numerous summers in the
field, personally conducting measurements, often under primitive and
hazardous conditions. The most significant publication that resulted
from the geometric considerations of the decade appeared in 1827, and it
opened a new direction in geometric and, ultimately, in physical
research.</p>
<p>Gauss was not especially fond of geometry, yet he thought about the
subject sufficiently to do two things: (1) to arrive, by 1824, at an
important unpublished conclusion on the parallel postulate; and (2) to
publish, in 1827, a classic treatise that generally is regarded as the
cornerstone of a new branch of geometry. Gauss, while still a student at
Go¨ttingen, had tried to prove the parallel postulate, as had his
intimate friend Wolfgang (or Farkas) Bolyai (1775 1856) as well. Both
men continued to look for a proof, the latter giving up in despair, the
former eventually coming to the conviction that not only was no proof
possible, but that a geometry quite different from that of Euclid might
be developed. Had Gauss expanded and published his thoughts on the
parallel postulate, he would have been hailed as the inventor of
non-Euclidean geometry, but his silence on the subject resulted in
credit going to others, as we shall see further on.</p>
<h4 id="differential-geometry">Differential Geometry</h4>
<p>The new branch of geometry that Gauss initiated in 1827 is known as
differential geometry, and it belongs perhaps more to analysis than to
the traditional field of geometry. Ever since the days of Newton and
Leibniz, men had applied the calculus to the study of curves in two
dimensions; in a sense, this work constituted a prototype of
differential geometry. Euler and Monge had extended this to include an
analytic study of surfaces; hence, they are sometimes regarded as the
fathers of differential geometry. Nevertheless, not until the appearance
of Gauss’s classical treatise Disquisitiones Circa Superficies Curvas
was there a comprehensive volume devoted entirely to the subject.
Roughly speaking, ordinary geometry is interested in the totality of a
given diagram or figure, whereas differential geometry concentrates on
the properties of a curve or a surface in the immediate neighborhood of
a point on the curve or the surface. In this connection, Gauss extended
the work of Huygens and Clairaut on the curvature of a plane or a gauche
curve at a point by defining the curvature of a surface at a point—the
“Gaussian curvature” or “the total curvature.” If at a point P on a
well-behaved surface S one erects a line N normal to S, the pencil of
planes through N will cut the surface S in a family of plane curves,
each of which will have a radius of curvature. The directions of the
curves with the largest and smallest radii of curvature, R and r, are
called the principal directions on S at P, and they always happen to be
perpendicular to each other. The quantities R and r are known as the
principal radii of curvature of S at P, and the Gaussian curvature of S
at P is defined as K51/rR. (The quantity Km 512ð1=r 11=RÞ, known as the
mean curvature of S at P, also turns out to be useful.) Gauss gave
formulas for K in terms of the partial derivatives of the surface with
respect to various coordinate systems, curvilinear as well as Cartesian;
he also discovered what even he regarded as “remarkable theorems” about
properties of families of curves, such as geodesics, drawn on the
surface.</p>
<p>Gauss began the treatment of curved surfaces by using the parametric
equation of a surface introduced by Euler. That means if a point (x, y,
z) of a surface can be represented by the parameters u and v so that
x5x(u, v), y5y(u, v), and z5z(u, v), then dx5adu1au dv, dy5bdu1bu dv,
dz5cdu1cu dv, where a5xu, au 5xv, b5yu, bu 5yv, c5zu, and cu 5zv.
Considering the arc length ds2 5dx2 1dy2 1dz2, expressing this in the
parametric coordinates gives ds2 5(adu1au dv)2 1(bdu1bu dv)2 1 (cdu1cu
dv)2 5Edu2 12Fdudv1Gdv2, where E5a2 1b2 1c2, F5 aau 1bbu 1ccu, and G5au2
1bu2 1cu2. Gauss proceeded to show that the properties of a surface
depend only on E, F, and G. This leads to many consequences. In
particular, it becomes easy to say what properties of the surface remain
invariant. It was in building on this work of Gauss that Bernhard
Riemann and later geometers transformed the subject of differential
geometry.</p>

<h4 id="gausss-later-work">Gauss’s Later Work</h4>
<p>By the time the work on curved surfaces had appeared, the
mathematical climate in Germany was beginning to change. One of the most
significant aspects of this change was the founding of a new journal in
1809. This was the Annales de Mathe´matiques Pures et Applique´es,
edited by Joseph-Diaz Gergonne (1771 1859). In Germany, a periodical
similar to Gergonne’s Annales, and even more successful, was begun in
1826 by August Leopold Crelle (1780 1855) under the title Journal fu¨r
die reine und angewandte Mathematik. So heavily weighted were the
articles in the direction of pure (reine) mathematics (notably those by
Abel, six of which appeared in the very first volume) that wags
suggested the title might be more appropriate if the two German words
und angewandte (“and applied”) were replaced by the single word
unangewandte (“unapplied”). Gauss contributed two short articles to this
new venture: one was a proof of “Harriot’s theorem in algebra,” the
other contained the statement of Gauss’s principle of least constraint.
He continued to submit his major memoirs to the Go¨ttingen Gesellschaft
der Wissenschaften, however. An important memoir on capillarity was
published by the Go¨ttingen Society, as were his two influential memoirs
on number theory. Historians often cite the first of these, published in
1832, because it contains Gauss’s geometric representation of complex
numbers. The importance of the memoir as a whole lies in the fact that
it pointed the way to extending the theory of numbers from the reals to
the complex field and beyond. As noted previously, this was crucial in
the work of later mathematicians.</p>
<p>At the more elementary level, it is interesting to observe that the
graphical representation of complex numbers had already been discovered
in 1797 by Caspar Wessel (1745 1818) and published in the transactions
of the Danish academy for 1798, but Wessel’s work went virtually
unnoticed; hence, today the plane of complex numbers is usually referred
to as the Gaussian plane, even though Gauss did not publish his views
until some thirty years after Wessel did. No one before Wessel and Gauss
took the obvious step of thinking of the real and imaginary parts of a
complex number a1bi as rectangular coordinates of points in a plane.
Imaginary numbers, for these could now be visualized in the sense that
every point in the plane corresponds to a complex number, and the old
ideas about the nonexistence of imaginary numbers were generally
abandoned.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years of his life, Gauss published only two
major papers of mathematical interest. One was his fourth proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra, which he released at the time of his
doctoral jubilee in 1849, fifty years after the publication of his first
proof. The other was an influential memoir on potential theory, which
appeared in 1840, in one of the volumes of geomagnetic results that he
coedited with his younger friend, the physicist Wilhelm Weber (1804
1891). Geomagnetic issues occupied much of his time in the 1830s and
early forties; he also devoted effort in the late thirties to issues
pertaining to weights and measures. Most of his publications in the last
decade of his life reflect work at the astronomical observatory; they
deal with the newer minor planets, with observations of the recently
discovered planet Neptune, and with other data of interest to
astronomers of the day, who read of them in the Astronomische
Nachrichten.</p>
<p>Gauss’s mathematics provided the starting point for some of the main
research areas of modern mathematics. Except for his personal fame and
the fortune he amassed by making shrewd investments, his external
circumstances were similar to those of many earlier mathematicians,
however. His main obligations lay in running an observatory and
performing various duties for his government. He had teaching
responsibilities, but because most of his students were ill-prepared, he
avoided classroom teaching as much as possible, feeling that the returns
were not worth the investment in time. His best students tended to
become astronomers, rather than mathematicians, although some, such as
August Ferdinand Mo¨bius, made a name for themselves in mathematics.
Most of his research results, aside from those published as books,
appeared in the publications of the Go¨ttingen Society of Science or in
journals devoted to astronomy and geodesy—initially, in Franz Xaver von
Zach’s Monatliche Korrespondenz zur Befo¨rderung der Erd-und
Himmelskunde; after 1820, in the Astronomische Nachrichten. His
mathematical communications were restricted to correspondence with a few
friends and occasional visits of younger colleagues from abroad.</p>
<h4 id="gausss-influence">Gauss’s Influence</h4>
<p>Despite the relatively small number of well-known mathematicians who
could claim to be Gauss’s students in the formal sense, it is hard to
overestimate the influence Gauss had on successive generations. Those
who studied his publications, the few who came to see him, the ones who
followed the new avenues of research he had opened include some of the
best-known mathematicians of the nineteenth century. When it came to his
expressed opinion of the work of others, his impact was not always
salutary, however. Toward the end of his life, Gauss may have become
uncharacteristically generous in his comments; we note the well-deserved
appreciation of Riemann’s habilitation and the questionable enthusiasm
concerning Eisenstein.</p>
<p>We now turn to the work of some who benefited directly from study of
his publications, especially the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, and from
indirect encouragement through the example he set. In several cases,
their</p>
<p>studies of Gauss’s work supplemented their exposure to the
investigations of Legendre.</p>
<p>Abel</p>
<p>Niels Henrik Abel’s short life (1802 1829) was filled with poverty
and tragedy. He was born into a large family, the son of the pastor of
the little village of Findo in Norway. When he was sixteen, his teacher
urged him to read the great books in mathematics, including the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss. In his reading, Abel noted that
Euler had proved the binomial theorem only for rational powers, so he
filled the gap by giving a proof valid for the general case. When Abel
was eighteen, his father died, and much of the care of the family fell
on his young and weak shoulders, yet within the next year, he made a
remarkable mathematical discovery. Ever since the cubic and quartic
equations had been solved in the sixteenth century, men had studied the
quintic. Abel at first thought he had hit on a solution, but in 1824, he
published a memoir, “On the Algebraic Resolution of Equations,” in which
he reached the opposite conclusion. He gave the first proof that no
solution is possible, thus putting an end to the long search. There can
be no general formula, expressed in explicit algebraic operations on the
coefficients of a polynomial equation, for the roots of the equation if
the degree of the equation is greater than 4. An earlier proof, less
satisfactory and generally overlooked, of the insolvability of the
quintic had been published in 1799 by Paolo Ruffini (1765 1822), and
hence the result is now referred to as the Abel-Ruffini theorem.</p>
<p>When Abel visited Paris in 1826, he hoped his research results would
gain him recognition by members of the Academy. He found the city
inhospitable, however, and wrote home to a friend, “Every beginner has a
great deal of difficulty in getting noticed here. I have just finished
an extensive treatise on a certain class of transcendental functions but
Mr. Cauchy scarcely deigns to glance at it.” The publication in question
contained what he considered the jewel in his bag of mathematical
treasures, “Abel’s addition theorem,” a grand generalization of Euler’s
addition theorems on elliptic integrals. Before arriving in Paris, Abel
had spent some time in Berlin and had been well received by Crelle, who
was about to inaugurate his new Journal. He invited Abel to contribute
to the publication. Abel complied; the first volume contained six
articles by him, which were followed by more for succeeding volumes.
They included the expanded version of his proof of the insolvability of
the quintic, as well as his further contributions to the theory of
elliptic and hyperelliptic functions. While these were appearing in
Berlin, Abel had returned to his native Norway; increasingly weakened by
tuberculosis, he kept sending more material to Crelle. He died in 1829,
scarcely aware of the interest his publications were creating. Two days
after his death, a letter arrived offering him a position in Berlin.</p>
<p>Jacobi</p>
<p>What created something of a sensation and helped increase the
readership of Crelle’s new journal was the fact that Abel was not alone
in his new discoveries. The Prussian mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob
Jacobi (1804 1851) was obtaining many of the same results independently;
moreover, he, too, was publishing them in the early volumes of Crelle’s
journal. It became apparent to men such as Legendre that both Abel and
Jacobi were forging new tools of great consequence. What was not
generally known was that the unpublished memoranda of Gauss hung like a
sword of Damocles over mathematics of the first half of the nineteenth
century. When an important new development was announced by others, it
frequently turned out that Gauss had had the idea earlier but had
permitted it to go unpublished. Among the striking instances of this
situation was the disclosure of elliptic functions, a discovery in which
four outstanding figures are involved. One of these was, of course,
Legendre, who had spent some forty years studying elliptic integrals
almost single-handedly. He had developed a great many formulas, some of
them resembling relationships among inverse trigonometric functions (a
number of which had been known much earlier to Euler). This was not
surprising, inasmuch as the elliptic integral</p>
<p>dx</p>
<p>pð12K2x2Þð12x2Þ</p>
<p>includes</p>
<p>dx</p>
<p>pð12x2Þ</p>
<p>as the special case for which K50. Yet it remained for Gauss and his
two younger contemporaries to take full advantage of a point of view
that greatly facilitates the study of elliptic integrals. If</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5p 2 ;</p>
<p>0 12x</p>
<p>then u5arcsin v. Here u is expressed as a function of the independent
variable v (x being only the dummy variable for integrating), but it
turns out to be more felicitous to reverse the roles of u and v by
choosing u as the independent variable. In this case, we have v5f(u),
or, in the language of trigonometry, v5sinu. The function v5sinu is more
expeditiously manipulated, and it has a striking property that u5arcsin
v does not have: it is periodic. The private papers of Gauss show that
perhaps as early as 1800, he had discovered the double periodicity of
elliptic (or lemniscatic) functions. It was not until 1827 1828,
however, that this remarkable property was disclosed by Abel.</p>
<p>In 1829, Jacobi wrote to Legendre to inquire about the memoir Abel
had left with Cauchy, for Jacobi had intimations that it touched on his
outstanding discovery. On looking into the matter, Cauchy in 1830 dug up
the manuscript, which Legendre later described as “a monument more
lasting than bronze,” and it was published in 1841 by the French
Institut among the memoirs presented by foreigners. It contained an
important generalization of Legendre’s work on elliptic integrals.
If</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5;</p>
<p>0pð12K2x2Þð12x2Þ</p>
<p>u is a function of v, u5f(v), the properties of which had been very
extensively described by Legendre in his treatise on elliptic integrals.
What Legendre had missed and what Gauss, Abel, and Jacobi saw was that
by inverting the functional relationship between u and v, one obtains a
more useful and more beautiful function, v5f(u). This function, usually
written v5sn u and read as “v is the sine amplitude of u,” together with
others defined in a somewhat similar manner, are known as elliptic
functions. (Some historical confusion has arisen because Legendre used
the phrase “fonctions elliptiques” to refer to elliptic integrals and
not to what are now known as elliptic functions.)</p>
<p>The most striking property of these new higher transcendental
functions was, as their three independent discoverers saw, that in the
theory of complex variables they have a double periodicity, that is,
there are two complex numbers m and n, such that
v5f(u)5f(u1m)5f(u1n).</p>
<p>Whereas the trigonometric functions have only a real period (a period
of</p>
<p>2π) and the function ex has only an imaginary period (2πi), the
elliptic functions have two distinct periods. So impressed was Jacobi
with the simplicity achieved through a simple inversion of the
functional relationship in elliptic integrals that he regarded the
advice “You must always invert” as the secret of success in
mathematics.</p>
<p>Jacobi also deserves credit for several critical theorems related to
elliptic functions. In 1834, he proved that if a single-valued function
of one variable is doubly periodic, the ratio of the periods cannot be
real, and that it is impossible for a single-valued function of a single
independent variable to have more than two distinct periods. To him, we
also owe a study of the “Jacobi theta functions,” a class of quasi
doubly periodic entire functions of which the elliptic functions are
quotients.</p>
<p>The fateful misplaced memoir by Abel contained the hint of something
even more general than the elliptical functions. If one replaces the
elliptic integral with</p>
<p>ð</p>
<p>v dx</p>
<p>u5;</p>
<p>0pPðxÞ</p>
<p>where P(x) is a polynomial the degree of which may exceed four, and
if one again inverts the relationship between u and v, to obtain v5f(u),
this function is a special case of what is known as an Abelian function.
It was Jacobi, however, who in 1832 first demonstrated that the
inversion can be carried out not only for a single variable but for
functions of several variables.</p>
<p>The most celebrated results of his research were those in elliptic
functions, published in 1829, which brought him the praise of Legendre.
By means of this new analysis, Jacobi later proved again the four-square
theorem of Fermat and Lagrange. In 1829, Jacobi also published a paper
in which he made extensive and general use of Jacobians, expressing
these in a more modern form than had Cauchy:</p>

<p>Jacobi became so enamored of functional determinants that he insisted
on thinking of ordinary numerical determinants as Jacobians of n linear
functions in n unknowns.</p>
<p>Jacobi’suseoffunctionaldeterminantsinapaperonalgebrain1829was only
incidental, as had been that of Cauchy. Had this been the only
contribution from the pen of Jacobi, his name would not have been
attached to the particular determinant that we are considering. In 1841,
however, he published a long memoir, “De Determinantibus
Functionalibus,” specifically devoted to the Jacobian. He pointed out,
among other things,that this functional determinant is in many ways an
analogue, for functions of several variables, to the differential
quotient of a function of a single variable, and, of course, he called
attention to its role in determining whether a set of equations or
functions is independent. He showed that if a set of n functions in n
variables are functionally related, the Jacobian must vanish
identically; if the functions are mutually independent, the Jacobian
cannot be identically zero.</p>
<p>Galois</p>
<p>Young geniuses whose lives were cut short by death from dueling or
consumption are part of the real and fictional literary tradition of the
Romantic Age. Someone wishing to present a mathematical caricature of
such lives could do no better than to create the characters of Abel and
Galois. E´variste Galois (1812 1832) was born just outside Paris in the
village of Bourg-la-Reine, where his father served as mayor. His
welleducated parents had not shown any particular aptitude for
mathematics, but the young Galois did acquire from them an implacable
hatred of tyranny. When he first entered school at the age of twelve, he
showed little interest in Latin, Greek, or algebra, but he was
fascinated by Legendre’s Geometry. Later, he read with understanding the
algebra and the analysis in the works of masters such as Lagrange and
Abel, but his routine class work in mathematics remained mediocre, and
his teachers regarded him as eccentric. By the age of sixteen, Galois
knew what his teachers had failed to recognize—that he was a
mathematical genius. He hoped, therefore, to enter the school that had
nurtured so many celebrated mathematicians, the E´cole Polytechnique,
but his lack of systematic preparation resulted in his rejection.</p>
<p>This disappointment was followed by others. A paper Galois wrote and
presented to the Academy when he was seventeen was held up by Cauchy; he
failed in a second attempt to enter the E´cole Polytechnique; worst of
all, his father, feeling persecuted because of clerical intrigues,
committed suicide. Galois entered the E´cole Normale to prepare for
teaching; he also continued his research. In 1830, he submitted another
paper to the Academy in a prize competition. Fourier, as secretary of
the Academy, received the paper but died shortly thereafter, and this
memoir was lost. Faced on all sides by tyranny and frustration, Galois
made the cause of the 1830 revolution his own. A blistering letter
criticizing the indecision of the director of the E´cole Normale
resulted in Galois’s expulsion. A third effort to present a paper to the
Academy resulted in its being returned by Poisson with a request for
proofs. Thoroughly disillusioned, Galois joined the National Guard. In
1831, he was twice arrested; he had proposed a toast in a gathering of
republicans that was interpreted as a threat on the life of King Louis
Philippe. Shortly afterward, he became involved with a coquette and was
challenged to a duel. The night before the duel, with forebodings of
death, Galois spent the hours jotting down, in a letter to a friend
named Chevalier, notes for posterity concerning his discoveries. He
asked that the letter be published (as it was within the year) in the
Revue Encydope´dique and expressed the hope that Jacobi and Gauss might
publicly give their opinion as to the importance of the theorems. On the
morning of May 30, 1832, Galois met his adversary in a duel with
pistols, which resulted in his death the following day. He was twenty
years old.</p>
<p>In 1846, Joseph Liouville edited several memoirs and manuscript
fragments of Galois and published these, along with the last letter to
Chevalier in his Journal de Mathe´matiques. This marks the beginning of
the effective dissemination of Galois’s ideas, although some clues to
Galois’s work had been published earlier. Two papers by Galois had
appeared in Ferussac’s Bulletin Sciences Mathe´matiques of 1830. In the
first, Galois had listed three criteria for the solvability of a
“primitive” equation; the chief of these was the beautiful proposition
that</p>
<p>In order that an irreducible equation of prime degree be solvable by
radicals, it is necessary and sufficient that all its roots be rational
functions of any two of them.</p>
<p>Aside from referring to Gauss’s cyclotomic equation and noting that
his results had been derived from the theory of permutations, this paper
contained no indication of the method used to derive results and no
proofs. In the other paper, on number theory, Galois showed how to
construct finite fields of order p given the root of an irreducible
congruence of degree n mod p. Here, too, he stressed the analogy to
Gauss’s results in Section III of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. His
letter to Chevalier, published in September 1832, had contained an
outline of the main results of the memoir that had been returned by the
Academy. There, Galois had indicated what he considered to be the
essential part of his theory. In particular, he stressed the difference
between adjoining one or all of the roots of the resolvent and related
it to the decomposition of the group G of the equation. In modern
terminology, he indicated that an extension of the given field is normal
if and only if the corresponding subgroup is a normal subgroup of G. He
observed that an equation whose group cannot be properly decomposed (one
whose group does not have a normal subgroup) should be transformed into
one that can. Then, he noted the equivalent of saying that an equation
is solvable if and only if one obtains a chain of normal subgroups of
prime index. Unaccompanied by proofs, definitions, or adequate
explanations of the new concepts involved, the profound content of the
letter was not understood until Liouville published the full memoir,
along with these previously published papers.</p>
<p>The main goal of the memoir is the proof of the theorem quoted
previously. The memoir contains the important notion of
“adjunction”:</p>
<p>We shall call every quantity rational which is expressed as a
rational function of the coefficients of the equation and of a certain
number of quantities adjoined to the equation and selected
arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Galois noted that Gauss’s cyclotomic equation of prime degree n is
irreducible until a root of one of the auxiliary equations is
adjoined.</p>
<p>Gauss, in his criteria for the constructibility of regular polygons,
had in essence solved the question of the solvability of the equation
a0Xn 1an 50 in terms of rational operations and square roots on the
coefficients. Galois generalized the result to provide criteria for the
solvability of a0Xn 1a1Xn1 1 1an 1X 1an 50 in terms of rational
operations and nth roots on the coefficients. His approach to the
problem, now known as Galois theory, was another of the highly original
contributions to algebra in the nineteenth century. Yet it has been said
that Galois theory is like garlic, in that there is no such thing as a
little of it. One must make a substantial study of it to appreciate the
reasoning—as Galois’s experience with his contemporaries showed.
Nevertheless, we can indicate in a general way what is behind Galois
theory and why it has been important.</p>
<p>Galois began his investigations with some work of Lagrange on
permutations on the roots of a polynomial equation. Any change in the
ordered arrangement of n objects is called a permutation on these
objects. If, for example, the order of the letters a, b, c is changed to
c, a, b, this permutation is written succinctly as (acb), a notation in
which each letter is taken into the letter immediately following, the
first letter being understood to be the successor of the last letter.
Thus, the letter a was carried into c, c in turn was carried into b, and
b went into a. The notation (ac) or (ac, b), however, means that a goes
into c, c goes into a, and b goes into itself. If two permutations are
performed successively, the resulting permutation is known as the
product of the two permutation transformations. Thus, the product of
(acb) and (ac, b), written as (acb)(ac, b), is the permutation (a, bc).
The identical permutation I takes each letter into itself—that is, it
leaves the order a, b, c unchanged. The set of all permutations on the
letters a, b, c clearly satisfies the definition of a group, given in
chapter 20 on geometry; this group, containing six permutations, is
known as the symmetric group on a, b, c. In the case of n distinct
elements, x1, x2, … , xn, the symmetric group on these contains n!
transformations. If these elements are the roots of an irreducible
equation, the properties of the symmetric group provide necessary and
sufficient conditions that the equation be solvable by radicals.</p>
<p>Inspired by Abel’s proof of the insolvability by radicals of the
quintic equation, Galois discovered that an irreducible algebraic
equation is solvable by radicals if and only if its group—that is, the
symmetric group on its roots—is solvable. The description of a solvable
group is quite complicated, involving as it does relationships between
the group and its subgroups. The three permutations (abc), (abc)2, and
(abc)3 5I form a subgroup of the symmetric group on a, b, and
c. Lagrange had already shown that the order of a subgroup must be a
factor of the order of the group, but Galois went deeper and found
relations between the factorability of the group of an equation and the
solvability of the equation.</p>
<p>Moreover, to him we owe the use in 1830 of the word “group” in its
technical sense in mathematics and the concept of a normal subgroup.</p>
<p>Although his work was done before that of most of the British
algebraists of the great period 1830 1850, Galois’s ideas were without
influence until they were published in 1846. Presence in Paris did not
guarantee success to even the brightest young mathematical minds of the
day. Abel and Galois are the most illustrious examples of men who felt
frustrated by their failure to find the recognition they sought in
Paris.</p>
<p>The situation had changed by the time Liouville published Galois’s
work in his Journal. By midcentury, a substantial number of
mathematicians were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and
England. Each country had established a major mathematical journal in
the second quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the
Journal de Mathe´matiques Pures et Applique´es. The Cambridge
Mathematical Journal followed. Crelle’s journal continued to thrive,
with much active support from Dirichlet and his students.</p>
<p>Gauss and Cauchy died within two years of each other, the former in
1855, the latter in 1857. They had been preceded in death by many of
their contemporaries, including some of their younger followers; they
were followed, in 1859, by Dirichlet and Alexander von Humboldt. In this
respect, the 1850s mark the end of an era. But the decade also brought a
new direction to the continued unfolding of the mathematical legacy of
Gauss and Cauchy: that which emerged from the work of Bernhard Riemann
(1826 1866).</p>

<h4 id="the-school-of-monge">The School of Monge</h4>
<p>Geometry, of all of the branches of mathematics, has been most
subject to changing tastes from age to age. In classical Greece, it had
climbed to the zenith, only to fall to its nadir at about the time that
Rome fell. It recovered some lost ground under Islam and in Renaissance
Europe; in the seventeenth century, it stood on the threshold of a new
era, only to be all but forgotten, at least by research mathematicians,
for nearly two more centuries, languishing in the shade of the
ever-proliferating branches of analysis. Britain, especially during the
later eighteenth century, fought a losing battle to restore Euclid’s
Elements to its once glorious position, but the British had done little
to advance research in the subject. Through the efforts of Monge and
Carnot, there were some stirrings of revival in pure geometry during the
period of the French Revolution, but the almost explosive rediscovery of
geometry as a living branch of mathematics came</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>chiefly with the dawn of the nineteenth century. As one might have
anticipated, Monge’s students at the E´cole Polytechnique made
significant contributions to the new geometric movement. Reflecting the
multiple nature of their teacher’s research, some pursued geometric
applications to engineering, some to pedagogy, some to physics; many
studied the subject for its own sake. Thus, Charles Dupin (1784 1873)
applied his geometric knowledge primarily to problems of naval
architecture and established technical training courses at the
Conservatoire des Arts et Me´tiers. Still, he is best remembered among
geometers for contributions to the theory of surfaces, where he
introduced concepts such as that of the cyclide, the surface enveloped
by all spheres tangent to a given set of spheres. Theodore Olivier (1793
1853) went beyond Monge in creating geometric models to develop powers
of visualization of geometric concepts; this work began the building of
geometric model collections, heavily promoted by the end of the century
through the pedagogic influence of Felix Klein (1849 1925).
Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774 1862), though primarily remembered as a
physicist, in his lectures passed on Monge’s emphasis on geometric
visualization of physical and mathematical problems. Charles Jules
Brianchon (1785 1864) is best known today for one theorem, which he
discovered only a year after his entrance at the E´cole Polytechnique,
where he studied under Monge and read Carnot’s Ge´ome´trie de position.
The twenty-one-year-old student, later an artillery officer and a
teacher, first reestablished the long-forgotten theorem of Pascal, which
Brianchon expressed in the modern form: In any hexagon inscribed in a
conic section, the three points of intersection of the opposite sides
always lie on a straight line. Continuing through some other
demonstrations, he came to the one that bears his name: “In any hexagon
circumscribed about a conic section, the three diagonals cross each
other in the same point.” As Pascal had been impressed by the number of
corollaries that he had been able to derive from his theorem, so
Brianchon remarked that his own theorem “is pregnant with curious
consequences.” The theorems of Pascal and Brianchon are, in fact,
fundamental in the projective study of conics. They form, in addition,
the first clear-cut instance of a pair of significant “dual” theorems in
geometry, that is, theorems that remain valid (in plane geometry) if the
words “point” and “line” are interchanged. If we let the phrase “a line
is tangent to a conic” be read as “a line is on a conic,” the two
theorems can be expressed in the following combined form:</p>
<p>vertices</p>
<p>The sixof a hexagon lie on a conic if</p>

<p>and only if the threecommon to the three pairs of</p>

<p>Projective Geometry: Poncelet and Chasles</p>
<p>Relationships between points and lines on conics were also
efficaciously exploited by another alumnus of the E´cole Polytechnique,
the man who became the effective founder of projective geometry. This
was JeanVictor Poncelet (1788 1867), who also studied under Monge.
Poncelet entered the army corps of engineers just in time to take part
in Napoleon’s ill-fated 1812 campaign in Russia and be taken prisoner.
While in prison, Poncelet composed a treatise on analytic geometry,
Applications d’analyse et de ge´ome´trie, which was based on the
principles he had learned at the E´cole Polytechnique. This work,
however, was not published until about half a century later (2 vols.,
1862 1864), despite the fact that it was originally intended to serve as
an introduction to the author’s far more celebrated Traite´ des
proprie´te´s projectives des figures of 1822. The latter work differed
sharply from the former, in that it was synthetic, rather than analytic,
in style. Poncelet’s tastes had changed on his return to Paris, and from
that time on, he was a staunch advocate of synthetic methods. He
realized that the apparent advantage of analytic geometry lay in its
generality, and he therefore sought to make statements in synthetic
geometry as general as possible. To further this design, he formulated
what he called the “principle of continuity” or “the principle of
permanence of mathematical relations.” This he described as follows:</p>
<p>The metric properties discovered for a primitive figure remain
applicable, without other modifications than those of change of sign, to
all correlative figures which can be considered to spring from the
first.</p>
<p>As an example of the principle, Poncelet cited the theorem of the
equality of the products of the segments of intersecting chords in a
circle, which becomes, when the point of intersection lies outside the
circle, an equality of the products of the segments of secants. If one
of the lines is tangent to the circle, the theorem nevertheless remains
valid on replacing the product of the segments of the secant with the
square of the tangent. Cauchy was inclined to scoff at Poncelet’s
principle of continuity, for it appeared to him to be nothing more than
a bold induction. In a sense, this principle is not unlike the view of
Carnot, but Poncelet carried it further to include the points at
infinity that Kepler and Desargues had suggested. Thus, one could say of
two straight lines that they always intersected— either in an ordinary
point or (in the case of parallel lines) in a point at infinity, called
an ideal point. In order to achieve the generality of analysis, Poncelet
found it necessary to introduce into synthetic geometry not only ideal
points but also imaginary points, for only thus could he say that a
circle and a straight line always intersect. Among his striking
discoveries was that all circles whatsoever, drawn in a plane, have two
points in common. These are two ideal imaginary points, known as the
circular points at infinity and usually designated as I and J (or, more
informally, as Isaac and Jacob).</p>
<p>Poncelet argued that his principle of continuity, which presumably
had been suggested by analytic geometry, was properly a development of
synthetic geometry, and he quickly became a champion of the latter
against the analysts. During the second half of the eighteenth century,
there had been some controversy, especially in Germany, about the
relative merits of analysis and synthesis. During the early nineteenth
century, interest in the rival methodologies in France was such that a
prize was offered in 1813 by the Bordeaux Scientific Society for the
best essay characterizing synthesis and analysis and the influence that
each had exerted. The winning essay, by a teacher at Versailles, closed
with the hope that there might be a reconciliation between the two
camps, but half a dozen years later, the controversy broke out again and
became increasingly bitter.</p>
<p>The history of geometry in the nineteenth century is replete with
cases of independent discovery and rediscovery. One example is that of
the nine-point circle. Poncelet and Brianchon published a joint paper in
Gergonne’s Annales for 1820 1821, which, though titled “Recherches sur
la de´termination d’une hyperbole e´quilate`re,” contained a proof of
the beautiful theorem that</p>
<p>The circle which passes through the feet of the perpendiculars,
dropped from the vertices of any triangle on the sides opposite to them,
passes also through the midpoints of these sides as well as through the
midpoints of the segments which join the vertices to the point of
intersection of the perpendiculars.</p>
<p>This theorem is generally named for neither Brianchon nor Poncelet,
but for an independent German mathematician, Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach
(1800 1834), who published it in 1822. The little monograph containing
this and some related propositions also included proofs of several
fascinating properties of the circle. Among these is the fact that the
center of the nine-point circle lies on the Euler line and is midway
between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and “Feuerbach’s theorem”
that the nine-point circle of any triangle is tangent internally to the
inscribed circle and tangent externally to the three escribed circles.
One enthusiast, the American geometer Julian Lowell Coolidge (1873
1954), called this “the most beautiful theorem in elementary geometry
that has been discovered since the time of Euclid.” It should be noted
that the charm of such theorems supported considerable investigation in
the geometry of triangles and circles during the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Returning to Poncelet, let us note that we remember him primarily for
his using existing Desarguesian concepts of central (point)
projections</p>
<p>S y nt he t ic Me tr ic Ge om e tr y: St einer</p>
<p>and points of infinity to establish the notion of the complex
projective plane. Basic is the study of projective properties defined as
those remaining invariant under perspectivities. Given a point O and a
line l in the plane, a perspectivity assigns to each point P a point Pu
on l such that if Q is a second point, there exists a point Qu on OQ
such that PQ intersects PuQu on l. A sequence of perspectivities is
called a projectivity. Again, calling on an approach used by Desargues,
Poncelet brought to the fore the Apollonian concepts of pole and polar
to which, as we have noted, he attributed his discovery of the principle
of duality.</p>
<p>The work of Poncelet was continued by Michel Chasles (1798 1880),
also a graduate of the E´cole Polytechnique, where he became professor
of machine technology in 1841; beginning in 1846, he held a chair for
higher geometry at the Sorbonne. To Chasles was due the emphasis in
projective geometry on the six cross ratios, or anharmonic ratios,
(c2a)/(c2b): (d2a)/(d2b) of four collinear points or four concurrent
lines, and the invariance of these under projective transformations. His
Traite´ de ge´ome´trie supe´rieure (1852) was influential as well in
establishing the use of directed line segments in pure geometry.
Chasles, who is also noted for his Aperc¸u historique sur l’origine et
la de´ve´loppement des me´thodes en ge´ome´trie (1837), was one of the
last great projective geometers in France. Late in life, he initiated
the study of enumerative geometry, that branch of algebraic geometry
whose task it is to determine the number of solutions of algebraic
problems by means of geometric interpretation. Here and elsewhere, he
made prominent use of the “principle of correspondence.”</p>
<h4 id="synthetic-metric-geometry-steiner">Synthetic Metric Geometry:
Steiner</h4>
<p>In many respects, Chasles’s results overlapped with those of several
German geometers. Foremost among them was Jakob Steiner, the man who has
been regarded as the greatest synthetic geometer of modern times. In his
hands, synthetic geometry made strides comparable to those made earlier
in analysis. He intensely disliked analytic methods. The term “analysis”
implies a certain amount of technique or machinery; analysis is often
referred to as a tool, a term never applied to synthesis. Steiner
objected to all kinds of tools or “props” in geometry. In a paper in
Crelle’s Journal, he demonstrated by synthetic methods alone a striking
theorem that naturally appears to belong to analysis: that a surface of
the third order contains only twenty-seven lines. Steiner also proved
that all Euclidean constructions can be performed with a straightedge
alone, provided that one is also given a single fixed circle. This
theorem shows that one cannot, in Euclidean geometry, dispense entirely
with the compasses, but that having used them to draw one circle, one
can thereafter discard them in favor of the straightedge alone.</p>
<p>Steiner’s name is recalled in many connections, including the
properties of the Steiner points: If one joins in all possible ways the
six points on a conic in Pascal’s mystic hexagon, one obtains sixty
Pascal lines that intersect three by three in twenty Steiner points.
Among Steiner’s unpublished discoveries are those relating to the
fruitful geometric transformation known as inversive geometry: If two
points P and Pu lie on a ray from the center O of a circle C of radius r
6¼ 0, and if the product of the distances OP and OPu is r2, then P and
Pu are said to be inverse to each other with respect to C. To every
point P outside the circle, there is a corresponding point inside the
circle. Inasmuch as there is no outside point Pu corresponding to P when
P coincides with the center O, one has in a sense a paradox similar to
that of Bolzano: The inside of every circle, no matter how small,
contains, as it were, one more point than the portion of the plane
outside the circle. In an exactly analogous manner, one readily defines
the inverse of a point in three-dimensional space with respect to a
sphere.</p>
<p>A host of theorems in plane or solid inversive geometry are readily
proved by either analytic or synthetic methods. In particular, it is
easy to show that a circle not passing through the center of inversion
is transformed under a plane inversion, into a circle, whereas a circle
through the center of inversion goes into a straight line not passing
through the center of inversion (with analogous results holding for
spheres and planes in three-dimensional inversive geometry). Somewhat
more difficult to establish is the more significant result that
inversion is a conformal transformation, that is, that angles between
curves are preserved in this geometry. That angle-preserving
transformations are far from usual is clear from a theorem proved by
Joseph Liouville that in space, the only ones that are conformal are
inversions and similarity and congruency transformations. Steiner did
not publish his ideas on inversion, and the transformation was
rediscovered several times by other mathematicians of the century,
including Lord Kelvin (or William Thomson, 1824 1907), who, in 1845,
arrived at it through physics and who applied it to problems in
electrostatics.</p>
<p>If the center O of the circle of inversion of radius a is at the
origin of a plane Cartesian coordinate system, the coordinates xu and yu

account of them and who later generalized them for three dimensions.</p>
<h4 id="synthetic-nonmetric-geometry-von-staudt">Synthetic Nonmetric
Geometry: von Staudt</h4>
<p>Steiner, in his Systematische Entwicklungen of 1832, had produced a
treatment of projective geometry based on metric considerations. Some
years later, pure geometry found another German devotee in K. G. C. von
Staudt (1798 1867), a one-time student of Gauss’s, whose Geometrie der
Lage of 1847 built up projective geometry without reference to magnitude
or number. Von Staudt, after defining the cross ratio of four points x1,
x2, x3, and x4 as x1 2x3 /x1 2x4 :x2 2x3 /x2 2x4, made a harmonic set of
points (a set whose cross ratio is 1) fundamental to building up
projective geometry; two pencils of points are said to be projective if
harmonic sets are preserved. Von Staudt’s geometry was exceedingly
significant in showing how a projective geometry could be established
without the concept of distance, thus paving the way for the idea of
having a nonmetric geometry on which a notion of distance could be
defined. A few years later, Edmond Laguerre (1834 1886) in France
discussed the possibility of imposing a measure on a nonmetric angle
geometry. It was Arthur Cayley, however, who subsequently presented the
most influential elaboration on the whole concept of defining a metric
on a projective geometry in his “Sixth Memoir on Quantics.”</p>
<h4 id="analytic-geometry-1">Analytic Geometry</h4>
<p>As Monge had been perhaps the first modern specialist in geometry in
general, so Julius Plu¨cker (1801 1868) became the first specialist in
analytic geometry in particular. His earliest publications in Gergonne’s
Annales in 1826 had been largely synthetic, but he inadvertently became
so embroiled in controversy with Poncelet that he forsook the camp of
the synthesists and became the most prolific of all analytic geometers.
Algebraic methods, he came to believe firmly, were much to be preferred
to the purely geometric approach of Poncelet and Steiner. That his name
survives in coordinate geometry in what is called Plu¨cker’s abridged
notation is a tribute to his influence, although, in this case, the
phrase does him more than justice. During the early nineteenth century,
a number of men, including Gergonne, had recognized that analytic
geometry was burdened by awkwardness in algebraic computation; hence,
they began to drastically abbreviate notations. The family of all
circles through the intersection of the two circles x2 1y2 1ax1by1c50
and x2 1y2 1aux1buy1cu 50, for instance, was written by Gabriel Lame´
(1795 1870) in 1818 simply as mC1muCu 50, using two parameters or
multipliers m and mu. Gergonne and Plu¨cker preferred a single Greek
multiplier, the former writing C1lCu 50, from which we have the word
“lambdalizing,” and the latter using C1μCu 50, resulting in the phrase
“Plu¨cker’s μ.” Lame´ seems to have been the initiator in the study in
analytic geometry of one-parameter families through abridged notation,
but it was Plu¨cker who, especially during the years 1827 1829, carried
this study furthest.</p>
<p>Among the many uses Plu¨cker made of abridged notation was one of
1828, in Gergonne’s Annales, in which he explained the Cramer-Euler
paradox. If, for example, one has fourteen random points in a plane, the
quartic curve through these points can be written as Q1μQu 50, where Q50
and Qu 50 are distinct quartics through the same thirteen of the
fourteen given points. Let μ be so determined that the coordinates of
the fourteenth point satisfy Q1μQu 50. Then, Q50, Qu 50, and Q1uQu 50
all have in common not only the original thirteen points, but also all
sixteen points of intersection of Q50 and Qu 50. Hence, with any set of
thirteen points there are three additional points dependent on, or
associated with, the original thirteen, and no set of fourteen or more
points selected from the combined set of sixteen dependent points will
determine a unique quartic curve, despite the fact that a random set of
fourteen points will in general uniquely determine a quartic curve. More
generally, any given set of</p>
<p>nðn13Þ</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>random points will determine a concomitant set of</p>
<p>n2 2ð Þ 215 ð Þð Þ n n13 n21 n22</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>additional “dependent” points such that any curve of degree n through
the given set of points will also pass through the dependent points. In
addition, Plu¨cker gave a dual of his theorem on the paradox, as well as
generalizations to surfaces in three dimensions.</p>
<p>It was Plu¨cker who, in the first volume of his
Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen (1828), elevated the abridged
notation of Lame´ and Gergonne to the status of a principle; in the
second volume of this influential work (1831), Plu¨cker effectively
rediscovered a new system of coordinates that had been independently
invented three times earlier. This was what we now call homogeneous
coordinates, of which Feuerbach was one inventor. Another discoverer was
A. F. Mo¨bius (1790 1860),
alsoastudentofGauss’s,whopublishedhisschemein1827inaworkwith the title
Der barycentrische Calcul. He introduced his “barycentric coordinates”
by considering a given triangle ABC and defining the coordinates of a
point P as the mass to be placed at A, B, and C so that P is the center
of gravity of these masses. Mo¨bius classified transformations according
to whether they were congruences (leaving corresponding figures equal),
similarities (corresponding figures similar), affine (corresponding
figures preserving parallel lines), or collineations (lines going into
lines) and suggested the study of invariants under each family of
transformations. The author of Der barycentrische Calcul is best known,
however, for the one-sided surface that bears his name—the Mo¨bius strip
or band obtained by joining the ends of a segment of ribbon after one
end has been turned upside down. Still another inventor of homogeneous
coordinates was E´tienne Bobillier (1798 1840), a graduate of the E´cole
Polytechnique who published his new coordinate system in Gergonne’s
Annales for 1827 1828.</p>
<p>The notations and patterns of reasoning of the four inventors of
homogeneous coordinates differed somewhat, but they all had one thing in
common—they made use of three coordinates, instead of two, to locate a
point in a plane. The systems were equivalent to what are also known as
trilinear coordinates. Plu¨cker, in fact, at first specifically took his
three coordinates x, y, and t of a point P in a plane to be the three
distances of P from the sides of a triangle of reference. Later, in
Volume II of his Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen, he gave the more
usual definition of homogeneous coordinates as any set of ordered number
triples (x, y, t) related to the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y) of P such
that x5Xt and y5Yt. It will immediately be apparent that the homogeneous
coordinates of a point P are not unique, for the triples (x, y, t) and
(kx, ky, kt) correspond to the same Cartesian pair (x/t, y/t). This lack
of uniqueness, however, causes no more difficulty than does the lack of
uniqueness in polar coordinates or the lack of uniqueness of form in the
case of equal fractions. The name “homogeneous” stems, of course, from
the fact that when one uses the equations of transformation to convert
the equation of a curve f(X, Y)50 in rectangular Cartesian coordinates
to the form f(x/t, y/t)50, the new equation will contain terms all of
the same degree in the variables x, y, and t. More important, it will be
noted that there is in the system of Cartesian coordinates no number
pair corresponding to a homogeneous plane number triple of the form (x,
y, 0). Such a triple (provided that x and y are not both zero)
designates an ideal point, or a “point at infinity.” At long last, the
infinite elements of Kepler, Desargues, and Poncelet had been tied down
to a coordinate system of ordinary numbers. Moreover, just as any
ordered triple of real numbers (not all zero) in homogeneous coordinates
corresponds to a point in a plane, so also does every linear equation
ax1by1ct50 (provided that a, b, and c are not all zero) correspond to a
straight line in the plane. In particular, all of the “points at
infinity” in the plane obviously lie on the line given by the equation
t50, known as the line at infinity or the ideal line in the plane. It is
obvious that this new system of coordinates is ideally suited to the
study of projective geometry, which up to this time had been approached
almost exclusively from the point of view of pure geometry.</p>
<p>Homogeneous coordinates were a big step in the direction of the
arithmetization of geometry, but in 1829, Plu¨cker contributed to
Crelle’s Journal a paper with a revolutionary point of view that broke
completely with the old Cartesian view of coordinates as line segments.
The equation of a straight line in homogeneous coordinates has the form
ax1by1ct50. The three coefficients of parameters (a, b, c) determine a
unique straight line in the plane, just as the three homogeneous
coordinates (x, y, t) correspond to a unique point in the plane.
Inasmuch as coordinates are numbers, hence not unlike coefficients,
Plu¨cker saw that one could modify the usual language and call (a, b, c)
the homogeneous coordinates of a line. If, finally, one reverses the
Cartesian convention so that letters at the beginning of the alphabet
designate variables and those near the end of the alphabet designate
constants, the equation ax1by1ct50 represents a pencil of lines through
the fixed point (x, y, t), rather than a pencil of points on the fixed
line (a, b, c). If, now, one considers the noncommittal equation
pu1qv1rw50, it is clear that one can consider this indifferently as the
totality of points (u, v, w) lying on the fixed line (p, q, r) or as the
totality of lines (p, q, r) through the fixed point (u, v, w).</p>
<p>Plu¨cker had discovered the immediate analytic counterpart of the
geometric principle of duality, about which Gergonne and Poncelet had
quarreled; it now became clear that the justification that pure geometry
had sought in vain was here supplied by the algebraic point of view. The
interchange of the words “point” and “line” merely corresponds to an
interchange of the words “constant” and “variable” with respect to the
quantities p,q, r andu, v,w. Fromthesymmetry ofthe algebraic situation,
it is clear that every theorem concerning pu1qv1rw50 immediately appears
in two forms, one the dual of the other. Moreover, Plu¨cker showed that
every curve (other than a straight line) can be regarded as having a
dual origin: It is a locus generated by a moving point and enveloped by
a moving line, the point moving continuously along the line while the
line continues to rotate about the point. Oddly enough, the degree of a
curve in point coordinates (the “order” of the curve) need not be the
same as the degree of the curve in line coordinates (the “class” of the
curve), and one of Plu¨cker’s great achievements, published in Crelle’s
Journal for1834,wasthediscoveryoffourequations,whichnowbearhisname,that
relate the class and the order of a curve with the singularities of the
curve:</p>
<p>m5nðn21Þ22δ23κ and n5mðm21Þ22τ23ι;</p>
<p>l53nðn22Þ26δ28κ and κ53mðm22Þ26τ28t;</p>
<p>where m is the class, n the order, δ the number of nodes, κ the
number of cusps, ι the number of stationary tangents (points of
inflection), and τ the number of bitangents. From these equations, it is
clear at a glance that a conic (of order two) can have no singularities
and thus must also be of class two.</p>
<p>In later papers and volumes, Plu¨cker extended his work to include
imaginary Cartesian and homogeneous coordinates. It was now a trivial
matter to justify Poncelet’s theorem that all circles have in common two
imaginary points at infinity, for the points (1, i, 0) and (i, 1, 0)
both satisfy the equation x2 1y2 1axt1byt1ct2 50, no matter what values
a, b, c may take on. Plu¨cker also showed that the foci of conics have
the property that the imaginary tangents from these points to the curve
pass through the above two circular points; he therefore defined a focus
of a higher plane curve as a point having this property.</p>
<p>During the days of Descartes and Fermat and again in the time of
Monge and Lagrange, France had been the center for the development of
analytic geometry, but with the work of Plu¨cker, leadership in the
field crossed the Rhine to Germany. Nevertheless, Plu¨cker was, to a
considerable extent, the proverbial prophet without honor in his own
country. There, Steiner, the champion of synthetic methods, was
inordinately admired. Mo¨bius remained neutral in the analysis-synthesis
controversy, but Jacobi, despite the fact that he himself was an
algorithm-builder, joined Steiner in polemically opposing Plu¨cker.
Discouraged, in 1847, Plu¨cker turned from geometry to physics, where he
published a series of papers on magnetism and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>One notes with surprise that Plu¨cker had not taken advantage of
developments in determinants, possibly because of his feud with Jacobi;
this may have been why he did not systematically develop an analytic
geometry of more than three dimensions. Plu¨cker had come close to this
notion through his observation in 1846 that the four parameters
determining a line in three-dimensional space can be thought of as four
coordinates, but only long afterward, in 1865, did he return to analytic
geometry and develop the idea of a “new geometry of space”—a
four-dimensional space in which straight lines, rather than points, were
the basic elements. Meanwhile, in 1843, Cayley had initiated the
ordinary analytic geometry of n-dimensional space, using determinants as
an essential tool. In this notation, using homogeneous coordinates, the
equations of the line and the plane, respectively, can be written as</p>
<p>x y z t</p>
<p>x y z t</p>
<p>x y t 50 and 50:</p>
<p>x1 y1 t1 132 132 231 1</p>

<p>x2 y2 t2</p>
<p>x y z t3</p>
<p>Cayleypointedoutthatthecorrespondingfundamental(n2l)-dimensional
element in n-dimensional space can be expressed in homogeneous
coordinates by a determinant, similar to those above, of order n11. Many
of the simple formulas for two and three dimensions, when properly
expressed, can easily be generalized to n dimensions. In 1846, Cayley
published a paper in Crelle’s Journal, in which he again extended some
theorems from three dimensions to a space of four dimensions; in 1847,
CauchypublishedanarticleintheComptesRendus,inwhichheconsidered
“analytical points” and “analytical lines” in space of more than three
dimensions.</p>
<h4 id="non-euclidean-geometry">Non-Euclidean Geometry</h4>
<p>In non-Euclidean geometry, we find a startling case of simultaneity
of discovery, for similar notions occurred, during the first third of
the nineteenth century, to three men, one German, one Hungarian, and one
Russian. We have already noted that during the second decade of the
century, Gauss had come to the conclusion that the efforts to prove the
parallel postulate made by Saccheri, Lambert, Legendre, and his
Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai were in vain and that geometries other
than Euclid’s were possible. Yet he had not shared this view with
others; he had simply elaborated the idea, as he said, “for himself.”
Hence, efforts to prove the parallel postulate continued, and among
those attempting such a proof was young Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky
(1793 1856). Lobachevsky is regarded as the “Copernicus of geometry,”
the man who revolutionized the subject through the creation of a whole
new branch, Lobachevskian geometry, thereby showing that Euclidean
geometry was not the exact science or the absolute truth it previously
had been taken to be. Through the work of Lobachevsky, it became
necessary to revise fundamental views of the nature of mathematics, but
Lobachevsky’s colleagues were too close to the situation to see it in
proper perspective, and the trailblazer had to pursue his thoughts in
lonely isolation.</p>
<p>Lobachevsky’s revolutionary view seems not to have come to him as a
sudden inspiration. In an outline of geometry that he drew up in 1823,
presumably for classroom use, Lobachevsky said of the parallel postulate
simply that “no rigorous proof of the truth of this had ever been
discovered.” Apparently, he did not then exclude the possibility that
such a proof might yet be discovered. Three years later at Kazan
University, he read in French a paper (now lost) on the principles of
geometry, including “une de´monstration rigoreuse du
the´ore<code>me des paralle</code>les.” The year 1826 in which this
paper was delivered may be taken as the unofficial birth date of
Lobachevskian geometry, for it was then that the author presented many
of the characteristic theorems of the new subject. Another three years
later, in the Kazan Messenger for 1829, Lobachevsky published an
article, “On the Principles of Geometry,”</p>
<p>Non Euc lide an Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>which marks the official birth of non-Euclidean geometry. Between
1826 and 1829, he had become thoroughly convinced that Euclid’s fifth
postulate cannot be proved on the basis of the other four, and in the
paper of 1829, he became the first mathematician to take the
revolutionary step of publishing a geometry specifically built on an
assumption in direct conflict with the parallel postulate: Through a
point C lying outside a line AB there can be drawn more than one line in
the plane and not meeting AB. With this new postulate, Lobachevsky
deduced a harmonious geometric structure having no inherent logical
contradictions. This was in every sense a valid geometry, but so
contrary to common sense did it appear, even to Lobachevsky, that he
called it “imaginary geometry.”</p>
<p>Lobachevsky was well aware of the significance of his discovery of
“imaginary geometry,” as is clear from the fact that during the score of
years from 1835 to 1855, he wrote out three full accounts of the new
geometry. In 1835 1838, his New Foundations of Geometry appeared in
Russian; in 1840, he published Geometrical Investigations on the Theory
of Parallels in German; and in 1855, his last book, Pangeometry, was
published simultaneously in French and Russian. (All have since been
translated into other languages, including English.) From the second of
the three works, Gauss learned of Lobachevsky’s contributions to
nonEuclidean geometry, and it was on his recommendation that in 1842,
Lobachevsky was elected to the Go¨ttingen Scientific Society. In letters
to friends, Gauss praised Lobachevsky’s work, but he never gave it
support in print, for he feared the jibes of “the Boeotians.” Partly for
this reason, the new geometry became known only very slowly.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Hungarian friend Farkas Bolyai had spent much of his life
trying to prove the parallel postulate, and when he found that his own
son Janos Bolyai (1802 1860) was absorbed in the problem of parallels,
the father, a provincial mathematics teacher, wrote to the son, a
dashing army officer:</p>
<p>For God’s sake, I beseech you, give it up. Fear it no less than
sensual passions because it, too, may take all your time, and deprive
you of your health, peace of mind, and happiness in life.</p>
<p>The son, not dissuaded, continued his efforts until, in about 1829,
he came to the conclusion reached only a few years earlier by
Lobachevsky. Instead of attempting to prove the impossible, he developed
what he called the “Absolute Science of Space,” starting from the
assumption that through a point not on a line, infinitely many lines can
be drawn in the plane, each parallel to the given line. Janos sent his
reflections to his father, who published them in the form of an appendix
to a treatise that he had completed, bearing a long Latin title
beginning with Tentamen. The elder Bolyai’s Tentamen bears an imprimatur
dated 1829, the year of Lobachevsky’s Kazan Messenger article, but it
did not actually appear until 1832.</p>
<p>Gauss’s reaction to the “Absolute Science of Space” was similar to
that in the case of Lobachevsky—sincere approval, but lack of support in
print. When Farkas Bolyai wrote to ask for an opinion on the unorthodox
work of his son, Gauss replied that he could not praise Janos’s work,
for this would mean self-praise, inasmuch as he had held these views for
many years. The temperamental Janos was understandably disturbed,
fearing that he would be deprived of priority. Continued lack of
recognition, as well as the publication of Lobachevsky’s work in German
in 1840, so upset him that he published nothing more. The lion’s share
of the credit for the development of non-Euclidean geometry consequently
belongs to Lobachevsky.</p>
<p>Riemannian Geometry</p>
<p>Non-Euclidean geometry continued for several decades to be a fringe
aspect of mathematics until it was thoroughly integrated through the
remarkably general views of G. F. B. Riemann (1826 1866). The son of a
village pastor, Riemann was brought up in very modest circumstances,
always remaining frail in body and shy in manner. He nevertheless
secured a good education, first at Berlin and later at Go¨ttingen, where
he took his doctorate with a thesis in theory of functions of a complex
variable. It is here that we find the so-called Cauchy-Riemann
equations, ux 5vy, uy 52vx, which an analytic function w5f(z)5u1iv of a
complex variable z5x1iy must satisfy, although this requirement had been
known even in the days of Euler and d’Alembert. The thesis also led to
the concept of a Riemann surface, anticipating the part that topology
ultimately was to play in analysis.</p>
<p>In 1854, Riemann became a privatdozent at the University of
Go¨ttingen, and according to custom, he was called on to deliver a
Habilitationsschrift before the faculty. The result, in Riemann’s case,
was the most celebrated probationary lecture in the history of
mathematics, for it presented a deep and broad view of the whole field
of geometry. The thesis bore the title “U¨ ber die Hypothesen welche der
Geometrie zu Grunde liegen”
(“OntheHypotheseswhichLieattheFoundationofGeometry”),butitdid not
present a specific example. It instead urged a global view of geometry
as a study of manifolds of any number of dimensions in any kind of
space. His geometries are non-Euclidean in a far more general sense than
is Lobachevskian geometry, where the question is simply how many
parallels are possible through a point. Riemann saw that geometry should
not even necessarily deal with points or lines or space in the ordinary
sense, but with sets of ordered n-tuples that are combined according to
certain rules.</p>
<p>Rie mannian Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>Among the most important rules in any geometry, Riemann saw, is that
for finding the distance between two points that are infinitesimally
close together. In ordinary Euclidean geometry, this “metric” is given
by ds2 5dx2 1dy2 1dz2, but infinitely many other formulas can be used as
a distance formula, and, of course, the metric used will determine the
propertiesofthespaceorthegeometry.Aspacewhosemetricisoftheform</p>

<p>1g21 dydx1g22 dy2 1g23 dydz</p>
<p>1g13 dzdx1g23 dzdy1g33 dz2;</p>
<p>where the g’s are constants or, more generally, functions of x, y,
and z, is known as a Riemannian space. Thus, (locally) Euclidean space
is only the very special case of a Riemannian space in which g11 5g22 5
g33 51 and all the other g’s are zero. Riemann even developed from the
metric a formula for the Gaussian curvature of a “surface” in his
“space.” It is no wonder that after Riemann’s lecture and for almost the
only time in his long career, Gauss expressed enthusiasm for the work of
someone else.</p>
<p>There is a more restricted sense in which we today use the phrase
“Riemannian geometry”: the plane geometry that is deduced from
Saccheri’s hypothesis of the obtuse angle if the infinitude of the
straight line is also abandoned. A model for this geometry is found in
the interpretation of the “plane” as the surface of a sphere and of a
“straight line” as a great circle on the sphere. In this case, the angle
sum of a triangle is greater than two right angles, whereas in the
geometry of Lobachevsky and Bolyai (corresponding to the hypothesis of
the acute angle), the angle sum is less than two right angles. This use
of Riemann’s name, however, fails to do justice to the fundamental
change in geometric thought that his 1854 Habilitationsschrift (not
published until 1867) brought about. It was Riemann’s suggestion of the
general study of curved metric spaces, rather than of the special case
equivalent to geometry on the sphere, that ultimately made the theory of
general relativity possible. Riemann himself contributed heavily to
theoretical physics in a number of directions, and it was therefore
fitting that in 1859 he should have been appointed as successor to
Dirichlet in the chair at Go¨ttingen that Gauss had filled.</p>
<p>In showing that non-Euclidean geometry with angle sum greater than
two right angles is realized on the surface of a sphere, Riemann
essentially verified the consistency of the axioms from which the
geometry is derived. In much the same sense, Eugenio Beltrami (1835
1900), a colleague of Cremona’s at Bologna and later a professor at
Pisa, Pavia, and Rome, showed that there was at hand a corresponding
model for Lobachevskian geometry. This is the surface generated through
the revolution of a tractrix about its asymptote, a surface known as a
pseudosphere, inasmuch as it has constant negative curvature, as the
sphere has constant positive curvature.</p>
<p>If we define the “straight line” through two points on the
pseudosphere as the geodesic through the points, the resulting geometry
will have the properties resulting from the Lobachevskian postulates.
Inasmuch as the plane is a surface with constant zero curvature,
Euclidean geometry can be regarded as an intermediary between the two
types of nonEuclidean geometry.</p>
<h4 id="spaces-of-higher-dimensions">Spaces of Higher Dimensions</h4>
<p>The unification of geometry that Riemann had achieved was especially
relevant in the microscopic aspect of differential geometry, or geometry
“in the small.” Analytic geometry, or geometry “in the large,” had not
been much changed. In fact, Riemann’s lecture was given at about the
midpoint of Plu¨cker’s self-imposed geometric retirement, during which
there had been something of a lull in analytic geometric activity in
Germany. In 1865, Plu¨cker again resumed mathematical publication, this
time in British publications instead of in Crelle’s Journal, probably
because Cayley had shown interest in Plu¨cker’s work. In this year, he
published a paper in the Philosophical Transactions (often known simply
as Phil. Trans.), expanded three years later into a book on a “new
geometry” of space. Here, he explicitly formulated a principle at which
he had hinted about twenty years earlier. A space, he argued, need not
be thought of as a totality of points; it can equally well be visualized
as composed of lines. In fact, any figure that formerly had been thought
of as a locus or a totality of points can itself be taken as a space
element, and the dimensionality of the space will correspond to the
number of parameters determining this element. If our ordinary
three-space is considered a “cosmic haystack of infinitely thin,
infinitely long straight straws,” rather than an “agglomeration of
infinitely fine birdshot,” it is four-dimensional, rather than
three-dimensional. In 1868, the year of Plu¨cker’s book based on this
theme, Cayley analytically developed in the Phil. Trans. the notion of
the ordinary two-dimensional Cartesian plane as a space of five
dimensions, the elements of which are conics. In Plu¨cker’s Neue
Geometrie des Raumes, there are also other new ideas. The geometric
representation of a single equation f(x, y, z)50 in point coordinates is
called a surface, two simultaneous equations correspond to a curve, and
three equations determine one or more points. In the “new geometry” of
his four-dimensional line space, Plu¨cker called the “figure”
represented by a single equation f(r, s, t, u)50 in the four coordinates
of his line space a “complex,” two equations designated a “congruence,”
and three a “range.” He found that the quadratic line complex has
properties similar to those of the quadric surface, but he did not live
to complete the extensive study he planned. He died in 1868, the year in
which</p>
<p>F eli x K lein</p>
<p>the first volume of his New Geometry appeared, followed a year later
by the second, edited by one of his students, Felix Klein (1849
1925).</p>
<h4 id="felix-klein">Felix Klein</h4>
<p>Klein had been Plu¨cker’s assistant at the University of Bonn during
the latter’s return to geometry, and, in a sense, he was Plu¨cker’s
successor in his enthusiasm for analytic geometry. Yet the young man’s
work in the field took a different direction—one that served to bring
some element of unity into the diversity of new results of research. The
new view may have been in part the result of visits to Paris, where
Lagrange’s hints of group theory had been developed, especially through
substitution groups, into a full-blown branch of algebra. Klein was
deeply impressed by the unifying possibilities in the group concept, and
he spent much of the rest of his life in developing, applying, and
popularizing the notion.</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a group with respect to a given
operation if (1) the set of elements is closed under the operation, (2)
the set contains an identity element with respect to the operation, (3)
for every element in the set there is an inverse element with respect to
the operation, and (4) the operation is associative. The elements can be
numbers (as in arithmetic), points (in geometry), transformations (in
algebra or geometry), or anything at all. The operation can be
arithmetic (such as addition or multiplication) or geometric (as a
rotation about a point or an axis) or any other rule for combining two
elements of a set (such as two transformations) to form a third element
in the set. The generality of the group concept is readily apparent.
Klein, in a celebrated inaugural program in 1872, when he became a
professor at Erlangen, showed how it could be applied as a convenient
means of characterizing the various geometries that had appeared during
the century.</p>
<p>The program that Klein gave, which became known as the Erlanger
Programm, described geometry as the study of those properties of figures
that remain invariant under a particular group of transformations.
Hence, any classification of groups of transformations becomes a
codification of geometries. Plane Euclidean geometry, for example, is
the study of such properties of figures, including areas and lengths, as
remain invariant under the group of transformations made up of
translations and rotations in the plane—the so-called rigid
transformations, equivalent to Euclid’s unstated axiom that figures
remain unchanged when moved about in a plane. Analytically, the rigid
plane transformations can be written in the form</p>
<p>x0 5ax1by1c; y0 5dx1ey1f; where ae2bd51; these form the elements of a
group. The “operation” that “combines” two such elements is simply that
of performing the transformations in order. It is easy to see that if
the previous transformation is followed by a second,</p>
<p>xv 5Ax0 1By0 1C; yv 5Dx0 1Ey0 1F;</p>
<p>the result of the two operations performed successively is equivalent
to some single operation of this type that will carry the point (x, y)
into the point (xv, yv).</p>
<p>If, in this transformation group, one replaces the restriction that
ae2bd51 by the more general requirement that ae2bd 6¼ 0, the new
transformations also form a group. Lengths and areas do not necessarily
remain the same, however, but a conic of given type (ellipse, parabola,
or hyperbola) will, under these transformations, remain a conic of the
same type. Such transformations, studied earlier by Mo¨bius, are known
as affine transformations; they characterize a geometry known as affine
geometry, so called because a finite point goes into a finite point
under any such transformation. It is clear, then, that Euclidean
geometry, in Klein’s view, is only a special case of affine geometry.
Affine geometry, in its turn, becomes only a special case of a still
more general geometry—projective geometry. A projective transformation
can be written in the form</p>
<p>ax1by1c Ax1By1c x0 5; y0 5: dx1ey1f dx1ey1f</p>
<p>It is clear that if d505e and f51, the transformation is affine.
Interesting properties of projective transformations include the fact
that (1) a conic is transformed into a conic and (2) the cross ratio
remains invariant.</p>
<p>The work of Klein is, in a sense, a fitting climax to “The Heroic Age
in Geometry,” for he taught and lectured for half a century. So
contagious was his enthusiasm that some late-nineteenth-century figures
were willing to prophesy that not only geometry, but all of mathematics,
ultimately would be contained within the theory of groups. Nevertheless,
not all of Klein’s work was concerned with groups. His classic history
of mathematics in the nineteenth century (published posthumously) shows
how familiar he was with all aspects of the subject; his name is also
recalled today in topology in the one-sided surface known as the Klein
bottle. He was much concerned with non-Euclidean geometry, to which he
contributed the names “elliptic geometry” and “hyperbolic geometry” for
the hypotheses of the obtuse and the acute angle, respectively; for the
latter, he proposed a simple model as an alternative to that of
Beltrami.</p>
<p>Po s t Rie mannian Algebraic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>Let the hyperbolic plane be pictured as the points interior to a
circle C in the Euclidean plane, let the hyperbolic “straight line”
through two points P1 and P2 be that portion of the Euclidean line P1,
P2 that lies within C, and let the “distance” between the two points P1
and P2 within the circle be defined as</p>
<p>P2Q1UP1Q2 ln ;</p>
<p>P1Q1UP2Q2</p>
<p>where Q1 and Q2 are the points of intersection of the line P1P2 with
the circle C (Fig. 20.1). With an appropriate definition of “angle”
between two “lines,” the “points,” “lines,” and “angles” in Klein’s
hyperbolic model have properties similar to those in Euclidean geometry,
except for the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>Not since Monge had there been a more influential teacher, for, in
addition to giving inspiring lectures, Klein was concerned with the
teaching of mathematics at many levels and exerted a strong influence in
pedagogical circles. In 1886, he became a professor of mathematics at
Go¨ttingen, and under his leadership, the university became a mecca to
which students from many lands, including America, flocked. In his later
years, Klein very effectively played the role of an “elder statesman” in
the realm of mathematics. Thus, the golden age of modern geometry that
had begun so auspiciously in France at the E´cole Polytechnique, with
the work of Lagrange, Monge, and Poncelet, reached its zenith in
Germany, at the University of Go¨ttingen, through the research and
inspiration of Gauss, Riemann, and Klein.</p>
<h4 id="post-riemannian-algebraic-geometry">Post-Riemannian Algebraic
Geometry</h4>
<p>There were several new approaches to geometry toward the end of the
century that are usually classified as versions of algebraic geometry.
These had a common basis in the work of Riemann. Rather than Riemann’s
explicitly geometric publications, it was his work on complex function
theory, especially as linked to the concept of a Riemann surface in a
classic paper on Abelian functions, that provided the stimulus for most
of these investigations.</p>
<p>Initially, Alfred Clebsch (1833 1872) did more than anyone else to
exploit Riemann’s function theory for geometric purposes. Clebsch, a
mathematical grandson of Jacobi via the geometer Otto Hesse (1811 1874),
had studied in Ko¨nigsberg, where he came under the influence of the
mathematical physicist Franz Neumann. His teaching career took him from
the polytechnic high school in Karlsruhe to Giessen, where he spent five
years, before being called to Go¨ttingen. In 1868, he and Franz
Neumann’s son, Carl (1832 1925), cofounded the journal Mathematische
Annalen.</p>
<p>Clebsch first called attention to our subject in a paper “On the
Application of Abelian Functions to Geometry,” which appeared in the
Journal fu¨r die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This was the beginning
of a triply oriented attack. Clebsch initially set out simply to apply
Riemann’s theory of complex functions to the study of algebraic curves.
He was well equipped to carry this out; he was familiar with the
previous work of the complex projective geometers, with the Jacobi
tradition of Abelian function theory, and with Riemann’s papers. He
obtained many fruitful results, which laid the basis for further
research. For example, he obtained a classification of curves by genus
and also considered subclasses of curves having the same genus but
different branching points.</p>
<p>Another approach was used in work that Clebsch did in collaboration
with Paul Gordan (1837 1912) of Erlangen. In a book of 1866, the Theorie
der Abelschen Functionen, they set out to reestablish the theory of
Abelian functions on the basis of algebraic geometry. Gordan is
remembered as a champion of nineteenth-century invariant theory, and we
note in this context that the turn-of-the-century school of Italian
geometers, which included Guido Castelnuovo (1865 1952), Federigo
Enriques (1871 1946), and, somewhat later, Francesco Severi (1879 1961),
relied heavily on invariants as well.</p>
<p>Finally, Clebsch turned to surfaces. He introduced double integrals,
hoping to obtain results by exploring the analogy with the Abelian
integrals applied to the study of curves. He, along with Cayley, Max
Noether (1844 1921), and the Danish mathematician H. G. Zeuthen (1839
1920), was successful for a large number of cases. Their work
wascontinuedbyE´milePicard,aspecialistinthestudyofdoubleintegrals. His
research was the basis for later results by Beppo Levi (1875 1928).
Yetbecauseofthecomplicatednatureofmanysurfaces,thisapproachwas less
successful than was initially hoped for.</p>
<p>The most active direction followed was that in which geometers
applied birational transformations to the study of curves. Many of
them</p>
<p>Po s t Rie mannian Algebraic Ge ome tr y</p>
<p>put their studies in Riemannian terms by noting that Riemann’s moduli
are simply birational invariants. Despite much activity by
mathematicians in the main European centers, the results eventually
seemed disappointing. By the 1920s, most of these “algebro-geometric”
efforts began to take a backseat to a purely algebraic approach, which
dominated algebraic geometry for several decades, while increasing in
generality and abstractness.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>
<p>The development of algebraic concepts in England in the first half of
the nineteenthcenturydifferedfundamentallyfromthatontheContinent.Abel,
Galois, and other Continental mathematicians evolved new concepts while
working on unsolved problems and adapting—through fusion,
generalization, or straight transfer—existing successful methods. As we

thisallowedtheirworktoberecognizedforitsimmediateresults,evenifthe full
significance of a new concept contained therein went undetected. The
British contributors to algebra who belonged to the generation of Abel
and Galois, on the other hand, set out to establish algebra as a
“demonstrative science.” These men were strongly affected by the fact
that England’s analytic contributions lagged behind those of the
Continent. This was attributed to the superiority of “symbolic
reasoning,” or, more specifically, of the Leibnizian dy/dx notation over
the fluxional dots still prevalent in</p>

<p>England.Sincetheseventeenthcentury,however,mathematicianshadbeen
noting that neither higher analysis nor algebra had attained the degree
of rigor found in geometry.</p>
<p>British Algebra and the Operational Calculus of Functions</p>
<p>It was George Peacock who produced the first major work “written with
a view of conferring upon Algebra the character of a demonstrative
science.” To accomplish this goal, Peacock proposed a reevaluation of
the relationship between arithmetic and algebra. Rather than being
viewed as the foundation of algebra, arithmetic “can only be considered
as a Science of Suggestion, to which the principles and operations of
Algebra are adapted, but by which they are neither limited nor
determined.” Peacock therefore separated “arithmetical” from
“symbolical” algebra. The elements of arithmetical algebra are numbers,
and its operations are those of arithmetic. Symbolical algebra, however,
is “a science, which regards the combinations of signs and symbols only
according to determinate laws, which are altogether independent of the
specific values of the symbols themselves.” Peacock related the two by a
principle reminiscent of Franc¸ois-Joseph Servois’s (1768 1847)
principle of the preservation of formal laws; it is the “principle of
the permanence of equivalent forms”:</p>
<p>Whatever form is algebraically equivalent to another when expressed
in general symbols, must continue to be equivalent whatever these
symbols denote.</p>
<p>Conversely,</p>
<p>Whatever equivalent form is discoverable in arithmetical algebra
considered as the science of suggestion when the symbols are general in
their form, though specific in their value, will continue to be an
equivalent form when the symbols are general in their nature as well as
in their form.</p>
<p>The justification for such a bold extrapolation is not made clear.
Peacock merely accepts this as a “principle of the permanence of
equivalent forms” somewhat akin to the correlation principle that Carnot
and Poncelet had used so fruitfully in geometry. Yet in one respect, the
algebraic form of this fuzzy postulate served as a deterrent to
progress, for it suggested that the laws of algebra are the same no
matter what the numbers or the objects within the algebra may be.
Peacock, it appears, was thinking primarily of the number system of
integers and the real magnitudes of geometry, and his distinction
between the two types of algebra was not so different from that which
Vie`te had made between logistica numerosa and logistica speciosa.</p>
<p>Peacock restated his views on algebra in a report on analysis
presented to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in
1833, whereby they became widely known. Within a few years, several
authors treated the subject anew, to varying degrees linking the
foundations of algebra to the operational calculus of functions, which
was also treated with renewed interest. Robert Murphy (1806 1843) did so
in a paper read to the Royal Society in December 1836; Augustus De
Morgan (1806 1871) did so in a Treatise on the Calculus of Functions
published the same year; and D. F. Gregory (1813 1844) did so in a
series of memoirs on the nature of algebra published in the Transactions
of the Edinburgh Royal Society a few years later. Gregory remarked on
the identity of the laws of combination for the symbols of
differentiation and differences and those of number and placed his and
Peacock’s studies in line of succession to those of Leibniz, Lagrange,
John F. W. Herschel, and Servois on the calculus. Gregory’s friend
George Boole, in a prizewinning essay presented to the Royal Society in
1844, stressed that</p>
<p>any great advances in the higher analysis must be sought for by an
increased attention to the laws of combinations of symbols. The value of
this principle can scarcely be overrated.</p>
<p>Three years later, Boole illustrated his position by applying the
laws of combination of symbols to logic.</p>
<p>Boole and theAlgebra of Logic</p>
<p>Born into an impecunious lower-class tradesman’s family in Lincoln,
England, George Boole (1815 1864) had only a common school education,
but he learned both Greek and Latin independently, believing that this
knowledge would help him rise above his station. Having become friendly
with De Morgan, he also took a keen interest in a controversy over logic
that the Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton (1788 1856), not to
be confused with the Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton
(1805 1865), had raised with De Morgan. The result was that in 1847,
Boole published a short work titled The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,
a little book that De Morgan recognized as epoch making.</p>
<p>The history of logic may be divided, with some slight degree of
oversimplification, into three stages: (1) Greek logic, (2) Scholastic
logic, and (3) mathematical logic. In the first stage, logical formulas
consisted of words of ordinary language, subject to the usual
syntactical rules. In the second stage, logic was abstracted from
ordinary language but characterized by differentiated syntactical rules
and specialized semantic functions. In the third stage, logic became
marked by the use of</p>
<p>B o ole and t he Algebra of L o gic</p>
<p>an artificial language in which words and signs have narrowly limited
semantic functions. Whereas in the first two stages, logical theorems
were derived from ordinary language, the logic of the third stage
proceeds in a contrary manner—it first constructs a purely formal
system, and only later does it look for an interpretation in everyday
speech. Although Leibniz is sometimes regarded as a precursor of the
latter point of view, its floruit date is really the year in which
Boole’s first book appeared, as well as De Morgan’s Formal Logic. The
work of Boole, in particular, emphasized that logic should be associated
with mathematics, rather than with metaphysics, as the Scottish Sir
William Hamilton had argued.</p>
<p>More important even than his mathematical logic was Boole’s view of
mathematics itself. In the introduction to his Mathematical Analysis of
Logic, the author objected to the then current view of mathematics as
the science of magnitude or number (a definition still adopted in some
of the weaker dictionaries). Espousing a far more general view, Boole
wrote,</p>
<p>We might justly assign it as the definitive character of a true
Calculus, that it is a method resting upon the employment of Symbols,
whose laws of combination are known and general, and whose results admit
of a consistent interpretation… . It is upon the foundation of this
general principle, that I propose to establish the Calculus of Logic,
and that I claim for it a place among the acknowledged forms of
Mathematical Analysis,</p>
<p>Peacock’s Algebra of 1830 had suggested that the symbols of objects
in algebra need not stand for numbers, and De Morgan argued that
interpretations of the symbols for operations were also arbitrary; Boole
carried the formalism to its conclusion. No longer was mathematics to be
limited to questions of number and continuous magnitude. Here, for the
first time, the view is clearly expressed that the essential
characteristic of mathematics is not so much its content as its form. If
any topic is presented in such a way that it consists of symbols and
precise rules of operation on these symbols, subject only to the
requirement of inner consistency, this topic is part of mathematics.
Although the Mathematical Analysis of Logic did not achieve wide
recognition, it probably was on the weight of this work that two years
later, Boole was appointed professor of mathematics at the newly
established Queens College in Cork.</p>
<p>Boole’s Investigation of the Laws of Thought of 1854 is a classic in
the history of mathematics, for it amplified and clarified the ideas
presented in 1847, establishing both formal logic and a new algebra,
known as Boolean algebra, the algebra of sets, or the algebra of logic.
Boole used the letters x, y, z, … to represent objects of a subset of
things—numbers, points, ideas, or other entities—selected from a
universal set or universe of discourse, the totality of which he
designated by the symbol or “number”</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For example, if the symbol 1 represents all Europeans, x might stand
for all Europeans who are French citizens, y might be all European men
over twenty-one, and z might be all Europeans who are between five and
six feet tall. The symbol or number 0 Boole took to indicate the empty
set, containing no element of the universal set, what now is known as
the null set. The sign1between two letters or symbols, as x1y, he took
to be the union of the subsets x and y—that is, the set made up of all
of the elements in x or y (or both). The multiplication sign 3
represented the intersection of sets, so that x3y means the elements or
the objects that are in the subset x and also in the subset y. In the
previous example, x1y consists of all Europeans who are French citizens
or are men over twenty-one or both; x3y (also written as x y or simply
as xy) is the set of French citizens who are men over twenty-one.
(Boole, unlike De Morgan, used exclusive union, not permitting common
elements in x and y, but modern Boolean algebra more conveniently
takes1to be the inclusive union of sets that may have elements in
common.) The sign5represents the relationship of identity. It is clear
that the five fundamental laws of algebra now hold for this Boolean
algebra, for x1y5y1x, xy5yx, x1(y1z)5(x1y)1z, x(yz)5(xy)z, and
x(y1z)5xy1xz. Nevertheless, not all of the rules of ordinary algebra
continue to be valid: for example, 11151 and x x5x. (The second of these
appears in the work of Boole, but not the first, because he used
exclusive union). The equation x2 5x has only the two roots, in ordinary
algebra, x 50 and x 51; in this respect, the algebra of logic and
ordinary algebra are in agreement. The equation x2 5x, when written in
the form x(l2x)50, also suggests that 1 2x should designate the
complement of the subset x, that is, all of the elements in the
universal set that are not in the subset x. Although it is true in
Boolean algebra that x3 5x or x(l2x2) 50 or x(1 2x)(l1x)50, the solution
in ordinary algebra differs from that in Boolean algebra, in which there
are no negative numbers. Boolean algebra also differs from ordinary
algebra in that if zx 5zy (where z is not the null set), it does not
follow that x5y; nor is it necessarily true that if xy 50, then x or y
must be 0.</li>
</ol>
<p>Boole showed that his algebra provided an easy algorithm for
syllogistic reasoning. The equation xy5x, for example, says very neatly
that all x’s are y’s. If it is also given that all y’s are z’s, then
yz5y. On substituting in the first equation the value of y given by the
second equation, the result is x(yz)5x. Using the associative law for
multiplication, the last equation can be written as (xy)z5x, and, on
replacing xy with x, we have xz5x, which is simply the symbolic way of
saying that all x’s are z’s.</p>
<p>The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) and, a fortiori,
Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854) contain much more of the
algebra of sets than we have indicated. In particular, the latter work
includes applications to probability. Notations have changed somewhat
since Boole’s day, so that union and intersection are generally
indicated by</p>
<p>Augus tus D e Mor gan</p>
<p>,and -, rather than by1and 3, and the symbol for the null set is φ,
rather than 0, but the fundamental principles of Boolean algebra are
those that were laid down by Boole more than a century ago.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of Boole’s work that is not closely related to his
treatises in logic or the theory of sets but that is familiar to every
student of differential equations. This is the algorithm of differential
operators, which he introduced to facilitate the treatment of linear
differential equations. If, for example, we wish to solve the
differential equation ayv 1 byu 1cy50, the equation is written in the
notation (aD2 1bD1c)y50. Then, regarding D as an unknown quantity,
rather than as an operator, we solve the algebraic quadratic equation
aD2 1bD1c50. If the roots of the algebraic equation are p and q, then
epx and eqx are solutions of the differential equation, and Aepx 1Beqx
is a general solution of the differential equation. There are many other
situations in which Boole, in his Treatise on Differential Equations of
1859, pointed out parallels between the properties of the differential
operator (and its inverse) and the rules of algebra. British
mathematicians in the second half of the nineteenth century were thus
again becoming leaders in algorithmic analysis, a field in which, fifty
years earlier, they had been badly deficient.</p>
<p>Boole died in 1864, only ten years after publishing his Investigation
of the Laws of Thought, but recognition, including an honorary degree
from the University of Dublin, had come to him before his death. It is
curious to note that Georg Cantor, who like Boole was one of the chief
trailblazers of the century, was one of the few who declined to accept
the work of Boole. On the other hand, Boole’s work prompted a sequence
of axiomatic studies by W. S. Jevons (1835 1882), C. S. Peirce (1839
1914), E. Schro¨der (1841 1902), and others, which led to a complete set
of postulates for the algebra of logic after 1900.</p>
<h4 id="augustus-de-morgan">Augustus De Morgan</h4>
<p>Among the supporters of the new view of algebra was Augustus De
Morgan, a prolific writer who had helped found the British Association
for the Advancement of Science (1831). De Morgan had been born, blind in
one eye, in India, his father having been associated with the East India
Company; he attended Trinity College, graduating as fourth wrangler. He
could not hold a fellowship at Cambridge or Oxford because he refused to
submit to the necessary religious test, despite the fact that he had
been brought up in the Church of England, in which his mother hoped he
would become a minister. De Morgan consequently was appointed, at the
early age of twenty-two, a professor of mathematics at the newly
established London University, later University College of the
University of London, where he continued to teach, except for short
periods following resignations prompted by cases of abridgement of
academic freedom. He always remained a champion of religious and
intellectual toleration, and he was equally a writer and a teacher of
exceptional ability. Many of his conundrums and witticisms were
collected in his well-known Budget of Paradoxes.</p>
<p>Peacock was something of a prophet in the development of abstract
algebra, and De Morgan was to him somewhat as Elisha was to Elijah. In
Peacock’s Algebra, the symbols were generally understood to be numbers
or magnitudes, but De Morgan would keep them abstract. He left without
meaning not only the letter that he used, but also the symbols of
operation; letters such as A, B, C might stand for virtues and vices
and1and might mean reward and punishment. De Morgan insisted that “with
one exception, no word or sign of arithmetic or algebra has one atom of
meaning throughout this chapter, the object of which is symbols and
their laws of combination, giving a symbolic algebra which may hereafter
become the grammar of a hundred distinct significant algebras.” (The
exception mentioned by De Morgan is the symbol of equality, for he
thought that in A5B, the symbols A and B must “have the same resulting
meaning, by whatever steps attained.”) This idea, expressed as early as
1830 in his Trigonometry and Double Algebra, comes close to the modern
recognition that mathematics deals with propositional functions, rather
than with propositions, but De Morgan seems not to have realized the
entirely arbitrary nature of the rules and the definitions of algebra.
He was sufficiently close to Kantian philosophy to believe that the
usual fundamental laws of algebra should apply to any algebraic system
whatsoever. He saw that in going from the “single algebra” of the real
number system to the “double algebra” of the complex numbers, the rules
of operation remain the same. And De Morgan believed that these two
forms exhaust the types of algebra that are possible and that a triple
or quadruple algebra could not be developed. In this important respect,
he was shown to be wrong by William Rowan Hamilton of Dublin. Another
mathematician of Trinity (Dublin) was George Salmon (1819 1904), who
taught both mathematics and divinity there and was the author of
excellent textbooks on conics, algebra, and analytic geometry.</p>
<h4 id="william-rowan-hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</h4>
<p>Hamilton’s father, a practicing attorney, and his mother, said to
have been intellectually gifted, both died while he was a boy, but even
before he was orphaned, the young Hamilton’s education had been
determined by an uncle who was a linguist. An extremely precocious
youngster, William read Greek, Hebrew, and Latin by the time he was
five; at the age of ten, he was acquainted with half a dozen oriental
languages. A meeting with a lightning calculator a few years later
perhaps spurred Hamilton’s already strong interest in mathematics, as
friendships with</p>
<p>W illiam Ro wan Hamilt on</p>
<p>William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge probably encouraged
him to continue to produce the bad poetry he had been writing since
boyhood. Hamilton entered Trinity College, Dublin, and while still an
undergraduate there, at the age of twenty-two, he was appointed Royal
Astronomer of Ireland, director of the Dunsink Observatory, and
professor of astronomy. In the same year, he presented to the Irish
Academy a paper on systems of rays, in which he expressed one of his
favorite themes—that space and time are “indissolubly connected with
each other.” Perhaps Hamilton here was following in algebra the lead of
Newton, who, when he had difficulty defining abstract concepts in the
method of fluxions, felt more comfortable in appealing to the notion of
time in the physical universe. Possibly, he was simply concluding that
because geometry is the science of space, and space and time are the two
aspects of sensuous intuition, algebra should be the science of
time.</p>
<p>Shortly after he presented his first paper, Hamilton’s prediction of
conical refraction in certain crystals was experimentally confirmed by
physicists. This verification of a mathematical theory assured his
reputation, and at the age of thirty, he was knighted. Two years
earlier, in 1833, he had presented a long and significant paper before
the Irish Academy, in which he introduced a formal algebra of real
number couples, the rules of combination of which are precisely those
given today for the system of complex numbers. The important rule for
multiplication of the couples is, of course,</p>
<p>ða;bÞðα;βÞ5ðaα2bβ;aβ1bαÞ;</p>
<p>and he interpreted this product as an operation involving rotation.
Here one sees the definitive view of a complex number as an ordered pair
of real numbers, an idea that had been implied in the graphical
representations of Wessel, Argand, and Gauss but that now for the first
time was made explicit.</p>
<p>Hamilton realized that his ordered pairs could be thought of as
directed entities in the plane, and he naturally tried to extend the
idea to three dimensions by going from the binary complex number a1bi to
ordered number triples a1bi1cj. The operation of addition created no
difficulty, but for ten years, he was baffled by multiplication of
n-tuples for n greater than 2. One day in 1843, as he was walking with
his wife along the Royal Canal, he had a flash of inspiration: his
difficulty would vanish if he used quadruples instead of triples and if
he abandoned the commutative law for multiplication. It had been more or
less clear that for number quadruples a1bi1cj1dk, one should take i2 5j2
5k2 521. Now Hamilton saw in addition that he should let ij5k, but
ji52k, and, similarly, jk52kj and ki5j52ik. In other respects, the laws
of operation are as in ordinary algebra.</p>
<p>Just as Lobachevsky had created a new geometry consistent within
itself, by abandoning the parallel postulate, so Hamilton created a new
algebra, also consistent within itself, by discarding the commutative
postulate for multiplication. He stopped in his walk, and, with a knife,
he cut the fundamental formula i2 5j2 5k2 5ijk on a stone of Brougham
Bridge; the same day, October 16, he asked the Royal Irish Academy for
leave to read a paper on quaternions at the next session. The key
discovery was sudden, but the discoverer had been working toward it for
some fifteen years. Hamilton, quite naturally, always regarded the
discovery of quaternions as his greatest achievement. In retrospect, it
is clear that it was not so much this particular type of algebra that
was significant, but rather the discovery of the tremendous freedom that
mathematics enjoys to build algebras that need not satisfy the
restrictions imposed by the so-called fundamental laws, which up to that
time, supported by the vague principle of permanence of form, had been
invoked without exception. For the last twenty years of his life,
Hamilton spent his energies on his favorite algebra, which he was
inclined to imbue with cosmic significance and which some British
mathematicians regarded as a kind of Leibnizian arithmetica universalis.
His Lectures on Quaternions appeared in 1853. Much of this bulky work is
devoted to applications of quaternions to geometry, differential
geometry, and physics. Of primary significance for the history of modern
algebra is the fact that Hamilton here presented a detailed theory of a
noncommutative algebraic system.</p>
<p>Among the basic concepts discussed in the book are those of vectors
and scalars. The quaternion units i, j, and k were variously described
as operators and as coordinates. Generally, Hamilton treated quaternions
as vectors and essentially showed that they form a linear vector space
over the real number field. He defined the addition of quaternions and
introduced the notion of two types of products, obtained by multiplying
a vector by a scalar or by another vector, respectively; he observed
that the first is associative, distributive, and commutative, whereas
the latter is only associative and distributive. He also discussed the
inner product (“scalar product”) of two vectors and demonstrated its
bilinearity.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Hamilton devoted himself to the preparation of the
enlarged Elements of Quaternions. This was not quite completed when he
died in 1865, but it was edited and published by his son in the
following year. It is gratifying for Americans to recall that in those
unhappy years of civil strife, the newly established National Academy of
Sciences named Sir William Rowan Hamilton its first foreign
associate.</p>
<h4 id="grassmann-and-ausdehnungslehre">Grassmann and
Ausdehnungslehre</h4>
<p>The concept of an n-dimensional vector space had received detailed
treatment in Hermann Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, published in
Germany</p>
<p>Gra s smann and Ausdehnungslehre</p>
<p>in 1844. Grassmann (1809 1877), a secondary schoolteacher, was also
led to his results by studying the geometric interpretation of negative
quantities and the addition and the multiplication of directed line
segments in two and three dimensions. He emphasized the dimension
concept and stressed the development of an abstract science of “spaces”
and “subspaces” that would include the geometry of two and three
dimensions as special cases. It is interesting to note that Grassmann,
like Hamilton, was a linguist, being a specialist in Sanskrit
literature. His father, Justus Grassmann, had belonged to the so-called
combinatorial school of German mathematicians at the beginning of the
century. This undoubtedly affected his views on the nature of
mathematics. Grassmann defined pure
mathematicsasthescienceofforms(Formenlehre),stressingthedifference
between this view and that which regards mathematics merely as the
science ofquantities. The concepts basic to his science of forms are
those of equality and combination, which he denoted by5and -,
respectively. He defined the inverse,,of -, by stating that a,b is the
form that satisfies a,b-b5b-a. The science of extension is “the abstract
foundation of geometry,” freed from spatial conceptualizations and
restriction to three dimensions. A single element generates a
one-dimensional space (einstufiges System); the set of elements derived
from a given element by a constant change gives a two-dimensional space,
corresponding to lines in geometry. Generally,</p>
<p>ifall elements ofann-dimensionaldomain are subjected toone and the
same kind of change which leads to new elements (not contained in the
domain), then the totality of the elements generated by this change and
its inverse is called a domain of dimension n11.</p>
<p>This definition was made more precise in the revised 1862 edition of
Grassmann’s Ausdehnungslehre, where he elaborated on the concepts of
linear dependence and independence of vectors and discussed subspaces,
their unions and intersections, and spanning sets. He also stated
theorems equivalent to the proposition that if S and T are two subspaces
of a vector space V, then d〔S〕1d〔T〕5d〔S,T〕1d〔S-T〕, where d〔S〕
represents the dimension of S, and S,T, S-T the union and the
intersection of S and T, respectively.</p>
<p>Grassmann laid great stress on the different kinds of multiplication
that arose in the Ausdehnungslehre. He distinguished between “inner” and
“outer” or “combinatorial” products. In the particular case treated by
Hamilton, these reduce to the latter’s scalar and vector products. Other
types of multiplication treated by Grassmann included “algebraic”
products, namely, those where ab2ba, as in common algebra, and “outer”
products, which correspond to matrix products. One could translate many
details of Grassmann’s work into the language of modern abstract vector
space theory; suffice it to say that using the basic concepts cited
previously, Grassmann showed how an n-dimensional system containing
various new operations could be established, which for special cases
reduced to more familiar mathematical structures.</p>
<p>The significance of the Ausdehnungslehre was slow to be recognized,
for the book was not only unconventional but difficult to read. One
reason was that Grassmann, like Desargues before him, used a very
unconventional terminology; more fundamental was the novelty and extreme
generality of the author’s approach to the question of extension.</p>
<p>Largely under the urging of Mo¨bius, Grassmann not only revised the
Ausdehnungslehre but also published various articles in Crelle’s
Journal, in which he summarized some of his basic results. It was
through these articles that most mathematicians became acquainted with
the substance of his work.</p>
<p>Word of the Ausdehnungslehre began to spread after the publication in
1867 of Hermann Hankel’s work on systems of complex numbers.</p>
<p>Hankel,astudentofRiemann’s,attemptedtopresentarigorousintroduction to
complex numbers. His work, which reflected study of Grassmann, referred
to Peacock, gave the first German account of Hamilton’s quaternions, and
presented a theory of “alternating numbers” equivalent to Grassmann’s
outer products. Among those whose attention was drawn to Grassmann’s
work through Hankel’s book was Felix Klein. He wrote to F. Engel in
1911:</p>
<p>As is well known, Grassmann in his Ausdehnungslehre is an affine,
rather than a projective, geometer. This became clear to me in the late
fall of 1871 and (besides the study of Mo¨bius and Hamilton and the
working out of all the impressions I had received in Paris) led to my
conception of my later Erlanger Program.</p>
<p>In England, William K. Clifford championed Grassmann’s cause; in the
United States, the Ausdehnungslehre supported the development, primarily
through the efforts of a Yale University physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs
(1839 1903), of the more limited algebra of vectors in threedimensional
space. The algebra of vectors is again a multiple algebra in which the
commutative law for multiplication fails to hold. In fact, it was proved
in 1867 by Hankel that the algebra of complex numbers is, as De Morgan
suspected, the most general algebra that is possible under the
fundamental laws of arithmetic. The Vector Analysis of Gibbs appeared in
1881 and again in 1884, and he published further articles during the
decade. These works led to a spirited and not-too-genteel controversy
with the
proponentsofquaternionsovertherelativemeritsofthetwoalgebras.In1895,a
colleague of Gibbs’s at Yale organized an International Association for
Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics, of
which the first president was a rabid supporter of quaternions. It was
not long before allied systems (such as vectors and their
generalization, tensors) for a time eclipsed quaternions, but today they
have a recognized</p>
<p>C ay le y and S y l v e s t er</p>
<p>place in algebra, as well as in quantum theory. Moreover, although
Hamilton’s name is infrequently linked with vectors, because Gibbs’s
notations came mostly from Grassmann, the chief properties of vectors
had nevertheless been worked out in Hamilton’s protracted investigations
in multiple algebras.</p>
<h4 id="cayley-and-sylvester">Cayley and Sylvester</h4>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, German mathematicians stood
head and shoulders above those of other nationalities in analysis and
geometry, with the universities of Berlin and Go¨ttingen in the lead and
with publication centering on Crelle’s Journal. Algebra, on the other
hand, was for a while almost a British monopoly, with Trinity College,

these definitions, we can think of the operations on matrices as
constituting an</p>
<p>C ay le y and S y l v e s t er</p>
<p>“algebra,” a step that was taken by Cayley and the American
mathematicians Benjamin Peirce (1809 1880) and his son Charles S. Peirce
(1839 1914). The Peirces somewhat played the role in America that
Hamilton, Grassmann, and Cayley had filled in Europe. The study of
matrix algebra and of other noncommutative algebras has everywhere been
one of the chief factors in the development of an increasingly abstract
view of algebra, especially in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Shortly after receiving his degree at Trinity, Cayley took to the law
for fourteen years; this interfered little with his mathematical
research, and he published several hundred papers during these years.
Many of the papers were in the theory of algebraic invariants, a field
in which he and his friend James Joseph Sylvester (1814 1897) were
preeminent. Cayley and Sylvester were a study in contrasts, the former
being mild and even-tempered, the latter mercurial and impatient. Both
were Cambridge men—Cayley at Trinity, Sylvester at St. John’s—but
Sylvester was ineligible for a degree because he was a Jew. For three
years following 1838, Sylvester had taught at University College,
London, where he was a colleague of his former teacher De Morgan; after
this, he accepted a professorship at the University of Virginia.
Discipline problems so upset the temperamental mathematician that he
left precipitately after only three months. When he returned to England,
he spent almost ten years in business and then turned to the study of
law, in connection with which, in 1850, he first met Cayley. The two men
were ever afterward friends and mathematicians, and, ultimately, both
left the law. In 1854, Sylvester took a position at the Royal Military
Academy at Woolwich, and in 1863, Cayley accepted the Sadlerian
professorship at Cambridge. In 1876, Sylvester had one more fling at
teaching in America, this time at the newly established Johns Hopkins
University, where he remained until he was almost seventy, when he
accepted a professorship offered him by Oxford University. In 1881,
while Sylvester was still at Johns Hopkins, Cayley accepted an
invitation to deliver there a series of lectures on Abelian and theta
functions. Although Cayley’s papers, which rival those of Euler and
Cauchy in number, are predominantly in algebra and geometry, he did also
contribute to analysis, and his only book, published in 1876, is a
Treatise on Elliptic Functions.</p>
<p>Cayley’s interests were divided, but Sylvester’s loyalty to algebra
was firm, and it is fitting that his name is attached to what is known
as Sylvester’s dialytic method in eliminating an unknown from two
polynomial equations. The device is a simple one and consists of
multiplying one or both of the two equations by the unknown quantity to
be eliminated, repeating the process if necessary until the total number
of equations is 1 greater than the number of powers of the unknown. From
this set of n11 equations, one can then eliminate all of the n powers,
thinking of each power as a different unknown. Thus, to eliminate x from
the pair of equations x2 1ax1b50 and x3 1cx2 1dx1e50, one multiplies the
first by x and then multiplies the resulting equation, and also the
second equation above, by x. Then, thinking of each of the four powers
of x as a separate unknown, the determinant</p>
<p>0 0 1 a b</p>
<p>0 1 a b 0</p>
<p>1 a b 0 0 ;</p>
<p>0 1 c d e</p>
<p>1 c d e 0</p>
<p>known as the resultant in Sylvester’s method, when equated to zero
gives the result of the elimination.</p>
<p>More important than his work in elimination was Sylvester’s
collaboration with Cayley in the development of the theory of “forms”
(or “quantics,” as Cayley preferred to call them), through which the men
came to be known as “invariant twins.” Between 1854 and 1878, Sylvester
published almost a dozen papers on forms—homogeneous polynomials in two
or more variables—and their invariants. The most important cases in
analytic geometry and physics are the quadratic forms in two and three
variables, for, when equated to a constant, these represent conics and
quadrics. In particular, the quantic or form Ax2 12Bxy1Cy2, when equated
to a nonzero constant, represents an ellipse (real or imaginary), a
parabola, or a hyperbola according as B2 2AC is less than, equal to, or
greater than zero. Moreover, if the form is transformed under a rotation
of axes about the origin into the new form Aux2 12Buxy1Cuy2, then (Bu)2
2AuCu 5B2 2AC, that is, the expression B2 2AC, known as the
characteristic of the form, is an invariant under such a transformation.
The expression A1C is another invariant. Still other important
invariants associated with the form are the roots k1 and k2 of the
characteristic equation</p>
<p>A2k B A0 2k B0 50 or 2 2 50:</p>
<p>B C 2k B0 C0 2k</p>
<p>These roots are, in fact, the coefficients of x and y in the
canonical form k1x2 1k2y2 to which the form, if not of parabolic type,
can be reduced through a rotation of axes. The effervescent Sylvester
boasted that he had discovered and developed the reduction of binary
forms to canonical form at one sitting “with a decanter of port wine to
sustain nature’s flagging energies.”</p>
<p>If we designate by M the matrix of coefficients of the form and by I
the identity matrix of order two, the characteristic equation can be
written as 9M2kI950, where the vertical lines represent the determinant
of the matrix. One of the important properties of the algebra of
matrices is that a matrix M satisfies its characteristic equation, a
result given in 1858 and</p>
<p>Line ar A s s o c iat ive Algebra s</p>
<p>known as the Hamilton-Cayley theorem. It is sometimes held that
Cayley’s algebra of matrices was an outcome of Hamilton’s algebra of
quaternions, but in 1894, Cayley specifically denied such a link. He
admired the theory of quaternions, but he asserted that his development
of matrices stemmed from that of determinants as a convenient mode of
expressing a transformation. In fact, Cayley’s publication of 1858
reflects not only the influence of Hamilton’s quaternions but Cayley’s
concern with the issues raised by the operational calculus of the day.
These two factors are also evident in an earlier publication (1845), in
which he had provided an example of a nonassociative algebra.</p>
<h4 id="linear-associative-algebras">Linear Associative Algebras</h4>
<p>It was the classification of linear associative algebras that marks
the beginning of contributions by Americans to modern algebra. Benjamin
Peirce, for many years affiliated with the U.S. Coast Survey, as well as
a professor of mathematics at his alma mater, Harvard, presented this
work to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the 1860s and had
it printed with limited circulation in 1870. It only became generally
known in a version that appeared posthumously, in the American Journal
of Mathematics in 1881, with ample notes and addenda by his son Charles
S. Peirce, who had also contributed basic ideas to the original paper.
Linear associative algebras include ordinary algebra, vector analysis,
and quaternions as special cases but are not restricted to the units 1,
i, j, k. Peirce worked out multiplication tables for 162 algebras. C. S.
Peirce continued his father’s work in this direction by showing that of
all of these algebras, there are only three in which division is
uniquely defined: ordinary real algebra, the algebra of complex numbers,
and the algebra of quaternions.</p>
<p>It was in connection with his work on linear associative algebra that
in 1870, Benjamin Peirce gave the well-known definition “Mathematics is
the science which draws necessary conclusions.” His son was in
wholehearted agreement with this view, as a result of Boole’s influence,
but he stressed that mathematics and logic are not the same.
“Mathematics is purely hypothetical: it produces nothing but conditional
propositions. Logic, on the contrary, is categorical in its assertions.”
This distinction was to be argued further throughout the mathematical
world in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>In England, somewhat similar ideas were pursued by William Kingdon
Clifford (1845 1879), yet another Trinity graduate, whose brilliant
work, like that of an earlier Trinity graduate, Roger Cotes, was cut
short by premature death in his thirty-fourth year. Clifford was
extraordinary in several respects. For one thing, he was a gymnast who
could pull himself up on the bar with either hand—a most unusual feat
for anyone and especially almost unheard of for one who graduated as
second wrangler. Also, like the Oxford mathematician C. L. Dodgson (1832
1898), better known as Lewis Carroll, the author of Alice in Wonderland,
Clifford composed The Little People, a collection of tales for children.
In 1870, Clifford wrote a paper, “On the Space-Theory of Matter,” in
which he showed himself to be a staunch British supporter of the
non-Euclidean geometry of Lobachevsky and Riemann. In algebra, Clifford
also espoused the newer views, and his name is perpetuated today in the
socalled Clifford algebras, of which octonions or biquaternions are
special cases. These noncommutative algebras were used by Clifford to
study motions in non-Euclidean spaces, certain manifolds of which are
known as spaces of Clifford and Klein. How different was the progressive
British mathematics of the latter part of the nineteenth century from
the stultifyingly conservative views at the opening of the century!</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-geometry">Algebraic Geometry</h4>
<p>In 1882, two works appeared that, in hindsight, foreshadowed
important twentieth-century trends. One was a deep study by Leopold
Kronecker dealing with an arithmetic theory of algebraic quantities.
This difficult paper had a pronounced impact on algebraists and number
theorists at the turn of the century. The other work was a joint memoir
by Richard Dedekind(1831 1916) and Heinrich Weber (1842 1913) on the
theory of algebraic functions. Dedekind and Weber used the algebraic
theory developed by the former in his treatment of algebraic numbers to
strip Riemann’s work on function theory from its geometric
underpinnings. This allowed them to define parts of a Riemann surface
algebraically in such a way that it could be considered invariant with
respect to an algebraic function field. The purely algebraic approach
opened up an entirely new avenue for post-Riemannian algebraic geometry;
indeed, it turned out to be one of the most fruitful paths pursued by
twentieth-century investigators. Almost half a century would pass before
this became apparent, however.</p>
<h4 id="algebraic-and-arithmetic-integers">Algebraic and Arithmetic
Integers</h4>
<p>The work of Galois had been important not only in making the abstract
notion of group fundamental in the theory of equations, but also in
leading, through the contributions of Dedekind, Kronecker, and Ernst
Eduard Kummer, to what may be called an arithmetical approach to
algebra, somewhat akin to the arithmetization of analysis. This means
the development of a careful postulational treatment of algebraic
structure in terms of various number fields. The concept of field was
implicit in work by Abel and Galois, but in 1879, Dedekind seems to have
been the first one to give</p>
<p>A lgebraic and Ar i t hme t ic Int e ger s</p>
<p>an explicit definition of a number field—a set of numbers that form
an Abelian group with respect to addition and with respect to
multiplication (except for the inverse of zero) and for which
multiplication distributes over addition. Simple examples are the system
of rational numbers, the real number system, and the complex number
field. In 1881, Kronecker gave other instances through his domains of
rationality. The set of numbers of the form a1bp2, where a and b are
rational, form a field, as is easily verified. In this case, the number
of elements in the field is infinite. A field with a finite number of
elements is known as a Galois field, and a simple instance of this is
the field of integers modulo 5 (or any prime).</p>
<p>The concern for structure and the rise of new algebras, especially
during the second half of the nineteenth century, led to broad
generalizations about number and arithmetic. We have already noted that
Gauss extended the idea of integer through the study of Gaussian
integers of the form a1bi, where a and b are integers. Dedekind
generalized further in the theory of “algebraic integers”—numbers
satisfying a polynomial equation with integral coefficients that have
leading coefficient unity. Such systems of “integers” do not, of course,
form a field, for inverses under multiplication are lacking. They do
have something in common, in that they satisfy the other requirements
for a number field; they are thus said to form an “integral domain.”
Such generalizations of the word
“integer”are,however,boughtataprice—thelossofuniquefactorization.
Therefore, Dedekind, adapting ideas developed by the contemporary
mathematician Ernst Eduard Kummer (1810 1893), introduced into
arithmetic the concept of an “ideal.”</p>
<p>A set of elements is said to form a ring if (1) it is an Abelian
group with respect to addition, (2) the set is closed under
multiplication, and (3) multiplication is associative and is
distributive over addition. (Hence, a ring that is commutative under
multiplication has a unit element and has no divisors of zero is an
integral domain.) An ideal, then, is a subset I of elements of a ring R
that (1) form an additive group and (2) are such that whenever x belongs
to R and y belongs to I, then xy belong to I. The set of even integers,
for example, is an ideal in the ring of integers. It turns out that in
the ring (or integral domain) R of algebraic integers, any ideal I of R
can be represented uniquely (except for the order of the factors) as a
product of prime ideals. That is, uniqueness of factorization can be
saved through the theory of ideals.</p>
<p>Kummer earned his doctorate at the University of Halle. After about a
dozen years of teaching in gymnasia, he succeeded Dirichlet at Berlin
when, in 1855, the latter became Gauss’s successor at Go¨ttingen; Kummer
remained there until his retirement in 1883. Shortly after earning his
degree, Kummer had become interested in Fermat’s Last Theorem. Kummer
was able to prove the theorem for a large class of exponents, but a
general proof eluded him. The stumbling block seems to have been the
fact that in the factoring of xn 1yn, through the solution of xn 1yn 50
for x in terms of y, the algebraic integers, or roots of the equation,
do not necessarily satisfy the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic; that
is, they are not uniquely factorable. The result was that although he
failed to solve Fermat’s theorem, in the attempt to do so he created, in
a sense, a new arithmetic. This was a theory, not of our ideals, but of
devices that he called “ideal complex numbers.” One of the lessons that
the history of mathematics teaches is that the search for solutions to
unsolved problems, whether solvable or unsolvable, invariably leads to
important discoveries along the way.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s concern with algebra goes back to the 1850s, when he
attended Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory in Go¨ttingen and pursued
intensive studies of Galois theory. His notes of the period show that he
developed an abstract treatment of elementary group theory at that time.
After Dirichlet’s death, Dedekind was charged with publishing
Dirichlet’s lectures on number theory. In appendices to that work, he
presented a number of results of his own. Best known among these was his
ideal theory, various versions of which can be compared in the
successive editions of Dirichlet-Dedekind. The most axiomatic approach,
which appeared in the 1894 edition, was the one that especially
influenced Emmy Noether and her school of algebraists in the 1920s.</p>
<p>In 1897 and 1900, Dedekind also published two memoirs on a new
structure he called a “dual group.” In the first of these memoirs, the
modern reader easily recognizes a set of axioms for a lattice. In the
second, devoted to a study of the free modular lattice with three
generators, Dedekind showed that a lattice forms a partially ordered
set. Here the reader also finds the important concepts of a covering
relation and of the dimension of a lattice. Dedekind also utilized chain
conditions.</p>
<p>During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, numerous other
abstract and often axiomatic treatments of groups and fields were
published. Several of these were instigated by Dedekind; this is true
particularly of the work of Heinrich Weber, whom Dedekind interested in
algebra.</p>
<h4 id="axioms-of-arithmetic">Axioms of Arithmetic</h4>
<p>Mathematics has often been likened to a tree, for it grows through an
ever more widely spreading and branching structure above ground, while,
at the same time, it sinks its roots ever deeper and wider in the search
for a firm foundation. This double growth was especially characteristic
of the development of analysis in the nineteenth century, for the rapid
expansion of the theory of functions had been accompanied by the
rigorous arithmetization of the subject from Bolzano to Weierstrass. In
algebra, the nineteenth century had been more notable for new
developments than for attention to foundations, and Peacock’s efforts to
provide a sound</p>
<p>A x ioms of Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>basis were feeble in comparison with the precision of Bolzano in
analysis. During the closing years of the century, however, there were
several efforts to provide stronger roots for algebra. The complex
number system is defined in terms of the real numbers, which are
explained as classes of rational numbers, which in turn are ordered
pairs of integers. But what, after all, are the integers? Everyone
thinks that he or she knows, for example, what the number 3 is—until he
or she tries to define or explain it—and the idea of equality of
integers is assumed to be obvious. Not satisfied to leave the basic
concepts of arithmetic, hence of algebra, in so vague a state, the
German logician and mathematician F.L.G. Frege (1848 1925) was led to
his well-known definition of a cardinal number. The basis for his views
came from the theory of sets of Boole and Cantor. It will be recalled
that Cantor had regarded two infinite sets as having the same “power” if
the elements of the sets can be put into one-to-one correspondence.
Frege saw that this idea of the correspondence of elements is also basic
in the notion of equality of integers. Two finite sets are said to have
the same cardinal number—that is, to be equal—if the elements in either
class can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the elements in the
other. If, then, one were to begin with an initial set, such as the set
of fingers on the normal human hand, and were to form the much more
comprehensive set of all sets the elements of which can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the elements of the initial set, then
this set of all such sets would constitute a cardinal number, in this
case the number 5. More generally, Frege’s definition of the cardinal
number of a given class, whether finite or infinite, is the class of all
classes that are similar to the given class (where by “similar,” one
means that the elements of the two classes in question can be placed in
one-to-one correspondence).</p>
<p>Frege’s definition of a cardinal number appeared in 1884 in a
wellknown book, Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik (The Foundations of
Arithmetic), and fromthe definition, he derived the properties of the
whole numbers that are familiar in grade-school arithmetic. During the
succeeding years, Frege amplified his views in the two-volume
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic), the first volume
of which appeared in 1893 and the second, ten years later. As the second
volume was in press, however, Frege received a letter from Bertrand
Russell informing him of the paradox concerning the class of all classes
that are not members of themselves. Frege, recognizing the implication
for his definition of cardinal numbers and the entire work he had just
completed, appended a note to his volume commenting on the blow to a
scholar when the foundation of an entire structure he has established is
pulled out from underneath.</p>
<p>Frege undertook to derive the concepts of arithmetic from those of
formal logic, for he disagreed with the assertion of C. S. Peirce that
mathematics and logic are clearly distinct. Frege had been educated at
the universities of Jena and Go¨ttingen, and he taught at Jena during a
long career. Nevertheless, his program did not meet with much response
until it was undertaken independently early in the twentieth century by
Bertrand Russell, when it became one of the chief goals of
mathematicians. Frege was keenly disappointed by the poor reception of
his work, but the fault lay in part in the excessively novel and
philosophical form in which the results were cast. History shows that
novelty in ideas is more readily accepted if couched in a relatively
conventional form.</p>
<p>Italy had taken a somewhat less active part in the development of
abstract algebra than had France, Germany, and England, but during the
closing years of the nineteenth century, there were Italian
mathematicians who took a deep interest in mathematical logic. Best
known of these was Giuseppe Peano (1858 1932), whose name is recalled
today in connection with the Peano axioms on which so many rigorous
constructions of algebra and analysis depend. His aim was similar to
that of Frege, but it was at the same time more ambitious and yet more
down to earth. He hoped, in his Formulaire de mathe´matiques (1894 et
seq.), to develop a formalized language that should contain not only
mathematical logic but all of the most important branches of
mathematics. That his program attracted a large circle of collaborators
and disciples resulted in part from his avoidance of metaphysical
language and from his felicitous choice of symbols—such as A (belongs to
the class of), ,(logical sum or union),-(logical product or
intersection), and</p>
<p>(contains)—many of which are used even today. For his foundations of
arithmetic, he chose three primitive concepts: zero, number (that is,
nonnegative whole number), and the relationship “is the successor of,”
satisfying five postulates:</p>
<p>1.Zero is a number.</p>
<p>2.If a is a number, the successor of a is a number.</p>
<p>3.Zero is not the successor of a number.</p>
<p>4.Two numbers of which the successors are equal are
themselvesequal.</p>
<p>5.If a set S of numbers contains zero and also the successor of every
number in S, then every number is in S.</p>
<p>The last requirement is, of course, the axiom of induction. The Peano
axioms, first formulated in 1889 in Arithmetices principia nova methodo
exposita, represent the most striking attempt of the century to reduce
common arithmetic—hence, ultimately, most of mathematics—to the stark
essentials of formal symbolism. (He expressed the postulates in symbols,
rather than in the words that we have used.) Here the postulational
method attained a new height of precision, with no ambiguity of meaning
and no concealed assumptions. Peano also spent much effort in</p>
<p>A x ioms of Ar i t hme t ic</p>
<p>the development of symbolic logic, a favorite pursuit of the
twentieth century.</p>
<p>A further contribution by Peano to mathematics should perhaps be
mentioned, inasmuch as it represented one of the disquieting discoveries
of the time. The nineteenth century had opened with a recognition that
curves and functions need not be of the well-behaved type that had
theretofore preempted the field, and in 1890, Peano showed how
thoroughly mathematics could outrage common sense when he constructed
continuous space-filling curves, that is, curves given by parametric
equations x5f(t), y5g(t), where f and g are continuous real functions in
the interval 0#t#1, the points of which completely fill the unit square
0#x#1, 0#y#1. This paradox, of course, is all of a piece with Cantor’s
discovery that there are no more points in a unit square than in a unit
line segment, and it was among the factors that caused the following
century to devote much more attention to the basic structure of
mathematics. In 1903, Peano himself, however, was distracted by his
invention of the international language that he called “Interlingua” or
“Latino sine flexione,” with vocabulary drawn from Latin, French,
English, and German. This movement turned out to be far more ephemeral
than his axiomatic structure in arithmetic.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>It is the simple hypotheses of which one must be most wary; because
these are the ones that have the most chances of passing unnoticed.</p>
<p>Poincare´</p>
<p>Berlin and G˛ttingen at Midcentury</p>
<p>Analysis, the study of infinite processes, had been understood by
Newton and Leibniz to be concerned with continuous magnitudes, such as
lengths, areas, velocities, and accelerations, whereas the theory of
numbers has as its domain the discrete set of natural numbers. We have
nevertheless seen that Bolzano tried to give purely arithmetic proofs of
propositions, such as the location theorem in elementary algebra, that
seemed to depend on properties of continuous functions, and Plu¨cker had
thoroughly arithmetized analytic geometry. The theory of groups had
originally been concerned with discrete sets of elements, but Klein
envisioned a unification of both discrete and continuous aspects of
mathematics under the group concept. The nineteenth century was indeed a
period of correlation in mathematics. The geometric interpretation of
analysis and algebra was one aspect of this tendency; the introduction
of analytic techniques in</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>R ie mann in G ˛t t ingen</p>
<p>number theory was another. Toward the end of the century, the
strongest current was that of arithmetization; it affected algebra,
geometry, and analysis.</p>
<p>In 1855, Dirichlet succeeded Gauss in Gottingen. He left in place,
in¨ Berlin, a tradition of lectures on the applications of analysis to
physical problems and number theory. He also left a small group of his
and Jacobi’s friends and students, who continued to influence
mathematics at the academy, in the Journal fu¨r die reine und angewandte
Mathematik, and at the university. In Gottingen, mathematical lectures
were less solidly¨ established. As already noted, Gauss’s limited
teaching had usually emphasized subjects such as the method of least
squares that would be useful to his observatory assistants. Most
mathematics proper was taught by one lecturer, Moritz Stern (1807 1894).
Dirichlet sought to emphasize the “true” Gaussian legacy with lectures
on number theory and potential theory.</p>
<p>There were two young men in Gottingen who were to be profoundly¨
influenced by Dirichlet, although they differed greatly in personality
and mathematical orientation. One was Richard Dedekind; the other,
Bernhard Riemann. When Dirichlet died unexpectedly in 1859, it was
Riemann who succeeded him.</p>
<p>Riemann in G˛ttingen</p>
<p>When Riemann became a professor in Gottingen, he was no stranger to¨
that university. He had matriculated there in 1846, spent several
semesters in Berlin to get his mathematical training from Jacobi and
Dirichlet, then returned to Gottingen, obtained good training in physics
from¨ Wilhelm Weber, assisted Weber, obtained his doctoral degree, and
was appointed lecturer (privatdozent) in 1854. His research, as well as
his career, was split between mathematics and physics. By the time he
succeeded Dirichlet, he had published five memoirs; two of these dealt
with problems in physics. A similar division characterized his later
work, yet, conceptually, it is not the division but the commonality of
many concepts that predominates. Riemann was a many-sided mathematician
with a fertile mind, contributing to geometry, the theory of numbers,
and analysis. Having previously touched on some of his geometric and
function-theoretic work, we shall here cite only the example of his
shortest and possibly most famous paper before proceeding to note his
influence on mathematical physics.</p>
<p>Euler had noted connections between prime number theory and the
series</p>
<p>1 1 1 1</p>
<p>s 1 s 1 s 1 1 s 1 ;</p>
<p>1 2 3 n</p>
<p>where s is an integer—a special case of the Dirichlet series. Riemann
studied the same series for s a complex variable, the sum of the series
defining a function ζðsÞ, which has since been known as Riemann’s zeta
function. One of the tantalizing suggestions that mathematicians have
not yet been able to prove or disprove is the famous Riemann conjecture
that all of the imaginary zeros s5σ1iτ of the zeta function have real
part σ5.</p>
<p>In analysis, Riemann is recalled for his part in the refinement of
the definition of the integral, for emphasis on the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, and for the Riemann surfaces. These surfaces are an ingenious
scheme for uniformizing a function, that is, representing a one-toone
mapping of a complex function that in the ordinary Gaussian plane would
be multivalued. Here we see the most striking aspect of Riemann’s work—a
strongly intuitive and geometric background in analysis that contrasts
sharply with the arithmetizing tendencies of the Weierstrassian school.
His approach has been called “a method of discovery,” whereas that of
Weierstrass was “a method of demonstration.” His results were so
significant that Bertrand Russell described him as “logically the
immediate predecessor of Einstein.” It was Riemann’s intuitive genius in
physics and mathematics that produced such concepts as that of the
curvature of a Riemannian space or manifold, without which the theory of
general relativity could not have been formulated.</p>
<h4 id="mathematical-physics-in-germany">Mathematical Physics in
Germany</h4>
<p>There had been several centers of growing activity in mathematical
physics in Germany before Riemann. Beginning in the 1830s, Dirichlet had
introduced the techniques of Fourier and the results of his great French
contemporaries to a large group of students in mathematics and physics
in Berlin. Dirichlet interacted with the Berlin physicists; he had been
a friend of Wilhelm Weber’s years before they became colleagues in
Gottingen. Similarly, in K¨ onigsberg, Jacobi had worked¨ closely with
the mathematical physicist Franz Neumann (1798 1895) in research and
teaching. In Leipzig, the new analysis was not yet well represented. but
when the Weber brothers felt the need to consult their mathematical
colleagues, there were no barriers. When Weber involved Riemann in his
electrodynamic investigations in Gottingen, the subject¨ had also been
dealt with in Konigsberg; both German traditions drew¨ on the pioneering
work of Andre-Marie Ampe´ `re and Poisson. When Riemann initiated his
influential study of the propagation of sound waves, he elaborated on a
topic that Poisson had furthered in the early years of the century and
on which Dirichlet had frequently lectured in Berlin. It is an important
chapter in the history of the wave equation.</p>
<p>Mat he mat ic al P hy s ic s in Engli s h Sp e aking Co untr ie s</p>
<p>Riemann’s approach involved dealing with a second-order linear
differential equation in two variables and finding a “characteristic”
function that satisfied a certain adjoint partial differential equation.
Riemann’s technique has been widely adopted for hyperbolic
equations.</p>
<p>PaulDuBoisReymond(1831 1889),whohadobtainedhisdoctoratein Berlin just
before Dirichlet’s departure, built on Riemann’s work in obtaining a
generalization of Green’s theorem. Hermann Helmholtz (1821 1894), who
came to mathematical physics from a background in physiology, overlapped
with Riemann in acoustical studies. Many of his notable contributions to
the study of sound were included in his popular work On the Sensations
of Tone. The reduced wave equation
Δw1k2w50isoftencalledthe“Helmholtzequation”becausehewasthe first to
tackle the issue of finding a general solution. The physicist Gustav
Kirchhoff (1824 1887), who was a contemporary of these men, obtained
further significant results in the study of partial differential
equations, particularly the wave equation.</p>
<h4 id="mathematical-physics-in-english-speaking-countries">Mathematical
Physics in English-Speaking Countries</h4>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, a number of English-speaking
men promoted mathematical physics in Great Britain and elsewhere. The
earliest significant nineteenth-century contributions to mathematical
physics across the channel were those of the Irishman William Rowan
Hamilton. When he initiated his studies on dynamics in the 1830s, he
drew heavily on concepts he had developed while establishing a
mathematical theory of optics in the late 1820s. Key to his method was
the introduction of variational principles into the treatment of certain
partial differential equations. He built on work by Lagrange and Poisson
but utilized physical principles established earlier. Jacobi, working
out his own dynamics in the 1830s, recast Hamilton’s innovative ideas
and called attention to them in the context of his own theory. The
result is now known as the Hamilton-Jacobi theory. Hamilton’s primary
champion was the Scottish physicist Peter Guthrie Tait (1831 1901).
Among Tait’s mathematical contributions are early studies of knots; in
this, he followed a little-known line of research by Gauss and Listing,
prompted by electrodynamic investigations. His name came to be known to
generations in linkage with that of William Thomson through the classic
Treatise on Natural Philosophy, usually simply referred to as “T and T”
or “T and Tu.” This work, which first appeared in 1867, went through
several editions. Although it does not make for light reading, nearly a
century after its first publication it reappeared as a paperback with
the title Principles of Mechanics and Dynamics.</p>
<p>William Thomson, Tait’s coauthor, is better known by his title as
Lord Kelvin. Born in Belfast, raised in Glasgow, and educated in
Cambridge, he discovered Fourier’s book on heat theory as an adolescent
and shortly thereafter was given a copy of Green’s rare 1828 Essay.
Thomson not only studied Green’s work himself but made it known on the
Continent. His earliest mathematical contributions of the 1840s were
furthered through communication with Liouville, in whose Journal they
appeared. They relate to the method of inversion and to Dirichlet’s
principle, both treated with regard to electricity and magnetism.
Subsequent research tended to be more physically and experimentally
oriented.</p>
<p>Thomson was a contemporary of an English physicist whose name is
familiar to every student of advanced calculus: George Gabriel Stokes
(1819 1903). Stokes graduated from Cambridge in 1841; like Thomson, he
had been senior wrangler. Much of his research was done before 1850;
during the second part of the century, he held the Lucasian chair of
mathematics at Cambridge and was an active member of the Royal Society,
whose Copley medal he had won for a major study on optics in the early
fifties. William Thomson knew the theorem that bears Stokes’s name in
1850, although it first appeared in print in the form of an exam
question in 1854. Stokes proved the theorem when Thomson sent it to him
in 1850 and seems to have chosen it as an examination question.</p>
<p>One of those taking this examination in 1854 was James Clerk Maxwell
(1831 1879). Best known for his stunningly successful derivation, in
1864, of the electromagnetic wave equations, he was influential in
urging on mathematicians and physicists the use of vectors. A friend of
Tait’s, he, too, admired Hamilton. Yet he avoided becoming heavily
involved in the notational quarrels surrounding many advocates of the
use of vector analysis.</p>
<p>Before leaving the English-speaking analysts of the period, we should
note some important contributions from those studying celestial
mechanics. As previously noted, nineteenth-century theoretical
astronomers had two great guidebooks: one was Laplace’s Mecanique
celeste´ , the other Gauss’s Theoria motus. The translation of Laplace’s
work into English brought to European attention an American, Nathaniel
Bowditch (1773 1838), in the 1830s. The subject was one in which
American analysts were repeatedly to make their mark, the most notable
nineteenth-century American contribution being that of George William
Hill (1838 1914). In 1877 1878, Hill published two important papers on
lunar theory, in which he established the theory of linear differential
equations with periodic coefficients. After Henri Poincare noted the´
importance of this work in 1885, the first of these papers was
republished in Mittag-Leffler’s Acta Mathematica, and attention was
drawn to the recently established American Journal of Mathematics, the
first volume of which had contained Hill’s other paper.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the Astronomer Royal of England</p>
<p>G. B. Airy (1801 1892) made numerous contributions to the study
of</p>
<p>Weier s tra s s and Student s</p>
<p>series and integrals, which, although they belong to the age of Gauss
and Cauchy, were important in the effect they had on England’s
midcentury analysts and mathematical physicists. For example, in his
optical studies in 1850, Stokes was confronted with an integral that
Airy had used to describe a certain situation involving diffraction.
Stokes set up a differential equation having Airy’s integral as a
special solution and solved the equation by “semiconvergent” series.
This was one of the early examples of work that subsequently led to the
more general theory of such series established by T.-J. Stieltjes (1856
1894).</p>
<h4 id="weierstrass-and-students">Weierstrass and Students</h4>
<p>The leading analyst in Berlin in the second half of the nineteenth
century was Karl Weierstrass (1815 1897). Weierstrass prepared himself
at Mu¨nster for secondary-school teaching, where an instructor,
Christoph Gudermann (1798 1851), took Weierstrass under his wing.</p>
<p>Gudermann was especially interested in elliptic and hyperbolic
functions; his name is still recalled in the Gudermannian: If u is a
function of x satisfying the equation tan u5sinhx, then u is known as
the Gudermannian of x, written as u5gd x. More important to mathematics
than this minor contribution were the time and inspiration the teacher
gave to his student Karl Weierstrass, who was destined in turn to become
the greatest mathematics teacher of the mid-nineteenth century—at least,
as measured in terms of the number of successful research workers he
produced. Gudermann had impressed on the young Weierstrass what a useful
tool the power series representation of a function was, and it was in
this connection that Weierstrass produced his greatest work, following
in the footsteps of Abel.</p>
<p>Weierstrass earned his teacher’s certificate at the late age of
twenty-six, and for more than a dozen years, he taught at various
secondary schools. In 1854, however, a paper on Abelian functions,
appearing in Crelle’s Journal, brought him such recognition that shortly
thereafter he was offered and he accepted a professorship at the
University of Berlin. Weierstrass was then almost forty, making him a
striking exception to the common notion that a great mathematician must
make his mark early in life.</p>
<p>It had been generally assumed, before the middle of the nineteenth
century, that if an infinite series converges for some interval to a
continuous and differentiable function f(x), then a second series
obtained by differentiating the original series, term by term,
necessarily will converge, for the same interval, to fu(x). Several
mathematicians showed that this is not necessarily the case and that
term-by-term differentiation can be trusted only if the series is
uniformly convergent for the interval—that is, if a single N can be
found such that for every value of x in the interval the partial sums
Sn(x) will differ from the sum S(x) of the series by less than a given ε
for all n.N. Weierstrass showed that for a uniformly convergent series,
term-by-term integration was also permissible. In the matter of uniform
convergence, Weierstrass was far from alone, for the concept was hit on
independently at about the same time by at least three other men—Cauchy
in France (perhaps by 1853), Stokes at Cambridge (in 1847), and P. L. V.
Seidel (1821 1896) in Germany (in 1848). H. E. Heine (1821 1881),
previously close to Dirichlet and Riemann, in 1870 proved that the
Fourier series development of a continuous function is unique if one
imposes the condition that it be uniformly convergent. Yet perhaps no
one is more deserving to be known as the father of the critical movement
in analysis than is Weierstrass. From 1857 until his retirement in 1890,
he urged a generation of students to use infinite series representations
with care.</p>
<p>One of Weierstrass’s important contributions to analysis is known as
analytic continuation. Weierstrass had shown that the infinite power
series representation of a function f(x), about a point Pl in the
complex plane, converges at all points within a circle C1 whose center
is P1 and which passes through the nearest singularity. If, now, one
expands the same function about a second point P2 other than P1 but
within C1, this series will be convergent within a circle C2 having P2
as the center and passing through the singularity nearest to P2. This
circle may include points outside C1; hence, one has extended the area
of the plane within which f(x) is defined analytically by a power
series; the process can be continued with still other circles.
Weierstrass therefore defined an analytic function as one power series
together with all of those that are obtainable from it by analytic
continuation. The importance of work such as that of Weierstrass is felt
particularly in mathematical physics, in which solutions of differential
equations are rarely found in any form other than as an infinite
series.</p>
<p>Weierstrass’s influence was exerted through his students as much as
through his own lectures and publications. In the field of differential
equations, this brings us to Lazarus Fuchs (1833 1902). Building on work
by the French mathematicians Briot (1817 1882) and Bouquet (1819 1885),
and on Riemann’s memoir about the hypergeometric equation, Fuchs
initiated the systematic study of regular singularities of linear
ordinary differential equations in the complex domain. His immediate
motivation came from lectures on Abelian functions that Weierstrass had
given in 1863. Fuchs’s work was sharpened by G. Frobenius (1849 1917) at
Berlin and served as a takeoff point for Poincare.´</p>
<p>Another Weierstrass student who made major contributions to complex
analysis was H. A. Schwarz (1848 1921). Schwarz was interested in
mapping questions and was especially affected by Weierstrass’s criticism
of Riemann’s use of the Dirichlet principle. Riemann’s famous mapping
theorem, translated into a later terminology, states that “there</p>
<p>T he Ar i t hme t iz at ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>exists one and only one conformal mapping of a given bounded simply
connected surface onto a second one, for which the images of one
interior point and one boundary point are prescribed” (Birkhoff 1973,
p. 47). Weierstrass noted that Riemann’s proof was unacceptable because
it extended the use of Dirichlet’s principle beyond the limitations that
would assure the existence of a minimizing integral. Schwarz thereupon
set out to find specific instances for which he could validate the
mapping theorem. This search led him to two very useful tools, one known
as his “reflection principle,” the other as his “alternating process.”
He was able to obtain a number of specific mappings; for example, he
could map a simply connected plane region onto a circle, but he could
not achieve the hoped-for broader generalization.</p>
<p>Yet another follower of Weierstrass who was to assume international
importance because of his journal and his support of mathematicians from
different parts of the world was the Swede Gosta Mittag-Leffler¨ (1846
1927). Mittag-Leffler had studied with Charles Hermite (1822</p>
<ol start="1901" type="1">
<li>in Paris and Ernst Christian Julius Schering (1824 1897) in
Gottingen before he came to Berlin. He made independent contributions¨
to complex function theory. More important, he founded the journal Acta
Mathematica, was a friend of Weierstrass’s and Hermite’s, exchanged
information with mathematicians around the world, and supported numerous
mathematicians directly, as well as through his connections in Sweden
and elsewhere. Thus, he played an important role in the lives of such
diverse individuals as Sofia Kovalevskaya, Henri Poincare, and´ Georg
Cantor.</li>
</ol>
<p>TheArithmetization of Analysis</p>
<p>Note that 1872 was a red-letter year not only in geometry but, more
particularly, in analysis. In that year, crucial contributions toward
the arithmetization of analysis were made by no fewer than five
mathematicians,one French, the others German. The Frenchman was H. C. R.
(Charles) Meray (1835´ 1911) of Burgundy; the four Germans were Karl
Weierstrass of Berlin, H. E. Heine of Halle, Georg Cantor</p>
<p>(1845 1918), also of Halle, and J. W. R. Dedekind (1831 1916) of
Braunschweig. These men, in a sense, represented the climax in half a
century of investigation into the nature of function and number that had
begun in 1822 with Fourier’s theory of heat and with an attempt made in
that year by Martin Ohm (1792 1872) to reduce all of analysis to
arithmetic in Versuch eines vollsta¨ndig konsequenten Systems der
Mathematik. There were two chief causes of uneasiness in this fifty-year
interval. One was the lack of confidence in operations performed on
infinite series. It was not even clear whether an infinite series of
functions—of powers or of sines and cosines, for example—always
converges to the function from which it was derived. A second cause for
concern was occasioned by the lack of any definition of the phrase “real
number” that lay at the very heart of the arithmetization program. By
1817, Bolzano had been so fully aware of the need for rigor in analysis
that Klein referred to him as the “father of arithmetization,” but
Bolzano had been less influential than Cauchy, whose analysis was still
encumbered with geometric intuition. Even Bolzano’s continuous
nondifferentiable function of about 1830 was overlooked by successors,
and the example of such a function given by Weierstrass (in classroom
lectures in 1861 and in a paper to the Berlin Academy in 1872) was
generally thought to be the first illustration of it.</p>
<p>Riemann, meanwhile, had exhibited a function f(x) that is
discontinuous at infinitely many points in an interval and yet the
integral of which exists and defines a continuous function F(x) that,
for the infinity of points in question, fails to have a derivative.
Riemann’s function is, in a sense, less pathological than are those of
Bolzano and Weierstrass, but it made clear that the integral required a
more careful definition than that of Cauchy, which had been guided
largely by geometric feeling for the area under a curve. The present-day
definition of the definite integral over an interval in terms of upper
and lower sums is generally known as the Riemann integral, in honor of
the man who gave necessary and sufficient conditions that a bounded
function be integrable. The Dirichlet function, for instance, does not
have a Riemann integral for any interval. Still more general definitions
of the integral, with weaker conditions on the function, were proposed
in the next century, but the definition of the integral used in most
undergraduate courses in the calculus is still that of Riemann.</p>
<p>There was a gap of some fifty years between the work of Bolzano and
that of Weierstrass, but the unity of effort in this half century and
the need to rediscover Bolzano’s work were such that there is a
celebrated theorem that bears the name of both men, the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem: A bounded set S containing infinitely many
elements (such as points or numbers) contains at least one limit point.
Although this theorem was proved by Bolzano and apparently was also
known to Cauchy, it was the work of Weierstrass that made it familiar to
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Skepticism about Fourier’s series had been expressed by Lagrange, but
Cauchy, in 1823, thought he had proved the convergence of the general
Fourier series. Dirichlet had shown that Cauchy’s proof was inadequate
and had provided sufficient conditions for the convergence. It was in
seeking to liberalize Dirichlet’s conditions for the convergence of a
Fourier series that Riemann developed his definition of the Riemann
integral; in this connection, he showed that a function f(x) may be
integrable in an interval without being representable by a Fourier
series. It was the study of infinite trigonometric series that also led
to Cantor’s theory of sets, to be described later.</p>
<p>T he Ar i t hme t iz at ion of A nal y s i s</p>
<p>Only a year after the critical year 1872, a young man who had given
promise of significant contributions to both mathematics and its history
died at the early age of thirty-four. This was Hermann Hankel (1839
1873), a student of Riemann’s and a professor of mathematics at Leipzig.
In 1867, he had published a book, Theorie der komplexen Zahlensysteme,
in which he pointed out that “the condition for erecting a universal
arithmetic is … a purely intellectual mathematics, one detached from all
perceptions.” We have seen that the revolution in geometry took place
when Gauss, Lobachevsky, and Bolyai freed themselves from preconceptions
of space. In somewhat the same sense, the thoroughgoing arithmetization
of analysis became possible only when, as Hankel foresaw, mathematicians
understood that the real numbers are to be viewed as “intellectual
structures,” rather than as intuitively given magnitudes inherited from
Euclid’s geometry. Hankel’s view was not really new; a generation of
algebraists, especially in Great Britain, had been developing a
universal arithmetic and multiple algebras. The implications for
analysis, however, had not been widely recognized. During the early
1830s, Bolzano had made an attempt to develop a theory of real numbers
as limits of rational number sequences, but this had gone unnoticed and
unpublished until 1962. Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805 1865) perhaps
had felt some such need, but his appeal to time, rather than to space,
was a change in language, although not in logical form, from the usual
geometric background. The crux of the matter was first effectively
seized on and published by the quintet of 1872 mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Meray was prompt to present his thoughts, for as early as 1869 he
had´ published an article calling attention to a serious lapse in
reasoning of which mathematicians from the time of Cauchy had been
guilty.</p>
<p>Essentially, the petitio principii consisted of defining the limit of
a sequence as a real number and then, in turn, defining a real number as
a limit of a sequence (of rational numbers). It will be recalled that
Bolzano and Cauchy had attempted to prove that a sequence that
“converges within itself”—one for which Sn1p differs from Sn (for a
given integer p and for n sufficiently large) by less than any assigned
magnitude ε, also converges in the sense of external relations to a real
number S, the limit of the sequence. Meray, in his´ Nouveau precis
d’analyse infinit´ esimale´ of 1872, cut the Gordian knot by not
invoking the external condition of convergence or the real number S.
Using only the Bolzano-Cauchy criterion, where n, p, and ε are rational
numbers, convergence can be described without reference to irrational
numbers. In a broad sense, he regarded a converging sequence as
determining either a rational number as a limit or a “fictitious number”
as a “fictitious limit.” These “fictitious numbers” can, he showed, be
ordered, and, in essence, they are what we know as the irrational
numbers. Meray was somewhat vague as to whether his´ converging sequence
is the number. If it is, as seems to be implied, then his theory is
equivalent to one developed at the same time by Weierstrass.</p>
<p>Weierstrass sought to separate the calculus from geometry and to base
it on the concept of number alone. Like Meray, he also saw that to do
this, it´ was necessary to give a definition of an irrational number
that is independent of the limit concept, inasmuch as the latter had up
to this point presupposed the former. To correct Cauchy’s logical error,
Weierstrass settled the question of the existence of a limit of a
convergent sequence by making the sequence itself the number or the
limit. Weierstrass’s scheme is too subtle to be presented in detail
here, but in considerably oversimplified form, we may say that the
number is not the limit of the series</p>
<p>111 1103n 1 ; it is the sequence associated with this series.
(Actually, in Weierstrass’s theory, the irrational numbers are more
broadly defined as aggregates of the rationals, rather than more
narrowly as ordered sequences of rationals, as we have implied.)</p>
<p>Weierstrass did not publish his views on the arithmetization of
analysis, but they were made known by men such as Ferdinand Lindemann
and Eduard Heine, who had followed his lectures. In 1871, Cantor had
initiated a third program of arithmetization, similar to those of Meray´
and Weierstrass. Heine suggested simplifications that have led to the
so-called Cantor-Heine development, published by Heine in Crelle’s
Journal for 1872 in the article “Die Elemente der Funktionenlehre.” In
essence, the scheme resembled that of Meray’s, in that convergent´
sequences that fail to converge to rational numbers are taken by fiat to
define irrational numbers. A thoroughly distinct approach to the same
problem and the one that today is best known was given in the same year
by Dedekind in a celebrated book, Stetigkeit und die Irrationalzahlen
(Continuity and Irrational Numbers).</p>
<h4 id="dedekind">Dedekind</h4>
<p>Dedekind’s attention had been directed to the problem of irrational
numbers as early as 1858, when he found himself lecturing on the
calculus. The limit concept, he concluded, should be developed through
arithmetic alone, without the usual guidance from geometry, if it were
to be rigorous. Instead of simply seeking a way out of Cauchy’s vicious
circle, Dedekind asked himself, as the title of his book implies, what
there is in continuous geometric magnitude that distinguishes it from
the rational numbers. Galileo and Leibniz had thought that the
“continuousness” of points on a line was the result of their
density—that between any two points, there is always a third; however,
the rational numbers have this property, yet they do not form a
continuum. On pondering this matter, Dedekind came to the conclusion
that the essence of the continuity of a line segment is not due to a
vague hang-togetherness but to an exactly opposite property: the nature
of the division of the segment into two parts by a point on the segment.
In any division of the points of the</p>
<p>D e dekind</p>
<p>segment into two classes such that each point belongs to one and only
one class, and such that every point of the one class is to the left of
every point in the other, there is one and only one point that brings
about the division. As Dedekind wrote, “By this commonplace remark the
secret of continuity is to be revealed.” Commonplace the remark may have
been, but its author seems to have had some qualms about it, for he
hesitated for some years before committing himself in print.</p>
<p>Dedekind saw that the domain of rational numbers can be extended to
form a continuum of real numbers if one assumes what is now known as the
Cantor-Dedekind axiom, namely, that the points on a line can be put into
one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers. Arithmetically
expressed, this means that for every division of the rational numbers
into two classes A and B such that every number of the first class, A,
is less than every number of the second class, B, there is one and only
one real number producing this Schnitt, or Dedekind cut. If A has a
largest number or if B contains a smallest number, the cut defines a
rational number, but if A has no largest number and B no smallest, then
the cut defines an irrational number. If, for example, we put in A all
negative rational numbers and also all positive rational numbers whose
squares are less than 2 and in B all positive rational numbers whose
squares are more than 2, we have subdivided the entire field of rational
numbers in a manner defining an irrational number—in this case, the
number that we usuallyp write as 2. Now, Dedekind pointed out, the
fundamental theorems on limits can be proved rigorously without recourse
to geometry. It was geometry that had pointed the way to a suitable
definition of continuity, but in the end, it was excluded from the
formal arithmetic definition of the concept. The Dedekind cut in the
rational number system, or an equivalent construction of real number,
has now replaced geometrical magnitude as the backbone of analysis.</p>
<p>The definitions of real number are, as Hankel indicated they should
be, intellectual constructions on the basis of the rational numbers,
rather than something imposed on mathematics from without. Of the
previous definitions, one of the most popular has been that of Dedekind.
Early in the twentieth century, a modification of the Dedekind cut was
proposed by Bertrand Russell (1872 1970). He noted that because either
of Dedekind’s two classes A and B is uniquely determined by the other,
onep alone suffices for the determination of a real number. Thus, 2 can
be defined simply as that segment or subclass of the set of rational
numbers made up of all positive rational numbers whose squares are less
than 2 and also of all negative rational numbers. Similarly, every real
number is nothing more than a segment of the rational number system.</p>
<p>In some respects, the life of Dedekind was similar to that of
Weierstrass. He, too, was one of four children, and he, too, never
married, and both men lived into their eighties. On the other hand,
Dedekind made an earlier start in mathematics than had Weierstrass,
entering Gottingen¨ at the age of nineteen and earning his doctorate
three years later with a thesis on the calculus that elicited praise
from Gauss. Dedekind stayed at Gottingen for a few years, teaching and
listening to lectures by¨ Dirichlet, and then he took up secondary
school teaching, chiefly at Brunswick, for the rest of his life.
Dedekind lived so long after his celebrated introduction of “cuts” that
the famous publishing house of Teubner had listed his death in its
Calendar for Mathematicians as September 4, 1899. This amused Dedekind,
who lived more than a dozen years longer, and he wrote to the editor
that he had passed the day in question in stimulating conversation with
his friend Georg Cantor.</p>
<h4 id="cantor-and-kronecker">Cantor and Kronecker</h4>
<p>The life of Cantor was tragically different from that of his friend
Dedekind. Cantor was born in St. Petersburg of parents who had migrated
from Denmark, but most of his life was spent in Germany, the family
having moved to Frankfurt when he was eleven. His parents were
Christians of Jewish background—his father had been converted to
Protestantism, his mother had been born a Catholic. The son Georg took a
strong interest in the fine-spun arguments of medieval theologians
concerning continuity and the infinite, and this militated against his
pursuing a mundane career in engineering, as suggested by his father. In
his studies at Zurich, Gottingen, and Berlin, the young man consequently
concentrated on¨ philosophy, physics, and mathematics—a program that
seems to have fostered his unprecedented mathematical imagination. He
took his doctorate at Berlin in 1867 with a thesis on the theory of
numbers, but his early publications show an attraction to Weierstrassian
analysis. This field prompted the revolutionary ideas that sprang to his
mind in his late twenties. We have already noted the work of Cantor in
connection with the prosaic phrase “real number,” but his most original
contributions centered about the provocative word “infinity.”</p>
<p>Ever since the days of Zeno, men had been talking about infinity, in
theology as well as in mathematics, but no one before 1872 had been able
to tell precisely what he was talking about. All too frequently in
discussions of the infinite, the examples cited were such things as
unlimited power or indefinitely large magnitudes. Occasionally,
attention had instead been focused, as in the work of Galileo and
Bolzano, on the infinitely many elements in a collection, for example,
the natural numbers or the points in a line segment. Cauchy and
Weierstrass saw only paradox in attempts to identify an actual or
“completed” infinity in mathematics, believing that the infinitely large
and small indicated nothing more than the potentiality of Aristotle—an
incompleteness of the process in question. Cantor and Dedekind came to a
contrary conclusion. Dedekind saw</p>
<p>C ant or and Kr one c ker</p>
<p>in Bolzano’s paradoxes not an anomaly, but a universal property of
infinite sets that he took as a precise definition:</p>
<p>A system S is said to be infinite when it is similar to a proper part
of itself; in the contrary case S is said to be a finite system.</p>
<p>In somewhat more modern terminology, a set S of elements is said to
be infinite if the elements of a proper subset Su can be put into
one-toone correspondence with the elements of S. That the set S of
natural numbers is infinite, for instance, is clear from the fact that
the subset Su made up of all triangular numbers is such that to each
element n of S, there corresponds an element of Su given by n(n 1 l)/2.
This positive definition of a “completed infinite” set is not to be
confused with the negative statement sometimes written with Wallis’s
symbol as 1/05
N.Thislast“equation”simplyindicatesthatthereisnorealnumber that
multiplied by zero will produce the number 1.</p>
<p>Dedekind’s definition of an infinite set appeared in 1872 in his
Stetigkeit und irrationale Zahlen. (In 1888, Dedekind amplified his
ideas in another important treatise, Was sind und was sollen die
Zahlen.) Two years later, Cantor married, and on the honeymoon, he took
his bride to Interlaken, where they met Dedekind. In the same year,
1874, Cantor published in Crelle’s Journal one of his most revolutionary
papers. He, like Dedekind, had recognized the fundamental property of
infinite sets, but, unlike Dedekind, Cantor saw that not all infinite
sets are the same. In the finite case, sets of elements are said to have
the same (cardinal) number if they can be put into one-to-one
correspondence. In a somewhat similar way, Cantor set out to build a
hierarchy of infinite sets according to the Ma¨chtigkeit, or “power,” of
the set. The set of perfect squares or the set of triangular numbers has
the same power as the set of all of the positive integers, for the
groups can be put into one-to-one correspondence. These sets seem to be
much smaller than the set of all rational fractions, yet Cantor showed
that the latter set is also countable or denumerable—that is, it, too,
can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers,
hence has the same power. To show this, we merely follow the arrows in
Fig. 22.1, “counting” the fractions along the way.</p>
<p>The rational fractions are so dense that between any two of them, no
matter how close, there will always be another, yet Cantor’s arrangement
showed that the set of fractions has the same power as does the set of
integers. One begins to wonder whether all sets of numbers have the same
power, but Cantor proved conclusively that this is not the case. The set
of all real numbers, for example, has a higher power than does the set
of rational fractions. To show this, Cantor used a reductio ad absurdum.
Assume that the real numbers between 0 and 1 are countable, are
expressed</p>
<p>. . . . .</p>
<p>as nonterminating decimals (so that , for example, appears as
0.333…,</p>
<p>as 0.499…, and so on), and are arranged in denumerable order:</p>
<p>a1 50:a11a12a13 ; a2 50:a21a22a23 ; a3 50:a31a32a33 ;</p>
<p>;</p>
<p>where aij is a digit between 0 and 9 inclusive. To show that not all
of the real numbers between 0 and 1 are included above, Cantor exhibited
an infinite decimal different from all of those listed. To do this,
simply form the decimal b50.b1b2b3 …, where bK 59 if aKK 51 and bK 51 if
aKK 6¼ 1. This real number will be between 0 and 1, and yet it will be
unequal to any one of those in the arrangement that was presumed to
contain all of the real numbers between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>The real numbers can be subdivided into two types in two different
ways: (1) as rational and irrational or (2) as algebraic and
transcendental. Cantor showed that even the class of algebraic numbers,
which is far more general than that of rational numbers, nevertheless
has the same power as that of the integers. Hence, it is the
transcendental numbers that give to the real number system the “density”
that results in a higher power. That it is fundamentally a matter of
density that determines the power of a set is suggested in the fact that
the power of the set of points on an infinitely extended line is just
the same as the power of the set of points in any segment of the line,
however small. To show this, let RS be the infinitely</p>
<p>C ant or and Kr one c ker</p>
<p>extended line and let PQ be any finite segment (Fig. 22.2). Place the
segment so that it intersects RS at a point O but is not perpendicular
to RS and does not lie on RS. If the points M and N are so chosen that
PM and QN are parallel to RS and MON is perpendicular to RS, then, by
drawing lines through M intersecting both OP and OR and lines through N
intersecting OQ and OS, a one-to-one correspondence is easily
established.</p>
<p>More surprising still is the fact that dimensionality is not the
arbiter of the power of a set. The power of the set of points in a unit
line segment is just the same as that of the points in a unit area or in
a unit volume— or, for that matter, in all of three-dimensional space.
(Dimensionality, however, retains some measure of authority, in that any
one-to-one mapping of points in a space of unlike dimensionality is
necessarily a discontinuous mapping.) So paradoxical were some results
in point-set theory that Cantor himself on one occasion in 1877 wrote to
Dedekind, “I see it, but I don’t believe it,” and he asked his friend to
check the proof. Publishers, too, were very hesitant about accepting his
papers, and several times the appearance of articles by Cantor in
Crelle’s Journal was delayed by editorial indecision and concern lest
error lurk in the unconventional approach to mathematical concepts.</p>
<p>Cantor’s amazing results led him to establish the theory of sets, a
fullfledged mathematical discipline, known as Mengenlehre (theory of
assemblages) or Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (theory of manifolds), a branch
that in the mid-twentieth century was to have profound effects on the
teaching of mathematics. At the time of its founding, Cantor spent much
effort in convincing his contemporaries of the validity of the results,
for there was considerable horror infiniti, and mathematicians were
reluctant to accept the eigentlich Unendliche or “completed infinity.”
In piling evidence on
evidence,Cantorintheendbuiltawholetransfinitearithmetic.The“power” of a
set became the “cardinal number” of the set. Thus, the “number” of the
set of integers is the “smallest” transfinite number, E, and the
“number” of the set of real numbers or of points on a line is a “larger”
number, C, the number of the continuum. Still unanswered is the question
whether there are transfinite numbers between E and C. Cantor himself
showed that there are indefinitely many transfinite numbers beyond C,
for he proved that the set ofsubsets ofa set is always ofa higherpower
than the set itself. Hence, the “number” of the set of subsets of C is a
third transfinite</p>
<p>number, the set of subsets of this set of subsets determines a fourth
number, and so on, indefinitely. As there are infinitely many natural
numbers, so are there infinitely many transfinite numbers as well.</p>
<p>The transfinite numbers described previously are cardinal numbers,
but Cantor also developed an arithmetic of transfinite ordinal numbers.
Ordering relations are a ticklish matter in mathematics, so it turns out
that transfinite ordinal arithmetic differs strikingly from finite
ordinal arithmetic. For finite cases, the rules for ordinal numbers are
essentially the same as for cardinal numbers. Thus, 3145413, whether
these digits represent cardinal or ordinal numbers. If, however, one
designates by ω the ordinal number of the “counting numbers,” then ω11
is not the same as 11ω, for 11ω is obviously the same as ω. Moreover,
one can show that ω1ω5ω andω U

<p>Dedekind and Cantor were among the most capable mathematicians, and
certainly the most original, of their day, yet neither man secured a
top-ranking professional position. Dedekind spent almost a lifetime
teaching at the secondary-school level, and Cantor spent most of his
career at the University of Halle. Cantor had hoped to achieve the
distinction of a professorship at the University of Berlin, and he
blamed Leopold Kronecker (1823 1891) for his lack of success.</p>
<p>KroneckerhadbeenastudentofKummer’s,firstatthesecondary-school level,
when the latter was a teacher in the gymnasium that Kronecker attended,
later at the University of Breslau. Kronecker studied with Steiner and
Dirichlet at Berlin, where he obtained his doctoral degree in 1845. The
son of wealthy parents, he did not initially pursue an academic career
but looked after the family’s financial interests. He continued to do
mathematical research, however. When he moved to Berlin in 1855, he led
the life of a private scholar. His prodigious output, covering number
theory, the theory of equations, and elliptic function theory, among
others, in 1861 gained him membership in the Academy of Sciences in
Berlin. This made him eligible to teach at the University of Berlin,
which he proceeded to do. He was appointed to a regular professorship in
1883, when Kummer retired. Kronecker’s research contributions were
significant, both for individual results and for his overall attempt to
arithmetize algebra, as well as analysis. His influence on early
twentiethcentury algebra was considerable, as was that on number theory;
the work of Erich Hecke (1887 1947) serves as an example. The importance
of Kronecker’s work has been overshadowed in most historical accounts by
rather hostile versions of his conflict with Cantor. In fact, his
predilection for the integers and his espousal of constructive
procedures also estranged
himfromWeierstrass.Tohimisattributedthewell-knownstatement“God made the
integers, and all the rest is the work of man.” He categorically
rejected the real-number constructions of his day on the grounds that
they cannot be achieved only through finite processes. He is said to
have</p>
<p>asked Lindemann of what use was the proof that π is not algebraic,
inasmuch as irrational numbers are nonexistent. Sometimes it is reported
that his movement died of inanition. We shall later see that it can be
said to have reappeared in a new form in the work of Poincare and´ L. E.
J. Brouwer.</p>
<p>In 1883, Cantor wrote a vigorous defense in his Grundlagen einer
allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre (Foundations of a General Theory of
Manifolds), holding that “definite numerations can be undertaken with
infinite sets just as well as with finite.” He had no fear of falling
into what he described as an “abyss of transcendentals,” yet he did
occasionally lapse into arguments of the theological type. Kronecker
continued his attacks on the hypersensitive and temperamental Cantor,
and in 1884, Cantor suffered the first of the nervous breakdowns that
were to recur during the remaining thirty-three years of his life. Fits
of depression sometimes led him to doubt his own work, although he was
comforted to some extent by the support of men such as Hermite. Toward
the end, he did earn recognition for his achievements, but his death in
1918 in a mental institution in Halle is a reminder that genius and
madness sometimes are closely related. The tragedy of his personal life
is mitigated by the paean of praise of one of the leading mathematicians
of the early twentieth century, David Hilbert, who described the new
transfinite arithmetic as “the most astonishing product of mathematical
thought, one of most beautiful realizations of human activity in the
domain of the purely intelligible.” Where timid souls had hesitated,
Hilbert exclaimed, “No one shall expel us from the paradise which Cantor
has created for us.”</p>
<h4 id="analysis-in-france">Analysis in France</h4>
<p>Before examining some of the fruits of Cantor’s paradise, we should
regard some nineteenth-century analytic work in the country thus far
ignored in this chapter—France. Although analytic activity during the
latter part of the nineteenth century was most conspicuous in Germany
and England, there had been a steady stream of contributions from Paris.
These took a variety of forms, in teaching and research. Primarily
associated with teaching were the great textbooks, usually based on
lecture notes. Sturm’s Cours d’analyse was but one of the
longest-lasting successors to Cauchy’s record of the course taught at
the E´cole Polytechnique; at the turn of the century, it was overtaken
by Goursat’s work, which exerted a special influence in the United
States through its English translation. Briot and Bouquet’s Theorie des
fonctions elliptiques´ was a comprehensive compendium on the subject of
elliptic functions; H. Laurent produced an elementary textbook on the
subject more suitable for classroom use. Toward the end of the century,
Jules Tannery and J. Molk produced multivolume Elements of the theory of
elliptic functions. There were authors who ranged across a wider field,
such as Joseph Alfred Serret (1819 1885), who taught and produced
textbooks on practically every area of mid-nineteenth-century
mathematics. Also significant was the work of popularizers such as the
Abbe Moigno, a self-´ appointed explicator of Cauchy in the 1840s and
the editor of Cosmos, a journal that reported on scientific and
mathematical activities.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Cauchy’s work provided ample takeoff points for
many analysts of the time. For example, Pierre-Alphonse Laurent
(1813</p>
<ol start="1854" type="1">
<li>and Victor Puiseux (1820 1883) are still remembered for their
contributions to complex function theory. Laurent’s expansion replaces
Taylor series at certain points of discontinuity; Puiseux went beyond
Cauchy in a clear discussion of essential singularities and related
matters.</li>
</ol>
<p>French mathematics continued to influence activity elsewhere—we have
already noted this in connection with Liouville and Camille Jordan.
Another example may be found in the work of Gabriel Lame (1795´ 1860),
whose name is primarily associated with the introduction of curvilinear
coordinates to the treatment of the partial differential equations,
especially the heat equation, describing physical problems. Eduard
Heine, a much younger member of the Dirichlet circle, who concentrated
on spherical harmonics and the potential equation, first followed and
for a while was in close competition with Lame in his research. Also´
inspired by Lame’s concept of curvilinear coordinates and overlapping´
with Heine was E´. Mathieu (1835 1900), who introduced elliptic
cylindrical coordinates and the functions named after him in his study
of the wave equation, in connection with the problem of a vibrating
elliptic membrane.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known French analytic work of midcentury was that of
Sturm and Liouville, dealing with the theory of second-order ordinary
differential equations with boundary conditions. In fact, the papers in
question were published in the early issues of Liouville’s Journal in
the 1830s. Their tremendous significance emerged only gradually,
however, especially through the use made of them by the British
mathematical physicists of the later period. The problem at issue was
that of the expansibility into characteristic functions (eigenfunctions)
of the expression at hand. It can be regarded as a generalization of the
theory of Fourier series. Sturm had studied not only Fourier’s theory of
heat but also his work on numerical solutions of equations; the
influence of this work seems apparent as soon as one reads Sturm’s first
major result of the theory. This is his separation theorem, which states
that the oscillations of any two (real) solutions alternate, or separate
each other. The Sturm-Liouville theory not only confirmed the
expansibility but also provided criteria for solutions and for the
evaluation of the eigenfunctions. The theory was not altogether rigorous
at the outset. Toward the end of the century, refinements in
applications and proofs were provided. Especially active in the field
was the American mathematician Maxime Boˆcher (1867 1918). Boˆcher, who
trained at Harvard in the</p>
<p>1880s under William Elwood Byerly, Benjamin O. Peirce, and James
Mills Peirce, had earned his doctoral degree at Gottingen under Klein
in¨ 1891 with a prize-winning dissertation on the series expansions of
potential theory. After the turn of the century, Boˆcher was briefly
joined in the study of Sturm-Liouville issues by his fellow countrymen
Max Mason, G. R. D. Richardson, and G. D. Birkhoff. As a token of
appreciation for Sturm and Liouville’s theory and the research
opportunities it had provided for this small band of American analysts,
Boˆcher chose Sturm’s methods as his topic when he was invited to give a
set of lectures at the University of Paris in the winter of 1913
1914.</p>
<p>Liouville is also noted for a variety of other contributions. In
complex analysis, his work is recalled in Liouville’s theorem: If f(z),
an entire analytic function of the complex variable z, is bounded over
the complex plane, then f(z) is a constant. From this theorem, the
fundamental theorem of algebra can be deduced as a simple corollary as
follows: If f(z) is a polynomial of degree greater than zero, and if
f(z) were nowhere zero in the complex plane, then its reciprocal
F(z)5l/f(z) would satisfy the conditions of the Liouville theorem.
Consequently, F(z) would have to be a constant, which obviously it is
not. Therefore, the equation f(z)50 is satisfied by at least one complex
value z5z0. In plane analytic geometry, there is another “Liouville
theorem”: The lengths of the tangents from a point P to a conic C are
proportional to the cube roots of the radii of curvature of C at the
corresponding points of contact. Finally, let us consider Liouville’s
best-known contribution to the theory of real numbers.</p>
<p>The theory of numbers deals primarily with the integers or, more
generally, with ratios of integers—the so-called rational numbers. Such
numbers are always roots of a linear equation ax 1 b 50 with integral
coefficients. Real analysis deals with a more general type of number
that may be either rational or irrational. It had been known, in
essence, to Euclid that the roots of ax2 1bx1c 50, where a, b, and c are
integral multiples of a given length, can be constructed geometrically
with a straightedge and compasses. If the coefficients of axn 1bxn 1
1cxn 2 1 1px1q50, where n and a,b,c, . .. ,q are integers and n .2, the
roots of the equation generally are not constructible with Euclidean
tools. The roots of such an equation, for n.0, are known as algebraic
numbers, to indicate the manner in which they are defined. Inasmuch as
every rational number is a root of such an equation for n51, the
question naturally arises whether every irrational number is a root of
such an equation for some n. The negative of this question was finally
established in 1844 by Liouville, who in that year constructed an
extensive class of nonalgebraic real numbers. The numbers of the
particular class that he developed are known as Liouville numbers, the
more comprehensive set of nonalgebraic real numbers being called
transcendental numbers. Liouville’s construction of transcendental
numbers is quite involved, but if one does not insist on a proof of
transcendentalism, some simple examples of transcendental numbers can be
given—such as</p>
<p>0.1001000100001 … , or numbers of the form</p>
<p>N 1</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>10n! n1</p>
<p>To prove that any particular real number, such as e or π, is not
algebraic is usually quite difficult. Liouville, for example, was able
to show, in his Journal for 1844, that neither e nor e2 could be the
root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients; hence, given a
unit line segment, lines of length e or e2 are not constructible by
Euclidean tools. But it was almost thirty years before another French
mathematician, Charles Hermite (1822 1901), pursuing the views of
Liouville, was able to show in 1873 in an article in the Comptes Rendus
of the Academie that´ e could not be the root of any polynomial equation
with integral coefficients—that is, that e is transcendental.</p>
<p>The status of the number π baffled mathematicians for nine years
longer than did the number e. Lambert in 1770 and Legendre in 1794 had
shown that both π and π2 are irrational, but this proof had not put an
end to the age-old question of the squaring of the circle. The matter
was finally put to rest in 1882 in a paper in the Mathematische Annalen
by C. L. F. Lindemann (1852 1939) of Munich. The article, titled “U¨ ber
die Zahl π,” showed conclusively, in extending the work of Liouville and
Hermite, that π is also a transcendental number. In his proof, Lindemann
first demonstrated that the equation eix 1150 cannot be satisfied if x
is algebraic. Inasmuch as Euler had shown that the value x5π does
satisfy the equation, it must follow that π is not algebraic. Here,
finally, was the answer to the classical problem of the quadrature of
the circle. In order for the quadrature of the circle to be possible
with Euclidean tools, the number π would have to be the root of an
algebraic equation with a root expressible in square roots. Because π is
not algebraic, the circle cannot be squared according to the classical
rules. Emboldened by his success, Ferdinand Lindemann later published
several purported proofs of Fermat’s Last Theorem, but they were shown
by others to be invalid.</p>
<p>Hermite was one of France’s most influential nineteenth-century
analysts. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that he had fared
badly as a student when faced with educational pedantry and
examinations, Hermite at one time or another was affiliated with the
major mathematically oriented institutions of Paris. Hermite served as
examiner at the E´cole Polytechnique, substituted at the Colle`ge de
France, taught at the E´cole Normale, and, from 1869 to 1897, held the
chair as professor of higher analysis at the Sorbonne. In school, he had
the same teacher who had encouraged the young Galois; his first reading
in the mathematical classics consisted of Lagrange’s work on the
solution of numerical equations and the French translation of Gauss’s
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. He had first come to notice in 1842, while
still a preparatory school student, by submitting two papers to the
Nouvelles Annales de Mathematiques´ , a journal aimed at mathematics
teachers and their more advanced students. One of
thesepaperswasaveryelegantexpositionoftheinsolvabilityofthequintic. In
1858, he, as well as Kronecker, solved the quintic equation using
elliptic modular functions. During the intervening years, Hermite had
come under the protection of Liouville, who introduced Hermite to his
friends in Prussia, especially Jacobi. The ensuing correspondence shows
Hermite’s early feats in the theory of elliptic and Abelian functions
and analytic number theory. In 1864, Hermite contributed a new class of
special functions in connection with the problem of functional
expansions over unbounded intervals. Ironically, the name of this great
analyst nowadays appears more frequently in algebra than in analysis:
Given a matrix H, let each of its elements be replaced by its complex
conjugate and call the resulting matrix H<em>. If H5H</em>, the matrix
is called Hermitian. In 1858, Hermite showed that the eigenvalues of
such a matrix are real. Previously, he had coined the term “orthogonal”
for a matrix M if 2M equals the inverse of M*.</p>
<p>The steady contributions of nineteenth-century French analysts attest
to the continuing fertility of French analytic soil, but the most
telling sign was the spectacular display of new concepts that Poincare
and his´ younger contemporaries presented to the new century.</p>

<h4 id="overview-1">Overview</h4>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, it was clear that not only the
content of mathematics but also its institutional and interpersonal
framework had changed radically since the early 1800s. In addition to
the growth of mathematical journals and academic departments during the
century and the traditional individual communication among
mathematicians of different countries, the exchange of mathematical
ideas was furthered greatly by the establishment of national
mathematical societies and international meetings of mathematicians. The
London Mathematical Society, founded in 1865, and the Societ´ e Math´
ematique de France, established in 1872, led´ the way. They were
followed in the 1880s by the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in Scotland,
the Circolo Matematico Palermo in Italy, and the New York Mathematical
Society, soon renamed the American Mathematical</p>
<p>Society. The Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung followed in 1890.
Each</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>of these groups held regular meetings and issued periodical
publications. An International Congress of Mathematicians was first held
in Chicago in 1893, in conjunction with the Columbian Exposition. This
was followed in 1897 by the first of a series of “official” congresses
of mathematicians, held every four years except for disruption by the
two world wars and the cold war. The first of these took place in
Zurich. During most of the twentieth century, congresses were held in
Europe, the exceptions being 1924 (Toronto), 1974 (Vancouver), 1986
(Berkeley), and 1990 (Kyoto). Despite major economic and political
differences, for the most part, twentieth-century mathematicians had
more rapid awareness of the work of their colleagues on other continents
than their precursors had of results obtained by someone in a
neighboring province.</p>
<p>Other twentieth-century trends that were becoming noticeable toward
the end of the nineteenth century include the emphasis on common
underlying structures that point up correspondences among areas of
mathematics that had been considered unrelated until then. At the same
time, mathematics was no less immune to the fashions and dominance of
certain mathematical schools than were previous periods in history. This
is attributed to the state of research in a given area as well as to the
influence of individual contributors; there are also external factors,
such as developments in allied fields like physics, statistics, and
computer science, or economic and social pressures, which usually serve
to support applications.</p>
<h4 id="henri-poincare">Henri Poincare´</h4>
<p>When Gauss died in 1855, it was generally thought that there would
never again be a universalist in mathematics—one who is at home in all
branches, pure and applied. If anyone has since proved this view wrong,
it was Poincare, for he took all mathematics as his province. In
several´ respects, however, Poincare differed fundamentally from Gauss.
Gauss´ had been a calculating prodigy who during his life did not flinch
from involved computations, whereas Poincare was not especially early
in´ showing mathematical promise and readily admitted that he had
difficulty with simple arithmetic calculations. Poincare’s case shows
that to´ be a great mathematician, one need not excel in number
facility; there are other, more advantageous aspects of innate
mathematical ability. Also, whereas Gauss wrote relatively little,
polishing his works, Poincare´ wrote hastily and extensively, publishing
more memoirs per year than any other mathematician. Moreover, Poincare,
especially in later life,´ wrote popular books with a philosophical
flair, something that had not tempted Gauss. On the other hand,
similarities between Poincare and´ Gauss are numerous and fundamental.
Both so teemed with ideas that it was difficult for them to jot the
thoughts down on paper, both had a strong preference for general
theorems over specific cases, and both contributed to a wide variety of
branches of science.</p>
<p>Henri Poincare (1854´ 1912) was born in Nancy, a city that was to
harbor a number of leading mathematicians in the twentieth century. The
family achieved eminence in various ways; Henri’s cousin Raymond served
as president of France during World War I. Henri was clumsily
ambidextrous, and his ineptitude in physical exercise was legendary. He
had poor eyesight and was very absentminded, but, like Euler and Gauss,
he had a remarkable capacity for mental exercises in all aspects of
mathematical thought. On graduating from the E´cole Polytechnique in
1875, he took a degree in mining engineering in 1879 and became attached
to the Department of Mines for the rest of his life. Also in 1879, he
earned his doctorate under Hermite at the University of Paris; he would
hold several professorships in mathematics and science there until his
death, besides serving as a professor at the E´cole Polytechnique.</p>
<p>Automorphic Functions and Differential Equations</p>
<p>Poincare’s doctoral thesis had been on differential equations (not
on´ methods of solution, but on existence theorems), which led to one of
his most celebrated contributions to mathematics—the properties of
automorphic functions.In fact, he was the virtual founder of thetheory
of these functions. An automorphic function f(z) of the complex variable
z is one
thatisanalytic,exceptforpoles,inadomainDandthatisinvariantundera
denumerably infinite group of linear fractional transformations</p>
<p>az1b zu5: cz1d</p>
<p>Such functions are generalizations of trigonometric functions (as we
see if a515d, c50, and b is of the form 2kπ) and of elliptic functions.
Hermite had studied such transformations for the restricted case in
which the coefficients a, b, c, and d are integers for which ad2bc51 and
had discovered a class of elliptic modular functions invariant under
these. But Poincare’s generalizations disclosed a broader category of
functions,´ known as zeta-Fuchsian functions, which, Poincare showed,
could be´ used to solve the second-order linear differential equation
with algebraic coefficients.</p>
<p>This was only the beginning of many important contributions by
Poincare to the theory of differential equations. The subject runs like
a´ red thread through most of his work. In a synopsis of his own work,
he commented that analysts had faced three major problems since the
establishment of the calculus: the solution of algebraic equations, the
integration of algebraic differentials, and the integration of
differential equations. He observed that in all three cases, history had
shown that success lay not in the traditional attempts at reduction to a
simpler problem but in a head-on attack on the nature of the solution.
This had been the key to the algebraic problem provided by Galois. In
the second case, the attack on algebraic differentials, successes had
been achieved for several decades by those who no longer attempted a
reduction to elementary functions but used the new transcendental
functions. Poincare´ had been certain that a similar approach would aid
with previously intractable problems in the solution of differential
equations.</p>
<p>As noted previously, the outlook was already present in his doctoral
thesis. It hadbeen titled “On theProperties of FunctionsDefined
byPartial Differential Equations.” He tackled the main problem in a
series of papers published in the early 1880s, in which he set out to
provide a qualitative
descriptionofsolutions.Hefirstattackedthegeneralequationdx/f(x,y)5
dy/g(x, y), where f and g are real polynomials. To handle the problem of
infinite branches, he projected the xy-plane onto a sphere. He now
examined his equation,paying special attention to the points at which
both polynomials vanish. Using the classification by Briot and Bouquet,
based on Cauchy, of such singularities into nodes, saddle points, foci,
and centers, he was able to establish general properties of the
solutions that depended purely on the presence or the absence of a
specific type of singularity. For example, he established that the
traditional solution of the
typeT(x,y)5C(withTanalyticandCconstant)occursonlyifthereare no nodes or
foci. In the third of the four papers containing this theory, Poincare
extended his analysis to higher-degree equations of the form´ F(x, y,
yu)50, F being a polynomial. He approached such equations by considering
the surface defined by F(x, y, yu)50. Letting the genus of the surface
be p, the number of foci be F, of nodes N, and of saddle points S,
Poincare showed that´ N1 F2S5222P. After exploring the ramifications of
this and of other results, Poincare proceeded to the study of´
equationsofhigherorder.Thoughnotabletoestablishas comprehensivea set of
results as he had for dimension two, he generalized the new technique
using hypersurfaces and firmed up relationships between the
singularities and the Betti number of the hypersurface.</p>
<p>Among many other results in the study of differential equations, we
cite only a few. One of his earliest pertains to linear equations and
the neighborhood of an irregular singularity; here he provided a
pathbreaking example of expanding solutions into asymptotic series. In
1884, he turned to the study of first-order differential equations with
fixed singularities in the complex domain. E´mile Picard (1856 1941)
used this work in his study of second-order equations. Poincare’s work
here´ is also at the basis of Paul Painleve’s (1863´ 1933) profound
investigations of nonlinear second-order equations with or without
(movable) singularities. Poincare’s subsequent work in ordinary and
partial dif-´ ferential equations related mostly to physical
applications, especially in celestial mechanics and the n-body
problem.</p>
<p>Mathematical Physics And Other Applications</p>
<p>Poincare did not stay in any field long enough to round out his work.
A´ contemporary said of him, “He was a conqueror, not a colonist.” In
his teaching at the Sorbonne, he would lecture on a different topic each
school year—capillarity, elasticity, thermodynamics, optics,
electricity, telegraphy, cosmogony, and others; the presentation was
such that in many cases, the lectures appeared in print shortly after
they had been delivered. In astronomy alone, he published half a dozen
volumes—Les methodes´ nouvelles de la mecanique celeste´ (3 vols., 1892
1899) and Lec¸ons de mecanique c´ eleste´ (3 vols., 1905 1910)—being in
this respect a worthy successor of Laplace. Especially important were
the methods he used to attack the three-body problem and its
generalizations. Also significant for cosmogony was a memoir of 1885, in
which he showed that a pear shape can be a figure of relative
equilibrium assumed by a homogeneous fluid subject to Newtonian
gravitation and rotating uniformly about an axis; the question of a
pear-shaped earth has continued to interest geodesists to our day. Sir
George H. Darwin (1845 1912), the son of Charles Darwin (1809 1882),
wrote in 1909 that Poincare’s celestial mechanics would be´ a vast mine
for researchers for half a century; a century later, the mine has not
been exhausted.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Poincare, like Laplace, also wrote extensively
on´ probability. In some respects, his work is only a natural
continuation of that of Laplace and the analysts of the nineteenth
century, but Poincare was´ Janus-faced and to some extent anticipated
the great interest in topology that was to be so characteristic of the
twentieth century. Topology was not the invention of any one man. Some
topological problems are found in the work of Euler, Mo¨bius, and
Cantor, and even the word “topology” had been used in 1847 by J. B.
Listing (1808 1882) in the title of a book, Vorstudien zur Topologie
(Introductory Studies in Topology). But as a date for the beginning of
the subject, none is more appropriate than 1895, the year in which
Poincare published its first systematic development in his´ Analysis
situs.</p>
<p>Topology</p>
<p>Topology is now a broad and fundamental branch of mathematics, with
many aspects, but it can be subdivided into two fairly distinct
subbranches: combinatorial topology and point-set topology. Poincare
had´ little enthusiasm for the latter, and when, in 1908, he addressed
the International Mathematical Congress at Rome, he referred to Cantor’s
Mengenlehre as a disease from which later generations would regard
themselves as having recovered. Combinatorial topology, or analysis
situs, as it was then generally called, is the study of intrinsic
qualitative aspects of spatial configurations that remain invariant
under continuous one-to-one transformations. It is often referred to
popularly as “rubber-sheet geometry,” for deformations of, say, a
balloon, without puncturing or tearing it, are instances of topological
transformations. A circle, for example, is topologically equivalent to
an ellipse; the dimensionality of a space is a topological invariant, as
is also the Descartes-Euler number N0 2N1 1N2 for simple polyhedra.
Among Poincare’s original contributions to topology was a generalization
of´ the Descartes-Euler polyhedral formula for spaces of higher
dimensionality, making use of what he called “Betti numbers,” in honor
of Enrico Betti (1823 1892), who had taught at the University of Pisa
and had noted some of the properties of these topological invariants.
Most of topology, nevertheless, deals with qualitative, rather than
quantitative, aspects of mathematics, and, in this respect, it typifies
a sharp break from the styles prevailing in nineteenth-century analysis.
Poincare’s attention´ seems to have been directed toward analysis situs
by attempts at qualitative integrations of differential equations.
Poincare, like Riemann, was´ especially adept at handling problems of a
topological nature, such as finding out the properties of a function
without worrying about its formal representation in the classical sense;
both men were intuitionists with sound judgment.</p>
<p>Poincare stated that practically every problem he touched led him to´
analysis situs. We have seen an example in his attack on differential
equations. In the decade that overlapped the end of the nineteenth
century and the beginning of the twentieth, he published a series of
papers on the subject. These became the basis of twentieth-century
combinatorial, or algebraic, topology. Here he elaborated on the
concepts derived from Riemann and Betti that we encountered in his work
on differential equations: treating a figure as an n-dimensional
manifold and considering the order of connectedness. He set forth the
fundamental definitions and theorems of simplicial homology theory; he
established the relationship between the fundamental group of a manifold
and the first Betti number; he also pointed to further relationships
involving the Betti numbers. These papers contained theorems and
conjectures that led to many of the subsequent explorations of
twentieth-century topologists. We shall outline the story of one of

<p>Of Poincare’s many other contributions to mathematics, we only men-´
tion additional work in function theory, including Abelian functions;
substantive work on Lie groups and related problems in algebra; and
influential nontechnical writings—some polemical—on mathematics and the
philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p>As an instance of Poincare’s many-sidedness, it is to him that we
owe´ a suggestive model of Lobachevskian geometry within a Euclidean
framework. Suppose that a world is bounded by a large sphere of radius R
and the absolute temperature at a point within the sphere is R22 r2,
where r is the distance from the center of the sphere; also suppose that
the index of refraction of the pellucid medium is inversely proportional
to R22 r2. Moreover, assume that the dimensions of objects change from
point to point, being proportional to the temperature at any given
place. To inhabitants of such a world, the universe would appear to be
infinite, and rays of light, or “straight lines,” would not be
rectilinear but would be circles orthogonal to the limiting sphere and
would appear to be infinite. “Planes” would be spheres orthogonal to the
limiting sphere, and two such non-Euclidean “planes” would intersect in
a non-Euclidean “line.” The axioms of Euclid would hold, with the
exception of the parallel postulate.</p>
<p>In addition to his universality, the powerful new tools he developed,
and the results he obtained, Poincare’s importance for the twentieth´
century lies in the “unfinished” but very open nature of many of his
memoirs. An example is a famous paper he wrote on number theory.
Published in 1901, this dealt with the study of diophantine equations.
In the direction established twenty years earlier by Dedekind and Weber,
this subject was now approached through the birational theory of
algebraic curves. In other words, given a curve f(x, y)50 with rational
coefficients, one wishes to find points with rational coordinates lying
on the curve. Poincare again examined the genus of the curve,
especially´ for the case p51. Utilizing a technique made popular by
Clebsch, he used elliptic functions for a parametric representation of
the curve and noted that the rational points on the Jacobian form a
subgroup; its rank is what he called the rank of the curve. This paper
has led to several important studies. A 1917 paper by Alexander Hurwitz
(1859 1919) was followed by one from Louis Joel Mordell (1888 1972) in
1922 in which he proved that the rank of the subgroup is finite. In
1928, Andre´ Weil (1906 1998) extended this result to arbitrary
p. Echoing Fermat, Mordell and Weil used a “method of infinite descent”
based on the bisection of the elliptic functions, which Poincare may
have suggested in´ related trisections. The subsequent history of the
Mordell conjecture and other expansions of these ideas belong to
contemporary mathematics; we note the 1901 paper simply as an example of
the tremendously suggestive nature of Poincare’s publications.´</p>
<p>On the day Poincare died, Paul Painlev´ e issued a brief tribute. He
ended´ it by stressing Poincare’s intellectual sincerity. In particular,
he linked to´

<p>that there seemed little chance he might take up the problem again in

<p>The importance of the subject is too great and the collection of
results obtained too considerable already for me to resign myself to
leave them definitely barren. I can hope that geometers who will
interest themselves in this problem, and who will be undoubtedly more
fortunate than I, can turn this to good use and have it serve them to
find the direction they must take.</p>
<h4 id="david-hilbert">David Hilbert</h4>
<p>David Hilbert (1862 1943), like Immanuel Kant (1724 1804), had been
born in Ko¨nigsberg in East Prussia, but, unlike Kant, he traveled
widely, especially to attend the international congresses of
mathematicians that had become so characteristic of this century. Except
for a semester spent at the University of Heidelberg, where he studied
under the analyst Lazarus Fuchs (1833 1902), Hilbert obtained his
mathematical training at the University of Ko¨nigsberg. The main
professor for mathematics there was Heinrich Weber (1842 1913), who had
been encouraged to turn to the study of abstract concepts in algebra and
number theory by Dedekind. Weber presented some of the first abstract
definitions for groups and fields in the 1880s and 1890s and was the
author of a well-known and influential three-volume textbook of algebra
and the coauthor, with Dedekind, of the important paper on algebraic
functions mentioned in chapter 23. In 1883, Weber left Ko¨nigsberg. His
successor, F. Lindemann, had just published his proof of the
transcendence of π. Lindemann suggested to Hilbert his doctoral thesis
topic in invariant theory and encouraged Hilbert’s early work in this
field. Hilbert’s interest in invariants was further stimulated by two
men closer to his own age, of whom he saw a great deal in the 1880s.
They were Adolf Hurwitz, who had studied with Felix Klein and joined
Lindemann on the Ko¨nigsberg faculty in 1884, and Hermann Minkowski
(1864 1909), who, although still a student, in April 1893 won the “Grand
Prix des Sciences Mathematiques” awarded by the Paris Academy of Sci-´
ences for his essay on the decomposition of integers into the sum of
five squares. Hurwitz’s early work dealt with number-theoretic and
geometric questions. Most of the research he did in Ko¨nigsberg applied
Riemannian function-theoretic methods to problems in algebra,
specifically to algebraic functions. In 1892, he left Ko¨nigsberg for
Zurich, where he spent the rest of his life, making important
contributions to the theory of algebraic numbers and number fields.
Minkowski obtained his doctorate in July 1885, a few months after
Hilbert. His thesis dealt with investigations of quadratic forms using
methods introduced by Dirichlet. Hilbert was the “opponent” in debating
the thesis with Minkowski at the latter’s public promotion. As will be
seen, Minkowski and Hilbert remained close friends.</p>
<p>Invariant Theory</p>
<p>Hilbert worked predominantly in invariant theory until 1892; his most
important contributions to that subject were published in 1890 and 1893.
To understand their place in the history of invariant theory, it is
useful to follow Hilbert’s own account of that theory, which he prepared
for the International Mathematical Congress in Chicago in 1893.</p>
<p>For three decades after Boole, Cayley, and Sylvester’s early work on
invariant theory, much time was spent on computing specific invariants.
Aside from the English mathematicians previously mentioned, leading
contributors to this activity were Clebsch and Siegfried Heinrich
Aronhold (1819 1884), who discovered invariants for ternary cubic forms
and established a “symbolic” method for computing. To systematize this
work, it was proposed to find a complete system, or basis, of
invariants; that is, given a form of x of degree n, to find the smallest
number of rational integral invariants and covariants so that any other
rational integral invariant or covariant could be expressed as a
rational integral form with numerical coefficients of the complete set.
Paul Gordan (1837 1912), a professor of mathematics at the University of
Erlangen, proved the existence of a finite complete set for binary
forms. He showed that every binary form has a finite complete system of
invariants and covariants and that any finite system of binary forms has
such a system. Gordan’s proof was cumbersome but showed how the complete
system could be computed; in 1886, Franz Mertens (1840 1927) provided a
more streamlined inductive proof, which did not exhibit the system.
Hilbert’s famous result of 1888, known as his “basis theorem,” was far
more general. It was published as theorem I of a paper “On the Theory of
Algebraic Forms” in the Mathematische Annalen in 1890. As was customary,
Hilbert defined an algebraic form as an integral rational homogeneous
function in certain variables whose coefficients are numbers in a
certain “domain of rationality.” The theorem states that for any
infinite sequence S5F1, F2, F3,… of forms in n variables x1, x2,…, xn,
there exists a number m such that any form of that sequence can be
expressed as</p>
<p>F5A1F1 1A2F2 1?1AmFm;</p>
<p>where the Ai are forms in the same n variables. Hilbert applied this
result to the proof for the existence of a finite full system of
invariants for systems of forms in arbitrarily many variables. In a
subsequent influential paper, published in 1893, “On a Full System of
Invariants,” Hilbert developed his new methods for attacking problems in
invariant theory. He stressed that his approach was fundamentally
different from that of his predecessors because he treated the theory of
algebraic invariants as part of the general theory of algebraic function
fields.</p>
<p>“Zahlbericht”</p>
<p>The three-year period 1892 1895 brought major changes in Hilbert’s
life. He had begun his academic career as a privatdozent in Ko¨nigsberg
in 1886, having spent the year after his doctorate on a study trip, part
of the time in Leipzig to visit Felix Klein and part in Paris to meet
Charles Hermite. In 1892, he became Hurwitz’s successor as an associate
(“extraordinary”) professor in Ko¨nigsberg; he married the same year.
Already the next year, on Lindemann’s departure for Munich, Hilbert was
made a full (“ordinary”) professor. Yet, he stayed in Ko¨nigsberg only
until 1895, for in that year Heinrich Weber, who had left Ko¨nigsberg
for Go¨ttingen twelve years earlier, now followed a call to Strassburg.
Felix Klein arranged to have Hilbert succeed Weber at Go¨ttingen, and
since then, his name has been linked with that center of mathematical
activity, where he resided for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>At the 1893 meeting of the German Mathematical Society, Hilbert and
Minkowski were asked to write a report on number theory for the
Jahresbericht of that organization. The resulting work by Hilbert on
“The Theory of Algebraic Number Fields” became a classic; it is commonly
referred to as the “Zahlbericht.” Minkowski, who was working on his
Geometry of Numbers at that time, withdrew from the project, although he
provided Hilbert with crucial comments on his manuscript, as he did with
most of Hilbert’s manuscripts up to his untimely death in 1909.</p>
<p>In the introduction to his “Zahlbericht,” Hilbert expressed a point
of view that was to become typical of his work and his influence. It is
characterized by emphasis on the abstraction, arithmetization, and
logical development of mathematical concepts and theories. Noting that
while number theory has the fewest prerequisites necessary for an
understanding of its truths, it had been blamed for requiring a high
degree of abstraction to fully master arithmetic concepts and proof
techniques, Hilbert expressed the opinion that all other branches of
mathematics require at least an equally high degree of abstraction,
provided one subjects the foundation of these branches to the same
rigorous and complete study that is necessary. Next, he stressed the
interrelationship between number theory and algebra, as well as between
number theory and function theory, that had become apparent during the
nineteenth century. He saw the development in mathematics taking place
in his lifetime as being guided by number. According to Hilbert,
Dedekind and Weierstrass’s definition of arithmetic fundamental concepts
and Cantor’s work led to an “arithmetization of function theory,” while
modern investigations on non-Euclidean geometry, with their concern for
a rigorous logical development and a clear introduction of the number
concept, led to an “arithmetization of geometry.” In the body of the
report, Hilbert attempted to present a logical theory of algebraic
number fields. He joined in his comprehensive treatment the work of his
immediate predecessors and contemporaries and also included his own
results. Hilbert contributed a few more papers to this subject in the
1890s; these are his most mature efforts in the direction of obtaining a
generalized law of quadratic reciprocity over a variety of number
fields. With one notable exception, Hilbert produced no more new results
in number theory after the turn of the century, but until World War I,
he continued to supervise doctoral dissertations on number theory,
including those of R. Fueter (1880 1950) and E. Hecke (1887 1947).</p>
<p>The Foundations of Geometry</p>
<p>Hilbert, whose work tended to concentrate on one subject at a time,
turned to geometry after completion of the “Zahlbericht.” In 1894, he
had lectured on non-Euclidean geometry, and in 1898 1899, he presented a
small but celebrated volume titled Grundlagen der Geometrie (Foundations
of Geometry). This work, translated into numerous languages, exerted a
strong influence on the mathematics of the twentieth century. Through
the arithmetization of analysis and the axioms of Peano, most of
mathematics, except for geometry, had achieved a strict axiomatic
foundation. Geometry in the nineteenth century had flourished as never
before, but it was chiefly in Hilbert’s Grundlagen that an effort was
first made to give it the purely formal character found in algebra and
analysis. Euclid’s Elements did have a deductive structure, but it was
replete with concealed assumptions, meaningless definitions, and logical
inadequacies. Hilbert understood that not all terms in mathematics can
be defined and therefore began his treatment of geometry with three
undefined objects—point, line, and plane—and six undefined relations:
being on, being in, being between, being congruent, being parallel, and
being continuous. In place of Euclid’s five axioms (or common notions)
and five postulates, Hilbert formulated for his geometry a set of
twentyone assumptions, since known as Hilbert’s axioms. Eight of these
concern incidence and include Euclid’s first postulate, four are on
order properties, five are on congruency, three are on continuity
(assumptions not explicitly mentioned by Euclid), and one is a parallel
postulate that is essentially equivalent to Euclid’s fifth postulate.
Following the pioneer work by Hilbert, alternative sets of axioms have
been proposed by others, and the purely formal and deductive character
of geometry, as well as of other branches of mathematics, has been
thoroughly established since the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Hilbert, through his Grundlagen, became the leading exponent of an
“axiomatic school” of thought that has been influential in fashioning
contemporary attitudes in mathematics and mathematical education. The
GrundlagenopenedwithamottotakenfromKant:“Allhumanknowledge begins with
intuitions, proceeds to concepts, and terminates in ideas,” but
Hilbert’s development of geometry established a decidedly antiKantian
view of the subject. It emphasized that the undefined terms in geometry
should not be assumed to have any properties beyond those indicated in
the axioms. The intuitive-empirical level of the older geometric views
must be disregarded, and points, lines, and planes are to be understood
merely as elements of certain given sets. Set theory, having taken over
algebra and analysis, now was invading geometry. Similarly, the
undefined relations are to be treated as abstractions indicating nothing
more than a correspondence or a mapping.</p>
<p>Like the major papers on algebra and number theory discussed
previously, Hilbert’s research on the elements of geometry was partly
instigated by one of the mathematical meetings of the 1890s that he
attended. In 1891, he had heard and been captivated by a talk that H.
Wiener gave at a scientific meeting in Halle on the possibility of
axiomatizing the rules governing the unions and the intersections of
points and lines without regard to the existing (Euclidean) axioms of
geometry. Following this talk, Hilbert is reputed to have stated the
need for the abstraction of familiar geometric concepts in the form:
“One must at all times be able to replace ‘points, lines, planes’ by
‘tables, chairs, beer mugs.’”</p>
<p>The “Hilbert Problems”</p>
<p>Perhaps no contribution to an international congress has been as
celebrated as the one that Hilbert made in his address to the second
congress, held in Paris in 1900. Hilbert’s talk was titled “Mathematical
Problems.” It consisted of an introduction that has become a classic of
mathematical rhetoric, followed by a list of twenty-three problems
designed to serve as examples of the kind of problem whose treatment
should lead to a furthering of the discipline. In fact, on the advice of
Hurwitz and Minkowski, Hilbert cut the spoken version of the talk so
that it contained only ten of the twenty-three problems. Yet the
complete version of the talk, as well as excerpts, were soon translated
and published in several countries. For example, the 1902 volume of the
Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society carried an authorized
translation by Mary Winston Newson (1869 1959), a specialist in partial
differential equations, who had been the first American woman to obtain
a Ph.D. degree in mathematics at Go¨ttingen. Although Hilbert objected
to the view that the concepts of arithmetic alone are susceptible of a
fully rigorous treatment, he admitted that the development of the
arithmetic continuum by Cauchy, Bolzano, and Cantor was one of the two
most notable achievements of the nineteenth century—the other being the
non-Euclidean geometry of Gauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky—and thus the
first of the twenty-three problems concerned the structure of the real
number continuum. The question is made up of two related parts: (1) is
there a transfinite number between that of a denumerable set and the
number of the continuum; and (2) can the numerical continuum be
considered a well-ordered set? The second part asks whether the totality
of all real numbers can be arranged in another manner so that every
partial assemblage will have a first element. This is closely related to
the axiom of choice named for the German mathematician Ernst Zermelo
(1871 1956), who formulated it in 1904. Zermelo’s axiom asserts that
given any set of mutually exclusive nonempty sets, there exists at least
one set that contains one and only one element in common with each of
the nonempty sets. As an illustration of a problem involving Zermelo’s
axiom, consider the set of all real numbers n such that 0 # n # 1; let
us call two of these real numbers equivalent if their difference is
rational. There obviously are infinitely many classes of equivalent real
numbers. If we form a set S made up of one number from each of these
classes, is S denumerable or nondenumerable? The axiom of choice,
indispensable in analysis, was in 1940 proved by Kurt Go¨del (1906 1978)
to be consistent with other axioms of set theory, but in 1963, it was
demonstrated by Paul Cohen (1934 2007) that the axiom of choice is
independent of the other axioms in a certain system of set theory, thus
showing that the axiom cannot be proved within this system. This seems
to preclude a clear-cut solution to Hilbert’s first problem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s second problem, also suggested by the nineteenth-century
age of rigor, involved the question whether it can be proved that the
axioms of arithmetic are consistent—that a finite number of logical
steps based on them can never lead to contradictory results. A decade
later, there appeared the first volume of Principia mathematica (3
vols., 1910 1913), by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead (1861
1947), the most elaborate attempt up to that time to develop the
fundamental notions of arithmetic from a precise set of axioms. This
work, in the tradition of Leibniz, Boole, and Frege and based on Peano’s
axioms, carried out in minute detail a program intended to prove that
all of pure mathematics can be derived from a small number of
fundamental logical principles. This would justify the view of Russell,
expressed earlier, that mathematics is indistinguishable from logic. But
the system of Russell and Whitehead, not entirely formalized, seems to
have met with more approval among logicians than among mathematicians.
Moreover, the Principia left unanswered the second query of Hilbert.
Efforts to solve this problem led in 1931 to a surprising conclusion on
the part of the young Austrian mathematician Kurt Go¨del. Go¨del showed
that within a rigidly logical system such as Russell and Whitehead had
developed for arithmetic, propositions can be formulated that are
undecidable or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system. That is,
within the system there exist certain clear-cut statements that can be
neither proved nor disproved. Hence, one cannot, using the usual
methods, be certain that the axioms of arithmetic will not lead to
contradictions. In a sense, Go¨del’s theorem, sometimes regarded as the
most decisive result in mathematical logic, seems to dispose negatively
of Hilbert’s second query. In its implications, the discovery by Go¨del
of undecidable propositions is as disturbing as was the disclosure by
Hippasus of incommensurable magnitudes, for it appears to foredoom hope
of mathematical certitude through use of the obvious methods. Perhaps
also doomed, as a result, is the ideal of science—to devise a set of
axioms from which all phenomena of the natural world can be deduced.
Nevertheless, mathematicians and scientists alike have taken the blow in
stride and have continued to pile theorem on theorem at a rate greater
than ever before. Most assuredly, no scholar of today would echo the
assertion of Babbage in 1813 that “The golden age of mathematical
literature is undoubtedly past.”</p>
<p>The problems raised by Go¨del’s theorem have been approached from
outside arithmetic itself through a new aspect of mathematical logic
that arose toward the middle of the twentieth century and is known as
metamathematics. This is not concerned with the symbolism and the
operations of arithmetic but with the interpretation of these signs and
rules. If arithmetic cannot lift itself from the quagmire of possible
inconsistency, perhaps metamathematics, standing outside the arithmetic
bog, can save the day by other means—such as transfinite induction. Some
mathematicians would at least hope for a means of determining, for every
mathematical proposition, whether it is true, false, or undecidable. In
any case, even the discouragingly negative answer to Hilbert’s second
query has thus spurred, rather than daunted, mathematical
creativity.</p>
<p>The next three problems, problems three, four, and five, were among
those omitted at the actual reading of the paper. Problem three was
geometric; it asks to give two tetrahedra of equal basis and equal
height that cannot be decomposed into congruent tetrahedra, either
directly or by adjoining congruent tetrahedra. As Hilbert noted, this
problem goes back to a question raised by Gauss in his correspondence. A
negative answer was provided by a student of Hilbert’s, Max Dehn (1878
1952), in 1902, and clarified by W. F. Kagan in 1903.</p>
<p>Problem four was formulated somewhat broadly; it asked for geometries
whose axioms are “closest” to those of Euclidean geometry if the axioms
of order and incidence are retained, but the congruence axioms are
weakened and the equivalent of the parallel axiom is omitted. The
earliest answer was provided in a doctoral dissertation by G. Hamel,
another Hilbert student.</p>
<p>The fifth problem was to prove more influential and difficult. It
asked whether one could avoid the assumption of differentiability for
the functions defining a continuous transformation group. This problem
came to be closely tied to the early history of topological groups.
Lie’s continuous transformation groups were locally Euclidean with
differentiable operations. As the concept of a topological group was
made the subject of special studies, first by L. E. J. Brouwer (1882
1966), then by Lev Semenovich Pontryagin (1908 1988), the Hilbert
problem was reformulated to apply to the larger realm of topological
groups: Is a locally Euclidean topological group a Lie group? The
problem and related issues occupied numerous topologists until the
1950s. In the 1930s, John von Neumann solved it for bicompact groups;
Pontryagin, for commutative locallybicompactgroups.C.Chevalley(1909
1984)obtainedtheanswer for solvable groups; in 1946, Anatoly Ivanovich
Malcev (1909 1967) solved it for a still wider set of locally bicompact
groups. By now, the problem had become truly international. In 1952,
three Americans, Andrew Gleason (1921 2008), Deane Montgomery (1909
1992), and Leo Zippin (1905 1995), finally obtained the answer for all
locally bicompact groups.</p>
<p>The sixth problem asked for an axiomatization of physics, a subject
to which Hilbert himself devoted some effort.</p>
<p>Problem seven inquired whether the number αβ, where α is algebraic
(and not zero or 1) and β is irrational and algebraic, is
transcendental. In alternative geometric form, Hilbert expressed this by
asking whether in an isosceles triangle, the ratio of the base to a side
is transcendental if the ratio of the vertex angle to the base angles is
algebraic and irrational. This question was disposed of in 1934 when
Aleksander Osipovich Gelfond (1906 1968) proved that Hilbert’s
conjecture, now known as Gelfond’s theorem, was indeed correct—αβ is
transcendental if α is algebraic and neither zero nor 1, and β is
algebraic and not rational. Later, Alan Baker provided a major
generalization to the Gelfond theorem.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s eighth query simply renewed the call, familiar since the
nineteenth century, for a proof of Riemann’s conjecture that the zeros
of the zeta function, except for the negative-integral zeros, all have
real part equal to one half. A proof of this, he felt, might lead to a
proof of the familiar conjecture on the infinity of prime pairs, but no
demonstration has yet been given, although it is more than a century
since Riemann hazarded the guess.</p>
<p>These examples may suffice to indicate the diversity of formulation
and interest of the problems Hilbert chose; let us simply list the
nature of the remaining, which include some of the most intriguing and
have involved a large number of twentieth-century mathematicians.</p>
<p>The ninth problem called for generalizations of the reciprocity laws
of number theory. The tenth was the decision problem for solvability of
Diophantine equations. The eleventh called for extending results
obtained for quadratic fields to arbitrary algebraic fields. The twelfth
asked for an extension of a theorem by Kronecker to arbitrary algebraic
fields.</p>
<p>These number-theoretic problems were followed by the thirteenth,
which asked to show the impossibility of solving the general
seventhdegree equation by functions of two variables; the fourteenth
problem asked about the finiteness of systems of relatively integral
functions; the fifteenth asked for a justification for Hermann
Schubert’s (1848 1911) enumerative geometry.</p>
<p>The sixteenth problem was an invitation to develop a topology of real
algebraic curves and surfaces. The seventeenth asked for the
representation of definite forms by squares; the eighteenth posed the
challenge to build spaces with congruent polyhedra. The nineteenth deals
with the analytic character of solutions of variational problems.
Closely related to this was the twentieth, concerned with general
boundary problems. The twenty-first, which Hilbert himself solved in
1905, asked for the solution of differential equations with a given
monodromy group. The twentysecond was the uniformization problem, and
the final, twenty-third, problem asked for an extension of the methods
of the calculus of variations; in recent years, this has been tied to
research in optimization questions.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h2>
<p>Hilbert’s chief contributions to analysis fall in the period between
1900 and World War I. They revolve primarily around the study of
integral equations. His contributions to this subject were preceded,
however, by his “revival” of the Dirichlet principle. As previously
noted, the criticism of the Dirichlet principle had been followed by
only partially successful attempts to show its validity. The last major
effort in this direction had been published by Poincare in 1890, in a
paper containing´ his ingenious “sweeping-out” (balayage) method.
Hilbert proceeded to establish the Dirichlet principle in its most
general form by treating it as a problem in the calculus of variations.
First, he sketched a constructive proof of the existence of minimal
curves; then he showed how the existence of a function minimizing the
Dirichlet region for plane regions could be inferred. This memoir was
followed by a very readable Weierstrassian review of the problem by the
American W. F. Osgood (1864 1943) the following year; in 1904, Hilbert
himself elaborated on his argument in a more detailed paper.</p>
<p>It was during this period, in 1901, that the subject of integral
equations captured Hilbert’s attention. One of his Scandinavian students
presented a seminar report on work done in that field by his professor
in Stockholm, Ivar Fredholm (1866 1927). Hilbert’s results, first
published between 1904 and 1910, were collected in a book that appeared
in 1912 and was designed to present a systematic theory of linear
integral equations. His work was streamlined by Erhard Schmidt (1876
1959). What is interesting in following Hilbert’s progress of the
subject is the interplay between his often rough new approaches and
refinements and generalizations brought to bear by others. Indeed, the
great value of this work nowadays lies in the fact that from it came
many of the twentieth century’s most important ideas basic to the study
of abstract linear spaces and spectra.</p>
<p>Waring’s Problem and Hilbert’s Work after 1909</p>
<p>Perhaps as relief from his rather cumbersome work in integral
equations, Hilbert during this time returned to number theory and proved
Waring’s theorem that every positive integer can be represented as a sum
of at most m nth powers, m being a function of n. This triumph, tempered
by the unexpected death of his good friend Minkowski in 1909, marks the
end of the period during which Hilbert produced his most concentrated,
purely mathematical work.</p>
<p>Hilbert spent much of the next decade on mathematical physics. Until
the beginning of World War I, he studied the application of integral
equations to physical theories such as the kinetic theory of gases. With
the appearance of Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity,
Hilbert turned to that subject, which also occupied his colleague Felix
Klein. Interestingly, the most lasting mathematical contribution out of
this effort came from an algebraist who had recently engaged in studies
of differential invariants. This was Emmy Noether (1888 1935), the
daughter of the algebraic geometer Max Noether, whom Hilbert and Klein
brought to Go¨ttingen to assist them in this research. Her results were
published in 1918; best known is “Noether’s theorem,” which is still
referred to in the discussion of correspondences between certain
invariants and conservation laws.</p>
<p>Hilbert had initiated his studies in mathematical physics in the hope
of proceeding to the axiomatization for which he had called in 1900. He
came closest to this goal in his last work on physics, dealing with
quantum mechanics. Because Hilbert had begun to have serious health
problems by this time, this research was conducted in collaboration with
two younger men, L. Nordheim and J. von Neumann.</p>
<p>Hilbert’s major results in his last great effort at the
axiomatization of arithmetic and logic have come to us in the form given
to them by his successors, too. They are contained in the comprehensive
treatises Grundlagen der Mathematik and Grundzu¨geder mathematischen
Logik,betterknown by the names of the coauthors as Hilbert-Bernays and
Hilbert-Ackermann.</p>
<h4 id="integration-and-measure">Integration and Measure</h4>
<p>Toward the end of the nineteenth century, the emphasis on rigor had
led numerous mathematicians to bring forth examples of
“pathological”</p>
<p>Int e grat ion and Me a sur e</p>
<p>functions that, because of some unusual property, violated a theorem
previously held to be generally valid. There was concern among some
distinguished analysts that a preoccupation with such special cases
would divert younger mathematicians from seeking answers to the major
open questions of the day. Hermite said that he turned away “with fright
and horror from this lamentable plague of functions which have no
derivatives.” Poincare shared his teacher’s concern:´</p>
<p>Formerly, when one invented a new function it was in view of some
practical goal; today one invents them expressly to point out flaws in
the reasoning of our fathers and one will never derive anything from
them but that. (Translated from a quotation in Saks, 1964)</p>
<p>Yet through the study of unusual cases and the questioning of their
elders, two younger French mathematicians arrived at the definitions of
concepts that were to be fundamental to the development of some of the
most general theories of twentieth-century mathematics. Henri Lebesgue
(1875 1941) had had the usual type of mathematical training, although he
had shown exceptional irreverence in questioning statements made by his
professors and supplemented his course work with library studies,
including the work of Camille Jordan (1838 1922) and Rene´ Baire (1874
1934), among others. His dissertation, accepted in 1902, was most
unusual in virtually remaking the field of integration. His work was so
great a departure from accepted views that Lebesgue, like Cantor, at
first was assailed by both external criticism and internal self-doubt,
but the value of his views was increasingly recognized, and in 1910, he
was appointed to the Sorbonne. He did not create a “school of thought,”
however, nor did he concentrate on the field that he had opened.
Although his concept of the integral was in itself a striking case of
generalization, Lebesgue feared that “Reduced to general theories,
mathematics would be a beautiful form without content. It would quickly
die.” Later developments seem to indicate that his fears concerning the
baneful influence of generality in mathematics were without
foundation.</p>
<p>The Riemann integral had dominated studies in integration before
Lebesgue became the “Archimedes of the extension period.” But toward the
close of the nineteenth century, studies in trigonometric series and the
Mengenlehre of Cantor had made mathematicians more keenly aware that the
essential idea in functionality should be a pointwise correspondence or
“mapping” in the newer sense and not smoothness of variation. Cantor had
even struggled with notions of measurable sets, but under his
definition, the measure of the union of two sets could be less than the
sum of the measures of the sets. Defects in Cantor’s definition were
removed by E´mile Borel (1871 1956), the immediate predecessor of
Lebesgue in studies on measure theory.</p>
<p>Borel, from 1909 until 1941 the holder of a chair for theory of
functions at the Sorbonne and, from 1921, a chair in probability and
mathematical physics, was also a multifaceted administrator. He
succeeded Jules Tannery as deputy director of the E´cole Normale
Superieure, a´ position he held for ten years; in the 1920s, he founded
the Institute for Statistics at the University of Paris and, in 1929,
the Institut Henri Poincare. Having served in the military and run a
government office´ during World War I at the request of Painleve, he
returned to public´ service as member of the Chamber of Deputies from
1925 to 1936, championed the European Union, and served as minister of
the navy until his arrest in 1940 under the Vichy regime. His record in
mathematical publication before 1924 had been impressive and included
more than half a dozen books. One of the earlier volumes had been on an
unusual theme: Lec¸ons sur les series divergentes´ (1901). Here, the
author showed how for some divergent series, a “sum” can be defined that
will make sense in relationships and operations involving such series.
For example, if the series is Σun, then a “sum” can be defined as
x0exΣN0 unxn=n!dx if this integral exists. During the first decades of
this Ðcentury, there was lively interest in such definitions, but
Borel’s more lasting influence was in the application of the theory of
sets to the theory of functions, where his name is recalled in the
familiar Heine-Borel theorem:</p>
<p>If a closed set of points on a line can be covered by a set of
intervals so that every point of the set is an interior point of at
least one of the intervals, then there exists a finite number of
intervals with this covering property.</p>
<p>In somewhat different terminology, this theorem had been expressed by
Heine in 1872, but it had been overlooked until reenunciated in 1895 by
Borel. Borel’s name is also attached to any set that can be obtained
from closed and open sets on the real line by repeated applications of
the operations of union and intersection to denumerable numbers of sets.
Any Borel set is a measurable set in his sense.</p>
<p>Lebesgue, pondering Borel’s work on sets, saw that Riemann’s
definition of the integral has the drawback of applying only in
exceptional cases, for it assumes not more than a few points of
discontinuity in the function. If a function y5f(x) has many points of
discontinuity, then, as the interval xi1 1 2xi becomes smaller, values
of f(xi1 1) and f(xi) do not necessarily become closer together. Instead
of subdividing the domain of the independent variable, Lebesgue
therefore subdivided the range f 2 f of the function into subintervals
Δyi and within each subinterval selected a value ηi. Then, he found the
“measure” m(Ei) of the set Ei of points on the x-axis for which values
of f(x) are approximately equal to ηi. As Lebesgue liked to express the
difference informally, the earlier</p>
<p>Int e grat ion and Me a sur e</p>
<p>integrators had added indivisibles, large or small, in order from
left to right, whereas he preferred to group together indivisibles of
comparable size before adding. That is, for the earlier Riemann sums
Sn5Σ fðxiÞΔxi he substituted the Lebesgue-type sum Sn5ηimðEiÞ and then
let the intervals tend toward zero.</p>
<p>The Lebesgue integral that we have here very roughly described is in
actuality defined far more precisely in terms of upper and lower bounds
and the Lebesgue measure of a set; an illustrative example may suggest
how the Lebesgue procedures operate. Let it be granted that the Lebesgue
measure of all rational numbers in the interval 〔0,1〕 is zero and that
the Lebesgue measure of all irrational numbers in this interval is 1;
let the integral of f(x) be required over this interval, where f(x) is
zero for all rational values of x and f(x) is 1 for all irrational
values of x. Inasmuch as m(Ei)50 for all values of i except i5n, where
ηn 51, we have Sn 501 01 η1 nm(En)51151; hence, the Lebesgue integral is
1. The Riemann integral of the same function over the same interval does
not, of course, exist.</p>
<p>The word “measure” can take on various meanings. When Lebesgue
presented his new concept of the integral, he used the word in the
specific sense now known as the Lebesgue measure. This was an extension
of classical notions of length and area to sets more general than those
associated with the usual curves and surfaces. Today the word “measure”
is used more broadly still, a measure on a field R being simply a
nonnegative function μ with the property μðUAiÞ5ΣμðAiÞ for every
countable disjoint class Ai contained in R. Not only does the new
concept of integral cover a wider class of functions than does that of
Riemann, but the inverse relationship between differentiation and
integration (in Lebesgue’s generalized sense) is subject to fewer
exceptions. For example, if g(x) is differentiable in 〔a, b〕 and if gu
(x)5f(x) is bounded, then f(x) is Lebesgue integrable and gðxÞ2gðaÞ5LÐxa
fðtÞdt, whereas with theRÐ ð Þ same restrictions on g(x) and gu(x) the
Riemann integral xa f t dt might not even exist.</p>
<p>Lebesgue’s ideas date from the closing years of the nineteenth
century, but they became widely known through his two classic treatises:
Lec¸ons sur les series trigonometriques´ (1903) and Lec¸ons sur
l’integration´ et la recherche des fonctions primitives (1904). The
revolutionary views they contained paved the way for further
generalizations. Among these are the Denjoy integral and the Haar
integral, proposed by a Frenchman, Arnaud Denjoy (1884 1974), and a
Hungarian, Alfred Haar (1885 1933), respectively. Another well-known
integral of the twentieth century is the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, a
combination of the ideas of Lebesgue and the Dutch analyst T.-J.
Stieltjes (1856 1894). The work of these men and others so altered the
concept of the integral, through generalization, that it has been said
that although integration is as old as the time of Archimedes, “the
theory of integration was a creation of the twentieth century.” Word of
the new theory spread. For example, N. N. Luzin (1883 1950), who had
spent most of his time during the years 1910 1914 in Go¨ttingen,
introduced many of the new ideas to Moscow on his return.</p>
<p>Functional Analysis and GeneralTopology</p>
<p>The new theories of integration were closely allied with another
pronounced characteristic of the twentieth century: the rapid growth of
point set topology. At the University of Paris, Maurice Frechet (1878´
1973), in his doctoral dissertation of 1906, showed clearly that
function theory no longer could do without a very general view of set
theory. What Frechet had in mind were not necessarily sets of numbers
but sets of´ elements of arbitrary nature, such as curves or points; on
such arbitrary sets, he built a “functional calculus,” in which a
functional operation is defined on a set E when to each element A of E
there corresponds a numerically determined value U(A). His interest was
not in a particular instance of a set E, but in those set-theoretical
results that are independent of the nature of the set elements. In this
very broad calculus, the notion of limit is much broader than limits as
previously defined, the latter being included in the former as special
cases, just as the Lebesgue integral includes the integrals of Riemann
and Cauchy. Probably no aspect of twentieth-century mathematics stands
out more clearly than does the ever-greater degree of generalization and
abstraction. From the time of Hilbert and Frechet, the notions of
abstract set and abstract´ space have been fundamental in research.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Hilbert and Frechet came to their
gen-´ eralizations of the concept of space from somewhat differing
directions. Hilbert had become interested, as had Poincare, in the study
of integral´ equations, especially through the work of Ivar Fredholm
(1866 1927). In a sense, an integral equation can be considered an
extension of a system of n equations in n unknowns to a system of
infinitely many equations in infinitely many unknowns, a topic that had
been touched on, in the form of infinite determinants, by Helge von Koch
(1870 1924). As Hilbert worked in integral equations from 1904 to 1910,
he did not explicitly refer to infinite dimensional spaces, but he did
develop the concept of continuity of a function of infinitely many
variables. To what extent Hilbert formally constructed the “space” that
later was named for him may be a moot point, but the basic ideas were
there, and their impact on the mathematical world was great. His work on
integral equations was soon extended to more general functions and
abstract spaces by Friedrich Riesz (1880 1956) and Ernst Fischer (1875
1959).</p>
<p>During the years that Hilbert was concerned with integral equations,
Jacques Hadamard was doing research in the calculus of variations,
and</p>
<p>F unc t ional A nal y s i s and General Top olo g y</p>
<p>his student Frechet consciously sought in 1906 to generalize the
methods´ in this field through what he called functional calculus.
Whereas the ordinary calculus deals with functions, the functional
calculus concerns functionals. Whereas a function is a correspondence
between a set S1 of numbers and another set S2 of numbers, a functional
is a correspondence between a class C1 of functions and another class C2
of functions. Frechet´ formulated generalized definitions, corresponding
roughly to terms such as “limit,” “derivative,” and “continuity” in the
ordinary calculus, applicable to the function spaces he thus created, to
a considerable extent introducing a new vocabulary for the new
situation. Shortly thereafter, this would intrigue the group of young
Russians about to put their own stamp on the evolving subject of
topology; that includes the Luzin students P. S. Aleksandrov (1896
1982), Pavel Uryson (1898 1924), and A. N. Kolmogorov (1903 1987).</p>
<p>Topology is said by some to have begun with the analysis situs of
Poincare; others claim that it dates from the set theory of Cantor or
per-´ haps from the development of abstract spaces. Still others regard
Brouwer as the founder of topology, especially for his topological
invariance theorems of 1911 and for his fusion of the methods of Cantor
with those of analysis situs. At all events, with Brouwer there began
the period of intensive evolution of topology that has continued to the
present day. During this “golden age” of topology, American
mathematicians have been conspicuous contributors. It has been said that
“topology began as much geometry and little algebra, but that now it is
much algebra and little geometry.” Whereas once topology could be
described as geometry without measurement, algebraic topology came to
dominate the field, a change that resulted largely from leadership in
the United States.</p>
<p>Hermann Weyl (1885 1955), lecturing on Riemann surfaces at
Go¨ttingen, also emphasized the abstract nature of a surface, or a
“twodimensional manifold,” as he preferred to call it. The concept of a
manifold, he asserted, should not be tied to a point space (in the usual
geometric sense) but given broader meaning. We merely begin with a
collection of things called “points” (which can be any objects
whatsoever) and introduce a concept of continuity through appropriate
definition. The classical formulation of this view was given a year
later by Felix Hausdorff (1868 1942), the “high priest” of point set
topology. The first portion of Hausdorff’s Grundzu¨ge der Mengenlehre
(Basic Features of Set Theory) of 1914 is a systematic exposition of the
characteristic features of set theory, where the nature of elements is
of no consequence; only the relations among the elements are important.
In the latter portion of the book, we find a clear-cut development of
“Hausdorff topological spaces” from a set of axioms. By a topological
space, the author understands a set E of elements x and certain subsets
Sx known as neighborhoods of x. The neighborhoods are assumed to satisfy
the following four “Hausdorff axioms”:</p>
<p>1.To each point x there corresponds at least one neighborhood U(x),
and each neighborhood U(x) contains the point x.</p>
<p>2.If U(x) and V(x) are two neighborhoods of the same point x, there
must exist a neighborhood W(x) that is a subset of both.</p>
<p>3.If the point y lies in U(x), there must exist a neighborhood U/(y)
that is a subset of U(x).</p>
<p>4.For two different points x and y, there are two neighborhoods U(x)
and U(y) with no points in common.</p>
<p>Neighborhoods, as so defined, permitted Hausdorff to introduce the
concept of continuity. Through additional axioms, he developed the
properties of various more restricted spaces, such as the Euclidean
plane.</p>
<p>If any one book marks the emergence of point set topology as a
separate discipline, it is Hausdorff’s Grundzu¨ge. It is interesting to
note that although it was the arithmetization of analysis that began the
train of thought that led from Cantor to Hausdorff, in the end the
concept of number is thoroughly submerged under a far more general point
of view. Moreover, although the word “point” is used in the title, the
new subject had as little to do with the points of ordinary geometry as
with the numbers of common arithmetic. This was underlined by Zygmunt
Janiszewski (1888 1920), Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1888 1945), and the
indefatigable Waclaw Sierpinski (1882 1969), the founders, in 1920, of
Fundamenta Mathematicae. When the journal that seemed at times to carry
nothing but contributions to point set topology was resurrected after
World War II, the cover noted that it was devoted to set theory,
mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics, topology and its
interactions with algebra, and dynamical systems. Here and elsewhere,
topology came to the fore in the twentieth century as one of the
subjects that appeared to unify almost the whole of mathematics,
providing it with an unexpected cohesiveness.</p>
<h2 id="algebra-3">Algebra</h2>
<p>The high degree of formal abstraction that had found its way into
analysis, geometry, and topology in the early twentieth century could
not help but invade algebra. The result was a new type of algebra,
sometimes inadequately described as “modern algebra,” largely a product
of the third decade of the century. It is indeed true that a gradual
process of generalization in algebra had developed during the nineteenth
century, but in the twentieth century, the degree of abstraction took a
sharp turn upward. For example, in 1903, the American Leonard Eugene
Dickson (1874 1954), E. H. Moore’s first student, published an axiomatic
definition of a linear</p>
<h2 id="algebra-4">Algebra</h2>
<p>associative algebra over an abstract field. Next, Dickson, J. H. M.
Wedderburn (1882 1948), who spent the year 1904 1905 in Chicago, and
others published a series of papers dealing with various aspects of
hypercomplexnumbersystemsandfinitealgebras.Thebestknownoftheseisone by
Wedderburn, in which he abstracted his subject from dependence on a
specific number field, thereby takingit beyondthe work done by
Frobenius, Theodor Molien (1861 1941), and Elie Cartan (1869 1951) on
the Continent. Wedderburn here presented his influential structure
theorems. These state the following:</p>
<p>1.Any algebra can be expressed as the sum of a nilpotent and
asemisimple algebra.</p>
<p>2.Any semisimple algebra that is not simple is the direct sum of
simplealgebras.</p>
<p>3.Any simple algebra is the direct product of a primitive algebra and
asimple matrix algebra.</p>
<p>Another paper of great influence in the trend to abstraction was
Ernst Steinitz’s (1871 1928) work on the algebraic theory of fields,
which appeared in the winter of 1909 1910 and had been motivated by Kurt
Hensel’s (1861 1941) work on p-adic fields. Analogous work in ring
theory was first undertaken by A. Fraenkel (1891 1965), who had been a
student of Hensel’s. Following his work, Emmy Noether, in 1921,
transferred decomposition theorems for ideals in algebraic number fields
to those for ideals in arbitrary rings. On the basis of this work,
Wolfgang Krull (1899 1971) published a series of papers on the algebraic
theory of rings, in which he carried out the analogy to Steinitz’s
memoir on fields. Noether and her students made other major
contributions to ring theory before she turned to a treatment of finite
group representations from an ideal-theoretic point of view. By now,
Noether’s work and that of her students overlapped with related work of
Richard Brauer (1901</p>
<p>1977), Emil Artin (1898 1962), B. L. van der Waerden (1903 1996), and
Helmut Hasse (1898 1979). Simultaneously, Wedderburn and the American
school continued their generalizations. Against this background of
increased activity in abstract ring theory and hypercomplex systems
theory, Artin published a generalization of the Wedderburn structure
theorems to rings satisfying chain conditions. Chain conditions had been
used since the days of Otto Ho¨lder (1859 1937) and Dedekind but were
brought to the fore in the 1921 paper of Emmy Noether just mentioned.
Through Noether’s influence, these algebraic notions were linked to
topology in the work of Heinz Hopf (1894 1971) and Pavel Aleksandrov,
both of whom had obtained their topological orientation from L. E. J.
Brouwer.</p>
<p>Differential Geometry andTensorAnalysis</p>
<p>Early-twentieth-century differential geometry would make an
interesting case study for examining the impact of external forces on
changing attitudes toward a branch of mathematics. The joint papers of
Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro (1853 1925) and Tullio Levi-Civita (1873 1941)
on Ricci-Curbastro’s absolute calculus provided a fitting summary of
late-nineteenth-century accomplishments in differential geometry. The
subject had reached a certain plateau; workers in the field made minor
contributions, interesting alternatives were formulated, and complex
computational results were modified and simplified—yet altogether it was
a field apparently doomed to be of interest only to the specialist. This
changed dramatically after the announcement by Albert Einstein (1879
1955) of his theory of general relativity. In 1915, he presented the
discovery of his gravitational equations by noting that it marked “a
true triumph of the methods of the general differential calculus founded
by Gauss, Riemann, Christoffel, Ricci” (Sitzungsbericht der Preussischen
Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1915:778 786).</p>
<p>Interest in the general theory of relativity led to a spate of
publications designed to clarify or expand both the theory of general
relativity and differential geometry. In 1916, the German set theorist
Gerhard Hessenberg (1874 1925) had introduced the concept of a
connection. Levi-Civita introduced his concept of parallelism in 1917
and, in the early 1920s, lectured at the University of Rome on the
subject that he continued to call the absolute differential calculus; he
published a systematic exposition in 1923. Just one year earlier, Dirk
Struik (1894 2000), a student of, and a collaborator with, the Dutch
differential geometer J. A. Schouten (1883 1971), had issued a volume on
the elements of multidimensional differential geometry; it was followed
in 1924 by a treatise on the Ricci-Curbastro calculus by Schouten
himself. Simultaneously, a group of books by mathematicians and
physicists appeared that combined the exposition of known principles
with new contributions to the physical interpretation and the
mathematical theory. Among the best known of these works published
between 1916 and 1925 were those by the Americans G. D. Birkhoff and R.
D. Carmichael (1879 1967), the Englishman A. S. Eddington (1882 1944),
and the Germans Max von Laue and Hermann Weyl. Although some of these
volumes were brilliant examples of exposition, treating as clearly as
possible a subject the mathematical basis of which was wrapped up in a
cumbersome theory, their very popularity among the scientifically and
philosophically oriented reading public did much to spread the notion of
the incomprehensibility of mathematics and mathematical physics. For
more than a generation, relatively few mathematicians were aware that
the seeds of a new approach to differential geometry had already been
sown.</p>
<p>P r ob abili t y</p>
<p>When Hermann Weyl left his position as privatdozent in Go¨ttingen in
1913 to accept a professorship at the University of Zurich, he had just
completed a period of immersion in the mathematics of Riemann. In the
winter of 1911 1912, he had lectured on Riemann’s function theory; his
stated theme was to base Riemann’s work not on “visualizable
plausibility” but on set-theoretically exact proofs meeting requirements
of rigor. The outgrowth of this was Weyl’s classic book on the concept
of the Riemann surface, completed in April 1913. New concepts and
definitions, such as the introductory one of a complex manifold, made
this small work basic to much subsequent research on manifolds. Weyl
spent more time on Riemannian geometry after his move to Zurich and
during World War I. He explored the concept of a linear connection,
thinking for some time that linking this to the group of similitudes
might result in a unified field theory. A set of classical papers on the
theory of linear representations of Lie groups written in the mid-1920s
was partially an outgrowth of this work. In the meantime, Elie Cartan,
who had begun his career with the study of Lie groups, revamped
differential geometry.</p>
<p>Cartan, early in his research work, had developed the calculus of
exterior differential forms. He shaped it into a powerful tool that he
applied to differential geometry, as well as to many other areas of
mathematics. In his approach to differential geometry, he expanded the
nineteenth-century notion of a “moving frame” that had been used by
Gaston Darboux 1842 1917), among others. His main achievements were
based on the use of two concepts he fashioned: One was his definition of
a connection, which was widely adopted by differential geometers. The
other was the notion of a symmetric Riemann space. In such a space, each
point is assumed to be surrounded by a symmetry, that is, a certain
distance-preserving transformation that leaves the point fixed. Cartan
had earlier succeeded in classifying simple real Lie algebras and in
determining the irreducible linear representations of simple Lie
algebras. It turns out that the classification of simple Lie groups can
be applied to the description of symmetric Riemann spaces.</p>
<p>Among Cartan’s contribution to other areas of mathematics, we note
only his important work in the theory of differential systems. Here,
too, he was able to abstract the traditional problem from a choiceof
variables or functions, by defining a truly “general” solution of an
abstract system. He then turned his attention to seeking all singular
solutions; this work was completed by Masatake Kuranishi four years
after Cartan’s death.</p>
<h4 id="probability-4">Probability</h4>
<p>Set theory and measure theory during the twentieth century invaded an
ever-widening portion of mathematics, and few branches have been as
thoroughly influenced by the trend as has the theory of probability, to
which Borel had contributed his E´lements de la theorie des probabilit´
es´ (1909). The opening year of the new century was auspicious for
probability, both in physics and in genetics, for in 1901, Josiah
Willard Gibbs published his Elementary Principles in Statistical
Mechanics, and in the same year, Biometrika was founded by Karl Pearson
(1857 1936). Francis Galton (1822 1911), a precocious cousin of Charles
Darwin and a born statistician, had studied regression phenomena; in
1900, Pearson, the Galton Professor of Eugenics at the University of
London, had popularized the chi-square test. One of Poincare’s titles
had been´ “Professor of the Calculus of Probabilities,” indicating the
rising interest in the subject.</p>
<p>InRussia,thestudyoflinkedchainsofeventswasinitiated,especiallyin 1906
1907,byA.A.Markov(1856 1922),astudentofChebyshev’sand the coeditor of
his teacher’s Oeuvres (2 vols., 1899 1904). In the kinetic theory of
gases and in many social and biological phenomena, the probability of an
event often depends on preceding outcomes, and especially since the
middle of the twentieth century, Markov chains of linked probabilities
have been widely studied. As mathematical foundations for the expanding
theory of probability were sought, statisticians found the appropriate
tool at hand, and today no rigorous presentation of probability theory
is possible without using the notions of measurable functions and modern
theories of integration. In Russia, for example, Kolmogorov made
important advances in Markov processes (1931) and satisfied in part
Hilbert’s sixth project, calling for axiomatic foundations of
probability, through the use of Lebesgue measure theory. Classical
analysis had been concerned with continuous functions, whereas
probability problems generally involve discrete cases. Measure theory
and the extensions of the integration concept were ideally suited to
bring about a closer association
ofanalysisandprobability,especiallyafterthemiddleofthecentury,when
Laurent Schwartz (1915 2002) of Nancy and Paris generalized the concept
of differentiation through the theory of distributions (1950 1951).</p>
<p>The Dirac delta function of atomic physics had shown that the
pathological functions that had long occupied mathematicians were also
useful in science. In the more difficult cases, however,
differentiability breaks down, with resulting problems in the solution
of differential equations—one of the chief connecting links between
mathematics and physics, especially where singular solutions are
involved. To surmount this difficulty, Schwartz introduced a broader
view of differentiability, one made possible by the development, in the
first half of the century, of general vector spaces by Stefan Banach
(1892 1945), Frechet, and´ others. A linear vector space is a set of
elements a, b, c,…satisfying certain conditions, especially including
the requirement that if a and b are elements of L, and if α and β are
complex numbers, then αa1 βb is an element of L. If the elements of L
are functions, the linear vector</p>
<p>B ound s and A ppr o x imat ions</p>
<p>space is called a linear space, and a mapping of this case is called
a linear functional. By a “distribution,” Schwartz meant a linear and
continuous functional on the space of functions that are differentiable
and that satisfy certain other conditions. The Dirac measure, for
example, is a special case of a distribution. Schwartz then developed an
appropriate definition of the derivative of a distribution such that the
derivative of a distribution is always itself a distribution. This
provides a powerful generalization of the calculus, with immediate
applications to probability theory and physics.</p>
<p>Bounds and Approximations</p>
<p>While observing the growth of abstraction and generality during the
early twentieth century, it is easy to overlook the fact that this was
also a period of increased activity in the development of numerical
techniques designed to assist in solving problems that withstood direct
attack with closed form expressions. One of the best-known examples is
the Kutta-Runge method for the solution of differential equations known
since the first decade of the
twentiethcentury.ThestrongestoftheKutta-Rungealgorithmsprovedtobe
superior to many of the more recent competitors that flourished after
numerical analysis gained new prominence because of the advent of
automatic computing. Similarly, numerous approximations and bound
calculations in number theory that were achieved in the first three
decades of the century would be superseded only decades later.</p>
<p>A significant number of studies dealt with bounds for minimal forms,
a subject to whichHermite hadcalled attention;it washe who gave an upper
bound for the minimum of an n-ary form with a given determinant that is
fixed—and to which A. N. Korkin (1837 1908) and Egor Zolotarev (1847
1878) made significant contributions, which in turn inspired Markov, who
had studied with them as well as with Chebyshev at St. Petersburg.
Markov had won a gold medal for a paper on the integration of
differential equations by continued fractions and two years later, in
1880, wrote a highly acclaimed thesis on binary quadratic forms with
positive determinant. Intrigued by the research emanating from the
St. Petersburg group—Markov’s thesis had been published in the
Mathematische Annalen—Frobenius wrote a number of papers that built on
Markov’s work; in addition, several of Frobenius’s students made
important contributions to this area of research. The problem Markov
addressed of finding a lower bound for an indefinite binary quadratic
form provides a goodexample. In several papers published in 1913,
Frobenius showedthat
incontrasttoMarkov,hecouldobtainmostofMarkov’sresultswithoutthe use of
continued fractions. The one case that had eluded Frobenius was
resolvedbyRobertRemak(1888 1942)by1924.InhisstudyofMarkov’s problem,
Issai Schur (1875 1941) in 1913 had relied on minimal forms in a way
that Remak now used, along with Frobenius’s successful results. Having
completely rid the solution of Markov’s problem from continued
fractions, Remak in 1925 first proved strictly arithmetically a number
of related theorems and then provided a geometric interpretation of the
results obtained by Markov, Frobenius, and himself.</p>
<p>Another major impetus to studies of bounds and approximations
emanated from Hermann Minkowski. In his Habilitationsschrift of 1886, he
had discussed minima of positive definite quadratic forms. The notions
found in this work would be elaborated in his Diophantische
Approximationen of 1907 and his posthumous Geometrie der Zahlen (1910).
Edmund Landau (1877 1938), Minkowski’s successor at Go¨tttingen,
although a student of Frobenius’s, was primarily interested in analytic
number theory. In 1903, he produced a simplified proof of the prime
number theorem; in 1909, his magnum opus, a two-volume handbook
concerning the distribution of primes, was published. Yet in 1918, he
was to obtain the first estimation of units and regulators in algebraic
number fields. He used a procedure Remak had developed (without use of
continued fractions) in a 1913 paper that contained numerical bounds for
the equation t2 2Du251, along with Minkowski’s theorem concerning linear
forms. Landau, like Minkowski before him, did not shy away from using
ideal theory in these studies. Neither did he avoid analytic supports
where necessary; thus, in one of the 1918 papers, he made free use of
the functional equation of Dedekind’s zeta-function that Hecke had
brought forth the previous year. On the other hand, Remak, who would
excel in the estimation of units and regulators in the years to come,
strove for purely arithmetic proofs and eschewed idealtheoretic, as well
as analytic tools.</p>
<p>Three men who freely used analytic tools were G. H. Hardy (1877</p>
<p>1947), J. E. Littlewood (1885 1977), and the autodidactic Indian
genius Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887 1920). In the second decade of the
century, Hardy and Littlewood began their well-known collaboration on
numerical partitions. During the time that he spent with them in
England, Ramanujan and Hardy produced a joint paper on asymptotic values
of p(n), where p(n) is the number of partitions of an integer n into
summands. Ramanujan had previously made a number of conjectures
concerning p(n), based on numerical data for small n; he had also proved
some of his guesses using elliptic functions. In the joint paper, he
suggested an asymptotic formula for p(n) that, as Hans Rademacher (1892
1969) would subsequently prove, actually led to an exact value for
n.</p>
<p>The activities just outlined are of interest not only for the
specific results they produced but because of the competition among the
various participants to demonstrate the superiority, or at least the
usefulness, of their particular technique, whether arithmetic,
algebraic, analytic—singly or in combination. This would eventually shed
additional light on many underlying structural relationships.</p>
<p>T he 1930 s and Wor ld War II</p>
<p>The1930s andWorldWar II</p>
<p>The rise to power of Hitler and the National Socialist Party in
Germany precipitated a catastrophe that soon affected mathematical
institutions around the world. In the spring of 1933, numerous
professors were dismissed from German universities. This and the
subsequent more serious actions taken against individuals of Jewish
background or opposing political beliefs resulted in a vast migration of
scholars from Germany or German-occupied countries, as well as in the
deaths of many who remained. It also resulted in the diminution of some
of the most established mathematical centers of Western and Central
Europe. Attempted purges of mathematicians in the Soviet Union similarly
stifled growth in a number of the younger centers of activity. Some of
the most severe institutional and individual losses occurred in Poland
with the closing of the universities after 1939, the destruction of the
University of Warsaw’s mathematical collections, the deportation of
nearly 200 faculty members from the Jagellonian University in Krakow,
and the planned killing of professors in Lvov in July 1941.</p>
<p>A substantial number of European mathematicians came to the United
States. Among the best known were Hermann Weyl and the algebraists Emil
Artin, Richard Brauer, and Emmy Noether; the analysts Richard Courant
and Jacques Hadamard; the probability specialist William Feller; the
statistician Jerzy Neyman; the logicians Kurt Go¨del and Alfred Tarski;
and the historian of mathematics Otto Neugebauer, to name but a few.
There were mathematicians not subject to persecution who left
professional life, often at the beginning of their careers, to avoid
institutional or organizational affiliations that were incompatible with
their moral beliefs; a few reemerged after World War II. On the other
hand, recalling only three of the multitude who did not escape,
Hausdorff committed suicide to avoid deportation; Otto Blumenthal,
Hilbert’s first Ph.D. student, died in Theresienstadt; and Stanislaw
Saks, the noted contributor to twentieth-century integration theory, was
killed in Warsaw.</p>
<p>The relocation of mathematicians who found refuge resulted in the
infusion of new ideas in many mathematical centers. This presented a
challenge both to those confronted with new concepts and those
attempting to superimpose them on existing systems. Mathematicians were
equally challenged by new problems encountered in World War II.
Especially important at that time were the needs in applied mathematics.
Table computations and the methodology of operations research are but
two examples of areas that redirected the attention of many
mathematicians who had been trained in entirely different fields.
Nevertheless, most of the enormous development during the twenty years
following World War II was spurred on by problems within pure
mathematics itself, yet within the same period, the applications of
mathematics to science multiplied exceedingly.</p>
<h4 id="nicolas-bourbaki">Nicolas Bourbaki</h4>
<p>Mathematics of the twentieth century saw an emphasis on abstraction
and an increasing concern with the analysis of broad patterns. Perhaps
nowhere is this more clearly apparent than in the mid-twentieth-century
works that emanated from the polycephalic mathematician known as Nicolas
Bourbaki. This is a nonexistent Frenchman with a Greek name that has
appeared on the title pages of several dozen volumes in a continuing
major work, E´lements de math´ ematique´ , that was intended to survey
all of worthwhile mathematics. The home of Bourbaki is given as Nancy, a
city that provided a number of leading twentieth-century mathematicians.
In Nancy, there is a statue to the colorful and oncevery-real General
Charles Denis Sauter Bourbaki (1816 1897), who in 1862 was offered, but
declined, the throne of Greece and whose role in the Franco-Prussian War
was very tangible. Nicolas Bourbaki, nevertheless, is not a relative in
any sense of the word; the name was simply appropriated to designate a
group of anonymous mathematicians, almost exclusively French. As an
institutional connection, N. Bourbaki sometimes used the University of
Nancago, a playful reference to the fact that two of the moving spirits
within the group were for a while connected with universities in the
Chicago area—Andre Weil at the University of´ Chicago (later, however,
at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton) and Jean Dieudonne
(1906´ 1992) at Northwestern University (formerly at the University of
Nancy, later at the University of Paris).</p>
<p>Bourbaki originated as the result of conversations between Andre´
Weil and Henri Cartan in Strasbourg in 1934 concerning the need for new,
up-to-date textbooks; they were spurred to action by their frustration
at their students’ having to rely on Goursat’s Traite d’Analyse´ , and
they invited a group of other young mathematicians to join them in a
remedial project of writing a new analysis textbook. The original group,
holding regular meetings in a Paris cafe, consisted of Claude´ Chevalley
(1909 1984), Jean Dieudonne, Ren´ e de Possel (1905´ 1974) and Jean
Delsarte (1903 1968), in addition to Cartan and Weil. Also participating
were S. Mandelbrojt (1899 1983) and, for a shorter period, Paul Dubreil
(1904 1994) (replaced by Jean Coulomb) and Jean Leray (1906 1988)
(replaced by Charles Ehresmann (1905 1979). They rather quickly gave up
the original idea of a massive one-volume textbook and decided instead
on a series of self-contained, linearly ordered volumes. Each volume
would be characterized by strict adherence to an axiomatic approach, an
abstract form that brought out the structure of the underlying concepts,
and a progression from general to specific cases. Members chose and
discussed the topic for each volume; one person was chosen to act as
editor; members then reviewed the copy, with Dieudonne predominantly
acting as final reviser; and each volume´ was cleared for publication
after unanimous consent had been reached.</p>
<p>Nic ola s Bour b aki</p>
<p>It was hoped that the emphasis on structure and logical coherence
would effect a considerable economy of thought. In the early nineteenth
century, the discovery that the structure of the complex number system
was the same as that of points in the Euclidean plane showed that the
properties of the latter, studied for more than two millennia, could be
applied to the former. The result was an exuberant proliferation in
complex analysis. It seemed that twentieth-century concern for
similarities in structure should, in the years to come, yield similar
dividends.</p>
<p>Romantics in mathematics earlier in the century had feared a takeover
of their subject by an arid formalism encouraged by logicism. By the
middle of the century, the feud between formalists and intuitionists had
quieted, and the Bourbaki group saw no need to take sides in the
controversy. “What the axiomatic method sets as its essential aim,”
Bourbaki wrote, “is exactly that which logical formalism by itself
cannot supply, namely the profound intelligibility of mathematics.” In
the same vein, one of the leaders of the group wrote that “If logic is
the hygiene of the mathematician, it is not his source of food.”</p>
<p>The first volume of Bourbaki’s E´lements´ appeared in 1939. After the
end of World War II, parts of the first three books were still
incomplete and the last three had to be started. New members who joined
Bourbaki before 1950 included Roger Godemont, Pierre Samuel, Jacques
Dixmier, and Jean-Pierre Serre, and they were soon followed by Samuel
Eilenberg, Jean-Louis Koszul, and Laurent Schwartz. By 1958, most of
what is known as Part I, Les structures fondamentales de l’analyse, had
been completed. This part contains half a dozen subheadings or “books”:
(1) Set Theory, (2) Algebra, (3) General Topology,</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Functions of a Real Variable, (5) Topological Vector Spaces, and (6)
Integration. As the titles indicate, only a small portion of the
mathematics contained in these volumes was in existence a century
earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the time plans for the next volumes had to be firmed up, a “third
generation” joined the group. They included Armand Borel, Franc¸ois
Bruhat, Pierre Cartier, Alexander Grothendieck, Serge Lang, and John
Tate. They were faced with major challenges in determining the course
the project should now take. Should the original concept of the
selfcontained linear order be followed when so many new topics would
require preliminaries that might be decades in the making? Should the
existing first six volumes be rewritten and brought up to date? Should
the volumes covering the newest research results in mathematics still be
treated as textbooks? Should all members of the group be expected to be
sufficiently knowledgeable in each topic to participate in the
decision-making process for that volume?</p>
<p>After a variety of proposals, substantial arguments, and considerable
debate—an activity that had always characterized the meetings of the
group—by 1984, Bourbaki had produced a certain amount of new material.
As before, chapters of the individual books were not always completed in
the planned, eventual order. There were two “summary” chapters on
differential and analytic manifolds, designed to serve as
acompromiseforhavingtogiveuptherigorouslinearorderforthesetopics; seven
chapters on commutative algebra; eight chapters on Lie groups and Lie
algebras; and two chapters on spectral theories. In addition, there was
now an English translation of some of the first six books, of three of
the chapters on Lie groups and algebras, and of the chapters on
commutative algebra. Fifty years after the first cafe gatherings in
Paris, the future of´

<h4 id="homological-algebra-and-category-theory">Homological Algebra and
Category Theory</h4>
<p>The fundamental concepts of modern (or abstract) algebra, topology,
and vector spaces were laid down between 1920 and 1940, but the next
twenty years saw a veritable upheaval in methods of algebraic topology
that carried over into algebra and analysis. The result was a new
subject known as homological algebra, the first book on which, by Henri
Cartan (1904 2008) and Samuel Eilenberg (1913 1998), appeared in 1955,
to be followed in the next dozen years by several other monographs,
including Saunders Mac Lane’s (1909 2005) Homology. Homological algebra
is a development of abstract algebra concerned with results that are
valid for many different kinds of spaces—an invasion of algebraic
topology in the domain of pure algebra. The rapidity with which this
general and powerful cross between abstract algebra and algebraic
topology has grown is apparent in the swift increase in the number of
articles on homological algebra listed in Mathematical Reviews.
Moreover, so widely applicable are results in the field that the older
labels of algebra, analysis, and geometry scarcely fit the results of
recent research. Never before has mathematics been so thoroughly unified
as in our day.</p>
<p>Symptomatic of this trend was the introduction of the notions of
functor and category in 1942 by Eilenberg and Mac Lane. In the words of
Eilenberg:</p>
<p>f h</p>
<p>A category A has “objects” A, B, C, and so on, and arrows A!B, C
!D</p>
<p>f g and so on. Two consecutive arrows, A!B!C, may be composed to</p>
<p>gf</p>
<p>give A! C This composition is associative. Each object A has an</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>identity, that is, an arrow A!A which, when composed with any other
arrow, does not change it. Functors are simply ways of transforming one
category into another…. For those familiar with the terms, we list some
examples. The category of groups: here the objects are groups, and the
arrows (technically called morphisms) are homomorphisms of groups.</p>

<h4 id="algebraic-geometry-1">Algebraic Geometry</h4>
<p>Twentieth-century algebraic geometry was subject to a succession of
efforts to place its foundation on firmer groundwork. In the late 1920s,
Oscar Zariski (1899 1986), who had been trained in the Italian school of
algebraic geometers, working with Enriques, Castelnuovo, and Severi, set
out to use the most recent results of abstract algebra as building
blocks for algebraic geometry. Not surprisingly, B. L. van der Waerden,
the author of the paradigmatic two-volume Moderne Algebra, took a
similar approach. It was Andre Weil, in the introduction to his 1946´
volume on Foundations of Algebraic Geometry, who described the issue at
hand from the following broader perspective:</p>
<p>However grateful we algebraic geometers should be to the modern
algebraic school for lending us temporary accommodation, makeshift
constructions full of rings, ideals and valuations, in which some of us
feel in constant danger of getting lost, our wish and aim must be to
return at the earliest possible moment to the palaces which are ours by
birthright, to consolidate shaky foundations, to provide roofs where
they are missing, to finish, in harmony with the portions already
existing, what has been left undone.</p>
<p>The next effort to stabilize the foundations occurred after World War
II. In 1946, Jean Leray began to publish several notes in the Comptes
rendus discussing the notions of sheaves and spectral sequences. Much of
this material was based on thoughts he had developed as a prisoner of
war. In the 1950s, Jean-Pierre Serre produced a series of publications
applying sheaves to algebraic geometry. This in turn was followed in the
1960s by Alexander Grothendieck’s series E´lements de g´ eom´ etrie´
algebrique´ , where the idea of schemes came to the fore. The notes of
Grothendieck’s seminar of the same decade underlined the relationship of
algebraic geometry to algebraic number theory and called attention to
correspondences between algebraic geometry over finite fields and the
topology of manifolds. A major motivation of this work was an attack on
the Weil conjectures of the 1940s concerning the local zeta functions
obtained from the points on algebraic varieties over finite fields. The
most difficult of the conjectures—an analogue of the Riemann
hypothesis—was proved by Pierre Deligne in 1974, using etale cohomology
theory.</p>
<p>While much of algebraic geometry is concerned with abstract and
general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation
with concretely given polynomials were also developed. By the 1990s,
reputable undergraduate textbooks assured students and instructors that
they no longer needed to be conversant with the traditional abstract
content of graduate courses in algebraic geometry but, thanks to the
development of new algorithms, could work efficiently with polynomial
equations and should be able to use a computer algebra system and study
the most important of the newer techniques, the method of Gro¨bner
bases, which was employed in all computer algebra systems of the
time.</p>
<h4 id="logic-and-computing">Logic and Computing</h4>
<p>It is one of the ironies of history that while Bourbaki and many
other pure mathematicians pursued the goal of substituting ideas for
calculations, engineers and applied mathematicians developed a tool that
revived interest in numerical and algorithmic techniques and sharply
affected the composition of many departments of mathematics: the
computer. In the first half of the twentieth century, the history of
computing machines involved more statisticians, physicists, and
electrical engineers than mathematicians. Desk calculating machines and
punched-card systems were indispensable to business, banking, and the
social sciences. The slide rule became the symbol of the engineer, and
integrators of various types were used by physicists, geodesists, and
statisticians. Paper and pencil remained the chief tools of the
mathematician. The situation changed somewhat in the 1940s because of
the involvement of mathematicians in
thewareffort.Althoughmostofthemajoreffortsweredrivenbyphysicists and
engineers, numerous younger mathematicians played a part in the
development of the automatic digital electronic computer. Some of these
pioneers stayed in the computer field; others went into new fields more
closely related to the new technology; some turned to applied
mathematics; a few returned to their original specialties. Most of these
mathematicians were at an early stage of their careers when they became
involved with computers, many having received their Ph.D.s in the 1930s.
Let us consider three mathematicians whose contributions to the emerging
computer field</p>
<p>L o gic and C omput ing</p>
<p>were notable largely because of the fact that they had already gained
a reputation as mathematicians.</p>
<p>John von Neumann (1903 1957) was born in Budapest. After good
preparatory training that included individualized mathematical
instruction, he earned early recognition for his mathematical talents.
This permitted his obtaining a Ph.D. in mathematics from Budapest
practically in absentia while he spent his time in Zurich and Berlin. He
did, however, earn a degree in chemical engineering at the Polytechnic
Institute in Zurich. In a paper published when he was only twenty-one,
he gave a new definition for ordinal numbers; two years later, he
presented a system of axioms for set theory that provided an alternative
to those of Zermelo and A. Fraenkel. In 1926, he produced a pioneering
paper on game theory, following work by Borel. His teaching career began
in Germany, where he spent the three years from 1927 to 1930 at the
universities of Berlin and Hamburg. In 1930, he moved to Princeton, New
Jersey, where he was affiliated with Princeton University until asked to
become a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1933. One of the
most creative and versatile mathematicians of the century, von Neumann
was a pioneer in a new approach to mathematical economics. Econometrics
had long made use of mathematical analysis, but it was especially
through the Theory of Games and Economic Behavior of von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 that so-called finite mathematics came to play
an increasing role in the social sciences. Von Neumann’s contributions
to game theory involved primarily versions of cooperative games; the
1944 volume considered two-person zero-sum games. (This field of inquiry
was expanded considerably in the 1950s when John Forbes Nash developed
the equilibrium concept that allowed examination of noncooperative
games, which eventually resulted in his sharing the 1994 Nobel Prize in
Economics.)</p>
<p>Interrelationships among the various branches of thought had become
so complicated that Norbert Wiener (1894 1964), a mathematical prodigy
and for many years a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, in 1948 published his Cybernetics, a book that
established a new subject devoted to the study of control and
communication in animals and machines. Von Neumann and Wiener were also
deeply involved in quantum theory, and the former in 1955 was appointed
to the Atomic Energy Commission. In addition to their contributions to
applied mathematics, these men contributed at least as extensively to
pure mathematics—to set theory, group theory, operational calculus,
probability, and mathematical logic and foundations. It had been von
Neumann, in fact, who in about 1929 had given Hilbert space its name,
its first axiomatization, and its present highly abstract form. Wiener
had been important in the early 1920s in the origins of the modern
theory of linear spaces and, in particular, in the development of Banach
space.</p>
<p>Alan Turing (1913 1954), the youngest of the three, was an Englishman
who graduated from King’s College at Cambridge University in 1934. The
following year, he made history by solving one of the outstanding
problems in mathematical logic. The paper containing this result,
published in 1937, was titled “On Computable Numbers, with an
Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.” In 1936, Turing had gone to
the United States to study at Princeton. While there, he worked with the
logician A. Church, who brought out his own proof of the
Entscheidungsproblem and became acquainted with John von Neumann. Having
been awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1938, Turing returned to England. On the
outbreak of World War II, Turing reported to the Government Code and
Cipher School at Bletchley Park. From then until his untimely death in
1954, he was deeply involved in cryptanalytic activity, the design of
electronic computers, and the design of programming systems.</p>
<p>Initial uses of computers for mathematical purposes were limited to
table computations and calculations of prime numbers, mathematical
constants, and the like. Some of the early computations of e and π were
carried out to test computing speed and capacity, as much as to
establish new results. In time, such efforts became more useful for
mathematics, theorem-proving programs were developed, and, as we shall
note in the next chapter, by 1977, the first computer-based proof of a
major mathematical theorem could be announced.</p>
<h4 id="the-fields-medals">The Fields Medals</h4>
<p>The international mathematical community has an award that is often
likened to the Nobel Prize in other disciplines. The award is named for
John Charles Fields (1863 1932), a Canadian mathematician based at the
University of Toronto who specialized in the study of algebraic
functions. He had good interpersonal relationships with European
mathematicians, notably Go¨sta Mittag-Leffler and appears to have had
considerable managerial skills. He succeeded in bringing the 1924
International Congress of Mathematicians to Toronto at a time when there
were sharp political differences among mathematicians. After World War I
(until 1928), Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey were
excluded from the International Mathematical Union (IMU) that was
established in 1920 to organize subsequent congresses. Fields
successfully persuaded many leading European mathematicians opposed to
the IMU to support and attend the 1924 congress; he raised funds for the
congress and its attendees; and when it turned out that there was excess
money at the end, he proposed, in 1931, that this money be</p>
<p>T he F ields Me dal s</p>
<p>used to establish an international medal for mathematics. His will
provided for an additional amount.</p>
<p>At the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1932, it was
decided that beginning with the 1936 congress, “Fields medals” should be
awarded at the ICM to two mathematicians every four years. The
recipients should be under forty years old, and, as Fields had
suggested, the awards should call attention to past accomplishments as
well as future potential. The rules were modified in 1966 to stipulate
that the number of Fields medals awarded at each congress should be at
least two but no more than four.</p>
<p>The first two medals went to Lars V. Ahlfors (1907 1996) and Jesse
Douglas (1897 1965) for their work in analysis. Ahlfors was recognized
for his work “on covering surfaces related to Riemann surfaces of
inverse functions of entire and meromorphic functions”; Douglas received
recognition for his research in the area of Plateau’s problem.</p>
<p>World War II disrupted the International Congresses and the
concomitant medal awards; the next awards ceremony took place in 1950.
The 1950s reflected the waning dominance of classical analysis;
henceforth there was a steady increase of awards for research in
topology as well as in algebra, algebraic geometry, and number theory.
Since the 1990s, a number of awards have gone to individuals who
excelled in research that pulled together previously diverse areas of
mathematics.</p>
<p>Of the fifty-two Fields medals awarded prior to 2014, only four went
to recipients under thirty years of age. Eleven honorees were born in
the United States, eight each in France and the former Soviet Union or
Russia, six in England, and three each in Germany and Japan. The
remaining recipients were natives of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Italy,
Ukraine, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, China, Vietnam, and
Israel. These figures are of limited significance, however; for example,
two of those born in Germany studied and lived in France; numerous
others born outside North America spent at least part of their careers
in the United States. As we shall see in the next chapter, one honoree
declined the award and another potential recipient lost out because of
the proximity of his fortieth birthday; he received a silver plate
instead of a medal.</p>

<h4 id="overview-2">Overview</h4>
<p>As we look back over the last three decades, the period reveals
several emerging characteristics. Centers of significant mathematical
activity spread to Asia, and mathematical communication became speedier
and worldwide, in large part with help of the Internet. The dominance of
purely abstract algebra gave way to topics that drew on more integrated
algebra-geometric techniques, studies in complex topological structures,
differential geometric systems, questions of stability, and others.
Numerous problems, including some long-standing open questions of note,
were solved with computers; complexity theory and other mathematical
developments served to enhance computing power that was directed toward
mathematical problem solving. The length and the compound nature of some
of the best-known proofs led to questioning their validity, and the
mathematical community was divided on the question of what
constitutes</p>

<p>T he F our C olor C onje c tur e</p>
<p>an acceptable proof. Prizes involving previously unmatched monetary
awards helped bring mathematical challenges to public attention by
publicity in media outlets that were not known to have dealt with
mathematical topics in the past.</p>
<p>We conclude this survey by considering aspects of four famous
problems solved during this period that illustrate a number of these
characteristics.</p>
<h4 id="the-four-color-conjecture">The Four-Color Conjecture</h4>
<p>The four-color conjecture was first stated by Francis Guthrie
(18311899), an ex-student of Augustus De Morgan’s at University College
who earned a law degree but eventually returned to mathematics and
received an appointment as a professor in South Africa, where he also
distinguished himself as a botanist. In 1852, while still a law student,
Francis Guthrie contemplated the coloring of maps. He requested his
brother Frederick, who by then was also a student of De Morgan’s, to ask
De Morgan about the validity of a conjecture that De Morgan formulated
in a letter to William Rowan Hamilton as follows:</p>
<p>A student of mine asked me today to give him a reason for a fact
which I did not know was a fact and do not yet. He says that if a figure
be anyhow divided and the compartments differently coloured so that
figures with any portion of common boundary line are differently
coloured four colours may be wanted, but not more.</p>
<p>Neither Hamilton nor others whom De Morgan approached had a solution
for the “quaternions of color” problem. Among those who spent some time
on the puzzle were Charles Peirce in the United States and Arthur Cayley
in England. The latter brought it to the attention of the London
Mathematical Society in 1878 and the following year published an
analysis of the problem with the Royal Geographic Society. That same
year, Alfred Bray Kempe (18491922) announced in Nature that he had a
proof of the four-color conjecture.</p>
<p>Kempe had studied mathematics under Cayley at Cambridge and, though
entering the legal profession, devoted some of his time to mathematics
during most of his life. At Cayley’s suggestion, Kempe submitted his
proof to the American Journal of Mathematics, where it was published in
1879. It created interest on both sides of the Atlantic; Kempe offered
more streamlined versions of his proof, and in Edinburgh P. G. Tait even
proceeded to publish two proofs of his own.</p>
<p>In the 1890s, two men called attention to the fact that Kempe’s proof
was flawed. One was de la Vallee Poussin, the other Percy John Heawood´
(18611955), then a lecturer at Durham, where he subsequently became a
professor of mathematics and a mainstay of the university. Kempe could
not fix the problem, informed the London Mathematical Society of the
flaw, and turned to other endeavors, for which he was elected a fellow
and treasurer of the Royal Society and knighted in 1912; he is best
known for his work on linkages. Tait’s proof, too, turned out to contain
errors, as did numerous attempts by other mathematicians who thought
they could solve this simple-sounding puzzle. Heawood, who had been the
first to shatter Kempe’s claim to a proof, showed that every map can be
colored with five colors and proceeded to work on map coloring for
decades to come. His investigations included maps on a variety of
surfaces, and he managed to connect the number of colors with the Euler
characteristic of the surface. In 1898, he also proved that if the
number of edges around each region is divisible by 3, then the regions
can be colored with four colors. Numerous generalizations of this
theorem followed. Among those who published a paper on the four-color
conjecture generalizing Heawood’s work was the noted American geometer
Oswald Veblen (18801960). A year later, in 1913, his countryman George
David Birkhoff published a memoir on reducibility that would lay the
basis for much work on the four-color conjecture for decades to
follow.</p>
<p>Most attempted proofs of the four-color conjecture used methods that
relied on three concepts: “Kempe chains,” “avoidable sets,” and
“reducibility.” “Kempe chains” were basic to Kempe’s approach. Suppose
you are given a map every region (“compartment”) of which, except for
one, is colored either C1, C2, C3, or C4. Let U be the exceptional
region. If U is surrounded by regions of fewer than four colors, then U
can be assigned the missing color, and all is well. If, however, regions
R1, R2, R3, and R4, colored C1, C2, C3, and C4, respectively, surround
U, then either there is no chain of adjacent regions from R1 to R3
alternately colored C1 and C3, or there is such a chain. In the first
case, let R1 be colored C3 rather than C1, and likewise exchange all C1s
and C3s in the chain of adjacent regions joining R1. R3 is not in the
chain, keeps its color C3, and so U can be colored C1. In the second
case, there can be no chain of alternating colors C2 and C4 between R2
and R4. The same procedure used in the first case now can be applied.
What Kempe did not take into consideration was the effect that
interchanging the Ci in one chain may have on others in some of the many
cases he checked off.</p>
<p>Tait had introduced the idea of considering edges, and most
twentiethcentury discussions of the four-color conjecture explained the
attempted proof constructions in intuitively accessible graph theoretic
terms. This meant representing the regions of a map by vertices and
joining vertices of adjacent regions with an edge. The conjecture now
states that the vertices can be colored using four colors, with no two
adjacent vertices having the same color. This leads to the following
definitions: Let the graph representing the map be triangulated by
adding suitable edges to its faces. A portion of a triangulation within
a circuit is called</p>
<p>T he F our C olor C onje c tur e</p>
<p>a configuration. A set of configurations such that any triangulation
must contain an element of the set is called unavoidable.</p>
<p>Suppose a graph cannot be four-colored. A configuration that cannot
be contained in a triangulation of the smallest such graph is called
reducible. In 1922, Philip Franklin (18981965), who had written a
doctoral thesis on the four-color conjecture under Veblen’s direction,
following Birkhoff’s analysis of reducibility, showed that a map with no
more than 25 regions can be colored with 4 colors; others increased the
number of regions to a maximum of 27 (1926), 35 (1940), 39 (1970), and
95 (1976). It was in the 1960s, however, that a new ingredient was added
to the mix that would result in a new kind of proof.</p>
<p>In 1969, the German mathematician Heinrich Heesch (19061995)
introduced a fourth concept: the method of discharging. This consists of
assigning to a vertex of degree i the charge 62i. (Every smallest
counterexample is a 6-connected triangulation.) Euler’s characteristic
implies that the sum of the charges over all of the vertices must be 12.
A given set of configurations can be proved unavoidable if for a
triangulation that does not contain a configuration in that set the
charges can be redistributed (without changing the total charge) so that
no vertex ends up with a positive charge.</p>
<p>Heesch thought that the four-color conjecture could be solved by
considering a set of around 8,900 configurations. He was unable to
follow through on his projected program because some of his
configurations could not be reduced with available methods; he could not
gain access to adequate computer facilities in Germany, and German grant
support for collaborative work in the United States, which had enabled
him to make several trips to the University of Illinois and its
“supercomputer” facilities, was withdrawn.</p>
<p>In 1976, Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of
Illinois, using the concept of reducibility with the aid of Kempe
chains, followed through on Heesch’s discharge notion. They ended up
constructing an unavoidable set with nearly 1,500 configurations. After
considerable trial and error, and good judgment tweaking their
unavoidable set and their discharging procedure, Appel and Haken used
1,200 hours of computer time to work through the details of a final
proof.</p>
<p>Using a specially designed computer program, Appel and Haken started
by showing that there is a specific set of 1,936 configurations, each of
which cannot be part of a smallest-size counterexample to the four-color
theorem. In addition, any configuration must have a portion like one of
these 1,936 configurations. Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest
counterexamples existed because any must contain, yet not contain, one
of these 1,936 (later shrunk to 1,436) configurations. (In other words,
they had found an unavoidable set of reduced configurations.) This
contradiction meant there are no counterexamples at all, and the theorem
is true.</p>
<p>The four-color theorem was the first major theorem to be proved using
a computer. Reducibility could be verified and counterchecked by
different programs and computers; the unavoidability portion was checked
by hand, the results ending up on 400 pages of microfilm. The fact that
the entire proof could not be verified line by line by hand raised
considerable doubts among mathematicians about whether it could be
considered a proof in the traditional sense. The Appel-Haken procedure
was subjected to scrutiny by numerous groups. Researchers on both sides
of the Atlantic corrected minor flaws and attempted simpler proofs. In
1977, Appel and Haken published the first of several explanations of
their methodology. A major, detailed explanation and guide through their
proof is found in their 1989 book-length publication.</p>
<p>We note two later contributions to the saga of computer-assisted
proofs that did much to quiet the occasionally vociferous doubts
concerning the validity of such proofs.</p>
<p>In 1997, Neil Robertson, Daniel P. Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin
Thomas published a simpler computer-assisted proof of the four-color
problem. They devised an improved algorithm and needed to check only 633
configurations. They pointed out that they used only 32 discharging
rules, as opposed to Appel and Haken’s 300-plus, and could avoid an
“immersion” problem in discharging by confirming a certain conjecture of
Heesch’s. This aspect of the A-H proof had appeared the most troublesome
to Appel and Haken’s critics. Both parts of the proof required a
computer.</p>
<p>We should mention that both our programs use only integer arithmetic,
and so we need not be concerned with round-off errors and similar
dangers of floating point arithmetic. However, an argument can be made
that our “proof” is not a proof in the traditional sense, because it
contains steps that can never be verified by humans. In particular, we
have not proved the correctness of the compiler we compiled our programs
on, nor have we proved the infallibility of the hardware we ran our
programs on. These have to be taken on faith, and are conceivably a
source of error. However, from a practical point of view, the chance of
a computer error that appears consistently in exactly the same way on
all runs of our programs on all the compilers under all the operating
systems that our programs run on is infinitesimally small compared to
the chance of a human error during the same amount of case-checking.
Apart from this hypothetical possibility of a computer consistently
giving an incorrect answer, the rest of our proof can be verified in the
same way as traditional mathematical proofs. We concede, however, that
verifying a computer program is much more difficult than checking a
mathematical proof of the same length. 〔Robertson et al., 1997〕</p>
<p>In addition, in 2005, the theorem was proved by Georges Gonthier of
Microsoft Research Cambridge and Benjamin Werner of INRIA with</p>
<p>Cla s s i fic at ion of F ini t e Simple Gr oup s</p>
<p>general-purpose theorem-proving software. Specifically, they verified
the Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas proof using INRIA’s Coq
proof assistant that took away the task of having to check the various
computer programs that were previously used. Gonthier stressed that the
significance of their result lay in the fact that they had approached it
as a programming task, rather than as a mathematical one, and he
questioned whether future proof assistants should not be designed with
the programming environment in mind, rather than as an attempt to
replicate the mathematical form of a proof.</p>
<h4 id="classification-of-finite-simple-groups">Classification of Finite
Simple Groups</h4>
<p>The classification of finite simple groups is embodied in the
following theorem:</p>
<p>Every finite simple group belongs to (is isomorphic to) at least one
of the following sets of groups:</p>
<p>The cyclic groups of prime order;</p>
<p>The alternating groups of degree at least 5;</p>
<p>The simple Lie groups, including the classical groups, as well as the
twisted Lie groups and the Tits group;</p>
<p>or is one of 26 sporadic simple groups.</p>
<p>This classification theorem differs from most theorems in several
respects. Some of the groups were discovered only after a classification
program was underway; the theorem was cobbled together from numerous
articles written by scores of mathematicians after the enterprise had
begun, and it required general oversight and teams of verifiers to
confirm the validity of the component parts. Once the theorem could be
stated in its present form, a major effort was initiated to unify these
component parts, streamlining and replacing some of the individual
proofs so that the final theorem and its proof could give the appearance
of a cohesive whole.</p>
<p>Certain types of simple groups had been classified decades before the
general classification program was initiated. For example, Elie Cartan
and Wilhelm Killing (18471923) classified simple Lie groups in the
1890s, in conjunction with their classification of Lie algebras. The
first sporadic groups, known as the first five Mathieu groups, were
discovered by E´mile Mathieu even earlier, when he studied transitive
groups in the 1860s. There were other isolated results that would become
part of the classification theorem. What might have initiated a more
systematic approach to the study of abstract groups and of the
classification of simple groups was the work of William Burnside
(18521927), especially after publication in 1897 of his volume on The
Theory of Groups of Finite Order, which was the first English-language
textbook on group theory.</p>
<p>In a series of papers published in the 1890s, Burnside set out to
establish whether, given a number N, a simple group of order N exists.
The first of these papers, published in 1893, contained a proof that the
alternating group A5 is the only finite simple group whose order is the
product of four primes. In another paper, he showed that if a group G of
even order has a cyclic Sylow subgroup, then G cannot be simple. He also
conjectured that every noncommutative finite simple group has even
order.</p>
<p>It was Richard Brauer (19011977) who tied up several trends leading
to the classification theorem and first enunciated a program to reach
that goal. Among a few relevant highlights of his previous research, we
note his use of the groups that came to be known as “Brauer” groups in
studying the structure of simple algebras. These were Abelian groups
formed by the isomorphism classes of central division algebras over a
perfect field and were central to his study of the structure of simple
algebras. In 1937, in joint work with his doctoral student C. J.
Nesbitt, he used the theory of blocks that remained central in his later
studies of finite simple groups. About 1950, he began to work on an
approach to classifying all finite simple groups. At the 1954
International Congress of Mathematicians in Amsterdam, he announced his
program for this classification and presented a significant result that
would be included in the joint paper “On Groups of Even Order” that he
and another of his doctoral students, K. A. Fowler, published the
following year. This result stated that there are only finitely many
simple groups containing an involution whose centralizer is a given
finite group. Because a group of odd order is without involutions, this
is generally considered the clue that helped establish the way for a
classification program and—along with intermediate results from Michio
Suzuki (19261998) and Philip Hall (19041982)—for the famous 255-page
memoir by John Thompson and Walter Feit (19302004), in which they proved
that finite groups having odd order are solvable or, equivalently, that
every finite simple group has even order.</p>
<p>In 19601961, the University of Chicago held a Group Theory Year.
Daniel Gorenstein (19231992), who would soon assume the role of
coordinating the efforts of those involved in the classification
project, cited this as his first encounter with the leaders in the field
of simple group theory. It was at this meeting that Walter Feit and John
Thompson first revealed the odd-order theorem, which lent an aura of
feasibility to the idea of a joint endeavor to settle the classification
issue for simple finite groups. It was obvious, however, that the
project required coordination. This, after initial guidance from Brauer,
became Gorenstein’s task. In accepting the Steele prize for exposition
in 1989, Gorenstein himself claimed that</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L a s t T he or e m</p>
<p>it was Aschbacher’s entry into the field in the early 1970s that
irrevocably altered the simple group landscape. Quickly assuming a
leadership role in a single minded pursuit of the full classification
theorem, he was to carry the entire “team” along with him over the
following decade until the proof was completed.</p>
<p>The challenge was threefold:</p>
<p>1.It was unclear how many groups would be involved; of the twentysix
sporadic groups, only five were known; the others were discovered in the
course of the project, between 1965 and 1975;</p>
<p>2.The proofs were numerous and long; the Feit-Thompson proof of
theodd-order theorem took up 255 pages but was not the longest; there
were dozens of mathematicians adding hundreds more pages to the project;
verification would be a massive undertaking;</p>
<p>3.The research all seemed to be part of a closed system, with
noapparent external usefulness.</p>
<p>In answer to the criticisms, Gorenstein observed that “all the moves
we were making seemed to be forced. It was not perversity on our part,
but the intrinsic nature of the problem that seemed to be controlling
the directions of our efforts and shaping the techniques being
developed.”</p>
<p>Despite all of these difficulties, Daniel Gorenstein felt it safe to
announce in 1983 that the classification had been completed.
Verification had shown up some gaps and minor flaws in some of the
proofs, but these had all been repaired. There was one major concern,
however: there appeared to be a more serious gap in the unpublished
proof of the quasithin case. Michael Aschbacher and Steve Smith came to
the rescue by 2004, publishing their own two-volume proof of more than
1,200 pages for this case. After 1985, a concerted effort to simplify
and shorten some of the earlier proofs began, which was partly
successful because the statement of the theorem was now known, as were
the families of groups involved. The final unified version of the proof
was still estimated to take up some 5,000 pages. Nevertheless,
acceptance of the proof became more widespread, and the proof was also
made more palatable by the fact that the classification theorem could be
applied in other areas of mathematics. Fermat’s Last Theorem</p>
<p>Fermat’s so-called Last Theorem asserts that the equation xn 1yn 5zn
has no nonzero integral solution for x, y, z when n.2. In one of the
most famous marginal notations of history, Fermat’s copy of Diophantus’s
Arithmetica indicates that he has a proof, but the margin is too small
to contain it. As we have noted in previous chapters, among the
well-known mathematicians who attempted a proof was Euler, who is
credited with a proof for n53, Sophie Germain and Legendre for n55,
Dirichlet for n55 and n514, and Lame for´ n57.</p>
<p>In 1847, Lame presented to the Acad´ emie des Sciences a purported
proof´ of the theorem based on factorization over the complex number
field. Liouville pointed out that this assumed unique factorization,
which prompted a flurry of attempts to prove unique factorization. Soon
thereafter, Kummer informed Liouville, and through him the Academy, of a
paper published three years earlier, in which he had shown that unique
factorization fails; he had found a way of circumventing the problem,
however, by the introduction in 1846 of “ideal complex numbers.” Kummer
now proceeded to prove Fermat’s theorem for regular primes. This
naturally led to establishing conditions for the regularity of primes.
Later, in 1847, Kummer proved that a prime p is regular if p does not
divide the numerator of any of the Bernoulli numbers B2, B4,…, Bp 3. He
had also noted that several primes do not meet this criterion. This now
set up a new, longerlasting wave of excitement. For more than a century,
there were attempted proofs that some of the known irregular primes
satisfied the equation and that the number of regular primes is
infinite. Eventually, computers were called into action to show that the
theorem holds for values of n up to 4 million—which, of course, still
does not constitute a proof. There were many faulty attempts, many
amateurish efforts, but also work by serious number theorists such as H.
A. Vandiver (18821973), who spent many research hours on the apparently
intractable theorem.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the cavalry came to the rescue from the camp of
elliptic curves and modular forms. There was a conjecture, due to Goro
Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama (19271958), that every elliptic curve over
the rationals is modular. This conjecture had been known since the 1950s
but became more widely publicized after Andre Weil, who had praised
Shi-´ mura’s work in early reviews, brought supporting examples in 1967.
It was verified for numerous special cases. In 1985, Gerhard Frey, at
that time at the University of Saarbru¨cken, observed that if the
conjecture were true, this would imply Fermat’s Last Theorem. Serre
pinned down this observation (“all but ε”) with what came to be known as
the ε-conjecture, and within the same year, Ken Ribet, of the University
of California at Berkeley, proved the ε-conjecture and showed that the
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture need be true only for so-called semistable
elliptic curves in order for Fermat’s Last Theorem to hold.</p>
<p>In June 1993, Andrew Wiles gave a series of three lectures at the
Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge. The third lecture appeared to show
that the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture is true for semistable elliptic
curves. One of the corollaries that Wiles wrote on the blackboard with
the words “I will stop here” was Fermat’s Last Theorem.</p>
<p>Wiles had been interested in Fermat’s theorem since he read about it
at the age of ten. After graduating from Oxford in 1974, he proceeded to
earn his doctorate at Cambridge University, having John Coates as
his</p>
<p>F er mat ’s L a s t T he or e m</p>
<p>supervisor. By this time, he had read widely on the history of the
Fermat theorem and realized it would be unwise to pursue its proof as a
thesis or an alternate research project. Instead, he worked with John
Coates on the Iwasawa theory of elliptic curves and presented a
dissertation on “Reciprocity Laws and the Conjecture of Birch and
SwinnnertonDyer,” areas known to be among the most challenging of the
time; his doctorate was awarded in 1980.</p>
<p>Wiles learned about Ribet’s result in 1986. He described the event in
an interview on PBS’s NOVA program:</p>
<p>It was one evening at the end of the summer of 1986, when I was
sipping iced tea at the house of a friend. Casually, in the middle of a
conversation, this friend told me that Ken Ribet had proved a link
between TaniyamaShimura and Fermat’s Last Theorem. I was electrified. I
knew that moment that the course of my life was changing because this
meant that to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, all I had to do was to prove
the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. It meant that my childhood dream was
now a respectable thing to work on. I just knew that I could never let
that go…. Nobody had any idea how to approach Taniyama-Shimura, but at
least it was mainstream mathematics. I could try and prove results,
which, even if they didn’t get the whole thing, would be worthwhile
mathematics. So the romance of Fermat, which had held me all my life,
was now combined with a problem that was professionally acceptable.</p>
<p>For the next seven years, Wiles focused intensely on the problem at
hand. He did not discuss it with friends or colleagues because he felt
that any mention of Fermat would cause too much interest and
distraction. Indeed, his 1993 lectures created a sensation that was
surpassed only by word that he had discovered a gap in his proof while
preparing the three lectures for publication. Experts quickly decided
that his attempted proof would go down in history as just another failed
effort to settle the question of Fermat’s Last Theorem. They were wrong.
Within a year, Wiles had fixed the proof. In 1995, “Modular Elliptic
Curves and Fermat’s Last Theorem” appeared in the Annals of Mathematics,
together with a supplement, coauthored by his student R. Taylor,
“Ring-Theoretic Properties of Hecke Algebras.”</p>
<p>Subsequently, building in part on Wiles’s work, in 1999 the full
Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was proved. Now a theorem, this powerful
statement would have significant consequences for number theory and for
the so-called Langlands program of conjectures concerning number and
representation theory.</p>
<p>From 1995 on, prizes, awards, and a knighthood poured on Wiles, who
was by this time firmly established at Princeton University. Ironically,
the chief award of the international mathematical community, the Fields
medal, was not one of them. As previously noted, this medal is awarded
at the meetings of the International Congress of Mathematicians to
mathematicians below the age of forty for work done and the promise of
future achievements. Wiles had turned forty in April 1993.</p>
<p>Poincare’s Query´</p>
<p>In the decade from 1895 to 1904, Henri Poincare published a series
of´ fundamental memoirs that laid much of the foundation for analysis
situs, otherwise known as combinatorial or algebraic topology. The
initial, introductory publication of 1895 appeared in the Journal de
l’E´cole Polytechnique; more than 120 pages long, it was followed by a
series of additions and corrections that were spread among the
publications of the Circolo Matematico of Palermo, the London
Mathematical Society, and the Societ´ e Math´ ematique de France, along
with supplements in the´ Comptes rendus of the Academie des Sciences of
Paris. As noted in´ chapter 23, it was in these memoirs that Poincare
established relation-´ ships between Betti numbers, the fundamental
group, and other concepts basic to homology theory.</p>
<p>In the second supplement (1900) to the 1895 memoir, Poincare had´
stated that every torsion-free polyhedron with Betti numbers equal to 1
is simply connected. By the time of the fifth supplement in 1904, he
produced a counterexample that came to be known as “Poincare’s homology´
sphere”; it consisted of two suitably connected double tori. Although it
can be constructed in numerous different ways, Poincare’s homology
sphere is´ still the only known three-dimensional manifold that has the
same homology as the 3-sphere without being homeomorphic to it. His
counterexample led Poincare to close the memoir with the following
query:´</p>
<p>Is it possible that the fundamental group of 〔the manifold〕 V
reduces to the identity substitution and yet V is not simply connected
〔is not homeomorphic to the 3-sphere〕?</p>
<p>We note with interest that Poincare’s query, unlike Newton’s queries
in´ his appendix to the Opticks, is not formulated in the negative,
suggesting a positive response, but as a neutral question. Nevertheless,
this is the statement that was to become famous as “Poincare’s
Conjecture.”´</p>
<p>It was only in the 1930s, more than twenty years after Poincare’s´
death, that the question sparked substantial interest among topologists.
One of the first noted practitioners of this growing field who announced
that he had a proof of the Poincare conjecture was J. H. C. Whitehead´
(19041960). Deeper study showed him that he was mistaken.</p>
<p>In the process, he discovered some interesting examples of simply
connected noncompact 3-manifolds not homeomorphic to R3, the prototype
of which is now called the Whitehead manifold.</p>
<p>Poinc ar e’s Q uer y´</p>
<p>Numerous topologists followed Whitehead in the unsuccessful quest for
an answer to Poincare’s query. As an example, we mention three who´
earned their degrees under the supervision of R. L. Moore (18821974) in
Texas: R H Bing (19141986), E. E. Moise, and Steve Armentrout. Bing had
some measure of success by proving a watered-down version of the
conjecture. In 1958, he established that if every simple closed curve of
a compact 3-manifold is contained in a 3-ball, then the manifold is
homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.</p>
<p>Although attempts to resolve the Poincare conjecture for dimension 3´
seemed to go nowhere, the question arose what could be said for higher
dimensions. Here, there are simply connected manifolds that are not
homeomorphic to an n-sphere. It did not seem that a homotopy n-sphere
exists that is homeomorphic to an n-sphere. In 1961, however, Stephen
Smale proved the so-called generalized Poincare conjecture for dimen-´
sions higher than 4; in 1982, Michael Freedman proved the conjecture for
dimension 4.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, William Thurston provided a conjecture on classifying
3-manifolds. He suggested that any 3-manifold can be uniquely divided so
that each part has one of eight specified geometries. One is quickly
reminded of the uniformization theorem for two dimensions where a
similar division involves three geometries. Thurston’s so-called
geometrization conjecture became known in a set of lectures of 1980 and
was published in 1982. Although there was no obvious relationship
between it and the Poincare conjecture, as John Morgan noted, Thurston’s
work´ helped build a growing consensus that the Poincare conjecture, as
well´ as Thurston’s own conjecture, are true; by 2006, Thurston’s had
been confirmed for six of the eight geometries. The two remaining
difficult cases were those of spherical and hyperbolic geometries.
Thurston devoted himself to studies of the hyperbolic case, which has
metrics of constant negative curvature, as opposed to the spherical with
metric of constant positive curvature that would apply to the Poincare
conjecture.´</p>
<p>In 1982, Richard Hamilton introduced the Ricci flow on a manifold.
The Ricci flow equation is considered a nonlinear generalization of the
heat equation. Hamilton showed that it could be used to prove special
cases of the Poincare conjecture, but he encountered difficulties with´
certain singularities, which kept him from a full proof of the
conjecture. Another twenty years would pass before the long-awaited
proof appeared—this time on the Internet.</p>
<p>The author of this unusual proof was one Grigori Perelman of
St. Petersburg, known to his associates as Grisha. He is the son of an
electrical engineer and a mathematics teacher. When he was sixteen, he
came to public attention by earning a gold medal at the Mathematical
Olympiad in Budapest. He attended St. Petersburg University, where he
received his doctorate, then obtained a position at the Steklov
Institute, initially in the department of geometry and topology, then in
the department of partial differential equations. He spent the years
1992 to 1995 in the United States, first at the Courant Institute and at
Stony Brook, then on a two-year fellowship at the University of
California, Berkeley. At the end of this period, after refusing several
offers for positions from American universities, he returned home and
remained in virtual seclusion from 1995 to 2002.</p>
<p>While at Berkeley, Perelman had gained a reputation for brilliance
and eccentricity. He produced much but published little. For a long
time, he appeared to have little interest in the Poincare conjecture.
This changed,´ however, after he heard Hamilton repeatedly express his
conviction that the solution to solving the Poincare problem would be
found by someone´ who could resolve the singularity issues tied to the
Ricci flow. This appealed to Perelman: something to be tackled as a
problem in differential equations by a person with a sound background in
topology—a perfect fit for himself. Without letting his colleagues
suspect what had engaged him for eight years, he ended his self-imposed
exile in November 2002 by putting on the arXiv Web site the first of
three papers on Ricci flow. None of the papers mentioned Poincare or the
conjecture by name; the fact that´ he was also proving Thurston’s
geometrization conjecture appeared only as a casual mention in the first
paper. He made no effort to submit the papers for publication. Yet it
was clear to specialists in the field what this undertaking was all
about, and very soon several experts began the task of filling in
details of Perelman’s sketchy proofs, all noting that these followed
within the framework of his own techniques.</p>
<p>Three years after Perelman’s third paper had been placed on the arXiv
Web site, the matter became very public. Earlier, there had been notices
in the mathematical literature that Perelman appeared to have a proof,
but that it had not yet been verified, although, between 2003 and 2005,
several workshops were held to study the three papers. Now, in 2006,
verification was at hand.</p>
<p>In May, Bruce Kleiner and John W. Lott placed a paper on the arXiv
Web site that took care of the details of Perelman’s proof for the
difficult geometrization conjecture.</p>
<p>In the June issue of the Asian Journal of Mathematics appeared a
paper by Huai-Dong Cao and Xi-Ping Zhu with a proof of the Poincare´ and
the geometrization conjectures. On June 20, Shing-Tung Yau gave a
lecture on the Poincare conjecture at an International Conference on´
String Theory in Beijing, in which he praised his students Cao and Zhu
for having solved the conjecture, noting that Chinese mathematicians had
reason to be proud of this great success. Yau (b. 1949), a 1982 Fields
medal winner, has made major contributions to partial differential
equations, differential geometry, and mathematical physics. Based in the
United States, he has been a supporter of mathematics education in China
and in 2004 was honored for his contribution to Chinese mathematics in
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.</p>
<p>F utur e Out lo ok</p>
<p>In July, John Morgan and Gang Tian provided a proof of the Poincare´
conjecture on the arXiv Web site, which appeared in book form the
following year.</p>
<p>In August, the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) met in
Madrid. It awarded the Fields medal to Perelman—but Perelman refused to
accept the award. This may not have come as a total surprise to those
who remembered that ten years earlier, he had refused a prestigious
award given by the European Mathematical Society. John Morgan, the
author of the proof posted the previous month, gave a talk about the
conjecture at the ICM, stating in no uncertain terms that Perelman had
solved the Poincare conjecture. Meanwhile, the August issue of the´ New
Yorker contained a detailed article describing the Beijing Congress,
stressing Yau’s dismissive reference to Perelman, questioning his role
in the rapid acceptance of the Cao-Zhu paper, and portraying him in an
unflattering cartoon. Yau attempted to refute the article with a
threatened lawsuit, as well as several interviews and a clarifying
publication. Perelman, who had disproved the claim that he never spoke
to reporters by giving the New Yorker interviewers a pleasant tour of
the sights of St. Petersburg, resigned his position at the Steklov
Institute and continued to live peacefully at home with his mother.</p>
<h4 id="future-outlook">Future Outlook</h4>
<p>Among its more notable aspects, contemporary mathematics has featured
a resurgence of geometry, albeit in modern garb, and progress in the
settling of numerous famous problems. As the twentieth century drew to a
close, attitudes concerning the future of mathematics displayed neither
the pessimism of those late-eighteenth-century thinkers who stated that
most major problems had been solved nor the optimism of Hilbert at the
end of the nineteenth century, when he proclaimed that all problems
could be solved. Occasionally, it appears as if the dominant question is
whether mathematical problems should be solved. For mathematical
teaching and research in many sectors are caught between the Scylla and
Charybdis of those who condemn the subject because of applications that
make it a potential conveyor of human destruction and those who wish to
strip it of anything but its applications so as to render it more
socially useful, whether for medicine or war. Yet, history appears to
support the reflection of Andre Weil that “the great mathematician of
the future, as´ of the past, will flee the well-trodden path. It is by
unexpected rapprochements, which our imagination would not have known
how to arrive at, that he will solve, in giving them another twist, the
great problems which we shall bequeath to him.” Looking ahead, Weil was
also confident of one further thing: “In the future, as in the past, the
great ideas must be simplifying ideas.”</p>

<h4 id="general-bibliography">General Bibliography</h4>
<p>In contrast to the chapter references, this section includes
traditional and recent works in a variety of languages. In general,
books listed here pertain to more than one or two of the chapters in
this book.</p>
<p>Those seeking guidance to further reading should note that in
addition to the following bibliographical references, there are several
periodicals that publish
abstractsofneworrecentpublications.WesingleoutHistoriaMathematica,which
has a comprehensive, concisely annotated listing of recent works in the
history of mathematicsattheend
ofeachissue.Theabstracteditor,AlbertC.Lewis,prepared cumulative author
and subject indexes covering volumes 113. These splendid sources are
found in volume 13, issue 4, and volume 14, issue 1, respectively.
Another readily available source is section 01 of Mathematical Reviews;
in recent years,especially, thishas become veryuseful.
Theannualcumulative bibliography of Isis is still the main source for
publications in the history of science and technology that may not
appear in the more mathematically oriented journals.</p>
<p>For earlier work, May 1973 is very comprehensive and well indexed. It
is heavily based on reviews in Mathematical Reviews and the Jahrbuch
u¨ber Fortschritte der Mathematik. It omits the titles of journal
articles, however; does not always indicate the language of the material
listed; and provides few comments on individual listings. For that
reason, the newcomer to the field is better served by Dauben 1985, which
is very selective but heavily annotated and provides an easy, relatively
portable guide to reading in specific areas and to further
bibliographical sources.</p>
<p>Readers interestedin biographies arewellservedbytheDictionaryof
Scientific Biography (Gillispie 19701980). We do not list here standard
reference works, such as the major “national” biographical dictionaries
found in most libraries, although they often contain useful information
about mathematicians.</p>
<p>633</p>
<p>The Internet provides many new and changing sources of materials.
Although these vary widely in reliability, the reader should be aware of
one of the most trustworthy sites: for years, John J. O’Connor and
Edmund F. Robertson have maintained the MacTutor History of Mathematics
Archive at St. Andrews University. Few reference sources equal it.</p>
<p>The availability of primary source material depends greatly on the
size and scope of the reader’s library. It is usually worthwhile to
browse in the author and serial indexes; even a small library may hold
surprises. In recent years, there has been a considerable increase in
collected or selected works published. Also, there have been more
English-language translations of mathematical authors. For the earlier
periods, numerous English-language editions and translations have been
listed as part of our chapter bibliographies. For other source materials
in the English language, covering broader periods or topics, see
Birkhoff 1973, Calinger 1982, Midonick 1985, Smith 1959, Struik 1986,
and van Heijenoort 1967.</p>
<p>Many students of the history of mathematics are interested in solving
historical problems. This can be approached in two ways. One is to use
the techniques at the disposal of those with whom the problems are
associated historically; the other one is to use present-day methods.
Often, it is instructive to do both. Sometimes the two approaches
coincide. One gains great understanding of our mathematical predecessors
by the historical approach. This is difficult to carry out, however,
particularly for the period preceding Euler. To do so, it is generally
best to go back to the work of the author or the group with whom we
associate the problem. The original source is often not accessible; many
later translations, especially those of the Ancients, tend to distort
the problems by modernizing the language or the notation used by the
original author, a difficulty that is compounded in most modern
secondary accounts. This does not mean one should simply desist from
historical problem solving; rather, one should keep in mind the
differences between a modernized approach and the original and analyze
one’s attacks on the problem accordingly. Conversely, it can be
enjoyable to take theorems or problems from a contemporary textbook and
consider to what extent they would have been meaningful to a
mathematician in a specified period and place of history or how they
might have been solved or proved by a certain group. Better yet, one can
formulate one’s own mathematical statements, proofs, and solutions in
accordance with a historical period or tradition. This is somewhat
analogous to composing a rondo in the style of Mozart and has similar
drawbacks and advantages.</p>
<p>Readers interested in historical problems are referred to three types
of sources. First, there are primary sources; for the last century, at
least, even smaller libraries often contain old textbooks with problems
and examples. Recalling that our textbook tradition of problems dates
back only a little more than a century, we list Gregory 1846 and Scott
1924 in the following bibliography. The former, which is scarce,
illustrates the type of “examples” that supplemented regular textbooks
until after 1850. The latter, more readily available, is a pioneering
example of a “modern” textbook in its use of problems that illustrate
several areas of late-nineteenth-century mathematics. Then, there are
problem collections. Dorrie 1965 and Tietze 1965 are examples of
collections of historical problems. Polya is an example of contemporary
problems, the historical roots of which frequently provide food for
thought. Finally, there are problems linked to historical accounts such
as those in Burton 1985 and Eves 1983. These make clear the relationship
to the source, but the cautionary remarks about modernized adaptations
apply to both.</p>
