<h4 id="brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</h4>
<p>The last few paragraphs may leave the unwarranted impression that
there was a uniformity in Hindu mathematics, for we have frequently
localized developments as merely “of Indian origin,” without specifying
the period. The trouble is that there is a high degree of uncertainty in
Hindu chronology. Material in the important Bakshali manuscript,
containing an anonymous arithmetic, is supposed by some to date from the
third or fourth century, by others from the sixth century, and by others
from the eighth or ninth century or later, and there is a suggestion
that it may not even be of Hindu origin. We have placed the work of
Aryabhata around the year 500 CE, but there were two mathematicians
named Aryabhata, and we cannot with certainty ascribe results to our
Aryabhata, the elder. Hindu mathematics presents more historical
problems than does Greek mathematics, for Indian authors referred to
predecessors infrequently, and they exhibited surprising independence in
mathematical approach. Thus, it is that Brahmagupta (fl. 628 CE), who
lived in Central India somewhat more than a century after Aryabhata, has
little in common with his predecessor, who had lived in eastern India.
Brahmagupta mentions two values of π—the “practical value” 3 and the
“neat value” p10—but not the more accurate value of Aryabhata; in the
trigonometry of his best-known work, the Brahmasphuta Siddhanta, he
adopted a radius of 3,270, instead of Aryabhata’s 3,438. In one respect,
he does resemble his predecessor—in the juxtaposition of good and bad
results. He found the “gross” area of an isosceles triangle by
multiplying half of the base by one of the equal sides; for the scalene
triangle with base fourteen and sides thirteen and fifteen, he found the
“gross area” by multiplying half of the base by the arithmetic mean of
the other sides. In finding the “exact” area, he used the
Archimedean-Heronian formula. For the radius of the circle circumscribed
about a triangle, he gave the equivalent of the correct trigonometric
result 2R5a/sin A5b/sin B5 c/sin C, but this, of course, is only a
reformulation of a result known to Ptolemy in the language of chords.
Perhaps the most beautiful result in Brahmagupta’s work is the
generalization of “Heron’s” formula in finding the area of a
quadrilateral. This formula,</p>
<p>K 5pðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞðs2dÞ</p>
<p>where a, b, c, d are the sides and s is the semiperimeter, still
bears his name, but the glory of his achievement is dimmed by failure to
remark that the formula is correct only in the case of a cyclic
quadrilateral. The correct formula for an arbitrary quadrilateral is</p>
<p>K 5pðs2aÞðs2bÞðs2cÞðs2dÞ2abcd cos2 α</p>
<p>where α is half of the sum of two opposite angles. As a rule for the
“gross” area of a quadrilateral, Brahmagupta gave the pre-Hellenic
formula, the product of the arithmetic means of the opposite sides. For
the quadrilateral with sides a525, b525, c525, d539, for example, he
found a “gross” area of 800.</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s Formula</p>
<p>Brahmagupta’s contributions to algebra are of a higher order than are
his rules of mensuration, for here we find general solutions of
quadratic equations, including two roots even in cases in which one of
them is negative.</p>
<p>The systematized arithmetic of negative numbers and zero is, in fact,
first found in his work. The equivalents of rules on negative magnitudes
were known through the Greek geometric theorems on subtraction, such as
(a2b)(c2d)5ac1bd2ad2be, but the Indians converted these into numerical
rules on positive and negative numbers. Moreover, although the Greeks
had a concept of nothingness, they never interpreted this as a number,
as did the Indians. Yet here again Brahmagupta spoiled matters somewhat
by asserting that 0 4 050, and on the touchy matter of a40, for a 6¼ 0,
he did not commit himself:</p>
<p>Positive divided by positive, or negative by negative, is
affirmative. Cipher divided by cipher is naught. Positive divided by
negative is negative. Negative divided by affirmative is negative.
Positive or negative divided by cipher is a fraction with that for
denominator. (Colebrook 1817, Vol. I)</p>
<p>Ind e t er minat e Equat ions</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the Hindus, unlike the Greeks,
regarded irrational roots of numbers as numbers. This was of enormous
help in algebra, and Indian mathematicians have been much praised for
taking this step. We have seen the lack of nice distinction on the part
of Hindu mathematicians between exact and inexact results, and it was
only natural that they should not have taken seriously the difference
between commensurable and incommensurable magnitudes. For them, there
was no impediment to the acceptance of irrational numbers, and later
generations uncritically followed their lead until in the
nineteenth-century mathematicians established the real number system on
a sound basis.</p>
<p>Indian mathematics was, as we have said, a mixture of good and bad.
But some of the good was superlatively good, and here Brahmagupta
deserves high praise. Hindu algebra is especially noteworthy in its
development of indeterminate analysis, to which Brahmagupta made several
contributions. For one thing, in his work we find a rule for the
formation of Pythagorean triads expressed in the form2 m, ðm2=n2nÞ, ðm
=n1nÞ, but this is only a modified form of the old Babylonian rule, with
which he may have become familiar. Brahmagupta’s area formula for a
quadrilateral, mentioned previously, was used by him in conjunction with
the formulas</p>
<p>pðab1cdÞðac1bdÞ=ðad1bcÞ and pðac1bdÞðad1bcÞ=ðab1cdÞ</p>
<p>for the diagonals to find quadrilaterals whose sides, diagonals, and
areas are all rational. Among them was the quadrilateral with sides
a552, b525, c539, d560, and diagonals 63 and 56. Brahmagupta gave the
“gross” area as 1;933, despite the fact that his formula provides the
exact area, 1,764 in this case.</p>
