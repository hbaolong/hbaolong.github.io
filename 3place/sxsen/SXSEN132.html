<h4 id="german-algebras-and-arithmetics">German Algebras and
Arithmetics</h4>
<p>The word “Renaissance” inevitably brings to mind Italian literary,
artistic, and scientific treasures, for renewed interest in art and
learning became apparent in Italy earlier than in other parts of Europe.
There, in a roughand-tumble conflict of ideas, men learned to put
greater trust in independent observations of nature and judgments of the
mind. Moreover, Italy had been one of the two chief avenues along which
Arabic learning, including algorism and algebra, had entered Europe.
Nevertheless, other parts of Europe did not remain far behind, as the
work of Regiomontanus
andChuquetshows.InGermany,forexample,booksonalgebrabecameso numerous
that for a time, the Germanic word “coss” for the unknown triumphed in
other parts of Europe, and the subject became known as the
“cossicart.”Moreover,theGermanicsymbolsforadditionandsubtraction
ultimately displaced the Italian p and m. In 1489, before the
publication of Pacioli’s Summa, a German lecturer (“Master in the
Liberal Arts”) at Leipzig, Johann Widman (1462 1498), had published a
commercial arithmetic, Behendeund hu¨bsche Rechnungauff allen
Kauffmanschafften, theoldestbookinwhichourfamiliar 1
and2signsappearinprint.Atfirst used to indicate excess and deficiency in
warehouse measures, they later became symbols of the familiar arithmetic
operations. Widman, incidentally,possesseda manuscriptcopyof the
Algebraof al-Khwarizmi,a work well known to other German
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Among the numerous Germanic algebras was Die Coss, written in 1524 by
Germany’s celebrated Rechenmeister Adam Riese (1492 1559). The author
was the most influential German writer in the move to replace the old
computation (in terms of counters and Roman numerals) with the newer
method (using the pen and Hindu-Arabic numerals). So effective were his
numerous arithmetic books that the phrase “nach Adam Riese” still
survives in Germany as a tribute to accuracy in arithmetic processes.
Riese, in his Coss, mentions the Algebra of al-Khwarizmi and refers to a
number of Germanic predecessors in the field.</p>
<p>The first half of the sixteenth century saw a flurry of German
algebras, among the most important of which were the Coss (1525) of
Christoph Rudolff (ca. 15002ca. 1545), a tutor of mathematics in Vienna;
the Rechnung (1527) of Peter Apian(1495 1552);and the ArithmeticaIntegra
(1544) of Michael Stifel (ca. 1487 1567). The first is especially
significant as one of theearliest printedworkstomake
useofdecimalfractions, as well as of the modern symbol for roots; the
second is worth recalling for the fact that here, in a commercial
arithmetic, the so-called Pascal triangle was printed on the title page,
almost a century before Pascal was born. The third work, Stifel’s
Arithmetica Integra, was the most important of all of the
sixteenth-century German algebras. It, too, includes the Pascal
triangle, but</p>
<p>Title page of an edition (1529) of one of the Rechenbucher of Adam
Riese, the Rechenmeister. It depicts a contest between an algorist and
an abacist.</p>
<p>it is more significant for its treatment of negative numbers,
radicals, and powers. Through the use of negative coefficients in
equations, Stifel was able to reduce the multiplicity of cases of
quadratic equations to what
appearedtobeasingleform,buthehadtoexplain,underaspecialrule,when to
use1and when 2. Moreover, even he failed to admit negative numbers as
roots of an equation. Stifel, a onetime monk turned itinerant Lutheran
preacher and for a time professor of mathematics at Jena, was one of the
many writers who popularized the “German” symbols 1 and 2 at the expense
of the “Italian” p and m notation. He was thoroughly familiar with the
properties of negative numbers, despite the fact that he called them
“numeri absurdi.” About irrational numbers he was somewhat hesitant,
saying that they are “hidden under some sort of cloud of infinitude.”
Again calling attention to the relations between arithmetic and
geometric progressions, as had Chuquet for powers of 2 from 0 to 20,
Stifel extended the table to include 21 5 and 22 5 and 23 5 (without,
however, using
exponentialnotation).Forpowersoftheunknownquantityinalgebra,Stifel in
Arithmetica Integra used abbreviations for the German words “coss,”
“zensus,” “cubus,” and “zenzizensus,” but in a later treatise, De
Algorithmi Numerorum Cossicorum, he proposed using a single letter for
the unknown and repeating the letter for higher powers of the unknown, a
scheme later employed by Thomas Harriot (1560 1621).</p>
