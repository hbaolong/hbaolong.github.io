<h4 id="the-life-of-euler">The Life of Euler</h4>
<p>Switzerland was the birthplace of many of the leading figures in the
mathematics of the early eighteenth century, and the most significant
mathematician to come from Switzerland during that time—or any time—was
Leonhard Euler (1707 1783).</p>
<p>Euler’s father was a clergyman who, like Jacques Bernoulli’s father,
hoped that his son would enter the ministry. The young man, however,
studied under Jean Bernoulli and associated with his sons, Nicolaus and
Daniel, and through them discovered his vocation. Euler was broadly
trained, for to the study of mathematics he added theology, medicine,
astronomy, physics, and oriental languages. This breadth stood him in
good stead when, in 1727, he heard from Russia that there was an opening
in medicine in the St. Petersburg Academy, where the young Bernoullis
had gone as professors of mathematics. On the recommendation of the
Bernoullis, two of the brightest luminaries in the early days</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>T he L i fe of Euler</p>
<p>of the Academy, Euler was called to be a member of the section on
medicine and physiology.</p>
<p>In 1730, Euler found himself in the chair of natural philosophy,
rather than in the medical section. His friend Nicolaus Bernoulli had
died, by drowning, in St. Petersburg the year before Euler arrived, and
in 1733, Daniel Bernoulli left Russia to occupy the chair in mathematics
at Basel. Thereupon Euler, at the age of twenty-six, became the
Academy’s chief mathematician. The St. Petersburg Academy had
established a research journal, the Commentarii Academiae Scientiarum
Imperialis Petropolitanae, and almost from the start, Euler contributed
a spate of mathematical articles. It was said by the French academician
Franc¸ois Arago that Euler could calculate without any apparent effort,
“just as men breathe, as eagles sustain themselves in the air.” As a
result, Euler composed mathematical memoirs while playing with his
children. In 1735, he had lost the sight of his right eye, but this
misfortune in no way diminished the rate of output of his research. He
is supposed to have said that his pencil seemed to surpass him in
intelligence, so easily did memoirs flow. He published more than 500
books and papers during his lifetime. For almost half a century after
his death, works by Euler continued to appear in the publications of the
St. Petersburg Academy. A bibliographical list of Euler’s works,
including posthumous items, contains 886 entries, and it is anticipated
that his collected works (including his correspondence), now being
published under Swiss auspices, will run to 82 substantial volumes. His
mathematical research averaged about 800 pages a year; no mathematician
has ever exceeded the output of this man whom Arago characterized as
“Analysis Incarnate.”</p>
<p>Early on, Euler acquired an international reputation. Even before
leaving Basel, he had received an honorable mention from the Parisian
Acade´mie des Sciences for an essay on the masting of ships. In later
years, he frequently entered essays in the contests set by the
Acade´mie, and twelve times he won the coveted biennial prize. The
topics ranged widely, and on one occasion, in 1724, Euler snared with
Maclaurin and Daniel Bernoulli a prize for an essay on the tides. (The
Paris prize was won twice by Jean Bernoulli and ten times by Daniel
Bernoulli.) Euler was never guilty of false pride, and he wrote works on
all levels, including textbook material for use in the Russian schools.
He generally wrote in Latin and sometimes in French, although German was
his native tongue. Euler had unusual language facility, as one should
expect of a person with a Swiss background. This was fortunate, for one
of the distinguishing marks of eighteenth-century mathematics was the
readiness with which scholars moved from one country to another, and
here Euler encountered no language problems. In 1741, Euler was invited
by Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy, and the invitation
was accepted. Euler spent twentyfive years at Frederick’s court, and he
submitted numerous papers to the St. Petersburg Academy, as well as to
the Prussian Academy.</p>
<p>Euler spent almost all of the last seventeen years of his life in
total darkness due to cataracts. Even this tragedy failed to stem the
flood of his research and publication, which continued unabated until in
1783, at the age of seventy-six, he suddenly died while sipping tea and
enjoying the company of one of his grandchildren.</p>
