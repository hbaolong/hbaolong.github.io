<h4 id="renaissance-trends">Renaissance Trends</h4>
<p>Several characteristics of the period under review stand out: the
diversity of occupations engaging the men we have considered, the
variety of languages in which mathematical works became available, and
the growth of mathematical applications. Whereas most medieval
contributors to mathematics received institutional support from the
Church, Renaissance mathematicians such as Regiomontanus gradually
shifted their support base to the growing commercial interests of the
time. An increasing number found employment from heads of states or
municipal institutions that needed calculators or teachers, mapmakers or
engineers. A considerable number were physicians or professors of
medicine. Most mathematical works at the beginning of the period were
available in Latin, or, as we have noted, if they had originally been
produced in Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew, were translated into Latin. By the
late sixteenth century, original works were available in English,
German, French, Italian, and Dutch.</p>
<p>Mathematics during the Renaissance had been widely applied to
bookkeeping, mechanics, surveying, art, cartography, and optics, and
numerous books were devoted to the practical arts. No one encouraged the
burgeoning emphasis on applications more strongly than Pierre de la
Rame´e, or Ramus (1515 1572), a man who contributed to mathematics in a
pedagogical sense. At the College de Navarre, he had in 1536` defended,
for his master’s degree, the audacious thesis that everything Aristotle
had said was wrong—at a time when Peripateticism was the same as
orthodoxy. Ramus was at odds with his age in many ways; banned from
teaching philosophy in France, he proposed revisions in the university
curricula so that logic and mathematics should receive more attention.
Not satisfied even with the Elements of Euclid, Ramus edited this with
revisions. Yet his competence in geometry was limited. Ramus had more
confidence in practical elementary mathematics than in speculative
higher algebra and geometry. His logic enjoyed considerable popularity
in Protestant countries, in part because he died a martyr in the
St. Bartholomew massacre. This brings to our attention the fact that in
this first century of the Reformation, most works written in the vulgate
and intended for the mathematical practitioner were created in the
Protestant areas of Europe, whereas most of the traditional classical
treatises were studied and commented on in the Catholic parts.</p>
<p>Interest in the classical works of antiquity remained strong, as we
see in the case of Maurolico, a priest of Greek parentage who was born,
lived, and died in Sicily. Maurolico was a scholar who did much to
revive interest in the more advanced of the antique works. Geometry in
the first half of the sixteenth century had been heavily dependent on
the elementary properties found in Euclid. With the exception of Werner,
few were really familiar with the geometry of Archimedes, Apollonius, or
Pappus. The reason for this was simple: Latin translations of these did
not become generally available until the middle of the century. In this
process of translation, Maurolico was joined by an Italian scholar,
Federigo Commandino. We have mentioned Tartaglia’s borrowed translation
of Archimedes that was printed in 1543; this was followed by a Greek
edition of 1544 and a Latin translation by Commandino at Venice in
1558.</p>
<p>Four books of the Conics of Apollonius had survived in Greek, and
these had been translated into Latin and printed in Venice in 1537.
Maurolico’s translation, completed in 1548, was not published for more
than a century, appearing in 1654, but another translation by Commandino
was printed in Bologna in 1566. The Mathematical Collection of Pappus
had been virtually unknown to the Arabs and the medieval Europeans, but
this, too, was translated by the indefatigable Commandino, although it
was not printed until 1588. Maurolico was acquainted with the vast
treasures of ancient geometry that were becoming available, for he read
Greek, as well as Latin. In fact, from some indications in Pappus of
Apollonius’s work on maxima and minima—that is, on normals to the conic
sections—Maurolico tried his hand at a reconstruction of the then lost
Book V of the Conics. In this respect, he represented a vogue that was
to be one of the chief stimuli to geometry before Descartes: the
reconstruction of lost works in general and of the last four books of
the Conics in particular. During the interval from Maurolico’s death in
1575 to the publication of La ge´ome´trie by Descartes in 1637, geometry
was marking time until developments in algebra had reached a level that
made algebraic geometry possible. The Renaissance could well have
developed pure geometry in the direction suggested by art and
perspective, but the possibility went unheeded until almost precisely
the same time that algebraic geometry was created.</p>
<p>By 1575, Western Europe had recovered most of the major mathematical
works of antiquity that are now extant. Arabic algebra had been mastered
and improved on, both through the solution of the cubic and the quartic
and through a partial use of symbolism, and trigonometry had become an
independent discipline. A central figure in the transition to the
seventeenth century was the Frenchman Franc¸ois Viete.`</p>
<p>Francois Vi¸ ete`</p>
<p>Viete
(1540<code>1603) was not a mathematician by vocation. As a young man, he studied and practiced law, becoming a member of the Bretagne parliament; later he became a member of the king’s council, serving first under Henry III and later under Henry IV. It was during his service with the latter, Henry of Navarre, that Viete became so successful in deci-</code>
phering cryptic enemy messages that the Spanish accused him of being in
league with the devil. Only Viete’s leisure time was devoted
to<code>mathematics, yet he made contributions to arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. There was a period of almost half a dozen years, before the accession of Henry IV, during which Viete was out of</code>
favor, and these years he spent largely on mathematical studies. In
arithmetic, he should be remembered for his plea for the use of decimal,
rather than sexagesimal, fractions. In one of his earliest works, the
Canon Mathematicus of 1579, he wrote:</p>
<p>Sexagesimals and sixties are to be used sparingly or never in
mathematics, and thousandths and thousands, hundredths and hundreds,
tenths and tens, and similar progressions, ascending and descending, are
to be used frequently or exclusively.</p>
<p>In the tables and the computations, he adhered to his word and used
decimal fractions. The sides of the squares inscribed in and
circumscribed about a circle of diameter 200,000 he wrote as
141,421,356;24 and 200,000,000;00, and their mean as 177,245385;09. A
few pages further on, he wrote the semi-circumference as 314,159,, and
still later this figure appeared as 314,159,265,36, with the integral
portion in boldface type. Occasionally, he used a vertical stroke to
separate the integral and fractional portions, as when writing the
apothem of the 96-sided regular polygon, in a circle of diameter
200,000, as about 99,9469458,75.</p>
<p>The Analytic Art</p>
<p>Without doubt, it was in algebra that Viete made his most
estimable<code>contributions, for it was here that he came closest to modern views. Mathematics is a form of reasoning and not a bag of tricks. There could be little advance in algebraic theory so long as the chief preoccupation was with finding “the thing” in an equation with specific numerical coefficients. Symbols and abbreviations for an unknown and for powers of the unknown, as well as for operations and for the relationship of equality, had been developed. Stifel had gone so far as to write AAAA for the fourth power of an unknown quantity, yet he had no scheme for writing an equation that might represent any one of a whole class of equations—of all quadratics, say, or of all cubics. A geometer, by means of a diagram, could let ABC represent all triangles, but an algebraist had no counterpart for writing down all equations of the second degree. Letters had indeed been used to represent magnitudes, known or unknown, since the days of Euclid, and Jordanus had done this freely, but there had been no way of distinguishing magnitudes assumed to be known from those unknown quantities that are to be found. Here, Viete</code>
introduced a convention as simple as it was fruitful. He used a vowel to
represent the quantity in algebra that was assumed to be unknown or
undetermined and a consonant to represent a magnitude or a number
assumed to be known or given. Here we find for the first time in algebra
a clear-cut distinction between the important concept of a parameter and
the idea of an unknown quantity. Had Viete adopted other
symbo-<code>lisms extant in his day, he might have written all quadratic equations in the single form BA2 1CA1D50, where A is the unknown and B, C, and D are parameters, but unfortunately, he was modern only in some ways and ancient and medieval in others. Although he wisely adopted the Germanic symbols for addition and subtraction and, still more wisely, used differing symbols for parameters and unknowns, the remainder of his algebra consisted of words and abbreviations. The third power of the unknown quantity was not A3 or even AAA, but A cubus, and the second power was A quadratus. Multiplication was signified by the Latin word “in,” division was indicated by the fraction line, and for equality Viete used an abbreviation for the Latin</code>
aequalis. It is not given for one man to make the whole of a given
change; it must come in steps.</p>
<p>One of the steps beyond the work of Viete was taken by Harriot
when<code>he revived the idea Stifel had had of writing the cube of the unknown as AAA. This notation was used systematically by Harriot in his posthumous book titled Artis Analyticae Praxis and printed in 1631. Its title had been suggested by the earlier work of Viete, who had disliked the</code>
Arabic name “algebra.” In looking for a substitute, Viete noted that in`
problems involving the “cosa,” or unknown quantity, one generally
proceeds in a manner that Pappus and the ancients had described as
analysis. That is, instead of reasoning from what is known to what was
to be demonstrated, algebraists invariably reasoned from the assumption
that the unknown was given and deduced a necessary conclusion from which
the unknown can be determined. In modern symbols, if we wish to solve x2
23x1250, for example, we proceed on the premise that there is a value of
x satisfying this equation; from this assumption, we draw the necessary
conclusion that (x22)(x21)50, so that either x2250 or x2150 (or both) is
satisfied, hence that x necessarily is 2 or 1. Yet, this does not mean
that one or both of these numbers will satisfy the equation unless we
can reverse the steps in the reasoning process. That is, the analysis
must be followed by the synthetic demonstration.</p>
<p>In view of the type of reasoning so frequently used in algebra,
Viete<code>called the subject “the analytic art.” Moreover, he had a clear awareness of the broad scope of the subject, realizing that the unknown quantity need not be either a number or a geometric line. Algebra reasons about “types” or species, hence Viete contrasted</code>
logistica speciosa with logistica numerosa. His algebra was presented in
the Isagoge (or Introduction), printed in 1591, but his several other
algebraic works did not appear until many years after his death. In all
of these, he maintained a principle of homogeneity in equations, so that
in an equation such as x3 13ax5b, the a is designated as planum and the
b as solidum. This suggests a certain inflexibility, which Descartes
removed a generation later, but homogeneity also has certain advantages,
as Viete undoubt-` edly saw.</p>
<p>The algebra of Viete is noteworthy for the generality of its
expression,<code>but there are also other novel aspects. For one thing, Viete suggested a</code>
new approach to the solution of the cubic. Having reduced it to the
standard form equivalent to x3 13ax5b, he introduced a new unknown
quantity, y, that was related to x through the equation in y3, for which
the solution is readily obtained. Moreover, Viete was aware of some
of<code>the relations between roots and coefficients of an equation, although here he was hampered by his failure to allow the coefficients and roots to be negative. He realized, for example, that if x3 1b 5 3ax has two positive roots, x1 and x2, then, 3a5x12 1x1x2 1x22 and b5x1x22 1x2x12. This is, of course, a special case of our theorem that the coefficient of the term in x, in a cubic with leading coefficient unity, is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, and the constant term is the negative of the product of the roots. Viete, in other words, was close to the subject of</code>
symmetric functions of the roots in the theory of equations. It remained
for Albert Girard (1595 1632) in 1629, in Invention nouvelle en
l’alge<code>bre, to state clearly the relations between roots and coefficients, for he allowed for negative and imaginary roots, whereas Viete had recog-</code>
nized only the positive roots. In a general way, Girard realized that
negative roots are directed in a sense opposite to that for positive
numbers, thus anticipating the idea of the number line. “The negative in
geometry indicates a retrogression,” he said, “where the positive is an
advance.” To him also seems to be largely due the realization that an
equation can have as many roots as is indicated by the degree of the
equation. Girard retained imaginary roots of equations because they show
the general principles in the formation of an equation from its
roots.</p>
<p>Discoveries much like those of Girard had been made even earlier by
Thomas Harriot, but these did not appear in print until ten years after
Harriot had died of cancer in 1621. Harriot had been hampered in
publication by conflicting political currents during the closing years
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He had been sent by Sir Walter
Raleigh as a surveyor on the latter’s expeditions to the New World in
1585, thus becoming the first substantial mathematician to set foot in
North America. (Brother Juan Diaz, a young chaplain with some
mathematical training, had earlier joined Cortes on an expedition to
Yucatan in 1518.) On his return, Harriot published A Briefe and True
Report of the Newfound Land of Virginia (1586). When his patron lost
favor with the queen and was executed, Harriot was granted a pension of
d300 a year by Henry, Earl of Northumberland, but in 1606, the earl was
committed to the Tower by James I, Elizabeth’s successor. Harriot
continued to meet with Henry in the Tower, and distractions and poor
health contributed to his failure to publish results.</p>
<p>Harriot knew of relationships between roots and coefficients and
between roots and factors, but like Viete, he was hampered by failure
to<code>take note of negative and imaginary roots. In notations, however, he advanced the use of symbolism, being responsible for the signs.and,for “greater than” and “less than.” It was also partly his use of Recorde’s equality sign that led to its ultimate adoption. Harriot showed much more moderation in the use of new notations than did his younger contemporary William Oughtred. The latter published his Clavis mathematicae in the same year, 1631, in which Harriot’s Praxis was printed. In the Clavis, the notation for powers was a step back toward Viete, for where Harriot had</code>
written AAAAAAA, for example, Oughtred used Aqqc (that is, A squared
squared cubed). Of all of Oughtred’s new notations, only one is now
widely used—the cross 3 for multiplication.</p>
<p>The homogeneous form of his equations shows that Viete’s
thought<code>was always close to geometry, but his geometry was not on the elementary level of so many of his predecessors’; it was on the higher level of Apollonius’s and Pappus’s. Interpreting the fundamental algebraic operations geometrically, Viete realized that straightedge and compasses suffice</code>
up through square roots. If, however, one permits the interpolation of
two geometric means between two magnitudes, one can construct cube
roots, or, a fortiori, geometrically solve any cubic equation. In this
case, one can, Viete showed, construct the regular heptagon, for this
construction leads
to<code>a cubic of the form x3 5ax1a. In fact, every cubic or quartic equation is solvable by angle trisections and the insertion of two geometric means between two magnitudes. Here we clearly see a very significant trend—the association of the new higher algebra with the ancient higher geometry. Analytic geometry could not, then, be far away, and Viete might have</code>
discovered this branch had he not avoided the geometric study of
indeterminate equations. The mathematical interests of Viete were
unusually<code>broad; hence, he had read Diophantus’s Arithmetica. Yet when a geometric problem led Viete to a final equation in two unknown quantities, he dis-</code>
missed it with the casual observation that the problem was
indeterminate. One wishes that with his general point of view, he had
inquired into the geometric properties of the indeterminacy.</p>
<p>The Approximate Solution of Equations</p>
<p>In many respects, the work of Viete is greatly undervalued, but in
one` case, it is possible that he has been given undue credit for a
method known much earlier in China. In one of his later works, the De
Numerosa Potestatum…Resolutione (1600), he gave a method for the
approximate solution of equations, which is virtually that known today
as Horner’s method.</p>
