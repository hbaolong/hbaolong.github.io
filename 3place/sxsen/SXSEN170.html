<h4 id="probability">Probability</h4>
<p>The theory of probability had many devotees during the early
eighteenth century, and De Moivre was one of the most important of
these. In 1711, he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions a long
memoir on the laws of chance, and this he expanded into a celebrated
volume, the Doctrine of Chances, that appeared in 1718 (and in later
editions). The memoir and the volume contained numerous questions on
dice, the problem of points (with unequal chances of winning), drawing
balls of various colors from a bag, and other games. Some of the
problems had appeared in Jacques Bernoulli’s Ars Conjectandi, the
publication of which was earlier than the Doctrine of Chances but later
than De Moivre’s memoir. In the preface to the Doctrine of Chances, the
author referred to the work on probability of Jacques, Jean, and
Nicolaus Bernoulli. The various editions of the volume contain more than
fifty problems on probability, as well as questions relating to life
annuities. In general, De Moivre derived the theory of permutations and
combinations from the principles of probability, whereas now it is
customary to reverse the roles. For example, to find the number of
permutations of two letters chosen from the six letters a, b, c, d, e,
and f, he argued that the probability that a particular letter will be
first is and the probability that another specific letter will be second
is . Hence, the probability that these two letters will appear in that
order is U, from which one concludes that the number of all possible
permutations, two at a time, is 30. De Moivre is often credited with the
principle, published in the Doctrine of Chances, that the probability of
a compound event is the product of the probabilities of its components,
but this had been implied in earlier works.</p>
<p>De Moivre was especially interested in developing for probability
general procedures and notations that he thought of as a new “algebra.”
A generalization of a problem given earlier by Huygens usually is
appropriately called De Moivre’s problem: to find the probability of
throwing a given number on a throw of n dice, each having m faces. Some
of his contributions to probability were published in a further volume,
the Miscellanea Analytica of 1730. In a supplement to this work, De
Moivre included some results that also appeared in the Methodus
Differentialis of James Stirling (1692 1770), published in the same year
as the Miscellanea Analytica. Among these is the approximation n!
p2πnðn=eÞn, which is usually known as Stirling’s formula, although it
was known earlier to De Moivre, and a series, also named for Stirling,
relating ln n! and the Bernoulli numbers.</p>
<p>De Moivre apparently was the first one to work with the probability
formula</p>
<p>N 2x2 5 pπ; e dx</p>
<p>0 2</p>
<p>a result that unobtrusively appeared in a privately printed pamphlet
of 1733 titled Approximatio ad summam terminorum binomii (a1b)n in
seriem expansi. This work, representing the first appearance of the law
of errors or the distribution curve, was translated by De Moivre and was
included in the second edition (1738) of his Doctrine of Chances. In his
work on Annuities upon Lives, which formed a part of the Doctrine of
Chances and was separately reprinted in more than half a dozen editions,
he adopted a rough-and-ready rule, known as “De Moivre’s hypothesis of
equal decrements,” that annuities can be computed on the assumption that
the number of a given group that die is the same during each year.</p>
<p>De Moivre’s Theorem</p>
<p>The Miscellanea Analytica is important not only in probability but
also in the development of the analytic side of trigonometry. The
well-known De Moivre’s theorem, ðcosθ1isinθÞn 5cosnθ1isinnθ, is not
explicitly given, but it is clear from the work on cyclometry and other
contexts that the author was quite familiar with this relationship,
probably as early as 1707. In a paper in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1707, De Moivre wrote that</p>
<p>1p 1=n 1 p 1=n ðsinnθ1 21cosnθÞ 1ðsinnθ2 21cosnθÞ 5sinθ:</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>In his Miscellanea Analytica of 1730, he expressed the equivalent
of</p>
<p>ðcosθ6isinθÞ1=n 5cos 2Kπ6θ 6isin 2Kπ6θ; n n</p>
<p>which he used to factor x2n 12x cos nθ11 into quadratic factors of
the form x2 12x cos θ11. Again in a Philosophical Transactions paper of
1739, he found the nth roots of the “impossible binomial” a1 2p b
through the procedure that we now use in taking the nth root of the
modulus, dividing the amplitude by n, and adding multiples of 2π/n.</p>
<p>De Moivre, dealing with imaginary numbers and the circular functions
in Miscellanea Analytica, came close to recognizing the hyperbolic
functions in extending theorems on sectors of circles to analogous
results on sectors of the rectangular hyperbola. In view of</p>
<p>Ro ger Co t e s</p>
<p>the breadth and depth of his results, it was natural that Newton in
his later years should have told those who came to him with questions on
mathematics, “Go to Mr. De Moivre; he knows these things better than I
do.”</p>
<p>In the Philosophical Transactions for 1697 1698, De Moivre had
written on the “infinitonome,” that is, an infinite polynomial or
infinite series, including the process of finding a root of such an
expression, and it was largely in recognition of this paper that he had
been elected a member of the Royal Society. De Moivre’s interest in
infinite series and probability is reminiscent of the Bernoullis’. De
Moivre carried on an extensive and cordial correspondence with Jean
Bernoulli during the decade 1704 to 1714, and it was the former who
proposed the latter for election to the Royal Society in 1712.</p>
