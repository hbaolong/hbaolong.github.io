<h4 id="the-theory-of-numbers">The Theory of Numbers</h4>
<p>Fermat’s contributions to analytic geometry and to infinitesimal
analysis were but two aspects of his work—and probably not his favorite
topics. In 1621, the Arithmetica of Diophantus had come to life again
through the Greek and Latin edition by Claude Gaspard de Bachet (1591
1639), a member of an informal group of scientists in Paris.
Diophantus’s Arithmetica had not been unknown, for Regiomontanus had
thought of printing it; several translations had appeared in the
sixteenth century, with little result for the theory of numbers. Perhaps
the work of Diophantus was too impractical for the practitioners and too
algorithmic for the speculatively inclined, but it appealed strongly to
Fermat, who became the founder of the modern theory of numbers. Many
aspects of</p>
<p>T he T he or y of Numb er s</p>
<p>the subject caught his fancy, including perfect and amicable numbers,
figurate numbers, magic squares, Pythagorean triads, divisibility, and,
above all, prime numbers. He proved some of his theorems by a method
that he called his “infinite descent”—a sort of inverted mathematical
induction, a process that Fermat was among the first to use. As an
illustration of his process of infinite descent, let us apply it to an
old andp familiar problem—the proof that 3 is not rational. Let us
assume that p35a1=b1, where al and b1 are positive integers with a1 .b1.
Because</p>
<p>1 p311 p 5 ;</p>
<p>321 2</p>
<p>on replacing the first p3 by its equal a1 /b1, we have</p>
<p>p 3b1 2a1</p>
<p>35: a1 2b1</p>
<p>In view of the inequality ,a1=b1 ,2, it is clear that 3b1 2a1 and a1
2b1 are positive integers, a2 and b2, each less than a1 and b1,
respectively, and such that p35a2=b2. This reasoning can be repeated
indefinitely, leading to an infinite descent in which an and bn are ever
smaller integers such that p35an=bn. This implies the false conclusion
that there is no smallest positive integer. Hence, the premise that p3
is a quotient of integers must be false.</p>
<p>Using his method of infinite descent, Fermat was able to prove
Girard’s assertion that every prime number of the form 4n11 can be
written in one and only one way as the sum of two squares. He showed
that if 4n11 is not the sum of two squares, there is always a smaller
integer of this form that is not the sum of two squares. Using this
recursive relationship backward leads to the false conclusion that the
smallest integer of this type, 5, is not the sum of two squares (whereas
5512 122). Hence, the general theorem is proved to be true. Because it
is easy to show that no integer of the form 4n21 can be the sum of two
squares and because all primes except 2 are of the form 4n11 or 4n21, by
Fermat’s theorem one can easily classify prime numbers into those that
are and those that are not the sum of two squares. The prime 23, for
example, cannot be so divided, whereas the prime 29 can be written as 22
152. Fermat knew that a prime of either form can be expressed as the
difference of two squares in one and only one way.</p>
<p>The Theorems of Fermat</p>
<p>Fermat used his method of infinite descent to prove that there is no
cube that is divisible into two cubes—that is, that there are no
positive integers x, y, and z such that x3 1y3 5z3. Going further,
Fermat stated the general proposition that for n, an integer greater
than 2, there are no positive integral values x, y, and z such that xn
1yn 5zn. He wrote in the margin of his copy of Bachet’s Diophantus that
he had a truly marvelous proof of this celebrated theorem, which has
since become known as Fermat’s “last,” or “great,” theorem. Fermat, most
unfortunately, did not give his proof but only described it as one
“which this margin is too narrow to contain.” If Fermat did indeed have
such a proof, it has remained lost to this day. Despite all efforts to
find a proof, once stimulated by a pre2World War I prize offer of
100,000 marks for a solution, the problem remained unsolved until the
1990s. Yet the search for solutions has led to even more good
mathematics than that which in antiquity resulted from efforts to solve
the three classical and unsolvable geometric problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps two millennia before Fermat’s day, there had been a “Chinese
hypothesis” that held that n is prime if and only if 2n 22 is divisible
by n, wherenisanintegergreaterthan1.Halfofthisconjectureisnowknownto
befalse,for2341 22isdivisibleby341,and34151131iscomposite, but the other
half is indeed valid, and Fermat’s “lesser” theorem is a generalization
of this. A consideration of many cases of numbers of the form ap 1 21,
including 236 21, suggested that whenever p is prime and a is prime to
p, then ap l 21 is divisible by p. On the basis of an induction from
only five cases (n50, 1, 2, 3, and 4), Fermat formulated a second
conjecture—that integers of the form 22n, now known as “Fermat numbers,”
are always prime. A century later, Euler showed this conjecture to be
false, for 225 11 is composite. In fact, it is now known that 22n 11 is
not prime for numerous ns above 5, and we begin to wonder whether there
is even one more prime Fermat number beyond those that Fermat knew.</p>
<p>Fermat’slessertheoremfaredbetterthanhisconjectureonprimeFermat
numbers. A proof of the theorem was left in manuscript by Leibniz, and
another elegant and elementary demonstration was published by Euler in
1736. The proof by Euler makes ingenious use of mathematical induction,
a device with which Fermat, as well as Pascal, was quite familiar. In
fact, mathematical induction, or reasoning by recurrence, is sometimes
referred to as “Fermatian induction,” to distinguish it from scientific,
or “Baconian,” induction.</p>
<p>Fermat was truly “the prince of amateurs” in mathematics. No
professional mathematician of his day made greater discoveries or
contributed more to the subject, yet Fermat was so modest that he
published virtually nothing. He was content to write of his thoughts to
Mersenne (whose name, incidentally, is preserved in connection with the
“Mersenne numbers,” that is, primes of the form 2p 21) and thus lost
priority credit for much of his work. In this respect, he shared the
fate of one of his most capable friends and contemporaries—the unamiable
professor Roberval, a</p>
<p>Gille s P er s one de Rob er val</p>
<p>member of the “Mersenne group” and the only truly professional
mathematician among the Frenchmen whom we discuss in this chapter.</p>
