<p>Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory the queen
of mathematics.</p>
<p>—Gauss</p>
<p>Nineteenth-Century Overview</p>
<p>The nineteenth century deserves to be known as the Golden Age in
mathematics. The additions to the subject during these one hundred years
far outweigh the total combined productivity of all preceding ages. The
century was also one of the most revolutionary in the history of
mathematics. The introduction into the mathematician’s repertoire of
concepts such as non-Euclidean geometries, n-dimensional spaces,
noncommutative algebras, infinite processes, and nonquantitative
structures all contributed to a radical transformation that changed the
appearance, as well as the definitions, of mathematics.</p>
<p>The geographic distribution of mathematical activity also began to
change. Hitherto, each major period of history seemed to be
characterized by specific geographic clusters where most advances in
mathematics took place. During the first half of the nineteenth century,
the center of mathematical activity became diffused. Nevertheless,
several decades passed before there were institutions that could boast
the mathematical strength of the French, epitomized by the École
Polytechnique. Most countries supported mathematical efforts directed
toward surveying, navigation, or other areas of application. Support for
research in pure mathematics—in time or money—was the exception, rather
than the rule. This is illustrated in the career of the greatest
mathematician of the time, who was German.</p>
<p>Gauss: Early Work</p>
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) enjoyed numerical computation as a
child; an anecdote that is told of his early schooling is
characteristic. One day, in order to keep the class occupied, the
teacher had the students add up all of the numbers from 1 to 100, with
instructions that each child should place his slate on a table as soon
as he had completed the task. Almost immediately, Carl placed his slate
on the table, saying, “There it is.” When the instructor finally looked
at the results, Gauss’s slate was the only one to have the correct
answer, 5050, with no further calculation. Evidently, the ten-year-old
boy had mentally computed the sum of the arithmetic progression 1 + 2 +
3 + . . . + 99 + 100, presumably through the formula m(m + 1)/2. His
teachers soon called Gauss’s talent to the attention of the Duke of
Brunswick, who supported his education, which first enabled him to study
at the local college, then at the University in Göttingen, where he
matriculated in October 1795.</p>
<p>The following March, still a month short of being nineteen years old,
Gauss made a brilliant discovery. For more than 2,000 years, men had
known how to construct, with compasses and straightedge, the equilateral
triangle and the regular pentagon (as well as certain other regular
polygons, the numbers of whose sides are multiples of two, three, and
five), but no other polygon with a prime number of sides. Gauss showed
that the regular polygon of seventeen sides could also be constructed
with compasses and straightedge.</p>
<p>Gauss commemorated his discovery by starting a diary in which, for
the next eighteen years, he noted many of his discoveries. He obtained
numerous results while still a student. Some were rediscoveries of
theorems established by Euler, Lagrange, and other eighteenth-century
mathematicians; many were new. Among the more significant discoveries of
his student days, we may single out the method of least squares, the
proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity in number theory, and his work
on the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</p>
<p>He earned his doctorate with a thesis titled “New Demonstration of
the Theorem That Every Rational Integral Algebraic Function in One
Variable Can Be Resolved into Real Factors of First or Second Degree.”
In this, the first of four proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
that he published during his life, Gauss stressed the importance of
demonstrating the existence of at least one root in proving the theorem
in question.</p>

<p>Gauss presented this doctoral thesis to the University of Helmstedt,
which had on its faculty Johann Friedrich Pfaff (1765–1825), who, next
to Gauss, was widely regarded as the ranking German mathematician of his
time. Today he is best known for an 1813 memoir on the integration of
systems of differential equations. On leaving Göttingen in 1798, he
returned to his native Brunswick, where he spent the next nine years
enjoying the continued support of the duke, waited for a suitable job,
got married, and made some of his major discoveries.</p>
<p>Number Theory</p>
<p>While still a student in Göttingen, Gauss had begun work on a major
publication in number theory. Appearing two years after his doctoral
dissertation, the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is one of the great
classics of mathematical literature. It consists of seven sections.
Culminating in two proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, the first
four sections are essentially a tightened recasting of
eighteenth-century number theory. Fundamental in the discussion are the
concepts of congruence and residue class. Section 5 is devoted to the
theory of binary quadratic forms, specifically the question of solutions
for equations of the form ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = m; the techniques developed
in this section became the basis for much work done by later generations
of number theorists. Section 6 consists of various applications. The
last section, which initially drew the most attention, deals with the
solution of the general cyclotomic equation of prime degree.</p>
<p>Gauss called the law of quadratic reciprocity, which Legendre had
published a couple of years earlier, the theorema aureum, or the gem of
arithmetic. In his later work, Gauss sought to find comparable theorems
for congruences xn ≡ p(mod q) for n = 3 and 4, but for these cases, he
found it necessary to extend the meaning of the word “integer” to
include the so-called Gaussian integers, that is, numbers of the form a
+ bi, where a and b are integers. The Gaussian integers form an integral
domain like that of the real integers but more general. Problems in
divisibility become more complicated, for 5 no longer is a prime, being
factorable into the product of the two “primes” 1 + 2i and 1 − 2i. In
fact, no real prime of the form 4n + 1 is a “Gaussian prime,” whereas
real primes of the form 4n − 1 remain primes in the generalized sense.
In the Disquisitiones, Gauss included the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic, one of the basic principles that continues to hold in the
integral domain of Gaussian integers. In fact, any integral domain for
which factoring is unique is known today as a Gaussian integral domain.
One of the contributions of the Disquisitiones was a rigorous proof of
the theorem, known since the days of Euclid, that any positive integer
can be represented in one and only one way (except for the order of the
factors) as a product of primes.</p>
<p>Not all that Gauss discovered about prime numbers is contained in the
Disquisitiones. On the back page of a copy of a table of logarithms that
he had obtained as a boy of fourteen is written cryptically in
German:</p>
<p>This is a statement of the celebrated prime number theorem: the
number of primes less than a given integer a approaches asymptotically
the quotient a/ln a as a increases indefinitely. The odd thing is that
if Gauss wrote this, as we presume he did, he kept this beautiful result
to himself. We do not know whether he had a proof of the theorem or even
when the statement was written.</p>
<p>In 1845, a Parisian professor, Joseph L. F. Bertrand (1822–1900),
guessed that if n &gt; 3, there is always at least one prime between n
and 2n (or, more precisely, 2n − 2) inclusive. This conjecture, known as
Bertrand’s postulate, was proved in 1850 by Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev
(1821–1894) of the University of St. Petersburg. Chebyshev was a rival
of Nikolay Ivanovich Lobachevsky as the leading Russian mathematician of
his day and became a foreign associate of the Institut de France and of
the Royal Society of London. Chebyshev, evidently unaware of Gauss’s
work on primes, was able to show that if π(n)(ln n)/n approaches a limit
as n increases indefinitely, this limit must be 1, but he could not
demonstrate the existence of a limit. Not until two years after
Chebyshev’s death was a proof generally known. Then, in 1896, two
mathematicians, working independently, came up with demonstrations in
the same year. One was the Belgian mathematician C. J. de la
Vallée-Poussin (1866–1962), who lived to be almost ninety-six; the other
was a Frenchman, Jacques Hadamard (1865–1963), who was almost
ninety-eight when he died.</p>
<p>Problems on the number and the distribution of primes have fascinated
many mathematicians from Euclid’s day to our own. What may be regarded
as a deep and difficult corollary to Euclid’s theorem on the infinity of
primes was proved by the mathematician who in 1855 was to succeed Gauss
at Göttingen. This was Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805–1859), the
man who did more than anyone else to amplify the Disquisitiones. The
Dirichlet theorem states not only that the number of prime numbers is
infinite, but that if one considers only those integers in an arithmetic
progression a, a + b, a + 2b, . . ., a + nb, in which a and b are
relatively prime, then even in this relatively sparser subset of the
integers, there still will be infinitely many primes. The proof
Dirichlet gave required complicated tools from analysis, where
Dirichlet’s name is again preserved in the Dirichlet test for uniform
convergence of a series. Among Dirichlet’s other contributions was the
first proof of Bertrand’s postulate. It should be noted that Dirichlet’s
theorem showed that the discrete domain of the theory of numbers cannot
be studied in isolation from the branch of mathematics dealing with
continuous variables—that is, that number theory requires the aid of
analysis. Gauss himself, in the Disquisitiones, had given a striking
example of the fact that the properties of prime numbers intrude in the
most unexpected ways even into the realm of geometry.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the Disquisitiones, Gauss included the first
important discovery he had made in mathematics: the construction of the
regular polygon of seventeen sides. He carried the topic to its logical
conclusion by showing which of the infinitely many possible regular
polygons can be constructed and which cannot. General theorems, such as
that which Gauss now proved, are of ever so much more value than a
single case, no matter how spectacular the single case may be. It will
be recalled that Fermat had believed that numbers of the form are
primes, a conjecture that Euler had shown to be incorrect. The number is
indeed prime, as are also and . Gauss had already shown the polygon of
seventeen sides to be constructible, and the question naturally arises
whether a regular polygon of 257 or 65,537 sides can be constructed with
Euclidean tools. In the Disquisitiones, Gauss answered the question in
the affirmative, showing that a regular polygon of N sides can be
constructed with Euclidean tools if and only if the number N is of the
form N = 2mplp2p3 . . . pr, where m is any positive integer and the p’s
are distinct Fermat primes. There remains one aspect of the problem that
Gauss did not answer, and that has not yet been answered. Is the number
of Fermat primes finite or infinite? For n = 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, it is
known that the Fermat numbers are not prime, and it appears possible
that there are five and only five constructible regular polygons of a
prime number of sides, two that were known in antiquity and the three
that were discovered by Gauss. A young man whom the aging Gauss admired,
Ferdinand Gotthold Eisenstein (1823–1852), an instructor of mathematics
at Berlin, added a new conjecture about prime numbers when he hazarded
the thought, unverified up to the present time, that numbers of the form
, and so on, are primes. To Gauss is attributed the remark that “There
have been only three epoch-making mathematicians, Archimedes, Newton,
and Eisenstein.” Whether, given a normal span of years, Eisenstein might
have fulfilled such a glowing prediction is a matter of conjecture, for
the young privatdozent died when he was not yet thirty years old.</p>
<p>Reception of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae</p>
<p>Many mathematicians introducing new methods or concepts have found
that these are viewed with skepticism until it becomes clear not only
that they are useful in obtaining new results but that they so far
exceed existing techniques as to make it worthwhile for a mature
researcher to learn them. Gauss, too, found this to be true in the case
of his great book on number theory. It created little initial attention;
only the algebraic contribution of the last section was noted with
approbation by French authors of the time. One of the very few
individuals who initiated a correspondence with Gauss for the purpose of
exchanging ideas about the number-theoretic aspects of the book was a
certain “Monsieur Leblanc”; this turned out to be Sophie Germain, a
mathematician who worked outside the established institutions that were
closed to women. Germain earned the respect and assistance not only of
Gauss but of Lagrange and Legendre; the latter attached her name to a
theorem that marks a major step in the three-century marathon effort to
prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. In another field, the Paris Academy of
Sciences awarded her a prize for a memoir on the mathematical theory of
elastic surfaces.</p>
<p>In general, however—and despite the availability in Paris of a French
translation after 1807—Gauss’s Disquisitiones arithmeticae lay dormant
until the late 1820s, when C. G. J. Jacobi (1804–1851) and P. G. Lejeune
Dirichlet first brought to light some of the deeper consequences to be
derived from the work.</p>
<p>Astronomy</p>
<p>It was astronomy, rather than number theory, that gained immediate
fame for the twenty-four-year-old author of the Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae. On January 1, 1801, Giuseppe Piazzi (1746–1826), the
director of the Palermo observatory, had discovered the new minor planet
(asteroid) Ceres, but a few weeks afterward, the tiny body was lost to
sight. Having most unusual computational ability, as well as the added
advantage of the method of least squares, Gauss took up the challenge to
compute, from the few recorded observations of the planet, the orbit in
which it moved. For the task of computing orbits from a limited number
of observations, he devised a scheme, known as Gauss’s method, that is
still used to track satellites. The result was a resounding success, the
planet being rediscovered at the end of the year in very nearly the
position indicated by his calculations. Gauss’s orbit computations
captured the attention of astronomers internationally and soon brought
him to prominence among German mathematical scientists, most of whom
were engaged in astronomical and geodesic activities at the time. In
1807, he was appointed director of the Göttingen observatory, a post he
held for nearly half a century. Two years later, his classic treatise on
theoretical astronomy, the Theoria Motus, appeared. It provided a clear
guide for carrying out orbital computations and by the time of his death
had been translated into English, French, and German.</p>
<p>Orbital computations were not the only area of astronomical research
in which Gauss distinguished himself and paved a path for succeeding
generations, however. Much of his time during the first decade of the
nineteenth century was spent in working on the problem of perturbations.
This had moved to the foreground of astronomers’ interests after the
discovery in 1802 of the minor planet Pallas by Gauss’s good friend, the
physician and amateur astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758–1840).
Pallas has a relatively large eccentricity and is particularly affected
by the gravitational attraction of other planets such as Jupiter and
Saturn. Determining the effect of these attractions is a specific
example of the n-body problem that Euler and Lagrange had previously
attacked for n = 2 or 3. Gauss’s work on this problem resulted not only
in astronomical memoirs but in two classical mathematical papers: one
dealt with infinite series, the other with a new method for numerical
analysis.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Middle Years</p>
<p>The decade in which Gauss arrived at the preceding results had been
filled with new discoveries, as well as emotionally draining events. He
had experienced early recognition and honors, happiness in marriage, and
fatherhood. But then came financial concerns resulting from levies
imposed by the occupying administration in Göttingen; the deaths of his
patron, the Duke of Brunswick, and of his wife and third child;
annoyance at the lack of appreciation of his work among scientists such
as the French astronomer J. B. J. Delambre; concern over raising his
children; and rapid entry into a second marriage. The previously
cheerful young genius became an austere figure whose strict sense of
duty often led him to seemingly rigid decisions in the nonscientific
realm. This image was intensified after the 1820s by the lingering
illness of his second wife, who died in 1831, and an estrangement from
one of his sons that lasted for more than a decade.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Gauss’s position as director of the Göttingen
observatory presented new challenges. Between 1810 and 1820, much of his
energy was absorbed by the building and outfitting of a new observatory.
He made the acquaintance of major instrument makers of the period and
involved himself with the details of instrument construction. Studies of
instruments and observations led him to significant results in error
theory. After 1815, his increasing comprehension of the nature of
instrumental, observational, and technical errors was reinforced by his
immersion in surveying and geodesy. The result was a set of reports on
error theory. During the 1820s, he was charged with the survey of the
Kingdom of Hannover, which meant that he spent numerous summers in the
field, personally conducting measurements, often under primitive and
hazardous conditions. The most significant publication that resulted
from the geometric considerations of the decade appeared in 1827, and it
opened a new direction in geometric and, ultimately, in physical
research.</p>
<p>Gauss was not especially fond of geometry, yet he thought about the
subject sufficiently to do two things: (1) to arrive, by 1824, at an
important unpublished conclusion on the parallel postulate; and (2) to
publish, in 1827, a classic treatise that generally is regarded as the
cornerstone of a new branch of geometry. Gauss, while still a student at
Göttingen, had tried to prove the parallel postulate, as had his
intimate friend Wolfgang (or Farkas) Bolyai (1775–1856) as well. Both
men continued to look for a proof, the latter giving up in despair, the
former eventually coming to the conviction that not only was no proof
possible, but that a geometry quite different from that of Euclid might
be developed. Had Gauss expanded and published his thoughts on the
parallel postulate, he would have been hailed as the inventor of
non-Euclidean geometry, but his silence on the subject resulted in
credit going to others, as we shall see further on.</p>
<p>Differential Geometry</p>
<p>The new branch of geometry that Gauss initiated in 1827 is known as
differential geometry, and it belongs perhaps more to analysis than to
the traditional field of geometry. Ever since the days of Newton and
Leibniz, men had applied the calculus to the study of curves in two
dimensions; in a sense, this work constituted a prototype of
differential geometry. Euler and Monge had extended this to include an
analytic study of surfaces; hence, they are sometimes regarded as the
fathers of differential geometry. Nevertheless, not until the appearance
of Gauss’s classical treatise Disquisitiones Circa Superficies Curvas
was there a comprehensive volume devoted entirely to the subject.
Roughly speaking, ordinary geometry is interested in the totality of a
given diagram or figure, whereas differential geometry concentrates on
the properties of a curve or a surface in the immediate neighborhood of
a point on the curve or the surface. In this connection, Gauss extended
the work of Huygens and Clairaut on the curvature of a plane or a gauche
curve at a point by defining the curvature of a surface at a point—the
“Gaussian curvature” or “the total curvature.” If at a point P on a
well-behaved surface S one erects a line N normal to S, the pencil of
planes through N will cut the surface S in a family of plane curves,
each of which will have a radius of curvature. The directions of the
curves with the largest and smallest radii of curvature, R and r, are
called the principal directions on S at P, and they always happen to be
perpendicular to each other. The quantities R and r are known as the
principal radii of curvature of S at P, and the Gaussian curvature of S
at P is defined as K = 1/rR. (The quantity , known as the mean curvature
of S at P, also turns out to be useful.) Gauss gave formulas for K in
terms of the partial derivatives of the surface with respect to various
coordinate systems, curvilinear as well as Cartesian; he also discovered
what even he regarded as “remarkable theorems” about properties of
families of curves, such as geodesics, drawn on the surface.</p>
<p>Gauss began the treatment of curved surfaces by using the parametric
equation of a surface introduced by Euler. That means if a point (x, y,
z) of a surface can be represented by the parameters u and v so that x =
x(u, v), y = y(u, v), and z = z(u, v), then dx = adu + a′dv, dy = bdu +
b′dv, dz = cdu + c′dv, where a = xu, a′ = xv, b = yu, b′ = yv, c = zu,
and c′ = zv. Considering the arc length ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2,
expressing this in the parametric coordinates gives ds2 = (adu + a′dv)2
+ (bdu + b′dv)2 + (cdu + c′dv)2 = Edu2 + 2Fdudv + Gdv2, where E = a2 +
b2 + c2, F = aa′ + bb′ + cc′, and G = a′2 + b′2 + c′2. Gauss proceeded
to show that the properties of a surface depend only on E, F, and G.
This leads to many consequences. In particular, it becomes easy to say
what properties of the surface remain invariant. It was in building on
this work of Gauss that Bernhard Riemann and later geometers transformed
the subject of differential geometry.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Later Work</p>
<p>By the time the work on curved surfaces had appeared, the
mathematical climate in Germany was beginning to change. One of the most
significant aspects of this change was the founding of a new journal in
1809. This was the Annales de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées, edited
by Joseph-Diaz Gergonne (1771–1859). In Germany, a periodical similar to
Gergonne’s Annales, and even more successful, was begun in 1826 by
August Leopold Crelle (1780–1855) under the title Journal für die reine
und angewandte Mathematik. So heavily weighted were the articles in the
direction of pure (reine) mathematics (notably those by Abel, six of
which appeared in the very first volume) that wags suggested the title
might be more appropriate if the two German words und angewandte (“and
applied”) were replaced by the single word unangewandte (“unapplied”).
Gauss contributed two short articles to this new venture: one was a
proof of “Harriot’s theorem in algebra,” the other contained the
statement of Gauss’s principle of least constraint. He continued to
submit his major memoirs to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der
Wissenschaften, however. An important memoir on capillarity was
published by the Göttingen Society, as were his two influential memoirs
on number theory. Historians often cite the first of these, published in
1832, because it contains Gauss’s geometric representation of complex
numbers. The importance of the memoir as a whole lies in the fact that
it pointed the way to extending the theory of numbers from the reals to
the complex field and beyond. As noted previously, this was crucial in
the work of later mathematicians.</p>
<p>At the more elementary level, it is interesting to observe that the
graphical representation of complex numbers had already been discovered
in 1797 by Caspar Wessel (1745–1818) and published in the transactions
of the Danish academy for 1798, but Wessel’s work went virtually
unnoticed; hence, today the plane of complex numbers is usually referred
to as the Gaussian plane, even though Gauss did not publish his views
until some thirty years after Wessel did. No one before Wessel and Gauss
took the obvious step of thinking of the real and imaginary parts of a
complex number a + bi as rectangular coordinates of points in a plane.
Imaginary numbers, for these could now be visualized in the sense that
every point in the plane corresponds to a complex number, and the old
ideas about the nonexistence of imaginary numbers were generally
abandoned.</p>
<p>During the last twenty years of his life, Gauss published only two
major papers of mathematical interest. One was his fourth proof of the
fundamental theorem of algebra, which he released at the time of his
doctoral jubilee in 1849, fifty years after the publication of his first
proof. The other was an influential memoir on potential theory, which
appeared in 1840, in one of the volumes of geomagnetic results that he
coedited with his younger friend, the physicist Wilhelm Weber
(1804–1891). Geomagnetic issues occupied much of his time in the 1830s
and early forties; he also devoted effort in the late thirties to issues
pertaining to weights and measures. Most of his publications in the last
decade of his life reflect work at the astronomical observatory; they
deal with the newer minor planets, with observations of the recently
discovered planet Neptune, and with other data of interest to
astronomers of the day, who read of them in the Astronomische
Nachrichten.</p>
<p>Gauss’s mathematics provided the starting point for some of the main
research areas of modern mathematics. Except for his personal fame and
the fortune he amassed by making shrewd investments, his external
circumstances were similar to those of many earlier mathematicians,
however. His main obligations lay in running an observatory and
performing various duties for his government. He had teaching
responsibilities, but because most of his students were ill-prepared, he
avoided classroom teaching as much as possible, feeling that the returns
were not worth the investment in time. His best students tended to
become astronomers, rather than mathematicians, although some, such as
August Ferdinand Möbius, made a name for themselves in mathematics. Most
of his research results, aside from those published as books, appeared
in the publications of the Göttingen Society of Science or in journals
devoted to astronomy and geodesy—initially, in Franz Xaver von Zach’s
Monatliche Korrespondenz zur Beförderung der Erd-und Himmelskunde; after
1820, in the Astronomische Nachrichten. His mathematical communications
were restricted to correspondence with a few friends and occasional
visits of younger colleagues from abroad.</p>
<p>Gauss’s Influence</p>
<p>Despite the relatively small number of well-known mathematicians who
could claim to be Gauss’s students in the formal sense, it is hard to
overestimate the influence Gauss had on successive generations. Those
who studied his publications, the few who came to see him, the ones who
followed the new avenues of research he had opened include some of the
best-known mathematicians of the nineteenth century. When it came to his
expressed opinion of the work of others, his impact was not always
salutary, however. Toward the end of his life, Gauss may have become
uncharacteristically generous in his comments; we note the well-deserved
appreciation of Riemann’s habilitation and the questionable enthusiasm
concerning Eisenstein.</p>
<p>We now turn to the work of some who benefited directly from study of
his publications, especially the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, and from
indirect encouragement through the example he set. In several cases,
their studies of Gauss’s work supplemented their exposure to the
investigations of Legendre.</p>
<p>Abel</p>
<p>Niels Henrik Abel’s short life (1802–1829) was filled with poverty
and tragedy. He was born into a large family, the son of the pastor of
the little village of Findo in Norway. When he was sixteen, his teacher
urged him to read the great books in mathematics, including the
Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of Gauss. In his reading, Abel noted that
Euler had proved the binomial theorem only for rational powers, so he
filled the gap by giving a proof valid for the general case. When Abel
was eighteen, his father died, and much of the care of the family fell
on his young and weak shoulders, yet within the next year, he made a
remarkable mathematical discovery. Ever since the cubic and quartic
equations had been solved in the sixteenth century, men had studied the
quintic. Abel at first thought he had hit on a solution, but in 1824, he
published a memoir, “On the Algebraic Resolution of Equations,” in which
he reached the opposite conclusion. He gave the first proof that no
solution is possible, thus putting an end to the long search. There can
be no general formula, expressed in explicit algebraic operations on the
coefficients of a polynomial equation, for the roots of the equation if
the degree of the equation is greater than 4. An earlier proof, less
satisfactory and generally overlooked, of the insolvability of the
quintic had been published in 1799 by Paolo Ruffini (1765–1822), and
hence the result is now referred to as the Abel-Ruffini theorem.</p>
<p>When Abel visited Paris in 1826, he hoped his research results would
gain him recognition by members of the Academy. He found the city
inhospitable, however, and wrote home to a friend, “Every beginner has a
great deal of difficulty in getting noticed here. I have just finished
an extensive treatise on a certain class of transcendental functions but
Mr. Cauchy scarcely deigns to glance at it.” The publication in question
contained what he considered the jewel in his bag of mathematical
treasures, “Abel’s addition theorem,” a grand generalization of Euler’s
addition theorems on elliptic integrals. Before arriving in Paris, Abel
had spent some time in Berlin and had been well received by Crelle, who
was about to inaugurate his new Journal. He invited Abel to contribute
to the publication. Abel complied; the first volume contained six
articles by him, which were followed by more for succeeding volumes.
They included the expanded version of his proof of the insolvability of
the quintic, as well as his further contributions to the theory of
elliptic and hyperelliptic functions. While these were appearing in
Berlin, Abel had returned to his native Norway; increasingly weakened by
tuberculosis, he kept sending more material to Crelle. He died in 1829,
scarcely aware of the interest his publications were creating. Two days
after his death, a letter arrived offering him a position in Berlin.</p>
<p>Jacobi</p>
<p>What created something of a sensation and helped increase the
readership of Crelle’s new journal was the fact that Abel was not alone
in his new discoveries. The Prussian mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob
Jacobi (1804–1851) was obtaining many of the same results independently;
moreover, he, too, was publishing them in the early volumes of Crelle’s
journal. It became apparent to men such as Legendre that both Abel and
Jacobi were forging new tools of great consequence. What was not
generally known was that the unpublished memoranda of Gauss hung like a
sword of Damocles over mathematics of the first half of the nineteenth
century. When an important new development was announced by others, it
frequently turned out that Gauss had had the idea earlier but had
permitted it to go unpublished. Among the striking instances of this
situation was the disclosure of elliptic functions, a discovery in which
four outstanding figures are involved. One of these was, of course,
Legendre, who had spent some forty years studying elliptic integrals
almost single-handedly. He had developed a great many formulas, some of
them resembling relationships among inverse trigonometric functions (a
number of which had been known much earlier to Euler). This was not
surprising, inasmuch as the elliptic integral</p>
<p>includes</p>
<p>as the special case for which K = 0. Yet it remained for Gauss and
his two younger contemporaries to take full advantage of a point of view
that greatly facilitates the study of elliptic integrals. If</p>
<p>then u = arcsin v. Here u is expressed as a function of the
independent variable v (x being only the dummy variable for
integrating), but it turns out to be more felicitous to reverse the
roles of u and v by choosing u as the independent variable. In this
case, we have v = f(u), or, in the language of trigonometry, v = sin u.
The function v = sin u is more expeditiously manipulated, and it has a
striking property that u = arcsin v does not have: it is periodic. The
private papers of Gauss show that perhaps as early as 1800, he had
discovered the double periodicity of elliptic (or lemniscatic)
functions. It was not until 1827–1828, however, that this remarkable
property was disclosed by Abel.</p>
<p>In 1829, Jacobi wrote to Legendre to inquire about the memoir Abel
had left with Cauchy, for Jacobi had intimations that it touched on his
outstanding discovery. On looking into the matter, Cauchy in 1830 dug up
the manuscript, which Legendre later described as “a monument more
lasting than bronze,” and it was published in 1841 by the French
Institut among the memoirs presented by foreigners. It contained an
important generalization of Legendre’s work on elliptic integrals.
If</p>
<p>u is a function of v, u = f(v), the properties of which had been very
extensively described by Legendre in his treatise on elliptic integrals.
What Legendre had missed and what Gauss, Abel, and Jacobi saw was that
by inverting the functional relationship between u and v, one obtains a
more useful and more beautiful function, v = f(u). This function,
usually written v = sn u and read as “v is the sine amplitude of u,”
together with others defined in a somewhat similar manner, are known as
elliptic functions. (Some historical confusion has arisen because
Legendre used the phrase “fonctions elliptiques” to refer to elliptic
integrals and not to what are now known as elliptic functions.)</p>
<p>The most striking property of these new higher transcendental
functions was, as their three independent discoverers saw, that in the
theory of complex variables they have a double periodicity, that is,
there are two complex numbers m and n, such that v = f(u) = f(u + m) =
f(u + n). Whereas the trigonometric functions have only a real period (a
period of 2π) and the function ex has only an imaginary period (2πi),
the elliptic functions have two distinct periods. So impressed was
Jacobi with the simplicity achieved through a simple inversion of the
functional relationship in elliptic integrals that he regarded the
advice “You must always invert” as the secret of success in
mathematics.</p>
<p>Jacobi also deserves credit for several critical theorems related to
elliptic functions. In 1834, he proved that if a single-valued function
of one variable is doubly periodic, the ratio of the periods cannot be
real, and that it is impossible for a single-valued function of a single
independent variable to have more than two distinct periods. To him, we
also owe a study of the “Jacobi theta functions,” a class of quasi
doubly periodic entire functions of which the elliptic functions are
quotients.</p>
<p>The fateful misplaced memoir by Abel contained the hint of something
even more general than the elliptical functions. If one replaces the
elliptic integral with</p>
<p>where P(x) is a polynomial the degree of which may exceed four, and
if one again inverts the relationship between u and v, to obtain v =
f(u), this function is a special case of what is known as an Abelian
function. It was Jacobi, however, who in 1832 first demonstrated that
the inversion can be carried out not only for a single variable but for
functions of several variables.</p>
<p>The most celebrated results of his research were those in elliptic
functions, published in 1829, which brought him the praise of Legendre.
By means of this new analysis, Jacobi later proved again the four-square
theorem of Fermat and Lagrange. In 1829, Jacobi also published a paper
in which he made extensive and general use of Jacobians, expressing
these in a more modern form than had Cauchy:</p>
<p>Jacobi became so enamored of functional determinants that he insisted
on thinking of ordinary numerical determinants as Jacobians of n linear
functions in n unknowns.</p>
<p>Jacobi’s use of functional determinants in a paper on algebra in 1829
was only incidental, as had been that of Cauchy. Had this been the only
contribution from the pen of Jacobi, his name would not have been
attached to the particular determinant that we are considering. In 1841,
however, he published a long memoir, “De Determinantibus
Functionalibus,” specifically devoted to the Jacobian. He pointed out,
among other things, that this functional determinant is in many ways an
analogue, for functions of several variables, to the differential
quotient of a function of a single variable, and, of course, he called
attention to its role in determining whether a set of equations or
functions is independent. He showed that if a set of n functions in n
variables are functionally related, the Jacobian must vanish
identically; if the functions are mutually independent, the Jacobian
cannot be identically zero.</p>
<p>Galois</p>
<p>Young geniuses whose lives were cut short by death from dueling or
consumption are part of the real and fictional literary tradition of the
Romantic Age. Someone wishing to present a mathematical caricature of
such lives could do no better than to create the characters of Abel and
Galois. Évariste Galois (1812–1832) was born just outside Paris in the
village of Bourg-la-Reine, where his father served as mayor. His
well-educated parents had not shown any particular aptitude for
mathematics, but the young Galois did acquire from them an implacable
hatred of tyranny. When he first entered school at the age of twelve, he
showed little interest in Latin, Greek, or algebra, but he was
fascinated by Legendre’s Geometry. Later, he read with understanding the
algebra and the analysis in the works of masters such as Lagrange and
Abel, but his routine class work in mathematics remained mediocre, and
his teachers regarded him as eccentric. By the age of sixteen, Galois
knew what his teachers had failed to recognize—that he was a
mathematical genius. He hoped, therefore, to enter the school that had
nurtured so many celebrated mathematicians, the École Polytechnique, but
his lack of systematic preparation resulted in his rejection.</p>
<p>This disappointment was followed by others. A paper Galois wrote and
presented to the Academy when he was seventeen was held up by Cauchy; he
failed in a second attempt to enter the École Polytechnique; worst of
all, his father, feeling persecuted because of clerical intrigues,
committed suicide. Galois entered the École Normale to prepare for
teaching; he also continued his research. In 1830, he submitted another
paper to the Academy in a prize competition. Fourier, as secretary of
the Academy, received the paper but died shortly thereafter, and this
memoir was lost. Faced on all sides by tyranny and frustration, Galois
made the cause of the 1830 revolution his own. A blistering letter
criticizing the indecision of the director of the École Normale resulted
in Galois’s expulsion. A third effort to present a paper to the Academy
resulted in its being returned by Poisson with a request for proofs.
Thoroughly disillusioned, Galois joined the National Guard. In 1831, he
was twice arrested; he had proposed a toast in a gathering of
republicans that was interpreted as a threat on the life of King Louis
Philippe. Shortly afterward, he became involved with a coquette and was
challenged to a duel. The night before the duel, with forebodings of
death, Galois spent the hours jotting down, in a letter to a friend
named Chevalier, notes for posterity concerning his discoveries. He
asked that the letter be published (as it was within the year) in the
Revue Encydopédique and expressed the hope that Jacobi and Gauss might
publicly give their opinion as to the importance of the theorems. On the
morning of May 30, 1832, Galois met his adversary in a duel with
pistols, which resulted in his death the following day. He was twenty
years old.</p>
<p>In 1846, Joseph Liouville edited several memoirs and manuscript
fragments of Galois and published these, along with the last letter to
Chevalier in his Journal de Mathématiques. This marks the beginning of
the effective dissemination of Galois’s ideas, although some clues to
Galois’s work had been published earlier. Two papers by Galois had
appeared in Ferussac’s Bulletin Sciences Mathématiques of 1830. In the
first, Galois had listed three criteria for the solvability of a
“primitive” equation; the chief of these was the beautiful proposition
that</p>
<p>In order that an irreducible equation of prime degree be solvable by
radicals, it is necessary and sufficient that all its roots be rational
functions of any two of them.</p>
<p>Aside from referring to Gauss’s cyclotomic equation and noting that
his results had been derived from the theory of permutations, this paper
contained no indication of the method used to derive results and no
proofs. In the other paper, on number theory, Galois showed how to
construct finite fields of order p given the root of an irreducible
congruence of degree n mod p. Here, too, he stressed the analogy to
Gauss’s results in Section III of the Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. His
letter to Chevalier, published in September 1832, had contained an
outline of the main results of the memoir that had been returned by the
Academy. There, Galois had indicated what he considered to be the
essential part of his theory. In particular, he stressed the difference
between adjoining one or all of the roots of the resolvent and related
it to the decomposition of the group G of the equation. In modern
terminology, he indicated that an extension of the given field is normal
if and only if the corresponding subgroup is a normal subgroup of G. He
observed that an equation whose group cannot be properly decomposed (one
whose group does not have a normal subgroup) should be transformed into
one that can. Then, he noted the equivalent of saying that an equation
is solvable if and only if one obtains a chain of normal subgroups of
prime index. Unaccompanied by proofs, definitions, or adequate
explanations of the new concepts involved, the profound content of the
letter was not understood until Liouville published the full memoir,
along with these previously published papers.</p>
<p>The main goal of the memoir is the proof of the theorem quoted
previously. The memoir contains the important notion of
“adjunction”:</p>
<p>We shall call every quantity rational which is expressed as a
rational function of the coefficients of the equation and of a certain
number of quantities adjoined to the equation and selected
arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Galois noted that Gauss’s cyclotomic equation of prime degree n is
irreducible until a root of one of the auxiliary equations is adjoined.
Gauss, in his criteria for the constructibility of regular polygons, had
in essence solved the question of the solvability of the equation a0Xn +
an = 0 in terms of rational operations and square roots on the
coefficients. Galois generalized the result to provide criteria for the
solvability of in terms of rational operations and nth roots on the
coefficients. His approach to the problem, now known as Galois theory,
was another of the highly original contributions to algebra in the
nineteenth century. Yet it has been said that Galois theory is like
garlic, in that there is no such thing as a little of it. One must make
a substantial study of it to appreciate the reasoning—as Galois’s
experience with his contemporaries showed. Nevertheless, we can indicate
in a general way what is behind Galois theory and why it has been
important.</p>
<p>Galois began his investigations with some work of Lagrange on
permutations on the roots of a polynomial equation. Any change in the
ordered arrangement of n objects is called a permutation on these
objects. If, for example, the order of the letters a, b, c is changed to
c, a, b, this permutation is written succinctly as (acb), a notation in
which each letter is taken into the letter immediately following, the
first letter being understood to be the successor of the last letter.
Thus, the letter a was carried into c, c in turn was carried into b, and
b went into a. The notation (ac) or (ac, b), however, means that a goes
into c, c goes into a, and b goes into itself. If two permutations are
performed successively, the resulting permutation is known as the
product of the two permutation transformations. Thus, the product of
(acb) and (ac, b), written as (acb)(ac, b), is the permutation (a, bc).
The identical permutation I takes each letter into itself—that is, it
leaves the order a, b, c unchanged. The set of all permutations on the
letters a, b, c clearly satisfies the definition of a group, given in
chapter 20 on geometry; this group, containing six permutations, is
known as the symmetric group on a, b, c. In the case of n distinct
elements, x1, x2, . . . , xn, the symmetric group on these contains n!
transformations. If these elements are the roots of an irreducible
equation, the properties of the symmetric group provide necessary and
sufficient conditions that the equation be solvable by radicals.</p>
<p>Inspired by Abel’s proof of the insolvability by radicals of the
quintic equation, Galois discovered that an irreducible algebraic
equation is solvable by radicals if and only if its group—that is, the
symmetric group on its roots—is solvable. The description of a solvable
group is quite complicated, involving as it does relationships between
the group and its subgroups. The three permutations (abc), (abc)2, and
(abc)3 = I form a subgroup of the symmetric group on a, b, and
c. Lagrange had already shown that the order of a subgroup must be a
factor of the order of the group, but Galois went deeper and found
relations between the factorability of the group of an equation and the
solvability of the equation. Moreover, to him we owe the use in 1830 of
the word “group” in its technical sense in mathematics and the concept
of a normal subgroup.</p>
<p>Although his work was done before that of most of the British
algebraists of the great period 1830–1850, Galois’s ideas were without
influence until they were published in 1846. Presence in Paris did not
guarantee success to even the brightest young mathematical minds of the
day. Abel and Galois are the most illustrious examples of men who felt
frustrated by their failure to find the recognition they sought in
Paris.</p>
<p>The situation had changed by the time Liouville published Galois’s
work in his Journal. By midcentury, a substantial number of
mathematicians were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and
England. Each country had established a major mathematical journal in
the second quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the
Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées. The Cambridge Mathematical
Journal followed. Crelle’s journal continued to thrive, with much active
support from Dirichlet and his students.</p>
<p>Gauss and Cauchy died within two years of each other, the former in
1855, the latter in 1857. They had been preceded in death by many of
their contemporaries, including some of their younger followers; they
were followed, in 1859, by Dirichlet and Alexander von Humboldt. In this
respect, the 1850s mark the end of an era. But the decade also brought a
new direction to the continued unfolding of the mathematical legacy of
Gauss and Cauchy: that which emerged from the work of Bernhard Riemann
(1826–1866).</p>
