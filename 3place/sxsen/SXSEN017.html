Renaissance</h4>
<p>I will sette as I doe often in woorke use, a paire of parallels, or
Gemowe [twin] lines of one lengthe, thus: ===, bicause noe 2. thynges,
can be moare equalle.</p>
<p>—Robert Recorde</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The fall of Constantinople in 1453 signaled the collapse of the
Byzantine Empire. It is frequently asserted that at that time, refugees
fled to Italy with treasured manuscripts of ancient Greek treatises,
thereby putting the Western European world in touch with the works of
antiquity. It is as likely, though, that the fall of the city had just
the opposite effect: that now the West could no longer count on what had
been a dependable source of manuscript material for ancient classics,
both literary and mathematical. Whatever the ultimate decision may be on
this matter, there can be no question that mathematical activity was
again rising during the middle years of the fifteenth century. Europe
was recovering from the physical and spiritual shock of the Black Death,
and the then recent invention of printing with movable type made it
possible for learned works to become much more widely available than
ever before. The earliest printed book from Western Europe is dated
1447, and by the end of the century, more than 30,000 editions of
various works were available. Of these, few were mathematical, but the
few, coupled with existing manuscripts, provided a base for
expansion.</p>
<p>The recovery of unfamiliar Greek geometric classics was at first less
significant than the printing of medieval Latin translations of Arabic
algebraic and arithmetic treatises, for few men of the fifteenth century
either read Greek or were sufficiently proficient in mathematics to
profit from the works of the better Greek geometers. In this respect,
mathematics differed from literature and even from the natural sciences.
As Humanists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries fell ever more
deeply in love with the newly rediscovered Greek treasures in science
and the arts, their estimate of the immediately preceding Latin and
Arabic achievements declined. On the other hand, classical mathematics,
except for the most elementary portions of Euclid, was accessible only
to those with a high degree of preliminary training; hence, the
disclosure of Greek treatises in this field did not at first seriously
impinge on the continuing medieval mathematical tradition. Medieval
Latin studies in elementary geometry and the theory of proportions, as
well as Arabic contributions to arithmetic operations and algebraic
methods, did not present difficulties comparable to those associated
with the works of Archimedes and Apollonius. It was the more elementary
branches that were to attract notice and to appear in printed works. At
the same time, significant differences characterizing the language and
scope of a reborn mathematics emerged. Probably no one’s life is more
representative of the changing factors that affected this transitional
period than that of the man known as Regiomontanus.</p>
<p>Regiomontanus</p>
<p>Perhaps the most influential mathematician of the fifteenth century,
Johann Müller (1436–1476), born near Königsberg in Franconia, adopted
the name Regiomontanus, the Latin form of “King’s Mountain.” A
precocious student with an early interest in mathematics and astronomy,
he attended the University of Leipzig before heading for the University
of Vienna at age fourteen, where he studied with Georg Peurbach
(1423–1469), taught courses in geometry, and collaborated with Peurbach
in observational and theoretical studies of astronomy. A year before
Peurbach’s death, Cardinal Bessarion, then papal legate to the Holy
Roman Empire, who was known for his efforts on behalf of uniting the
Greek and Roman churches and for wishing to spread knowledge of the
Greek classics, came to Vienna. He had a special interest in seeing a
new translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest and suggested to Peurbach that he
undertake this work. Peurbach bequeathed the task to Regiomontanus, who
became attached to Bessarion, accompanying him to Rome, spending time
and lecturing at Padua when Bessarion became papal legate to the
Venetian Republic, and meeting numerous international scholars, some of
whom were influential in helping him gain access to major observatories
and library collections.</p>
<p>Among the cities in Central Europe where individuals and institutions
assumed leadership in mathematics and astronomy at this time were
Vienna, Cracow, Prague, and Nuremberg. It was Nuremberg where
Regiomontanus settled on returning to Germany; it would become a center
for the printing of books (as well as for learning, art, and invention),
and some of the greatest scientific classics were published there toward
the middle of the sixteenth century. In Nuremberg, Regiomontanus had
acquired a new patron, and with this merchant’s support, Regiomontanus
established a printing press and an observatory. The trade list of books
he hoped to print survives. It includes translations of works by
Archimedes, Apollonius, Heron, Ptolemy, and Diophantus. We also know of
a variety of astronomical instruments that he designed, including
torqueta, astrolabes, and other astronomical measuring devices; some
were built in his small workshop. Like his other plans, his hopes to
straighten out various discrepancies in astronomy remained largely
unfulfilled, however, because, having been called to Rome for a
conference on reform of the calendar, he died there under disputed
circumstances.</p>
<p>In astronomy, Regiomontanus’s chief contribution was the completion
of the new Latin version, begun by Peurbach, of Ptolemy’s Almagest. A
new textbook of astronomy, Peurbach’s Theoricae Novae Planetarum, was
published in Regiomontanus’s shop in 1472; it was an improvement on the
ubiquitous copies of the Sphere of Sacrobosco. Regiomontanus’s
translation project also resulted in textbooks of his own. His Epitome
of Ptolemy’s Almagest is noteworthy for its emphasis on the mathematical
portions that had often been omitted in commentaries dealing with
elementary descriptive astronomy. Of greater significance for
mathematics, however, was his De Triangulis Omnimodis, a systematic
account of the methods for solving triangles that marked the rebirth of
trigonometry.</p>
<p>Humanists, who insisted on elegance and purity in their classical
languages, welcomed new translations in the sciences, as well as the
humanities, because they abhorred the barbarous medieval Latin, as well
as the Arabic from which it often was derived. Regiomontanus shared the
Humanists’ love of classical learning, but unlike most of them, he
respected the traditions of Scholastic and Islamic scholarship, as well
as the practical innovations of mathematical practitioners.</p>
<p>Trigonometry</p>
<p>The first book of De Triangulis, composed about 1464, opens with
fundamental notions, derived largely from Euclid, on magnitudes and
ratios; then there are more than fifty propositions on the solution of
triangles, using the properties of right triangles. Book II begins with
a clear statement and proof of the law of sines and then includes
problems on determining sides, angles, and areas of plane triangles when
given determinate conditions. Among the problems, for example, is the
following: if the base of a triangle and the angle opposite are known,
and if either the altitude to the base or the area is given, then the
sides can be found. Book III contains theorems of the sort found in
ancient Greek texts on “spherics” before the use of trigonometry; Book
IV is on spherical trigonometry, including the spherical law of
sines.</p>
<p>The use of area “formulas,” written out in words, was among the
novelties in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, but in the avoidance of the
tangent function, the work falls short of al-Tusi’s (Nasir Eddin’s)
treatment. The tangent function nevertheless was included in another
trigonometric treatise by Regiomontanus—Tabulae Directionum.</p>
<p>Revisions of Ptolemy had suggested the need for new tables, and these
were supplied by a number of fifteenth-century astronomers, of whom
Regiomontanus was one. In order to avoid fractions, it was customary to
adopt a large value for the radius of the circle, or the sinus totus.
For one of his sine tables, Regiomontanus followed his immediate
predecessors in using a radius of 600,000; for others, he adopted
10,000,000 or 600,000,000. For his tangent table in Tabulae Directionum,
he chose 100,000. He does not call the function “tangent” but uses only
the word “numerus” for the entries, degree by degree, in a tabulation
headed “Tabula fecunda” (“Productive Table”). The entry for 89° is
5,729,796, and for 90° it is simply infinite.</p>
<p>The sudden death of Regiomontanus occurred before his two
trigonometric works were published, and this considerably delayed their
effect. The Tabulae Directionum was published in 1490, but the more
important treatise, De Triangulis, appeared in print only in 1533 (and
again in 1561). Nevertheless, the works were known in manuscript form to
the circle of mathematicians in Nuremberg, where Regiomontanus was
working, and it is very likely that they influenced work of the early
sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Algebra</p>
<p>A general study of triangles led Regiomontanus to consider problems
of geometric construction somewhat reminiscent of Euclid’s Division of
Figures. For example, one is asked to construct a triangle given one
side, the altitude to this side, and the ratio of the other two sides.
Here, however, we find a striking departure from ancient customs:
whereas Euclid’s problems invariably had been given in terms of general
quantities, Regiomontanus gave his lines specific numerical values, even
where he intended that his methods should be general. This enabled him
to make use of the algorithmic methods developed by Arabic algebraists
and transmitted to Europe in twelfth-century translations. In the
example cited, one of the unknown sides can be expressed as a root of a
quadratic equation with known numerical coefficients, and this root is
constructible by devices familiar from Euclid’s Elements or
al-Khwarizmi’s Algebra. (As Regiomontanus expressed it, he let one part
be the “thing” and then solved by the rule of “thing” and “square”—that
is, through quadratic equations.) Another problem in which Regiomontanus
called for the construction of a cyclic quadrilateral, given the four
sides, can be handled similarly.</p>
<p>The influence of Regiomontanus in algebra was restricted not only by
his adherence to the rhetorical form of expression and by his early
death; his manuscripts, on his death, came into the hands of his
Nuremberg patron, who failed to make the work effectively accessible to
posterity. Europe learned its algebra painfully and slowly from the thin
Greek, Arabic, and Latin traditions that trickled down through the
universities, the church scribes, rising mercantile activities, and
scholars from other fields.</p>
<p>Nicolas Chuquet’s Triparty</p>
<p>It was Germany and Italy that provided most of the early Renaissance
mathematicians, but in France in 1484 a manuscript was composed that in
level and significance was perhaps the most outstanding algebra since
the Liber abaci of Fibonacci almost three centuries earlier and that,
like the Liber abaci, was not printed until the nineteenth century. This
work, titled Triparty en la science des nombres, was by Nicolas Chuquet
(1445–1488), about whom we know virtually nothing except that he was
born in Paris, attained his bachelor’s degree in medicine, and practiced
in Lyons. The Triparty does not closely resemble any earlier work in
arithmetic or algebra, and the only writers the author mentions are
Boethius and Campanus. There is evidence of Italian influence, which
possibly resulted from acquaintance with Fibonacci’s Liber abaci.</p>
<p>The first of the “Three Parts” concerns the rational arithmetic
operations on numbers, including an explanation of the Hindu-Arabic
numerals. Of these, Chuquet said that “the tenth figure does not have or
signify a value, and hence it is called cipher or nothing or figure of
no value.” The work is essentially rhetorical, the four fundamental
operations being indicated by the words and the phrases plus, moins,
multiplier par, and partyr par, the first two sometimes abbreviated in
the medieval manner as and . In connection with the computation of
averages, Chuquet gave a regle des nombres moyens, according to which (a
+ c)/(b + d) lies between a/b and c/d if a, b, c, d are positive
numbers. In the second part, concerning roots of numbers, there is some
syncopation, so that the modern expression appears in the not very
dissimilar form R)2.14..R)2180.</p>
<p>The last and by far the most important part of the Triparty concerns
the “Regle des premiers,” that is, the rule of the unknown, or what we
should call algebra. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, there
were various names for the unknown thing, such as res (in Latin) or
chose (in French) or cosa (in Italian) or coss (in German); Chuquet’s
word “premier” is unusual in this connection. The second power he called
champs (whereas the Latin had been census), the third cubiez, and the
fourth champs de champ. For multiples of these, Chuquet invented an
exponential notation of great significance. The denomination or power of
the unknown quantity was indicated by an exponent associated with the
coefficient of the term, so that our modern expressions 5x and 6x2 and
l0x3 appeared in the Triparty as .5.1 and .6.2 and .10.3. Moreover, zero
and negative exponents take their place along with the positive integral
powers, so that our 9x0 became .9.0, and 9x−2 was written as .9.2.m,
meaning .9. seconds moins. Such a notation laid bare the laws of
exponents, with which Chuquet may have become familiar through the work
of Oresme on proportions. Chuquet wrote, for example, that .72.1 divided
by .8.3 is .9.2.m—that is, 72x ÷ 8x3 = 9x−2. Related to these laws is
his observation of the relationships between the powers of the number 2
and the indices of these powers set out in a table from 0 to 20, in
which sums of the indices correspond to products of the powers. Except
for the magnitude of the gaps between entries, this constituted a
miniature table of logarithms to the base 2. Observations similar to
those of Chuquet were to be repeated several times during the next
century, and these undoubtedly played a role in the ultimate invention
of logarithms.</p>
<p>The second half of the last part of the Triparty is devoted to the
solution of equations. Here are many of the problems that had appeared
among his predecessors’ works, but there is also at least one
significant novelty. In writing .4.1 egaulx a .2.0 (that is, 4x = −2),
Chuquet was for the first time expressing an isolated negative number in
an algebraic equation. Generally, he rejected zero as a root of an
equation, but on one occasion, he remarked that the number sought was 0.
In considering equations of the form axm + bxm + n = cx m + 2n (where
the coefficients and the exponents are specific positive integers), he
found that some implied imaginary solutions; in these cases, he simply
added, “Tel nombre est ineperible.”</p>
<p>The Triparty of Chuquet, like the Collectio of Pappus, is a book in
which the extent of the author’s originality cannot be determined. Each
undoubtedly was indebted to his immediate predecessors, but we are
unable to identify any of them. Moreover, in the case of Chuquet, we
cannot determine his influence on later writers. The Triparty was not
printed until 1880 and probably was known to few mathematicians, but one
of those into whose hands it fell used so much of the material that by
modern standards, he might be charged with plagiarism, even though he
mentioned Chuquet’s name. The Larismethique nouvellement composee,
published in Lyons by Etienne de la Roche in 1520 and again in 1538,
depended heavily, as we now know, on Chuquet; hence, it is safe to say
that the Triparty was not without effect.</p>

<p>Luca Pacioli’s Summa</p>
<p>The earliest Renaissance algebra, that of Chuquet, was the product of
a Frenchman, but the best-known algebra of that period was published ten
years later in Italy. In fact, the Summa de Arithmetica, Geometrica,
Proportioni et Proportionalita of the friar Luca Pacioli (1445–1514)
overshadowed the Triparty so thoroughly that older historical accounts
of algebra leap directly from the Liber abaci of 1202 to the Summa of
1494 without mentioning the work of Chuquet or other intermediaries. The
way for the Summa, however, had been prepared by a generation of
algebraists, for the algebra of al-Khwarizmi was translated into Italian
at least by 1464, the date of a manuscript copy in the Plimpton
Collection in New York; the writer of this manuscript stated that he
based his work on numerous predecessors in this field, naming some from
the earlier fourteenth century. The Renaissance in science is often
assumed to have been sparked by the recovery of ancient Greek works, but
the Renaissance in mathematics was especially characterized by the rise
of algebra, and in this respect, it was but a continuation of the
medieval tradition.</p>
<p>The Summa, the writing of which had been completed by 1487, was more
influential than it was original. It is an impressive compilation (with
sources of information not generally indicated) of material in four
fields: arithmetic, algebra, very elementary Euclidean geometry, and
double-entry bookkeeping. Pacioli (also known as Luca di Borgo) for a
time had been a tutor to the sons of a wealthy merchant in Venice, and
he was undoubtedly familiar with the rising importance of commercial
arithmetic in Italy. The earliest printed arithmetic, appearing
anonymously at Treviso in 1478, had featured the fundamental operations,
the rules of two and three, and business applications. Several more
technical commercial arithmetics appeared shortly thereafter, and
Pacioli borrowed freely from them. One of these, the Compendia de lo
abaco of Francesco Pellos (fl. 1450–1500), which was published at Torino
in the year Columbus discovered America, made use of a dot to denote the
division of an integer by a power of 10, thus adumbrating our decimal
point.</p>
<p>The Summa, which like the Triparty was written in the vernacular, was
a summing up of unpublished works that the author had composed earlier,
as well as of general knowledge at the time. The portion on arithmetic
is much concerned with devices for multiplication and for finding square
roots; the section on algebra includes the standard solution of linear
and quadratic equations. Although it lacks the exponential notation of
Chuquet, there is increased use of syncopation through abbreviations.
The letters p and m were by this time widely used in Italy for addition
and subtraction, and Pacioli used co, ce, and ae for cosa (the unknown),
censo (the square of the unknown), and aequalis, respectively. For the
fourth power of the unknown, he naturally used cece (for square-square).
Echoing a sentiment of Omar Khayyam, he believed that cubic equations
could not be solved algebraically.</p>
<p>Pacioli’s work in geometry in the Summa was not significant, although
some of his geometric problems remind one of the geometry of
Regiomontanus, specific numerical cases being employed. Although
Pacioli’s geometry did not attract much attention, so popular did the
commercial aspect of the book become that the author is generally
regarded as the father of double-entry bookkeeping.</p>
<p>Pacioli, the first mathematician of whom we have an authentic
portrait, in 1509 tried his hand twice more at geometry, publishing an
undistinguished edition of Euclid and a work with the impressive title
De Divina Proportione. The latter concerns regular polygons and solids
and the ratio later known as “the golden section.” It is noteworthy for
the excellence of the figures, which have been attributed to Leonardo da
Vinci (1452–1519). Leonardo is frequently thought of as a mathematician.
In his notebooks, we find quadratures of lunes, constructions of regular
polygons, and thoughts on centers of gravity and on curves of double
curvature, but he is best known for his application of mathematics to
science and the theory of perspective. Hundreds of years later,
Renaissance notions on mathematical perspective were to blossom into a
new branch of geometry, but these developments were not perceptibly
influenced by the thoughts that the left-handed Leonardo entrusted to
his notebooks in the form of mirror-written entries. Da Vinci is
pictured as the typical all-round Renaissance man, and in fields other
than mathematics, there is much to support such a view. Leonardo was a
genius of bold and original thought, a man of action as well as
contemplation, at once an artist and an engineer. Yet he appears not to
have been in close touch with the chief mathematical trend of the
time—the development of algebra.</p>
<p>German Algebras and Arithmetics</p>
<p>The word “Renaissance” inevitably brings to mind Italian literary,
artistic, and scientific treasures, for renewed interest in art and
learning became apparent in Italy earlier than in other parts of Europe.
There, in a rough-and-tumble conflict of ideas, men learned to put
greater trust in independent observations of nature and judgments of the
mind. Moreover, Italy had been one of the two chief avenues along which
Arabic learning, including algorism and algebra, had entered Europe.
Nevertheless, other parts of Europe did not remain far behind, as the
work of Regiomontanus and Chuquet shows. In Germany, for example, books
on algebra became so numerous that for a time, the Germanic word “coss”
for the unknown triumphed in other parts of Europe, and the subject
became known as the “cossic art.” Moreover, the Germanic symbols for
addition and subtraction ultimately displaced the Italian p and m. In
1489, before the publication of Pacioli’s Summa, a German lecturer
(“Master in the Liberal Arts”) at Leipzig, Johann Widman (1462–1498),
had published a commercial arithmetic, Behende und hübsche Rechnung auff
allen Kauffmanschafften, the oldest book in which our familiar + and −
signs appear in print. At first used to indicate excess and deficiency
in warehouse measures, they later became symbols of the familiar
arithmetic operations. Widman, incidentally, possessed a manuscript copy
of the Algebra of al-Khwarizmi, a work well known to other German
mathematicians.</p>
<p>Among the numerous Germanic algebras was Die Coss, written in 1524 by
Germany’s celebrated Rechenmeister Adam Riese (1492–1559). The author
was the most influential German writer in the move to replace the old
computation (in terms of counters and Roman numerals) with the newer
method (using the pen and Hindu-Arabic numerals). So effective were his
numerous arithmetic books that the phrase “nach Adam Riese” still
survives in Germany as a tribute to accuracy in arithmetic processes.
Riese, in his Coss, mentions the Algebra of al-Khwarizmi and refers to a
number of Germanic predecessors in the field.</p>
<p>The first half of the sixteenth century saw a flurry of German
algebras, among the most important of which were the Coss (1525) of
Christoph Rudolff (ca. 1500−ca. 1545), a tutor of mathematics in Vienna;
the Rechnung (1527) of Peter Apian (1495–1552); and the Arithmetica
Integra (1544) of Michael Stifel (ca. 1487–1567). The first is
especially significant as one of the earliest printed works to make use
of decimal fractions, as well as of the modern symbol for roots; the
second is worth recalling for the fact that here, in a commercial
arithmetic, the so-called Pascal triangle was printed on the title page,
almost a century before Pascal was born. The third work, Stifel’s
Arithmetica Integra, was the most important of all of the
sixteenth-century German algebras. It, too, includes the Pascal
triangle, but it is more significant for its treatment of negative
numbers, radicals, and powers. Through the use of negative coefficients
in equations, Stifel was able to reduce the multiplicity of cases of
quadratic equations to what appeared to be a single form, but he had to
explain, under a special rule, when to use + and when −. Moreover, even
he failed to admit negative numbers as roots of an equation. Stifel, a
onetime monk turned itinerant Lutheran preacher and for a time professor
of mathematics at Jena, was one of the many writers who popularized the
“German” symbols + and − at the expense of the “Italian” p and m
notation. He was thoroughly familiar with the properties of negative
numbers, despite the fact that he called them “numeri absurdi.” About
irrational numbers he was somewhat hesitant, saying that they are
“hidden under some sort of cloud of infinitude.” Again calling attention
to the relations between arithmetic and geometric progressions, as had
Chuquet for powers of 2 from 0 to 20, Stifel extended the table to
include and and (without, however, using exponential notation). For
powers of the unknown quantity in algebra, Stifel in Arithmetica Integra
used abbreviations for the German words “coss,” “zensus,” “cubus,” and
“zenzizensus,” but in a later treatise, De Algorithmi Numerorum
Cossicorum, he proposed using a single letter for the unknown and
repeating the letter for higher powers of the unknown, a scheme later
employed by Thomas Harriot (1560–1621).</p>

Riese, the Rechenmeister. It depicts a contest between an algorist and
an abacist.</p>
<p>Cardan’s Ars Magna</p>
<p>The Arithmetica Integra was as thorough a treatment of algebra as was
generally known up to 1544, yet by the following year, it was in a sense
quite outmoded. Stifel gave many examples that led to quadratic
equations, but none of his problems led to mixed cubic equations, for
the simple reason that he knew no more about the algebraic solution of
the cubic than did Pacioli or Omar Khayyam. In 1545, however, the
solution not only of the cubic, but also of the quartic, became common
knowledge through the publication of the Ars Magna of Geronimo Cardano
(1501–1576). Such a striking and unanticipated development made so
strong an impact on algebraists that the year 1545 is frequently taken
to mark the beginning of the modern period in mathematics. It must
immediately be pointed out, however, that Cardano (or Cardan) was not
the original discoverer of the solution of either the cubic or the
quartic. He himself candidly admitted this in his book. The hint for
solving the cubic, he averred, he had obtained from Niccolo Tartaglia
(ca. 1500–1557); the solution of the quartic was first discovered by
Cardan’s quondam amanuensis, Ludovico Ferrari (1522–1565). What Cardan
failed to mention in Ars Magna is the solemn oath he had sworn to
Tartaglia that he would not disclose the secret, for the latter intended
to make his reputation by publishing the solution of the cubic as the
crowning part of his treatise on algebra.</p>
<p>Lest one feel undue sympathy for Tartaglia, it may be noted that he
had published an Archimedean translation (1543), derived from Moerbeke,
leaving the impression that it was his own, and in his Quesiti et
Inventioni Diverse (Venice, 1546), he gave the law of the inclined
plane, presumably derived from Jordanus Nemorarius, without proper
credit. It is, in fact, possible that Tartaglia himself had received a
hint concerning the solution of the cubic from an earlier source.
Whatever may be the truth in a rather complicated and sordid controversy
between proponents of Cardan and Tartaglia, it is clear that neither of
the principals was the first to make the discovery. The hero in the case
evidently was one whose name is scarcely remembered today—Scipione del
Ferro (ca. 1465–1526), a professor of mathematics at Bologna, one of the
oldest of the medieval universities and a school with a strong
mathematical tradition. How or when del Ferro made his wonderful
discovery is not known. He did not publish the solution, but before his
death he disclosed it to a student, Antonio Maria Fior (or Floridus in
Latin).</p>
<p>Word of the existence of an algebraic solution of the cubic seems to
have gotten around, and Tartaglia told us that knowledge of the
possibility of solving the equation inspired him to devote his time to
discovering the method for himself. Whether independently or on the
basis of a hint, Tartaglia did indeed learn, by 1541, how to solve cubic
equations. When news of this spread, a mathematical contest between Fior
and Tartaglia was arranged. Each contestant proposed thirty questions
for the other to solve within a stated time interval. When the day for
the decision had arrived, Tartaglia had solved all questions posed by
Fior, whereas the unfortunate Fior had not solved a single one set by
his opponent. The explanation is relatively simple. Today we think of
cubic equations as all essentially of one type and as amenable to a
single unified method of solution. At that time, however, when negative
coefficients were virtually unused, there were as many types of cubics
as there are possibilities in positive or negative signs for
coefficients. Fior was able to solve only equations of the type in which
cubes and roots equal a number, that is, those of the type x3 + px = q,
although at that time only specific numerical (positive) coefficients
were used. Tartaglia, meanwhile, had also learned how to solve equations
of the form where cubes and squares equal a number. It is likely that
Tartaglia had learned how to reduce this case to Fior’s by removing the
squared term, for it became known by this time that if the leading
coefficient is unity, then the coefficient of the squared term, when it
appears on the other side of the equality sign, is the sum of the
roots.</p>
<p>News of Tartaglia’s triumph reached Cardan, who promptly invited the
winner to his home, with a hint that he would arrange to have him meet a
prospective patron. Tartaglia had been without a substantial source of
support, partly perhaps because of a speech impediment. As a child, he
had received a saber cut in the fall of Brescia to the French in 1512,
which impaired his speech. This earned him the nickname “Tartaglia,” or
“stammerer,” a name that he thereafter used instead of the name “Niccolo
Fontana” that had been given him at birth. Cardan, in contrast to
Tartaglia, had achieved worldly success as a physician. So great was his
fame that he was once called to Scotland to diagnose an ailment of the
Archbishop of St. Andrews (evidently, a case of asthma). By birth
illegitimate and by habit an astrologer, a gambler, and a heretic,
Cardan was nevertheless a respected professor at Bologna and Milan, and,
ultimately, he was granted a pension by the pope. One of his sons
poisoned his own wife, the other son was a scoundrel, and Cardan’s
secretary Ferrari probably died of poison at the hands of his own
sister. Despite such distractions, Cardan was a prolific writer on
topics ranging from his own life and praise of gout to science and
mathematics.</p>
<p>Jerome Cardan</p>
<p>In his chief scientific work, a ponderous volume with the title De
Subtilitate, Cardan is clearly a child of his age, interminably
discussing the Aristotelian physics handed down through Scholastic
philosophy, while at the same time waxing enthusiastic about the new
discoveries of the then recent times. Much the same can be said of his
mathematics, for this, too, was typical of the day. He knew little of
Archimedes and less of Apollonius, but he was thoroughly familiar with
algebra and trigonometry. He had already published a Practica
Arithmetice in 1539, which included, among other things, the
rationalization of denominators containing cube roots. By the time he
published the Ars Magna, half a dozen years later, he was probably the
ablest algebraist in Europe. Nevertheless, the Ars Magna makes dull
reading today. Case after case of the cubic equation is laboriously
worked out in detail, according as terms of the various degrees appear
on the same or on opposite sides of the equality, for coefficients were
necessarily positive. Despite the fact that he was dealing with
equations on numbers, he followed al-Khwarizmi in thinking
geometrically, so that we might refer to his method as “completing the
cube.” There are, of course, certain advantages in such an approach. For
instance, because x3 is a volume, 6x, in Cardan’s following equation,
must also be thought of as a volume. Hence, the number 6 must have the
dimensionality of an area, suggesting the type of substitution that
Cardan used, as we shall shortly see.</p>
<p>Cardan used little syncopation, being a true disciple of
al-Khwarizmi, and, like the Arabs, he thought of his equations with
specific numerical coefficients as representative of general categories.
For example, when he wrote, “Let the cube and six times the side be
equal to 20” (or x3 + 6x = 20), he obviously thought of this equation as
typical of all of those having “a cube and thing equal to a number”—that
is, of the form x3 + px = q. The solution of this equation covers a
couple of pages of rhetoric that we should now put in symbols as
follows: Substitute u − v for x and let u and v be related so that their
product (thought of as an area) is one-third the x coefficient in the
cubic equation—that is, uv = 2. On substitution in the equation, the
result is u3 − v3 = 20, and, on eliminating v, we have u6 = 20u3 + 8, a
quadratic in u3. Hence, u3 is known to be . From the relationship u3 −
v3 = 20, we see that : hence, from x = u − v, we have . Having carried
through the method for this specific case, Cardan closed with a verbal
formulation of the rule equivalent to our modern solution of x3 + px = q
as</p>
<p>Cardan then went on to other cases, such as “cube equal to thing and
number.” Here, one makes the substitution x = u + v, instead of x = u −
v, the rest of the method remaining essentially the same. In this case,
however, there is a difficulty. When the rule is applied to x3 = 15x +
4, for example, the result is . Cardan knew that there was no square
root of a negative number, yet he knew x = 4 to be a root. He was unable
to understand how his rule could make sense in this situation. He had
toyed with square roots of negative numbers in another connection when
he asked that one divide 10 into two parts such that the product of the
parts is 40. The usual rules of algebra lead to the answers and (or, in
Cardan’s notation, 5p:℞m:15 and 5m:℞m:15. Cardan referred to these
square roots of negative numbers as “sophistic” and concluded that his
result in this case was “as subtile as it is useless.” Later writers
were to show that such manipulations were indeed subtle but far from
useless. It is to Cardan’s credit that at least he paid some attention
to this puzzling situation.</p>
<p>Ferrari’s Solution of the Quartic Equation</p>
<p>Of the rule for solving quartic equations, Cardan in the Ars Magna
wrote that it “is due to Luigi Ferrari, who invented it at my request.”
Again separate cases, twenty in all, are considered in turn, but for the
modern reader, one case will suffice. Let square-square and square and
number be equal to side. (Cardan knew how to eliminate the cubic term by
increasing or diminishing the roots by one-fourth of the coefficient in
the cubic term.) Then, the steps in the solution of x4 + 6x2 + 36 = 60x
are expressed by Cardan essentially as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>First, add enough squares and numbers to both sides to make the
left-hand side a perfect square.</p></li>
<li><p>Now add to both sides of the equation terms involving a new
unknown y such that the left-hand side remains a perfect
square.</p></li>
<li><p>The next, and crucial, step is to choose y so that the trinomial
on the right-hand side will be a perfect square. This is done, of
course, by setting the discriminant equal to zero, an ancient and
well-known rule.</p></li>
<li><p>The result of step 3 is a cubic equation in y: y3 + 15y2 + 36y =
450, today known as the “resolvent cubic” for the given quartic
equation. This is now solved for y by the rules previously given for the
solution of cubic equations.</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute a value of y from step 4 into the equation for x in
step 2 and take the square root of both sides.</p></li>
<li><p>The result of step 5 is a quadratic equation, which must now be
solved to find the value of x desired.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The solution of cubic and quartic equations was perhaps the greatest
contribution to algebra since the Babylonians, almost four millennia
earlier, had learned how to complete the square for quadratic equations.
No other discoveries had had quite the stimulus to algebraic development
as did those disclosed in the Ars Magna. The solutions of the cubic and
the quartic were in no sense the result of practical considerations, nor
were they of any value to engineers or mathematical practitioners.
Approximate solutions of some cubic equations had been known in
antiquity, and al-Kashi a century before Cardan could have solved to any
desired degree of accuracy any cubic equation resulting from a practical
problem. The Tartaglia-Cardan formula is of great logical significance,
but it is not nearly so useful for applications as are methods of
successive approximation.</p>
<p>Influence of the Ars Magna</p>
<p>The most important outcome of the discoveries published in the Ars
Magna was the tremendous stimulus they gave to algebraic research in
various directions. It was natural that study should be generalized and
that, in particular, a solution should be sought for the quintic. Here,
mathematicians were faced with an unsolvable algebraic problem
comparable to the classical geometric problems of antiquity. Much good
mathematics, but only a negative conclusion, was the outcome.</p>
<p>Another immediate result of the solution of the cubic was the first
significant glance at a new kind of number. Irrational numbers had been
accepted by the time of Cardan, even though they were not soundly based,
for they are readily approximated by rational numbers. Negative numbers
afforded more difficulty because they are not readily approximated by
positive numbers, but the notion of sense (or direction on a line) made
them plausible. Cardan used them even while calling them numeri ficti.
If an algebraist wished to deny the existence of irrational or negative
numbers, he would simply say, as had the ancient Greeks, that the
equations x2 = 2 and x + 2 = 0 are not solvable. In a similar way,
algebraists had been able to avoid imaginaries simply by saying that an
equation such as x2 + 1 = 0 is not solvable. There was no need for
square roots of negative numbers. With the solution of the cubic
equation, however, the situation became markedly different. Whenever the
three roots of a cubic equation are real and different from zero, the
Cardan-Tartaglia formula inevitably leads to square roots of negative
numbers. The goal was known to be a real number, but it could not be
reached without understanding something about imaginary numbers. The
imaginary now had to be reckoned with, even if one did agree to restrict
oneself to real roots.</p>
<p>Rafael Bombelli</p>
<p>At this stage, Rafael Bombelli (1526–1572), a largely self-taught
Florentine hydraulic engineer studying the algebraic publications of his
time, had what he called “a wild thought,” for the whole matter “seemed
to rest on sophistry.” The two radicands of the cube roots resulting
from the usual formula differ only in one sign. We have seen that the
solution by formula of x3 = 15x + 4 leads to , whereas it is known by
direct substitution that x = 4 is the only positive root of the
equation. (Cardan had noted that when all terms on one side of the
equality sign are of higher degree than the terms on the other side, the
equation has one and only one positive root—an anticipation, in a small
way, of part of Descartes’ rule of signs.) Bombelli had the happy
thought that the radicals themselves might be related in much the way
that the radicands are related; that, as we should now say, they are
conjugate imaginaries that lead to the real number 4. It is obvious that
if the sum of the real parts is 4, then the real part of each is 2, and
if a number of the form is to be a cube root of , then it is easy to see
that b must be 1. Hence, , or 4.</p>
<p>Through his ingenious reasoning, Bombelli had shown the important
role that conjugate imaginary numbers were to play in the future. But at
that time, the observation was of no help in the actual work of solving
cubic equations, for Bombelli had had to know beforehand what one of the
roots is. In this case, the equation is already solved, and no formula
is needed; without such foreknowledge, Bombelli’s approach fails. Any
attempt to find algebraically the cube roots of the imaginary numbers in
the Cardan-Tartaglia rule leads to the very cubic in the solution of
which the cube roots arose in the first place, so that one is back where
one started from. Because this impasse arises whenever all three roots
are real, this is known as the “irreducible case.” Here, an expression
for the unknown is indeed provided by the formula, but the form in which
this appears is useless for most purposes.</p>
<p>Bombelli composed his Algebra in about 1560, but it was not printed
until 1572, about a year before he died, and then only in part. One of
the significant things about this book is that it contains symbolisms
reminiscent of those of Chuquet. Bombelli sometimes wrote 1 Z p.5Rm.4
(that is, 1 zenus plus 5 res minus 4) for x2 + 5x − 4. But he also used
another form of expression, influenced perhaps by de la Roche’s
Larismethique, in which the power of the unknown quantity is represented
simply as an Arabic numeral above a short circular arc. Books IV and VI
of his Algebra are full of problems in geometry that are solved
algebraically, somewhat in the manner of Regiomontanus but making use of
new symbolisms. In problems such as that of finding the side of a square
inscribed in a certain triangle, a highly symbolic algebra comes to the
aid of geometry, but Bombelli worked in the other direction, too. In the
Algebra, the algebraic solution of cubic equations is accompanied by
geometric demonstrations in terms of the subdivision of the cube.
Unfortunately for the future of geometry—and of mathematics in
general—the last books of Bombelli’s Algebra were not included in the
publication of 1572 but remained in manuscript until 1929.</p>
<p>The Algebra uses the standard Italian symbols p and m for addition
and subtraction, but Bombelli still had no symbol for equality. Our
standard equality sign had been published before Bombelli wrote his
book; the symbol had appeared in England in 1557 in The Whetstone of
Witte of Robert Recorde (1510–1558).</p>
<p>Robert Recorde</p>
<p>Mathematics had not prospered in England during the period of almost
two centuries since the death of Bradwardine, and what little work was
done there in the early sixteenth century depended much on Italian
writers such as Pacioli. Recorde was, in fact, just about the only
mathematician of any stature in England during the entire century. He
was born in Wales and studied and taught mathematics at both Oxford and
Cambridge. In 1545, he received his medical degree at Cambridge, and
thereafter he became the physician of Edward VI and Queen Mary. Recorde
virtually established the English mathematical school. Like Chuquet and
Pacioli before him and Galileo after him, he wrote in the vernacular;
this may have limited his effect on the Continent. Recorde’s first
extant mathematical work is the Grounde of Artes (1541), a popular
arithmetic containing computation by abacus and algorism, with
commercial applications. The level and style of this book, dedicated to
Edward VI and appearing in more than two dozen editions, may be judged
from the following problem:</p>
<p>Then what say you to this equation? If I sold unto you an horse
having 4 shoes, and in every shoe 6 nayles, with this condition, that
you shall pay for the first nayle one ob: for the second nayle two ob:
for the third nayle foure ob: and so fourth, doubling untill the end of
all the nayles, now I ask you, how much would the price of the horse
come unto?</p>
<p>His Castle of Knowledge, an astronomy in which the Copernican system
is cited with approval, and his Pathewaie to Knowledge, an abridgement
of the Elements and the first geometry to appear in English, both
appeared in 1551. The work of Recorde that is most often cited is The
Whetstone of Witte, published only a year before he died in prison. The
title Whetstone evidently was a play on the word “coss,” for “cos” is
the Latin for “whetstone,” and the book is devoted to “the cossike
practise” (that is, algebra). It did for England what Stifel had done
for Germany—with one addition. The well-known equality sign first
appeared in it, explained by Recorde in the quotation at the beginning
of this chapter. Yet it was to be a century or more before the sign
triumphed over rival notations. Recorde died in the year in which Queen
Mary also died, and no comparable English mathematical author appeared
during the long reign of Elizabeth I. It was France, rather than
England, Germany, or Italy, that produced the outstanding mathematician
of the Elizabethan Age. But before we turn to his work, there are
certain aspects of the earlier sixteenth century that should be
clarified.</p>
<p>Trigonometry</p>
<p>The direction of greatest progress in mathematics during the
sixteenth century was obviously in algebra, but developments in
trigonometry were not far behind, although they were not nearly so
spectacular. The construction of trigonometric tables is a dull task,
but they are of great usefulness to astronomers and mathematicians;
here, early sixteenth-century Poland and Germany were very helpful
indeed. Most of us today think of Nicholas Copernicus (1473–1543) as an
astronomer who revolutionized the worldview by successfully putting the
earth in motion about the sun (where Aristarchus had tried and failed),
but an astronomer is almost inevitably a trigonometer as well, and we
owe to Copernicus a mathematical obligation, as well as an astronomical
debt.</p>
<p>Copernicus and Rheticus</p>
<p>During the lifetime of Regiomontanus, Poland had enjoyed a “Golden
Age” of learning, and the University of Cracow, where Copernicus
enrolled in 1491, had great prestige in mathematics and astronomy. After
further studies in law, medicine, and astronomy at Bologna, Padua, and
Ferrara and after some teaching at Rome, Copernicus returned to Poland
in 1510 to become Canon of Frauenburg. Despite multitudinous
administrative obligations, including currency reform and the curbing of
the Teutonic Order, Copernicus completed the celebrated treatise De
Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, which was published in 1543, the year
he died. This contains substantial sections on trigonometry that had
been separately published in the previous year under the title De
Lateribus et Angulis Triangulorum. The trigonometric material is similar
to that in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, published in Nuremberg only a
decade earlier, but Copernicus’s trigonometric ideas seem to date from
before 1533, at which time he probably did not know of the work of
Regiomontanus. It is quite likely, nevertheless, that the final form of
Copernicus’s trigonometry was in part derived from Regiomontanus, for in
1539 he received as a student Georg Joachim Rheticus (or Rhaeticus,
1514–1576), a professor at Wittenberg, who had visited in Nuremberg.
Rheticus worked with Copernicus for some three years, and it was he who,
with his teacher’s approval, published the first short account of
Copernican astronomy in a work titled Narratio Prima (1540) and who made
the first arrangements, completed by Andreas Osiander, for the printing
of the celebrated De Revolutionibus. It is likely, therefore, that the
trigonometry in the classic work of Copernicus is closely related,
through Rheticus, to that of Regiomontanus.</p>
<p>We see the thorough trigonometric capabilities of Copernicus not only
in the theorems included in De Revolutionibus, but also in a proposition
originally included by the author in an earlier manuscript version of
the book but not in the printed work. The deleted proposition is a
generalization of the theorem of Nasir Eddin (which does appear in the
book) on the rectilinear motion resulting from the compounding of two
circular motions. The theorem of Copernicus is as follows: if a smaller
circle rolls without slipping along the inside of a larger circle with a
diameter twice as great, then the locus of a point that is not on the
circumference of the smaller circle, but that is fixed with respect to
this smaller circle, is an ellipse. Cardan, incidentally, knew of the
Nasir Eddin theorem but not of the Copernican locus, a theorem
rediscovered in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Through the trigonometric theorems in De Revolutionibus, Copernicus
spread the influence of Regiomontanus, but his student Rheticus went
further. He combined the ideas of Regiomontanus and Copernicus, together
with views of his own, in the most elaborate trigonometric treatise
composed up to that time: the two-volume Opus Palatinum de Triangulis.
Here, trigonometry really came of age. The author discarded the
traditional consideration of the functions with respect to the arc of a
circle and focused instead on the lines in a right triangle. Moreover,
all six trigonometric functions now came into full use, for Rheticus
calculated elaborate tables of all of them. Decimal fractions still had
not come into common use; hence, for the sine and cosine functions he
used a hypotenuse (radius) of 10,000,000 and for the other four
functions a base (or adjacent side or radius) of 10,000,000 parts, for
intervals in the angle of 10″. He began tables of tangents and secants
with a base of 1015 parts, but he did not live to finish them, and the
treatise was completed and edited, with additions, by his pupil Valentin
Otho (ca. 1550–1605) in 1596.</p>
<p>Geometry</p>
<p>Pure geometry in the sixteenth century presented fewer conspicuous
advances than algebra or trigonometry did, but it was not entirely
without representatives. Contributions were made in Germany by Johannes
Werner (1468–1522) and Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) and in Italy by
Francesco Maurolico (1494–1575) and Pacioli. Once more, we note the
preeminence of these two countries in contributions to mathematics
during the Renaissance. Werner had aided in preserving the trigonometry
of Regiomontanus, but of more geometric significance was his Latin work,
in twenty-two books, on the Elements of Conics, printed in Nuremberg in
1522. Although this cannot be favorably compared with the Conics of
Apollonius, which was almost entirely unknown in Werner’s day, it marks
the renewal of interest in the curves for almost the first time since
Pappus. Because the author was primarily concerned with the duplication
of the cube, he concentrated on the parabola and the hyperbola, deriving
the standard plane equations stereometrically from the cone, as had his
predecessors in Greece, but there seems to be an element of originality
in his plane method for plotting points on a parabola with compasses and
straightedge. One first draws a pencil of circles tangent to each other
and intersecting the common normal in points c, d, e, f, g, . . . (Fig.
13.1). Then, along the common normal, one marks off a distance ab equal
to a desired parameter. At b one erects the line bG perpendicular to ab
and cutting the circles in points C, D, E, F, G, . . . respectively.
Then, at c one erects line segments cC′and cC″ perpendicular to ab and
equal to bC; at d one erects perpendicular segments dD′ and dD″ equal to
bD; at e one erects segments eE′ and eE″ equal to bE; and so on. Then,
C′, C″, D′, D″, E′, E″, . . . will all lie on the parabola with vertex
b, axis along ab, and having ab as the magnitude of the parameter—as is
readily seen from the relationships</p>
<p>FIG. 13.1</p>
<p>The Theory of Perspective</p>
<p>Werner’s work is closely related to ancient studies of conics, but
meanwhile, in Italy and Germany, a relatively novel relationship between
mathematics and art was developing. One important respect in which
Renaissance art differed from art in the Middle Ages was in the use of
perspective in the plane representation of objects in three-dimensional
space. The Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) is said
to have given much attention to this problem, but the first formal
account of some of the problems was given by Leon Battista Alberti
(1404–1472) in a treatise of 1435 (printed in 1511) titled Della
pittura. Alberti opens with a general discussion of the principles of
foreshortening and then describes a method he invented for representing
in a vertical “picture plane” a set of squares in a horizontal “ground
plane.” Let the eye be at a “station point” S that is h units above the
ground plane and k units in front of the picture plane. The intersection
of the ground plane and the picture plane is called the “groundline,”
the foot V of the perpendicular from S to the picture plane is called
the “center of vision” (or the principal vanishing point), the line
through V parallel to the groundline is known as the “vanishing line”
(or horizon line), and the points P and Q on this line, which are k
units from V, are called the “distance points.” If we take points A, B,
C, D, E, F, G marking off equal distances along the groundline RT (Fig.
13.2), where D is the intersection of this line with the vertical plane
through S and V, and if we draw lines connecting these points with V,
then the projection of these last lines, with S as a center, on the
ground plane will be a set of parallel and equidistant lines. If P (or
Q) is connected with the points B, C, D, E, F, G to form another set of
lines intersecting AV in points H, I, J, K, L, M, and if through the
latter points parallels are drawn to the groundline RT, then the set of
trapezoids in the picture plane will correspond to a set of squares in
the ground plane.</p>
<p>FIG. 13.2</p>
<p>A further step in the development of perspective was taken by the
Italian painter of frescoes Piero della Francesca (ca. 1415–1492), in De
prospectiva pingendi (ca. 1478). Where Alberti had concentrated on
representing on the picture plane figures in the ground plane, Piero
handled the more complicated problem of depicting on the picture plane
objects in three dimensions as seen from a given station point. He also
wrote De Corporibus Regularibus, where he noted the “divine proportion”
in which diagonals of a regular pentagon cut each other and where he
found the volume common to two equal circular cylinders whose axes cut
each other at right angles (unaware of Archimedes’ Method, which was
unknown at the time). The connection between art and mathematics was
also strong in the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He wrote a work, now lost,
on perspective; his Trattato della pittura opens with the admonition,
“Let no one who is not a mathematician read my works.” The same
combination of mathematical and artistic interests is seen in Albrecht
Dürer, a contemporary of Leonardo and a fellow townsman of Werner at
Nuremberg. In Dürer’s work, we also see the influence of Pacioli,
especially in the celebrated engraving of 1514 titled Melancholia. Here
the magic square figures prominently.</p>
<p>This is often regarded as the first use of a magic square in the
West, but Pacioli had left an unpublished manuscript, De viribus
quantitatis, in which interest in such squares is indicated.</p>
<p>Dürer’s interests in mathematics, however, were far more geometric
than arithmetic, as the title of his most important book indicates:
Investigation of the Measurement with Circles and Straight Lines of
Plane and Solid Figures. This work, which appeared in several German and
Latin editions from 1525 to 1538, contains some striking novelties, of
which the most important were his new curves. This is one direction in
which the Renaissance could easily have improved on the work of the
ancients, who had studied only a handful of types of curves. Dürer took
a fixed point on a circle and then allowed the circle to roll along the
circumference of another circle, generating an epicycloid, but, not
having the necessary algebraic tools, he did not study this
analytically. The same was true of other plane curves that he obtained
by projecting helical space curves onto a plane to form spirals. In
Dürer’s work, we find the Ptolemaic construction of the regular
pentagon, which is exact, as well as another original construction that
is only an approximation. For the heptagon and the enneagon, he also
gave ingenious but, of course, inexact constructions. Dürer’s
construction of an approximately regular nonagon is as follows: Let O be
the center of a circle ABC in which A, B, and C are vertices of the
inscribed equilateral triangle (Fig. 13.3). Through A, O, and C draw a
circular arc; draw similar arcs through B, O, and C and through B, O,
and A. Let AO be trisected at points D and E, and through E draw a
circle with center at O and cutting arcs AFO and AGO in points F and G,
respectively. Then, the straight line segment FG will be very nearly
equal to the side of the regular nonagon inscribed in this smaller
circle, the angle FOG differing from 40° by less than 1°. The relation
of art and geometry might have been very productive indeed, had it
gained the attention of professionally minded mathematicians, but in
this respect, it failed for more than a century after Dürer’s time.</p>

<p>Cartography</p>
<p>Projections of various sorts are essential to cartographers.
Geographical explorations had widened horizons and created a need for
better maps, but Scholasticism and Humanism were of little help here
because new discoveries had outmoded medieval and ancient maps. One of
the most important of the innovators was the German mathematician and
astronomer Peter Apian (or Bienewitz). In 1520, he published perhaps the
earliest map of the Old World and the New World in which the name
“America” was used; in 1527, he issued the business arithmetic in which,
on the title page, the arithmetic, or Pascal, triangle appeared in print
for the first time. The maps of Apian were well done, but they followed
Ptolemy closely wherever possible. For the novelty that is thought to be
so characteristic of the Renaissance, it is better to look instead to a
Flemish geographer, Gerard Mercator (or Gerhard Kremer, 1512–1594), who
was for a time associated with the court of Charles V in Brussels.
Mercator may be said to have broken with Ptolemy in geography as
Copernicus had revolted against Ptolemaic astronomy.</p>
<p>For the first half of his life, Mercator depended heavily on Ptolemy,
but by 1554, he had emancipated himself sufficiently to cut down the
Ptolemaic estimate of the width of the Mediterranean from 62° to 53°.
(Actually, it is close to 40°.) More important, in 1569 he published the
first map, Nova et aucta orbis terrae descriptio, drawn up on a new
principle. Maps in common use in Mercator’s day were usually based on a
rectangular grid made up of two sets of equidistant parallel lines, one
set for latitudes, the other for longitudes. The length of a degree of
longitude, however, varies with the parallel of latitude along which it
is measured, an inequality disregarded in common practice and resulting
in a distortion of shape and in errors of direction on the part of
navigators, who based a course on the straight line drawn between two
points on the map. The Ptolemaic stereographic projection preserved
shapes, but it did not use the common grid of lines. To bring theory and
practice into some accord, Mercator introduced the projection that bears
his name and that, with later improvement, has been basic in cartography
ever since. The first step in the Mercator projection is to think of a
spherical earth inscribed within an indefinitely long right circular
cylinder touching the earth along the equator (or some other great
circle), and to project, from the center of the earth, points on the
surface of the earth onto the cylinder. If the cylinder is then cut
along an element and flattened out, the meridians and the parallels on
the earth will have been transformed into a rectangular network of
lines. Distances between successive meridian lines will be equal, but
not distances between successive lines of latitude. In fact, the latter
distances increase so rapidly, as one moves away from the equator, that
distortions of shape and direction occur, but Mercator found that
through an empirically determined modification of these distances,
preservation of direction and shape (although not of size) was possible.
In 1599, Edward Wright (1558–1615)—a fellow at Cambridge, a tutor to
Henry, Prince of Wales, and a good sailor—developed the theoretical
basis of the Mercator projection by computing the functional
relationship D = a ln tan(ϕ/2 + 45°) between map distance D from the
equator and latitude ϕ.</p>

<p>Renaissance Trends</p>
<p>Several characteristics of the period under review stand out: the
diversity of occupations engaging the men we have considered, the
variety of languages in which mathematical works became available, and
the growth of mathematical applications. Whereas most medieval
contributors to mathematics received institutional support from the
Church, Renaissance mathematicians such as Regiomontanus gradually
shifted their support base to the growing commercial interests of the
time. An increasing number found employment from heads of states or
municipal institutions that needed calculators or teachers, mapmakers or
engineers. A considerable number were physicians or professors of
medicine. Most mathematical works at the beginning of the period were
available in Latin, or, as we have noted, if they had originally been
produced in Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew, were translated into Latin. By the
late sixteenth century, original works were available in English,
German, French, Italian, and Dutch.</p>
<p>Mathematics during the Renaissance had been widely applied to
bookkeeping, mechanics, surveying, art, cartography, and optics, and
numerous books were devoted to the practical arts. No one encouraged the
burgeoning emphasis on applications more strongly than Pierre de la
Ramée, or Ramus (1515–1572), a man who contributed to mathematics in a
pedagogical sense. At the Collège de Navarre, he had in 1536 defended,
for his master’s degree, the audacious thesis that everything Aristotle
had said was wrong—at a time when Peripateticism was the same as
orthodoxy. Ramus was at odds with his age in many ways; banned from
teaching philosophy in France, he proposed revisions in the university
curricula so that logic and mathematics should receive more attention.
Not satisfied even with the Elements of Euclid, Ramus edited this with
revisions. Yet his competence in geometry was limited. Ramus had more
confidence in practical elementary mathematics than in speculative
higher algebra and geometry. His logic enjoyed considerable popularity
in Protestant countries, in part because he died a martyr in the
St. Bartholomew massacre. This brings to our attention the fact that in
this first century of the Reformation, most works written in the vulgate
and intended for the mathematical practitioner were created in the
Protestant areas of Europe, whereas most of the traditional classical
treatises were studied and commented on in the Catholic parts.</p>
<p>Interest in the classical works of antiquity remained strong, as we
see in the case of Maurolico, a priest of Greek parentage who was born,
lived, and died in Sicily. Maurolico was a scholar who did much to
revive interest in the more advanced of the antique works. Geometry in
the first half of the sixteenth century had been heavily dependent on
the elementary properties found in Euclid. With the exception of Werner,
few were really familiar with the geometry of Archimedes, Apollonius, or
Pappus. The reason for this was simple: Latin translations of these did
not become generally available until the middle of the century. In this
process of translation, Maurolico was joined by an Italian scholar,
Federigo Commandino. We have mentioned Tartaglia’s borrowed translation
of Archimedes that was printed in 1543; this was followed by a Greek
edition of 1544 and a Latin translation by Commandino at Venice in
1558.</p>
<p>Four books of the Conics of Apollonius had survived in Greek, and
these had been translated into Latin and printed in Venice in 1537.
Maurolico’s translation, completed in 1548, was not published for more
than a century, appearing in 1654, but another translation by Commandino
was printed in Bologna in 1566. The Mathematical Collection of Pappus
had been virtually unknown to the Arabs and the medieval Europeans, but
this, too, was translated by the indefatigable Commandino, although it
was not printed until 1588. Maurolico was acquainted with the vast
treasures of ancient geometry that were becoming available, for he read
Greek, as well as Latin. In fact, from some indications in Pappus of
Apollonius’s work on maxima and minima—that is, on normals to the conic
sections—Maurolico tried his hand at a reconstruction of the then lost
Book V of the Conics. In this respect, he represented a vogue that was
to be one of the chief stimuli to geometry before Descartes: the
reconstruction of lost works in general and of the last four books of
the Conics in particular. During the interval from Maurolico’s death in
1575 to the publication of La géométrie by Descartes in 1637, geometry
was marking time until developments in algebra had reached a level that
made algebraic geometry possible. The Renaissance could well have
developed pure geometry in the direction suggested by art and
perspective, but the possibility went unheeded until almost precisely
the same time that algebraic geometry was created.</p>
<p>By 1575, Western Europe had recovered most of the major mathematical
works of antiquity that are now extant. Arabic algebra had been mastered
and improved on, both through the solution of the cubic and the quartic
and through a partial use of symbolism, and trigonometry had become an
independent discipline. A central figure in the transition to the
seventeenth century was the Frenchman François Viète.</p>
<p>François Viète</p>
<p>Viète (1540–1603) was not a mathematician by vocation. As a young
man, he studied and practiced law, becoming a member of the Bretagne
parliament; later he became a member of the king’s council, serving
first under Henry III and later under Henry IV. It was during his
service with the latter, Henry of Navarre, that Viète became so
successful in deciphering cryptic enemy messages that the Spanish
accused him of being in league with the devil. Only Viète’s leisure time
was devoted to mathematics, yet he made contributions to arithmetic,
algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. There was a period of almost half a
dozen years, before the accession of Henry IV, during which Viète was
out of favor, and these years he spent largely on mathematical studies.
In arithmetic, he should be remembered for his plea for the use of
decimal, rather than sexagesimal, fractions. In one of his earliest
works, the Canon Mathematicus of 1579, he wrote:</p>
<p>Sexagesimals and sixties are to be used sparingly or never in
mathematics, and thousandths and thousands, hundredths and hundreds,
tenths and tens, and similar progressions, ascending and descending, are
to be used frequently or exclusively.</p>
<p>In the tables and the computations, he adhered to his word and used
decimal fractions. The sides of the squares inscribed in and
circumscribed about a circle of diameter 200,000 he wrote as and , and
their mean as . A few pages further on, he wrote the semi-circumference
as and still later this figure appeared as 314,159,265,36, with the
integral portion in boldface type. Occasionally, he used a vertical
stroke to separate the integral and fractional portions, as when writing
the apothem of the 96-sided regular polygon, in a circle of diameter
200,000, as about 99,946|458,75.</p>
<p>The Analytic Art</p>
<p>Without doubt, it was in algebra that Viète made his most estimable
contributions, for it was here that he came closest to modern views.
Mathematics is a form of reasoning and not a bag of tricks. There could
be little advance in algebraic theory so long as the chief preoccupation
was with finding “the thing” in an equation with specific numerical
coefficients. Symbols and abbreviations for an unknown and for powers of
the unknown, as well as for operations and for the relationship of
equality, had been developed. Stifel had gone so far as to write AAAA
for the fourth power of an unknown quantity, yet he had no scheme for
writing an equation that might represent any one of a whole class of
equations—of all quadratics, say, or of all cubics. A geometer, by means
of a diagram, could let ABC represent all triangles, but an algebraist
had no counterpart for writing down all equations of the second degree.
Letters had indeed been used to represent magnitudes, known or unknown,
since the days of Euclid, and Jordanus had done this freely, but there
had been no way of distinguishing magnitudes assumed to be known from
those unknown quantities that are to be found. Here, Viète introduced a
convention as simple as it was fruitful. He used a vowel to represent
the quantity in algebra that was assumed to be unknown or undetermined
and a consonant to represent a magnitude or a number assumed to be known
or given. Here we find for the first time in algebra a clear-cut
distinction between the important concept of a parameter and the idea of
an unknown quantity. Had Viète adopted other symbolisms extant in his
day, he might have written all quadratic equations in the single form
BA2 + CA + D = 0, where A is the unknown and B, C, and D are parameters,
but unfortunately, he was modern only in some ways and ancient and
medieval in others. Although he wisely adopted the Germanic symbols for
addition and subtraction and, still more wisely, used differing symbols
for parameters and unknowns, the remainder of his algebra consisted of
words and abbreviations. The third power of the unknown quantity was not
A3 or even AAA, but A cubus, and the second power was A quadratus.
Multiplication was signified by the Latin word “in,” division was
indicated by the fraction line, and for equality Viète used an
abbreviation for the Latin aequalis. It is not given for one man to make
the whole of a given change; it must come in steps.</p>
<p>One of the steps beyond the work of Viète was taken by Harriot when
he revived the idea Stifel had had of writing the cube of the unknown as
AAA. This notation was used systematically by Harriot in his posthumous
book titled Artis Analyticae Praxis and printed in 1631. Its title had
been suggested by the earlier work of Viète, who had disliked the Arabic
name “algebra.” In looking for a substitute, Viète noted that in
problems involving the “cosa,” or unknown quantity, one generally
proceeds in a manner that Pappus and the ancients had described as
analysis. That is, instead of reasoning from what is known to what was
to be demonstrated, algebraists invariably reasoned from the assumption
that the unknown was given and deduced a necessary conclusion from which
the unknown can be determined. In modern symbols, if we wish to solve x2
− 3x + 2 = 0, for example, we proceed on the premise that there is a
value of x satisfying this equation; from this assumption, we draw the
necessary conclusion that (x − 2)(x − 1) = 0, so that either x − 2 = 0
or x − 1 = 0 (or both) is satisfied, hence that x necessarily is 2 or 1.
Yet, this does not mean that one or both of these numbers will satisfy
the equation unless we can reverse the steps in the reasoning process.
That is, the analysis must be followed by the synthetic
demonstration.</p>
<p>In view of the type of reasoning so frequently used in algebra, Viète
called the subject “the analytic art.” Moreover, he had a clear
awareness of the broad scope of the subject, realizing that the unknown
quantity need not be either a number or a geometric line. Algebra
reasons about “types” or species, hence Viète contrasted logistica
speciosa with logistica numerosa. His algebra was presented in the
Isagoge (or Introduction), printed in 1591, but his several other
algebraic works did not appear until many years after his death. In all
of these, he maintained a principle of homogeneity in equations, so that
in an equation such as x3 + 3ax = b, the a is designated as planum and
the b as solidum. This suggests a certain inflexibility, which Descartes
removed a generation later, but homogeneity also has certain advantages,
as Viète undoubtedly saw.</p>
<p>The algebra of Viète is noteworthy for the generality of its
expression, but there are also other novel aspects. For one thing, Viète
suggested a new approach to the solution of the cubic. Having reduced it
to the standard form equivalent to x3 + 3ax = b, he introduced a new
unknown quantity, y, that was related to x through the equation in y3,
for which the solution is readily obtained. Moreover, Viète was aware of
some of the relations between roots and coefficients of an equation,
although here he was hampered by his failure to allow the coefficients
and roots to be negative. He realized, for example, that if x3 + b = 3ax
has two positive roots, x1 and x2, then, 3a = x12 + x1x2 + x22 and b =
x1x22 + x2x12. This is, of course, a special case of our theorem that
the coefficient of the term in x, in a cubic with leading coefficient
unity, is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, and
the constant term is the negative of the product of the roots. Viète, in
other words, was close to the subject of symmetric functions of the
roots in the theory of equations. It remained for Albert Girard
(1595–1632) in 1629, in Invention nouvelle en l’algèbre, to state
clearly the relations between roots and coefficients, for he allowed for
negative and imaginary roots, whereas Viète had recognized only the
positive roots. In a general way, Girard realized that negative roots
are directed in a sense opposite to that for positive numbers, thus
anticipating the idea of the number line. “The negative in geometry
indicates a retrogression,” he said, “where the positive is an advance.”
To him also seems to be largely due the realization that an equation can
have as many roots as is indicated by the degree of the equation. Girard
retained imaginary roots of equations because they show the general
principles in the formation of an equation from its roots.</p>
<p>Discoveries much like those of Girard had been made even earlier by
Thomas Harriot, but these did not appear in print until ten years after
Harriot had died of cancer in 1621. Harriot had been hampered in
publication by conflicting political currents during the closing years
of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. He had been sent by Sir Walter
Raleigh as a surveyor on the latter’s expeditions to the New World in
1585, thus becoming the first substantial mathematician to set foot in
North America. (Brother Juan Diaz, a young chaplain with some
mathematical training, had earlier joined Cortes on an expedition to
Yucatan in 1518.) On his return, Harriot published A Briefe and True
Report of the New-found Land of Virginia (1586). When his patron lost
favor with the queen and was executed, Harriot was granted a pension of
£300 a year by Henry, Earl of Northumberland, but in 1606, the earl was
committed to the Tower by James I, Elizabeth’s successor. Harriot
continued to meet with Henry in the Tower, and distractions and poor
health contributed to his failure to publish results.</p>
<p>Harriot knew of relationships between roots and coefficients and
between roots and factors, but like Viète, he was hampered by failure to
take note of negative and imaginary roots. In notations, however, he
advanced the use of symbolism, being responsible for the signs &gt; and
&lt; for “greater than” and “less than.” It was also partly his use of
Recorde’s equality sign that led to its ultimate adoption. Harriot
showed much more moderation in the use of new notations than did his
younger contemporary William Oughtred. The latter published his Clavis
mathematicae in the same year, 1631, in which Harriot’s Praxis was
printed. In the Clavis, the notation for powers was a step back toward
Viète, for where Harriot had written AAAAAAA, for example, Oughtred used
Aqqc (that is, A squared squared cubed). Of all of Oughtred’s new
notations, only one is now widely used—the cross × for
multiplication.</p>
<p>The homogeneous form of his equations shows that Viète’s thought was
always close to geometry, but his geometry was not on the elementary
level of so many of his predecessors’; it was on the higher level of
Apollonius’s and Pappus’s. Interpreting the fundamental algebraic
operations geometrically, Viète realized that straightedge and compasses
suffice up through square roots. If, however, one permits the
interpolation of two geometric means between two magnitudes, one can
construct cube roots, or, a fortiori, geometrically solve any cubic
equation. In this case, one can, Viète showed, construct the regular
heptagon, for this construction leads to a cubic of the form x3 = ax +
a. In fact, every cubic or quartic equation is solvable by angle
trisections and the insertion of two geometric means between two
magnitudes. Here we clearly see a very significant trend—the association
of the new higher algebra with the ancient higher geometry. Analytic
geometry could not, then, be far away, and Viète might have discovered
this branch had he not avoided the geometric study of indeterminate
equations. The mathematical interests of Viète were unusually broad;
hence, he had read Diophantus’s Arithmetica. Yet when a geometric
problem led Viète to a final equation in two unknown quantities, he
dismissed it with the casual observation that the problem was
indeterminate. One wishes that with his general point of view, he had
inquired into the geometric properties of the indeterminacy.</p>
<p>The Approximate Solution of Equations</p>
<p>In many respects, the work of Viète is greatly undervalued, but in
one case, it is possible that he has been given undue credit for a
method known much earlier in China. In one of his later works, the De
Numerosa Potestatum . . . Resolutione (1600), he gave a method for the
approximate solution of equations, which is virtually that known today
as Horner’s method.</p>
<p>Trigonometry</p>
<p>The trigonometry of Viète, like his algebra, was characterized by a
heightened emphasis on generality and a breadth of view. As Viète was
the effective founder of a literal algebra, so he may with some
justification be called the father of a generalized analytic approach to
trigonometry that is sometimes known as goniometry. Here, too, of
course, Viète started from the work of his predecessors—notably,
Regiomontanus and Rheticus. Like the former, he thought of trigonometry
as an independent branch of mathematics; like the latter, he generally
worked without direct reference to half chords in a circle. Viète, in
the Canon Mathematicus (1579), prepared extensive tables of all six
functions for angles to the nearest minute. We have seen that he had
urged the use of decimal, rather than sexagesimal, fractions, but to
avoid all fractions as much as possible, Viète chose a “sinus totus” or
hypotenuse of 100,000 parts for the sine and cosine table and a “basis”
or “perpendiculum” of 100,000 parts for the tangent, cotangent, secant,
and cosecant tables. (Except for the sine function, he did not, however,
use these names.)</p>
<p>In solving oblique triangles, Viète in the Canon Mathematicus broke
them down into right triangles, but in another work a few years later,
Variorum de Rebus Mathematicis (1593), there is a statement equivalent
to our law of tangents:</p>
<p>Though Viète may have been the first to use this formula, it was
first published by the German physician and professor of mathematics
Thomas Finck (1561–1656) in 1583, in Geometriae Rotundi Libri XIV.</p>
<p>Trigonometric identities of various sorts were appearing about this
time in all parts of Europe, resulting in reduced emphasis on
computation in the solution of triangles and more on analytic functional
relationships. Among these were a group of formulas known as the
prosthaphaeretic rules—that is, formulas that would convert a product of
functions into a sum or difference (hence the name “prosthaphaeresis,” a
Greek word meaning “addition and subtraction”). From the following type
of diagram, for example, Viète derived the formula</p>
<p>Let sin x = AB (Fig. 13.4) and sin y = CD. Then</p>
<p>FIG. 13.4</p>
<p>On making the substitutions (x + y)/2 = A and (x − y)/2 = B, we have
the more useful form sin (A + B) + sin (A − B) = 2 sin A cos B. In a
similar manner, one derives sin (A + B) − sin (A − B) = 2 cos A sin B by
placing the angles x and y on the same side of the radius OD. The
formulas 2 cos A cos B = cos (A + B) + cos (A − B) and 2 sin A sin B =
cos (A − B) −cos (A + B) are somewhat similarly derived.</p>
<p>The previous rules sometimes bear the name “formulas of Werner,” for
they seem to have been used by Werner to simplify astronomical
calculations. At least one of these, that converting a product of
cosines to a sum of cosines, had been known to the Arabs in the time of
ibn-Yunus, but it was only in the sixteenth century, and more
particularly near the end of the century, that the method of
prosthaphaeresis came to be widely used. If, for example, one wished to
multiply 98,436 by 79,253, one could let cos A = 49,218 (that is,
98,436/2) and cos B = 79,253. (In modern notation, we would place a
decimal point, temporarily, before each of the numbers and adjust the
decimal point in the answer.) Then, from the table of trigonometric
functions one reads off angles A and B, and from the table one looks up
cos (A + B) and cos (A − B), the sum of these being the product desired.
Note that the product is found without any multiplication having been
performed. In our example of prosthaphaeretic multiplication, there is
not a great saving of time and energy, but when we recall that at that
time, trigonometric tables of a dozen or fifteen significant figures
were not uncommon, the laborsaving possibilities of prosthaphaeresis
become more pronounced. The device was adopted at major astronomical
observatories, including that of Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) in Denmark,
from where word of it was carried to Napier in Scotland. Quotients are
handled in the same manner by using a table of secants and
cosecants.</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere is Viète’s generalization of trigonometry into
goniometry more pronounced than in connection with his multiple-angle
formulas. The double-angle formulas for the sine and the cosine had, of
course, been known to Ptolemy, and the triple-angle formulas are then
easily derived from Ptolemy’s formulas for the sine and the cosine of
the sum of two angles. By continuing to use the Ptolemy formulas
recursively, a formula for sin nx or cos nx can be derived, but only
with great effort. Viète used an ingenious manipulation of right
triangles and the well-known identity</p>
<p>to arrive at formulas for multiple angles equivalent to what we
should now write as</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>where the signs alternate and the coefficients are in magnitude the
alternate numbers in the appropriate line of the arithmetic triangle.
Here we see a striking link between trigonometry and the theory of
numbers.</p>
<p>Trigonometric Solution of Equations</p>
<p>Viète also noted an important link between his formulas and the
solution of the cubic equation. Trigonometry could serve as a handmaid
to algebra where the latter had run up against a stone wall—in the
irreducible case of the cubic. This evidently occurred to Viète when he
noticed that the angle trisection problem led to a cubic equation. If in
the equation x3 + 3px + q = 0 one substitutes mx = y (to obtain a degree
of freedom in the later selection of a value for m), the result is y3 +
3m2py + m3q = 0. Comparing this with the formula , one notes that if y =
cos θ, and if 3m2p = −, then − cos 3θ = m3q. Because p is given, m is
now known (and will be real whenever the three roots are real). Hence,
3θ is readily determined, because q is known; hence, cos θ is known.
Therefore, y, and from it x, will be known. Moreover, by considering all
possible angles satisfying the conditions, all three real roots will be
found. This trigonometric solution of the irreducible case of the cubic,
suggested by Viète, was later carried out in detail by Girard in 1629 in
Invention nouvelle en l’algèbre.</p>
<p>In 1593, Viète found an unusual opportunity to use his multiple-angle
formulas. The Belgian mathematician and professor of medicine Adriaen
van Roomen (1561–1615) had issued a public challenge to anyone to solve
an equation of the forty-fifth degree:</p>
<p>x45 − 45x43 + 945x41− · · · − 3795x3 + 45x = K.</p>
<p>The ambassador from the Low Countries to the court of Henry IV
boasted that France had no mathematician capable of solving the problem
proposed by his countryman. Viète, called on to defend the honor of
France, noted that the proposed equation was one that arises in
expressing K = sin 45θ in terms of x = 2 sin θ, and he promptly found
the positive roots. The achievement so impressed van Roomen that he paid
Viète a special visit; this resulted in their frequently communicating
and challenging each other with problems. When Viète sent van Roomen the
Apollonian problem of constructing a circle tangent to three given
circles, the latter solved it with the use of hyperbolas.</p>
<p>In applying trigonometry to arithmetic and algebraic problems, Viète
was broadening the scope of the subject. Moreover, his multiple-angle
formulas should have disclosed the periodicity of the goniometric
functions, but it was probably his hesitancy with respect to negative
numbers that prevented him—or his contemporaries—from going as far as
this. There was considerable enthusiasm for trigonometry in the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, but this primarily took the
form of synthesis and textbooks. It was during this period that the name
“trigonometry” came to be attached to the subject. It was used as the
title of an exposition by Bartholomaeus Pitiscus (1561–1613), the
successor to Valentin Otho at Heidelberg; this was first published in
1595 as a supplement to a book on spherics and again independently in
1600, 1606, and 1612. Coincidentally, the development of logarithms,
ever since a close ally of trigonometry, was also taking place during
these years.</p>
