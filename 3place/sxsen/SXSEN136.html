<h4 id="trigonometry">Trigonometry</h4>
<p>The direction of greatest progress in mathematics during the
sixteenth century was obviously in algebra, but developments in
trigonometry were not far behind, although they were not nearly so
spectacular. The construction of trigonometric tables is a dull task,
but they are of great usefulness to astronomers and mathematicians;
here, early sixteenthcentury Poland and Germany were very helpful
indeed. Most of us today think of Nicholas Copernicus (1473 1543) as an
astronomer who revolutionized the worldview by successfully putting the
earth in motion about the sun (where Aristarchus had tried and failed),
but an astronomer is almost inevitably a trigonometer as well, and we
owe to Copernicus a mathematical obligation, as well as an astronomical
debt.</p>
<p>Copernicus and Rheticus</p>
<p>During the lifetime of Regiomontanus, Poland had enjoyed a “Golden
Age” of learning, and the University of Cracow, where Copernicus
enrolled in 1491, had great prestige in mathematics and astronomy. After
further studies in law, medicine, and astronomy at Bologna, Padua, and
Ferrara and after some teaching at Rome, Copernicus returned to Poland
in 1510 to become Canon of Frauenburg. Despite multitudinous
administrative obligations, including currency reform and the curbing of
the Teutonic Order, Copernicus completed the celebrated treatise De
Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, which was published in 1543, the year
he died. This contains substantial sections on trigonometry that had
been separately published in the previous year under the title De
Lateribus et Angulis Triangulorum. The trigonometric material is similar
to that in Regiomontanus’s De Triangulis, published in Nuremberg only a
decade earlier, but Copernicus’s trigonometric ideas seem to date from
before 1533, at which time he probably did not know of the work of
Regiomontanus. It is quite likely, nevertheless, that the final form of
Copernicus’s trigonometry was in part derived from Regiomontanus, for in
1539 he received as a student Georg Joachim Rheticus (or Rhaeticus, 1514
1576), a professor at Wittenberg, who had visited in Nuremberg. Rheticus
worked with Copernicus for some three years, and it was he who, with his
teacher’s approval, published the first short account of Copernican
astronomy in a work titled Narratio Prima (1540) and who made the first
arrangements, completed by Andreas Osiander, for the printing of the
celebrated De Revolutionibus. It is likely, therefore, that the
trigonometry in the classic work of Copernicus is closely related,
through Rheticus, to that of Regiomontanus.</p>
<p>We see the thorough trigonometric capabilities of Copernicus not only
in the theorems included in De Revolutionibus, but also in a proposition
originally included by the author in an earlier manuscript version of
the book but not in the printed work. The deleted proposition is a
generalization of the theorem of Nasir Eddin (which does appear in the
book) on the rectilinear motion resulting from the compounding of two
circular motions. The theorem of Copernicus is as follows: if a smaller
circle rolls without slipping along the inside of a larger circle with a
diameter twice as great, then the locus of a point that is not on the
circumference of the smaller circle, but that is fixed with respect to
this smaller circle, is an ellipse. Cardan, incidentally, knew of the
Nasir Eddin theorem but not of the Copernican locus, a theorem
rediscovered in the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Through the trigonometric theorems in De Revolutionibus, Copernicus
spread the influence of Regiomontanus, but his student Rheticus went
further. He combined the ideas of Regiomontanus and Copernicus, together
with views of his own, in the most elaborate trigonometric treatise
composed up to that time: the two-volume Opus Palatinum de Triangulis.
Here,trigonometryreallycameofage.Theauthordiscardedthetraditional
considerationofthefunctionswithrespecttothearcofacircleandfocused
instead on the lines in a right triangle. Moreover, all six
trigonometric functions now came into full use, for Rheticus calculated
elaborate tables of all of them. Decimal fractions still had not come
into common use; hence, for the sine and cosine functions he used a
hypotenuse (radius) of
10,000,000andfortheotherfourfunctionsabase(oradjacentsideorradius) of
10,000,000 parts, for intervals in the angle of 10v. He began tables of
tangentsandsecantswithabaseof1015 parts,buthedidnotlivetofinishthem, and
the treatise was completed and edited, with additions, by his pupil
Valentin Otho (ca. 1550 1605) in 1596.</p>
<h2 id="geometry">Geometry</h2>
<p>Pure geometry in the sixteenth century presented fewer conspicuous
advances than algebra or trigonometry did, but it was not entirely
without representatives. Contributions were made in Germany by Johannes
Werner (1468 1522) and Albrecht Du¨rer (1471 1528) and in Italy by
Francesco Maurolico (1494 1575) and Pacioli. Once more, we note the
preeminence of these two countries in contributions to mathematics
during the Renaissance. Werner had aided in preserving the trigonometry
of Regiomontanus, but of more geometric significance was</p>
<p>his Latin work, in twenty-two books, on the Elements of Conics,
printed in Nuremberg in 1522. Although this cannot be favorably compared
with the Conics of Apollonius, which was almost entirely unknown in
Werner’s day, it marks the renewal of interest in the curves for almost
the first time since Pappus. Because the author was primarily concerned
with the duplication of the cube, he concentrated on the parabola and
the hyperbola, deriving the standard plane equations stereometrically
from the cone, as had his predecessors in Greece, but there seems to be
an element of originality in his plane method for plotting points on a
parabola with compasses and straightedge. One first draws a pencil of
circles tangent to each other and intersecting the common normal in
points c, d, e, f, g,…(Fig. 13.1). Then, along the common normal, one
marks off a distance ab equal to a desired parameter. At b one erects
the line bG perpendicular to ab and cutting the circles in points C, D,
E, F, G,…respectively. Then, at c one erects line segments cCuand cCv
perpendicular to ab and equal to bC; at d one erects perpendicular
segments dDu and dDv equal to bD; at e one erects segments eEu and eEv
equal to bE; and so on. Then, Cu, Cv, Du, Dv, Eu, Ev,…will all lie on
the parabola with vertex b, axis along ab, and having ab as the
magnitude of the parameter—as is readily seen from the relationships</p>
<p>ðcCuÞ2 5ab be; ðdDuÞ2 5ab bd; and so on:</p>
<p>The Theory of Perspective</p>
<p>Werner’s work is closely related to ancient studies of conics, but
meanwhile, in Italy and Germany, a relatively novel relationship between
mathematics and art was developing. One important respect in which
Renaissance art differed from art in the Middle Ages was in the</p>
<p>use of perspective in the plane representation of objects in
threedimensional space. The Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi
(1377 1446) is said to have given much attention to this problem, but
the first formal account of some of the problems was given by Leon
Battista Alberti (1404 1472) in a treatise of 1435 (printed in 1511)
titled Della pittura. Alberti opens with a general discussion of the
principles of foreshortening and then describes a method he invented for
representing in a vertical “picture plane” a set of squares in a
horizontal “ground plane.” Let the eye be at a “station point” S that is
h units above the ground plane and k units in front of the picture
plane. The intersection of the ground plane and the picture plane is
called the “groundline,” the foot V of the perpendicular from S to the
picture plane is called the “center of vision” (or the principal
vanishing point), the line through V parallel to the groundline is known
as the “vanishing line” (or horizon line), and the points P and Q on
this line, which are k units from V, are called the “distance points.”
If we take points A, B, C, D, E, F, G marking off equal distances along
the groundline RT (Fig. 13.2), where D is the intersection of this line
with the vertical plane through S and V, and if we draw lines connecting
these points with V, then the projection of these last lines, with S as
a center, on the ground plane will be a set of parallel and equidistant
lines. If P (or Q) is connected with the points B, C, D, E, F, G to form
another set of lines intersecting AV in points H, I, J, K, L, M, and if
through the latter points parallels are drawn to the groundline RT, then
the set of trapezoids in the picture plane will correspond to a set of
squares in the ground plane.</p>
<p>A further step in the development of perspective was taken by the</p>
<p>Italian painter of frescoes Piero della Francesca (ca. 1415 1492),
in</p>
<p>De prospectiva pingendi (ca. 1478). Where Alberti had concentrated
on</p>
<p>FIG. 13.2</p>
<p>representing on the picture plane figures in the ground plane, Piero
handled the more complicated problem of depicting on the picture plane
objects in three dimensions as seen from a given station point. He also
wrote De Corporibus Regularibus, where he noted the “divine proportion”
in which diagonals of a regular pentagon cut each other and where he
found the volume common to two equal circular cylinders whose axes cut
each other at right angles (unaware of Archimedes’ Method, which was
unknown at the time). The connection between art and mathematics was
also strong in the work of Leonardo da Vinci. He wrote a work, now lost,
on perspective; his Trattato della pittura opens with the admonition,
“Let no one who is not a mathematician read my works.” The same
combination of mathematical and artistic interests is seen in Albrecht
Du¨rer, a contemporary of Leonardo and a fellow townsman of Werner at
Nuremberg. In Du¨rer’s work, we also see the influence of Pacioli,
especially in the celebrated engraving of 1514 titled Melancholia. Here
the magic square figures prominently.</p>
<p>This is often regarded as the first use of a magic square in the
West, but Pacioli had left an unpublished manuscript, De viribus
quantitatis, in which interest in such squares is indicated.</p>
<p>Du¨rer’s interests in mathematics, however, were far more geometric
than arithmetic, as the title of his most important book indicates:
Investigation of the Measurement with Circles and Straight Lines of
Plane and Solid Figures. This work, which appeared in several German and
Latin editions from 1525 to 1538, contains some striking novelties, of
which the most important were his new curves. This is one direction in
which the Renaissance could easily have improved on the work of the
ancients, who had studied only a handful of types of curves. Du¨rer took
a fixed point on a circle and then allowed the circle to roll along the
circumference of another circle, generating an epicycloid, but, not
having the necessary algebraic tools, he did not study this
analytically. The same was true of other plane curves that he obtained
by projecting helical space curves onto a plane to form spirals. In
Du¨rer’s work, we find the Ptolemaic construction of the regular
pentagon, which is exact, as well as another original construction that
is only an approximation.</p>
<p>Albrecht Du¨rer’s Melancholia (the British Museum). Note the four
celled magic square in the upper right hand corner.</p>
<p>For the heptagon and the enneagon, he also gave ingenious but, of
course, inexact constructions. Du¨rer’s construction of an approximately
regular nonagon is as follows: Let O be the center of a circle ABC in
which A, B, and C are vertices of the inscribed equilateral triangle
(Fig. 13.3). Through A, O, and C draw a circular arc; draw similar arcs
through B, O, and C and through B, O, and A. Let AO be trisected at</p>
<p>points D and E, and through E draw a circle with center at O and
cutting arcs AFO and AGO in points F and G, respectively. Then, the
straight line segment FG will be very nearly equal to the side of the
regular nonagon inscribed in this smaller circle, the angle FOG
differing from 40 by less than 1. The relation of art and geometry might
have been very productive indeed, had it gained the attention of
professionally minded mathematicians, but in this respect, it failed for
more than a century after Du¨rer’s time.</p>
<p>Cartography</p>
<p>Projections of various sorts are essential to cartographers.
Geographical explorations had widened horizons and created a need for
better maps, but Scholasticism and Humanism were of little help here
because new discoveries had outmoded medieval and ancient maps. One of
the most important of the innovators was the German mathematician and
astronomer Peter Apian (or Bienewitz). In 1520, he published perhaps the
earliest map of the Old World and the New World in which the name
“America” was used; in 1527, he issued the business arithmetic in which,
on the title page, the arithmetic, or Pascal, triangle appeared in print
for the first time. The maps of Apian were well done, but they followed
Ptolemy closely wherever possible. For the novelty that is thought to be
so characteristic of the Renaissance, it is better to look instead to a
Flemish geographer, Gerard Mercator (or Gerhard Kremer, 1512 1594), who
was for a time associated with the court of Charles V in Brussels.
Mercator may be said to have broken with Ptolemy in geography as
Copernicus had revolted against Ptolemaic astronomy.</p>
<p>For the first half of his life, Mercator depended heavily on Ptolemy,
but by 1554, he had emancipated himself sufficiently to cut down the
Ptolemaic estimate of the width of the Mediterranean from 62 to 53.
(Actually, it is close to 40.) More important, in 1569 he published the
first map, Nova et aucta orbis terrae descriptio, drawn up on a new
principle. Maps</p>
<p>The Pascal triangle as first printed. Title page of the arithmetic of
Petrus Apianus, Ingolstadt, 1527, more than a century before Pascal
investigated the properties of the triangle.</p>
<p>in common use in Mercator’s day were usually based on a rectangular
grid made up of two sets of equidistant parallel lines, one set for
latitudes, the other for longitudes. The length of a degree of
longitude, however, varies with the parallel of latitude along which it
is measured, an inequality disregarded in common practice and resulting
in a distortion of shape and in errors of direction on the part of
navigators, who based a course on the straight line drawn between two
points on the map. The Ptolemaic stereographic projection preserved
shapes, but it did not use the common grid</p>
<p>Renai s s anc e Tr end s</p>
<p>of lines. To bring theory and practice into some accord, Mercator
introduced the projection that bears his name and that, with later
improvement, has been basic in cartography ever since. The first step in
the Mercator projection is to think of a spherical earth inscribed
within an indefinitely long right circular cylinder touching the earth
along the equator (or some other great circle), and to project, from the
center of the earth, points on the surface of the earth onto the
cylinder. If the cylinder is then cut along an element and flattened
out, the meridians and the parallels on the earth will have been
transformed into a rectangular network of lines. Distances between
successive meridian lines will be equal, but not distances between
successive lines of latitude. In fact, the latter distances increase so
rapidly, as one moves away from the equator, that distortions of shape
and direction occur, but Mercator found that through an empirically
determined modification of these distances, preservation of direction
and shape (although not of size) was possible. In 1599, Edward Wright
(1558 1615)—a fellow at Cambridge, a tutor to Henry, Prince of Wales,
and a good sailor— developed the theoretical basis of the Mercator
projection by computing the functional relationship D5alntan(φ/2145)
between map distance D from the equator and latitudeφ.</p>
