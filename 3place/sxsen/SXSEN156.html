<h4 id="blaise-pascal">Blaise Pascal</h4>
<p>Desargues was the prophet of projective geometry, but he went without
honor in his day, largely because his most promising disciple, Blaise
Pascal, abandoned mathematics for theology. Pascal was a mathematical
prodigy. His father, too, was mathematically inclined, and the “limac¸on
of Pascal” is named for the father, E´tienne, rather than for the son,
Blaise. The limac¸on r5a1bcosθ had been known to Jordanus</p>
<p>Nemorarius and possibly to the ancients as “the conchoid of the
circle,” but E´tienne Pascal studied the curve so thoroughly that on the
suggestion of Roberval, it has ever since borne his name.</p>
<p>When he was fourteen, Blaise joined with his father in the informal
meetings of the Mersenne Academy at Paris. Here he became familiar with
the ideas of Desargues; two years later, in 1640, the young Pascal, then
sixteen years old, published an Essay pour les coniques. This consisted
of only a single printed page—but one of the most fruitful pages in
history. It contained the proposition described by the author as
mysterium hexagrammicum, which has ever since been known as Pascal’s
theorem. This states, in essence, that the opposite sides of a</p>
<p>Blai s e Pa s c al</p>
<p>hexagon inscribed in a conic intersect in three collinear points.
Pascal did not state the theorem in this way, for it is not true unless,
as in the case of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, one resorts
to the ideal points and line of projective geometry. Instead, he
followed the special language of Desargues, saying that if A, B, C, D,
E, and F are successive vertices of a hexagon in a conic, and if P is
the intersection point of AB and DE and Q is the point of intersection
of BC and EF (Fig. 15.11), then PQ and CD and FA are lines “of the same
order” (or, as we should say, the lines are members of a pencil, whether
a point pencil or a parallel pencil). The young Pascal went on to say
that he had deduced many corollaries from this theorem, including the
construction of the tangent to a conic at a point on the conic. The
inspiration for the little Essay was candidly admitted, for, after
citing a theorem of Desargues, the young author wrote, “I should like to
say that I owe the little that I have found on this subject to his
writings.”</p>
<p>The Essay was an auspicious opening for a mathematical career, but
Pascal’smathematicalinterestswerechameleonlike.Henextturned,when he was
about eighteen, to plans for an adding machine, and within a few years,
he had built and sold some fifty machines (see the illustration on page
293, chapter 14). Then, in 1648, Pascal became interested in
hydrostatics,andtheresults werethecelebratedPuy-de-Doˆmeexperiment
confirming the weight of the air and the experiments on fluid pressure
that clarified the hydrostatic paradox. In 1654, he returned again to
mathematics and worked on two unrelated projects. One of these was to be
a Complete Work on Conics, evidently a continuation of the little Essay
he had published when sixteen, but this larger work on conics was never
printedandisnotnowextant.Leibnizsawamanuscriptcopy,andthenotes that he
took are now all that we have of Pascal’s larger work on conics. (Only
two copies of the smaller work have survived.) According to Leibniz’s
notes, the Complete Work on Conics contained a section on the</p>
<p>familiar three- and four-line locus and a section on the magna
problema— to place a given conic on a given cone of revolution.</p>
