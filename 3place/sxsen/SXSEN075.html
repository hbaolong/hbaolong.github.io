<h4 id="diophantus-of-alexandria">Diophantus of Alexandria</h4>
<p>We have seen that Greek mathematics was not uniformly on a high
level, for the glorious period of the third century BCE had been
followed by a</p>
<p>Diophantus of Ale x andr ia</p>
<p>decline, perhaps to some extent arrested in the days of Ptolemy, but
not effectively reversed until the century of the “Silver Age,” about
250 CE to 350. At the beginning of this period, also known as the Later
Alexandrian Age, we find the leading Greek algebraist Diophantus of
Alexandria, and toward its close there appeared the last significant
Greek geometer, Pappus of Alexandria. No other city has been the center
of mathematical activity for so long a period as was Alexandria from the
days of</p>
<p>Euclid (ca. 300 BCE) to the time of Hypatia (415 CE).</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the life of Diophantus is so great that we do not
definitely know in which century he lived. Generally, he is assumed to
have flourished about 250 CE. According to a tradition that is reported
in a collection of problems known as the Greek Anthology (described
further on):</p>
<p>God granted him to be a boy for the sixth part of his life, and
adding a twelfth part to this, He clothed his cheeks with down; He lit
him the light of wedlock after a seventh part, and five years after his
marriage He granted him a son. Alas! late-born wretched child; after
attaining the measure of half his father’s life, chill Fate took him.
After consoling his grief by this science of numbers for four years he
ended his life (Cohen and Drabkin 1958; p. 27).</p>
<p>If this conundrum is historically accurate, Diophantus lived to be
eighty-four years old.</p>
<p>Diophantus is often called the father of algebra, but we shall see
that such a designation is not to be taken literally. His work is not at
all the type of material that forms the basis of modern elementary
algebra, nor is it yet similar to the geometric algebra found in Euclid.
The chief Diophantine work known to us is the Arithmetica, a treatise
originally in thirteen books, only the first six of which have
survived.</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus was a treatise characterized by a high
degree of mathematicalskill and ingenuity.In thisrespect, thebookcan be
compared with the great classics of the earlier Alexandrian Age, yet it
has practically nothing in common with these or, in fact, with any
traditional Greek mathematics. It essentially represents a new branch
and makes use of a different approach. Being divorced from geometric
methods, it resembles Babylonian algebra to a large extent. But whereas
Babylonian mathematicians had been concerned primarily with the
approximate
solutionofdeterminateequationsasfarasthethirddegree,theArithmetica of
Diophantus (such as we have it) is almost entirely devoted to the exact
solution of equations, both determinate and indeterminate. Because of
the emphasis given in the Arithmetica to the solution of indeterminate
problems, the subject dealing with this topic, sometimes known as
indeterminate analysis, has since become known as Diophantine
analysis.</p>
<p>Algebra now is based almost exclusively on symbolic forms of
statement, rather than on the customary written language of ordinary
communication in which earlier Greek mathematics, as well as Greek
literature, had been expressed. It has been said that three stages in
the historical development of algebra can be recognized: (1) the
rhetorical or early stage, in which everything is written out fully in
words; (2) a syncopated or intermediate stage, in which some
abbreviations are adopted; and (3) a symbolic or final stage. Such an
arbitrary division of the development of algebra into three stages is,
of course, a facile oversimplification, but it can serve effectively as
a first approximation to what has happened, and within such a framework
the Arithmetica of Diophantus is to be placed in the second
category.</p>
<p>Throughout the six surviving books of the Arithmetica, there is a
systematic use of abbreviations for powers of numbers and for
relationships and operations. An unknown number is represented by a
symbol that resembles the Greek letter (perhaps for the last letter of
arithmos); the square of this appears as Δγ; the cube as Kγ; the fourth
power, called square-square, as ΔγΔ; the fifth power, or square-cube, as
ΔKγ; and the sixth power, or cube-cube, as KγK. Diophantus was familiar
with the rules of combination equivalent to our laws of exponents. The
chief difference between the Diophantine syncopation and the modern
algebraic notation is in the lack of special symbols for operations and
relations, as well as of the exponential notation.</p>
<p>Diophantine Problems</p>
<p>If we think primarily of matters of notation, Diophantus has a good
claim to be known as the father of algebra, but in terms of motivation
and concepts, the claim is less appropriate. The Arithmetica is not a
systematic exposition of the algebraic operations or of algebraic
functions or of the solution of algebraic equations. It is instead a
collection of 150 problems, all worked out in terms of specific
numerical examples, although perhaps generality of method was intended.
There is no postulational development, nor is an effort made to find all
possible solutions. No clearcut distinction is made between determinate
and indeterminate problems, and even for the latter, for which the
number of solutions generally is unlimited, only a single answer is
given. Diophantus solved problems involving several unknown numbers by
skillfully expressing all unknown quantities, where possible, in terms
of only one of them.</p>
<p>Diophantus used much the same approach in indeterminate analysis. In
one problem, it is required to find two numbers such that either
when</p>
<p>Diophantus of Ale x andr ia</p>
<p>added to the square of the other will yield a perfect square. This is
a typical instance of Diophantine analysis, in which only rational
numbers are acceptable as answers. In solving the problem, Diophantus
did not call the numbers x and y, but rather x and 2x11. Here the
second, when added to the square of the first, will yield a perfect
square no matter what value one chooses for x. Now, it is also required
that (2x11)2 1x must be a perfect square. Here Diophantus does not point
out the infinity of possible answers. He is satisfied to choose a
particular case of a perfect square, in this instance the number
(2x22)2, such that when equated to (2x11)2 1x, an equation that is
linear in x results. Here the result is x5, so that the other number,
2x11, is . One could, of course, have used (2x23)2 or (2x24)2 or
expressions of similar form, instead of (2x22)2, to arrive at other
pairs of numbers having the desired property. Here we see an approach
that comes close to a “method” in Diophantus’s work: When two conditions
are to be satisfied by two numbers, the two numbers are so chosen that
one of the two conditions is satisfied, and then one turns to the
problem of satisfying the second condition. That is, instead of handling
simultaneous equations on two unknowns, Diophantus operates with
successive conditions, so that only a single unknown number appears in
the work.</p>
<p>The Place of Diophantus in Algebra</p>
<p>Among the indeterminate problems in the Arithmetica are some
involving equations such as x2 51130y2 and x2 51126y2, which are
instances of the so-called Pell equation, x2 511py2; again, a single
answer is thought to suffice. In a sense, it is not fair to criticize
Diophantus for being satisfied with a single answer, for he was solving
problems, not equations. The Arithmetica is not an algebra textbook, but
a problem collection in the application of algebra. In this respect,
Diophantus is like the Babylonian algebraists, but his numbers are
entirely abstract and do not refer to measures of grain or dimensions of
fields or monetary units, as was the case in Egyptian and Mesopotamian
algebra. Moreover, he is interested only in exact rational solutions,
whereas the Babylonians were computationally inclined and were willing
to accept approximations to irrational solutions of equations.</p>
<p>We do not know how many of the problems in the Arithmetica were
original or whether Diophantus had borrowed from other similar
collections. Possibly, some of the problems or methods are traceable
back to Babylonian sources, for puzzles and exercises have a way of
reappearing generation after generation. To us today, the Arithmetica of
Diophantus looks strikingly original, but possibly this impression
results from the loss of rival problem collections. Indications that
Diophantus may have been less isolated a figure than has been supposed
are found in a collection of problems from about the early second
century of our era (hence, presumably antedating the Arithmetica), in
which some Diophantine symbols appear. Nevertheless, Diophantus has had
a greater influence on modern number theory than any other nongeometric
Greek mathematician has. In particular, Pierre de Fermat was led to his
celebrated “great” or “last” theorem when he sought to generalize a
problem that he had read in the Arithmetica of Diophantus (II.8): to
divide a given square into two squares.</p>
<p>Pappus of Alexandria</p>
<p>The Arithmetica of Diophantus is a brilliant work worthy of the
period of revival in which it was written, but it is, in motivation and
content, far removed from the beautifully logical treatises of the great
geometric triumvirate of the earlier Alexandrian Age. Algebra seemed to
be more appropriate for problem solving than for deductive exposition,
and the great work of Diophantus remained outside the mainstream of
Greek mathematics. A minor work on polygonal numbers by Diophantus comes
closer to the earlier Greek interests, but even this cannot be regarded
as approaching the Greek logical ideal. Classical geometry had found no
ardent supporter, with the possible exception of Menelaus, since the
death of Apollonius some four hundred and more years earlier. But during
the reign of Diocletian (284 305 CE), there lived again in Alexandria a
scholar who was moved by the spirit that had possessed Euclid,
Archimedes, and Apollonius.</p>
<p>The Collection</p>
<p>In about 320 CE, Pappus of Alexandria composed a work with the title
Collection (Synagoge), which is important for several reasons. In the
first place, it provides a most valuable historical record of parts of
Greek mathematics that otherwise would be unknown to us. For instance,
it is in Book V of the Collection that we learn of Archimedes’ discovery
of the thirteen semiregular polyhedra or “Archimedean solids.” Then,
too, the Collection includes alternative proofs and supplementary lemmas
for propositions in Euclid, Archimedes, Apollonius, and Ptolemy.
Finally, the treatise includes new discoveries and generalizations not
found in any earlier work. The Collection, Pappus’s most important
treatise, contained eight books, but the first book and the first part
of the second book are now lost.</p>
<p>Book III of the Collection shows that Pappus thoroughly shared the
classical Greek appreciation of the niceties of logical precision in
geometry. Here he distinguishes sharply among “plane,” “solid,” and
“linear” problems—the first being constructible with only circles</p>
<p>and straight lines, the second being solvable through the use of
conic sections, and the last requiring curves other than lines, circles,
and conics. Then, Pappus describes some solutions of the three famous
problems of antiquity, the duplication and the trisection being problems
in the second or solid category and the squaring of the circle being a
linear problem. Here Pappus virtually asserts the fact that the
classical problems are impossible to solve under the Platonic
conditions, for they do not belong among the plane problems; but
rigorous proofs were not given until the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>In Book IV, Pappus is again insistent that one should give for a
problem a construction appropriate to it. That is, one should not use
linear loci in the solution of a solid problem or solid or linear loci
in the solution of a plane problem. Asserting that the trisection of an
angle is a solid problem, he therefore suggests methods that make use of
conic sections, whereas Archimedes in one case had used a neusis, or
slidingruler type of construction, and in another the spiral, which is a
linear locus. One of the Pappus trisections is as follows. Let the given
angle AOB be placed in a circle with center O (Fig. 8.13) and let OC be
the angle bisector. Draw the hyperbola having A as one focus, OC as the
corresponding directrix, and with an eccentricity equal to 2. Then, one
branch of this hyperbola will cut the circumference of the circle in a
point T such that +AOT is one-third +AOB.</p>
<p>A second trisection construction proposed by Pappus makes use of an
equilateral hyperbola as follows. Let the side OB of the given angle AOB
be a diagonal of a rectangle ABCO, and through A draw the equilateral
hyperbola having BC and OC (extended) as asymptotes (Fig. 8.14). With A
as center and with radius twice OB, draw a circle intersecting the
hyperbola in P, and from P drop the perpendicular PT to the line CB
extended. Then, it is readily proved, from the properties of the
hyperbola, that the straight line through O and T is parallel to AP and
that +AOT is one-third +AOB. Pappus gives no source for his trisections,
and we cannot help but wonder whether this trisection was known to
Archimedes. If we draw the semicircle passing through B, having QT
as</p>
<p>diameter and M as center, we have essentially the Archimedean neusis
construction, for OB5QM5MT5MB.</p>
<p>In Book III, Pappus also describes the theory of means and gives an
attractive construction that includes the arithmetic, the geometric, and
the harmonic means within a single semicircle. Pappus shows that if in
the semicircle ADC with center O (Fig. 8.15) one has DB ? AC and BF ?
OD, then DO is the arithmetic mean, DB the geometric mean, and DF the
harmonic mean of the magnitudes AB and BC. Here Pappus claims for
himself only the proof, attributing the diagram to an unnamed
geometer.</p>
<p>Theorems of Pappus</p>
<p>The Collection of Pappus is replete with bits of interesting
information and significant new results. In many cases, the novelties
take the form of generalizations of earlier theorems, and a couple of
these instances appear in Book IV. Here we find an elementary
generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. If ABC is any triangle (Fig.
8.16) and if ABDE and</p>
<p>FIG. 8.15</p>
<p>CBGF are any parallelograms constructed on two of the sides, then
Pappus constructs on side AC a third parallelogram ACKL equal to the sum
of the other two. This is easily accomplished by extending sides FG and
ED to meet in H, then drawing HB and extending it to meet side AC in J,
and finally drawing AL and CK parallel to HBJ. It is not known whether
this generalization, usually bearing the name of Pappus, was original
with Pappus, and it has been suggested that possibly it was known
earlier to Heron. Another instance of generalization in Book IV, also
bearing Pappus’s name, extends theorems of Archimedes on the shoemaker’s
knife. It asserts that if circles C1, C2, C3, C4,…, Cn,… are inscribed
successively as in Fig. 8.17, all being tangent to the semicircles on AB
and on AC, and successively to one another, the perpendicular distance
from the center of the nth circle to the base line ABC is n times the
diameter of the nth circle.</p>
<p>The Pappus Problem</p>
<p>Book V of the Collection was a favorite with later commentators, for
it raised a question about the sagacity of bees. Inasmuch as Pappus
showed that of two regular polygons having equal perimeters, the one
with the greater number of sides has the greater area, he concluded that
bees demonstrated some degree of mathematical understanding in
constructing</p>
<p>their cells as hexagonal, rather than square or triangular, prisms.
The book goes into other problems of isoperimetry, including a
demonstration that the circle has a greater area, for a given perimeter,
than does any regular polygon. Here Pappus seems to have been closely
following On Isometric Figures, written almost half a millennium earlier
by Zenodorus (ca. 180 BCE), some fragments of which were preserved by
later commentators. Among the propositions in Zenodorus’s treatise was
one asserting that of all solid figures the surfaces of
whichareequal,thespherehasthegreatestvolume,butonlyanincomplete
justification was given.</p>
<p>Books VI and VIII of the Collection are chiefly on applications of
mathematics to astronomy, optics, and mechanics (including an
unsuccessful attempt at finding the law of the inclined plane). Of far
more significance in the history of mathematics is Book VII, in which,
through his penchant for generalization, Pappus came close to the
fundamental principle of analytic geometry. The only means recognized by
the ancients for defining plane curves were (1) kinematic definitions in
which a point moves the subject to two superimposed motions, and (2) the
section by a plane of a geometric surface, such as a cone or a sphere or
a cylinder. Among the latter curves were certain quartics known as
spiric sections, described by Perseus (ca. 150 BCE), obtained by cutting
the anchor ring or torus by a plane. Occasionally, a twisted curve
caught the attention of the Greeks, including the cylindrical helix and
an analogue of the Archimedean spiral described on a spherical surface,
both of which were known to Pappus, but Greek geometry was primarily
restricted to the study of plane curves, in fact, to a very limited
number of plane curves. It is significant to note, therefore, that in
Book VII of the Collection, Pappus proposed a generalized problem that
implied infinitely many new types of curves. This problem, even in its
simplest form, is usually known as the “Pappus problem,” but the
original statement, involving three or four lines, seems to go back to
the days of Euclid. As first considered, the problem is referred to as
“the locus to three or four lines,” described previously in connection
with the work of Apollonius. Euclid evidently had identified the locus
only for certain special cases, but it appears that Apollonius, in a
work now lost, had given a complete solution. Pappus nevertheless gave
the impression that geometers had failed in attempts at a general
solution and implied that it was he who had first shown the locus in all
cases to be a conic section.</p>
<p>More important, Pappus then went on to consider the analogous problem
for more than four lines. For six lines in a plane, he recognized that a
curve is determined by the condition that the product of the distances
from three of the lines shall be in a fixed ratio to the product of the
distances to the other three lines. In this case, a curve is defined by
the fact that a solid is in a fixed ratio to another solid. Pappus
hesitated to go on to cases involving more than six lines, inasmuch as
“there is not anything contained by more than three dimensions.” But, he
continued, “men a little before our time have allowed themselves to
interpret such things, signifying nothing at all comprehensible,
speaking of the product of the content of such and such lines by the
square of this or the content of those. These things might however be
stated and shown generally by means of compounded proportions.” The
unnamed predecessors evidently were prepared to take a highly important
step in the direction of an analytic geometry that should include curves
of a degree higher than three, just as Diophantus had used the
expressions square-square and cube-cube for higher powers of numbers.
Had Pappus pursued the suggestion further, he might have anticipated
Descartes in a general classification and theory of curves far beyond
the classical distinction between plane, solid, and linear loci. His
recognition that, no matter what the number of lines in the Pappus
problem, a specific curve is determined is the most general observation
on loci in all of ancient geometry, and the algebraic syncopations that
Diophantus had developed would have been adequate to have disclosed some
of the properties of the curves. But Pappus was at heart only a
geometer, as Diophantus had been only an algebraist; hence, Pappus
merely remarked with surprise that no one had made a synthesis of this
problem for any case beyond that of four lines. Pappus himself made no
deeper study of these loci, “of which one has no further knowledge and
which are simply called curves.” What was needed for the next step in
this connection was the appearance of a mathematician equally concerned
about algebra and geometry; it is significant to note that when such a
figure appeared in the person of Descartes, it was this very problem of
Pappus’s that served as the point of departure in the invention of
analytic geometry.</p>
<p>TheTreasury of Analysis</p>
<p>There are other important topics in Book VII of the Collection, apart
from the Pappus problem. For one thing, there is a full description of
what was called the method of analysis and of a collection of works
known as the Treasury of Analysis. Pappus describes analysis as “a
method of taking that which is sought as though it were admitted and
passing from it through its consequences in order to something which is
admitted as a result of synthesis.” That is, he recognized analysis as a
“reverse solution,” the steps of which must be retraced in opposite
order to constitute a valid demonstration. If analysis leads to
something admitted to be impossible, the problem will also be
impossible, for a false conclusion implies a false premise. Pappus
explains that the method of analysis and synthesis is used by the
authors whose works constitute the Treasury of Analysis: “This is a body
of doctrine furnished for the use of those who, after going through the
usual elements, wish to obtain power to solve problems set to them
involving curves,” and Pappus lists among the works in the Treasury of
Analysis the treatises on conics by Aristaeus, Euclid, and Apollonius.
It is from Pappus’s description that we learn that Apollonius’s Conics
contained 487 theorems. Because the seven books now extant comprise 382
propositions, we can conclude that the lost eighth book had 105
propositions. About half of the works listed by Pappus in the Treasury
of Analysis are now lost, including Apollonius’s Cutting-off of a Ratio,
Eratosthenes’ On Means, and Euclid’s Porisms.</p>
<p>The Pappus-Guldin Theorems</p>
<p>Book VII of the Collection contains the first statement on record of
the focus-directrix property of the three conic sections. It appears
that Apollonius knew of the focal properties for central conics, but it
is possible that the focus-directrix property for the parabola was not
known before Pappus. Another theorem in Book VII that appears for the
first time is one usually named for Paul Guldin, a seventeenth-century
mathematician: If a closed plane curve is revolved about a line not
passing through the curve, the volume of the solid generated is found by
taking the product of the area bounded by the curve and the distance
traversed during the revolution by the center of gravity of the area.
Pappus was rightfully proud of this very general theorem, for it
included “a large number of theorems of all sorts about curves,
surfaces, and solids, all of which are proved simultaneously by one
demonstration.” There is a possibility that the “Guldin theorem”
represents an interpolation in the manuscript of the Collection. In any
case, the theorem is a striking advance by someone during or following
the long period of decline. Pappus also gave the analogous theorem that
the surface area generated by the revolution of a curve about a line not
cutting the curve is equal to the product of the length of the curve and
the distance traversed by the centroid of the curve during the
revolution.</p>
