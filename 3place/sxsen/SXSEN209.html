<h4 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h4>
<p>The leadership role of the mathematical community in Paris diminished
rapidly after 1830. This was due in part to the dying out of an older
generation; in part, to efforts elsewhere, notably in England and
Prussia, to establish mathematics more solidly; and, in part, to
political circumstances in France. After the deaths in 1827, 1830, and
1833, respectively, of Laplace, Fourier, and Legendre, and the departure
of Cauchy from Paris in 1830, the best-known French mathematician born
before the revolution and still active was Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781´
1840).</p>
<p>Poisson</p>
<p>Poisson would become a physician, but strong mathematical interests
led him in 1798 to enter the E´cole Polytechnique, where on graduation
he became successively a lecturer, a professor, and an examiner. He is
said to have once remarked that life is good for only two things: to do
mathematics and to teach it. Consequently, he published almost 400
works, and he enjoyed a reputation as an excellent instructor.</p>
<p>The direction of his research is indicated in part by a sentence from
a letter written in 1826 by Abel concerning the mathematicians in Paris:
“Cauchy is the only one occupied with pure mathematics; Poisson,
Fourier, Ampe`re, etc., busy themselves exclusively with magnetism and
other physical subjects.” This should not be taken too literally,
but</p>
<p>Di f fus ion</p>
<p>Poisson, in memoirs of 1812, did help make electricity and magnetism
a branch of mathematical physics, as did Gauss, Cauchy, and Green.
Poisson was also a worthy successor to Laplace in studies on celestial
mechanics and the attraction of spheroids. The Poisson integral in
potential theory, the Poisson brackets in differential equations, the
Poisson ratio in elasticity, and Poisson’s constant in electricity
indicate the importance of his contributions to various fields of
applied mathematics. Two of his best-known treatises were the Traite de
m´ ecanique´ (2 vols., 1811, 1833) and Recherches sur la probabilite des
jugements´ (1837). In the latter appears the familiar Poisson
distribution, or Poisson’s law of large numbers. In the binomial
distribution (p1q)n, (where p1q51 and n is the number of trials), as n
increases indefinitely, the binomial distribution ordinarily tends
toward a normal distribution, but if, as n increases indefinitely, p
approaches zero, the product np remaining constant, the limiting case of
the binomial distribution is the Poisson distribution.</p>
<p>His analytic skill in refining the mathematical physics of Lagrange
and Laplace gained him early fame. His critical analyses of the work of
others often led him to innovative new concepts; an example is his
memoir on potential theory following his study of the work of James
Ivory (1765 1842). Poisson’s important memoir, in turn, was studied by
George Green (1793 1841) and was a significant ingredient in Green’s
1828 memoir on the subject. Yet Poisson’s clinging to superseded
physical concepts and his claims to a rigor that applied to his
selfassurance more than to his mathematics kept him from assuming the
mantle of mathematical leadership in later years. When men such as
Jacobi and Dirichlet chose the problems of Poisson for special treatment
in their lectures and memoirs, it was to recast them in a new mold.</p>
<p>Reforms in England and Prussia</p>
<p>Reform characterized much of the activity affecting mathematicians in
England, as well as in Prussia. The turning point in British mathematics
came in 1813 with the formation at Trinity College, Cambridge, of the
Analytical Society, which was led by three young Cantabrigians: the
algebraist George Peacock (1791 1858), the astronomer John Herschel
(1792 1871), and Charles Babbage (1791/2 1871) of “Calculating Engines”
fame. The immediate purpose of the society was to reform the teaching
and the notation of the calculus, and in 1817, when Peacock was
appointed an examiner for the mathematical tripos, differential notation
replaced fluxional symbols on the Cambridge examination. Peacock was
himself a Cambridge graduate and teacher, the first of many Trinity
College men who were to lead in the development of algebra. He graduated
as second wrangler—that is, he took second place in the celebrated
tripos examination (initiated in 1725) for undergraduates who had
specialized in mathematics—the first wrangler being John Herschel,
another of the founders of the Analytical Society. Peacock was a zealous
administrator and reformer, taking an active part in modifying the
university statutes and in establishing the Astronomical Society of
London, the Philosophical Society of Cambridge, and the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, the latter of which set the
pattern for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The
last twenty years of his life were spent as dean of Ely cathedral.</p>
<p>Peacock did not produce any outstanding new results in mathematics,
but he was of great importance in reforming the subject in Britain,
especially with respect to algebra. At Cambridge, there had been a
tendency in algebra as conservative as that in geometry and analysis.
Whereas on the Continent, mathematicians were developing the graphical
representation of complex numbers, in England there were protests that
not even negative numbers had validity.</p>
<p>In the words of Charles Babbage, the aim of the Analytical Society
was to promote “the principles of pure d-ism as opposed to the dot-age
of the university.” (A second aim of the Society was “to leave the world
wiser than they found it.”) This was, of course, a reference to the
continued refusal of the English to abandon the dotted fluxions of
Newton for the differentials of Leibniz; more generally, it also implied
a desire to take advantage of the great strides in mathematics that had
been made on the Continent. In 1816, as a result of the society’s
inspiration, an English translation of Lacroix’s one-volume Calculus was
published, and within a few years, British mathematicians were in a
position to vie with their contemporaries on the Continent. For example,
George Green, a selfeducated miller’s son, who, as we noted, studied
Poisson’s memoir on potential theory, in 1828 published for private
circulation the essay on electricity and magnetism that contained the
important theorem bearing his name: If P(x, y) and Q(x, y) have
continuous partial derivatives over a region R of the xy-plane bounded
by a curve C, then C Pdx1 Qdy5ÐÐRðQx 2PyÞdxdy: This theorem, or its
analogue in threeÐ dimensions, is also known as Gauss’s theorem, for
Green’s results were largely overlooked until rediscovered by Lord
Kelvin in 1846. The theorem, meanwhile, had also been discovered by
Mikhail Ostrogradski and in Russia, it bears his name to this day.</p>
<p>In Prussia, a large share of the credit for the rejuvenation of
mathematics goes to the brothers Humboldt. Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767
1835), a philologist, is best known for his reform of the Prussian
educational system. Alexander von Humboldt (1769 1859), a liberal
courtier, a natural historian, and a friend of mathematical scientists,
used his considerable influence in Berlin to assure Dirichlet’s return
to Prussia from Paris; he also aided the careers of C. G. J. Jacobi and
G. Eisenstein, among others, and showed interest in Abel.</p>
<p>Di f fus ion</p>
<p>As a result, by midcentury a substantial number of mathematicians
were actively pursuing research in France, Prussia, and England. Each
country had established a major mathematical journal in the second
quarter of the century. In 1836, Liouville had founded the Journal de
Mathematiques Pures et Appliqu´ ees´ . The Cambridge Mathematical
Journal followed. Crelle’s Journal continued to thrive, with much active
support from Dirichlet and his students.</p>
