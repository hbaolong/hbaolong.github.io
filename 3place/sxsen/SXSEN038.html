<h4 id="paradoxes-of-zeno">Paradoxes of Zeno</h4>
<p>The Pythagorean doctrine that “Numbers constitute the entire heaven”
was now faced with a very serious problem indeed, but it was not the
only one, for the school was also confronted with arguments propounded
by the neighboring Eleatics, a rival philosophical movement. Ionian
philosophers of Asia Minor had sought to identify a first principle for
all things. Thales had thought to find this in water, but others
preferred to think of air or fire as the basic element. The Pythagoreans
had taken a more abstract direction, postulating that number in all of
its plurality was the basic stuff behind phenomena; this numerical
atomism, beautifully illustrated in the geometry of figurate numbers,
had come under attack by the followers of Parmenides of Elea (fl. ca.
450 BCE). The fundamental tenet of the Eleatics was the unity and
permanence of being, a view that contrasted with the Pythagorean ideas
of multiplicity and change. Of Parmenides’ disciples, the best known was
Zeno the Eleatic (fl. ca. 450 BCE), who propounded arguments to prove
the inconsistency in the concepts of multiplicity and divisibility. The
method Zeno adopted was dialectical, anticipating Socrates in this
indirect mode of argument: starting from his opponent’s premises, he
reduced these to an absurdity.</p>
<p>The Pythagoreans had assumed that space and time can be thought of as
consisting of points and instants, but space and time also have a
property, more easily intuited than defined, known as “continuity.” The
ultimate elements making up a plurality were assumed, on the one hand,
to have the characteristics of the geometric unit—the point—and, on the
other, to have certain characteristics of the numeric units or numbers.
Aristotle described a Pythagorean point as “unity having position” or as
“unity considered in space.” It has been suggested that it was against
such a view that Zeno propounded his paradoxes, of which those on motion
are cited most frequently. As they have come down to us, through
Aristotle and others, four of them seem to have caused the most trouble:
(1) the Dichotomy, (2) the Achilles, (3) the Arrow, and (4) the Stade.
The first argues that before a moving object can travel a given
distance, it must first travel half of this distance, but before it can
cover this, it must travel the first quarter of the distance, and before
this, the first eighth, and so on, through an infinite number of
subdivisions. The runner wishing to get started must make an infinite
number of contacts in a finite time, but it is impossible to exhaust an
infinite collection, hence the beginning of motion is impossible. The
second of the paradoxes is similar to the first, except that the
infinite subdivision is progressive, rather than regressive. Here
Achilles is racing against a tortoise that has been given a head start,
and it is argued that Achilles, no matter how swiftly he may run, can
never overtake the tortoise, no matter how slow it may be. By the time
that Achilles will have reached the initial position of the tortoise,
the latter will have advanced some short distance, and by the time that
Achilles will have covered this distance, the tortoise will have
advanced somewhat farther, and so the process continues indefinitely,
with the result that the swift Achilles can never overtake the slow
tortoise.</p>
<p>The Dichotomy and the Achilles argue that motion is impossible under
the assumption of the infinite subdivisibility of space and time; the
Arrow and the Stade, on the other hand, argue that motion is equally
impossible if one makes the opposite assumption—that the subdivisibility
of space and time terminates in indivisibles. In the Arrow, Zeno argues
that an object in flight always occupies a space equal to itself, but
that which always occupies a space equal to itself is not in motion.
Hence, the flying arrow is at rest at all times, so that its motion is
an illusion.</p>
<p>Most controversial of the paradoxes on motion and most awkward to
describe is the Stade (or Stadium), but the argument can be phrased
somewhat as follows. Let A1, A2, A3, A4 be bodies of equal size that are
stationary; let B1, B2, B3, B4 be bodies, of the same size as the A’s,
that are moving to the right so that each B passes each A in an
instant—the smallest possible interval of time. Let C1, C2, C3, C4 also
be of equal size with the A’s and B’s and let them move uniformly to the
left with respect</p>
<p>Para do x e s of Z eno</p>
<p>to the A’s so that each C passes each A in an instant of time. Let us
assume that at a given time, the bodies occupy the following relative
positions:</p>
<p>Then, after the lapse of a single instant—that is, after an
indivisible subdivision of time—the positions will be as follows:</p>
<p>It is clear, then, that C1 will have passed two of the B’s; hence,
the instant cannot be the minimum time interval, for we can take as a
new and smaller unit the time it takes C1 to pass one of the B’s.</p>
<p>The arguments of Zeno seem to have had a profound influence on the
developmentofGreekmathematics,comparabletothatofthediscoveryof the
incommensurable, with which they may have been related. Originally,
inPythagoreancircles,magnitudeswererepresentedbypebblesorcalculi, from
which our word “calculation” comes, but by the time of Euclid there is a
complete change in point of view. Magnitudes are not in general
associated with numbers or pebbles, but with line segments. In the
Elements, even the integers themselves are represented by segments of
lines. The realm of number continued to have the property of
discreteness, but the world of continuous magnitudes (and this includes
most of preHellenic and Pythagorean mathematics) was a thing apart from
number andhadtobetreated throughgeometricmethod.Itseemedtobe geometry,
rather than number, that ruled the world. This was perhaps the most
farreaching conclusion of the Heroic Age, and it is not unlikely that
this was due in large measure to Zeno of Elea and Hippasus of
Metapontum.</p>
