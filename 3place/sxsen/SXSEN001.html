<h4 id="foreword-to-the-second-edition">Foreword to the Second
Edition</h4>
<p>By Isaac Asimov</p>
<p>Mathematics is a unique aspect of human thought, and its history
differs in essence from all other histories.</p>
<p>As time goes on, nearly every field of human endeavor is marked by
changes which can be considered as correction and/or extension. Thus,
the changes in the evolving history of political and military events are
always chaotic; there is no way to predict the rise of a Genghis Khan,
for example, or the consequences of the short-lived Mongol Empire. Other
changes are a matter of fashion and subjective opinion. The
cave-paintings of 25,000 years ago are generally considered great art,
and while art has continuously—even chaotically—changed in the
subsequent millennia, there are elements of greatness in all the
fashions. Similarly, each society considers its own ways natural and
rational, and finds the ways of other societies to be odd, laughable, or
repulsive.</p>
<p>But only among the sciences is there true progress; only there is the
record one of continuous advance toward ever greater heights.</p>
<p>And yet, among most branches of science, the process of progress is
one of both correction and extension. Aristotle, one of the greatest
minds ever to contemplate physical laws, was quite wrong in his views on
falling bodies and had to be corrected by Galileo in the 1590s. Galen,
the greatest of ancient physicians, was not allowed to study human
cadavers and was quite wrong in his anatomical and physiological
conclusions. He had to be corrected by Vesalius in 1543 and Harvey in
1628. Even Newton, the greatest of all scientists, was wrong in his view
of the nature of light, of the achromaticity of lenses, and missed the
existence of spectral lines. His masterpiece, the laws of motion and the
theory of universal gravitation, had to be modified by Einstein in
1916.</p>
<p>Now we can see what makes mathematics unique. Only in mathematics is
there no significant correction—only extension. Once the Greeks had
developed the deductive method, they were correct in what they did,
correct for all time. Euclid was incomplete and his work has been
extended enormously, but it has not had to be corrected. His theorems
are, every one of them, valid to this day.</p>
<p>Ptolemy may have developed an erroneous picture of the planetary
system, but the system of trigonometry he worked out to help him with
his calculations remains correct forever.</p>
<p>Each great mathematician adds to what came previously, but nothing
needs to be uprooted. Consequently, when we read a book like A History
of Mathematics, we get the picture of a mounting structure, ever taller
and broader and more beautiful and magnificent and with a foundation,
moreover, that is as untainted and as functional now as it was when
Thales worked out the first geometrical theorems nearly 26 centuries
ago.</p>
<p>Nothing pertaining to humanity becomes us so well as mathematics.
There, and only there, do we touch the human mind at its peak.</p>
