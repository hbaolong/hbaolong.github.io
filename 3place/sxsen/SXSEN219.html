<h4 id="analytic-geometry">Analytic Geometry</h4>
<p>As Monge had been perhaps the first modern specialist in geometry in
general, so Julius Plu¨cker (1801 1868) became the first specialist in
analytic geometry in particular. His earliest publications in Gergonne’s
Annales in 1826 had been largely synthetic, but he inadvertently became
so embroiled in controversy with Poncelet that he forsook the camp of
the synthesists and became the most prolific of all analytic geometers.
Algebraic methods, he came to believe firmly, were much to be preferred
to the purely geometric approach of Poncelet and Steiner. That his name
survives in coordinate geometry in what is called Plu¨cker’s abridged
notation is a tribute to his influence, although, in this case, the
phrase does him more than justice. During the early nineteenth century,
a number of men, including Gergonne, had recognized that analytic
geometry was burdened by awkwardness in algebraic computation; hence,
they began to drastically abbreviate notations. The family of all
circles through the intersection of the two circles x2 1y2 1ax1by1c50
and x2 1y2 1aux1buy1cu 50, for instance, was written by Gabriel Lame´
(1795 1870) in 1818 simply as mC1muCu 50, using two parameters or
multipliers m and mu. Gergonne and Plu¨cker preferred a single Greek
multiplier, the former writing C1lCu 50, from which we have the word
“lambdalizing,” and the latter using C1μCu 50, resulting in the phrase
“Plu¨cker’s μ.” Lame´ seems to have been the initiator in the study in
analytic geometry of one-parameter families through abridged notation,
but it was Plu¨cker who, especially during the years 1827 1829, carried
this study furthest.</p>
<p>Among the many uses Plu¨cker made of abridged notation was one of
1828, in Gergonne’s Annales, in which he explained the Cramer-Euler
paradox. If, for example, one has fourteen random points in a plane, the
quartic curve through these points can be written as Q1μQu 50, where Q50
and Qu 50 are distinct quartics through the same thirteen of the
fourteen given points. Let μ be so determined that the coordinates of
the fourteenth point satisfy Q1μQu 50. Then, Q50, Qu 50, and Q1uQu 50
all have in common not only the original thirteen points, but also all
sixteen points of intersection of Q50 and Qu 50. Hence, with any set of
thirteen points there are three additional points dependent on, or
associated with, the original thirteen, and no set of fourteen or more
points selected from the combined set of sixteen dependent points will
determine a unique quartic curve, despite the fact that a random set of
fourteen points will in general uniquely determine a quartic curve. More
generally, any given set of</p>
<p>nðn13Þ</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>random points will determine a concomitant set of</p>
<p>n2 2ð Þ 215 ð Þð Þ n n13 n21 n22</p>
<p>2 2</p>
<p>additional “dependent” points such that any curve of degree n through
the given set of points will also pass through the dependent points. In
addition, Plu¨cker gave a dual of his theorem on the paradox, as well as
generalizations to surfaces in three dimensions.</p>
<p>It was Plu¨cker who, in the first volume of his
Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen (1828), elevated the abridged
notation of Lame´ and Gergonne to the status of a principle; in the
second volume of this influential work (1831), Plu¨cker effectively
rediscovered a new system of coordinates that had been independently
invented three times earlier. This was what we now call homogeneous
coordinates, of which Feuerbach was one inventor. Another discoverer was
A. F. Mo¨bius (1790 1860),
alsoastudentofGauss’s,whopublishedhisschemein1827inaworkwith the title
Der barycentrische Calcul. He introduced his “barycentric coordinates”
by considering a given triangle ABC and defining the coordinates of a
point P as the mass to be placed at A, B, and C so that P is the center
of gravity of these masses. Mo¨bius classified transformations according
to whether they were congruences (leaving corresponding figures equal),
similarities (corresponding figures similar), affine (corresponding
figures preserving parallel lines), or collineations (lines going into
lines) and suggested the study of invariants under each family of
transformations. The author of Der barycentrische Calcul is best known,
however, for the one-sided surface that bears his name—the Mo¨bius strip
or band obtained by joining the ends of a segment of ribbon after one
end has been turned upside down. Still another inventor of homogeneous
coordinates was E´tienne Bobillier (1798 1840), a graduate of the E´cole
Polytechnique who published his new coordinate system in Gergonne’s
Annales for 1827 1828.</p>
<p>The notations and patterns of reasoning of the four inventors of
homogeneous coordinates differed somewhat, but they all had one thing in
common—they made use of three coordinates, instead of two, to locate a
point in a plane. The systems were equivalent to what are also known as
trilinear coordinates. Plu¨cker, in fact, at first specifically took his
three coordinates x, y, and t of a point P in a plane to be the three
distances of P from the sides of a triangle of reference. Later, in
Volume II of his Analytisch-geometrische Entwicklungen, he gave the more
usual definition of homogeneous coordinates as any set of ordered number
triples (x, y, t) related to the Cartesian coordinates (X, Y) of P such
that x5Xt and y5Yt. It will immediately be apparent that the homogeneous
coordinates of a point P are not unique, for the triples (x, y, t) and
(kx, ky, kt) correspond to the same Cartesian pair (x/t, y/t). This lack
of uniqueness, however, causes no more difficulty than does the lack of
uniqueness in polar coordinates or the lack of uniqueness of form in the
case of equal fractions. The name “homogeneous” stems, of course, from
the fact that when one uses the equations of transformation to convert
the equation of a curve f(X, Y)50 in rectangular Cartesian coordinates
to the form f(x/t, y/t)50, the new equation will contain terms all of
the same degree in the variables x, y, and t. More important, it will be
noted that there is in the system of Cartesian coordinates no number
pair corresponding to a homogeneous plane number triple of the form (x,
y, 0). Such a triple (provided that x and y are not both zero)
designates an ideal point, or a “point at infinity.” At long last, the
infinite elements of Kepler, Desargues, and Poncelet had been tied down
to a coordinate system of ordinary numbers. Moreover, just as any
ordered triple of real numbers (not all zero) in homogeneous coordinates
corresponds to a point in a plane, so also does every linear equation
ax1by1ct50 (provided that a, b, and c are not all zero) correspond to a
straight line in the plane. In particular, all of the “points at
infinity” in the plane obviously lie on the line given by the equation
t50, known as the line at infinity or the ideal line in the plane. It is
obvious that this new system of coordinates is ideally suited to the
study of projective geometry, which up to this time had been approached
almost exclusively from the point of view of pure geometry.</p>
<p>Homogeneous coordinates were a big step in the direction of the
arithmetization of geometry, but in 1829, Plu¨cker contributed to
Crelle’s Journal a paper with a revolutionary point of view that broke
completely with the old Cartesian view of coordinates as line segments.
The equation of a straight line in homogeneous coordinates has the form
ax1by1ct50. The three coefficients of parameters (a, b, c) determine a
unique straight line in the plane, just as the three homogeneous
coordinates (x, y, t) correspond to a unique point in the plane.
Inasmuch as coordinates are numbers, hence not unlike coefficients,
Plu¨cker saw that one could modify the usual language and call (a, b, c)
the homogeneous coordinates of a line. If, finally, one reverses the
Cartesian convention so that letters at the beginning of the alphabet
designate variables and those near the end of the alphabet designate
constants, the equation ax1by1ct50 represents a pencil of lines through
the fixed point (x, y, t), rather than a pencil of points on the fixed
line (a, b, c). If, now, one considers the noncommittal equation
pu1qv1rw50, it is clear that one can consider this indifferently as the
totality of points (u, v, w) lying on the fixed line (p, q, r) or as the
totality of lines (p, q, r) through the fixed point (u, v, w).</p>
<p>Plu¨cker had discovered the immediate analytic counterpart of the
geometric principle of duality, about which Gergonne and Poncelet had
quarreled; it now became clear that the justification that pure geometry
had sought in vain was here supplied by the algebraic point of view. The
interchange of the words “point” and “line” merely corresponds to an
interchange of the words “constant” and “variable” with respect to the
quantities p,q, r andu, v,w. Fromthesymmetry ofthe algebraic situation,
it is clear that every theorem concerning pu1qv1rw50 immediately appears
in two forms, one the dual of the other. Moreover, Plu¨cker showed that
every curve (other than a straight line) can be regarded as having a
dual origin: It is a locus generated by a moving point and enveloped by
a moving line, the point moving continuously along the line while the
line continues to rotate about the point. Oddly enough, the degree of a
curve in point coordinates (the “order” of the curve) need not be the
same as the degree of the curve in line coordinates (the “class” of the
curve), and one of Plu¨cker’s great achievements, published in Crelle’s
Journal for1834,wasthediscoveryoffourequations,whichnowbearhisname,that
relate the class and the order of a curve with the singularities of the
curve:</p>
<p>m5nðn21Þ22δ23κ and n5mðm21Þ22τ23ι;</p>
<p>l53nðn22Þ26δ28κ and κ53mðm22Þ26τ28t;</p>
<p>where m is the class, n the order, δ the number of nodes, κ the
number of cusps, ι the number of stationary tangents (points of
inflection), and τ the number of bitangents. From these equations, it is
clear at a glance that a conic (of order two) can have no singularities
and thus must also be of class two.</p>
<p>In later papers and volumes, Plu¨cker extended his work to include
imaginary Cartesian and homogeneous coordinates. It was now a trivial
matter to justify Poncelet’s theorem that all circles have in common two
imaginary points at infinity, for the points (1, i, 0) and (i, 1, 0)
both satisfy the equation x2 1y2 1axt1byt1ct2 50, no matter what values
a, b, c may take on. Plu¨cker also showed that the foci of conics have
the property that the imaginary tangents from these points to the curve
pass through the above two circular points; he therefore defined a focus
of a higher plane curve as a point having this property.</p>
<p>During the days of Descartes and Fermat and again in the time of
Monge and Lagrange, France had been the center for the development of
analytic geometry, but with the work of Plu¨cker, leadership in the
field crossed the Rhine to Germany. Nevertheless, Plu¨cker was, to a
considerable extent, the proverbial prophet without honor in his own
country. There, Steiner, the champion of synthetic methods, was
inordinately admired. Mo¨bius remained neutral in the analysis-synthesis
controversy, but Jacobi, despite the fact that he himself was an
algorithm-builder, joined Steiner in polemically opposing Plu¨cker.
Discouraged, in 1847, Plu¨cker turned from geometry to physics, where he
published a series of papers on magnetism and spectroscopy.</p>
<p>One notes with surprise that Plu¨cker had not taken advantage of
developments in determinants, possibly because of his feud with Jacobi;
this may have been why he did not systematically develop an analytic
geometry of more than three dimensions. Plu¨cker had come close to this
notion through his observation in 1846 that the four parameters
determining a line in three-dimensional space can be thought of as four
coordinates, but only long afterward, in 1865, did he return to analytic
geometry and develop the idea of a “new geometry of space”—a
four-dimensional space in which straight lines, rather than points, were
the basic elements. Meanwhile, in 1843, Cayley had initiated the
ordinary analytic geometry of n-dimensional space, using determinants as
an essential tool. In this notation, using homogeneous coordinates, the
equations of the line and the plane, respectively, can be written as</p>
<p>x y z t</p>
<p>x y z t</p>
<p>x y t 50 and 50:</p>
<p>x1 y1 t1 132 132 231 1</p>
<p>x y z t2</p>
<p>x2 y2 t2</p>
<p>x y z t3</p>
<p>Cayleypointedoutthatthecorrespondingfundamental(n2l)-dimensional
element in n-dimensional space can be expressed in homogeneous
coordinates by a determinant, similar to those above, of order n11. Many
of the simple formulas for two and three dimensions, when properly
expressed, can easily be generalized to n dimensions. In 1846, Cayley
published a paper in Crelle’s Journal, in which he again extended some
theorems from three dimensions to a space of four dimensions; in 1847,
CauchypublishedanarticleintheComptesRendus,inwhichheconsidered
“analytical points” and “analytical lines” in space of more than three
dimensions.</p>
