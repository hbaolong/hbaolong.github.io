<h4 id="nicolas-bourbaki">Nicolas Bourbaki</h4>
<p>Mathematics of the twentieth century saw an emphasis on abstraction
and an increasing concern with the analysis of broad patterns. Perhaps
nowhere is this more clearly apparent than in the mid-twentieth-century
works that emanated from the polycephalic mathematician known as Nicolas
Bourbaki. This is a nonexistent Frenchman with a Greek name that has
appeared on the title pages of several dozen volumes in a continuing
major work, E´lements de math´ ematique´ , that was intended to survey
all of worthwhile mathematics. The home of Bourbaki is given as Nancy, a
city that provided a number of leading twentieth-century mathematicians.
In Nancy, there is a statue to the colorful and oncevery-real General
Charles Denis Sauter Bourbaki (1816 1897), who in 1862 was offered, but
declined, the throne of Greece and whose role in the Franco-Prussian War
was very tangible. Nicolas Bourbaki, nevertheless, is not a relative in
any sense of the word; the name was simply appropriated to designate a
group of anonymous mathematicians, almost exclusively French. As an
institutional connection, N. Bourbaki sometimes used the University of
Nancago, a playful reference to the fact that two of the moving spirits
within the group were for a while connected with universities in the
Chicago area—Andre Weil at the University of´ Chicago (later, however,
at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton) and Jean Dieudonne
(1906´ 1992) at Northwestern University (formerly at the University of
Nancy, later at the University of Paris).</p>
<p>Bourbaki originated as the result of conversations between Andre´
Weil and Henri Cartan in Strasbourg in 1934 concerning the need for new,
up-to-date textbooks; they were spurred to action by their frustration
at their students’ having to rely on Goursat’s Traite d’Analyse´ , and
they invited a group of other young mathematicians to join them in a
remedial project of writing a new analysis textbook. The original group,
holding regular meetings in a Paris cafe, consisted of Claude´ Chevalley
(1909 1984), Jean Dieudonne, Ren´ e de Possel (1905´ 1974) and Jean
Delsarte (1903 1968), in addition to Cartan and Weil. Also participating
were S. Mandelbrojt (1899 1983) and, for a shorter period, Paul Dubreil
(1904 1994) (replaced by Jean Coulomb) and Jean Leray (1906 1988)
(replaced by Charles Ehresmann (1905 1979). They rather quickly gave up
the original idea of a massive one-volume textbook and decided instead
on a series of self-contained, linearly ordered volumes. Each volume
would be characterized by strict adherence to an axiomatic approach, an
abstract form that brought out the structure of the underlying concepts,
and a progression from general to specific cases. Members chose and
discussed the topic for each volume; one person was chosen to act as
editor; members then reviewed the copy, with Dieudonne predominantly
acting as final reviser; and each volume´ was cleared for publication
after unanimous consent had been reached.</p>
<p>Nic ola s Bour b aki</p>
<p>It was hoped that the emphasis on structure and logical coherence
would effect a considerable economy of thought. In the early nineteenth
century, the discovery that the structure of the complex number system
was the same as that of points in the Euclidean plane showed that the
properties of the latter, studied for more than two millennia, could be
applied to the former. The result was an exuberant proliferation in
complex analysis. It seemed that twentieth-century concern for
similarities in structure should, in the years to come, yield similar
dividends.</p>
<p>Romantics in mathematics earlier in the century had feared a takeover
of their subject by an arid formalism encouraged by logicism. By the
middle of the century, the feud between formalists and intuitionists had
quieted, and the Bourbaki group saw no need to take sides in the
controversy. “What the axiomatic method sets as its essential aim,”
Bourbaki wrote, “is exactly that which logical formalism by itself
cannot supply, namely the profound intelligibility of mathematics.” In
the same vein, one of the leaders of the group wrote that “If logic is
the hygiene of the mathematician, it is not his source of food.”</p>
<p>The first volume of Bourbaki’s E´lements´ appeared in 1939. After the
end of World War II, parts of the first three books were still
incomplete and the last three had to be started. New members who joined
Bourbaki before 1950 included Roger Godemont, Pierre Samuel, Jacques
Dixmier, and Jean-Pierre Serre, and they were soon followed by Samuel
Eilenberg, Jean-Louis Koszul, and Laurent Schwartz. By 1958, most of
what is known as Part I, Les structures fondamentales de l’analyse, had
been completed. This part contains half a dozen subheadings or “books”:
(1) Set Theory, (2) Algebra, (3) General Topology,</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Functions of a Real Variable, (5) Topological Vector Spaces, and (6)
Integration. As the titles indicate, only a small portion of the
mathematics contained in these volumes was in existence a century
earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the time plans for the next volumes had to be firmed up, a “third
generation” joined the group. They included Armand Borel, Franc¸ois
Bruhat, Pierre Cartier, Alexander Grothendieck, Serge Lang, and John
Tate. They were faced with major challenges in determining the course
the project should now take. Should the original concept of the
selfcontained linear order be followed when so many new topics would
require preliminaries that might be decades in the making? Should the
existing first six volumes be rewritten and brought up to date? Should
the volumes covering the newest research results in mathematics still be
treated as textbooks? Should all members of the group be expected to be
sufficiently knowledgeable in each topic to participate in the
decision-making process for that volume?</p>
<p>After a variety of proposals, substantial arguments, and considerable
debate—an activity that had always characterized the meetings of the
group—by 1984, Bourbaki had produced a certain amount of new material.
As before, chapters of the individual books were not always completed in
the planned, eventual order. There were two “summary” chapters on
differential and analytic manifolds, designed to serve as
acompromiseforhavingtogiveuptherigorouslinearorderforthesetopics; seven
chapters on commutative algebra; eight chapters on Lie groups and Lie
algebras; and two chapters on spectral theories. In addition, there was
now an English translation of some of the first six books, of three of
the chapters on Lie groups and algebras, and of the chapters on
commutative algebra. Fifty years after the first cafe gatherings in
Paris, the future of´
