<h4 id="values-of-pi">Values of Pi</h4>
<p>The earliest Chinese mathematics is so different from that of
comparable periods in other parts of the world that the assumption of
independent development would appear to be justified. At all events, it
seems safe to say that if there was some intercommunication before 400
CE, then more mathematics came out of China than went in. For later
periods, the question becomes more difficult. The use of the value 3 for
π in early Chinese mathematics is scarcely an argument for dependence on
Mesopotamia, especially since the search for more accurate values, from
the first centuries of the Christian era, was more persistent in China
thanp elsewhere. Values such as 3.1547, 10, 92/29, and 142/45 are found,
and in the third century Liu Hui, an important commentator on the Nine
Chapters, derived the figure 3.14 by use of a regular polygon of 96
sides and the approximation 3.14159 by considering a polygon of 3,072
sides. In Liu Hui’s reworking of the Nine Chapters, there are many
problems in mensuration, including the correct determination of the
volume of a frustum of a square pyramid. For a frustum of a</p>
<p>Value s of P i</p>
<p>circular cone, a similar formula was applied, but with a value of 3
for π. Unusual is the rule that the volume of a tetrahedron with two
opposite edges perpendicular to each other is one-sixth the product of
these two edges and their common perpendicular. The method of false
position is used in solving linear equations, but there are also more
sophisticated results, such as the solution, through a matrix pattern,
of a Diophantine problem involving four equations in five unknown
quantities. The approximate solution of equations of higher degree seems
to have been carried out by a device similar to what we know as
“Horner’s method.” Liu Hui also included, in his work on the Nine
Chapters, numerous problems involving inaccessible towers and trees on
hillsides.</p>
<p>The Chinese fascination with the value of π reached its high point in
the work of Zu Chongzhi (Tsu Ch’ung-chih) (430 501). One of his values
was the familiar Archimedean 22/7, described by Zu Chongzhi as
“inexact”; his “accurate” value was 355/113. If one persists in seeking
possible Western influence, one can explain away this remarkably good
approximation, not equaled anywhere until the fifteenth century, by
subtracting the numerator and the denominator, respectively, of the
Archimedean value from the numerator and the denominator of the
Ptolemaic value 377/120. Yet, Zu Chongzhi went even further in his
calculations, for he gave 3.1415927 as an “excess” value and 3.1415926
as a “deficit value.” The calculations by which he arrived at these
bounds, apparently aided by his son Zu Chengzhi, were probably contained
in one of his books, since lost. In any case, his results were
remarkable for that age, and it is fitting that today a landmark on the
moon bears his name.</p>
<p>The work of Liu Hui and Zu Chongzhi represents a greater interest in
theory and proofs than known examples of earlier mathematical activity
in China; the example of the computation of π may obscure this fact
because accuracy in the value of π is more a matter of computational
stamina than of theoretical insight. The Pythagorean theorem alone
suffices to give as accurate an approximation as may be desired.
Starting with the known perimeter of a regular polygon of n sides
inscribed in a circle, the perimeter of the inscribed regular polygon of
2π sides can be calculated by two applications of the Pythagorean
theorem. Let C be a circle with center O and radius r (Fig. 9.1), and
let PQ5s be a side of a regular inscribed polygon of n sides having a
known perimeter. Then, MR5v5r2u is known. Then, the sidepRQ2 5ðw 2of the
inscribed regularÞ2 2 the apothem OM5u is given by u5 r 2 s=2 ; hence,
the sagitta perimeter of this polygon is known. The calculation, as Liu
Hui saw, canp ð Þ polygon of 2n sides is found from w5 v 1 s=2 ; hence,
the</p>
<p>be shortened by noting that w2 52rv. An iteration of the procedure
will result in an ever closer approximation to the perimeter of the
circle, in terms of which π is defined.</p>
<p>From the sixth to the tenth century, a group of a dozen “classics,”
covering topics in arithmetic and number theory, served as a foundation
for mathematics taught in the “School for the Sons of the State.” These
works included the early Zhoubi and Nine Chapters, as well as later,
largely derivative, textbooks such as works by Liu Hui and others. The
group of a dozen books covered topics in arithmetic and the theory of
numbers, right triangles, the computation of irregular areas and
volumes, and more.</p>
<p>Between the tenth and the thirteenth centuries, we know of no new
Chinese mathematical breakthroughs, although some major technological
innovations such as paper and the mariner’s compass appeared at this
time. Generally, we may note that Chinese mathematical problems often
appear to be more picturesque than practical, yet Chinese civilization
was responsible for a substantial number of other technological
innovations. The use of printing and gunpowder (eighth century) was
earlier in China than elsewhere and earlier also than the high-water
mark in Chinese mathematics that occurred in the thirteenth century,
during the latter part of the Sung period.</p>
