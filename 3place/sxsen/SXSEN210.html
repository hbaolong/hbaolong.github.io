<h4 id="nineteenth-century-overview">Nineteenth-Century Overview</h4>
<p>The nineteenth century deserves to be known as the Golden Age in
mathematics. The additions to the subject during these one hundred years
far outweigh the total combined productivity of all preceding ages. The
century was also one of the most revolutionary in the history of
mathematics. The introduction into the mathematician’s repertoire of
concepts such as non-Euclidean geometries, n-dimensional spaces,
noncommutative algebras, infinite processes, and nonquantitative
structures all contributed to a radical transformation that changed the
appearance, as well as the definitions, of mathematics.</p>
<p>The geographic distribution of mathematical activity also began to
change. Hitherto, each major period of history seemed to be
characterized by specific geographic clusters where most advances in
mathematics took place. During the first half of the nineteenth century,
the</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>Gaus s: E ar l y Wor k</p>
<p>center of mathematical activity became diffused. Nevertheless,
several decades passed before there were institutions that could boast
the mathematical strength of the French, epitomized by the E´cole
Polytechnique. Most countries supported mathematical efforts directed
toward surveying, navigation, or other areas of application. Support for
research in pure mathematics—in time or money—was the exception, rather
than the rule. This is illustrated in the career of the greatest
mathematician of the time, who was German.</p>
<p>Gauss: EarlyWork</p>
<p>Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777 1855) enjoyed numerical computation as a
child; an anecdote that is told of his early schooling is
characteristic. One day, in order to keep the class occupied, the
teacher had the students add up all of the numbers from 1 to 100, with
instructions that each child should place his slate on a table as soon
as he had completed the task. Almost immediately, Carl placed his slate
on the table, saying, “There it is.” When the instructor finally looked
at the results, Gauss’s slate was the only one to have the correct
answer, 5050, with no further calculation. Evidently, the ten-year-old
boy had mentally computed the sum of the arithmetic progression
1121311991100, presumably through the formula m(m11)/2. His teachers
soon called Gauss’s talent to the attention of the Duke of Brunswick,
who supported his education, which first enabled him to study at the
local college, then at the University in Go¨ttingen, where he
matriculated in October 1795.</p>
<p>The following March, still a month short of being nineteen years old,
Gauss made a brilliant discovery. For more than 2,000 years, men had
known how to construct, with compasses and straightedge, the equilateral
triangle and the regular pentagon (as well as certain other regular
polygons, the numbers of whose sides are multiples of two, three, and
five), but no other polygon with a prime number of sides. Gauss showed
that the regular polygon of seventeen sides could also be constructed
with compasses and straightedge.</p>
<p>Gauss commemorated his discovery by starting a diary in which, for
the next eighteen years, he noted many of his discoveries. He obtained
numerous results while still a student. Some were rediscoveries of
theorems established by Euler, Lagrange, and other eighteenth-century
mathematicians; many were new. Among the more significant discoveries of
his student days, we may single out the method of least squares, the
proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity in number theory, and his work
on the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.</p>
<p>He earned his doctorate with a thesis titled “New Demonstration of
the Theorem That Every Rational Integral Algebraic Function in One</p>
<p>Facsimile of a page in the famous diary of Gauss</p>
<p>Variable Can Be Resolved into Real Factors of First or Second
Degree.” In this, the first of four proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra that he published during his life, Gauss stressed the importance
of demonstrating the existence of at least one root in proving the
theorem in question.</p>
<p>Gauss presented this doctoral thesis to the University of Helmstedt,
which had on its faculty Johann Friedrich Pfaff (1765 1825), who, next
to Gauss, was widely regarded as the ranking German mathematician of his
time. Today he is best known for an 1813 memoir on the integration of
systems of differential equations. On leaving Go¨ttingen in 1798, he
returned to his native Brunswick, where he spent the next nine years
enjoying the continued support of the duke, waited for a suitable job,
got married, and made some of his major discoveries.</p>
