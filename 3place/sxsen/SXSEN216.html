<h4 id="the-school-of-monge">The School of Monge</h4>
<p>Geometry, of all of the branches of mathematics, has been most
subject to changing tastes from age to age. In classical Greece, it had
climbed to the zenith, only to fall to its nadir at about the time that
Rome fell. It recovered some lost ground under Islam and in Renaissance
Europe; in the seventeenth century, it stood on the threshold of a new
era, only to be all but forgotten, at least by research mathematicians,
for nearly two more centuries, languishing in the shade of the
ever-proliferating branches of analysis. Britain, especially during the
later eighteenth century, fought a losing battle to restore Euclid’s
Elements to its once glorious position, but the British had done little
to advance research in the subject. Through the efforts of Monge and
Carnot, there were some stirrings of revival in pure geometry during the
period of the French Revolution, but the almost explosive rediscovery of
geometry as a living branch of mathematics came</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>chiefly with the dawn of the nineteenth century. As one might have
anticipated, Monge’s students at the E´cole Polytechnique made
significant contributions to the new geometric movement. Reflecting the
multiple nature of their teacher’s research, some pursued geometric
applications to engineering, some to pedagogy, some to physics; many
studied the subject for its own sake. Thus, Charles Dupin (1784 1873)
applied his geometric knowledge primarily to problems of naval
architecture and established technical training courses at the
Conservatoire des Arts et Me´tiers. Still, he is best remembered among
geometers for contributions to the theory of surfaces, where he
introduced concepts such as that of the cyclide, the surface enveloped
by all spheres tangent to a given set of spheres. Theodore Olivier (1793
1853) went beyond Monge in creating geometric models to develop powers
of visualization of geometric concepts; this work began the building of
geometric model collections, heavily promoted by the end of the century
through the pedagogic influence of Felix Klein (1849 1925).
Jean-Baptiste Biot (1774 1862), though primarily remembered as a
physicist, in his lectures passed on Monge’s emphasis on geometric
visualization of physical and mathematical problems. Charles Jules
Brianchon (1785 1864) is best known today for one theorem, which he
discovered only a year after his entrance at the E´cole Polytechnique,
where he studied under Monge and read Carnot’s Ge´ome´trie de position.
The twenty-one-year-old student, later an artillery officer and a
teacher, first reestablished the long-forgotten theorem of Pascal, which
Brianchon expressed in the modern form: In any hexagon inscribed in a
conic section, the three points of intersection of the opposite sides
always lie on a straight line. Continuing through some other
demonstrations, he came to the one that bears his name: “In any hexagon
circumscribed about a conic section, the three diagonals cross each
other in the same point.” As Pascal had been impressed by the number of
corollaries that he had been able to derive from his theorem, so
Brianchon remarked that his own theorem “is pregnant with curious
consequences.” The theorems of Pascal and Brianchon are, in fact,
fundamental in the projective study of conics. They form, in addition,
the first clear-cut instance of a pair of significant “dual” theorems in
geometry, that is, theorems that remain valid (in plane geometry) if the
words “point” and “line” are interchanged. If we let the phrase “a line
is tangent to a conic” be read as “a line is on a conic,” the two
theorems can be expressed in the following combined form:</p>
<p>vertices</p>
<p>The sixof a hexagon lie on a conic if</p>
<p>sides points</p>
<p>and only if the threecommon to the three pairs of</p>
<p>lines</p>
<p>oppositehave a in common: sides line</p>
<p>vertices point</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>P r oje c t i v e Ge ome tr y: Ponc ele t and C ha sle s</p>
<p>Projective Geometry: Poncelet and Chasles</p>
<p>Relationships between points and lines on conics were also
efficaciously exploited by another alumnus of the E´cole Polytechnique,
the man who became the effective founder of projective geometry. This
was JeanVictor Poncelet (1788 1867), who also studied under Monge.
Poncelet entered the army corps of engineers just in time to take part
in Napoleon’s ill-fated 1812 campaign in Russia and be taken prisoner.
While in prison, Poncelet composed a treatise on analytic geometry,
Applications d’analyse et de ge´ome´trie, which was based on the
principles he had learned at the E´cole Polytechnique. This work,
however, was not published until about half a century later (2 vols.,
1862 1864), despite the fact that it was originally intended to serve as
an introduction to the author’s far more celebrated Traite´ des
proprie´te´s projectives des figures of 1822. The latter work differed
sharply from the former, in that it was synthetic, rather than analytic,
in style. Poncelet’s tastes had changed on his return to Paris, and from
that time on, he was a staunch advocate of synthetic methods. He
realized that the apparent advantage of analytic geometry lay in its
generality, and he therefore sought to make statements in synthetic
geometry as general as possible. To further this design, he formulated
what he called the “principle of continuity” or “the principle of
permanence of mathematical relations.” This he described as follows:</p>
<p>The metric properties discovered for a primitive figure remain
applicable, without other modifications than those of change of sign, to
all correlative figures which can be considered to spring from the
first.</p>
<p>As an example of the principle, Poncelet cited the theorem of the
equality of the products of the segments of intersecting chords in a
circle, which becomes, when the point of intersection lies outside the
circle, an equality of the products of the segments of secants. If one
of the lines is tangent to the circle, the theorem nevertheless remains
valid on replacing the product of the segments of the secant with the
square of the tangent. Cauchy was inclined to scoff at Poncelet’s
principle of continuity, for it appeared to him to be nothing more than
a bold induction. In a sense, this principle is not unlike the view of
Carnot, but Poncelet carried it further to include the points at
infinity that Kepler and Desargues had suggested. Thus, one could say of
two straight lines that they always intersected— either in an ordinary
point or (in the case of parallel lines) in a point at infinity, called
an ideal point. In order to achieve the generality of analysis, Poncelet
found it necessary to introduce into synthetic geometry not only ideal
points but also imaginary points, for only thus could he say that a
circle and a straight line always intersect. Among his striking
discoveries was that all circles whatsoever, drawn in a plane, have two
points in common. These are two ideal imaginary points, known as the
circular points at infinity and usually designated as I and J (or, more
informally, as Isaac and Jacob).</p>
<p>Poncelet argued that his principle of continuity, which presumably
had been suggested by analytic geometry, was properly a development of
synthetic geometry, and he quickly became a champion of the latter
against the analysts. During the second half of the eighteenth century,
there had been some controversy, especially in Germany, about the
relative merits of analysis and synthesis. During the early nineteenth
century, interest in the rival methodologies in France was such that a
prize was offered in 1813 by the Bordeaux Scientific Society for the
best essay characterizing synthesis and analysis and the influence that
each had exerted. The winning essay, by a teacher at Versailles, closed
with the hope that there might be a reconciliation between the two
camps, but half a dozen years later, the controversy broke out again and
became increasingly bitter.</p>
<p>The history of geometry in the nineteenth century is replete with
cases of independent discovery and rediscovery. One example is that of
the nine-point circle. Poncelet and Brianchon published a joint paper in
Gergonne’s Annales for 1820 1821, which, though titled “Recherches sur
la de´termination d’une hyperbole e´quilate`re,” contained a proof of
the beautiful theorem that</p>
<p>The circle which passes through the feet of the perpendiculars,
dropped from the vertices of any triangle on the sides opposite to them,
passes also through the midpoints of these sides as well as through the
midpoints of the segments which join the vertices to the point of
intersection of the perpendiculars.</p>
<p>This theorem is generally named for neither Brianchon nor Poncelet,
but for an independent German mathematician, Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach
(1800 1834), who published it in 1822. The little monograph containing
this and some related propositions also included proofs of several
fascinating properties of the circle. Among these is the fact that the
center of the nine-point circle lies on the Euler line and is midway
between the orthocenter and the circumcenter, and “Feuerbach’s theorem”
that the nine-point circle of any triangle is tangent internally to the
inscribed circle and tangent externally to the three escribed circles.
One enthusiast, the American geometer Julian Lowell Coolidge (1873
1954), called this “the most beautiful theorem in elementary geometry
that has been discovered since the time of Euclid.” It should be noted
that the charm of such theorems supported considerable investigation in
the geometry of triangles and circles during the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Returning to Poncelet, let us note that we remember him primarily for
his using existing Desarguesian concepts of central (point)
projections</p>
<p>S y nt he t ic Me tr ic Ge om e tr y: St einer</p>
<p>and points of infinity to establish the notion of the complex
projective plane. Basic is the study of projective properties defined as
those remaining invariant under perspectivities. Given a point O and a
line l in the plane, a perspectivity assigns to each point P a point Pu
on l such that if Q is a second point, there exists a point Qu on OQ
such that PQ intersects PuQu on l. A sequence of perspectivities is
called a projectivity. Again, calling on an approach used by Desargues,
Poncelet brought to the fore the Apollonian concepts of pole and polar
to which, as we have noted, he attributed his discovery of the principle
of duality.</p>
<p>The work of Poncelet was continued by Michel Chasles (1798 1880),
also a graduate of the E´cole Polytechnique, where he became professor
of machine technology in 1841; beginning in 1846, he held a chair for
higher geometry at the Sorbonne. To Chasles was due the emphasis in
projective geometry on the six cross ratios, or anharmonic ratios,
(c2a)/(c2b): (d2a)/(d2b) of four collinear points or four concurrent
lines, and the invariance of these under projective transformations. His
Traite´ de ge´ome´trie supe´rieure (1852) was influential as well in
establishing the use of directed line segments in pure geometry.
Chasles, who is also noted for his Aperc¸u historique sur l’origine et
la de´ve´loppement des me´thodes en ge´ome´trie (1837), was one of the
last great projective geometers in France. Late in life, he initiated
the study of enumerative geometry, that branch of algebraic geometry
whose task it is to determine the number of solutions of algebraic
problems by means of geometric interpretation. Here and elsewhere, he
made prominent use of the “principle of correspondence.”</p>
