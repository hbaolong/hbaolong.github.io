<h4 id="why-are-flowers-beautiful">14 Why are Flowers Beautiful?</h4>
<p>My daughter Juliet, then aged six . . . pointed out some flowers by
the wayside. I asked her what she thought wildflowers were for. She gave
a rather thoughtful answer. ‘Two things,’ she said. ‘To make the world
pretty, and to help the bees make honey for us.’ I was touched by this
and sorry I had to tell her that it wasn’t true.</p>
<p>Richard Dawkins, Climbing Mount Improbable (1996)</p>
<p>‘Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one
phrase and the structure would fall.’ That is how Mozart’s music is
described in Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play Amadeus. This is reminiscent of
the remark by John Archibald Wheeler with which this book begins,
speaking of a hoped-for unified theory of fundamental physics: ‘an idea
so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it . . . how could it have
been otherwise?’</p>
<p>Shaffer and Wheeler were describing the same attribute: being hard to
vary while still doing the job. In the first case it is an attribute of
aesthetically good music, and in the second of good scientific
explanations. And Wheeler speaks of the scientific theory as being
beautiful in the same breath as describing it as hard to vary.</p>
<p>Scientific theories are hard to vary because they correspond closely
with an objective truth, which is independent of our culture, our
personal preferences and our biological make-up. But what made Peter
Shaffer think that Mozart’s music is hard to vary? The prevailing view
among both artists and non-artists is, I think, that there is nothing
objective about artistic standards. Beauty, says the adage, is in the
eye of the beholder. The very phrase ‘It’s a matter of taste’ is used
interchangeably with ‘There is no objective truth of the matter.’
Artistic standards are, in this view, nothing more than artefacts of
fashion and other cultural accidents, or of individual whim, or of
biological predisposition. Many are willing to concede that in science
and mathematics one idea can be objectively truer than another (though,
as we have seen, some deny even that), but most insist that there is no
such thing as one object being objectively more beautiful than another.
Mathematics has its proofs (so the argument goes), and science has its
experimental tests; but if you choose to believe that Mozart was an
inept and cacophonous composer then neither logic nor experiment nor
anything else objective will ever contradict you.</p>
<p>However, it would be a mistake to dismiss the possibility of
objective beauty for that sort of reason, for it is none other than the
relic of empiricism that I discussed in Chapter 9 – the assertion that
philosophical knowledge in general cannot exist. It is true that, just
as one cannot deduce moral maxims from scientific theories, likewise nor
can one deduce aesthetic values. But that would not prevent aesthetic
truths from being linked to physical facts through explanations, as
moral ones are. Wheeler was very nearly asserting such a link in that
quotation.</p>
<p>Facts can be used to criticize aesthetic theories, as they can moral
theories. For instance, there is the criticism that, since most arts
depend on parochial properties of human senses (such as which range of
colours and sounds they can detect), they cannot be attaining anything
objective. Extraterrestrial people whose senses detected radio waves but
not light or sound would have art that was inaccessible to us, and vice
versa. And the reply to that criticism might be, first, that perhaps our
arts are merely scratching the surface of what is possible: they are
indeed parochial, but they are a first approximation to something
universal. Or, second, that deaf composers on Earth have composed, and
appreciated, great music; why could deaf extraterrestrials (or humans
who were born deaf) not learn to do the same – if by no other means than
by downloading a set of deaf-composer aesthetics into their brains? Or,
third, what is the difference between using radio telescopes to
understand the physics of quasars and using prosthetic senses (wired
into the brain to create new qualia) to appreciate extraterrestrial
art?</p>
<p>Experience may also provide artistic problems. Our ancestors had eyes
and paint, which may have led them to wonder how paint could be used in
a way that would look more beautiful.</p>
<p>Just as Bronowski pointed out that scientific discovery depends on a
commitment to certain moral values, might it not also entail the
appreciation of certain forms of beauty? It is a fact – often mentioned
but seldom explained – that deep truth is often beautiful.
Mathematicians and theoretical scientists call this form of beauty
‘elegance’. Elegance is the beauty in explanations. It is by no means
synonymous with how good, or how true, an explanation is. The poet John
Keats’ assertion (which I think was ironic) that ‘Beauty is truth, truth
beauty’ is refuted by what the evolutionist Thomas Huxley called ‘the
great tragedy of Science – the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an
ugly fact – which is so constantly being enacted under the eyes of
philosophers’. (By ‘philosophers’ he meant ‘scientists’.) I think
Huxley, too was being ironic in calling this process a great tragedy,
especially since he was referring to the refutation of
spontaneous-generation theories. But it is true that some important
mathematical proofs, and some scientific theories, are far from elegant.
Yet the truth so often is elegant that elegance is, at least, a useful
heuristic when searching for fundamental truths. And when a ‘beautiful
hypothesis’ is slain, it is more often than not replaced, as the
spontaneous-generation theory was, by a more beautiful one. Surely this
is not coincidence: it is a regularity in nature. So it must have an
explanation.</p>
<p>The processes of science and art can look rather different: a new
artistic creation rarely proves an old one wrong; artists rarely look at
a scene through microscopes, or understand a sculpture through
equations. Yet scientific and artistic creation do sometimes look
remarkably alike. Richard Feynman once remarked that the only equipment
a theoretical physicist needs is a stack of paper, a pencil and a
waste-paper basket, and some artists, when they are at work, closely
resemble that picture. Before the invention of the typewriter, novelists
used exactly the same equipment.</p>
<p>Composers like Ludwig van Beethoven agonized through change after
change, apparently seeking something that they knew was there to be
created, apparently meeting a standard that could be met only after much
creative effort and much failure. Scientists often do the same. In both
science and art there are the exceptional creators like Mozart or the
mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan, who reputedly made brilliant
contributions without any such effort. But from what we know of
knowledge-creation we have to conclude that in such cases the effort,
and the mistakes, did happen, invisibly, inside their brains.</p>
<p>Are these resemblances only superficial? Was Beethoven fooling
himself when he thought that the sheets in his waste-paper basket
contained mistakes: that they were worse than the sheets he would
eventually publish? Was he merely meeting the arbitrary standards of his
culture, like the twentieth-century women who carefully adjusted their
hemlines each year to conform to the latest fashions? Or is there a real
meaning to saying that the music of Beethoven and Mozart was as far
above that of their Stone Age ancestors banging mammoth bones together
as Ramanujan’s mathematics was above tally marks?</p>
<p>Is it an illusion that the criteria that Beethoven and Mozart were
trying to meet were better too? Or is there no such thing as better? Is
there only ‘I know what I like,’ or what tradition or authority
designates as good? Or what our genes predispose us to like? The
psychologist Shigeru Watanabe has found that sparrows prefer harmonious
to discordant music. Is that all that human artistic appreciation
is?</p>
<p>All these theories assume – with little or no argument – that for
each logically possible aesthetic standard there could exist, say, a
culture in which people would enjoy and be deeply moved by art that met
that standard. Or that a genetic predisposition could exist with the
same properties. But is it not much more plausible that only very
exceptional aesthetic standards could possibly end up as the norm of any
culture, or be the objective towards which some great artist, creating a
new artistic style, spent a lifetime working? Quite generally, cultural
relativism (about art or morality) has a very hard time explaining what
people are doing when they think they are improving a tradition.</p>
<p>Then there is the equivalent of instrumentalism: is art no more than
a means to non-artistic ends? For instance, artistic creations can
deliver information – a painting can depict something, and a piece of
music can represent an emotion. But their beauty is not primarily in
that content. It is in the form. For instance, here is a boring
picture:</p>
<p>and here is another picture with much the same content:</p>
<p>yet with greater aesthetic value. One can see that someone thought
about the second picture. In its composition, framing, cropping,
lighting, focus – it has the appearance of design by the photographer.
But design for what? Unlike Paley’s watch, it does not seem to have a
function – it only seems to be more beautiful than the first picture.
But what does that mean?</p>
<p>One possible instrumental purpose of beauty is attraction. A
beautiful object can be attractive to people who appreciate the beauty.
Attractiveness (to a given audience) can be functional, and is a
down-to-earth, scientifically measurable quantity. Art can be literally
attractive in the sense of causing people to move towards it. Visitors
to an art gallery can see a painting and be reluctant to leave, and then
later be caused, by the painting, to return to it. People may travel
great distances to hear a musical performance – and so on. If you see a
work of art that you appreciate, that means that you want to dwell on
it, to give it your attention, in order to appreciate more in it. If you
are an artist, and halfway through creating a work of art you see
something in it that you want to bring out, then you are being attracted
by a beauty that you have not yet experienced. You are being attracted
by the idea of a piece of art before you have created it.</p>
<p>Not all attractiveness has anything to do with aesthetics. You lose
your balance and fall off a log because we are all attracted to the
planet Earth. That may seem merely a play on the word ‘attraction’: our
attraction to the Earth is due not to aesthetic appreciation but to a
law of physics, which affects artists no more than it does aardvarks. A
red traffic light may induce us to stop and stare at it so long as it
remains red. But that is not artistic appreciation either, even though
it is attraction. It is mechanical.</p>
<p>But, when analysed in sufficient detail, everything is mechanical.
The laws of physics are sovereign. So, can one draw the conclusion that
beauty cannot have an objective meaning other than ‘that which we are
attracted to by processes in our brains and hence by the laws of
physics’? One cannot, because by that argument the physical world would
not exist objectively either, since the laws of physics also determine
what a scientist or mathematician wants to call true. Yet one cannot
explain what a mathematician does – or what Hofstadter’s dominoes do –
without referring to the objective truths of mathematics.</p>
<p>New art is unpredictable, like new scientific discoveries. Is that
the unpredictability of randomness, or the deeper unknowability of
knowledge-creation? In other words, is art truly creative, like science
and mathematics? That question is usually asked the other way round,
because the idea of creativity is still rather confused by various
misconceptions. Empiricism miscasts science as an automatic,
non-creative process. And art, though acknowledged as ‘creative’, has
often been seen as the antithesis of science, and hence irrational,
random, inexplicable – and hence unjudgeable, and non-objective. But if
beauty is objective, then a new work of art, like a newly discovered law
of nature or mathematical theorem, adds something irreducibly new to the
world.</p>
<p>We stare at the red traffic light because doing so will allow us to
continue our journey with the least possible delay. An animal can be
attracted towards another animal in order to mate with it, or to eat it.
Once the predator has taken a bite, it is attracted to take another –
unless the bite tastes bad, in which case it will be repelled. So there
we have a literal matter of taste. And that matter of taste is indeed
caused by the laws of physics in the form of the laws of chemistry and
biochemistry. We can guess that there is no higher-level explanation of
the resulting behaviour than the zoological level, because the behaviour
is predictable. It is repetitive, and where it is not repetitive it is
random.</p>
<p>Art does not consist of repetition. But in human tastes there can be
genuine novelty. Because we are universal explainers, we are not simply
obeying our genes. For instance, humans often act in ways that are
contrary to any preferences that might plausibly have been built into
our genes. People fast – sometimes for aesthetic reasons. Some abstain
from sex. People act in very diverse ways for religious reasons or for
any number of other reasons, philosophical or scientific, practical or
whimsical. We have an inborn aversion to heights and to falling, yet
people go skydiving – not in spite of this feeling, but because of it.
It is that very feeling of inborn aversion that humans can reinterpret
into a larger picture which to them is attractive – they want more of
it; they want to appreciate it more deeply. To a skydiver, the vista
from which we were born to recoil is beautiful. The whole activity of
skydiving is beautiful, and part of that beauty is in the very
sensations that evolved to deter us from trying it. The conclusion is
inescapable: that attraction is not inborn, just as the contents of a
newly discovered law of physics or mathematical theorem are not
inborn.</p>
<p>Could it be purely cultural? We pursue beauty as well as truth, and
in both cases we can be fooled. Perhaps we see a face as beautiful
because it really is, or perhaps it is only because of a combination of
our genes and our culture. A beetle is attracted to another beetle that
you and I may see as hideous. But not if you are an entomologist. People
can learn to see many things as beautiful or ugly. But, there again,
people can also learn to see false scientific theories as true, and true
ones as false, yet there is such a thing as objective scientific truth.
So that still does not tell us whether there is such a thing as
objective beauty.</p>
<p>Now, why is a flower the shape that it is? Because the relevant genes
evolved to make it attractive to insects. Why would they do this?
Because when insects visit a flower they are dusted with pollen, which
they then deposit in other flowers of the same species, and so the genes
in the DNA in that pollen are spread far and wide. This is the
reproductive mechanism that flowering plants evolved and which most
still use today: before there were insects, there were no flowers on
Earth. But the mechanism could work only because insects, at the same
time, evolved genes that attracted them to flowers. Why did they?
Because flowers provide nectar, which is food. Just as there is
co-evolution between the genes to coordinate mating behaviours in males
and females of the same species, so genes for making flowers and giving
them their shapes and colours co-evolved with genes in insects for
recognizing flowers with the best nectar.</p>
<p>During that biological co-evolution, just as in the history of art,
criteria evolved, and means of meeting those criteria co-evolved with
them. That is what gave flowers the knowledge of how to attract insects,
and insects the knowledge of how to recognize those flowers and the
propensity to fly towards them. But what is surprising is that these
same flowers also attract humans.</p>
<p>This is so familiar a fact that it is hard to see how amazing it is.
But think of all the countless hideous animals in nature, and think also
that all of them who find their mates by sight have evolved to find that
appearance attractive. And therefore it is not surprising that we do
not. With predators and prey there is a similar co-evolution, but in a
competitive sense rather than a cooperative one: each has genes that
evolved to enable it to recognize the other and to make it run towards
or away from it respectively, while other genes evolve to make their
organism hard to recognize against the relevant background. That is why
tigers are striped.</p>
<p>Occasionally it happens by chance that the parochial criteria of
attractiveness that evolved within a species produce something that
looks beautiful to us: the peacock’s tail is an example. But that is a
rare anomaly: in the overwhelming majority of species, we do not share
any of their criteria for finding something attractive. Yet with flowers
– most flowers – we do. Sometimes a leaf can be beautiful; even a puddle
of water can. But, again, only by rare chance. With flowers it is
reliable.</p>
<p>It is another regularity in nature. What is the explanation? Why are
flowers beautiful?</p>
<p>Given the prevailing assumptions in the scientific community – which
are still rather empiricist and reductionist – it may seem plausible
that flowers are not objectively beautiful, and that their
attractiveness is merely a cultural phenomenon. But I think that that
fails closer inspection. We find flowers beautiful that we have never
seen before, and which have not been known to our culture before – and
quite reliably, for most humans in most cultures. The same is not true
of the roots of plants, or the leaves. Why only the flowers?</p>
<p>One unusual aspect of the flower–insect co-evolution is that it
involved the creation of a complex code, or language, for signalling
information between species. It had to be complex because the genes were
facing a difficult communication problem. The code had to be, on the one
hand, easily recognizable by the right insects, and, on the other,
difficult to forge by other species of flower – for if other species
could cause their pollen to be spread by the same insects without having
to manufacture nectar for them, which requires energy, they would have a
selective advantage. So the criterion that was evolving in the insects
had to be discriminating enough to pick the right flowers and not crude
imitations; and the flowers’ design had to be such that no design that
other flower species could easily evolve could be mistaken for it. Thus
both the criterion and the means of meeting it had to be hard to
vary.</p>
<p>When genes are facing a similar problem within a species, notably in
the co-evolution of criteria and characteristics for choosing mates,
they already have a large amount of shared genetic knowledge to draw on.
For instance, even before any such co-evolution begins, the genome may
already contain adaptations for recognizing fellow members of the
species, and for detecting various attributes of them. Moreover, the
attributes that a mate is searching for may initially be objectively
useful ones – such as neck length in a giraffe. One theory of the
evolution of giraffe necks is that it began as an adaptation for
feeding, but then continued through sexual selection. However, there is
no such shared knowledge to build on across the gap between distant
species. They are starting from scratch.</p>
<p>And therefore my guess is that the easiest way to signal across such
a gap with hard-to-forge patterns designed to be recognized by
hard-to-emulate pattern-matching algorithms is to use objective
standards of beauty. So flowers have to create objective beauty, and
insects have to recognize objective beauty. Consequently the only
species that are attracted by flowers are the insect species that
co-evolved to do so – and humans.</p>
<p>If true, this means that Dawkins’ daughter was partly right about the
flowers after all. They are there to make the world pretty; or, at
least, prettiness is no accidental side effect but is what they
specifically evolved to have. Not because anything intended the world to
be pretty, but because the best-replicating genes depend on embodying
objective prettiness to get themselves replicated. The case of honey,
for instance, is very different. The reason that honey – which is sugar
water – is easy for flowers and bees to make, and why its taste is
attractive to humans and insects alike, is that we do all have a shared
genetic heritage going back to our common ancestor and before, which
includes biochemical knowledge about many uses of sugar, and the means
to recognize it.</p>
<p>Could it be that what humans find attractive in flowers – or in art –
is indeed objective, but it is not objective beauty? Perhaps it is
something more mundane – something like a liking for bright colours,
strong contrasts, symmetrical shapes. Humans seem to have an inborn
liking for symmetry. It is thought to be a factor in sexual
attractiveness, and it may also be useful in helping us to classify
things and to organize our environment physically and conceptually. So a
side effect of these inborn preferences might be a liking for flowers,
which happen to be colourful and symmetrical. However, some flowers are
white (at least to us – they may have colours that we cannot see and
insects can), but we still find their shapes beautiful. All flowers do
contrast with their background in some sense – that is a precondition
for being used for signalling – but a spider in the bath contrasts with
its background even more, and there is no widespread consensus that such
a sight is beautiful. As for symmetry: again, spiders are quite
symmetrical, while some flowers, such as orchids, are very
unsymmetrical, yet we do not find them any less attractive for that. So
I do not think that symmetry, colour and contrast are all that we are
seeing in flowers when we imagine that we are seeing beauty.</p>
<p>A sort of mirror image of that objection is that there are other
things in nature that we also find beautiful – things that are not
results of either human creativity or co-evolution across a gap: the
night sky; waterfalls; sunsets. So why not flowers too? But the cases
are not alike. Those things may be attractive to look at, but they have
no appearance of design. They are analogous not to Paley’s watch, but to
the sun as a timekeeper. One cannot explain why the watch is as it is
without referring to timekeeping, because it would be useless for
timekeeping if it had been made slightly differently. But, as I
mentioned, the sun would still be useful for keeping time even if the
solar system were altered. Similarly, Paley might have found a stone
that looked attractive. He might well have taken it home to use as an
ornamental paperweight. But he would not have sat down to write a
monograph about how changing any detail of the stone would have made it
incapable of serving that function, because that would not have been so.
The same is true of the night sky, waterfalls and almost all other
natural phenomena. But flowers do have the appearance of design for
beauty: if they looked like leaves, or roots, they would lose their
universal appeal. Displace even one petal, and there would be
diminishment.</p>
<p>We know what the watch was designed for, but we do not know what
beauty is. We are in a similar position to an archaeologist who finds
inscriptions in an unknown language in an ancient tomb: they look like
writing and not just meaningless marks on the walls. Conceivably this is
mistaken, but they look as though they were inscribed there for a
purpose. Flowers are like that: they have the appearance of having been
evolved for a purpose which we call ‘beauty’, which we can (imperfectly)
recognize, but whose nature is poorly understood.</p>
<p>In the light of these arguments I can see only one explanation for
the phenomenon of flowers being attractive to humans, and for the
various other fragments of evidence I have mentioned. It is that the
attribute we call beauty is of two kinds. One is a parochial kind of
attractiveness, local to a species, to a culture or to an individual.
The other is unrelated to any of those: it is universal, and as
objective as the laws of physics. Creating either kind of beauty
requires knowledge; but the second kind requires knowledge with
universal reach. It reaches all the way from the flower genome, with its
problem of competitive pollination, to human minds which appreciate the
resulting flowers as art. Not great art – human artists are far better,
as is to be expected. But with the hard-to-fake appearance of design for
beauty.</p>
<p>Now, why do humans appreciate objective beauty, if there has been no
equivalent of that co-evolution in our past? At one level the answer is
simply that we are universal explainers and can create knowledge about
anything. But still, why did we want to create aesthetic knowledge in
particular? It is because we did face the same problem as the flowers
and the insects. Signalling across the gap between two humans is
analogous to signalling across the gap between two entire species. A
human being, in terms of knowledge content and creative individuality,
is like a species. All the individuals of any other species have
virtually the same programming in their genes and use virtually the same
criteria for acting and being attracted. Humans are quite unlike that:
the amount of information in a human mind is more than that in the
genome of any species, and overwhelmingly more than the genetic
information unique to one person. So human artists are trying to signal
across the same scale of gap between humans as the flowers and insects
are between species. They can use some species-specific criteria; but
they can also reach towards objective beauty. Exactly the same is true
of all our other knowledge: we can communicate with other people by
sending predetermined messages determined by our genes or culture, or we
can invent something new. But in the latter case, to have any chance of
communicating, we had better strive to rise above parochialism and seek
universal truths. This may be the proximate reason that humans ever
began to do so.</p>
<p>One amusing corollary of this theory is, I think, that it is quite
possible that human appearance, as influenced by human sexual selection,
satisfies standards of objective beauty as well as species-specific
ones. We may not be very far along that path yet, because we diverged
from apes only a few hundred thousand years ago, so our appearance isn’t
yet all that different from that of apes. But I guess that when beauty
is better understood it will turn out that most of the differences have
been in the direction of making humans objectively more beautiful than
apes.</p>
<p>The two types of beauty are usually created to solve two types of
problem – which could be called pure and applied. The applied kind is
that of signalling information, and is usually solved by creating the
parochial type of beauty. Humans have problems of that type too: the
beauty of, say, the graphical user interface of a computer is created
primarily to promote comfort and efficiency in the machine’s use.
Sometimes a poem or song may be written for a similar practical purpose:
to give more cohesiveness to a culture, or to advance a political
agenda, or even to advertise beverages. Again, sometimes these purposes
can also be met by creating objective beauty, but usually the parochial
kind is used because it is easier to create.</p>
<p>The other kind of problem, the pure kind, which has no analogue in
biology, is that of creating beauty for its own sake – which includes
creating improved criteria for beauty: new artistic standards or styles.
This is the analogue of pure scientific research. The states of mind
involved in that sort of science and that sort of art are fundamentally
the same. Both are seeking universal, objective truth.</p>
<p>And both, I believe, are seeking it through good explanations. This
is most straightforwardly so in the case of art forms that involve
stories – fiction. There, as I mentioned in Chapter 11, a good story has
a good explanation of the fictional events that it portrays. But the
same is true in all art forms. In some, it is especially hard to express
in words the explanation of the beauty of a particular work of art, even
if one knows it, because the relevant knowledge is itself not expressed
in words – it is inexplicit. No one yet knows how to translate musical
explanations into natural language. Yet when a piece of music has the
attribute ‘displace one note and there would be diminishment’ there is
an explanation: it was known to the composer, and it is known to the
listeners who appreciate it. One day it will be expressible in
words.</p>
<p>This, too, is not as different from science and mathematics as it
looks: poetry and mathematics or physics share the property that they
develop a language different from ordinary language in order to state
things efficiently that it would be very inefficient to state in
ordinary language. And both do this by constructing variants of ordinary
language: one has to understand the latter first in order to understand
explanations of, and in, the former.</p>
<p>Applied art and pure art ‘feel’ the same. And, just as we need
sophisticated knowledge to tell the difference between the motion of a
bird across the sky, which is happening objectively, and the motion of
the sun across the sky, which is just a subjective illusion caused by
our own motion, and the motion of the moon, which is a bit of each, so
pure and applied art, universal and parochial beauty, are mixed together
in our subjective appreciation of things. It will be important to
discover which is which. For it is only in the objective direction that
we can expect to make unlimited progress. The other directions are
inherently finite. They are circumscribed by the finite knowledge
inherent in our genes and our existing traditions.</p>
<p>That has a bearing on various existing theories of what art is.
Ancient fine art, for instance in Greece, was initially concerned with
the skill of reproducing the shapes of human bodies and other objects.
That is not the same as the pursuit of objective beauty, because, among
other things, it is perfectible (in the bad sense that it can reach a
state that cannot be much improved on). But it is a skill that can allow
artists to pursue pure art as well, and they did so in the ancient
world, and then again during the revival of that tradition in the
Renaissance.</p>
<p>There are utilitarian theories of the purpose of art. These theories
deprecate pure art, just as pure science and mathematics are deprecated
by the same arguments. But one has no choice about what constitutes an
artistic improvement any more than one has a choice as to what is true
and false in mathematics. And if one tries to tune one’s scientific
theories or philosophical positions to meet a political agenda, or a
personal preference, then one is at cross purposes. Art can be used for
many purposes. But artistic values are not subordinate to, or derived
from, anything else.</p>
<p>The same critique applies to the theory that art is self-expression.
Expression is conveying something that is already there, while objective
progress in art is about creating something new. Also, self-expression
is about expressing something subjective, while pure art is objective.
For the same reason, any kind of art that consists solely of spontaneous
or mechanical acts, such as throwing paint on to canvas, or of pickling
sheep, lacks the means of making artistic progress, because real
progress is difficult and involves many errors for every success.</p>
<p>If I am right, then the future of art is as mind-boggling as the
future of every other kind of knowledge: art of the future can create
unlimited increases in beauty. I can only speculate, but we can
presumably expect new kinds of unification too. When we understand
better what elegance really is, perhaps we shall find new and better
ways to seek truth using elegance or beauty. I guess that we shall also
be able to design new senses, and design new qualia, that can encompass
beauty of new kinds literally inconceivable to us now. ‘What is it like
to be a bat?’ is a famous question asked by the philosopher Thomas
Nagel. (More precisely, what would it be like for a person to have the
echo-location senses of a bat?) Perhaps the full answer is that in
future it will be not so much be the task of philosophy to discover what
that is like, but the task of technological art to give us the
experience itself.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p>Aesthetics The philosophy of beauty.</p>
<p>Elegance The beauty in explanations, mathematical formulae and so
on.</p>
<p>Explicit Expressed in words or symbols.</p>
<p>Inexplicit Not explicit.</p>
<p>Implicit Implied or otherwise contained in other information.</p>
<p>MEANINGS OF ‘THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY’ ENCOUNTERED IN THIS
CHAPTER</p>
<p>– The fact that elegance is a heuristic guide to truth.</p>
<p>– The need to create objective knowledge in order to allow different
people to communicate.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>There are objective truths in aesthetics. The standard argument that
there cannot be is a relic of empiricism. Aesthetic truths are linked to
factual ones by explanations, and also because artistic problems can
emerge from physical facts and situations. The fact that flowers
reliably seem beautiful to humans when their designs evolved for an
apparently unrelated purpose is evidence that beauty is objective. Those
convergent criteria of beauty solve the problem of creating
hard-to-forge signals where prior shared knowledge is insufficient to
provide them.</p>
