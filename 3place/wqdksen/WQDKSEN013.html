<h4 id="the-multiverse">11 The Multiverse</h4>
<p>The idea of a ‘doppelgänger’ (a ‘double’ of a person) is a frequent
theme of science fiction. For instance, the classic television series
Star Trek featured several types of doppelgänger story involving
malfunctions of the ‘transporter’, the starship’s teleportation device,
normally used for short-range space travel. Since teleporting something
is conceptually similar to making a copy of it at a different location,
one can imagine various ways in which the process could go wrong and
somehow end up with two instances of each passenger – the original and
the copy.</p>
<p>Stories vary in how similar the doppelgängers are to their originals.
To share literally all their attributes, they would have to be at
exactly the same location as well as looking alike. But what would that
mean? Trying to make atoms coincide leads to some problematic physics –
for instance, two coinciding nuclei are liable to combine to form atoms
of heavier chemical elements. And if two identical human bodies were to
coincide even approximately, they would explode simply because water at
double its normal density exerts a pressure of hundreds of thousands of
atmospheres. In fiction one could imagine different laws of physics to
avoid those problems; but, even then, if the doppelgängers continued to
coincide with their originals throughout the story, it would not really
be about doppelgängers. Sooner or later they have to be different.
Sometimes they are the good and evil ‘sides’ of the same person;
sometimes they start with identical minds but become increasingly
different through having different experiences.</p>
<p>Sometimes a doppelgänger is not copied from an original, but exists
from the outset in a ‘parallel universe’. In some stories there is a
‘rift’ between universes through which one can communicate or even
travel to meet one’s doppelgänger. In others, the universes remain
mutually imperceptible, in which case the interest of the story (or,
rather, two stories) is in how events are affected by the differences
between them. For instance, the movie Sliding Doors interleaves two
variants of a love story, following the fortunes of two instances of the
same couple in two universes which initially differ only in one small
detail. In a related genre, known as ‘alternative history’, one of the
two stories need not be told explicitly because it is a part of our own
history and is assumed to be known to the audience. For example, the
novel Fatherland, by Robert Harris, is about a universe in which Germany
won the Second World War; Robert Silverberg’s Roma Eterna is about one
in which the Roman Empire did not fall.</p>
<p>In another class of stories, the transporter’s malfunction
accidentally exiles the passengers to a ‘phantom zone’ where they are
imperceptible to everyone in the ordinary world, but can see and hear
them (and each other). So they have the distressing experience of
yelling and gesticulating in vain to their shipmates, who are oblivious
and walk right through them.</p>
<p>In some stories it is only copies of the travellers that are sent to
a phantom zone, unbeknown to the originals. Such a story may end with
the exiles discovering that they can, after all, have some effect on the
ordinary world. They use that effect to signal their existence, and are
rescued through a reversal of the process that exiled them. Depending on
the fictional science that has been supposed, they then may begin new
lives as separate people, or they may merge with their originals. The
latter option violates the principle of the conservation of mass, among
other laws of physics. But, again, this is fiction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a certain category of rather pedantic science
fiction enthusiasts, myself included, who prefer the fictional science
to make sense – to consist of reasonably good explanations. Imagining
worlds with different laws of physics is one thing; imagining worlds
that do not make sense in their own terms is quite another. For
instance, we want to know how it can be that the exiles can see and hear
the ordinary world but not touch it. This attitude of ours was nicely
parodied in an episode of the television series The Simpsons, in which
fans of a fantasy-adventure series question its star:</p>
<p>STAR: Next question.</p>
<p>FAN: Yes, over here. [Clears throat.] In episode BF12, you were
battling barbarians while riding a wingèd Appaloosa, yet in the very
next scene, my dear, you’re clearly atop a wingèd Arabian. Please to
explain it.</p>
<p>STAR: Ah, yeah, well, whenever you notice something like that, a
wizard did it.</p>
<p>FAN: I see, all right, yes, but in episode AG4 –</p>
<p>STAR: [firmly] Wizard.</p>
<p>FAN: Aw, for glayvin* out loud!</p>
<p>Because that is a parody, the fan is complaining not about the story
itself, but only that there is a continuity error: two horses were used
at different times to play the role of a single fictional horse.
Nevertheless, there are such things as flawed stories. Consider, for
instance, a story about a quest to discover whether winged horses are
real, in which the characters pursue that quest on winged horses. Though
logically consistent, such a story would not make sense in its own
terms, as an explanation. One could embed it in a context that would
make sense of it – for instance, it could be part of an allegory about
how people often fail to see the meaning of what is right there in front
of them. But in that case any merit in the story would still depend on
how the characters’ apparently nonsensical behaviour was explicable in
terms of that allegory. Compare that with the explanation that ‘a wizard
did it.’ Since a wizard could equally well have been said to conjure any
events, in any story, it is a bad explanation; and that is why the fan
is exasperated by it.</p>
<p>In some stories the plot is not important: the story is really about
something else. But a good plot always rests, implicitly or explicitly,
on good explanations of how and why events happen, given its fictional
premises. In that case, even if those premises are about wizards, the
story is not really about the supernatural: it is about imaginary laws
of physics and imaginary societies, as well as real problems and true
ideas. As I shall explain in Chapter 14, not only do all good
science-fiction plots resemble scientific explanation in this way, in
the broadest sense all good art does.</p>
<p>In that spirit, then, consider the fictional doppelgängers in the
phantom zone. What enables them to see the ordinary world? Since they
are structurally identical to their originals, their eyes work by
absorbing light and detecting the resulting chemical changes, just as
real eyes do. But if they absorb some of the light coming from the
ordinary world, then they must cast shadows at the places where that
light would otherwise have arrived. Also, if the exiles in the phantom
zone can see each other, what light are they seeing with? The phantom
zone’s own light? If so, where does it come from?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the exiles can see without absorbing light,
then they must be differently constituted from their originals, at the
microscopic level. And in that case we no longer have an explanation of
why they outwardly resemble their originals: the ‘accidental-copying’
idea will no longer do: where did the transporter get the knowledge
required to build things that look and behave like human bodies, but
function internally in a different way? It would be a case of
spontaneous generation.</p>
<p>Similarly, is there air in the phantom zone? If the exiles breathe
air, it can’t be the ship’s air, because they would be heard speaking or
even breathing. But nor can it be a copy of the small amount of air that
was in the transporter with them, because they are free to move around
the ship. So there must be a whole shipful of phantom-zone air. But then
what is preventing it from expanding out into space?</p>
<p>It seems that almost everything that happens in the story not only
conflicts with the real laws of physics (which is unexceptionable in
fiction), but raises problems within the fictional explanation. If the
doppelgängers can walk through people, why do they not fall through the
floor? In reality, a floor supports people by bending slightly. But if
it were to bend in the story, it would also vibrate with their steps and
set off sound waves which people in the ordinary world could hear. So
there must be a separate floor and walls as well as an entire spaceship
hull in the phantom zone. Even the space outside cannot be ordinary
space, because if one could get back into ordinary space by leaving the
ship, then the exiles could return by that route. But if there is an
entire phantom-zone space out there – a parallel universe – how could a
mere transporter malfunction have created that?</p>
<p>We should not be surprised that good fictional science is hard to
invent: it is a variant of real science, and real scientific knowledge
is very hard to vary. Thus few if any of the storylines that I have
outlined make sense as they stand. But I want to continue with one of my
own, making sure that it (eventually) does make sense.</p>
<p>A writer of real science fiction faces two conflicting incentives.
One is, as with all fiction, to allow the reader to engage with the
story, and the easiest way to do that is to draw on themes that are
already familiar. But that is an anthropocentric incentive. For
instance, it pushes authors to imagine ways around the absolute speed
limit that the laws of physics impose on travel and communication
(namely the speed of light). But when authors do that, they relegate
distance to the role that it has in stories about our home planet: star
systems play the same role that remote islands or the Wild West did in
the fiction of earlier eras. Similarly, the temptation in
parallel-universe stories is to allow communication or travel between
universes. But then the story is really about a single universe: once
the barrier between the universes is easily penetrable, it becomes no
more than an exotic version of the oceans that separate continents. A
story that succumbs entirely to this anthropocentric incentive is not
really science fiction but ordinary fiction in disguise.</p>
<p>The opposing incentive is to explore the strongest possible version
of a fictional-science premise, and its strangest possible implications
– which pushes in the anti-anthropocentric direction. This may make the
story harder to engage with, but it allows for a much broader range of
scientific speculations. In the story that I shall tell here, I shall
use a succession of such speculations, increasingly distant from the
familiar, as means of explaining the world according to quantum
theory.</p>
<p>Quantum theory is the deepest explanation known to science. It
violates many of the assumptions of common sense, and of all previous
science – including some that no one suspected were being made at all
until quantum theory came along and contradicted them. And yet this
seemingly alien territory is the reality of which we and everything we
experience are part. There is no other. So, in setting a story there,
perhaps what I lose in terms of the familiar ingredients of drama I
shall gain in terms of opportunity to explain something that is more
astounding than any fiction, yet is the purest and most basic fact we
know about the physical world.</p>
<p>I had better warn the reader that the account that I shall give –
known as the ‘many-universes interpretation’ of quantum theory (rather
inadequately, since there is much more to it than ‘universes’) – remains
at the time of writing a decidedly minority view among physicists. In
the next chapter I shall speculate why that is so despite the fact that
many well-studied phenomena have no other known explanation. For the
moment, suffice it to say that the very idea of science as explanation,
in the sense that I am advocating in this book (namely an account of
what is really out there), is itself still a minority view even among
theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>Let me begin with perhaps the simplest possible ‘parallel-universe’
speculation: a ‘phantom zone’ has existed all along (ever since its own
Big Bang). Until our story begins, it has been an exact doppelgänger of
the entire universe, atom for atom and event for event.</p>
<p>All the flaws that I mentioned in the phantom-zone stories derive
from the asymmetry that things in the ordinary world affect things in
the phantom zone but not vice versa. So let me eliminate those flaws by
imagining, for the moment, that the universes are completely
imperceptible to each other. Since we are heading towards real physics,
let me also retain the speed-of-light limit on communication, and let
the laws of physics be universal and symmetrical (i.e. they make no
distinction between the universes). Moreover, they are deterministic:
nothing random ever happens, which is why the universes have remained
alike – so far. So how can they ever become different? That is a key
question in the theory of the multiverse, which I shall answer
below.</p>
<p>All these basic properties of my fictional world can be thought of as
conditions on the flow of information: one cannot send a message to the
other universe; nor can one change anything in one’s own universe sooner
than light could reach that thing. Nor can one bring new information –
even random information – into the world: everything that happens is
determined by laws of physics from what has gone before. However, one
can, of course, bring new knowledge into the world. Knowledge consists
of explanations, and none of those conditions prevents the creation of
new explanations. All this is true of the real world too.</p>
<p>We can temporarily think of the two universes as being literally
parallel. Suppress the third dimension of space and think of a universe
as being two-dimensional, like an infinitely flat television. Then place
a second such television parallel to it, showing exactly the same
pictures (symbolizing the objects in the two universes). Now forget the
material of which the televisions are made. Only the pictures exist.
This is to stress that a universe is not a receptacle containing
physical objects: it is those objects. In real physics, even space is a
physical object, capable of warping and affecting matter and being
affected by it.</p>
<p>So now we have two perfectly parallel, identical universes, each
including an instance of our starship, its crew and its transporter, and
of the whole of space. Because of the symmetry between them, it is now
misleading to call one of them ‘the ordinary universe’ and the other
‘the phantom zone’. So I shall just call them ‘universes’. The two of
them together (which comprise the whole of physical reality in the story
so far) are the multiverse. Similarly, it is misleading to speak of the
‘original’ object and its ‘doppelgänger’: they are simply the two
instances of the object.</p>
<p>If our science-fiction speculation were to stop there, the two
universes would have to remain identical for ever. There is nothing
logically impossible about that. Yet it would make our story fatally
flawed both as fiction and as scientific speculation – and for the same
reason: it is a story of two universes, but only one history. That is to
say, there is only one script about what is really there in both
universes. Considered as fiction, therefore, it is really a
single-universe story in a pointless disguise. Considered as scientific
speculation, it describes a world that would not be explicable to its
inhabitants. For how could they ever argue that their history takes
place in two universes and not three or thirty? Why not two today and
thirty tomorrow? Moreover, since their world has only one history, all
their good explanations about nature would be about that history. That
single history would be what they meant by their ‘world’ or ‘universe’.
Nothing of the underlying two-ness of their reality would be accessible
to them, nor would it make any more sense to them as an explanation than
would three-ness or thirty-ness – yet they would be factually
mistaken.</p>
<p>A remark about explanation: Although the story so far would be a bad
explanation from the inhabitants’ point of view, it is not necessarily
bad from ours. Imagining inexplicable worlds can help us to understand
the nature of explicability. I have already imagined some inexplicable
worlds for that very reason in previous chapters, and I shall imagine
more in this chapter. But, in the end, I want to tell of an explicable
world, and it will be ours.</p>
<p>A remark about terminology: The world is the whole of physical
reality. In classical (pre-quantum) physics, the world was thought to
consist of one universe – something like a whole three-dimensional space
for the whole of time, and all its contents. According to quantum
physics, as I shall explain, the world is a much larger and more
complicated object, a multiverse, which includes many such universes
(among other things). And a history is a sequence of events happening to
objects and possibly their identical counterparts. So, in my story so
far, the world is a multiverse that consists of two universes but has
only a single history.</p>
<p>So our two universes must not stay identical. Something like a
transporter malfunction will have to make them different. Yet, as I
said, that may seem to have been ruled out by those restrictions on
information flow. The laws of physics in the fictional multiverse are
deterministic and symmetrical. So what can the transporter possibly do
that would make the two universes differ? It may seem that whatever one
instance of it does to one universe, its doppelgänger must be doing to
the other, so the universes can only remain the same.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, that is not so. It is consistent for two identical
entities to become different under deterministic and symmetrical laws.
But, for that to happen, they must initially be more than just exact
images of each other: they must be fungible (the g is pronounced as in
‘plunger’), by which I mean identical in literally every way except that
there are two of them. The concept of fungibility is going to appear
repeatedly in my story. The term is borrowed from legal terminology,
where it refers to the legal fiction that deems certain entities to be
identical for purposes such as paying debts. For example, dollar bills
are fungible in law, which means that, unless otherwise agreed,
borrowing a dollar does not require one to return the specific banknote
that one borrowed. Barrels of oil (of a given grade) are fungible too.
Horses are not: borrowing someone’s horse means that one has to return
that specific horse; even its identical twin will not do. But the
physical fungibility I am referring to here is not about deeming. It
means being identical, and that is a very different and
counter-intuitive property. Leibniz, in his doctrine of ‘the identity of
indiscernibles’, went so far as to rule out its existence on principle.
But he was mistaken. Even aside from the physics of the multiverse, we
now know that photons, and under some conditions even atoms, can be
fungible. This is achieved in lasers and in devices called ‘atomic
lasers’ respectively. The latter emit bursts of extremely cold, fungible
atoms. For how this is possible without causing transmutation,
explosions and so on, see below.</p>
<p>You will not find the concept of fungibility discussed or even
mentioned in many textbooks or research papers on quantum theory, even
the small minority that endorse the many-universes interpretation.
Nevertheless, it is everywhere just beneath the conceptual surface, and
I believe that making it explicit helps to explain quantum phenomena
without fudging. As will become clear, it is an even weirder attribute
than Leibniz guessed – much weirder than multiple universes for
instance, which are, after all, just common sense, repeated. It allows
radically new types of motion and information flow, different from
anything that was imagined before quantum physics, and hence a radically
different structure of the physical world.</p>
<p>It so happens that, in some situations, money is not only legally
fungible but physically too; and, being so familiar, it provides a good
model for thinking about fungibility. For example, if the balance in
your (electronic) bank account is one dollar, and the bank adds a second
dollar as a loyalty bonus and later withdraws a dollar in charges, there
is no meaning to whether the dollar they withdrew is the one that was
there originally or the one that they had added – or is composed of a
little of each. It is not merely that we cannot know whether it was the
same dollar, or have decided not to care: because of the physics of the
situation there really is no such thing as taking the original dollar,
nor such a thing as taking the one added subsequently.</p>
<p>Dollars in bank accounts are what may be called ‘configurational’
entities: they are states or configurations of objects, not what we
usually think of as physical objects in their own right. Your bank
balance resides in the state of a certain information-storage device. In
a sense you own that state (it is illegal for anyone to alter it without
your consent), but you do not own the device itself or any part of it.
So in that sense a dollar is an abstraction. Indeed, it is a piece of
abstract knowledge. As I discussed in Chapter 4, knowledge, once
embodied in physical form in a suitable environment, causes itself to
remain so. And thus, when a physical dollar wears out and is destroyed
by the mint, the abstract dollar causes the mint to transfer it into
electronic form, or into a new instance in paper form. It is an abstract
replicator – though, unusually for a replicator, it causes itself not to
proliferate, but rather to be copied into ledgers and into backups of
computer memories.</p>
<p>Another example of fungible configurational entities in classical
physics is amounts of energy: if you pedal your bicycle until you have
built up a kinetic energy of ten kilojoules, and then brake until half
that energy has been dissipated as heat, there is no meaning to whether
the energy dissipated was the first five kilojoules that you had added
or the second, or any combination. But it is meaningful that half the
energy that was there has been dissipated. It turns out that, in quantum
physics, elementary particles are configurational entities too. The
vacuum, which we perceive as empty at everyday scales and even at atomic
scales, is not really emptiness, but a richly structured entity known as
a ‘quantum field’. Elementary particles are higher-energy configurations
of this entity: ‘excitations of the vacuum’. So, for instance, the
photons in a laser are configurations of the vacuum inside its ‘cavity’.
When two or more such excitations with identical attributes (such as
energy and spin) are present in the cavity, there is no such thing as
which one was there first, nor which one will be the next to leave.
There is only such a thing as the attributes of any one of them, and how
many of them there are.</p>
<p>If the two universes of our fictional multiverse are initially
fungible, our transporter malfunction can make them acquire different
attributes in the same way that a bank’s computer can withdraw one of
two fungible dollars and not the other from an account containing two
dollars. The laws of physics could, for instance, say that, when the
transporter malfunctions, then in one of the universes and not the other
there will be a small voltage surge in the transported objects. The
laws, being symmetrical, could not possibly specify which universe the
surge will take place in. But, precisely because the universes are
initially fungible, they do not have to.</p>
<p>It is a rather counter-intuitive fact that if objects are merely
identical (in the sense of being exact copies), and obey deterministic
laws that make no distinction between them, then they can never become
different; but fungible objects, which on the face of it are even more
alike, can. This is the first of those weird properties of fungibility
that Leibniz never thought of, and which I consider to be at the heart
of the phenomena of quantum physics.</p>
<p>Here is another. Suppose that your account contains a hundred dollars
and you have instructed your bank to transfer one dollar from this
account to the tax authority on a specified date in the future. So the
bank’s computer now contains a deterministic rule to that effect.
Suppose that you have done this because the dollar already belongs to
the tax authority. (Say it had mistakenly sent you a tax refund, and has
given you a deadline to repay it.) Since the dollars in the account are
fungible, there is no such thing as which one belongs to the tax
authority and which belong to you. So we now have a situation in which a
collection of objects, though fungible, do not all have the same owner!
Everyday language struggles to describe this situation: each dollar in
the account shares literally all its attributes with the others, yet it
is not the case that all of them have the same owner. So, could we say
that in this situation they have no owner? That would be misleading,
because evidently the tax authority does own one of them and you do own
the rest. Could one say that they all have two owners? Perhaps, but only
because that is a vague term. Certainly there is no point in saying that
one cent of each of the dollars is owned by the tax authority, because
that simply runs into the problem that the cents in the account are all
fungible too. But, in any case, notice that the problem raised by this
‘diversity within fungibility’ is one of language only. It is a problem
of how to describe some aspects of the situation in words. No one finds
the situation itself paradoxical: the computer has been instructed to
execute definite rules, and there will never be any ambiguity about what
will happen as a result.</p>
<p>Diversity within fungibility is a widespread phenomenon in the
multiverse, as I shall explain. One big difference from the case of
fungible money is that in the latter case we never have to wonder about
– or predict – what it would be like to be a dollar. That is to say,
what it would be like to be fungible, and then to become differentiated.
Many applications of quantum theory require us to do exactly that.</p>
<p>But first: I suggested temporarily visualizing our two universes as
being next to each other in space – just as some science-fiction stories
refer to doppelgänger universes as being ‘in other dimensions’. But now
we have to abandon that image and make them coincide: whatever that
‘extra dimension’ was supposed to denote, it would make them
non-fungible.* It is not that they coincide in anything, such as an
external space: they are not in space. An instance of space is part of
each of them. That they ‘coincide’ means only that they are not separate
in any way.</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine perfectly identical things coinciding. For
instance, as soon as you imagine just one of them, your imagination has
already violated their fungibility. But, although imagination may baulk,
reason does not.</p>
<p>Now our story can begin to have a non-trivial plot. For example, the
voltage surge that happens in one of the two universes when the
transporter malfunctions could cause some of the neurons in a
passenger’s brain to misfire in that universe. As a result, in that
universe, that passenger spills a cup of coffee on another passenger. As
a result, they have a shared experience which they do not have in the
other universe, and this leads to romance – just as in Sliding
Doors.</p>
<p>The voltage surges need not be ‘malfunctions’ of the transporter.
They could be a regular effect of the way it works. We accept much
larger unpredictable jolts during others forms of travel such as flying
or bronco-riding. Let us imagine that a tiny surge is produced in one of
the universes whenever the transporter is operated in both, but that it
is too small to be noticeable unless measured with a sensitive
voltmeter, or unless it nudges something that happens to be on the brink
of changing but would recede from the brink if not nudged.</p>
<p>In principle, a phenomenon could appear unpredictable to observers
for one or more of three reasons. The first is that it is affected by
some fundamentally random (indeterministic) variable. I have excluded
that possibility from our story because there are no such variables in
real physics. The second, which is at least partly responsible for most
everyday unpredictability, is that the factors affecting the phenomenon,
though deterministic, are either unknown or too complex to take account
of. (This is especially so when they involve the creation of knowledge,
as I discussed in Chapter 9.) The third – which had never been imagined
before quantum theory – is that two or more initially fungible instances
of the observer become different. That is what those transporter-induced
jolts bring about, and it makes their outcomes strictly unpredictable
despite being described by deterministic laws of physics.</p>
<p>These remarks about unpredictable phenomena could be expressed
without ever referring explicitly to fungibility. And indeed that is
what multiverse researchers usually do. Nevertheless, as I have said, I
believe that fungibility is essential to the explanation of quantum
randomness and most other quantum phenomena.</p>
<p>All three of these radically different causes of unpredictability
could in principle feel exactly the same to observers. But, in an
explicable world, there must be a way of finding out which of them (or
which combination of them) is the actual source of any apparent
randomness in nature. How could one find out that it is fungibility and
parallel universes that are responsible for a given phenomenon?</p>
<p>In fiction, there is always the temptation to introduce
inter-universe communication for this purpose, making the universes no
longer ‘parallel’. As I have said, that would really make it a
single-universe story – but we might try to disguise that fact by saying
that such communication is difficult. For example, it might be that
there is a way of adjusting the transporter in either universe so that
it produces a voltage surge in the other. Then one could use it to
transmit a message there. But we could imagine that this is very
expensive, or dangerous, so that the ship’s regulations limit its use.
‘Personal communication’ with one’s own doppelgänger is especially
prohibited. Nevertheless, one crew member illicitly ignores this
prohibition during the night watch, and is startled to receive a message
‘HAVE MARRIED SONAK.’ We know, but the character does not, that this
marriage is a knock-on effect of the coffee-spilling incident which was
itself a knock-on effect of the voltage surge in the other universe.
Then the transmission ends and no more such messages are received. We
know – but again the character does not – that this is because the
illicit use of the equipment has been detected in the other universe and
stricter safeguards have been implemented. The story could then explore
what might happen when the crew member acts upon that startling
message.</p>
<p>How should one react to the news that one’s doppelgänger has married?
Should one seek out the spouse’s doppelgänger in one’s own universe –
whom one has never even met personally, let alone formed a romantic
relationship with? Or whom, in the time-honoured tradition of love
stories, one finds annoying. It can’t do any harm. Or can it?</p>
<p>Ideas originating in the other universe are at least as fallible as
those in ours; and if they are difficult to obtain, that makes
error-correction harder. Knowledge-creation depends on error-correction.
So perhaps the message would have continued ‘ALREADY REGRETTING IT’. Or
perhaps Sonak had just turned up in the transporter room in the other
universe, making it impossible to send that warning. Or perhaps the
couple are happy at the moment, but will shortly have a disastrous
break-up resulting in divorce. In all those cases, that inter-universe
communication, far from being helpful, could cause a doubling of the
number of disastrous marriage decisions made by the two instances of
that crew member.</p>
<p>More generally, the news that your doppelgänger seems happy having
made a particular decision in the other universe does not imply that you
will be happy if you make the ‘corresponding’ decision. Once there are
differences between the universes (and without such differences news
from the other universe is not news), there is no good reason to expect
the outcome of a decision to be unaffected by them. In one universe, you
met because of an accidental shared experience; in the other, because
you have illegally used the ship’s equipment. Can that affect the
happiness of a marriage? Perhaps not, but you can only know that if you
have a good explanatory theory of which factors affect the outcomes of
marriages and which do not. And if you have such a theory, then perhaps
you have no need to be skulking in transporter rooms.</p>
<p>Still more generally, the benefit of inter-universe communication
would be, in effect, that it permits new forms of information
processing. In the fictional case I have described, since the two
universes have been identical until quite recently, communicating with
one’s other-universe counterpart achieves the same effect as running a
computer simulation of an alternative version of a period of one’s own
life, without having to know all the relevant physical variables
explicitly. This computation is infeasible in any other way, and could
be helpful in testing explanatory theories of how various factors affect
outcomes. Nevertheless, it is no substitute for thinking of those
theories in the first place.</p>
<p>Therefore, if such communication is a scarce resource, a more
efficient way of using it might be to exchange the theories themselves:
if your doppelgänger solves a problem and tells you the solution, then
you can see for yourself that it is a good explanation even if you have
no way of knowing how your doppelgänger arrived at it.</p>
<p>Another efficient use of inter-universe communication might be to
share the work of a lengthy computation. For instance, the story might
be that some crew members have been poisoned and will die within hours
unless the antidote is administered. To find the antidote requires
computer simulations of the effects of many variants of a drug. So the
two instances of the ship’s computer can each search half the list of
variants, thus running through the full list in half the time. When the
cure is found in one universe, its number in the list can be transmitted
to the other universe, the result can be checked there, and the crew in
both universes are saved. Again, evidence that there is computer power
accessible in this way through the transporter would be evidence that
there really was a computer out there, performing different calculations
from one’s own. Reflecting on the details (about what the doppelgängers
breathe and so on) would then let the inhabitants know that the other
universe as a whole was a real place with similar structure and
complexity to their own. So their world would be explicable.</p>
<p>Since there is no inter-universe communication in real quantum
physics, we shall not allow it in our story, and so that specific route
to explicability is not open. The history in which our crew members are
married and the one in which they still hardly know each other cannot
communicate with each other or observe each other. Nevertheless, as we
shall see, there are circumstances in which histories can still affect
each other in ways that do not amount to communication, and the need to
explain those effects provides the main argument that our own multiverse
is real.</p>
<p>After the universes in our story begin to differ inside one starship,
everything else in the world exists in pairs of identical instances. We
must continue to imagine those pairs as being fungible. This is
necessary because the universes are not ‘receptacles’ – there is nothing
to them apart from the objects that they contain. If they did have an
independent reality, then each of the objects in such a pair would have
a property of being in one particular universe and not the other, which
would make them non-fungible.</p>
<p>Typically, the region in which the universes are different will then
grow. For instance, when the couple decide to marry, they send messages
to their home planets announcing this. When the messages arrive, the two
instances of each of those planets become different. Previously only the
two instances of the starship were different, bur soon, even before
anyone broadcasts it intentionally, some of the information will have
leaked out. For instance, people in the starship are moving differently
in the two universes as a result of the marriage decision, so light
bounces off them differently and some of it leaves the starship through
portholes, making the two universes slightly different wherever it goes.
The same is true of heat radiation (infra-red light), which leaves the
starship through every point on the hull. Thus, starting with the
voltage happening in only one universe, a wave of differentiation
between the universes spreads in all directions through space. Since
information travelling in either universe cannot exceed the speed of
light, nor can the wave of differentiation. And since, at its leading
edge, it mostly travels at or near that speed, differences in the head
start that some directions have over others will become an ever smaller
proportion of the total distance travelled, and so the further the wave
travels the more nearly spherical it becomes. So I shall call it a
‘sphere of differentiation’.</p>
<p>Even inside the sphere of differentiation, there are comparatively
few differences between the universes: the stars still shine, the
planets still have the same continents. Even the people who hear of the
wedding, and behave differently as a result, retain most of the same
data in their brains and other information-storage devices, and they
still breathe the same type of air, eat the same types of food, and so
on.</p>
<p>However, although it may seem intuitively reasonable that news of the
marriage leaves most things unchanged, there is a different commonsense
intuition that seems to prove that it must change everything, if only
slightly. Consider what happens when the news reaches a planet – say, in
the form of pulse of photons from a communication laser. Even before any
human consequences, there is the physical impact of those photons, which
one might expect to impart momentum to every atom exposed to the beam –
which will be every atom in something like that half of the surface of
the planet which is facing the beam. Those atoms would then vibrate a
little differently, affecting the atoms below through interatomic
forces. As each atom affected others, the effect would spread rapidly
through the planet. Soon, every atom in the planet would have been
affected – though most of them by unimaginably tiny amounts.
Nevertheless, however small such an effect was, it would be enough to
break the fungibility between each atom and its other-universe
counterpart. Hence it would seem that nothing would be left fungible
after the wave of differentiation had passed.</p>
<p>These two opposite intuitions reflect the ancient dichotomy between
the discrete and the continuous. The above argument – that everything in
the sphere of differentiation must become different – depends on the
reality of extremely small physical changes – changes that would be many
orders of magnitude too small to be measurable. The existence of such
changes follows inexorably from the explanations of classical physics,
because in classical physics most fundamental quantities (such as
energy) are continuously variable. The opposing intuition comes from
thinking about the world in terms of information processing, and hence
in terms of discrete variables such as the contents of people’s
memories. Quantum theory adjudicates this conflict in favour of the
discrete. For a typical physical quantity, there is a smallest possible
change that it can undergo in a given situation. For instance, there is
a smallest possible amount of energy that can be transferred from
radiation to any particular atom. The atom cannot absorb any less than
that amount, which is called a ‘quantum’ of energy. Since this was the
first distinctive feature of quantum physics to be discovered, it gave
its name to the field. Let us incorporate it into our fictional physics
as well.</p>
<p>Hence it is not the case that all the atoms on the surface of the
planet are changed by the arrival of the radio message. In reality, the
typical response of a large physical object to very small influences is
that most of its atoms remain strictly unchanged, while, to obey the
conservation laws, a few exhibit a discrete, relatively large change of
one quantum.</p>
<p>The discreteness of variables raises questions about motion and
change. Does it mean that changes happen instantaneously? They do not –
which raises the further question: what is the world like halfway
through that change? Also if a few atoms are strongly affected by some
influence, and the rest are unaffected, what determines which are the
ones to be affected? The answer has to do with fungibility, as the
reader may guess, and as I shall explain below.</p>
<p>The effects of a wave of differentiation usually diminish rapidly
with distance – simply because physical effects in general do. The sun,
from even a hundredth of a light year away, looks like a cold, bright
dot in the sky. It barely affects anything. At a thousand light years,
nor does a supernova. Even the most violent of quasar jets, when viewed
from a neighbouring galaxy, would be little more than an abstract
painting in the sky. There is only one known phenomenon which, if it
ever occurred, would have effects that did not fall off with distance,
and that is the creation of a certain type of knowledge, namely a
beginning of infinity. Indeed, knowledge can aim itself at a target,
travel vast distances having scarcely any effect, and then utterly
transform the destination.</p>
<p>In our story, too, if we wanted the transporter malfunction to have a
significant physical effect at astronomical distances, it would have to
be via knowledge. All those torrents of photons streaming out of the
starship and carrying, intentionally or unintentionally, information
about a wedding will have a noticeable effect on the distant planet only
if someone there cares about the possibility of such information enough
to set up scientific instruments that could detect it.</p>
<p>Now, as I have explained, our imaginary laws of physics which say
that a voltage surge happens ‘in one universe but not the other’ cannot
be deterministic unless the universes are fungible. So, what happens
when the transporter is used again, after the universes are no longer
fungible? Imagine a second starship, of the same type as the first and
far away. What happens if the second starship runs its transporter
immediately after the first one did?</p>
<p>One logically possible answer would be that nothing happens – in
other words, the laws of physics would say that, once the two universes
are different, all transporters just work normally and never produce a
voltage surge again. However, that would also provide a way of
communicating faster than light, albeit unreliably and only once. You
set up a voltmeter in the transporter room and run the transporter. If
the voltage surges, you know that the other starship, however far away,
has not yet run its transporter (because, if it had, that would have put
a permanent end to such surges everywhere). The laws governing the real
multiverse do not allow information to flow in that way. If we want our
fictional laws of physics to be universal from the inhabitants’ point of
view, the second transporter must do exactly what the first one did. It
must cause a voltage surge in one universe and not in the other.</p>
<p>But in that case something must determine which universe the second
surge will happen in. ‘In one universe but not the other’ is no longer a
deterministic specification. Also, a surge must not happen if the
transporter is run only in the other universe. That would constitute
inter-universe communication. It must depend on both instances of the
transporter being run simultaneously. Even that could allow some
inter-universe communication, as follows. In the universe where a surge
has once happened, run the transporter at a prearranged time and observe
the voltmeter. If no surge happens, then the transporter in the other
universe is switched off. So we are at an impasse. It is remarkable how
much subtlety there can be in the apparently straightforward, binary
distinction between ‘same’ and different’ – or between ‘affected’ and
‘unaffected’. In the real quantum theory, too, the prohibitions on
inter-universe communication and faster-than-light communication are
closely connected.</p>
<p>There is a way – I think it is the only way – to meet simultaneously
the requirements that our fictional laws of physics be universal and
deterministic, and forbid faster-than-light and inter-universe
communication: more universes. Imagine an uncountably infinite number of
them, initially all fungible. The transporter causes previously fungible
ones to become different, as before; but now the relevant law of physics
says, ‘The voltage surges in half the universes in which the transporter
is used.’ So, if the two starships both run their transporters, then,
after the two spheres of differentiation have overlapped, there will be
universes of four different kinds: those in which a surge happened only
in the first starship, only in the second, in neither, and in both. In
other words, in the overlap region there are four different histories,
each taking place in one quarter of the universes.</p>
<p>Our fictional theory has not provided enough structure in its
multiverse to give a meaning to ‘half the universes’, but the real
quantum theory does. As I explained in Chapter 8, the method that a
theory provides for giving a meaning to proportions and averages for
infinite sets is called a measure. A familiar example is that classical
physics assigns lengths to infinite sets of points arranged in a line.
Let us suppose that our theory provides a measure for universes.</p>
<p>Now we are allowed storylines such as the following. In the universes
in which the couple married, they spend their honeymoon on a
human-colonized planet that the starship is visiting. As they are
teleporting back up, the voltage surge in half those universes causes
someone’s electronic notepad to play a voice message suggesting that one
of the newlyweds has already been unfaithful. This sets off a chain of
events that ends in divorce. So now our original collection of fungible
universes contains three different histories: in one, comprising half
the original set of universes, the couple in question are still single;
in the second, comprising a quarter of the original set, they are
married; and in the third, comprising the remaining quarter, they are
divorced.</p>
<p>Thus the three histories do not occupy equal proportions of the
multiverse. There are twice as many universes in which the couple never
married as there are universes in which they divorced.</p>
<p>Now suppose that scientists on the starship know about the multiverse
and understand the physics of the transporter. (Though note that we have
not yet given them a way of discovering those things.) Then they know
that, when they run the transporter, an infinite number of fungible
instances of themselves, all sharing the same history, are doing so at
the same time. They know that a voltage surge will occur in half the
universes in that history, which means that it will split into two
histories of equal measure. Hence they know that, if they use a
voltmeter capable of detecting the surge, half of the instances of
themselves are going to find that it has recorded one, and the other
half are not. But they also know that it is meaningless to ask (not
merely impossible to know) which event they will experience.
Consequently they can make two closely related predictions. One is that,
despite the perfect determinism of everything that is happening, nothing
can reliably predict for them whether the voltmeter will detect a
surge.</p>
<p>The other prediction is simply that the voltmeter will record a surge
with probability one-half. Thus the outcomes of such experiments are
subjectively random (from the perspective of any observer) even though
everything that is happening is completely determined objectively. This
is also the origin of quantum-mechanical randomness and probability in
real physics: it is due to the measure that the theory provides for the
multiverse, which is in turn due to what kinds of physical processes the
theory allows and forbids.</p>
<p>Notice that when a random outcome (in this sense) is about to happen,
it is a situation of diversity within fungibility: the diversity is in
the variable ‘what outcome they are going to see’. The logic of the
situation is the same as in cases like that of the bank account I
discussed above, except that this time the fungible entities are people.
They are fungible, yet half of them are going to see the surge and the
other half not.</p>
<p>In practice they could test this prediction by doing the experiment
many times. Every formula purporting to predict the sequence of outcomes
will eventually fail: that tests the unpredictability. And in the
overwhelming majority of universes (and histories) the surge will happen
approximately half the time: that tests the predicted value of the
probability. Only a tiny proportion of the instances of the observers
will see anything different.</p>
<p>Our story continues. In one of the histories, the newspapers on the
astronauts’ home planets report the engagement. They fill many
column-inches with reports about the accident that brought the
astronauts together and so on. In the other history, where there is no
astronaut-engagement news, one newspaper fills the same space on the
page with a short story. It happens to be about a romance on a starship.
Some of the sentences in that story are identical to sentences in the
news items in the other history. The same words, printed in the same
column in the same newspaper, are fungible between the two histories;
but they are fiction in one history and fact in the other. So here the
fact/fiction attribute has diversity within fungibility.</p>
<p>The number of distinct histories will now increase rapidly. Whenever
the transporter is used, it takes only microseconds for the sphere of
differentiation to engulf the whole starship, so, if it is typically
used ten times per day, the number of distinct histories inside the
whole starship will double about ten times a day. Within a month there
will be more distinct histories than there are atoms in our visible
universe. Most of them will be extremely similar to many others, because
in only a small proportion will the precise timing and magnitude of the
voltage surge be just right to precipitate a noticeable, Sliding
Doors-type change. Nevertheless, the number of histories continues to
increase exponentially, and soon there are so many variations on events
that several significant changes have been caused somewhere in the
multiversal diversity of the starship. So the total number of such
histories increases exponentially too, even though they continue to
constitute only a small proportion of all histories that are
present.</p>
<p>Soon after that, in an even smaller but still exponentially growing
number of histories, uncanny chains of ‘accidents’ and ‘unlikely
coincidences’ will have come to dominate events. I put those terms in
quotation marks because those events are not in the least accidental.
They have all happened inevitably, according to deterministic laws of
physics. All of them were caused by the transporter.</p>
<p>Here is another situation where, if we are not careful, common sense
makes false assumptions about the physical world, and can make
descriptions of situations sound paradoxical even though the situations
themselves are quite straightforward. Dawkins gives an example in his
book Unweaving the Rainbow, analysing the claim that a television
psychic was making accurate predictions:</p>
<p>There are about 100,000 five-minute periods in a year. The
probability that any given watch, say mine, will stop in a designated
five-minute period is about 1 in 100,000. Low odds, but there are 10
million people watching the [television psychic’s] show. If only half of
them are wearing watches, we could expect about 25 of those watches to
stop in any given minute. If only a quarter of these ring in to the
studio, that is 6 calls, more than enough to dumbfound a naive audience.
Especially when you add in the calls from people whose watches stopped
the day before, people whose watches didn’t stop but whose grandfather
clocks did, people who died of heart attacks and their bereaved
relatives phoned in to say that their ‘ticker’ gave out, and so on.</p>
<p>As this example shows, the fact that certain circumstances can
explain other events without being in any way involved in causing them
is very familiar despite being counter-intuitive. The ‘naive’ audience’s
mistake is a form of parochialism: they observe a phenomenon – people
phoning in because their watches stopped – but they are failing to
understand it as part of a wider phenomenon, most of which they do not
observe. Though the unobserved parts of that wider phenomenon have in no
way affected what we, the viewers, observe, they are essential to its
explanation. Similarly, common sense and classical physics contain the
parochial error that only one history exists. This error, built into our
language and conceptual framework, makes it sound odd to say that an
event can be in one sense extremely unlikely and in another certain to
happen. But there is nothing odd about it in reality.</p>
<p>We are now seeing the interior of the spaceship as an overwhelmingly
complex jumble of superposed objects. Most locations on board are packed
with people, some of them on very unusual errands, and all unable to
perceive each other. The spaceship itself is on many slightly different
courses, due to slightly different behaviours of the crew. Of course we
are ‘seeing’ this only in our mind’s eye. Our fictional laws of physics
ensure that no observer in the multiverse itself would see anything like
that. Consequently, on closer inspection (in our mind’s eye), we also
see that there is great order and regularity in that apparent chaos. For
instance, although there is a flurry of human figures in the Captain’s
chair, we see that most of them are the Captain; and although there is a
flurry of human figures in the Navigator’s chair, we see that few of
them are the Captain. Regularities of that kind are ultimately due to
the fact that all the universes, despite their differences, obey the
same laws of physics (including their initial conditions).</p>
<p>We also see that any particular instance of the Captain only ever
interacts with one instance of the Navigator, and one instance of the
First Officer; and those instances of the Navigator and First Officer
are precisely the ones that interact with each other. These regularities
are due to the fact that the histories are nearly autonomous: what
happens in each of them depends almost entirely on previous events in
that history alone – with transporter-induced voltage surges being the
only exceptions. In the story so far, this autonomy of the histories is
rather a trivial fact, since we began by making the universes
autonomous. But it is going to be worth becoming even more pedantic for
a moment: what exactly is the difference between the instance of you
that I can interact with and the ones that are imperceptible to me? The
latter are ‘in other universes’ – but, remember, universes consist only
of the objects in them, so that amounts only to saying I can see the
ones that I can see. The upshot is that our laws of physics must also
say that every object carries within it information about which
instances of it could interact with which instances of other objects
(except when the instances are fungible, when there is no such thing as
‘which’). Quantum theory describes such information. It is known as
entanglement information.*</p>
<p>So far in the story we have set up a vast, complex world which looks
very unfamiliar in our mind’s eye, but to the overwhelming majority of
the inhabitants looks almost exactly like the single universe of our
everyday experience and of classical physics, plus some apparently
random jiggling whenever the transporter operates. A tiny minority of
the histories have been significantly affected by very ‘unlikely’
events, but even in those the information flow – what affects what – is
still very tame and familiar. For instance, a version of the ship’s log
that contains records of bizarre coincidences will be perceptible to
people who remember those coincidences, but not to other instances of
those people.</p>
<p>Thus the information in the fictional multiverse flows along a
branching tree, whose branches – histories – have different thicknesses
(measures) and never rejoin once they have separated. Each behaves
exactly as if the others did not exist. If that were the whole story,
that multiverse’s imaginary laws of physics would still be fatally
flawed as explanations in the same way that they have been all along:
there would be no difference between their predictions and those of much
more straightforward laws saying that there is only one universe – one
history – in which the transporter randomly introduces a change in the
objects that it teleports. Under those laws, instead of branching into
two autonomous histories on such occasions, the single history randomly
does or does not undergo such a change. Thus the entire stupendously
complicated multiverse that we have imagined – with its multiplicity of
entities including people walking through each other and its bizarre
occurrences and its entanglement information – would collapse into
nothing, like the galaxy in Chapter 2 that became an emulsion flaw. The
multiverse explanation of the same events would be a bad explanation,
and so the world would be inexplicable to the inhabitants if it were
true.</p>
<p>It may seem that, by imposing all those conditions on information
flow, we have gone to a lot of trouble to achieve that very attribute –
to hide, from the inhabitants, the Byzantine intricacies of their world.
In the words of Lewis Carroll’s White Knight in Through the Looking
Glass, it is as if we were</p>
<p>. . . thinking of a plan</p>
<p>To dye one’s whiskers green,</p>
<p>And always use so large a fan</p>
<p>That they could not be seen.</p>
<p>Now it is time to start removing the fan.</p>
<p>In quantum physics, information flow in the multiverse is not as tame
as in that branching tree of histories I have described. That is because
of one further quantum phenomenon: under certain circumstances, the laws
of motion allow histories to rejoin (becoming fungible again). This is
the time-reverse of the splitting (differentiation of history into two
or more histories) that I have already described, so a natural way to
implement it in our fictional multiverse is for the transporter to be
capable of undoing its own history-splitting.</p>
<p>If we represent the original splitting like this</p>
<p>where X is the normal voltage and Y is the anomalous one introduced
by the transporter, then the rejoining of histories can be represented
as</p>
<p>In an interference phenomenon, differentiated histories rejoin.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as interference: the presence of the Y-
history interferes with what the transporter usually does to an
X-history. Instead, the X and Y histories merge. This is rather like the
doppelgängers merging with their originals in some phantom-zone stories,
except that here we do not need to repeal the principle of the
conservation of mass or any other conservation law: the total measure of
all the histories remains constant.</p>
<p>Interference is the phenomenon that can provide the inhabitants of
the multiverse with evidence of the existence of multiple histories in
their world without allowing the histories to communicate. For example,
suppose that they run the transporter twice in quick succession (I shall
explain in a moment what ‘quick’ means):</p>
<p>An interference experiment</p>
<p>If they did this repeatedly (with, say, different copies of the
transporter on each occasion), they could soon infer that the
intermediate result could not be just randomly X or Y, because if it
were then the final outcome would sometimes be Y (because of ), while in
fact it is always X. Thus the inhabitants would no longer be able to
explain away what they see by assuming that only one, randomly chosen,
value of the voltage is real at the intermediate stage.</p>
<p>Although such an experiment would provide evidence that multiple
histories not only exist but affect each other strongly (in the sense
that they behave differently according to whether the other is present
or absent), it does not involve inter-history communication (sending a
message of one’s choice to the other history).</p>
<p>In our story, just as we did not allow splitting to happen in a way
that would allow communication faster than light, so we must ensure the
same for interference. The simplest way is to require that the rejoining
take place only if no wave of differentiation has happened. That is to
say, the transporter can undo the voltage surge only if this has not yet
caused any differential effects on anything else. When a wave of
differentiation, set off by two different values X and Y of some
variable, has left an object, the object is entangled with all the
differentially affected objects.</p>
<p>Entanglement</p>
<p>So our rule, in short, is that interference can happen only in
objects that are unentangled with the rest of the world. This is why, in
the interference experiment, the two applications of the transporter
have to be ‘in quick succession’. (Alternatively, the object in question
has to be sufficiently well isolated for its voltages not to affect its
surroundings.) So we can represent a generic interference experiment
symbolically as follows:</p>
<p>If an object is unentangled, it can be made to undergo interference
by something acting on it alone.</p>
<p>(The arrows ’’ and ’’ represent the action of the transporter.) Once
the object is entangled with the rest of the world in regard to the
values X and Y, no operation on the object alone can create interference
between those values. Instead, the histories are merely split further,
in the usual way:</p>
<p>In entangled objects, further splitting happens instead of
interference.</p>
<p>When two or more values of a physical variable have differently
affected something in the rest of the world, knock-on effects typically
continue indefinitely, as I have described, with a wave of
differentiation entangling more and more objects. If the differential
effects can all be undone, then interference between those original
values becomes possible again; but the laws of quantum mechanics dictate
that undoing them requires fine control of all the affected objects, and
that rapidly becomes infeasible. The process of its becoming infeasible
is known as decoherence. In most situations, decoherence is very rapid,
which is why splitting typically predominates over interference, and why
interference – though ubiquitous on microscopic scales – is quite hard
to demonstrate unambiguously in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it can be done, and quantum interference phenomena
constitute our main evidence of the existence of the multiverse, and of
what its laws are. A real-life analogue of the above experiment is
standard in quantum optics laboratories. Instead of experimenting on
voltmeters (whose many interactions with their environment quickly cause
decoherence), one uses individual photons, and the variable being acted
upon is not voltage but which of two possible paths the photon is on.
Instead of the transporter, one uses a simple device called a
semi-silvered mirror (represented by the grey sloping bars in the
diagrams below). When a photon strikes such a mirror, it bounces off in
half the universes, and passes straight through in the other half, as
shown on next page:</p>
<p>Semi-silvered mirror</p>
<p>The attributes of travelling in the X or Y directions behave
analogously to the two voltages X and Y in our fictitious multiverse. So
passing through the semi-silvered mirror is the analogue of the
transformation above. And when the two instances of a single photon,
travelling in directions X and Y, strike the second semi-silvered mirror
at the same time, they undergo the transformation , which means that
both instances emerge in the direction X: the two histories rejoin. To
demonstrate this, one can use a set-up known as a ‘Mach–Zehnder
interferometer’, which performs those two transformations (splitting and
interference) in quick succession:</p>
<p>Mach–Zehnder interferometer</p>
<p>The two ordinary mirrors (the black sloping bars) are merely there to
steer the photon from the first to the second semi-silvered mirror.</p>
<p>If a photon is introduced travelling rightwards (X) after the first
mirror instead of before as shown, then it appears to emerge randomly,
rightwards or downwards, from the last mirror (because then, happens
there). The same is true of a photon introduced travelling downwards (Y)
after the first mirror. But a photon introduced as shown in the diagram
invariably emerges rightwards, never downwards. By doing the experiment
repeatedly with and without detectors on the paths, one can verify that
only one photon is ever present per history, because only one of those
detectors is ever observed to fire during such an experiment. Then, the
fact that the intermediate histories X and Y both contribute to the
deterministic final outcome X makes it inescapable that both are
happening at the intermediate time.</p>
<p>In the real multiverse, there is no need for the transporter or any
other special apparatus to cause histories to differentiate and to
rejoin. Under the laws of quantum physics, elementary particles are
undergoing such processes of their own accord, all the time. Moreover,
histories may split into more than two – often into many trillions –
each characterized by a slightly different direction of motion or
difference in other physical variables of the elementary particle
concerned. Also, in general the resulting histories have unequal
measures. So let us now dispense with the transporter in the fictional
multiverse too.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in the number of distinct histories is quite
mind-boggling – even though, thanks to interference, there is now a
certain amount of spontaneous rejoining as well. Because of this
rejoining, the flow of information in the real multiverse is not divided
into strictly autonomous subflows – branching, autonomous histories.
Although there is still no communication between histories (in the sense
of message-sending), they are intimately affecting each other, because
the effect of interference on a history depends on what other histories
are present.</p>
<p>Not only is the multiverse no longer perfectly partitioned into
histories, individual particles are not perfectly partitioned into
instances. For example, consider the following interference phenomenon,
where X and Y now represent different values of the position of a single
particle:</p>
<p>How instances of a particle lose their identity during interference.
Has the instance of the particle at X stayed at X or moved to Y? Has the
instance of the particle at Y returned to Y or moved to X?</p>
<p>Because these two groups of instances of the particle, initially at
different positions, have gone through a moment of being fungible, there
is no such thing as which of them has ended up at which final position.
This sort of interference is going on all the time, even for a single
particle in a region of otherwise empty space. So there is in general no
such thing as the ‘same’ instance of a particle at different times.</p>
<p>Even within the same history, particles in general do not retain
their identities over time. For example, during a collision between two
atoms, the histories of the event split into something like this</p>
<p>and something like this</p>
<p>So, for each particle individually, the event is rather like a
collision with a semi-silvered mirror. Each atom plays the role of the
mirror for the other atom. But the multiversal view of both particles
looks like this</p>
<p>where at the end of the collision some of the instances of each atom
have become fungible with what was originally a different atom.</p>
<p>For the same reason, there is no such thing as the speed of one
instance of the particle at a given location. Speed is defined as
distance travelled divided by time taken, but that is not meaningful in
situations where there is no such thing as a particular instance of the
particle over time. Instead, a collection of fungible instances of a
particle in general have several speeds – meaning that in general they
will do different things an instant later. (This is another instance of
‘diversity within fungibility’.)</p>
<p>Not only can a fungible collection with the same position have
different speeds, a fungible group with the same speed can have
different positions. Furthermore, it follows from the laws of quantum
physics that, for any fungible collection of instances of a physical
object, some of their attributes must be diverse. This is known as the
‘Heisenberg uncertainty principle’, after the physicist Werner
Heisenberg, who deduced the earliest version from quantum theory.</p>
<p>Hence, for instance, an individual electron always has a range of
different locations and a range of different speeds and directions of
motion. As a result, its typical behaviour is to spread out gradually in
space. Its quantum-mechanical law of motion resembles the law governing
the spread of an ink blot – so if it is initially located in a very
small region it spreads out rapidly, and the larger it gets the more
slowly it spreads. The entanglement information that it carries ensures
that no two instances of it can ever contribute to the same history.
(Or, more precisely, at times and places where there are histories, it
exists in instances which can never collide.) If a particle’s range of
speeds is centred not on zero but on some other value, then the whole of
the ‘ink blot’ moves, with its centre obeying approximately the laws of
motion in classical physics. In quantum physics this is how motion, in
general, works.</p>
<p>This explains how particles in the same history can be fungible too,
in something like an atomic laser. Two ‘ink-blot’ particles, each of
which is a multiversal object, can coincide perfectly in space, and
their entanglement information can be such that no two of their
instances are ever at the same point in the same history.</p>
<p>Now, put a proton into the middle of that gradually spreading cloud
of instances of a single electron. The proton has a positive charge,
which attracts the negatively charged electron. As a result, the cloud
stops spreading when its size is such that its tendency to spread
outwards due to its uncertainty-principle diversity is exactly balanced
by its attraction to the proton. The resulting structure is called an
atom of hydrogen.</p>
<p>Historically, this explanation of what atoms are was one of the first
triumphs of quantum theory, for atoms could not exist at all according
to classical physics. An atom consists of a positively charged nucleus
surrounded by negatively charged electrons. But positive and negative
charges attract each other and, if unrestrained, accelerate towards each
other, emitting energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation as they
go. So it used to be a mystery why the electrons do not ‘fall’ on to the
nucleus in a flash of radiation. Neither the nucleus nor the electrons
individually have more than one ten-thousandth of the diameter of the
atom, so what keeps them so far apart? And what makes atoms stable at
that size? In non-technical accounts, the structure of atoms is
sometimes explained by analogy with the solar system: one imagines
electrons in orbit around the nucleus like planets around the sun. But
that does not match the reality. For one thing, gravitationally bound
objects do slowly spiral in, emitting gravitational radiation (the
process has been observed for binary neutron stars), and the
corresponding electromagnetic process in an atom would be over in a
fraction of a second. For another, the existence of solid matter, which
consists of atoms packed closely together, is evidence that atoms cannot
easily penetrate each other, yet solar systems certainly could.
Furthermore, it turns out that, in the hydrogen atom, the electron in
its lowest-energy state is not orbiting at all but, as I said, just
sitting there like an ink blot – its uncertainty-principle tendency to
spread exactly balanced by the electrostatic force. In this way, the
phenomena of interference and diversity within fungibility are integral
to the structure and stability of all static objects, including all
solid bodies, just as they are integral to all motion.</p>
<p>The term ‘uncertainty principle’ is misleading. Let me stress that it
has nothing to do with uncertainty or any other distressing
psychological sensations that the pioneers of quantum physics might have
felt. When an electron has more than one speed or more than one
position, that has nothing to do with anyone being uncertain what the
speed is, any more than anyone is ‘uncertain’ which dollar in their bank
account belongs to the tax authority. The diversity of attributes in
both cases is a physical fact, independent of what anyone knows or
feels.</p>
<p>Nor, by the way, is the uncertainty principle a ‘principle’, for that
suggests an independent postulate that could logically be dropped or
replaced to obtain a different theory. In fact one could no more drop it
from quantum theory than one could omit eclipses from astronomy. There
is no ‘principle of eclipses’: their existence can be deduced from
theories of much greater generality, such as those of the solar system’s
geometry and dynamics. Similarly, the uncertainty principle is deduced
from the principles of quantum theory.</p>
<p>Thanks to the strong internal interference that it is continuously
undergoing, a typical electron is an irreducibly multiversal object, and
not a collection of parallel-universe or parallel-histories objects.
That is to say, it has multiple positions and multiple speeds without
being divisible into autonomous sub-entities each of which has one speed
and one position. Even different electrons do not have completely
separate identities. So the reality is an electron field throughout the
whole of space, and disturbances spread through this field as waves, at
the speed of light or below. This is what gave rise to the often-quoted
misconception among the pioneers of quantum theory that electrons (and
likewise all other particles) are ‘particles and waves at the same
time’. There is a field (or ‘waves’) in the multiverse for every
individual particle that we observe in a particular universe.</p>
<p>Although quantum theory is expressed in mathematical language, I have
now given an account in English of the main features of the reality that
it describes. So at this point the fictional multiverse that I have been
describing is more or less the real one. But there is one thing left to
tidy up. My ‘succession of speculations’ was based on universes, and on
instances of objects, and then on corrections to those ideas in order to
describe the multiverse. But the real multiverse is not ‘based on’
anything, nor is it a correction to anything. Universes, histories,
particles and their instances are not referred to by quantum theory at
all – any more than are planets, and human beings and their lives and
loves. Those are all approximate, emergent phenomena in the
multiverse.</p>
<p>A history is part of the multiverse in the same sense that a
geological stratum is part of the Earth’s crust. One history is
distinguished from the others by the values of physical variables, just
as a stratum is distinguished from others by its chemical composition
and by the types of fossils found in it and so on. A stratum and a
history are both channels of information flow. They preserve information
because, although their contents change over time, they are
approximately autonomous – that is to say, the changes in a particular
stratum or history depend almost entirely on conditions inside it and
not elsewhere. It is because of that autonomy that a fossil found today
can be used as evidence of what was present when that stratum was
formed. Similarly, it is why, within a history, using classical physics,
one can successfully predict some aspects of the future of that history
from its past.</p>
<p>A stratum, like a history, has no separate existence over and above
the objects in it: it consists of them. Nor does a stratum have
well-defined edges. Also, there are regions of the Earth – for instance,
near volcanoes – where strata have merged (though I think there are no
geological processes that split and remerge strata in the way that
histories split and remerge). There are regions of the Earth – such as
the core – where there have never been strata. And there are regions –
such as the atmosphere – where strata do form but their contents
interact and mix on much shorter timescales than in the crust.
Similarly, there are regions of the multiverse that contain short-lived
histories, and others that do not even approximately contain
histories.</p>
<p>However, there is one big difference between the ways in which strata
and histories emerge from their respective underlying phenomena.
Although not every atom in the Earth’s crust can be unambiguously
assigned to a particular stratum, most of the atoms that form a stratum
can. In contrast, every atom in an everyday object is a multiversal
object, not partitioned into nearly autonomous instances and nearly
autonomous histories, yet everyday objects such as starships and
betrothed couples, which are made of such particles, are partitioned
very accurately into nearly autonomous histories with exactly one
instance, one position, one speed of each object in each history.</p>
<p>That is because of the suppression of interference by entanglement.
As I explained, interference almost always happens either very soon
after splitting or not at all. That is why the larger and more complex
an object or process is, the less its gross behaviour is affected by
interference. At that ‘coarse-grained’ level of emergence, events in the
multiverse consist of autonomous histories, with each coarse-grained
history consisting of a swathe of many histories differing only in
microscopic details but affecting each other through interference.
Spheres of differentiation tend to grow at nearly the speed of light,
so, on the scale of everyday life and above, those coarse-grained
histories can justly be called ‘universes’ in the ordinary sense of the
word. Each of them somewhat resembles the universe of classical physics.
And they can usefully be called ‘parallel’ because they are nearly
autonomous. To the inhabitants, each looks very like a single-universe
world.</p>
<p>Microscopic events which are accidentally amplified to that
coarse-grained level (like the voltage surge in our story) are rare in
any one coarse-grained history, but common in the multiverse as a whole.
For example, consider a single cosmic-ray particle travelling in the
direction of Earth from deep space. That particle must be travelling in
a range of slightly different directions, because the uncertainty
principle implies that in the multiverse it must spread sideways like an
ink blot as it travels. By the time it arrives, this ink blot may well
be wider than the whole Earth – so most of it misses and the rest
strikes everywhere on the exposed surface. Remember, this is just a
single particle, which may consist of fungible instances. The next thing
that happens is that they cease to be fungible, splitting through their
interaction with atoms at their points of arrival into a finite but huge
number of instances, each of which is the origin of a separate
history.</p>
<p>In each such history, there is an autonomous instance of the
cosmic-ray particle, which will dissipate its energy in creating a
‘cosmic-ray shower’ of electrically charged particles. Thus, in
different histories, such a shower will occur at different locations. In
some, that shower will provide a conducting path down which a lightning
bolt will travel. Every atom on the surface of the Earth will be struck
by such lightning in some history. In other histories, one of those
cosmic-ray particles will strike a human cell, damaging some already
damaged DNA in such a way as to make the cell cancerous. Some
non-negligible proportion of all cancers are caused in this way. As a
result, there exist histories in which any given person, alive in our
history at any time, is killed soon afterwards by cancer. There exist
other histories in which the course of a battle, or a war, is changed by
such an event, or by a lightning bolt at exactly the right place and
time, or by any of countless other unlikely, ‘random’ events. This makes
it highly plausible that there exist histories in which events have
played out more or less as in alternative-history stories such as
Fatherland and Roma Eterna – or in which events in your own life played
out very differently, for better or worse.</p>
<p>A great deal of fiction is therefore close to a fact somewhere in the
multiverse. But not all fiction. For instance, there are no histories in
which my stories of the transporter malfunction are true, because they
require different laws of physics. Nor are there histories in which the
fundamental constants of nature such as the speed of light or the charge
on an electron are different. There is, however, a sense in which
different laws of physics appear to be true for a period in some
histories, because of a sequence of ‘unlikely accidents’. (There may
also be universes in which there are different laws of physics, as
required in anthropic explanations of fine-tuning. But as yet there is
no viable theory of such a multiverse.)</p>
<p>Imagine a single photon from a starship’s communication laser,
heading towards Earth. Like the cosmic ray, it arrives all over the
surface, in different histories. In each history, only one atom will
absorb the photon and the rest will initially be completely unaffected.
A receiver for such communications would then detect the relatively
large, discrete change undergone by such an atom. An important
consequence for the construction of measuring devices (including eyes)
is that no matter how far away the source is, the kick given to an atom
by an arriving photon is always the same: it is just that the weaker the
signal is, the fewer kicks there are. If this were not so – for
instance, if classical physics were true – weak signals would be much
more easily swamped by random local noise. This is the same as the
advantage of digital over analogue information processing that I
discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>Some of my own research in physics has been concerned with the theory
of quantum computers. These are computers in which the
information-carrying variables have been protected by a variety of means
from becoming entangled with their surroundings. This allows a new mode
of computation in which the flow of information is not confined to a
single history. In one type of quantum computation, enormous numbers of
different computations, taking place simultaneously, can affect each
other and hence contribute to the output of a computation. This is known
as quantum parallelism.</p>
<p>In a typical quantum computation, individual bits of information are
represented in physical objects known as ‘qubits’ – quantum bits – of
which there is a large variety of physical implementations but always
with two essential features. First, each qubit has a variable that can
take one of two discrete values, and, second, special measures are taken
to protect the qubits from entanglement – such as cooling them to
temperatures close to absolute zero. A typical algorithm using quantum
parallelism begins by causing the information-carrying variables in some
of the qubits to acquire both their values simultaneously. Consequently,
regarding those qubits as a register representing (say) a number, the
number of separate instances of the register as a whole is exponentially
large: two to the power of the number of qubits. Then, for a period,
classical computations are performed, during which waves of
differentiation spread to some of the other qubits – but no further,
because of the special measures that prevent this. Hence, information is
processed separately in each of that vast number of autonomous
histories. Finally, an interference process involving all the affected
qubits combines the information in those histories into a single
history. Because of the intervening computation, which has processed the
information, the final state is not the same as the initial one, as in
the simple interference experiment I discussed above, namely , but is
some function of it, like this:</p>
<p>A typical quantum computation. Y1 . . . Ymany are intermediate
results that depend on the input X. All of them are needed to compute
the output f(X) efficiently.</p>
<p>Just as the starship crew members could achieve the effect of large
amounts of computation by sharing information with their doppelgängers
computing the same function on different inputs, so an algorithm that
makes use of quantum parallelism does the same. But, while the fictional
effect is limited only by starship regulations that we may invent to
suit the plot, quantum computers are limited by the laws of physics that
govern quantum interference. Only certain types of parallel computation
can be performed with the help of the multiverse in this way. They are
the ones for which the mathematics of quantum interference happens to be
just right for combining into a single history the information that is
needed for the final result.</p>
<p>In such computations, a quantum computer with only a few hundred
qubits could perform far more computations in parallel than there are
atoms in the visible universe. At the time of writing, quantum computers
with about ten qubits have been constructed. ‘Scaling’ the technology to
larger numbers is a tremendous challenge for quantum technology, but it
is gradually being met.</p>
<p>I mentioned above that, when a large object is affected by a small
influence, the usual outcome is that the large object is strictly
unaffected. I can now explain why. For example, in the Mach–Zehnder
interferometer, shown earlier, two instances of a single photon travel
on two different paths. On the way, they strike two different mirrors.
Interference will happen only if the photon does not become entangled
with the mirrors – but it will become entangled if either mirror retains
the slightest record that it has been struck (for that would be a
differential effect of the instances on the two different paths). Even a
single quantum of change in the amplitude of the mirror’s vibration on
its supports, for instance, would be enough to prevent the interference
(the subsequent merging of the photon’s two instances).</p>
<p>When one of the instances of the photon bounces off either mirror,
its momentum changes, and hence by the principle of the conservation of
momentum (which holds universally in quantum physics, just as in
classical physics), the mirror’s momentum must change by an equal and
opposite amount. Hence it seems that, in each history, one mirror but
not the other must be left vibrating with slightly more or less energy
after the photon has struck it. That energy change would be a record of
which path the photon took, and hence the mirrors would be entangled
with the photon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, that is not what happens. Remember that, at a
sufficiently fine level of detail, what we crudely see as a single
history of the mirror, resting passively or vibrating gently on its
supports, is actually a vast number of histories with instances of all
its atoms continually splitting and rejoining. In particular, the total
energy of the mirror takes a vast number of possible values around the
average, ‘classical’ one. Now, what happens when a photon strikes the
mirror, changing that total energy by one quantum?</p>
<p>Oversimplifying for a moment, imagine just five of those countless
instances of the mirror, with each instance having a different
vibrational energy ranging from two quanta below the average to two
quanta above it. Each instance of the photon strikes one instance of the
mirror and imparts one additional quantum of energy to it. So, after
that impact, the average energy of the instances of the mirror will have
increased by one quantum, and there will now be instances with energies
ranging from one quantum below the old average to three above. But
since, at this fine level of detail, there is no autonomous history
associated with any of those values of the energy, it is not meaningful
to ask whether an instance of the mirror with a particular energy after
the impact is the same one that previously had that energy. The
objective physical fact is only that, of the five instances of the
mirror, four have energies that were present before, and one does not.
Hence, only that one – whose energy is three quanta higher than the
previous average – carries any record of the impact of the photon. And
that means that in only one-fifth of the universes in which the photon
struck has the wave of differentiation spread to the mirror, and only in
those will subsequent interference between instances of that photon that
have or have not hit the mirror be suppressed.</p>
<p>With realistic numbers, that is more like one in a trillion trillion
– which means that there is only a probability of one in a trillion
trillion that interference will be suppressed. This is considerably
lower than the probability that the experiment will give inaccurate
results due to imperfect measuring instruments, or that it will be
spoiled by a lightning strike.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the arrival of that single quantum of energy, to
see how that discrete change can possibly happen without any
discontinuity. Consider the simplest possible case: an atom absorbs a
photon, including all its energy. This energy transfer does not take
place instantaneously. (Forget anything that you may have read about
‘quantum jumps’: they are a myth.) There are many ways in which it can
happen but the simplest is this. At the beginning of the process, the
atom is in (say) its ‘ground state’, in which its electrons have the
least possible energy allowed by quantum theory. That means that all its
instances (within the relevant coarse-grained history) have that energy.
Assume that they are also fungible. At the end of the process, all those
instances are still fungible, but now they are in the ‘excited state’,
which has one additional quantum of energy. What is the atom like
halfway through the process? Its instances are still fungible, but now
half of them are in the ground state and half in the excited state. It
is as if a continuously variable amount of money changed ownership
gradually from one discrete owner to another.</p>
<p>This mechanism is ubiquitous in quantum physics, and is the general
means by which transitions between discrete states happen in a
continuous way. In classical physics, a ‘tiny effect’ always means a
tiny change in some measurable quantities. In quantum physics, physical
variables are typically discrete and so cannot undergo tiny changes.
Instead, a ‘tiny effect’ means a tiny change in the proportions that
have the various discrete attributes.</p>
<p>This also raises the issue of whether time itself is a continuous
variable. In this discussion I am assuming that it is. However, the
quantum mechanics of time is not yet fully understood, and will not be
until we have a quantum theory of gravity (the unification of quantum
theory with the general theory of relativity), so it may turn out that
things are not as simple as that. One thing we can be fairly sure of,
though, is that, in that theory, different times are a special case of
different universes. In other words, time is an entanglement phenomenon,
which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks – or
of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first
understood by the physicists Don Page and William Wooters, in 1983.</p>
<p>In this full version of the quantum multiverse, how is our
science-fiction story to continue? Almost all the attention that the
quantum theory has attracted, from physicists, philosophers and
science-fiction authors alike, has focused on its parallel-universes
aspect. That is ironic, because it is in the parallel-universe
approximation that the world most resembles that of classical physics,
yet that is the very aspect of quantum theory that many people seem to
find viscerally unacceptable.</p>
<p>Fiction can explore the possibilities opened up by parallel
universes. For instance, since our story is a romance, the characters
may well wonder about their counterparts in other histories. The story
could compare their speculations with what we ‘know’ happened in the
other histories. The character whose spouse’s unfaithfulness was
revealed by a ‘random’ event might wonder whether that event provided a
lucky escape from what was a doomed marriage anyway. Are they still
married in the history in which the unfaithfulness was not subsequently
revealed? Are they still happy? Can it be true happiness if it is ‘based
on a lie’? As we see them speculating on these matters, we see the
‘still married’ history and know the (fictional) fact of the matter.</p>
<p>They might also speculate about less parochial issues. The story
could say that their sun is part of a cluster of dozens of stars, all
within a sphere of a few light-weeks’ radius. This has puzzled their
scientists for decades, since the composition of the stars shows that
they originated from far and wide and became gravitationally bound
through a series of very unlikely coincidences. In most universes, these
scientists calculate, life cannot evolve in such dense star clusters,
because there are too many collisions. So in most universes that contain
humans there are no fleets of starships visiting inhabited star systems
one after another. They have been trying to discover a mechanism by
which the proximity of nearby stars might somehow precipitate the
formation of intelligent life, but they have failed. Should they
consider it just an astronomically unlikely coincidence? But they do not
like leaving things unexplained. Something must have selected them, they
conclude. It did. Those people are not just a story. They are real,
living, thinking human beings, wondering at this very moment where they
came from. But they will never find out. In that one respect, they are
unlucky: they were indeed selected by coincidence. Another way of
putting that is that they were selected by the very story that I am now
telling about them. All fiction that does not violate the laws of
physics is fact.</p>
<p>Some fiction in which the laws of physics appear to be violated is
also fact, somewhere in the multiverse. This involves a subtle issue
about how the multiverse is structured – how histories emerge. A history
is approximately autonomous. If I boil some water in a kettle and make
tea, I am in a history in which I switched on the kettle and the water
became gradually hotter because of the energy being poured into it by
the kettle, causing bubbles to form and so on, and eventually hot tea
forms. That is a history because one can give explanations and make
predictions about it without ever mentioning either that there are other
histories in the multiverse where I chose to make coffee instead or that
the microscopic motion of the water molecules is slightly affected by
parts of the multiverse that are outside that history. It is irrelevant
to that explanation that a small measure of that history differentiates
itself during that process and does other things. In some tiny sliver of
it, the kettle transforms itself into a top hat, and the water into a
rabbit which then hops away, and I get neither tea nor coffee but am
very surprised. That is a history too, after that transformation. But
there is no way of correctly explaining what was happening during it, or
predicting the probabilities, without referring to other parts of the
multiverse – enormously larger parts (i.e. with larger measures) – in
which there was no rabbit. So that history began at the transformation,
and its causal connection with what happened before that cannot be
expressed in history terms but only in multiverse terms.</p>
<p>In simple cases like that, there is a ready-made approximative
language in which we can minimize mention of the rest of the multiverse:
the language of random events. This allows us to acknowledge that most
of the high-level objects concerned still behaved autonomously except
for being affected by something outside themselves – as when I am
affected by the rabbit. This constitutes some continuity between a
history and a previous history from which it split, and we can refer to
the former as a ‘history that has been affected by random events’.
However, this is never literally what has happened: the part of that
‘history’ prior to the ‘random event’ is fungible with the rest of the
broader history and therefore has no separate identity from it: it is
not separately explicable.</p>
<p>But the broader of those two histories still is. That is to say, the
rabbit history is fundamentally different from the tea history, in that
the latter remains very accurately autonomous throughout the period. In
the rabbit history I end up with memories that are identical to what
they would be in a history in which water became a rabbit. But those are
misleading memories. There was no such history; the history containing
those memories began only after the rabbit had formed. For that matter,
there are also places in the multiverse – of far larger measure than
that one – in which only my brain was affected, producing exactly those
memories. In effect, I had a hallucination, caused by random motion of
the atoms in my brain. Some philosophers make a big issue of that sort
of thing, claiming that it casts doubt on the scientific status of
quantum theory, but of course they are empiricists. In reality,
misleading observations, misleading memories and false interpretations
are common even in the mainstreams of history. We have to work hard to
avoid fooling ourselves with them.</p>
<p>So it is not quite true that, for instance, there are histories in
which magic appears to work. There are only histories in which magic
appears to have worked, but will never work again. There are histories
in which I appear to have walked through a wall, because all the atoms
of my body happened to resume their original courses after being
deflected by atoms in the wall. But those histories began at the wall:
the true explanation of what happened involves many other instances of
me and it – or we can roughly explain it in terms of random events of
very low probability. It is a bit like winning a lottery: the winner
cannot properly explain what has just happened without invoking the
existence of many losers. In the multiverse, the losers are other
instances of oneself.</p>
<p>The ‘history’ approximation breaks down completely only when
histories not only split but merge – that is to say, in interference
phenomena. For example, there are certain molecules that exist in two or
more structures at once (a ‘structure’ being an arrangement of atoms,
held together by chemical bonds). Chemists call this phenomenon
‘resonance’ between the two structures, but the molecule is not
alternating between them: it has them simultaneously. There is no way of
explaining the chemical properties of such molecules in terms of a
single structure, because when a ‘resonant’ molecule participates in a
chemical reaction with other molecules, there is quantum
interference.</p>
<p>In science fiction, we have a mandate to speculate, even to levels of
implausibility that would make for quite bad explanations in real
science. But the best explanation of ourselves in real science is that
we – sentient beings in this gigantic, unfamiliar structure in which
material things have no continuity, in which even something as basic as
motion or change is different from anything in our experience – are
embedded in multiversal objects. Whenever we observe anything – a
scientific instrument or a galaxy or a human being – what we are
actually seeing is a single-universe perspective on a larger object that
extends some way into other universes. In some of those universes, the
object looks exactly as it does to us, in others it looks different, or
is absent altogether. What an observer sees as a married couple is
actually just a sliver of a vast entity that includes many fungible
instances of such a couple, together with other instances of them who
are divorced, and others who have never married.</p>
<p>We are channels of information flow. So are histories, and so are all
relatively autonomous objects within histories; but we sentient beings
are extremely unusual channels, along which (sometimes) knowledge grows.
This can have dramatic effects, not only within a history (where it can,
for instance, have effects that do not diminish with distance), but also
across the multiverse. Since the growth of knowledge is a process of
error-correction, and since there are many more ways of being wrong than
right, knowledge-creating entities rapidly become more alike in
different histories than other entities. As far as is known,
knowledge-creating processes are unique in both these respects: all
other effects diminish with distance in space, and become increasingly
different across the multiverse, in the long run.</p>
<p>But that is only as far as is known. Here is an opportunity for some
wild speculations that could inform a science-fiction story. What if
there is something other than information flow that can cause coherent,
emergent phenomena in the multiverse? What if knowledge, or something
other than knowledge, could emerge from that, and begin to have purposes
of its own, and to conform the multiverse to those purposes, as we do?
Could we communicate with it? Presumably not in the usual sense of the
term, because that would be information flow; but perhaps the story
could propose some novel analogue of communication which, like quantum
inference, did not involve sending messages. Would we be trapped in a
war of mutual extermination with such an entity? Or is it possible that
we could nevertheless have something in common with it? Let us shun
parochial resolutions of the issue – such as a discovery that what
bridges the barrier is love, or trust. But let us remember that, just as
we are at the top rank of significance in the great scheme of things,
anything else that could create explanations would be too. And there is
always room at the top.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p>Fungible Identical in every respect.</p>
<p>The world The whole of physical reality.</p>
<p>Multiverse The world, according to quantum theory.</p>
<p>Universe Universes are quasi-autonomous regions of the
multiverse.</p>
<p>History A set of fungible universes, over time. One can also speak of
the history of parts of a universe.</p>
<p>Parallel universes A somewhat misleading way of referring to the
multiverse. Misleading because the universes are not perfectly
‘parallel’ (autonomous), and because the multiverse has much more
structure – especially fungibility, entanglement and the measures of
histories.</p>
<p>Instances In parts of the multiverse that contain universes, each
multiversal object consists approximately of ‘instances’, some
identical, some not, one in each of the universes.</p>
<p>Quantum The smallest possible change in a discrete physical
variable.</p>
<p>Entanglement Information in each multiversal object that determines
which parts (instances) of it can affect which parts of other
multiversal objects.</p>
<p>Decoherence The process of its becoming infeasible to undo the effect
of a wave of differentiation between universes.</p>
<p>Quantum interference Phenomena caused by non-fungible instances of a
multiversal object becoming fungible.</p>
<p>Uncertainty principle The (badly misnamed) implication of quantum
theory that, for any fungible collection of instances of a physical
object, some of their attributes must be diverse.</p>
<p>Quantum computation Computation in which the flow of information is
not confined to a single history.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>The physical world is a multiverse, and its structure is determined
by how information flows in it. In many regions of the multiverse,
information flows in quasi-autonomous streams called histories, one of
which we call our ‘universe’. Universes approximately obey the laws of
classical (pre-quantum) physics. But we know of the rest of the
multiverse, and can test the laws of quantum physics, because of the
phenomenon of quantum interference. Thus a universe is not an exact but
an emergent feature of the multiverse. One of the most unfamiliar and
counter-intuitive things about the multiverse is fungibility. The laws
of motion of the multiverse are deterministic, and apparent randomness
is due to initially fungible instances of objects becoming different. In
quantum physics, variables are typically discrete, and how they change
from one value to another is a multiversal process involving
interference and fungibility.</p>
