<h4 id="the-spark">3 The Spark</h4>
<p>Most ancient accounts of the reality beyond our everyday experience
were not only false, they had a radically different character from
modern ones: they were anthropocentric. That is to say, they centred on
human beings, and more broadly on people – entities with intentions and
human-like thoughts – which included powerful, supernatural people such
as spirits and gods. So, winter might be attributed to someone’s
sadness, harvests to someone’s generosity, natural disasters to
someone’s anger, and so on. Such explanations often involved cosmically
significant beings caring what humans did, or having intentions about
them. This conferred cosmic significance on humans too. Then the
geocentric theory placed humans at the physical hub of the universe as
well. Those two kinds of anthropocentrism – explanatory and geometrical
– made each other more plausible, and, as a result, pre-Enlightenment
thinking was more anthropocentric than we can readily imagine
nowadays.</p>
<p>A notable exception was the science of geometry itself, especially
the system developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid. Its
elegant axioms and modes of reasoning about impersonal entities such as
points and lines would later be an inspiration to many of the pioneers
of the Enlightenment. But until then it had little impact on prevailing
world views. For example, most astronomers were also astrologers:
despite using sophisticated geometry in their work, they believed that
the stars foretold political and personal events on Earth.</p>
<p>Before anything was known about how the world works, trying to
explain physical phenomena in terms of purposeful, human-like thought
and action may have been a reasonable approach. After all, that is how
we explain much of our everyday experience even today: if a jewel is
mysteriously missing from a locked safe, we seek human-level
explanations such as error or theft (or, under some circumstances,
conjuring), not new laws of physics. But that anthropocentric approach
has never yielded any good explanations beyond the realm of human
affairs. In regard to the physical world at large, it was colossally
misconceived. We now know that the patterns of stars and planets in our
night sky have no significance for human affairs. We know that we are
not at the centre of the universe – it does not even have a geometrical
centre. And we know that, although some of the titanic astrophysical
phenomena that I have described played a significant role in our past,
we have never been significant to them. We call a phenomenon significant
(or fundamental) if parochial theories are inadequate to explain it, or
if it appears in the explanation of many other phenomena; so it may seem
that human beings and their wishes and actions are extremely
insignificant in the universe at large.</p>
<p>Anthropocentric misconceptions have also been overturned in every
other fundamental area of science: our knowledge of physics is now
expressed entirely in terms of entities that are as impersonal as
Euclid’s points and lines, such as elementary particles, forces and
spacetime – a four-dimensional continuum with three dimensions of space
and one of time. Their effects on each other are explained not in terms
of feelings and intentions, but through mathematical equations
expressing laws of nature. In biology, it was once thought that living
things must have been designed by a supernatural person, and that they
must contain some special ingredient, a ‘vital principle’, to make them
behave with apparent purposefulness. But biological science discovered
new modes of explanation through such impersonal things as chemical
reactions, genes and evolution. So we now know that living things,
including humans, all consist of the same ingredients as rocks and
stars, and obey the same laws, and that they were not designed by
anyone. Modern science, far from explaining physical phenomena in terms
of the thoughts and intentions of unseen people, considers our own
thoughts and intentions to be aggregates of unseen (though not
un-seeable) microscopic physical processes in our brains.</p>
<p>So fruitful has this abandonment of anthropocentric theories been,
and so important in the broader history of ideas, that
anti-anthropocentrism has increasingly been elevated to the status of a
universal principle, sometimes called the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’:
there is nothing significant about humans (in the cosmic scheme of
things). As the physicist Stephen Hawking put it, humans are ‘just a
chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that’s in orbit round a
typical star on the outskirts of a typical galaxy’. The proviso ‘in the
cosmic scheme of things’ is necessary because the chemical scum
evidently does have a special significance according to values that it
applies to itself, such as moral values. But the Principle says that all
such values are themselves anthropocentric: they explain only the
behaviour of the scum, which is itself insignificant.</p>
<p>It is easy to mistake quirks of one’s own, familiar environment or
perspective (such as the rotation of the night sky) for objective
features of what one is observing, or to mistake rules of thumb (such as
the prediction of daily sunrises) for universal laws. I shall refer to
that sort of error as parochialism.</p>
<p>Anthropocentric errors are examples of parochialism, but not all
parochialism is anthropocentric. For instance, the prediction that the
seasons are in phase all over the world is a parochial error but not an
anthropocentric one: it does not involve explaining seasons in terms of
people.</p>
<p>Another influential idea about the human condition is sometimes given
the dramatic name Spaceship Earth. Imagine a ‘generation ship’ – a
spaceship on a journey so long that many generations of passengers live
out their lives in transit. This has been proposed as a means of
colonizing other star systems. In the Spaceship Earth idea, that
generation ship is a metaphor for the biosphere – the system of all
living things on Earth and the regions they inhabit. Its passengers
represent all humans on Earth. Outside the spaceship, the universe is
implacably hostile, but the interior is a vastly complex life-support
system, capable of providing everything that the passengers need to
thrive. Like the spaceship, the biosphere recycles all waste and, using
its capacious nuclear power plant (the sun), it is completely
self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Just as the spaceship’s life-support system is designed to sustain
its passengers, so the biosphere has the ‘appearance of design’: it
seems highly adapted to sustaining us (claims the metaphor) because we
were adapted to it by evolution. But its capacity is finite: if we
overload it, either by our sheer numbers or by adopting lifestyles too
different from those that we evolved to live (the ones that it is
‘designed’ to support), it will break down. And, like the passengers on
that spaceship, we get no second chances: if our lifestyle becomes too
careless or profligate and we ruin our life-support system, we have
nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>The Spaceship Earth metaphor and the Principle of Mediocrity have
both gained wide acceptance among scientifically minded people – to the
extent of becoming truisms. This is despite the fact that, on the face
of it, they argue in somewhat opposite directions: the Principle of
Mediocrity stresses how typical the Earth and its chemical scum are (in
the sense of being unremarkable), while Spaceship Earth stresses how
untypical they are (in the sense of being uniquely suited to each
other). But when the two ideas are interpreted in broad, philosophical
ways, as they usually are, they can easily converge. Both see themselves
as correcting much the same parochial misconceptions, namely that our
experience of life on Earth is representative of the universe, and that
the Earth is vast, fixed and permanent. They both stress instead that it
is tiny and ephemeral. Both oppose arrogance: the Principle of
Mediocrity opposes the pre-Enlightenment arrogance of believing
ourselves significant in the world; the Spaceship Earth metaphor opposes
the Enlightenment arrogance of aspiring to control the world. Both have
a moral element: we should not consider ourselves significant, they
assert; we should not expect the world to submit indefinitely to our
depredations.</p>
<p>Thus the two ideas generate a rich conceptual framework that can
inform an entire world view. Yet, as I shall explain, they are both
false, even in the straightforward factual sense. And in the broader
sense they are so misleading that, if you were seeking maxims worth
being carved in stone and recited each morning before breakfast, you
could do a lot worse than to use their negations. That is to say, the
truth is that</p>
<p>People are significant in the cosmic scheme of things; and</p>
<p>The Earth’s biosphere is incapable of supporting human life.</p>
<p>Consider Hawking’s remark again. It is true that we are on a
(somewhat) typical planet of a typical star in a typical galaxy. But we
are far from typical of the matter in the universe. For one thing, about
80 per cent of that matter is thought to be invisible ‘dark matter’,
which can neither emit nor absorb light. We currently detect it only
through its indirect gravitational effects on galaxies. Only the
remaining 20 per cent is matter of the type that we parochially call
‘ordinary matter’. It is characterized by glowing continuously. We do
not usually think of ourselves as glowing, but that is another parochial
misconception, due to the limitations of our senses: we emit radiant
heat, which is infra-red light, and also light in the visible range, too
faint for our eyes to detect.</p>
<p>Concentrations of matter as dense as ourselves and our planet and
star, though numerous, are not exactly typical either. They are
isolated, uncommon phenomena. The universe is mostly vacuum (plus
radiation and dark matter). Ordinary matter is familiar to us only
because we are made of it, and because of our untypical location near
large concentrations of it.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are an uncommon form of ordinary matter. The commonest
form is plasma (atoms dissociated into their electrically charged
components), which typically emits bright, visible light because it is
in stars, which are rather hot. We scums are mainly infra-red emitters
because we contain liquids and complex chemicals which can exist only at
a much lower range of temperatures.</p>
<p>The universe is pervaded with microwave radiation – the afterglow of
the Big Bang. Its temperature is about 2.7 kelvin, which means 2.7
degrees above the coldest possible temperature, absolute zero, or about
270 degrees Celsius colder than the freezing point of water. Only very
unusual circumstances can make anything colder than those microwaves.
Nothing in the universe is known to be cooler than about one kelvin –
except in certain physics laboratories on Earth. There, the record low
temperature achieved is below one billionth of a kelvin. At those
extraordinary temperatures, the glow of ordinary matter is effectively
extinguished. The resulting ‘non-glowing ordinary matter’ on our planet
is an exceedingly exotic substance in the universe at large. It may well
be that the interiors of refrigerators constructed by physicists are by
far the coldest and darkest places in the universe. Far from
typical.</p>
<p>What is a typical place in the universe like? Let me assume that you
are reading this on Earth. In your mind’s eye, travel straight upwards a
few hundred kilometres. Now you are in the slightly more typical
environment of space. But you are still being heated and illuminated by
the sun, and half your field of view is still taken up by the solids,
liquids and scums of the Earth. A typical location has none of those
features. So, travel a few trillion kilometres further in the same
direction. You are now so far away that the sun looks like other stars.
You are at a much colder, darker and emptier place, with no scum in
sight. But it is not yet typical: you are still inside the Milky Way
galaxy, and most places in the universe are not in any galaxy. Continue
until you are clear outside the galaxy – say, a hundred thousand light
years from Earth. At this distance you could not glimpse the Earth even
if you used the most powerful telescope that humans have yet built. But
the Milky Way still fills much of your sky. To get to a typical place in
the universe, you have to imagine yourself at least a thousand times as
far out as that, deep in intergalactic space.</p>
<p>What is it like there? Imagine the whole of space notionally divided
into cubes the size of our solar system. If you were observing from a
typical one of them, the sky would be pitch black. The nearest star
would be so far away that if it were to explode as a supernova, and you
were staring directly at it when its light reached you, you would not
see even a glimmer. That is how big and dark the universe is. And it is
cold: it is at that background temperature of 2.7 kelvin, which is cold
enough to freeze every known substance except helium. (Helium is
believed to remain liquid right down to absolute zero, unless highly
pressurized.)</p>
<p>And it is empty: the density of atoms out there is below one per
cubic metre. That is a million times sparser than atoms in the space
between the stars, and those atoms are themselves sparser than in the
best vacuum that human technology has yet achieved. Almost all the atoms
in intergalactic space are hydrogen or helium, so there is no chemistry.
No life could have evolved there, nor any intelligence. Nothing changes
there. Nothing happens. The same is true of the next cube and the next,
and if you were to examine a million consecutive cubes in any direction
the story would be the same.</p>
<p>Cold, dark and empty. That unimaginably desolate environment is
typical of the universe – and is another measure of how untypical the
Earth and its chemical scum are, in a straightforward physical sense.
The issue of the cosmic significance of this type of scum will shortly
take us back out into intergalactic space. But let me first return to
Earth, and consider the Spaceship Earth metaphor, in its straightforward
physical version.</p>
<p>This much is true: if, tomorrow, physical conditions on the Earth’s
surface were to change even slightly by astrophysical standards, then no
humans could live here unprotected, just as they could not survive on a
spaceship whose life-support system had broken down. Yet I am writing
this in Oxford, England, where winter nights are likewise often cold
enough to kill any human unprotected by clothing and other technology.
So, while intergalactic space would kill me in a matter of seconds,
Oxfordshire in its primeval state might do it in a matter of hours –
which can be considered ‘life support’ only in the most contrived sense.
There is a life-support system in Oxfordshire today, but it was not
provided by the biosphere. It has been built by humans. It consists of
clothes, houses, farms, hospitals, an electrical grid, a sewage system
and so on. Nearly the whole of the Earth’s biosphere in its primeval
state was likewise incapable of keeping an unprotected human alive for
long. It would be much more accurate to call it a death trap for humans
rather than a life-support system. Even the Great Rift Valley in eastern
Africa, where our species evolved, was barely more hospitable than
primeval Oxfordshire. Unlike the life-support system in that imagined
spaceship, the Great Rift Valley lacked a safe water supply, and medical
equipment, and comfortable living quarters, and was infested with
predators, parasites and disease organisms. It frequently injured,
poisoned, drenched, starved and sickened its ‘passengers’, and most of
them died as a result.</p>
<p>It was similarly harsh to all the other organisms that lived there:
few individuals live comfortably or die of old age in the supposedly
beneficent biosphere. That is no accident: most populations, of most
species, are living close to the edge of disaster and death. It has to
be that way, because as soon as some small group, somewhere, begins to
have a slightly easier life than that, for any reason – for instance, an
increased food supply, or the extinction of a competitor or predator –
then its numbers increase. As a result, its other resources are depleted
by the increased usage; so an increasing proportion of the population
now has to colonize more marginal habitats and make do with inferior
resources, and so on. This process continues until the disadvantages
caused by the increased population have exactly balanced the advantage
conferred by the beneficial change. That is to say, the new birth rate
is again just barely keeping pace with the rampant disabling and killing
of individuals by starvation, exhaustion, predation, overcrowding and
all those other natural processes.</p>
<p>That is the situation to which evolution adapts organisms. And that,
therefore, is the lifestyle in which the Earth’s biosphere ‘seems
adapted’ to sustaining them. The biosphere only ever achieves stability
– and only temporarily at that – by continually neglecting, harming,
disabling and killing individuals. Hence the metaphor of a spaceship or
a life-support system, is quite perverse: when humans design a
life-support system, they design it to provide the maximum possible
comfort, safety and longevity for its users within the available
resources; the biosphere has no such priorities.</p>
<p>Nor is the biosphere a great preserver of species. In addition to
being notoriously cruel to individuals, evolution involves continual
extinctions of entire species. The average rate of extinction since the
beginning of life on Earth has been about ten species per year (the
number is known only very approximately), becoming much higher during
the relatively brief periods that palaeontologists call ‘mass extinction
events’. The rate at which species have come into existence has on
balance only slightly exceeded the extinction rate, and the net effect
is that the overwhelming majority of species that have ever existed on
Earth (perhaps 99.9 per cent of them) are now extinct. Genetic evidence
suggests that our own species narrowly escaped extinction on at least
one occasion. Several species closely related to ours did become
extinct. Significantly, the ‘life-support system’ itself wiped them out
– by means such as natural disasters, evolutionary changes in other
species, and climate change. Those cousins of ours had not invited
extinction by changing their lifestyles or overloading the biosphere: on
the contrary, it wiped them out because they were living the lifestyles
that they had evolved to live, and in which, according to the Spaceship
Earth metaphor, the biosphere had been ‘supporting’ them.</p>
<p>Yet that still overstates the degree to which the biosphere is
hospitable to humans in particular. The first people to live at the
latitude of Oxford (who were actually from a species related to us,
possibly the Neanderthals) could do so only because they brought
knowledge with them, about such things as tools, weapons, fire and
clothing. That knowledge was transmitted from generation to generation
not genetically but culturally. Our pre-human ancestors in the Great
Rift Valley used such knowledge too, and our own species must have come
into existence already dependent on it for survival. As evidence of
that, note that I would soon die if I tried to live in the Great Rift
Valley in its primeval state: I do not have the requisite knowledge.
Since then, there have been human populations who, for instance, knew
how to survive in the Amazon jungle but not in the Arctic, and
populations for whom it was the other way round. Therefore that
knowledge was not part of their genetic inheritance. It was created by
human thought, and preserved and transmitted in human culture.</p>
<p>Today, almost the entire capacity of the Earth’s ‘life-support system
for humans’ has been provided not for us but by us, using our ability to
create new knowledge. There are people in the Great Rift Valley today
who live far more comfortably than early humans did, and in far greater
numbers, through knowledge of things like tools, farming and hygiene.
The Earth did provide the raw materials for our survival – just as the
sun has provided the energy, and supernovae provided the elements, and
so on. But a heap of raw materials is not the same thing as a
life-support system. It takes knowledge to convert the one into the
other, and biological evolution never provided us with enough knowledge
to survive, let alone to thrive. In this respect we differ from almost
all other species. They do have all the knowledge that they need,
genetically encoded in their brains. And that knowledge was indeed
provided for them by evolution – and so, in the relevant sense, ‘by the
biosphere’. So their home environments do have the appearance of having
been designed as life-support systems for them, albeit only in the
desperately limited sense that I have described. But the biosphere no
more provides humans with a life-support system than it provides us with
radio telescopes.</p>
<p>So the biosphere is incapable of supporting human life. From the
outset, it was only human knowledge that made the planet even marginally
habitable by humans, and the enormously increased capacity of our
life-support system since then (in terms both of numbers and of security
and quality of life) has been entirely due to the creation of human
knowledge. To the extent that we are on a ‘spaceship’, we have never
been merely its passengers, nor (as is often said) its stewards, nor
even its maintenance crew: we are its designers and builders. Before the
designs created by humans, it was not a vehicle, but only a heap of
dangerous raw materials.</p>
<p>The ‘passengers’ metaphor is a misconception in another sense too. It
implies that there was a time when humans lived unproblematically: when
they were provided for, like passengers, without themselves having to
solve a stream of problems in order to survive and to thrive. But in
fact, even with the benefit of their cultural knowledge, our ancestors
continually faced desperate problems, such as where the next meal was
coming from, and typically they barely solved these problems or they
died. There are very few fossils of old people.</p>
<p>The moral component of the Spaceship Earth metaphor is therefore
somewhat paradoxical. It casts humans as ungrateful for gifts which, in
reality, they never received. And it casts all other species in morally
positive roles in the spaceship’s life-support system, with humans as
the only negative actors. But humans are part of the biosphere, and the
supposedly immoral behaviour is identical to what all other species do
when times are good – except that humans alone try to mitigate the
effect of that response on their descendants and on other species.</p>
<p>The Principle of Mediocrity is paradoxical too. Since it singles out
anthropocentrism for special opprobrium among all forms of parochial
misconception, it is itself anthropocentric. Also, it claims that all
value judgements are anthropocentric, yet it itself is often expressed
in value-laden terminology, such as ‘arrogance’, ‘just scum’ and the
very word ‘mediocrity’. With respect to whose values are those
disparagements to be understood? Why is arrogance even relevant as a
criticism? Also, even if holding an arrogant opinion is morally wrong,
morality is supposed to refer only to the internal organization of
chemical scum. So how can it tell us anything about how the world beyond
the scum is organized, as the Principle of Mediocrity purports to
do?</p>
<p>In any case, it was not arrogance that made people adopt
anthropocentric explanations. It was merely a parochial error, and quite
a reasonable one originally. Nor was it arrogance that prevented people
from realizing their mistake for so long: they didn’t realize anything,
because they did not know how to seek better explanations. In a sense
their whole problem was that they were not arrogant enough: they assumed
far too easily that the world was fundamentally incomprehensible to
them.</p>
<p>The misconception that there was once an unproblematic era for humans
is present in ancient myths of a past Golden Age, and of a Garden of
Eden. The theological notions of grace (unearned benefit from God) and
Providence (which is God regarded as the provider of human needs) are
also related to this. In order to connect the supposed unproblematic
past with their own less-than-pleasant experiences, the authors of such
myths had to include some past transition, such as a Fall from Grace
when Providence reduced its level of support. In the Spaceship Earth
metaphor, the Fall from Grace is usually deemed to be imminent or under
way.</p>
<p>The Principle of Mediocrity contains a similar misconception.
Consider the following argument, which is due to the evolutionary
biologist Richard Dawkins: Human attributes, like those of all other
organisms, evolved under natural selection in an ancestral environment.
That is why our senses are adapted to detecting things like the colours
and smell of fruit, or the sound of a predator: being able to detect
such things gave our ancestors a better chance of surviving to have
offspring. But, for the same reason, Dawkins points out, evolution did
not waste our resources on detecting phenomena that were never relevant
to our survival. We cannot, for instance, distinguish between the
colours of most stars with the naked eye. Our night vision is poor and
monochromatic because not enough of our ancestors died of that
limitation to create evolutionary pressure for anything better. So
Dawkins argues – and here he is invoking the Principle of Mediocrity –
that there is no reason to expect our brains to be any different from
our eyes in this regard: they evolved to cope with the narrow class of
phenomena that commonly occur in the biosphere, on approximately human
scales of size, time, energy and so on. Most phenomena in the universe
happen far above or below those scales. Some would kill us instantly;
others could never affect anything in the lives of early humans. So,
just as our senses cannot detect neutrinos or quasars or most other
significant phenomena in the cosmic scheme of things, there is no reason
to expect our brains to understand them. To the extent that they already
do understand them, we have been lucky – but a run of luck cannot be
expected to continue for long. Hence Dawkins agrees with an earlier
evolutionary biologist, John Haldane, who expected that ‘the universe is
not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.’</p>
<p>That is a startling – and paradoxical – consequence of the Principle
of Mediocrity: it says that all human abilities, including the
distinctive ones such as the ability to create new explanations, are
necessarily parochial. That implies, in particular, that progress in
science cannot exceed a certain limit defined by the biology of the
human brain. And we must expect to reach that limit sooner rather than
later. Beyond it, the world stops making sense (or seems to). The answer
to the question that I asked at the end of Chapter 2 – whether the
scientific revolution and the broader Enlightenment could be a beginning
of infinity – would then be a resounding no. Science, for all its
successes and aspirations, would turn out to be inherently parochial –
and, ironically, anthropocentric.</p>
<p>So here the Principle of Mediocrity and Spaceship Earth converge.
They share a conception of a tiny, human-friendly bubble embedded in the
alien and uncooperative universe. The Spaceship Earth metaphor sees it
as a physical bubble, the biosphere. For the Principle of Mediocrity,
the bubble is primarily conceptual, marking the limits of the human
capacity to understand the world. Those two bubbles are related, as we
shall see. In both views, anthropocentrism is true in the interior of
the bubble: there the world is unproblematic, uniquely compliant with
human wishes and human understanding. Outside it there are only
insoluble problems.</p>
<p>Dawkins would prefer it to be otherwise. As he wrote:</p>
<p>I believe that an orderly universe, one indifferent to human
preoccupations, in which everything has an explanation even if we still
have a long way to go before we find it, is a more beautiful, more
wonderful place than a universe tricked out with capricious ad hoc
magic.</p>
<p>Unweaving the Rainbow (1998)</p>
<p>An ‘orderly’ (explicable) universe is indeed more beautiful (see
Chapter 14) – though the assumption that to be orderly it has to be
‘indifferent to human preoccupations’ is a misconception associated with
the Principle of Mediocrity.</p>
<p>Any assumption that the world is inexplicable can lead only to
extremely bad explanations. For an inexplicable world is
indistinguishable from one ‘tricked out with capricious ad hoc magic’:
by definition, no hypothesis about the world outside the bubble of
explicability can be a better explanation than that Zeus rules there –
or practically any myth or fantasy one likes.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the outside of the bubble affects our explanations of
the inside (or else we may as well do without it), the inside is not
really explicable either. It seems so only if we carefully refrain from
asking certain questions. This bears an uncanny resemblance to the
intellectual landscape before the Enlightenment, with its distinction
between Earth and heaven. It is a paradox inherent in the Principle of
Mediocrity: contrary to its motivation, here it is forcing us back to an
archaic, anthropocentric, pre-scientific conception of the world.</p>
<p>At root, the Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth metaphor
overlap in a claim about reach: they both claim that the reach of the
distinctively human way of being – that is to say, the way of
problem-solving, knowledge-creating and adapting the world around us –
is bounded. And they argue that its bounds cannot be very far beyond
what it has already reached. Trying to go beyond that range must lead to
failure and catastrophe respectively.</p>
<p>Both ideas also rely on essentially the same argument, namely that if
there were no such limit, there would be no explanation for the
continued effectiveness of the adaptations of the human brain beyond the
conditions under which they evolved. Why should one adaptation out of
the trillions that have ever existed on Earth have unlimited reach, when
all others reach only inside the tiny, insignificant, untypical
biosphere? Fair enough: all reach has an explanation. But what if there
is an explanation, and what if it has nothing to do with evolution or
the biosphere?</p>
<p>Imagine that a flock of birds from a species that evolved on one
island happens to fly to another. Their wings and eyes still work. That
is an example of the reach of those adaptations. It has an explanation,
the essence of which is that wings and eyes exploit universal laws of
physics (of aerodynamics and optics respectively). They exploit those
laws only imperfectly; but the atmospheric and lighting conditions on
the two islands are sufficiently similar, by the criteria defined by
those laws, for the same adaptations to work on both.</p>
<p>Thus the birds may well be able to fly to an island many kilometres
away horizontally, but if they were transported only a few kilometres
upwards their wings would stop working because the density of the air
would be too low. Their implicit knowledge about how to fly fails at
high altitude. A little further up, their eyes and other organs would
stop working. The design of these too does not have that much reach: all
vertebrate eyes are filled with liquid water, but water freezes at
stratospheric temperatures and boils in the vacuum of space. Less
dramatically, the birds might also die if they merely had no good night
vision and they reached an island where the only suitable prey organisms
were nocturnal. For the same reason, biological adaptations also have
limited reach in regard to changes in their home environment – which can
and do cause extinctions.</p>
<p>If those birds’ adaptations do have enough reach to make the species
viable on the new island, they will set up a colony there. In subsequent
generations, mutants slightly better adapted to the new island will end
up having slightly more offspring on average, so evolution will adapt
the population more accurately to contain the knowledge needed to make a
living there. The ancestor species of humans colonized new habitats and
embarked on new lifestyles in exactly that way. But by the time our
species had evolved, our fully human ancestors were achieving much the
same thing thousands of times faster, by evolving their cultural
knowledge instead. Because they did not yet know how to do science,
their knowledge was only a little less parochial than biological
knowledge. It consisted of rules of thumb. And so progress, though rapid
compared to biological evolution, was sluggish compared to what the
Enlightenment has accustomed us to.</p>
<p>Since the Enlightenment, technological progress has depended
specifically on the creation of explanatory knowledge. People had
dreamed for millennia of flying to the moon, but it was only with the
advent of Newton’s theories about the behaviour of invisible entities
such as forces and momentum that they began to understand what was
needed in order to go there.</p>
<p>This increasingly intimate connection between explaining the world
and controlling it is no accident, but is part of the deep structure of
the world. Consider the set of all conceivable transformations of
physical objects. Some of those (like faster-than-light communication)
never happen because they are forbidden by laws of nature; some (like
the formation of stars out of primordial hydrogen) happen spontaneously;
and some (such as converting air and water into trees, or converting raw
materials into a radio telescope) are possible, but happen only when the
requisite knowledge is present – for instance, embodied in genes or
brains. But those are the only possibilities. That is to say, every
putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time with
given resources or under any other conditions, is either</p>
<p>– impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or</p>
<p>– achievable, given the right knowledge.</p>
<p>That momentous dichotomy exists because if there were transformations
that technology could never achieve regardless of what knowledge was
brought to bear, then this fact would itself be a testable regularity in
nature. But all regularities in nature have explanations, so the
explanation of that regularity would itself be a law of nature, or a
consequence of one. And so, again, everything that is not forbidden by
laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge.</p>
<p>This fundamental connection between explanatory knowledge and
technology is why the Haldane–Dawkins queerer-than-we-can-suppose
argument is mistaken – why the reach of human adaptations does have a
different character from that of all the other adaptations in the
biosphere. The ability to create and use explanatory knowledge gives
people a power to transform nature which is ultimately not limited by
parochial factors, as all other adaptations are, but only by universal
laws. This is the cosmic significance of explanatory knowledge – and
hence of people, whom I shall henceforward define as entities that can
create explanatory knowledge.</p>
<p>For every other species on Earth, we can determine its reach simply
by making a list of all the resources and environmental conditions on
which its adaptations depend. In principle one could determine those
from a study of its DNA molecules – because that is where all its
genetic information is encoded (in the form of sequences of small
constituent molecules called ‘bases’). As Dawkins has pointed out:</p>
<p>A gene pool is carved and whittled through generations of ancestral
natural selection to fit [a particular] environment. In theory a
knowledgeable zoologist, presented with the complete transcript of a
genome [the set of all the genes of an organism], should be able to
reconstruct the environmental circumstances that did the carving. In
this sense the DNA is a coded description of ancestral environments.</p>
<p>In Art Wolfe, The Living Wild, ed. Michelle A. Gilders (2000)</p>
<p>To be precise, the ‘knowledgeable zoologist’ would be able to
reconstruct only those aspects of the organism’s ancestral environment
that exerted selection pressure – such as the types of prey that existed
there, what behaviours would catch them, what chemicals would digest
them and so on. Those are all regularities in the environment. A genome
contains coded descriptions of them, and hence implicitly specifies the
environments in which the organism can survive. For example, all
primates require vitamin C. Without it, they fall ill and die of the
disease scurvy, but their genes do not contain the knowledge of how to
synthesize it. So, whenever any non-human primate is in an environment
that does not supply vitamin C for an extended period, it dies. Any
account that overlooks this fact will overestimate the reach of those
species. Humans are primates, yet their reach has nothing to do with
which environments supply vitamin C. Humans can create and apply new
knowledge of how to cause it to be synthesized from a wide range of raw
materials, by agriculture or in chemical factories. And, just as
essentially, humans can discover for themselves that, in most
environments, they need to do that in order to survive.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether humans could live entirely outside the biosphere –
say, on the moon – does not depend on the quirks of human biochemistry.
Just as humans currently cause over a tonne of vitamin C to appear in
Oxfordshire every week (from their farms and factories), so they could
do the same on the moon – and the same goes for breathable air, water, a
comfortable temperature and all their other parochial needs. Those needs
can all be met, given the right knowledge, by transforming other
resources. Even with present-day technology, it would be possible to
build a self-sufficient colony on the moon, powered by sunlight,
recycling its waste, and obtaining raw materials from the moon itself.
Oxygen is plentiful on the moon in the form of metal oxides in moon
rock. Many other elements could easily be extracted too. Some elements
are rare on the moon, and so in practice these would be supplied from
the Earth, but in principle the colony could be entirely independent of
the Earth if it sent robot space vehicles to mine asteroids for such
elements, or if it manufactured them by transmutation.</p>
<p>I specified robot space vehicles because all technological knowledge
can eventually be implemented in automated devices. This is another
reason that ‘one per cent inspiration and ninety-nine per cent
perspiration’ is a misleading description of how progress happens: the
‘perspiration’ phase can be automated – just as the task of recognizing
galaxies on astronomical photographs was. And the more advanced
technology becomes, the shorter is the gap between inspiration and
automation. The more this happens in the moon colony, the less human
effort will be required to live there. Eventually the moon colonists
will take air for granted, just as the people now living in Oxfordshire
take for granted that water will flow if they turn on a tap. If either
of those populations lacked the right knowledge, their environment would
soon kill them.</p>
<p>We are accustomed to thinking of the Earth as hospitable and the moon
as a bleak, faraway deathtrap. But that is how our ancestors would have
regarded Oxfordshire, and, ironically, it is how I, today, would regard
the primeval Great Rift Valley. In the unique case of humans, the
difference between a hospitable environment and a deathtrap depends on
what knowledge they have created. Once enough knowledge has been
embodied in the lunar colony, the colonists can devote their thoughts
and energies to creating even more knowledge, and soon it will cease to
be a colony and become simply home. No one will think of the moon as a
fringe habitat, distinguished from our ‘natural’ environment on Earth,
any more than we now think of Oxfordshire as being fundamentally
different from the Great Rift Valley as a place to live.</p>
<p>Using knowledge to cause automated physical transformations is, in
itself, not unique to humans. It is the basic method by which all
organisms keep themselves alive: every cell is a chemical factory. The
difference between humans and other species is in what kind of knowledge
they can use (explanatory instead of rule-of-thumb) and in how they
create it (conjecture and criticism of ideas, rather than the variation
and selection of genes). It is precisely those two differences that
explain why every other organism can function only in a certain range of
environments that are hospitable to it, while humans transform
inhospitable environments like the biosphere into support systems for
themselves. And, while every other organism is a factory for converting
resources of a fixed type into more such organisms, human bodies
(including their brains) are factories for transforming anything into
anything that the laws of nature allow. They are ‘universal
constructors’.</p>
<p>This universality in the human condition is part of a broader
phenomenon that I shall discuss in Chapter 6. We do not share it with
any other species currently on Earth. But, since it is a consequence of
the ability to create explanations, we do necessarily share it with any
other people that might exist in the universe. The opportunities
provided by the laws of nature for transforming resources are universal,
and all entities with universal reach necessarily have the same
reach.</p>
<p>A few species other than humans are known to be capable of having
cultural knowledge. For example, some apes can discover new methods of
cracking nuts, and pass that knowledge on to other apes. As I shall
discuss in Chapter 16, the existence of such knowledge is suggestive of
how ape-like species evolved into people. But it is irrelevant to the
arguments of this chapter, because no such organism is capable of
creating or using explanatory knowledge. Hence the cultural knowledge of
such organisms is of essentially the same type as genetic knowledge, and
does indeed have only a small and inherently limited reach. They are not
universal constructors, but highly specialized ones. For them, the
Haldane–Dawkins argument is valid: the world is stranger than they can
conceive.</p>
<p>In some environments in the universe, the most efficient way for
humans to thrive might be to alter their own genes. Indeed, we are
already doing that in our present environment, to eliminate diseases
that have in the past blighted many lives. Some people object to this on
the grounds (in effect) that a genetically altered human is no longer
human. This is an anthropomorphic mistake. The only uniquely significant
thing about humans (whether in the cosmic scheme of things or according
to any rational human criterion) is our ability to create new
explanations, and we have that in common with all people. You do not
become less of a person if you lose a limb in an accident; it is only if
you lose your brain that you do. Changing our genes in order to improve
our lives and to facilitate further improvements is no different in this
regard from augmenting our skin with clothes or our eyes with
telescopes.</p>
<p>One might wonder whether the reach of people in general might be
greater than the reach of humans. What if, for instance, the reach of
technology is indeed unlimited, but only to creatures with two opposable
thumbs on each hand; or if the reach of scientific knowledge is
unlimited, but only to beings whose brains are twice the size of ours?
But our faculty of being universal constructors makes these issues as
irrelevant as that of access to vitamins. If progress at some point were
to depend on having two thumbs per hand, then the outcome would depend
not on the knowledge we inherit in our genes, but on whether we could
discover how to build robots, or gloves, with two thumbs per hand, or
alter ourselves to have a second thumb. If it depends on having more
memory capacity, or speed, than a human brain, then the outcome would
depend on whether we could build computers to do the job. Again, such
things are already commonplace in technology.</p>
<p>The astrophysicist Martin Rees has speculated that somewhere in the
universe ‘there could be life and intelligence out there in forms we
can’t conceive. Just as a chimpanzee can’t understand quantum theory, it
could be there are aspects of reality that are beyond the capacity of
our brains.’ But that cannot be so. For if the ‘capacity’ in question is
mere computational speed and amount of memory, then we can understand
the aspects in question with the help of computers – just as we have
understood the world for centuries with the help of pencil and paper. As
Einstein remarked, ‘My pencil and I are more clever than I.’ In terms of
computational repertoire, our computers – and brains – are already
universal (see Chapter 6). But if the claim is that we may be
qualitatively unable to understand what some other forms of intelligence
can – if our disability cannot be remedied by mere automation – then
this is just another claim that the world is not explicable. Indeed, it
is tantamount to an appeal to the supernatural, with all the
arbitrariness that is inherent in such appeals, for if we wanted to
incorporate into our world view an imaginary realm explicable only to
superhumans, we need never have bothered to abandon the myths of
Persephone and her fellow deities.</p>
<p>So human reach is essentially the same as the reach of explanatory
knowledge itself. An environment is within human reach if it is possible
to create an open-ended stream of explanatory knowledge there. That
means that if knowledge of a suitable kind were instantiated in such an
environment in suitable physical objects, it would cause itself to
survive and would then continue to increase indefinitely. Can there
really be such an environment? This is essentially the question that I
asked at the end of the last chapter – can this creativity continue
indefinitely? – and it is the question to which the Spaceship Earth
metaphor assumes a negative answer.</p>
<p>The issue comes down to this: if such an environment can exist, what
are the minimal physical features that it must have? Access to matter is
one. For example, the trick of extracting oxygen from moon rocks depends
on having compounds of oxygen available. With more advanced technology,
one could manufacture oxygen by transmutation; but, no matter how
advanced one’s technology is, one still needs raw materials of some
sort. And, although mass can be recycled, creating an open-ended stream
of knowledge depends on having an ongoing supply of it, both to make up
for inevitable inefficiencies and to make the additional memory capacity
to store new knowledge as it is created.</p>
<p>Also, many of the necessary transformations require energy: something
must power conjectures and scientific experiments and all those
manufacturing processes; and, again, the laws of physics forbid the
creation of energy from nothing. So access to an energy supply is also a
necessity. To some extent, energy and mass can be transformed into each
other. For instance, transmuting hydrogen into any other element
releases energy through nuclear fusion. Energy can also be converted
into mass by various subatomic processes (but I cannot imagine naturally
occurring circumstances in which those would be the best way of
obtaining matter).</p>
<p>In addition to matter and energy, there is one other essential
requirement, namely evidence: the information needed to test scientific
theories. The Earth’s surface is rich in evidence. We happened to get
round to testing Newton’s laws in the seventeenth century, and
Einstein’s in the twentieth, but the evidence with which we did that –
light from the sky – had been deluging the surface of the Earth for
billions of years before that, and will continue to do so for billions
more. Even today we have barely begun to examine that evidence: on any
clear night, the chances are that your roof will be struck by evidence
falling from the sky which, if you only knew what to look for and how,
would win you a Nobel prize. In chemistry, every stable element that
exists anywhere is also present on or just below the Earth’s surface. In
biology, copious evidence of the nature of life is ubiquitous in the
biosphere – and within arm’s reach, in our own DNA. As far as we know,
all the fundamental constants of nature can be measured here, and every
fundamental law can be tested here. Everything needed for the open-ended
creation of knowledge is here in abundance, in the Earth’s
biosphere.</p>
<p>And the same is true of the moon. It has essentially the same
resources of mass, energy and evidence as the Earth has. Parochial
details differ, but the fact that humans living on the moon will have to
make their own air is no more significant than the fact that
laboratories on Earth have to make their own vacuum. Both tasks can be
automated so as to require arbitrarily little human effort or attention.
Likewise, because humans are universal constructors, every problem of
finding or transforming resources can be no more than a transient factor
limiting the creation of knowledge in a given environment. And therefore
matter, energy and evidence are the only requirements that an
environment needs to have in order to be a venue for open-ended
knowledge creation.</p>
<p>Though any particular problem is a transient factor, the condition of
having to solve problems in order to survive and continue to create
knowledge is permanent. I have mentioned that there has never been an
unproblematic time for humans; that applies as much to the future as to
the past. Today on Earth, in the short run, there are still countless
problems to be solved to eliminate even starvation and other forms of
extreme human suffering that date back to prehistory. On a timescale of
decades, we shall be faced with choices to make substantial
modifications to the biosphere, or to keep it the same, or anything in
between. Whichever option we choose, it will be a project of planet-wide
control, requiring the creation of a great deal of scientific and
technological knowledge as well as knowledge about how to make such
decisions rationally (see Chapter 13). In the even longer run, it is not
only our comfort and aesthetic sensibilities, and the suffering of
individuals, that are problematic, but, as always, the survival of our
species. For instance, at present during any given century there is
about one chance in a thousand that the Earth will be struck by a comet
or asteroid large enough to kill at least a substantial proportion of
all human beings. That means that a typical child born in the United
States today is more likely to die as a result of an astronomical event
than a car accident. Both are very low-probability events, but, unless
we create a great deal more scientific and technological knowledge than
we have now, we shall have no defence against those and other forms of
natural disaster that must, eventually, strike. Arguably there are more
immediate existential threats too – see Chapter 9.</p>
<p>Setting up self-sufficient colonies on the moon and elsewhere in the
solar system – and eventually in other solar systems – will be a good
hedge against the extinction of our species or the destruction of
civilization, and is a highly desirable goal for that reason among
others. As Hawking has said:</p>
<p>I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years,
unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can
befall life on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out
to the stars.</p>
<p>Daily Telegraph, 16 October 2001</p>
<p>But even that will be far from an unproblematic state. And most
people are not satisfied merely to be confident in the survival of the
species: they want to survive personally. Also, like our earliest human
ancestors, they want to be free from physical danger and suffering. In
future, as various causes of suffering and death such as disease and
ageing are successively addressed and eliminated, and human life spans
increase, people will care about ever longer-term risks.</p>
<p>In fact people will always want still more than that: they will want
to make progress. For, in addition to threats, there will always be
problems in the benign sense of the word: errors, gaps, inconsistencies
and inadequacies in our knowledge that we wish to solve – including, not
least, moral knowledge: knowledge about what to want, what to strive
for. The human mind seeks explanations; and now that we know how to find
them, we are not going to stop voluntarily. Here is another
misconception in the Garden of Eden myth: that the supposed
unproblematic state would be a good state to be in. Some theologians
have denied this, and I agree with them: an unproblematic state is a
state without creative thought. Its other name is death.</p>
<p>All those kinds of problem (survival-related, progress-related,
moral, and sheer-curiosity-driven problems) are connected. We can, for
instance, expect that our ability to cope with existential threats will
continue to depend on knowledge that was originally created for its own
sake. And we can expect disagreements about goals and values always to
exist, because, among other reasons, moral explanations depend partly on
facts about the physical world. For instance, the moral stances in the
Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth idea depend on the
physical world not being explicable in the sense that I have argued it
must be.</p>
<p>Nor will we ever run out of problems. The deeper an explanation is,
the more new problems it creates. That must be so, if only because there
can be no such thing as an ultimate explanation: just as ‘the gods did
it’ is always a bad explanation, so any other purported foundation of
all explanations must be bad too. It must be easily variable because it
cannot answer the question: why that foundation and not another? Nothing
can be explained only in terms of itself. That holds for philosophy just
as it does for science, and in particular it holds for moral philosophy:
no utopia is possible, but only because our values and our objectives
can continue to improve indefinitely.</p>
<p>Thus fallibilism alone rather understates the error-prone nature of
knowledge-creation. Knowledge-creation is not only subject to error:
errors are common, and significant, and always will be, and correcting
them will always reveal further and better problems. And so the maxim
that I suggested should be carved in stone, namely ‘The Earth’s
biosphere is incapable of supporting human life’ is actually a special
case of a much more general truth, namely that, for people, problems are
inevitable. So let us carve that in stone:</p>
<p>It is inevitable that we face problems, but no particular problem is
inevitable. We survive, and thrive, by solving each problem as it comes
up. And, since the human ability to transform nature is limited only by
the laws of physics, none of the endless stream of problems will ever
constitute an impassable barrier. So a complementary and equally
important truth about people and the physical world is that problems are
soluble. By ‘soluble’ I mean that the right knowledge would solve them.
It is not, of course, that we can possess knowledge just by wishing for
it; but it is in principle accessible to us. So let us carve that in
stone too:</p>
<p>That progress is both possible and desirable is perhaps the
quintessential idea of the Enlightenment. It motivates all traditions of
criticism, as well as the principle of seeking good explanations. But it
can be interpreted in two almost opposite ways, both of which,
confusingly, are known as ‘perfectibility’. One is that humans, or human
societies, are capable of attaining a state of supposed perfection –
such as the Buddhist or Hindu ‘nirvana’, or various political utopias.
The other is that every attainable state can be indefinitely improved.
Fallibilism rules out that first position in favour of the second.
Neither the human condition in particular nor our explanatory knowledge
in general will ever be perfect, nor even approximately perfect. We
shall always be at the beginning of infinity.</p>
<p>These two interpretations of human progress and perfectibility have
historically inspired two broad branches of the Enlightenment which,
though they share attributes such as their rejection of authority, are
so different in important respects in that it is most unfortunate that
they share the same name. The utopian ‘Enlightenment’ is sometimes
called the Continental (European) Enlightenment to distinguish it from
the more fallibilist British Enlightenment, which began a little earlier
and took a very different course. (See, for instance, the historian Roy
Porter’s book Enlightenment.) In my terminology, the Continental
Enlightenment understood that problems are soluble but not that they are
inevitable, while the British Enlightenment understood both equally.
Note that this is a classification of ideas, not of nations or even
individual thinkers: not all Enlightenment thinkers belong wholly to one
branch or the other; nor were all thinkers of the respective
Enlightenments born in the eponymous part of the world. The
mathematician and philosopher Nicholas de Condorcet, for instance, was
French yet belonged more to what I am calling the ‘British’
Enlightenment, while Karl Popper, the twentieth century’s foremost
proponent of the British Enlightenment, was born in Austria.</p>
<p>The Continental Enlightenment was impatient for the perfected state –
which led to intellectual dogmatism, political violence and new forms of
tyranny. The French Revolution of 1789 and the Reign of Terror that
followed it are the archetypal examples. The British Enlightenment,
which was evolutionary and cognizant of human fallibility, was impatient
for institutions that did not stifle gradual, continuing change. It was
also enthusiastic for small improvements, unbounded in the future. (See,
for instance, the historian Jenny Uglow’s book Lunar Men.) This is, I
believe, the movement that was successful in its pursuit of progress, so
in this book when I refer to ‘the’ Enlightenment I mean the ‘British’
one.</p>
<p>To investigate the ultimate reach of humans (or of people, or of
progress), we should not be considering places like the Earth and the
moon, which are unusually rich in resources. Let us go back to that
typical place. While the Earth is inundated with matter, energy and
evidence, out there in intergalactic space all three are at their lowest
possible supply. There is no rich supply of minerals, no vast nuclear
reactor overhead delivering free energy, no lights in the sky or diverse
local events to provide evidence of the laws of nature. It is empty,
cold and dark.</p>
<p>Or is it? Actually, that is yet another parochial misconception.
Intergalactic space is indeed very empty by human standards. But each of
those solar-system-sized cubes still contains over a billion tonnes of
matter – mostly in the form of ionized hydrogen. A billion tonnes is
more than enough mass to build, say, a space station and a colony of
scientists creating an open-ended stream of knowledge – if anyone were
present who knew how to do that.</p>
<p>No human today knows how. For instance, one would first have to
transmute some of the hydrogen into other elements. Collecting it from
such a diffuse source would be far beyond us at present. And, although
some types of transmutation are already routine in the nuclear industry,
we do not know how to transmute hydrogen into other elements on an
industrial scale. Even a simple nuclear-fusion reactor is currently
beyond our technology. But physicists are confident that it is not
forbidden by any laws of physics, in which case, as always, it can only
be a matter of knowing how.</p>
<p>No doubt a billion-tonne space station is not large enough to thrive
in the very long run. The inhabitants will want to enlarge it. But that
presents no problem of principle. As soon as they started to trawl their
cube for hydrogen, more would drift in from the surrounding space,
supplying the cube with millions of tonnes of hydrogen per year. (There
is also believed to be an even greater mass of ‘dark matter’ in the
cube, but we do not know how to do anything useful with it, so let us
ignore it in this thought experiment.)</p>
<p>As for the cold, and the lack of available energy – as I said, the
transmutation of hydrogen releases the energy of nuclear fusion. That
would be a sizeable power supply, orders of magnitude more than the
combined power consumption of everyone on Earth today. So the cube is
not as lacking in resources as a parochial first glance would
suggest.</p>
<p>How would the space station get its vital supply of evidence? Using
the elements created by transmutation, one could construct scientific
laboratories, as in the projected moon base. On Earth, when chemistry
was in its infancy, making discoveries often depended on travelling all
over the planet to find materials to experiment on. But transmutation
makes that irrelevant; and chemical laboratories on the space station
would be able to synthesize arbitrary compounds of arbitrary elements.
The same is true of elementary particle physics: in that field, almost
anything will do as a source of evidence, because every atom is
potentially a cornucopia of particles just waiting to display themselves
if one hits the atom hard enough (using a particle accelerator) and
observes with the right instruments. In biology, DNA and all other
biochemical molecules could be synthesized and experimented on. And,
although biology field trips would be difficult (because the closest
natural ecosystem would be millions of light years away), arbitrary life
forms could be created and studied in artificial ecosystems, or in
virtual-reality simulations of them. As for astronomy – the sky there is
pitch black to the human eye, but to an observer with a telescope, even
one of present-day design, it would be packed with galaxies. A somewhat
bigger telescope could see stars in those galaxies in sufficient detail
to test most of our present-day theories of astrophysics and
cosmology.</p>
<p>Even aside from those billion tonnes of matter, the cube is not
empty. It is full of faint light, and the amount of evidence in that
light is staggering: enough to construct a map of every star, planet and
moon in all the nearest galaxies to a resolution of about ten
kilometres. To extract that evidence in full, the telescope would need
to use something like a mirror of the same width as the cube itself,
which would require at least as much matter as building a planet. But
even that would not be beyond the bounds of possibility, given the level
of technology we are considering. To gather that much matter, those
intergalactic scientists would merely have to trawl out to a distance of
a few thousand cube-widths – still a piffling distance by intergalactic
standards. But even with a mere million-tonne telescope they could do a
lot of astronomy. The fact that planets with tilted axes have annual
seasons would be plain to see. They could detect life if it was present
on any of the planets, via the composition of its atmosphere. With more
subtle measurements they could test theories about the nature and
history of life – or intelligence – on the planet. At any instant, a
typical cube contains evidence, at that level of detail, about more than
a trillion stars and their planets, simultaneously.</p>
<p>And that is only one instant. Additional evidence of all those kinds
is pouring into the cube all the time, so astronomers there could track
changes in the sky just as we do. And visible light is only one band of
the electromagnetic spectrum. The cube is receiving evidence in every
other band too – gamma rays, X-rays, all the way down to the microwave
background radiation and radio waves, as well as a few cosmic-ray
particles. In short, nearly all the channels by which we on Earth
currently receive evidence about any of the fundamental sciences are
available in intergalactic space too.</p>
<p>And they carry much the same content: not only is the universe full
of evidence, it is full of the same evidence everywhere. All people in
the universe, once they have understood enough to free themselves from
parochial obstacles, face essentially the same opportunities. This is an
underlying unity in the physical world more significant than all the
dissimilarities I have described between our environment and a typical
one: the fundamental laws of nature are so uniform, and evidence about
them so ubiquitous, and the connections between understanding and
control so intimate, that, whether we are on our parochial home planet
or a hundred million light years away in the intergalactic plasma, we
can do the same science and make the same progress.</p>
<p>So a typical location in the universe is amenable to the open-ended
creation of knowledge. And therefore so are almost all other kinds of
environment, since they have more matter, more energy and easier access
to evidence than intergalactic space. The thought experiment considered
almost the worst possible case. Perhaps the laws of physics do not allow
knowledge-creation inside, say, the jet of a quasar. Or perhaps they do.
But either way, in the universe at large, knowledge-friendliness is the
rule, not the exception. That is to say, the rule is person-friendliness
to people who have the relevant knowledge. Death is the rule for those
who do not. These are the same rules that prevailed in the Great Rift
Valley from whence we came, and have prevailed ever since.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, that quixotic space station in our thought experiment
is none other than the ‘generation ship’ in the Spaceship Earth metaphor
– except that we have removed the unrealistic assumption that the
inhabitants never improve it. Hence presumably they have long since
solved the problem of how to avoid dying, and so ‘generations’ are no
longer essential to the way their ship works. In any case, with
hindsight, a generation ship was a poor choice for dramatizing the claim
that the human condition is fragile and dependent on support from an
unaltered biosphere, for that claim is contradicted by the very
possibility of such a spaceship. If it is possible to live indefinitely
in a spaceship in space, then it would be much more possible to use the
same technology to live on the surface of the Earth – and to make
continuing progress which would make it ever easier. It would make
little practical difference whether the biosphere had been ruined or
not. Whether or not it could support any other species, it could
certainly accommodate people – including humans – if they had the right
knowledge.</p>
<p>Now I can turn to the significance of knowledge – and therefore of
people – in the cosmic scheme of things.</p>
<p>Many things are more obviously significant than people. Space and
time are significant because they appear in almost all explanations of
other physical phenomena. Similarly, electrons and atoms are
significant. Humans seem to have no place in that exalted company. Our
history and politics, our science, art and philosophy, our aspirations
and moral values – all these are tiny side effects of a supernova
explosion a few billion years ago, which could be extinguished tomorrow
by another such explosion. Supernovae, too, are moderately significant
in the cosmic scheme of things. But it seems that one can explain
everything about supernovae, and almost everything else, without ever
mentioning people or knowledge at all.</p>
<p>However, that is merely another parochial error, due to our current,
untypical, vantage point in an Enlightenment that is mere centuries old.
In the longer run, humans may colonize other solar systems and, by
increasing their knowledge, control ever more powerful physical
processes. If people ever choose to live near a star that is capable of
exploding, they may well wish to prevent such an explosion – probably by
removing some of the material from the star. Such a project would use
many orders of magnitude more energy than humans currently control, and
more advanced technology as well. But it is a fundamentally simple task,
not requiring any steps that are even close to limits imposed by the
laws of physics. So, with the right knowledge, it could be achieved.
Indeed, for all we know, engineers elsewhere in the universe are already
achieving it routinely. And consequently it is not true that the
attributes of supernovae in general are independent of the presence or
absence of people, or of what those people know and intend.</p>
<p>More generally, if we want to predict what a star will do, we first
have to guess whether there are any people near it, and, if so, what
knowledge they may have and what they may want to achieve. Outside our
parochial perspective, astrophysics is incomplete without a theory of
people, just as it is incomplete without a theory of gravity or nuclear
reactions. Note that this conclusion does not depend on the assumption
that humans, or anyone, will colonize the galaxy and take control of any
supernovae: the assumption that they will not is equally a theory about
the future behaviour of knowledge. Knowledge is a significant phenomenon
in the universe, because to make almost any prediction about
astrophysics one must take a position about what types of knowledge will
or will not be present near the phenomena in question. So all
explanations of what is out there in the physical world mention
knowledge and people, if only implicitly.</p>
<p>But knowledge is more significant even than that. Consider any
physical object – for instance, a solar system, or a microscopic chip of
silicon – and then consider all the transformations that it is
physically possible for it to undergo. For instance, the silicon chip
might be melted and solidify in a different shape, or be transformed
into a chip with different functionality. The solar system might be
devastated when its star becomes a supernova, or life might evolve on
one of its planets, or it might be transformed, using transmutation and
other futuristic technologies, into microprocessors. In all cases, the
class of transformations that could happen spontaneously – in the
absence of knowledge – is negligibly small compared with the class that
could be effected artificially by intelligent beings who wanted those
transformations to happen. So the explanations of almost all physically
possible phenomena are about how knowledge would be applied to bring
these phenomena about. If you want to explain how an object might
possibly reach a temperature of ten degrees or a million, you can refer
to spontaneous processes and can avoid mentioning people explicitly
(even though most processes at those temperatures can be brought about
only by people). But if you want to explain how an object might possibly
cool down to a millionth of a degree above absolute zero, you cannot
avoid explaining in detail what people would do.</p>
<p>And that is still only the least of it. In your mind’s eye, continue
your journey from that point in intergalactic space to another, at least
ten times as far away. Our destination this time is inside one of the
jets of a quasar. What would it be like in one of those jets? Language
is barely capable of expressing it: it would be rather like facing a
supernova explosion at point-blank range, but for millions of years at a
time. The survival time for a human body would be measured in
picoseconds. As I said, it is unclear whether the laws of physics permit
any knowledge to grow there, let alone a life-support system for humans.
It is about as different from our ancestral environment as it could
possibly be. The laws of physics that explain it bear no resemblance to
any rules of thumb that were ever in our ancestors’ genes or in their
culture. Yet human brains today know in considerable detail what is
happening there.</p>
<p>Somehow that jet happens in such a way that billions of years later,
on the other side of the universe, a chemical scum can know and predict
what the jet will do, and can understand why. That means that one
physical system – say, an astrophysicist’s brain – contains an accurate
working model of the other, the jet. Not just a superficial image
(though it contains that as well), but an explanatory theory that
embodies the same mathematical relationships and causal structure. That
is scientific knowledge. Furthermore, the faithfulness with which the
one structure resembles the other is steadily increasing. That
constitutes the creation of knowledge. Here we have physical objects
very unlike each other, and whose behaviour is dominated by different
laws of physics, embodying the same mathematical and causal structures –
and doing so ever more accurately over time. Of all the physical
processes that can occur in nature, only the creation of knowledge
exhibits that underlying unity.</p>
<p>In Arecibo, Puerto Rico, there is a giant radio telescope, one of
whose many uses is in the Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence
(SETI). In an office in a building near the telescope there is a small
domestic refrigerator. Inside that refrigerator is a bottle of
champagne, sealed by a cork. Consider that cork.</p>
<p>It is going to be removed from the bottle if and when SETI succeeds
in its mission to detect radio signals transmitted by an
extraterrestrial intelligence. Hence, if you were to keep a careful
watch on the cork, and one day saw it popping from the bottle, you could
infer that an extraterrestrial intelligence exists. The configuration of
the cork is what experimentalists call a ‘proxy’: a physical variable
which can be measured as a way of measuring another variable. (All
scientific measurements involve chains of proxies.) Thus we can also
regard the entire Arecibo observatory, including its staff and that
bottle and its cork, as a scientific instrument to detect distant
people.</p>
<p>The behaviour of that humble cork is therefore extraordinarily
difficult to explain or predict. To predict it, you have to know whether
there really are people sending radio signals from various solar
systems. To explain it, you have to explain how you know about those
people and their attributes. Nothing less than that specific knowledge,
which depends among other things on subtle properties of the chemistry
on the planets of distant stars, can explain or predict with any
accuracy whether, and when, that cork will pop.</p>
<p>The SETI instrument is also remarkably finely tuned to its purpose.
Completely insensitive to the presence of several tonnes of people a few
metres away, and even to the tens of millions of tonnes of people on the
same planet, it detects only people on planets orbiting other stars, and
only if they are radio engineers. No other type of phenomenon on Earth,
or in the universe, is sensitive to what people are doing at locations
hundreds of light years away, let alone with that enormous degree of
discrimination.</p>
<p>This is made possible in part by the corresponding fact that few
types of matter are as prominent, at those distances, as that type of
scum. Specifically, the only phenomena that our best current instruments
can detect at stellar distances are (1) extraordinarily luminous ones
such as stars (or, to be precise, only their surfaces); (2) a few
objects that obscure our view of those luminous objects; and (3) the
effects of certain types of knowledge. We can detect devices such as
lasers and radio transmitters that have been designed for the purpose of
communication; and we can detect components of planetary atmospheres
that could not be present in the absence of life. Thus those types of
knowledge are among the most prominent phenomena in the universe.</p>
<p>Note also that the SETI instrument is exquisitely adapted to
detecting something that has never yet been detected. Biological
evolution could never produce such an adaptation. Only scientific
knowledge can. This illustrates why non-explanatory knowledge cannot be
universal. Like all science, the SETI project can conjecture the
existence of something, calculate what some of its observable attributes
would be, and then construct an instrument to detect it. Non-explanatory
systems cannot cross the conceptual gap that an explanatory conjecture
crosses, to engage with unexperienced evidence or non-existent
phenomena. Nor is that true only of fundamental science: if
such-and-such a load were put on the proposed bridge it would collapse,
says the engineer, and such statements can be true and immensely
valuable even if the bridge is never even built, let alone subjected to
such a load.</p>
<p>Similar champagne bottles are stored in other laboratories. The
popping of each such cork signals a discovery about something
significant in the cosmic scheme of things. Thus the study of the
behaviour of champagne corks and other proxies for what people do is
logically equivalent to the study of everything significant. It follows
that humans, people and knowledge are not only objectively significant:
they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature – the only ones
whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding everything of
fundamental importance.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the enormous difference between how an environment
will behave spontaneously (that is to say, in the absence of knowledge)
and how it behaves once a tiny sliver of knowledge, of just the right
kind, has reached it. We would normally regard a lunar colony, even
after it has become self-sufficient, as having originated on Earth. But
what, exactly, will have originated on Earth? In the long run, all its
atoms have originated on the moon (or the asteroids). All the energy
that it uses has originated in the sun. Only some proportion of its
knowledge came from Earth, and, in the hypothetical case of a perfectly
isolated colony, that would be a rapidly dwindling proportion. What has
happened, physically, is that the moon has been changed – initially only
minimally – by matter that came from the Earth. And what made the
difference was not the matter, but the knowledge that it encoded. In
response to that knowledge, the substance of the moon reorganized itself
in a new, increasingly extensive and complex way, and started to create
an indefinitely long stream of ever-improving explanations. A beginning
of infinity.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the intergalactic thought experiment, we imagined
‘priming’ a typical cube, and as a result intergalactic space itself
began to produce a stream of ever-improving explanations. Notice how
different, physically, the transformed cube is from a typical one. A
typical cube has about the same mass as any of the millions of nearby
cubes, and that mass barely changes over many millions of years. The
transformed cube is more massive than its neighbours, and its mass is
increasing continuously as the inhabitants systematically capture matter
and use it to embody knowledge. The mass of a typical cube is spread
thinly throughout its whole volume; most of the mass of the transformed
cube is concentrated at its centre. A typical cube contains mostly
hydrogen; the transformed cube contains every element. A typical cube is
not producing any energy; the transformed cube is converting mass to
energy at a substantial rate. A typical cube is full of evidence, but
most of it is just passing through, and none of it ever causes any
changes. The transformed cube contains even more evidence, most of it
having been created locally, and is detecting it with ever-improving
instruments and changing rapidly as a result. A typical cube is not
emitting any energy; the transformed cube may well be broadcasting
explanations into space. But perhaps the biggest physical difference is
that, like all knowledge-creating systems, the transformed cube corrects
errors. You would notice this if you tried to modify or harvest the
matter in it: it would resist!</p>
<p>It appears, nevertheless, that most environments are not yet creating
any knowledge. We know of none that is, except on or near the Earth, and
what we see happening elsewhere is radically different from what would
happen if knowledge-creation were to become widespread. But the universe
is still young. An environment that is not currently creating anything
may do so in the future. What will be typical in the distant future
could be very different from what is typical now.</p>
<p>Like an explosive awaiting a spark, unimaginably numerous
environments in the universe are waiting out there, for aeons on end,
doing nothing at all or blindly generating evidence and storing it up or
pouring it out into space. Almost any of them would, if the right
knowledge ever reached it, instantly and irrevocably burst into a
radically different type of physical activity: intense
knowledge-creation, displaying all the various kinds of complexity,
universality and reach that are inherent in the laws of nature, and
transforming that environment from what is typical today into what could
become typical in the future. If we want to, we could be that spark.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p>Person An entity that can create explanatory knowledge.</p>
<p>Anthropocentric Centred on humans, or on persons.</p>
<p>Fundamental or significant phenomenon: One that plays a necessary
role in the explanation of many phenomena, or whose distinctive features
require distinctive explanation in terms of fundamental theories.</p>
<p>Principle of Mediocrity ‘There is nothing significant about
humans.’</p>
<p>Parochialism Mistaking appearance for reality, or local regularities
for universal laws.</p>
<p>Spaceship Earth ‘The biosphere is a life-support system for
humans.’</p>
<p>Constructor A device capable of causing other objects to undergo
transformations without undergoing any net change itself.</p>
<p>Universal constructor A constructor that can cause any raw materials
to undergo any physically possible transformation, given the right
information.</p>
<p>MEANINGS OF ‘THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY’ ENCOUNTERED IN THIS
CHAPTER</p>
<p>– The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is
achievable, given the right knowledge. ‘Problems are soluble.’</p>
<p>– The ‘perspiration’ phase can always be automated.</p>
<p>– The knowledge-friendliness of the physical world.</p>
<p>– People are universal constructors.</p>
<p>– The beginning of the open-ended creation of explanations.</p>
<p>– The environments that could create an open-ended stream of
knowledge, if suitably primed – i.e. almost all environments.</p>
<p>– The fact that new explanations create new problems.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Both the Principle of Mediocrity and the Spaceship Earth idea are,
contrary to their motivations, irreparably parochial and mistaken. From
the least parochial perspectives available to us, people are the most
significant entities in the cosmic scheme of things. They are not
‘supported’ by their environments, but support themselves by creating
knowledge. Once they have suitable knowledge (essentially, the knowledge
of the Enlightenment), they are capable of sparking unlimited further
progress.</p>
<p>Apart from the thoughts of people, the only process known to be
capable of creating knowledge is biological evolution. The knowledge it
creates (other than via people) is inherently bounded and parochial. Yet
it also has close similarities with human knowledge. The similarities
and the differences are the subject of the next chapter.</p>
