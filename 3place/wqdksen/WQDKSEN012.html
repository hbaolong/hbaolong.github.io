<h4 id="a-dream-of-socrates">10 A Dream of Socrates</h4>
<p>SOCRATES is staying at an inn near the Temple of the Oracle at
Delphi. Together with his friend CHAEREPHON, he has today asked the
Oracle who the wisest man in the world is,* so that they might go and
learn from him. But, to their annoyance, the priestess (who provides the
Oracle’s voice on behalf of the god Apollo) merely announced, ‘No one is
wiser than Socrates.’ Sleeping now on an uncomfortable bed in a tiny and
exorbitantly expensive room, SOCRATES hears a deep, melodious voice
intoning his name.</p>
<p>HERMES: Greetings, Socrates.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Draws the blanket over his head.] Go away. I’ve already
made too many offerings today and you’re not going to wring any more out
of me. I am too ‘wise’ for that, hadn’t you heard?</p>
<p>HERMES: I seek no offering.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Then what do you want? [He turns and sees HERMES, who is
naked.] Well, I’m sure that some of my associates camped outside will be
glad to –</p>
<p>HERMES: It is not them I seek, but you, O Socrates.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Then you shall be disappointed, stranger. Now kindly leave
me to my hard-earned rest.</p>
<p>HERMES: Very well. [He makes towards the door.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Wait.</p>
<p>HERMES: [Turns and raises a quizzical eyebrow.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [slowly and deliberately] I am asleep. Dreaming. And you
are the god Apollo.</p>
<p>HERMES: What makes you think so?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: These precincts are sacred to you. It is night-time and
there is no lamp, yet I see you clearly. This is not possible in real
life. So you must be coming to me in a dream.</p>
<p>HERMES: You reason coolly. Are you not afraid?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Bah! I ask you in return: are you a benevolent or a
malevolent god? If benevolent, then what do I have to fear? If
malevolent, then I disdain to fear you. We Athenians are a proud people
– and protected by our goddess, as you surely know. Twice we defeated
the Persian Empire against overwhelming odds,* and now we are defying
Sparta. It is our custom to defy anyone who seeks our submission.</p>
<p>HERMES: Even a god?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: A benevolent god would not seek it. On the other hand, it
is also our custom to give a hearing to anyone who offers us honest
criticism, seeking to persuade us freely to change our minds. For we
want to do what is right.</p>
<p>HERMES: Those two customs are two sides of the same valuable coin,
Socrates. I give you Athenians great credit for honouring them.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: My city is surely deserving of your favour. But why would
an immortal want to converse with such a confused and ignorant person as
me? I think I can guess your reason: you have repented of your little
joke via the Oracle, haven’t you? Indeed, it was rather cruel of you to
send us only a mocking answer, considering the distance we have come and
the offerings we have made. So please tell me the truth this time, O
fount of wisdom: who is really the wisest man in the world?</p>
<p>HERMES: I reveal no facts.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Sighs.] Then I beg you – I have always wanted to know
this: what is the nature of virtue?</p>
<p>HERMES: I reveal no moral truths either.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yet, as a benevolent god, you must have come here to impart
some sort of knowledge. What sort will you deign to grant me?</p>
<p>HERMES: Knowledge about knowledge, Socrates. Epistemology. I have
already mentioned some.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: You have? Oh – you said that you honour Athenians for our
openness to persuasion. And for our defiance of bullies. But it is well
known that those are virtues! Surely telling me what I already know
doesn’t count as a ‘revelation’.</p>
<p>HERMES: Most Athenians would indeed call those virtues. But how many
really believe it? How many are willing to criticize a god by the
standards of reason and justice?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Ponders.] All who are just, I suppose. For how can anyone
be just if he follows a god of whose moral rightness he is not
persuaded? And how is it possible to be persuaded of someone’s moral
rightness without first forming a view about which qualities are morally
right?</p>
<p>HERMES: Your associates out there on the lawn – are they unjust?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No.</p>
<p>HERMES: And are they aware of the connections you have just described
between reason, morality and the reluctance to defer to gods?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Perhaps not sufficiently aware – yet.</p>
<p>HERMES: So it is not true that every just person knows these
things.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Agreed. Perhaps it is only every wise person.</p>
<p>HERMES: Everyone who is at least as wise as you, then. Who else is in
that exalted category?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Is there some high purpose in your continuing to mock me,
wise Apollo, by asking me the same question that we asked you today? It
seems to me that your joke is wearing thin.</p>
<p>HERMES: Have you, Socrates, never mocked anyone?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [with dignity] If, on occasion, I make fun of someone, it
is because I hope he will help me to seek a truth that neither he nor I
yet knows. I do not mock from on high, as you do. I want only to goad my
fellow mortal into helping me look beyond that which is easy to see.</p>
<p>HERMES: But what in the world is easy to see? What things are the
easiest to see, Socrates?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Shrugs.] Those that are before our eyes.</p>
<p>HERMES: And what is before your eyes at this moment?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: You are.</p>
<p>HERMES: Are you sure?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Are you going to start asking me how I can be sure of
whatever I say? And then, whatever reason I give, are you going to ask
how I can be sure of that?</p>
<p>HERMES: No. Do you think I have come here to play hackneyed debating
tricks?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Very well: obviously I can’t be sure of anything. But I
don’t want to be. I can think of nothing more boring – no offence meant,
wise Apollo – than to attain the state of being perfectly secure in
one’s beliefs, which some people seem to yearn for. I see no use for it
– other than to provide a semblance of an argument when one doesn’t have
a real one. Fortunately that mental state has nothing to do with what I
do yearn for, which is to discover the truth of how the world is, and
why – and, even more, of how it should be.</p>
<p>HERMES: Congratulations, Socrates, on your epistemological wisdom.
The knowledge that you seek – objective knowledge – is hard to come by,
but attainable. That mental state that you do not seek – justified
belief – is sought by many people, especially priests and philosophers.
But, in truth, beliefs cannot be justified, except in relation to other
beliefs, and even then only fallibly. So the quest for their
justification can lead only to an infinite regress – each step of which
would itself be subject to error.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Again, I know this.</p>
<p>HERMES: Indeed. And, as you have rightly remarked, it doesn’t count
as a ‘revelation’ if I tell you what you already know. Yet – notice that
that remark is precisely what people who seek justified belief do not
agree with.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: What? I’m sorry, but that was too convoluted a comment for
my allegedly wise mind to comprehend. Please explain what I am to notice
about those people who seek ‘justified belief’.</p>
<p>HERMES: Merely this. Suppose they just happen to be aware of the
explanation of something. You and I would say that they know it. But to
them, no matter how good an explanation it is, and no matter how true
and important and useful it may be, they still do not consider it to be
knowledge. It is only if a god then comes along and reassures them that
it is true (or if they imagine such a god or other authority) that they
count it as knowledge. So, to them it does count as a revelation if the
authority tells them what they are already fully aware of.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see that. And I see that they are foolish, because, for
all they know, the ‘authority’ [gestures at HERMES] may be toying with
them. Or trying to teach them some important lesson. Or they may be
misunderstanding the authority. Or they may be mistaken in their belief
that it is an authority –</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. So the thing they call ‘knowledge’, namely justified
belief, is a chimera. It is unattainable to humans except in the form of
self-deception; it is unnecessary for any good purpose; and it is
undesired by the wisest among mortals.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I know.</p>
<p>HERMES: Xenophanes knew it too; but he is no longer among the mortals
–</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Is that what you meant when you told the Oracle that no one
is wiser than I?</p>
<p>HERMES: [Ignores the question.] Hence, also, I wasn’t referring to
justified belief when I asked whether you are sure that I am before your
eyes. I was only questioning how you can claim to be ‘seeing clearly’
what is before your eyes when you also claim to be asleep!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Oh! Yes, you have caught me in an error – but surely only a
trivial one. Indeed, you may not be literally before my eyes. Perhaps
you are at home on Olympus, sending me a mere likeness of yourself. But
in that case you are controlling that likeness and I am seeing it, and
referring to it as ‘you’, so I am seeing ‘you’.</p>
<p>HERMES: But that is not what I asked. I asked what is here before
your eyes. In reality.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: All right. Before my eyes, in reality, there is – a small
room. Or, if you want a literal reply, what is before my eyes is –
eyelids, since I expect that they are shut. Yet I see from your
expression that you want even more precision. Very well: before my eyes
are the inside surfaces of my eyelids.</p>
<p>HERMES: And can you see those? In other words, is it really ‘easy to
see’ what is before your eyes?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Not at the moment. But that is only because I am
dreaming.</p>
<p>HERMES: Is it only because you are dreaming? Are you saying that if
you were awake you would now be seeing the inside surfaces of your
eyelids?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [carefully] If I were awake with my eyes still closed, then
yes.</p>
<p>HERMES: What colour do you see when you close your eyes?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: In a room as dimly lit as this one – black.</p>
<p>HERMES: Do you think that the inside surfaces of your eyelids are
black?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I suppose not.</p>
<p>HERMES: So would you really be seeing them?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Not exactly.</p>
<p>HERMES: And if you were to open your eyes, would you be able to see
the room?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Only very vaguely. It is dark.</p>
<p>HERMES: So I ask again: is it true that, if you were awake, you could
easily see what was before your eyes?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: All right – not always. But nevertheless, when I am awake,
and with my eyes open, and in bright light –</p>
<p>HERMES: But not too bright, I suppose?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, yes. If you want to keep quibbling, I must accept that
when one is dazzled by the sun one may see even less well than in the
dark. Likewise one may see one’s own face behind a mirror where there is
in reality only empty space. One may sometimes see a mirage, or be
fooled by a pile of crumpled clothes that happens to resemble a mythical
creature –</p>
<p>HERMES: Or one may be fooled by dreaming of one . . .</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Smiles.] Quite so. And, conversely, whether sleeping or
waking, we often fail to see things that are there in reality.</p>
<p>HERMES: You have no idea how many such things there are . . .</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No doubt. But still, when one is not dreaming, and
conditions are good for seeing –</p>
<p>HERMES: And how can you tell whether ‘conditions are good’ for
seeing?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Ah! Now you are trying to catch me in a circularity. You
want me to say that one can tell that conditions are good for seeing
when one can easily see what is there.</p>
<p>HERMES: I want you not to say so.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: It seems to me that you have been asking questions about me
– what is in front of me, what I can easily see, whether I am sure, and
so on. But I seek fundamental truths, of which I estimate that not a
single one is predominantly about me. So let me stress again: I am not
sure what is in front of my eyes – ever – with my eyes open or closed,
asleep or awake. Nor can I be sure what is probably in front of my eyes,
for how could I estimate the probability that I am dreaming when I think
I am awake? Or that my whole previous life has been but a dream in which
it has pleased one of you immortals to imprison me?</p>
<p>HERMES: Indeed.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I might even be a victim of a mundane deception, such as
those of conjurers. We know that a conjurer is deceiving us because he
shows us something that cannot be – and then asks for money! But if he
were to forgo his fee and show me something that can be but is not, how
could I ever know? Perhaps this entire vision of you is not a dream
after all but some cunning conjurer’s trick. On the other hand, perhaps
you really are here in person and I am awake after all. None of this can
I ever be sure is so, or not so. I can, however, conceive of knowing
some of it.</p>
<p>HERMES: Precisely. And is the same true of your moral knowledge? In
regard to what is right and wrong, could you be mistaken, or misled, by
the equivalent of mirages or tricks?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: That seems harder to imagine. For in regard to moral
knowledge I need my senses very little: it is mainly just my own
thoughts. I reason about what is right and wrong, or what makes a person
virtuous or wicked. I can be mistaken, of course, in these mental
deliberations, but not so easily deceived by outside tricks or
illusions, for they affect only our senses and not our reason.</p>
<p>HERMES: How, then, do you account for the fact that you Athenians are
constantly squabbling among yourselves about what qualities constitute
virtue or vice, and what actions are right or wrong?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Why is that puzzling? We disagree because it is easy to be
mistaken. Yet, despite that, we also agree about many such issues.</p>
<p>From this I speculate that, where we have so far failed to agree, it
is not because anything is actively deceiving us, but simply because
some issues are hard to reason about – just as there are many truths in
geometry that even Pythagoras did not know but which future geometers
may discover. As that other ‘wise mortal’ Xenophanes wrote:</p>
<p>The gods did not reveal, from the beginning,</p>
<p>All things to us; but in the course of time,</p>
<p>Through seeking we may learn and know things better.*</p>
<p>That is what we Athenians have done in regard to moral knowledge.
Through seeking we have learned, and agreed upon, the easy things. And
in future, by the same means – namely by refusing to hold any of our
ideas immune from criticism – we may learn some matters not so
light.</p>
<p>HERMES: There is much truth in what you say. So, take it a little
further: if it is so hard to be systematically deceived on moral issues,
how is it that the Spartans disagree with you about some of those issues
on which nearly all Athenians agree – the ones that you have just said
are the easy ones?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Because the Spartans learn many mistaken beliefs and values
in early childhood.</p>
<p>HERMES: Whereas Athenians begin their flawless education at what
age?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Again, you catch me in an error. Yes of course we too teach
our values to our young, and those must include our most serious
misconceptions as well as our deepest wisdom. Yet our values include
being open to suggestions, tolerant of dissent, and critical of both
dissent and received opinion. So I suppose that the real difference
between the Spartans and us is that their moral education enjoins them
to hold their most important ideas immune from criticism. Not to be open
to suggestions. Not to criticize certain ideas such as their traditions
or their conceptions of the gods; not to seek the truth, because they
claim that they already have it.</p>
<p>Hence they do not believe that ‘in the course of time they may learn
and know things better.’ They agree among themselves because their laws
and customs enforce conformity. We agree among ourselves (to the extent
that we do) because, through our tradition of endless critical debate,
we have discovered some genuine knowledge. Since there is only one truth
of any given matter, as we discover ideas closer to the truth our ideas
become closer to each other’s, so we agree more. People who converge
upon the truth converge with each other.</p>
<p>HERMES: Indeed.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Moreover, since the Spartans never seek improvement, it is
not surprising that they never find it. We, in contrast, have sought it
– by constantly criticizing and debating and trying to correct our ideas
and behaviour. And thereby we are well placed to learn more in the
future.</p>
<p>HERMES: It follows, then, that it is wrong of the Spartans to educate
their children to hold their city’s ideas, laws and customs immune from
criticism.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I thought you weren’t going to reveal moral truths!</p>
<p>HERMES: I can’t help it if it follows logically from epistemology.
But, anyway, you already know this one.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, I do. And I see what you are getting at. You are
showing me that there are such things as mirages and tricks in regard to
moral knowledge. Some of them are embedded in the Spartans’ traditional
moral choices. Their whole way of life misleads and traps them – because
one of their mistaken beliefs is that they must take no steps to prevent
their way of life from misleading and trapping them!</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Are there such traps embedded in our way of life? [Frowns.]
Of course, I think there aren’t – but I would think that, wouldn’t I? As
Xenophanes also wrote, it’s all too easy to attribute universal truth to
mere local appearances:</p>
<p>The Ethiops say that their gods are flat-nosed and black</p>
<p>While the Thracians say that theirs have blue eyes and red hair.</p>
<p>Yet if cattle or horses or lions had hands and could draw</p>
<p>And could sculpture like men, then the horses would draw their
gods</p>
<p>Like horses, and cattle like cattle . . .</p>
<p>HERMES: So now you are imagining some Spartan Socrates who considers
their ways virtuous and yours decadent –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: And who considers us to be stuck in a trap, since we shall
never willingly ‘correct’ ourselves by adopting Spartan ways. Yes.</p>
<p>HERMES: But does this Spartan Socrates, if he exists, worry that the
Athenian Socrates may be right, and he wrong? Was there a Spartan
Xenophanes who suspected that the gods might not be as the Greeks think
they are?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Most certainly not!</p>
<p>HERMES: So, since one of their ‘ways’ is to preserve all their ways
unchanged, then if he were right, and you wrong –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Then the Spartans must also have been right ever since they
embarked on their present way of life. The gods must have revealed the
perfect way of life to them at the outset. So – did you?</p>
<p>HERMES: [Raises his eyebrows.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Of course you didn’t. Now I see that the difference between
our ways and theirs is not merely a matter of perspective, nor just a
matter of degree.* Let me restate it:</p>
<p>If the Spartan Socrates is right that Athens is trapped in falsehoods
but Sparta is not, then Sparta, being unchanging, must already be
perfect, and hence right about everything else too. Yet in fact they
know almost nothing. One thing that they clearly don’t know is how to
persuade other cities that Sparta is perfect, even cities that have a
policy of listening to arguments and criticism . . .</p>
<p>HERMES: Well, logically it could be that the ‘perfect way of life’
involves having few accomplishments and being wrong about most things.
But, yes, you are glimpsing something important here –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Whereas if I am right that Athens is not in such a trap,
that implies nothing about whether we are right or wrong about any other
matter. Indeed, our very idea that improvement is possible implies that
there must be errors and inadequacies in our current ideas.</p>
<p>I thank you, generous Apollo, for this ‘glimpse’ into that important
difference.</p>
<p>HERMES: Yet there is even more of a difference than you think. Bear
in mind that the Spartans and Athenians alike are but fallible men and
are subject to misconceptions and errors in all their thinking –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Wait! We are fallible in all our thinking? Is there
literally no idea that we may safely hold immune from criticism?</p>
<p>HERMES: Like what?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Ponders for a while. Then:] What about the truths of
arithmetic, like two plus two equals four? Or the fact that Delphi
exists? What about the geometrical fact that the angles of a triangle
sum to two right angles?</p>
<p>HERMES: Revealing no facts, I cannot confirm that all three of those
propositions are even true! But more important is this: how did you come
to choose those particular propositions as candidates for immunity from
criticism? Why Delphi and not Athens? Why two plus two and not three
plus four? Why not the theorem of Pythagoras? Was it because you decided
that the propositions you chose would best make your point because they
were the most obviously, unambiguously true of all the propositions you
considered using?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes.</p>
<p>HERMES: But then how did you determine how obviously and
unambiguously true each of those candidate propositions was, compared
with the others? Did you not criticize them? Did you not quickly attempt
to think of ways or reasons that they might conceivably be false?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, I did. I see. Had I held them immune from criticism, I
would have had no way of arriving at that conclusion.</p>
<p>HERMES: So you are, after all, a thoroughgoing fallibilist – though
you mistakenly believed you were not.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I merely doubted it.</p>
<p>HERMES: You doubted and criticized fallibilism itself, as a true
fallibilist should.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: That is so. Moreover, had I not criticized it, I could not
have come to understand why it is true. My doubt improved my knowledge
of an important truth – as knowledge held immune from criticism never
can be improved!</p>
<p>HERMES: This too you already knew. For it is why you always encourage
everyone to criticize even that which seems most obvious to you –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: And why I set an example by doing it to them!</p>
<p>HERMES: Perhaps. Now consider: what would happen if the fallible
Athenian voters made a mistake and enacted a law that was very unwise
and unjust –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Which, alas, they often do –</p>
<p>HERMES: Imagine a specific case, for the sake of argument. Suppose
that they were somehow firmly persuaded that thieving is a high virtue
from which many practical benefits flow, and that they abolished all
laws forbidding it. What would happen?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Everyone would start thieving. Very soon those who were
best at thieving (and at living among thieves) would become the
wealthiest citizens. But most people would no longer be secure in their
property (even most thieves), and all the farmers and artisans and
traders would soon find it impossible to continue to produce anything
worth stealing. So disaster and starvation would follow, while the
promised benefits would not, and they would all realize that they had
been mistaken.</p>
<p>HERMES: Would they? Let me remind you again of the fallibility of
human nature, Socrates. Given that they were firmly persuaded that
thievery was beneficial, wouldn’t their first reaction to those setbacks
be that there was not enough thievery going on? Wouldn’t they enact laws
to encourage it still further?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Alas, yes – at first. Yet, no matter how firmly they were
persuaded, these setbacks would be problems in their lives, which they
would want to solve. A few among them would eventually begin to suspect
that increased thievery might not be the solution after all. So they
would think about it more. They would have been convinced of the
benefits of thievery by some explanation or other. Now they would try to
explain why the supposed solution didn’t seem to be working. Eventually
they would find an explanation that seemed better. So gradually they
would persuade others of that – and so on until a majority again opposed
thievery.</p>
<p>HERMES: Aha! So salvation would come about through persuasion.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: If you like. Thought, explanation and persuasion. And now
they would understand better why thievery is harmful, through their new
explanations.*</p>
<p>HERMES: By the way, the little story we have just imagined is exactly
how Athens really does look, from my point of view.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [somewhat resentfully] How you must laugh at us!</p>
<p>HERMES: Not at all, Athenian. As I said, I honour you. Now, let us
consider what would happen if, instead of legalizing thievery, their
error had been to ban debate. And to ban philosophy and politics and
elections and that whole constellation of activities, and to consider
them shameful.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. That would have the effect of banning persuasion.
And hence it would block off that path to salvation that we have
discussed. This is a rare and deadly sort of error: it prevents itself
from being undone.</p>
<p>HERMES: Or at least it makes salvation immensely more difficult, yes.
This is what Sparta looks like, to me.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. And to me too, now that you point it out. In the
past I have often pondered the many differences between our two cities,
for I must confess that there was – and still is – much that I admire
about the Spartans. But I had never realized before now that those
differences are all superficial. Beneath their evident virtues and
vices, beneath even the fact that they are bitter enemies of Athens,
Sparta is the victim – and the servant – of a profound evil. This is a
momentous revelation, noble Apollo, better than a thousand declarations
of the Oracle, and I cannot adequately express my gratitude.</p>
<p>HERMES: [Nods in acknowledgement.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I also see why you urge me always to bear human fallibility
in mind. In fact, since you mentioned that some moral truths follow
logically from epistemological considerations, I am now wondering
whether they all do. Could it be that the moral imperative not to
destroy the means of correcting mistakes is the only moral imperative?
That all other moral truths follow from it?</p>
<p>HERMES: [Is silent.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: As you wish. Now, in regard to Athens, and to what you were
saying about epistemology: if our prospects for discovering new
knowledge are so good, why were you stressing the unreliability of the
senses?</p>
<p>HERMES: I was correcting your description of the quest for knowledge
as striving to ‘see beyond what is easy to see’.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I meant that metaphorically: ‘see’ in the sense of
‘understand’.</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. Nevertheless, you have conceded that even those things
that you thought were the easiest to see literally are in fact not easy
to see at all without prior knowledge about them. In fact nothing is
easy to see without prior knowledge. All knowledge of the world is hard
to come by. Moreover –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Moreover, it follows that we do not come by it through
seeing. It does not flow into us through our senses.</p>
<p>HERMES: Exactly.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yet you say that objective knowledge is attainable. So, if
it does not come to us through the senses, where it does come from?</p>
<p>HERMES: Suppose I were to tell you that all knowledge comes from
persuasion.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Persuasion again! Well, I would reply – with all due
respect – that that makes no sense. Whoever persuades me of something
must first have discovered it himself, so in such a case the relevant
issue is where his knowledge came from –</p>
<p>HERMES: Quite right, unless –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: And, in any case, when I learn something through
persuasion, it is coming to me via my senses.</p>
<p>HERMES: No, there you are mistaken. It only seems that way to
you.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: What?</p>
<p>HERMES: Well, you are learning things from me now, aren’t you? Are
they coming to you through your senses?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, of course they are. Oh – no they’re not. But that is
only because you, a supernatural being, are bypassing my senses and
sending me knowledge in a dream.</p>
<p>HERMES: Am I?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I thought you said you’re not here to play debating tricks!
Are you denying your own existence now? When sophists do that, I usually
take them at their word and stop arguing with them.</p>
<p>HERMES: A policy that again bespeaks your wisdom, Socrates. But I
have not denied my existence. I was only questioning what difference it
makes whether I am real or not. Would it make you change your mind about
anything that you have learned about epistemology during this
conversation?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Perhaps not . . .</p>
<p>HERMES: Perhaps not? Come now, Socrates, you were boasting earlier
that you and your fellow citizens are always open to persuasion.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, I see.</p>
<p>HERMES: Now, if I am only a figment of your imagination, then who has
persuaded you?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Presumably I myself – unless this dream is coming neither
from you nor from within myself, but from some other source . . .</p>
<p>HERMES: But did you not say that you are open to persuasion by
anyone? If dreams emanate from an unknown source, what difference should
that make? If they are persuasive, are you not honour-bound as an
Athenian to accept them?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: It seems that I am. But what if a dream were to emanate
from a malevolent source?</p>
<p>HERMES: That makes no fundamental difference either. Suppose that the
source purports to tell you a fact. Then, if you suspect that the source
is malevolent, you will try to understand what evil it is trying to
perpetrate by telling you the alleged fact. But then, depending on your
explanation, you may well decide to believe it anyway –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. For instance, if an enemy announces that he is
planning to kill me, I may well believe him despite his malevolence.</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. Or you may not. And if your closest friend purports to
tell you a fact, you may likewise wonder whether he has been misled by a
malevolent third party – or is simply mistaken for any of countless
reasons. Thus situations can easily arise in which you disbelieve your
closest friend and believe your worst enemy. What matters in all cases
is the explanation you create, within your own mind, for the facts, and
for the observations and advice in question.</p>
<p>But the case here is simpler. As I said, I reveal no facts. I’m only
making arguments.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. I have no need to trust the source if the argument
itself is persuasive. And no way of using any source unless I also have
a persuasive argument.</p>
<p>Wait a moment – I’ve just realized something. You ‘reveal no facts’.
But the god Apollo does reveal facts, hundreds of them every day,
through the Oracle. Aha, I understand now. You are not Apollo, but a
different god.</p>
<p>HERMES: [Is silent.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: You’re evidently a god of knowledge . . . but several gods
have an interest in knowledge. Athena herself does – but I can tell that
you are not she.</p>
<p>HERMES: No you can’t.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes I can. I don’t mean from your appearance. I mean I can
infer it from the detached way you speak of Athens. So – I think you are
Hermes. God of knowledge, and of messages, and of information flow –</p>
<p>HERMES: A fine thought. But, by the way, what makes you think that
Apollo reveals facts through the Oracle?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Oh!</p>
<p>HERMES: We have agreed that by ‘reveal’ we mean telling the
supplicant something that he doesn’t yet know . . .</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Are all its replies just jokes and tricks?</p>
<p>HERMES: [Is silent.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: As you wish, fleet Hermes. Then let me try to understand
your argument about knowledge. I asked where knowledge comes from, and
you directed my attention to this very dream. You asked whether it would
make any difference to how I regard the knowledge I am learning from you
if it turns out not to have been supernaturally inspired after all. And
I had to agree that it would not. So am I to conclude that . . . all
knowledge originates from the same source as dreams? Which is within
ourselves?</p>
<p>HERMES: Of course it does. Do you remember what Xenophanes wrote just
after he said that objective knowledge is attainable by humans?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes. The passage continues:</p>
<p>But as for certain truth, no man has known it,</p>
<p>Nor will he know it; neither of the gods,</p>
<p>Nor yet of all things of which I speak.</p>
<p>And even if by chance he were to utter</p>
<p>The perfect truth, he would himself not know it –</p>
<p>So there he’s saying that, although objective knowledge is
attainable, justified belief (‘certain truth’) is not.</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes, we’ve covered all that. But your answer is in the next
line.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: ‘For all is but a woven web of guesses.’ Guesses!</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. Conjectures.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: But wait! What about when knowledge does not come from
guesswork – as when a god sends me a dream? What about when I simply
hear ideas from other people? They may have guessed them, but I then
obtain them merely by listening.</p>
<p>HERMES: You do not. In all those cases, you still have to guess in
order to acquire the knowledge.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I do?</p>
<p>HERMES: Of course. Have you yourself not often been misunderstood,
even by people trying hard to understand you?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes.</p>
<p>HERMES: Have you, in turn, not often misunderstood what someone
means, even when he is trying to tell you as clearly as he can?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Indeed I have. Not least during this conversation!</p>
<p>HERMES: Well, this is not an attribute of philosophical ideas only,
but of all ideas. Remember when you all got lost on your way here from
the ship? And why?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: It was because – as we realized with hindsight – we
completely misunderstood the directions given to us by the captain.</p>
<p>HERMES: So, when you got the wrong idea of what he meant, despite
having listened attentively to every word he said, where did that wrong
idea come from? Not from him, presumably . . .</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. It must come from within ourselves. It must be a
guess. Though, until this moment, it had never even remotely occurred to
me that I had been guessing.</p>
<p>HERMES: So why would you expect that anything different happens when
you do understand someone correctly?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. When we hear something being said, we guess what it
means, without realizing what we are doing. That is beginning to make
sense to me.</p>
<p>Except – guesswork isn’t knowledge!</p>
<p>HERMES: Indeed, most guesses are not new knowledge. Although
guesswork is the origin of all knowledge, it is also a source of error,
and therefore what happens to an idea after it has been guessed is
crucial.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: So – let me combine that insight with what I know of
criticism. A guess might come from a dream, or it might just be a wild
speculation or random combination of ideas, or anything. But then we do
not just accept it blindly or because we imagine it is ‘authorized’, or
because we want it to be true. Instead we criticize it and try to
discover its flaws.</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. That is what you should do, at any rate.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Then we try to remedy those flaws by altering the idea, or
dropping it in favour of others – and the alterations and other ideas
are themselves guesses. And are themselves criticized. Only when we fail
in these attempts either to reject or to improve an idea do we
provisionally accept it.</p>
<p>HERMES: That can work. Unfortunately, people do not always do what
can work.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Thank you, Hermes. It is exciting to learn of this single
process through which all knowledge originates, whether it is our
knowledge of a sea captain’s directions to Delphi, or knowledge of right
and wrong that we have carefully refined for years, or theorems of
arithmetic or geometry – or epistemology revealed to us by a god –</p>
<p>HERMES: It all comes from within, from conjecture and criticism.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Wait! It comes from within, even if revealed by a god?</p>
<p>HERMES: And is just as fallible as ever. Yes. Your argument covers
that case just like any other.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Marvellous! But now – what about objects that we just
experience in the natural world. We reach out and touch an object, and
hence experience it out there. Surely that is a different kind of
knowledge, a kind which – fallible or not – really does come from
without, at least in the sense that our own experience is out there, at
the location of the object.*</p>
<p>HERMES: You loved the idea that all those other different kinds of
knowledge originate in the same way, and are improved in the same way.
Why is ‘direct’ sensory experience an exception? What if it just seems
radically different?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: But surely you are now asking me to believe in a sort of
all-encompassing conjuring trick, resembling the fanciful notion that
the whole of life is really a dream. For it would mean that the
sensation of touching an object does not happen where we experience it
happening, namely in the hand that touches, but in the mind – which I
believe is located somewhere in the brain. So all my sensations of touch
are located inside my skull, where in reality nothing can touch while I
still live. And whenever I think I am seeing a vast, brilliantly
illuminated landscape, all that I am really experiencing is likewise
located entirely inside my skull, where in reality it is constantly
dark!</p>
<p>HERMES: Is that so absurd? Where do you think all the sights and
sounds of this dream are located?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I accept that they are indeed in my mind. But that is my
point: most dreams portray things that are simply not there in the
external reality. To portray things that are there is surely impossible
without some input that does not come from the mind but from those
things themselves.</p>
<p>HERMES: Well reasoned, Socrates. But is that input needed in the
source of your dream, or only in your ongoing criticism of it?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: You mean that we first guess what is there, and then –
what? – we test our guesses against the input from our senses?</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I see. And then we hone our guesses, and then fashion the
best ones into a sort of waking dream of reality.*</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. A waking dream that corresponds to reality. But there is
more. It is a dream of which you then gain control. You do that by
controlling the corresponding aspects of the external reality.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Gasps.] It is a wonderfully unified theory, and
consistent, as far as I can tell. But am I really to accept that I
myself – the thinking being that I call ‘I’ – has no direct knowledge of
the physical world at all, but can only receive arcane hints of it
through flickers and shadows that happen to impinge on my eyes and other
senses? And that what I experience as reality is never more than a
waking dream, composed of conjectures originating from within
myself?</p>
<p>HERMES: Do you have an alternative explanation?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No! And the more I contemplate this one, the more delighted
I become. (A sensation of which I should beware! Yet I am also
persuaded.) Everyone knows that man is the paragon of animals. But if
this epistemology you tell me is true, then we are infinitely more
marvellous creatures than that. Here we sit, for ever imprisoned in the
dark, almost-sealed cave of our skull, guessing. We weave stories of an
outside world – worlds, actually: a physical world, a moral world, a
world of abstract geometrical shapes, and so on – but we are not
satisfied with merely weaving, nor with mere stories. We want true
explanations. So we seek explanations that remain robust when we test
them against those flickers and shadows, and against each other, and
against criteria of logic and reasonableness and everything else we can
think of. And when we can change them no more, we have understood some
objective truth. And, as if that were not enough, what we understand we
then control. It is like magic, only real. We are like gods!</p>
<p>HERMES: Well, sometimes you discover some objective truth, and exert
some control as a result. But often, when you think you have achieved
any of that, you haven’t.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, yes. But having discovered some truths, can we not
make better guesses and further criticisms and tests, and so understand
more and control more, as Xenophanes says?</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: So we are like gods!</p>
<p>HERMES: Somewhat. And yes, to answer your next question, you can
indeed become ever more like gods in ever more ways, if you choose to.
(Though you will always remain fallible.)</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Why on earth would we not choose to? Oh, I see: Sparta and
suchlike . . .</p>
<p>HERMES: Yes. But also because some may argue that fallible gods are
not a good thing –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: All right. But, if we choose to, are you saying that there
is no upper bound to how much we can eventually understand, and control,
and achieve?</p>
<p>HERMES: Funny you should ask that. Generations from now, a book will
be written which will provide a compelling –</p>
<p>[At that moment there is a knocking at the door. SOCRATES glances
towards the sound, and then back to where HERMES had been, but the god
has vanished.]</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [through the door] Sorry to wake you, old chap, but I
hear that unless we vacate these rooms before the house slaves arrive to
clean them, they’re liable to charge us for another day.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Emerges, and motions CHAEREPHON’S SLAVE into the room to
pack SOCRATES’ modest travelling bag.] Chaerephon – our trip hasn’t been
wasted after all! I met Hermes.</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: What?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Yes, the god. In a dream, or maybe in person. Or maybe I
just dreamed I met him. But it doesn’t matter, because, as he pointed
out, it makes no difference.</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [Confused.] What? Why not?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Because I learned a whole new branch of philosophy – and
more!</p>
<p>[A group of Socrates’ COMPANIONS is approaching. Sprinting eagerly
ahead of the rest is the teenage poet Aristocles, whom his friends call
PLATO (‘the Broad’) because of his wrestler’s build.]</p>
<p>PLATO: Socrates! Good morning! Thank you again a thousandfold for
letting me come on this pilgrimage! [Launches straight into philosophy
without waiting for a reply.] But I was thinking last night: does it
really count as a revelation if the Oracle tells us only what we already
know? We already knew that there’s no one wiser than you, so I thought:
shouldn’t we go back and demand a free question? But then I thought
–</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Aristocles, Socrates has –</p>
<p>PLATO: No, wait! Don’t tell me the answer. Let me tell you my best
guess first. So I thought: yes, we already knew he’s the wisest. And
that he’s modest. But we didn’t know quite how modest. So that’s what
the god revealed to us! That Socrates is so modest that he’d contradict
even a god saying he’s wise.</p>
<p>COMPANIONS: [Laugh.]</p>
<p>PLATO: And another thing: we knew of Socrates’ excellence, but now
Apollo has revealed it to the whole world.</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [under his breath] Then I wish ‘the whole world’ had
chipped in for the fee.</p>
<p>PLATO: What was that? Did I get it right?</p>
<p>[SOCRATES draws breath to answer, but PLATO again continues.]</p>
<p>Oh, and Socrates, may I call you ‘Master’?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No.</p>
<p>PLATO: Yes, yes, of course. Sorry. It’s just that I’ve been hanging
out with some Spartan kids at the gymnasium, and they talk like that all
the time. ‘My master says this. My master says that. My master does not
permit . . .’ and so on and so on. It got so that I became a bit envious
that I don’t have a master myself, so –</p>
<p>COMPANION NO. 1: Eww, Plato!</p>
<p>PLATO: Yeah, but –</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [catching up] Spartan kids? Aristocles, that is most
improper. We are at war!</p>
<p>PLATO: Not here in Delphi we’re not. They’d never violate the sacred
truce of the Oracle. They’re very devout, you know. Nice kids, despite
their funny accents. We spoke a lot about wrestling – in between actual
wrestling, that is. We were up all night, wrestling by candlelight. I’ve
never done that before. They’re really good! Though they do sometimes
cheat as well. [Smiles indulgently in recollection.] But, even so, I
wasn’t going to let our city be humiliated. I won a few bouts for
Athens, you’ll be glad to know. That was intense! They taught me some
great moves. I can’t wait to try them out back home. For some reason
none of them are much into poetry, though.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: They don’t honour poets in Sparta. Not living ones,
anyway.</p>
<p>PLATO: Oh! Pity. I dashed off a poem in commemoration of our
wrestling competition. Or rather, between the lines, it’s really about
why Athens is better than Sparta. It’s a mathematical argument . . .
Anyway, I’ve just sent a slave over to their compound to recite it to
them, but if they don’t honour poets perhaps they won’t appreciate it.
Oh well. It goes like this –</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Aristocles – last night Socrates was visited by the god
Hermes!</p>
<p>PLATO: Wow! Why didn’t you call us, Socrates? That would have trumped
even wrestling with Spartans!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I couldn’t call anyone because it happened in a dream – or
something. I’m not even sure that it was really the god. But, as he
pointed out to me, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>PLATO: Why not? Oh, I guess that, once the experience is over, all
that matters is what you learned from it. So, what did he want? I bet he
wanted to poach you away from the cult of Apollo. Don’t do it, Socrates!
Apollo is much better. Not that there’s anything wrong with Hermes, but
he has no Oracle. And he’s not as cool –</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [shocked] Show some respect, Aristocles – to Socrates and
to the gods!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: He is showing respect, Chaerephon, in his own way.</p>
<p>PLATO: [mystified] Of course I respect them, Chaerephon. And you know
I’d literally worship Socrates if he’d let me. Oh, and I respect you
too, old man. Greatly. I beg you to forgive me if I have offended you: I
know I get too enthusiastic sometimes. [Pauses briefly.] But, Socrates –
what did you ask the god and what did he reply?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: It wasn’t quite like that. He came to reveal to me a new
branch of philosophy: epistemology – knowledge about knowledge, which
also has implications for morality and other fields. Much of it I
already knew, or partially knew in various special cases. But he gave me
a god’s-eye overview, which was breathtaking. Interestingly, he mainly
did this by asking me questions, and inviting me to think about certain
things. It seems an effective technique – I may try it sometime.</p>
<p>PLATO: Tell us everything, Socrates! Start with the most interesting
thing he asked, and your reply.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Well – one thing he asked me to do was to imagine a
‘Spartan Socrates’.</p>
<p>PLATO: A Spartan what? Oh! I see! That must be whom the Oracle meant.
How sneaky Apollo is! It’s the Spartan Socrates who’s the wisest man in
the world – though only by the breadth of a hair, I’ll bet! But, being
Spartan, he’s probably the greatest warrior as well. Awesome! Of course
I know you were a great warrior in your day too, Socrates. But still – a
Spartan Socrates! So are we going to Sparta to see him right away?
Please!</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Aristocles – the war!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Sorry to disappoint you, Aristocles, but it was a purely
intellectual exercise. There is no ‘Spartan Socrates’. In fact I know of
no Spartan philosophers at all. In a way, that is what much of my
conversation with Hermes was about.</p>
<p>PLATO: Please tell us more.</p>
<p>[While saying this, PLATO gestures to his own SLAVE, who, well
trained, tosses him a wax-covered writing tablet from a stack that he is
carrying. PLATO catches it in one hand and pulls out a stylus.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: At one stage, Hermes made me aware of the fundamental
distinction between the Athenian approach to life and the Spartan. It is
that –</p>
<p>PLATO: Wait! Let’s all guess! This sounds fascinating.</p>
<p>I’ll start – because this is basically what my poem was about. Well,
the Spartan half of the riddle is easy: Sparta glories in war. And she
values all the associated virtues such as courage, endurance and so
on.</p>
<p>[The other COMPANIONS of Socrates murmur their assent.] We, on the
other hand – well, we value everything, don’t we! Everything good, that
is.</p>
<p>COMPANION NO. 1: Everything good? That seems a bit circular, Plato,
unless you’re going to define ‘good’ in some way that’s independent of
‘what we Athenians value’. I think I can put it more elegantly:
fighting, versus having something to fight for.</p>
<p>COMPANION NO. 2: Nice. But that’s basically ‘War versus Philosophy’,
isn’t it?</p>
<p>PLATO: [taking mock offence] And poetry.</p>
<p>COMPANION NO. 3: Could it be that Athens, whose patron deity is
female, represents the creative spirit in the world, while Sparta
favours Ares, the god of bloodlust and slaughter, whom Athena defeated
and humbled –</p>
<p>PLATO: No, no, they’re actually not that keen on Ares. They prefer
Artemis. And, strangely enough, they also revere Athena. Did you know
that?</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Speaking as an Athenian who is older than all of you and
who has seen plenty of war, may I just say that it seems to me that
Athens, despite all its glorious martial achievements, would be just as
happy to lead a quiet life and be friends with all the Greeks, and not
least with the Spartans. But unfortunately the Spartans like nothing
better than to annoy us whenever they possibly can. Though I must admit
that in that respect they are not especially worse than anyone else.
Including our allies!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Those are very interesting conjectures, all of which I
think do capture aspects of the differences between the cities. And yet
I suspect – and I may of course be mistaken –</p>
<p>PLATO: A Spartan Socrates wouldn’t be modest. Is that the
difference?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No. (By the way, I think that if anything, he would
be.)</p>
<p>I suspect that we have all been labouring under a misconception about
Sparta. Could it be that the Spartans do not seek war, as such, at all?
At least, not since they conquered their neighbours, centuries ago, and
made them helots. Perhaps, since then, they have acquired an entirely
different concern that is of overriding importance to them; and perhaps
they fight only when that concern is under threat.</p>
<p>COMPANION NO. 2: What is it? Keeping the helots down?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No, that would be only a means, not the end in itself. I
think that the god told me what their overarching concern is. And he
also told me what ours is – though alas we also fight for all sorts of
other reasons, of which we often repent.</p>
<p>Those two overarching concerns are these: we Athenians are concerned
above all with improvement; the Spartans seek only – stasis. Two
opposite objectives. If you think about it, I believe you’ll soon agree
that this is the single source of all the myriad differences between the
two cities.</p>
<p>PLATO: I never thought of it that way before, but I think I do agree.
Let me try out the theory. Here’s one difference between the cities:
Sparta has no philosophers. That’s because the job of a philosopher is
to understand things better, which is a form of change, so they don’t
want it. Another difference: they don’t honour living poets, only dead
ones. Why? Because dead poets don’t write anything new, but live ones
do. A third difference: their education system is insanely harsh; ours
is famously lax. Why? Because they don’t want their kids to dare to
question anything, so that they won’t ever think of changing anything.
How am I doing?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: You are quick on the uptake as usual, Aristocles. However
–</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Socrates, I think I know plenty of Athenians who do not
seek improvement! We have many politicians who think they’re perfect.
And many sophists who think they know everything.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: But what, specifically, do those politicians believe to be
perfect? Their own grandiose plans for how to improve the city.
Similarly, each sophist believes that everyone should adopt his ideas,
which he sees as an improvement over everything that has been believed
before. The laws and customs of Athens are set up to accommodate all
these many rival ideas of perfection (as well as more modest proposals
for improvement), to subject them to criticism, to winnow out from them
what may be the few tiny seeds of truth, and to test out those that seem
the most promising. Thus those myriad individuals who can conceive of no
improvement of themselves nevertheless add up to a city that
relentlessly seeks nothing else for itself, day and night.</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Yes, I see.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: In Sparta there are no such politicians, and no such
sophists. And no gadflies such as me, because any Spartan who did doubt
or disapprove of the way things have always been done would keep it to
himself. What few new ideas they have are intended to sustain the city
more securely in its current state. As for war, I know that there are
Spartans who glory in war, and would love to conquer and enslave the
whole world, just as they once set out to conquer their neighbours. Yet
the institutions of their city, and the deep assumptions that are built
into the minds of even the hotheads, embody a visceral fear of any such
step into the unknown. Perhaps it is significant that the statue of Ares
that stands outside Sparta represents him chained, so that he will
always be there to protect the city. Is that not the same as preventing
the god of violence from breaking discipline? From being loosed upon the
world to cause random mayhem, with its terrifying risk of change?</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Perhaps it is. In any case, I understand now, Socrates,
how a city can have ‘overarching concerns’ that are not shared by all
its citizens. However, I’m afraid I still don’t see how your theory
accounts for the enmity between our cities. First of all, I cannot
recall the Spartans ever objecting to our propensity to improve
ourselves. Instead, they cite all sorts of specific grievances about how
we are allegedly violating treaties, undermining their allies, plotting
to build an empire on the mainland and so on. Second – not that I want
to criticize the god, of course! –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: It is not impious to criticize the gods, Chaerephon, but
rational. Hermes thinks so too, for what it’s worth . . .</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘It is not impious to criticize gods.’]</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Well, even if the god is right about those two
‘overarching concerns’ of stasis and improvement, each city holds its
respective concern only for itself. It has no ambition to impose it on
anyone else. So, although Athens chooses to race forwards while Sparta
chooses to tie itself down, and although these choices may logically be
‘opposite’, how can they possibly be a source of enmity?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: My guess is this. The very existence of Athens, however
peaceful, is a deadly threat to Sparta’s stasis. And therefore, in the
long run, the condition for the continued stasis of Sparta (which means
its continued existence, as they see it) is the destruction of progress
in Athens (which from our perspective would constitute the destruction
of Athens).</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: I still do not see specifically what the threat is.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Well, suppose that in future both cities were to continue
to succeed with their overarching concerns. The Spartans would stay
exactly as they are now. But we Athenians are already the envy of other
Greeks with our wealth and diverse achievements. What will happen when
we improve further, and begin to outshine everyone in the world at
everything? Spartans seldom travel or interact with foreigners, but they
cannot keep themselves entirely in ignorance of developments elsewhere.
Even going to war gives them some inkling of what life is like in other
cities that are wealthier, and freer, than they. One day, some Spartan
youths visiting Delphi will find that it is the Athenians who have the
better ‘moves’ and the greater skill. And what if, in a generation or
two, Athenian warriors have developed some better ‘moves’ on the
battlefield?</p>
<p>PLATO: But, Socrates, even if this is true, the Spartans are unaware
of it! So how can they fear it?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: They need no prescience. Do you think that a Spartan
messenger, on reaching Athens, does not gasp in admiration like everyone
else when he sees what stands on our Acropolis?* And, however much he
may mutter (perhaps justly) about our hubris and irresponsibility, do
you think that he does not reflect, on his way home, that his city can
never and will never attract that sort of admiration from anyone? Do you
think that the Spartan elders are not at this very moment worrying about
the growing reputation of democracy in many cities, including some of
their allies?</p>
<p>By the way, we ourselves should be at least as wary of democracy as I
think the Spartans are of bloodlust and battle rage, for it is
intrinsically as dangerous. We could not do without our democracy any
more than the Spartans could do without their military training. And,
just as they have moderated the destructiveness of bloodlust through
their traditions of discipline and caution, we have moderated the
destructiveness of democracy through our traditions of virtue, tolerance
and liberty. We are utterly dependent on those traditions to keep our
monster under control and on our side, just as the Spartans are
dependent on their traditions to keep their monster from devouring them
along with everyone else in sight. We might do well to put up a statue
of democracy chained, to symbolize the fundamental safeguard of our
city.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Democracy is a monster, dangerous if not
chained.’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: The Spartans – and many others who do not understand us –
must also be wondering every day how we Athenians can possibly be
holding our own against them at the one thing in the world at which they
are the best, namely warfare. This despite the fact that at the same
time we are excelling more than ever at philosophy and poetry and drama
and mathematics and architecture and all those other fields of human
endeavour that the Spartans seldom if ever bother with.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Spartans are world’s best at warfare but suck at
everything else.’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: They need not know the reason if they can see the fact. But
the reason is: we can improve because we are constantly striving to;
they hardly ever improve, because they are trying not to! That is the
Achilles’ heel of Sparta.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles,‘Sparta’s Achilles’ heel is that they don’t
improve.’] So all they need is philosophers. With philosophers, they’d
be invincible!</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Chuckles.] In a sense, that is the case, Aristocles. But
–</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Socrates says that, with philosophers, Sparta
would be invincible.’]</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: [Worried.] Then should we really be discussing this here
at a public inn? What if someone overhears and tells them the
secret?</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Note to self: Don’t tell them!’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Don’t worry, old friend. If the Spartans in general were
capable of understanding that ‘secret’, they’d have implemented it long
ago – and there’d be no war between our cities. If some individual
Spartan tried to advocate new philosophical ideas, he would soon find
himself on trial for heresy or any number of other crimes.</p>
<p>PLATO: Unless . . .</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Unless what?</p>
<p>PLATO: Unless the one who had taken up philosophy was a king.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Trust you to find the logical loophole, Aristocles.
Theoretically you’re right, but in Sparta, even the kings are not
allowed to change anything important. If one were to try, he would be
deposed by the ephors.</p>
<p>PLATO: Well, they have two kings, five ephors and twenty-eight
senators. So mathematics tells us that if only fifteen senators, three
ephors and one king were to take up philosophy –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Laughs.] Yes, Aristocles. I concede. If the rulers of
Sparta were to take up our style of philosophy, and were then seriously
to embark upon criticizing and reforming their traditions –</p>
<p>PLATO: [Slightly distracted, scribbles, ‘Theorem: a king who’s a
philosopher is the same as a philosopher who’s a king. So, what if a
philosopher became king?’] Or perhaps it’s more likely that one
benevolent king would have seized power –</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Whatever. If they succeeded in such reforms, then their
city might indeed evolve into something truly great. But don’t hold your
breath.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Socrates says a city with a philosopher king
would be truly great.’] I won’t hold my breath. But, in the long run,
how shall we teach philosophy to kings, Socrates? [Scribbles, ‘Is the
role of philosophers to educate kings?’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: I’m not sure that philosophy should be the first step in
the education of a leader. One must have something to philosophize
about. He should know history, and literature, and arithmetic – and,
perhaps above all, he should be familiar with the deepest knowledge we
have, namely geometry.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Let no one unversed in geometry enter here!’]</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Well, I judge a city by how it treats its
philosophers.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Smiles.] An excellent criterion, Chaerephon, with which I
had better not quibble! By the way, Aristocles, I am not in the least
modest. And, to prove it, I can tell you that Hermes persuaded me that I
am wise after all – at least in one respect that he especially values,
namely that I am aware that justified belief is impossible and useless
and undesirable.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘Socrates is the wisest man in the world because
he is the only one who knows he has no knowledge, because genuine
knowledge is impossible!’] Wait! Justified belief is impossible? Really?
Are you sure?</p>
<p>SOCRATES: [Laughs loudly, while the OTHERS look on, puzzled.] Sorry,
but it’s a somewhat perverse question, Aristocles.</p>
<p>PLATO: Oh! I see.</p>
<p>[Smiles ruefully, as do the OTHERS when they realize that Plato has
just asked for a justification of the belief that one cannot justify
beliefs.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No, I am not sure of anything. I never have been. But the
god explained to me why that must be so, starting with the fallibility
of the human mind and the unreliability of sensory experience.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘It’s only knowledge of the material world that’s
impossible, useless and undesirable.’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: He gave me a marvellous perspective on how we perceive the
world. Each of your eyes is like a dark little cave, one on whose rear
wall some stray shadows fall from outside. You spend your whole life at
the back of that cave, able to see nothing but that rear wall, so you
cannot see reality directly at all.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘It is as if we were prisoners, chained inside a
cave and permitted to look only at the rear wall. We can never know the
reality outside because we see only fleeting, distorted shadows of
it.’]</p>
<p>[Note: Socrates is slightly improving on Hermes, and Plato has been
increasingly misinterpreting Socrates.]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: He then went on to explain to me that objective knowledge
is indeed possible: it comes from within! It begins as conjecture, and
is then corrected by repeated cycles of criticism, including comparison
with the evidence on our ‘wall’.</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘The only true knowledge is that which comes from
within. (How? Remembered from a previous life?)’]</p>
<p>SOCRATES: In this way, we frail and fallible humans can come to know
objective reality – provided we use philosophically sound methods as I
have described (which most people do not).</p>
<p>PLATO: [Scribbles, ‘We can come to know the true world beyond the
illusory world of experience. But only by pursuing the kingly art of
philosophy.’]</p>
<p>CHAEREPHON: Socrates, I think it was the god speaking to you, for I
strongly feel that I have glimpsed a divine truth through you today. It
will take me a long time to reorganize my ideas to take account of this
new epistemology that he revealed to you. It seems a tremendously
far-reaching, and important, subject.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Indeed. I have some reorganizing to do myself.</p>
<p>PLATO: Socrates, you really ought to write all this down – together
with all your other wisdom – for the benefit of the whole world, and
posterity.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: No need, Aristocles. Posterity is right here, listening.
Posterity is all of you, my friends. What is the point of writing down
things that are going to be endlessly tinkered with and improved? Rather
than make a permanent record of all my misconceptions as they are at a
particular instant, I would rather offer them to others in two-way
debate. That way I benefit from criticism and may even make improvements
myself. Whatever is valuable will survive such debates and be passed on
without any effort from me. Whatever is not valuable would only make me
look a fool to future generations.</p>
<p>PLATO: If you say so, Master.</p>
<p>Since Socrates left us no writings, historians of ideas can only
guess at what he really thought and taught, using the indirect evidence
of his portrayal by Plato and a few others who were there at the time
and whose accounts have survived. This is known as the ‘Socratic
problem’, and is the source of much controversy. One common view is that
the young Plato conveyed Socrates’ philosophy fairly faithfully, but
that later he used the character of Socrates more as a vehicle for
conveying his own views; that he did not even intend his dialogues to
represent the real Socrates, but used them only as convenient ways of
expressing arguments that have a to-and-fro form.</p>
<p>Perhaps I had better stress – in case it is not already obvious –
that I am doing the same. I do not intend the above dialogue accurately
to represent the philosophical opinions of the historical Socrates and
Plato. I have set it at that moment in history, with those participants,
because Socrates and his circle were among the foremost contributors to
the ‘Golden Age of Athens’, which should have become a beginning of
infinity but did not. And also because one thing that we do know about
the ancient Greeks is that the philosophical problems they considered
important have dominated Western philosophy ever since: How is knowledge
obtained? How can we distinguish between true and false, right and
wrong, reason and unreason? Which sorts of knowledge (moral, empirical,
theological, mathematical, justified . . .) are possible, and which are
mere chimeras? And so on. And therefore, although the theory of
knowledge presented in the dialogue is largely that of the
twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper, together with some addenda of
my own, I guess that Socrates would have understood and liked it. In
some universes that were very like ours at the time, he thought of it
himself.</p>
<p>I do want to make one indirect comment on the Socratic problem,
though: we habitually underestimate the difficulty of communication –
just as Socrates does at the end of the dialogue, when he assumes that
each party to a debate necessarily knows what the other is saying, and
Plato increasingly gets the wrong end of the stick. In reality, the
communication of new ideas – even mundane ones like directions – depends
on guesswork on the part of both the recipient and the communicator, and
is inherently fallible. Hence there is no reason to expect that the
young Plato, just because he was intelligent and highly educated, and by
all accounts a near-worshipper of Socrates, made the fewest mistakes in
conveying Socrates’ theories. On the contrary, the default assumption
should be that misunderstandings are ubiquitous and that neither
intelligence nor the intention to be accurate is any guarantee against
them. It could easily be that the young Plato misunderstood everything
that Socrates said to him, and that the older Plato gradually succeeded
in understanding it, and is therefore the more reliable guide. Or it
could be that Plato slipped ever further into misinterpretation, and
into positive errors of his own. Evidence, argument and explanation are
needed to distinguish between these and many other possibilities. It is
a difficult task for historians. Objective knowledge, though attainable,
is hard to attain.</p>
<p>All this holds as much for knowledge written down as for knowledge
spoken in person. So there would still be a ‘Socratic problem’ even if
Socrates had written books. Indeed, there is such a problem in regard to
the prolific Plato, and sometimes even in regard to living philosophers.
What does the philosopher mean by such and such a term or assertion?
What problem is the assertion intended to solve, and how? These are not
themselves philosophical problems. They are problems in the history of
philosophy. Yet nearly all philosophers, especially academic ones, have
devoted a great deal of their attention to them. Courses in philosophy
place great weight on reading original texts, and commentaries on them,
in order to understand the theories that were in the minds of various
great philosophers.</p>
<p>This focus on history is odd, and is in marked contrast to all other
academic disciplines (except perhaps history itself). For example, in
all the physics courses that I took at university, both as an
undergraduate and as a graduate student, I cannot recall a single
instance where any original papers or books by the great physicists of
old were studied or were even on the reading list. Only when a course
touched upon very recent discoveries did we ever read the work of their
discoverers. So we learned Einstein’s theory of relativity without ever
hearing from Einstein; we knew Maxwell, Boltzmann, Schrödinger,
Heisenberg and so on only as names. We read their theories in textbooks
whose authors were physicists (not historians of physics) who themselves
may well never have read the works of those pioneers.</p>
<p>Why? The immediate reason is that the original sources of scientific
theories are almost never good sources. How could they be? All
subsequent expositions are intended to be improvements on them, and some
succeed, and improvements are cumulative. And there is a deeper reason.
The originators of a fundamental new theory initially share many of the
misconceptions of previous theories. They need to develop an
understanding of how and why those theories are flawed, and how the new
theory explains everything that they explained. But most people who
subsequently learn the new theory have quite different concerns. Often
they just want to take the theory for granted and use it to make
predictions, or to understand some complex phenomenon in combination
with other theories. Or they may want to understand nuances of it that
have nothing to do with why it is superior to the old theories. Or they
may want to improve it. But what they no longer care about is tracking
down and definitively meeting every last objection that would naturally
be made by someone thinking in terms of older, superseded theories.
There is rarely any reason for scientists to address the obsolete
problem-situations that motivated the great scientists of the past.</p>
<p>Historians of science, in contrast, must do precisely that – and they
encounter much the same difficulties as the historians of philosophy who
address the Socratic problem. Why, then, do scientists not encounter
these difficulties when learning scientific theories? What is it that
allows such theories to be communicated through chains of intermediaries
with such apparent ease? What has happened to the ‘difficulty of
communication’ that I stressed above?</p>
<p>The first, seemingly paradoxical, half of the answer is that, when
they learn a theory, scientists are not interested in what the theory’s
originator, or anyone else along the chain of communication, believed.
When physicists read a textbook on the theory of relativity, their
immediate objective is to learn the theory, and not the opinions of
Einstein or of the textbook’s author. If that seems strange, imagine,
for the sake of argument, that a historian were to discover that
Einstein wrote his papers only as a joke, or at gunpoint, and was
actually a lifelong believer in Kepler’s laws. This would be a bizarre
and important discovery about the history of physics, and all the
textbooks about that would have to be rewritten. But our knowledge of
physics itself would be unaffected, and physics textbooks would not need
any change at all.</p>
<p>The second half of the answer is that the reason why the scientists
are trying to learn the theory, and also why they have such disregard
for faithfulness to the original, is that they want to know how the
world is. Crucially, this is the same objective that the originator of
the theory had. If it is a good theory – if it is a superb theory, as
the fundamental theories of physics nowadays are – then it is
exceedingly hard to vary while still remaining a viable explanation. So
the learners, through criticism of their initial guesses and with the
help of their books, teachers and colleagues, seeking a viable
explanation, will arrive at the same theory as the originator. That is
how the theory manages to be passed faithfully from generation to
generation, despite no one caring about its faithfulness one way or the
other.</p>
<p>Slowly, and with many setbacks, the same is becoming true in
non-scientific fields. The way to converge with each other is to
converge upon the truth.</p>
