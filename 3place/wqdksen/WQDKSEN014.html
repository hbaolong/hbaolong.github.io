<h4 id="a-physicists-history-of-bad-philosophy">12 A Physicist’s History
of Bad Philosophy</h4>
<p>With Some Comments on Bad Science</p>
<p>By the way, what I have just outlined is what I call a ‘physicist’s
history of physics’, which is never correct . . .</p>
<p>Richard Feynman, QED:</p>
<p>The Strange Theory of Light and Matter (1985)</p>
<p>READER: So, I am an emergent, quasi-autonomous flow of information in
the multiverse.</p>
<p>DAVID: You are.</p>
<p>READER: And I exist in multiple instances, some of them different
from each other, some not. And those are the least weird things about
the world according to quantum theory.</p>
<p>DAVID: Yes.</p>
<p>READER: But your argument is that we have no option but to accept the
theory’s implications, because it is the only known explanation of many
phenomena and has survived all known experimental tests.</p>
<p>DAVID: What other option would you like to have?</p>
<p>READER: I’m just summarizing.</p>
<p>DAVID: Then yes: quantum theory does have universal reach. But if all
you want to explain is how we know that there are other universes, you
don’t have to go via the full theory. You need look no further than what
a Mach–Zehnder interferometer does to a single photon: the path that was
not taken affects the one that was. Or, if you want the same thing writ
large, just think of a quantum computer: its output will depend on
intermediate results being computed in vast numbers of different
histories of the same few atoms.</p>
<p>READER: But that’s just a few atoms existing in multiple instances.
Not people.</p>
<p>DAVID: Are you claiming to be made of something other than atoms?</p>
<p>READER: Ah, I see.</p>
<p>DAVID: Also, imagine a vast cloud of instances of a single photon,
some of which are stopped by a barrier. Are they absorbed by the barrier
that we see, or is each absorbed by a different, quasi-autonomous
barrier at the same location?</p>
<p>READER: Does it make a difference?</p>
<p>DAVID: Yes. If they were all absorbed by the barrier we see, it would
vaporize.</p>
<p>READER: So it would.</p>
<p>DAVID: And we can ask – as I did in the story of the starship and the
twilight zone – what is holding up those barriers? It must be other
instances of the floor. And of the planet. And then we can consider the
experimenters who set all this up and who observe the results, and so
on.</p>
<p>READER: So that trickle of photons through the interferometer really
does provide a window on a vast multiplicity of universes.</p>
<p>DAVID: Yes. It’s another example of reach – just a small portion of
the reach of quantum theory. The explanation of those experiments in
isolation isn’t as hard to vary as the full theory. But in regard to the
existence of other universes it’s incontrovertible all the same.</p>
<p>READER: And that’s all there is to it?</p>
<p>DAVID: Yes.</p>
<p>READER: But then why is it that only a small minority of quantum
physicists agree?</p>
<p>DAVID: Bad philosophy.</p>
<p>READER: What’s that?</p>
<p>Quantum theory was discovered independently by two physicists who
reached it from different directions: Werner Heisenberg and Erwin
Schrödinger. The latter gave his name to the Schrödinger equation, which
is a way of expressing the quantum-mechanical laws of motion.</p>
<p>Both versions of the theory were formulated between 1925 and 1927,
and both explained motion, especially within atoms, in new and
astonishingly counter-intuitive ways. Heisenberg’s theory said that the
physical variables of a particle do not have numerical values. Instead,
they are matrices: large arrays of numbers which are related in
complicated, probabilistic ways to the outcomes of observations of those
variables. With hindsight, we now know that that multiplicity of
information exists because a variable has different values for different
instances of the object in the multiverse. But, at the time, neither
Heisenberg nor anyone else believed that his matrix-valued quantities
literally described what Einstein called ‘elements of reality’.</p>
<p>The Schrödinger equation, when applied to the case of an individual
particle, described a wave moving through space. But Schrödinger soon
realized that for two or more particles it did not. It did not represent
a wave with multiple crests, nor could it be resolved into two or more
waves; mathematically, it was a single wave in a higher-dimensional
space. With hindsight, we now know that such waves describe what
proportion of the instances of each particle are in each region of
space, and also the entanglement information among the particles.</p>
<p>Although Schrödinger’s and Heisenberg’s theories seemed to describe
very dissimilar worlds, neither of which was easy to relate to existing
conceptions of reality, it was soon discovered that, if a certain simple
rule of thumb was added to each theory, they would always make identical
predictions. Moreover, these predictions turned out to be very
successful.</p>
<p>With hindsight, we can state the rule of thumb like this: whenever a
measurement is made, all the histories but one cease to exist. The
surviving one is chosen at random, with the probability of each possible
outcome being equal to the total measure of all the histories in which
that outcome occurs.</p>
<p>At that point, disaster struck. Instead of trying to improve and
integrate those two powerful but slightly flawed explanatory theories,
and to explain why the rule of thumb worked, most of the
theoretical-physics community retreated rapidly and with remarkable
docility into instrumentalism. If the predictions work, they reasoned,
why worry about the explanation? So they tried to regard quantum theory
as being nothing but a set of rules of thumb for predicting the observed
outcomes of experiments, saying nothing (else) about reality. This move
is still popular today, and is known to its critics (and even to some of
its proponents) as the ‘shut-up-and-calculate interpretation of quantum
theory’.</p>
<p>This meant ignoring such awkward facts as (1) the rule of thumb was
grossly inconsistent with both theories; hence it could be used only in
situations where quantum effects were too small to be noticed. Those
happened to include the moment of measurement (because of entanglement
with the measuring instrument, and consequent decoherence, as we now
know). And (2) it was not even self- consistent when applied to the
hypothetical case of an observer performing a quantum measurement on
another observer. And (3) both versions of quantum theory were clearly
describing some sort of physical process that brought about the outcomes
of experiments. Physicists, both through professionalism and through
natural curiosity, could hardly help wondering about that process. But
many of them tried not to. Most of them went on to train their students
not to. This counteracted the scientific tradition of criticism in
regard to quantum theory.</p>
<p>Let me define ‘bad philosophy’ as philosophy that is not merely
false, but actively prevents the growth of other knowledge. In this
case, instrumentalism was acting to prevent the explanations in
Schrödinger’s and Heisenberg’s theories from being improved or
elaborated or unified.</p>
<p>The physicist Niels Bohr (another of the pioneers of quantum theory)
then developed an ‘interpretation’ of the theory which later became
known as the ‘Copenhagen interpretation’. It said that quantum theory,
including the rule of thumb, was a complete description of reality. Bohr
excused the various contradictions and gaps by using a combination of
instrumentalism and studied ambiguity. He denied the ‘possibility of
speaking of phenomena as existing objectively’ – but said that only the
outcomes of observations should count as phenomena. He also said that,
although observation has no access to ‘the real essence of phenomena’,
it does reveal relationships between them, and that, in addition,
quantum theory blurs the distinction between observer and observed. As
for what would happen if one observer performed a quantum-level
observation on another, he avoided the issue – which became known as the
‘paradox of Wigner’s friend’, after the physicist Eugene Wigner.</p>
<p>In regard to the unobserved processes between observations, where
both Schrödinger’s and Heisenberg’s theories seemed to be describing a
multiplicity of histories happening at once, Bohr proposed a new
fundamental principle of nature, the ‘principle of complementarity’. It
said that accounts of phenomena could be stated only in ‘classical
language’ – meaning language that assigned single values to physical
variables at any one time – but classical language could be used only in
regard to some variables, including those that had just been measured.
One was not permitted to ask what values the other variables had. Thus,
for instance, in response to the question ‘Which path did the photon
take?’ in the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, the reply would be that there
is no such thing as which path when the path is not observed. In
response to the question ‘Then how does the photon know which way to
turn at the final mirror, since this depends on what happened on both
paths?’, the reply would be an equivocation called ‘particle–wave
duality’: the photon is both an extended (non-zero volume) and a
localized (zero-volume) object at the same time, and one can choose to
observe either attribute but not both. Often this is expressed in the
saying ‘It is both a wave and a particle simultaneously.’ Ironically,
there is a sense in which those words are precisely true: in that
experiment the entire multiversal photon is indeed an extended object
(wave), while instances of it (particles, in histories) are localized.
Unfortunately, that is not what is meant in the Copenhagen
interpretation. There the idea is that quantum physics defies the very
foundations of reason: particles have mutually exclusive attributes,
period. And it dismisses criticisms of the idea as invalid because they
constitute attempts to use ‘classical language’ outside its proper
domain (namely describing outcomes of measurements).</p>
<p>Later, Heisenberg called the values about which one was not permitted
to ask potentialities, of which only one would become actual when a
measurement was completed. How can potentialities that do not happen
affect actual outcomes? That was left vague. What caused the transition
between ‘potential’ and ‘actual’? The implication of Bohr’s
anthropocentric language – which was made explicit in most subsequent
presentations of the Copenhagen interpretation – was that the transition
is caused by human consciousness. Thus consciousness was said to be
acting at a fundamental level in physics.</p>
<p>For decades, various versions of all that were taught as fact –
vagueness, anthropocentrism, instrumentalism and all – in university
physics courses. Few physicists claimed to understand it. None did, and
so students’ questions were met with such nonsense as ‘If you think
you’ve understood quantum mechanics then you don’t.’ Inconsistency was
defended as ‘complementarity’ or ‘duality’; parochialism was hailed as
philosophical sophistication. Thus the theory claimed to stand outside
the jurisdiction of normal (i.e. all) modes of criticism – a hallmark of
bad philosophy.</p>
<p>Its combination of vagueness, immunity from criticism, and the
prestige and perceived authority of fundamental physics opened the door
to countless systems of pseudo-science and quackery supposedly based on
quantum theory. Its disparagement of plain criticism and reason as being
‘classical’, and therefore illegitimate, has given endless comfort to
those who want to defy reason and embrace any number of irrational modes
of thought. Thus quantum theory – the deepest discovery of the physical
sciences – has acquired a reputation for endorsing practically every
mystical and occult doctrine ever proposed.</p>
<p>Not every physicist accepted the Copenhagen interpretation or its
descendants. Einstein never did. The physicist David Bohm struggled to
construct an alternative that was compatible with realism, and produced
a rather complicated theory which I regard as the multiverse theory in
heavy disguise – though he was strongly opposed to thinking of it in
that way. And in Dublin in 1952 Schrödinger gave a lecture in which at
one point he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say
might ‘seem lunatic’. It was that, when his equation seems to be
describing several different histories, they are ‘not alternatives but
all really happen simultaneously’. This is the earliest known reference
to the multiverse.</p>
<p>Here was an eminent physicist joking that he might be considered mad.
Why? For claiming that his own equation – the very one for which he had
won the Nobel prize – might be true.</p>
<p>Schrödinger never published that lecture, and seems never to have
taken the idea further. Five years later, and independently, the
physicist Hugh Everett published a comprehensive theory of the
multiverse, now known as the Everett interpretation of quantum theory.
Yet it took several more decades before Everett’s work was even noticed
by more than a handful of physicists. Even now that it has become well
known, it is endorsed by only a small minority. I have often been asked
to explain this unusual phenomenon. Unfortunately I know of no entirely
satisfactory explanation. But, to understand why it is perhaps not quite
as bizarre and isolated an event as it may appear, one has to consider
the broader context of bad philosophy.</p>
<p>Error is the normal state of our knowledge, and is no disgrace. There
is nothing bad about false philosophy. Problems are inevitable, but they
can be solved by imaginative, critical thought that seeks good
explanations. That is good philosophy, and good science, both of which
have always existed in some measure. For instance, children have always
learned language by making, criticizing and testing conjectures about
the connection between words and reality. They could not possibly learn
it in any other way, as I shall explain in Chapter 16.</p>
<p>Bad philosophy has always existed too. For instance, children have
always been told, ‘Because I say so.’ Although that is not always
intended as a philosophical position, it is worth analysing it as one,
for in four simple words it contains remarkably many themes of false and
bad philosophy. First, it is a perfect example of bad explanation: it
could be used to ‘explain’ anything. Second, one way it achieves that
status is by addressing only the form of the question and not the
substance: it is about who said something, not what they said. That is
the opposite of truth-seeking. Third, it reinterprets a request for true
explanation (why should something-or-other be as it is?) as a request
for justification (what entitles you to assert that it is so?), which is
the justified-true-belief chimera. Fourth, it confuses the nonexistent
authority for ideas with human authority (power) – a much-travelled path
in bad political philosophy. And, fifth, it claims by this means to
stand outside the jurisdiction of normal criticism.</p>
<p>Bad philosophy before the Enlightenment was typically of the
because-I-say-so variety. When the Enlightenment liberated philosophy
and science, they both began to make progress, and increasingly there
was good philosophy. But, paradoxically, bad philosophy became
worse.</p>
<p>I have said that empiricism initially played a positive role in the
history of ideas by providing a defence against traditional authorities
and dogma, and by attributing a central role – albeit the wrong one – to
experiment in science. At first, the fact that empiricism is an
impossible account of how science works did almost no harm, because no
one took it literally. Whatever scientists may have said about where
their discoveries came from, they eagerly addressed interesting
problems, conjectured good explanations, tested them, and only lastly
claimed to have induced the explanations from experiment. The bottom
line was that they succeeded: they made progress. Nothing prevented that
harmless (self-)deception, and nothing was inferred from it.</p>
<p>Gradually, though, empiricism did begin to be taken literally, and so
began to have increasingly harmful effects. For instance, the doctrine
of positivism, developed during the nineteenth century, tried to
eliminate from scientific theories everything that had not been ‘derived
from observation’. Now, since nothing is ever derived from observation,
what the positivists tried to eliminate depended entirely on their own
whims and intuitions. Occasionally these were even good. For instance,
the physicist Ernst Mach (father of Ludwig Mach of the Mach–Zehnder
interferometer), who was also a positivist philosopher, influenced
Einstein, spurring him to eliminate untested assumptions from physics –
including Newton’s assumption that time flows at the same rate for all
observers. That happened to be an excellent idea. But Mach’s positivism
also caused him to oppose the resulting theory of relativity,
essentially because it claimed that spacetime really exists even though
it cannot be ‘directly’ observed. Mach also resolutely denied the
existence of atoms, because they were too small to observe. We laugh at
this silliness now – when we have microscopes that can see atoms – but
the role of philosophy should have been to laugh at it then.</p>
<p>Instead, when the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann used atomic theory to
unify thermodynamics and mechanics, he was so vilified by Mach and other
positivists that he was driven to despair, which may have contributed to
his suicide just before the tide turned and most branches of physics
shook off Mach’s influence. From then on there was nothing to discourage
atomic physics from thriving. Fortunately also, Einstein soon rejected
positivism and became a forthright defender of realism. That was why he
never accepted the Copenhagen interpretation. I wonder: if Einstein had
continued to take positivism seriously, could he ever have thought of
the general theory of relativity, in which spacetime not only exists but
is a dynamic, unseen entity bucking and twisting under the influence of
massive objects? Or would spacetime theory have come to a juddering halt
like quantum theory did?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most philosophies of science since Mach’s have been
even worse (Popper’s being an important exception). During the twentieth
century, anti-realism became almost universal among philosophers, and
common among scientists. Some denied that the physical world exists at
all, and most felt obliged to admit that, even if it does, science has
no access to it. For example, in ‘Reflections on my Critics’ the
philosopher Thomas Kuhn wrote:</p>
<p>There is [a step] which many philosophers of science wish to take and
which I refuse. They wish, that is, to compare [scientific] theories as
representations of nature, as statements about ‘what is really out
there’.</p>
<p>Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave, eds., Criticism and the Growth of
Knowledge (1979)</p>
<p>Positivism degenerated into logical positivism, which held that
statements not verifiable by observation are not only worthless but
meaningless. This doctrine threatened to sweep away not only explanatory
scientific knowledge but the whole of philosophy. In particular: logical
positivism itself is a philosophical theory, and it cannot be verified
by observation; hence it asserts its own meaninglessness (as well as
that of all other philosophy).</p>
<p>The logical positivists tried to rescue their theory from that
implication (for instance by calling it ‘logical’, as distinct from
philosophical), but in vain. Then Wittgenstein embraced the implication
and declared all philosophy, including his own, to be meaningless. He
advocated remaining silent about philosophical problems, and, although
he never attempted to live up to that aspiration, he was hailed by many
as one of the greatest geniuses of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>One might have thought that this would be the nadir of philosophical
thinking but unfortunately there were greater depths to plumb. During
the second half of the twentieth century, mainstream philosophy lost
contact with, and interest in, trying to understand science as it was
actually being done, or how it should be done. Following Wittgenstein,
the predominant school of philosophy for a while was ‘linguistic
philosophy’, whose defining tenet was that what seem to be philosophical
problems are actually just puzzles about how words are used in everyday
life, and that philosophers can meaningfully study only that.</p>
<p>Next, in a related trend that originated in the European
Enlightenment but spread all over the West, many philosophers moved away
from trying to understand anything. They actively attacked the idea not
only of explanation and reality, but of truth, and of reason. Merely to
criticize such attacks for being self-contradictory like logical
positivism – which they were – is to give them far too much credence.
For at least the logical positivists and Wittgenstein were interested in
making a distinction between what does and does not make sense – albeit
that they advocated a hopelessly wrong one.</p>
<p>One currently influential philosophical movement goes under various
names such as postmodernism, deconstructionism and structuralism,
depending on historical details that are unimportant here. It claims
that because all ideas, including scientific theories, are conjectural
and impossible to justify, they are essentially arbitrary: they are no
more than stories, known in this context as ‘narratives’. Mixing extreme
cultural relativism with other forms of anti-realism, it regards
objective truth and falsity, as well as reality and knowledge of
reality, as mere conventional forms of words that stand for an idea’s
being endorsed by a designated group of people such as an elite or
consensus, or by a fashion or other arbitrary authority. And it regards
science and the Enlightenment as no more than one such fashion, and the
objective knowledge claimed by science as an arrogant cultural
conceit.</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, these charges are true of postmodernism itself:
it is a narrative that resists rational criticism or improvement,
precisely because it rejects all criticism as mere narrative. Creating a
successful postmodernist theory is indeed purely a matter of meeting the
criteria of the postmodernist community – which have evolved to be
complex, exclusive and authority-based. Nothing like that is true of
rational ways of thinking: creating a good explanation is hard not
because of what anyone has decided, but because there is an objective
reality that does not meet anyone’s prior expectations, including those
of authorities. The creators of bad explanations such as myths are
indeed just making things up. But the method of seeking good
explanations creates an engagement with reality, not only in science,
but in good philosophy too – which is why it works, and why it is the
antithesis of concocting stories to meet made-up criteria.</p>
<p>Although there have been signs of improvement since the late
twentieth century, one legacy of empiricism that continues to cause
confusion, and has opened the door to a great deal of bad philosophy, is
the idea that it is possible to split a scientific theory into its
predictive rules of thumb on the one hand and its assertions about
reality (sometimes known as its ‘interpretation’) on the other. This
does not make sense, because – as with conjuring tricks – without an
explanation it is impossible to recognize the circumstances under which
a rule of thumb is supposed to apply. And it especially does not make
sense in fundamental physics, because the predicted outcome of an
observation is itself an unobserved physical process.</p>
<p>Many sciences have so far avoided this split, including most branches
of physics – though relativity may have had a narrow escape, as I
mentioned. Hence in, say, palaeontology, we do not speak of the
existence of dinosaurs millions of years ago as being ‘an interpretation
of our best theory of fossils’: we claim that it is the explanation of
fossils. And, in any case, the theory of evolution is not primarily
about fossils or even dinosaurs, but about their genes, of which not
even fossils exist. We claim that there really were dinosaurs, and that
they had genes whose chemistry we know, even though there is an infinity
of possible rival ‘interpretations’ of the same data which make all the
same predictions and yet say that neither the dinosaurs nor their genes
were ever there.</p>
<p>One of them is the ‘interpretation’ that dinosaurs are only a manner
of speaking about certain sensations that palaeontologists have when
they gaze at fossils. The sensations are real, but the dinosaurs were
not. Or, if they were, we can never know of them. The latter is one of
many tangles that one gets into via the justified-true-belief theory of
knowledge – for in reality here we are, knowing of them. Then there is
the ‘interpretation’ that the fossils themselves come into existence
only when they are extracted from the rock in a manner chosen by the
palaeontologist and experienced in a way that can be communicated to
other palaeontologists. In that case, fossils are certainly no older
than the human species. And they are evidence not of dinosaurs, but only
of those acts of observation. Or one can say that dinosaurs are real,
but not as animals, only as a set of relationships between different
people’s experiences of fossils. One can then infer that there is no
sharp distinction between dinosaurs and palaeontologists, and that
‘classical language’, though unavoidable, cannot express the ineffable
relationship between them. None of those ‘interpretations’ is
empirically distinguishable from the rational explanation of fossils.
But they are ruled out for being bad explanations: all of them are
general-purpose means of denying anything. One can even use them to deny
that Schrödinger’s equation is true.</p>
<p>Since explanationless prediction is actually impossible, the
methodology of excluding explanation from a science is just a way of
holding one’s explanations immune from criticism. Let me give an example
from a distant field: psychology.</p>
<p>I have mentioned behaviourism, which is instrumentalism applied to
psychology. It became the prevailing interpretation in that field for
several decades, and, although it is now largely repudiated, research in
psychology continues to downplay explanation in favour of
stimulus-response rules of thumb. Thus, for instance, it is considered
good science to conduct behaviouristic experiments to measure the extent
to which a human psychological state such as, say, loneliness or
happiness is genetically coded (like eye colour) or not (such as date of
birth). Now, there are some fundamental problems with such a study from
an explanatory point of view. First, how can we measure whether
different people’s ratings of their own psychological state are
commensurable? That is to say, some proportion of the people claiming to
have happiness level 8 might be quite unhappy but also so pessimistic
that they cannot imagine anything much better. And some of the people
who claim only level 3 might in fact be happier than most, but have
succumbed to a craze that promises extreme future happiness to those who
can learn to chant in a certain way. And, second, if we were to find
that people with a particular gene tend to rate themselves happier than
people without it, how can we tell whether the gene is coding for
happiness? Perhaps it is coding for less reluctance to quantify one’s
happiness. Perhaps the gene in question does not affect the brain at
all, but only how a person looks, and perhaps better-looking people are
happier on average because they are treated better by others. There is
an infinity of possible explanations. But the study is not seeking
explanations.</p>
<p>It would make no difference if the experimenters tried to eliminate
the subjective self-assessment and instead observed happy and unhappy
behaviour (such as facial expressions, or how often a person whistles a
happy tune). The connection with happiness would still involve comparing
subjective interpretations which there is no way of calibrating to a
common standard; but in addition there would be an extra level of
interpretation: some people believe that behaving in ‘happy’ ways is a
remedy for unhappiness, so, for those people, such behaviours might be a
proxy for unhappiness.</p>
<p>For these reasons, no behavioural study can detect whether happiness
is inborn or not. Science simply cannot resolve that issue until we have
explanatory theories about what objective attributes people are
referring to when they speak of their happiness, and also about what
physical chain of events connects genes to those attributes.</p>
<p>So how does explanation-free science address the issue? First, one
explains that one is not measuring happiness directly, but only a proxy
such as the behaviour of marking checkboxes on a scale called
‘happiness’. All scientific measurements use chains of proxies. But, as
I explained in Chapters 2 and 3, each link in the chain is an additional
source of error, and we can avoid fooling ourselves only by criticizing
the theory of each link – which is impossible unless an explanatory
theory links the proxies to the quantities of interest. That is why, in
genuine science, one can claim to have measured a quantity only when one
has an explanatory theory of how and why the measurement procedure
should reveal its value, and with what accuracy.</p>
<p>There are circumstances under which there is a good explanation
linking the measurable proxy such as marking checkboxes with a quantity
of interest, and in such cases there need be nothing unscientific about
the study. For example, political opinion surveys may ask whether
respondents are ‘happy’ with a given politician facing re-election,
under the theory that this gives information about which checkbox the
respondents will choose in the election itself. That theory is then
tested at the election. There is no analogue of such a test in the case
of happiness: there is no independent way of measuring it. Another
example of bona-fide science would be a clinical trial to test a drug
purported to alleviate (particular identifiable types of) unhappiness.
In that case, the objective of the study is, again, to determine whether
the drug causes behaviour such as saying that one is happier (without
also experiencing adverse side effects). If a drug passes that test, the
issue of whether it really makes the patients happier, or merely alters
their personality to have lower standards or something of that sort, is
inaccessible to science until such time as there is a testable
explanatory theory of what happiness is</p>
<p>In explanationless science, one may acknowledge that actual happiness
and the proxy one is measuring are not necessarily equal. But one
nevertheless calls the proxy ‘happiness’ and moves on. One chooses a
large number of people, ostensibly at random (though in real life one is
restricted to small minorities such as university students, in a
particular country, seeking additional income), and one excludes those
who have detectable extrinsic reasons for happiness or unhappiness (such
as recent lottery wins or bereavement). So one’s subjects are just
‘typical people’ – though in fact one cannot tell whether they are
statistically representative without an explanatory theory. Next, one
defines the ‘heritability’ of a trait as its degree of statistical
correlation with how genetically related the people are. Again, that is
a non-explanatory definition: according to it, whether one was a slave
or not was once a highly ‘heritable’ trait in America: it ran in
families. More generally, one acknowledges that statistical correlations
do not imply anything about what causes what. But one adds the
inductivist equivocation that ‘they can be suggestive, though.’</p>
<p>Then one does the study and finds that ‘happiness’ is, say, 50 per
cent ‘heritable’. This asserts nothing about happiness itself, until the
relevant explanatory theories are discovered (at some time in the future
– perhaps after consciousness is understood and AIs are commonplace
technology). Yet people find the result interesting, because they
interpret it via everyday meanings of the words ‘happiness’ and
‘heritable’. Under that interpretation – which the authors of the study,
if they are scrupulous, will nowhere have endorsed – the result is a
profound contribution to a wide class of philosophical and scientific
debates about the nature of the human mind. Press reports of the
discovery will reflect this. The headline will say, ‘New Study Shows
Happiness 50% Genetically Determined’ – without quotation marks around
the technical terms.</p>
<p>So will subsequent bad philosophy. For, suppose that someone now does
dare to seek explanatory theories about the cause of human happiness.
Happiness is a state of continually solving one’s problems, they
conjecture. Unhappiness is caused by being chronically baulked in one’s
attempts to do that. And solving problems itself depends on knowing how;
so, external factors aside, unhappiness is caused by not knowing how.
(Readers may recognize this as a special case of the principle of
optimism.)</p>
<p>Interpreters of the study say that it has refuted that theory of
happiness. At most 50 per cent of unhappiness can be caused by not
knowing how, they say. The other 50 per cent is beyond our control:
genetically determined, and hence independent of what we know or
believe, pending the relevant genetic engineering. (Using the same logic
on the slavery example, one could have concluded in 1860 that, say, 95
per cent of slavery is genetically determined and therefore beyond the
power of political action to remedy.)</p>
<p>At this point – taking the step from ‘heritable’ to ‘genetically
determined’ – the explanationless psychological study has transformed
its correct but uninteresting result into something very exciting. For
it has weighed in on a substantive philosophical issue (optimism) and a
scientific issue about how the brain gives rise to mental states such as
qualia. But it has done so without knowing anything about them.</p>
<p>But wait, say the interpreters. Admittedly we can’t tell whether any
genes code for happiness (or part of it). But who cares how the genes
cause the effect – whether by conferring good looks or otherwise? The
effect itself is real.</p>
<p>The effect is real, but the experiment cannot detect how much of it
one can alter without genetic engineering, just by knowing how. That is
because the way in which those genes affect happiness may itself depend
on knowledge. For instance, a cultural change may affect what people
deem to be ‘good looks’, and that would then change whether people tend
to be made happier by virtue of having particular genes. Nothing in the
study can detect whether such a change is about to happen. Similarly, it
cannot detect whether a book will be written one day which will persuade
some proportion of the population that all evils are due to lack of
knowledge, and that knowledge is created by seeking good explanations.
If some of those people consequently create more knowledge than they
otherwise would have, and become happier than they otherwise would have
been, then part of the 50 per cent of happiness that was ‘genetically
determined’ in all previous studies will no longer be so.</p>
<p>The interpreters of the study may respond that it has proved that
there can be no such book! Certainly none of them will write such a
book, or arrive at such a thesis. And so the bad philosophy will have
caused bad science, which will have stifled the growth of knowledge.
Notice that this is a form of bad science that may well have conformed
to all the best practices of scientific method – proper randomizing,
proper controls, proper statistical analysis. All the formal rules of
‘how to keep from fooling ourselves’ may have been followed. And yet no
progress could possibly be made, because it was not being sought:
explanationless theories can do no more than entrench existing, bad
explanations.</p>
<p>It is no accident that, in the imaginary study I have described, the
outcome appeared to support a pessimistic theory. A theory that predicts
how happy people will (probably) be cannot possibly take account of the
effects of knowledge-creation. So, to whatever extent knowledge-creation
is involved, the theory is prophecy, and will therefore be biased
towards pessimism.</p>
<p>Behaviouristic studies of human psychology must, by their nature,
lead to dehumanizing theories of the human condition. For refusing to
theorize about the mind as a causative agent is the equivalent of
regarding it as a non-creative automaton.</p>
<p>The behaviourist approach is equally futile when applied to the issue
of whether an entity has a mind. I have already criticized it in Chapter
7, in regard to the Turing test. The same holds in regard to the
controversy about animal minds – such as whether the hunting or farming
of animals should be legal – which stems from philosophical disputes
about whether animals experience qualia analogous to those of humans
when in fear and pain, and, if so, which animals do. Now, science has
little to say on this matter at present, because there is as yet no
explanatory theory of qualia, and hence no way of detecting them
experimentally. But this does not stop governments from trying to pass
the political hot potato to the supposedly objective jurisdiction of
experimental science. So, for instance, in 1997 the zoologists Patrick
Bateson and Elizabeth Bradshaw were commissioned by the National Trust
to determine whether stags suffer when hunted. They reported that they
do, because the hunt is ‘grossly stressful . . . exhausting and
agonizing’. However, that assumes that the measurable quantities denoted
there by the words ‘stress’ and ‘agony’ (such as enzyme levels in the
bloodstream) signify the presence of qualia of the same names – which is
precisely what the press and public assumed that the study was supposed
to discover. The following year, the Countryside Alliance commissioned a
study of the same issue, led by the veterinary physiologist Roger
Harris, who concluded that the levels of those quantities are similar to
those of a human who is not suffering but enjoying a sport such as
football. Bateson responded – accurately – that nothing in Harris’s
report contradicted his own. But that is because neither study had any
bearing on the issue in question.</p>
<p>This form of explanationless science is just bad philosophy disguised
as science. Its effect is to suppress the philosophical debate about how
animals should be treated, by pretending that the issue has been settled
scientifically. In reality, science has, and will have, no access to
this issue until explanatory knowledge about qualia has been
discovered.</p>
<p>Another way in which explanationless science inhibits progress is
that it amplifies errors. Let me give a rather whimsical example.
Suppose you have been commissioned to measure the average number of
people who visit the City Museum each day. It is a large building with
many entrances. Admission is free, so visitors are not normally counted.
You engage some assistants. They will not need any special knowledge or
competence; in fact, as will become clear, the less competent they are,
the better your results are going to be.</p>
<p>Each morning your assistants take up their stations at the doors.
They mark a sheet of paper whenever someone enters through their door.
After the museum closes, they count all their marks, and you add
together all their counts. You do this every day for a specified period,
take the average, and that is the number that you report to your
client.</p>
<p>However, in order to claim that your count equals the number of
visitors to the museum, you need some explanatory theories. For
instance, you are assuming that the doors you are observing are
precisely the entrances to the museum, and that they lead only to the
museum. If one of them leads to the cafeteria or the museum shop as
well, you might be making a large error if your client does not consider
people who go only there to be ‘visitors to the museum’. There is also
the issue of museum staff – do they count as visitors? And there are
visitors who leave and come back on the same day, and so on. So you need
quite a sophisticated explanatory theory of what the client means by
‘visitors to the museum’ before you can devise a strategy for counting
them.</p>
<p>Suppose you count the number of people coming out as well. If you
have an explanatory theory saying that the museum is always empty at
night, and that no one enters or leaves other than through the doors,
and that visitors are never created, destroyed, split or merge, and so
on, then one possible use for the outgoing count is to check the ingoing
one: you would predict that they should be the same. Then, if they are
not the same, you will have an estimate of the accuracy of your count.
That is good science. In fact reporting your result without also making
an accuracy estimate makes your report strictly meaningless. But unless
you have an explanatory theory of the interior of the museum – which you
never see – you cannot use the outgoing count, or anything else, to
estimate your error.</p>
<p>Now, suppose you are doing your study using explanationless science
instead – which really means science with unstated, uncriticized
explanations, just as the Copenhagen interpretation really assumed that
there was only one unobserved history connecting successive
observations. Then you might analyse the results as follows. For each
day, subtract the count of people entering from the count of those
leaving. If the difference is not zero, then – and this is the key step
in the study – call that difference the ‘spontaneous-human-creation
count’ if it is positive, or the ‘spontaneous-human-destruction count’
if it is negative. If it is exactly zero, call it ‘consistent with
conventional physics’.</p>
<p>The less competent your counting and tabulating are, the more often
you will find those ‘inconsistencies with conventional physics’. Next,
prove that non-zero results (the spontaneous creation or destruction of
human beings) are inconsistent with conventional physics. Include this
proof in your report, but also include a concession that
extraterrestrial visitors would probably be able to harness physical
phenomena of which we are unaware. Also, that teleportation to or from
another location would be mistaken for ‘destruction’ (without trace) and
‘creation’ (out of thin air) in your experiment and that therefore this
cannot be ruled out as a possible cause of the anomalies.</p>
<p>When headlines appear of the form ‘Teleportation Possibly Observed in
City Museum, Say Scientists’ and ‘Scientists Prove Alien Abduction is
Real,’ protest mildly that you have claimed no such thing, that your
results are not conclusive, merely suggestive, and that more studies are
needed to determine the mechanism of this perplexing phenomenon.</p>
<p>You have made no false claim. Data can become ‘inconsistent with
conventional physics’ by the mundane means of containing errors, just as
genes can ‘cause happiness’ by countless mundane means such as affecting
your appearance. The fact that your paper does not point this out does
not make it false. Moreover, as I said, the crucial step consists of a
definition, and definitions, provided only that they are consistent,
cannot be false. You have defined an observation of more people entering
than leaving as a ‘destruction’ of people. Although, in everyday
language, that phrase has a connotation of people disappearing in puffs
of smoke, that is not what it means in this study. For all you know,
they could be disappearing in puffs of smoke, or in invisible
spaceships: that would be consistent with your data. But your paper
takes no position on that. It is entirely about the outcomes of your
observations.</p>
<p>So you had better not name your research paper ‘Errors Made When
Counting People Incompetently’. Aside from being a public-relations
blunder, that title might even be considered unscientific, according to
explanationless science. For it would be taking a position on the
‘interpretation’ of the observed data, about which it provides no
evidence.</p>
<p>In my view this is a scientific experiment in form only. The
substance of scientific theories is explanation, and explanation of
errors constitutes most of the content of the design of any non-trivial
scientific experiment.</p>
<p>As the above example illustrates, a generic feature of
experimentation is that the bigger the errors you make, either in the
numbers or in your naming and interpretation of the measured quantities,
the more exciting the results are, if true. So, without powerful
techniques of error-detection and -correction – which depend on
explanatory theories – this gives rise to an instability where false
results drown out the true. In the ‘hard sciences’ – which usually do
good science – false results due to all sorts of errors are nevertheless
common. But they are corrected when their explanations are criticized
and tested. That cannot happen in explanationless science.</p>
<p>Consequently, as soon as scientists allow themselves to stop
demanding good explanations and consider only whether a prediction is
accurate or inaccurate, they are liable to make fools of themselves.
This is the means by which a succession of eminent physicists over the
decades have been fooled by conjurers into believing that various
conjuring tricks have been done by ‘paranormal’ means.</p>
<p>Bad philosophy cannot easily be countered by good philosophy –
argument and explanation – because it holds itself immune. But it can be
countered by progress. People want to understand the world, no matter
how loudly they may deny that. And progress makes bad philosophy harder
to believe. That is not a matter of refutation by logic or experience,
but of explanation. If Mach were alive today I expect he would have
accepted the existence of atoms once he saw them through a microscope,
behaving according to atomic theory. As a matter of logic, it would
still be open to him to say, ‘I’m not seeing atoms, I’m only seeing a
video monitor. And I’m only seeing that theory’s predictions about me,
not about atoms, come true.’ But the fact that that is a general-purpose
bad explanation would be borne in upon him. It would also be open to him
to say, ‘Very well, atoms do exist, but electrons do not.’ But he might
well tire of that game if a better one seems to be available – that is
to say, if rapid progress is made. And then he would soon realize that
it is not a game.</p>
<p>Bad philosophy is philosophy that denies the possibility,
desirability or existence of progress. And progress is the only
effective way of opposing bad philosophy. If progress cannot continue
indefinitely, bad philosophy will inevitably come again into the
ascendancy – for it will be true.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>

<p>MEANING OF ‘THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY’ ENCOUNTERED IN THIS
CHAPTER</p>
<p>– The rejection of bad philosophy.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Before the Enlightenment, bad philosophy was the rule and good
philosophy the rare exception. With the Enlightenment came much more
good philosophy, but bad philosophy became much worse, with the descent
from empiricism (merely false) to positivism, logical positivism,
instrumentalism, Wittgenstein, linguistic philosophy, and the
‘postmodernist’ and related movements.</p>
<p>In science, the main impact of bad philosophy has been through the
idea of separating a scientific theory into (explanationless)
predictions and (arbitrary) interpretation. This has helped to
legitimize dehumanizing explanations of human thought and behaviour. In
quantum theory, bad philosophy manifested itself mainly as the
Copenhagen interpretation and its many variants, and as the
‘shut-up-and-calculate’ interpretation. These appealed to doctrines such
as logical positivism to justify systematic equivocation and to immunize
themselves from criticism.</p>
