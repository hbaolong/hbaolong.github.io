<h4 id="creation">4 Creation</h4>
<p>The knowledge in human brains and the knowledge in biological
adaptations are both created by evolution in the broad sense: the
variation of existing information, alternating with selection. In the
case of human knowledge, the variation is by conjecture, and the
selection is by criticism and experiment. In the biosphere, the
variation consists of mutations (random changes) in genes, and natural
selection favours the variants that most improve the ability of their
organisms to reproduce, thus causing those variant genes to spread
through the population.</p>
<p>That a gene is adapted to a given function means that few, if any,
small changes would improve its ability to perform that function. Some
changes might make no practical difference to that ability, but most of
those that did would make it worse. In other words good adaptations,
like good explanations, are distinguished by being hard to vary while
still fulfilling their functions.</p>
<p>Human brains and DNA molecules each have many functions, but among
other things they are general-purpose information-storage media: they
are in principle capable of storing any kind of information. Moreover,
the two types of information that they respectively evolved to store
have a property of cosmic significance in common: once they are
physically embodied in a suitable environment, they tend to cause
themselves to remain so. Such information – which I call knowledge – is
very unlikely to come into existence other than through the
error-correcting processes of evolution or thought.</p>
<p>There are also important differences between those two kinds of
knowledge. One is that biological knowledge is non-explanatory, and
therefore has limited reach; explanatory human knowledge can have broad
or even unlimited reach. Another difference is that mutations are
random, while conjectures can be constructed intentionally for a
purpose. Nevertheless, the two kinds of knowledge share enough of their
underlying logic for the theory of evolution to be highly relevant to
human knowledge. In particular, some historic misconceptions about
biological evolution have counterparts in misconceptions about human
knowledge. So in this chapter I shall describe some of those
misconceptions in addition to the actual explanation of biological
adaptations, namely modern Darwinian evolutionary theory, sometimes
known as ‘neo-Darwinism’.</p>
<p>Creationism</p>
<p>Creationism is the idea that some supernatural being or beings
designed and created all biological adaptations. In other words, ‘the
gods did it.’ As I explained in Chapter 1, theories of that form are bad
explanations. Unless supplemented by hard-to-vary specifics, they do not
even address the problem – just as ‘the laws of physics did it’ will
never win you a Nobel prize, and ‘the conjurer did it’ does not solve
the mystery of the conjuring trick.</p>
<p>Before a conjuring trick is ever performed, its explanation must be
known to the person who invented it. The origin of that knowledge is the
origin of the trick. Similarly, the problem of explaining the biosphere
is that of explaining how the knowledge embodied in its adaptations
could possibly have been created. In particular, a putative designer of
any organism must also have created the knowledge of how that organism
works. Creationism thus faces an inherent dilemma: is the designer a
purely supernatural being – one who was ‘just there’, complete with all
that knowledge – or not? A being who was ‘just there’ would serve no
explanatory purpose (in regard to the biosphere), since then one could
more economically say that the biosphere itself ‘just happened’,
complete with that same knowledge, embodied in organisms. On the other
hand, to whatever extent a creationist theory provides explanations
about how supernatural beings designed and created the biosphere, they
are no longer supernatural beings but merely unseen ones. They might,
for instance, be an extraterrestrial civilization. But then the theory
is not really creationism – unless it proposes that the extraterrestrial
designers themselves had supernatural designers.</p>
<p>Moreover, the designer of any adaptation must by definition have had
the intention that the adaptation be as it is. But that is hard to
reconcile with the designer envisaged in virtually all creationist
theories, namely a deity or deities worthy of worship; for the reality
is that many biological adaptations have distinctly suboptimal features.
For instance, the eyes of vertebrates have their ‘wiring’ and blood
supply in front of the retina, where they absorb and scatter incoming
light and so degrade the image. There is also a blind spot where the
optic nerve passes through the retina on its way to the brain. The eyes
of some invertebrates, such as squids, have the same basic design but
without those design flaws. The effect of the flaws on the efficiency of
the eye is small; but the point is that they are wholly contrary to the
eye’s functional purpose, and so conflict with the idea that that
purpose was intended by a divine designer. As Charles Darwin put it in
The Origin of Species, ‘On the view of each organism with all its
separate parts having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable
is it that organs bearing the plain stamp of inutility . . . should so
frequently occur.’</p>
<p>There are even examples of non-functional design. For instance, most
animals have a gene for synthesizing vitamin C, but in primates,
including humans, though that gene is recognizably present, it is
faulty: it does not do anything. This is very difficult to account for
except as a vestigial feature that primates have inherited from
non-primate ancestors. One could retreat to the position that all these
apparently poor design features do have some undiscovered purpose. But
that is a bad explanation: it could be used to claim that any poorly
designed or undesigned entity was perfectly designed.</p>
<p>Another assumed characteristic of the designer according to most
religions is benevolence. But, as I mentioned in Chapter 3, the
biosphere is much less pleasant for its inhabitants than anything that a
benevolent, or even halfway decent, human designer would design. In
theological contexts this is known as ‘the problem of suffering’ or ‘the
problem of evil’, and is frequently used as an argument against the
existence of God. But in that role it is easily brushed off. Typical
defences are that perhaps morality is different for a supernatural
being; or perhaps we are too limited intellectually to be able to
understand how moral the biosphere really is. However, here I am
concerned not with whether God exists, only with how to explain
biological adaptations, and in that regard those defences of creationism
have the same fatal flaw as the Haldane–Dawkins argument (Chapter 3): a
world that is ‘queerer than we can suppose’ is indistinguishable from a
world ‘tricked out with magic’. So all such explanations are bad.</p>
<p>The central flaw of creationism – that its account of how the
knowledge in adaptations could possibly be created is either missing,
supernatural or illogical – is also the central flaw of
pre-Enlightenment, authoritative conceptions of human knowledge. In some
versions it is literally the same theory, with certain types of
knowledge (such as cosmology or moral knowledge and other rules of
behaviour) being spoken to early humans by supernatural beings. In
others, parochial features of society (such as the existence of monarchs
in government, or indeed the existence of God in the universe) are
protected by taboos or taken so uncritically for granted that they are
not even recognized as ideas. And I shall discuss the evolution of such
ideas and institutions in Chapter 15.</p>
<p>The prospect of the unlimited creation of knowledge in the future
conflicts with creationism by undercutting its motivation. For
eventually, with the assistance of what we would consider stupendously
powerful computers, any child will be capable of designing and
implementing a better, more complex, more beautiful, and also far more
moral biosphere than the Earth’s, within a video game – perhaps by
placing it in such a state by fiat, or perhaps by inventing fictional
laws of physics that are more conducive to enlightenments than the
actual laws. At that point, a supposed designer of our biosphere will
seem not only morally deficient, but intellectually unremarkable. And
the latter attribute is not so easy to brush aside. Religions will no
longer want to claim the design of the biosphere as one of the
achievements of their deities, just as today they no longer bother to
claim thunder.</p>
<p>Spontaneous generation</p>
<p>Spontaneous generation is the formation of organisms not as offspring
of other organisms, but entirely from non-living precursors – for
example, the generation of mice from a pile of rags in a dark corner.
The theory that small animals are being spontaneously generated like
that all the time (in addition to reproducing in the normal way) was
part of unquestioned conventional wisdom for millennia, and was taken
seriously until well into the nineteenth century. Its defenders
gradually retreated to ever smaller animals as knowledge of zoology
grew, until eventually the debate was confined to what are now called
micro-organisms – things like fungi and bacteria that grow on nutrient
media. For those, it proved remarkably difficult to refute spontaneous
generation experimentally. For instance, experiments could not be done
in airtight containers in case air was necessary for spontaneous
generation. But it was finally refuted by some ingenious experiments
conducted by the biologist Louis Pasteur in 1859 – the same year in
which Darwin published his theory of evolution.</p>
<p>But experiment should never have been needed to convince scientists
that spontaneous generation is a bad theory. A conjuring trick cannot
have been performed by real magic – by the magician simply commanding
events to happen – but must have been brought about by knowledge that
was somehow created beforehand. Similarly, biologists need only have
asked: how does the knowledge to construct a mouse get to those rags,
and how is it then applied to transform the rags into a mouse?</p>
<p>One attempted explanation of spontaneous generation, which was
advocated by the theologian St Augustine of Hippo (354–430), was that
all life comes from ‘seeds’, some of which are carried by living
organisms and others of which are distributed all over the Earth. Both
kinds of seed were created during the original creation of the world.
Both could, under the right conditions, develop into new individuals of
the appropriate species. Augustine ingeniously suggested that this might
explain why Noah’s Ark did not have to carry impossibly large numbers of
animals: most species could regenerate after the Flood without Noah’s
help. However, under that theory organisms are not being formed purely
from non-living raw materials. That distributed kind of seed would be a
life form, just as a real seed is: it would contain all the knowledge in
its organism’s adaptations. So Augustine’s theory – as he himself
stressed – is really just a form of creationism, not spontaneous
generation. Some religions regard the universe as an ongoing act of
supernatural creation. In such a world, all spontaneous generation would
fall under the heading of creationism.</p>
<p>But, if we insist on good explanations, we must rule out creationism,
as I have explained. So, in regard to spontaneous generation, that
leaves only the possibility that the laws of physics might simply
mandate it. For instance, mice might simply form under suitable
circumstances, like crystals, rainbows, tornadoes and quasars do.</p>
<p>That seems absurd today, because the actual molecular mechanisms of
life are now known. But is there anything wrong with that theory itself,
as an explanation? Phenomena such as rainbows have a distinctive
appearance that is endlessly repeated without any information having
been transmitted from one instance to the next. Crystals even behave in
ways that are reminiscent of living things: when placed in a suitable
solution, a crystal attracts more molecules of the right kind and
arranges them in such a way as to make more of the same crystal. Since
crystals and mice both obey the same laws of physics, why is spontaneous
generation a good explanation of the former and not of the latter? The
answer, ironically, comes from an argument that was originally intended
to justify creationism:</p>
<p>The argument from design</p>
<p>The ‘argument from design’ has been used for millennia as one of the
classic ‘proofs’ of the existence of God, as follows. Some aspects of
the world appear to have been designed, but they were not designed by
humans; since ‘design requires a designer’, there must therefore be a
God. As I said, that is a bad explanation because it does not address
how the knowledge of how to create such designs could possibly have been
created. (‘Who designed the designer?’, and so on.) But the argument
from design can be used in valid ways too, and indeed its earliest known
use, by the ancient Athenian philosopher Socrates, was valid. This issue
was: given that the gods have created the world, do they care what
happens in it? Socrates’ pupil Aristodemus had argued that they do not.
Another pupil, the historian Xenophon, recalled Socrates’ reply:</p>
<p>SOCRATES: Because our eyes are delicate, they have been shuttered
with eyelids that open when we have occasion to use them . . . And our
foreheads have been fringed with eyebrows to prevent damage from the
sweat of the head . . . And the mouth set close to the eyes and nostrils
as a portal of ingress for all our supplies, whereas, since matter
passing out of the body is unpleasant, the outlets are directed
hindwards, as far away from the senses as possible. I ask you, when you
see all these things constructed with such show of foresight, can you
doubt whether they are products of chance or design?</p>
<p>ARISTODEMUS: Certainly not! Viewed in this light they seem very much
like the contrivances of some wise craftsman, full of love for all
things living.</p>
<p>SOCRATES: And what of the implanting of the instinct to procreate;
and in the mother, the instinct to rear her young; and in the young, the
intense desire to live and the fear of death?</p>
<p>ARISTODEMUS: These provisions too seem like the contrivances of
someone who has determined that there shall be living creatures.</p>
<p>Socrates was right to point out that the appearance of design in
living things is something that needs to be explained. It cannot be the
‘product of chance’. And that is specifically because it signals the
presence of knowledge. How was that knowledge created?</p>
<p>However, Socrates never stated what constitutes an appearance of
design, and why. Do crystals and rainbows have it? Does the sun, or
summer? How are they different from biological adaptations such as
eyebrows?</p>
<p>The issue of what exactly needs to be explained in an ‘appearance of
design’ was first addressed by the clergyman William Paley, the finest
exponent of the argument from design. In 1802, before Darwin was born,
he published the following thought experiment in his book Natural
Theology. He imagined walking across a heath and finding a stone, or
alternatively a watch. In either case, he imagined wondering how the
object came to exist. And he explained why the watch would require a
wholly different kind of explanation from that of the stone. For all he
knew, he said, the stone might have lain there for ever. Today we know
more about the history of the Earth, so we should refer instead to
supernovae, transmutation and the Earth’s cooling crust. But that would
make no difference to Paley’s argument. His point was: that sort of
account can explain how the stone came to exist, or the raw materials
for the watch, but it could never explain the watch itself. A watch
could not have been lying there for ever, nor could it have formed
during the solidification of the Earth. Unlike the stone, or a rainbow
or a crystal, it could not have assembled itself by spontaneous
generation from its raw materials, nor could it be a raw material. But
why not, exactly, asked Paley: ‘Why should not this answer serve for the
watch as well as for the stone; why is it not as admissible in the
second case as in the first?’ And he knew why. Because the watch not
only serves a purpose, it is adapted to that purpose:</p>
<p>For this reason, and for no other, viz., that, when we come to
inspect the watch, we perceive (what we could not discover in the stone)
that its several parts are framed and put together for a purpose, e.g.,
that they are so formed and adjusted as to produce motion, and that
motion so regulated as to point out the hour of the day.</p>
<p>One cannot explain why the watch is as it is without referring to its
purpose of keeping accurate time. Like the telescopes that I discussed
in Chapter 2, it is a rare configuration of matter. It is not a
coincidence that it can keep time accurately, nor that its components
are well suited to that task, nor that they were put together in that
way rather than another. Hence people must have designed that watch.
Paley was of course implying that all this is even more true of a living
organism – say, a mouse. Its ‘several parts’ are all constructed (and
appear to be designed) for a purpose. For instance, the lenses in its
eyes have a purpose similar to that of a telescope, of focusing light to
form an image on its retina, which in turn has the purpose of
recognizing food, danger and so on.</p>
<p>Actually, Paley did not know the overall purpose of the mouse (though
we do now – see ‘Neo-Darwinism’ below). But even a single eye would
suffice to make Paley’s triumphant point – namely that the evidence of
apparent design for a purpose is not only that the parts all serve that
purpose, but that if they were slightly altered they would serve it less
well, or not at all. A good design is hard to vary:</p>
<p>If the different parts had been differently shaped from what they
are, of a different size from what they are, or placed after any other
manner, or in any other order, than that in which they are placed,
either no motion at all would have been carried on in the machine, or
none which would have answered the use that is now served by it.</p>
<p>Merely being useful for a purpose, without being hard to vary while
still serving that purpose, is not a sign of adaptation or design. For
instance, one can also use the sun to keep time, but all its features
would serve that purpose equally well if slightly (or even massively)
altered. Just as we transform many of the Earth’s non-adapted raw
materials to meet our purposes, so we also find uses for the sun that it
was never designed or adapted to provide. The knowledge, in that case,
is entirely in us – and in our sundials – not in the sun. But it is
embodied in the watch, and in the mouse.</p>
<p>So, how did all that knowledge come to be embodied in those things?
As I said, Paley could conceive of only one explanation. That was his
first mistake:</p>
<p>The inference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a
maker . . . There cannot be design without a designer; contrivance
without a contriver; order without choice; arrangement without anything
capable of arranging; subserviency and relation to a purpose without
that which could intend a purpose; means suitable to an end . . .
without the end ever having been contemplated or the means accommodated
to it. Arrangement, disposition of parts, subserviency of means to an
end, relation of instruments to a use imply the presence of intelligence
and mind.</p>
<p>We now know that there can be ‘design without a designer’: knowledge
without a person who created it. Some types of knowledge can be created
by evolution. I shall come to that shortly. But it is no criticism of
Paley that he was unaware of a discovery that had yet to be made – one
of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.</p>
<p>However, although Paley was spot on in his understanding of the
problem, he somehow did not realize that his proposed solution,
creationism, does not solve it, and is even ruled out by his own
argument. For the ultimate designer for whose existence Paley was
arguing would also be a purposeful and complex entity – certainly no
less so than a watch or a living organism. Hence, as many critics have
since noticed, if we substitute ‘ultimate designer’ for ‘watch’ in
Paley’s text above, we force Paley to ‘the [inevitable] inference . . .
that the ultimate designer must have had a maker’. Since that is a
contradiction, the argument from design as perfected by Paley rules out
the existence of an ultimate designer.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a disproof of the existence of God, any more
than the original argument was a proof. But it does show that, in any
good explanation of the origin of biological adaptations, God cannot
play the role assigned by creationism. Though this is the opposite of
what Paley believed he had achieved, none of us can choose what our
ideas imply. His argument has universal reach for anything that has, by
his criterion, the appearance of design. As an elucidation of the
special status of living things, and in setting a benchmark that
explanations of knowledge-laden entities must meet if they are to make
sense, it is essential to understanding the world.</p>
<p>Lamarckism</p>
<p>Before Darwin’s theory of evolution, people had already been
wondering whether the biosphere and its adaptations might have come into
existence gradually. Darwin’s grandfather Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802), a
stalwart of the Enlightenment, was among them. They called that process
‘evolution’, but the meaning of the word then was different from its
primary one today. All processes of gradual improvement, regardless of
their mechanism, were known as ‘evolution’. (That terminology survives
to this day in casual usage and as a technical term in, of all places,
theoretical physics, where ‘evolution’ means any sort of continuous
change that one is explaining through laws of physics.) Charles Darwin
distinguished the process that he discovered by calling it ‘evolution by
natural selection’ – though a better name would have been ‘evolution by
variation and selection’.</p>
<p>As Paley might well have recognized if he had lived to hear of it,
‘evolution by natural selection’ is a much more substantive mode of
explanation than mere ‘evolution’. For the latter does not solve his
problem, while the former does. Any theory about improvement raises the
question: how is the knowledge of how to make that improvement created?
Was it already present at the outset? The theory that it was is
creationism. Did it ‘just happen’? The theory that it did is spontaneous
generation.</p>
<p>During the early years of the nineteenth century, the naturalist
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed an answer that is now known as
Lamarckism. Its key idea is that improvements acquired by an organism
during its lifetime can be inherited by its offspring. Lamarck was
thinking mainly of improvements in the organism’s organs, limbs and so
on – such as, for instance, the enlargement and strengthening of muscles
that an individual uses heavily, and the weakening of those that it
seldom uses. This ‘use-and-disuse’ explanation had also been arrived at
independently by Erasmus Darwin. A classic Lamarckian explanation is
that giraffes, when eating leaves from trees whose lower-lying leaves
were already eaten, stretched their necks to get at the higher ones.
This supposedly lengthened their necks slightly, and then their
offspring inherited the trait of having slightly longer necks. Thus,
over many generations, long-necked giraffes evolved from ancestors with
unremarkable necks. In addition, Lamarck proposed that improvements were
driven by a tendency, built into the laws of nature, towards ever
greater complexity.</p>
<p>The latter is a fudge, for not just any complexity could account for
the evolution of adaptations: it has to be knowledge. And so that part
of the theory is just invoking spontaneous generation – unexplained
knowledge. Lamarck might not have minded that, because, like many
thinkers of his day, he took the existence of spontaneous generation for
granted. He even incorporated it explicitly into his theory of
evolution: he guessed that, as successive generations of organisms are
forced by his law of nature to take ever more complex forms, we still
see simple creatures because a continuous supply of them is formed
spontaneously.</p>
<p>Some have considered this a pretty vision. But it bears hardly any
resemblance to the facts. Its most glaring mismatch is that, in reality,
evolutionary adaptations are of a wholly different character from the
changes that take place in an individual during its lifetime. The former
involve the creation of new knowledge; the latter happen only when there
is already an adaptation for making that change. For instance, the
tendency of muscles to become stronger or weaker with use and disuse is
controlled by a sophisticated (knowledge-laden) set of genes. The
animal’s distant ancestors did not have those genes. Lamarckism cannot
possibly explain how the knowledge in them was created.</p>
<p>If you were starved of vitamin C, your defective vitamin-C-synthesis
gene would not thereby be caused to improve – unless, perhaps, you are a
genetic engineer. If a tiger is placed in a habitat in which its
colouration makes it stand out more instead of less, it takes no action
to change the colour of its fur, nor would that change be inherited if
it did. That is because nothing in the tiger ‘knows’ what the stripes
are for. So how would any Lamarckian mechanism have ‘known’ that having
fur that was a tiny bit more striped would slightly improve the animal’s
food supply? And how would it have ‘known’ how to synthesize pigments,
and to secrete them into the fur, in such a way as to produce stripes of
a suitable design?</p>
<p>The fundamental error being made by Lamarck has the same logic as
inductivism. Both assume that new knowledge (adaptations and scientific
theories respectively) is somehow already present in experience, or can
be derived mechanically from experience. But the truth is always that
knowledge must be first conjectured and then tested. That is what
Darwin’s theory says: first, random mutations happen (they do not take
account of what problem is being solved); then natural selection
discards the variant genes that are less good at causing themselves to
be present again in future generations.</p>
<p>Neo-Darwinism</p>
<p>The central idea of neo-Darwinism is that evolution favours the genes
that spread best through the population. There is much more to this idea
than meets the eye, as I shall explain.</p>
<p>A common misconception about Darwinian evolution is that it maximizes
‘the good of the species’. That provides a plausible, but false,
explanation of apparently altruistic behaviour in nature, such as
parents risking their lives to protect their young, or the strongest
animals going to the perimeter of a herd under attack – thereby
decreasing their own chances of having a long and pleasant life or
further offspring. Thus, it is said, evolution optimizes the good of the
species, not the individual. But, in reality, evolution optimizes
neither.</p>
<p>To see why, consider this thought experiment. Imagine an island on
which the total number of birds of a particular species would be
maximized if they nested at, say, the beginning of April. The
explanation for why a particular date is optimal will refer to various
trade-offs involving factors such as temperature, the prevalence of
predators, the availability of food and nesting materials, and so on.
Suppose that initially the whole population has genes that cause them to
nest at that optimum time. That would mean that those genes were well
adapted to maximizing the number of birds in the population – which one
might call ‘maximizing the good of the species’.</p>
<p>Now suppose that this equilibrium is disturbed by the advent of a
mutant gene in a single bird which causes it to nest slightly earlier –
say, at the end of March. Assume that when a bird has built a nest, the
species’ other behavioural genes are such that it automatically gets
whatever cooperation it needs from a mate. That pair of birds would then
be guaranteed the best nesting site on the island – an advantage which,
in terms of the survival of their offspring, might well outweigh all the
slight disadvantages of nesting earlier. In that case, in the following
generation, there will be more March-nesting birds, and, again, all of
them will find excellent nesting sites. That means that a smaller
proportion than usual of the April-nesting variety will find good sites:
the best sites will have been taken by the time they start looking. In
subsequent generations, the balance of the population will keep shifting
towards the March-nesting variants. If the relative advantage of having
the best nesting sites is large enough, the April-nesting variant could
even become extinct. If it arises again as a mutation, its holder will
have no offspring, because all sites will have been taken by the time it
tries to nest.</p>
<p>Thus the original situation that we imagined – with genes that were
optimally adapted to maximizing the population (‘benefiting the
species’) – is unstable. There will be evolutionary pressure to make the
genes become less well adapted to that function.</p>
<p>This change has harmed the species, in the sense of reducing its
total population (because the birds are no longer nesting at the optimum
time). It may thereby also have harmed it by increasing the risk of
extinction, making it less likely to spread to other habitats, and so
on. So an optimally adapted species may in this way evolve into one that
is less ‘well off’ by any measure.</p>
<p>If a further mutant gene then appears, causing nesting still earlier
in March, the same process may be repeated, with the earlier-nesting
genes taking over and the total population falling again. Evolution will
thus drive the nesting time ever earlier, and the population lower. A
new equilibrium would be reached only when the advantage to an
individual bird’s offspring of getting the very best nesting site was
finally outweighed by the disadvantages of slightly earlier nesting.
That equilibrium might be very far from what was optimal for the
species.</p>
<p>A related misconception is that evolution is always adaptive – that
it always constitutes progress, or at least some sort of improvement in
useful functionality which it then acts to optimize. This is often
summed up in a phrase due to the philosopher Herbert Spencer, and
unfortunately taken up by Darwin himself: ‘the survival of the fittest’.
But, as the above thought experiment illustrates, that is not the case
either. Not only has the species been harmed by this evolutionary
change, every individual bird has been harmed as well: the birds using
any particular site now have a harsher life than before, because they
are using it earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the
theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes
progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.</p>
<p>What exactly has the evolution of those birds achieved during that
period? It has optimized not the functional adaptation of a variant gene
to its environment – the attribute that would have impressed Paley – but
the relative ability of the surviving variant to spread through the
population. An April-nesting gene is no longer able to propagate itself
to the next generation, even though it is functionally the best variant.
The early-nesting gene that replaced it may still be tolerably
functional, but it is fittest for nothing except preventing variants of
itself from procreating. From the point of view of both the species and
all its members, the change brought about by this period of its
evolution has been a disaster. But evolution does not ‘care’ about that.
It favours only the genes that spread best through the population.</p>
<p>Evolution can even favour genes that are not just suboptimal, but
wholly harmful to the species and all its individuals. A famous example
is the peacock’s large, colourful tail, which is believed to diminish
the bird’s viability by making it harder to evade predators, and to have
no useful function at all. Genes for prominent tails dominate simply
because peahens tend to choose prominent-tailed males as mates. Why was
there selection pressure in favour of such preferences? One reason is
that, when females mated with prominent-tailed males, their male
offspring, having more prominent tails, found more mates. Another may be
that an individual able to grow a large, colourful tail is more likely
to be healthy. In any case, the net effect of all the selection
pressures was to spread genes for large, colourful tails, and genes for
preferring such tails, through the population. The species and the
individuals just had to suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>If the best-spreading genes impose sufficiently large disadvantages
on the species, the species becomes extinct. Nothing in biological
evolution prevents that. It has presumably happened many times in the
history of life on Earth, to species less lucky than the peacock.
Dawkins named his tour-de-force account of neo-Darwinism The Selfish
Gene because he wanted to stress that evolution does not especially
promote the ‘welfare’ of species or individual organisms. But, as he
also explained, it does not promote the ‘welfare’ of genes either: it
adapts them not for survival in larger numbers, nor indeed for survival
at all, but only for spreading through the population at the expense of
rival genes, particularly slight variants of themselves.</p>
<p>Is it sheer luck, then, that most genes do usually confer some,
albeit less than optimal, functional benefits on their species, and on
their individual holders? No. Organisms are the slaves, or tools, that
genes use to achieve their ‘purpose’ of spreading themselves through the
population. (That is the ‘purpose’ that Paley and even Darwin never
guessed.) Genes gain advantages over each other in part by keeping their
slaves alive and healthy, just as human slave owners did. Slave owners
were not working for the benefit of their workforces, nor for the
benefit of individual slaves: it was solely to achieve their own
objectives that they fed and housed their slaves, and indeed forced them
to reproduce. Genes do much the same thing.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the phenomenon of reach: when the knowledge in
a gene happens to have reach, it will help the individual to help itself
in a wider range of circumstances, and by more, than the spreading of
the gene strictly requires. That is why mules stay alive even though
they are sterile. So it is not surprising that genes usually confer some
benefits on their species and its members, and do often succeed in
increasing their own absolute numbers. Nor should it be surprising that
they sometimes do the opposite. But what genes are adapted to – what
they do better than almost any variant of themselves – has nothing to do
with the species or the individuals or even their own survival in the
long run. It is getting themselves replicated more than rival genes.</p>
<p>Neo-Darwinism and knowledge</p>
<p>Neo-Darwinism does not refer, at its fundamental level, to anything
biological. It is based on the idea of a replicator (anything that
contributes causally to its own copying).* For instance, a gene
conferring the ability to digest a certain type of food causes the
organism to remain healthy in some situations where it would otherwise
weaken or die. Hence it increases the organism’s chances of having
offspring in the future, and those offspring would inherit, and spread,
copies of the gene.</p>
<p>Ideas can be replicators too. For example, a good joke is a
replicator: when lodged in a person’s mind, it has a tendency to cause
that person to tell it to other people, thus copying it into their
minds. Dawkins coined the term memes (rhymes with ‘dreams’) for ideas
that are replicators. Most ideas are not replicators: they do not cause
us to convey them to other people. Nearly all long-lasting ideas,
however, such as languages, scientific theories and religious beliefs,
and the ineffable states of mind that constitute cultures such as being
British, or the skill of performing classical music, are memes (or
‘memeplexes’ – collections of interacting memes). I shall say more about
memes in Chapter 15.</p>
<p>The most general way of stating the central assertion of the
neo-Darwinian theory of evolution is that a population of replicators
subject to variation (for instance by imperfect copying) will be taken
over by those variants that are better than their rivals at causing
themselves to be replicated. This is a surprisingly deep truth which is
commonly criticized either for being too obvious to be worth stating or
for being false. The reason, I think, is that, although it is
self-evidently true, it is not self-evidently the explanation of
specific adaptations. Our intuition prefers explanations in terms of
function or purpose: what does a gene do for its holder, or for its
species? But we have just seen that the genes generally do not optimize
such functionality.</p>
<p>So the knowledge embodied in genes is knowledge of how to get
themselves replicated at the expense of their rivals. Genes often do
this by imparting useful functionality to their organism, and in those
cases their knowledge incidentally includes knowledge about that
functionality. Functionality, in turn, is achieved by encoding, into
genes, regularities in the environment and sometimes even rule-of-thumb
approximations to laws of nature, in which case the genes are
incidentally encoding that knowledge too. But the core of the
explanation for the presence of a gene is always that it got itself
replicated more than its rival genes.</p>
<p>Non-explanatory human knowledge can also evolve in an analogous way:
rules of thumb are not passed on perfectly to the next generation of
users, and the ones that survive in the long run are not necessarily the
ones that optimize the ostensible function. For instance, a rule that is
expressed in an elegant rhyme may be remembered, and repeated, better
than one that is more accurate but expressed in ungainly prose. Also, no
human knowledge is entirely non-explanatory. There is always at least a
background of assumptions about reality against which the meaning of a
rule of thumb is understood, and that background can make some false
rules of thumb seem plausible.</p>
<p>Explanatory theories evolve through a more complicated mechanism.
Accidental errors in transmission and memory still play a role, but a
much smaller one. That is because good explanations are hard to vary
even without being tested, and hence random errors in the transmission
of a good explanation are easier for the receiver to detect and correct.
The most important source of variation in explanatory theories is
creativity. For instance, when people are trying to understand an idea
that they hear from others, they typically understand it to mean what
makes most sense to them, or what they are most expecting to hear, or
what they fear to hear, and so on. Those meanings are conjectured by the
listener or reader, and may differ from what the speaker or writer
intended. In addition, people often try to improve explanations even
when they have received them accurately: they make creative amendments,
spurred by their own criticism. If they then pass the explanation on to
others, they usually try to pass on what they consider to be the
improved version.</p>
<p>Unlike genes, many memes take different physical forms every time
they are replicated. People rarely express ideas in exactly the same
words in which they heard them. They also translate from one language to
another, and between spoken and written language, and so on. Yet we
rightly call what is transmitted the same idea – the same meme –
throughout. Thus, in the case of most memes, the real replicator is
abstract: it is the knowledge itself. This is in principle true of genes
as well: biotechnology routinely transcribes genes into the memories of
computers, where they are stored in a different physical form. Those
records could be translated back into DNA strands and implanted in
different animals. The only reason this is not yet a common practice is
that it is easier to copy the original gene. But one day the genes of a
rare species could survive its extinction by causing themselves to be
stored on a computer and then implanted into a cell of a different
species. I say ‘causing themselves to be stored’ because the
biotechnologists would not be recording information indiscriminately,
but only information that met a criterion such as ‘gene of an endangered
species’. The ability to interest biotechnologists in this way would
then be part of the reach of the knowledge in those genes.</p>
<p>So, both human knowledge and biological adaptations are abstract
replicators: forms of information which, once they are embodied in a
suitable physical system, tend to remain so while most variants of them
do not.</p>
<p>The fact that the principles of neo-Darwinist theory are, from a
certain perspective, self-evident has itself been used as a criticism of
the theory. For instance, if the theory must be true, how can it be
testable? One reply, often attributed to Haldane, is that the whole
theory would be refuted by the discovery of a single fossilized rabbit
in a stratum of Cambrian rock. However, that is misleading. The import
of such an observation would depend on what explanations were available
under the given circumstances. For instance, misidentifications of
fossils, and of strata, have sometimes been made and would have to be
ruled out by good explanations before one could call the discovery ‘a
fossilized rabbit in Cambrian rock’.</p>
<p>Even given such explanations, what would have been ruled out by the
rabbit would be not the theory of evolution itself, but only the
prevailing theory of the history of life and geological processes on
Earth. Suppose, for instance, that there was a prehistoric continent,
isolated from the others, on which evolution happened several times as
fast as elsewhere, and that, by convergent evolution, a rabbit-like
creature evolved there during the Cambrian era; and suppose that the
continents were later connected by a catastrophe that obliterated most
of the life forms on that continent and submerged their fossils. The
rabbit-like creature was a rare survivor which became extinct soon
afterwards. Given the supposed evidence, that is still an infinitely
better explanation than, for instance, creationism or Lamarckism,
neither of which gives any account of the origin of the apparent
knowledge in the rabbit.</p>
<p>So what would refute the Darwinian theory of evolution? Evidence
which, in the light of the best available explanation, implies that
knowledge came into existence in a different way. For instance, if an
organism was observed to undergo only (or mainly) favourable mutations,
as predicted by Lamarckism or spontaneous generation, then Darwinism’s
‘random variation’ postulate would be refuted. If organisms were
observed to be born with new, complex adaptations – for anything – of
which there were no precursors in their parents, then the gradual-change
prediction would be refuted and so would Darwinism’s mechanism of
knowledge-creation. If an organism was born with a complex adaptation
that has survival value today, yet was not favoured by selection
pressure in its ancestry (say, an ability to detect and use internet
weather forecasts to decide when to hibernate), then Darwinism would
again be refuted. A fundamentally new explanation would be needed.
Facing more or less the same unsolved problem that Paley and Darwin
faced, we should have to set about finding an explanation that
worked.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning</p>
<p>The physicist Brandon Carter calculated in 1974 that if the strength
of the interaction between charged particles were a few per cent
smaller, no planets would ever have formed and the only condensed
objects in the universe would be stars; and if it were a few per cent
greater, then no stars would ever explode, and so no elements other than
hydrogen and helium would exist outside them. In either case there would
be no complex chemistry and hence presumably no life.</p>
<p>Another example: if the initial expansion rate of the universe at the
Big Bang had been slightly higher, no stars would have formed and there
would be nothing in the universe but hydrogen – at an extremely low and
ever-decreasing density. If it had been slightly lower, the universe
would have recollapsed soon after the Big Bang. Similar results have
been since obtained for other constants of physics that are not
determined by any known theory. For most, if not all of them, it seems
that if they had been slightly different, there would have been no
possibility for life to exist.</p>
<p>This is a remarkable fact which has even been cited as evidence that
those constants were intentionally fine-tuned, i.e. designed, by a
supernatural being. This is a new version of creationism, and of the
design argument, now based on the appearance of design in the laws of
physics. (Ironically, given the history of this controversy, the new
argument is that the laws of physics must have been designed to create a
biosphere by Darwinian evolution.) It even persuaded the philosopher
Antony Flew – formerly an enthusiastic advocate of atheism – of the
existence of a supernatural designer. But it should not have. As I shall
explain in a moment, it is not even clear that this fine-tuning
constitutes an appearance of design in Paley’s sense; but, even if it
does, that does not alter the fact that invoking the supernatural makes
for a bad explanation. And, in any case, arguing for supernatural
explanations on the grounds that a current scientific explanation is
flawed or lacking is just a mistake. As we carved in stone in Chapter 3,
problems are inevitable – there are always unsolved problems. But they
get solved. Science continues to make progress even, or especially,
after making great discoveries, because the discoveries themselves
reveal further problems. Therefore the existence of an unsolved problem
in physics is no more evidence for a supernatural explanation than the
existence of an unsolved crime is evidence that a ghost committed
it.</p>
<p>A simple objection to the idea that fine-tuning requires an
explanation at all is that we have no good explanation implying that
planets are essential to the formation of life, or that chemistry is.
The physicist Robert Forward wrote a superb science-fiction story,
Dragon’s Egg, based on the premise that information could be stored and
processed – and life and intelligence could evolve – through the
interactions between neutrons on the surface of a neutron star (a star
that has collapsed gravitationally to a diameter of only a few
kilometres, making it so dense that most of its matter has been
transmuted into neutrons). It is not known whether this hypothetical
neutron analogue of chemistry exists – nor whether it could exist if the
laws of physics were slightly different. Nor do we have any idea what
other sorts of environment permitting the emergence of life would exist
under those variant laws. (The idea that similar laws of physics can be
expected to give rise to similar environments is undermined by the very
existence of fine-tuning.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, regardless of whether the fine-tuning constitutes an
appearance of design or not, it does constitute a legitimate and
significant scientific problem, for the following reason. If the truth
is that the constants of nature are not fine-tuned to produce life after
all, because most slight variations in them do still permit life and
intelligence to evolve somehow, though in dramatically different types
of environment, then this would be an unexplained regularity in nature
and hence a problem for science to address.</p>
<p>If the laws of physics are fine-tuned, as they seem to be, then there
are two possibilities: either those laws are the only ones to be
instantiated in reality (as universes) or there are other regions of
reality – parallel universes* – with different laws. In the former case,
we must expect there to be an explanation of why the laws are as they
are. It would either refer to the existence of life or not. If it did,
that would take us back to Paley’s problem: it would mean that the laws
had the ‘appearance of design’ for creating life, but had not evolved.
Or the explanation would not refer to the existence of life, in which
case it would leave unexplained why, if the laws are as they are for
non-life-related reasons, they are fine-tuned to create life.</p>
<p>If there are many parallel universes, each with its own laws of
physics, most of which do not permit life, then the idea would be that
the observed fine-tuning is only a matter of parochial perspective. It
is only in the universes that contain astrophysicists that anyone ever
wonders why the constants seem fine-tuned. This type of explanation is
known as ‘anthropic reasoning’. It is said to follow from a principle
known as the ‘weak anthropic principle’, though really no principle is
required: it is just logic. (The qualifier ‘weak’ is there because
several other anthropic principles have been proposed, which are more
than just logic, but they need not concern us here.)</p>
<p>However, on closer examination, anthropic arguments never quite
finish the explanatory job. To see why, consider an argument due to the
physicist Dennis Sciama.</p>
<p>Imagine that, at some time in the future, theoreticians have
calculated, for one of those constants of physics, the range of its
values for which there would be a reasonable probability that
astrophysicists (of a suitable kind) would emerge. Say that range is
from 137 to 138. (No doubt the real values will not be whole numbers,
but let us keep it simple.) They also calculate that the highest
probability of astrophysicists occurs at the midpoint of the range –
when the constant is 137.5.</p>
<p>Next, experimentalists set out to measure the value of that constant
directly – in laboratories, or by astronomical observation, say. What
should they predict? Curiously enough, one immediate prediction from the
anthropic explanation is that the value will not be exactly 137.5. For
suppose that it were. By analogy, imagine that the bull’s-eye of a
dartboard represents the values that can produce astrophysicists. It
would be a mistake to predict that a typical dart that strikes the
bull’s eye will strike it at the exact centre. Likewise, in the
overwhelming majority of universes in which the measurement could take
place (because they contain astrophysicists), the constant would not
take the exactly optimal value for producing astrophysicists, nor be
extremely close to it, compared with the size of the bull’s-eye.</p>
<p>So Sciama concludes that, if we did measure one of those constants of
physics, and found that it was extremely close to the optimum value for
producing astrophysicists, that would statistically refute, not
corroborate, the anthropic explanation for its value. Of course that
value might still be a coincidence, but if we were willing to accept
astronomically unlikely coincidences as explanations we should not be
puzzled by the fine-tuning in the first place – and we should tell Paley
that the watch on the heath might just have been formed by chance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, astrophysicists should be relatively unlikely in
universes whose conditions are so hostile that they barely permit
astrophysicists at all. So, if we imagine all the values consistent with
the emergence of astrophysicists arrayed on a line, then the anthropic
explanation leads us to expect the measured value to fall at some
typical point, not too close to the middle or to either end.</p>
<p>However – and here we are reaching Sciama’s main conclusion – that
prediction changes radically if there are several constants to explain.
For although any one constant is unlikely to be near the edge of its
range, the more constants there are, the more likely it is that at least
one of them will be. This can be illustrated pictorially as follows,
with our bull’s-eye replaced by a line segment, a square, a cube . . .
and we can imagine this sequence continuing for as many dimensions as
there are fine-tuned constants in nature. Arbitrarily define ‘near the
edge’ as meaning ‘within 10 per cent of the whole range from it’. Then
in the case of one constant, as shown in the diagram, 20 per cent of its
possible values are near one of the two edges of the range, and 80 per
cent are ‘away from the edge’. But with two constants a pair of values
has to satisfy two constraints in order to be ‘away from the edge’. Only
64 per cent of them do so. Hence 36 per cent are near the edge. With
three constants, nearly half the possible choices are near the edge.
With 100 constants, over 99.9999999 per cent of them are.</p>
<p>Whatever anthropic reasoning predicts about the values of multiple
constants, it predicts will only just happen.</p>
<p>So, the more constants are involved, the closer to having no
astrophysicists a typical universe-with-astrophysicists is. It is not
known how many constants are involved, but it seems to be several, in
which case the overwhelming majority of universes in the anthropically
selected region would be close to its edge. Hence, Sciama concluded, the
anthropic explanation predicts that the universe is only just capable of
producing astrophysicists – almost the opposite prediction from the one
that it makes in the case of one constant.</p>
<p>On the face of it, this might in turn seem to explain another great
unsolved scientific mystery, known as ‘Fermi’s problem’, named after the
physicist Enrico Fermi, who is said to have asked, ‘Where are they?’
Where are the extraterrestrial civilizations? Given the Principle of
Mediocrity, or even just what we know of the galaxy and the universe,
there is no reason to believe that the phenomenon of astrophysicists is
unique to our planet. Similar conditions presumably exist in many other
solar systems, so why would some of them not produce similar outcomes?
Moreover, given the timescales on which stars and galaxies develop, it
is overwhelmingly unlikely that any given extraterrestrial civilization
is currently at a similar state of technological development to ours: it
is likely to be millions of years younger (i.e. non-existent) or older.
The older civilizations have had plenty of time to explore the galaxy –
or at least to send robot space probes or signals. Fermi’s problem is
that we do not see any such civilizations, probes or signals.</p>
<p>Many candidate explanations have been proposed, and none of them, so
far, are very good. The anthropic explanation of fine-tuning, in the
light of Sciama’s argument, might seem to solve the problem neatly: if
the constants of physics in our universe are only just capable of
producing astrophysicists, then it is not surprising that this event has
happened only once, since its happening twice independently in the same
universe would be vanishingly unlikely.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that turns out to be a bad explanation too, because
focusing on fundamental constants is parochial: there is no relevant
difference between (1) ‘the same’ laws of physics with different
constants and (2) different laws of physics. And there are infinitely
many logically possible laws of physics. If they were all instantiated
in real universes – as has been suggested by some cosmologists, such as
Max Tegmark – it would be statistically certain that our universe is
exactly on the edge of the astrophysicist-producing class of
universes.</p>
<p>We know that that cannot be so from an argument due to Feynman (which
he applied to a slightly different problem). Consider the class of all
possible universes that contain astrophysicists, and consider what else
most of them contain. In particular, consider a sphere just large enough
to contain your own brain. If you are interested in explaining
fine-tuning, your brain in its current state counts as an
‘astrophysicist’ for these purposes. In the class of all universes that
contain astrophysicists, there are many that contain a sphere whose
interior is perfectly identical to the interior of your sphere,
including every detail of your brain. But in the vast majority of those
universes there is chaos outside the sphere: almost a random state,
since almost-random states are by far the most numerous. A typical such
state is not only amorphous but hot. So in most such universes the very
next thing that is going to happen is that the chaotic radiation
emanating from outside the sphere will kill you instantly. At any given
instant, the theory that we are going to be killed a picosecond hence is
refuted by observation a picosecond later. Whereupon another such theory
presents itself. So it is a very bad explanation – an extreme version of
the gambler’s hunches.</p>
<p>The same holds for purely anthropic explanations of all other
fine-tunings involving more than a handful of constants: such
explanations predict that it is overwhelmingly likely that we are in a
universe in which astrophysicists are only just possible and will cease
to exist in an instant. So they are bad explanations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the laws of physics exist in only one form,
with only the values of a few constants differing from one universe to
another, then the very fact that laws with different forms are not
instantiated is a piece of fine-tuning that that anthropic explanation
leaves unexplained.</p>
<p>The theory that all logically possible laws of physics are
instantiated as universes has a further severe problem as an
explanation. As I shall explain in Chapter 8, when considering infinite
sets such as these, there is often no objective way to ‘count’ or
‘measure’ how many of them have one attribute rather than another. On
the other hand, in the class of all logically possible entities, those
that can understand themselves, as the physical reality that we are in
does, are surely, in any reasonable sense, a tiny minority. The idea
that one of them ‘just happened’, without explanation, is surely just a
spontaneous-generation theory.</p>
<p>In addition, almost all the ‘universes’ described by those logically
possible laws of physics are radically different from ours – so
different that they do not properly fit into the argument. For instance,
infinitely many of them contain nothing other than one bison, in various
poses, and last for exactly 42 seconds. Infinitely many others contain a
bison and an astrophysicist. But what is an astrophysicist in a universe
that contains no stars, no scientific instruments and almost no
evidence? What is a scientist, or any sort of thinking person, in a
universe in which only bad explanations are true?</p>
<p>Almost all logically possible universes that contain astrophysicists
are governed by laws of physics that are bad explanations. So should we
predict that our universe, too, is inexplicable? Or has some high but
unknowable probability to be? Thus, again, anthropic arguments based on
‘all possible laws’ are ruled out for being bad explanations.</p>
<p>For these reasons I conclude that, while anthropic reasoning may well
be part of the explanation for apparent fine-tuning and other
observations, it can never be the whole explanation for why we observe
something that would otherwise look too purposeful to be explicable as
coincidence. Specific explanation, in terms of specific laws of nature,
is needed.</p>
<p>The reader may have noticed that all the bad explanations that I have
discussed in this chapter are ultimately connected with each other.
Expect too much from anthropic reasoning, or wonder too carefully how
Lamarckism could work, and you get to spontaneous generation. Take
spontaneous generation too seriously, and you get to creationism – and
so on. That is because they all address the same underlying problem, and
are all easily variable. They are easily interchangeable with each other
or with variants of themselves, and they are ‘too easy’ as explanations:
they could equally well explain anything. But neo-Darwinism was not easy
to come by, and it is not easy to tweak. Try to tweak it – even as far
as Darwin’s own misconceptions – and you will get an explanation that
doesn’t work nearly as well. Try to account for something non-Darwinian
with it – such as a new, complex adaptation of which there were no
precursors in the organism’s parents – and you will not be able to think
of a variant with that feature.</p>
<p>Anthropic explanations are attempting to account for purposeful
structure (such as the fine-tuned constants) in terms of a single act of
selection. That is unlike evolution, and it cannot work. The solution of
the fine-tuning puzzle is going to be in terms of an explanation that
will specifically explain what we observe. It will be, as Wheeler put
it, ‘an idea so simple . . . that . . . we will all say to each other,
how could it have been otherwise?’ In other words, the problem has been
not that the world is so complex that we cannot understand why it looks
as it does, but it is that it is so simple that we cannot yet understand
it. But this will be noticeable only with hindsight.</p>
<p>All those bad explanations of the biosphere either fail to address
the problem of how the knowledge in adaptations is created or they
explain it badly. That is to say, they all underrate creation – and,
ironically, the theory that underrates creation most of all is
creationism. Consider this: if a supernatural creator were to have
created the universe at the moment when Einstein or Darwin or any great
scientist (appeared to have) just completed their major discovery, then
the true creator of that discovery (and of all earlier discoveries)
would have been not that scientist but the supernatural being. So such a
theory would deny the existence of the only creation that really did
take place in the genesis of that scientist’s discoveries.</p>
<p>And it really is creation. Before a discovery is made, no predictive
process could reveal the content or the consequences of that discovery.
For if it could, it would be that discovery. So scientific discovery is
profoundly unpredictable, despite the fact that it is determined by the
laws of physics. I shall say more about this curious fact in the next
chapter; in short, it is due to the existence of ‘emergent’ levels of
explanation. In this case, the upshot is that what science – and
creative thought in general – achieves is unpredictable creation ex
nihilo. So does biological evolution. No other process does.</p>
<p>Creationism, therefore, is misleadingly named. It is not a theory
explaining knowledge as being due to creation, but the opposite: it is
denying that creation happened in reality, by placing the origin of the
knowledge in an explanationless realm. Creationism is really creation
denial – and so are all those other false explanations.</p>
<p>The puzzle of understanding what living things are and how they came
about has given rise to a strange history of misconceptions, near-misses
and ironies. The last of the ironies is that the neo-Darwinian theory,
like the Popperian theory of knowledge, really does describe creation,
while their rivals, beginning with creationism, never could.</p>

<p>MEANINGS OF ‘THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY’ ENCOUNTERED IN THIS
CHAPTER</p>
<p>– Evolution.</p>
<p>– More generally, the creation of knowledge.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>The evolution of biological adaptations and the creation of human
knowledge share deep similarities, but also some important differences.
The main similarities: genes and ideas are both replicators; knowledge
and adaptations are both hard to vary. The main difference: human
knowledge can be explanatory and can have great reach; adaptations are
never explanatory and rarely have much reach beyond the situations in
which they evolved. False explanations of biological evolution have
counterparts in false explanations of the growth of human knowledge. For
instance, Lamarckism is the counterpart of inductivism. William Paley’s
version of the argument from design clarified what does or does not have
the ‘appearance of design’ and hence what cannot be explained as the
outcome of chance alone – namely hard-to-vary adaptation to a purpose.
The origin of this must be the creation of knowledge. Biological
evolution does not optimize benefits to the species, the group, the
individual or even the gene, but only the ability of the gene to spread
through the population. Such benefits can nevertheless happen because of
the universality of laws of nature and the reach of some of the
knowledge that is created. The ‘fine-tuning’ of the laws or constants of
physics has been used as a modern form of the argument from design. For
the usual reasons, it is not a good argument for a supernatural cause.
But ‘anthropic’ theories that try to account for it as a pure selection
effect from an infinite number of different universes are, by
themselves, bad explanations too – in part because most logically
possible laws are themselves bad explanations.</p>
