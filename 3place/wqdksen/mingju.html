signals reaching our brains from our sense organs. Far from providing
direct or untainted access to reality, even they themselves are never
experienced for what they really are – namely crackles of electrical
activity. Nor, for the most part, do we experience them as being where
they really are – inside our brains. Instead, we place them in the
reality beyond. We do not just see blue: we see a blue sky up there, far
away. We do not just feel pain: we experience a headache, or a stomach
ache. The brain attaches those interpretations – ‘head’, ‘stomach’ and
‘up there’ – to events that are in fact within the brain itself. Our
sense organs themselves, and all the interpretations that we consciously
and unconsciously attach to their outputs, are notoriously fallible – as
witness the celestial-sphere theory, as well as every optical illusion
and conjuring trick. So we perceive nothing as what it really is. It is
all theoretical interpretation: conjecture.</p></li>

<li><p>The same controversy exists today in regard to illegal
immigrants, who also count as part of the population for apportionment
purposes. So states with large numbers of illegal immigrants receive
extra seats in Congress, while other states correspondingly lose
out.</p></li>
<li><p>The National Academy of Sciences panel that reported to Congress
in 1948 included the mathematician and physicist John von Neumann. It
decided that a rule invented by the statistician Joseph Adna Hill (which
is the one in use today) is the most impartial between states. But the
mathematicians Michel Balinski and Peyton Young have since concluded
that it favours smaller states. This illustrates again that different
criteria of ‘impartiality’ favour different apportionment rules, and
which of them is the right criterion cannot be determined by
mathematics. Indeed, if Representative Mills intended his complaint
ironically – if he really meant that mathematics alone could not
possibly be causing injustice and that mathematics alone could not cure
it – then he was right.</p></li>
<li><p>Though it never received more than 12.8 per cent of the vote, and
usually much less, the country’s proportional-representation system gave
it power that was insensitive to changes in the voters’ opinions. On
several occasions it chose which of the two largest parties would
govern, twice changing sides and three times choosing to put the less
popular of the two (as measured by votes) into power. The FDP’s leader
was usually made a cabinet minister as part of the coalition deal, with
the result that for the last twenty-nine years of that period Germany
had only two weeks without an FDP foreign minister. In 1998, when the
FDP was pushed into fourth place by the Green Party, it was immediately
ousted from government, and the Greens assumed the mantle of kingmakers.
And they took charge of the Foreign Ministry as well. This
disproportionate power that proportional representation gives the
third-largest party is an embarrassing feature of a system whose whole
raison d’être, and supposed moral justification, is to allocate
political influence proportionately.</p></li>

<li><p>they could dispense with the variant laws of physics too. Recall
from Chapter 6 that all the mathematical functions that occur in physics
belong to a relatively narrow class, the analytic functions. They have a
remarkable property: if an analytic function is non-zero at even one
point, then over its entire range it can pass through zero only at
isolated points. So this must be true of ‘the probability that an
astrophysicist exists’ expressed as a function of the constants of
physics. We know little about this function, but we do know that it is
non-zero for at least one set of values of the constants, namely ours.
Hence we also know that it is non-zero for almost any values. It is
presumably unimaginably tiny for almost all sets of values – but,
nevertheless, non-zero. And hence, almost whatever the constants were,
there would be infinitely many astrophysicists in our single
universe.</p></li>

question with only two possible answers, one flattering, the other
frustrating, and neither very interesting?</p></li>
<li><p>In this dialogue, Socrates sometimes exaggerates the attributes

<li><p>The ancient Greeks were not very clear about where sensory

sensation of seeing an object consists of some sort of interaction

Leibniz imagined.</p></li>
<li><p>That this information is carried entirely locally in objects is
currently somewhat controversial. For a detailed technical discussion

<li><p>This rule is often misinterpreted as illustrating how slaves were
