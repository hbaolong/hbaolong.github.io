<h4 id="the-reality-of-abstractions">5 The Reality of Abstractions</h4>
<p>The fundamental theories of modern physics explain the world in
jarringly counter-intuitive ways. For example, most non-physicists
consider it self-evident that when you hold your arm out horizontally
you can feel the force of gravity pulling it downwards. But you cannot.
The existence of a force of gravity is, astonishingly, denied by
Einstein’s general theory of relativity, one of the two deepest theories
of physics. This says that the only force on your arm in that situation
is that which you yourself are exerting, upwards, to keep it constantly
accelerating away from the straightest possible path in a curved region
of spacetime. The reality described by our other deepest theory, quantum
theory, which I shall describe in Chapter 11, is even more
counter-intuitive. To understand explanations like those, physicists
have to learn to think about everyday events in new ways.</p>
<p>The guiding principle is, as always, to reject bad explanations in
favour of good ones. In regard to what is or is not real, this leads to
the requirement that, if an entity is referred to by our best
explanation in the relevant field, we must regard it as really existing.
And if, as with the force of gravity, our best explanation denies that
it exists, then we must stop assuming that it does.</p>
<p>Furthermore, everyday events are stupendously complex when expressed
in terms of fundamental physics. If you fill a kettle with water and
switch it on, all the supercomputers on Earth working for the age of the
universe could not solve the equations that predict what all those water
molecules will do – even if we could somehow determine their initial
state and that of all the outside influences on them, which is itself an
intractable task.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some of that complexity resolves itself into a
higher-level simplicity. For example, we can predict with some accuracy
how long the water will take to boil. To do so, we need know only a few
physical quantities that are quite easy to measure, such as its mass,
the power of the heating element, and so on. For greater accuracy we may
also need information about subtler properties, such as the number and
type of nucleation sites for bubbles. But those are still relatively
‘high-level’ phenomena, composed of intractably large numbers of
interacting atomic-level phenomena. Thus there is a class of high-level
phenomena – including the liquidity of water and the relationship
between containers, heating elements, boiling and bubbles – that can be
well explained in terms of each other alone, with no direct reference to
anything at the atomic level or below. In other words, the behaviour of
that whole class of high-level phenomena is quasi-autonomous – almost
self-contained. This resolution into explicability at a higher,
quasi-autonomous level is known as emergence.</p>
<p>Emergent phenomena are a tiny minority. We can predict when the water
will boil, and that bubbles will form when it does, but if you wanted to
predict where each bubble will go (or, to be precise, what the
probabilities of its various possible motions are – see Chapter 11), you
would be out of luck. Still less is it feasible to predict the countless
microscopically defined properties of the water, such as whether an odd
or an even number of its electrons will be affected by the heating
during a given period.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are uninterested in predicting or explaining most of
those properties, despite the fact that they are the overwhelming
majority. That is because none of them has any bearing on what we want
to do with the water – such as understand what it is made of, or make
tea. To make tea, we want the water to be boiling, but we do not care
what the pattern of bubbles was. We want its volume to be between a
certain minimum and maximum, but we do not care how many molecules that
is. We can make progress in achieving those purposes because we can
express them in terms of those quasi-autonomous emergent properties
about which we have good high-level explanations. Nor do we need most of
the microscopic details in order to understand the role of water in the
cosmic scheme of things, because nearly all of those details are
parochial.</p>
<p>The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing
but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most of the
details ignored. This has given rise to a widespread misconception about
emergence and explanation, known as reductionism: the doctrine that
science always explains and predicts things reductively, i.e. by
analysing them into components. Often it does, as when we use the fact
that inter-atomic forces obey the law of conservation of energy to make
and explain a high-level prediction that the kettle cannot boil water
without a power supply. But reductionism requires the relationship
between different levels of explanation always to be like that, and
often it is not. For example, as I wrote in The Fabric of Reality:</p>
<p>Consider one particular copper atom at the tip of the nose of the
statue of Sir Winston Churchill that stands in Parliament Square in
London. Let me try to explain why that copper atom is there. It is
because Churchill served as prime minister in the House of Commons
nearby; and because his ideas and leadership contributed to the Allied
victory in the Second World War; and because it is customary to honour
such people by putting up statues of them; and because bronze, a
traditional material for such statues, contains copper, and so on. Thus
we explain a low-level physical observation – the presence of a copper
atom at a particular location – through extremely high-level theories
about emergent phenomena such as ideas, leadership, war and
tradition.</p>
<p>There is no reason why there should exist, even in principle, any
lower-level explanation of the presence of that copper atom than the one
I have just given. Presumably a reductive ‘theory of everything’ would
in principle make a low-level prediction of the probability that such a
statue will exist, given the condition of (say) the solar system at some
earlier date. It would also in principle describe how the statue
probably got there. But such descriptions and predictions (wildly
infeasible, of course) would explain nothing. They would merely describe
the trajectory that each copper atom followed from the copper mine,
through the smelter and the sculptor’s studio and so on . . . In fact
such a prediction would have to refer to atoms all over the planet,
engaged in the complex motion we call the Second World War, among other
things. But even if you had the superhuman capacity to follow such
lengthy predictions of the copper atom’s being there, you would still
not be able to say ‘Ah yes, now I understand why they are there’. [You]
would have to inquire into what it was about that configuration of
atoms, and those trajectories, that gave them the propensity to deposit
a copper atom at this location. Pursuing that inquiry would be a
creative task, as discovering new explanations always is. You would have
to discover that certain atomic configurations support emergent
phenomena such as leadership and war, which are related to one another
by high-level explanatory theories. Only when you knew those theories
could you understand why that copper atom is where it is.</p>
<p>Even in physics, some of the most fundamental explanations, and the
predictions that they make, are not reductive. For instance, the second
law of thermodynamics says that high-level physical processes tend
towards ever greater disorder. A scrambled egg never becomes unscrambled
by the whisk, and never extracts energy from the pan to propel itself
upwards into the shell, which never seamlessly reseals itself. Yet, if
you could somehow make a video of the scrambling process with enough
resolution to see the individual molecules, and play it backwards, and
examine any part of it at that scale, you would see nothing but
molecules moving and colliding in strict obedience to the low-level laws
of physics. It is not yet known how, or whether, the second law of
thermodynamics can be derived from a simple statement about individual
atoms.</p>
<p>There is no reason why it should be. There is often a moral overtone
to reductionism (science should be essentially reductive). This is
related both to instrumentalism and to the Principle of Mediocrity,
which I criticized in Chapters 1 and 3. Instrumentalism is rather like
reductionism except that, instead of rejecting only high-level
explanations, it tries to reject all explanations. The Principle of
Mediocrity is a milder form of reductionism: it rejects only high-level
explanations that involve people. While I am on the subject of bad
philosophical doctrines with moral overtones, let me add holism, a sort
of mirror image of reductionism. It is the idea that the only valid
explanations (or at least the only significant ones) are of parts in
terms of wholes. Holists also often share with reductionists the
mistaken belief that science can only (or should only) be reductive, and
therefore they oppose much of science. All those doctrines are
irrational for the same reason: they advocate accepting or rejecting
theories on grounds other than whether they are good explanations.</p>
<p>Whenever a high-level explanation does follow logically from
low-level ones, that also means that the high-level one implies
something about the low-level ones. Thus, additional high-level
theories, provided that they were all consistent, would place more and
more constraints on what the low-level theories could be. So it could be
that all the high-level explanations that exist, taken together, imply
all the low-level ones, as well as vice versa. Or it could be that some
low-level, some intermediate-level and some high-level explanations,
taken together, imply all explanations. I guess that that is so.</p>
<p>Thus, one possible way that the fine-tuning problem might eventually
be solved would be if some high-level explanations turned out to be
exact laws of nature. The microscopic consequences of that might well
seem to be fine-tuned. One candidate is the principle of the
universality of computation, which I shall discuss in the next chapter.
Another is the principle of testability, for, in a world in which the
laws of physics do not permit the existence of testers, they also forbid
themselves to be tested. However, in their current form such principles,
regarded as laws of physics, are anthropocentric and arbitrary – and
would therefore be bad explanations. But perhaps there are deeper
versions, to which they are approximations, which are good explanations,
well integrated with those of microscopic physics like the second law of
thermodynamics is.</p>
<p>In any case, emergent phenomena are essential to the explicability of
the world. Long before humans had much explanatory knowledge, they were
able to control nature by using rules of thumb. Rules of thumb have
explanations, and those explanations were about high-level regularities
among emergent phenomena such as fire and rocks. Long before that, it
was only genes that were encoding rules of thumb, and the knowledge in
them, too, was about emergent phenomena. Thus emergence is another
beginning of infinity: all knowledge-creation depends on, and physically
consists of, emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>Emergence is also responsible for the fact that discoveries can be
made in successive steps, thus providing scope for the scientific
method. The partial success of each theory in a sequence of improving
theories is tantamount to the existence of a ‘layer’ of phenomena that
each theory explains successfully – though, as it then turns out, partly
mistakenly.</p>
<p>Successive scientific explanations are occasionally dissimilar in the
way they explain their predictions, even in the domain where the
predictions themselves are similar or identical. For instance,
Einstein’s explanation of planetary motion does not merely correct
Newton’s: it is radically different, denying, among many other things,
the very existence of central elements of Newton’s explanation, such as
the gravitational force and the uniformly flowing time with respect to
which Newton defined motion. Likewise the astronomer Johannes Kepler’s
theory which said that the planets move in ellipses did not merely
correct the celestial-sphere theory, it denied the spheres’ existence.
And Newton’s did not substitute a new shape for Kepler’s ellipses, but a
whole new way for laws to specify motion – through infinitesimally
defined quantities like instantaneous velocity and acceleration. Thus
each of those theories of planetary motion was ignoring or denying its
predecessor’s basic means of explaining what was happening out
there.</p>
<p>This has been used as an argument for instrumentalism, as follows.
Each successive theory made small but accurate corrections to what its
predecessor predicted, and was therefore a better theory in that sense.
But, since each theory’s explanation swept away that of the previous
theory, the previous theory’s explanation was never true in the first
place, and so one cannot regard those successive explanations as
constituting a growth of knowledge about reality. From Kepler to Newton
to Einstein we have successively: no force needed to explain orbits; an
inverse-square-law force responsible for every orbit; and again no force
needed. So how could Newton’s ‘force of gravity’ (as distinct from his
equations predicting its effects) ever have been an advance in human
knowledge?</p>
<p>It could, and was, because sweeping away the entities through which a
theory makes its explanation is not the same as sweeping away the whole
of the explanation. Although there is no force of gravity, it is true
that something real (the curvature of spacetime), caused by the sun, has
a strength that varies approximately according to Newton’s
inverse-square law, and affects the motion of objects, seen and unseen.
Newton’s theory also correctly explained that the laws of gravitation
are the same for terrestrial and celestial objects; it made a novel
distinction between mass (the measure of an object’s resistance to being
accelerated) and weight (the force required to prevent the object from
falling under gravity); and it said that the gravitational effect of an
object depends on its mass and not on other attributes such as its
density or composition. Later, Einstein’s theory not only endorsed all
those features but explained, in turn, why they are so. Newton’s theory,
too, had been able to make more accurate predictions than its
predecessors precisely because it was more right than they were about
what was really happening. Before that, even Kepler’s explanation had
included important elements of the true explanation: planetary orbits
are indeed determined by laws of nature; those laws are indeed the same
for all planets, including the Earth; they do involve the sun; they are
mathematical and geometrical in character; and so on. With the hindsight
provided by each successive theory, we can see not only where the
previous theory made false predictions, but also that wherever it made
true predictions this was because it had expressed some truth about
reality. So its truth lives on in the new theory – as Einstein remarked,
‘There could be no fairer destiny for any physical theory than that it
should point the way to a more comprehensive theory in which it lives on
as a limiting case.’</p>
<p>As I explained in Chapter 1, regarding the explanatory function of
theories as paramount is not just an idle preference. The predictive
function of science is entirely dependent on it. Also, in order to make
progress in any field, it is the explanations in existing theories, not
the predictions, that have to be creatively varied in order to
conjecture the next theory. Furthermore, the explanations in one field
affect our understanding of other fields. For instance, if someone
thinks that a conjuring trick is due to supernatural abilities of the
conjurer, it will affect how they judge theories in cosmology (such as
the origin of the universe, or the fine-tuning problem) and in
psychology (how the human mind works) and so on.</p>
<p>By the way, it is something of a misconception that the predictions
of successive theories of planetary motion were all that similar.
Newton’s predictions are indeed excellent in the context of
bridge-building, and only slightly inadequate when running the Global
Positioning System, but they are hopelessly wrong when explaining a
pulsar or a quasar – or the universe as a whole. To get all those right,
one needs Einstein’s radically different explanations.</p>
<p>Such large discontinuities in the meanings of successive scientific
theories have no biological analogue: in an evolving species, the
dominant strain in each generation differs only slightly from that in
the previous generation. Nevertheless, scientific discovery is a gradual
process too; it is just that, in science, all the gradualness, and
nearly all the criticism and rejection of bad explanations, takes place
inside the scientists’ minds. As Popper put it, ‘We can let our theories
die in our place.’</p>
<p>There is another, even more important, advantage in that ability to
criticize theories without staking one’s life on them. In an evolving
species, the adaptations of the organisms in each generation must have
enough functionality to keep the organism alive, and to pass all the
tests that they encounter in propagating themselves to the next
generation. In contrast, the intermediate explanations leading a
scientist from one good explanation to the next need not be viable at
all. The same is true of creative thought in general. This is the
fundamental reason that explanatory ideas are able to escape from
parochialism, while biological evolution, and rules of thumb,
cannot.</p>
<p>That brings me to the main subject of this chapter: abstractions. In
Chapter 4 I remarked that pieces of knowledge are abstract replicators
that ‘use’ (and hence affect) organisms and brains to get themselves
replicated. That is a higher level of explanation than the emergent
levels I have mentioned so far. It is a claim that something abstract –
something non-physical, such as the knowledge in a gene or a theory – is
affecting something physical. Physically, nothing is happening in such a
situation other than that one set of emergent entities – such as genes,
or computers – is affecting others, which is already anathema to
reductionism. But abstractions are essential to a fuller explanation.
You know that if your computer beats you at chess, it is really the
program that has beaten you, not the silicon atoms or the computer as
such. The abstract program is instantiated physically as a high-level
behaviour of vast numbers of atoms, but the explanation of why it has
beaten you cannot be expressed without also referring to the program in
its own right. That program has also been instantiated, unchanged, in a
long chain of different physical substrates, including neurons in the
brains of the programmers and radio waves when you downloaded the
program via wireless networking, and finally as states of long- and
short-term memory banks in your computer. The specifics of that chain of
instantiations may be relevant to explaining how the program reached
you, but it is irrelevant to why it beat you: there, the content of the
knowledge (in it, and in you) is the whole story. That story is an
explanation that refers ineluctably to abstractions; and therefore those
abstractions exist, and really do affect physical objects in the way
required by the explanation.</p>
<p>The computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter has a nice argument that
this sort of explanation is essential in understanding certain
phenomena. In his book I am a Strange Loop (2007) he imagines a
special-purpose computer built of millions of dominoes. They are set up
– as dominoes often are for fun – standing on end, close together, so
that if one of them is knocked over it strikes its neighbour and so a
whole stretch of dominoes falls, one after another. But Hofstadter’s
dominoes are spring-loaded in such a way that, whenever one is knocked
over, it pops back up after a fixed time. Hence, when a domino falls, a
wave or ‘signal’ of falling dominoes propagates along the stretch in the
direction in which it fell until it reaches either a dead end or a
currently fallen domino. By arranging these dominoes in a network with
looping, bifurcating and rejoining stretches, one can make these signals
combine and interact in a sufficiently rich repertoire of ways to make
the whole construction into a computer: a signal travelling down a
stretch can be interpreted as a binary ‘1’, and the lack of a signal as
a binary ‘0’, and the interactions between such signals can implement a
repertoire of operations – such as ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘not’ – out of which
arbitrary computations can be composed.</p>
<p>One domino is designated as the ‘on switch’: when it is knocked over,
the domino computer begins to execute the program that is instantiated
in its loops and stretches. The program in Hofstadter’s thought
experiment computes whether a given number is a prime or not. One inputs
that number by placing a stretch of exactly that many dominos at a
specified position, before tripping the ‘on switch’. Elsewhere in the
network, a particular domino will deliver the output of the computation:
it will fall only if a divisor is found, indicating that the input was
not a prime.</p>
<p>Hofstadter sets the input to the number 641, which is a prime, and
trips the ‘on switch’. Flurries of motion begin to sweep back and forth
across the network. All 641 of the input dominos soon fall as the
computation ‘reads’ its input – and snap back up and participate in
further intricate patterns. It is a lengthy process, because this is a
rather inefficient way to perform computations – but it does the
job.</p>
<p>Now Hofstadter imagines that an observer who does not know the
purpose of the domino network watches the dominoes performing and
notices that one particular domino remains resolutely standing, never
affected by any of the waves of downs and ups sweeping by.</p>
<p>The observer points at [that domino] and asks with curiosity, ‘How
come that domino there is never falling?’</p>
<p>We know that it is the output domino, but the observer does not.
Hofstadter continues:</p>
<p>Let me contrast two different types of answer that someone might
give. The first type of answer – myopic to the point of silliness –
would be, ‘Because its predecessor never falls, you dummy!’</p>
<p>Or, if it has two or more neighbours, ‘Because none of its neighbours
ever fall.’</p>
<p>To be sure, this is correct as far as it goes, but it doesn’t go very
far. It just passes the buck to a different domino.</p>
<p>In fact one could keep passing the buck from domino to domino, to
provide ever more detailed answers that were ‘silly, but correct as far
as they go’. Eventually, after one had passed the buck billions of times
(many more times than there are dominoes, because the program ‘loops’),
one would arrive at that first domino – the ‘on switch’.</p>
<p>At that point, the reductive (to high-level physics) explanation
would be, in summary, ‘That domino did not fall because none of the
patterns of motion initiated by knocking over the “on switch” ever
include it.’ But we knew that already. We can reach that conclusion – as
we just have – without going through that laborious process. And it is
undeniably true. But it is not the explanation we were looking for
because it is addressing a different question – predictive rather than
explanatory – namely, if the first domino falls, will the output domino
ever fall? And it is asking at the wrong level of emergence. What we
asked was: why does it not fall? To answer that, Hofstadter then adopts
a different mode of explanation, at the right level of emergence:</p>
<p>The second type of answer would be, ‘Because 641 is prime.’ Now this
answer, while just as correct (indeed, in some sense it is far more on
the mark), has the curious property of not talking about anything
physical at all. Not only has the focus moved upwards to collective
properties . . . these properties somehow transcend the physical and
have to do with pure abstractions, such as primality.</p>
<p>Hofstadter concludes, ‘The point of this example is that 641’s
primality is the best explanation, perhaps even the only explanation,
for why certain dominoes did fall and certain others did not fall.’</p>
<p>Just to correct that slightly: the physics-based explanation is true
as well, and the physics of the dominoes is also essential to explaining
why prime numbers are relevant to that particular arrangement of them.
But Hofstadter’s argument does show that primality must be part of any
full explanation of why the dominos did or did not fall. Hence it is a
refutation of reductionism in regard to abstractions. For the theory of
prime numbers is not part of physics. It refers not to physical objects,
but to abstract entities – such as numbers, of which there is an
infinite set.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hofstadter goes on to disown his own argument and to
embrace reductionism. Why?</p>
<p>His book is primarily about one particular emergent phenomenon, the
mind – or, as he puts it, the ‘I’. He asks whether the mind can
consistently be thought of as affecting the body – causing it to do one
thing rather than another, given the all-embracing nature of the laws of
physics. This is known as the mind–body problem. For instance, we often
explain our actions in terms of choosing one action rather than another,
but our bodies, including our brains, are completely controlled by the
laws of physics, leaving no physical variable free for an ‘I’ to affect
in order to make such a choice. Following the philosopher Daniel
Dennett, Hofstadter eventually concludes that the ‘I’ is an illusion.
Minds, he concludes, can’t ‘push material stuff around’, because
‘physical law alone would suffice to determine [its] behaviour’. Hence
his reductionism.</p>
<p>But, first of all, physical laws can’t push anything either. They
only explain and predict. And they are not our only explanations. The
theory that the domino stands ‘because 641 is a prime (and because the
domino network instantiates a primality-testing algorithm)’ is an
exceedingly good explanation. What is wrong with it? It does not
contradict the laws of physics. It explains more than any explanation
purely in terms of those laws. And no known variant of it can do the
same job.</p>
<p>Second, that reductionist argument would equally deny that an atom
can ‘push’ (in the sense of ‘cause to move’) another atom, since the
initial state of the universe, together with the laws of motion, has
already determined the state at every other time.</p>
<p>Third, the very idea of a cause is emergent and abstract. It is
mentioned nowhere in the laws of motion of elementary particles, and, as
the philosopher David Hume pointed out, we cannot perceive causation,
only a succession of events. Also, the laws of motion are ‘conservative’
– that is to say, they do not lose information. That means that, just as
they determine the final state of any motion given the initial state,
they also determine the initial state given the final state, and the
state at any time from the state at any other time. So, at that level of
explanation, cause and effect are interchangeable – and are not what we
mean when we say that a program causes a computer to win at chess, or
that a domino remained standing because 641 is a prime.</p>
<p>There is no inconsistency in having multiple explanations of the same
phenomenon, at different levels of emergence. Regarding microphysical
explanations as more fundamental than emergent ones is arbitrary and
fallacious. There is no escape from Hofstadter’s 641 argument, and no
reason to want one. The world may or may not be as we wish it to be, and
to reject good explanations on that account is to imprison oneself in
parochial error.</p>
<p>So the answer ‘Because 641 is a prime’ does explain the immunity of
that domino. The theory of prime numbers on which that answer depends is
not a law of physics, nor an approximation to one. It is about
abstractions, and infinite sets of them at that (such as the set of
‘natural numbers’ 1, 2, 3, . . ., where the ellipsis ‘ . . . ’ denotes
continuation ad infinitum). It is no mystery how we can have knowledge
of infinitely large things, like the set of all natural numbers. That is
just a matter of reach. Versions of number theory that confined
themselves to ‘small natural numbers’ would have to be so full of
arbitrary qualifiers, workarounds and unanswered questions that they
would be very bad explanations until they were generalized to the case
that makes sense without such ad-hoc restrictions: the infinite case. I
shall discuss various sorts of infinity in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>When we use theories about emergent physical quantities to explain
the behaviour of water in a kettle, we are using an abstraction – an
‘idealized’ model of the kettle that ignores most of its details – as an
approximation to a real physical system. But when we use a computer to
investigate prime numbers, we are doing the reverse: we are using the
physical computer as an approximation to an abstract one which perfectly
models prime numbers. Unlike any real computer, the latter never goes
wrong, requires no maintenance, and has unlimited memory and unlimited
time to run its program.</p>
<p>Our own brains are, likewise, computers which we can use to learn
about things beyond the physical world, including pure mathematical
abstractions. This ability to understand abstractions is an emergent
property of people which greatly puzzled the ancient Athenian
philosopher Plato. He noticed that the theorems of geometry – such as
Pythagoras’ theorem – are about entities that are never experienced:
perfectly straight lines with no thickness, intersecting each other on a
perfect plane to make a perfect triangle. These are not possible objects
of any observation. And yet people knew about them – and not just
superficially: at the time, such knowledge was the deepest knowledge, of
anything, that human beings had ever had. Where did it come from? Plato
concluded that it – and all human knowledge – must come from the
supernatural.</p>
<p>He was right that it could not have come from observation. But then
it could not have even if people had been able to observe perfect
triangles (as arguably they could today, using virtual reality). As I
explained in Chapter 1, empiricism has multiple fatal flaws. But it is
no mystery where our knowledge of abstractions comes from: it comes from
conjecture, like all our knowledge, and through criticism and seeking
good explanations. It is only empiricism that made it seem plausible
that knowledge outside science is inaccessible; and it is only the
justified-true-belief misconception that makes such knowledge seem less
‘justified’ than scientific theories.</p>
<p>As I explained in Chapter 1, even in science, almost all rejected
theories are rejected for being bad explanations, without ever being
tested. Experimental testing is only one of many methods of criticism
used in science, and the Enlightenment has made progress by bringing
those other methods to bear in non-scientific fields too. The basic
reason that such progress is possible is that good explanations about
philosophical issues are as hard to find as in science – and criticism
is correspondingly effective.</p>
<p>Moreover, experience does play a role in philosophy – only not the
role of experimental testing that it plays in science. Primarily, it
provides philosophical problems. There would have been no philosophy of
science if the issue of how we can acquire knowledge of the physical
world had been unproblematic. There would be no such thing as political
philosophy if there had not first been a problem of how to run
societies. (To avoid misunderstanding, let me stress that experience
provides problems only by bringing already-existing ideas into conflict.
It does not, of course, provide theories.)</p>
<p>In the case of moral philosophy, the empiricist and justificationist
misconceptions are often expressed in the maxim that ‘you can’t derive
an ought from an is’ (a paraphrase of a remark by the Enlightenment
philosopher David Hume). It means that moral theories cannot be deduced
from factual knowledge. This has become conventional wisdom, and has
resulted in a kind of dogmatic despair about morality: ‘you can’t derive
an ought from an is, therefore morality cannot be justified by reason’.
That leaves only two options: either to embrace unreason or to try
living without ever making a moral judgement. Both are liable to lead to
morally wrong choices, just as embracing unreason or never attempting to
explain the physical world leads to factually false theories (and not
just ignorance).</p>
<p>Certainly you can’t derive an ought from an is, but you can’t derive
a factual theory from an is either. That is not what science does. The
growth of knowledge does not consist of finding ways to justify one’s
beliefs. It consists of finding good explanations. And, although factual
evidence and moral maxims are logically independent, factual and moral
explanations are not. Thus factual knowledge can be useful in
criticizing moral explanations.</p>
<p>For example, in the nineteenth century, if an American slave had
written a bestselling book, that event would not logically have ruled
out the proposition ‘Negroes are intended by Providence to be slaves.’
No experience could, because that is a philosophical theory. But it
might have ruined the explanation through which many people understood
that proposition. And if, as a result, such people had found themselves
unable to explain to their own satisfaction why it would be Providential
if that author were to be forced back into slavery, then they might have
questioned the account that they had formerly accepted of what a black
person really is, and what a person in general is – and then a good
person, a good society, and so on.</p>
<p>Conversely, advocates of highly immoral doctrines almost invariably
believe associated factual falsehoods as well. For instance, ever since
the attack on the United States on 11 September 2001, millions of people
worldwide have believed it was carried out by the US government, or the
Israeli secret service. Those are purely factual misconceptions, yet
they bear the imprint of moral wrongness just as clearly as a fossil –
made of purely inorganic material – bears the imprint of ancient life.
And the link, in both cases, is explanation. To concoct a moral
explanation for why Westerners deserve to be killed indiscriminately,
one needs to explain factually that the West is not what it pretends to
be – and that requires uncritical acceptance of conspiracy theories,
denials of history, and so on.</p>
<p>Quite generally, in order to understand the moral landscape in terms
of a given set of values, one needs to understand some facts as being a
certain way too. And the converse is also true: for example, as the
philosopher Jacob Bronowski pointed out, success at making factual,
scientific discoveries entails a commitment to all sorts of values that
are necessary for making progress. The individual scientist has to value
truth, and good explanations, and be open to ideas and to change. The
scientific community, and to some extent the civilization as a whole,
has to value tolerance, integrity and openness of debate.</p>
<p>We should not be surprised at these connections. The truth has
structural unity as well as logical consistency, and I guess that no
true explanation is entirely disconnected from any other. Since the
universe is explicable, it must be that morally right values are
connected in this way with true factual theories, and morally wrong
values with false theories.</p>
<p>Moral philosophy is basically about the problem of what to do next –
and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world
to want. Some philosophers confine the term ‘moral’ to problems about
how one should treat other people. But such problems are continuous with
problems of individuals choosing what sort of life to lead, which is why
I adopt the more inclusive definition. Terminology aside, if you were
suddenly the last human on Earth, you would be wondering what sort of
life to want. Deciding ‘I should do whatever pleases me most’ would give
you very little clue, because what pleases you depends on your moral
judgement of what constitutes a good life, not vice versa.</p>
<p>This also illustrates the emptiness of reductionism in philosophy.
For if I ask you for advice about what objectives to pursue in life, it
is no good telling me to do what the laws of physics mandate. I shall do
that in any case. Nor is it any good telling me to do what I prefer,
because I don’t know what I prefer to do until I have decided what sort
of life I want to lead or how I should want the world to be. Since our
preferences are shaped in this way, at least in part, by our moral
explanations, it does not make sense to define right and wrong entirely
in terms of their utility in meeting people’s preferences. Trying to do
so is the project of the influential moral philosophy known as
utilitarianism, which played much the same role as empiricism did in the
philosophy of science: it acted as a liberating focus for the rebellion
against traditional dogmas, while its own positive content contained
little truth.</p>
<p>So there is no avoiding what-to-do-next problems, and, since the
distinction between right and wrong appears in our best explanations
that address such problems, we must regard that distinction as real. In
other words, there is an objective difference between right and wrong:
those are real attributes of objectives and behaviours. In Chapter 14 I
shall argue that the same is true in the field of aesthetics: there is
such a thing as objective beauty.</p>
<p>Beauty, right and wrong, primality, infinite sets – they all exist
objectively. But not physically. What does that mean? Certainly they can
affect you – as examples like Hofstadter’s show – but apparently not in
the same sense that physical objects do. You cannot trip over one of
them in the street. However, there is less to that distinction than our
empiricism-biased common sense assumes. First of all, being affected by
a physical object means that something about the physical object has
caused a change, via the laws of physics (or, equivalently, that the
laws of physics have caused a change via that object). But causation and
the laws of physics are not themselves physical objects. They are
abstractions, and our knowledge of them comes – just as for all other
abstractions – from the fact that our best explanations invoke them.
Progress depends on explanation, and therefore trying to conceive of the
world as merely a sequence of events with unexplained regularities would
entail giving up on progress.</p>
<p>This argument that abstractions really exist does not tell us what
they exist as – for instance, which of them are purely emergent aspects
of others, and which exist independently of the others. Would the laws
of morality still be the same if the laws of physics were different? If
they were such that knowledge could best be obtained by blind obedience
to authority, then scientists would have to avoid what we think of as
the values of scientific inquiry in order to make progress. My guess is
that morality is more autonomous than that, and so it makes sense to say
that such laws of physics would be immoral, and (as I remarked in
Chapter 4) to imagine laws of physics that would be more moral than the
real ones.</p>
<p>The reach of ideas into the world of abstractions is a property of
the knowledge that they contain, not of the brain in which they may
happen to be instantiated. A theory can have infinite reach even if the
person who originated it is unaware that it does. However, a person is
an abstraction too. And there is a kind of infinite reach that is unique
to people: the reach of the ability to understand explanations. And this
ability is itself an instance of the wider phenomenon of universality –
to which I turn next.</p>
<p>TERMINOLOGY</p>
<p>Levels of emergence Sets of phenomena that can be explained well in
terms of each other without analysing them into their constituent
entities such as atoms.</p>
<p>Natural numbers The whole numbers 1, 2, 3 and so on.</p>
<p>Reductionism The misconception that science must or should always
explain things by analysing them into components (and hence that
higher-level explanations cannot be fundamental).</p>
<p>Holism The misconception that all significant explanations are of
components in terms of wholes rather than vice versa.</p>
<p>Moral philosophy Addresses the problem of what sort of life to
want.</p>
<p>MEANINGS OF ‘THE BEGINNING OF INFINITY’ ENCOUNTERED IN THIS
CHAPTER</p>
<p>– The existence of emergent phenomena, and the fact that they can
encode knowledge about other emergent phenomena.</p>
<p>– The existence of levels of approximation to true explanations.</p>
<p>– The ability to understand explanations.</p>
<p>– The ability of explanation to escape from parochialism by ‘letting
our theories die in our place’.</p>
<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Reductionism and holism are both mistakes. In reality, explanations
do not form a hierarchy with the lowest level being the most
fundamental. Rather, explanations at any level of emergence can be
fundamental. Abstract entities are real, and can play a role in causing
physical phenomena. Causation is itself such an abstraction.</p>
