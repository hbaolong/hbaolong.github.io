<h4 id="unsustainable">17 Unsustainable</h4>
<p>Easter Island in the South Pacific is famous mainly – let’s face it,
only – for the large stone statues that were built there many centuries
ago by the islanders. The purpose of the statues is unknown, but is
thought to be connected with an ancestor-worshipping religion. The first
settlers may have arrived on the island as early as the fifth century
CE. They developed a complex Stone Age civilization, which suddenly
collapsed over a millennium later. By some accounts there was
starvation, war and perhaps cannibalism. The population fell to a small
fraction of what it had been, and their culture was lost.</p>
<p>The prevailing theory is that the Easter Islanders brought disaster
upon themselves, in part by chopping down the forest which had
originally covered most of the island. They eliminated the most useful
species of tree altogether. This is not a wise thing to do if you rely
on timber for shelter, or if fish form a large part of your diet and
your boats and nets are made of wood. And there were knock-on effects
such as soil erosion, precipitating the destruction of the environment
on which the islanders had depended.</p>
<p>Some archaeologists dispute this theory. For example, Terry Hunt has
concluded that the islanders arrived only in the thirteenth century, and
that their civilization continued to function throughout the
deforestation (which he attributes to rats, not tree-felling) until it
was destroyed by epidemics, caused by contact with Europeans. However, I
do not want to discuss whether the prevailing theory is accurate, but
only to use it as an example of a common fallacy – an argument by
analogy about issues far less parochial.</p>
<p>Easter Island is 2,000 kilometres from the nearest habitation, namely
Pitcairn Island (where the Bounty’s crew took refuge after their famous
mutiny). Both islands are far from anywhere, even by today’s standards.
Nevertheless, in 1972 Jacob Bronowski made his way to Easter Island to
film part of his magnificent television series The Ascent of Man. He and
his film crew travelled by ship all the way from California, a round
trip of some 14,000 kilometres. He was in poor health, and the crew had
literally to carry him to the location for filming. But he persevered
because those distinctive statues were the perfect setting for him to
deliver the central message of his series – which is also a theme of
this book – that our civilization is unique in history for its capacity
to make progress. He wanted to celebrate its values and achievements,
and to attribute the latter to the former, and to contrast our
civilization with the alternative as epitomized by ancient Easter
Island.</p>
<p>The Ascent of Man had been commissioned by the naturalist David
Attenborough, then controller of the British television channel BBC2. A
quarter of a century later Attenborough – who had by then become the
doyen of natural-history film-making – led another film crew to Easter
Island, to film another television series, The State of the Planet. He
too chose those grim-faced statues as a backdrop, for his closing scene.
Alas, his message was almost exactly the opposite of Bronowski’s.</p>
<p>The philosophical difference between these two great broadcasters –
so alike in their infectious sense of wonder, their clarity of
exposition, and their humanity – was immediately evident in their
different attitudes towards those statues. Attenborough called them
‘astonishing stone sculptures . . . vivid evidence of the technological
and artistic skills of the people who once lived here’. Now, I wonder
whether Attenborough was really all that impressed by the islanders’
skills, which had been exceeded millennia earlier in other Stone Age
societies. I expect he was being polite, for it is de rigueur in our
culture to heap praise upon any achievement of a primitive society. But
Bronowski refused to conform to that convention. He remarked, ‘People
often ask about Easter Island, How did men come here? They came here by
accident: that is not in question. The question is, Why could they not
get off?’ And why, he might have added, did others not follow to trade
with them (there was a great deal of trade among Polynesians other than
Easter Islanders), or to rob them, or to learn from them? Because they
did not know how.</p>
<p>As for the statues being ‘vivid evidence of . . . artistic skills’,
Bronowski was having none of that either. To him they were vivid
evidence of failure, not success:</p>
<p>The critical question about these statues is, Why were they all made
alike? You see them sitting there, like Diogenes in their barrels,
looking at the sky with empty eye-sockets, and watching the sun and the
stars go overhead without ever trying to understand them. When the Dutch
discovered this island on Easter Sunday in 1722, they said that it had
the makings of an earthly paradise. But it did not. An earthly paradise
is not made by this empty repetition . . . These frozen faces, these
frozen frames in a film that is running down, mark a civilization which
failed to take the first step on the ascent of rational knowledge.</p>
<p>The Ascent of Man (1973)</p>
<p>The statues were all made alike because Easter Island was a static
society. It never took that first step in the ascent of man – the
beginning of infinity.</p>
<p>Of the hundreds of statues on the island, built over the course of
several centuries, fewer than half are at their intended destinations.
The rest, including the largest, are in various stages of completion,
with as many as 10 per cent already in transit on specially built roads.
Again there are conflicting explanations, but, according to the
prevailing theory, it is because there was a large increase in the rate
of statue-building just before it stopped for ever. In other words, as
disaster loomed, the islanders diverted ever more effort not into
addressing the problem – for they did not know how to do that – but into
making ever more and bigger (but very rarely better) monuments to their
ancestors. And what were those roads made of? Trees.</p>
<p>When Bronowski made his documentary, there were as yet no detailed
theories of how the Easter Island civilization fell. But, unlike
Attenborough, he was not interested in that, because his whole purpose
in going to Easter Island was to point out the profound difference
between our civilization and civilizations like the one that built those
statues. We are not like them was his message. We have taken the step
that they did not. Attenborough’s argument rests on the opposite claim:
we are like them and are following headlong in their footsteps. And so
he drew an extended analogy between the Easter Island civilization and
ours, feature for feature, and danger for danger:</p>
<p>A warning of what the future could hold can be seen on one of the
remotest places on Earth . . . When the first Polynesian settlers landed
here they found a miniature world that had ample resources to sustain
them. They lived well . . .</p>
<p>The State of the Planet (BBC TV, 2000)</p>
<p>A miniature world: there, in three words, is Attenborough’s reason
for travelling all the way to Easter Island and telling its story. He
believed that it holds a warning for the world because Easter Island was
itself a miniature world – a Spaceship Earth – that went wrong. It had
‘ample resources’ to sustain its population, just as the Earth has
seemingly ample resources to sustain us. (Imagine how amazed Malthus
would have been had he known that the Earth’s resources would still be
called ‘ample’ by pessimists in the year 2000.) Its inhabitants ‘lived
well’, just as we do. And yet they were doomed, just as we are doomed
unless we change our ways. If we do not, here is ‘what the future could
hold’:</p>
<p>The old culture that had sustained them was abandoned and the statues
toppled. What had been a rich, fertile world in miniature had become a
barren desert.</p>
<p>Again, Attenborough puts in a good word for the old culture: it
‘sustained’ the islanders (just as the ample resources did, until the
islanders failed to use them sustainably). He uses the toppling of the
statues to symbolize the fall of that culture, as if to warn of future
disaster for ours, and he reiterates his world-in-miniature analogy
between the society and technology of ancient Easter Island and that of
our whole planet today.</p>
<p>Thus Attenborough’s Easter Island is a variant of Spaceship Earth:
humans are sustained jointly by the ‘rich, fertile’ biosphere and the
cultural knowledge of a static society. In this context, ‘sustain’ is an
interestingly ambiguous word. It can mean providing someone with what
they need. But it can also mean preventing things from changing – which
can be almost the opposite meaning, for the suppression of change is
seldom what human beings need.</p>
<p>The knowledge that currently sustains human life in Oxfordshire does
so only in the first sense: it does not make us enact the same,
traditional way of life in every generation. In fact it prevents us from
doing so. For comparison: if your way of life merely makes you build a
new, giant statue, you can continue to live afterwards exactly as you
did before. That is sustainable. But if your way of life leads you to
invent a more efficient method of farming, and to cure a disease that
has been killing many children, that is unsustainable. The population
grows because children who would have died survive; meanwhile, fewer of
them are needed to work in the fields. And so there is no way to
continue as before. You have to live the solution, and to set about
solving the new problems that this creates. It is because of this
unsustainability that the island of Britain, with a far less hospitable
climate than the subtropical Easter Island, now hosts a civilization
with at least three times the population density that Easter Island had
at its zenith, and at an enormously higher standard of living.
Appropriately enough, this civilization has knowledge of how to live
well without the forests that once covered much of Britain.</p>
<p>The Easter Islanders’ culture sustained them in both senses. This is
the hallmark of a functioning static society. It provided them with a
way of life; but it also inhibited change: it sustained their
determination to enact and re-enact the same behaviours for generations.
It sustained the values that placed forests – literally – beneath
statues. And it sustained the shapes of those statues, and the pointless
project of building ever more of them.</p>
<p>Moreover, the portion of the culture that sustained them in the sense
of providing for their needs was not especially impressive. Other Stone
Age societies have managed to take fish from the sea and sow crops
without wasting their efforts in endless monument-building. And, if the
prevailing theory is true, the Easter Islanders started to starve before
the fall of their civilization. In other words, even after it had
stopped providing for them, it retained its fatal proficiency at
sustaining a fixed pattern of behaviour. And so it remained effective at
preventing them from addressing the problem by the only means that could
possibly have been effective: creative thought and innovation.
Attenborough regards the culture as having been very valuable and its
fall as a tragedy. Bronowski’s view was closer to mine, which is that
since the culture never improved, its survival for many centuries was a
tragedy, like that of all static societies.</p>
<p>Attenborough is not alone in drawing frightening lessons from the
history of Easter Island. It has become a widely adduced version of the
Spaceship Earth metaphor. But what exactly is the analogy behind the
lesson? The idea that civilization depends on good forest management has
little reach. But the broader interpretation, that survival depends on
good resource management, has almost no content: any physical object can
be deemed a ‘resource’. And, since problems are soluble, all disasters
are caused by ‘poor resource management’. The ancient Roman ruler Julius
Caesar was stabbed to death, so one could summarize his mistake as
‘imprudent iron management, resulting in an excessive build-up of iron
in his body’. It is true that if he had succeeded in keeping iron away
from his body he would not have died in the (exact) way he did, yet, as
an explanation of how and why he died, that ludicrously misses the
point. The interesting question is not what he was stabbed with, but how
it came about that other politicians plotted to remove him violently
from office and that they succeeded. A Popperian analysis would focus on
the fact that Caesar had taken vigorous steps to ensure that he could
not be removed without violence. And then on the fact that his removal
did not rectify, but actually entrenched, this progress-suppressing
innovation. To understand such events and their wider significance, one
has to understand the politics of the situation, the psychology, the
philosophy, sometimes the theology. Not the cutlery. The Easter
Islanders may or may not have suffered a forest-management fiasco. But,
if they did, the explanation would not be about why they made mistakes –
problems are inevitable – but why they failed to correct them.</p>
<p>I have argued that the laws of nature cannot possibly impose any
bound on progress: by the argument of Chapters 1 and 3, denying this is
tantamount to invoking the supernatural. In other words, progress is
sustainable, indefinitely. But only by people who engage in a particular
kind of thinking and behaviour – the problem-solving and
problem-creating kind characteristic of the Enlightenment. And that
requires the optimism of a dynamic society.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of optimism is that one expects to learn from
failure – one’s own and others’. But the idea that our civilization has
something to learn from the Easter Islanders’ alleged forestry failure
is not derived from any structural resemblance between our situation and
theirs. For they failed to make progress in practically every area. No
one expects the Easter Islanders’ failures in, say, medicine to explain
our difficulties in curing cancer, or their failure to understand the
night sky to explain why a quantum theory of gravity is elusive to us.
The Easter Islanders’ errors, both methodological and substantive, were
simply too elementary to be relevant to us, and their imprudent
forestry, if that is really what destroyed their civilization, would
merely be typical of their lack of problem-solving ability across the
board. We should do much better to study their many small successes than
their entirely commonplace failures. If we could discover their rules of
thumb (such as ‘stone mulching’ to help grow crops on poor soil), we
might find valuable fragments of historical and ethnological knowledge,
or perhaps even something of practical use. But one cannot draw general
conclusions from rules of thumb. It would be astonishing if the details
of a primitive, static society’s collapse had any relevance to hidden
dangers that may be facing our open, dynamic and scientific society, let
alone what we should do about them.</p>
<p>The knowledge that would have saved the Easter Islanders’
civilization has already been in our possession for centuries. A sextant
would have allowed them to explore their ocean and bring back the seeds
of new forests and of new ideas. Greater wealth, and a written culture,
would have enabled them to recover after a devastating plague. But, most
of all, they would have been better at solving problems of all kinds if
they had known some of our ideas about how to do that, such as the
rudiments of a scientific outlook. Such knowledge would not have
guaranteed their welfare, any more than it guarantees ours.
Nevertheless, the fact that their civilization failed for lack of what
ours discovered long ago cannot be an ominous ‘warning of what the
future could hold’ for us.</p>
<p>This knowledge-based approach to explaining human events follows from
the general arguments of this book. We know that achieving arbitrary
physical transformations that are not forbidden by the laws of physics
(such as replanting a forest) can only be a matter of knowing how. We
know that finding out how is a matter of seeking good explanations. We
also know that whether a particular attempt to make progress will
succeed or not is profoundly unpredictable. It can be understood in
retrospect, but not in terms of factors that could have been known in
advance. Thus we now understand why alchemists never succeeded at
transmutation: because they would have had to understand some nuclear
physics first. But this could not have been known at the time. And the
progress that they did make – which led to the science of chemistry –
depended strongly on how individual alchemists thought, and only
peripherally on factors like which chemicals could be found nearby. The
conditions for a beginning of infinity exist in almost every human
habitation on Earth.</p>
<p>In his book Guns, Germs and Steel, the biogeographer Jared Diamond
takes the opposite view. He proposes what he calls an ‘ultimate
explanation’ of why human history was so different on different
continents. In particular, he seeks to explain why it was Europeans who
sailed out to conquer the Americas, Australasia and Africa and not vice
versa. In Diamond’s view, the psychology and philosophy and politics of
historical events are no more than ephemeral ripples on the great river
of history. Its course is set by factors independent of human ideas and
decisions. Specifically, he says, the continents on our planet had
different natural resources – different geographies, plants, animals and
micro-organisms – and, details aside, that is what explains the broad
sweep of history, including which human ideas were created and what
decisions were made, politics, philosophy, cutlery and all.</p>
<p>For example, part of his explanation of why the Americas never
developed a technological civilization before the advent of Europeans is
that there were no animals there suitable for domestication as beasts of
burden.</p>
<p>Llamas are native to South America, and have been used as beasts of
burden since prehistoric times, so Diamond points out that they are not
native to the continent as a whole, but only to the Andes mountains. Why
did no technological civilization arise in the Andes mountains? Why did
the Incan Empire not have an Enlightenment? Diamond’s position is that
other biogeographical factors were unfavourable.</p>
<p>The communist thinker Friedrich Engels proposed the same ultimate
explanation of history, and made the same proviso about llamas, in
1884:</p>
<p>The Eastern Hemisphere . . . possessed nearly all the animals
adaptable to domestication . . . The Western Hemisphere, America, had no
mammals that could be domesticated except the llama, which, moreover,
was only found in one part of South America . . . Owing to these
differences in natural conditions, the population of each hemisphere now
goes on its own way . . .</p>
<p>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</p>
<p>(Friedrich Engels, based on notes by Karl Marx)</p>
<p>But why did llamas continue to be ‘only found in one part of South
America’, if they could have been useful elsewhere? Engels did not
address that issue. But Diamond realized that it ‘cries out for
explanation’. Because, unless the reason that llamas were not exported
was itself biogeographical, Diamond’s ‘ultimate explanation’ is false.
So he proposed a biogeographical reason: he pointed out that a hot,
lowland region, unsuitable for llamas, separates the Andes from the
highlands of Central America where llamas would have been useful in
agriculture.</p>
<p>But, again, why must such a region have been a barrier to the spread
of domesticated llamas? Traders travelled between South and Central
America for centuries, perhaps overland and certainly by sea. Where
there are long-range traders, it is not necessary for an idea to be
useful in an unbroken line of places for it to be able to spread. As I
remarked in Chapter 11, knowledge has the unique ability to take aim at
a distant target and utterly transform it while having scarcely any
effect on the space between. So, what would it have taken for some of
those traders to take some llamas north for sale? Only the idea: the
leap of imagination to guess that if something is useful here, it might
be useful there too. And the boldness to take the speculative and
physical risk. Polynesian traders did exactly that. They ranged further,
across a more formidable natural barrier, carrying goods including
livestock. Why did none of the South American traders ever think of
selling llamas to the Central Americans? We may never know – but why
should it have had anything to do with geography? They may simply have
been too set in their ways. Perhaps innovative uses for animals were
taboo. Perhaps such a trade was attempted, but failed every time because
of sheer bad luck. But, whatever the reason was, it cannot have been
that the hot region constituted a physical barrier, for it did not.</p>
<p>Those are the parochial considerations. The bigger picture is that
the spread of llamas can only have been prevented by people’s ideas and
outlook. Had the Andeans had a Polynesian outlook instead, llamas might
have spread all over the Americas. Had the ancient Polynesians not had
that outlook, they might never have settled Polynesia in the first
place, and biogeographical explanations would now be referring to the
great ocean barrier as the ‘ultimate explanation’ for that. If the
Polynesians had been even better at long-range trading, they might have
managed to transport horses from Asia to their islands and thence to
South America – a feat perhaps no more impressive than Hannibal’s
transporting elephants across the Alps. If the ancient Greek
enlightenment had continued, Athenians might have been the first to
settle the Pacific islands and they would now be the ‘Polynesians’. Or,
if the early Andeans had worked out how to breed giant war llamas and
had ridden out to explore and conquer before anyone else had even
thought of domesticating the horse, South American biogeographers might
now be explaining that their ancestors colonized the world because no
other continent had llamas.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Americas had not always lacked large quadrupeds. When
the first humans arrived there, many species of ‘mega-fauna’ were
common, including wild horses, mammoths, mastodons and other members of
the elephant family. According to some theories, the humans hunted them
to extinction. What would have happened if one of those hunters had had
a different idea: to ride the beast before killing it? Generations
later, the knock-on effects of that bold conjecture might have been
tribes of warriors on horses and mammoths pouring back through Alaska
and re-conquering the Old World. Their descendants would now be
attributing this to the geographical distribution of mega-fauna. But the
real cause would have been that one idea in the mind of that one
hunter.</p>
<p>In early prehistory, populations were tiny, knowledge was parochial,
and history-making ideas were millennia apart. In those days, a meme
spread only when one person observed another enacting it nearby, and
(because of the staticity of cultures) rarely even then. So at that time
human behaviour resembled that of other animals, and much of what
happened was indeed explained by biogeography. But developments such as
abstract language, explanation, wealth above the level of subsistence,
and long-range trade all had the potential to erode parochialism and
hence to give causal power to ideas. By the time history began to be
recorded, it had long since become the history of ideas far more than
anything else – though unfortunately the ideas were still mainly of the
self-disabling, anti-rational variety. As for subsequent history, it
would take considerable dedication to insist that biogeographical
explanations account for the broad sweep of events. Why, for instance,
did the societies in North America and Western Europe, rather than Asia
and Eastern Europe, win the Cold War? Analysing climate, minerals,
flora, fauna and diseases can teach us nothing about that. The
explanation is that the Soviet system lost because its ideology wasn’t
true, and all the biogeography in the world cannot explain what was
false about it.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, one of the things that was most false about the
Soviet ideology was the very idea that there is an ultimate explanation
of history in mechanical, non-human terms, as proposed by Marx, Engels
and Diamond. Quite generally, mechanical reinterpretations of human
affairs not only lack explanatory power, they are morally wrong as well,
for in effect they deny the humanity of the participants, casting them
and their ideas merely as side effects of the landscape. Diamond says
that his main reason for writing Guns, Germs and Steel was that, unless
people are convinced that the relative success of Europeans was caused
by biogeography, they will for ever be tempted by racist explanations.
Well, not readers of this book, I trust! Presumably Diamond can look at
ancient Athens, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment – all of them the
quintessence of causation through the power of abstract ideas – and see
no way of attributing those events to ideas and to people; he just takes
it for granted that the only alternative to one reductionist,
dehumanizing reinterpretation of events is another.</p>
<p>In reality, the difference between Sparta and Athens, or between
Savonarola and Lorenzo de’ Medici, had nothing to do with their genes;
nor did the difference between the Easter Islanders and the imperial
British. They were all people – universal explainers and constructors.
But their ideas were different. Nor did landscape cause the
Enlightenment. It would be much truer to say that the landscape we live
in is the product of ideas. The primeval landscape, though packed with
evidence and therefore opportunity, contained not a single idea. It is
knowledge alone that converts landscapes into resources, and humans
alone who are the authors of explanatory knowledge and hence of the
uniquely human behaviour called ‘history’.</p>
<p>Physical resources such as plants, animals and minerals afford
opportunities, which may inspire new ideas, but they can neither create
ideas nor cause people to have particular ideas. They also cause
problems, but they do not prevent people from finding ways to solve
those problems. Some overwhelming natural event like a volcanic eruption
might have wiped out an ancient civilization regardless of what the
victims were thinking, but that sort of thing is exceptional. Usually,
if there are human beings left alive to think, there are ways of
thinking that can improve their situation, and then improve it further.
Unfortunately, as I have explained, there are also ways of thinking that
can prevent all improvement. Thus, since the beginning of civilization
and before, both the principal opportunities for progress and the
principal obstacles to progress have consisted of ideas alone. These are
the determinants of the broad sweep of history. The primeval
distribution of horses or llamas or flint or uranium can affect only the
details, and then only after some human being has had an idea for how to
use those things. The effects of ideas and decisions almost entirely
determine which biogeographical factors have a bearing on the next
chapter of human history, and what that effect will be. Marx, Engels and
Diamond have it the wrong way round.</p>
<p>A thousand years is a long time for a static society to survive. We
think of the great centralized empires of antiquity which lasted even
longer; but that is a selection effect: we have no record of most static
societies, and they must have been much shorter-lived. A natural guess
is that most were destroyed by the first challenge that would have
required the creation of a significantly new pattern of behaviour. The
isolated location of Easter Island, and the relatively hospitable nature
of its environment, might have given its static society a longer
lifespan than it would have had if it had been exposed to more tests by
nature and by other societies. But even those factors are still largely
human, not biogeographical: if the islanders had known how to make
long-range ocean voyages, the island would not have been ‘isolated’ in
the relevant sense. Likewise, how ‘hospitable’ Easter Island is depends
on what the inhabitants know. If its settlers had known as little about
survival techniques as I do, then they would not have survived their
first week on the island. And, on the other hand, today thousands of
people live on Easter Island without starving and without a forest –
though now they are planting one because they want to and know how.</p>
<p>The Easter Island civilization collapsed because no human situation
is free of new problems, and static societies are inherently unstable in
the face of new problems. Civilizations rose and collapsed on other
South Pacific islands too – including Pitcairn Island. That was part of
the broad sweep of history in the region. And, in the big picture, the
cause was that they all had problems that they failed to solve. The
Easter Islanders failed to navigate their way off the island, just as
the Romans failed to solve the problem of how to change governments
peacefully. If there was a forestry disaster on Easter Island, that was
not what brought its inhabitants down: it was that they were chronically
unable to solve the problem that this raised. If that problem had not
dispatched their civilization, some other problem eventually would have.
Sustaining their civilization in its static, statue-obsessed state was
never an option. The only options were whether it would collapse
suddenly and painfully, destroying most of what little knowledge they
had, or change slowly and for the better. Perhaps they would have chosen
the latter if only they had known how.</p>
<p>We do not know what horrors the Easter Island civilization
perpetrated in the course of preventing progress. But apparently its
fall did not improve anything. Indeed, the fall of tyranny is never
enough. The sustained creation of knowledge depends also on the presence
of certain kinds of idea, particularly optimism, and an associated
tradition of criticism. There would have to be social and political
institutions that incorporated and protected such traditions: a society
in which some degree of dissent and deviation from the norm was
tolerated, and whose educational practices did not entirely extinguish
creativity. None of that is trivially achieved. Western civilization is
the current consequence of achieving it – which is why, as I said, it
already has what it takes to avoid an Easter Island disaster. If it
really is facing a crisis, it must be some other crisis. If it ever
collapses, it will be in some other way and if it needs to be saved, it
will have to be by its own, unique methods.</p>
<p>In 1971, while I was still at school, I attended a lecture for
high-school students entitled ‘Population, Resources, Environment’. It
was given by the population scientist Paul Ehrlich. I do not remember
what I was expecting – I don’t think I had ever heard of ‘the
environment’ before – but nothing had prepared me for such a bravura
display of raw pessimism. Ehrlich starkly described to his young
audience the living hell we would be inheriting. Half a dozen varieties
of resource-management catastrophe were just around the corner, and it
was already too late to avoid some of them. People would be starving to
death by the billion in ten years, twenty at best. Raw materials were
running out: the Vietnam War, then in progress, was a last-ditch
struggle for the region’s tin, rubber and petroleum. (Notice how his
biogeographical explanation blithely shrugged off the political
disagreements that were in fact causing the conflict.) The troubles of
the day in American inner cities, rising crime, mental illness – all
were part of the same great catastrophe. All were linked by Ehrlich to
overpopulation, pollution and the reckless overuse of finite resources:
we had created too many power stations and factories, and mines, and
intensive farms – too much economic growth, far more than the planet
could sustain. And, worst of all, too many people – the ultimate source
of all the other ills. In this respect, Ehrlich was following in the
footsteps of Malthus, making the same error: setting predictions of one
process against prophecies of another. Thus he calculated that, if the
United States was to sustain even its 1971 standard of living, it would
have to reduce its population by three-quarters, to 50 million – which
was of course impossible in the time available. The planet as a whole
was overpopulated by a factor of seven, he said. Even Australia was
nearing its maximum sustainable population. And so on.</p>
<p>We had little basis for doubting what the professor was telling us
about the field he was studying. Yet for some reason our conversation
afterwards was not that of a group of students who had just had their
futures stolen. I do not know about the others, but I can remember when
I stopped worrying. At the end of the lecture a girl asked Ehrlich a
question. I have forgotten the details, but it had the form ‘What if we
solve [one of the problems that Ehrlich had described] within the next
few years? Wouldn’t that affect your conclusion?’ Ehrlich’s reply was
brisk. How could we possibly solve it? (She did not know.) And, even if
we did, how could that do more than briefly delay the catastrophe? And
what would we do then?</p>
<p>What a relief! Once I realized that Ehrlich’s prophesies amounted to
saying, ‘If we stop solving problems, we are doomed,’ I no longer found
them shocking, for how could it be otherwise? Quite possibly that girl
went on to solve the very problem she asked about, and the one after it.
At any rate, someone must have, because the catastrophe scheduled for
1991 has still not materialized. Nor have any of the others that Ehrlich
foretold.</p>
<p>Ehrlich thought that he was investigating a planet’s physical
resources and predicting their rate of decline. In fact he was
prophesying the content of future knowledge. And, by envisaging a future
in which only the best knowledge of 1971 was deployed, he was implicitly
assuming that only a small and rapidly dwindling set of problems would
ever be solved again. Furthermore, by casting problems in terms of
‘resource depletion’, and ignoring the human level of explanation, he
missed all the important determinants of what he was trying to predict,
namely: did the relevant people and institutions have what it takes to
solve problems? And, more broadly, what does it take to solve
problems?</p>
<p>A few years later, a graduate student in the then new subject of
environmental science explained to me that colour television was a sign
of the imminent collapse of our ‘consumer society’. Why? Because, first
of all, he said, it served no useful purpose. All the useful functions
of television could be performed just as well in monochrome. Adding
colour, at several times the cost, was merely ‘conspicuous consumption’.
That term had been coined by the economist Thorstein Veblen in 1902, a
couple of decades before even monochrome television was invented; it
meant wanting new possessions in order to show off to the neighbours.
That we had now reached the physical limit of conspicuous consumption
could be proved, said my colleague, by analysing the resource
constraints scientifically. The cathode-ray tubes in colour televisions
depended on the element europium to make the red phosphors on the
screen. Europium is one of the rarest elements on Earth. The planet’s
total known reserves were only enough to build a few hundred million
more colour televisions. After that, it would be back to monochrome. But
worse – think what this would mean. From then on there would be two
kinds of people: those with colour televisions and those without. And
the same would be true of everything else that was being consumed. It
would be a world with permanent class distinction, in which the elites
would hoard the last of the resources and live lives of gaudy display,
while, to sustain that illusory state through its final years, everyone
else would be labouring on in drab resentment. And so it went on,
nightmare built upon nightmare.</p>
<p>I asked him how he knew that no new source of europium would be
discovered. He asked how I knew that it would. And, even if it were,
what would we do then? I asked how he knew that colour cathode-ray tubes
could not be built without europium. He assured me that they could not:
it was a miracle that there existed even one element with the necessary
properties. After all, why should nature supply elements with properties
to suit our convenience?</p>
<p>I had to concede the point. There aren’t that many elements, and each
of them has only a few energy levels that could be used to emit light.
No doubt they had all been assessed by physicists. If the bottom line
was that there was no alternative to europium for making colour
televisions, then there was no alternative.</p>
<p>Yet something deeply puzzled me about that ‘miracle’ of the red
phosphor. If nature provides only one pair of suitable energy levels,
why does it provide even one? I had not yet heard of the fine-tuning
problem (it was new at the time), but this was puzzling for a similar
reason. Transmitting accurate images in real time is a natural thing for
people to want to do, like travelling fast. It would not have been
puzzling if the laws of physics forbade it, just as they do forbid
faster-than-light travel. For them to allow it but only if one knew how
would be normal too. But for them only just to allow it would be a
fine-tuning coincidence. Why would the laws of physics draw the line so
close to a point that happened to have significance for human
technology? It would be as if the centre of the Earth had turned out to
be within a few kilometres of the centre of the universe. It seemed to
violate the Principle of Mediocrity.</p>
<p>What made this even more puzzling was that, as with the real
fine-tuning problem, my colleague was claiming that there were many such
coincidences. His whole point was that the colour-television problem was
just one representative instance of a phenomenon that was happening
simultaneously in many areas of technology: the ultimate limits were
being reached. Just as we were using up the last stocks of the rarest of
rare-earth elements for the frivolous purpose of watching soap operas in
colour, so everything that looked like progress was actually just an
insane rush to exploit the last resources left on our planet. The 1970s
were, he believed, a unique and terrible moment in history.</p>
<p>He was right in one respect: no alternative red phosphor has been
discovered to this day. Yet, as I write this chapter, I see before me a
superbly coloured computer display that contains not one atom of
europium. Its pixels are liquid crystals consisting entirely of common
elements, and it does not require a cathode-ray tube. Nor would it
matter if it did, for by now enough europium has been mined to supply
every human being on earth with a dozen europium-type screens, and the
known reserves of the element comprise several times that amount.</p>
<p>Even while my pessimistic colleague was dismissing colour television
technology as useless and doomed, optimistic people were discovering new
ways of achieving it, and new uses for it – uses that he thought he had
ruled out by considering for five minutes how well colour televisions
could do the existing job of monochrome ones. But what stands out, for
me, is not the failed prophecy and its underlying fallacy, nor relief
that the nightmare never happened. It is the contrast between two
different conceptions of what people are. In the pessimistic conception,
they are wasters: they take precious resources and madly convert them
into useless coloured pictures. This is true of static societies: those
statues really were what my colleague thought colour televisions are –
which is why comparing our society with the ‘old culture’ of Easter
Island is exactly wrong. In the optimistic conception – the one that was
unforeseeably vindicated by events – people are problem-solvers:
creators of the unsustainable solution and hence also of the next
problem. In the pessimistic conception, that distinctive ability of
people is a disease for which sustainability is the cure. In the
optimistic one, sustainability is the disease and people are the
cure.</p>
<p>Since then, whole new industries have come into existence to harness
great waves of innovation, and in many of those – from medical imaging
to video games to desktop publishing to nature documentaries like
Attenborough’s – colour television proved to be very useful after all.
And, far from there being a permanent class distinction between
monochrome- and colour-television users, the monochrome technology is
now practically extinct, as are cathode-ray televisions. Colour displays
are now so cheap that they are being given away free with magazines as
advertising gimmicks. And all those technologies, far from being
divisive, are inherently egalitarian, sweeping away many formerly
entrenched barriers to people’s access to information, opinion, art and
education.</p>
<p>Optimistic opponents of Malthusian arguments are often – rightly –
keen to stress that all evils are due to lack of knowledge, and that
problems are soluble. Prophecies of disaster such as the ones I have
described do illustrate the fact that the prophetic mode of thinking, no
matter how plausible it seems prospectively, is fallacious and
inherently biased. However, to expect that problems will always be
solved in time to avert disasters would be the same fallacy. And,
indeed, the deeper and more dangerous mistake made by Malthusians is
that they claim to have a way of averting resource-allocation disasters
(namely, sustainability). Thus they also deny that other great truth
that I suggested we engrave in stone: problems are inevitable.</p>
<p>A solution may be problem-free for a period, and in a parochial
application, but there is no way of identifying in advance which
problems will have such a solution. Hence there is no way, short of
stasis, to avoid unforeseen problems arising from new solutions. But
stasis is itself unsustainable, as witness every static society in
history. Malthus could not have known that the obscure element uranium,
which had just been discovered, would eventually become relevant to the
survival of civilization, just as my colleague could not have known
that, within his lifetime, colour televisions would be saving lives
every day.</p>
<p>So there is no resource-management strategy that can prevent
disasters, just as there is no political system that provides only good
leaders and good policies, nor a scientific method that provides only
true theories. But there are ideas that reliably cause disasters, and
one of them is, notoriously, the idea that the future can be
scientifically planned. The only rational policy, in all three cases, is
to judge institutions, plans and ways of life according to how good they
are at correcting mistakes: removing bad policies and leaders,
superseding bad explanations, and recovering from disasters.</p>
<p>For example, one of the triumphs of twentieth-century progress was
the discovery of antibiotics, which ended many of the plagues and
endemic illnesses that had caused suffering and death since time
immemorial. However, it has been pointed out almost from the outset by
critics of ‘so-called progress’ that this triumph may only be temporary,
because of the evolution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This is
often held up as an indictment of – to give it its broad context –
Enlightenment hubris. We need lose only one battle in this war of
science against bacteria and their weapon, evolution (so the argument
goes), to be doomed, because our other ‘so-called progress’ – such as
cheap worldwide air travel, global trade, enormous cities – makes us
more vulnerable than ever before to a global pandemic that could exceed
the Black Death in destructiveness and even cause our extinction.</p>
<p>But all triumphs are temporary. So to use this fact to reinterpret
progress as ‘so-called progress’ is bad philosophy. The fact that
reliance on specific antibiotics is unsustainable is only an indictment
from the point of view of someone who expects a sustainable lifestyle.
But in reality there is no such thing. Only progress is sustainable.</p>
<p>The prophetic approach can see only what one might do to postpone
disaster, namely improve sustainability: drastically reduce and disperse
the population, make travel difficult, suppress contact between
different geographical areas. A society which did this would not be able
to afford the kind of scientific research that would lead to new
antibiotics. Its members would hope that their lifestyle would protect
them instead. But note that this lifestyle did not, when it was tried,
prevent the Black Death. Nor would it cure cancer.</p>
<p>Prevention and delaying tactics are useful, but they can be no more
than a minor part of a viable strategy for the future. Problems are
inevitable, and sooner or later survival will depend on being able to
cope when prevention and delaying tactics have failed. Obviously we need
to work towards cures. But we can do that only for diseases that we
already know about. So we need the capacity to deal with unforeseen,
unforeseeable failures. For this we need a large and vibrant research
community, interested in explanation and problem-solving. We need the
wealth to fund it, and the technological capacity to implement what it
discovers.</p>
<p>This is also true of the problem of climate change, about which there
is currently great controversy. We face the prospect that carbon-dioxide
emissions from technology will cause an increase in the average
temperature of the atmosphere, with harmful effects such as droughts,
sea-level rises, disruption to agriculture, and the extinctions of some
species. These are forecast to outweigh the beneficial effects, such as
an increase in crop yields, a general boost to plant life, and a
reduction in the number of people dying of hypothermia in winter.
Trillions of dollars, and a great deal of legislation and institutional
change, intended to reduce those emissions, currently hang on the
outcomes of simulations of the planet’s climate by the most powerful
supercomputers, and on projections by economists about what those
computations imply about the economy in the next century. In the light
of the above discussion, we should notice several things about the
controversy and about the underlying problem.</p>
<p>First, we have been lucky so far. Regardless of how accurate the
prevailing climate models are, it is uncontroversial from the laws of
physics, without any need for supercomputers or sophisticated modelling,
that such emissions must, eventually, increase the temperature, which
must, eventually, be harmful. Consider, therefore: what if the relevant
parameters had been just slightly different and the moment of disaster
had been in, say, 1902 – Veblen’s time – when carbondioxide emissions
were already orders of magnitude above their pre-Enlightenment values.
Then the disaster would have happened before anyone could have predicted
it or known what was happening. Sea levels would have risen, agriculture
would have been disrupted, millions would have begun to die, with worse
to come. And the great issue of the day would have been not how to
prevent it but what could be done about it.</p>
<p>They had no supercomputers then. Because of Babbage’s failures and
the scientific community’s misjudgements – and, perhaps most
importantly, their lack of wealth – they lacked the vital technology of
automated computing altogether. Mechanical calculators and roomfuls of
clerks would have been insufficient. But, much worse: they had almost no
atmospheric physicists. In fact the total number of physicists of all
kinds was a small fraction of the number who today work on climate
change alone. From society’s point of view, physicists were a luxury in
1902, like colour televisions were in the 1970s. Yet, to recover from
the disaster, society would have needed more scientific knowledge, and
better technology, and more of it – that is to say, more wealth. For
instance, in 1900, building a sea wall to protect the coast of a
low-lying island would have required resources so enormous that the only
islands that could have afforded it would have been those with either
large concentrations of cheap labour or exceptional wealth, as in the
Netherlands, much of whose population already lived below sea level
thanks to the technology of dyke-building.</p>
<p>This is a challenge that is highly susceptible to automation. But
people were in no position to address it in that way. All relevant
machines were underpowered, unreliable, expensive, and impossible to
produce in large numbers. An enormous effort to construct a Panama canal
had just failed with the loss of thousands of lives and vast amounts of
money, due to inadequate technology and scientific knowledge. And, to
compound those problems, the world as a whole had very little wealth by
today’s standards. Today, a coastal defence project would be well within
the capabilities of almost any coastal nation – and would add decades to
the time available to find other solutions to rising sea levels.</p>
<p>If none are found, what would we do then? That is a question of a
wholly different kind, which brings me to my second observation on the
climate-change controversy. It is that, while the supercomputer
simulations make (conditional) predictions, the economic forecasts make
almost pure prophecies. For we can expect the future of human responses
to climate to depend heavily on how successful people are at creating
new knowledge to address the problems that arise. So comparing
predictions with prophecies is going to lead to that same old
mistake.</p>
<p>Again, suppose that disaster had already been under way in 1902.
Consider what it would have taken for scientists to forecast, say,
carbon-dioxide emissions for the twentieth century. On the (shaky)
assumption that energy use would continue to increase by roughly the
same exponential factor as before, they could have estimated the
resulting increase in emissions. But that estimate would not have
included the effects of nuclear power. It could not have, because
radioactivity itself had only just been discovered, and would not be
harnessed for power until the middle of the century. But suppose that
somehow they had been able to foresee that. Then they might have
modified their carbon-dioxide forecast, and concluded that emissions
could easily be restored to below the 1902 level by the end of the
century. But, again, that would only be because they could not possibly
foresee the campaign against nuclear power, which would put a stop to
its expansion (ironically, on environmental grounds) before it ever
became a significant factor in reducing emissions. And so on. Time and
again, the unpredictable factor of new human ideas, both good and bad,
would make the scientific prediction useless. The same is bound to be
true – even more so – of forecasts today for the coming century. Which
brings me to my third observation about the current controversy.</p>
<p>It is not yet accurately known how sensitive the atmosphere’s
temperature is to the concentration of carbon dioxide – that is, how
much a given increase in concentration increases the temperature. This
number is important politically, because it affects how urgent the
problem is: high sensitivity means high urgency; low sensitivity means
the opposite. Unfortunately, this has led to the political debate being
dominated by the side issue of how ‘anthropogenic’ (human-caused) the
increase in temperature to date has been. It is as if people were
arguing about how best to prepare for the next hurricane while all
agreeing that the only hurricanes one should prepare for are
human-induced ones. All sides seem to assume that if it turns out that a
random fluctuation in the temperature is about to raise sea levels,
disrupt agriculture, wipe out species and so on, our best plan would be
simply to grin and bear it. Or if two-thirds of the increase is
anthropogenic, we should not mitigate the effects of the other
third.</p>
<p>Trying to predict what our net effect on the environment will be for
the next century and then subordinating all policy decisions to
optimizing that prediction cannot work. We cannot know how much to
reduce emissions by, nor how much effect that will have, because we
cannot know the future discoveries that will make some of our present
actions seem wise, some counter-productive and some irrelevant, nor how
much our efforts are going to be assisted or impeded by sheer luck.
Tactics to delay the onset of foreseeable problems may help. But they
cannot replace, and must be subordinate to, increasing our ability to
intervene after events turn out as we did not foresee. If that does not
happen in regard to carbon-dioxide-induced warming, it will happen with
something else.</p>
<p>Indeed, we did not foresee the global-warming disaster. I call it a
disaster because the prevailing theory is that our best option is to
prevent carbon-dioxide emissions by spending vast sums and enforcing
severe worldwide restrictions on behaviour, and that is already a
disaster by any reasonable measure. I call it unforeseen because we now
realize that it was already under way even in 1971, when I attended that
lecture. Ehrlich did tell us that agriculture was soon going to be
devastated by rapid climate change. But the change in question was going
to be global cooling, caused by smog and the condensation trails of
supersonic aircraft. The possibility of warming caused by gas emissions
had already been mooted by some scientists, but Ehrlich did not consider
it worth mentioning. He told us that the evidence was that a general
cooling trend had already begun, and that it would continue with
catastrophic effects, though it would be reversed in the very long term
because of ‘heat pollution’ from industry (an effect that is currently
at least a hundred times smaller than the global warming that
preoccupies us).</p>
<p>There is a saying that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure.
But that is only when one knows what to prevent. No precautions can
avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. To prepare for those, there
is nothing we can do but increase our ability to put things right if
they go wrong. Trying to rely on the sheer good luck of avoiding bad
outcomes indefinitely would simply guarantee that we would eventually
fail without the means of recovering.</p>
<p>The world is currently buzzing with plans to force reductions in gas
emissions at almost any cost. But it ought to be buzzing much more with
plans to reduce the temperature, or for how to thrive at a higher
temperature. And not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. Some
such plans exist – for instance to remove carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere by a variety of methods; and to generate clouds over the
oceans to reflect sunlight; and to encourage aquatic organisms to absorb
more carbon dioxide. But at the moment these are very minor research
efforts. Neither supercomputers nor international treaties nor vast sums
are devoted to them. They are not central to the human effort to face
this problem, or problems like it.</p>
<p>This is dangerous. There is as yet no serious sign of retreat into a
sustainable lifestyle (which would really mean achieving only the
semblance of sustainability), but even the aspiration is dangerous. For
what would we be aspiring to? To forcing the future world into our
image, endlessly reproducing our lifestyle, our misconceptions and our
mistakes. But if we choose instead to embark on an open-ended journey of
creation and exploration whose every step is unsustainable until it is
redeemed by the next – if this becomes the prevailing ethic and
aspiration of our society – then the ascent of man, the beginning of
infinity, will have become, if not secure, then at least
sustainable.</p>
