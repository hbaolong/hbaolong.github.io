<h4 id="understanding-prosperity-and-poverty">15. UNDERSTANDING
PROSPERITY AND POVERTY</h4>
<p>HISTORICAL ORIGINS</p>
<p>THERE ARE HUGE DIFFERENCES in living standards around the world. Even
the poorest citizens of the United States have incomes and access to
health care, education, public services, and economic and social
opportunities that are far superior to those available to the vast mass
of people living in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Central America.
The contrast of South and North Korea, the two Nogaleses, and the United
States and Mexico reminds us that these are relatively recent phenomena.
Five hundred years ago, Mexico, home to the Aztec state, was certainly
richer than the polities to the north, and the United States did not
pull ahead of Mexico until the nineteenth century. The gap between the
two Nogaleses is even more recent. South and North Korea were
economically, as well as socially and culturally, indistinguishable
before the country was divided at the 38th parallel after the Second
World War. Similarly, most of the huge economic differences we observe
around us today emerged over the last two hundred years.</p>
<p>Did this all need to be so? Was it historically—or geographically or
culturally or ethnically—predetermined that Western Europe, the United
States, and Japan would become so much richer than sub-Saharan Africa,
Latin America, and China over the last two hundred years or so? Was it
inevitable that the Industrial Revolution would get under way in the
eighteenth century in Britain, and then spread to Western Europe and
Europe’s offshoots in North America and Australasia? Is a counterfactual
world where the Glorious Revolution and the Industrial Revolution take
place in Peru, which then colonizes Western Europe and enslaves whites,
possible, or is it just a form of historical science fiction?</p>
<p>To answer—in fact, even to reason about—these questions, we need a
theory of why some nations are prosperous while others fail and are
poor. This theory needs to delineate both the factors that create and
retard prosperity and their historical origins. This book has proposed
such a theory. Any complex social phenomenon, such as the origins of the
different economic and political trajectories of hundreds of polities
around the world, likely has a multitude of causes, making most social
scientists shun monocausal, simple, and broadly applicable theories and
instead seek different explanations for seemingly similar outcomes
emerging in different times and areas. Instead we’ve offered a simple
theory and used it to explain the main contours of economic and
political development around the world since the Neolithic Revolution.
Our choice was motivated not by a naïve belief that such a theory could
explain everything, but by the belief that a theory should enable us to
focus on the parallels, sometimes at the expense of abstracting from
many interesting details. A successful theory, then, does not faithfully
reproduce details, but provides a useful and empirically well-grounded
explanation for a range of processes while also clarifying the main
forces at work.</p>
<p>Our theory has attempted to achieve this by operating on two levels.
The first is the distinction between extractive and inclusive economic
and political institutions. The second is our explanation for why
inclusive institutions emerged in some parts of the world and not in
others. While the first level of our theory is about an institutional
interpretation of history, the second level is about how history has
shaped institutional trajectories of nations.</p>
<p>Central to our theory is the link between inclusive economic and
political institutions and prosperity. Inclusive economic institutions
that enforce property rights, create a level playing field, and
encourage investments in new technologies and skills are more conducive
to economic growth than extractive economic institutions that are
structured to extract resources from the many by the few and that fail
to protect property rights or provide incentives for economic activity.
Inclusive economic institutions are in turn supported by, and support,
inclusive political institutions, that is, those that distribute
political power widely in a pluralistic manner and are able to achieve
some amount of political centralization so as to establish law and
order, the foundations of secure property rights, and an inclusive
market economy. Similarly, extractive economic institutions are
synergistically linked to extractive political institutions, which
concentrate power in the hands of a few, who will then have incentives
to maintain and develop extractive economic institutions for their
benefit and use the resources they obtain to cement their hold on
political power.</p>
<p>These tendencies do not imply that extractive economic and political
institutions are inconsistent with economic growth. On the contrary,
every elite would, all else being equal, like to encourage as much
growth as possible in order to have more to extract. Extractive
institutions that have achieved at least a minimal degree of political
centralization are often able to generate some amount of growth. What is
crucial, however, is that growth under extractive institutions will not
be sustained, for two key reasons. First, sustained economic growth
requires innovation, and innovation cannot be decoupled from creative
destruction, which replaces the old with the new in the economic realm
and also destabilizes established power relations in politics. Because
elites dominating extractive institutions fear creative destruction,
they will resist it, and any growth that germinates under extractive
institutions will be ultimately short lived. Second, the ability of
those who dominate extractive institutions to benefit greatly at the
expense of the rest of society implies that political power under
extractive institutions is highly coveted, making many groups and
individuals fight to obtain it. As a consequence, there will be powerful
forces pushing societies under extractive institutions toward political
instability.</p>
<p>The synergies between extractive economic and political institutions
create a vicious circle, where extractive institutions, once in place,
tend to persist. Similarly, there is a virtuous circle associated with
inclusive economic and political institutions. But neither the vicious
nor the virtuous circle is absolute. In fact, some nations live under
inclusive institutions today because, though extractive institutions
have been the norm in history, some societies have been able to break
the mold and transition toward inclusive institutions. Our explanation
for these transitions is historical, but not historically predetermined.
Major institutional change, the requisite for major economic change,
takes place as a result of the interaction between existing institutions
and critical junctures. Critical junctures are major events that disrupt
the existing political and economic balance in one or many societies,
such as the Black Death, which killed possibly as much as half the
population of most areas in Europe during the fourteenth century; the
opening of Atlantic trade routes, which created enormous profit
opportunities for many in Western Europe; and the Industrial Revolution,
which offered the potential for rapid but also disruptive changes in the
structure of economies around the world.</p>
<p>Existing institutional differences among societies themselves are a
result of past institutional changes. Why does the path of institutional
change differ across societies? The answer to this question lies in
institutional drift. In the same way that the genes of two isolated
populations of organisms will drift apart slowly because of random
mutations in the so-called process of evolutionary or genetic drift, two
otherwise similar societies will also drift apart
institutionally—albeit, again, slowly. Conflict over income and power,
and indirectly over institutions, is a constant in all societies. This
conflict often has a contingent outcome, even if the playing field over
which it transpires is not level. The outcome of this conflict leads to
institutional drift. But this is not necessarily a cumulative process.
It does not imply that the small differences that emerge at some point
will necessarily become larger over time. On the contrary, as our
discussion of Roman Britain in chapter 6 illustrates, small differences
open up, and then disappear, and then reappear again. However, when a
critical juncture arrives, these small differences that have emerged as
a result of institutional drift may be the small differences that matter
in leading otherwise quite similar societies to diverge radically.</p>
<p>We saw in chapters 7 and 8 that despite the many similarities between
England, France, and Spain, the critical juncture of the Atlantic trade
had the most transformative impact on England because of such small
differences—the fact that because of developments during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, the English Crown could not control all
overseas trade, as this trade was mostly under Crown monopoly in France
and Spain. As a result, in France and Spain, it was the monarchy and the
groups allied with it who were the main beneficiaries of the large
profits created by Atlantic trade and colonial expansion, while in
England it was groups strongly opposed to the monarchy who gained from
economic opportunities thrown open by this critical juncture. Though
institutional drift leads to small differences, its interplay with
critical junctures leads to institutional divergence, and thus this
divergence then creates the now more major institutional differences
that the next critical juncture will affect.</p>
<p>History is key, since it is historical processes that, via
institutional drift, create the differences that may become
consequential during critical junctures. Critical junctures themselves
are historical turning points. And the vicious and virtuous circles
imply that we have to study history to understand the nature of
institutional differences that have been historically structured. Yet
our theory does not imply historical determinism—or any other kind of
determinism. It is for this reason that the answer to the question we
started with in this chapter is no: there was no historical necessity
that Peru end up so much poorer than Western Europe or the United
States.</p>
<p>To start with, in contrast with the geography and culture hypotheses,
Peru is not condemned to poverty because of its geography or culture. In
our theory, Peru is so much poorer than Western Europe and the United
States today because of its institutions, and to understand the reasons
for this, we need to understand the historical process of institutional
development in Peru. As we saw in the second chapter, five hundred years
ago the Inca Empire, which occupied contemporary Peru, was richer, more
technologically sophisticated, and more politically centralized than the
smaller polities occupying North America. The turning point was the way
in which this area was colonized and how this contrasted with the
colonization of North America. This resulted not from a historically
predetermined process but as the contingent outcome of several pivotal
institutional developments during critical junctures. At least three
factors could have changed this trajectory and led to very different
long-run patterns.</p>
<p>First, institutional differences within the Americas during the
fifteenth century shaped how these areas were colonized. North America
followed a different institutional trajectory than Peru because it was
sparsely settled before colonization and attracted European settlers who
then successfully rose up against the elite whom entities such as the
Virginia Company and the English Crown had tried to create. In contrast,
Spanish conquistadors found a centralized, extractive state in Peru they
could take over and a large population they could put to work in mines
and plantations. There was also nothing geographically predetermined
about the lay of the land within the Americas at the time the Europeans
arrived. In the same way that the emergence of a centralized state led
by King Shyaam among the Bushong was a result of a major institutional
innovation, or perhaps even of political revolution, as we saw in
chapter 5, the Inca civilization in Peru and the large populations in
this area resulted from major institutional innovations. These could
instead have taken place in North America, in places such as the
Mississippi Valley or even the northeastern United States. Had this been
the case, Europeans might have encountered empty lands in the Andes and
centralized states in North America, and the roles of Peru and the
United States could have been reversed. Europeans would then have
settled in areas around Peru, and the conflict between the majority of
settlers and the elite could have led to the creation of inclusive
institutions there instead of in North America. The subsequent paths of
economic development would then likely have been different.</p>
<p>Second, the Inca Empire might have resisted European colonialism, as
Japan did when Commodore Perry’s ships arrived in Edo Bay. Though the
greater extractiveness of the Inca Empire in contrast with Tokugawa,
Japan, certainly made a political revolution akin to the Meiji
Restoration less likely in Peru, there was no historical necessity that
the Inca completely succumb to European domination. If they had been
able to resist and even institutionally modernize in response to the
threats, the whole path of the history of the New World, and with it the
entire history of the world, could have been different.</p>
<p>Third and most radically, it is not even historically or
geographically or culturally predetermined that Europeans should have
been the ones colonizing the world. It could have been the Chinese or
even the Incas. Of course, such an outcome is impossible when we look at
the world from the vantage point of the fifteenth century, by which time
Western Europe had pulled ahead of the Americas, and China had already
turned inward. But Western Europe of the fifteenth century was itself an
outcome of a contingent process of institutional drift punctuated by
critical junctures, and nothing about it was inevitable. Western
European powers could not have surged ahead and conquered the world
without several historic turning points. These included the specific
path that feudalism took, replacing slavery and weakening the power of
monarchs on the way; the fact that the centuries following the turn of
the first millennium in Europe witnessed the development of independent
and commercially autonomous cities; the fact that European monarchs were
not as threatened by, and consequently did not try to discourage,
overseas trade as the Chinese emperors did during the Ming dynasty; and
the arrival of the Black Death, which shook up the foundations of the
feudal order. If these events had transpired differently, we could be
living in a very different world today, one in which Peru might be
richer than Western Europe or the United States.</p>
<p>NATURALLY, THE PREDICTIVE POWER of a theory where both small
differences and contingency play key roles will be limited. Few would
have predicted in the fifteenth or even the sixteenth centuries, let
alone in the many centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire, that
the major breakthrough toward inclusive institutions would happen in
Britain. It was only the specific process of institutional drift and the
nature of the critical juncture created by the opening of Atlantic trade
that made this possible. Neither would many have believed in the midst
of the Cultural Revolution during the 1970s that China would soon be on
a path toward radical changes in its economic institutions and
subsequently on a breakneck growth trajectory. It is similarly
impossible to predict with any certainty what the lay of the land will
be in five hundred years. Yet these are not shortcomings of our theory.
The historical account we have presented so far indicates that any
approach based on historical determinism—based on geography, culture, or
even other historical factors—is inadequate. Small differences and
contingency are not just part of our theory; they are part of the shape
of history.</p>
<p>Even if making precise predictions about which societies will prosper
relative to others is difficult, we have seen throughout the book that
our theory explains the broad differences in the prosperity and poverty
of nations around the world fairly well. We will see in the rest of this
chapter that it also provides some guidelines as to what types of
societies are more likely to achieve economic growth over the next
several decades.</p>
<p>First, vicious and virtuous circles generate a lot of persistence and
sluggishness. There should be little doubt that in fifty or even a
hundred years, the United States and Western Europe, based on their
inclusive economic and political institutions, will be richer, most
likely considerably richer, than sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East,
Central America, or Southeast Asia. However, within these broad patterns
there will be major institutional changes in the next century, with some
countries breaking the mold and transitioning from poor to rich.</p>
<p>Nations that have achieved almost no political centralization, such
as Somalia and Afghanistan, or those that have undergone a collapse of
the state, such as Haiti did over the last several decades—long before
the massive earthquake there in 2010 led to the devastation of the
country’s infrastructure—are unlikely either to achieve growth under
extractive political institutions or to make major changes toward
inclusive institutions. Instead, nations likely to grow over the next
several decades—albeit probably under extractive institutions—are those
that have attained some degree of political centralization. In
sub-Saharan Africa this includes Burundi, Ethiopia, Rwanda, nations with
long histories of centralized states, and Tanzania, which has managed to
build such centralization, or at least put in place some of the
prerequisites for centralization, since independence. In Latin America,
it includes Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, which have not only achieved
political centralization but also made significant strides toward
nascent pluralism. Our theory would suggest that sustained economic
growth is very unlikely in Colombia.</p>
<p>Our theory also suggests that growth under extractive political
institutions, as in China, will not bring sustained growth, and is
likely to run out of steam. Beyond these cases, there is much
uncertainty. Cuba, for example, might transition toward inclusive
institutions and experience a major economic transformation, or it may
linger on under extractive political and economic institutions. The same
is true of North Korea and Burma (Myanmar) in Asia. Thus, while our
theory provides the tools for thinking about how institutions change and
the consequences of such changes, the nature of this change—the role of
small differences and contingency—makes more precise predictions
difficult.</p>
<p>Even greater caution is necessary in drawing policy recommendations
from this broad account of the origins of prosperity and poverty. In the
same way that the impact of critical junctures depends on existing
institutions, how a society will respond to the same policy intervention
depends on the institutions that are in place. Of course, our theory is
all about how nations can take steps toward prosperity—by transforming
their institutions from extractive to inclusive. But it also makes it
very clear from the outset that there are no easy recipes for achieving
such a transition. First, the vicious circle implies that changing
institutions is much harder than it first appears. In particular,
extractive institutions can re-create themselves under different guises,
as we saw with the iron law of oligarchy in chapter 12. Thus the fact
that the extractive regime of President Mubarak was overturned by
popular protest in February 2011 does not guarantee that Egypt will move
onto a path to more inclusive institutions. Instead extractive
institutions may re-create themselves despite the vibrant and hopeful
pro-democracy movement. Second, because the contingent path of history
implies that it is difficult to know whether a particular interplay of
critical junctures and existing institutional differences will lead
toward more inclusive or extractive institutions, it would be heroic to
formulate general policy recommendations to encourage change toward
inclusive institutions. Nevertheless, our theory is still useful for
policy analysis, as it enables us to recognize bad policy advice, based
on either incorrect hypotheses or inadequate understanding of how
institutions can change. In this, as in most things, avoiding the worst
mistakes is as important as—and more realistic than—attempting to
develop simple solutions. Perhaps this is most clearly visible when we
consider current policy recommendations encouraging “authoritarian
growth” based on the successful Chinese growth experience of the last
several decades. We next explain why these policy recommendations are
misleading and why Chinese growth, as it has unfolded so far, is just
another form of growth under extractive political institutions, unlikely
to translate into sustained economic development.</p>
<p>THE IRRESISTIBLE CHARM OF AUTHORITARIAN GROWTH</p>
<p>Dai Guofang recognized the coming urban boom in China early on. New
highways, business centers, residences, and skyscrapers were sprawling
everywhere around China in the 1990s, and Dai thought this growth would
only pick up speed in the next decade. He reasoned that his company,
Jingsu Tieben Iron and Steel, could capture a large market as a low-cost
producer, especially compared with the inefficient state-owned steel
factories. Dai planned to build a true steel giant, and with support
from the local party bosses in Changzhou, he started building in 2003.
By March 2004, however, the project had been stopped by order of the
Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, and Dai was arrested for reasons
never clearly articulated. The authorities may have presumed that they
would find some incriminating evidence in Dai’s accounts. In the event,
he spent the next five years in jail and home detention, and was found
guilty on a minor charge in 2009. His real crime was to start a large
project that would compete with state-sponsored companies and do so
without the approval of the higher-ups in the Communist Party. This was
certainly the lesson that others drew from the case.</p>
<p>The Communist Party’s reaction to entrepreneurs such as Dai should
not be a surprise. Chen Yun, one of Deng Xiaoping’s closest associates
and arguably the major architect behind the early market reforms,
summarized the views of most party cadres with a “bird in a cage”
analogy for the economy: China’s economy was the bird; the party’s
control, the cage, had to be enlarged to make the bird healthier and
more dynamic, but it could not be unlocked or removed, lest the bird fly
away. Jiang Zemin, shortly after becoming general secretary of the
Communist Party in 1989, the most powerful position in China, went even
further and summarized the party’s suspicion of entrepreneurs by
characterizing them as “self-employed traders and peddlers [who] cheat,
embezzle, bribe and evade taxation.” Throughout the 1990s, even as
foreign investment was pouring into China and state-owned enterprises
were encouraged to expand, private entrepreneurship was greeted with
suspicion, and many entrepreneurs were expropriated or even jailed.
Jiang Zemin’s view of entrepreneurs, though in relative decline, is
still widespread in China. In the words of a Chinese economist, “Big
state companies can get involved in huge projects. But when private
companies do so, especially in competition with the state, then trouble
comes from every corners [sic].”</p>
<p>While scores of private companies are now profitably operating in
China, many elements of the economy are still under the party’s command
and protection. Journalist Richard McGregor reports that on the desk of
the head of each of the biggest state companies in China stands a red
phone. When it rings, it is the party calling with orders on what the
company should do, where it should invest, and what its targets will be.
These giant companies are still under the command of the party, a fact
we are reminded of when the party decides to shuffle their chief
executives, fire them, or promote them, with little explanation.</p>
<p>These stories of course do not deny that China has made great strides
toward inclusive economic institutions, strides that underpin its
spectacular growth rates over the past thirty years. Most entrepreneurs
have some security, not least because they cultivate the support of
local cadres and Communist Party elites in Beijing. Most state-owned
enterprises seek profits and compete in international markets. This is a
radical change from the China of Mao. As we saw in the previous chapter,
China was first able to grow because under Deng Xiaoping there were
radical reforms away from the most extractive economic institutions and
toward inclusive economic institutions. Growth has continued as Chinese
economic institutions have been on a path toward greater inclusiveness,
albeit at a slow pace. China is also greatly benefiting from its large
supply of cheap labor and its access to foreign markets, capital, and
technologies.</p>
<p>Even if Chinese economic institutions are incomparably more inclusive
today than three decades ago, the Chinese experience is an example of
growth under extractive political institutions. Despite the recent
emphasis in China on innovation and technology, Chinese growth is based
on the adoption of existing technologies and rapid investment, not
creative destruction. An important aspect of this is that property
rights are not entirely secure in China. Every now and then, just like
Dai, some entrepreneurs are expropriated. Labor mobility is tightly
regulated, and the most basic of property rights, the right to sell
one’s own labor in the way one wishes, is still highly imperfect. The
extent to which economic institutions are still far from being truly
inclusive is illustrated by the fact that only a few businessmen and
-women would even venture into any activity without the support of the
local party cadre or, even more important, of Beijing. The connection
between business and the party is highly lucrative for both. Businesses
supported by the party receive contracts on favorable terms, can evict
ordinary people to expropriate their land, and violate laws and
regulations with impunity. Those who stand in the path of this business
plan will be trampled and can even be jailed or murdered.</p>
<p>The all-too-present weight of the Communist Party and extractive
institutions in China remind us of the many similarities between Soviet
growth in the 1950s and ’60s and Chinese growth today, though there are
also notable differences. The Soviet Union achieved growth under
extractive economic institutions and extractive political institutions
because it forcibly allocated resources toward industry under a
centralized command structure, particularly armaments and heavy
industry. Such growth was feasible partly because there was a lot of
catching up to be done. Growth under extractive institutions is easier
when creative destruction is not a necessity. Chinese economic
institutions are certainly more inclusive than those in the Soviet
Union, but China’s political institutions are still extractive. The
Communist Party is all-powerful in China and controls the entire state
bureaucracy, the armed forces, the media, and large parts of the
economy. Chinese people have few political freedoms and very little
participation in the political process.</p>
<p>Many have long believed that growth in China would bring democracy
and greater pluralism. There was a real sense in 1989 that the Tiananmen
Square demonstrations would lead to greater opening and perhaps even the
collapse of the communist regime. But tanks were unleashed on the
demonstrators, and instead of a peaceful revolution, history books now
call it the Tiananmen Square Massacre. In many ways, Chinese political
institutions became more extractive in the aftermath of Tiananmen;
reformers such as Zhao Ziyang, who as general secretary of the Communist
Party lent his support to the students in Tiananmen Square, were purged,
and the party clamped down on civil liberties and press freedom with
greater zeal. Zhao Ziyang was put under house arrest for more than
fifteen years, and his public record was gradually erased, so that he
would not be even a symbol for those who supported political change.</p>
<p>Today the party’s control over the media, including the Internet, is
unprecedented. Much of this is achieved through self-censorship: media
outlets know that they should not mention Zhao Ziyang or Liu Xiaobo, the
government critic demanding greater democratization, who is still
languishing in prison even after he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Self-censorship is supported by an Orwellian apparatus that can monitor
conversations and communications, close Web sites and newspapers, and
even selectively block access to individual news stories on the
Internet. All of this was on display when news about corruption charges
against the son of the general secretary of the party since 2002, Hu
Jintao, broke out in 2009. The party’s apparatus immediately sprang into
action and was not only able to prevent Chinese media from covering the
case but also managed to selectively block stories about the case on the
New York Times and Financial Times Web sites.</p>
<p>Because of the party’s control over economic institutions, the extent
of creative destruction is heavily curtailed, and it will remain so
until there is radical reform in political institutions. Just as in the
Soviet Union, the Chinese experience of growth under extractive
political institutions is greatly facilitated because there is a lot of
catching up to do. Income per capita in China is still a fraction of
that in the United States and Western Europe. Of course, Chinese growth
is considerably more diversified than Soviet growth; it doesn’t rely on
only armaments or heavy industry, and Chinese entrepreneurs are showing
a lot of ingenuity. All the same, this growth will run out of steam
unless extractive political institutions make way for inclusive
institutions. As long as political institutions remain extractive,
growth will be inherently limited, as it has been in all other similar
cases.</p>
<p>The Chinese experience does raise several interesting questions about
the future of Chinese growth and, more important, the desirability and
viability of authoritarian growth. Such growth has become a popular
alternative to the “Washington consensus,” which emphasizes the
importance of market and trade liberalization and certain forms of
institutional reform for kick-starting economic growth in many less
developed parts of the world. While part of the appeal of authoritarian
growth comes as a reaction to the Washington consensus, perhaps its
greater charm—certainly to the rulers presiding over extractive
institutions—is that it gives them free rein in maintaining and even
strengthening their hold on power and legitimizes their extraction.</p>
<p>As our theory highlights, particularly in societies that have
undergone some degree of state centralization, this type of growth under
extractive institutions is possible and may even be the most likely
scenario for many nations, ranging from Cambodia and Vietnam to Burundi,
Ethiopia, and Rwanda. But it also implies that like all examples of
growth under extractive political institutions, it will not be
sustained.</p>
<p>In the case of China, the growth process based on catch-up, import of
foreign technology, and export of low-end manufacturing products is
likely to continue for a while. Nevertheless, Chinese growth is also
likely to come to an end, particularly once China reaches the standards
of living level of a middle-income country. The most likely scenario may
be for the Chinese Communist Party and the increasingly powerful Chinese
economic elite to manage to maintain their very tight grip on power in
the next several decades. In this case, history and our theory suggest
that growth with creative destruction and true innovation will not
arrive, and the spectacular growth rates in China will slowly evaporate.
But this outcome is far from preordained; it can be avoided if China
transitions to inclusive political institutions before its growth under
extractive institutions reaches its limit. Nevertheless, as we will see
next, there is little reason to expect that a transition in China toward
more inclusive political institutions is likely or that it will take
place automatically and painlessly.</p>
<p>Even some voices within the Chinese Communist Party are recognizing
the dangers on the road ahead and are throwing around the idea that
political reform—that is, a transition to more inclusive political
institutions, to use our terminology—is necessary. The powerful premier
Wen Jiabao has recently warned of the danger that economic growth will
be hampered unless political reform gets under way. We think Wen’s
analysis is prescient, even if some people doubt his sincerity. But many
in the West do not agree with Wen’s pronouncements. To them, China
reveals an alternative path to sustained economic growth, one under
authoritarianism rather than inclusive economic and political
institutions. But they are wrong. We have already seen the important
salient roots of Chinese success: a radical change in economic
institutions away from rigidly communist ones and toward institutions
that provide incentives to increase productivity and to trade. Looked at
from this perspective, there is nothing fundamentally different about
China’s experience relative to that of countries that have managed to
take steps away from extractive and toward inclusive economic
institutions, even when this takes place under extractive political
institutions, as in the Chinese case. China has thus achieved economic
growth not thanks to its extractive political institutions, but despite
them: its successful growth experience over the last three decades is
due to a radical shift away from extractive economic institutions and
toward significantly more inclusive economic institutions, which was
made more difficult, not easier, by the presence of highly
authoritarian, extractive political institutions.</p>
<p>A DIFFERENT TYPE of endorsement of authoritarian growth recognizes
its unattractive nature but claims that authoritarianism is just a
passing stage. This idea goes back to one of the classical theories of
political sociology, the theory of modernization, formulated by Seymour
Martin Lipset. Modernization theory maintains that all societies, as
they grow, are headed toward a more modern, developed, and civilized
existence, and in particular toward democracy. Many followers of
modernization theory also claim that, like democracy, inclusive
institutions will emerge as a by-product of the growth process.
Moreover, even though democracy is not the same as inclusive political
institutions, regular elections and relatively unencumbered political
competition are likely to bring forth the development of inclusive
political institutions. Different versions of modernization theory also
claim that an educated workforce will naturally lead to democracy and
better institutions. In a somewhat postmodern version of modernization
theory, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman went so far as to
suggest that once a country got enough McDonald’s restaurants, democracy
and institutions were bound to follow. All this paints an optimistic
picture. Over the past sixty years, most countries, even many of those
with extractive institutions, have experienced some growth, and most
have witnessed notable increases in the educational attainment of their
workforces. So, as their incomes and educational levels continue to
rise, one way or another, all other good things, such as democracy,
human rights, civil liberties, and secure property rights, should
follow.</p>
<p>Modernization theory has a wide following both within and outside
academia. Recent U.S. attitudes toward China, for example, have been
shaped by this theory. George H. W. Bush summarized U.S. policy toward
Chinese democracy as “Trade freely with China and time is on our side.”
The idea was that as China traded freely with the West, it would grow,
and that growth would bring democracy and better institutions in China,
as modernization theory predicted. Yet the rapid increase in U.S.-China
trade since the mid-1980s has done little for Chinese democracy, and the
even closer integration that is likely to follow during the next decade
will do equally little.</p>
<p>The attitudes of many about the future of Iraqi society and democracy
in the aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion were similarly optimistic
because of modernization theory. Despite its disastrous economic
performance under Saddam Hussein’s regime, Iraq was not as poor in 2002
as many sub-Saharan African nations, and it had a comparatively
well-educated population, so it was believed to be ripe ground for the
development of democracy and civil liberties, and perhaps even what we
would describe as pluralism. These hopes were quickly dashed as chaos
and civil war descended upon Iraqi society.</p>
<p>Modernization theory is both incorrect and unhelpful for thinking
about how to confront the major problems of extractive institutions in
failing nations. The strongest piece of evidence in favor of
modernization theory is that rich nations are the ones that have
democratic regimes, respect civil and human rights, and enjoy
functioning markets and generally inclusive economic institutions. Yet
interpreting this association as supporting modernization theory ignores
the major effect of inclusive economic and political institutions on
economic growth. As we have argued throughout this book, it is the
societies with inclusive institutions that have grown over the past
three hundred years and have become relatively rich today. That this
accounts for what we see around us is shown clearly if we look at the
facts slightly differently: while nations that have built inclusive
economic and political institutions over the last several centuries have
achieved sustained economic growth, authoritarian regimes that have
grown more rapidly over the past sixty or one hundred years, contrary to
what Lipset’s modernization theory would claim, have not become more
democratic. And this is in fact not surprising. Growth under extractive
institutions is possible precisely because it doesn’t necessarily or
automatically imply the demise of these very institutions. In fact, it
is often generated because those in control of the extractive
institutions view economic growth as not a threat but a support to their
regime, as the Chinese Communist Party has done since the 1980s. It is
also not surprising that growth generated by increases in the value of
the natural resources of a nation, such as in Gabon, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, and Venezuela, is unlikely to lead to a fundamental
transformation of these authoritarian regimes toward inclusive
institutions.</p>
<p>The historical record is even less generous to modernization theory.
Many relatively prosperous nations have succumbed to and supported
repressive dictatorships and extractive institutions. Both Germany and
Japan were among the richest and most industrialized nations in the
world in the first half of the twentieth century, and had comparatively
well-educated citizens. This did not prevent the rise of the National
Socialist Party in Germany or a militaristic regime intent on
territorial expansion via war in Japan—making both political and
economic institutions take a sharp turn toward extractive institutions.
Argentina was also one of the richest countries in the world in the
nineteenth century, as rich as or even richer than Britain, because it
was the beneficiary of the worldwide resource boom; it also had the most
educated population in Latin America. But democracy and pluralism were
no more successful, and were arguably less successful, in Argentina than
in much of the rest of Latin America. One coup followed another, and as
we saw in chapter 11, even democratically elected leaders acted as
rapacious dictators. Even more recently there has been little progress
toward inclusive economic institutions, and as we saw in chapter 13,
twenty-first-century Argentinian governments can still expropriate their
citizens’ wealth with impunity.</p>
<p>All of this highlights several important ideas. First, growth under
authoritarian, extractive political institutions in China, though likely
to continue for a while yet, will not translate into sustained growth,
supported by truly inclusive economic institutions and creative
destruction. Second, contrary to the claims of modernization theory, we
should not count on authoritarian growth leading to democracy or
inclusive political institutions. China, Russia, and several other
authoritarian regimes currently experiencing some growth are likely to
reach the limits of extractive growth before they transform their
political institutions in a more inclusive direction—and in fact,
probably before there is any desire among the elite for such changes or
any strong opposition forcing them to do so. Third, authoritarian growth
is neither desirable nor viable in the long run, and thus should not
receive the endorsement of the international community as a template for
nations in Latin America, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa, even if it is a
path that many nations will choose precisely because it is sometimes
consistent with the interests of the economic and political elites
dominating them.</p>
<p>YOU CAN’T ENGINEER PROSPERITY</p>
<p>Unlike the theory we have developed in this book, the ignorance
hypothesis comes readily with a suggestion about how to “solve” the
problem of poverty: if ignorance got us here, enlightening and informing
rulers and policymakers can get us out, and we should be able to
“engineer” prosperity around the world by providing the right advice and
by convincing politicians of what is good economics. In chapter 2, when
we discussed this hypothesis, we showed how the experience of Ghana’s
prime minister Kofi Busia in the early 1970s underscored the fact that
the main obstacle to the adoption of policies that would reduce market
failures and encourage economic growth is not the ignorance of
politicians, but the incentives and constraints they face from the
political and economic institutions in their societies. Nevertheless,
the ignorance hypothesis still rules supreme in Western policymaking
circles, which, almost to the exclusion of anything else, focus on how
to engineer prosperity.</p>
<p>These engineering attempts come in two flavors. The first, often
advocated by international organizations such as the International
Monetary Fund, recognizes that poor development is caused by bad
economic policies and institutions, and then proposes a list of
improvements these international organizations attempt to induce poor
countries to adopt. (The Washington consensus makes up one such list.)
These improvements focus on sensible things such as macroeconomic
stability and seemingly attractive macroeconomic goals such as a
reduction in the size of the government sector, flexible exchange rates,
and capital account liberalization. They also focus on more
microeconomic goals, such as privatization, improvements in the
efficiency of public service provision, and perhaps also suggestions as
to how to improve the functioning of the state itself by emphasizing
anticorruption measures. Though on their own many of these reforms might
be sensible, the approach of international organizations in Washington,
London, Paris, and elsewhere is still steeped in an incorrect
perspective that fails to recognize the role of political institutions
and the constraints they place on policymaking. Attempts by
international institutions to engineer economic growth by hectoring poor
countries into adopting better policies and institutions are not
successful because they do not take place in the context of an
explanation of why bad policies and institutions are there in the first
place, except that the leaders of poor countries are ignorant. The
consequence is that the policies are not adopted and not implemented, or
are implemented in name only.</p>
<p>For example, many economies around the world ostensibly implementing
such reforms, most notably in Latin America, stagnated throughout the
1980s and ’90s. In reality, such reforms were foisted upon these
countries in contexts where politics went on as usual. Hence, even when
reforms were adopted, their intent was subverted, or politicians used
other ways to blunt their impact. All this is illustrated by the
“implementation” of one of the key recommendations of international
institutions aimed at achieving macroeconomic stability, central bank
independence. This recommendation either was implemented in theory but
not in practice or was undermined by the use of other policy
instruments. It was quite sensible in principle. Many politicians around
the world were spending more than they were raising in tax revenue and
were then forcing their central banks to make up the difference by
printing money. The resulting inflation was creating instability and
uncertainty. The theory was that independent central banks, just like
the Bundesbank in Germany, would resist political pressure and put a lid
on inflation. Zimbabwe’s president Mugabe decided to heed international
advice; he declared the Zimbabwean central bank independent in 1995.
Before this, the inflation rate in Zimbabwe was hovering around 20
percent. By 2002 it had reached 140 percent; by 2003, almost 600
percent; by 2007, 66,000 percent; and by 2008, 230 million percent! Of
course, in a country where the president wins the lottery (this
page–this page), it should surprise nobody that passing a law making the
central bank independent means nothing. The governor of the Zimbabwean
central bank probably knew how his counterpart in Sierra Leone had
“fallen” from the top floor of the central bank building when he
disagreed with Siaka Stevens (this page). Independent or not, complying
with the president’s demands was the prudent choice for his personal
health, even if not for the health of the economy. Not all countries are
like Zimbabwe. In Argentina and Colombia, central banks were also made
independent in the 1990s, and they actually did their job of reducing
inflation. But since in neither country was politics changed, political
elites could use other ways to buy votes, maintain their interests, and
reward themselves and their followers. Since they couldn’t do this by
printing money anymore, they had to use a different way. In both
countries the introduction of central bank independence coincided with a
big expansion in government expenditures, financed largely by
borrowing.</p>
<p>The second approach to engineering prosperity is much more in vogue
nowadays. It recognizes that there are no easy fixes for lifting a
nation from poverty to prosperity overnight or even in the course of a
few decades. Instead, it claims, there are many “micro-market failures”
that can be redressed with good advice, and prosperity will result if
policymakers take advantage of these opportunities—which, again, can be
achieved with the help and vision of economists and others. Small market
failures are everywhere in poor countries, this approach claims—for
example, in their education systems, health care delivery, and the way
their markets are organized. This is undoubtedly true. But the problem
is that these small market failures may be only the tip of the iceberg,
the symptom of deeper-rooted problems in a society functioning under
extractive institutions. Just as it is not a coincidence that poor
countries have bad macroeconomic policies, it is not a coincidence that
their educational systems do not work well. These market failures may
not be due solely to ignorance. The policymakers and bureaucrats who are
supposed to act on well-intentioned advice may be as much a part of the
problem, and the many attempts to rectify these inefficiencies may
backfire precisely because those in charge are not grappling with the
institutional causes of the poverty in the first place.</p>
<p>These problems are illustrated by intervention engineered by the
nongovernmental organization (NGO) Seva Mandir to improve health care
delivery in the state of Rajasthan in India. The story of health care
delivery in India is one of deep-rooted inefficiency and failure.
Government-provided health care is, at least in theory, widely available
and cheap, and the personnel are generally qualified. But even the
poorest Indians do not use government health care facilities, opting
instead for the much more expensive, unregulated, and sometimes even
deficient private providers. This is not because of some type of
irrationality: people are unable to get any care from government
facilities, which are plagued by absenteeism. If an Indian visited his
government-run facility, not only would there be no nurses there, but he
would probably not even be able to get in the building, because health
care facilities are closed most of the time.</p>
<p>In 2006 Seva Mandir, together with a group of economists, designed an
incentive scheme to encourage nurses to turn up for work in the Udaipur
district of Rajasthan. The idea was simple: Seva Mandir introduced time
clocks that would stamp the date and time when nurses were in the
facility. Nurses were supposed to stamp their time cards three times a
day, to ensure that they arrived on time, stayed around, and left on
time. If such a scheme worked, and increased the quality and quantity of
health care provision, it would be a strong illustration of the theory
that there were easy solutions to key problems in development.</p>
<p>In the event, the intervention revealed something very different.
Shortly after the program was implemented, there was a sharp increase in
nurse attendance. But this was very short lived. In a little more than a
year, the local health administration of the district deliberately
undermined the incentive scheme introduced by Seva Mandir. Absenteeism
was back to its usual level, yet there was a sharp increase in “exempt
days,” which meant that nurses were not actually around—but this was
officially sanctioned by the local health administration. There was also
a sharp increase in “machine problems,” as the time clocks were broken.
But Seva Mandir was unable to replace them because local health
ministers would not cooperate.</p>
<p>Forcing nurses to stamp a time clock three times a day doesn’t seem
like such an innovative idea. Indeed, it is a practice used throughout
the industry, even Indian industry, and it must have occurred to health
administrators as a potential solution to their problems. It seems
unlikely, then, that ignorance of such a simple incentive scheme was
what stopped its being used in the first place. What occurred during the
program simply confirmed this. Health administrators sabotaged the
program because they were in cahoots with the nurses and complicit in
the endemic absenteeism problems. They did not want an incentive scheme
forcing nurses to turn up or reducing their pay if they did not.</p>
<p>What this episode illustrates is a micro version of the difficulty of
implementing meaningful changes when institutions are the cause of the
problems in the first place. In this case, it was not corrupt
politicians or powerful businesses undermining institutional reform, but
rather, the local health administration and nurses who were able to
sabotage Seva Mandir’s and the development economists’ incentive scheme.
This suggests that many of the micro-market failures that are apparently
easy to fix may be illusory: the institutional structure that creates
market failures will also prevent implementation of interventions to
improve incentives at the micro level. Attempting to engineer prosperity
without confronting the root cause of the problems—extractive
institutions and the politics that keeps them in place—is unlikely to
bear fruit.</p>
<p>THE FAILURE OF FOREIGN AID</p>
<p>Following the September 11, 2001, attacks by Al Qaeda, U.S.-led
forces swiftly toppled the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan,
which was harboring and refusing to hand over key members of Al Qaeda.
The Bonn Agreement of December 2001 between leaders of the former Afghan
mujahideen who had cooperated with the U.S. forces and key members of
the Afghan diaspora, including Hamid Karzai, created a plan for the
establishment of a democratic regime. A first step was the nationwide
grand assembly, the Loya Jirga, which elected Karzai to lead the interim
government. Things were looking up for Afghanistan. A majority of the
Afghan people were longing to leave the Taliban behind. The
international community thought that all that Afghanistan needed now was
a large infusion of foreign aid. Representatives from the United Nations
and several leading NGOs soon descended on the capital, Kabul.</p>
<p>What ensued should not have been a surprise, especially given the
failure of foreign aid to poor countries and failed states over the past
five decades. Surprise or not, the usual ritual was repeated. Scores of
aid workers and their entourages arrived in town with their own private
jets, NGOs of all sorts poured in to pursue their own agendas, and
high-level talks began between governments and delegations from the
international community. Billions of dollars were now coming to
Afghanistan. But little of it was used for building infrastructure,
schools, or other public services essential for the development of
inclusive institutions or even for restoring law and order. While much
of the infrastructure remained in tatters, the first tranche of the
money was used to commission an airline to shuttle around UN and other
international officials. The next thing they needed were drivers and
interpreters. So they hired the few English-speaking bureaucrats and the
remaining teachers in Afghan schools to chauffeur and chaperone them
around, paying them multiples of current Afghan salaries. As the few
skilled bureaucrats were shunted into jobs servicing the foreign aid
community, the aid flows, rather than building infrastructure in
Afghanistan, started by undermining the Afghan state they were supposed
to build upon and strengthen.</p>
<p>Villagers in a remote district in the central valley of Afghanistan
heard a radio announcement about a new multimillion-dollar program to
restore shelter to their area. After a long while, a few wooden beams,
carried by the trucking cartel of Ismail Khan, famous former warlord and
member of the Afghan government, were delivered. But they were too big
to be used for anything in the district, and the villagers put them to
the only possible use: firewood. So what had happened to the millions of
dollars promised to the villagers? Of the promised money, 20 percent of
it was taken as UN head office costs in Geneva. The remainder was
subcontracted to an NGO, which took another 20 percent for its own head
office costs in Brussels, and so on, for another three layers, with each
party taking approximately another 20 percent of what was remaining. The
little money that reached Afghanistan was used to buy wood from western
Iran, and much of it was paid to Ismail Khan’s trucking cartel to cover
the inflated transport prices. It was a bit of a miracle that those
oversize wooden beams even arrived in the village.</p>
<p>What happened in the central valley of Afghanistan is not an isolated
incident. Many studies estimate that only about 10 or at most 20 percent
of aid ever reaches its target. There are dozens of ongoing fraud
investigations into charges of UN and local officials siphoning off aid
money. But most of the waste resulting from foreign aid is not fraud,
just incompetence or even worse: simply business as usual for aid
organizations.</p>
<p>The Afghan experience with aid was in fact probably a qualified
success compared to others. Throughout the last five decades, hundreds
of billions of dollars have been paid to governments around the world as
“development” aid. Much of it has been wasted in overhead and
corruption, just as in Afghanistan. Worse, a lot of it went to dictators
such as Mobutu, who depended on foreign aid from his Western patrons
both to buy support from his clients to shore up his regime and to
enrich himself. The picture in much of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa
was similar. Humanitarian aid given for temporary relief in times of
crises, for example, most recently in Haiti and Pakistan, has certainly
been more useful, even though its delivery, too, has been marred in
similar problems.</p>
<p>Despite this unflattering track record of “development” aid, foreign
aid is one of the most popular policies that Western governments,
international organizations such as the United Nations, and NGOs of
different ilk recommend as a way of combating poverty around the world.
And of course, the cycle of the failure of foreign aid repeats itself
over and over again. The idea that rich Western countries should provide
large amounts of “developmental aid” in order to solve the problem of
poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Central America, and South
Asia is based on an incorrect understanding of what causes poverty.
Countries such as Afghanistan are poor because of their extractive
institutions—which result in lack of property rights, law and order, or
well-functioning legal systems and the stifling dominance of national
and, more often, local elites over political and economic life. The same
institutional problems mean that foreign aid will be ineffective, as it
will be plundered and is unlikely to be delivered where it is supposed
to go. In the worst-case scenario, it will prop up the regimes that are
at the very root of the problems of these societies. If sustained
economic growth depends on inclusive institutions, giving aid to regimes
presiding over extractive institutions cannot be the solution. This is
not to deny that, even beyond humanitarian aid, considerable good comes
out of specific aid programs that build schools in areas where none
existed before and that pay teachers who would otherwise go unpaid.
While much of the aid community that poured into Kabul did little to
improve life for ordinary Afghans, there have also been notable
successes in building schools, particularly for girls, who were entirely
excluded from education under the Taliban and even before.</p>
<p>One solution—which has recently become more popular, partly based on
the recognition that institutions have something to do with prosperity
and even the delivery of aid—is to make aid “conditional.” According to
this view, continued foreign aid should depend on recipient governments
meeting certain conditions—for example, liberalizing markets or moving
toward democracy. The George W. Bush administration undertook the
biggest step toward this type of conditional aid by starting the
Millennium Challenge Accounts, which made future aid payments dependent
on quantitative improvements in several dimensions of economic and
political development. But the effectiveness of conditional aid appears
no better than the unconditional kind. Countries failing to meet these
conditions typically receive as much aid as those that do. There is a
simple reason: they have a greater need for aid of either the
developmental or humanitarian kind. And quite predictably, conditional
aid seems to have little effect on a nation’s institutions. After all,
it would have been quite surprising for somebody such as Siaka Stevens
in Sierra Leone or Mobutu in the Congo suddenly to start dismantling the
extractive institutions on which he depended just for a little more
foreign aid. Even in sub-Saharan Africa, where foreign aid is a
significant fraction of many governments’ total budget, and even after
the Millennium Challenge Accounts, which increased the extent of
conditionality, the amount of additional foreign aid that a dictator can
obtain by undermining his own power is both small and not worth the risk
either to his continued dominance over the country or to his life.</p>
<p>But all this does not imply that foreign aid, except the humanitarian
kind, should cease. Putting an end to foreign aid is impractical and
would likely lead to additional human suffering. It is impractical
because citizens of many Western nations feel guilt and unease about the
economic and humanitarian disasters around the world, and foreign aid
makes them believe that something is being done to combat the problems.
Even if this something is not very effective, their desire for doing it
will continue, and so will foreign aid. The enormous complex of
international organizations and NGOs will also ceaselessly demand and
mobilize resources to ensure the continuation of the status quo. Also,
it would be callous to cut the aid given to the neediest nations. Yes,
much of it is wasted. But if out of every dollar given to aid, ten cents
makes it to the poorest people in the world, that is ten cents more than
they had before to alleviate the most abject poverty, and it might still
be better than nothing.</p>
<p>There are two important lessons here. First, foreign aid is not a
very effective means of dealing with the failure of nations around the
world today. Far from it. Countries need inclusive economic and
political institutions to break out of the cycle of poverty. Foreign aid
can typically do little in this respect, and certainly not with the way
that it is currently organized. Recognizing the roots of world
inequality and poverty is important precisely so that we do not pin our
hopes on false promises. As those roots lie in institutions, foreign
aid, within the framework of given institutions in recipient nations,
will do little to spur sustained growth. Second, since the development
of inclusive economic and political institutions is key, using the
existing flows of foreign aid at least in part to facilitate such
development would be useful. As we saw, conditionality is not the answer
here, as it requires existing rulers to make concessions. Instead,
perhaps structuring foreign aid so that its use and administration bring
groups and leaders otherwise excluded from power into the
decision-making process and empowering a broad segment of population
might be a better prospect.</p>
<p>EMPOWERMENT</p>
<p>May 12, 1978, seemed as if it were going to be a normal day at the
Scânia truck factory in the city of São Bernardo in the Brazilian state
of São Paulo. But the workers were restless. Strikes had been banned in
Brazil since 1964, when the military overthrew the democratic government
of President João Goulart. But news had just broken that the government
had been fixing the national inflation figures so that the rise in the
cost of living had been underestimated. As the 7:00 a.m. shift began,
workers put down their tools. At 8:00 a.m., Gilson Menezes, a union
organizer working at the plant, called the union. The president of the
São Bernardo Metalworkers was a thirty-three-year-old activist called
Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (“Lula”). By noon Lula was at the factory.
When the company asked him to persuade the employees to go back to work,
he refused.</p>
<p>The Scânia strike was the first in a wave of strikes that swept
across Brazil. On the face of it these were about wages, but as Lula
later noted,</p>
<p>I think we can’t separate economic and political factors.… The …
struggle was over wages, but in struggling for wages, the working class
won a political victory.</p>
<p>The resurgence of the Brazilian labor movement was just part of a
much broader social reaction to a decade and a half of military rule.
The left-wing intellectual Fernando Henrique Cardoso, like Lula destined
to become president of Brazil after the re-creation of democracy, argued
in 1973 that democracy would be created in Brazil by the many social
groups that opposed the military coming together. He said that what was
needed was a “reactivation of civil society … the professional
associations, the trade unions, the churches, the student organizations,
the study groups and the debating circles, the social movements”—in
other words, a broad coalition with the aim of re-creating democracy and
changing Brazilian society.</p>
<p>The Scânia factory heralded the formation of this coalition. By late
1978, Lula was floating the idea of creating a new political party, the
Workers’ Party. This was to be the party not just of trade unionists,
however. Lula insisted that it should be a party for all wage earners
and the poor in general. Here the attempts of union leaders to organize
a political platform began to coalesce with the many social movements
that were springing up. On August 18, 1979, a meeting was held in São
Paulo to discuss the formation of the Workers’ Party, which brought
together former opposition politicians, union leaders, students,
intellectuals, and people representing one hundred diverse social
movements that had begun to organize in the 1970s across Brazil. The
Workers’ Party, launched at the São Judas Tadeo restaurant in São
Bernardo in October 1979, would come to represent all these diverse
groups.</p>
<p>The party quickly began to benefit from the political opening that
the military was reluctantly organizing. In the local elections of 1982,
it ran candidates for the first time, and won two races for mayor.
Throughout the 1980s, as democracy was gradually re-created in Brazil,
the Workers’ Party began to take over more and more local governments.
By 1988 it controlled the governments in thirty-six municipalities,
including large cities such as São Paulo and Porto Alegre. In 1989, in
the first free presidential elections since the military coup, Lula won
16 percent of the vote in the first round as the party’s candidate. In
the runoff race with Fernando Collor, he won 44 percent.</p>
<p>In taking over many local governments, something that accelerated in
the 1990s, the Workers’ Party began to enter into a symbiotic
relationship with many local social movements. In Porto Alegre the first
Workers’ Party administration after 1988 introduced “participatory
budgeting,” which was a mechanism for bringing ordinary citizens into
the formulation of the spending priorities of the city. It created a
system that has become a world model for local government accountability
and responsiveness, and it went along with huge improvements in public
service provision and the quality of life in the city. The successful
governance structure of the party at the local level mapped into greater
political mobilization and success at the national level. Though Lula
was defeated by Fernando Henrique Cardoso in the presidential elections
of 1994 and 1998, he was elected president of Brazil in 2002. The
Workers’ Party has been in power ever since.</p>
<p>The formation of a broad coalition in Brazil as a result of the
coming together of diverse social movements and organized labor has had
a remarkable impact on the Brazilian economy. Since 1990 economic growth
has been rapid, with the proportion of the population in poverty falling
from 45 percent to 30 percent in 2006. Inequality, which rose rapidly
under the military, has fallen sharply, particularly after the Workers’
Party took power, and there has been a huge expansion of education, with
the average years of schooling of the population increasing from six in
1995 to eight in 2006. Brazil has now become part of the BRIC nations
(Brazil, Russia, India, and China), the first Latin American country
actually to have weight in international diplomatic circles.</p>
<p>THE RISE OF BRAZIL since the 1970s was not engineered by economists
of international institutions instructing Brazilian policymakers on how
to design better policies or avoid market failures. It was not achieved
with injections of foreign aid. It was not the natural outcome of
modernization. Rather, it was the consequence of diverse groups of
people courageously building inclusive institutions. Eventually these
led to more inclusive economic institutions. But the Brazilian
transformation, like that of England in the seventeenth century, began
with the creation of inclusive political institutions. But how can
society build inclusive political institutions?</p>
<p>History, as we have seen, is littered with examples of reform
movements that succumbed to the iron law of oligarchy and replaced one
set of extractive institutions with even more pernicious ones. We have
seen that England in 1688, France in 1789, and Japan during the Meiji
Restoration of 1868 started the process of forging inclusive political
institutions with a political revolution. But such political revolutions
generally create much destruction and hardship, and their success is far
from certain. The Bolshevik Revolution advertised its aim as replacing
the exploitative economic system of tsarist Russia with a more just and
efficient one that would bring freedom and prosperity to millions of
Russians. Alas, the outcome was the opposite, and much more repressive
and extractive institutions replaced those of the government the
Bolsheviks overthrew. The experiences in China, Cuba, and Vietnam were
similar. Many noncommunist, top-down reforms fared no better. Nasser
vowed to build a modern egalitarian society in Egypt, but this led only
to Hosni Mubarak’s corrupt regime, as we saw in chapter 13. Robert
Mugabe was viewed by many as a freedom fighter ousting Ian Smith’s
racist and highly extractive Rhodesian regime. But Zimbabwe’s
institutions became no less extractive, and its economic performance has
been even worse than before independence.</p>
<p>What is common among the political revolutions that successfully
paved the way for more inclusive institutions and the gradual
institutional changes in North America, in England in the nineteenth
century, and in Botswana after independence—which also led to
significant strengthening of inclusive political institutions—is that
they succeeded in empowering a fairly broad cross-section of society.
Pluralism, the cornerstone of inclusive political institutions, requires
political power to be widely held in society, and starting from
extractive institutions that vest power in a narrow elite, this requires
a process of empowerment. This, as we emphasized in chapter 7, is what
sets apart the Glorious Revolution from the overthrow of one elite by
another. In the case of the Glorious Revolution, the roots of pluralism
were in the overthrow of James II by a political revolution led by a
broad coalition consisting of merchants, industrialists, the gentry, and
even many members of the English aristocracy not allied with the Crown.
As we have seen, the Glorious Revolution was facilitated by the prior
mobilization and empowerment of a broad coalition, and more important,
it in turn led to the further empowerment of an even broader segment of
society than what came before—even though clearly this segment was much
less broad than the entire society, and England would remain far from a
true democracy for more than another two hundred years. The factors
leading to the emergence of inclusive institutions in the North American
colonies were also similar, as we saw in the first chapter. Once again,
the path starting in Virginia, Carolina, Maryland, and Massachusetts and
leading up to the Declaration of Independence and to the consolidation
of inclusive political institutions in the United States was one of
empowerment for increasingly broader segments in society.</p>
<p>The French Revolution, too, is an example of empowerment of a broader
segment of society, which rose up against the ancien régime in France
and managed to pave the way for a more pluralistic political system. But
the French Revolution, especially the interlude of the Terror under
Robespierre, a repressive and murderous regime, also illustrates how the
process of empowerment is not without its pitfalls. Ultimately, however,
Robespierre and his Jacobin cadres were cast aside, and the most
important inheritance from the French Revolution became not the
guillotine but the far-ranging reforms that the revolution implemented
in France and other parts of Europe.</p>
<p>There are many parallels between these historical processes of
empowerment and what took place in Brazil starting in the 1970s. Though
one root of the Workers’ Party is the trade union movement, right from
its early days, leaders such as Lula, along with the many intellectuals
and opposition politicians who lent their support to the party, sought
to make it into a broad coalition. These impulses began to fuse with
local social movements all over the country, as the party took over
local governments, encouraging civic participation and causing a sort of
revolution in governance throughout the country. In Brazil, in contrast
with England in the seventeenth century or France at the turn of the
eighteenth century, there was no radical revolution igniting the process
of transforming political institutions at one fell swoop. But the
process of empowerment that started in the factories of São Bernardo was
effective in part because it translated into fundamental political
change at the national level—for example, the transitioning out of
military rule to democracy. More important, empowerment at the
grass-roots level in Brazil ensured that the transition to democracy
corresponded to a move toward inclusive political institutions, and thus
was a key factor in the emergence of a government committed to the
provision of public services, educational expansion, and a truly level
playing field. As we have seen, democracy is no guarantee that there
will be pluralism. The contrast of the development of pluralistic
institutions in Brazil to the Venezuelan experience is telling in this
context. Venezuela also transitioned to democracy after 1958, but this
happened without empowerment at the grassroots level and did not create
a pluralistic distribution of political power. Instead, corrupt
politics, patronage networks, and conflict persisted in Venezuela, and
in part as a result, when voters went to the polls, they were even
willing to support potential despots such as Hugo Chávez, most likely
because they thought he alone could stand up to the established elites
of Venezuela. In consequence, Venezuela still languishes under
extractive institutions, while Brazil broke the mold.</p>
<p>WHAT CAN BE DONE to kick-start or perhaps just facilitate the process
of empowerment and thus the development of inclusive political
institutions? The honest answer of course is that there is no recipe for
building such institutions. Naturally there are some obvious factors
that would make the process of empowerment more likely to get off the
ground. These would include the presence of some degree of centralized
order so that social movements challenging existing regimes do not
immediately descend into lawlessness; some preexisting political
institutions that introduce a modicum of pluralism, such as the
traditional political institutions in Botswana, so that broad coalitions
can form and endure; and the presence of civil society institutions that
can coordinate the demands of the population so that opposition
movements can neither be easily crushed by the current elites nor
inevitably turn into a vehicle for another group to take control of
existing extractive institutions. But many of these factors are
historically predetermined and change only slowly. The Brazilian case
illustrates how civil society institutions and associated party
organizations can be built from the ground up, but this process is slow,
and how successful it can be under different circumstances is not well
understood.</p>
<p>One other actor, or set of actors, can play a transformative role in
the process of empowerment: the media. Empowerment of society at large
is difficult to coordinate and maintain without widespread information
about whether there are economic and political abuses by those in power.
We saw in chapter 11 the role of the media in informing the public and
coordinating their demands against forces undermining inclusive
institutions in the United States. The media can also play a key role in
channeling the empowerment of a broad segment of society into more
durable political reforms, again as illustrated in our discussion in
chapter 11, particularly in the context of British democratization.</p>
<p>Pamphlets and books informing and galvanizing people played an
important role during the Glorious Revolution in England, the French
Revolution, and the march toward democracy in nineteenth-century
Britain. Similarly, media, particularly new forms based on advances in
information and communication technology, such as Web blogs, anonymous
chats, Facebook, and Twitter, played a central role in Iranian
opposition against Ahmadinejad’s fraudulent election in 2009 and
subsequent repression, and they seem to be playing a similarly central
role in the Arab Spring protests that are ongoing as this manuscript is
being completed.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes are often aware of the importance of a free
media, and do their best to fight it. An extreme illustration of this
comes from Alberto Fujimori’s rule in Peru. Though originally
democratically elected, Fujimori soon set up a dictatorial regime in
Peru, mounting a coup while still in office in 1992. Thereafter, though
elections continued, Fujimori built a corrupt regime and ruled through
repression and bribery. In this he relied heavily on his right-hand man,
Valdimiro Montesinos, who headed the powerful national intelligence
service of Peru. Montesinos was an organized man, so he kept good
records of how much the administration paid different individuals to buy
their loyalty, even videotaping many actual acts of bribery. There was a
logic to this. Beyond just recordkeeping, this evidence made sure that
the accomplices were now on record and would be considered as guilty as
Fujimori and Montesinos. After the fall of the regime, these records
fell into the hands of journalists and authorities. The amounts are
revealing about the value of the media to a dictatorship. A Supreme
Court judge was worth between ,000 and 0,000 a month, and politicians in
the same or different parties were paid similar amounts. But when it
came to newspapers and TV stations, the sums were in the millions.
Fujimori and Montesinos paid million on one occasion and more than 0
million on another to control TV stations. They paid more than million
to a mainstream newspaper, and to other newspapers they paid any amount
between ,000 and ,000 per headline. Fujimori and Montesinos thought that
controlling the media was much more important than controlling
politicians and judges. One of Montesinos’s henchmen, General Bello,
summed this up in one of the videos by stating, “If we do not control
the television we do not do anything.”</p>
<p>The current extractive institutions in China are also crucially
dependent on Chinese authorities’ control of the media, which, as we
have seen, has become frighteningly sophisticated. As a Chinese
commentator summarized, “To uphold the leadership of the Party in
political reform, three principles must be followed: that the Party
controls the armed forces; the Party controls cadres; and the Party
controls the news.”</p>
<p>But of course a free media and new communication technologies can
help only at the margins, by providing information and coordinating the
demands and actions of those vying for more inclusive institutions.
Their help will translate into meaningful change only when a broad
segment of society mobilizes and organizes in order to effect political
change, and does so not for sectarian reasons or to take control of
extractive institutions, but to transform extractive institutions into
more inclusive ones. Whether such a process will get under way and open
the door to further empowerment, and ultimately to durable political
reform, will depend, as we have seen in many different instances, on the
history of economic and political institutions, on many small
differences that matter and on the very contingent path of history.</p>
