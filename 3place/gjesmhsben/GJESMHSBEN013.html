<h4 id="the-virtuous-circle">11. THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE</h4>
<p>THE BLACK ACT</p>
<p>WINDSOR CASTLE, located just west of London, is one of the great
royal residencies of England. In the early eighteenth century, the
castle was surrounded by a great forest, full of deer, though little of
this remains today. One of the keepers of the forest in 1722, Baptist
Nunn, was locked in to a violent conflict. On June 27 he recorded,</p>
<p>Blacks came in the night shot at me 3 times 2 bullets into my chamber
window and [I] agreed to pay them 5 guineas at Crowthorne on the
30th.</p>
<p>Another entry in Nunn’s diary read, “A fresh surprise. One appeared
disguised with a message of destruction.”</p>
<p>Who were these mysterious “Blacks” making threats, shooting at Nunn,
and demanding money? The Blacks were groups of local men who had their
faces “blacked” to conceal their appearance at night. They appeared
widely across southern England in this period, killing and maiming deer
and other animals, burning down haystacks and barns, and destroying
fences and fish ponds. On the surface it was sheer lawlessness, but it
wasn’t. Illegal hunting (poaching) deer in lands owned by the king or
other members of the aristocracy had been going on for a long time. In
the 1640s, during the Civil War, the entire population of deer at
Windsor Castle was killed. After the Restoration in 1660, when Charles
II came to the throne, the deer park was restocked. But the Blacks were
not just poaching deer to eat; they also engaged in wanton destruction.
To what end?</p>
<p>A crucial building block of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was the
pluralistic nature of interests represented in Parliament. None of the
merchants, industrialists, gentry, or aristocracy allied with William of
Orange and then with the Hanoverian monarchs, who succeeded Queen Anne
in 1714, were strong enough to impose their will unilaterally.</p>
<p>Attempts at restoring the Stuart monarchy continued throughout much
of the eighteenth century. After James II’s death in 1701, his son,
James Francis Edward Stuart, the “Old Pretender,” was recognized as the
lawful heir to the English Crown by France, Spain, the pope, and
supporters of the Stuart monarchy in England and Scotland, the so-called
Jacobites. In 1708 the Old Pretender attempted to take back the throne
with support of French troops, but was unsuccessful. In the ensuing
decades there would be several Jacobite revolts, including major ones in
1715 and 1719. In 1745–46, the Old Pretender’s son, Charles Edward
Stuart, the “Young Pretender,” made an attempt to take back the throne,
but his forces were defeated by the British army.</p>
<p>The Whig political party, which as we saw (this page–this page) was
founded in the 1670s to represent the new mercantile and economic
interests, was the main organization behind the Glorious Revolution, and
the Whigs dominated Parliament from 1714 to 1760. Once in power, they
were tempted to use their newly found position to prey on the rights of
others, to have their cake and eat it, too. They were no different from
the Stuart kings, but their power was far from absolute. It was
constrained both by competing groups in Parliament, particularly the
Tory Party which had formed to oppose the Whigs, and by the very
institutions that they had fought to introduce to strengthen Parliament
and to prevent the emergence of a new absolutism and the return of the
Stuarts. The pluralistic nature of society that emerged from the
Glorious Revolution also meant that the population at large, even those
without formal representation in Parliament, had been empowered, and
“blacking” was precisely a response by the common people to perceptions
that the Whigs were exploiting their position.</p>
<p>The case of William Cadogan, a successful general in the War of the
Spanish Succession between 1701 and 1714 and in the suppression of the
Jacobite revolts, illustrates the sort of encroachment of common
people’s rights by the Whigs that led to blacking. George I made Cadogan
a baron in 1716 and then an earl in 1718. He was also an influential
member of the Regency Council of Lords Justices, which presided over
major affairs of state, and he served as the acting commander in chief.
He bought a large property of about a thousand acres at Caversham, about
twenty miles west of Windsor. There he built a grand house and ornate
gardens and laid out a 240-acre deer park. Yet this property was
consolidated by encroaching on the rights of those around the estate.
People were evicted, and their traditional rights to graze animals and
collect peat and firewood were abrogated. Cadogan faced the wrath of the
Blacks. On January 1, 1722, and again in July, the park was raided by
mounted and armed Blacks. The first attack killed sixteen deer. Earl
Cadogan was not alone. The estates of many notable landowners and
politicians were also raided by the Blacks.</p>
<p>The Whig government was not going to take this lying down. In May
1723, Parliament passed the Black Act, which created an extraordinary
fifty new offenses that were punishable by hanging. The Black Act made
it a crime not only to carry weapons but to have a blackened face. The
law in fact was soon amended to make blacking punishable by hanging. The
Whig elites went about implementing the law with gusto. Baptist Nunn set
up a network of informers in Windsor Forest to discover the identity of
the Blacks. Soon several were arrested. The transition from arrest to
hanging ought to have been a straightforward affair. After all, the
Black Act had already been enacted, the Whigs were in charge of
Parliament, Parliament was in charge of the country, and the Blacks were
acting directly contrary to the interests of some powerful Whigs. Even
Sir Robert Walpole, secretary of state, then prime minister—and like
Cadogan, another influential member of the Regency Council of the Lords
Justices—was involved. He had a vested interest in Richmond Park in
southwest London, which had been created out of common land by Charles
I. This park also encroached upon the traditional rights of local
residents to graze their animals, hunt hares and rabbits, and collect
firewood. But the ending of these rights appears to have been rather
laxly enforced, and grazing and hunting continued, until Walpole
arranged for his son to become the park ranger. At this time, the park
was closed off, a new wall was constructed, and man traps were
installed. Walpole liked hunting deer, and he had a lodge built for
himself at Houghton, within the park. The animosity of local Blacks was
soon ignited.</p>
<p>On November 10, 1724, a local resident outside the park, John
Huntridge, was accused of aiding deer stealers and abetting known
Blacks, both crimes punishable by hanging. The prosecution of Huntridge
came right from the top, initiated by the Regency Council of Lords
Justices, which Walpole and Cadogan dominated. Walpole went so far as to
extract evidence himself as to Huntridge’s guilt from an informant,
Richard Blackburn. Conviction ought to have been a foregone conclusion,
but it wasn’t. After a trial of eight or nine hours, the jury found
Huntridge innocent, partly on procedural grounds, since there were
irregularities with the way the evidence had been collected.</p>
<p>Not all Blacks or those who sympathized with them were as lucky as
Huntridge. Though some others were also acquitted or had their
convictions commuted, many were hanged or transported to the penal
colony of choice at the time, North America; the law in fact stayed on
the statute books until it was repealed in 1824. Yet Huntridge’s victory
is remarkable. The jury was made up not of Huntridge’s peers, but of
major landowners and gentry, who ought to have sympathized with Walpole.
But this was no longer the seventeenth century, where the Court of Star
Chamber would simply follow the wishes of Stuart monarchs and act as an
open tool of repression against their opponents, and where kings could
remove judges whose decisions they did not like. Now the Whigs also had
to abide by the rule of law, the principle that laws should not be
applied selectively or arbitrarily and that nobody is above the law.</p>
<p>THE EVENTS SURROUNDING the Black Act would show that the Glorious
Revolution had created the rule of law, and that this notion was
stronger in England and Britain, and the elites were far more
constrained by it than they themselves imagined. Notably, the rule of
law is not the same as rule by law. Even if the Whigs could pass a
harsh, repressive law to quash obstacles from common people, they had to
contend with additional constraints because of the rule of law. Their
law violated the rights that the Glorious Revolution and the changes in
political institutions that followed from it had already established for
everybody by tearing down the “divine” rights of kings and the
privileges of elites. The rule of law then implied that both elites and
nonelites alike would resist its implementation.</p>
<p>The rule of law is a very strange concept when you think about it in
historical perspective. Why should laws be applied equally to all? If
the king and the aristocracy have political power and the rest don’t,
it’s only natural that whatever is fair game for the king and the
aristocracy should be banned and punishable for the rest. Indeed, the
rule of law is not imaginable under absolutist political institutions.
It is a creation of pluralist political institutions and of the broad
coalitions that support such pluralism. It’s only when many individuals
and groups have a say in decisions, and the political power to have a
seat at the table, that the idea that they should all be treated fairly
starts making sense. By the early eighteenth century, Britain was
becoming sufficiently pluralistic, and the Whig elites would discover
that, as enshrined in the notion of the rule of law, laws and
institutions would constrain them, too.</p>
<p>But why did the Whigs and parliamentarians abide by such restraints?
Why didn’t they use their control over Parliament and the state to force
an uncompromising implementation of the Black Act and overturn the
courts when the decisions didn’t go their way? The answer reveals much
about the nature of the Glorious Revolution—why it didn’t just replace
an old absolutism with a new version—the link between pluralism and the
rule of law, and the dynamics of virtuous circles. As we saw in chapter
7, the Glorious Revolution was not the overthrow of one elite by
another, but a revolution against absolutism by a broad coalition made
up of the gentry, merchants, and manufacturers as well as groupings of
Whigs and Tories. The emergence of pluralist political institutions was
a consequence of this revolution. The rule of law also emerged as a
by-product of this process. With many parties at the table sharing
power, it was natural to have laws and constraints apply to all of them,
lest one party start amassing too much power and ultimately undermine
the very foundations of pluralism. Thus the notion that there were
limits and restraints on rulers, the essence of the rule of law, was
part of the logic of pluralism engendered by the broad coalition that
made up the opposition to Stuart absolutism.</p>
<p>In this light, it should be no surprise that the principle of the
rule of law, coupled with the notion that monarchs did not have divine
rights, was in fact a key argument against Stuart absolutism. As the
British historian E. P. Thompson put it, in the struggle against the
Stuart monarchs:</p>
<p>immense efforts were made … to project the image of a ruling class
which was itself subject to the rule of law, and whose legitimacy rested
upon the equity and universality of those legal forms. And the rulers
were, in serious senses, whether willingly or unwillingly, the prisoners
of their own rhetoric; they played games of power according to rules
which suited them, but they could not break those rules or the whole
game would be thrown away.</p>
<p>Throwing the game away would destabilize the system and open the way
for absolutism by a subset of the broad coalition or even risk the
return of the Stuarts. In Thompson’s words, what inhibited Parliament
from creating a new absolutism was that</p>
<p>ake away law, and the royal prerogative … might flood back upon their
properties and lives.</p>
<p>Moreover,</p>
<p>it was inherent in the very nature of the medium which they [those
aristocrats, merchants etc. fighting the Crown] had selected for their
own self-defense that it could not be reserved for the exclusive use
only of their own class. The law, in its forms and traditions, entailed
principles of equity and universality which … had to be extended to all
sorts and degrees of men.</p>
<p>Once in place, the notion of the rule of law not only kept absolutism
at bay but also created a type of virtuous circle: if the laws applied
equally to everybody, then no individual or group, not even Cadogan or
Walpole, could rise above the law, and common people accused of
encroaching on private property still had the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>WE SAW HOW INCLUSIVE economic and political institutions emerge. But
why do they persist over time? The history of the Black Act and the
limits to its implementation illustrate the virtuous circle, a powerful
process of positive feedback that preserves these institutions in the
face of attempts at undermining them and, in fact, sets in motion forces
that lead to greater inclusiveness. The logic of virtuous circles stems
partly from the fact that inclusive institutions are based on
constraints on the exercise of power and on a pluralistic distribution
of political power in society, enshrined in the rule of law. The ability
of a subset to impose its will on others without any constraints, even
if those others are ordinary citizens, as Huntridge was, threatens this
very balance. If it were temporarily suspended in the case of the
peasants protesting against elites encroaching on their communal lands,
what was there to guarantee that it would not be suspended again? And
the next time it was suspended, what would prevent the Crown and
aristocracy from taking back what the merchants, businessmen, and the
gentry had gained in the intervening half century? In fact, the next
time it was suspended, perhaps the entire project of pluralism would
come crumbling down, because a narrow set of interests would take
control at the expense of the broad coalition. The political system
would not risk this. But this made pluralism, and the rule of law that
it implied, persistent features of British political institutions. And
we will see that once pluralism and the rule of law were established,
there would be demand for even greater pluralism and greater
participation in the political process.</p>
<p>The virtuous circle arises not only from the inherent logic of
pluralism and the rule of law, but also because inclusive political
institutions tend to support inclusive economic institutions. This then
leads to a more equal distribution of income, empowering a broad segment
of society and making the political playing field even more level. This
limits what one can achieve by usurping political power and reduces the
incentives to re-create extractive political institutions. These factors
were important in the emergence of truly democratic political
institutions in Britain.</p>
<p>Pluralism also creates a more open system and allows independent
media to flourish, making it easier for groups that have an interest in
the continuation of inclusive institutions to become aware and organize
against threats to these institutions. It is highly significant that the
English state stopped censoring the media after 1688. The media played a
similarly important role in empowering the population at large and in
the continuation of the virtuous circle of institutional development in
the United States, as we will see in this chapter.</p>
<p>While the virtuous circle creates a tendency for inclusive
institutions to persist, it is neither inevitable nor irreversible. Both
in Britain and the United States, inclusive economic and political
institutions were subject to many challenges. In 1745 the Young
Pretender got all the way to Derby, a mere hundred miles from London,
with an army to unseat the political institutions forged during the
Glorious Revolution. But he was defeated. More important than the
challenges from without were potential challenges from within that might
also have led to the unraveling of inclusive institutions. As we saw in
the context of the Peterloo Massacre in Manchester in 1819 (this page),
and as we will see in more detail next, British political elites thought
of using repression to avoid having to further open the political
system, but they pulled back from the brink. Similarly, inclusive
economic and political institutions in the United States faced serious
challenges, which could have conceivably succeeded, but didn’t. And of
course it was not preordained that these challenges should be defeated.
It is due to not only the virtuous circle but also to the realization of
the contingent path of history that British and U.S. inclusive
institutions survived and became substantially stronger over time.</p>
<p>THE SLOW MARCH OF DEMOCRACY</p>
<p>The response to the Black Act showed ordinary British people that
they had more rights than they previously realized. They could defend
their traditional rights and economic interests in the courts and in
Parliament through the use of petitions and lobbying. But this pluralism
had not yet delivered effective democracy. Most adult men could not
vote; neither could women; and there were many inequities in the
existing democratic structures. All this was to change. The virtuous
circle of inclusive institutions not only preserves what has already
been achieved but also opens the door to greater inclusiveness. The odds
were against the British elite of the eighteenth century maintaining
their grip on political power without serious challenges. This elite had
come to power by challenging the divine right of kings and opening the
door to participation by the people in politics, but then they gave this
right only to a small minority. It was only a matter of time until more
and more of the population demanded the right to participate in the
political process. And in the years leading up to 1831, they did.</p>
<p>The first three decades of the nineteenth century witnessed
increasing social unrest in Britain, mostly in response to increasing
economic inequities and demands from the disenfranchised masses for
greater political representation. The Luddite Riots of 1811–1816, where
workers fought against the introduction of new technologies they
believed would reduce their wages, were followed by riots explicitly
demanding political rights, the Spa Fields Riots of 1816 in London and
the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 in Manchester. In the Swing Riots of 1830,
agricultural workers protested against falling living standards as well
as the introduction of new technology. Meanwhile, in Paris, the July
Revolution of 1830 exploded. A consensus among elites was starting to
form that the discontent was reaching the boiling point, and the only
way to defuse social unrest, and turn back a revolution, was by meeting
the demands of the masses and undertaking parliamentary reform.</p>
<p>It was no surprise then that the 1831 election was mostly about a
single issue: political reform. The Whigs, almost one hundred years
after Sir Robert Walpole, were much more responsive to the wishes of the
common man and campaigned to extend voting rights. But this meant only a
small increase in the electorate. Universal suffrage, even only for men,
was not on the table. The Whigs won the election, and their leader, Earl
Grey, became the prime minister. Earl Grey was no radical—far from it.
He and the Whigs pushed for reform not because they thought a broader
voting franchise was more just or because they wanted to share power.
British democracy was not given by the elite. It was largely taken by
the masses, who were empowered by the political processes that had been
ongoing in England and the rest of Britain for the last several
centuries. They had become emboldened by the changes in the nature of
political institutions unleashed by the Glorious Revolution. Reforms
were granted because the elite thought that reform was the only way to
secure the continuation of their rule, albeit in a somewhat lessened
form. Earl Grey, in his famous speech to Parliament in favor of
political reform, said this very clearly:</p>
<p>There is no-one more decided against annual Parliaments, universal
suffrage and the ballot, than I am. My object is not to favour, but to
put an end to such hopes and projects … The principle of my reform is,
to prevent the necessity of revolution … reforming to preserve and not
to overthrow.</p>
<p>The masses did not just want the vote for its own sake but to have a
seat at the table to be able to defend their interests. This was well
understood by the Chartist movement, which led the campaign for
universal suffrage after 1838, taking its name from its adoption of the
People’s Charter, named to evoke a parallel with the Magna Carta.
Chartist J. R. Stephens articulated why universal suffrage, and the vote
for all citizens, was key for the masses:</p>
<p>The question of universal suffrage … is a knife and fork question, a
bread and cheese question … by universal suffrage I mean to say that
every working man in the land has a right to a good coat on his back, a
good hat on his head, a good roof for the shelter of his household, a
good dinner upon his table.</p>
<p>Stephens had well understood that universal suffrage was the most
durable way of empowering the British masses further and guaranteeing a
coat, a hat, a roof, and a good dinner for the working man.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Earl Grey was successful both in ensuring the passage of
the First Reform Act and in defusing the revolutionary tides without
taking any major strides toward universal mass suffrage. The 1832
reforms were modest, only doubling the voting franchise from 8 percent
to about 16 percent of the adult male population (from about 2 to 4
percent of all the population). They also got rid of rotten boroughs and
gave independent representation to the new industrializing cities such
as Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield. But this still left many issues
unresolved. Hence there were soon further demands for greater voting
rights and further social unrest. In response, further reform would
follow.</p>
<p>Why did the British elites give in to the demands? Why did Earl Grey
feel that partial—indeed, very partial—reform was the only way to
preserve the system? Why did they have to put up with the lesser of the
two evils, reform or revolution, rather than maintaining their power
without any reform? Couldn’t they just have done what the Spanish
conquistadors did in South America, what Austria-Hungarian and Russian
monarchs would do in the next several decades when the demands for
reform reached those lands, and what the British themselves did in the
Caribbean and in India: use force to put down the demands? The answer to
this question comes from the virtuous circle. The economic and political
changes that had already taken place in Britain made using force to
repress these demands both unattractive for the elite and increasingly
infeasible. As E. P. Thompson wrote:</p>
<p>When the struggles of 1790–1832 signalled that this equilibrium had
changed, the rulers of England were faced with alarming alternatives.
They could either dispense with the rule of law, dismantle their
elaborate constitutional structures, countermand their own rhetoric and
rule by force; or they could submit to their own rules and surrender
their hegemony … they took halting steps in the first direction. But in
the end, rather than shatter their own self-image and repudiate 150
years of constitutional legality, they surrendered to the law.</p>
<p>Put differently, the same forces that made the British elite not wish
to tear down the edifice of the rule of law during the Black Act also
made them shun repression and rule by force, which would again risk the
stability of the entire system. If undermining the law in trying to
implement the Black Act would have weakened the system that merchants,
businessmen, and the gentry had built in the Glorious Revolution,
setting up a repressive dictatorship in 1832 would have entirely
undermined it. In fact, the organizers of the protests for parliamentary
reform were well aware of the importance of the rule of law and its
symbolism to the British political institutions during this period. They
used its rhetoric to bring home this point. One of the first
organizations seeking parliamentary reform was called the Hampden Club,
after the member of Parliament who had first resisted Charles I over the
ship money tax, a crucial event leading up to the first major uprising
against Stuart absolutism, as we saw in chapter 7.</p>
<p>There was also dynamic positive feedback between inclusive economic
and political institutions making such a course of action attractive.
Inclusive economic institutions led to the development of inclusive
markets, inducing a more efficient allocation of resources, greater
encouragement to acquire education and skills, and further innovations
in technology. All of these forces were in play in Britain by 1831.
Clamping down on popular demands and undertaking a coup against
inclusive political institutions would also destroy these gains, and the
elites opposing greater democratization and greater inclusiveness might
find themselves among those losing their fortunes from this
destruction.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this positive feedback is that under inclusive
economic and political institutions, controlling power became less
central. In Austria-Hungary and in Russia, as we saw in chapter 8, the
monarchs and the aristocracy had much to lose from industrialization and
reform. In contrast, in Britain at the beginning of the nineteenth
century, thanks to the development of inclusive economic institutions,
there was much less at stake: there were no serfs, relatively little
coercion in the labor market, and few monopolies protected by entry
barriers. Clinging to power was thus much less valuable for the British
elite.</p>
<p>The logic of the virtuous circle also meant that such repressive
steps would be increasingly infeasible, again because of the positive
feedback between inclusive economic and political institutions.
Inclusive economic institutions lead to a more equitable distribution of
resources than extractive institutions. As such, they empower the
citizens at large and thus create a more level playing field, even when
it comes to the fight for power. This makes it more difficult for a
small elite to crush the masses rather than to give in to their demands,
or at least to some of them. The British inclusive institutions had also
already unleashed the Industrial Revolution, and Britain was highly
urbanized. Using repression against an urban, concentrated, and
partially organized and empowered group of people would have been much
harder than repressing a peasantry or dependent serfs.</p>
<p>The virtuous circle thus brought the First Reform Act to Britain in
1832. But this was just the beginning. There was still a long road to
travel toward real democracy, because in 1832 the elite had only offered
what they thought they had to and no more. The issue of parliamentary
reform was taken up by the Chartist movement, whose People’s Charter of
1838 included the clauses</p>
<p>A vote for every man twenty-one years of age, of sound mind, and not
undergoing punishment for crime.</p>
<p>The ballot.—To protect the elector in the exercise of his vote.</p>
<p>No property qualification for members of Parliament—thus enabling the
constituencies to return the man of their choice, be he rich or
poor.</p>
<p>Payment of members, thus enabling an honest tradesman, working man,
or other person, to serve a constituency, when taken from his business
to attend to the interests of the Country.</p>
<p>Equal Constituencies, securing the same amount of representation for
the same number of electors, instead of allowing small constituencies to
swamp the votes of large ones.</p>
<p>Annual Parliaments, thus presenting the most effectual check to
bribery and intimidation, since though a constituency might be bought
once in seven years (even with the ballot), no purse could buy a
constituency (under a system of universal suffrage) in each ensuing
twelve-month; and since members, when elected for a year only, would not
be able to defy and betray their constituents as now.</p>
<p>By the “ballot,” they meant the secret ballot and the end of open
voting, which had facilitated the buying of votes and the coercion of
voters.</p>
<p>The Chartist movement organized a series of mass demonstrations, and
throughout this period Parliament continually discussed the potential
for further reforms. Though the Chartists disintegrated after 1848, they
were followed by the National Reform Union, founded in 1864, and the
Reform League, which was founded in 1865. In July 1866, major pro-reform
riots in Hyde Park brought reform right to the top of the political
agenda once more. This pressure bore dividends in the form of the Second
Reform Act of 1867, in which the total electorate was doubled and
working-class voters became the majority in all urban constituencies.
Shortly afterward the secret ballot was introduced and moves were made
to eliminate corrupt electoral practices such as “treating” (essentially
buying votes in exchange for which the voter received a treat, usually
money, food, or alcohol). The electorate was doubled again by the Third
Reform Act of 1884, when 60 percent of adult males were enfranchised.
Following the First World War, the Representation of the People Act of
1918 gave the vote to all adult males over the age of twenty-one, and to
women over the age of thirty who were taxpayers or married to taxpayers.
Ultimately, all women also received the vote on the same terms as men in
1928. The measures of 1918 were negotiated during the war and reflected
a quid pro quo between the government and the working classes, who were
needed to fight and produce munitions. The government may also have
taken note of the radicalism of the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>Parallel with the gradual development of more inclusive political
institutions was a movement toward even more inclusive economic
institutions. One major consequence of the First Reform Act was the
repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. As we saw in chapter 7, the Corn Laws
banned the import of grains and cereals, keeping their prices high and
ensuring lucrative profits for large landowners. The new
parliamentarians from Manchester and Birmingham wanted cheap corn and
low wages. They won, and the landed interests suffered a major
defeat.</p>
<p>The changes in the electorate and other dimensions of political
institutions taking place during the course of the nineteenth century
were followed by further reforms. In 1871 the Liberal prime minister
Gladstone opened up the civil service to public examination, making it
meritocratic, and thus continuing the process of political
centralization and the building of state institutions that started
during the Tudor period. Liberal and Tory governments during this period
introduced a considerable amount of labor market legislation. For
example, the Masters and Servants Acts, which allowed employers to use
the law to reduce the mobility of their workers, was repealed, changing
the nature of labor relations in favor of workers. During 1906–1914, the
Liberal Party, under the leadership of H. H. Asquith and David Lloyd
George, began to use the state to provide far more public services,
including health and unemployment insurance, government-financed
pensions, minimum wages, and a commitment to redistributive taxation. As
a result of these fiscal changes, taxes as a proportion of national
product more than doubled in the last three decades of the nineteenth
century, and then doubled again in the first three decades of the
twentieth. The tax system also became more “progressive,” so that
wealthier people bore a heavier burden.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the education system, which was previously either
primarily for the elite, run by religious denominations, or required
poor people to pay fees, was made more accessible to the masses; the
Education Act of 1870 committed the government to the systematic
provision of universal education for the first time. Education became
free of charge in 1891. The school-leaving age was set at eleven in
1893. In 1899 it was increased to twelve, and special provisions for the
children of needy families were introduced. As a result of these
changes, the proportion of ten-year-olds enrolled in school, which stood
at a disappointing 40 percent in 1870, increased to 100 percent in 1900.
Finally, the Education Act of 1902 led to a large expansion in resources
for schools and introduced the grammar schools, which subsequently
became the foundation of secondary education in Britain.</p>
<p>In fact, the British example, an illustration of the virtuous circle
of inclusive institutions, provides an example of a “gradual virtuous
circle.” The political changes were unmistakably toward more inclusive
political institutions and were the result of demands from empowered
masses. But they were also gradual. Every decade another step, sometimes
smaller, sometimes larger, was taken toward democracy. There was
conflict over each step, and the outcome of each was contingent. But the
virtuous circle created forces that reduced the stakes involved in
clinging to power. It also spurred the rule of law, making it harder to
use force against those who were demanding what these elites had
themselves demanded from Stuart monarchs. It became less likely that
this conflict would turn into an all-out revolution and more likely that
it would be resolved in favor of greater inclusiveness. There is great
virtue in this sort of gradual change. It is less threatening to the
elite than the wholesale overthrow of the system. Each step is small,
and it makes sense to give in to a small demand rather than create a
major showdown. This partly explains how the Corn Law was repealed
without more serious conflict. By 1846 landowners could no longer
control legislation in Parliament. This was an outcome of the First
Reform Act. However, if in 1832 the expansion of the electorate, the
reform of the rotten boroughs, and the repeal of the Corn Laws had all
been on the table, landowners would have put up much more resistance.
The fact that there were first limited political reforms and that repeal
of the Corn Laws came on the agenda only later defused conflict.</p>
<p>Gradual change also prevented ventures into uncharted territories. A
violent overthrow of the system means that something entirely new has to
be built in place of what has been removed. This was the case with the
French Revolution, when the first experiment with democracy led to the
Terror and then back to a monarchy twice before finally leading to the
French Third Republic in 1870. It was the case in the Russian
Revolution, where the desires of many for a more equal system than that
of the Russian Empire led to a one-party dictatorship that was much more
violent, bloody, and vicious than what it had replaced. Gradual reform
was difficult in these societies precisely because they lacked pluralism
and were highly extractive. It was the pluralism emerging from the
Glorious Revolution, and the rule of law that it introduced, that made
gradual change feasible, and desirable, in Britain.</p>
<p>The conservative English commentator Edmund Burke, who steadfastly
opposed the French Revolution, wrote in 1790, “It is with infinite
caution that any man should venture upon pulling down an edifice, which
has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of
society, or on building it up again without having models and patterns
of approved utility before his eyes.” Burke was wrong on the big
picture. The French Revolution had replaced a rotten edifice and opened
the way for inclusive institutions not only in France, but throughout
much of Western Europe. But Burke’s caution was not entirely off the
mark. The gradual process of British political reform, which had started
in 1688 and would pick up pace three decades after Burke’s death, would
be more effective because its gradual nature made it more powerful,
harder to resist, and ultimately more durable.</p>
<p>BUSTING TRUSTS</p>
<p>Inclusive institutions in the United States had their roots in the
struggles in Virginia, Maryland, and the Carolinas during the colonial
period (this page–this page). These institutions were reinforced by the
Constitution of the United States, with its system of constraints and
its separation of powers. But the Constitution did not mark the end of
the development of inclusive institutions. Just as in Britain, these
were strengthened by a process of positive feedback, based on the
virtuous circle.</p>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, all white males, though not
women or blacks, could vote in the United States. Economic institutions
became more inclusive—for example, with the passage of the Homestead Act
in 1862 (this page), which made frontier land available to potential
settlers rather than allocating these lands to political elites. But
just as in Britain, challenges to inclusive institutions were never
entirely absent. The end of the U.S. Civil War initiated a rapid spurt
of economic growth in the North. As railways, industry, and commerce
expanded, a few people made vast fortunes. Emboldened by their economic
success, these men and their companies became increasingly unscrupulous.
They were called the Robber Barons because of their hard-nosed business
practices aimed at consolidating monopolies and preventing any potential
competitor from entering the market or doing business on an equal
footing. One of the most notorious of these was Cornelius Vanderbilt,
who famously remarked, “What do I care about the Law? Hain’t I got the
power?”</p>
<p>Another was John D. Rockefeller, who started the Standard Oil Company
in 1870. He quickly eliminated rivals in Cleveland and attempted to
monopolize the transportation and retailing of oil and oil products. By
1882 he had created a massive monopoly—in the language of the day, a
trust. By 1890 Standard Oil controlled 88 percent of the refined oil
flows in the United States, and Rockefeller became the world’s first
billionaire in 1916. Contemporary cartoons depict Standard Oil as an
octopus wrapping itself around not just the oil industry but also
Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Almost as infamous was John Pierpont Morgan, the founder of the
modern banking conglomerate J.P. Morgan, which later, after many mergers
over decades, eventually became JPMorgan Chase. Along with Andrew
Carnegie, Morgan founded the U.S. Steel Company in 1901, the first
corporation with a capitalized value of more than billion and by far the
largest steel corporation in the world. In the 1890s, large trusts began
to emerge in nearly every sector of the economy, and many of them
controlled more than 70 percent of the market in their sector. These
included several household names, such as Du Pont, Eastman Kodak, and
International Harvester. Historically the United States, at least the
northern and midwestern United States, had relatively competitive
markets and had been more egalitarian than other parts of the country,
particularly the South. But during this period, competition gave way to
monopoly, and wealth inequality rapidly increased.</p>
<p>The pluralistic U.S. political system already empowered a broad
segment of society that could stand up against such encroachments. Those
who were the victims of the monopolistic practices of the Robber Barons,
or who objected to their unscrupulous domination of their industries,
began to organize against them. They formed the Populist and then
subsequently the Progressive movements.</p>
<p>The Populist movement emerged out of a long-running agrarian crisis,
which afflicted the Midwest from the late 1860s onward. The National
Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, known as the Grangers, was
founded in 1867 and began to mobilize farmers against unfair and
discriminatory business practices. In 1873 and 1874, the Grangers won
control of eleven midwestern state legislatures, and rural discontent
culminated in the formation of the People’s Party in 1892, which got 8.5
percent of the popular vote in the 1892 presidential election. In the
next two elections, the Populists fell in behind the two unsuccessful
Democratic campaigns by William Jennings Bryan, who made many of their
issues his own. Grass-roots opposition to the spread of the trusts had
now organized to try to counteract the influence that Rockefeller and
other Robber Barons were exerting over national politics.</p>
<p>These political movements slowly began to have an impact on political
attitudes and then on legislation, particularly concerning the role of
the state in the regulation of monopoly. The first important piece of
legislation was the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which created the
Interstate Commerce Commission and initiated the development of the
federal regulation of industry. This was quickly followed by the Sherman
Antitrust Act of 1890. The Sherman Act, which is still a major part of
U.S. antitrust regulation, would become the basis for attacks on the
Robber Barons’ trusts. Major action against the trusts came after the
election of presidents committed to reform and to limiting the power of
the Robber Barons: Theodore Roosevelt, 1901–1909; William Taft,
1909–1913; and Woodrow Wilson, 1913–1921.</p>
<p>A key political force behind antitrust and the move to impose federal
regulation of industry was again the farm vote. Early attempts by
individual states in the 1870s to regulate railroads came from farmers’
organizations. Indeed, nearly all the fifty-nine petitions that
concerned trusts sent to Congress prior to the enactment of the Sherman
Act came from farming states and emanated from organizations such as the
Farmers’ Union, Farmers’ Alliance, Farmers’ Mutual Benefit Association,
and Patrons of Animal Husbandry. Farmers found a collective interest in
opposing the monopolistic practices of industry.</p>
<p>From the ashes of the Populists, who seriously declined after
throwing their weight behind the Democrats, came the Progressives, a
heterogeneous reform movement concerned with many of the same issues.
The Progressive movement initially gelled around the figure of Teddy
Roosevelt, who was William McKinley’s vice president and who assumed the
presidency following McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Prior to his rise
to national office, Roosevelt had been an uncompromising governor of New
York and had worked hard to eliminate political corruption and “machine
politics.” In his first address to Congress, Roosevelt turned his
attention to the trusts. He argued that the prosperity of the United
States was based on market economy and the ingenuity of businessmen, but
at the same time,</p>
<p>here are real and grave evils … and a … widespread conviction in the
minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts
are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general
welfare. This springs from no spirit of envy or un-charitableness, nor
lack of pride in the great industrial achievements that have placed this
country at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy.
It does not rest upon a lack of intelligent appreciation of the
necessity of meeting changing and changed conditions of trade with new
methods, nor upon ignorance of the fact that combination of capital in
the effort to accomplish great things is necessary when the world’s
progress demands that great things be done. It is based upon sincere
conviction that combination and concentration should be, not prohibited,
but supervised and within reasonable limits controlled; and in my
judgment this conviction is right.</p>
<p>He continued: “It should be as much the aim of those who seek for
social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning as to
rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence.” His conclusion was
that</p>
<p>in the interest of the whole people, the nation should, without
interfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also
assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing
an interstate business. This is especially true where the corporation
derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic
element or tendency in its business.</p>
<p>Roosevelt proposed that Congress establish a federal agency with
power to investigate the affairs of the great corporations and that, if
necessary, a constitutional amendment could be used to create such an
agency. By 1902 Roosevelt had used the Sherman Act to break up the
Northern Securities Company, affecting the interests of J.P. Morgan, and
subsequent suits had been brought against Du Pont, the American Tobacco
Company, and the Standard Oil Company. Roosevelt strengthened the
Interstate Commerce Act with the Hepburn Act of 1906, which increased
the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission, particularly allowing
it to inspect the financial accounts of railways and extending its
authority into new spheres. Roosevelt’s successor, William Taft,
prosecuted trusts even more assiduously, the high point of this being
the breakup of the Standard Oil Company in 1911. Taft also promoted
other important reforms, such as the introduction of a federal income
tax, which came with the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in
1913.</p>
<p>The apogee of Progressive reforms came with the election of Woodrow
Wilson in 1912. Wilson noted in his 1913 book, The New Freedom, “If
monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of government. I
do not expect to see monopoly restrain itself. If there are men in this
country big enough to own the government of the United States, they are
going to own it.”</p>
<p>Wilson worked to pass the Clayton Antitrust Act in 1914,
strengthening the Sherman Act, and he created the Federal Trade
Commission, which enforced the Clayton Act. In addition, under the
impetus of the investigation of the Pujo Committee, led by Louisiana
congressman Arsene Pujo, into the “money trust,” the spread of monopoly
into the financial industry, Wilson moved to increase regulation of the
financial sector. In 1913 he created the Federal Reserve Board, which
would regulate monopolistic activities in the financial sector.</p>
<p>The rise of Robber Barons and their monopoly trusts in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries underscores that, as we already
emphasized in chapter 3, the presence of markets is not by itself a
guarantee of inclusive institutions. Markets can be dominated by a few
firms, charging exorbitant prices and blocking the entry of more
efficient rivals and new technologies. Markets, left to their own
devices, can cease to be inclusive, becoming increasingly dominated by
the economically and politically powerful. Inclusive economic
institutions require not just markets, but inclusive markets that create
a level playing field and economic opportunities for the majority of the
people. Widespread monopoly, backed by the political power of the elite,
contradicts this. But the reaction to the monopoly trusts also
illustrates that when political institutions are inclusive, they create
a countervailing force against movements away from inclusive markets.
This is the virtuous circle in action. Inclusive economic institutions
provide foundations upon which inclusive political institutions can
flourish, while inclusive political institutions restrict deviations
away from inclusive economic institutions. Trust busting in the United
States, in contrast to what we have seen in Mexico (this page–this
page), illustrates this facet of the virtuous circle. While there is no
political body in Mexico restricting Carlos Slim’s monopoly, the Sherman
and Clayton Acts have been used repeatedly in the United States over the
past century to restrict trusts, monopolies, and cartels, and to ensure
that markets remain inclusive.</p>
<p>The U.S. experience in the first half of the twentieth century also
emphasizes the important role of free media in empowering broad segments
of society and thus in the virtuous circle. In 1906 Roosevelt coined the
term muckraker, based on a literary character, the man with the muckrake
in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress, to describe what he regarded as
intrusive journalism. The term stuck and came to symbolize journalists
who were intrusively, but also effectively, exposing the excesses of
Robber Barons as well as corruption in local and federal politics.
Perhaps the most famous muckraker was Ida Tarbell, whose 1904 book,
History of the Standard Oil Company, played a key role in moving public
opinion against Rockefeller and his business interests, culminating in
the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911. Another key muckraker was lawyer
and author Louis Brandeis, who would later be named Supreme Court
justice by President Wilson. Brandeis outlined a series of financial
scandals in his book Other People’s Money and How Bankers Use It, and
was highly influential on the Pujo Committee. The newspaper magnate
William Randolph Hearst also played a salient role as muckraker. His
serialization in his magazine The Cosmopolitan in 1906 of articles by
David Graham Phillips, called “The Treason of the Senate,” galvanized
the campaign to introduce direct elections for the Senate, another key
Progressive reform that happened with the enactment of the Seventeenth
Amendment to the U.S. constitution in 1913.</p>
<p>The muckrakers played a major role in inducing politicians to take
action against the trusts. The Robber Barons hated the muckrakers, but
the political institutions of the United States made it impossible for
them to stamp out and silence them. Inclusive political institutions
allow a free media to flourish, and a free media, in turn, makes it more
likely that threats against inclusive economic and political
institutions will be widely known and resisted. In contrast, such
freedom is impossible under extractive political institutions, under
absolutism, or under dictatorships, which helps extractive regimes to
prevent serious opposition from forming in the first place. The
information that the free media provided was clearly key during the
first half of the twentieth century in the United States. Without this
information, the U.S. public would not have known the true extent of the
power and abuses of the Robber Barons and would not have mobilized
against their trusts.</p>
<p>PACKING THE COURT</p>
<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democratic Party candidate and cousin of
Teddy Roosevelt, was elected president in 1932 in the midst of the Great
Depression. He came to power with a popular mandate to implement an
ambitious set of policies for combating the Great Depression. At the
time of his inauguration in early 1933, one-quarter of the labor force
was unemployed, with many thrown into poverty. Industrial production had
fallen by over half since the Depression hit in 1929, and investment had
collapsed. The policies Roosevelt proposed to counteract this situation
were collectively known as the New Deal. Roosevelt had won a solid
victory, with 57 percent of the popular vote, and the Democratic Party
had majorities in both the Congress and Senate, enough to pass New Deal
legislation. However, some of the legislation raised constitutional
issues and ended up in the Supreme Court, where Roosevelt’s electoral
mandate cut much less ice.</p>
<p>One of the key pillars of the New Deal was the National Industrial
Recovery Act. Title I focused on industrial recovery. President
Roosevelt and his team believed that restraining industrial competition,
giving workers greater rights to form trade unions, and regulating
working standards were crucial to the recovery effort. Title II
established the Public Works Administration, whose infrastructure
projects include such landmarks as the Thirtieth Street railroad station
in Philadelphia, the Triborough Bridge, the Grand Coulee Dam, and the
Overseas Highway connecting Key West, Florida, with the mainland.
President Roosevelt signed the bill into law on June 16, 1933, and the
National Industrial Recovery Act was put into operation. However, it
immediately faced challenges in the courts. On May 27, 1935, the Supreme
Court unanimously ruled that Title I of the act was unconstitutional.
Their verdict noted solemnly, “Extraordinary conditions may call for
extraordinary remedies. But … extraordinary conditions do not create or
enlarge constitutional power.”</p>
<p>Before the Court’s ruling came in, Roosevelt had moved to the next
step of his agenda and had signed the Social Security Act, which
introduced the modern welfare state into the United States: pensions at
retirement, unemployment benefits, aid to families with dependent
children, and some public health care and disability benefits. He also
signed the National Labor Relations Act, which further strengthened the
rights of workers to organize unions, engage in collective bargaining,
and conduct strikes against their employers. These measures also faced
challenges in the Supreme Court. As these were making their way through
the judiciary, Roosevelt was reelected in 1936 with a strong mandate,
receiving 61 percent of the popular vote.</p>
<p>With his popularity at record highs, Roosevelt had no intention of
letting the Supreme Court derail more of his policy agenda. He laid out
his plans in one of his regular Fireside Chats, which was broadcast live
on the radio on March 9, 1937. He started by pointing out that in his
first term, much-needed policies had only cleared the Supreme Court by a
whisker. He went on:</p>
<p>I am reminded of that evening in March, four years ago, when I made
my first radio report to you. We were then in the midst of the great
banking crisis. Soon after, with the authority of the Congress, we asked
the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for
dollar, to the government of the United States. Today’s recovery proves
how right that policy was. But when, almost two years later, it came
before the Supreme Court its constitutionality was upheld only by a
five-to-four vote. The change of one vote would have thrown all the
affairs of this great nation back into hopeless chaos. In effect, four
justices ruled that the right under a private contract to exact a pound
of flesh was more sacred than the main objectives of the Constitution to
establish an enduring nation.</p>
<p>Obviously, this should not be risked again. Roosevelt continued:</p>
<p>Last Thursday I described the American form of government as a
three-horse team provided by the Constitution to the American people so
that their field might be plowed. The three horses are, of course, the
three branches of government—the Congress, the executive, and the
courts. Two of the horses, the Congress and the executive, are pulling
in unison today; the third is not.</p>
<p>Roosevelt then pointed out that the U.S. Constitution had not
actually endowed the Supreme Court with the right to challenge the
constitutionality of legislation, but that it had assumed this role in
1803. At the time, Justice Bushrod Washington had stipulated that the
Supreme Court should “presume in favor of [a law’s] validity until its
violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.”
Roosevelt then charged:</p>
<p>In the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit
of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside. The Court has been acting
not as a judicial body, but as a policymaking body.</p>
<p>Roosevelt claimed that he had an electoral mandate to change this
situation and that “after consideration of what reform to propose the
only method which was clearly constitutional … was to infuse new blood
into all our courts.” He also argued that the Supreme Court judges were
overworked, and the load was just too much for the older justices—who
happened to be the ones striking down his legislation. He then proposed
that all judges should face compulsory retirement at the age of seventy
and that he should be allowed to appoint up to six new justices. This
plan, which Roosevelt presented as the Judiciary Reorganization Bill,
would have sufficed to remove the justices who had been appointed
earlier by more conservative administrations and who had most
strenuously opposed the New Deal.</p>
<p>Though Roosevelt skillfully tried to win popular support for the
measure, opinion polls suggested that only about 40 percent of the
population was in favor of the plan. Louis Brandeis was now a Supreme
Court justice. Though Brandeis sympathized with much of Roosevelt’s
legislation, he spoke against the president’s attempts to erode the
power of the Supreme Court and his allegations that the justices were
overworked. Roosevelt’s Democratic Party had large majorities in both
houses of Congress. But the House of Representatives more or less
refused to deal with Roosevelt’s bill. Roosevelt then tried the Senate.
The bill was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which then held
highly contentious meetings, soliciting various opinions on the bill.
They ultimately sent it back to the Senate floor with a negative report,
arguing that the bill was a “needless, futile and utterly dangerous
abandonment of constitutional principle … without precedent or
justification.” The Senate voted 70 to 20 to send it back to committee
to be rewritten. All the “court packing” elements were stripped away.
Roosevelt would be unable to remove the constraints placed on his power
by the Supreme Court. Even though Roosevelt’s powers remained
constrained, there were compromises, and the Social Security and the
National Labor Relations Acts were both ruled constitutional by the
Court.</p>
<p>More important than the fate of these two acts was the general lesson
from this episode. Inclusive political institutions not only check major
deviations from inclusive economic institutions, but they also resist
attempts to undermine their own continuation. It was in the immediate
interests of the Democratic Congress and Senate to pack the court and
ensure that all New Deal legislation survived. But in the same way that
British political elites in the early eighteenth century understood that
suspending the rule of law would endanger the gains they had wrested
from the monarchy, congressmen and senators understood that if the
president could undermine the independence of the judiciary, then this
would undermine the balance of power in the system that protected them
from the president and ensured the continuity of pluralistic political
institutions.</p>
<p>Perhaps Roosevelt would have decided next that obtaining legislative
majorities took too much compromise and time and that he would instead
rule by decree, totally undermining pluralism and the U.S. political
system. Congress certainly would not have approved this, but then
Roosevelt could have appealed to the nation, asserting that Congress was
impeding the necessary measures to fight the Depression. He could have
used the police to close Congress. Sound farfetched? This is exactly
what happened in Peru and Venezuela in the 1990s. Presidents Fujimori
and Chávez appealed to their popular mandate to close uncooperative
congresses and subsequently rewrote their constitutions to massively
strengthen the powers of the president. The fear of this slippery slope
by those sharing power under pluralistic political institutions is
exactly what stopped Walpole from fixing British courts in the 1720s,
and it is what stopped the U.S. Congress from backing Roosevelt’s
court-packing plan. Roosevelt had encountered the power of virtuous
circles.</p>
<p>But this logic does not always play out, particularly in societies
that may have some inclusive features but that are broadly extractive.
We have already seen these dynamics in Rome and Venice. Another
illustration comes from comparing Roosevelt’s failed attempt to pack the
Court with similar efforts in Argentina, where crucially the same
struggles took place in the context of predominantly extractive economic
and political institutions.</p>
<p>The 1853 constitution of Argentina created a Supreme Court with
duties similar to those of the U.S. Supreme Court. An 1887 decision
allowed the Argentine court to assume the same role as that of the U.S.
Supreme Court in deciding whether specific laws were constitutional. In
theory, the Supreme Court could have developed as one of the important
elements of inclusive political institutions in Argentina, but the rest
of the political and economic system remained highly extractive, and
there was neither empowerment of broad segments of society nor pluralism
in Argentina. As in the United States, the constitutional role of the
Supreme Court would also be challenged in Argentina. In 1946 Juan
Domingo Perón was democratically elected president of Argentina. Perón
was a former colonel and had first come to national prominence after a
military coup in 1943, which had appointed him minister of labor. In
this post, he built a political coalition with trade unions and the
labor movement, which would be crucial for his presidential bid.</p>
<p>Shortly after Perón’s victory, his supporters in the Chamber of
Deputies proposed the impeachment of four of the five members of the
Court. The charges leveled against the Court were several. One involved
unconstitutionally accepting the legality of two military regimes in
1930 and 1943—rather ironic, since Perón had played a key role in the
latter coup. The other focused on legislation that the court had struck
down, just as its U.S. counterpart had done. In particular, just prior
to Perón’s election as president, the Court had issued a decision ruling
that Perón’s new national labor relations board was unconstitutional.
Just as Roosevelt heavily criticized the Supreme Court in his 1936
reelection campaign, Perón did the same in his 1946 campaign. Nine
months after initiating the impeachment process, the Chamber of Deputies
impeached three of the judges, the fourth having already resigned. The
Senate approved the motion. Perón then appointed four new justices. The
undermining of the Court clearly had the effect of freeing Perón from
political constraints. He could now exercise unchecked power, in much
the same way the military regimes in Argentina did before and after his
presidency. His newly appointed judges, for example, ruled as
constitutional the conviction of Ricardo Balbín, the leader of the main
opposition party to Perón, the Radical Party, for disrespecting Perón.
Perón could effectively rule as a dictator.</p>
<p>Since Perón successfully packed the Court, it has become the norm in
Argentina for any new president to handpick his own Supreme Court
justices. So a political institution that might have exercised some
constraints on the power of the executive is gone. Perón’s regime was
removed from power by another coup in 1955, and was followed by a long
sequence of transitions between military and civilian rule. Both new
military and civilian regimes picked their own justices. But picking
Supreme Court justices in Argentina was not an activity confined to
transitions between military and civilian rule. In 1990 Argentina
finally experienced a transition between democratically elected
governments—one democratic government followed by another. Yet, by this
time democratic governments did not behave much differently from
military ones when it came to the Supreme Court. The incoming president
was Carlos Saúl Menem of the Perónist Party. The sitting Supreme Court
had been appointed after the transition to democracy in 1983 by the
Radical Party president Raúl Alfonsín. Since this was a democratic
transition, there should have been no reason for Menem to appoint his
own court. But in the run-up to the election, Menem had already shown
his colors. He continually, though not successfully, tried to encourage
(or even intimidate) members of the court to resign. He famously offered
Justice Carlos Fayt an ambassadorship. But he was rebuked, and Fayt
responded by sending him a copy of his book Law and Ethics, with the
note “Beware I wrote this” inscribed. Undeterred, within three months of
taking office, Menem sent a law to the Chamber of Deputies proposing to
expand the Court from five to nine members. One argument was the same
Roosevelt used in 1937: the court was overworked. The law quickly passed
the Senate and Chamber, and this allowed Menem to name four new judges.
He had his majority.</p>
<p>Menem’s victory against the Supreme Court set in motion the type of
slippery-slope dynamics we mentioned earlier. His next step was to
rewrite the constitution to remove the term limit so he could run for
president again. After being reelected, Menem moved to rewrite the
constitution again, but was stopped not by Argentina political
institutions but by factions within his own Perónist Party, who fought
back against his personal domination.</p>
<p>Since independence, Argentina has suffered from most of the
institutional problems that have plagued Latin America. It has been
trapped in a vicious, not a virtuous, circle. As a consequence, positive
developments, such as first steps toward the creation of an independent
Supreme Court, never gained a foothold. With pluralism, no group wants
or dares to overthrow the power of another, for fear that its own power
will be subsequently challenged. At the same time, the broad
distribution of power makes such an overthrow difficult. A Supreme Court
can have power if it receives significant support from broad segments of
society willing to push back attempts to vitiate the Court’s
independence. That has been the case in the United States, but not
Argentina. Legislators there were happy to undermine the Court even if
they anticipated that this could jeopardize their own position. One
reason is that with extractive institutions there is much to gain from
overthrowing the Supreme Court, and the potential benefits are worth the
risks.</p>
<p>POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND VIRTUOUS CIRCLES</p>
<p>Inclusive economic and political institutions do not emerge by
themselves. They are often the outcome of significant conflict between
elites resisting economic growth and political change and those wishing
to limit the economic and political power of existing elites. Inclusive
institutions emerge during critical junctures, such as during the
Glorious Revolution in England or the foundation of the Jamestown colony
in North America, when a series of factors weaken the hold of the elites
in power, make their opponents stronger, and create incentives for the
formation of a pluralistic society. The outcome of political conflict is
never certain, and even if in hindsight we see many historical events as
inevitable, the path of history is contingent. Nevertheless, once in
place, inclusive economic and political institutions tend to create a
virtuous circle, a process of positive feedback, making it more likely
that these institutions will persist and even expand.</p>
<p>The virtuous circle works through several mechanisms. First, the
logic of pluralistic political institutions makes usurpation of power by
a dictator, a faction within the government, or even a well-meaning
president much more difficult, as Franklin Roosevelt discovered when he
tried to remove the checks on his power imposed by the Supreme Court,
and as Sir Robert Walpole discovered when he attempted to summarily
implement the Black Act. In both cases, concentrating power further in
the hands of an individual or a narrow group would have started
undermining the foundations of pluralistic political institutions, and
the true measure of pluralism is precisely its ability to resist such
attempts. Pluralism also enshrines the notion of the rule of law, the
principle that laws should be applied equally to everybody—something
that is naturally impossible under an absolutist monarchy. But the rule
of law, in turn, implies that laws cannot simply be used by one group to
encroach upon the rights of another. What’s more, the principle of the
rule of law opens the door for greater participation in the political
process and greater inclusivity, as it powerfully introduces the idea
that people should be equal not only before the law but also in the
political system. This was one of the principles that made it difficult
for the British political system to resist the forceful calls for
greater democracy throughout the nineteenth century, opening the way to
the gradual extension of the franchise to all adults.</p>
<p>Second, as we have seen several times before, inclusive political
institutions support and are supported by inclusive economic
institutions. This creates another mechanism of the virtuous circle.
Inclusive economic institutions remove the most egregious extractive
economic relations, such as slavery and serfdom, reduce the importance
of monopolies, and create a dynamic economy, all of which reduces the
economic benefits that one can secure, at least in the short run, by
usurping political power. Because economic institutions had already
become sufficiently inclusive in Britain by the eighteenth century, the
elite had less to gain by clinging to power and, in fact, much to lose
by using widespread repression against those demanding greater
democracy. This facet of the virtuous circle made the gradual march of
democracy in nineteenth-century Britain both less threatening to the
elite and more likely to succeed. This contrasts with the situation in
absolutist regimes such as the Austro-Hungarian or Russian empires,
where economic institutions were still highly extractive and, in
consequence, where calls for greater political inclusion later in the
nineteenth century would be met by repression because the elite had too
much to lose from sharing power.</p>
<p>Finally, inclusive political institutions allow a free media to
flourish, and a free media often provides information about and
mobilizes opposition to threats against inclusive institutions, as it
did during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and first quarter
of the twentieth century, when the increasing economic domination of the
Robber Barons was threatening the essence of inclusive economic
institutions in the United States.</p>
<p>Though the outcome of the ever-present conflicts continues to be
contingent, through these mechanisms the virtuous circle creates a
powerful tendency for inclusive institutions to persist, to resist
challenges, and to expand as they did in both Britain and the United
States. Unfortunately, as we will see in the next chapter, extractive
institutions create equally strong forces toward their persistence—the
process of the vicious circle.</p>
