<p>CHAPTER 1 : So CLOSE AND YET SO DIFFERENT</p>
<p>A good discussion of the Spanish exploration of the Rio de La Plata
is Rock (1992), chap. 1. On the discovery and colonization of the
Guaraní, see Ganson (2003). The quotations from de Sahagún are from de
Sahagún (1975), pp. 47–49. Gibson (1963) is fundamental on the Spanish
conquest of Mexico and the institutions they structured. The quotations
from de las Casas come from de las Casas (1992), pp. 39, 117–18, and
107, respectively.</p>
<p>On Pizarro in Peru, see Hemming (1983). Chaps. 1–6 cover the meeting
at Cajamarca and the march south and the capture of the Inca capital,
Cuzco. See Hemming (1983), chap. 20, on de Toledo. Bakewell (1984) gives
an overview of the functioning of the Potosí mita, and Dell (2010)
provides statistical evidence that shows how it has had persistent
effects over time.</p>
<p>The quote from Arthur Young is reproduced from Sheridan (1973), p. 8.
There are many good books that describe the early history of Jamestown:
for example, Price (2003), and Kupperman (2007). Our treatment is
heavily influenced by Morgan (1975) and Galenson (1996). The quote from
Anas Todkill comes from p. 38 of Todkill (1885). The quotes from John
Smith are from Price (2003), p. 77 (“Victuals …”), p. 93 (“If your king
…”), and p. 96 (“When you send …”). The Charter of Maryland, the
Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, and other colonial constitutions
have been put on the Internet by Yale University’s Avalon Project, at
avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century.</p>
<p>Bakewell (2009), chap. 14, discusses the independence of Mexico and
the constitution. See Stevens (1991) and Knight (2011) on
postindependence political instability and presidents. Coatsworth (1978)
is the seminal paper on the evidence on economic decline in Mexico after
independence. Haber (2010) presents the comparison of the development of
banking in Mexico and the United States. Sokoloff (1988) and Sokoloff
and Khan (1990) provide evidence on the social background of innovators
in the United States who filed patents. See Israel (2000) for a
biography of Thomas Edison. Haber, Maurer, and Razo (2003) proposes an
interpretation of the political economy of the regime of Porfirio Díaz
very much in the spirit of our discussion. Haber, Klein, Maurer, and
Middlebrook (2008) extend this treatment of Mexico’s political economy
into the twentieth century. On the differential allocation of frontier
lands in North and Latin America, see Nugent and Robinson (2010) and
García-Jimeno and Robinson (2011). Hu-DeHart (1984) discusses the
deportation of the Yaqui people in chap. 6. On the fortune of Carlos
Slim and how it was made, see Relea (2007) and Martinez (2002).</p>
<p>Our interpretation of comparative economic development of the
Americas builds on our own previous research with Simon Johnson,
particularly Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001, 2002), and has also
been heavily influenced by Coatsworth (1978, 2008) and Engerman and
Sokoloff (1997).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2 : THEORIES THAT DON’T WORK</p>
<p>Jared Diamond’s views on world inequality are laid out in his book
Guns, Germs and Steel (1997). Sachs (2006) sets out his own version of
geographical determinism. Views about culture are widely spread
throughout the academic literature but have never been brought together
in one work. Weber (2002) argued that it was the Protestant Reformation
that explained why it was Europe that had the Industrial Revolution.
Landes (1999) proposed that Northern Europeans developed a unique set of
cultural attitudes that led them to work hard, save, and be innovative.
Harrison and Huntington, eds. (2000), is a forceful statement of the
importance of culture for comparative economic development. The notion
that there is some sort of superior British culture or superior set of
British institutions is widespread and used to explain U.S.
exceptionalism (Fisher, 1989) and also patterns of comparative
development more generally (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer,
2008). The works of Banfield (1958) and Putnam, Leonardi, and Nanetti
(1994) are very influential cultural interpretations of how one aspect
of culture, or “social capital,” as they call it, makes the south of
Italy poor. For a survey of how economists use notions of culture, see
Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2006). Tabellini (2010) examines the
correlation between the extent to which people trust each other in
Western Europe and levels of annual income per capita. Nunn and
Wantchekon (2010) show how the lack of trust and social capital in
Africa is correlated with the historical intensity of the slave
trade.</p>
<p>The relevant history of the Kongo is presented in Hilton (1985) and
Thornton (1983). On the historical backwardness of African technology,
see the works of Goody (1971), Law (1980), and Austen and Headrick
(1983).</p>
<p>The definition of economics proposed by Robbins is from Robbins
(1935), p. 16.</p>
<p>The quote from Abba Lerner is in Lerner (1972), p. 259. The idea that
ignorance explains comparative development is implicit in most economic
analyses of economic development and policy reform: for example,
Williamson (1990); Perkins, Radelet, and Lindauer (2006); and Aghion and
Howitt (2009). A recent, forceful version of this view is developed in
Banerjee and Duflo (2011).</p>
<p>Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001, 2002) provide a statistical
analysis of the relative role of institutions, geography, and culture,
showing that institutions dominate the other two types of explanations
in accounting for differences in per capita income today.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 3 : THE MAKING OF PROSPERITY AND POVERTY</p>
<p>The reconstruction of the meeting between Hwang Pyŏng-Wŏn and his
brother is taken from James A. Foley’s interview of Hwang transcribed in
Foley (2003), pp. 197–203.</p>
<p>The notion of extractive institutions originates from Acemoglu,
Johnson, and Robinson (2001). The terminology of inclusive institutions
was suggested to us by Tim Besley. The terminology of economic losers
and the distinction between them and political losers comes from
Acemoglu and Robinson (2000b). The data on Barbados comes from Dunn
(1969). Our treatment of the Soviet economy relies on Nove (1992) and
Davies (1998). Allen (2003) provides an alternative and more positive
interpretation of Soviet economic history.</p>
<p>In the social science literature there is a great deal of research
related to our theory and argument. See Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson
(2005b) for an overview of this literature and our contribution to it.
The institutional view of comparative development builds on a number of
important works. Particularly notable is the work of North; see North
and Thomas (1973), North (1982), North and Weingast (1989), and North,
Wallis, and Weingast (2009). Olson (1984) also provided a very
influential account of the political economy of economic growth. Mokyr
(1990) is a fundamental book that links economic losers to comparative
technological change in world history. The notion of economic losers is
very widespread in social science as an explanation for why efficient
institutional and policy outcomes do not occur. Our interpretation,
which builds on Robinson (1998) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2000b,
2006b), differs by emphasizing the idea that the most important barrier
to the emergence of inclusive institutions is elites’ fear that they
will lose their political power. Jones (2003) provides a rich
comparative history emphasizing similar themes, and Engerman and
Sokoloff’s (1997) important work on the Americas also emphasizes these
ideas. A seminal political economy interpretation of African
underdevelopment was developed by Bates (1981, 1983, 1989), whose work
heavily influenced ours. Seminal studies by Dalton (1965) and Killick
(1978) emphasize the role of politics in African development and
particularly how the fear of losing political power influences economic
policy. The notion of political losers was previously implicit in other
theoretical work in political economy, for instance, Besley and Coate
(1998) and Bourguignon and Verdier (2000). The role of political
centralization and state institutions in development has been most
heavily emphasized by historical sociologists following the work by Max
Weber. Notable is the work of Mann (1986, 1993), Migdal (1988), and
Evans (1995). In Africa, work on the connection between the state and
development is emphasized by Herbst (2000) and Bates (2001). Economists
have recently begun to contribute to this literature; for example,
Acemoglu (2005) and Besley and Persson (2011). Finally, Johnson (1982),
Haggard (1990), Wade (1990), and Amsden (1992) emphasized how it was the
particular political economy of East Asian nations that allowed them to
be so economically successful. Finley (1965) made a seminal argument
that slavery was responsible for the lack of technological dynamism in
the classical world.</p>
<p>The idea that growth under extractive institutions is possible but is
also likely to run out of steam is emphasized in Acemoglu (2008).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4 : SMALL DIFFERENCES AND CRITICAL JUNCTURES</p>
<p>Benedictow (2004) provides a definitive overview of the Black Death,
though his assessments of how many people the plague killed are
controversial. The quotations from Boccaccio and Ralph of Shrewsbury are
reproduced from Horrox (1994). Hatcher (2008) provides a compelling
account of the anticipation and arrival of the plague in England. The
text of the Statute of Laborers is available online from the Avalon
Project, at avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/statlab.asp</p>
<p>The fundamental works on the impact of the Black Death on the
divergence of Eastern and Western Europe are North and Thomas (1973) and
particularly Brenner (1976), whose analysis of how the initial
distribution of political power affected the consequences of the plague
has greatly influenced our thinking. See DuPlessis (1997) on the Second
Serfdom in Eastern Europe. Conning (2010) and Acemoglu and Wolitzky
(2011) develop formalizations of Brenner’s thesis. The quote from James
Watt is reproduced from Robinson (1964), pp. 223–24.</p>
<p>In Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005a) we first presented the
argument that it was the interaction between Atlantic trade and initial
institutional differences that led to the divergence of English
institutions and ultimately the Industrial Revolution. The notion of the
iron law of oligarchy is due to Michels (1962). The notion of a critical
juncture was first developed by Lipset and Rokkan (1967).</p>
<p>On the role of institutions in the long-run development of the
Ottoman Empire, the research of Owen (1981), Owen and Pamuk (1999), and
Pamuk (2006) is fundamental.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5 : “I’VE SEEN THE FUTURE, AND IT WORKS”</p>
<p>On Steffens’s mission to Russia and his words to Baruch, see Steffens
(1931), chap. 18, pp. 790–802. For the number of people who starved in
the 1930s, we use the figures of Davies and Wheatcroft (2004). On the
1937 census numbers, see Wheatcroft and Davies (1994a, 1994b). The
nature of innovation in the Soviet economy is studied in Berliner
(1976). Our discussion of how Stalinism, and particularly economic
planning, really worked is based on Gregory and Harrison (2005). On how
writers of U.S. economics textbooks continually got Soviet economic
growth wrong, see Levy and Peart (2009).</p>
<p>Our treatment and interpretation of the Lele and the Bushong is based
on the research of Douglas (1962, 1963) and Vansina (1978).</p>
<p>On the concept of the Long Summer, see Fagan (2003). An accessible
introduction to the Natufians and archaeological sites we mention can be
found in Mithen (2006) and Barker (2006). The seminal work on Abu
Hureyra is Moore, Hillman, and Legge (2000), which documents how
sedentary life and institutional innovation appeared prior to farming.
See Smith (1998) for a general overview of the evidence that sedentary
life preceded farming, and see Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1992) for the
case of the Natufians. Our approach to the Neolithic Revolution is
inspired by Sahlins (1972), which also has the anecdote about the Yir
Yoront.</p>
<p>Our discussion of Maya history follows Martin and Grube (2000) and
Webster (2002). The reconstruction of the population history of Copán
comes from Webster, Freter, and Gonlin (2000). The number of dated
monuments is from Sidrys and Berger (1979).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 6 : DRIFTING APART</p>
<p>The discussion of the Venetian case follows Puga and Trefler (2010),
and chaps. 8 and 9 of Lane (1973).</p>
<p>The material on Rome is contained in any standard history. Our
interpretation of Roman economic institutions follows Finlay (1999) and
Bang (2008). Our account of Roman decline follows Ward-Perkins (2006)
and Goldsworthy (2009). On institutional changes in the late Roman
Empire, see Jones (1964). The anecdotes about Tiberius and Hadrian are
from Finley (1999).</p>
<p>The evidence from shipwrecks was first used by Hopkins (1980). See De
Callataǿ (2005) and Jongman (2007) for an overview of this and the
Greenland Ice Core Project.</p>
<p>The Vindolanda tablets are available online at
vindolanda.csad.ox.ac.uk/. The quote we use comes from TVII Pub. no.:
343.</p>
<p>The discussion of the factors that led to the decline of Roman
Britain follows Cleary (1989), chap. 4; Faulkner (2000), chap. 7; Dark
(1994), chap. 2.</p>
<p>On Aksum, see Munro-Hay (1991). The seminal work on European
feudalism and its origins is Bloch (1961); see Crummey (2000) on
Ethiopian feudalism. Phillipson (1998) makes the comparison between the
collapse of Aksum and the collapse of the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7 : THE TURNING POINT</p>
<p>The story of Lee’s machine and meeting with Queen Elizabeth I is
available at calverton.homestead.com/willlee.html.</p>
<p>Allen (2009b) presents the data on real wages using Diocletian’s
Edict on Maximum Prices.</p>
<p>Our argument about the causes of the Industrial Revolution is highly
influenced by the arguments made in North and Thomas (1973), North and
Weingast (1989), Brenner (1993), Pincus (2009), and Pincus and Robinson
(2010). These scholars in turn were inspired by earlier Marxist
interpretations of British institutional change and the emergence of
capitalism; see Dobb</p>
<ol start="1963" type="1">
<li>and Hill (1961, 1980). See also Tawney’s (1941) thesis about how the
state building project of Henry VIII changed the English social
structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The text of the Magna Carta is available online at the Avalon
Project, at avalon.law.yale.edu/medieval/magframe.asp.</p>
<p>Elton (1953) is the seminal work on the development of state
institutions under Henry VIII, and Neale (1971) relates these to the
evolution of parliament.</p>
<p>On the Peasants’ Revolt, see Hilton (2003). The quote from Hill on
monopolies is from Hill (1961), p. 25. On Charles I’s period of
“personal rule,” we follow Sharp (1992). Our evidence on how different
groups and regions sided either for or against Parliament comes from
Brunton and Pennington (1954), Hill (1961), and Stone (2001). Pincus
(2009) is fundamental on the Glorious Revolution and discusses many of
the specific changes in policies and economic institutions; for example,
the repeal of the Hearth Tax and the creation of the Bank of England.
See also Pincus and Robinson (2010). Pettigrew (2007, 2009) discusses
the attack on monopolies, including the Royal African Company, and our
data on petitioning comes from his papers. Knights (2010) emphasizes the
political importance of petitioning. Our information on Hoare’s Bank
comes from Temin and Voth (2008).</p>
<p>Our information about Superviser Cowperthwaite and the excise tax
bureaucracy comes from Brewer (1988).</p>
<p>Our overview of the economic history of the Industrial Revolution
rests on Mantoux (1961), Daunton (1995), Allen (2009a), and Mokyr (1990,
2009), who provide details on the famous inventors and inventions we
discuss. The story about the Baldwyn family is from Bogart and
Richardson (2009, 2011), who stress the connection between the Glorious
Revolution, the reorganization of property rights, and the construction
of roads and canals. On the Calicoe Acts and Manchester Acts, see
O’Brien, Griffiths, and Hunt (1991), which is the source of the quotes
from the legislation. On the dominance of new people in industry, see
Daunton (1995), chap. 7, and Crouzet (1985).</p>
<p>Our account of why the major institutional changes first took place
in England is based on Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2005a) and
Brenner (1976). The data on the number of independent merchants and
their political preferences come from Zahedieh (2010).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 8 : NOT ON OUR TURF</p>
<p>On the opposition to the printing press in the Ottoman Empire, see
Savage-Smith (2003) pp. 656–59. Comparative historical literacy comes
from Easterlin (1981).</p>
<p>Our discussion of political institutions of Spain follows Thompson
(1994a, 1994b). For evidence on the economic decline of Spain over this
period, see Nogal and Prados de la Escosura (2007).</p>
<p>Our discussion of the impediments to economic development in
Austria-Hungary follows Blum (1943), Freudenberger (1967), and Gross
(1973). The quotation from Maria Theresa comes from Freudenberger,
p. 495. All other quotations from Count Hartig and Francis I are from
Blum. Francis’s reply to the delegates from the Tyrol is quoted from
Jászi (1929), pp. 80–81. The comment of Friedrich von Gentz to Robert
Owen is also quoted from Jászi (1929), p. 80. The experience of the
Rothschilds in Austria is discussed in chap. 2 of Corti (1928).</p>
<p>Our analysis of Russia follows Gerschenkron (1970). The quotation
from Kropotkin is from p. 60 of the 2009 edition of his book. The
conversation between Nicholas and Mikhail is quoted from Saunders
(1992), p. 117. Kankrin’s quote on railways is in Owen (1991),
pp. 15–16.</p>
<p>The speech by Nicholas to the manufacturers is reproduced from
Pintner 967), p. 100.</p>
<p>The quote from A. A. Zakrevskii is from Pintner (1967), p. 235.</p>
<p>On Admiral Zheng, see Dreyer (2007). The economic history of early
Modern China is covered by Myers and Wang (2002). The quote from T’ang
Chen is quoted from Myers and Wang, pp. 564–65.</p>
<p>See Zewde (2002) for an overview of the relevant Ethiopian history.
The data on how extractive Ethiopia has been historically come from
Pankhurst (1961), as do all the quotes we reproduce here.</p>
<p>Our description of Somali institutions and history follows Lewis
(1961, 2002). The heer of the Hassan Ugaas is reproduced on p.177 of
Lewis (1961); our description of a feud comes from chap. 8 of Lewis
(1961), where he reports many other examples. On the Kingdom of Taqali
and writing, see Ewald (1988).</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9 : REVERSING DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>Our discussion of the takeover of Ambon and Banda by the Dutch East
India Company and the company’s negative effect on the development of
Southeast Asia follows Hanna (1978) and particularly Reid (1993),
chap. 5. The quotes from Reid on Tomé Pires are from p. 271; the Dutch
factor in Maguindanao, p. 299; the sultan of Maguindanao, pp. 299–300.
Data on the impact of the Dutch East India Company on the price of
spices come from O’Rourke and Williamson (2002).</p>
<p>A definitive overview of slavery in African society and the impact of
the slave trade is Lovejoy (2000). Lovejoy, p. 47, Table 31, reports
consensus estimates of the extent of the slave trade. Nunn (2008)
provided the first quantitative estimates of the impact of the slave
trade on African economic institutions and economic growth. The data on
firearms and gunpowder imports are from Inikori (1977). The testimony of
Francis Moore is quoted from Lovejoy (2000), pp. 89–90. Law (1977) is a
seminal study of the expansion of the Oyo state. The estimates of the
impact of the slave trade on population in Africa are taken from Manning
(1990). Lovejoy (2000), chap. 8, the essays in Law (1995), and the
important book of Austin (2005) are the basis for our discussion of the
analysis of the period of “legitimate commerce.” Data on the proportion
of Africans who were slaves in Africa comes from Lovejoy (2000), e.g.,
p. 192, Table 9.2.</p>
<p>Data on labor in Liberia is from Clower, Dalton, Harwitz, and Walters
(1966).</p>
<p>The dual economy idea was developed by Lewis (1954). Fergusson (2010)
develops a mathematical model of the dual economy. The notion that this
was a creation of colonialism was first proposed in the seminal
collection of essays edited by Palmer and Parsons (1977). Our account of
South Africa is based on Bundy (1979) and Feinstein (2005).</p>
<p>The Moravian missionary is quoted in Bundy (1979), p. 46, and John
Hemming is quoted in Bundy, p. 72. The spread of land ownership in
Griqualand East is from Bundy, p. 89; the exploits of Stephen Sonjica
are from Bundy, p. 94; the quote from Matthew Blyth is from p. 97; and
the quote from a European observer in Fingoland 1884 is from Bundy,
pp. 100–101. George Albu is quoted in Feinstein (2005), p. 63; secretary
for native affairs is quoted from Feinstein, p. 45; and Verwoerd is
quoted from Feinstein, p. 159. Data on the real wages of African gold
miners are from p. 66 of Wilson (1972). G. Findlay is quoted in Bundy
(1979), p. 242.</p>
<p>The notion that the development of the rich countries of the West is
the mirror image of the underdevelopment of the rest of the world was
originally developed by Wallertsein (1974–2011), though he emphasizes
very different mechanisms than we do.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 10 : THE DIFFUSION OF PROSPERITY</p>
<p>This chapter builds heavily on our previous research with Simon
Johnson and Davide Cantoni: Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) and
Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2010, 2011).</p>
<p>Our discussion of the development of early institutions in Australia
follows the seminal work of Hirst (1983, 1988, 2003) and Neal (1991).
The original manuscript of the writ issued to Judge Collins is available
(thanks to the Macquarie University Law School in Australia) at
www.law.mq.edu.au/scnsw/html/Cable%20v%20Sinclair,%201788.htm.</p>
<p>Macarthur’s characterization of Wentworth’s supporters is quoted from
Melbourne (1963), pp. 131–32.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the origins of the Rothschilds follows Ferguson
(1998); Mayer Rothschild’s remark to his son is reproduced from
Ferguson, p. 76.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the impact of the French on European institutions
is taken from Acemoglu, Cantoni, Johnson, and Robinson (2010, 2011) and
the references therein. See Doyle (2002) for a standard overview of the
French Revolution. Information on the feudal dues in Nassau-Usingen is
from Lenger (2004), p. 96. Ogilivie (2011) overviews the historical
impact of guilds on European development.</p>
<p>For a treatment of the life of (Ōkubo Toshimichi, see Iwata (1964).
Sakamoto Ryūma’s eight-point plan is reproduced from Jansen (2000),
p. 310.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11 : THE VIRTUOUS CIRCLE</p>
<p>Our discussion of the Black Act follows Thompson (1975). Baptist
Nunn’s report of June 27 is from Thompson (1975), pp. 65–66. The other
quotes are from Thompson’s section on the rule of law, pp. 258–69, which
is well worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p>Our approach to democratization in England is based on Acemoglu and
Robinson (2000a, 2001, and 2006a). Earl Grey’s speech is quoted from
Evans (1996), p. 223. Stephens’s comment about democracy is quoted in
Briggs (1959), p. 34. Thompson’s quote is from Thompson (1975),
p. 269.</p>
<p>The entire text of the People’s Charter can be found in Cole and
Filson (1951) and at web.bham.ac.uk/1848/document/peoplech.htm.</p>
<p>The quote from Burke is taken from Burke (1790/1969), p. 152.</p>
<p>Lindert (2004, 2009) is a seminal treatment of the coevolution of
democracy and public policy over the past two hundred years.</p>
<p>Keyssar (2009) is a seminal introduction to the evolution of
political rights in the United States. Vanderbilt is quoted in Josephson
(1934), p. 15. The text of Roosevelt’s address is at
www.theodore-roosevelt.com/sotu1.html.</p>
<p>The quote from Woodrow Wilson is from Wilson (1913), p. 286.</p>
<p>The text of President Roosevelt’s Fireside Chat can be found at
miller-center.org/scripps/archive/speeches/detail/3309.</p>
<p>Data on the relative tenure of Supreme Court justices in Argentina
and the United States is presented in Iaryczower, Spiller, and Tommasi
(2002). Helmke (2004) discusses the history of court packing in
Argentina and quotes Justice Carlos Fayt.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 12 : THE VICIOUS CIRCLE</p>
<p>This chapter heavily relies on our theoretical and empirical research
on institutional persistence, particularly Acemoglu, Johnson, and
Robinson (2005b) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2008a). Heath (1972) and
Kelley and Klein (1980) made a seminal application of the iron law of
oligarchy to the 1952 Bolivian Revolution.</p>
<p>The quote from the British parliamentary papers is reproduced from
p. 15 of House of Commons (1904). The early political history of
postindependence Sierra Leone is well told in Cartwright (1970). Though
interpretations differ as to why Siaka Stevens pulled up the railway
line, the salient one is that he did this to isolate Mendeland. In this
we follow Abraham and Sesay (1993), p. 120; Richards (1996), pp. 42–43;
and Davies (2007), pp. 684–85. Reno (1995, 2003) are the best treatments
of Stevens’s regime. The data on the agricultural marketing boards comes
from Davies (2007). On the murder of Sam Bangura by defenestration, see
Reno (1995), pp. 137–41. Jackson (2004), p. 63, and Keen (2005), p. 17,
discuss the acronyms ISU and SSD.</p>
<p>Bates (1981) is the seminal analysis of how marketing boards
destroyed agricultural productivity in postindependence Africa, see
Goldstein and Udry (2009) on how political connections to chiefs
determine property rights to land in Ghana.</p>
<p>On the relation between politicians in 1993 and the conquistadors,
see Dosal (1995), chap. 1, and Casaús Arzú (2007). Our discussion of the
policies of the Consulado de Comercio follows Woodward (1966). The quote
from President Barrios is from McCreery (1994), pp. 187–88. Our
discussion of the regime of Jorge Ubico follows Grieb (1979).</p>
<p>Our discussion of the underdevelopment of the U.S. South follows
Acemoglu and Robinson (2008b). See Wright (1978) on the pre–Civil War
development of the slave economy, and Bateman and Weiss (1981) on the
dearth of industry. Fogel and Engerman (1974) give a different and
controversial interpretation. Wright (1986) and Ransom and Sutch (2001)
give overviews of the extent to which the southern economy after 1865
really changed. Congressman George Washington Julian is quoted in Wiener
(1978), p. 6. The same book contains the analysis of the persistence of
the southern landed elite after the Civil War. Naidu (2009) examines the
impact of the introduction of poll taxes and literacy tests in the 1890s
in southern states. The quotation from W.E.B. Du Bois is in his book Du
Bois (1903), p. 88. Clause 256 of the Alabama constitution can be found
at www.legislature.state.al.us/CodeOfAlabama/Constitution/</p>
<p>1901/CA-245806.htm.</p>
<p>Alston and Ferrie (1999) discuss how southern politicians blocked
federal legislation they thought would disrupt the South’s economy.
Woodward (1955) gives a seminal overview of the creation of Jim
Crow.</p>
<p>Overviews of the Ethiopian revolution are provided in Halliday and
Molyneux (1981). On the Emperor’s cushions, see Kapuściński (1983). The
quotes from Dawit Wolde Giorgis are from Dawit Wolde Giorgis (1989),
pp. 49 and 48, respectively.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 13 : WHY NATIONS FAIL TODAY</p>
<p>For the BBC report on Mugabe’s lottery success, including the public
statement of Zimbank, see news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/621895.stm.</p>
<p>Our treatment of the creation of white rule in Rhodesia follows
Palmer (1977) and Alexander (2006). Meredith (2007) provides a good
overview of more recent Zimbabwean politics.</p>
<p>Our account of the civil war in Sierra Leone follows Richards (1996),
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2004), and Keen (2005). The
analysis published in a newspaper in the capital city of Freetown in
1995 is quoted from Keen (2005), p. 34. The text of the RUF’s “Footpaths
to Democracy” can we found at
www.sierra-leone.org/AFRC-RUF/footpaths.html.</p>
<p>The quotation from the teenager from Geoma is from Keen (2005),
p. 42.</p>
<p>Our discussion of the Colombian paramilitaries follows Acemoglu,
Robinson, and Santos (2010) and Chaves and Robinson (2010), which in
turn heavily rely on the extensive work by Colombian scholars,
particularly Romero (2003), the essays in Romero (2007), and López
(2010). León (2009) is an accessible and balanced account of the nature
of contemporary conflicts in Colombia. Also fundamental is the Web site
run by the weekly newspaper Semana, www.verdadabierta.com/. All the
quotes come from Acemoglu, Robinson, and Santos (2010). The contract
between Martín Llanos and the mayors in Casanare is available in Spanish
at
www.verdadabierta.com/victimarios/los-jefes/714-perfil-hector-german-buitrago-alias-martin-llanos.</p>
<p>The origins and consequences of El Corralito are well presented in a
series of articles in The Economist magazine, available at
www.economist.com/search/apachesolr_search/corralito.</p>
<p>On the role of the interior in Argentine development, see Sawers
(1996).</p>
<p>Hassig and Oh (2009) provides an excellent, valuable account of life
in North Korea. Chap. 2 covers the luxurious lifestyle of the
leadership, and chaps. 3 and 4, the economic realities that most people
face. The BBC coverage of the currency reform can be found at
news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8500017.stm. On the pleasure palace and brandy
consumption, see chap. 12 of Post (2004).</p>
<p>Our discussion of child labor and its use for picking cotton in
Uzbeksitan follows Kandiyoti (2008), available at

(2003); Robinson and Parsons (2006); and Leith (2005). Schapera (1970)
and Parsons, Henderson, and Tlou (1995) are fundamental works. High
Commissioner Rey is quoted in Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2003),
p. 96. The discussion of the three chiefs’ visit to England follows
Parsons (1998), and all quotes relating to this come from his book:
Chamberlain, pp. 206–7; Fairfield, p. 209; and Rhodes, p. 223. Schapera
is quoted from Schapera (1940), p. 72. The quote from Quett Masire is

Wright (1999); on the mechanization of cotton picking, Heinicke (1994).
“FRDUM FOOF SPETGH” is quoted from Mickey (2008), p. 50. Thurmond’s 1948
speech is taken from www.slate.com/id/2075151/, where you also can
listen to the audio recording. On James Meredith and Oxford,
Mississippi, see Doyle (2001). See Wright (1999) on the impact of civil
rights legislation on black voting in the South.</p>

Jiabao’s comments on political reforms in China, see
www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/29/wen-jiabao-china-reform.</p>
<p>The modernization hypothesis is clearly articulated in Lipset (1959).
The evidence against it is discussed in detail in Acemoglu, Johnson,
Robinson, and Yared (2008, 2009). George H. W. Bush’s quote is from
news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/752224.stm.</p>
