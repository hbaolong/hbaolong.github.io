<h4 id="preface">PREFACE</h4>
<p>THIS BOOK IS about the huge differences in incomes and standards of
living that separate the rich countries of the world, such as the United
States, Great Britain, and Germany, from the poor, such as those in
sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, and South Asia.</p>
<p>As we write this preface, North Africa and the Middle East have been
shaken by the “Arab Spring” started by the so-called Jasmine Revolution,
which was initially ignited by public outrage over the self-immolation
of a street vendor, Mohamed Bouazizi, on December 17, 2010. By January
14, 2011, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who had ruled Tunisia since
1987, had stepped down, but far from abating, the revolutionary fervor
against the rule of privileged elites in Tunisia was getting stronger
and had already spread to the rest of the Middle East. Hosni Mubarak,
who had ruled Egypt with a tight grip for almost thirty years, was
ousted on February 11, 2011. The fates of the regimes in Bahrain, Libya,
Syria, and Yemen are unknown as we complete this preface.</p>
<p>The roots of discontent in these countries lie in their poverty. The
average Egyptian has an income level of around 12 percent of the average
citizen of the United States and can expect to live ten fewer years; 20
percent of the population is in dire poverty. Though these differences
are significant, they are actually quite small compared with those
between the United States and the poorest countries in the world, such
as North Korea, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe, where well over half the
population lives in poverty.</p>
<p>Why is Egypt so much poorer than the United States? What are the
constraints that keep Egyptians from becoming more prosperous? Is the
poverty of Egypt immutable, or can it be eradicated? A natural way to
start thinking about this is to look at what the Egyptians themselves
are saying about the problems they face and why they rose up against the
Mubarak regime. Noha Hamed, twenty-four, a worker at an advertising
agency in Cairo, made her views clear as she demonstrated in Tahrir
Square: “We are suffering from corruption, oppression and bad education.
We are living amid a corrupt system which has to change.” Another in the
square, Mosaab El Shami, twenty, a pharmacy student, concurred: “I hope
that by the end of this year we will have an elected government and that
universal freedoms are applied and that we put an end to the corruption
that has taken over this country.” The protestors in Tahrir Square spoke
with one voice about the corruption of the government, its inability to
deliver public services, and the lack of equality of opportunity in
their country. They particularly complained about repression and the
absence of political rights. As Mohamed ElBaradei, former director of
the International Atomic Energy Agency, wrote on Twitter on January 13,
2011, “Tunisia: repression + absence of social justice + denial of
channels for peaceful change = a ticking bomb.” Egyptians and Tunisians
both saw their economic problems as being fundamentally caused by their
lack of political rights. When the protestors started to formulate their
demands more systematically, the first twelve immediate demands posted
by Wael Khalil, the software engineer and blogger who emerged as one of
the leaders of the Egyptian protest movement, were all focused on
political change. Issues such as raising the minimum wage appeared only
among the transitional demands that were to be implemented later.</p>
<p>To Egyptians, the things that have held them back include an
ineffective and corrupt state and a society where they cannot use their
talent, ambition, ingenuity, and what education they can get. But they
also recognize that the roots of these problems are political. All the
economic impediments they face stem from the way political power in
Egypt is exercised and monopolized by a narrow elite. This, they
understand, is the first thing that has to change.</p>
<p>Yet, in believing this, the protestors of Tahrir Square have sharply
diverged from the conventional wisdom on this topic. When they reason
about why a country such as Egypt is poor, most academics and
commentators emphasize completely different factors. Some stress that
Egypt’s poverty is determined primarily by its geography, by the fact
that the country is mostly a desert and lacks adequate rainfall, and
that its soils and climate do not allow productive agriculture. Others
instead point to cultural attributes of Egyptians that are supposedly
inimical to economic development and prosperity. Egyptians, they argue,
lack the same sort of work ethic and cultural traits that have allowed
others to prosper, and instead have accepted Islamic beliefs that are
inconsistent with economic success. A third approach, the one dominant
among economists and policy pundits, is based on the notion that the
rulers of Egypt simply don’t know what is needed to make their country
prosperous, and have followed incorrect policies and strategies in the
past. If these rulers would only get the right advice from the right
advisers, the thinking goes, prosperity would follow. To these academics
and pundits, the fact that Egypt has been ruled by narrow elites
feathering their nests at the expense of society seems irrelevant to
understanding the country’s economic problems.</p>
<p>In this book we’ll argue that the Egyptians in Tahrir Square, not
most academics and commentators, have the right idea. In fact, Egypt is
poor precisely because it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have
organized society for their own benefit at the expense of the vast mass
of people. Political power has been narrowly concentrated, and has been
used to create great wealth for those who possess it, such as the 0
billion fortune apparently accumulated by ex-president Mubarak. The
losers have been the Egyptian people, as they only too well
understand.</p>
<p>We’ll show that this interpretation of Egyptian poverty, the people’s
interpretation, turns out to provide a general explanation for why poor
countries are poor. Whether it is North Korea, Sierra Leone, or
Zimbabwe, we’ll show that poor countries are poor for the same reason
that Egypt is poor. Countries such as Great Britain and the United
States became rich because their citizens overthrew the elites who
controlled power and created a society where political rights were much
more broadly distributed, where the government was accountable and
responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of people could take
advantage of economic opportunities. We’ll show that to understand why
there is such inequality in the world today we have to delve into the
past and study the historical dynamics of societies. We’ll see that the
reason that Britain is richer than Egypt is because in 1688, Britain (or
England, to be exact) had a revolution that transformed the politics and
thus the economics of the nation. People fought for and won more
political rights, and they used them to expand their economic
opportunities. The result was a fundamentally different political and
economic trajectory, culminating in the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution and the technologies it unleashed didn’t
spread to Egypt, as that country was under the control of the Ottoman
Empire, which treated Egypt in rather the same way as the Mubarak family
later did. Ottoman rule in Egypt was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte in
1798, but the country then fell under the control of British
colonialism, which had as little interest as the Ottomans in promoting
Egypt’s prosperity. Though the Egyptians shook off the Ottoman and
British empires and, in 1952, overthrew their monarchy, these were not
revolutions like that of 1688 in England, and rather than fundamentally
transforming politics in Egypt, they brought to power another elite as
disinterested in achieving prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the
Ottoman and British had been. In consequence, the basic structure of
society did not change, and Egypt stayed poor.</p>
<p>In this book we’ll study how these patterns reproduce themselves over
time and why sometimes they are altered, as they were in England in 1688
and in France with the revolution of 1789. This will help us to
understand if the situation in Egypt has changed today and whether the
revolution that overthrew Mubarak will lead to a new set of institutions
capable of bringing prosperity to ordinary Egyptians. Egypt has had
revolutions in the past that did not change things, because those who
mounted the revolutions simply took over the reins from those they’d
deposed and re-created a similar system. It is indeed difficult for
ordinary citizens to acquire real political power and change the way
their society works. But it is possible, and we’ll see how this happened
in England, France, and the United States, and also in Japan, Botswana,
and Brazil. Fundamentally it is a political transformation of this sort
that is required for a poor society to become rich. There is evidence
that this may be happening in Egypt. Reda Metwaly, another protestor in
Tahrir Square, argued, “Now you see Muslims and Christians together, now
you see old and young together, all wanting the same thing.” We’ll see
that such a broad movement in society was a key part of what happened in
these other political transformations. If we understand when and why
such transitions occur, we will be in a better position to evaluate when
we expect such movements to fail as they have often done in the past and
when we may hope that they will succeed and improve the lives of
millions.</p>
