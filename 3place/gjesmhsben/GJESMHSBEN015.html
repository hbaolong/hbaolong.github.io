<p>HOW TO WIN THE LOTTERY IN ZIMBABWE</p>
<p>IT WAS JANUARY 2000 in Harare, Zimbabwe. Master of Ceremonies Fallot
Chawawa was in charge of drawing the winning ticket for the national
lottery organized by a partly state-owned bank, the Zimbabwe Banking
Corporation (Zimbank). The lottery was open to all clients who had kept
five thousand or more Zimbabwe dollars in their accounts during December
1999. When Chawawa drew the ticket, he was dumfounded. As the public
statement of Zimbank put it, “Master of Ceremonies Fallot Chawawa could
hardly believe his eyes when the ticket drawn for the Z00,000 prize was
handed to him and he saw His Excellency RG Mugabe written on it.”</p>
<p>President Robert Mugabe, who had ruled Zimbabwe by hook or by crook,
and usually with an iron fist, since 1980, had won the lottery, which
was worth a hundred thousand Zimbabwe dollars, about five times the
annual per capita income of the country. Zimbank claimed that
Mr. Mugabe’s name had been drawn from among thousands of eligible
customers. What a lucky man! Needless to say he didn’t really need the
money. Mugabe had in fact only recently awarded himself and his cabinet
salary hikes of up to 200 percent.</p>
<p>The lottery ticket was just one more indication of Zimbabwe’s
extractive institutions. One could call this corruption, but it is just
a symptom of the institutional malaise in Zimbabwe. The fact that Mugabe
could even win the lottery if he wanted showed how much control he had
over matters in Zimbabwe, and gave the world a glimpse of the extent of
the country’s extractive institutions.</p>
<p>The most common reason why nations fail today is because they have
extractive institutions. Zimbabwe under Mugabe’s regime vividly
illustrates the economic and social consequences. Though the national
statistics in Zimbabwe are very unreliable, the best estimate is that by
2008, Zimbabwe’s per capita income was about half of what it was when
the country gained its independence in 1980. Dramatic as this sounds, it
does not in fact begin to capture the deterioration in living standards
in Zimbabwe. The state has collapsed and more or less stopped providing
any basic public services. In 2008–2009 the deterioration in the health
systems led to an outbreak of cholera across the country. As of January
10, 2010, there have been 98,741 reported cases and 4,293 deaths, making
it the deadliest cholera outbreak in Africa over the previous fifteen
years. In the meantime, mass unemployment has also reached unprecedented
levels. In early 2009, the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs claimed that the unemployment rate had hit an
incredible 94 percent.</p>
<p>The roots of many economic and political institutions in Zimbabwe, as
is the case for much of sub-Saharan Africa, can be traced back to the
colonial period. In 1890 Cecil Rhodes’s British South Africa Company
sent a military expedition into the then-kingdom of the Ndebele, based
in Matabeleland, and also into the neighboring Mashonaland. Their
superior weaponry quickly suppressed African resistance, and by 1901 the
colony of Southern Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, had been formed in the
area that is currently Zimbabwe. Now that the area was a privately owned
concession of the British South Africa Company, Rhodes anticipated
making money there through prospecting and mining for precious minerals.
The ventures never got off the ground, but the very rich farmlands began
attracting white migration. These settlers soon annexed much of the
land. By 1923 they had freed themselves from the rule of the British
South Africa Company and persuaded the British government to grant them
self-government. What then occurred is very similar to what had happened
in South Africa a decade or so previously. The 1913 Natives Land Act
(this page–this page) created a dual economy in South Africa. Rhodesia
passed very similar laws, and inspired by the South African model, a
white-only apartheid state was constructed soon after 1923.</p>
<p>As the European colonial empires collapsed in the late 1950s and
early 1960s, the white elite in Rhodesia, led by Ian Smith, comprising
possibly 5 percent of the population, declared independence from Britain
in 1965. Few international governments recognized Rhodesia’s
independence, and the United Nations levied economic and political
sanctions against it. The black citizens organized a guerrilla war from
bases in the neighboring countries of Mozambique and Zambia.
International pressure and the rebellion waged by the two main groups,
Mugabe’s ZANU (the Zimbabwe African National Union) and ZAPU (the
Zimbabwe African People’s Union), led by Joshua Nkomo, resulted in a
negotiated end to white rule. The state of Zimbabwe was created in
1980.</p>
<p>After independence, Mugabe quickly established his personal control.
He either violently eliminated his opponents or co-opted them. The most
egregious acts of violence happened in Matabeleland, the heartland of
support for ZAPU, where as many as twenty thousand people were killed in
the early 1980s. By 1987 ZAPU had merged with ZANU to create ZANU-PF,
and Joshua Nkomo was sidelined politically. Mugabe was able to rewrite
the constitution he had inherited as a part of the independence
negotiation, making himself president (he had started as prime
minister), abolishing white voter rolls that were part of the
independence agreement, and eventually, in 1990, getting rid of the
Senate altogether and introducing positions in the legislature that he
could nominate. A de facto one-party state headed by Mugabe was the
result.</p>
<p>Upon independence, Mugabe took over a set of extractive economic
institutions created by the white regime. These included a host of
regulations on prices and international trade, state-run industries, and
the obligatory agricultural marketing boards. State employment expanded
rapidly, with jobs given to supporters of ZANU-PF. The tight government
regulation of the economy suited the ZANU-PF elites because it made it
difficult for an independent class of African businessmen, who might
then have challenged the former’s political monopoly, to emerge. This
was very similar to the situation we saw in Ghana in the 1960s in
chapter 2 (this page–this page). Ironically, of course, this left whites
as the main business class. During this period the main strengths of the
white economy, particularly the highly productive agricultural export
sector, was left untouched. But this would last only until Mugabe became
unpopular.</p>
<p>The model of regulation and market intervention gradually became
unsustainable, and a process of institutional change, with the support
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, began in 1991
after a severe fiscal crisis. The deteriorating economic performance
finally led to the emergence of a serious political opposition to
ZANU-PF’s one-party rule: the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). The
1995 parliamentary elections were far from competitive. ZANU-PF won 81
percent of the vote and 118 out of the 120 seats. Fifty-five of these
members of Parliament were elected unopposed. The presidential election
the following year showed even more signs of irregularities and fraud.
Mugabe won 93 percent of the vote, but his two opponents, Abel Muzorewa
and Ndabaningi Sithole, had already withdrawn their candidacy prior to
the election, accusing the government of coercion and fraud.</p>
<p>After 2000, despite all the corruption, ZANU-PF’s grip was weakening.
It took only 49 percent of the popular vote, and only 63 seats. All were
contested by the MDC, who took every seat in the capital, Harare. In the
presidential election of 2002, Mugabe scraped home with only 56 percent
of the vote. Both sets of elections went ZANU-PF’s way only because of
violence and intimidation, coupled with electoral fraud.</p>
<p>The response of Mugabe to the breakdown of his political control was
to intensify both the repression and the use of government policies to
buy support. He unleashed a full-scale assault on white landowners.
Starting in 2000, he encouraged and supported an extensive series of
land occupations and expropriations. They were often led by war
veterans’ associations, groups supposedly comprised of former combatants
in the war of independence. Some of the expropriated land was given to
these groups, but much of it also went to the ZANU-PF elites. The
insecurity of property rights wrought by Mugabe and ZANU-PF led to a
collapse of agricultural output and productivity. As the economy
crumbled, the only thing left was to print money to buy support, which
led to enormous hyperinflation. In January 2009, it became legal to use
other currencies, such as the South African rand, and the Zimbabwean
dollar vanished from circulation, a worthless piece of paper.</p>
<p>What happened in Zimbabwe after 1980 was commonplace in sub-Saharan
Africa since independence. Zimbabwe inherited a set of highly extractive
political and economic institutions in 1980. For the first decade and a
half, these were maintained relatively untouched. While elections took
place, political institutions were anything but inclusive. Economic
institutions changed somewhat; for example, there was no longer explicit
discrimination against blacks. But on the whole the institutions
remained extractive, with the only difference being that instead of Ian
Smith and the whites doing the extracting, it was Robert Mugabe and the
ZANU-PF elites filling their pockets. Over time the institutions became
even more extractive, and incomes in Zimbabwe collapsed. The economic
and political failure in Zimbabwe is yet another manifestation of the
iron law of oligarchy—in this instance, with the extractive and
repressive regime of Ian Smith being replaced by the extractive,
corrupt, and repressive regime of Robert Mugabe. Mugabe’s fake lottery
win in 2000 was then simply the tip of a very corrupt and historically
shaped iceberg.</p>
<p>NATIONS FAIL TODAY because their extractive economic institutions do
not create the incentives needed for people to save, invest, and
innovate. Extractive political institutions support these economic
institutions by cementing the power of those who benefit from the
extraction. Extractive economic and political institutions, though their
details vary under different circumstances, are always at the root of
this failure. In many cases, for example, as we will see in Argentina,
Colombia, and Egypt, this failure takes the form of lack of sufficient
economic activity, because the politicians are just too happy to extract
resources or quash any type of independent economic activity that
threatens themselves and the economic elites. In some extreme cases, as
in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone, which we discuss next, extractive
institutions pave the way for complete state failure, destroying not
only law and order but also even the most basic economic incentives. The
result is economic stagnation and—as the recent history of Angola,
Cameroon, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Nepal,
Sierra Leone, Sudan, and Zimbabwe illustrates—civil wars, mass
displacements, famines, and epidemics, making many of these countries
poorer today than they were in the 1960s.</p>
<p>A CHILDREN’S CRUSADE?</p>
<p>On March 23, 1991, a group of armed men under the leadership of Foday
Sankoh crossed the border from Liberia into Sierra Leone and attacked
the southern frontier town of Kailahun. Sankoh, formerly a corporal in
the Sierra Leonean army, had been imprisoned after taking part in an
abortive coup against Siaka Stevens’s government in 1971. After being
released, he eventually ended up in Libya, where he entered a training
camp that the Libyan dictator Colonel Qaddafi ran for African
revolutionaries. There he met Charles Taylor, who was plotting to
overthrow the government in Liberia. When Taylor invaded Liberia on
Christmas Eve 1989, Sankoh was with him, and it was with a group of
Taylor’s men, mostly Liberians and Burkinabes (citizens of Burkina
Faso), that Sankoh invaded Sierra Leone. They called themselves the RUF,
the Revolutionary United Front, and they announced that they were there
to overthrow the corrupt and tyrannical government of the APC.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, Siaka Stevens and his All People’s
Congress, the APC, took over and intensified the extractive institutions
of colonial rule in Sierra Leone, just as Mugabe and ZANU-PF did in
Zimbabwe. By 1985, when Stevens, ill with cancer, brought in Joseph
Momoh to replace him, the economy was collapsing. Stevens, apparently
without irony, used to enjoy quoting the aphorism “The cow eats where it
is tethered.” And where Stevens had once eaten, Momoh now gorged. The
roads fell to pieces, and schools disintegrated. National television
broadcasts stopped in 1987, when the transmitter was sold by the
minister of information, and in 1989 a radio tower that relayed radio
signals outside Freetown fell down, ending transmissions outside the
capital. An analysis published in a newspaper in the capital city of
Freetown in 1995 rings very true:</p>
<p>by the end of Momoh’s rule he had stopped paying civil servants,
teachers and even Paramount Chiefs. Central government had collapsed,
and then of course we had border incursions, “rebels” and all the
automatic weapons pouring over the border from Liberia. The NPRC, the
“rebels” and the “sobels” [soldiers turned rebels] all amount to the
chaos one expects when government disappears. None of them are the
causes of our problems, but they are symptoms.</p>
<p>The collapse of the state under Momoh, once again a consequence of
the vicious circle unleashed by the extreme extractive institutions
under Stevens, meant that there was nothing to stop the RUF from coming
across the border in 1991. The state had no capacity to oppose it.
Stevens had already emasculated the military, because he worried they
might overthrow him. It was then easy for a relatively small number of
armed men to create chaos in most of the country. They even had a
manifesto called “Footpaths to Democracy,” which started with a quote
from the black intellectual Frantz Fanon: “Each generation must, out of
relative obscurity, discover its mission, fulfill it or betray it.” The
section “What Are We Fighting For?” begins:</p>
<p>We continue to fight because we are tired of being perpetual victims
of state sponsored poverty and human degradation visited on us by years
of autocratic rule and militarism. But, we shall exercise restraint and
continue to wait patiently at the rendezvous of peace—where we shall all
be winners. We are committed to peace, by any means necessary, but what
we are not committed to is becoming victims of peace. We know our cause
to be just and God/Allah will never abandon us in our struggle to
reconstruct a new Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Though Sankoh and other RUF leaders may have started with political
grievances, and the grievances of the people suffering under the APC’s
extractive institutions may have encouraged them to join the movement
early on, the situation quickly changed and spun out of control. The
“mission” of the RUF plunged the country into agony, as in the testimony
of a teenager from Geoma, in the south of Sierra Leone:</p>
<p>They gathered some of us … They chose some of our friends and killed
them, two of them. These were people whose fathers were the chiefs, and
they had soldiers’ boots and property in their houses. They were shot,
for no other reason than that they were accused of harbouring soldiers.
The chiefs were also killed—as part of the government. They chose
someone to be the new chief. They were still saying they had come to
free us from the APC. After a point, they were not choosing people to
kill, just shooting people.</p>
<p>In the first year of the invasion, any intellectual roots that the
RUF may have had were completely extinguished. Sankoh executed those who
criticized the mounting stream of atrocities. Soon, few voluntarily
joined the RUF. Instead they turned to forcible recruitment,
particularly of children. Indeed, all sides did this, including the
army. If the Sierra Leonean civil war was a crusade to build a better
society, in the end it was a children’s crusade. The conflict
intensified with massacres and massive human rights abuses, including
mass rapes and the amputation of hands and ears. When the RUF took over
areas, they also engaged in economic exploitation. It was most obvious
in the diamond mining areas, where they press-ganged people into diamond
mining, but was widespread elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>The RUF wasn’t alone in committing atrocities, massacres, and
organized forced labor. The government did so as well. Such was the
collapse of law and order that it became difficult for people to tell
who was a soldier and who was a rebel. Military discipline completely
vanished. By the time the war ended in 2001, probably eighty thousand
people had died and the whole country had been devastated. Roads,
houses, and buildings were entirely destroyed. Today, if you go to
Koidu, a major diamond-producing area in the east, you’ll still see rows
of burned-out houses scarred with bullet holes.</p>
<p>By 1991 the state in Sierra Leone had totally failed. Think of what
King Shyaam started with the Bushong (this page–this page): he set up
extractive institutions to cement his power and extract the output the
rest of society would produce. But even extractive institutions with
central authority concentrated in his hands were an improvement over the
situation without any law and order, central authority, or property
rights that characterized the Lele society on the other side of the
river Kasai. Such lack of order and central authority has been the fate
of many African nations in recent decades, partly because the process of
political centralization was historically delayed in much of sub-Saharan
Africa, but also because the vicious circle of extractive institutions
reversed any state centralization that existed, paving the way for state
failure.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone during her bloody civil war of ten years, from 1991 to
2001, was a typical case of a failed state. It started out as just
another country marred by extractive institutions, albeit of a
particularly vicious and inefficient type. Countries become failed
states not because of their geography or their culture, but because of
the legacy of extractive institutions, which concentrate power and
wealth in the hands of those controlling the state, opening the way for
unrest, strife, and civil war. Extractive institutions also directly
contribute to the gradual failing of the state by neglecting investment
in the most basic public services, exactly what happened in Sierra
Leone.</p>
<p>Extractive institutions that expropriate and impoverish the people
and block economic development are quite common in Africa, Asia, and
South America. Charles Taylor helped to start the civil war in Sierra
Leone while at the same time initiating a savage conflict in Liberia,
which led to state failure there, too. The pattern of extractive
institutions collapsing into civil war and state failure has happened
elsewhere in Africa; for example, in Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, Republic of Congo, Somalia,
Sudan, and Uganda. Extraction paves the way for conflict, not unlike the
conflict that the highly extractive institutions of the Maya city-states
generated almost a thousand years ago. Conflict precipitates state
failure. So another reason why nations fail today is that their states
fail. This, in turn, is a consequence of decades of rule under
extractive economic and political institutions.</p>
<p>WHO IS THE STATE?</p>
<p>The cases of Zimbabwe, Somalia, and Sierra Leone, even if typical of
poor countries in Africa, and perhaps even some in Asia, seem rather
extreme. Surely Latin American countries do not have failed states?
Surely their presidents are not brazen enough to win the lottery?</p>
<p>In Colombia, the Andean Mountains gradually merge to the north with a
large coastal plain that borders the Caribbean Ocean. Colombians call
this the tierra caliente, the “hot country,” as distinct from the Andean
world of the tierra fria, the “cold country.” For the last fifty years,
Colombia has been regarded by most political scientists and governments
as a democracy. The United States feels happy to negotiate a potential
free trade agreement with the country and pours all kinds of aid into
it, particularly military aid. After a short-lived military government,
which ended in 1958, elections have been regularly held, even though
until 1974 a pact rotated political power and the presidency between the
two traditional political parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals.
Still, this pact, the National Front, was itself ratified by the
Colombian people via a plebiscite, and this all seems democratic
enough.</p>
<p>Yet while Colombia has a long history of democratic elections, it
does not have inclusive institutions. Instead, its history has been
marred by violations of civil liberties, extrajudicial executions,
violence against civilians, and civil war. Not the sort of outcomes we
expect from a democracy. The civil war in Colombia is different from
that in Sierra Leone, where the state and society collapsed and chaos
reigned. But it is a civil war nonetheless and one that has caused far
more casualties. The military rule of the 1950s was itself partially in
response to a civil war known in Spanish simply as La Violencia, or “The
Violence.” Since that time quite a range of insurgent groups, mostly
communist revolutionaries, have plagued the countryside, kidnapping and
murdering. To avoid either of these unpleasant options in rural
Colombia, you have to pay the vacuna, literally “the vaccination,”
meaning that you have to vaccinate yourself against being murdered or
kidnapped by paying off some group of armed thugs each month.</p>
<p>Not all armed groups in Colombia are communists. In 1981 members of
the main communist guerrilla group in Colombia, the Fuerzas Armadas
Revolucionarias de Colombia (the FARC—the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia) kidnapped a dairy farmer, Jesus Castaño, who lived in a small
town called Amalfi in the hot country in the northeastern part of the
department of Antioquia. The FARC demanded a ransom amounting to ,500, a
small fortune in rural Colombia. The family raised it by mortgaging the
farm, but their father’s corpse was found anyway, chained to a tree.
Enough was enough for three of Castaño’s sons, Carlos, Fidel, and
Vicente. They founded a paramilitary group, Los Tangueros, to hunt down
members of the FARC and avenge this act. The brothers were good at
organizing, and soon their group grew and began to find a common
interest with other similar paramilitary groups that had developed from
similar causes. Colombians in many areas were suffering at the hands of
left-wing guerrillas, and right-wing paramilitaries formed in
opposition. Paramilitaries were being used by landowners to defend
themselves against the guerrillas, but they were also involved in drug
trafficking, extortion, and the kidnapping and murder of citizens.</p>
<p>By 1997 the paramilitaries, under the leadership of the Castaño
brothers, had managed to form a national organization for paramilitaries
called the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (the AUC—United Self-Defense
Forces of Colombia). The AUC expanded into large parts of the country,
particularly into the hot country, in the departments of Córdoba, Sucre,
Magdalena, and César. By 2001 the AUC may have had as many as thirty
thousand armed men at its disposal and was organized into different
blocks. In Córdoba, the paramilitary Bloque Catatumbo was led by
Salvatore Mancuso. As its power continued to grow, the AUC made a
strategic decision to get involved in politics. Paramilitaries and
politicians courted each other. Several of the leaders of the AUC
organized a meeting with prominent politicians in the town of Santa Fé
de Ralito in Córdoba. A joint document, a pact, calling for the
“refounding of the country” was issued and signed by leading members of
the AUC, such as “Jorge 40” (the nickname for Rodrigo Tovar Pupo),
Adolfo Paz (a nom de guerre for Diego Fernando “Don Berna” Murillo), and
Diego Vecino (real name: Edwar Cobo Téllez), along with politicians,
including national senators William Montes and Miguel de la Espriella.
By this point the AUC was running large tracts of Colombia, and it was
easy for them to fix who got elected in the 2002 elections for the
Congress and Senate. For example, in the municipality of San Onofre, in
Sucre, the election was arranged by the paramilitary leader Cadena
(“chain”). One eyewitness described what happened as follows:</p>
<p>The trucks sent by Cadena went around the neighborhoods,
corregimientos and rural areas of San Onofre picking people up.
According to some inhabitants … for the 2002 elections hundreds of
peasants were taken to the corregimiento Plan Parejo so they could see
the faces of the candidates they had to vote for in the parliamentarian
elections: Jairo Merlano for Senate and Muriel Benito Rebollo for
Congress.</p>
<p>Cadena put in a bag the names of the members of the municipal
council, took out two and said that he would kill them and other people
chosen randomly if Muriel did not win.</p>
<p>The threat seems to have worked: each candidate obtained forty
thousand votes in the whole of Sucre. It is no surprise that the mayor
of San Onofre signed the pact of Santa Fé de Ralito. Probably one-third
of the congressmen and senators owed their election in 2002 to
paramilitary support, and Map 20, which depicts the areas of Colombia
under paramilitary control, shows how widespread their hold was.
Salvatore Mancuso himself put it in an interview in the following
way:</p>
<p>35 percent of the Congress was elected in areas where there were
states of the Self-Defense groups, in those states we were the ones
collecting taxes, we delivered justice, and we had the military and
territorial control of the region and all the people who wanted to go
into politics had to come and deal with the political representatives we
had there.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine the effect of this extent of
paramilitary control of politics and society on economic institutions
and public policy. The expansion of the AUC was not a peaceful affair.
The group not only fought against the FARC, but also murdered innocent
civilians and terrorized and displaced hundreds of thousands of people
from their homes. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring
Centre (IDMC) of the Norwegian Refugee Council, in early 2010 around 10
percent of Colombia’s population, nearly 4.5 million people, was
internally displaced. The paramilitaries also, as Mancuso suggested,
took over the government and all its functions, except that the taxes
they collected were just expropriation for their own pockets. An
extraordinary pact between the paramilitary leader Martín Llanos (real
name: Héctor Germán Buitrago) and the mayors of the municipalities of
Tauramena, Aguazul, Maní, Villanueva, Monterrey, and Sabanalarga, in the
department of Casanare in eastern Colombia, lists the following rules to
which the mayors had to adhere by order of the “Paramilitary Peasants of
Casanare”:</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>Give 50 percent of the municipality budget to be managed by the
Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare.</p></li>
<li><p>10 percent of each and every contract of the municipality [to be
given to the Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare].</p></li>
<li><p>Mandatory assistance to all the meetings called by the
Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare.</p></li>
<li><p>Inclusion of the Paramilitary Peasants of Casanare in every
infrastructure project.</p></li>
<li><p>Affiliation to the new political party formed by the Paramilitary
Peasants of Casanare.</p></li>
<li><p>Accomplishment of his/hers governance program.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Casanare is not a poor department. On the contrary, it has the
highest level of per capita income of any Colombian department, because
it has significant oil deposits, just the kind of resources that attract
paramilitaries. In fact, once they gained power, the paramilitaries
intensified their systematic expropriation of property. Mancuso himself
reputedly accumulated 5 million worth of urban and rural property.
Estimates of land expropriated in Colombia by paramilitaries are as high
as 10 percent of all rural land.</p>
<p>Colombia is not a case of a failed state about to collapse. But it is
a state without sufficient centralization and with far-from-complete
authority over all its territory. Though the state is able to provide
security and public services in large urban areas such as Bogotá and
Barranquilla, there are significant parts of the country where it
provides few public services and almost no law and order. Instead,
alternative groups and people, such as Mancuso, control politics and
resources. In parts of the country, economic institutions function quite
well, and there are high levels of human capital and entrepreneurial
skill; in other parts the institutions are highly extractive, even
failing to provide a minimal degree of state authority.</p>
<p>It might be hard to understand how a situation like this can sustain
itself for decades, even centuries. But in fact, the situation has a
logic of its own, as a type of vicious circle. Violence and the absence
of centralized state institutions of this type enter into a symbiotic
relationship with politicians running the functional parts of the
society. The symbiotic relationship arises because national politicians
exploit the lawlessness in peripheral parts of the country, while
paramilitary groups are left to their own devices by the national
government.</p>
<p>This pattern became particularly apparent in the 2000s. In 2002 the
presidential election was won by Álvaro Uribe. Uribe had something in
common with the Castaño brothers: his father had been killed by the
FARC. Uribe ran a campaign repudiating the attempts of the previous
administration to try to make peace with the FARC. In 2002 his vote
share was 3 percentage points higher in areas with paramilitaries than
without them. In 2006, when he was reelected, his vote share was 11
percentage points higher in such areas. If Mancuso and his partners
could deliver the vote for Congress and the Senate, they could do so in
presidential elections as well, particularly for a president strongly
aligned with their worldview and likely to be lenient on them. As Jairo
Angarita, Salvatore Mancuso’s deputy and the former leader of the AUC’s
Sinú and San Jorge blocs, declared in September 2005, he was proud to
work for the “reelection of the best president we have ever had.”</p>
<p>Once elected, the paramilitary senators and congressmen voted for
what Uribe wanted, in particular changing the constitution so that he
could be reelected in 2006, which had not been allowed at the time of
his first election, in 2002. In exchange, President Uribe delivered a
highly lenient law that allowed the paramilitaries to demobilize.
Demobilization did not mean the end of paramilitarism, simply its
institutionalization in large parts of Colombia and the Colombian state,
which the paramilitaries had taken over and were allowed to keep.</p>
<p>In Colombia many aspects of economic and political institutions have
become more inclusive over time. But certain major extractive elements
remain. Lawlessness and insecure property rights are endemic in large
swaths of the country, and this is a consequence of the lack of control
by the national state in many parts of the country, and the particular
form of lack of state centralization in Colombia. But this state of
affairs is not an inevitable outcome. It is itself a consequence of
dynamics mirroring the vicious circle: political institutions in
Colombia do not generate incentives for politicians to provide public
services and law and order in much of the country and do not put enough
constraints on them to prevent them from entering into implicit or
explicit deals with paramilitaries and thugs.</p>
<p>EL CORRALITO</p>
<p>Argentina was in the grip of an economic crisis in late 2001. For
three years, income had been falling, unemployment had been rising, and
the country had accumulated a massive international debt. The policies
leading to this situation were adopted after 1989 by the government of
Carlos Menem, to stop hyperinflation and stabilize the economy. For a
time they were successful.</p>
<p>In 1991 Menem tied the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar. One peso
was equal to one dollar by law. There was to be no change in the
exchange rate. End of story. Well, almost. To convince people that the
government really meant to stick to the law, it persuaded people to open
bank accounts in U.S. dollars. Dollars could be used in the shops of the
capital city of Buenos Aires and withdrawn from cash machines all over
the city. This policy may have helped stabilize the economy, but it had
one big drawback. It made Argentine exports very expensive and foreign
imports very cheap. Exports dribbled to a halt; imports gushed in. The
only way to pay for them was to borrow. It was an unsustainable
situation. As more people began worrying about the sustainability of the
peso, they put more of their wealth into dollar accounts at banks. After
all, if the government ripped up the law and devalued the peso, they
would be safe with dollar accounts, right? They were right to be worried
about the peso. But they were too optimistic about their dollars.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2001, the government froze all bank accounts,
initially for ninety days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed for
withdrawal on a weekly basis. First it was 250 pesos, still worth 50;
then 300 pesos. But this was allowed to be withdrawn only from peso
accounts. Nobody was allowed to withdraw money from their dollar
accounts, unless they agreed to convert the dollars into pesos. Nobody
wanted to do so. Argentines dubbed this situation El Corralito, “the
Little Corral”: depositors were hemmed into a corral like cows, with
nowhere to go. In January the devaluation was finally enacted, and
instead of there being one peso for one dollar, there were soon four
pesos for one dollar. This should have been a vindication of those who
thought that they should put their savings in dollars. But it wasn’t,
because the government then forcibly converted all the dollar bank
accounts into pesos, but at the old one-for-one exchange rate. Someone
who had had ,000 saved suddenly found himself with only 50. The
government had expropriated three-quarters of people’s savings.</p>
<p>For economists, Argentina is a perplexing country. To illustrate how
difficult it was to understand Argentina, the Nobel Prize–winning
economist Simon Kuznets once famously remarked that there were four
sorts of countries: developed, underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina.
Kuznets thought so because, around the time of the First World War,
Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world. It then began a
steady decline relative to the other rich countries in Western Europe
and North America, which turned, in the 1970s and ’80s, into an absolute
decline. On the surface of it, Argentina’s economic performance is
puzzling, but the reasons for its decline become clearer when looked at
through the lens of inclusive and extractive institutions.</p>
<p>It is true that before 1914, Argentina experienced around fifty years
of economic growth, but this was a classic case of growth under
extractive institutions. Argentina was then ruled by a narrow elite
heavily invested in the agricultural export economy. The economy grew by
exporting beef, hides, and grain in the middle of a boom in the world
prices of these commodities. Like all such experiences of growth under
extractive institutions, it involved no creative destruction and no
innovation. And it was not sustainable. Around the time of the First
World War, mounting political instability and armed revolts induced the
Argentine elites to try to broaden the political system, but this led to
the mobilization of forces they could not control, and in 1930 came the
first military coup. Between then and 1983, Argentina oscillated
backward and forward between dictatorship and democracy and between
various extractive institutions. There was mass repression under
military rule, which peaked in the 1970s with at least nine thousand
people and probably far more being illegally executed. Hundreds of
thousands were imprisoned and tortured.</p>
<p>During the periods of civilian rule there were elections—a democracy
of sorts. But the political system was far from inclusive. Since the
rise of Perón in the 1940s, democratic Argentina has been dominated by
the political party he created, the Partido Justicialista, usually just
called the Perónist Party. The Perónists won elections thanks to a huge
political machine, which succeeded by buying votes, dispensing
patronage, and engaging in corruption, including government contracts
and jobs in exchange for political support. In a sense this was a
democracy, but it was not pluralistic. Power was highly concentrated in
the Perónist Party, which faced few constraints on what it could do, at
least in the period when the military restrained from throwing it from
power. As we saw earlier (this page–this page), if the Supreme Court
challenged a policy, so much the worse for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In the 1940s, Perón had cultivated the labor movement as a political
base. When it was weakened by military repression in the 1970s and ’80s,
his party simply switched to buying votes from others instead. Economic
policies and institutions were designed to deliver income to their
supporters, not to create a level playing field. When President Menem
faced a term limit that kept him from being reelected in the 1990s, it
was just more of the same; he could simply rewrite the constitution and
get rid of the term limit. As El Corralito shows, even if Argentina has
elections and popularly elected governments, the government is quite
able to override property rights and expropriate its own citizens with
impunity. There is little check on Argentine presidents and political
elites, and certainly no pluralism.</p>
<p>What puzzled Kuznets, and no doubt many others who visit Buenos
Aires, is that the city seems so different from Lima, Guatemala City, or
even Mexico City. You do not see indigenous people, and you do not see
the descendants of former slaves. Mostly you see the glorious
architecture and buildings put up during the Belle Epoch, the years of
growth under extractive institutions. But in Buenos Aires you see only
part of Argentina. Menem, for example, was not from Buenos Aires. He was
born in Anillaco, in the province of La Rioja, in the mountains far to
the northwest of Buenos Aires, and he served three terms as governor of
the province. At the time of the conquest of the Americas by the
Spanish, this area of Argentina was an outlying part of the Inca Empire
and had a dense population of indigenous people (see Map 1 on this
page). The Spanish created encomiendas here, and a highly extractive
economy developed growing food and breeding mules for the miners in
Potosí to the north. In fact, La Rioja was much more like the area of
Potosí in Peru and Bolivia than it was like Buenos Aires. In the
nineteenth century, La Rioja produced the famous warlord Facundo
Quiroga, who ruled the area lawlessly and marched his army on Buenos
Aires. The story about the development of Argentine political
institutions is a story about how the interior provinces, such as La
Rioja, reached agreements with Buenos Aires. These agreements were a
truce: the warlords of La Rioja agreed to leave Buenos Aires alone so
that it could make money. In return, the Buenos Aires elites gave up on
reforming the institutions of “the interior.” So Argentina at first
appears a world apart from Peru or Bolivia, but it is really not so
different once you leave the elegant boulevards of Buenos Aires. That
the preferences and the politics of the interior got embedded into
Argentine institutions is the reason why the country has experienced a
very similar institutional path to those of other extractive Latin
American countries.</p>
<p>That elections have not brought either inclusive political or
economic institutions is the typical case in Latin America. In Colombia,
paramilitaries can fix one-third of national elections. In Venezuela
today, as in Argentina, the democratically elected government of Hugo
Chávez attacks its opponents, fires them from public-sector jobs, closes
down newspapers whose editorials it doesn’t like, and expropriates
property. In whatever he does, Chávez is much more powerful and less
constrained than Sir Robert Walpole was in Britain in the 1720s, when he
was unable to condemn John Huntridge under the Black Act (this page–this
page). Huntridge would have fared much less well in present-day
Venezuela or Argentina.</p>
<p>While the democracy emerging in Latin America is in principle
diametrically opposed to elite rule, and in rhetoric and action it tries
to redistribute rights and opportunities away from at least a segment of
the elite, its roots are firmly based in extractive regimes in two
senses. First, inequities persisting for centuries under extractive
regimes make voters in newly emerging democracies vote in favor of
politicians with extreme policies. It is not that Argentinians are just
naïve and think that Juan Perón or the more recent Perónist politicians
such as Menem or the Kirchners are selfless and looking out for their
interests, or that Venezuelans see their salvation in Chávez. Instead,
many Argentinians and Venezuelans recognize that all other politicians
and parties have for so long failed to give them voice, to provide them
with the most basic public services, such as roads and education, and to
protect them from exploitation by local elites. So many Venezuelans
today support the policies that Chávez is adopting even if these come
with corruption and waste in the same way that many Argentinians
supported Perón’s policies in the 1940s and 1970s. Second, it is again
the underlying extractive institutions that make politics so attractive
to, and so biased in favor of, strongmen such as Perón and Chávez,
rather than an effective party system producing socially desirable
alternatives. Perón, Chávez, and dozens of other strongmen in Latin
America are just another facet of the iron law of oligarchy, and as the
name suggests, the roots of this iron law lies in the underlying
elite-controlled regimes.</p>
<p>THE NEW ABSOLUTISM</p>
<p>In November 2009, the government of North Korea implemented what
economists call a currency reform. Severe bouts of inflation are often
the reasons for such reforms. In France in January 1960, a currency
reform introduced a new franc that was equal to 100 of the existing
francs. Old francs continued in circulation and people even quoted
prices in them as the change to the new francs was gradually made.
Finally, old francs ceased to be legal tender in January 2002, when
France introduced the euro. The North Korean reform looked similar on
the face of it. Like the French in 1960, the North Korean government
decided to take two zeros off the currency. One hundred old wons, the
currency of North Korea, were to be worth one new won. Individuals were
allowed to come forward to exchange their old currency for the newly
printed currency, though this had to be done in one week, rather than
forty-two years, as in the French case. Then came the catch: the
government announced that no one could convert more than 100,000 won,
though it later relaxed this to 500,000. One hundred thousand won was
about 0 at the black market exchange rate. In one stroke, the government
had wiped out a huge fraction of North Korean citizens’ private wealth;
we do not know exactly how much, but it is probably greater than that
expropriated by the Argentine government in 2002.</p>
<p>The government in North Korea is a communist dictatorship opposed to
private property and markets. But it is difficult to control black
markets, and black markets make transactions in cash. Of course quite a
bit of foreign exchange is involved, particularly Chinese currency, but
many transactions use won. The currency reform was designed to punish
people who used these markets and, more specifically, to make sure that
they did not become too wealthy or powerful enough to threaten the
regime. Keeping them poor was safer. Black markets are not the whole
story. People in North Korea also keep their savings in wons because
there are few banks in Korea, and they are all owned by the government.
In effect, the government used the currency reform to expropriate much
of people’s savings.</p>
<p>Though the government says it regards markets as bad, the North
Korean elite rather like what markets can produce for them. The leader,
Kim Jong-Il, has a seven-story pleasure palace equipped with a bar, a
karaoke machine, and a mini movie theater. The ground floor has an
enormous swimming pool with a wave machine, where Kim likes to use a
body board fitted with a small motor. When in 2006 the United States
placed sanctions on North Korea, it knew how to really hit the regime
where it hurt. It made it illegal to export more than sixty luxury items
to North Korea, including yachts, water scooters, racing cars,
motorcycles, DVD players, and televisions larger than twenty-nine
inches. There would be no more silk scarves, designer fountain pens,
furs, or leather luggage. These were exactly the items collected by Kim
and his Communist Party elites. One scholar used sales figures from the
French company Hennessy to estimate that Kim’s annual cognac budget
before the sanctions could have been as high as 00,000 a year.</p>
<p>It is impossible to understand many of the poorest regions of the
world at the end of the twentieth century without understanding the new
absolutism of the twentieth century: communism. Marx’s vision was a
system that would generate prosperity under more humane conditions and
without inequality. Lenin and his Communist Party were inspired by Marx,
but the practice could not have been more different from the theory. The
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was a bloody affair, and there was no
humane aspect to it. Equality was not part of the equation, either,
since the first thing Lenin and his entourage did was to create a new
elite, themselves, at the head of the Bolshevik Party. In doing so, they
purged and murdered not only non-communist elements, but also other
communists who could have threatened their power. But the real tragedies
were yet to come: first with the Civil War, and then under Stalin’s
collectivization and his all-too-frequent purges, which may have killed
as many as forty million people. Russian communism was brutal,
repressive, and bloody, but not unique. The economic consequences and
the human suffering were quite typical of what happened elsewhere—for
example, in Cambodia in the 1970s under the Khmer Rouge, in China, and
in North Korea. In all cases communism brought vicious dictatorships and
widespread human rights abuses. Beyond the human suffering and carnage,
the communist regimes all set up various types of extractive
institutions. The economic institutions, with or without markets, were
designed to extract resources from the people, and by entirely abhorring
property rights, they often created poverty instead of prosperity. In
the Soviet case, as we saw in chapter 5, the Communist system at first
generated rapid growth, but then faltered and led to stagnation. The
consequences were much more devastating in China under Mao, in Cambodia
under the Khmer Rouge, and in North Korea, where the Communist economic
institutions led to economic collapse and famine.</p>
<p>The Communist economic institutions were in turn supported by
extractive political institutions, concentrating all power in the hands
of Communist parties and introducing no constraints on the exercise of
this power. Though these were different extractive institutions in form,
they had similar effects on the livelihoods of the people as the
extractive institutions in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>KING COTTON</p>
<p>Cotton accounts for about 45 percent of the exports of Uzbekistan,
making it the most important crop since the country established
independence at the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Under Soviet
communism all farmland in Uzbekistan was under the control of 2,048
state-owned farms. These were broken up and the land distributed after
1991. But that didn’t mean farmers could act independently. Cotton was
too valuable to the new government of Uzbekistan’s first, and so far
only, president, Ismail Karimov. Instead, regulations were introduced
that determined what farmers could plant and exactly how much they could
sell it for. Cotton was a valuable export, and farmers were paid a small
fraction of world market prices for their crop, with the government
taking the rest. Nobody would have grown cotton at the prices paid, so
the government forced them. Every farmer now has to allocate 35 percent
of his land to cotton. This caused many problems, difficulties with
machinery being one. At the time of independence, about 40 percent of
the harvest was picked by combine harvesters. After 1991, not
surprisingly, given the incentives that President Karimov’s regime
created for farmers, they were not willing to buy these or maintain
them. Recognizing the problem, Karimov came up with a solution, in fact,
a cheaper option than combine harvesters: schoolchildren.</p>
<p>The cotton bolls start to ripen and are ready to be picked in early
September, at about the same time that children return to school.
Karimov issued orders to local governors to send cotton delivery quotas
to schools. In early September the schools are emptied of 2.7 million
children (2006 figures). Teachers, instead of being instructors, became
labor recruiters. Gulnaz, a mother of two of these children, explained
what happens:</p>
<p>At the beginning of each school year, approximately at the beginning
of September, the classes in school are suspended, and instead of
classes children are sent to the cotton harvest. Nobody asks for the
consent of parents. They don’t have weekend holidays [during the
harvesting season]. If a child is for any reason left at home, his
teacher or class curator comes over and denounces the parents. They
assign a plan to each child, from 20 to 60 kg per day depending on the
child’s age. If a child fails to fulfil this plan then next morning he
is lambasted in front of the whole class.</p>
<p>The harvest lasts for two months. Rural children lucky enough to be
assigned to farms close to home can walk or are bused to work. Children
farther away or from urban areas have to sleep in the sheds or
storehouses with the machinery and animals. There are no toilets or
kitchens. Children have to bring their own food for lunch.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries from all this forced labor are the political
elites, led by President Karimov, the de facto king of all Uzbeki
cotton. The schoolchildren are supposedly paid for their labor, but only
supposedly. In 2006, when the world price of cotton was around .40
(U.S.) per kilo, the children were paid about 1.sh.03 for their daily
quota of twenty to sixty kilos. Probably 75 percent of the cotton
harvest is now picked by children. In the spring, school is closed for
compulsory hoeing, weeding, and transplanting.</p>
<p>How did it all come to this? Uzbekistan, like the other Soviet
Socialist Republics, was supposed to gain its independence after the
collapse of the Soviet Union and develop a market economy and democracy.
As in many other Soviet Republics, this is not what happened, however.
President Karimov, who began his political career in the Communist Party
of the old Soviet Union, rising to the post of first secretary for
Uzbekistan at the opportune moment of 1989, just as the Berlin Wall was
collapsing, managed to reinvent himself as a nationalist. With the
crucial support of the security forces, in December 1991 he won
Uzbekistan’s first-ever presidential election. After taking power, he
cracked down on the independent political opposition. Opponents are now
in prison or exile. There is no free media in Uzbekistan, and no
nongovernmental organizations are allowed. The apogee of the
intensifying repression came in 2005, when possibly 750, maybe more,
demonstrators were murdered by the police and army in Andijon.</p>
<p>Using this command of the security forces and total control of the
media, Karimov first extended his presidential term for five years,
through a referendum, and then won reelection for a new seven-year term
in 2000, with 91.2 percent of the vote. His only opponent declared that
he had voted for Karimov! In his 2007 reelection, widely regarded as
fraudulent, he won 88 percent of the vote. Elections in Uzbekistan are
similar to those that Joseph Stalin used to organize in the heyday of
the Soviet Union. One in 1937 was famously covered by New York Times
correspondent Harold Denny, who reproduced a translation from Pravda,
the newspaper of the Communist Party, which was meant to convey the
tension and excitement of Soviet elections:</p>
<p>Midnight has struck. The twelfth of December, the day of the first
general, equal and direct elections to the Supreme Soviet, has ended.
The result of the voting is about to be announced.</p>
<p>The commission remains alone in its room. It is quiet, and the lamps
are shining solemnly. Amid the general attentive and intense expectation
the chairman performs all the necessary formalities before counting of
the ballots—checking up by list how many voters there were and how many
have voted—and the result is 100 per cent. 100 per cent! What election
in what country for what candidate has given a 100 per cent
response?</p>
<p>The main business starts now. Excitedly the chairman inspects the
seals on the boxes. Then the members of the commission inspect them. The
seals are intact and are cut off. The boxes are opened.</p>
<p>It is quiet. They sit attentively and seriously, these election
inspectors and executives.</p>
<p>Now it is time to open the envelopes. Three members of the commission
take scissors. The chairman rises. The tellers have their copybooks
ready. The first envelope is slit. All eyes are directed to it. The
chairman takes out two slips—white [for a candidate for the Soviet of
the Union] and blue [for a candidate for the Soviet of
Nationalities]—and reads loudly and distinctly, “Comrade Stalin.”</p>
<p>Instantly the solemnity is broken. Everybody in the room jumps up and
applauds joyously and stormily for the first ballot of the first general
secret election under the Stalinist Constitution—a ballot with the name
of the Constitution’s creator.</p>
<p>This mood would have captured the suspense surrounding the
reelections of Karimov, who appears an apt pupil of Stalin when it comes
to repression and political control and seems to organize elections that
compete with those of Stalin in their surrealism.</p>
<p>Under Karimov, Uzbekistan is a country with very extractive political
and economic institutions. And it is poor. Probably one-third of the
people live in poverty, and the average annual income is around ,000.
Not all the development indicators are bad. According to World Bank
data, school enrollment is 100 percent … well, except possibly during
the cotton picking season. Literacy is also very high, though apart from
controlling all the media, the regime also bans books and censors the
Internet. While most people are paid only a few cents a day to pick
cotton, the Karimov family and former communist cadres who reinvented
themselves after 1989 as the new economic and political elites of
Uzbekistan have become fabulously wealthy.</p>
<p>The family economic interests are run by Karimov’s daughter Gulnora,
who is expected to succeed her father as president. In a country so
untransparent and secretive, nobody knows exactly what the Karimov
family controls or how much money they earn, but the experience of the
U.S. company Interspan is indicative of what has happened in the Uzbek
economy in the last two decades. Cotton is not the only agricultural
crop; parts of the country are ideal for growing tea, and Interspan
decided to invest. By 2005 it had taken over 30 percent of the local
market, but then it ran into trouble. Gulnora decided that the tea
industry looked economically promising. Soon Interspan’s local personnel
started to be arrested, beaten up, and tortured. It became impossible to
operate, and by August 2006 the company had pulled out. Its assets were
taken over by the Karimov families’ rapidly expanding tea interests, at
the time representing 67 percent of the market, up from 2 percent a

<p>Uzbekistan in many ways looks like a relic from the past, a forgotten
age. It is a country languishing under the absolutism of a single family
and the cronies surrounding them, with an economy based on forced
labor—in fact, the forced labor of children. Except that it isn’t. It’s
part of the current mosaic of societies failing under extractive
institutions, and unfortunately it has many commonalities with other
former Soviet Socialist Republics, ranging from Armenia and Azerbaijan
to Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, and reminds us that even in
the twenty-first century, extractive economic and political institutions
can take an unashamed atrociously extractive form.</p>
<p>KEEPING THE PLAYING FIELD AT AN ANGLE</p>
<p>The 1990s were a period of reform in Egypt. Since the military coup
that removed the monarchy in 1954, Egypt had been run as a
quasi-socialist society in which the government played a central role in
the economy. Many sectors of the economy were dominated by state-owned
enterprises. Over the years, the rhetoric of socialism lapsed, markets
opened, and the private sector developed. Yet these were not inclusive
markets, but markets controlled by the state and by a handful of
businessmen allied with the National Democratic Party (NDP), the
political party founded by President Anwar Sadat in 1978. Businessmen
became more and more involved with the party, and the party became more
and more involved with them under the government of Hosni Mubarak.
Mubarak, who became president in 1981 following Anwar Sadat’s
assassination, ruled with the NDP until being forced from power by
popular protests and the military in February 2011, as we discussed in
the Preface (this page).</p>
<p>Major businesspeople were appointed to key government posts in areas
closely related to their economic interests. Rasheed Mohamed Rasheed,
former president of Unilever AMET (Africa, Middle East, and Turkey),
became minister of foreign trade and industry; Mohamed Zoheir Wahid
Garana, the owner and managing director of Garana Travel Company, one of
the largest in Egypt, became minister of tourism; Amin Ahmed Mohamed
Osman Abaza, founder of the Nile Cotton Trade Company, the largest
cotton-exporting company in Egypt, became minister of agriculture.</p>
<p>In many sectors of the economy, businessmen persuaded the government
to restrict entry through state regulation. These sectors included the
media, iron and steel, the automotive industry, alcoholic beverages, and
cement. Each sector was very concentrated with high entry barriers
protecting the politically connected businessmen and firms. Big
businessmen close to the regime, such as Ahmed Ezz (iron and steel), the
Sawiris family (multimedia, beverages, and telecommunications), and
Mohamed Nosseir (beverages and telecommunications) received not only
protection from the state but also government contracts and large bank
loans without needing to put up collateral. Ahmed Ezz was both the
chairman of Ezz Steel, the largest company in the country’s steel
industry, producing 70 percent of Egypt’s steel, and also a high-ranking
member of the NDP, the chairman of the People’s Assembly Budget and
Planning Committee, and a close associate of Gamal Mubarak, one of
President Mubarak’s sons.</p>
<p>The economic reforms of the 1990s promoted by international financial
institutions and economists were aimed at freeing up markets and
reducing the role of the state in the economy. A key pillar of such
reforms everywhere was the privatization of state-owned assets. Mexican
privatization (this page–this page), instead of increasing competition,
simply turned state-owned monopolies into privately owned monopolies, in
the process enriching politically connected businessmen such as Carlos
Slim. Exactly the same thing took place in Egypt. The businesspeople
connected to the regime were able to heavily influence implementation of
Egypt’s privatization program so that it favored the wealthy business
elite—or the “whales,” as they are known locally. At the time that
privatization began, the economy was dominated by thirty-two of these
whales.</p>
<p>One was Ahmed Zayat, at the helm of the Luxor Group. In 1996 the
government decided to privatize Al Ahram beverages (ABC), which was the
monopoly maker of beer in Egypt. A bid came in from a consortium of the
Egyptian Finance Company, led by real estate developer Farid Saad, along
with the first venture capital company formed in Egypt in 1995. The
consortium included Fouad Sultan, former minister of tourism, Mohamed
Nosseir, and Mohamed Ragab, another elite businessman. The group was
well connected, but not well connected enough. Its bid of 400 million
Egyptian pounds was turned down as too low. Zayat was better connected.
He didn’t have the money to purchase ABC, so he came up with a scheme of
Carlos Slim–type ingenuity. ABC shares were floated for the first time
on the London Stock Exchange, and the Luxor Group acquired 74.9 percent
of those shares at 68.5 Egyptian pounds per share. Three months later
the shares were then split in two, and the Luxor Group was able to sell
all of them at 52.5 pounds each, netting a 36 percent profit, with which
Zayat was able to fund the purchase of ABC for 231 million pounds the
next month. At the time, ABC was making an annual profit of around 41.3
million Egyptian pounds and had cash reserves of 93 million Egyptian
pounds. It was quite a bargain. In 1999 the newly privatized ABC
extended its monopoly from beer into wine by buying the privatized
national wine monopoly Gianaclis. Gianaclis was a very profitable
company, nestling behind a 3,000 percent tariff imposed on imported
wines, and it had a 70 percent profit margin on what it sold. In 2002
the monopoly changed hands again when Zayat sold ABC to Heineken for 1.3
billion Egyptian pounds. A 563 percent profit in five years.</p>
<p>Mohamed Nosseir hadn’t always been on the losing side. In 1993 he
purchased the privatized El Nasr Bottling Company, which had the
monopoly rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola in Egypt. Nosseir’s
relations with the then-minister of the public business sector, Atef
Ebeid, allowed him to make the purchase with little competition. Nosseir
then sold the company after two years for more than three times the
acquisition price. Another example was the move in the late 1990s to
involve the private sector in the state cinema industry. Again political
connections implied that only two families were allowed to bid for and
operate the cinemas—one of whom was the Sawiris family.</p>
<p>Egypt today is a poor nation—not as poor as most countries to the
south, in sub-Saharan Africa, but still one where around 40 percent of
the population is very poor and lives on less than two dollars a day.
Ironically, as we saw earlier (this page–this page), in the nineteenth
century Egypt was the site of an initially successful attempt at
institutional change and economic modernization under Muhammad Ali, who
did generate a period of extractive economic growth before it was
effectively annexed to the British Empire. From the British colonial
period a set of extractive institutions emerged, and were continued by
the military after 1954. There was some economic growth and investment
in education, but the majority of the population had few economic
opportunities, while the new elite could benefit from their connections
to the government.</p>
<p>These extractive economic institutions were again supported by
extractive political institutions. President Mubarak planned to begin a
political dynasty, grooming his son Gamal to replace him. His plan was
cut short only by the collapse of his extractive regime in early 2011 in
the face of widespread unrest and demonstrations during the so-called
Arab Spring. During the period when Nasser was president, there were
some inclusive aspects of economic institutions, and the state did open
up the education system and provide some opportunities that the previous
regime of King Farouk had not. But this was an example of an unstable
combination of extractive political institutions with some inclusivity
of economic institutions.</p>
<p>The inevitable outcome, which came during Mubarak’s reign, was that
economic institutions became more extractive, reflecting the
distribution of political power in society. In some sense the Arab
Spring was a reaction to this. This was true not just in Egypt but also
in Tunisia. Three decades of Tunisian growth under extractive political
institutions started to go into reverse as President Ben Ali and his
family began to prey more and more on the economy.</p>
<p>WHY NATIONS FAIL</p>
<p>Nations fail economically because of extractive institutions. These
institutions keep poor countries poor and prevent them from embarking on
a path to economic growth. This is true today in Africa, in places such
as Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone; in South America, in countries such as
Colombia and Argentina; in Asia, in countries such as North Korea and
Uzbekistan; and in the Middle East, in nations such as Egypt. There are
notable differences among these countries. Some are tropical, some are
in temperate latitudes. Some were colonies of Britain; others, of Japan,
Spain, and Russia. They have very different histories, languages, and
cultures. What they all share is extractive institutions. In all these
cases the basis of these institutions is an elite who design economic
institutions in order to enrich themselves and perpetuate their power at
the expense of the vast majority of people in society. The different
histories and social structures of the countries lead to the differences
in the nature of the elites and in the details of the extractive
institutions. But the reason why these extractive institutions persist
is always related to the vicious circle, and the implications of these
institutions in terms of impoverishing their citizens are similar—even
if their intensity differs.</p>
<p>In Zimbabwe, for example, the elite comprise Robert Mugabe and the
core of ZANU-PF, who spearheaded the anticolonial fight in the 1970s. In
North Korea, they are the clique around Kim Jong-Il and the Communist
Party. In Uzbekistan it is President Islam Karimov, his family, and his
reinvented Soviet Union–era cronies. These groups are obviously very
different, and these differences, along with the variegated polities and
economies they govern, mean that the specific form the extractive
institutions take differs. For instance, because North Korea was created
by a communist revolution, it takes as its political model the one-party
rule of the Communist Party. Though Mugabe did invite the North Korean
military into Zimbabwe in the 1980s to massacre his opponents in
Matabeleland, such a model for extractive political institutions is not
applicable in Zimbabwe. Instead, because of the way he came to power in
the anticolonial struggle, Mugabe had to cloak his rule with elections,
even if for a while he managed actually to engineer a constitutionally
sanctified one-party state.</p>
<p>In contrast, Colombia has had a long history of elections, which
emerged historically as a method for sharing power between the Liberal
and Conservative parties in the wake of independence from Spain. Not
only is the nature of elites different, but their numbers are. In
Uzbekistan, Karimov could hijack the remnants of the Soviet state, which
gave him a strong apparatus to suppress and murder alternative elites.
In Colombia, the lack of authority of the central state in parts of the
country has naturally led to much more fragmented elites—in fact, so
much so that they sometimes murder one another. Nevertheless, despite
these variegated elites and political institutions, these institutions
often manage to cement and reproduce the power of the elite that created
them. But sometimes the infighting they induce leads to the collapse of
the state, as in Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>Just as different histories and structures mean that the identity of
elites and the details of extractive political institutions differ, so
do the details of the extractive economic institutions that the elites
set up. In North Korea, the tools of extraction were again inherited
from the communist toolkit: the abolition of private property, state-run
farms, and industry.</p>
<p>In Egypt, the situation was quite similar under the avowedly
socialist military regime created by Colonel Nasser after 1952. Nasser
sided with the Soviet Union in the cold war, expropriating foreign
investments, such as the British-owned Suez Canal, and took into public
ownership much of the economy. However, the situation in Egypt in the
1950s and ’60s was very different from that in North Korea in the 1940s.
It was much easier for the North Koreans to create a more radically
communist-style economy, since they could expropriate former Japanese
assets and build on the economic model of the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Egyptian Revolution was more a coup by a group of
military officers. When Egypt changed sides in the cold war and became
pro-Western, it was therefore relatively easy, as well as expedient, for
the Egyptian military to change from central command to crony capitalism
as a method of extraction. Even so, the better economic performance of
Egypt compared with North Korea was a consequence of the more limited
extractive nature of Egyptian institutions. For one thing, lacking the
stifling control of the North Korean Communist Party, the Egyptian
regime had to placate its population in a way that the North Korean
regime does not. For another, even crony capitalism generates some
incentives for investment, at least among those favored by the regime,
that are totally absent in North Korea.</p>
<p>Though these details are all important and interesting, the more
critical lessons are in the big picture, which reveals that in each of
these cases, extractive political institutions have created extractive
economic institutions, transferring wealth and power toward the
elite.</p>
<p>The intensity of extraction in these different countries obviously
varies and has important consequences for prosperity. In Argentina, for
example, the constitution and democratic elections do not work well to
promote pluralism, but they do function much better than in Colombia. At
least the state can claim the monopoly of violence in Argentina. Partly
as a consequence, income per capita in Argentina is double that of
Colombia. The political institutions of both countries do a much better
job of restraining elites than those in Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone, and
as a result, Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone are much poorer than Argentina
and Colombia.</p>
<p>The vicious circle also implies that even when extractive
institutions lead to the collapse of the state, as in Sierra Leone and
Zimbabwe, this doesn’t put a conclusive end to the rule of these
institutions. We have already seen that civil wars and revolutions,
while they may occur during critical junctures, do not necessarily lead
to institutional change. The events in Sierra Leone since the civil war
ended in 2002 vividly illustrate this possibility.</p>
<p>In 2007 in a democratic election, the old party of Siaka Stevens, the
APC, returned to power. Though the man who won the presidential
election, Ernest Bai Koroma, had no association with the old APC
governments, many of his cabinet did. Two of Stevens’s sons, Bockarie
and Jengo, were even made ambassadors to the United States and Germany.
In a sense this is a more volatile version of what we saw happen in
Colombia. There the lack of state authority in many parts of the country
persists over time because it is in the interests of part of the
national political elite to allow it to do so, but the core state
institutions are also strong enough to prevent this disorder from
turning into complete chaos. In Sierra Leone, partly because of the more
extractive nature of economic institutions and partly because of the
country’s history of highly extractive political institutions, the
society has not only suffered economically but has also tipped between
complete disorder and some sort of order. Still, the long-run effect is
the same: the state all but remains absent, and institutions are
extractive.</p>
<p>In all these cases there has been a long history of extractive
institutions since at least the nineteenth century. Each country is
trapped in a vicious circle. In Colombia and Argentina, they are rooted
in the institutions of Spanish colonial rule (this page–this page).
Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone originated in British colonial regimes set up
in the late nineteenth century. In Sierra Leone, in the absence of white
settlers, these regimes built extensively on precolonial extractive
structures of political power and intensified them. These structures
themselves were the outcome of a long vicious circle that featured lack
of political centralization and the disastrous effects of the slave
trade. In Zimbabwe, there was much more of a construction of a new form
of extractive institutions, because the British South Africa Company
created a dual economy. Uzbekistan could take over the extractive
institutions of the Soviet Union and, like Egypt, modify them into crony
capitalism. The Soviet Union’s extractive institutions themselves were
in many ways a continuation of those of the tsarist regime, again in a
pattern predicated on the iron law of oligarchy. As these various
vicious circles played out in different parts of the world over the past
250 years, world inequality emerged, and persists.</p>
<p>The solution to the economic and political failure of nations today
is to transform their extractive institutions toward inclusive ones. The
vicious circle means that this is not easy. But it is not impossible,
and the iron law of oligarchy is not inevitable. Either some preexisting
inclusive elements in institutions, or the presence of broad coalitions
leading the fight against the existing regime, or just the contingent
nature of history, can break vicious circles. Just like the civil war in
Sierra Leone, the Glorious Revolution in 1688 was a struggle for power.
But it was a struggle of a very different nature than the civil war in
Sierra Leone. Conceivably some in Parliament fighting to remove James II
in the wake of the Glorious Revolution imagined themselves playing the
role of the new absolutist, as Oliver Cromwell did after the English
Civil War. But the fact that Parliament was already powerful and made up
of a broad coalition consisting of different economic interests and
different points of view made the iron law of oligarchy less likely to
apply in 1688. And it was helped by the fact that luck was on the side
of Parliament against James II. In the next chapter, we will see other
examples of countries that have managed to break the mold and transform
their institutions for the better, even after a long history of
extractive institutions.</p>
