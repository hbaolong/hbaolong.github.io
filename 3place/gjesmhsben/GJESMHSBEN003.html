DIFFERENT</h4>
<p>THE ECONOMICS OF THE RIO GRANDE</p>
<p>THE CITY OF NOGALES is cut in half by a fence. If you stand by it and
look north, you’ll see Nogales, Arizona, located in Santa Cruz County.
The income of the average household there is about 0,000 a year. Most
teenagers are in school, and the majority of the adults are high school
graduates. Despite all the arguments people make about how deficient the
U.S. health care system is, the population is relatively healthy, with
high life expectancy by global standards. Many of the residents are
above age sixty-five and have access to Medicare. It’s just one of the
many services the government provides that most take for granted, such
as electricity, telephones, a sewage system, public health, a road
network linking them to other cities in the area and to the rest of the
United States, and, last but not least, law and order. The people of
Nogales, Arizona, can go about their daily activities without fear for
life or safety and not constantly afraid of theft, expropriation, or
other things that might jeopardize their investments in their businesses
and houses. Equally important, the residents of Nogales, Arizona, take
it for granted that, with all its inefficiency and occasional
corruption, the government is their agent. They can vote to replace
their mayor, congressmen, and senators; they vote in the presidential
elections that determine who will lead their country. Democracy is
second nature to them.</p>
<p>Life south of the fence, just a few feet away, is rather different.
While the residents of Nogales, Sonora, live in a relatively prosperous
part of Mexico, the income of the average household there is about
one-third that in Nogales, Arizona. Most adults in Nogales, Sonora, do
not have a high school degree, and many teenagers are not in school.
Mothers have to worry about high rates of infant mortality. Poor public
health conditions mean it’s no surprise that the residents of Nogales,
Sonora, do not live as long as their northern neighbors. They also don’t
have access to many public amenities. Roads are in bad condition south
of the fence. Law and order is in worse condition. Crime is high, and
opening a business is a risky activity. Not only do you risk robbery,
but getting all the permissions and greasing all the palms just to open
is no easy endeavor. Residents of Nogales, Sonora, live with
politicians’ corruption and ineptitude every day.</p>
<p>In contrast to their northern neighbors, democracy is a very recent
experience for them. Until the political reforms of 2000, Nogales,
Sonora, just like the rest of Mexico, was under the corrupt control of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or Partido Revolucionario
Institucional (PRI).</p>
<p>How could the two halves of what is essentially the same city be so
different? There is no difference in geography, climate, or the types of
diseases prevalent in the area, since germs do not face any restrictions
crossing back and forth between the United States and Mexico. Of course,
health conditions are very different, but this has nothing to do with
the disease environment; it is because the people south of the border
live with inferior sanitary conditions and lack decent health care.</p>
<p>But perhaps the residents are very different. Could it be that the
residents of Nogales, Arizona, are grandchildren of migrants from
Europe, while those in the south are descendants of Aztecs? Not so. The
backgrounds of people on both sides of the border are quite similar.
After Mexico became independent from Spain in 1821, the area around “Los
dos Nogales” was part of the Mexican state of Vieja California and
remained so even after the Mexican-American War of 1846–1848. Indeed, it
was only after the Gadsden Purchase of 1853 that the U.S. border was
extended into this area. It was Lieutenant N. Michler who, while
surveying the border, noted the presence of the “pretty little valley of
Los Nogales.” Here, on either side of the border, the two cities rose
up. The inhabitants of Nogales, Arizona, and Nogales, Sonora, share
ancestors, enjoy the same food and the same music, and, we would hazard
to say, have the same “culture.”</p>
<p>Of course, there is a very simple and obvious explanation for the
differences between the two halves of Nogales that you’ve probably long
since guessed: the very border that defines the two halves. Nogales,
Arizona, is in the United States. Its inhabitants have access to the
economic institutions of the United States, which enable them to choose
their occupations freely, acquire schooling and skills, and encourage
their employers to invest in the best technology, which leads to higher
wages for them. They also have access to political institutions that
allow them to take part in the democratic process, to elect their
representatives, and replace them if they misbehave. In consequence,
politicians provide the basic services (ranging from public health to
roads to law and order) that the citizens demand. Those of Nogales,
Sonora, are not so lucky. They live in a different world shaped by
different institutions. These different institutions create very
disparate incentives for the inhabitants of the two Nogaleses and for
the entrepreneurs and businesses willing to invest there. These
incentives created by the different institutions of the Nogaleses and
the countries in which they are situated are the main reason for the
differences in economic prosperity on the two sides of the border.</p>
<p>Why are the institutions of the United States so much more conducive
to economic success than those of Mexico or, for that matter, the rest
of Latin America? The answer to this question lies in the way the
different societies formed during the early colonial period. An
institutional divergence took place then, with implications lasting into
the present day. To understand this divergence we must begin right at
the foundation of the colonies in North and Latin America.</p>
<p>THE FOUNDING OF BUENOS AIRES</p>
<p>Early in 1516 the Spanish navigator Juan Díaz de Solís sailed into a
wide estuary on the Eastern Seaboard of South America. Wading ashore, de
Solís claimed the land for Spain, naming the river the Río de la Plata,
“River of Silver,” since the local people possessed silver. The
indigenous peoples on either side of the estuary—the Charrúas in what is
now Uruguay, and the Querandí on the plains that were to be known as the
Pampas in modern Argentina—regarded the newcomers with hostility. These
locals were hunter-gatherers who lived in small groups without strong
centralized political authorities. Indeed it was such a band of Charrúas
who clubbed de Solís to death as he explored the new domains he had
attemped to occupy for Spain.</p>
<p>In 1534 the Spanish, still optimistic, sent out a first mission of
settlers from Spain under the leadership of Pedro de Mendoza. They
founded a town on the site of Buenos Aires in the same year. It should
have been an ideal place for Europeans. Buenos Aires, literally meaning
“good airs,” had a hospitable, temperate climate. Yet the first stay of
the Spaniards there was short lived. They were not after good airs, but
resources to extract and labor to coerce. The Charrúas and the Querandí
were not obliging, however. They refused to provide food to the
Spaniards, and refused to work when caught. They attacked the new
settlement with their bows and arrows. The Spaniards grew hungry, since
they had not anticipated having to provide food for themselves. Buenos
Aires was not what they had dreamed of. The local people could not be
forced into providing labor. The area had no silver or gold to exploit,
and the silver that de Solís found had actually come all the way from
the Inca state in the Andes, far to the west.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, while trying to survive, started sending out
expeditions to find a new place that would offer greater riches and
populations easier to coerce. In 1537 one of these expeditions, under
the leadership of Juan de Ayolas, penetrated up the Paraná River,
searching for a route to the Incas. On its way, it made contact with the
Guaraní, a sedentary people with an agricultural economy based on maize
and cassava. De Ayolas immediately realized that the Guaraní were a
completely different proposition from the Charrúas and the Querandí.
After a brief conflict, the Spanish overcame Guaraní resistance and
founded a town, Nuestra Señora de Santa María de la Asunción, which
remains the capital of Paraguay today. The conquistadors married the
Guaraní princesses and quickly set themselves up as a new aristocracy.
They adapted the existing systems of forced labor and tribute of the
Guaraní, with themselves at the helm. This was the kind of colony they
wanted to set up, and within four years Buenos Aires was abandoned as
all the Spaniards who’d settled there moved to the new town.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, the “Paris of South America,” a city of wide
European-style boulevards based on the great agricultural wealth of the
Pampas, was not resettled until 1580. The abandonment of Buenos Aires
and the conquest of the Guaraní reveals the logic of European
colonization of the Americas. Early Spanish and, as we will see, English
colonists were not interested in tilling the soil themselves; they
wanted others to do it for them, and they wanted riches, gold and
silver, to plunder.</p>
<p>FROM CAJAMARCA …</p>
<p>The expeditions of de Solís, de Mendoza, and de Ayolas came in the
wake of more famous ones that followed Christopher Columbus’s sighting
of one of the islands of the Bahamas on October 12, 1492. Spanish
expansion and colonization of the Americas began in earnest with the
invasion of Mexico by Hernán Cortés in 1519, the expedition of Francisco
Pizarro to Peru a decade and a half later, and the expedition of Pedro
de Mendoza to the Río de la Plata just two years after that. Over the
next century, Spain conquered and colonized most of central, western,
and southern South America, while Portugal claimed Brazil to the
east.</p>
<p>The Spanish strategy of colonization was highly effective. First
perfected by Cortés in Mexico, it was based on the observation that the
best way for the Spanish to subdue opposition was to capture the
indigenous leader. This strategy enabled the Spanish to claim the
accumulated wealth of the leader and coerce the indigenous peoples to
give tribute and food. The next step was setting themselves up as the
new elite of the indigenous society and taking control of the existing
methods of taxation, tribute, and, particularly, forced labor.</p>
<p>When Cortés and his men arrived at the great Aztec capital of
Tenochtitlan on November 8, 1519, they were welcomed by Moctezuma, the
Aztec emperor, who had decided, in the face of much advice from his
counselors, to welcome the Spaniards peacefully. What happened next is
well described by the account compiled after 1545 by the Franciscan
priest Bernardino de Sahagún in his famous Florentine Codices.</p>
<p>[At] once they [the Spanish] firmly seized Moctezuma … then each of
the guns shot off … Fear prevailed. It was as if everyone had swallowed
his heart. Even before it had grown dark, there was terror, there was
astonishment, there was apprehension, there was a stunning of the
people.</p>
<p>And when it dawned thereupon were proclaimed all the things which
[the Spaniards] required: white tortillas, roasted turkey hens, eggs,
fresh water, wood, firewood, charcoal … This had Moctezuma indeed
commanded.</p>
<p>And when the Spaniards were well settled, they thereupon inquired of
Moctezuma as to all the city’s treasure … with great zeal they sought
gold. And Moctezuma thereupon went leading the Spaniards. They went
surrounding him … each holding him, each grasping him.</p>
<p>And when they reached the storehouse, a place called Teocalco,
thereupon they brought forth all the brilliant things; the quetzal
feather head fan, the devices, the shields, the golden discs … the
golden nose crescents, the golden leg bands, the golden arm bands, the
golden forehead bands.</p>
<p>Thereupon was detached the gold … at once they ignited, set fire to …
all the precious things. They all burned. And the gold the Spaniards
formed into separate bars … And the Spanish walked everywhere … They
took all, all that they saw which they saw to be good.</p>
<p>Thereupon they went to Moctezuma’s own storehouse … at the place
called Totocalco … they brought forth [Moctezuma’s] own property …
precious things all; the necklaces with pendants, the arm bands with
tufts of quetzal feathers, the golden arm bands, the bracelets, the
golden bands with shells … and the turquoise diadem, the attribute of
the ruler. They took it all.</p>
<p>The military conquest of the Aztecs was completed by 1521. Cortés, as
governor of the province of New Spain, then began dividing up the most
valuable resource, the indigenous population, through the institution of
the encomienda. The encomienda had first appeared in fifteenth-century
Spain as part of the reconquest of the south of the country from the
Moors, Arabs who had settled during and after the eighth century. In the
New World, it took on a much more pernicious form: it was a grant of
indigenous peoples to a Spaniard, known as the encomendero. The
indigenous peoples had to give the encomendero tribute and labor
services, in exchange for which the encomendero was charged with
converting them to Christianity.</p>
<p>A vivid early account of the workings of the encomienda has come down
to us from Bartolomé de las Casas, a Dominican priest who formulated the
earliest and one of the most devastating critiques of the Spanish
colonial system. De las Casas arrived on the Spanish island of
Hispaniola in 1502 with a fleet of ships led by the new governor,
Nicolás de Ovando. He became increasingly disillusioned and disturbed by
the cruel and exploitative treatment of the indigenous peoples he
witnessed every day. In 1513 he took part as a chaplain in the Spanish
conquest of Cuba, even being granted an encomienda for his service.
However, he renounced the grant and began a long campaign to reform
Spanish colonial institutions. His efforts culminated in his book A
Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies, written in 1542, a
withering attack on the barbarity of Spanish rule. On the encomienda he
has this to say in the case of Nicaragua:</p>
<p>Each of the settlers took up residence in the town allotted to him
(or encommended to him, as the legal phrase has it), put the inhabitants
to work for him, stole their already scarce foodstuffs for himself and
took over the lands owned and worked by the natives and on which they
traditionally grew their own produce. The settler would treat the whole
of the native population—dignitaries, old men, women and children—as
members of his household and, as such, make them labor night and day in
his own interests, without any rest whatsoever.</p>
<p>For the conquest of New Granada, modern Colombia, de las Casas
reports the whole Spanish strategy in action:</p>
<p>To realize their long-term purpose of seizing all the available gold,
the Spaniards employed their usual strategy of apportioning among
themselves (or en-commending, as they have it) the towns and their
inhabitants … and then, as ever, treating them as common slaves. The man
in overall command of the expedition seized the King of the whole
territory for himself and held him prisoner for six or seven months,
quite illicitly demanding more and more gold and emeralds from him. This
King, one Bogotá, was so terrified that, in his anxiety to free himself
from the clutches of his tormentors, he consented to the demand that he
fill an entire house with gold and hand it over; to this end he sent his
people off in search of gold, and bit by bit they brought it along with
many precious stones. But still the house was not filled and the
Spaniards eventually declared that they would put him to death for
breaking his promise. The commander suggested they should bring the case
before him, as a representative of the law, and when they did so,
entering formal accusations against the King, he sentenced him to
torture should he persist in not honoring the bargain. They tortured him
with the strappado, put burning tallow on his belly, pinned both his
legs to poles with iron hoops and his neck with another and then, with
two men holding his hands, proceeded to burn the soles of his feet. From
time to time, the commander would look in and repeat that they would
torture him to death slowly unless he produced more gold, and this is
what they did, the King eventually succumbing to the agonies they
inflicted on him.</p>
<p>The strategy and institutions of conquest perfected in Mexico were
eagerly adopted elsewhere in the Spanish Empire. Nowhere was this done
more effectively than in Pizarro’s conquest of Peru. As de las Casas
begins his account:</p>
<p>In 1531 another great villain journeyed with a number of men to the
kingdom of Peru. He set out with every intention of imitating the
strategy and tactics of his fellow adventurers in other parts of the New
World.</p>
<p>Pizarro began on the coast near the Peruvian town of Tumbes and
marched south. On November 15, 1532, he reached the mountain town of
Cajamarca, where the Inca emperor Atahualpa was encamped with his army.
The next day, Atahualpa, who had just vanquished his brother Huáscar in
a contest over who would succeed their deceased father, Huayna Capac,
came with his retinue to where the Spanish were camped. Atahualpa was
irritated because news of atrocities that the Spanish had already
committed, such as violating a temple of the Sun God Inti, had reached
him. What transpired next is well known. The Spanish laid a trap and
sprang it. They killed Atahualpa’s guards and retainers, possibly as
many as two thousand people, and captured the king. To gain his freedom,
Atahualpa had to promise to fill one room with gold and two more of the
same size with silver. He did this, but the Spanish, reneging on their
promises, strangled him in July 1533. That November, the Spanish
captured the Inca capital of Cusco, where the Incan aristocracy received
the same treatment as Atahualpa, being imprisoned until they produced
gold and silver. When they did not satisfy Spanish demands, they were
burned alive. The great artistic treasures of Cusco, such as the Temple
of the Sun, had their gold stripped from them and melted down into
ingots.</p>
<p>At this point the Spanish focused on the people of the Inca Empire.
As in Mexico, citizens were divided into encomiendas, with one going to
each of the conquistadors who had accompanied Pizarro. The encomienda
was the main institution used for the control and organization of labor
in the early colonial period, but it soon faced a vigorous contender. In
1545 a local named Diego Gualpa was searching for an indigenous shrine
high in the Andes in what is today Bolivia. He was thrown to the ground
by a sudden gust of wind and in front of him appeared a cache of silver
ore. This was part of a vast mountain of silver, which the Spanish
baptized El Cerro Rico, “The Rich Hill.” Around it grew the city of
Potosí, which at its height in 1650 had a population of 160,000 people,
larger than Lisbon or Venice in this period.</p>
<p>To exploit the silver, the Spanish needed miners—a lot of miners.
They sent a new viceroy, the chief Spanish colonial official, Francisco
de Toledo, whose main mission was to solve the labor problem. De Toledo,
arriving in Peru in 1569, first spent five years traveling around and
investigating his new charge. He also commissioned a massive survey of
the entire adult population. To find the labor he needed, de Toledo
first moved almost the entire indigenous population, concentrating them
in new towns called reducciones—literally “reductions”—which would
facilitate the exploitation of labor by the Spanish Crown. Then he
revived and adapted an Inca labor institution known as the mita, which,
in the Incas’ language, Quechua, means “a turn.” Under their mita
system, the Incas had used forced labor to run plantations designed to
provide food for temples, the aristocracy, and the army. In return, the
Inca elite provided famine relief and security. In de Toledo’s hands the
mita, especially the Potosí mita, was to become the largest and most
onerous scheme of labor exploitation in the Spanish colonial period. De
Toledo defined a huge catchment area, running from the middle of
modern-day Peru and encompassing most of modern Bolivia. It covered
about two hundred thousand square miles. In this area, one-seventh of
the male inhabitants, newly arrived in their reducciones, were required
to work in the mines at Potosí. The Potosí mita endured throughout the
entire colonial period and was abolished only in 1825. Map 1 shows the
catchment area of the mita superimposed on the extent of the Inca empire
at the time of the Spanish conquest. It illustrates the extent to which
the mita overlapped with the heartland of the empire, encompassing the
capital Cusco.</p>
<p>Remarkably, you still see the legacy of the mita in Peru today. Take
the differences between the provinces of Calca and nearby Acomayo. There
appears to be few differences among these provinces. Both are high in
the mountains, and each is inhabited by the Quechua-speaking descendants
of the Incas. Yet Acomayo is much poorer, with its inhabitants consuming
about one-third less than those in Calca. The people know this. In
Acomayo they ask intrepid foreigners, “Don’t you know that the people
here are poorer than the people over there in Calca? Why would you ever
want to come here?” Intrepid because it is much harder to get to Acomayo
from the regional capital of Cusco, ancient center of the Inca Empire,
than it is to get to Calca. The road to Calca is surfaced, the one to
Acomayo is in a terrible state of disrepair. To get beyond Acomayo, you
need a horse or a mule. In Calca and Acomayo, people grow the same
crops, but in Calca they sell them on the market for money. In Acomayo
they grow food for their own subsistence. These inequalities, apparent
to the eye and to the people who live there, can be understood in terms
of the institutional differences between these departments—institutional
differences with historical roots going back to de Toledo and his plan
for effective exploitation of indigenous labor. The major historical
difference between Acomayo and Calca is that Acomayo was in the
catchment area of the Potosí mita. Calca was not.</p>
<p>In addition to the concentration of labor and the mita, de Toledo
consolidated the encomienda into a head tax, a fixed sum payable by each
adult male every year in silver. This was another scheme designed to
force people into the labor market and reduce wages for Spanish
landowners. Another institution, the repartimiento de mercancias, also
became widespread during de Toledo’s tenure. Derived from the Spanish
verb repartir, to distribute, this repartimiento, literally “the
distribution of goods,” involved the forced sale of goods to locals at
prices determined by Spaniards. Finally, de Toledo introduced the
trajin—meaning, literally, “the burden”—which used the indigenous people
to carry heavy loads of goods, such as wine or coca leaves or textiles,
as a substitute for pack animals, for the business ventures of the
Spanish elite.</p>
<p>Throughout the Spanish colonial world in the Americas, similar
institutions and social structures emerged. After an initial phase of
looting, and gold and silver lust, the Spanish created a web of
institutions designed to exploit the indigenous peoples. The full gamut
of encomienda, mita, repartimiento, and trajin was designed to force
indigenous people’s living standards down to a subsistence level and
thus extract all income in excess of this for Spaniards. This was
achieved by expropriating their land, forcing them to work, offering low
wages for labor services, imposing high taxes, and charging high prices
for goods that were not even voluntarily bought. Though these
institutions generated a lot of wealth for the Spanish Crown and made
the conquistadors and their descendants very rich, they also turned
Latin America into the most unequal continent in the world and sapped
much of its economic potential.</p>
<p>… TO JAMESTOWN</p>
<p>As the Spanish began their conquest of the Americas in the 1490s,
England was a minor European power recovering from the devastating
effects of a civil war, the Wars of the Roses. She was in no state to
take advantage of the scramble for loot and gold and the opportunity to
exploit the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Nearly one hundred years
later, in 1588, the lucky rout of the Spanish Armada, an attempt by King
Philip II of Spain to invade England, sent political shockwaves around
Europe. Fortunate though England’s victory was, it was also a sign of
growing English assertiveness on the seas that would enable them to
finally take part in the quest for colonial empire.</p>
<p>It is thus no coincidence that the English began their colonization
of North America at exactly the same time. But they were already
latecomers. They chose North America not because it was attractive, but
because it was all that was available. The “desirable” parts of the
Americas, where the indigenous population to exploit was plentiful and
where the gold and silver mines were located, had already been occupied.
The English got the leftovers. When the eighteenth-century English
writer and agriculturalist Arthur Young discussed where profitable
“staple products,” by which he meant exportable agricultural goods, were
produced, he noted:</p>
<p>It appears upon the whole, that the staple productions of our
colonies decrease in value in proportion to their distance from the sun.
In the West Indies, which are the hottest of all, they make to the
amount of 8l. 12s. 1d. per head. In the southern continental ones, to
the amount of 5l. 10s. In the central ones, to the amount of 9s. 6 1/2d.
In the northern settlements, to that of 2s. 6d. This scale surely
suggests a most important lesson—to avoid colonizing in northern
latitudes.</p>
<p>The first English attempt to plant a colony, at Roanoke, in North
Carolina, between 1585 and 1587, was a complete failure. In 1607 they
tried again. Shortly before the end of 1606, three vessels, Susan
Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery, under the command of Captain
Christopher Newport, set off for Virginia. The colonists, under the
auspices of the Virginia Company, sailed into Chesapeake Bay and up a
river they named the James, after the ruling English monarch, James I.
On May 14, 1607, they founded the settlement of Jamestown.</p>
<p>Though the settlers on board the ships owned by the Virginia Company
were English, they had a model of colonization heavily influenced by the
template set up by Cortés, Pizarro, and de Toledo. Their first plan was
to capture the local chief and use him as a way to get provisions and to
coerce the population into producing food and wealth for them.</p>
<p>When they first landed in Jamestown, the English colonists did not
know that they were within the territory claimed by the Powhatan
Confederacy, a coalition of some thirty polities owing allegiance to a
king called Wahunsunacock. Wahunsunacock’s capital was at the town of
Werowocomoco, a mere twenty miles from Jamestown. The plan of the
colonists was to learn more about the lay of the land. If the locals
could not be induced to provide food and labor, the colonists might at
least be able to trade with them. The notion that the settlers
themselves would work and grow their own food seems not to have crossed
their minds. That is not what conquerors of the New World did.</p>
<p>Wahunsunacock quickly became aware of the colonists’ presence and
viewed their intentions with great suspicion. He was in charge of what
for North America was quite a large empire. But he had many enemies and
lacked the overwhelming centralized political control of the Incas.
Wahunsunacock decided to see what the intentions of the English were,
initially sending messengers saying that he desired friendly relations
with them.</p>
<p>As the winter of 1607 closed in, the settlers in Jamestown began to
run low on food, and the appointed leader of the colony’s ruling
council, Edward Marie Wingfield, dithered indecisively. The situation
was rescued by Captain John Smith. Smith, whose writings provide one of
our main sources of information about the early development of the
colony, was a larger-than-life character. Born in England, in rural
Lincolnshire, he disregarded his father’s desires for him to go into
business and instead became a soldier of fortune. He first fought with
English armies in the Netherlands, after which he joined Austrian forces
serving in Hungary fighting against the armies of the Ottoman Empire.
Captured in Romania, he was sold as a slave and put to work as a field
hand. He managed one day to overcome his master and, stealing his
clothes and his horse, escape back into Austrian territory. Smith had
got himself into trouble on the voyage to Virginia and was imprisoned on
the Susan Constant for mutiny after defying the orders of Wingfield.
When the ships reached the New World, the plan was to put him on trial.
To the immense horror of Wingfield, Newport, and other elite colonists,
however, when they opened their sealed orders, they discovered that the
Virginia Company had nominated Smith to be a member of the ruling
council that was to govern Jamestown.</p>
<p>With Newport sailing back to England for supplies and more colonists,
and Wingfield uncertain about what to do, it was Smith who saved the
colony. He initiated a series of trading missions that secured vital
food supplies. On one of these he was captured by Opechancanough, one of
Wahunsunacock’s younger brothers, and was brought before the king at
Werowocomoco. He was the first Englishman to meet Wahunsunacock, and it
was at this initial meeting that according to some accounts Smith’s life
was saved only at the intervention of Wahunsunacock’s young daughter
Pocahontas. Freed on January 2, 1608, Smith returned to Jamestown, which
was still perilously low on food, until the timely return of Newport
from England later on the same day.</p>
<p>The colonists of Jamestown learned little from this initial
experience. As 1608 proceeded, they continued their quest for gold and
precious metals. They still did not seem to understand that to survive,
they could not rely on the locals to feed them through either coercion
or trade. It was Smith who was the first to realize that the model of
colonization that had worked so well for Cortés and Pizarro simply would
not work in North America. The underlying circumstances were just too
different. Smith noted that, unlike the Aztecs and Incas, the peoples of
Virginia did not have gold. Indeed, he noted in his diary, “Victuals you
must know is all their wealth.” Anas Todkill, one of the early settlers
who left an extensive diary, expressed well the frustrations of Smith
and the few others on which this recognition dawned:</p>
<p>“There was no talke, no hope, no worke, but dig gold, refine gold,
load gold.”</p>
<p>When Newport sailed for England in April 1608 he took a cargo of
pyrite, fool’s gold. He returned at the end of September with orders
from the Virginia Company to take firmer control over the locals. Their
plan was to crown Wahunsunacock, hoping this would render him
subservient to the English king James I. They invited him to Jamestown,
but Wahunsunacock, still deeply suspicious of the colonists, had no
intention of risking capture. John Smith recorded Wahunsunacock’s reply:
“If your King have sent me presents, I also am a King, and this is my
land … Your father is to come to me, not I to him, nor yet to your fort,
neither will I bite at such a bait.”</p>
<p>If Wahunsunacock would not “bite at such a bait,” Newport and Smith
would have to go to Werowocomoco to undertake the coronation. The whole
event appears to have been a complete fiasco, with the only thing coming
out of it a resolve on the part of Wahunsunacock that it was time to get
rid of the colony. He imposed a trade embargo. Jamestown could no longer
trade for supplies. Wahunsunacock would starve them out.</p>
<p>Newport set sail once more for England, in December 1608. He took
with him a letter written by Smith pleading with the directors of the
Virginia Company to change the way they thought about the colony. There
was no possibility of a get-rich-quick exploitation of Virginia along
the lines of Mexico and Peru. There were no gold or precious metals, and
the indigenous people could not be forced to work or provide food. Smith
realized that if there were going to be a viable colony, it was the
colonists who would have to work. He therefore pleaded with the
directors to send the right sort of people: “When you send againe I
entreat you rather to send some thirty carpenters, husbandmen,
gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons, and diggers up of trees,
roots, well provided, then a thousand of such as we have.”</p>
<p>Smith did not want any more useless goldsmiths. Once more Jamestown
survived only because of his resourcefulness. He managed to cajole and
bully local indigenous groups to trade with him, and when they wouldn’t,
he took what he could. Back in the settlement, Smith was completely in
charge and imposed the rule that “he that will not worke shall not eat.”
Jamestown survived a second winter.</p>
<p>The Virginia Company was intended to be a moneymaking enterprise, and
after two disastrous years, there was no whiff of profit. The directors
of the company decided that they needed a new model of governance,
replacing the ruling council with a single governor. The first man
appointed to this position was Sir Thomas Gates. Heeding some aspects of
Smith’s warning, the company realized that they had to try something
new. This realization was driven home by the events of the winter of
1609/1610—the so-called “starving time.” The new mode of governance left
no room for Smith, who, disgruntled, returned to England in the autumn
of 1609. Without his resourcefulness, and with Wahunsunacock throttling
the food supply, the colonists in Jamestown perished. Of the five
hundred who entered the winter, only sixty were alive by March. The
situation was so desperate that they resorted to cannibalism.</p>
<p>The “something new” that was imposed on the colony by Gates and his
deputy, Sir Thomas Dale, was a work regime of draconian severity for
English settlers—though not of course for the elite running the colony.
It was Dale who propagated the “Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall.” This
included the clauses</p>
<p>No man or woman shall run away from the colony to the Indians, upon
pain of death.</p>
<p>Anyone who robs a garden, public or private, or a vineyard, or who
steals ears of corn shall be punished with death.</p>
<p>No member of the colony will sell or give any commodity of this
country to a captain, mariner, master or sailor to transport out of the
colony, for his own private uses, upon pain of death.</p>
<p>If the indigenous peoples could not be exploited, reasoned the
Virginia Company, perhaps the colonists could. The new model of colonial
development entailed the Virginia Company owning all the land. Men were
housed in barracks, and given company-determined rations. Work gangs
were chosen, each one overseen by an agent of the company. It was close
to martial law, with execution as the punishment of first resort. As
part of the new institutions for the colony, the first clause just given
is significant. The company threatened with death those who ran away.
Given the new work regime, running away to live with the locals became
more and more of an attractive option for the colonists who had to do
the work. Also available, given the low density of even indigenous
populations in Virginia at that time, was the prospect of going it alone
on the frontier beyond the control of the Virginia Company. The power of
the company in the face of these options was limited. It could not
coerce the English settlers into hard work at subsistence rations.</p>
<p>Map 2 shows an estimate of the population density of different
regions of the Americas at the time on the Spanish conquest. The
population density of the United States, outside of a few pockets, was
at most three-quarters of a person per square mile. In central Mexico or
Andean Peru, the population density was as high as four hundred people
per square mile, more than five hundred times higher. What was possible
in Mexico or Peru was not feasible in Virginia.</p>
<p>It took the Virginia Company some time to recognize that its initial
model of colonization did not work in Virginia, and it took a while,
too, for the failure of the “Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall” to sink
in. Starting in 1618, a dramatically new strategy was adopted. Since it
was possible to coerce neither the locals nor the settlers, the only
alternative was to give the settlers incentives. In 1618 the company
began the “headright system,” which gave each male settler fifty acres
of land and fifty more acres for each member of his family and for all
servants that a family could bring to Virginia. Settlers were given
their houses and freed from their contracts, and in 1619 a General
Assembly was introduced that effectively gave all adult men a say in the
laws and institutions governing the colony. It was the start of
democracy in the United States.</p>
<p>It took the Virginia Company twelve years to learn its first lesson
that what had worked for the Spanish in Mexico and in Central and South
America would not work in the north. The rest of the seventeenth century
saw a long series of struggles over the second lesson: that the only
option for an economically viable colony was to create institutions that
gave the colonists incentives to invest and to work hard.</p>
<p>As North America developed, English elites tried time and time again
to set up institutions that would heavily restrict the economic and
political rights for all but a privileged few of the inhabitants of the
colony, just as the Spanish did. Yet in each case this model broke down,
as it had in Virginia.</p>
<p>One of the most ambitious attempts began soon after the change in
strategy of the Virginia Company. In 1632 ten million acres of land on
the upper Chesapeake Bay were granted by the English king Charles I to
Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore. The Charter of Maryland gave Lord
Baltimore complete freedom to create a government along any lines he
wished, with clause VII noting that Baltimore had “for the good and
happy Government of the said Province, free, full, and absolute Power,
by the Tenor of these Presents, to Ordain, Make, and Enact Laws, of what
Kind soever.”</p>
<p>Baltimore drew up a detailed plan for creating a manorial society, a
North American variant of an idealized version of seventeenth-century
rural England. It entailed dividing the land into plots of thousands of
acres, which would be run by lords. The lords would recruit tenants, who
would work the lands and pay rents to the privileged elite controlling
the land. Another similar attempt was made later in 1663, with the
founding of Carolina by eight proprietors, including Sir Anthony
Ashley-Cooper. Ashley-Cooper, along with his secretary, the great
English philosopher John Locke, formulated the Fundamental Constitutions
of Carolina. This document, like the Charter of Maryland before it,
provided a blueprint for an elitist, hierarchical society based on
control by a landed elite. The preamble noted that “the government of
this province may be made most agreeable to the monarchy under which we
live and of which this province is a part; and that we may avoid
erecting a numerous democracy.”</p>
<p>The clauses of the Fundamental Constitutions laid out a rigid social
structure. At the bottom were the “leet-men,” with clause 23 noting,
“All the children of leet-men shall be leet-men, and so to all
generations.” Above the leet-men, who had no political power, were the
landgraves and caziques, who were to form the aristocracy. Landgraves
were to be allocated forty-eight thousand acres of land each, and
caziques twenty-four thousand acres. There was to be a parliament, in
which landgraves and caziques were represented, but it would be
permitted to debate only those measures that had previously been
approved by the eight proprietors.</p>
<p>Just as the attempt to impose draconian rule in Virginia failed, so
did the plans for the same type of institutions in Maryland and
Carolina. The reasons were similar. In all cases it proved to be
impossible to force settlers into a rigid hierarchical society, because
there were simply too many options open to them in the New World.
Instead, they had to be provided with incentives for them to want to
work. And soon they were demanding more economic freedom and further
political rights. In Maryland, too, settlers insisted on getting their
own land, and they forced Lord Baltimore into creating an assembly. In
1691 the assembly induced the king to declare Maryland a Crown colony,
thus removing the political privileges of Baltimore and his great lords.
A similar protracted struggle took place in the Carolinas, again with
the proprietors losing. South Carolina became a royal colony in
1729.</p>
<p>By the 1720s, all the thirteen colonies of what was to become the
United States had similar structures of government. In all cases there
was a governor, and an assembly based on a franchise of male property
holders. They were not democracies; women, slaves, and the propertyless
could not vote. But political rights were very broad compared with
contemporary societies elsewhere. It was these assemblies and their
leaders that coalesced to form the First Continental Congress in 1774,
the prelude to the independence of the United States. The assemblies
believed they had the right to determine both their own membership and
the right to taxation. This, as we know, created problems for the
English colonial government.</p>
<p>A TALE OF TWO CONSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>It should now be apparent that it is not a coincidence that the
United States, and not Mexico, adopted and enforced a constitution that
espoused democratic principles, created limitations on the use of
political power, and distributed that power broadly in society. The
document that the delegates sat down to write in Philadelphia in May
1787 was the outcome of a long process initiated by the formation of the
General Assembly in Jamestown in 1619.</p>
<p>The contrast between the constitutional process that took place at
the time of the independence of the United States and the one that took
place a little afterward in Mexico is stark. In February 1808, Napoleon
Bonaparte’s French armies invaded Spain. By May they had taken Madrid,
the Spanish capital. By September the Spanish king Ferdinand had been
captured and had abdicated. A national junta, the Junta Central, took
his place, taking the torch in the fight against the French. The Junta
met first at Aranjuez, but retreated south in the face of the French
armies. Finally it reached the port of Cádiz, which, though besieged by
Napoleonic forces, held out. Here the Junta formed a parliament, called
the Cortes. In 1812 the Cortes produced what became known as the Cádiz
Constitution, which called for the introduction of a constitutional
monarchy based on notions of popular sovereignty. It also called for the
end of special privileges and the introduction of equality before the
law. These demands were all anathema to the elites of South America, who
were still ruling an institutional environment shaped by the encomienda,
forced labor, and absolute power vested in them and the colonial
state.</p>
<p>The collapse of the Spanish state with the Napoleonic invasion
created a constitutional crisis throughout colonial Latin America. There
was much dispute about whether to recognize the authority of the Junta
Central, and in response, many Latin Americans began to form their own
juntas. It was only a matter of time before they began to sense the
possibility of becoming truly independent from Spain. The first
declaration of independence took place in La Paz, Bolivia, in 1809,
though it was quickly crushed by Spanish troops sent from Peru. In
Mexico the political attitudes of the elite had been shaped by the 1810
Hidalgo Revolt, led by a priest, Father Miguel Hidalgo. When Hidalgo’s
army sacked Guanajuato on September 23, they killed the intendant, the
senior colonial official, and then started indiscriminately to kill
white people. It was more like class or even ethnic warfare than an
independence movement, and it united all the elites in opposition. If
independence allowed popular participation in politics, the local
elites, not just Spaniards, were against it. Consequentially, Mexican
elites viewed the Cádiz Constitution, which opened the way to popular
participation, with extreme skepticism; they would never recognize its
legitimacy.</p>
<p>In 1815, as Napoleon’s European empire collapsed, King Ferdinand VII
returned to power and the Cádiz Constitution was abrogated. As the
Spanish Crown began trying to reclaim its American colonies, it did not
face a problem with loyalist Mexico. Yet, in 1820, a Spanish army that
had assembled in Cádiz to sail to the Americas to help restore Spanish
authority mutinied against Ferdinand VII. They were soon joined by army
units throughout the country, and Ferdinand was forced to restore the
Cádiz Constitution and recall the Cortes. This Cortes was even more
radical than the one that had written the Cádiz Constitution, and it
proposed abolishing all forms of labor coercion. It also attacked
special privileges—for example, the right of the military to be tried
for crimes in their own courts. Faced finally with the imposition of
this document in Mexico, the elites there decided that it was better to
go it alone and declare independence.</p>
<p>This independence movement was led by Augustín de Iturbide, who had
been an officer in the Spanish army. On February 24, 1821, he published
the Plan de Iguala, his vision for an independent Mexico. The plan
featured a constitutional monarchy with a Mexican emperor, and removed
the provisions of the Cádiz Constitution that Mexican elites found so
threatening to their status and privileges. It received instantaneous
support, and Spain quickly realized that it could not stop the
inevitable. But Iturbide did not just organize Mexican secession.
Recognizing the power vacuum, he quickly took advantage of his military
backing to have himself declared emperor, a position that the great
leader of South American independence Simón Bolivar described as “by the
grace of God and of bayonets.” Iturbide was not constrained by the same
political institutions that constrained presidents of the United States;
he quickly made himself a dictator, and by October 1822 he had dismissed
the constitutionally sanctioned congress and replaced it with a junta of
his choosing. Though Iturbide did not last long, this pattern of events
was to be repeated time and time again in nineteenth-century Mexico.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States did not create a democracy by
modern standards. Who could vote in elections was left up to the
individual states to determine. While northern states quickly conceded
the vote to all white men irrespective of how much income they earned or
property they owned, southern states did so only gradually. No state
enfranchised women or slaves, and as property and wealth restrictions
were lifted on white men, racial franchises explicitly disenfranchising
black men were introduced. Slavery, of course, was deemed constitutional
when the Constitution of the United States was written in Philadelphia,
and the most sordid negotiation concerned the division of the seats in
the House of Representatives among the states. These were to be
allocated on the basis of a state’s population, but the congressional
representatives of southern states then demanded that the slaves be
counted. Northerners objected. The compromise was that in apportioning
seats to the House of Representatives, a slave would count as
three-fifths of a free person. The conflicts between the North and South
of the United States were repressed during the constitutional process as
the three-fifths rule and other compromises were worked out. New fixes
were added over time—for example, the Missouri Compromise, an
arrangement where one proslavery and one antislavery state were always
added to the union together, to keep the balance in the Senate between
those for and those against slavery. These fudges kept the political
institutions of the United States working peacefully until the Civil War
finally resolved the conflicts in favor of the North.</p>
<p>The Civil War was bloody and destructive. But both before and after
it there were ample economic opportunities for a large fraction of the
population, especially in the northern and western United States. The
situation in Mexico was very different. If the United States experienced
five years of political instability between 1860 and 1865, Mexico
experienced almost nonstop instability for the first fifty years of
independence. This is best illustrated via the career of Antonio López
de Santa Ana.</p>
<p>Santa Ana, son of a colonial official in Veracruz, came to prominence
as a soldier fighting for the Spanish in the independence wars. In 1821
he switched sides with Iturbide and never looked back. He became
president of Mexico for the first time in May of 1833, though he
exercised power for less than a month, preferring to let Valentín Gómez
Farías act as president. Gómez Farías’s presidency lasted fifteen days,
after which Santa Ana retook power. This was as brief as his first
spell, however, and he was again replaced by Gómez Farías, in early
July. Santa Ana and Gómez Farías continued this dance until the middle
of 1835, when Santa Ana was replaced by Miguel Barragán. But Santa Ana
was not a quitter. He was back as president in 1839, 1841, 1844, 1847,
and, finally, between 1853 and 1855. In all, he was president eleven
times, during which he presided over the loss of the Alamo and Texas and
the disastrous Mexican-American War, which led to the loss of what
became New Mexico and Arizona. Between 1824 and 1867 there were
fifty-two presidents in Mexico, few of whom assumed power according to
any constitutionally sanctioned procedure.</p>
<p>The consequence of this unprecedented political instability for
economic institutions and incentives should be obvious. Such instability
led to highly insecure property rights. It also led to a severe
weakening of the Mexican state, which now had little authority and
little ability to raise taxes or provide public services. Indeed, even
though Santa Ana was president in Mexico, large parts of the country
were not under his control, which enabled the annexation of Texas by the
United States. In addition, as we just saw, the motivation behind the
Mexican declaration of independence was to protect the set of economic
institutions developed during the colonial period, which had made
Mexico, in the words of the great German explorer and geographer of
Latin America Alexander von Humbolt, “the country of inequality.” These
institutions, by basing the society on the exploitation of indigenous
people and the creation of monopolies, blocked the economic incentives
and initiatives of the great mass of the population. As the United
States began to experience the Industrial Revolution in the first half
of the nineteenth century, Mexico got poorer.</p>
<p>HAVING AN IDEA, STARTING A FIRM, AND GETTING A LOAN</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution started in England. Its first success was
to revolutionize the production of cotton cloth using new machines
powered by water wheels and later by steam engines. Mechanization of
cotton production massively increased the productivity of workers in,
first, textiles and, subsequently, other industries. The engine of
technological breakthroughs throughout the economy was innovation,
spearheaded by new entrepreneurs and businessmen eager to apply their
new ideas. This initial flowering soon spread across the North Atlantic
to the United States. People saw the great economic opportunities
available in adopting the new technologies developed in England. They
were also inspired to develop their own inventions.</p>
<p>We can try to understand the nature of these inventions by looking at
who was granted patents. The patent system, which protects property
rights in ideas, was systematized in the Statute of Monopolies
legislated by the English Parliament in 1623, partially as an attempt to
stop the king from arbitrarily granting “letters patent” to whomever he
wanted—effectively granting exclusive rights to undertake certain
activities or businesses. The striking thing about the evidence on
patenting in the United States is that people who were granted patents
came from all sorts of backgrounds and all walks of life, not just the
rich and the elite. Many made fortunes based on their patents. Take
Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonogram and the lightbulb and the
founder of General Electric, still one of the world’s largest companies.
Edison was the last of seven children. His father, Samuel Edison,
followed many occupations, from splitting shingles for roofs to
tailoring to keeping a tavern. Thomas had little formal schooling but
was homeschooled by his mother.</p>
<p>Between 1820 and 1845, only 19 percent of patentees in the United
States had parents who were professionals or were from recognizable
major landowning families. During the same period, 40 percent of those
who took out patents had only primary schooling or less, just like
Edison. Moreover, they often exploited their patent by starting a firm,
again like Edison. Just as the United States in the nineteenth century
was more democratic politically than almost any other nation in the
world at the time, it was also more democratic than others when it came
to innovation. This was critical to its path to becoming the most
economically innovative nation in the world.</p>
<p>If you were poor with a good idea, it was one thing to take out a
patent, which was not so expensive, after all. It was another thing
entirely to use that patent to make money. One way, of course, was to
sell the patent to someone else. This is what Edison did early on, to
raise some capital, when he sold his Quadruplex telegraph to Western
Union for 0,000. But selling patents was a good idea only for someone
like Edison, who had ideas faster than he could put them to practice.
(He had a world-record 1,093 patents issued to him in the United States
and 1,500 worldwide.) The real way to make money from a patent was to
start your own business. But to start a business, you need capital, and
you need banks to lend the capital to you.</p>
<p>Inventors in the United States were once again fortunate. During the
nineteenth century there was a rapid expansion of financial
intermediation and banking that was a crucial facilitator of the rapid
growth and industrialization that the economy experienced. While in 1818
there were 338 banks in operation in the United States, with total
assets of 60 million, by 1914 there were 27,864 banks, with total assets
of 7.3 billion. Potential inventors in the United States had ready
access to capital to start their businesses. Moreover, the intense
competition among banks and financial institutions in the United States
meant that this capital was available at fairly low interest rates.</p>
<p>The same was not true in Mexico. In fact, in 1910, the year in which
the Mexican Revolution started, there were only forty-two banks in
Mexico, and two of these controlled 60 percent of total banking assets.
Unlike in the United States, where competition was fierce, there was
practically no competition among Mexican banks. This lack of competition
meant that the banks were able to charge their customers very high
interest rates, and typically confined lending to the privileged and the
already wealthy, who would then use their access to credit to increase
their grip over the various sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>The form that the Mexican banking industry took in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries was a direct result of the postindependence
political institutions of the country. The chaos of the Santa Ana era
was followed by an abortive attempt by the French government of Emperor
Napoleon II to create a colonial regime in Mexico under Emperor
Maximilian between 1864 and 1867. The French were expelled, and a new
constitution was written. But the government formed first by Benito
Juárez and, after his death, by Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada was soon
challenged by a young military man named Porfirio Díaz. Díaz had been a
victorious general in the war against the French and had developed
aspirations of power. He formed a rebel army and, in November of 1876,
defeated the army of the government at the Battle of Tecoac. In May of
the next year, he had himself elected president. He went on to rule
Mexico in a more or less unbroken and increasingly authoritarian fashion
until his overthrow at the outbreak of the revolution thirty-four years
later.</p>
<p>Like Iturbide and Santa Ana before him, Díaz started life as a
military commander. Such a career path into politics was certainly known
in the United States. The first president of the United States, George
Washington, was also a successful general in the War of Independence.
Ulysses S. Grant, one of the victorious Union generals of the Civil War,
became president in 1869, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the supreme
commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the Second World War,
was president of the United States between 1953 and 1961. Unlike
Iturbide, Santa Ana, and Díaz, however, none of these military men used
force to get into power. Nor did they use force to avoid having to
relinquish power. They abided by the Constitution. Though Mexico had
constitutions in the nineteenth century, they put few constraints on
what Iturbide, Santa Ana, and Díaz could do. These men could be removed
from power only the same way they had attained it: by the use of
force.</p>
<p>Díaz violated people’s property rights, facilitating the
expropriation of vast amounts of land, and he granted monopolies and
favors to his supporters in all lines of business, including banking.
There was nothing new about this behavior. This is exactly what Spanish
conquistadors had done, and what Santa Ana did in their footsteps.</p>
<p>The reason that the United States had a banking industry that was
radically better for the economic prosperity of the country had nothing
to do with differences in the motivation of those who owned the banks.
Indeed, the profit motive, which underpinned the monopolistic nature of
the banking industry in Mexico, was present in the United States, too.
But this profit motive was channeled differently because of the
radically different U.S. institutions. The bankers faced different
economic institutions, institutions that subjected them to much greater
competition. And this was largely because the politicians who wrote the
rules for the bankers faced very different incentives themselves, forged
by different political institutions. Indeed, in the late eighteenth
century, shortly after the Constitution of the United States came into
operation, a banking system looking similar to that which subsequently
dominated Mexico began to emerge. Politicians tried to set up state
banking monopolies, which they could give to their friends and partners
in exchange for part of the monopoly profits. The banks also quickly got
into the business of lending money to the politicians who regulated
them, just as in Mexico. But this situation was not sustainable in the
United States, because the politicians who attempted to create these
banking monopolies, unlike their Mexican counterparts, were subject to
election and reelection. Creating banking monopolies and giving loans to
politicians is good business for politicians, if they can get away with
it. It is not particularly good for the citizens, however. Unlike in
Mexico, in the United States the citizens could keep politicians in
check and get rid of ones who would use their offices to enrich
themselves or create monopolies for their cronies. In consequence, the
banking monopolies crumbled. The broad distribution of political rights
in the United States, especially when compared to Mexico, guaranteed
equal access to finance and loans. This in turn ensured that those with
ideas and inventions could benefit from them.</p>
<p>PATH-DEPENDENT CHANGE</p>
<p>The world was changing in the 1870s and ’80s. Latin America was no
exception. The institutions that Porfirio Díaz established were not
identical to those of Santa Ana or the Spanish colonial state. The world
economy boomed in the second half of the nineteenth century, and
innovations in transportation such as the steamship and the railway led
to a huge expansion of international trade. This wave of globalization
meant that resource-rich countries such as Mexico—or, more
appropriately, the elites in such countries—could enrich themselves by
exporting raw materials and natural resources to industrializing North
America or Western Europe. Díaz and his cronies thus found themselves in
a different and rapidly evolving world. They realized that Mexico had to
change, too. But this didn’t mean uprooting the colonial institutions
and replacing them with institutions similar to those in the United
States. Instead, theirs was “path-dependent” change leading only to the
next stage of the institutions that had already made much of Latin
America poor and unequal.</p>
<p>Globalization made the large open spaces of the Americas, its “open
frontiers,” valuable. Often these frontiers were only mythically open,
since they were inhabited by indigenous peoples who were brutally
dispossessed. All the same, the scramble for this newly valuable
resource was one of the defining processes of the Americas in the second
half of the nineteenth century. The sudden opening of this valuable
frontier led not to parallel processes in the United States and Latin
America, but to a further divergence, shaped by the existing
institutional differences, especially those concerning who had access to
the land. In the United States a long series of legislative acts,
ranging from the Land Ordinance of 1785 to the Homestead Act of 1862,
gave broad access to frontier lands. Though indigenous peoples had been
sidelined, this created an egalitarian and economically dynamic
frontier. In most Latin American countries, however, the political
institutions there created a very different outcome. Frontier lands were
allocated to the politically powerful and those with wealth and
contacts, making such people even more powerful.</p>
<p>Díaz also started to dismantle many of the specific colonial
institutional legacies preventing international trade, which he
anticipated could greatly enrich him and his supporters. His model,
however, continued to be not the type of economic development he saw
north of the Rio Grande but that of Cortés, Pizarro, and de Toledo,
where the elite would make huge fortunes while the rest were excluded.
When the elite invested, the economy would grow a little, but such
economic growth was always going to be disappointing. It also came at
the expense of those lacking rights in this new order, such as the Yaqui
people of Sonora, in the hinterland of Nogales. Between 1900 and 1910,
possibly thirty thousand Yaqui were deported, essentially enslaved, and
sent to work in the henequen plantations of Yucatán. (The fibers of the
henequen plant were a valuable export, since they could be used to make
rope and twine.)</p>
<p>The persistence into the twentieth century of a specific
institutional pattern inimical to growth in Mexico and Latin America is
well illustrated by the fact that, just as in the nineteenth century,
the pattern generated economic stagnation and political instability,
civil wars and coups, as groups struggled for the benefits of power.
Díaz finally lost power to revolutionary forces in 1910. The Mexican
Revolution was followed by others in Bolivia in 1952, Cuba in 1959, and
Nicaragua in 1979. Meanwhile, sustained civil wars raged in Colombia, El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Peru. Expropriation or the threat of
expropriation of assets continued apace, with mass agrarian reforms (or
attempted reforms) in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru,
and Venezuela. Revolutions, expropriations, and political instability
came along with military governments and various types of dictatorships.
Though there was also a gradual drift toward greater political rights,
it was only in the 1990s that most Latin American countries became
democracies, and even then they remain mired in instability.</p>
<p>This instability was accompanied by mass repression and murder. The
1991 National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation Report in Chile
determined that 2,279 persons were killed for political reasons during
the Pinochet dictatorship between 1973 and 1990. Possibly 50,000 were
imprisoned and tortured, and hundreds of thousands of people were fired
from their jobs. The Guatemalan Commission for Historical Clarification
Report in 1999 identified a total of 42,275 named victims, though others
have claimed that as many as 200,000 were murdered in Guatemala between
1962 and 1996, 70,000 during the regime of General Efrain Ríos Montt,
who was able to commit these crimes with such impunity that he could run
for president in 2003; fortunately he did not win. The National
Commission on the Disappearance of Persons in Argentina put the number
of people murdered by the military there at 9,000 persons from 1976 to
1983, although it noted that the actual number could be higher.
(Estimates by human rights organizations usually place it at
30,000.)</p>
<p>MAKING A BILLION OR TWO</p>
<p>The enduring implications of the organization of colonial society and
those societies’ institutional legacies shape the modern differences
between the United States and Mexico, and thus the two parts of Nogales.
The contrast between how Bill Gates and Carlos Slim became the two
richest men in the world—Warren Buffett is also a contender—illustrates
the forces at work. The rise of Gates and Microsoft is well known, but
Gates’s status as the world’s richest person and the founder of one of
the most technologically innovative companies did not stop the U.S.
Department of Justice from filing civil actions against the Microsoft
Corporation on May 8, 1998, claiming that Microsoft had abused monopoly
power. Particularly at issue was the way that Microsoft had tied its Web
browser, Internet Explorer, to its Windows operating system. The
government had been keeping an eye on Gates for quite some time, and as
early as 1991, the Federal Trade Commission had launched an inquiry into
whether Microsoft was abusing its monopoly on PC operating systems. In
November 2001, Microsoft reached a deal with the Justice Department. It
had its wings clipped, even if the penalties were less than many
demanded.</p>
<p>In Mexico, Carlos Slim did not make his money by innovation.
Initially he excelled in stock market deals, and in buying and revamping
unprofitable firms. His major coup was the acquisition of Telmex, the
Mexican telecommunications monopoly that was privatized by President
Carlos Salinas in 1990. The government announced its intention to sell
51 percent of the voting stock (20.4 percent of total stock) in the
company in September 1989 and received bids in November 1990. Even
though Slim did not put in the highest bid, a consortium led by his
Grupo Corso won the auction. Instead of paying for the shares right
away, Slim managed to delay payment, using the dividends of Telmex
itself to pay for the stock. What was once a public monopoly now became
Slim’s monopoly, and it was hugely profitable.</p>
<p>The economic institutions that made Carlos Slim who he is are very
different from those in the United States. If you’re a Mexican
entrepreneur, entry barriers will play a crucial role at every stage of
your career. These barriers include expensive licenses you have to
obtain, red tape you have to cut through, politicians and incumbents who
will stand in your way, and the difficulty of getting funding from a
financial sector often in cahoots with the incumbents you’re trying to
compete against. These barriers can be either insurmountable, keeping
you out of lucrative areas, or your greatest friend, keeping your
competitors at bay. The difference between the two scenarios is of
course whom you know and whom you can influence—and yes, whom you can
bribe. Carlos Slim, a talented, ambitious man from a relatively modest
background of Lebanese immigrants, has been a master at obtaining
exclusive contracts; he managed to monopolize the lucrative
telecommunications market in Mexico, and then to extend his reach to the
rest of Latin America.</p>
<p>There have been challenges to Slim’s Telmex monopoly. But they have
not been successful. In 1996 Avantel, a long-distance phone provider,
petitioned the Mexican Competition Commission to check whether Telmex
had a dominant position in the telecommunications market. In 1997 the
commission declared that Telmex had substantial monopoly power with
respect to local telephony, national long-distance calls, and
international long-distance calls, among other things. But attempts by
the regulatory authorities in Mexico to limit these monopolies have come
to nothing. One reason is that Slim and Telmex can use what is known as
a recurso de amparo, literally an “appeal for protection.” An amparo is
in effect a petition to argue that a particular law does not apply to
you. The idea of the amparo dates back to the Mexican constitution of
1857 and was originally intended as a safeguard of individual rights and
freedoms. In the hands of Telmex and other Mexican monopolies, however,
it has become a formidable tool for cementing monopoly power. Rather
than protecting people’s rights, the amparo provides a loophole in
equality before the law.</p>
<p>Slim has made his money in the Mexican economy in large part thanks
to his political connections. When he has ventured into the United
States, he has not been successful. In 1999 his Grupo Curso bought the
computer retailer CompUSA. At the time, CompUSA had given a franchise to
a firm called COC Services to sell its merchandise in Mexico. Slim
immediately violated this contract with the intention of setting up his
own chain of stores, without any competition from COC. But COC sued
CompUSA in a Dallas court. There are no amparos in Dallas, so Slim lost,
and was fined 54 million. The lawyer for COC, Mark Werner, noted
afterward that “the message of this verdict is that in this global
economy, firms have to respect the rules of the United States if they
want to come here.” When Slim was subject to the institutions of the
United States, his usual tactics for making money didn’t work.</p>
<p>TOWARD A THEORY OF WORLD INEQUALITY</p>
<p>We live in an unequal world. The differences among nations are
similar to those between the two parts of Nogales, just on a larger
scale. In rich countries, individuals are healthier, live longer, and
are much better educated. They also have access to a range of amenities
and options in life, from vacations to career paths, that people in poor
countries can only dream of. People in rich countries also drive on
roads without potholes, and enjoy toilets, electricity, and running
water in their houses. They also typically have governments that do not
arbitrarily arrest or harass them; on the contrary, the governments
provide services, including education, health care, roads, and law and
order. Notable, too, is the fact that the citizens vote in elections and
have some voice in the political direction their countries take.</p>
<p>The great differences in world inequality are evident to everyone,
even to those in poor countries, though many lack access to television
or the Internet. It is the perception and reality of these differences
that drive people to cross the Rio Grande or the Mediterranean Sea
illegally to have the chance to experience rich-country living standards
and opportunities. This inequality doesn’t just have consequences for
the lives of individual people in poor countries; it also causes
grievances and resentment, with huge political consequences in the
United States and elsewhere. Understanding why these differences exist
and what causes them is our focus in this book. Developing such an
understanding is not just an end in itself, but also a first step toward
generating better ideas about how to improve the lives of billions who
still live in poverty.</p>
<p>The disparities on the two sides of the fence in Nogales are just the
tip of the iceberg. As in the rest of northern Mexico, which benefits
from trade with the United States, even if not all of it is legal, the
residents of Nogales are more prosperous than other Mexicans, whose
average annual household income is around ,000. This greater relative
prosperity of Nogales, Sonora, comes from maquiladora manufacturing
plants centered in industrial parks, the first of which was started by
Richard Campbell, Jr., a California basket manufacturer. The first
tenant was Coin-Art, a musical instrument company owned by Richard
Bosse, owner of the Artley flute and saxophone company in Nogales,
Arizona. Coin-Art was followed by Memorex (computer wiring); Avent
(hospital clothing); Grant (sunglasses); Chamberlain (a manufacturer of
garage door openers for Sears); and Samsonite (suitcases).
Significantly, all are U.S.-based businesses and businessmen, using U.S.
capital and know-how. The greater prosperity of Nogales, Sonora,
relative to the rest of Mexico, therefore, comes from outside.</p>
<p>The differences between the United States and Mexico are in turn
small compared with those across the entire globe. The average citizen
of the United States is seven times as prosperous as the average Mexican
and more than ten times as the resident of Peru or Central America. She
is about twenty times as prosperous as the average inhabitant of
sub-Saharan Africa, and almost forty times as those living in the
poorest African countries such as Mali, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone. And
it’s not just the United States. There is a small but growing group of
rich countries—mostly in Europe and North America, joined by Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan—whose citizens
enjoy very different lives from those of the inhabitants of the rest of
the globe.</p>
<p>The reason that Nogales, Arizona, is much richer than Nogales,
Sonora, is simple; it is because of the very different institutions on
the two sides of the border, which create very different incentives for
the inhabitants of Nogales, Arizona, versus Nogales, Sonora. The United
States is also far richer today than either Mexico or Peru because of
the way its institutions, both economic and political, shape the
incentives of businesses, individuals, and politicians. Each society
functions with a set of economic and political rules created and
enforced by the state and the citizens collectively. Economic
institutions shape economic incentives: the incentives to become
educated, to save and invest, to innovate and adopt new technologies,
and so on. It is the political process that determines what economic
institutions people live under, and it is the political institutions
that determine how this process works. For example, it is the political
institutions of a nation that determine the ability of citizens to
control politicians and influence how they behave. This in turn
determines whether politicians are agents of the citizens, albeit
imperfect, or are able to abuse the power entrusted to them, or that
they have usurped, to amass their own fortunes and to pursue their own
agendas, ones detrimental to those of the citizens. Political
institutions include but are not limited to written constitutions and to
whether the society is a democracy. They include the power and capacity
of the state to regulate and govern society. It is also necessary to
consider more broadly the factors that determine how political power is
distributed in society, particularly the ability of different groups to
act collectively to pursue their objectives or to stop other people from
pursuing theirs.</p>
<p>As institutions influence behavior and incentives in real life, they
forge the success or failure of nations. Individual talent matters at
every level of society, but even that needs an institutional framework
to transform it into a positive force. Bill Gates, like other legendary
figures in the information technology industry (such as Paul Allen,
Steve Ballmer, Steve Jobs, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Jeff Bezos), had
immense talent and ambition. But he ultimately responded to incentives.
The schooling system in the United States enabled Gates and others like
him to acquire a unique set of skills to complement their talents. The
economic institutions in the United States enabled these men to start
companies with ease, without facing insurmountable barriers. Those
institutions also made the financing of their projects feasible. The
U.S. labor markets enabled them to hire qualified personnel, and the
relatively competitive market environment enabled them to expand their
companies and market their products. These entrepreneurs were confident
from the beginning that their dream projects could be implemented: they
trusted the institutions and the rule of law that these generated and
they did not worry about the security of their property rights. Finally,
the political institutions ensured stability and continuity. For one
thing, they made sure that there was no risk of a dictator taking power
and changing the rules of the game, expropriating their wealth,
imprisoning them, or threatening their lives and livelihoods. They also
made sure that no particular interest in society could warp the
government in an economically disastrous direction, because political
power was both limited and distributed sufficiently broadly that a set
of economic institutions that created the incentives for prosperity
could emerge.</p>
<p>This book will show that while economic institutions are critical for
determining whether a country is poor or prosperous, it is politics and
political institutions that determine what economic institutions a
country has. Ultimately the good economic institutions of the United
States resulted from the political institutions that gradually emerged
after 1619. Our theory for world inequality shows how political and
economic institutions interact in causing poverty or prosperity, and how
different parts of the world ended up with such different sets of
institutions. Our brief review of the history of the Americas begins to
give a sense of the forces that shape political and economic
institutions. Different patterns of institutions today are deeply rooted
in the past because once society gets organized in a particular way,
this tends to persist. We’ll show that this fact comes from the way that
political and economic institutions interact.</p>
<p>This persistence and the forces that create it also explain why it is
so difficult to remove world inequality and to make poor countries
prosperous. Though institutions are the key to the differences between
the two Nogaleses and between Mexico and the United States, that doesn’t
mean there will be a consensus in Mexico to change institutions. There
is no necessity for a society to develop or adopt the institutions that
are best for economic growth or the welfare of its citizens, because
other institutions may be even better for those who control politics and
political institutions. The powerful and the rest of society will often
disagree about which set of institutions should remain in place and
which ones should be changed. Carlos Slim would not have been happy to
see his political connections disappear and the entry barriers
protecting his businesses fizzle—no matter that the entry of new
businesses would enrich millions of Mexicans. Because there is no such
consensus, what rules society ends up with is determined by politics:
who has power and how this power can be exercised. Carlos Slim has the
power to get what he wants. Bill Gates’s power is far more limited.
That’s why our theory is about not just economics but also politics. It
is about the effects of institutions on the success and failure of
nations—thus the economics of poverty and prosperity; it is also about
how institutions are determined and change over time, and how they fail
to change even when they create poverty and misery for millions—thus the
politics of poverty and prosperity.</p>
