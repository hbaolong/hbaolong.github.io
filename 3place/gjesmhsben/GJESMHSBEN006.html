SMALL DIFFERENCES AND CRITICAL JUNCTURES: THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY</h4>
<p>THE WORLD THE PLAGUE CREATED</p>
<p>IN 1346 THE BUBONIC plague, the Black Death, reached the port city of
Tana at the mouth of the River Don on the Black Sea. Transmitted by
fleas living on rats, the plague was brought from China by traders
traveling along the Silk Road, the great trans-Asian commercial artery.
Thanks to Genoese traders, the rats were soon spreading the fleas and
the plague from Tana to the entire Mediterranean. By early 1347, the
plague had reached Constantinople. In the spring of 1348, it was
spreading through France and North Africa and up the boot of Italy. The
plague wiped out about half of the population of any area it hit. Its
arrival in the Italian city of Florence was witnessed firsthand by the
Italian writer Giovanni Boccaccio. He later recalled:</p>
<p>In the face of its onrush, all the wisdom and ingenuity of man were
unavailing … the plague began, in a terrifying and extraordinary manner,
to make its disastrous effects apparent. It did not take the form it had
assumed in the East, where if anyone bled from the nose it was an
obvious portent of certain death. On the contrary, its earliest symptom
was the appearance of certain swellings in the groin or armpit, some of
which were egg-shaped whilst others were roughly the size of a common
apple … Later on the symptoms of the disease changed, and many people
began to find dark blotches and bruises on their arms, thighs and other
parts of their bodies … Against these maladies … All the advice of
physicians and all the power of medicine were profitless and unavailing
… And in most cases death occurred within three days from the appearance
of the symptoms we have described.</p>
<p>People in England knew the plague was coming their way and were well
aware of impending doom. In mid-August 1348, King Edward III asked the
Archbishop of Canterbury to organize prayers, and many bishops wrote
letters for priests to read out in church to help people cope with what
was about to hit them. Ralph of Shrewsbury, Bishop of Bath, wrote to his
priests:</p>
<p>Almighty God uses thunder, lightening [sic], and other blows which
issue from his throne to scourge the sons whom he wishes to redeem.
Accordingly, since a catastrophic pestilence from the East has arrived
in a neighboring kingdom, it is to be very much feared that, unless we
pray devoutly and incessantly, a similar pestilence will stretch its
poisonous branches into this realm, and strike down and consume the
inhabitants. Therefore we must all come before the presence of the Lord
in confession, reciting psalms.</p>
<p>It didn’t do any good. The plague hit and quickly wiped out about
half the English population. Such catastrophes can have a huge effect on
the institutions of society. Perhaps understandably, scores of people
went mad. Boccaccio noted that “some maintained that an infallible way
of warding off this appalling evil was to drink heavily, enjoy life to
the full, go round singing and merrymaking, gratify all one’s cravings
whenever the opportunity offered, and shrug the thing off as an enormous
joke … and this explains why those women who recovered were possibly
less chaste in the period that followed.” Yet the plague also had a
socially, economically, and politically transformative impact on
medieval European societies.</p>
<p>At the turn of the fourteenth century, Europe had a feudal order, an
organization of society that first emerged in Western Europe after the
collapse of the Roman Empire. It was based on a hierarchical
relationship between the king and the lords beneath him, with the
peasants at the bottom. The king owned the land and he granted it to the
lords in exchange for military services. The lords then allocated land
to peasants, in exchange for which peasants had to perform extensive
unpaid labor and were subject to many fines and taxes. Peasants, who
because of their “servile” status were thus called serfs, were tied to
the land, unable to move elsewhere without the permission of their lord,
who was not just the landlord, but also the judge, jury, and police
force. It was a highly extractive system, with wealth flowing upward
from the many peasants to the few lords.</p>
<p>The massive scarcity of labor created by the plague shook the
foundations of the feudal order. It encouraged peasants to demand that
things change. At Eynsham Abbey, for example, the peasants demanded that
many of the fines and unpaid labor be reduced. They got what they
wanted, and their new contract began with the assertion “At the time of
the mortality or pestilence, which occurred in 1349, scarcely two
tenants remained in the manor, and they expressed their intention of
leaving unless Brother Nicholas of Upton, then abbot and lord of the
manor, made a new agreement with them.” He did.</p>
<p>What happened at Eynsham happened everywhere. Peasants started to
free themselves from compulsory labor services and many obligations to
their lords. Wages started to rise. The government tried to put a stop
to this and, in 1351, passed the Statute of Laborers, which
commenced:</p>
<p>Because a great part of the people and especially of the workmen and
servants has now died in that pestilence, some, seeing the straights of
the masters and the scarcity of servants, are not willing to serve
unless they receive excessive wages … We, considering the grave
inconveniences which might come from the lack especially of ploughmen
and such labourers, have … seen fit to ordain: that every man and woman
of our kingdom of England … shall be bound to serve him who has seen fit
so to seek after him; and he shall take only the wages liveries, meed or
salary which, in the places where he sought to serve, were accustomed to
be paid in the twentieth year of our reign of England [King Edward III
came to the throne on January 25, 1327, so the reference here is to
1347] or the five or six common years next preceding.</p>
<p>The statute in effect tried to fix wages at the levels paid before
the Black Death. Particularly concerning for the English elite was
“enticement,” the attempt by one lord to attract the scarce peasants of
another. The solution was to make prison the punishment for leaving
employment without permission of the employer:</p>
<p>And if a reaper or mower, or other workman or servant, of whatever
standing or condition he be, who is retained in the service of any one,
do depart from the said service before the end of the term agreed,
without permission or reasonable cause, he shall undergo the penalty of
imprisonment, and let no one … moreover, pay or permit to be paid to any
one more wages, livery, meed or salary than was customary as has been
said.</p>
<p>The attempt by the English state to stop the changes of institutions
and wages that came in the wake of the Black Death didn’t work. In 1381
the Peasants’ Revolt broke out, and the rebels, under the leadership of
Wat Tyler, even captured most of London. Though they were ultimately
defeated, and Tyler was executed, there were no more attempts to enforce
the Statute of Laborers. Feudal labor services dwindled away, an
inclusive labor market began to emerge in England, and wages rose.</p>
<p>The plague seems to have hit most of the world, and everywhere a
similar fraction of the population perished. Thus the demographic impact
in Eastern Europe was the same as in England and Western Europe. The
social and economic forces at play were also the same. Labor was scarce
and people demanded greater freedoms. But in the East, a more powerful
contradictory logic was at work. Fewer people meant higher wages in an
inclusive labor market. But this gave lords a greater incentive to keep
the labor market extractive and the peasants servile. In England this
motivation had been in play, too, as reflected in the Statute of
Laborers. But workers had sufficient power that they got their way. Not
so in Eastern Europe. After the plague, Eastern landlords started to
take over large tracts of land and expand their holdings, which were
already larger than those in Western Europe. Towns were weaker and less
populous, and rather than becoming freer, workers began to see their
already existing freedoms encroached on.</p>
<p>The effects became especially clear after 1500, when Western Europe
began to demand the agricultural goods, such as wheat, rye, and
livestock, produced in the East. Eighty percent of the imports of rye
into Amsterdam came from the Elbe, Vistula, and Oder river valleys. Soon
half of the Netherlands’ booming trade was with Eastern Europe. As
Western demand expanded, Eastern landlords ratcheted up their control
over the labor force to expand their supply. It was to be called the
Second Serfdom, distinct and more intense than its original form of the
early Middle Ages. Lords increased the taxes they levied on their
tenants’ own plots and took half of the gross output. In Korczyn,
Poland, all work for the lord in 1533 was paid. But by 1600 nearly half
was unpaid forced labor. In 1500, workers in Mecklenberg, in eastern
Germany, owed only a few days’ unpaid labor services a year. By 1550 it
was one day a week, and by 1600, three days per week. Workers’ children
had to work for the lord for free for several years. In Hungary,
landlords took complete control of the land in 1514, legislating one day
a week of unpaid labor services for each worker. In 1550 this was raised
to two days per week. By the end of the century, it was three days.
Serfs subject to these rules made up 90 percent of the rural population
by this time.</p>
<p>Though in 1346 there were few differences between Western and Eastern
Europe in terms of political and economic institutions, by 1600 they
were worlds apart. In the West, workers were free of feudal dues, fines,
and regulations and were becoming a key part of a booming market
economy. In the East, they were also involved in such an economy, but as
coerced serfs growing the food and agricultural goods demanded in the
West. It was a market economy, but not an inclusive one. This
institutional divergence was the result of a situation where the
differences between these areas initially seemed very small: in the
East, lords were a little better organized; they had slightly more
rights and more consolidated landholdings. Towns were weaker and
smaller, peasants less organized. In the grand scheme of history, these
were small differences. Yet these small differences between the East and
the West became very consequential for the lives of their populations
and for the future path of institutional development when the feudal
order was shaken up by the Black Death.</p>
<p>The Black Death is a vivid example of a critical juncture, a major
event or confluence of factors disrupting the existing economic or
political balance in society. A critical juncture is a double-edged
sword that can cause a sharp turn in the trajectory of a nation. On the
one hand it can open the way for breaking the cycle of extractive
institutions and enable more inclusive ones to emerge, as in England. Or
it can intensify the emergence of extractive institutions, as was the
case with the Second Serfdom in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Understanding how history and critical junctures shape the path of
economic and political institutions enables us to have a more complete
theory of the origins of differences in poverty and prosperity. In
addition, it enables us to account for the lay of the land today and why
some nations make the transition to inclusive economic and political
institutions while others do not.</p>
<p>THE MAKING OF INCLUSIVE INSTITUTIONS</p>
<p>England was unique among nations when it made the breakthrough to
sustained economic growth in the seventeenth century. Major economic
changes were preceded by a political revolution that brought a distinct
set of economic and political institutions, much more inclusive than
those of any previous society. These institutions would have profound
implications not only for economic incentives and prosperity, but also
for who would reap the benefits of prosperity. They were based not on
consensus but, rather, were the result of intense conflict as different
groups competed for power, contesting the authority of others and
attempting to structure institutions in their own favor. The culmination
of the institutional struggles of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries were two landmark events: the English Civil War between 1642
and 1651, and particularly the Glorious Revolution of 1688.</p>
<p>The Glorious Revolution limited the power of the king and the
executive, and relocated to Parliament the power to determine economic
institutions. At the same time, it opened up the political system to a
broad cross section of society, who were able to exert considerable
influence over the way the state functioned. The Glorious Revolution was
the foundation for creating a pluralistic society, and it built on and
accelerated a process of political centralization. It created the
world’s first set of inclusive political institutions.</p>
<p>As a consequence, economic institutions also started becoming more
inclusive. Neither slavery nor the severe economic restrictions of the
feudal medieval period, such as serfdom, existed in England at the
beginning of the seventeenth century. Nevertheless, there were many
restrictions on economic activities people could engage in. Both the
domestic and international economy were choked by monopolies. The state
engaged in arbitrary taxation and manipulated the legal system. Most
land was caught in archaic forms of property rights that made it
impossible to sell and risky to invest in.</p>
<p>This changed after the Glorious Revolution. The government adopted a
set of economic institutions that provided incentives for investment,
trade, and innovation. It steadfastly enforced property rights,
including patents granting property rights for ideas, thereby providing
a major stimulus to innovation. It protected law and order. Historically
unprecedented was the application of English law to all citizens.
Arbitrary taxation ceased, and monopolies were abolished almost
completely. The English state aggressively promoted mercantile
activities and worked to promote domestic industry, not only by removing
barriers to the expansion of industrial activity but also by lending the
full power of the English navy to defend mercantile interests. By
rationalizing property rights, it facilitated the construction of
infrastructure, particularly roads, canals, and later railways, that
would prove to be crucial for industrial growth.</p>
<p>These foundations decisively changed incentives for people and
impelled the engines of prosperity, paving the way for the Industrial
Revolution. First and foremost, the Industrial Revolution depended on
major technological advances exploiting the knowledge base that had
accumulated in Europe during the past centuries. It was a radical break
from the past, made possible by scientific inquiry and the talents of a
number of unique individuals. The full force of this revolution came
from the market that created profitable opportunities for technologies
to be developed and applied. It was the inclusive nature of markets that
allowed people to allocate their talents to the right lines of business.
It also relied on education and skills, for it was the relatively high
levels of education, at least by the standards of the time, that enabled
the emergence of entrepreneurs with the vision to employ new
technologies for their businesses and to find workers with the skills to
use them.</p>
<p>It is not a coincidence that the Industrial Revolution started in
England a few decades following the Glorious Revolution. The great
inventors such as James Watt (perfecter of the steam engine), Richard
Trevithick (the builder of the first steam locomotive), Richard
Arkwright (the inventor of the spinning frame), and Isambard Kingdom
Brunel (the creator of several revolutionary steamships) were able to
take up the economic opportunities generated by their ideas, were
confident that their property rights would be respected, and had access
to markets where their innovations could be profitably sold and used. In
1775, just after he had the patent renewed on his steam engine, which he
called his “Fire engine,” James Watt wrote to his father:</p>
<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>After a series of various and violent Oppositions I have at last got
an Act of Parliament vesting the property of my new Fire engines in me
and my Assigns, throughout Great Britain andandandand the plantations
for twenty five years to come, which I hope will be very beneficial to
me, as there is already considerable demand for them.</p>
<p>This letter reveals two things. First, Watt was motivated by the
market opportunities he anticipated, by the “considerable demand” in
Great Britain and its plantations, the English overseas colonies.
Second, it shows how he was able to influence Parliament to get what he
wanted since it was responsive to the appeals of individuals and
innovators.</p>
<p>The technological advances, the drive of businesses to expand and
invest, and the efficient use of skills and talent were all made
possible by the inclusive economic institutions that England developed.
These in turn were founded on her inclusive political institutions.</p>
<p>England developed these inclusive political institutions because of
two factors. First were political institutions, including a centralized
state, that enabled her to take the next radical—in fact,
unprecedented—step toward inclusive institutions with the onset of the
Glorious Revolution. While this factor distinguished England from much
of the world, it did not significantly differentiate it from Western
European countries such as France and Spain. More important was the
second factor. The events leading up to the Glorious Revolution forged a
broad and powerful coalition able to place durable constraints on the
power of the monarchy and the executive, which were forced to be open to
the demands of this coalition. This laid the foundations for pluralistic
political institutions, which then enabled the development of economic
institutions that would underpin the first Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>SMALL DIFFERENCES THAT MATTER</p>
<p>World inequality dramatically increased with the British, or English,
Industrial Revolution because only some parts of the world adopted the
innovations and new technologies that men such as Arkwright and Watt,
and the many who followed, developed. The response of different nations
to this wave of technologies, which determined whether they would
languish in poverty or achieve sustained economic growth, was largely
shaped by the different historical paths of their institutions. By the
middle of the eighteenth century, there were already notable differences
in political and economic institutions around the world. But where did
these differences come from?</p>
<p>English political institutions were on their way to much greater
pluralism by 1688, compared with those in France and Spain, but if we go
back in time one hundred years, to 1588, the differences shrink to
almost nothing. All three countries were ruled by relatively absolutist
monarchs: Elizabeth I in England, Philip II in Spain, and Henry II in
France. All were battling with assemblies of citizens—such as the
Parliament in England, the Cortes in Spain, and the Estates-General in
France—that were demanding more rights and control over the monarchy.
These assemblies all had somewhat different powers and scopes. For
instance, the English Parliament and the Spanish Cortes had power over
taxation, while the Estates-General did not. In Spain this mattered
little, because after 1492 the Spanish Crown had a vast American empire
and benefited massively from the gold and silver found there. In England
the situation was different. Elizabeth I was far less financially
independent, so she had to beg Parliament for more taxes. In exchange,
Parliament demanded concessions, in particular restrictions on the right
of Elizabeth to create monopolies. It was a conflict Parliament
gradually won. In Spain the Cortes lost a similar conflict. Trade wasn’t
just monopolized; it was monopolized by the Spanish monarchy.</p>
<p>These distinctions, which initially appeared small, started to matter
a great deal in the seventeenth century. Though the Americas had been
discovered by 1492 and Vasco da Gama had reached India by rounding the
Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, in 1498, it was only
after 1600 that a huge expansion of world trade, particularly in the
Atlantic, started to take place. In 1585 the first English colonization
of North America began at Roanoke, in what is now North Carolina. In
1600 the English East India Company was formed. In 1602 it was followed
by the Dutch equivalent. In 1607 the colony of Jamestown was founded by
the Virginia Company. By the 1620s the Caribbean was being colonized,
with Barbados occupied in 1627. France was also expanding in the
Atlantic, founding Quebec City in 1608 as the capital of New France in
what is now Canada. The consequences of this economic expansion for
institutions were very different for England than for Spain and France
because of small initial differences.</p>
<p>Elizabeth I and her successors could not monopolize the trade with
the Americas. Other European monarchs could. So while in England,
Atlantic trade and colonization started creating a large group of
wealthy traders with few links to the Crown, this was not the case in
Spain or France. The English traders resented royal control and demanded
changes in political institutions and the restriction of royal
prerogatives. They played a critical role in the English Civil War and
the Glorious Revolution. Similar conflicts took place everywhere. French
kings, for example, faced the Fronde Rebellion between 1648 and 1652.
The difference was that in England it was far more likely that the
opponents to absolutism would prevail because they were relatively
wealthy and more numerous than the opponents to absolutism in Spain and
France.</p>
<p>The divergent paths of English, French, and Spanish societies in the
seventeenth century illustrate the importance of the interplay of small
institutional differences with critical junctures. During critical
junctures, a major event or confluence of factors disrupts the existing
balance of political or economic power in a nation. These can affect
only a single country, such as the death of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1976,
which at first created a critical juncture only for Communist China.
Often, however, critical junctures affect a whole set of societies, in
the way that, for example, colonization and then decolonization affected
most of the globe.</p>
<p>Such critical junctures are important because there are formidable
barriers against gradual improvements, resulting from the synergy
between extractive political and economic institutions and the support
they give each other. The persistence of this feedback loop creates a
vicious circle. Those who benefit from the status quo are wealthy and
well organized, and can effectively fight major changes that will take
away their economic privileges and political power.</p>
<p>Once a critical juncture happens, the small differences that matter
are the initial institutional differences that put in motion very
different responses. This is the reason why the relatively small
institutional differences in England, France, and Spain led to
fundamentally different development paths. The paths resulted from the
critical juncture created by the economic opportunities presented to
Europeans by Atlantic trade.</p>
<p>Even if small institutional differences matter greatly during
critical junctures, not all institutional differences are small, and
naturally, larger institutional differences lead to even more divergent
patterns during such junctures. While the institutional differences
between England and France were small in 1588, the differences between
Western and Eastern Europe were much greater. In the West, strong
centralized states such as England, France, and Spain had latent
constitutional institutions (Parliament, the Estates-General, and the
Cortes). There were also underlying similarities in economic
institutions, such as the lack of serfdom.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe was a different matter. The kingdom of
Poland-Lithuania, for example, was ruled by an elite class called the
Szlachta, who were so powerful they had even introduced elections for
kings. This was not absolute rule as in France under Louis XIV, the Sun
King, but absolutism of an elite, extractive political institutions all
the same. The Szlachta ruled over a mostly rural society dominated by
serfs, who had no freedom of movement or economic opportunities. Farther
east, the Russian emperor Peter the Great was also consolidating an
absolutism far more intense and extractive than even Louis XIV could
manage. Map 8 provides one simple way of seeing the extent of the
divergence between Western and Eastern Europe at the beginning of the
nineteenth century. It plots whether or not a country still had serfdom
in 1800. Countries that appear dark did; those that are light did not.
Eastern Europe is dark; Western Europe is light.</p>
<p>Yet the institutions of Western Europe had not always been so
different from those in the East. They began, as we saw earlier, to
diverge in the fourteenth century when the Black Death hit in 1346.
There were small differences between political and economic institutions
in Western and Eastern Europe. England and Hungary were even ruled by
members of the same family, the Angevins. The more important
institutional differences that emerged after the Black Death then
created the background upon which the more significant divergence
between the East and the West would play out during the seventeenth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.</p>
<p>But where do the small institutional differences that start this
process of divergence arise in the first place? Why did Eastern Europe
have different political and economic institutions than the West in the
fourteenth century? Why was the balance of power between Crown and
Parliament different in England than in France and Spain? As we will see
in the next chapter, even societies that are far less complex than our
modern society create political and economic institutions that have
powerful effects on the lives of their members. This is true even for
hunter-gatherers, as we know from surviving societies such as the San
people of modern Botswana, who do not farm or even live in permanent
settlements.</p>
<p>No two societies create the same institutions; they will have
distinct customs, different systems of property rights, and different
ways of dividing a killed animal or loot stolen from another group. Some
will recognize the authority of elders, others will not; some will
achieve some degree of political centralization early on, but not
others. Societies are constantly subject to economic and political
conflict that is resolved in different ways because of specific
historical differences, the role of individuals, or just random
factors.</p>
<p>These differences are often small to start with, but they cumulate,
creating a process of institutional drift. Just as two isolated
populations of organisms will drift apart slowly in a process of genetic
drift, because random genetic mutations cumulate, two otherwise similar
societies will also slowly drift apart institutionally. Though, just
like genetic drift, institutional drift has no predetermined path and
does not even need to be cumulative; over centuries it can lead to
perceptible, sometimes important differences. The differences created by
institutional drift become especially consequential, because they
influence how society reacts to changes in economic or political
circumstances during critical junctures.</p>
<p>The richly divergent patterns of economic development around the
world hinge on the interplay of critical junctures and institutional
drift. Existing political and economic institutions—sometimes shaped by
a long process of institutional drift and sometimes resulting from
divergent responses to prior critical junctures—create the anvil upon
which future change will be forged. The Black Death and the expansion of
world trade after 1600 were both major critical junctures for European
powers and interacted with different initial institutions to create a
major divergence. Because in 1346 in Western Europe peasants had more
power and autonomy than they did in Eastern Europe, the Black Death led
to the dissolution of feudalism in the West and the Second Serfdom in
the East. Because Eastern and Western Europe had started to diverge in
the fourteenth century, the new economic opportunities of the
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries would also have
fundamentally different implications for these different parts of
Europe. Because in 1600 the grip of the Crown was weaker in England than
in France and Spain, Atlantic trade opened the way to the creation of
new institutions with greater pluralism in England, while strengthening
the French and Spanish monarchs.</p>
<p>THE CONTINGENT PATH OF HISTORY</p>
<p>The outcomes of the events during critical junctures are shaped by
the weight of history, as existing economic and political institutions
shape the balance of power and delineate what is politically feasible.
The outcome, however, is not historically predetermined but contingent.
The exact path of institutional development during these periods depends
on which one of the opposing forces will succeed, which groups will be
able to form effective coalitions, and which leaders will be able to
structure events to their advantage.</p>
<p>The role of contingency can be illustrated by the origins of
inclusive political institutions in England. Not only was there nothing
preordained in the victory of the groups vying for limiting the power of
the Crown and for more pluralistic institutions in the Glorious
Revolution of 1688, but the entire path leading up to this political
revolution was at the mercy of contingent events. The victory of the
winning groups was inexorably linked to the critical juncture created by
the rise of Atlantic trade that enriched and emboldened merchants
opposing the Crown. But a century earlier it was far from obvious that
England would have any ability to dominate the seas, colonize many parts
of the Caribbean and North America, or capture so much of the lucrative
trade with the Americas and the East. Neither Elizabeth I nor other
Tudor monarchs before her had built a powerful, unified navy. The
English navy relied on privateers and independent merchant ships and was
much less powerful than the Spanish fleet. The profits of the Atlantic
nonetheless attracted these privateers, challenging the Spanish monopoly
of the ocean. In 1588 the Spanish decided to put an end to these
challenges to their monopoly, as well as to English meddling in the
Spanish Netherlands, at the time fighting against Spain for
independence.</p>
<p>The Spanish monarch Philip II sent a powerful fleet, the Armada,
commanded by the Duke of Medina Sidonia. It appeared a foregone
conclusion to many that the Spanish would conclusively defeat the
English, solidify their monopoly of the Atlantic, and probably overthrow
Elizabeth I, perhaps ultimately gaining control of the British Isles.
Yet something very different transpired. Bad weather and strategic
mistakes by Sidonia, who had been put in charge at the last minute after
a more experienced commander died, made the Spanish Armada lose their
advantage. Against all odds, the English destroyed much of the fleet of
their more powerful opponents. The Atlantic seas were now open to the
English on more equal terms. Without this unlikely victory for the
English, the events that would create the transformative critical
juncture and spawn the distinctively pluralistic political institutions
of post-1688 England would never have got moving. Map 9 shows the trail
of Spanish shipwrecks as the Armada was chased right around the British
Isles.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody in 1588 could foresee the consequences of the
fortunate English victory. Few probably understood at the time that this
would create a critical juncture leading up to a major political
revolution a century later.</p>
<p>There should be no presumption that any critical juncture will lead
to a successful political revolution or to change for the better.
History is full of examples of revolutions and radical movements
replacing one tyranny with another, in a pattern that the German
sociologist Robert Michels dubbed the iron law of oligarchy, a
particularly pernicious form of the vicious circle. The end of
colonialism in the decades following the Second World War created
critical junctures for many former colonies. However, in most cases in
sub-Saharan Africa and many in Asia, the postindependence governments
simply took a page out of Robert Michels’s book and repeated and
intensified the abuses of their predecessors, often severely narrowing
the distribution of political power, dismantling constraints, and
undermining the already meager incentives that economic institutions
provided for investment and economic progress. It was only in a few
cases, societies such as Botswana (see this page), that critical
junctures were used to launch a process of political and economic change
that paved the way for economic growth.</p>
<p>Critical junctures can also result in major change toward rather than
away from extractive institutions. Inclusive institutions, even though
they have their own feedback loop, the virtuous circle, can also reverse
course and become gradually more extractive because of challenges during
critical junctures—and whether this happens is, again, contingent. The
Venetian Republic, as we will see in chapter 6, made major strides
toward inclusive political and economic institutions in the medieval
period. But while such institutions became gradually stronger in England
after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in Venice they ultimately
transformed themselves into extractive institutions under the control of
a narrow elite that monopolized both economic opportunities and
political power.</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING THE LAY OF THE LAND</p>
<p>The emergence of a market economy based on inclusive institutions and
sustained economic growth in eighteenth-century England sent ripples all
around the world, not least because it allowed England to colonize a
large part of it. But if the influence of English economic growth
certainly spread around the globe, the economic and political
institutions that created it did not automatically do so. The diffusion
of the Industrial Revolution had different effects on the world in the
same way that the Black Death had different effects on Western and
Eastern Europe, and in the same way that the expansion of Atlantic trade
had different effects in England and Spain. It was the institutions in
place in different parts of the world that determined the impact, and
these institutions were indeed different—small differences had been
amplified over time by prior critical junctures. These institutional
differences and their implications have tended to persist to the present
due to the vicious and virtuous circles, albeit imperfectly, and are the
key to understanding both how world inequality emerged and the nature of
the lay of the land around us.</p>
<p>Some parts of the world developed institutions that were very close
to those in England, though by a very different route. This was
particularly true of some European “settler colonies” such as Australia,
Canada, and the United States, though their institutions were just
forming as the Industrial Revolution was getting under way. As we saw in
chapter 1, a process starting with the foundation of the Jamestown
colony in 1607 and culminating in the War of Independence and the
enactment of the U.S. Constitution shares many of the same
characteristics as the long struggle in England of Parliament against
the monarchy, for it also led to a centralized state with pluralistic
political institutions. The Industrial Revolution then spread rapidly to
such countries.</p>
<p>Western Europe, experiencing many of the same historical processes,
had institutions similar to England at the time of the Industrial
Revolution. There were small but consequential differences between
England and the rest, which is why the Industrial Revolution happened in
England and not France. This revolution then created an entirely new
situation and considerably different sets of challenges to European
regimes, which in turn spawned a new set of conflicts culminating in the
French Revolution. The French Revolution was another critical juncture
that led the institutions of Western Europe to converge with those of
England, while Eastern Europe diverged further.</p>
<p>The rest of the world followed different institutional trajectories.
European colonization set the stage for institutional divergence in the
Americas, where in contrast to the inclusive institutions developed in
the United States and Canada extractive ones emerged in Latin America,
which explains the patterns of inequality we see in the Americas. The
extractive political and economic institutions of the Spanish
conquistadors in Latin America have endured, condemning much of the
region to poverty. Argentina and Chile have, however, fared better than
most other countries in the region. They had few indigenous people or
mineral riches and were “neglected” while the Spanish focused on the
lands occupied by the Aztec, Maya, and Incan civilizations. Not
coincidentally, the poorest part of Argentina is the northwest, the only
section of the country integrated into the Spanish colonial economy. Its
persistent poverty, the legacy of extractive institutions, is similar to
that created by the Potosí mita in Bolivia and Peru (this page–this
page).</p>
<p>Africa was the part of the world with the institutions least able to
take advantage of the opportunities made available by the Industrial
Revolution. For at least the last one thousand years, outside of small
pockets and during limited periods of time, Africa has lagged behind the
rest of the world in terms of technology, political development, and
prosperity. It is the part of the world where centralized states formed
very late and very tenuously. Where they did form, they were likely as
highly absolutist as the Kongo and often short lived, usually
collapsing. Africa shares this trajectory of lack of state
centralization with countries such as Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nepal,
which have also failed to impose order over their territories and create
anything resembling stability to achieve even a modicum of economic
progress. Though located in very different parts of the world,
Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nepal have much in common institutionally with
most nations in sub-Saharan Africa, and are thus some of the poorest
countries in the world today.</p>
<p>How African institutions evolved into their present-day extractive
form again illustrates the process of institutional drift punctuated by
critical junctures, but this time often with highly perverse outcomes,
particularly during the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade. There
were new economic opportunities for the Kingdom of Kongo when European
traders arrived. The long-distance trade that transformed Europe also
transformed the Kingdom of Kongo, but again, initial institutional
differences mattered. Kongolese absolutism transmogrified from
completely dominating society, with extractive economic institutions
that merely captured all the agricultural output of its citizens, to
enslaving people en masse and selling them to the Portuguese in exchange
for guns and luxury goods for the Kongolese elite.</p>
<p>The initial differences between England and Kongo meant that while
new long-distance trade opportunities created a critical juncture toward
pluralistic political institutions in the former, they also extinguished
any hope of absolutism being defeated in the Kongo. In much of Africa
the substantial profits to be had from slaving led not only to its
intensification and even more insecure property rights for the people
but also to intense warfare and the destruction of many existing
institutions; within a few centuries, any process of state
centralization was totally reversed, and many of the African states had
largely collapsed. Though some new, and sometimes powerful, states did
form to exploit the slave trade, they were based on warfare and plunder.
The critical juncture of the discovery of the Americas may have helped
England develop inclusive institutions but it made institutions in
Africa even more extractive.</p>
<p>Though the slave trade mostly ended after 1807, subsequent European
colonialism not only threw into reverse nascent economic modernization
in parts of southern and western Africa but also cut off any possibility
of indigenous institutional reform. This meant that even outside of
areas such as Congo, Madagascar, Namibia, and Tanzania, the areas where
plunder, mass disruption, and even whole-scale murder were the rule,
there was little chance for Africa to change its institutional path.</p>
<p>Even worse, the structures of colonial rule left Africa with a more
complex and pernicious institutional legacy in the 1960s than at the
start of the colonial period. The development of the political and
economic institutions in many African colonies meant that rather than
creating a critical juncture for improvements in their institutions,
independence created an opening for unscrupulous leaders to take over
and intensify the extraction that European colonialists presided over.
The political incentives these structures created led to a style of
politics that reproduced the historical patterns of insecure and
inefficient property rights under states with strong absolutist
tendencies but nonetheless lacking any centralized authority over their
territories.</p>
<p>The Industrial Revolution has still not spread to Africa because that
continent has experienced a long vicious circle of the persistence and
re-creation of extractive political and economic institutions. Botswana
is the exception. As we will see (this page–this page), in the
nineteenth century, King Khama, the grandfather of Botswana’s first
prime minister at independence, Seretse Khama, initiated institutional
changes to modernize the political and economic institutions of his
tribe. Quite uniquely, these changes were not destroyed in the colonial
period, partly as a consequence of Khama’s and other chiefs’ clever
challenges to colonial authority. Their interplay with the critical
juncture that independence from colonial rule created laid the
foundations for Botswana’s economic and political success. It was
another case of small historical differences mattering.</p>
<p>There is a tendency to see historical events as the inevitable
consequences of deep-rooted forces. While we place great emphasis on how
the history of economic and political institutions creates vicious and
virtuous circles, contingency, as we have emphasized in the context of
the development of English institutions, can always be a factor. Seretse
Khama, studying in England in the 1940s, fell in love with Ruth
Williams, a white woman. As a result, the racist apartheid regime in
South Africa persuaded the English government to ban him from the
protectorate, then called Bechuanaland (whose administration was under
the High Commissioner of South Africa), and he resigned his kingship.
When he returned to lead the anticolonial struggle, he did so with the
intention not of entrenching the traditional institutions but of
adapting them to the modern world. Khama was an extraordinary man,
uninterested in personal wealth and dedicated to building his country.
Most other African countries have not been so fortunate. Both things
mattered, the historical development of institutions in Botswana and
contingent factors that led these to be built on rather than overthrown
or distorted as they were elsewhere in Africa.</p>
<p>IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, absolutism not so different from that in
Africa or Eastern Europe was blocking the path of industrialization in
much of Asia. In China, the state was strongly absolutist, and
independent cities, merchants, and industrialists were either
nonexistent or much weaker politically. China was a major naval power
and heavily involved in long-distance trade centuries before the
Europeans. But it had turned away from the oceans just at the wrong
time, when Ming emperors decided in the late fourteenth and early
fifteenth centuries that increased long-distance trade and the creative
destruction that it might bring would be likely to threaten their
rule.</p>
<p>In India, institutional drift worked differently and led to the
development of a uniquely rigid hereditary caste system that limited the
functioning of markets and the allocation of labor across occupations
much more severely than the feudal order in medieval Europe. It also
underpinned another strong form of absolutism under the Mughal rulers.
Most European countries had similar systems in the Middle Ages. Modern
Anglo-Saxon surnames such as Baker, Cooper, and Smith are direct
descendants of hereditary occupational categories. Bakers baked, coopers
made barrels, and smiths forged metals. But these categories were never
as rigid as Indian caste distinctions and gradually became meaningless
as predictors of a person’s occupation. Though Indian merchants did
trade throughout the Indian Ocean, and a major textile industry
developed, the caste system and Mughal absolutism were serious
impediments to the development of inclusive economic institutions in
India. By the nineteenth century, things were even less hospitable for
industrialization as India became an extractive colony of the English.
China was never formally colonized by a European power, but after the
English successfully defeated the Chinese in the Opium Wars between 1839
and 1842, and then again between 1856 and 1860, China had to sign a
series of humiliating treaties and allow European exports to enter. As
China, India, and others failed to take advantage of commercial and
industrial opportunities, Asia, except for Japan, lagged behind as
Western Europe was forging ahead.</p>
<p>THE COURSE OF institutional development that Japan charted in the
nineteenth century again illustrates the interaction between critical
junctures and small differences created by institutional drift. Japan,
like China, was under absolutist rule. The Tokugawa family took over in
1600 and ruled over a feudal system that also banned international
trade. Japan, too, faced a critical juncture created by Western
intervention as four U.S. warships, commanded by Matthew C. Perry,
entered Edo Bay in July 1853, demanding trade concessions similar to
those England obtained from the Chinese in the Opium Wars. But this
critical juncture played out very differently in Japan. Despite their
proximity and frequent interactions, by the nineteenth century China and
Japan had already drifted apart institutionally.</p>
<p>While Tokugawa rule in Japan was absolutist and extractive, it had
only a tenuous hold on the leaders of the other major feudal domains and
was susceptible to challenge. Even though there were peasant rebellions
and civil strife, absolutism in China was stronger, and the opposition
less organized and autonomous. There were no equivalents of the leaders
of the other domains in China who could challenge the absolutist rule of
the emperor and trace an alternative institutional path. This
institutional difference, in many ways small relative to the differences
separating China and Japan from Western Europe, had decisive
consequences during the critical juncture created by the forceful
arrival of the English and Americans. China continued in its absolutist
path after the Opium Wars, while the U.S. threat cemented the opposition
to Tokugawa rule in Japan and led to a political revolution, the Meiji
Restoration, as we will see in chapter 10. This Japanese political
revolution enabled more inclusive political institutions and much more
inclusive economic institutions to develop, and laid the foundations for
subsequent rapid Japanese growth, while China languished under
absolutism.</p>
<p>How Japan reacted to the threat posed by U.S. warships, by starting a
process of fundamental institutional transformation, helps us understand
another aspect of the lay of the land around us: transitions from
stagnation to rapid growth. South Korea, Taiwan, and finally China
achieved breakneck rates of economic growth since the Second World War
through a path similar to the one that Japan took. In each of these
cases, growth was preceded by historic changes in the countries’
economic institutions—though not always in their political institutions,
as the Chinese case highlights.</p>
<p>The logic of how episodes of rapid growth come to an abrupt end and
are reversed is also related. In the same way that decisive steps toward
inclusive economic institutions can ignite rapid economic growth, a
sharp turn away from inclusive institutions can lead to economic
stagnation. But more often, collapses of rapid growth, such as in
Argentina or the Soviet Union, are a consequence of growth under
extractive institutions coming to an end. As we have seen, this can
happen either because of infighting over the spoils of extraction,
leading to the collapse of the regime, or because the inherent lack of
innovation and creative destruction under extractive institutions puts a
limit on sustained growth. How the Soviets ran hard into these limits
will be discussed in greater detail in the next chapter.</p>
<p>IF THE POLITICAL and economic institutions of Latin America over the
past five hundred years were shaped by Spanish colonialism, those of the
Middle East were shaped by Ottoman colonialism. In 1453 the Ottomans
under Sultan Mehmet II captured Constantinople, making it their capital.
During the rest of the century, the Ottomans conquered large parts of
the Balkans and most of the rest of Turkey. In the first half of the
sixteenth century, Ottoman rule spread throughout the Middle East and
North Africa. By 1566, at the death of Sultan Süleyman I, known as the
Magnificent, their empire stretched from Tunisia in the East, through
Egypt, all the way to Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula, and on to what is
now modern Iraq. The Ottoman state was absolutist, with the sultan
accountable to few and sharing power with none. The economic
institutions the Ottomans imposed were highly extractive. There was no
private property in land, which all formally belonged to the state.
Taxation of land and agricultural output, together with loot from war,
was the main source of government revenues. However, the Ottoman state
did not dominate the Middle East in the same way that it could dominate
its heartland in Anatolia or even to the extent that the Spanish state
dominated Latin American society. The Ottoman state was continuously
challenged by Bedouins and other tribal powers in the Arabian Peninsula.
It lacked not only the ability to impose a stable order in much of the
Middle East but also the administrative capacity to collect taxes. So it
“farmed” them out to individuals, selling off the right to others to
collect taxes in whatever way they could. These tax farmers became
autonomous and powerful. Rates of taxation in the Middle Eastern
territories were very high, varying between one-half or two-thirds of
what farmers produced. Much of this revenue was kept by the tax farmers.
Because the Ottoman state failed to establish a stable order in these
areas, property rights were far from secure, and there was a great deal
of lawlessness and banditry as armed groups vied for local control. In
Palestine, for example, the situation was so dire that starting in the
late sixteenth century, peasants left the most fertile land and moved up
to mountainous areas, which gave them greater protection against
banditry.</p>
<p>Extractive economic institutions in the urban areas of the Ottoman
Empire were no less stifling. Commerce was under state control, and
occupations were strictly regulated by guilds and monopolies. The
consequence was that at the time of the Industrial Revolution the
economic institutions of the Middle East were extractive. The region
stagnated economically.</p>
<p>By the 1840s, the Ottomans were trying to reform institutions—for
example, by reversing tax farming and getting locally autonomous groups
under control. But absolutism persisted until the First World War, and
reform efforts were thwarted by the usual fear of creative destruction
and the anxiety among elite groups that they would lose economically or
politically. While Ottoman reformers talked of introducing private
property rights to land in order to increase agricultural productivity,
the status quo persisted because of the desire for political control and
taxation. Ottoman colonization was followed by European colonization
after 1918. When European control ended, the same dynamics we have seen
in sub-Saharan Africa took hold, with extractive colonial institutions
taken over by independent elites. In some cases, such as the monarchy of
Jordan, these elites were direct creations of the colonial powers, but
this, too, happened frequently in Africa, as we will see. Middle Eastern
countries without oil today have income levels similar to poor Latin
American nations. They did not suffer from such immiserizing forces as
the slave trade, and they benefited for a longer period from flows of
technology from Europe. In the Middle Ages, the Middle East itself was
also a relatively advanced part of the world economically. So today it
is not as poor as Africa, but the majority of its people still live in
poverty.</p>
<p>WE HAVE SEEN that neither geographic- nor cultural- nor
ignorance-based theories are helpful for explaining the lay of the land
around us. They do not provide a satisfactory account for the prominent
patterns of world inequality: the fact that the process of economic
divergence started with the Industrial Revolution in England during the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and then spread to Western Europe
and to European settler colonies; the persistent divergence between
different parts of the Americas; the poverty of Africa or the Middle
East; the divergence between Eastern and Western Europe; and the
transitions from stagnation to growth and the sometimes abrupt end to
growth spurts. Our institutional theory does.</p>
<p>In the remaining chapters, we will discuss in greater detail how this
institutional theory works and illustrate the wide range of phenomena it
can account for. These range from the origins of the Neolithic
Revolution to the collapse of several civilizations, either because of
the intrinsic limits to growth under extractive institutions or because
of limited steps toward inclusiveness being reversed.</p>
<p>We will see how and why decisive steps toward inclusive political
institutions were taken during the Glorious Revolution in England. We
will look more specifically at the following:</p>
<p>• How inclusive institutions emerged from the interplay of the
critical juncture created by Atlantic trade and the nature of
preexisting English institutions.</p>
<p>• How these institutions persisted and became strengthened to lay the
foundations for the Industrial Revolution, thanks in part to the
virtuous circle and in part to fortunate turns of contingency.</p>
<p>• How many regimes reigning over absolutist and extractive
institutions steadfastly resisted the spread of new technologies
unleashed by the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>• How Europeans themselves stamped out the possibility of economic
growth in many parts of the world that they conquered.</p>
<p>• How the vicious circle and the iron law of oligarchy have created a
powerful tendency for extractive institutions to persist, and thus the
lands where the Industrial Revolution originally did not spread remain
relatively poor.</p>
<p>• Why the Industrial Revolution and other new technologies have not
spread and are unlikely to spread to places around the world today where
a minimum degree of centralization of the state hasn’t been
achieved.</p>
<p>Our discussion will also show that certain areas that managed to
transform institutions in a more inclusive direction, such as France or
Japan, or that prevented the establishment of extractive institutions,
such as the United States or Australia, were more receptive to the
spread of the Industrial Revolution and pulled ahead of the rest. As in
England, this was not always a smooth process, and along the way, many
challenges to inclusive institutions were overcome, sometimes because of
the dynamics of the virtuous circle, sometimes thanks to the contingent
path of history.</p>
<p>Finally, we will also discuss how the failure of nations today is
heavily influenced by their institutional histories, how much policy
advice is informed by incorrect hypotheses and is potentially
misleading, and how nations are still able to seize critical junctures
and break the mold to reform their institutions and embark upon a path
to greater prosperity.</p>
