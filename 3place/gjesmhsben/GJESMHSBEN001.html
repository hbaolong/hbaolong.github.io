<h4 id="praise-for-why-nations-fail">PRAISE FOR Why Nations Fail</h4>
<p>“Acemoglu and Robinson have made an important contribution to the
debate as to why similar-looking nations differ so greatly in their
economic and political development. Through a broad multiplicity of
historical examples, they show how institutional developments, sometimes
based on very accidental circumstances, have had enormous consequences.
The openness of a society, its willingness to permit creative
destruction, and the rule of law appear to be decisive for economic
development.”</p>
<p>—Kenneth J. Arrow, Nobel laureate in economics, 1972</p>
<p>“The authors convincingly show that countries escape poverty only
when they have appropriate economic institutions, especially private
property and competition. More originally, they argue countries are more
likely to develop the right institutions when they have an open
pluralistic political system with competition for political office, a
widespread electorate, and openness to new political leaders. This
intimate connection between political and economic institutions is the
heart of their major contribution, and has resulted in a study of great
vitality on one of the crucial questions in economics and political
economy.”</p>
<p>—Gary S. Becker, Nobel laureate in economics, 1992</p>
<p>“This important and insightful book, packed with historical examples,
makes the case that inclusive political institutions in support of
inclusive economic institutions is key to sustained prosperity. The book
reviews how some good regimes got launched and then had a virtuous
spiral, while bad regimes remain in a vicious spiral. This is important
analysis not to be missed.”</p>
<p>—Peter Diamond, Nobel laureate in economics, 2010</p>
<p>“For those who think that a nation’s economic fate is determined by
geography or culture, Daron Acemoglu and Jim Robinson have bad news.
It’s manmade institutions, not the lay of the land or the faith of our
forefathers, that determine whether a country is rich or poor.
Synthesizing brilliantly the work of theorists from Adam Smith to
Douglass North with more recent empirical research by economic
historians, Acemoglu and Robinson have produced a compelling and highly
readable book.”</p>
<p>—Niall Ferguson, author of The Ascent of Money</p>
<p>“Acemoglu and Robinson—two of the world’s leading experts on
development—reveal why it is not geography, disease, or culture that
explain why some nations are rich and some poor, but rather a matter of
institutions and politics. This highly accessible book provides welcome
insight to specialists and general readers alike.”</p>
<p>—Francis Fukuyama, author of The End of History and the Last Man and
The Origins of Political Order</p>
<p>“A brilliant and uplifting book—yet also a deeply disturbing wake-up
call. Acemoglu and Robinson lay out a convincing theory of almost
everything to do with economic development. Countries rise when they put
in place the right pro-growth political institutions and they fail—often
spectacularly—when those institutions ossify or fail to adapt. Powerful
people always and everywhere seek to grab complete control over
government, undermining broader social progress for their own greed.
Keep those people in check with effective democracy or watch your nation
fail.”</p>
<p>—Simon Johnson, coauthor of 13 Bankers and professor at MIT Sloan</p>
<p>“Two of the world’s best and most erudite economists turn to the
hardest issue of all: why are some nations poor and others rich? Written
with a deep knowledge of economics and political history, this is
perhaps the most powerful statement made to date that ‘institutions
matter.’ A provocative, instructive, yet thoroughly enthralling
book.”</p>
<p>—Joel Mokyr, Robert H. Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences and
Professor of Economics and History, Northwestern University</p>
<p>“In this delightfully readable romp through four hundred years of
history, two of the giants of contemporary social science bring us an
inspiring and important message: it is freedom that makes the world
rich. Let tyrants everywhere tremble!”</p>
<p>—Ian Morris, Stanford University, author of Why the West Rules—for
Now</p>
<p>“Imagine sitting around a table listening to Jared Diamond, Joseph
Schumpeter, and James Madison reflect on more than two thousand years of
political and economic history. Imagine that they weave their ideas into
a coherent theoretical framework based on limiting extraction, promoting
creative destruction, and creating strong political institutions that
share power, and you begin to see the contribution of this brilliant and
engagingly written book.”</p>
<p>—Scott E. Page, University of Michigan and Santa Fe Institute</p>
<p>“In this stunningly wide-ranging book, Acemoglu and Robinson ask a
simple but vital question, why do some nations become rich and others
remain poor? Their answer is also simple—because some polities develop
more inclusive political institutions. What is remarkable about the book
is the crispness and clarity of the writing, the elegance of the
argument, and the remarkable richness of historical detail. This book is
a must-read at a moment when governments across the Western world must
come up with the political will to deal with a debt crisis of unusual
proportions.”</p>
<p>—Steven Pincus, Bradford Durfee Professor of History and
International and Area Studies, Yale University</p>
<p>“It’s the politics, stupid! That is Acemoglu and Robinson’s simple
yet compelling explanation for why so many countries fail to develop.
From the absolutism of the Stuarts to the antebellum South, from Sierra
Leone to Colombia, this magisterial work shows how powerful elites rig
the rules to benefit themselves at the expense of the many. Charting a
careful course between the pessimists and optimists, the authors
demonstrate history and geography need not be destiny. But they also
document how sensible economic ideas and policies often achieve little
in the absence of fundamental political change.”</p>
<p>—Dani Rodrik, Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University</p>
<p>“This is not only a fascinating and interesting book: it is a really
important one. The highly original research that Professors Acemoglu and
Robinson have done, and continue to do, on how economic forces,
politics, and policy choices evolve together and constrain each other,
and how institutions affect that evolution, is essential to
understanding the successes and failures of societies and nations. And
here, in this book, these insights come in a highly accessible, indeed
riveting form. Those who pick this book up and start reading will have
trouble putting it down.”</p>
<p>—Michael Spence, Nobel laureate in economics, 2001</p>
<p>“This fascinating and readable book centers on the complex joint
evolution of political and economic institutions, in good directions and
bad. It strikes a delicate balance between the logic of political and
economic behavior and the shifts in direction created by contingent
historical events, large and small, at ‘critical junctures.’ Acemoglu
and Robinson provide an enormous range of historical examples to show
how such shifts can tilt toward favorable institutions, progressive
innovation, and economic success or toward repressive institutions and
eventual decay or stagnation. Somehow they can generate both excitement
and reflection.”</p>
<p>—Robert Solow, Nobel laureate in economics, 1987</p>
