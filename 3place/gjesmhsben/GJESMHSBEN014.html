<h4 id="the-vicious-circle">12. THE VICIOUS CIRCLE</h4>
<p>YOU CAN’T TAKE THE TRAIN TO BO ANYMORE</p>
<p>ALL OF THE WEST AFRICAN nation of Sierra Leone became a British
colony in 1896. The capital city, Freetown, had originally been founded
in the late eighteenth century as a home for repatriated and freed
slaves. But when Freetown became a British colony, the interior of
Sierra Leone was still made up of many small African kingdoms.
Gradually, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the British
extended their rule into the interior through a long series of treaties
with African rulers. On August 31, 1896, the British government declared
the colony a protectorate on the basis of these treaties. The British
identified important rulers and gave them a new title, paramount chief.
In eastern Sierra Leone, for example, in the modern diamond-mining
district of Kono, they encountered Suluku, a powerful warrior king. King
Suluku was made Paramount Chief Suluku, and the chieftaincy of Sandor
was created as an administrative unit in the protectorate.</p>
<p>Though kings such as Suluku had signed treaties with a British
administrator, they had not understood that these treaties would be
interpreted as carte blanche to set up a colony. When the British tried
to levy a hut tax—a tax of five shillings to be raised from every
house—in January 1898, the chiefs rose up in a civil war that became
known as the Hut Tax Rebellion. It started in the north, but was
strongest and lasted longer in the south, particularly in Mendeland,
dominated by the Mende ethnic group. The Hut Tax Rebellion was soon
defeated, but it warned the British about the challenges of controlling
the Sierra Leonean hinterland. The British had already started to build
a railway from Freetown into the interior. Work began in March 1896, and
the line reached Songo Town in December 1898, in the midst of the Hut
Tax Rebellion. British parliamentary papers from 1904 recorded that:</p>
<p>In the case of the Sierra Leone Railways the Native Insurrection that
broke out in February 1898 had the effect of completely stopping the
works and disorganizing the staff for some time. The rebels descended
upon the railway, with the result that the entire staff had to be
withdrawn to Freetown … Rotifunk, now situated upon the railways at 55
miles from Freetown, was at that time completely in the hands of the
rebels.</p>
<p>In fact, Rotifunk was not on the planned railway line in 1894. The
route was changed after the start of the rebellion, so that instead of
going to the northeast, it went south, via Rotifunk and on to Bo, into
Mendeland. The British wanted quick access to Mendeland, the heart of
the rebellion, and to other potentially disruptive parts of the
hinterland if other rebellions were to flare up.</p>
<p>When Sierra Leone became independent in 1961, the British handed
power to Sir Milton Margai and his Sierra Leone People’s Party (SLPP),
which attracted support primarily in the south, particularly Mendeland,
and the east. Sir Milton was followed as prime minister by his brother,
Sir Albert Margai, in 1964. In 1967 the SLPP narrowly lost a hotly
contested election to the opposition, the All People’s Congress Party
(APC), led by Siaka Stevens. Stevens was a Limba, from the north, and
the APC got most of their support from northern ethnic groups, the
Limba, the Temne, and the Loko.</p>
<p>Though the railway to the south was initially designed by the British
to rule Sierra Leone, by 1967 its role was economic, transporting most
of the country’s exports: coffee, cocoa, and diamonds. The farmers who
grew coffee and cocoa were Mende, and the railway was Mendeland’s window
to the world. Mendeland had voted hugely for Albert Margai in the 1967
election. Stevens was much more interested in holding on to power than
promoting Mendeland’s exports. His reasoning was simple: whatever was
good for the Mende was good for the SLPP, and bad for Stevens. So he
pulled up the railway line to Mendeland. He then went ahead and sold off
the track and rolling stock to make the change as irreversible as
possible. Now, as you drive out of Freetown to the east, you pass the
dilapidated railway stations of Hastings and Waterloo. There are no more
trains to Bo. Of course, Stevens’s drastic action fatally damaged some
of the most vibrant sectors of Sierra Leone’s economy. But like many of
Africa’s postindependence leaders, when the choice was between
consolidating power and encouraging economic growth, Stevens chose
consolidating his power, and he never looked back. Today you can’t take
the train to Bo anymore, because like Tsar Nicholas I, who feared that
the railways would bring revolution to Russia, Stevens believed the
railways would strengthen his opponents. Like so many other rulers in
control of extractive institutions, he was afraid of challenges to his
political power and was willing to sacrifice economic growth to thwart
those challenges.</p>
<p>Stevens’s strategy at first glance contrasts with that of the
British. But in fact, there was a significant amount of continuity
between British rule and Stevens’s regime that illustrates the logic of
vicious circles. Stevens ruled Sierra Leone by extracting resources from
its people using similar methods. He was still in power in 1985 not
because he had been popularly reelected, but because after 1967 he set
up a violent dictatorship, killing and harassing his political
opponents, particularly the members of the SLPP. He made himself
president in 1971, and after 1978, Sierra Leone had only one political
party, Stevens’s APC. Stevens thus successfully consolidated his power,
even if the cost was impoverishing much of the hinterland.</p>
<p>During the colonial period, the British used a system of indirect
rule to govern Sierra Leone, as they did with most of their African
colonies. At the base of this system were the paramount chiefs, who
collected taxes, distributed justice, and kept order. The British dealt
with the cocoa and coffee farmers not by isolating them, but by forcing
them to sell all their produce to a marketing board developed by the
colonial office purportedly to help the farmers. Prices for agricultural
commodities fluctuated wildly over time. Cocoa prices might be high one
year but low the next. The incomes of farmers fluctuated in tandem. The
justification for marketing boards was that they, not the farmers, would
absorb the price fluctuations. When world prices were high, the board
would pay the farmers in Sierra Leone less than the world price, but
when world prices were low, they would do the opposite. It seemed a good
idea in principle. The reality was very different, however. The Sierra
Leone Produce Marketing Board was set up in 1949. Of course the board
needed a source of revenues to function. The natural way to attain these
was by paying farmers just a little less than they should have received
either in good or bad years. These funds could then be used for overhead
expenditures and administration. Soon the little less became a lot less.
The colonial state was using the marketing board as a way of heavily
taxing farmers.</p>
<p>Many expected the worst practices of colonial rule in sub-Saharan
Africa to stop after independence, and the use of marketing boards to
excessively tax farmers to come to an end. But neither happened. In
fact, the extraction of farmers using marketing boards got much worse.
By the mid-1960s, the farmers of palm kernels were getting 56 percent of
the world price from the marketing board; cocoa farmers, 48 percent; and
coffee farmers, 49 percent. By the time Stevens left office in 1985,
resigning to allow his handpicked successor, Joseph Momoh, to become
president, these numbers were 37, 19, and 27 percent, respectively. As
pitiful as this might sound, it was better than what the farmers were
getting during Stevens’s reign, which had often been as low as 10
percent—that is, 90 percent of the income of the farmers was extracted
by Stevens’s government, and not to provide public services, such as
roads or education, but to enrich himself and his cronies and to buy
political support.</p>
<p>As part of their indirect rule, the British had also stipulated that
the office of the paramount chief would be held for life. To be eligible
to be a chief, one had to be a member of a recognized “ruling house.”
The identity of the ruling houses in a chieftaincy developed over time,
but it was essentially based on the lineage of the kings in a particular
area and of the elite families who signed treaties with the British in
the late nineteenth century. Chiefs were elected, but not
democratically. A body called the Tribal Authority, whose members were
lesser village chiefs or were appointed by paramount chiefs, village
chiefs, or the British authorities, decided who would become the
paramount chief. One might have imagined that this colonial institution
would also have been abolished or at least reformed after independence.
But just like the marketing board, it was not, and continued unchanged.
Today paramount chiefs are still in charge of collecting taxes. It is no
longer a hut tax, but its close descendant, a poll tax. In 2005 the
Tribal Authority in Sandor elected a new paramount chief. Only
candidates from the Fasuluku ruling house, which is the only ruling
house, could stand. The victor was Sheku Fasuluku, King Suluku’s
great-great-grandson.</p>
<p>The behavior of the marketing boards and the traditional systems of
land ownership go a long way to explain why agricultural productivity is
so low in Sierra Leone and much of sub-Saharan Africa. The political
scientist Robert Bates set out in the 1980s to understand why
agriculture was so unproductive in Africa even though according to
textbook economics this ought to have been the most dynamic economic
sector. He realized that this had nothing to do with geography or the
sorts of factors discussed in chapter 2 that have been claimed to make
agricultural productivity intrinsically low. Rather, it was simply
because the pricing policies of the marketing boards removed any
incentives for the farmers to invest, use fertilizers, or preserve the
soil.</p>
<p>The reason that the policies of the marketing boards were so
unfavorable to rural interests was that these interests had no political
power. These pricing policies interacted with other fundamental factors
making tenure insecure, further undermining investment incentives. In
Sierra Leone, paramount chiefs not only provide law and order and
judicial services, and raise taxes, but they are also the “custodians of
the land.” Though families, clans, and dynasties have user rights and
traditional rights to land; at the end of the day chiefs have the last
say on who farms where. Your property rights to land are only secure if
you are connected to the chief, perhaps from the same ruling family.
Land cannot be bought or sold or used as collateral for a loan, and if
you are born outside a chieftaincy, you cannot plant any perennial crop
such as coffee, cocoa, or palm for fear that this will allow you to
establish “de facto” property rights.</p>
<p>The contrast between the extractive institutions developed by the
British in Sierra Leone and the inclusive institutions that developed in
other colonies, such as Australia, is illustrated by the way mineral
resources were managed. Diamonds were discovered in Kono in eastern
Sierra Leone in January 1930. The diamonds were alluvial, that is, not
in deep mines. So the primary method of mining them was by panning in
rivers. Some social scientists call these “democratic diamonds,” because
they allow many people to become involved in mining, creating a
potentially inclusive opportunity. Not so in Sierra Leone. Happily
ignoring the intrinsically democratic nature of panning for diamonds,
the British government set up a monopoly for the entire protectorate,
called it the Sierra Leone Selection Trust, and granted it to De Beers,
the giant South African diamond mining company. In 1936 De Beers was
also given the right to create the Diamond Protection Force, a private
army that would become larger than that of the colonial government in
Sierra Leone. Even so, the widespread availability of the alluvial
diamonds made the situation difficult to police. By the 1950s, the
Diamond Protection Force was overwhelmed by thousands of illegal diamond
miners, a massive source of conflict and chaos. In 1955 the British
government opened up some of the diamond fields to licensed diggers
outside the Sierra Leone Selection Trust, though the company still kept
the richest areas in Yengema and Koidu and Tongo Fields. Things only got
worse after independence. In 1970 Siaka Stevens effectively nationalized
the Sierra Leone Selection Trust, creating the National Diamond Mining
Company (Sierra Leone) Limited, in which the government, effectively
meaning Stevens, had a 51 percent stake. This was the opening phase of
Stevens’s plan to take over diamond mining in the country.</p>
<p>In nineteenth-century Australia it was gold, discovered in 1851 in
New South Wales and the newly created state of Victoria, not diamonds,
that attracted everyone’s attention. Like diamonds in Sierra Leone, the
gold was alluvial, and a decision had to be made about how to exploit
it. Some, such as James Macarthur, son of John Macarthur, the prominent
leader of the Squatters we discussed earlier (this page–this page),
proposed that fences be placed around the mining areas and the monopoly
rights auctioned off. They wanted an Australian version of the Sierra
Leone Selection Trust. Yet many in Australia wanted free access to the
gold mining areas. The inclusive model won, and instead of setting up a
monopoly, Australian authorities allowed anyone who paid an annual
mining license fee to search and dig for gold. Soon the diggers, as
these adventurers came to be known, were a powerful force in Australian
politics, particularly in Victoria. They played an important role in
pushing forward the agenda of universal suffrage and the secret
ballot.</p>
<p>We have already seen two pernicious effects of European expansion and
colonial rule in Africa: the introduction of the transatlantic slave
trade, which encouraged the development of African political and
economic institutions in an extractive direction, and the use of
colonial legislation and institutions to eliminate the development of
African commercial agriculture that might have competed with Europeans.
Slavery was certainly a force in Sierra Leone. At the time of
colonization there was no strong centralized state in the interior, just
many small, mutually antagonistic kingdoms continually raiding one
another and capturing one another’s men and women. Slavery was endemic,
with possibly 50 percent of the population working as slaves. The
disease environment meant that large-scale white settlement was not
possible in Sierra Leone, as it was in South Africa. Hence there were no
whites competing with the Africans. Moreover, the lack of a mining
economy on the scale of Johannesburg meant that, in addition to the lack
of demand for African labor from white farms, there was no incentive to
create the extractive labor market institutions so characteristic of
Apartheid South Africa.</p>
<p>But other mechanisms were also in play. Sierra Leone’s cocoa and
coffee farmers did not compete with whites, though their incomes were
still expropriated via a government monopoly, the marketing board.
Sierra Leone also suffered from indirect rule. In many parts of Africa
where the British authorities wished to use indirect rule, they found
peoples who did not have a system of centralized authority who could be
taken over. For example, in eastern Nigeria the Igbo peoples had no
chiefs when the British encountered them in the nineteenth century. The
British then created chiefs, the warrant chiefs. In Sierra Leone, the
British would base indirect rule on existing indigenous institutions and
systems of authority.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, regardless of the historical basis for the individuals
recognized as paramount chiefs in 1896, indirect rule, and the powers
that it invested in paramount chiefs, completely changed the existing
politics of Sierra Leone. For one, it introduced a system of social
stratification—the ruling houses—where none had existed previously. A
hereditary aristocracy replaced a situation that had been much more
fluid and where chiefs had required popular support. Instead what
emerged was a rigid system with chiefs holding office for life, beholden
to their patrons in Freetown or Britain, and far less accountable to the
people they ruled. The British were happy to subvert the institutions in
other ways, too, for example, by replacing legitimate chiefs with people
who were more cooperative. Indeed, the Margai family, which supplied the
first two prime ministers of independent Sierra Leone, came to power in
the Lower Banta chieftaincy by siding with the British in the Hut Tax
Rebellion against the reigning chief, Nyama. Nyama was deposed, and the
Margais became chiefs and held the position until 2010.</p>
<p>What is remarkable is the extent of continuity between colonial and
independent Sierra Leone. The British created the marketing boards and
used them to tax farmers. Postcolonial governments did the same
extracting at even higher rates. The British created the system of
indirect rule through paramount chiefs. Governments that followed
independence didn’t reject this colonial institution; rather, they used
it to govern the countryside as well. The British set up a diamond
monopoly and tried to keep out African miners. Postindependence
governments did the same. It is true that the British thought that
building railways was a good way to rule Mendeland, while Siaka Stevens
thought the opposite. The British could trust their army and knew it
could be sent to Mendeland if a rebellion arose. Stevens, on the other
hand, could not do so. As in many other African nations, a strong army
would have become a threat to Stevens’s rule. It was for this reason
that he emasculated the army, cutting it down and privatizing violence
through specially created paramilitary units loyal only to him, and in
the process, he accelerated the decline of the little state authority
that existed in Sierra Leone. Instead of the army, first came the
Internal Security Unit, the ISU, which Sierra Leone’s long-suffering
people knew as “I Shoot U.” Then came the Special Security Division, the
SSD, which the people knew as “Siaka Stevens’s Dogs.” In the end, the
absence of an army supporting the regime would also be its undoing. It
was a group of only thirty soldiers, led by Captain Valentine Strasser,
that pitched the APC regime from power on April 29, 1992.</p>
<p>Sierra Leone’s development, or lack thereof, could be best understood
as the outcome of the vicious circle. British colonial authorities built
extractive institutions in the first place, and the postindependence
African politicians were only too happy to take up the baton for
themselves. The pattern was eerily similar all over sub-Saharan Africa.
There were similar hopes for postindependence Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, and
many other African countries. Yet in all these cases, extractive
institutions were re-created in a pattern predicted by the vicious
circle—only they became more vicious as time went by. In all these
countries, for example, the British creation of marketing boards and
indirect rule were sustained.</p>
<p>There are natural reasons for this vicious circle. Extractive
political institutions lead to extractive economic institutions, which
enrich a few at the expense of many. Those who benefit from extractive
institutions thus have the resources to build their (private) armies and
mercenaries, to buy their judges, and to rig their elections in order to
remain in power. They also have every interest in defending the system.
Therefore, extractive economic institutions create the platform for
extractive political institutions to persist. Power is valuable in
regimes with extractive political institutions, because power is
unchecked and brings economic riches.</p>
<p>Extractive political institutions also provide no checks against
abuses of power. Whether power corrupts is debatable, but Lord Acton was
certainly right when he argued that absolute power corrupts absolutely.
We saw in the previous chapter that even when Franklin Roosevelt wished
to use his presidential powers in a way that he thought would be
beneficial for the society, unencumbered by constraints imposed by the
Supreme Court, the inclusive U.S. political institutions prevented him
from setting aside the constraints on his power. Under extractive
political institutions, there is little check against the exercise of
power, however distorted and sociopathic it may become. In 1980 Sam
Bangura, then the governor of the central bank in Sierra Leone,
criticized Siaka Stevens’s policies for being profligate. He was soon
murdered and thrown from the top floor of the central bank building onto
the aptly named Siaka Stevens Street. Extractive political institutions
thus also tend to create a vicious circle because they provide no line
of defense against those who want to further usurp and misuse the powers
of the state.</p>
<p>Yet another mechanism for the vicious circle is that extractive
institutions, by creating unconstrained power and great income
inequality, increase the potential stakes of the political game. Because
whoever controls the state becomes the beneficiary of this excessive
power and the wealth that it generates, extractive institutions create
incentives for infighting in order to control power and its benefits, a
dynamic that we saw played out in Maya city-states and in Ancient Rome.
In this light, it is no surprise that the extractive institutions that
many African countries inherited from the colonial powers sowed the
seeds of power struggles and civil wars. These struggles would be very
different conflicts from the English Civil War and the Glorious
Revolution. They would not be fought to change political institutions,
introduce constraints on the exercise of power, or create pluralism, but
to capture power and enrich one group at the expense of the rest. In
Angola, Burundi, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo,
Ethiopia, Liberia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Republic of Congo Brazzaville,
Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda, and of course in Sierra Leone, as we
will see in more detail in the next chapter, these conflicts would turn
into bloody civil wars and would create economic ruin and unparalleled
human suffering—as well as cause state failure.</p>
<p>FROM ENCOMIENDA TO LAND GRAB</p>
<p>On January 14, 1993, Ramiro De León Carpio was sworn in as the
president of Guatemala. He named Richard Aitkenhead Castillo as his
minister of finance, and Ricardo Castillo Sinibaldi as his minister of
development. These three men all had something in common: all were
direct descendants of Spanish conquistadors who had come to Guatemala in
the early sixteenth century. De León’s illustrious ancestor was Juan De
León Cardona, while the Castillos were related to Bernal Díaz del
Castillo, a man who wrote one of the most famous eyewitness accounts of
the conquest of Mexico. In reward for his service to Hernán Cortés, Díaz
del Castillo was appointed governor of Santiago de los Caballeros, which
is today the city of Antigua in Guatemala. Both Castillo and De León
founded dynasties along with other conquistadors, such as Pedro de
Alvarado. The Guatemalan sociologist Marta Casaús Arzú identified a core
group of twenty-two families in Guatemala that had ties through marriage
to another twenty-six families just outside the core. Her genealogical
and political study suggested that these families have controlled
economic and political power in Guatemala since 1531. An even broader
definition of which families were part of this elite suggested that they
accounted for just over 1 percent of the population in the 1990s.</p>
<p>In Sierra Leone and in much of sub-Saharan Africa, the vicious circle
took the form of the extractive institutions set up by colonial powers
being taken over by postindependence leaders. In Guatemala, as in much
of Central America, we see a simpler, more naked form of the vicious
circle: those who have economic and political power structure
institutions to ensure the continuity of their power, and succeed in
doing so. This type of vicious circle leads to the persistence of
extractive institutions and the persistence of the same elites in power
together with the persistence of underdevelopment.</p>
<p>At the time of the conquest, Guatemala was densely settled, probably
with a population of around two million Mayas. Disease and exploitation
took a heavy toll as everywhere else in the Americas. It was not until
the 1920s that its total population returned to this level. As elsewhere
in the Spanish Empire, the indigenous people were allocated to
conquistadors in grants of encomienda. As we saw in the context of the
colonization of Mexico and Peru, the encomienda was a system of forced
labor, which subsequently gave way to other similar coercive
institutions, particularly to the repartimiento, also called the
mandamiento in Guatemala. The elite, made up of the descendants of the
conquistadors and some indigenous elements, not only benefited from the
various forced labor systems but also controlled and monopolized trade
through a merchant guild called the Consulado de Comercio. Most of the
population in Guatemala was high in the mountains and far from the
coast. The high transportation costs reduced the extent of the export
economy, and initially land was not very valuable. Much of it was still
in the hands of indigenous peoples, who had large communal landholdings
called ejidos. The remainder was largely unoccupied and notionally owned
by the government. There was more money in controlling and taxing trade,
such as it was, than in controlling the land.</p>
<p>Just as in Mexico, the Guatemalan elite viewed the Cadiz Constitution
(this page–this page) with hostility, which encouraged them to declare
independence just as the Mexican elites did. Following a brief union
with Mexico and the Central American Federation, the colonial elite
ruled Guatemala under the dictatorship of Rafael Carrera from 1839 to
1871. During this period the descendants of the conquistadors and the
indigenous elite maintained the extractive economic institutions of the
colonial era largely unchanged. Even the organization of the Consulado
did not alter with independence. Though this was a royal institution, it
happily continued under a republican government.</p>
<p>Independence then was simply a coup by the preexisting local elite,
just as in Mexico; they carried on as usual with the extractive economic
institutions from which they had benefited so much. Ironically enough,
during this period the Consulado remained in charge of the economic
development of the country. But as had been the case pre-independence,
the Consulado had its own interests at heart, not those of the country.
Part of its responsibility was for the development of infrastructure,
such as ports and roads, but as in Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Sierra
Leone, this often threatened creative destruction and could have
destabilized the system. Therefore, the development of infrastructure,
rather than being implemented, was often resisted. For example, the
development of a port on the Suchitepéquez coast, bordering the Pacific
Ocean, was one of the proposed projects. At the time the only proper
ports were on the Caribbean coast, and these were controlled by the
Consulado. The Consulado did nothing on the Pacific side because a port
in that region would have provided a much easier outlet for goods from
the highland towns of Mazatenango and Quezaltenango, and access to a
different market for these goods would have undermined the Consulado’s
monopoly on foreign trade. The same logic applied to roads, where,
again, the Consulado had the responsibility for the entire country.
Predictably it also refused to build roads that would have strengthened
competing groups or would have potentially undone its monopoly. Pressure
to do so again came from western Guatemala and Quezaltenango, in the Los
Altos region. But if the road between Los Altos and the Suchitepéquez
coast had been improved, this could have created a merchant class, which
would have been a competitor to the Consulado merchants in the capital.
The road did not get improved.</p>
<p>As a result of this elite dominance, Guatemala was caught in a time
warp in the middle of the nineteenth century, as the rest of the world
was changing rapidly. But these changes would ultimately affect
Guatemala. Transportation costs were falling due to technological
innovations such as the steam train, the railways, and new, much faster
types of ships. Moreover, the rising incomes of people in Western Europe
and North America were creating a mass demand for many products that a
country such as Guatemala could potentially produce.</p>
<p>Early in the century, some indigo and then cochineal, both natural
dyes, had been produced for export, but the more profitable opportunity
would become coffee production. Guatemala had a lot of land suitable for
coffee, and cultivation began to spread—without any assistance from the
Consulado. As the world price of coffee rose and international trade
expanded, there were huge profits to be made, and the Guatemalan elite
became interested in coffee. In 1871 the long-lasting regime of the
dictator Carrera was finally overthrown by a group of people calling
themselves Liberals, after the worldwide movement of that name. What
liberalism means has changed over time. But in the nineteenth century in
the United States and Europe, it was similar to what is today called
libertarianism, and it stood for freedom of individuals, limited
government, and free trade. Things worked a little differently in
Guatemala. Led initially by Miguel García Granados, and after 1873 by
Justo Rufino Barrios, the Guatemalan Liberals were, for the most part,
not new men with liberal ideals. By and large, the same families
remained in charge. They maintained extractive political institutions
and implemented a huge reorganization of the economy to exploit coffee.
They did abolish the Consulado in 1871, but economic circumstances had
changed. The focus of extractive economic institutions would now be the
production and export of coffee.</p>
<p>Coffee production needed land and labor. To create land for coffee
farms, the Liberals pushed through land privatization, in fact really a
land grab in which they would be able to capture land previously held
communally or by the government. Though their attempt was bitterly
contested, given the highly extractive political institutions and the
concentration of political power in Guatemala, the elite were ultimately
victorious. Between 1871 and 1883 nearly one million acres of land,
mostly indigenous communal land and frontier lands, passed into the
hands of the elite, and it was only then that coffee developed rapidly.
The aim was the formation of large estates. The privatized lands were
auctioned off typically to members of the traditional elite or those
connected with them. The coercive power of the Liberal state was then
used to help large landowners gain access to labor by adapting and
intensifying various systems of forced labor. In November 1876,
President Barrios wrote to all the governors of Guatemala noting
that</p>
<p>because the country has extensive areas of land that it needs to
exploit by cultivation using the multitude of workers who today remain
outside the movement of development of the nation’s productive elements,
you are to give all help to export agriculture:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>From the Indian towns of your jurisdiction provide to the owners of
fincas [farms] of that department who ask for labor the number of
workers they need, be it fifty or one hundred.</li>
</ol>
<p>The repartimiento, the forced labor draft, had never been abolished
after independence, but now it was increased in scope and duration. It
was institutionalized in 1877 by Decree 177, which specified that
employers could request and receive from the government up to sixty
workers for fifteen days of work if the property was in the same
department, and for thirty days if it was outside it. The request could
be renewed if the employer so desired. These workers could be forcibly
recruited unless they could demonstrate from their personal workbook
that such service had recently been performed satisfactorily. All rural
workers were also forced to carry a workbook, called a libreta, which
included details of whom they were working for and a record of any
debts. Many rural workers were indebted to their employers, and an
indebted worker could not leave his current employer without permission.
Decree 177 further stipulated that the only way to avoid being drafted
into the repartimiento was to show you were currently in debt to an
employer. Workers were trapped. In addition to these laws, numerous
vagrancy laws were passed so that anyone who could not prove he had a
job would be immediately recruited for the repartimiento or other types
of forced labor on the roads, or would be forced to accept employment on
a farm. As in nineteenth- and twentieth-century South Africa, land
policies after 1871 were also designed to undermine the subsistence
economy of the indigenous peoples, to force them to work for low wages.
The repartimiento lasted until the 1920s; the libreta system and the
full gamut of vagrancy laws were in effect until 1945, when Guatemala
experienced its first brief flowering of democracy.</p>
<p>Just as before 1871, the Guatemalan elite ruled via military
strongmen. They continued to do so after the coffee boom took off. Jorge
Ubico, president between 1931 and 1944, ruled longest. Ubico won the
presidential election in 1931 unopposed, since nobody was foolish enough
to run against him. Like the Consulado, he didn’t approve of doing
things that would have induced creative destruction and threatened both
his political power and his and the elite’s profits. He therefore
opposed industry for the same reason that Francis I in Austria-Hungary
and Nicholas I in Russia did: industrial workers would have caused
trouble. In a legislation unparalleled in its paranoid repressiveness,
Ubico banned the use of words such as obreros (workers), sindicatos
(labor unions), and huelgas (strikes). You could be jailed for using any
one of them. Even though Ubico was powerful, the elite pulled the
strings. Opposition to his regime mounted in 1944, headed by disaffected
university students who began to organize demonstrations. Popular
discontent increased, and on June 24, 311 people, many of them from the
elite, signed the Memorial de los 311, an open letter denouncing the
regime. Ubico resigned on July 1. Though he was followed by a democratic
regime in 1945, this was overthrown by a coup in 1954, leading to a
murderous civil war. Guatemala democratized again after only 1986.</p>
<p>The Spanish conquistadors had no compunction about setting up an
extractive political and economic system. That was why they had come all
the way to the New World. But most of the institutions they set up were
meant to be temporary. The encomienda, for example, was a temporary
grant of rights over labor. They did not have a fully worked-out plan of
how they would set up a system that would persist for another four
hundred years. In fact, the institutions they set up changed
significantly along the way, but one thing did not: the extractive
nature of the institutions, the result of the vicious circle. The form
of extraction changed, but neither the extractive nature of the
institutions nor the identity of the elite did. In Guatemala the
encomienda, the repartimiento, and the monopolization of trade gave way
to the libreta and the land grab. But the majority of the indigenous
Maya continued to work as low-wage laborers with little education, no
rights, and no public services.</p>
<p>In Guatemala, as in much of Central America, in a typical pattern of
the vicious circle, extractive political institutions supported
extractive economic institutions, which in turn provided the basis for
extractive political institutions and the continuation of the power of
the same elite.</p>
<p>FROM SLAVERY TO JIM CROW</p>
<p>In Guatemala, extractive institutions persisted from colonial to
modern times with the same elite firmly in control. Any change in
institutions resulted from adaptations to changing environments, as was
the case with the land grab by the elite motivated by the coffee boom.
The institutions in the U.S. South were similarly extractive until the
Civil War. Economics and politics were dominated by the southern elite,
plantation owners with large land and slave holdings. Slaves had neither
political nor economic rights; indeed, they had few rights of any
kind.</p>
<p>The South’s extractive economic and political institutions made it
considerably poorer than the North by the middle of the nineteenth
century. The South lacked industry and made relatively little investment
in infrastructure. In 1860 its total manufacturing output was less than
that of Pennsylvania, New York, or Massachusetts. Only 9 percent of the
southern population lived in urban areas, compared with 35 percent in
the Northeast. The density of railroads (i.e., miles of track divided by
land area) was three times higher in the North than in southern states.
The ratio of canal mileage was similar.</p>
<p>Map 18 (this page) shows the extent of slavery by plotting the
percentage of the population that were slaves across U.S. counties in
1840. It is apparent that slavery was dominant in the South with some
counties, for example, along the Mississippi River having as much as 95
percent of the population slaves. Map 19 (this page) then shows one of
the consequences of this, the proportion of the labor force working in
manufacturing in 1880. Though this was not high anywhere by
twentieth-century standards, there are marked differences between the
North and the South. In much of the Northeast, more than 10 percent of
the labor force worked in manufacturing. In contrast in much of the
South, particularly the areas with heavy concentrations of slaves, the
proportion was basically zero.</p>
<p>The South was not even innovative in the sectors in which it
specialized: from 1837 to 1859, the numbers of patents issued per year
for innovations related to corn and wheat were on average twelve and
ten, respectively; there was just one per year for the most important
crop of the South, cotton. There was no indication that
industrialization and economic growth would commence anytime soon. But
defeat in the Civil War was followed by fundamental economic and
political reform at bayonet point. Slavery was abolished, and black men
were allowed to vote.</p>
<p>These major changes should have opened the way for a radical
transformation of southern extractive institutions into inclusive ones,
and launched the South onto a path to economic prosperity. But in yet
another manifestation of the vicious circle, nothing of the sort
happened. A continuation of extractive institutions, this time of the
Jim Crow kind rather than of slavery, emerged in the South. The phrase
Jim Crow, which supposedly originated from “Jump Jim Crow,” an
early-nineteenth-century satire of black people performed by white
performers in “blackface,” came to refer to the whole gamut of
segregationist legislation that was enacted in the South after 1865.
These persisted for almost another century, until yet another major
upheaval, the civil rights movement. In the meantime, blacks continued
to be excluded from power and repressed. Plantation-type agriculture
based on low-wage, poorly educated labor persisted, and southern incomes
fell further relative to the U.S. average. The vicious circle of
extractive institutions was stronger than many had expected at the
time.</p>
<p>The reason that the economic and political trajectory of the South
never changed, even though slavery was abolished and black men were
given the right to vote, was because blacks’ political power and
economic independence were tenuous. The southern planters lost the war,
but would win the peace. They were still organized and they still owned
the land. During the war, freed slaves had been offered the promise of
forty acres and a mule when slavery was abolished, and some even got it
during the famous campaigns of General William T. Sherman. But in 1865,
President Andrew Johnson revoked Sherman’s orders, and the hoped-for
land redistribution never took place. In a debate on this issue in
Congress, Congressman George Washington Julian presciently noted, “Of
what avail would be an act of congress totally abolishing slavery … if
the old agricultural basis of aristocratic power shall remain?” This was
the beginning of the “redemption” of the old South and the persistence
of the old southern landed elite.</p>
<p>The sociologist Jonathan Wiener studied the persistence of the
planter elite in five counties of the Black Belt, prime cotton country,
of southern Alabama. Tracking families from the U.S. census and
considering those with at least 0,000 of real estate, he found that of
the 236 members of the planter elite in 1850, 101 maintained their
position in 1870. Interestingly, this rate of persistence was very
similar to that experienced in the pre–Civil War period; of the 236
wealthiest planter families of 1850, only 110 remained so a decade
later. Nevertheless, of the 25 planters with the largest landholdings in
1870, 18 (72 percent) had been in the elite families in 1860; 16 had
been in the 1850 elite group. While more than 600,000 were killed in the
Civil War, the planter elites suffered few casualties. The law, designed
by the planters and for the planters, exempted one slaveholder from
military service for every twenty slaves held. As hundreds of thousands
of men died to preserve the southern plantation economy, many big
slaveholders and their sons sat out the war on their porches and thus
were able to ensure the persistence of the plantation economy.</p>
<p>After the end of the war, the elite planters controlling the land
were able to reexert their control over the labor force. Though the
economic institution of slavery was abolished, the evidence shows a
clear line of persistence in the economic system of the South based on
plantation-type agriculture with cheap labor. This economic system was
maintained through a variety of channels, including both control of
local politics and exercise of violence. As a consequence, in the words
of the African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, the South became “simply
an armed camp for intimidating black folk.”</p>
<p>In 1865 the state legislature of Alabama passed the Black Code, an
important landmark toward the repression of black labor. Similar to
Decree 177 in Guatemala, the Black Code of Alabama consisted of a
vagrancy law and a law against the “enticement” of laborers. It was
designed to impede labor mobility and reduce competition in the labor
market, and it ensured that southern planters would still have a
reliable low-cost labor pool.</p>
<p>Following the Civil War, the period called Reconstruction lasted from
1865 until 1877. Northern politicians, with the help of the Union Army,
engineered some social changes in the South. But a systematic backlash
from the southern elite in the guise of support for the so-called
Redeemers, seeking the South’s redemption, re-created the old system. In
the 1877 presidential election, Rutherford Hayes needed southern support
in the electoral college. This college, still used today, was at the
heart of the indirect election for president created by the U.S.
Constitution. Citizens’ votes do not directly elect the president but
instead elect electors who then choose the president in the electoral
college. In exchange for their support in the electoral college, the
southerners demanded that Union soldiers be withdrawn from the South and
the region left to its own devices. Hayes agreed. With southern support,
Hayes became president and pulled out the troops. The period after 1877
then marked the real reemergence of the pre–Civil War planter elite. The
redemption of the South involved the introduction of new poll taxes and
literacy tests for voting, which systematically disenfranchised blacks,
and often also the poor white population. These attempts succeeded and
created a one-party regime under the Democratic Party, with much of the
political power vested in the hands of the planter elite.</p>
<p>The Jim Crow laws created separate, and predictably inferior,
schools. Alabama, for example, rewrote its constitution in 1901 to
achieve this. Shockingly, even today Section 256 of Alabama’s
constitution, though no longer enforced, still states:</p>
<p>Duty of legislature to establish and maintain public school system;
apportionment of public school fund; separate schools for white and
colored children.</p>
<p>The legislature shall establish, organize, and maintain a liberal
system of public schools throughout the state for the benefit of the
children thereof between the ages of seven and twenty-one years. The
public school fund shall be apportioned to the several counties in
proportion to the number of school children of school age therein, and
shall be so apportioned to the schools in the districts or townships in
the counties as to provide, as nearly as practicable, school terms of
equal duration in such school districts or townships. Separate schools
shall be provided for white and colored children, and no child of either
race shall be permitted to attend a school of the other race.</p>
<p>An amendment to strike Section 256 from the constitution was narrowly
defeated in the state legislature in 2004.</p>
<p>Disenfranchisement, the vagrancy laws such as the Black Code of
Alabama, various Jim Crow laws, and the actions of the Ku Klux Klan,
often financed and supported by the elite, turned the post–Civil War
South into an effective apartheid society, where blacks and whites lived
different lives. As in South Africa, these laws and practices were aimed
at controlling the black population and its labor.</p>
<p>Southern politicians in Washington also worked to make sure that the
extractive institutions of the South could persist. For instance, they
ensured that no federal projects or public works that would have
jeopardized southern elite control over the black workforce ever got
approved. Consequently, the South entered the twentieth century as a
largely rural society with low levels of education and backward
technology, still employing hand labor and mule power virtually
unassisted by mechanical implements. Though the proportion of people in
urban areas increased, it was far less than in the North. In 1900, for
example, 13.5 percent of the population of the South was urbanized, as
compared with 60 percent in the Northeast.</p>
<p>All in all, the extractive institutions in the southern United
States, based on the power of the landed elite, plantation agriculture,
and low-wage, low-education labor, persisted well into the twentieth
century. These institutions started to crumble only after the Second
World War and then truly after the civil rights movement destroyed the
political basis of the system. And it was only after the demise of these
institutions in the 1950s and ’60s that the South began its process of
rapid convergence to the North.</p>
<p>The U.S. South shows another, more resilient side of the vicious
circle: as in Guatemala, the southern planter elite remained in power
and structured economic and political institutions in order to ensure
the continuity of its power. But differently from Guatemala, it was
faced with significant challenges after its defeat in the Civil War,
which abolished slavery and reversed the total, constitutional exclusion
of blacks from political participation. But there is more than one way
of skinning a cat: as long as the planter elite was in control of its
huge landholdings and remained organized, it could structure a new set
of institutions, Jim Crow instead of slavery, to achieve the same
objective. The vicious circle turned out to be stronger than many,
including Abraham Lincoln, had thought. The vicious circle is based on
extractive political institutions creating extractive economic
institutions, which in turn support the extractive political
institutions, because economic wealth and power buy political power.
When forty acres and a mule was off the table, the southern planter
elite’s economic power remained untarnished. And, unsurprisingly and
unfortunately, the implications for the black population of the South,
and the South’s economic development, were the same.</p>
<p>THE IRON LAW OF OLIGARCHY</p>
<p>The Solomonic dynasty in Ethiopia lasted until it was overthrown by a
military coup in 1974. The coup was led by the Derg, a group of Marxist
army officers. The regime that the Derg pitched from power looked like
it was frozen in some earlier century, a historical anachronism. The
emperor Haile Selassie would start his day by arriving in the courtyard
at the Grand Palace, which had been built by Emperor Menelik II in the
late nineteenth century. Outside the palace would be a crowd of
dignitaries anticipating his arrival, bowing and desperately trying to
get his attention. The emperor would hold court in the Audience Hall,
sitting on the imperial throne. (Selassie was a small man; so that his
legs were not left swinging in the air, it was the job of a special
pillow bearer to accompany him wherever he went to make sure there was a
suitable pillow to put under his feet. The bearer kept a stock of
fifty-two pillows to cope with any situation.) Selassie presided over an
extreme set of extractive institutions and ran the country as his own
private property, handing out favors and patronage and ruthlessly
punishing lack of loyalty. There was no economic development to speak of
in Ethiopia under the Solomonic dynasty.</p>
<p>The Derg initially formed out of 108 representatives of different
military units from all over the country. The representative of the
Third Division in Harar province was a major named Mengistu Haile
Mariam. Though in their initial declaration of July 4, 1974, the Derg
officers declared their loyalty to the emperor, they soon started to
arrest members of the government, testing how much opposition it would
create. As they became more confident that the support for Selassie’s
regime was hollow, they moved on the emperor himself, arresting him on
September 12. Then the executions began. Many politicians at the core of
the old regime were swiftly killed. By December, the Derg had declared
that Ethiopia was a socialist state. Selassie died, probably murdered,
on August 27, 1975. In 1975 the Derg started nationalizing property,
including all urban and rural land and most kinds of private property.
The increasingly authoritarian behavior of the regime sparked opposition
around the country. Large parts of Ethiopia were put together during the
European colonial expansion in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries by the policies of Emperor Menelik II, the victor of the
battle of Adowa, which we encountered before (this page). These included
Eritrea and Tigray in the north and the Ogaden in the east. Independence
movements in response to the Derg’s ruthless regime emerged in Eritrea
and Tigray, while the Somali army invaded the Somali-speaking Ogaden.
The Derg itself started to disintegrate and split into factions. Major
Mengistu turned out to be the most ruthless and clever of them. By
mid-1977 he had eliminated his major opponents and effectively taken
charge of the regime, which was saved from collapse only by a huge
influx of weapons and troops from the Soviet Union and Cuba later in
November of that year.</p>
<p>In 1978 the regime organized a national celebration marking the
fourth anniversary of the overthrow of Haile Selassie. By this time
Mengistu was the unchallenged leader of the Derg. As his residence, the
place from where he would rule Ethiopia, he had chosen Selassie’s Grand
Palace, left unoccupied since the monarchy was abolished. At the
celebration, he sat on a gilded armchair, just like the emperors of old,
watching the parade. Official functions were now held once again at the
Grand Palace, with Mengistu sitting on Haile Selassie’s old throne.
Mengistu started to compare himself to Emperor Tewodros, who had
refounded the Solomonic Dynasty in the mid-nineteenth century after a
period of decline.</p>
<p>One of his ministers, Dawit Wolde Giorgis, recalled in his
memoir:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Revolution all of us had utterly rejected
anything to do with the past. We would no longer drive cars, or wear
suits; neckties were considered criminal. Anything that made you look
well-off or bourgeois, anything that smacked of affluence or
sophistication, was scorned as part of the old order. Then, around 1978,
all that began to change. Gradually materialism became accepted, then
required. Designer clothes from the best European tailors were the
uniform of all senior government officials and members of the Military
Council. We had the best of everything: the best homes, the best cars,
the best whiskey, champagne, food. It was a complete reversal of the
ideals of the Revolution.</p>
<p>Giorgis also vividly recorded how Mengistu changed once he became
sole ruler:</p>
<p>The real Mengistu emerged: vengeful, cruel and authoritarian … Many
of us who used to talk to him with hands in our pockets, as if he were
one of us, found ourselves standing stiffly to attention, cautiously
respectful in his presence. In addressing him we had always used the
familiar form of “you,” ante; now we found ourselves switching to the
more formal “you,” ersiwo. He moved into a bigger, more lavish office in
the Palace of Menelik … He began using the Emperor’s cars … We were
supposed to have a revolution of equality; now he had become the new
Emperor.</p>
<p>The pattern of vicious circle depicted by the transition between
Haile Selassie and Mengistu, or between the British colonial governors
of Sierra Leone and Siaka Stevens, is so extreme and at some level so
strange that it deserves a special name. As we already mentioned in
chapter 4, the German sociologist Robert Michels called it the iron law
of oligarchy. The internal logic of oligarchies, and in fact of all
hierarchical organizations, is that, argued Michels, they will reproduce
themselves not only when the same group is in power, but even when an
entirely new group takes control. What Michels did not anticipate
perhaps was an echo of Karl Marx’s remark that history repeats
itself—the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.</p>
<p>It is not only that many of the postindependence leaders of Africa
moved into the same residences, made use of the same patronage networks,
and employed the same ways of manipulating markets and extracting
resources as had the colonial regimes and the emperors they replaced;
but they also made things worse. It was indeed a farce that the
staunchly anticolonial Stevens would be concerned with controlling the
same people, the Mende, whom the British had sought to control; that he
would rely on the same chiefs whom the British had empowered and then
used to control the hinterland; that he would run the economy in the
same way, expropriating the farmers with the same marketing boards and
controlling the diamonds under a similar monopoly. It was indeed a
farce, a very sad farce indeed, that Laurent Kabila, who mobilized an
army against Mobutu’s dictatorship with the promise of freeing the
people and ending the stifling and impoverishing corruption and
repression of Mobutu’s Zaire, would then set up a regime just as corrupt
and perhaps even more disastrous. It was certainly farcical that he
tried to start a Mobutuesque personality cult aided and abetted by
Dominique Sakombi Inongo, previously Mobutu’s minister of information,
and that Mobutu’s regime was itself fashioned on patterns of
exploitation of the masses that had started more than a century
previously with King Leopold’s Congo Free State. It was indeed a farce
that the Marxist officer Mengistu would start living in a palace,
viewing himself as an emperor, and enriching himself and his entourage
just like Haile Selassie and other emperors before him had done.</p>
<p>It was all a farce, but also more tragic than the original tragedy,
and not only for the hopes that were dashed. Stevens and Kabila, like
many other rulers in Africa, would start murdering their opponents and
then innocent citizens. Mengistu and the Derg’s policies would bring
recurring famine to Ethiopia’s fertile lands. History was repeating
itself, but in a very distorted form. It was a famine in Wollo province
in 1973 to which Haile Selassie was apparently indifferent that did so
much finally to solidify opposition to his regime. Selassie had at least
been only indifferent. Mengistu instead saw famine as a political tool
to undermine the strength of his opponents. History was not only
farcical and tragic, but also cruel to the citizens of Ethiopia and much
of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The essence of the iron law of oligarchy, this particular facet of
the vicious circle, is that new leaders overthrowing old ones with
promises of radical change bring nothing but more of the same. At some
level, the iron law of oligarchy is harder to understand than other
forms of the vicious circle. There is a clear logic to the persistence
of the extractive institutions in the U.S. South and in Guatemala. The
same groups continued to dominate the economy and the politics for
centuries. Even when challenged, as the U.S. southern planters were
after the Civil War, their power remained intact and they were able to
keep and re-create a similar set of extractive institutions from which
they would again benefit. But how can we understand those who come to
power in the name of radical change re-creating the same system? The
answer to this question reveals, once again, that the vicious circle is
stronger than it first appears.</p>
<p>Not all radical changes are doomed to failure. The Glorious
Revolution was a radical change, and it led to what perhaps turned out
to be the most important political revolution of the past two millennia.
The French Revolution was even more radical, with its chaos and
excessive violence and the ascent of Napoleon Bonaparte, but it did not
re-create the ancien régime.</p>
<p>Three factors greatly facilitated the emergence of more inclusive
political institutions following the Glorious Revolution and the French
Revolution. The first was new merchants and businessmen wishing to
unleash the power of creative destruction from which they themselves
would benefit; these new men were among the key members of the
revolutionary coalitions and did not wish to see the development of yet
another set of extractive institutions that would again prey on
them.</p>
<p>The second was the nature of the broad coalition that had formed in
both cases. For example, the Glorious Revolution wasn’t a coup by a
narrow group or a specific narrow interest, but a movement backed by
merchants, industrialists, the gentry, and diverse political groupings.
The same was largely true for the French Revolution.</p>
<p>The third factor relates to the history of English and French
political institutions. They created a background against which new,
more inclusive regimes could develop. In both countries there was a
tradition of parliaments and power sharing going back to the Magna Carta
in England and to the Assembly of Notables in France. Moreover, both
revolutions happened in the midst of a process that had already weakened
the grasp of the absolutist, or aspiring absolutist, regimes. In neither
case would these political institutions make it easy for a new set of
rulers or a narrow group to take control of the state and usurp existing
economic wealth and build unchecked and durable political power. In the
aftermath of the French Revolution, a narrow group under the leadership
of Robespierre and Saint-Just did take control, with disastrous
consequences, but this was temporary and did not derail the path toward
more inclusive institutions. All this contrasts with the situation of
societies with long histories of extreme extractive economic and
political institutions, and no checks on the power of rulers. In these
societies, there would be no new strong merchants or businessmen
supporting and bankrolling the resistance against the existing regime in
part to secure more inclusive economic institutions; no broad coalitions
introducing constraints against the power of each of their members; no
political institutions inhibiting new rulers intent on usurping and
exploiting power.</p>
<p>In consequence, in Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and the Congo, the vicious
circle would be far harder to resist, and moves toward inclusive
institutions far more unlikely to get under way. There were also no
traditional or historical institutions that could check the power of
those who would take control of the state. Such institutions had existed
in some parts of Africa, and some, as in Botswana, even survived the
colonial era. But they were much less prominent throughout Sierra
Leone’s history, and to the extent that they existed, they were warped
by indirect rule. The same was true in other British colonies in Africa,
such as Kenya and Nigeria. They never existed in the absolutist kingdom
of Ethiopia. In the Congo, indigenous institutions were emasculated by
Belgian colonial rule and the autocratic policies of Mobutu. In all
these societies, there were also no new merchants, businessmen, or
entrepreneurs supporting the new regimes and demanding secure property
rights and an end to previous extractive institutions. In fact, the
extractive economic institutions of the colonial period meant that there
was not much entrepreneurship or business left at all.</p>
<p>The international community thought that postcolonial African
independence would lead to economic growth through a process of state
planning and cultivation of the private sector. But the private sector
was not there—except in rural areas, which had no representation in the
new governments and would thus be their first prey. Most important
perhaps, in most of these cases there were enormous benefits from
holding power. These benefits both attracted the most unscrupulous men,
such as Stevens, who wished to monopolize this power, and brought the
worst out of them once they were in power. There was nothing to break
the vicious circle.</p>
<p>NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND VICIOUS CIRCLES</p>
<p>Rich nations are rich largely because they managed to develop
inclusive institutions at some point during the past three hundred
years. These institutions have persisted through a process of virtuous
circles. Even if inclusive only in a limited sense to begin with, and
sometimes fragile, they generated dynamics that would create a process
of positive feedback, gradually increasing their inclusiveness. England
did not become a democracy after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Far
from it. Only a small fraction of the population had formal
representation, but crucially, she was pluralistic. Once pluralism was
enshrined, there was a tendency for the institutions to become more
inclusive over time, even if this was a rocky and uncertain process.</p>
<p>In this, England was typical of virtuous circles: inclusive political
institutions create constraints against the exercise and usurpation of
power. They also tend to create inclusive economic institutions, which
in turn make the continuation of inclusive political institutions more
likely.</p>
<p>Under inclusive economic institutions, wealth is not concentrated in
the hands of a small group that could then use its economic might to
increase its political power disproportionately. Furthermore, under
inclusive economic institutions there are more limited gains from
holding political power, thus weaker incentives for every group and
every ambitious, upstart individual to try to take control of the state.
A confluence of factors at a critical juncture, including interplay
between existing institutions and the opportunities and challenges
brought by the critical juncture, is generally responsible for the onset
of inclusive institutions, as the English case demonstrates. But once
these inclusive institutions are in place, we do not need the same
confluence of factors for them to survive. Virtuous circles, though
still subject to significant contingency, enable the institutions’
continuity and often even unleash dynamics taking society toward greater
inclusiveness.</p>
<p>As virtuous circles make inclusive institutions persist, vicious
circles create powerful forces toward the persistence of extractive
institutions. History is not destiny, and vicious circles are not
unbreakable, as we will see further in chapter 14. But they are
resilient. They create a powerful process of negative feedback, with
extractive political institutions forging extractive economic
institutions, which in turn create the basis for the persistence of
extractive political institutions. We saw this most clearly in the case
of Guatemala, where the same elite held power, first under colonial
rule, then in independent Guatemala, for more than four centuries;
extractive institutions enrich the elite, and their wealth forms the
basis for the continuation of their domination.</p>
<p>The same process of the vicious circle is also apparent in the
persistence of the plantation economy in the U.S. South, except that it
also showcases the vicious circle’s great resilience in the face of
challenges. U.S. southern planters lost their formal control of economic
and political institutions after their defeat in the Civil War. Slavery,
which was the basis of the plantation economy, was abolished, and blacks
were given equal political and economic rights. Yet the Civil War did
not destroy the political power of the planter elite or its economic
basis, and they were able to restructure the system, under a different
guise but still under their own local political control, and to achieve
the same objective: abundance of low-cost labor for the plantations.</p>
<p>This form of the vicious circle, where extractive institutions
persist because the elite controlling them and benefiting from them
persists, is not its only form. At first a more puzzling, but no less
real and no less vicious, form of negative feedback shaped the political
and economic development of many nations, and is exemplified by the
experiences of much of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular Sierra Leone
and Ethiopia. In a form that the sociologist Robert Michels would
recognize as the iron law of oligarchy, the overthrow of a regime
presiding over extractive institutions heralds the arrival of a new set
of masters to exploit the same set of pernicious extractive
institutions.</p>
<p>The logic of this type of vicious circle is also simple to understand
in hindsight: extractive political institutions create few constraints
on the exercise of power, so there are essentially no institutions to
restrain the use and abuse of power by those overthrowing previous
dictators and assuming control of the state; and extractive economic
institutions imply that there are great profits and wealth to be made
merely by controlling power, expropriating the assets of others, and
setting up monopolies.</p>
<p>Of course, the iron law of oligarchy is not a true law, in the sense
that the laws of physics are. It does not chart an inevitable path, as
the Glorious Revolution in England or the Meiji Restoration in Japan
illustrate.</p>
<p>A key factor in these episodes, which saw a major turn toward
inclusive institutions, was the empowerment of a broad coalition that
could stand up against absolutism and would replace the absolutist
institutions by more inclusive, pluralistic ones. A revolution by a
broad coalition makes the emergence of pluralistic political
institutions much more likely. In Sierra Leone and Ethiopia, the iron
law of oligarchy was made more likely not only because existing
institutions were highly extractive but also because neither the
independence movement in the former nor the Derg coup in the latter were
revolutions led by such broad coalitions, but rather by individuals and
groups seeking power so that they could do the extracting.</p>
<p>There is yet another, even more destructive facet of the vicious
circle, anticipated by our discussion of the Maya city-states in chapter
5. When extractive institutions create huge inequalities in society and
great wealth and unchecked power for those in control, there will be
many wishing to fight to take control of the state and institutions.
Extractive institutions then not only pave the way for the next regime,
which will be even more extractive, but they also engender continuous
infighting and civil wars. These civil wars then cause more human
suffering and also destroy even what little state centralization these
societies have achieved. This also often starts a process of descent
into lawlessness, state failure, and political chaos, crushing all hopes
of economic prosperity, as the next chapter will illustrate.</p>
