<h4 id="production">2 ♦ Production</h4>
<p>Sucrose—what we call “sugar”—is an organic chemical of the
carbohydrate family. It can be commercially extracted from various plant
sources, and it occurs in all green plants.1 A plant food manufactured
photosynthetically from carbon dioxide and water, sucrose is thus a
fundamental feature of the chemical architecture of living things.</p>
<p>The two most important sources of processed sucrose—of the refined
carbohydrate product we consume and call “sugar”—are the sugar cane and
the sugar beet. Sugar beets were not economically important as a source
of sucrose until the middle of the nineteenth century, but sugar cane
has been the prime source of sucrose for more than a millennium—perhaps
for much longer.</p>
<p>The sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum L.) was first domesticated in
New Guinea, and very anciently. The botanists Artschwager and Brandes
believe that there were three diffusions of sugar cane from New Guinea,
the first taking place around 8000 B.C. Perhaps two thousand years
later, the cane was carried to the Philippines and India, and possibly
to Indonesia (though some authorities regard Indonesia as yet another
locus of domestication).2</p>
<p>References to sugar making do not appear until well into the
Christian era. There are some earlier references in Indian literature.
The Mahābhāshya of Patanjali, for instance, a commentary on Panini’s
study of Sanskrit, the first grammar of a language ever written
(probably around 400–350 B.C.), mentions sugar repeatedly in particular
food combinations (rice pudding with milk and sugar; barley meal and
sugar; fermented drinks flavored with ginger and sugar); if one assumes
that what was meant was some nonliquid product as least partially
crystallized from the juice of the sugar cane, this would be the
earliest such mention we have. But it is open to doubt, because there is
no sure evidence that the product was crystallized. A little later, in
327 B.C., Nearchus, Alexander’s general, sailing from the mouth of the
Indus River to the mouth of the Euphrates, asserted that “a reed in
India brings forth honey without the help of bees, from which an
intoxicating drink is made though the plant bears no fruit.”3 The sugar
engineer and historian Noel Deerr accepts this as a reference to sugar
cane, but his citations from Greek and Roman authorities are not
entirely convincing. The term sakcharon or saccharon—σάκχαρον—used by
Dioscorides, Pliny, Galen, and others, is not translatable as some
single specific substance. The historian of food R. J. Forbes, carefully
reviewing the evidence from pre-Christian Greece and from Rome,
concluded that saccharon was available in India “and even known, though
imperfectly, to the Hellenistic visitors to this country [India]”; and
here he does mean sugar made from the juice of the sugar cane. He
accepts Dioscorides, who wrote: “There is a kind of concreted honey,
called saccharon, found in reeds in India and Arabia Felix, like in
consistence to salt, and brittle to be broken between the teeth, as salt
is. It is good for the belly and the stomach being dissolved in water
and so drank, helping the pained bladder and the reins.” To which Forbes
adds: “Sugar was therefore produced, at least in small quantities, in
India and was just becoming known to the Roman world in Pliny’s
day”—that is, during the first century A.D.4 He reminds us, however,
that terms like saccharon and even “manna” were used for a variety of
sweet substances, including plant secretions, the excreta of plant lice,
the mannite exudation of Fraxinus ornus (the so-called manna ash tree),
etc.5</p>
<p>Some students of sugar history suppose that saccharon referred to an
entirely different substance, the so-called sugar of bamboo, or
tabashir, a gum that accumulates in the stems of certain bamboos and has
a sweet taste.6 Obscure though this controversy is, it highlights a
vital feature in the history of sugar: sugar must be crystallized from
liquid. What we call “sugar” is the end product of an ancient, complex,
and difficult process.</p>
<p>One begins with the sugar-cane plant itself, a large grass of the
family Gramineae. There are six known species of sugar cane, of which
Saccharum officinarum—“sugar of the apothecaries”—has been important
throughout history. Though other species besides Saccharum officinarum
have been used to breed new varieties in recent decades, the source of
genes for sucrose accumulation has continued to be this species above
all, the so-called noble cane, with soft, sweet, juicy stalks that grow
as thick as two inches, and twelve to fifteen feet high, when mature.
Cane is propagated asexually from cuttings of the stem having at least
one bud.7 Once planted, the cane sprouts and with adequate heat and
moisture may grow an inch a day for six weeks. It becomes ripe—and
reaches the optimum condition for extraction—in a dry season after
anywhere from nine to eighteen months. “Ratoon” cane, grown from the
stubble of the preceding crop without replanting, is normally cut about
every twelve months. Seed cane cuttings in the tropics take longer to
reach maturity. In all cases cane must be cut when ready so as not to
lose its juice or the proportion of sucrose in this juice; and once it
is cut, the juice must be rapidly extracted to avoid rot, desiccation,
inversion, or fermentation.</p>
<p>The intrinsic nature of sugar cane fundamentally affected its
cultivation and processing. “Though we speak of sugar factories,” writes
one scholar, “what actually takes place there is not a manufacturing
process but a series of liquid-solid operations to isolate the sucrose
made by nature in the plant.”8 The practice of crushing or comminuting
the cane fibers so their liquid content can be extracted must be almost
as old as the discovery that the cane was sweet. This extraction can be
accomplished in a number of different ways. The cane can be chopped,
then ground, pressed, pounded, or soaked in liquid. Heating the liquid
containing the sucrose causes evaporation and a resulting sucrose
concentration. As the liquid becomes supersaturated, crystals begin to
appear. In effect, crystallization requires the concentration of a
supersaturated solution in which sucrose is contained in liquid form.
While cooling and crystallizing, low-grade massecuites leave “final” or
“blackstrap” molasses. This molasses, or treacle, cannot be crystallized
further by conventional methods. It is, of course, quite sweet, and can
be used for sweetening food; in the English diet, it was for more than a
century at least as important as any crystalline form of sugar; in
refined forms, it remains important to this day.</p>
<p>This much of the process is ancient. Supplementary steps leading to
sugars that are less dark, chemically purer, or more refined (the latter
two are not the same thing), and to an ever-increasing differentiation
of final products, including alcoholic beverages and many different
syrups, have developed over the centuries. But the basic process is very
old. In fact, there is no other practical means by which to “make” sugar
from the cane than by “a series of liquid-solid operations” accompanied
by heating and cooling; and maintaining proper temperatures, while
keeping the investment in heating methods and fuels affordable, has been
a serious technical problem throughout most of sugar’s history.</p>
<p>The sugar eventually fabricated from the sucrose magma differs
strikingly from both sugar-cane juice and from the various sucrose-rich
syrups used in candy making and food preparation. In certain respects
there is nothing that refined white sugar resembles so much as salt:
white, granular, brittle, and nearly 99 percent pure: “the only chemical
substance to be consumed in practically pure form as a staple food.”9
Thus there are two remarkable different end products of sugar making.
Even though both are sugars and nearly perfectly pure, one is liquid and
usually golden, the other granular and usually white. Pure and refined
sugars may be made in any color, of course. But at one time their
whiteness served as evidence of their fineness and purity. The idea that
the finest and purest sucrose would also be the whitest is probably a
symbolically potent aspect of sugar’s early European history; but the
fact that sucrose can be prepared in many usable forms, one of which
resembles honey, is also significant. The honeylike “treacle” or “golden
syrup,” so important in the making of the modern English diet, gradually
won out over the ancient competitor, honey, which it mimicked. It even
carried off some of the poetic imagery formerly associated with honey.10
We shall have reason to return to both of these features of sugar’s
history.</p>
<p>It is not until about 500 A.D. that we get unmistakable written
evidence of sugar making. The Buddhagosa, or Discourse on Moral
Consciousness, a Hindu religious document, describes by way of analogy
the boiling of juice, the making of molasses, and the rolling of balls
of sugar. (It is likely that the first sugars—sufficiently crystallized
to be nonliquid, but probably not yet intentionally crystallized into
solids—were taffylike rather than brittle.11) But the references are
few, and puzzling. In a report by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius in
627, when he seized a palace dwelling of the Persian king Chosroes II
near Baghdad, sugar is described as an “Indian” luxury. Between the
fourth and eighth centuries, the major sugar-fabrication centers seem to
have been the coast to the west of the Indus delta (coastal
Baluchistan), and the head of the Persian Gulf, on the Tigris-Euphrates
delta. Only after the eighth century was sugar known and consumed in
Europe itself; and only from that same time do references to cane
growing and sugar making around the eastern Mediterranean begin to
appear. Sucrose was practically unknown in northern Europe before
perhaps 1000 A.D., and only barely known for another century or two.
Still, sketching in some crude “periods” or “stages” may provide some
guide to the discussion that follows.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The Arab expansion westward marked a turning point in the European
experience of sugar. Between the defeat of Heraclius in 636 and the
invasion of Spain in 711, in less than a single century, the Arabs
established the caliphate at Baghdad, conquered North Africa, and began
their occupation of major parts of Europe itself. Sugar making, which in
Egypt may have preceded the Arab conquest, spread in the Mediterranean
basin after that conquest. In Sicily, Cyprus, Malta, briefly in Rhodes,
much of the Maghrib (especially in Morocco), and Spain itself
(especially on its south coast), the Arabs introduced the sugar cane,
its cultivation, the art of sugar making, and a taste for this different
sweetness.12 One scholar claims that sugar did not reach Venice until
996, whence it was exported northward; but this date is perhaps late.13
By then sugar cane was being grown across North Africa and on several
Mediterranean islands, including Sicily, as well as being the subject of
agricultural experimentation in Spain itself. But before that, and even
before Venice became a major re-exporting center for Europe, sugar in
many forms was reaching Europe from the Middle East. Persia and India,
the regions that had known sugar making for the longest time, were
probably where the fundamental processes associated with sugar making
had been invented. From the Mediterranean basin, sugar was supplied to
North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe for many centuries. Production
there ceased only when production in New World colonies became dominant,
after the late sixteenth century. During the Mediterranean epoch,
western Europe very slowly became accustomed to sugar. From the
Mediterranean, the industry then shifted to the Atlantic islands of
Spain and Portugal, including Madeira, the Canaries, and São Tomé; but
this relatively brief phase came to an end when the American industries
began to grow.</p>
<p>Only in recent years have the civilizational accomplishments of the
Arab world begun to receive fair attention in the West. The
Europe-centered historical view most of us share tends to exclude
interest in the rest of the world’s technical accomplishments, which we
seem to recognize best when we “explain” them by reference to great
inputs of labor (the Pyramids, the Great Wall, the Temple to the Sun,
Machu Picchu, etc.); our warmest compliments are saved for the
aesthetic, not the technical, achievements of those we regard as
technically inferior, whether we admit it or not. Though we never quite
bring ourselves to say so baldly, the western view is one of amazement
that the aesthetic capacities of other peoples are not confined by their
technical limitations. Yet anyone even casually interested in the
history of southern Europe knows that the Moorish conquest of Spain was
only the terminus of a brilliantly rapid westward expansion, as much
technical and military as economic, political, and religious.</p>
<p>The Moors were not halted in their outward movement until they
reached Poitiers in 732, where Charles Martel turned their flank. That
year marked only the hundredth anniversary of the death of Mohammed and
of the installation of the first caliph, Abu Bakr. After 759, the Moors
withdrew from Toulouse and southern France and entrenched themselves
behind the Pyrenees; but it would be seven hundred years before the
Spain they had conquered in only seven would once again become
completely Christian. Some portions of the Mediterranean world fell to
Islam after Spain herself had fallen. Crete, for instance, was not taken
until 823; Malta not until 870. And wherever they went, the Arabs
brought with them sugar, the product and the technology of its
production; sugar, we are told, followed the Koran.</p>
<p>Though the unusual demands of sugar cultivation slowed its
development as a commercial crop throughout the Islamic Mediterranean,
its perfection as far north as central Spain was a great technical
achievement. The Mediterranean’s Arab conquerors were synthesists,
innovators transporting the diverse cultural riches of the lands they
subjugated back and forth across portions of three continents,
combining, intermixing, and inventing, creating new adaptations. And
many significant crops—rice, sorghum, hard wheat, cotton, eggplant,
citrus fruits, plantains, mangoes, and sugar cane—were diffused by the
spread of Islam.14 But it was not so much, or exclusively, new crops
that mattered; with the Arab conquerors there also traveled phalanxes of
subordinate administrators (predominantly non-Arab), policies of
administration and taxation, technologies of irrigation, production, and
processing, and the impulses to expand production.</p>
<p>The spread of sugar cane and the technology required for its
cultivation and conversion encountered obstacles—mostly rain and
seasonal temperature fluctuations. As we have seen, sugar cane is a
tropical and subtropical crop with a growing season that may be in
excess of twelve months; it requires large amounts of water and labor.
Though it can flourish without irrigation, it does far better (and
increases its sugar content) when it is watered regularly and when its
growing season is not subject to sharp and sudden declines in
temperature.</p>
<p>Early Islam in the Mediterranean actually added to the agricultural
seasons by producing crops like sugar cane in the summer, thereby
altering the round of the agricultural year and the allocation of labor
during it. By expanding the production of sugar cane on both southern
and northern fringes of the Mediterranean—as far south as Marrakech and
even Agadir and Taroudant in Morocco, for instance; and as far north as
Valencia in Spain and Palermo in Sicily—the Arabs tested to their limits
the potentialities of these newly conquered lands. On the one hand, the
danger of frosts on the northern margins meant a shorter growing
season—sugar planted in February or March had to be harvested in
January. Such cane required just as much labor—from preparing the fields
through processing the syrup—for less yield; this eventually counted
against the Mediterranean industries when American sugar began to enter
Europe in large quantities. On the other hand, the lack of adequate
rainfall on the southern margins—as in Egypt—meant labor-intensive
irrigation; in the Egyptian case, we are told, cane got twenty-eight
wettings from planting to cutting.15</p>
<p>Sugar cane—if the crop is to be used to make sugar and not just for
the extraction of juice, so that proper cultivation, prompt cutting and
grinding, and skilled processing are involved—has always been a
labor-intensive crop, at least until well into the twentieth century.
Sugar production was a challenge not only in technical and political
(administrative) terms, but also in regard to the securing and use of
labor.</p>
<p>Everywhere, the Arabs showed a lively interest in irrigation, water
use, and water conservation. They took with them, wherever they went,
every watering device they encountered. To existing pre-Islamic forms of
irrigation in the Mediterranean, they added the Persian bucket wheel
(which the Spaniards call noria, from the Arabic term for “creaking
sound”), the water screw, the Persian qanat (that remarkable
labor-intensive system of engineered underground tunnels serving to
carry ground water to arable fields by sheer gravity, apparently brought
to Spain first and thence to North Africa), and many other devices. None
of these innovations by itself could have made a decisive difference;
what mattered was the energy and dedication of the conquerors and their
apparently skillful use of local labor—in itself a subject of the
greatest importance, but concerning which we still know relatively
little.</p>
<p>Deerr tells us that there was “one great difference between the sugar
industry founded by the Arabs and that developed by Christian Europeans.
Although Islam recognized the status of slavery, the Mediterranean
industry is free from that ruthless and bloody reproach, the curse of
organized slavery that for 400 years tainted the New World
production.”16 But this flat claim is unfounded. Slavery played a part
in the Moroccan sugar industry17 and probably elsewhere; a slave revolt
involving thousands of East African agricultural laborers took place in
the Tigris-Euphrates delta in the mid-ninth century, and they may even
have been sugar-cane-plantation workers.18 But slavery did grow more
important as the European Crusaders seized the sugar plantations of the
eastern Mediterranean from their predecessors; and its importance for
sugar production did not diminish significantly until the Haitian
Revolution, at the close of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The sugars of the Arabs were no single homogeneous substance; from
the Persians and Indians, the Arabs had learned a variety of sugar types
or categories. We know about these various sugars and even something
about the processes of their manufacture, but the details remain vague.
Milling also poses a question: some studies of the history of Arab
milling have been made, but it remains an area of controversy.19 In the
extraction of juice from the cane, the more efficient the process, the
greater the eventual yield. High-percentage yields of cane juice date
only from the late nineteenth century, although there was improvement
beginning at least in the seventeenth.</p>
<p>A decisive step in sugar technology came with the invention of the
vertical three-roller mill, powered by either water or animal traction.
This mill could be operated by two or three persons, who would pass the
cane back and forth through the rollers (if animal-powered rather than
hydraulic, the mill required a third worker to look after the animal or
animals). The origins and exact ages of such mills remain obscure. Deerr
(following Lippmann) attributes their invention to Pietro Speciale,
prefect of Sicily, in 1449;20 Soares Pereira doubts this—and with good
reason, arguing instead that it was invented in Peru and came to Brazil
between 1608 and 1612, then elsewhere.21 But this controversy hardly
concerns us, because the Arabs’ Mediterranean sugar industry, some five
centuries prior to Speciale’s alleged invention, made do with other,
less efficient systems. There is sure evidence of the use of water power
for cane milling at an early time in Morocco and Sicily, even if beyond
that we know little.</p>
<p>The Crusades gave many Europeans the opportunity—though not the
first, as is sometimes claimed—to familiarize themselves with many new
products, sugar among them. The Crusaders learned about sugar under
pressing circumstances, we are told. Albert van Aachen, who collected
the reminiscences of veterans of the First Crusade (1096–99),
writes:</p>
<p>In the fields of the plains of Tripoli can be found in abundance a
honey reed which they call Zuchra; the people are accustomed to suck
enthusiastically on these reeds, delighting themselves with their
beneficial juices, and seem unable to sate themselves with this pleasure
in spite of their sweetness. The plant is grown, presumably and with
great effort, by the inhabitants. . . . It was on this sweet-tasting
sugar cane that people sustained themselves during the sieges of
Elbarieh, Marrah, and Arkah, when tormented by fearsome hunger.22</p>
<p>But it was not just that the Crusades taught the peoples of western
Europe about sugar. Soon enough the Crusaders were supervising the
production of that same sugar in the areas they had conquered, as in the
kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1187), until it fell to Saladin. They became
the supervisors of sugar-cane cultivation and sugar production at the
still-visible site called Tawahin A-Sukkar, “the sugar mills,” scarcely
a kilometer’s remove from Jericho, where mills that were still in use in
1484 are documented as early as 1116.23 (Though it is not certain they
were used to grind cane at the earlier of these dates, they were surely
so used later.)</p>
<p>When Acre fell to the Saracens in 1291, the Knights of Malta were
planting cane there (at a later point in history, they sought to
establish plantations in the Caribbean). Meanwhile, Venetian merchants
were energetically developing sugar enterprises near Tyre, on Crete, and
on Cyprus. In other words, Europeans became producers of sugar (or,
better, the controllers of sugar producers in conquered areas) as a
consequence of the Crusades.</p>
<p>The decline of the Mediterranean sugar industry has traditionally—and
for the most part correctly—been attributed to the rise of a competing
sugar industry on the Atlantic islands and, later, in the New World. But
in fact, as the geographer J. H. Galloway pointed out, the
eastern-Mediterranean industry lost ground a century before the first
sugar was produced in Madeira, and sugar production in Sicily, Spain,
and Morocco actually gained ground in the fifteenth century.24 He
believes that warfare and plague, with the resultant declines of
population, hurt the sugar industry in Crete and Cyprus. Also, the
prices of labor-costly goods like sugar rose after the Black Death.
Indeed, in his opinion, it was the expanded use of slave labor to
compensate for plague-connected mortality that initiated the strange and
enduring relationship between sugar and slavery: “The link between sugar
cultivation and slavery which was to last until the nineteenth century
became firmly forged in Crete, Cyprus, and Morocco.”25</p>
<p>The decline of the Mediterranean sugar industry that had been created
by the Arabs was uneven and protracted. In some subregions, the
successive contractions of Arab political control, often resulting in
inferior local administration, put an end to effective irrigation and
labor allocation. In others, the Christian challenge sometimes resulted
in continued sugar production under the invader’s auspices—for instance,
in Sicily after the Norman conquest, and on Cyprus. Yet, though the
Crusaders and the merchants from Amalfi, Genoa, and other Italian states
divided among themselves the duties of administering production and
trade, these arrangements did not last long. Portugal was not content to
experiment with sugar-cane cultivation at home in the Algarve when
better opportunities beckoned elsewhere, and Spain was not far
behind.</p>
<p>The Christian continuation of Arab production in the eastern
Mediterranean, on the one hand, and the experiments undertaken by
Portugal (and soon by Spain) at the western end of that sea on the
other, foretokened two rather different developments, however. In the
eastern Mediterranean, production actually rose at first, even following
the withdrawal of the Franks from Palestine in the thirteenth century,
and the later Ottoman expansion. Crete, Cyprus, and Egypt continued to
produce sugar for export.26 Yet this region became less and less
important as a source of sugar; and it was the development of the
industry by the Portuguese and Spaniards on the Atlantic islands that
changed forever the character of European sugar consumption. These were
the stepping stones by which the industry would move from the Old World
to the New; it was in the form perfected on them that the New World
industry was to find its prototype.</p>
<p>Even before the New World industries were established, however, the
sugar industry on the Atlantic islands damaged the competitive position
of Malta, Rhodes, Sicily, and the other small Mediterranean producers.
By 1580 the Sicilian industry, once flourishing, did little more than
supply its domestic market, and in Spain itself, sugar production began
to decline in the seventeenth century, though sugar did continue to be
produced in the extreme south of the peninsula.</p>
<p>At the time that the Portuguese and the Spaniards set out to
establish a sugar industry on the Atlantic islands they controlled,
sugar was still a luxury, a medicine, and a spice in western Europe. The
peoples of Greece, Italy, Spain, and North Africa were familiar with
sugar cane as a crop and, to some extent, with sugar itself as a
sweetener. But as sugar production in the Mediterranean waned, knowledge
of sugar and the desire for it waxed in Europe. The movement of the
industry to the Atlantic islands occurred when European demand was
probably growing. Individual entrepreneurs were encouraged to establish
sugar-cane (and other) plantations on the Atlantic islands, manned with
African slaves and destined to produce sugar for Portugal and other
European markets, because their presence safeguarded the extension of
Portuguese trade routes around Africa and toward the Orient:</p>
<p>In . . . a series of experiments, the plantation system, now
combining African slaves under the authority of European settlers in a
racially mixed society, producing sugar cane and other commercial crops,
spread as island after island [the Madeira Islands, including Madeira,
La Palma, and Hierro; the Canary Islands, including Tenerife, Gran
Canaria, and Fuerteventura; the nine widely scattered islands that
compose the Azores; the Cape Verde Islands, including Boa Vista, Sto.
Antão, and São Tiago; São Tomé and Principe; etc.] was integrated as
part of the expanding kingdom. In only some of the islands did sugar
cane plantations prosper. . . . But overall, sugar cane and the
plantation did enable the government of Portugal, once it had committed
itself to the policy of commercially oriented expansion, to have
settled, at the expense of private citizens, island bases that gave her
control of the South Atlantic and made possible the rounding of Africa
and trade in the East.27</p>
<p>There were intimate links between the Atlantic-island experiments of
the Portuguese, especially São Tomé, and west European centers of
commercial and technical power, especially Antwerp.28 It is of
particular significance that from the thirteenth century onward, the
refining center for European sugar was Antwerp, followed later by other
great port cities such as Bristol, Bordeaux, and even London. Control of
the final product moved into European hands—but not, it bears noting,
into those of the same Europeans (in this instance, the Portuguese) who
pioneered the production of sugar overseas. The increasing
differentiation of sugars, in line with the growing differentiation of
demand, was another cause of growth. The descriptive lexicon for sugars
expanded, as more and more sorts became familiar to the Europeans.29</p>
<p>Sugar itself was now known throughout western Europe, even though it
was still a product de luxe, rather than a common commodity or
necessity. No longer so precious a good as musk or pearls, shipped to
the courts of Europe via intermediary countries and their luxury
traders, sugar was becoming a raw material whose supply and refining
were managed more and more by European powers, as European populations
consumed it in larger and larger quantities. The political
differentiation of the western states interested in sugar proceeded
apace after the fifteenth century. To a surprising degree, the way sugar
figured in national policies indicated—perhaps even exercised some
influence over—political futures.</p>
<p>Portugal’s and Spain’s sugar experiments in the Atlantic islands had
many parallels, though later they diverged sharply. In the fifteenth
century both powers looked for favorable locales for sugar production:
while Portugal seized São Tomé and other islands, Spain captured the
Canaries. After about 1450, Madeira was the leading supplier, followed
by São Tomé; by the 1500s, the Canary Islands had also become
important.30 And both powers experienced a growing demand for sugar
(suggested, for instance, by the household accounts of Isabella the
Catholic, queen of Castile from 1474 to 1504).</p>
<p>The sugar industries in the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic islands
were characterized by slave labor, a tradition supposedly transferred
from the Mediterranean sugar plantations of the Arabs and Crusaders. But
the Spanish scholar Fernández-Armesto tells us that the striking feature
of the Canarian industry was its use of both free and enslaved labor, a
combination that resembled more the pioneering mixed-labor systems of a
later era: the seventeenth-century British and French Caribbean
plantations, on which enslaved and indentured laborers would work
alongside one another. Slaves were decidedly important, perhaps crucial;
but a substantial amount of the labor was actually done by free wage
earners paid partly in kind—some of them specialists, others temporary
laborers. This system was probably not quite so atypical as it seems.
But it is true that free wage earners hardly figure in sugar’s history
between the Atlantic island phase and the epoch of revolution and
emancipation in the New World, from the start of the Haitian Revolution
until emancipation in Brazil. “The Canarian system,” Fernández-Armesto
tells us, “evokes far more the methods of the Old World, and the equal
sharing of produce between owners and workers is most akin to the
farming a mezzadria, which developed in late medieval northern Italy and
in some parts is still practised today.”31</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Sugar cane was first carried to the New World by Columbus on his
second voyage, in 1493; he brought it there from the Spanish Canary
Islands. Cane was first grown in the New World in Spanish Santo Domingo;
it was from that point that sugar was first shipped back to Europe,
beginning around 1516. Santo Domingo’s pristine sugar industry was
worked by enslaved Africans, the first slaves having been imported there
soon after the sugar cane. Hence it was Spain that pioneered sugar cane,
sugar making, African slave labor, and the plantation form in the
Americas. Some scholars agree with Fernando Ortiz that these plantations
were “the favored child of capitalism,” and other historians quarrel
with this assessment. But even if Spain’s achievements in sugar
production did not rival those of the Portuguese until centuries later,
their pioneering nature has never been in doubt, though scholars of New
World sugar have sometimes neglected Spain’s early Caribbean
accomplishments in the sugar trade because their global significance was
slight. Wallerstein and Braudel are cavalier in their disregard; Braudel
has sugar cane and sugar mills not reaching Santo Domingo until after
1654, for instance.32</p>
<p>By 1526, Brazil was shipping sugar to Lisbon in commercial
quantities, and soon the sixteenth century was the Brazilian century for
sugar. Within the Spanish New World, the early achievements in Santo
Domingo and the rest of the Caribbean were outstripped by developments
on the mainland. In Mexico, Paraguay, the Pacific coast of South
America, and in fertile valleys everywhere, sugar cane prospered.</p>
<p>Yet the very first experiments with sugar-cane growing and sugar
making on Santo Domingo had been doomed to failure. When two planters
there tried to make sugar—Aguilón in 1505–6 and Ballester in 1512—Spain
was not yet ready to support their ambitions, nor were the skills extant
in Santo Domingo able to sustain them.33 The only available milling
techniques were probably modeled on tenth-century Egyptian edge-roller
mill designs, originally intended for use as olive presses. Such devices
were inefficient and wasteful of labor. Another serious problem was the
labor supply itself. The rapid destruction of the indigenous
Arawakan-speaking Taino Indians of Santo Domingo had left too little
manpower even for the gold mines, let alone for the experimental sugar
plantations. The first African slaves were imported before 1503, and in
spite of local fears of depredations by slave runaways (cimarrones), the
importations continued. By 1509, enslaved Africans were being imported
to work the royal mines; others soon followed to power the sugar
industry.</p>
<p>When the surgeon Gonzalo de Vellosa—perhaps taking note of the rising
prices of sugar in Europe—imported skilled sugar masters from the Canary
Islands in 1515, he took the first step toward creating an authentic
sugar industry in the Caribbean. With the Canary Island technicians, he
(and his new partners, the Tapia brothers) imported a mill with two
vertical rollers, usable with either animal or water power and
“patterned on that developed in 1449 by Pietro Speciale.”34 The gold
deposits in Santo Domingo were soon nearly exhausted; labor was more and
more likely to be African, as the vertiginous decline of the aboriginal
population continued. But the price of sugar had become high enough in
Europe to compensate partly for cost of transporting it, and to
encourage additional risks in production, perhaps especially in Spain’s
settled Caribbean colonies, where alternative opportunities (such as
mining) were shrinking.</p>
<p>One scholar has estimated that the mill fabricated by the Canary
Island engineers in Santo Domingo could grind enough cane in one season
to produce 125 tons of sugar a year if water-powered, and “perhaps a
third of that tonnage” if powered by animals.35 Vellosa and his
associates lacked the capital to develop the infant industry by
themselves. But they took advantage of the presence of three Jeronymite
fathers, sent to Santo Domingo to supervise Indian labor policy, who
eventually became the de facto governors of the colony. At first the
Jeronymites merely endorsed the pleas of the planters for royal support.
Soon, however, they made loans of state revenues they had collected to
the planters.36 When the new king, Charles I, ordered the replacement of
the Jeronymites by the royal judge Rodrigo de Figueroa, the policy of
state assistance continued and expanded. By the 1530s, the island had a
“fairly stable total” of thirty-four mills; and by 1568, “plantations
owning a hundred-fifty to two hundred slaves were not uncommon. A few of
the more magnificent estates possessed up to five hundred slaves, with
production figures correspondingly high.”37 One interesting feature of
this development was the part played by the state and, indeed, by civil
servants, who owned, administered, bought, and sold plantations. Not
only was there no private and separate “planter class” at the outset;
the commission merchants and other intermediaries who emerge in the
Caribbean sugar colonies of other, rival powers were absent.</p>
<p>In the other Greater Antilles—Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica—Spanish
settlers eventually brought in sugar cane, the methods for its
cultivation, the technology of water- and animal-powered mills, enslaved
labor, and the process for grinding, boiling, and fabricating sugars and
molasses from extracted juice, as well as for distilling rum from the
molasses. And yet this burgeoning Spanish American industry came to
almost nothing—in spite of royal support, much intelligent
experimentation, and successful production. The Portuguese planters in
Brazil succeeded where the Spaniards in the Antilles failed. Within only
a century, the French, and even more the British (though with Dutch help
from the outset), became the western world’s great sugar makers and
exporters. One wonders why the early phase of the Hispanic sugar
industry stagnated so swiftly after such promising beginnings, and the
explanations we have are not entirely satisfactory. The flight of island
colonists to the Mexican mainland after the conquest of Tenochtitlán
(1519–21); the Spaniards’ obsession with metallic riches; the
excessively authoritarian controls imposed by the crown on all
productive private enterprise in the New World; the chronic lack of
capital for investment; the so-called deshonor del trabajo (ignobility
of [manual] labor) supposedly typical of the Spanish colonists—these
factors seem reasonable, but are not entirely convincing. Probably we
will not learn why such important early experiments failed until we
better understand the nature of the Spanish market for Caribbean sugars,
and Spain’s ability or inability to export a sugar surplus. With Spain’s
conquests of Mexico and the Andes, a basic shift was created in policy:
for more than two centuries thereafter, the Caribbean possessions served
primarily as way stations and fortresses along the trade routes,
signaling Spain’s unproductive, tribute-taking, labor-squandering role
in the Americas. The pioneering opportunity was soon lost; from about
1580 in the Greater Antilles, until the French and the English began
sugar-cane planting on the smaller islands (particularly Barbados and
Martinique), after 1650, the Caribbean region produced little sugar for
export. By that time the European market situation had modified, and the
momentum of production had passed out of Spanish hands.38</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Whereas the Spaniards (and, to a lesser extent, the Portuguese)
concentrated their colonizing efforts in the New World on the extraction
of precious metals, for their North European rivals trade and the
production of marketable commodities mattered more, and plantation
products figured importantly—cotton, indigo, and, soon enough, two
beverage crops: cacao, a New World cultigen and more an indigenous food
than a drink, and coffee, of African origin. The costs of labor and the
lack of capital held down New World plantation production at first, and
gains were made at the cost of production elsewhere. “To thrive, the
colonists had to catch better or cheaper fish than the Dutch in the
Baltic or the North Sea, to trap or persuade the Indians to trap better
or cheaper furs than the Russians, to grow better or cheaper sugar than
the Javanese or Bengalis.”39 The first crop in the New World to win a
market for itself was tobacco, an American domesticate, swiftly
transformed from a rare upper-class luxury into a working-class
necessity. Tobacco made headway even against royal disapproval, and
became part of the consumption of ordinary folk by the seventeenth
century. But by the end of that century, sugar was outpacing tobacco in
both the British and the French West Indies; by 1700, the value of sugar
reaching England and Wales was double that of tobacco. The shift from
tobacco to sugar was initially even more pronounced in the French
Caribbean colonies than in the British, though in the long term the
French market for sugar never attained the scale of the British
market.</p>
<p>Certain facts stand out in the history of sugar between the early
decades of the seventeenth century, when the British, Dutch, and French
established Caribbean plantations, and the middle of the nineteenth
century, by which time Cuba and Brazil were the major centers of New
World production. Over this long period, sugar production grew steadily,
as more westerners consumed sugar and each consumer used it more
heavily. Yet technological changes in the field, in grinding, and even
in refining itself were relatively minor. Generally speaking, the
enlarged market for sugar was satisfied by a steady extension of
production rather than by sharp increases in yield per acre of land or
ton of cane, or in productivity per worker.</p>
<p>But the impulse to produce sugar, as well as to trade in it and
consume it, can be traced further back in the record. Soon after Sir
Walter Raleigh’s first voyage to the Guianas in 1595, the English
explorer Captain Charles Leigh attempted to start a settlement on the
Waiapoco (Oyapock) River (now the border between Brazil and French
Guiana). Though neither effort succeeded, both were connected with an
interest in sugar and other tropical products. In 1607 Jamestown—the
first English colony in the New World—was founded. Sugar cane was
brought there in 1619—as were the first enslaved Africans to reach an
English colony—but the cane would not grow. Three years earlier, sugar
cane had been planted in Bermuda, but this tiny, arid island never
produced sugar. These facts indicate that even before the seventeenth
century there was a lively awareness of the desirability of sugar, and
of at least some of its potential market—in short, of its long-term
profitability as a commodity. The aim of acquiring colonies that could
produce sugar (among other things) for the metropolis hence predates the
seventeenth century. And before she was able to produce sugar in her own
colonies, England was not above stealing it. In 1591 a Spanish spy
reported that “English booty in West India [American] produce is so
great that sugar is cheaper in London than it is in Lisbon or the Indies
themselves.”40</p>
<p>The turning point for British sugar was the settlement of Barbados in
1627, an island Britain claimed after Captain John Powell’s landing
there in 1625, while returning to Europe from Brazil. It was not until
around 1655—the same year the British invasion of Jamaica was launched
as part of the Western Design—that Barbadian sugar began to affect the
home market, however. (In that year, 283 tons of “clayed” sugars and
6,667 tons of “muscovado” sugars were produced in Barbados;41 meanwhile,
other Caribbean acquisitions also began to contribute to homeland
consumption, and to make of sugar an imperial source of profit.) After
1655 and until the mid-nineteenth century, the sugar supply of the
English people would be provided substantially within the skein of the
empire. From the establishment of the first British colonies that
succeeded by exporting unfinished products—particularly sugar—to the
metropolis, imperial laws were passed to control the flow of such goods,
and of the goods for which they were exchanged.42</p>
<p>At the consumption end, changes were both numerous and diverse. Sugar
steadily changed from being a specialized—medicinal, condimental,
ritual, or display—commodity into an ever more common food. This
insertion of an essentially new product within popular European tastes
and preferences was irreversible, though the cost of sugar at times
certainly braked consumption.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century was of course one of tremendous activity for
English sailors, merchants, adventurers, and royal agents. Many more
individual English colonies were established in the New World than Dutch
or French; and the English settler population, including African slaves,
far exceeded that of either of her two principal North European rivals.
From 1492 until 1625, the Spanish Caribbean, though weakened by
smuggling and raids, remained intact; but when St. Kitts was settled, an
irreversible process of English territorial expansion began there, which
reached its climax only thirty years later with the invasion of Jamaica.
The seventeenth century was also the century of European naval wars in
the Caribbean, as north European powers defined their stakes; their
scale varied from hit-and-run piracy and town burning to large-scale
naval encounters. Several different but related processes were occurring
at once, but Spain was everyone’s enemy, for it was upon her predefined
colonial empire that they all fed.</p>
<p>England fought the most, conquered the most colonies, imported the
most slaves (to her own colonies and, in absolute numbers, in her own
bottoms), and went furthest and fastest in creating a plantation system.
The most important product of that system was sugar. Coffee, chocolate
(cacao), nutmeg, and coconut were among the other products; but the
amount of sugar produced, the numbers of its users, and the range of its
uses exceeded the others; and it remained the principal product for
centuries. In 1625, Portugal was supplying nearly all of Europe with
sugar from Brazil. But the English soon developed their sources in
Barbados and then in Jamaica, as well as in other “sugar islands.” The
English learned methods of producing sugar and its kindred substances
from the Dutch, whose experiments with plantation agriculture on the
Guiana coast the Portuguese had thwarted. From humble beginnings on the
island of Barbados in the 1640s, the British sugar industry expanded
with astounding rapidity, engulfing first that island and, soon after,
Jamaica—the first territorial conquest from Spain in the Greater
Antilles, and nearly thirty times the size of Barbados. As English sugar
became price-competitive with Portuguese sugar, England was able to
drive Portugal out of the north European trade. From the resulting
monopoly came monopoly prices, however, and then stiff competition from
the French.43 In 1660, sugar was enumerated (and taxed); but the West
India colonies were given a virtual monopoly of Britain’s national
market. In France, restrictive policies kept English sugars competitive
until about 1740, when French rivalry won out. Britain never again
retrieved the European markets, but her planters and merchantmen
consoled themselves with the domestic market. In 1660, England consumed
1,000 hogsheads of sugar and exported 2,000. In 1700, she imported about
50,000 hogsheads and exported about 18,000. By 1730, 100,000 hogsheads
were imported and 18,000 exported, and by 1753, when England imported
110,000 hogsheads, she re-exported only 6,000. “As the supply from the
British West Indies increased, England’s demand kept pace with it, and
from the middle of the eighteenth century these islands seem never to
have been able to produce much more sugar than was needed for
consumption in the mother country.”44</p>
<p>The steps by which England shifted from buying modest quantities of
sugar from Mediterranean shippers; to importing in her own bottoms a
somewhat larger supply; to buying yet larger quantities from the
Portuguese, first in the Atlantic islands and then in Brazil, but
refined outside England; to establishing her own sugar colonies—first to
feed herself and to vie with Portugal for customers and then, with time,
simply to feed herself, finishing the processing in her own
refineries—are complex, but they followed in so orderly a fashion as to
seem almost inevitable. On the one hand, they represent an extension of
empire outward, but on the other, they mark an absorption, a kind of
swallowing up, of sugar consumption as a national habit. Like tea, sugar
came to define English “character.”</p>
<p>The vision of an expanding consumers’ market at home was grasped
quite early. Sir Josiah Child, a pioneering mercantilist (“That all
Colonies or Plantations do endamage their Mother-Kingdoms, whereof the
Trades of such Plantations are not confined by severe Laws, and good
execution of those Laws, to the Mother-Kingdom”), stressed the need to
control the colonies so that their trade could be confined to the profit
of the metropolis:</p>
<p>It is in his Majesty’s power, and the Parliament’s, if they please,
by taking off all charges from Sugar, to make it more entirely an
English Commodity, than White Herrings are a Dutch Commodity; and to
draw more Profit to the Kingdom thereby, than the Dutch do by that. And
that in consequence thereof all Plantations of other Nations, must in a
few Years sink to little or nothing.45</p>
<p>Sir Dalby Thomas, governor of Jamaica and a sugar planter himself in
the late seventeenth century, was an early booster of sugar production.
He also envisioned how flourishing sugar colonies might be consumers of
the mother country’s products as well:</p>
<p>The greatest consumption of Sugar is made by themselves [the
legislators of Parliament] and the rest of the rich and opulent People
of the Nation.</p>
<p>The Quantity yearly produc’d is not less than 45,000 tuns [he is
presumably speaking of all sugars produced in British colonies at the
time, circa 1690].</p>
<p>The Moiety of this is consum’d in England, and amounts to about
£800,000 in Value. The other Moiety is exported, and after it has
employed Seamen, is sold for as much, and consequently brings back to
the Nation in Money, or useful Goods, £800,000. Add to this, That before
Sugars were produc’d in our Colonies, it bore four times the Price it
does now; and by the same Consumption at the same Price, except we make
it our selves, we should be forc’d to give in Money or Money’s worth, as
Native Commodities and Labour, £240,000 for the Sugar we spend.</p>
<p>To which the historian Oldmixon warmly adds, “’Tis certain we bought
as much Sugar of Portugal as amounted to £400,000 yearly, which is sav’d
by our making it.”46 Thomas continues: “We must consider too the Spirits
arising from Melasses, which is sent from the Sugar Colonies to the
other Colonies and to England; which if all were sold in England, and
turn’d into Spirits, it would amount annually to above £500,000 at half
the Price the like Quantity of Brandy from France would cost.” He
recognized not only the different sources of mercantile profit to be had
from the sugar colonies, but also the vast and incompletely fulfilled
promise of these colonies as buyers of the finished goods of the
metropolis. In arguing that America’s mainland southern colonies
resembled more closely the Antilles than New England, he put this part
of the case eloquently:</p>
<p>. . . could they readily get Negroes from Guinea, every one of which
consumes yearly two Hilling-Hoes, two Weeding-Hoes, two Grubbing-Hoes,
besides Axes, Saws, Wimbles, Nails, and other Iron Tools and Materials,
consum’d in Building and other Uses, to the Value of at least £120,000
in only Iron-Work. The Cloaths, Guns, Cordage, Anchors, Sails, and
Materials for Shipping, besides Beds and other Houshold Goods, consum’d
and us’d by them is infinite: Nor is the Benefit of them to the Kingdom
sufficiently to be explained, therefore, let it suffice, in a Word, to
Say, that the Produce and Consumption, with the Shipping they give
Employment to, is of an infinite deal more Benefit to the Wealth,
Honour, and Strength of the Nation, than four times the same Number of
Hands, the best employ’d at home can be.47</p>
<p>Thomas grasped the unfolding of what was to be Europe’s greatest mass
market for a foreign luxury. And he saw that because the whole
process—from the establishment of colonies, the seizure of slaves, the
amassing of capital, the protection of shipping, and all else to actual
consumption—took shape under the wing of the state, such undertakings
were at every point as meaningful politically as they were economically.
Like all of the eloquent sugar touts to follow him, Thomas made his
arguments both economic and political (he was not above making them
medicinal and ceremonial as well):</p>
<p>The Europeans 500 years since, were perfect strangers to the use of
it [sugar], and scarcely knew its name . . . but the Physitians soon
found [it] to answer all the ends of honey, without many of its ill
effects: So that it quickly became a Commodity in mighty esteem, and
though the price then was ten times more than now, yet it prevailed so
fast, and the Consumption of it became so great. . . .</p>
<p>The Vertues of Mellasses formerly sold only in Apothecary’s Shops by
the name of Treacle being now so well known both to the Distiller and
Brewer . . . nor can it be imagined how many new ways are found dayly
for Venting and Consuming usefully the various products of a
Sugar-Plantation: The severall Shapes it appears in at Christenings,
Banquets and Rich mens Tables, being but the least of its good
qualities, tho’ of great Delight as well as Ornament, and should the art
of making it be so discouraged as to take its next flight to the Dutch
or French, as it did from Portugall to Us, the loss would prove of the
like Consequence, which is no less than the decay of the greatest part
of their Shipping, and the fall of half their Revenues. . . .48</p>
<p>We can see that Englishmen understood well the benefits of having
their own sugar-producing colonies, and that they also understood better
and better the growth potential of the British market for sugar. Hence
it is no surprise that later centuries saw the production of tropical
commodities in the colonies tied ever more closely to British
consumption—and to the production of British shops and factories.
Production and consumption—at least with regard to the product we are
considering here—were not simply opposite sides of the same coin, but
neatly interdigitated; it is difficult to imagine one without the
other.</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty years after Thomas rhapsodized on sugar and the
sugar trade, another Englishman commented on the colonies and their
products in illuminating fashion. “There is a class of trading and
exporting communities,” John Stuart Mill wrote, “on which a few words of
explanation seem to be required.”</p>
<p>These are hardly to be looked upon as countries, carrying on an
exchange of commodities with other countries, but more properly as
outlying agricultural or manufacturing estates belonging to a larger
community. Our West Indian colonies, for example, cannot be regarded as
countries with a productive capital of their own . . . [but are,
rather,] the place where England finds it convenient to carry on the
production of sugar, coffee and a few other tropical commodities. All
the capital employed is English capital; almost all the industry is
carried on for English uses; there is little production of anything
except for staple commodities, and these are sent to England, not to be
exchanged for things exported to the colony and consumed by its
inhabitants, but to be sold in England for the benefit of the
proprietors there. The trade with the West Indies is hardly to be
considered an external trade, but more resembles the traffic between
town and country.49</p>
<p>While it is true that these tropical commodities were not exchanged
in the United Kingdom, but were sold instead for the profit of the
plantation proprietors, it is also true that nearly everything consumed
in the West Indian colonies came from England. There were no direct
exchanges between the motherland and the colonies, but the patterns of
exchange worked to the long-term benefit of imperial enterprise.</p>
<p>There grew up, in effect, two so-called triangles of trade, both of
which arose in the seventeenth century and matured in the eighteenth.
The first and most famous triangle linked Britain to Africa and to the
New World: finished goods were sold to Africa, African slaves to the
Americas, and American tropical commodities (especially sugar) to the
mother country and her importing neighbors. The second triangle
functioned in a manner contradictory to the mercantilist ideal. From New
England went rum to Africa, whence slaves to the West Indies, whence
molasses back to New England (with which to make rum). The maturation of
this second triangle put the New England colonies on a political
collision course with Britain, but the underlying problems were
economic, taking on political import precisely because they brought
divergent economic interests into confrontation.</p>
<p>The important feature of these triangles is that human cargoes
figured vitally in their operation. It was not just that sugar, rum, and
molasses were not being traded directly for European finished goods; in
both transatlantic triangles the only “false commodity”—yet absolutely
essential to the system—was human beings. Slaves were a “false
commodity” because a human being is not an object, even when treated as
one. In this instance, millions of human beings were treated as
commodities. To obtain them, products were shipped to Africa; by their
labor power, wealth was created in the Americas. The wealth they created
mostly returned to Britain; the products they made were consumed in
Britain; and the products made by Britons—cloth, tools, torture
instruments—were consumed by slaves who were themselves consumed in the
creation of wealth.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century, English society was very slowly evolving
toward a system of free labor, by which I mean the creation of a labor
force that, lacking any access to productive property such as land,
would have to sell its labor to the owners of the means of production.
Yet in that same century, England was adapting a system of mostly
coerced labor in her colonies to satisfy her needs there. These two
radically different patterns of labor exaction were growing in two
ecologically different settings and were critically different in form.
Yet they served the same overarching economic goals, and were
created—albeit in such different form—by the evolution of a single
economic and political system.</p>
<p>So much has been written of the rise of British Caribbean sugar that
no brief summary would be satisfactory. But enough should be said, at
least, so that the qualitative changes that mark the differences between
the Spanish plantation experiments of the late sixteenth century and the
English achievements of the mid-seventeenth and eighteenth centuries can
be grasped. Those differences have to do with changes in the scale not
only of plantation operations, but also of the market. As we have seen,
England’s entry into the plantation production of sugar in its colonies
first served to supply the domestic (British) consumers’ market, but
meant competing for the growing European market as well. After
outselling the Portuguese (and later the French) on the Continent in the
1680s, the English soon relinquished the Continental market again, the
better to supply their own growing needs. “After 1660, England’s sugar
imports always exceeded its combined imports of all other colonial
produce.”50 These changes were paralleled by a steady expansion of
plantation production, with more plantations in mature colonies, and
added new colonies as well; and by a growing differentiation of the
products themselves—first sugar and molasses; soon after, rum; then a
multiplication of crystalline sugar varieties and of syrup
types—redifferentiations that were accompanied by (or, better, responded
to) more elaborate and heterogeneous consumer demand at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the fates of individual sugar colonies (and even of
different sectors of the plantation economy in any one colony) were
anything but predictable. Plantations were highly speculative
enterprises. While they eventuated in enormous profits for fortunate
investors, bankruptcies were common; some of the most daring plantation
entrepreneurs ended their days in debtors’ prison. Sugar was never a
sure thing, despite the unfailingly optimistic predictions of its
protagonists. But the risks taken by individual investors and planters
in particular colonies were counterbalanced, over time, by the unceasing
increases in demand. Those who foresaw the increases included, as
always, both eventual winners and losers. Overall, the British imperial
system was able to gorge itself on an ever-growing demand for sugar that
accompanied both a declining unit price for sugar and increases in
worker productivity at home.</p>
<p>A mass market for sugar emerged rather tardily. Until the eighteenth
century, sugar was really the monopoly of a privileged minority, and its
uses were still primarily as a medicine, as a spice, or as a decorative
(display) substance. “An entirely new taste for sweetness manifested
itself,” Davis declares, “as soon as the means to satisfy it became
available . . . by 1750 the poorest English farm labourer’s wife took
sugar in her tea.”51 From the mid-eighteenth century onward, sugar
production in the imperial economy became more and more important to
England’s rulers and ruling classes. This is only an apparent
contradiction. As the production of sugar became significant
economically, so that it could affect political and military (as well as
economic) decisions, its consumption by the powerful came to matter
less; at the same time, the production of sugar acquired that importance
precisely because the masses of English people were now steadily
consuming more of it, and desiring more of it than they could
afford.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, as the quantities of sugar consumed rose, the loci
of production came into ever-closer alignment with the domestic British
economy. Thus, for instance, until nearly the middle of the sixteenth
century, sugar refining was carried on mainly in the Low Countries,
especially in Antwerp, before it was sacked at the order of Philip II
(1576). From 1544, England began refining her own sugar; “after 1585,
London was the important refining center for the European trade.”52 The
same shift occurred in shipping. The first documented shipload of sugar
sent directly to England was in 1319. In 1551, however, Captain Thomas
Wyndham, merchant-adventurer on the west African coast, returned to
England from Agadir, Morocco, with a cargo of sugar, “perhaps being the
first to be brought to England in an English ship without break of cargo
and direct from country of origin.”53 By 1675, four hundred English
vessels with average 150-ton cargoes were carrying sugar to England; at
that time, as much as half was being re-exported.</p>
<p>Eventually the mercantilist viewpoint embodied in the imperial sugar
trade was crushed by an aggressive new economic philosophy labeled “free
trade.” But the importance of the mercantilist dogma to Britain’s
development was at least threefold: it guaranteed her supply of sugar
(and other tropical commodities) and the profits made from processing
and re-exporting them; it secured a large overseas market for finished
British goods; and it supported the growth of the civil (and military)
marine. Buy no finished goods elsewhere, sell none of your (tropical)
products elsewhere, ship everything in British bottoms: during nearly
two centuries these injunctions, only slightly less sacred than Holy
Writ, bound planters and refiners, merchantmen and dreadnaughts,
Jamaican slave and Liverpudlian stevedore, monarch and citizen
together.</p>
<p>But mercantilist injunctions did not always serve the same classes.
If at one point mercantilism protected the planters’ market from foreign
sugar producers, at another it protected the factory owners from the
foreign producers of finished goods. Overall, however, the two hundred
years during which mercantilism persisted were marked by a gradual
decline in the position of the planter classes, after their swift and
early rise to power within the national state—and a more or less steady
improvement in the position of the industrial capitalists and their
interests at home. Mercantilism was finally dealt its quietus in the
mid-nineteenth century, and the sugar market and its potential played a
part. By then, sugar and consumer items like it had become too important
to permit an archaic protectionism to jeopardize future metropolitan
supplies. Sugar surrendered its place as luxury and rarity and became
the first mass-produced exotic necessity of a proletarian working
class.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Before turning to the last period in the history of sugar production,
it might be useful to look more intently at the plantations, those
tropical enterprises that were the seats of sugar production. These
were, of course, agricultural undertakings, but because so much of the
industrial processing of the cane was also carried out on the
plantations, it makes good sense to view the plantations as a synthesis
of field and factory. Thus approached, they were really quite unlike
anything known in mainland Europe at the time.</p>
<p>We have already observed that sugar cane must be cut when it is ripe,
and ground as soon as it is cut. These simple facts give a special
character to any enterprise dedicated to the production of sugar, as
opposed to the simple expression of cane juice. The history of sugar
making and refining has been one of irregular improvement of the level
of chemical purity, with many consumers (in different cultures, and in
different historical periods) developing preferences for one or another
degree of purity, color, form, granule size, and so on. But without
boiling and skimming and reducing juice there is no way to make granular
sugar. It cannot be done without solid technical mastery, particularly
in the control of heat. Just as factory and field are wedded in sugar
making, brute field labor and skilled artisanal knowledge are both
necessary.</p>
<p>The early Spanish plantations of Santo Domingo probably consisted of
about 125 acres of land, manned by as many as two hundred slaves and
freemen. The needed technical skills were imported, principally from the
Canaries. Perhaps only a tenth of the labor force was required in the
mill and the boiling house, but their operations and those of the
cutting crews had to be coordinated, while the field labor had to be
divided not only seasonally but also between the cane and the
subsistence crops. The specialization by skill and jobs, and the
division of labor by age, gender, and condition into crews, shifts, and
“gangs,” together with the stress upon punctuality and discipline, are
features associated more with industry than with agriculture—at least in
the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Most like a factory was the boiling house, where the juice from the
crushed cane was transferred for reduction, clarification, and
crystallization. The Barbadian colonist Thomas Tryon—whose complaints
must be viewed with some skepticism, since he was a planter
himself—nonetheless conveys well the modern-sounding quality of the mill
in this seventeenth-century description:</p>
<p>In short, ’tis to live in a perpetual Noise and Hurry, and the only
way to render a person Angry, and Tyrannical, too; since the Climate is
so hot, and the labor so constant, that the Servants [or slaves] night
and day stand in great Boyling Houses, where there are Six or Seven
large Coppers or Furnaces kept perpetually Boyling; and from which with
heavy Ladles and Scummers they Skim off the excrementitious parts of the
Canes, till it comes to its perfection and cleanness, while other as
Stoakers, Broil as it were, alive, in managing the Fires; and one part
is constantly at the Mill, to supply it with Canes, night and day,
during the whole Season of making Sugar, which is about six Months of
the year; so that what with these things, the number of the Family, and
many other Losses and Disappointments of bad Crops, which often happens,
a Master Planter has no such easy life as Some may imagine, nor Riches
flow upon him with that insensibility, as it does upon many in
England.54</p>
<p>One supposes that the riches flowed even less abundantly upon the
slaves and servants.</p>
<p>The seventeenth century was preindustrial; and the idea that there
might have been “industry” on the colonial plantation before it existed
in the homeland may seem heretical. First, it has been conceived of as
predominantly agricultural because it was a colonial enterprise and
manned mostly by coerced, rather than free, labor. Second, it produced a
consumable food—rather than textiles, say, or tools, or some other
machined nonfood. Finally, scholars interested in the history of western
industry quite predictably began with the artisans and craftsmen of
Europe and the putting-out shops that followed them, rather than with
overseas ventures. It followed naturally that plantations were seen as
by-products of European endeavor rather than as an integral part of the
growth from shop to factory. But it is not clear why such preconceptions
should interfere with a recognition of the industrial aspects of
plantation development. It may seem a topsy-turvy view of the West to
find its factories elsewhere at so early a period. But the sugar-cane
plantation is gradually winning recognition as an unusual combination of
agricultural and industrial forms, and I believe it was probably the
closest thing to industry that was typical of the seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>Strangely, historians have also paid insufficient attention to the
scale of plantation enterprises. The planters of the British Caribbean
certainly were large-scale entrepreneurs for their time: a “combination
farmer-manufacturer” with a work force of perhaps a hundred could have
eighty acres put to cane and expect to produce eighty tons of sugar
after the harvest. To make sugar he needed one mill or two, a boiling
house to clean and reduce the juice, a curing house to drain the
molasses and dry the sugar heads, a distillery to make rum, and a
storehouse to hold his raw sugar for shipment—representing an investment
of thousands of pounds sterling.55</p>
<p>The subtropical environments of the plantation required planters to
adjust to seasonal schedules wholly different from those of temperate
climes. Sugar crops needed up to a year and a half to mature, so that
planting and harvesting schedules were elaborate and novel for
Englishmen. On Barbados, English planters soon divided their lands into
equal portions of about ten acres each so that they could be planted and
harvested seriatim, assuring a steady flow of cane to the mill.</p>
<p>Boiling and “striking”—transferring the liquid, and arresting its
boiling when it was ready—required great skill, and sugar boilers were
artisans who worked under difficult conditions. The heat and noise were
overpowering, there was considerable danger involved, and time was of
the essence throughout, from the moment when the cane was perfect for
cutting until the semicrystalline product was poured into molds to drain
and be dried. During the harvest the mills operated unceasingly, and the
labor requirements were horrendous. Writing of the eighteenth-century
picture, Mathieson tells us, “The production of sugar was the most
onerous of West Indian industries.”56 From the first of the year until
about the end of May, cane cutting, grinding, boiling, and potting were
conducted simultaneously. Weather was a continuing concern—fear of
droughts at the outset of the cutting season, when lack of rain reduced
the sugar (or liquid) content of the cane, fear of heavy rain toward
late spring, which could rot cane in the ground or immediately on
cutting. But the work pressure also came from the somewhat misleading
idea that sugar syrup, once boiling, should not be permitted to cool
until “struck.” The only break in the work week was from Saturday night
till Monday morning. Otherwise, the twenty-five men and women in the
factory worked continuously in shifts lasting all day and part of the
night, or the whole of every second or third night:</p>
<p>So rapid was the motion of the mill, and so rapid also the combustion
of the dried canes or “trash” used as fuel in the boiling house that the
work of the millers and firemen, though light enough in itself, was
exhausting. A French writer described as “prodigious” the galloping of
the mules attached to the sweeps of the mill; but “still more
surprising” in his opinion was the ceaseless celerity with which the
firemen kept up a full blaze of cane-trash. Those who fed the mill were
liable, especially when tired or half-asleep, to have their fingers
caught between the rollers. A hatchet was kept in readiness to sever the
arm, which in such cases was always drawn in; and this no doubt explains
the number of maimed watchmen. The negroes employed as boilermen had a
less exacting, but a heavier task. Standing barefoot for hours on the
stones or hard ground and without seats for their intermissions of duty,
they frequently developed “disorders of the legs.” The ladle suspended
on a pole which transferred the sugar from one cauldron to another was
“in itself particularly heavy”; and, as the strainers were placed at a
considerable height above the cauldrons, it had to be raised as well as
swung.57</p>
<p>The relationship between the cultivation of cane and its
mechanical/chemical transformation into sugar—the final steps of which
have never been commonly undertaken in the tropical zone, where the
plant itself is grown—springs from the inherent perishability of the
crop. Because of the links between cutting and grinding, and between
boiling and crystallization, land and mill must be coordinated, their
labor synchronized. A major consequence is that sugar-cane plantations
have not usually been divided upon inheritance, since their value
(except under special conditions of change) depends upon keeping intact
the land-and-factory combination. But other consequences have been
careful scheduling at the top, and the application of iron discipline at
the base. Without overall control of land and mill, such scheduling and
discipline would not have been possible.</p>
<p>It is in terms like these that one can see that the sugar-cane
plantation, very early in its career as a form of productive
organization, was an industrial enterprise. When it is remembered that
the plantation form probably first developed in the eastern
Mediterranean, was perfected (mostly with enslaved labor) by the
Crusaders after 1000, was transferred to (and in part, perhaps,
reinvented on) the Atlantic islands by 1450, and was thereupon
re-established in the New World colonies, the significance of their
industrialism—at a time when industry itself was largely based on home
labor, except for shipbuilding and some textiles in Europe
itself—becomes more persuasive. Since cane growing and even sugar making
were, at least until the nineteenth century, activities in which
mechanical force was only an imperfect and incomplete substitute for
manual labor, “industry” may seem a questionable descriptive term. Also,
most plantation development was based on coerced labor of various sorts,
which likewise seems to run counter to our ideas of industry. We are
inclined instead to think of industry in postfeudal Europe, replacing
the guild system and the artisan by the factory and by a free but
unskilled labor force, divested of its tools and mass-producing
commodities previously produced by hand.</p>
<p>All the more reason to specify what is meant by “industry” here.
Today we speak of “agro-industry,” and the term usually implies heavy
substitution of machinery for human labor, mass production on large
holdings, intensive use of scientific methods and products (fertilizer,
herbicides, the breeding of hybrid varieties, irrigation), and the like.
What made the early plantation system agro-industrial was the
combination of agriculture and processing under one authority:
discipline was probably its first essential feature. This was because
neither mill nor field could be separately (independently) productive.
Second was the organization of the labor force itself, part skilled,
part unskilled, and organized in terms of the plantation’s overall
productive goals. To the extent possible, the labor force was composed
of interchangeable units—much of the labor was homogeneous, in the eyes
of the producers—characteristic of a lengthy middle period much later in
the history of capitalism. Third, the system was time-conscious. This
time-consciousness was dictated by the nature of the sugar cane and its
processing requirements, but it permeated all phases of plantation life
and accorded well with the emphasis on time that was later to become a
central feature of capitalist industry. The combination of field and
factory, of skilled workers with unskilled, and the strictness of
scheduling together gave an industrial cast to plantation enterprises,
even though the use of coercion to exact labor might have seemed
somewhat unfamiliar to latter-day capitalists.58</p>
<p>There were at least two other regards in which these plantation
enterprises were industrial: the separation of production from
consumption, and the separation of the worker from his tools. Such
features help us to define the lives of the working people, mostly
unfree, who powered plantation enterprises between the sixteenth and the
late nineteenth centuries in the New World. They call our attention to
the remarkably early functioning of industry in European history
(overseas colonial history, at that). They throw rather provocative
light on the common assertion that Europe “developed” the colonial world
after the European heartland. They also afford us an idea of the life of
plantation laborers, to contrast with that of European agricultural
workers and peasants of the same era.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Near the mid-seventeenth century, when British and French colonists
first considered producing sugar in the Caribbean, the European market
for tobacco had become saturated, and the price for this curious,
addictive new commodity had fallen sharply. The colonists were, for the
most part, small-scale cultivators of limited means. Many of them
employed on their farms freshly arrived settlers from the mother
countries who were contracted to labor for a fixed period of years.
These workers were debt servants, petty criminals, political and
religious nonconformists, labor organizers, Irish
revolutionaries—political prisoners of different sorts. Many were simply
kidnapped; to “barbadoes” someone became a seventeenth-century verb for
stealing humans.59 Both Britain and France used this system to rid
themselves of “undesirables,” in a period when there was more labor than
the domestic economies could absorb.</p>
<p>These contracted English laborers, called indentured servants (in
French engagés), represented a vital contribution to the labor needs of
the colonies, on the mainland as well. At the termination of their
contracts in the islands, such persons were to be given tracts of land
of their own, and by this process, the new colonies would presumably
fill up with settlers over time. But the colonists in places such as
Barbados and Martinique needed more labor than they could readily
obtain. Sometimes they were able to lay hands on some enslaved Native
Americans who might work alongside the contracted Europeans. But soon
enough, the island planters began to acquire enslaved Africans. Hence
the early labor patterns in the so-called sugar islands were mixed,
combining European smallholders, indentured laborers, and African and
Indian slaves.</p>
<p>The shift to sugar production required substantial capital, which, as
I have mentioned, was supplied by Dutch investors, men already familiar
with the cultivation of sugar cane and the manufacture of sugar. In
English Barbados, as the more successful planters bought their
neighbors’ lands and built new mills and boiling and drying houses, the
shift from tobacco to sugar created larger estates. At the same time,
the pattern enabling indentured servants to acquire land at the end of
their terms disappeared. Small farms were replaced by plantations, and
by the late seventeenth century and thereafter, the number of enslaved
Africans rose sharply. Slavery emerged as the preferred form of labor
exaction, even though it required substantial investment in human
“stock.” A young teacher named Downing, writing from Barbados in 1645 as
the plantation system took hold there, recounted that the Barbadians
“have bought this yeare no less than a thousand negroes, and the more
they buie, the more they are able to buie, for in a yeare and a halfe
they will earn with God’s blessing as much as they cost.” The success of
slavery in pioneering islands like Barbados and Martinique marked the
beginning of the Africanization of the British and French Caribbean.
From 1701 to 1810 Barbados, a mere 166 square miles in area, received
252,500 African slaves. Jamaica, which in 1655 had been invaded by the
British, followed the same pattern of “economic development”; in the
same 109 years, it received 662,400 slaves.60</p>
<p>The eighteenth century was the apogee of the British and French
slave-based sugar plantations. The first, Spanish period of Caribbean
plantation history saw a “mixed” form of labor; the second, 1650–1850,
with the Danes, Dutch, English, and French, embraced three quite
different forms of labor exaction, and actually changed before the
exclusively “slave” form ended with emancipation (1838 for the English,
1848 for the French). The third, “contract” form of plantation life in
the Caribbean, which began with a new arrangement using imported labor
to soften the effects of emancipation and to keep labor costs down,
ended by the 1870s; in 1876, slavery ended in Puerto Rico and, in 1884,
in Cuba. Thereafter Caribbean labor (with few exceptions) was entirely
“free.”</p>
<p>From the point of view of the English consumers of commodities like
sugar, such changes were perhaps not of great importance. Yet changing
metropolitan attitudes toward the treatment of labor in the colonies
certainly had an economic coefficient. When slave-based plantations were
evolving on the Caribbean islands, Europe itself was witnessing the
emergence of free proletarian labor, along the very lines Karl Marx
employed in describing capitalism. “We have seen,” he writes, “that the
expropriation of the mass of the people from the soil forms the basis of
the capitalist mode of production.” And “so-called primitive
accumulation . . . is nothing less than the historical process of
divorcing the producer from the means of production.”61 The European
laborers who had been dispossessed by profound social and economic
alterations of their countrysides would eventually become the urban
factory workers—the proletariat—whose emergence so fascinated Marx when
he was writing in the mid-nineteenth century. But in the seventeenth
century that transformation had but barely begun.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the newly acquired Caribbean colonies of Britain
and France, labor was being exacted from massive populations of
similarly dispossessed persons. But they were slaves, not free landless
workers. These displaced and enchatteled Africans, who did not own their
own bodies, let alone their own labor, were being reunited with the
means of production, from which enslavement and transportation had
separated them, but by the lash, rather than through the operation of
the market. The differences between these laboring populations give rise
to odd questions. Were those Caribbean colonies, the planters who ran
them and the slaves who worked them, part of the same system that
embraced the free and dispossessed workers of western Europe? In the
period before factory capitalism had become typical of western Europe,
how do we describe the Caribbean plantations and their mode of
operation? What sort of economic system were they part of, since
capitalism, as it is commonly conceived, had not yet even appeared?</p>
<p>Most students of capitalism (though not all) believe that capitalism
itself became a governing economic form in the late eighteenth century
and not before. But the rise of capitalism involved the destruction of
economic systems that had preceded it—notably, European feudalism—and
the creation of a system of world trade. It also involved the creation
of colonies, the establishment of experimental economic enterprises in
various world areas, and the development of new forms of slave-based
production in the New World, using imported slaves—perhaps Europe’s
biggest single external contribution to its own economic growth. The
Caribbean plantations were a vital part of this process, embodying all
of these features, and providing both important commodities for European
consumption and important markets for European production. As such they
were crucial to profit making for Europe herself, even before
capitalism—in the opinion of most authorities—had emerged there.</p>
<p>The reader may see that this line of argument harks back to my
discussion of the plantation as an early form of industrial
organization, for it, too, stresses a precocious development outside the
European heartland. Both in its labor forms and in its organization,
then, the plantation is an oddity. Yet its existence was predicated on
European intent, and in its own way it became vital to European
development over time. If it was not “capitalistic,” it was still an
important step toward capitalism.</p>
<p>The early sugar planters of Barbados and then Jamaica measured their
worth in the profit their plantations brought them; their plantations
were judged in the same way by their creditors. The owners of these
plantations were usually businessmen, often absentee, and the capital
they invested was commonly borrowed, mostly from metropolitan banks.</p>
<p>These planters were in every way of great financial benefit to
England. The mortgages on their estates, because of the high rate of
interest which they paid for the loan of capital, were a most desirable
investment for English capitalists. Money invested in the plantations,
moreover, was of much more value to the mother country than if it had
been put out at interest at home, for it became a means of retaining
settlers in the colonies who in every way increased the consumption of
English manufactures. One thousand pounds spent by a planter in Jamaica
produced in the end better results and greater advantages to England
than twice that sum expended by the same family in London.62</p>
<p>Though a few students of the imperial economy have concluded that the
West Indian colonies represented a net loss to Britain because of the
costs of protectionism to the consumers, it must be remembered that the
sugar eater’s loss was the sugar planter’s gain—while the duties
enriched the crown, no matter who paid them. At the same time, these
colonies were an enormous market for finished goods. During the
eighteenth century, English combined exports to the North American and
West Indian colonies expanded by 2,300 percent! As Thomas and McCloskey
point out, there is a difference between social and private
profitability:</p>
<p>It is obvious that the colonial plantations and farms were privately
profitable to their owners. The costs of the sugar preferences were
borne by the British consumer and the costs of administration and
protection by the British tax payer. The costs were widely diffused, but
the benefits accrued to a small group of owners who happened to be well
represented in Parliament. British mercantilism during the eighteenth
century was not a consistent national policy designed to maximise the
wealth of Britain; nor was it a preview of the alleged enrichment of
capitalist nations by nineteenth-century empires. It was instead, as
Ralph Davis suggests, a means to provide revenue to the government and a
device to enrich special interest groups. The truth of the matter is
that what was in the interest of the Manchester textile manufacturer or
the Bristol slave trader or the West Indian planter was usually not in
the interest of the British economy as a whole.63</p>
<p>That early prophet of free trade, Adam Smith, understood this well:
“To found a great empire for the sole purpose of raising up a people of
customers, may at first sight appear a project fit only for a nation of
shopkeepers. It is, however, a project altogether unfit for a nation of
shopkeepers; but extremely fit for a nation whose government is
influenced by shopkeepers.”64 But it was the “shop-keepers” who won out,
and sugar was one of their favorite weapons. To understand them, we need
to understand the peculiar appeal of sugar. It then becomes important
both to explain how and why the market for sugar and like commodities
grew at such a pace in the homeland between 1650, when the first “sugar
islands” were acquired, and the mid-nineteenth century; and to describe
a little more fully what this odd colonial agricultural system had to do
with capitalism.</p>
<p>But first some more must be said of the plantation system itself,
grounded as it was in the use of forced labor, even though the stimulus
to its growth originated with far-off European entrepreneurs. Like
proletarians, slaves are separated from the means of production (tools,
land, etc.). But proletarians can exercise some influence over where
they work, how much they work, for whom they work, and what they do with
their wages. Under some conditions, they may even possess a great deal
of influence. Of course, slaves, too, may have some freedom of maneuver,
depending upon the nature of the system they live in. Yet because they
were themselves chattels—property—slaves in the New World during the
period when plantations operated with feverish intensity could exercise
their will only in the interstices of the system. Slaves and forced
laborers, unlike free workers, have nothing to sell, not even their
labor; instead, they have themselves been bought and sold and traded.
Like the proletarians, however, they stand in dramatic contrast to the
serfs of European feudalism, and they are property less.</p>
<p>These two great masses of workers had noticeably different histories,
and the forms of labor exaction they embodied, during most of the
380-year period concerning us here, evolved in different parts of the
world. At the same time, their economic functions in the world trade
system, especially from the mid-seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth
century, were overlapping, even interdependent. The linkage between
Caribbean slaves and European free laborers was a linkage of production
and hence also of consumption, created by the single system of which
they were both parts. Neither group had much to offer productively but
its labor. Both produced; both consumed little of what they produced.
Both were divested of their tools. In the views of some authorities,
they really form one group, differing only in how they fit into the
worldwide division of labor others created for them.65</p>
<p>Putting things this way may oversimplify what was the complex
evolution of a modern world labor force, let alone the diversified
capitalistic economy that both created it and was serviced by it. The
maturing of a plantation system based on slavery in the Caribbean region
came with, and was partly preconditioned on, the development of powerful
commercial and military navies in western Europe. It meant the funneling
of great quantities of commodities (rum, arms, cloth, jewelry, iron)
into Africa for the purchase of slaves—an investment that did nothing
for Africa’s development but only stimulated more slave raiding. It led
to enormous outputs of wealth in the metropolises to garrison the
colonies and to ensure the coercion and control of the slaves. To
maintain the mercantilist premises of the system—that the colonies buy
from and sell to the motherland only, and that trade be carried only in
the motherland’s ships—was expensive for each national system, though of
course certain groups inside each system profited greatly from it, as we
have seen. The creation and consolidation of a colonial, subordinate
plantation economy based on coerced labor stretched over four centuries.
But the system in the colonies changed little, relative to the
tremendous changes in the European centers that had created it.</p>
<p>It is common to describe the period 1650–1750 as one of mercantile,
trading, or commercial expansion, and to treat only the industrial phase
beginning with the late eighteenth century as “real capitalism.”66 But
would this mean that capitalism somehow existed before the capitalist
mode of production? The plantations that supplied Europe with sugar,
tobacco, etc., were presumably noncapitalist, for their labor force was
enslaved, not proletarian. But this way of putting things is not
entirely satisfactory, either, for it leaves us in the uncomfortable
position of being unable to specify what sort of economic order gave
rise to the plantation system.</p>
<p>Banaji, in a stimulating critique, points out that many Marxist
writers, even including some classical figures such as Lenin and
Kautsky, had trouble making sense of modern slave economies and their
place in world economic history.67 Marx himself did not always seem to
know how to fit slave plantations into his picture of capitalism. Of the
West Indian colonies, he wrote that their settlers acted “like people
who, driven by motives of bourgeois production, wanted to produce
commodities. . . .”68 The plantations were enterprises of “commercial
speculation,” in which “a capitalist mode of production exists, if only
in a formal sense. . . . The business in which slaves are used is
conducted by capitalists.”69 Yet elsewhere he wrote, “The fact that we
now not only call the plantation owners in America capitalists, but that
they are capitalists, is based on their existence as anomalies within a
world market based on free labour.”70 Later writers attacking the same
issue showed some of the same uncertainties. Eugene Genovese, for
instance, says at one point that “the slave regime in the British
Caribbean bore the clear stamp of capitalist enterprise,” and that sugar
was grown on “large plantations of a decidedly bourgeois type” operated
by “capitalist slaveholders.”71 But Genovese’s earlier work (dealing, to
be sure, not with West Indian plantation sugar makers but with U.S.
plantation cotton growers) says “the planters were not mere capitalists,
they were pre-capitalist, quasi-aristocratic landowners who had to
adjust their economy and ways of thinking to a capitalist world
market.”72</p>
<p>One might ask what difference it makes whether one calls the
plantation system “capitalistic” or not. The question matters because it
has to do with the ways economic systems grow and change, and with the
chain of causation that leads from one stage of development to another.
I have argued that the plantations were themselves precocious cases of
industrialization. But this does not necessarily mean that the European
economy that gave rise to these plantations was capitalist. As we have
seen, slave labor is so contrary a form of labor power to be associated
with “the capitalist mode of production,” which is always described as
based on free labor, that even Marx himself seems uncertain how to treat
it. Yet there is no question of the importance of plantations to the
metropolitan economies, or of the tremendous economic activity they
stimulated, both by their production and by the market their consumption
needs afforded the metropolis.</p>
<p>In Banaji’s view, plantations were capitalist enterprises, all
right—linked to European centers, fueled by European wealth, returning
some portion of that wealth to metropolitan investors in various forms,
and functioning as centers of “commercial speculation,” in Marx’s words.
Yet the investment they represented took a fairly static form—so much
for land, for slaves, for equipment—that did not significantly vary for
centuries. They generated profit, which could be increased by increasing
the scale of the enterprise—two produce twice as much as one, or
possibly more—but only in very limited fashion by improving the
technology or by raising productivity. Hence they were at once
speculative enterprises and conservative enterprises: one gambled on
making money from sugar production, but the way one produced sugar was
virtually unchanged, including the coercion of the labor force, for
centuries. Of this curious blend of slavery and the expanding world
market for plantation commodities—what the Trinidadian historian Eric
Williams once called a system combining the sins of feudalism with those
of capitalism, and without the virtues of either73—Banaji writes, “This
heterogeneous and, as it appears, disarticulated nature of the slave
plantation generated a series of contradictory images when the early
Marxist tradition, not equipped with the same abundance of material
available today, attempted its first characterizations.”74</p>
<p>My own sense of it is that those “contradictory images” persist. It
is true that much of the wealth invested in the plantation system did
not result in high levels of accumulation, and that for centuries the
relations among land, labor, and technology on the estates did not much
vary. In these ways the plantation system surely differed from
capitalism in its late, productive, and industrial phase. It is also
true that the plantation mode of production before 1850, based as it was
on slave labor, differs greatly from the so-called capitalist mode of
production, the labor power of which is purchased on an impersonal
market, as are the other factors of production, and it would be wrong to
treat the plantation system as “capitalistic” in the same way that the
British factory system of the nineteenth century was capitalistic. Yet
to detach the plantations from the emergent world economy that spawned
them, or to rule out their contribution to the accumulation of capital
in world centers, would be equally mistaken, I believe. Scholars who
demonstrate that the European capital invested in the West Indies might
actually have earned more if invested elsewhere or otherwise—who
conclude that the whole plantation phenomenon ended up losing money for
the English economy, say—are usually ready to admit that this phenomenon
nonetheless made an immense amount of money for some Englishmen, even if
it proved prohibitively expensive for others.75 Nor did that money stop
“working” once it was made. And perhaps that is the principal point.
Early in the seventeenth century, some people in power in Britain became
convinced that commodities like sugar mattered so much to their
well-being that they would politick fiercely for the rights of capital
invested in developing the plantations and all that went with them. If
these people were not capitalists, if the slaves were not proletarians,
if mercantilism rather than a free economy prevailed, if the rate of
accumulation of profit was low and the organic composition of capital
static—if all of these things were true, it also remains true that these
curious agro-industrial enterprises nourished certain capitalist classes
at home as they were becoming more capitalistic. Later we shall see how
they also nourished the emerging proletarian classes, who found sugar
and kindred drug foods profound consolations in the mines and in the
factories.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The English connection between sugar production and sugar consumption
was welded in the seventeenth century, when Britain acquired Barbados,
Jamaica, and other “sugar islands,” vastly expanded her trade in African
slaves, made inroads into the Portuguese domination of the Continental
sugar trade, and first began to build a broad internal consumer market.
That connection, once created, survived most attacks by other classes in
the metropolis, at least until the mid-nineteenth century. Thereafter it
was supplanted by arrangements that could guarantee an abundant but
cheaper supply of the same goods to English consumers, without special
West Indian privileges. The middle of the nineteenth century was a
period of important transition from the so-called protectionism under
the Navigation Acts to so-called free trade. Actually, this transition
began before 1850, and was not wholly accomplished, as far as sugar was
concerned, until the 1870s.</p>
<p>The debates that marked this transition are tangled and difficult to
summarize, because many different motives lay behind the positions taken
by the protagonists. Some were concerned mainly with preventing any
economic encouragement to those foreign colonies where slavery still
obtained, and hence opposed the admission of slave-grown produce into
Britain without penalties. Yet others—the “Manchester School”—were
unconcerned with slavery but wanted the indiscriminate admission of the
cheapest produce to Great Britain at any cost. The West Indian planters,
of course, demanded special-entry privileges for their sugars against
all sugars produced either within or outside the empire, as well as the
right to import contracted labor to the colonies, once slavery ended
(1834–38). It would be foolish to suppose that these and the many other
contending interest groups were prepared to be candid about why they
wanted one or another outcome; the debates over free trade made a
parliamentary high-water mark for disingenuousness. Viscount
Palmerston’s concluding ironies in the 1841 debates on a government
initiative to lower the duties on foreign sugars in order to raise
revenues by encouraging increased consumption of sugar—that is, to push
down the price of sugar for the British consumer to the benefit of the
exchequer—are deliciously revealing:</p>
<p>We say to these Brazilians we can supply you with cotton goods
cheaper than you can buy them elsewhere. Will you buy them? By all
means, say the Brazilians, and we will pay you with our sugar and
coffee. No, say we, your sugar and coffee are produced by slave labour;
we are men of principle and our consciences will not allow us to consume
the product of slave labour. Well, anyone would imagine that the matter
ended there, and we left the Brazilians to consume their own sugar and
coffee. No such thing. We are men of principle, but we are also men of
business, and we try to help the Brazilians out of their difficulty. We
say to them: Close to us and near at hand live some 40,000,000
industrious and thriving Germans, who are not as conscientious as we
are; take your sugar to them; they will buy it from you, and you can pay
us for our cottons with the money you thus receive. But the Brazilians
represent that there will be some difficulty with this. The Germans live
on the other side of the Atlantic; we must send them our sugar in ships;
now our ships are few and ill-fitted to cope with the waters of the
great ocean. Our reply is ready. We have plenty of ships and they are at
your service. It is true that slave-labour sugar would contaminate our
warehouses, but ships are different things. But the Brazilians have
another difficulty. They say the Germans are particular and have a fancy
for refined sugar. It is not easy to refine sugar in Brazil, and these
Germans do not like the trouble of refining it themselves. Again we step
in with an expedient. We will not only carry your sugar but we will
refine it for you too. It is sinful to consume slave-grown sugar, but
there can be no harm in refining it, which in fact is to cleanse it from
part of its original impurity. The Brazilians are at us again. Say they,
we produce a great deal of sugar more than the Germans will buy. Our
goodness is infinite; we ourselves will buy your surplus. It cannot be
consumed at home, because the people of this country are men of
conscience, but we will send it to the West Indies and Australia. The
people who live there are only negroes and colonists, and what right
have they to consciences? And now that you may plague us no more about
these matters, we tell you at once, that, if the price of our own sugar
should rise above a certain value, we will buy more of your slave-grown
sugar and we will eat it ourselves.76</p>
<p>The hottest debates came in the 1840s, as the West Indian planters,
fattened on slavery and protectionism, found themselves unable to
compete in a widening market, while the free-trade advocates at home saw
a chance that the government’s motives and their own might coincide for
a change.</p>
<p>Between 1660—when Barbados was already producing considerable sugar
and Jamaica had fallen into British hands—and 1700, English foreign
trade had been transformed, as woolen cloth was displaced by other
products. A re-export trade, based largely on tropical commodities, had
begun to take over, with 30 percent of imports coming from either the
East or the New World. Such expansion occurred partly because new
sources of supply had been opened up, but also because “vast new sources
of demand were being opened in England and Europe—demand created by a
sudden cheapness when these English plantation goods brought a collapse
in prices which introduced the middle classes and the poor to novel
habits of consumption; demand which, once realized, was not shaken by
subsequent vicissitudes in prices, but continued to grow rapidly
throughout the century.”77 This change was seen perhaps most
dramatically in the case of tobacco. A luxury at the end of the
sixteenth century, in a hundred years it had become “the general solace
of all classes.” The case of sugar was similar:</p>
<p>The development of English production was part of an international
movement which brought prices down. At the beginning of the seventeenth
century Portuguese (i.e., Brazilian) production was already growing fast
and reducing prices sharply and the English West Indian islands, when
they turned to sugar production, had this large established New World
producer to contend with. They came late into the field—Barbados in the
1640s, Jamaica, as a substantial grower, after 1660—and in the early
1660s they were still contending with the Portuguese, even for the
English market. But already their competition had caused a considerable
decline in prices, and prices continued to fall, on the whole, until
about 1685, by which time the English product had driven Brazilian sugar
from the North European as well as from the English market. West Indies
sugar imports to London, negligible before the Civil War, rose from
148,000 cwt. in 1663/ 69 to 371,000 cwt. in 1699/71—and a third of this
latter total was re-exported. The plantation price of sugar reached a
low point in 1685 of 12s. 6d. per cwt.; the retail price was halved
between 1630 and 1680.78</p>
<p>Davis argues convincingly that it was not only the establishment of
English colonies and entrepôts outside Europe that mattered, but the
sudden cheapness of the commodities they dealt in. “In this respect,” he
says, this expansion “bears a striking similarity to the technological
revolution which, getting under way a century later, developed new
consumption habits in English and foreign populations with the cheap
product of the machine.”79 In terms of production, these changes were
only analogous; sugar-producing plantations are not the same as
steam-driven textile mills. But in terms of consumption, they were
homologous, because they made visible, perhaps for the first time in
history, a critical connection between the will to work and the will to
consume. The introduction of growing quantities of consumer goods to
masses of people who had never had them before gave the privileged
classes the opportunity to imagine that such people might respond to the
promise of enlarged consumption with more effort.</p>
<p>Before the diversification of industry had made a substantial impact
on foreign trade, and four generations before technical changes created
an entirely new basis for commercial expansion, the English merchant
class was able to grow rich, to accumulate capital, on middlemen’s
profits and on the growing shipping industry which was needed to carry
cheap sugar and tobacco, pepper and saltpetre on the ocean routes.
Because these sources made their great contribution to English foreign
trade in the century after 1660, and in that century made great demands
on the nation’s capital, perhaps we should look with a little more
favour on those historians of the past who dubbed this century with the
title of “The Commercial Revolution.”80</p>
<p>This so-called Commercial Revolution, which many Marxist writers have
refused to consider fully capitalistic, nonetheless plainly underlay the
events that followed it a century later. For Marx, this was the process
of accumulation that would make capitalism possible:</p>
<p>The different momenta of primitive accumulation distribute themselves
now, more or less in chronological order, particularly over Spain,
Portugal, Holland, France and England. In England at the end of the
seventeenth century, they arrive at a systematical combination,
embracing the colonies, the national debt, the modern mode of taxation,
and the protectionist system. These methods depend in part on brute
force, e.g., the colonial system. But they all employ the power of the
State, the concentrated and organised force of society, to hasten,
hothouse fashion, the process of transformation of the feudal mode of
production into the capitalist mode, and to shorten the transition. . .
.</p>
<p>The veiled slavery of the wage-workers of Europe needed, for its
pedestal, slavery pure and simple in the new world.81</p>
<p>How intimately related to what was to come were the slave-labor
plantations of the New World, producing their shiploads of stimulants,
drugs, and sweeteners for the growing urban populations of Europe, is
suggested by another assertion of Marx:</p>
<p>Freedom and slavery constitute an antagonism. . . . We are not
dealing with the indirect slavery, the slavery of the proletariat [sic],
but with direct slavery, the slavery of the black races in Surinam, in
Brazil, in the Southern States of North America. Direct slavery is as
much the pivot of our industrialism today as machinery, credit, etc.
Without slavery, no cotton; without cotton, no modern industry. Slavery
has given their value to the colonies; the colonies have created world
trade; world trade is the necessary condition of large-scale machine
industry. Before the traffic in Negroes began, the colonies only
supplied the Old World with very few products and made no visible change
in the face of the earth. Thus slavery is an economic category of the
highest importance.82</p>
<p>Hobsbawm has shown how increases in the consumption of sugar and like
commodities were predicated upon a basic structural realignment of
European economic activity. In his view, a lengthy period of economic
contraction in Europe—a “general crisis”—marked the seventeenth century.
This crisis, a last phase of the transition from feudalism to
capitalism, wrecked the earlier Mediterranean and Baltic trade systems,
and they were soon replaced by North Atlantic centers. This shift meant
a fundamental reordering of the flow patterns of world exchange. “The
powerful, growing and accelerating current of overseas trade which swept
the infant industries of Europe with it—which, in fact, sometimes
actually created them—was hardly conceivable without this change.”83
Such a change, Hobsbawm argues, rested on three new conditions: the
growth of an expandable consumers’ market in Europe itself, tied to
changes in production elsewhere; the seizure of colonies abroad for
European “development”; and the creation of colonial enterprises (such
as plantations) to produce consumer goods (and to soak up a substantial
portion of the products of the homeland). As the organization of
European economic activity shifted toward the United Kingdom and away
from both the Mediterranean and the Baltic, the upward spurts in the
production and consumption of tropical commodities like sugar were both
a consequence and a cause of the growing importance of the United
Kingdom in world trade.</p>
<p>By the early eighteenth century, the pioneering overseas economic
expansion of the preceding fifty years began to be reflected in the form
of changes in homeland consumption. To be sure, the consumption of
imported commodities like sugar remained modest by modern (even by
nineteenth-century) standards. But the meanings of sugar in the life of
the British people changed radically. Statistics on British trade
compiled by Elizabeth Boody Schumpeter and interpreted by Richard
Sheridan show that the percentage of imports in the “groceries” category
(tea, coffee, sugar, rice, pepper, etc.), as a fraction of the total
value of imports, more than doubled during the eighteenth century—from
16.9 percent in 1700 to 34.9 percent by 1800:</p>
<p>None of the other eight groups exceeded six per cent of total imports
in 1800. Among grocery items brown sugar and molasses were the most
prominent. They made up, by official value, two-thirds of the group in
1700 and two-fifths in 1800. . . . English sugar consumption probably
increased about four-fold in the last four decades of the next century
[1700–40] and more than doubled again from 1741–45 to 1771–75. If it is
assumed that one-half of the imports were retained in 1663, the
consumption of England and Wales increased about twenty-fold in the
period from 1663 to 1775. The fact that the population increased from 4½
million to only 7½ million in the same period is indicative of a marked
increase in per capita consumption.84</p>
<p>Sugar and related imports (rum, molasses, syrup) were among the
leaders. Indeed, the English economic historian D. C. Coleman believes
per-capita sugar consumption rose more rapidly than bread, meat, and
dairy consumption between 1650 and 1750;85 Deerr estimates British
per-capita annual consumption, 1700–1800, as follows:86</p>
<pre><code>                                                                                                                        1700–1709</code></pre>
<p>4 lbs.</p>
<p>1720–1729</p>
<p>8 lbs.</p>
<p>1780–1789</p>
<p>12 lbs.</p>
<p>1800–1809</p>
<p>18 lbs.</p>
<p>To be sure, eighteen pounds of sugar a year was still not very
much.87 But how much that meager quantity mattered to how many people
was the important thing; it represented more than a 400 percent increase
in one century, and now sugar mattered to many more than before.</p>
<p>The nineteenth century dawned for a population already accustomed to
sugar—if only in small amounts—and eager for more. That century saw the
end of slavery in the British Empire; soon thereafter, protectionism for
sugar began to lose out to free trade. These events occurred only after
pitched battles between different sectors of Britain’s capitalist
classes; and though sugar by itself neither caused nor explains these
battles entirely, its production and consumption were important aspects
of what happened.88 The slave trade to the British colonies ended in
1807; slavery itself was abolished in 1834–38; and the future of the
sugar colonies (hence of sugar production itself) figured in the debates
over both. It was becoming steadily clearer that the closed trade
circuits typical of the previous century were not going to last forever.
Though the Anglo-Caribbean sugar industry continued to supply much of
Britain’s sugar, its dominance shrank, because of many factors: the
perfection of beet-sugar extraction on the Continent as part of
Napoleon’s politics, after the loss of Saint-Domingue, and the spread of
the beet-sugar industry across Europe; the rise of new and competing
intraimperial sugar colonies within the British system, such as
Mauritius (and later Fiji, Natal, and others); and the growing
production of sugar elsewhere, much of it slave-produced (as in Cuba)
and often available at better prices than the sugars of the British West
Indies.</p>
<p>More, perhaps, than any other tropical commodity, sugar became a
signal of the struggles among different sectors of British capitalism,
and a symbol of the dangers of a doomed commercial exclusivism. The West
Indian colonies continued to be subject to the metropolis, and their
populations were still compelled to provide labor to the plantations;
but the metropolis soon freed itself to buy sugar when and where it
wished. Whatever archaism the use of slave labor had made for in the
production of sugar, after 1838 it had to be rooted out; otherwise the
industry would be kept alive only by subsidies and immobilized (if
“free”) labor. Eventually the Anglo-Caribbean sugar industry, the oldest
in the empire, had to choose between stagnation and expensive,
large-scale expansion. In most cases, it was not free to choose. As I
have argued elsewhere,</p>
<p>The post-slavery aftermath was, in general, a period of intensified
competition on the world sugar market. Ultimately—that is, in the very
long run—the victors of this rivalry would be the planter groups who
could successfully underwrite and incorporate large-scale technical
improvements. But this is viewed from a very broad perspective. On the
local level—that is, colony by colony—it is true that the planter groups
were substantially united in their hostility to any changes that might
improve the bargaining position of labour. But of course within such
groups there was competition for that labour—and there were differing
capacities to reduce the dependence on that labour by technical advance.
. . . [We] may really have to deal with two intersecting and
chronologically overlapping processes, which take for granted the
internal differentiation of each planter group. One such process is the
struggle to contain and to supplement the labour power of the
“potential” peasantry; the other is the movement toward technical
improvement, based on the pace of technical achievement and on
availabilities of intensified capital inputs.89</p>
<p>On the one hand, the relatively minor technological changes that had
typified the history of the sugar industry for centuries were now
supplanted by important and sweeping alterations. Immense improvements
in grinding capacity, cane varieties, pest-control and cultivation
methods, increasing use of machinery, and revolutionary changes in
transportation eventuated in vast new agro-industrial complexes,
completely different from the smaller enterprises that preceded them.
The Caribbean cane-sugar industry, which had been colonial, industrial,
and export-oriented ever since the Hispanic expansion, was now
unquestionably absorbed into expanding overseas European capitalism.
After the abolition of slavery in Cuba in 1884, all Caribbean sugar was
made by proletarian labor.90</p>
<p>Though some comments have been made about the curious association
between sugar and slavery, little attention has been given to the “labor
problems” created by successive emancipations in the Caribbean region.
Throughout, emancipation (and, in the case of Haiti, revolution) meant a
sharp decrease in sugar production, as those who had been freed sought
to create new ways of life independent of the plantation. As the slaves
were freed (by Denmark in 1848, England in 1834–38, France in 1848,
Netherlands in 1863, Puerto Rico in 1873–76, Cuba in 1884), on the one
hand, competition from imported contracted laborers forced the freedmen
to work harder and for less money; on the other, since access to idle
land and other local resources was shut off, the freedmen were prevented
from developing alternative sources of livelihood. In effect, the
planter classes sought to re-create pre-emancipation conditions—to
replace the discipline of slavery with the discipline of hunger. They
believed they were forced into this position—at least in the British
sugar colonies—by the successive ends of the slave trade, of slavery,
and of protection for their sugars. Naturally, they felt betrayed by
their class equals at home.</p>
<p>But another way to say this would be to argue that sugar consumption,
and the government income it provided, had finally become so important
to British capitalist development that sugar production was no longer
allowed to depend upon the mercantilist-nationalist arrangements that
had formerly controlled it. By removing barriers to “free” trade—in
other words, by making it possible for the world’s cheapest sugars to
reach the widest possible market in Britain—the leading sectors of
British capitalism sold out their planter-capitalist fellows. This was
precisely what the West India interest accused them of doing.</p>
<p>As the world sugar market opened up, labor still needed to be found,
both for the more ancient colonial areas where slavery had now ended
(Jamaica, Trinidad, British Guiana), and for those newer, pioneering
areas (Mauritius, Natal, Fiji) that were now becoming producers. The
political struggle between the metropolitan capitalist classes and the
colonial planters was partly eased by recourse to external but
politically accessible labor pools. In fact, the defeat of protectionism
in the form of differential duties for West Indian sugar was accompanied
by a victory in regard to labor importation—easier regulations, as well
as funds for financing immigration. West Indian sugar was thus
indirectly protected, even if West Indian working people were not. (Some
cynics might see a parallel to events in the United States after the
Civil War.)</p>
<p>At any rate, migrant labor moved within the bounds of empire. A
portion of the contracted Indian labor in the French West Indies, for
instance, came from French India, a portion of the contracted Indian
labor in the British West Indies came from British India, and so on. But
because many of the new sugar-producing areas needed labor as well, not
all the movement was of this sort. During the nineteenth century,
perhaps a hundred million people migrated in the world at large. About
half came from Europe and about half from the “nonwhite” world,
including India. The Europeans moved principally to areas of prior
European settlement outside Europe itself, including Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, South Africa, southern South America, and, especially, the
United States, while the nonwhites moved to other places. As I have
already observed,</p>
<p>Sugar—or rather, the great commodity market which arose demanding
it—has been one of the massive demographic forces in world history.
Because of it, literally millions of enslaved Africans reached the New
World, particularly the American South, the Caribbean and its littorals,
the Guianas and Brazil. This migration was followed by those of East
Indians, both Moslem and Hindu, Javanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and many
other peoples in the nineteenth century. It was sugar that sent East
Indians to Natal and the Orange Free State, sugar that carried them to
Mauritius and Fiji. Sugar brought a dozen different ethnic groups in
staggering succession to Hawaii, and sugar still moves people about the
Caribbean.91</p>
<p>Several factors can be seen here. For one, the link between sweated,
tropical colonial labor and nonwhite labor was preserved, largely
undisturbed by the end of slavery. For another, the relationship between
sugar and the subtropical colonial regions was likewise maintained
(though beet-sugar extraction, important from about the mid-nineteenth
century onward, was a temperate-zone development—marking the first time
that a temperate-zone commodity would make a serious dent in the market
for subtropical and tropical production). The product in question
continued to flow to the metropolises, while the products obtained in
exchange—food, clothing, machinery, and nearly everything else—continued
to flow to the “backward” areas. It can be contended that the “backward”
areas became less backward through their economic dependence on the
developed areas, but this assertion is vulnerable. Most less developed
societies of this sort have been able to industrialize only feebly
(cement, glass bottles, beer, and soft drinks are often their major
“industries”). They continue to import the bulk of their finished goods
and, often, have even increased their importations of food.</p>
<p>Also problematic is the divided migrant flow of the nineteenth
century. The economist Sir W. Arthur Lewis links this two-sided
demographic picture to the relatively lower productivity of tropical
agriculture in the countries of origin of the migrants, when compared
with the agricultural productivity of the temperate lands from which the
white migrants came (Italy, Ireland, Eastern Europe, Germany, etc.).92
Presumably, migrants from the more productive countries would not be
prepared to migrate for promised wages as low as those that could
attract migrants from the less productive countries. But the exclusion
of nonwhites from the temperate world was the clear consequence of
racist policies in such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and
the United States. It is not merely ironical to point out that the white
migrants would soon be eating more sugar, produced by the nonwhite
migrants at lower wages, and producing finished goods at higher wages,
to be consumed by the nonwhite migrants.</p>
<p>So the production of sugar continued to rise, and at a dizzying rate,
even while the loci of production increased in number and dispersion,
techniques of labor coercion became somewhat less naked, and the uses to
which sugars were put in the developed world became steadily more
differentiated. The upward climb of both production and consumption
within the British Empire must be seen as part of an even larger general
movement. Figures for world sugar production before the mid-nineteenth
century are unreliable, and there is no way of judging the quantities of
sugars produced and consumed without reaching the market. Thus we know
that sugar consumption in the old sugar colonies like Jamaica was always
very substantial—indeed, that slaves were given sugar, molasses, and
even rum during the slavery period as part of their rations. In
countries like India, the ancient hearth of sugar making, and Russia
(the Soviet Union), where beet-sugar production was established within a
decade of its achievement in western Europe, our knowledge of quantities
produced and consumed is uncertain. But even if we limit ourselves to
what can be confidently estimated, the figures on world production and
consumption of sugar during the past two centuries or so are still quite
astounding.</p>
<p>In 1800—by which time, as we have seen, British consumption had
probably increased some 2,500 percent in 150 years—perhaps 245,000 tons
of sugar reached consumers through the world market. Nearly all of those
consumers were Europeans. By 1830, before beet sugar had begun to reach
the world market, total production had risen to 572,000 tons, an
increase of more than 233 percent in thirty years. Another thirty years
later, in 1860, by which time beet-sugar production was growing rapidly,
total world production of sucrose (both beet and cane) stood at an
estimated 1.373 million tons, or another increase of more than 233
percent. By 1890, world production exceeded six million tons,
representing a percentage increase of nearly 500 over that of thirty
years earlier. It is not surprising that Dr. John (Lord Boyd) Orr should
have concluded, looking back at the nineteenth century, that the single
most important nutritional datum on the British people was their
fivefold increase in sugar consumption.93</p>
<p>The actual details of consumption are, of course, much more complex.
But for the present, it may be enough to say that probably no other food
in world history has had a comparable performance. Why this should be so
is not, however, a simple question. To get some sense of how sugar
gained its place in the English diet, it will be necessary to turn back
again to the beginning of the story.</p>
