<h4 id="power">4 ♦ Power</h4>
<p>Over the course of less than two centuries, a nation most of whose
citizens formerly subsisted almost exclusively on foods produced within
its borders had become a prodigious consumer of imported goods. Usually
these foods were new to those who consumed them, supplanting more
familiar items, or they were novelties, gradually transformed from
exotic treats into ordinary, everyday consumables. As these changes took
place, the foods acquired new meanings, but those meanings—what the
foods meant to people, and what people signaled by consuming them—were
associated with social differences of all sorts, including those of age,
gender, class, and occupation. They were also related to the will and
intent of the nation’s rulers, and to the economic, social, and
political destiny of the nation itself.</p>
<p>There are plainly two different senses of the term “meaning” here.
One refers to what might be called “inside” kinds of meaning—inside the
rituals and schedules of the group, inside the meal or eating event,
inside the social group itself—the meanings people indicate when they
are demonstrating they know what things are supposed to mean. Thus, for
example, hospitality “means” self-respect; self-respect “means” knowing
one’s place in the class system; and knowing one’s place can “mean”
offering appropriate forms of hospitality—greeting, inviting in, serving
tea and sugar and treacle tarts, or whatever. At births and weddings,
funerals and feast days, moments of repose from the day’s work following
the calendar of hours, days, weeks, months, and the lifetime itself, new
forms of consumption might be grafted to older forms with similar or
analogous meanings.</p>
<p>I have already suggested the two processes by which inside meanings
are acquired and conventionalized. In “intensification,” consumption
replicates that practiced by others, usually of a higher social
status—also imitates, even emulates. The wedding cake and its sculptured
decorations, complete with dragées, congratulatory script, hardened
sugar figures, was more than just a new “food”; consumption was firmly
attached to a special event and ceremonialized as part of it. As the
custom of having a wedding cake percolated down through society, one
would expect the usages to change, because of great differences in means
and circumstances, but since the emulative features of the custom were
undoubtedly also important, this process was “intensification”
nonetheless.</p>
<p>Much consumption behavior toward sugar and its accompaniments seems
to have arisen among the British working classes without any imitation,
especially when the contexts were different from those of the more
privileged classes. Since sugar products became even more important to
the poor than they once had been for the wealthy—as sources of calories
even more than of status—and since the occasions for eating them
multiplied, new uses and meanings arose at a great remove from the
practices of the privileged. To these kinds of innovation the term
“extensification” has been applied.</p>
<p>In both instances, new users appropriate the behavior and inside
meanings they perceive as their own, and new uses and meanings sometimes
appear that are not merely imitative. In “intensification,” those in
power are responsible both for the presence of the new products and, to
a degree, for their meanings; with “extensification,” those in power may
take charge of the availability of the new products, but the new users
inform them with meaning. In the wider historical process that concerns
us—the diffusion of sugar to entire national populations—those who
controlled the society held a commanding position not only in regard to
the availability of sugar, but also in regard to at least some of the
meanings that sugar products acquired.</p>
<p>The other sort of meaning can be grasped when one considers what
consumption, and its proliferated meanings for the participants, can
signify for a society as a whole, and especially for those who rule it;
how those who govern or control the society perpetuate their status and
profit from the intensified diffusion of inside meanings, and of the
consumption which the validations of these meanings entail. One can see
here that the kind or level of consumption of social groups is not a
God-given constant; and certain beliefs about human character and
potentiality are open to amendment. Conversely, the spread of internal
meanings can be stimulated and manipulated; the simultaneous control of
both the foods themselves and the meanings they are made to connote can
be a means to pacific domination.</p>
<p>The substances and acts to which meanings attach—inside kinds of
meaning—serve to validate social events. Social learning and practice
relate them to one another, and to what they stand for. Rice and rings
have meanings in weddings much as lilies and lighted candles do in
funerals. These are historically acquired—they arise, grow, change, and
die—and they are culture-specific as well as arbitrary, for all are
symbols. They have no universal meaning; they “mean” because they occur
in specific cultural and historical contexts, where their relevant
meanings are already known to the participants. No symbol has a life of
its own, and though it lacks any intrinsic connection with any other
symbol, it may travel together with other symbols through time, each
reinforcing the other by the “signals” its presence creates. Just as the
symbols may be traced back to a past when they were not associated (the
way tea and sugar were once not associated, for instance), so may there
come a time when their substantive associations are dissolved or
invalidated by some change or other (the way tea and its meanings
dropped out of colonial American drinking habits, and were replaced by
coffee).</p>
<p>As for substances like tea, then, events like meals, or ideas and
meanings like hospitality and equality, human intelligence puts them
together into patterns in the course of social acts in specific times
and places, employing certain availabilities and under specific
constraints. Birth and death are universal in the sense that they happen
to all human beings; our capacity to symbolize, to endow anything with
meaning and then to act in terms of that meaning, is similarly universal
and intrinsic to our nature—like learning to walk or to speak (or being
born, or dying). But which materials we link to events and endow with
meaning are unpredictably subject to cultural and historical forces. We
make biological events like birth and death into social events because
we are human; each human group does it in its own way. Large, complex
societies, composed of many overlapping subgroups, usually lack any
single assemblage of social practices by which life is endowed with
meaning; their members differ widely in the way they can live, and in
their historically influenced access to the acts, objects, and persons
through which they validate their knowledge of life’s meaning.</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century England, like its Continental neighbors, was
deeply divided by considerations of birth, wealth, breeding, gender,
occupation, and so on. The practices of consumption in such a society
were deeply differentiated, and reinforced by rules. Hence the ways that
new consumption practices were taken up and by whom, and the ways they
spread to members of other groups, with or without their associated
meanings, suggest how British society itself was organized, and mark the
distribution of power within it.</p>
<p>Before the end of the seventeenth century, while sugar was still a
precious and rare substance, it had little meaning for most English
people, though if they ever got to taste sugar, they doubtless thought
it desirable. The rich and powerful, however, derived an intense
pleasure from their access to sugar—the purchase, display, consumption,
and waste of sucrose in various forms—which involved social validation,
affiliation, and distinction. The blending of sugar with other rare and
precious spices in the preparation of food; the use of sugar as a fruit
preservative; the combination of sugar with crushed pearls or fine gold
in the manufacture of medical “remedies”; the magnificent subtleties
giving concrete expression to temporal and spiritual power—all confirm
what sugar meant, and how sugar use informed meanings, among the
privileged.</p>
<p>This multiplicity of meanings was also revealed in language and in
literature, and linguistic imagery suggested not only the association of
sweet substances with certain sentiments, desires, and moods, but also
the historical replacement, in large measure, of honey by sugar. Honey
imagery was ancient in British, as in classical Greek and Latin,
literature. Both substances were associated with happiness and
well-being, with elevation of mood, and often with sexuality. The
quality of sweetness, so important in the structure of human taste and
preference, was applied to personality, to generous acts, to music, to
poetry. The Indo-European root swād is the ultimate source of both
“sweet” and “persuade”; in contemporary English, “sugared” or “honeyed”
speech has been supplemented by “syrupy tones” and “sweet-talking.”</p>
<p>Chaucer’s references to sugar are scant; they mainly stress its
rarity and preciousness. By Shakespeare’s time, the references have
multiplied, and though they remain concentrated upon rare substances,
the imagery flowing from them is highly diversified. “White-handed
mistress, one sweet word with thee,” says Berowne in Love’s Labour’s
Lost; “Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three,” the Princess puns in
response. Or Touchstone, the clown, teasing Audrey in As You Like It,
tells her that “honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to
sugar.” Northumberland to Bolingbroke, in the wolds of Gloucestershire:
“Your fair discourse hath been as sugar, / Making the hard way sweet and
delectable.” Or, finally, Brabantio, before Othello and the Duke of
Venice: “These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, / Being strong on both
sides, are equivocal.” From the seventeenth century onward—and it may be
worth noting that Shakespeare died nearly half a century before sugar
from Barbados, the first English “sugar island,” began to reach
England—sugar imagery became ever commoner in English literature.
Written usage of this sort mattered most to the literate, of course, but
sugar imagery became an important part of everyday talk as well,
competing with or supplanting honey imagery among the terms of
endearment and affection. This imagery bridges the two very different
“meanings” we have discussed: the inside meanings as sugar became
commoner, and its employment in social settings by even the least
privileged and poorest of Britain’s citizens; and the significance of
sugar for the empire, for the king, and for the classes whose wealth
would be made and secured by the growing productivity of British labor
at home and British enterprise abroad.</p>
<p>This second meaning is embodied in the writings of political
economists like Josiah Child or Dalby Thomas, or physicians like
Frederick Slare, whose enthusiasms kept pace with the steady expansion
of those portions of the empire within which sugar cane and other
plantation crops could be grown. Their encomia were not limited to the
medical, preservative, nutritive, and other proclaimed virtues of sugar.
In fact, they mostly treated the beneficial character of sugar as
self-evident. How trade would follow the flag; why plantation production
befitted the nation, the crown, and—of course—the enslaved and coerced
workers; the general importance of commerce as a stimulus to
manufacturing; the civilizing benefits to the heathen of the British
presence—all these themes were pressed into sugar’s service. And though
sugar was obviously not always and everywhere a moneymaker within the
empire—many an investor, as well as many a planter, ended up a bankrupt
(and sometimes a jailbird) because of it—its cumulative value to crown
and capital alike was enormous.</p>
<p>As far as the British West Indies were concerned, the zenith of
sugar’s imperial role probably came in the late eighteenth century,
during the rule of George III. Lowell Ragatz, historian of the British
West Indian planter class, recounts the story, probably apocryphal, of
George III’s visit to Weymouth in the company of his prime minister.
Irritated by the sight of a West Indian planter’s opulent equipage,
complete with outrider and livery as fine as his own, the king is
reported to have exclaimed: “Sugar, sugar, eh?—all that sugar! How are
the duties, eh, Pitt, how are the duties?”1</p>
<p>The meaning that sugar attained in the imperial economy was a wholly
different matter from what it eventually meant in the lives of the
English people, but the availability and price of sugar were the direct
consequences of imperial policies that took shape partly in terms of
what the market was, and more and more in terms of what it might become.
As the home market was made to grow, the proportion of sugar that was
re-exported dropped sharply, and production itself was levered more
securely into the imperial orbit. And as control over production was
consolidated, consumption at home continued to rise. Much later, when
protectionist policy based on differential duties lost out in Parliament
and the West Indian planters lost their protectionist advocates, sugar
went on being consumed in ever-increasing quantities, even as African
and Asian colonies entered into cane cultivation and sugar making, and
even as beet-sugar production began to overtake cane-sugar production in
the world economy at large. By that time—which is to say, by the
mid-nineteenth century—the two sorts of meaning suggested here had
become united to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The English people came to view sugar as essential; supplying them
with it became as much a political as an economic obligation. At the
same time, the owners of the immense fortunes created by the labor of
millions of slaves stolen from Africa, on millions of acres of the New
World stolen from the Indians—wealth in the form of commodities like
sugar, molasses, and rum to be sold to Africans, Indians, colonials, and
the British working class alike—had become even more solidly attached to
the centers of power in English society at large. Many individual
merchants, planters, and entrepreneurs lost out, but the long-term
economic successes of the new commodity markets at home were never in
doubt after the mid-seventeenth century. What sugar meant, from this
vantage point, was what all such colonial production, trade, and
metropolitan consumption came to mean: the growing strength and solidity
of the empire and of the classes that dictated its policies.</p>
<p>But what most anthropologists have in mind when they think about
meaning is entirely different. To paraphrase Clifford Geertz, human
beings are caught up in webs of signification they themselves have spun.
We are able to perceive and interpret the world only in terms of
pre-existing, culture-specific systems for endowing reality with
meaning. This perspective puts the cognitive order between us and the
world itself—we must think the world to be able to see (classify) it,
rather than the other way round—and it should be persuasive for anyone
who considers culture as the prime defining feature of human
uniqueness.</p>
<p>But if humanity gives meaning to the objective world, with different
sets of meaning for different human groups, one must still ask how this
is done and by whom in any given historical instance. Where does the
locus of meaning reside? For most human beings most of the time, the
meanings believed to inhere in things and in the relationships among
things and acts are not given but, rather, are learned. Most of us, most
of the time, act within plays the lines of which were written long ago,
the images of which require recognition, not invention. To say this is
not to deny individuality or the human capacity to add, transform, and
reject meanings, but it is to insist that the webs of signification that
we as individuals spin are exceedingly small and fine (and mostly
trivial); for the most part they reside within other webs of immense
scale, surpassing single lives in time and space.</p>
<p>It is not at all clear that such webs are single-stranded, or that
the same webs exist for each of us. In complex modern societies such
webs of signification can be imagined more easily than they can be
demonstrated to exist. Our ability to explain their meanings is limited,
because each generality we offer requires that we believe people in a
complex society agree, at least grosso modo, that what something means
is unmistakable. This is sometimes true, but not always. People’s
agreeing on what something is is not the same as their agreeing on what
it means. Even on a quite simple level, this difficulty can be real. We
need to learn that rice “means” fertility, and though that association
may seem commonsensical or “natural” once we learn it, actually it is
neither. If there is any explanation, it is historical. When we pass on
to our children the meanings of what we do, our explanations consist
largely of instructions to do what we learned to do before them. In
societies arranged in groups or divisions or layers, the learned
meanings will differ from one group to another—just as the learned
dialect, say, may differ. The supposed webs of signification ought to be
interpretable in terms of such differences, particularly if some
meanings diffuse from one group to another. Otherwise, the assumption of
a homogeneous web may mask, instead of reveal, how meanings are
generated and transmitted. This is perhaps the point where meaning and
power touch most clearly.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The profound changes in dietary and consumption patterns in
eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe were not random or fortuitous,
but the direct consequences of the same momentum that created a world
economy, shaping the asymmetrical relationships between the metropolitan
centers and their colonies and satellites, and the tremendous productive
and distributive apparatuses, both technical and human, of modern
capitalism. But this is not to say that these changes were intended, or
that their ancillary consequences were well understood. The ways in
which the English became the biggest sugar consumers in the world; the
relationships between the colonial loci of sugar production and the
metropolitan locus of its refining and consumption; the connections
between sugar and slavery and the slave trade; the relation of sugar to
bitter liquid stimulants; the role of the West Indian interest in
protecting the plantation economy and winning special state support for
sugar; the unexpected suitability of sugar for the crown’s desire to
impose duties—these and many other aspects of sugar’s history must not
be thrown together and labeled “causes” or “consequences” as if, once
enumerated, they explained anything by themselves. But it is possible to
point to certain long-term trends the general consequences of which are
readily discerned. The steady and cumulative decline in the relative
price of sugars is clear enough, in spite of occasional short-term
increases. Generally speaking, the demand for sugar, even in thirteenth-
and fourteenth-century England, was substantial, though the price put it
beyond the means of most people. The earliest prices mentioned, for
1264, range from one to two shillings per pound, which would be the
equivalent of at least several pounds sterling today. As the Atlantic
islands came into sugar production at the end of the fifteenth century,
the price in England fell to as low as three or four pence per pound.
Prices rose again at the mid-sixteenth century, probably because of
Henry VIII’s debasement of currency and the influx of New World silver.
But sugar prices did not climb at a rate as high as those for other
“eastern” commodities, even after the fall of Egypt to the Turks (1518);
possibly the Atlantic islands were already supplying much—or most—of
England’s sugar.2 Even in those early centuries, the relative price of
sugar was higher than it had been in the first decade of the
century—while consumption continued to rise. In the view of Ellen Ellis,
the economic crisis engendered by the currency debasement did not force
England’s “merchants and the landholders who were raising sheep, and
selling the wool at a greatly enchanced price, [who] had been the chief
consumers of sugar before,” to “give up their consumption of the good
things in life.”3</p>
<p>In the course of the seventeenth century, the prices of sugar
continued to fall. In 1600, the highest price for fine sugar was two
shillings; in 1685, the price stood at eight pence the pound. The
growing cheapness of sugar is suggested as well by the scale of units in
which it was purchased:</p>
<p>In the earlier times rich people bought it by the pound, or at most
by the loaf, a loaf of sugar being a favorite present to a distinguished
personage. Even such an opulent person as Lord Spencer buys stocks of
sugar by the loaf, though on two occasions, 1613, 1614, the weight of
twenty loaves bought is given. In 1664, it is first bought (and without
the designation of loaves), by the hundredweight at eighty-four
shillings. It is again purchased in the same manner in 1679.4</p>
<p>The increase in sugar production in the mid-seventeenth century was
so headlong that prices of sugar fell—between 1645 and 1680, by 70
percent—with temporarily adverse effects upon Caribbean producers.5 The
consequence of this decline for consumers was equally important: the
number of new users may have risen quite sharply. Sheridan’s estimates,
cited earlier, suggest a fourfold increase in consumption during
1660–1700, followed by a trebling between 1700 and 1740. Indeed,
overproduction of sugar affected the whole Atlantic economy for several
decades. In Amsterdam, the price of raw sugar fell by one-third between
1677 and 1687,6 and in England in 1686, muscovado sugar fell to a price
so low it would not be reached again for nearly two centuries:</p>
<p>The growth of consumption during the seventeenth century may be
partly explained by the cheapening of sugar, first by Brazilian and then
by West Indian supplies; but the demand continued to grow long after the
trend of prices took an upward turn in the 1730s. More than once a brief
collapse of sugar prices seemed to indicate that production was
outrunning demand: at the end of the fifteenth century, when Madeira,
the Canaries and São Thomé were offering supplies to Europe on a new
scale; in the 1680s when the massive growth of West Indian supply gave a
check to the prosperity of the Brazilian plantations; and in the 1720s
when Jamaica and St. Domingue emerged out of the tribulations of war to
enlarge the scale of Caribbean production. But time and again rising
demand came to the rescue, even absorbing without difficulty the
sensational rise of production when Cuba came on to the market in the
1770s; and at the end of the eighteenth century the prospects were
bright enough to cause the opening of production beyond the Americas, in
Mauritius, Java and the Philippines.7</p>
<p>The developments “beyond the Americas” represented the maturation of
world trade in sucrose. Britain, acknowledging the transformation of
sugar into a daily necessity, gradually replaced the protectionism
offered the West Indian planters with a “free market,” thereby assuring
practically unlimited quantities of sucrose—except in times of war—to
her own people. This triumph for “free trade” was bought at some
political cost; just as there were those who profited from the end of
the differential duties, there were others who had benefited from them
for centuries. The advocates of more sugar for more people at cheaper
prices won out.</p>
<p>The nature and scale of sucrose consumption in the United Kingdom had
changed completely by 1850: the popularization of sucrose, barely begun
in 1650, brought some of it into the hands of even the very poor within
a century; then, between 1750 and 1850, it ceased to be a luxury and
became a necessity. The gradual erosion of the discriminatory duties
thereafter, doubtless hastened by the competitive effects of better
beet-sugar manufacture upon the tropical cane-producing areas, tended to
equalize competition among producers, at least within the empire,
meanwhile encouraging foreign producers to vie for the enormous British
market.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say what percentage of the English populace
consumed what percentage of sucrose imported in a given year, or to
indicate in what degree and in what regards consumption increased and
proliferated. But there is no doubt that the quantities imported and
retained during that two-century period when sucrose changed from rarity
to daily ingestible rose steadily; that the increase was comparatively
larger than the population increase; and that by the mid-nineteenth
century the British were eating more sugar than ever before, and were as
sugar-hungry as ever. These were the facts upon which free-trade
advocates based their successful campaigns; they rightly believed they
could count on an elasticity of demand created during the preceding
century of increasing sugar use, even among the very poor. Per-capita
consumption continued to climb upward well into the twentieth century,
leveling off at around 105 pounds per person per year only in the past
decade.</p>
<p>Many (though not all) sucrose-eating populations in the West ate more
and more sugar during the past century (a few reaching averages of
105–15 pounds yearly, or about one-third of a pound per person per day).
In the case of the United Kingdom, the downward movement of prices after
1857 was accompanied by steady increases in consumption. But though
price greatly affected the ability of the English—particularly the
poorer classes—to buy as much sucrose as they wished, it does not
explain why they ate so much of it even when it was relatively costly.
The movement to bring down prices by opening trade pitted two different
segments of the British capitalist classes against each other.
Unsurprisingly, the segment allied with factory capitalism won out.</p>
<p>The political power needed to change the relative positions of
competing sucrose sellers in the imperial market seems—and is—notably
different from the more informal “power” that, at earlier points in
British history, influenced the consumption choices of the emerging
proletariat. One’s choice of what one wants or needs to eat makes sense
only in terms of one’s preferences and aspirations—in terms, that is, of
the social context of consumption. The consumption of products such as
tobacco, tea, and sugar may have been one of the very rare ways in which
British workers of the mid-nineteenth century achieved the fulfillment
of the promises implicit in the political philosophy of a century
earlier. Particularly for the working poor, eating more and more food
with substantial amounts of sucrose in it was an appropriate response to
what British society had become.</p>
<p>The theory of mercantilism—to the extent that one can reify a point
of view that only occasionally coalesced into firm and unified
policy—held that “demand” was a constant for any people or country.
Markets did not grow; they reached an equilibrium. The political
economist Charles Davenant put it this way: “For there is a limited
stock of our own product to carry out, beyond which there is no passing:
as for example, there is such a quantity of woollen manufactures, lead,
tin, etc, which over and above our own consumption, we can export
abroad, and our soil as it is now peopled, will not yield much more; and
there is likewise a limited quantity of these goods which foreign
consumption will not exceed.”8</p>
<p>The received wisdom was that lowered prices could only mean lowered
profits, without any compensation in the form of increased sales. So
firmly did people believe in static markets that “the adoption by common
people of dress and consumption habits previously confined to the rich,
was received as a symptom of moral economic disorder. Such consumer
behavior would drain the state of its treasure at the same time that it
undermined God-ordained status distinctions. Sumptuary laws—invariably
futile—continued to be enacted to obstruct the downward diffusion of
upper-class fashions.”9 But in spite of the common view that the poor
neither would nor should consume objects and substances preferred by the
rich even if they could afford them, there were those who wanted to
increase such consumption. Men like Thomas and Slare and Benjamin
Moseley and George Porter, writing at different times and from quite
different perspectives, argued both that demand should be
expanded—indeed, created—by insisting that sugar was good for everyone;
and that none should be deprived of the widespread benefits that would
result from its consumption. From Dalby Thomas on, there were voices in
Great Britain that spoke for the deliberate augmentation of demand,
rather than for its leveling off to fit prior, status-determined
differences.</p>
<p>The Dutch economic historian Jan DeVries argues that two features of
economic life—often attributed to so-called precapitalist or primitive
economies—had to be radically modified to enlarge demand. First, more
families (or wage-earning individuals) had to become involved with the
market, both as producers for sale and as buyers of consumption goods.
Second, the disposition to satisfy only pre-existing levels of
consumption and to work no more than these required—the so-called
backward-sloping supply curve of labor—had to change. Many seventeenth-
and even eighteenth-century theorists thought such a conservative
disposition was natural, inherent to the laborer, and not subject to
modification by outside forces. DeVries cites Sir William Petty, who, in
his Political Arithmetic, written in the 1670s, argued: “It is observed
by Clothiers and others, who employ great numbers of poor people, that
when corn [grain] is extremely plentiful, that the labour of the poor is
proportionately dear: and scarce to be had at all (so licentious are
they who labour only to eat, or rather to drink).”10 This view persisted
in the eighteenth century: “Scarcity, to a certain degree . . . promotes
industry. . . . The manufacturer [i.e., the worker] who can subsist on
three days’ work will be idle and drunken the rest of the week. . . .
The poor in the manufacturing counties will never work any more time
than is necessary just to live and support their weekly
debauches.”11</p>
<p>On the one hand, then, political economists supposed that “ordinary
people” would work only enough to stay alive and not a minute longer; on
the other, they thought that “ordinary people” would indulge themselves
foolishly, seeking to consume substances that, for moral or medical or
other reasons, were simply not good for them or for society. There was a
diversity of opinions, some of which led to support for the expanding
consumption of goods (such as sugar), usually on the grounds of its
being good for the consumers and for the nation; and some to opposition
to such expansion, usually on the grounds of its being physically or
morally bad for the consumers and economically and politically bad for
the nation. Over time, the struggle to increase consumption of any good
on the grounds of the consumer’s rights to his/her own buying power kept
pace with the desire of more “progressive” capitalists to expand the
market or their share of it. In a few cases this was not quite
true—alcoholic beverages, for instance, could interfere with the
efficiency of labor—but it certainly held in the case of tea, sugar, and
like stimulants.</p>
<p>Though DeVries says, “We would credit seventeenth-century merchants
and manufacturers with more imagination and radicalism than they
possessed by saying that they acted to create a social order compatible
with expanding demand,”12 that social order did in fact emerge. Its
effects upon the sugar market were truly sensational, and the reverse
effects, though less important, were no less real.</p>
<p>The period 1600–1750 was one of rapidly increasing urban populations
in northern Europe. The raising of livestock and the production of
fodder displaced much vegetable farming; landless populations were
employed more and more as agrarian wage-earning laborers moved into the
growing cities. The cumulative effect was a greater dependence on the
market on the part of more and more people, even for items of daily
consumption such as bread and beer, and, soon enough, tobacco and sugar
and tea. The concomitant growth of government taxation—taxation of a
regressive sort, falling disproportionately upon those least able to
pay—may have somewhat constrained consumer demand. But it also tended to
force up domestic production for the market, to provide the wherewithal
for payment—that is, local producers tried to produce more, so as to
maintain their own buying power. One change, essential to my argument,
was that proletarian work schedules were transformed by structural
changes in the national economy, and created for the laboring classes
new tasting opportunities and new occasions for eating and drinking.</p>
<p>This did not happen overnight. Nor, for that matter, did majority
opinion encourage a mass market for sugar. Even after royalty and the
planters’ friends in Parliament had discovered that plantation products
were eminently taxable, as well as edible, the better part of another
century would pass before sugar protagonists based their argument firmly
on the possibilities for enlarging consumption among the working poor.
It was then that they became, in effect, the political enemies of the
West Indian planters, by putting cheap sugar ahead of colonial
preference.</p>
<p>The eminent British historian Eric Hobsbawm points out: “Neither
economic theory nor the economic practice of the early Industrial
Revolution relied on the purchasing power of the labouring population,
whose wages, it was generally assumed, would not be far removed from the
subsistence level.”</p>
<p>When by any chance some section of them earned enough to spend their
money on the same sorts of goods as their “betters” (as happened from
time to time during economic booms), middle-class opinion deplored or
ridiculed such presumptuous lack of thrift. The economic advantages of
high wages, whether as incentives to higher productivity or as additions
to purchasing-power, were not discovered until after the middle of the
[nineteenth] century, and then only by a minority of advanced and
enlightened employers.13</p>
<p>All the same, the political fights that eventuated in the end of the
preferential duties for West Indian sugars were an important step in
unleashing proletarian buying power. Cheaper sugar came at a time when
its increased consumption was guaranteed not by the sugar habit itself,
but by the factory world and machine rhythms which were the background
for its use. It was not just that labor worked harder in order to get
more; those who paid its wages profited both from labor’s higher
productivity and from its heightened use of store-purchased
commodities.14</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Few concepts in the social sciences have caused as many disagreements
as the concept of power, and no satisfactory consensus on its definition
has emerged. But there is no way to avoid the term—or one like it—when
the objective is to clarify under what conditions the population of a
entire country changes its behavior radically without the compulsion of
open force and violence. Of course it is possible to interpret such a
change as no more than the expression of will, of free choice—in the
case of sugar, in obtaining a desired good previously not available. But
this requires us to assume that each and every Briton, day by day and
year by year, chose individually to seek and consume sucrose and other
new and expensive products with which it was associated, until the
United Kingdom was somehow transformed into a nation of sucrose eaters.
To omit the concept of power is to treat as indifferent the social,
economic, and political forces that benefited from the steady spread of
demand for sugar. It asks an unjustified ingenuousness of us.</p>
<p>The history of sugar suggests strongly that the availability, and
also the circumstances of availability, of sucrose—which became one of
the most desired of all edible commodities in the empire—were determined
by forces outside the reach of the English masses themselves. There had
been a time, after all, when no one in England knew of sugar, followed
by a period, centuries long, when it was a costly rarity. Only after
around 1650 did sugar become important to England’s ruling strata, so
that more and more of it was imported: mounting economic—and, soon
enough, political—forces supported the seizure of colonies where cane
could be grown and raw sugar manufactured, as well as the slave trade
that supplied the needed labor. The proportion of imported sugar
consumed in Britain increased and the price fell. Even though the buying
power of those who came to like sucrose was limited, consumption rose
steadily; more and more people consumed more and more sugar. The uses to
which it was put and its place in the diet changed and proliferated; it
grew more important in people’s consciousness, in family budgets, and in
the economic, social, and political life of the nation.</p>
<p>These changes have to do with “outside” meaning—the place of sucrose
in the history of colonies, commerce, political intrigue, the making of
policy and law—but they have to do with “inside” meaning as well,
because the meanings people gave to sugar arose under conditions
prescribed or determined not so much by the consumers as by those who
made the product available. Before the rich and powerful who first ate
sugar in England could give it new meanings, they had to have it. Then
its uses changed as it became more common and familiar. We can assume
that some meanings, conveyed by the forms of use, were freshly invented,
others synthesized with what was learned from elsewhere.</p>
<p>After 1650 sugar prices decline and quantities increase; many more
people get to taste it, mostly in conjunction with tea (or one of the
other new beverages). The downward spread is slow and halting but
continuous; some time before 1700, the pace quickens. For the new users,
as we have seen, sugar comes to play a very different part in diet. On
many sides there is ample evidence of a real push to seize more
colonies, establish more plantations, import more slaves to them, build
more ships, import more sucrose and other plantation products. And as
these substances come within reach of the poor, the possibility of a
steadily expanding domestic (national) market, as opposed to an export
market, becomes clearer.</p>
<p>That genuine attempts were made to increase sugar consumption is
hardly in doubt, even though many railed against these strange new
products. Of course consumers must have wanted to consume sugar, and
demonstrated as much by forgoing other consumption opportunities in
order to have it. But one must go on to note the emergence of different
groups within British society that came to benefit from the
production—and consumption—of this new product.</p>
<p>When it was first produced in the West Indies, sugar easily won the
attention and interest of Englishmen. Not only was it already prized as
a luxury good by the nobility and the wealthy, but it soon appeared to
be a promising (if risky) form of investment. The slave trade, shipping,
the plantations themselves, the provision of credit against which
plantations and stocks of slaves and sugar could be collateral, and,
soon enough, opportunities for retailing and refining—all seemed to
offer rewards to the rich and daring. But not only to the rich. The
brilliant Trinidadian historian Eric Williams, in his pathbreaking study
of the slave trade and sugar, points out that though the Liverpool trade
oligopoly rested in the hands of only ten or so firms, many slavers were
financed by a highly democratic pooling of the modest resources of
“attorneys, drapers, grocers, barbers and tailors. The shares in the
ventures were subdivided, one having one-eighth, another one-fifteenth,
a third one thirty-second part of a share and so on.”15 “The little
fellows” had no comparable opportunity to invest in plantations,
however: whereas investment shares at home could be aggregated into
slaving ships and banks, plantations were almost always run as
individually owned enterprises, and most planters came from families of
at least some means back at home.</p>
<p>But some men of limited means did end up rich planters. Richard
Pares’s magnificent A West-India Fortune (1950), which details the
career of the sugar-cane-planting Pinneys of Nevis, reveals that Azariah
Pinney, the founder of the family fortune, was sent dry goods by his
father and siblings, from the sale of which he was able eventually to
acquire a small plantation, around which the Pinney riches subsequently
grew. Pares, who probably knew as much about the evolution of the
British West Indian planter classes as anyone ever has, shows us no
rags-to-riches ambience in the sugar islands, but stresses instead the
importance of familial support at home for younger sons striking out
overseas, and of the value of special skills like bookkeeping,
practicing law, and retailing in enabling even those persons without the
wherewithal eventually to become planters themselves.16 Perhaps the
principal point is that the plantation colonies afforded pioneering
opportunities, as did the slave trade and the derivative trading and
commercial activities the plantation system made possible in the
colonies and at home.</p>
<p>The creditors, both great and petty, who had invested in various
aspects of the sugar economy naturally had a stake in its success. To
these can be added the planters, many of whom came from already rich
families, but who often added to their wealth by their plantation
operations. Their style of life during the maturity of the plantation
era is as famous as was, during certain periods, their political
influence at home. Even as sober and dispassionate a historian as Pares
can write:</p>
<p>Many colonies made no laws at all about the feeding of slaves before
the humanitarians forced them into it at the end of the eighteenth
century; and even where there were laws, the standards which they
enforced were pitiably low. The French code noir stipulated for a supply
of protein which would amount to little more than a kipper a day; and
this code was not at all well observed. Some planters normally gave
their slaves no food at all, but fobbed them off with payments of rum
wherewith to buy food, or with Saturdays and Sundays to till their own
provision grounds and feed themselves. The rum was drunk, the Saturdays
or Sundays encroached upon or wasted, and the slaves starved. Their
masters almost wholly disregarded their needs for protein, and could not
see why they went on hunger-strike, or lost their sleep catching land
crabs, or died. When I think of the colossal banquets of the Barbados
planters, as Ligon describes them, of the money which the West Indians
at home poured out upon the Yorkshire electorate and Harriette Wilson,
of the younger William Beckford’s private orchestra and escapades in
Lisbon, of Fonthill Abbey or even of the Codrington Library, and
remember that the money was got by working African slaves twelve hours a
day on such a diet, I can only feel anger and shame.17</p>
<p>Williams tells us a good deal about these planters in the colonies,
and of their ability to sway Parliament, of which many were members.</p>
<p>Allied with the other great monopolists of the eighteenth century,
the landed aristocracy and the commercial bourgeoisie of the seaport
towns, this powerful West India interest exerted in the unreformed
Parliament an influence sufficient to make every statesman pause, and
represented a solid phalanx “of whose support in emergency every
administration in turn has experienced the value.” They put up a
determined resistance to abolition, emancipation, and the abrogation of
their monopoly. They were always on the warpath to oppose any increase
of the duties on sugar.18</p>
<p>The planters, bankers, slavers, shippers, refiners, grocers, and
people in government whose interests lay along such lines or who
accurately foretold the unfolding fiscal possibilities sugar offered
were among those groups whose power counted in this story. All of these
people exercised power of one sort or another in increasing the
disposition of the crown and Parliament to support and to favor the
extension of the rights of the planters, the maintenance of slavery, the
availability of sugar and its by-products (molasses and rum) to the
people at large. It is to their efforts that England owed the
institutionalization of a rum ration in the navy (begun “unofficially”
after the capture of Jamaica in 1655): half a pint per day from 1731 on.
In the late eighteenth century it was increased to a pint a day for
adult sailors—much-needed creeping socialism for an infant industry. The
official allocations of sugar and treacle to the poorhouses in the late
eighteenth century were similar support measures.</p>
<p>When the protection of the West Indian interests became too expensive
for their erstwhile supporters, who were sensitive to the immense
potentialities of the untapped sugar consumer market at home only
awaiting lower prices, power was applied in different ways. The same had
been true when the abolitionists—opposing first the slave trade, and
later slavery itself—many of them with economic interests radically
different from those of the planters, took stands that the planters saw
as destructive of the plantations. Different interest groups might align
themselves together at one time, but shifting economic fortunes often
pitted such powerful allies against one another. (Citing an observer who
reported in 1764 that fifty or sixty West Indian voters could turn the
balance in the House of Commons any direction they wished, Eric Williams
adds that there was a new combination in the Reformed Parliament that
was just as strong: “It was the Lancashire cotton interest, and its
slogan was not monopoly but laissez faire.”19)</p>
<p>The various blocs, then, were ready to change sides—and often did.
But their seeming fickleness in no way reduced the power they were able
to exercise in critical situations. The political and economic influence
of the governing strata set the terms by which increasing quantities of
sugar and like commodities became available throughout English society.
This influence took the form of specific legislative initiatives
affecting duties and tariffs, or the purchase of supplies of sugar,
molasses, and rum for dispensing through government agencies, like the
navy and the almshouses; or regulations affecting matters of purity,
standards of quality, etc. But it also involved the informal exercise of
power: a combination of official prerogatives with the use of pressures
made possible through cliques, family connections, university and
public-school contacts, covert coercion, friendship, club membership,
the strategic application of wealth, job promises, cajolery, and much
else—most of it familiar to any serious reader of today’s
newspapers.</p>
<p>Such power and its application have to do with “outside” meaning—with
the setting of the terms within which the various forms of sucrose were
made available. But power was also exercised in the shaping of “inside”
meaning.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>In 1685, when the young Edmund Verney went up to Oxford, his father’s
letter to him, detailing the contents of his student trunk, included
mention of oranges, lemons, raisins, and nutmegs—as well as “three
pounds of Brown Sugar, one pound of white poudered sugar made up in
quarters, one pound of Brown sugar candy, one-quarter of a pound of
white sugar candy.”20 Not every young man went to Oxford, and few
parents were so rich and solicitous, yet the “everyday treat” quality of
this list, only thirty years after the conquest of Jamaica, is
telling.</p>
<p>Among countless Britons poorer than the Verneys, the fall in sugar
prices toward the end of that century encouraged the eating of puddings,
among other treats, but also encouraged additional uses of sugar,
transmitted from the boards and kitchens of the wealthy. The suet
puddings Arthur Young describes on the menus at the almshouse at Nacton,
for example, were innovations, institutionalized in the eighteenth
century, fed to the desperately poor. It was of these people that Young
wrote with some impatience:</p>
<p>Pease porridge used to be dinner on the two last days [Friday and
Saturday], but they petitioned for bread and butter instead of it, which
[they] found their favourite dinner, because they have tea to it. I
expressed surprize at this being allowed; but they said they were
permitted to spend 2d. in the shilling of what they earned, as they
please; and they laid it all out in tea and sugar to drink with their
bread and butter dinners.</p>
<p>Indulgence renders it necessary to let them do as they please with
it, but it would be better expended in something else.21</p>
<p>The various uses of sugar eventually acquired many local, particular,
and distinctive meanings, and only exacting regional research will
substantiate this diversification on local and regional levels—funeral
cakes and Christmas pies, puddings and candies, custards and all the
rest. But two kinds of use are involved. Counter-posed to the downward
and outward “intensification” of upper-class usages (and some of their
meanings), there was the largely independent invention of new uses; in
the conjuncture of these two lines of development the relationship of
power to “inside meaning” is revealed.</p>
<p>In the course of everyday life, social groups transmute acts,
substances, and the relationships among them into units of different
meaning. Rituals involving eating, for instance, may be marked by
unusual foods (items otherwise tabooed or those prepared in a
traditional or archaic manner), or by ordinary foods taking on a wholly
different significance because of the ritual context. Examples are
plentiful of both: the Passover seder, the Eucharist, Thanksgiving
turkey, and so on. The custom of marking the end of a time unit
(“week”), or a day of rest, by distinctive food consumption is also
widespread.</p>
<p>In seventeenth- and eighteenth-century England, new and modified
sucrose uses were wedged into ritual and ceremonial contexts at court
and among the rich and powerful. Most such practices were originally
French or Italian and had come to England by way of royal visits, the
settlement of confectioners and sugar sculptors in England, and the
international social reciprocities of the dominant classes. As these
uses of sugar were diffused downward, they were probably simplified, not
only for reasons of economy—the differentials in wealth were of course
staggering—but also because for the vast mass of people they could not
involve comparable validations of status. The unusual combinations of
spices and sweets accompanying holiday meats and fowl; the wide variety
of sugared treats for religious holidays; the gifts of sweet foods to
express thanks or to wish well to the ill; the use of sweet drinks and
baked goods at rituals of separation and departure (including
funerals)—these and other such usages provide examples of both
extensification and intensification.</p>
<p>Ceremonies and rituals that underlined or dramatized the exercise of
temporal or secular power and authority drifted down the social ladder
without the force that underlay them and that they had once served to
symbolize. It was the economic ability to consume in that fashion,
rather than the status right, that came to matter. Over time, sugar
proved to be a superb vehicle for just such transformations. By the time
the laboring poor were using sucrose for ceremonial purposes, the
relationships of their consumption behavior to their self-identification
was consistent with the rest of what was happening in English society.
It was possible even for the relatively poor to consume sugar
conspicuously in providing hospitality, meeting ceremonial obligations,
and validating social links, for it was now an inexpensive good that
continued to seem like a luxury, imparting an aura of privilege to those
who served it and to whom it was served.</p>
<p>The practices that turned sugar into something extraordinary,
ceremonial, and especially meaningful (“intensification”), and the more
common transformation of sugar into something ordinary, everyday, and
essential (“extensification”), were surely not perceived as
qualitatively different, or even as separate, processes by any social
class. But distinguishing between them has some utility here, for it can
throw light upon the controlling groups in English society. Because
sugar was new for most people, it acquired its meanings within English
life during a downward spread from the dominant classes, whose norms
provided certain models.</p>
<p>Substances like tea, sugar, rum, and tobacco were used by working
people in accord with the tempos of working-class life. Those centuries
when England was transformed, albeit irregularly and unevenly, from a
predominantly rural, agrarian, and precapitalist society were centuries
of novelty in consumption. Sugar was taken up just as work schedules
were quickening, as the movement from countryside to city was
accelerating, and as the factory system was taking shape and spreading.
Such changes more and more affected the patterning of eating habits. We
have already seen how hot liquid stimulants sweetened with calorie-laden
sugar, and tobacco, among other novelties, transformed meals and even
the definition of the meal, while economic changes transformed the
schedules of eating.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the ideas of meaning and power touch. Surely
none of the sugar touts of the seventeenth century foresaw the nation of
sucrose eaters their England was soon to become, yet they, and the
classes they endorsed, ensured the steady growth of a society ever
richer in sugar, and enriched by the slave trade, the plantation system,
slavery itself, and, soon enough, the spread of factory industry in the
metropolis. As the exemplar of luxuries turned into affordable
proletarian goodies by dint of individual effort, sucrose was one of the
people’s opiates, and its consumption was a symbolic demonstration that
the system that produced it was successful.</p>
<p>In the mid-nineteenth century one of the most able protagonists of
the equalization of duties—a fight waged to get cheaper sugar onto the
British market—was George R. Porter, himself a broker in sugar and a
shrewd observer of English eating habits. “Without being one of the
absolute necessities of life,” he wrote in 1851, “long habit has in this
country led almost every class to the daily use of it, so that there is
no people in Europe by whom it is consumed to anything like the same
extent.”22 Porter argued against sugar duties by asserting that the
people of Great Britain were ready to eat much more of it if they could
only afford it, and that the duties were a disproportionate and unjust
burden upon the poor. For the rich, he said, sugar was so minor an item
in the family budget in the 1840s that they would buy the same quantity
whether it cost sixpence or a shilling; it was otherwise for the less
fortunate. In order to make his case more persuasive, Porter hazarded
some clever guesses about differential consumption, first establishing
that overall consumption had fallen during those years in the period
1830–49 when the price of sugar rose: “With one exception only, that of
the year 1835, every rise in price has been accompanied by diminished
consumption, while every fall in the market has produced an increased
demand.” He then assumed (on the basis of “inquiries carefully made”)
that rich and middle-rank families, whom he estimated to be perhaps
one-fifth of the national population of Britain, consumed in the 1830s
about forty pounds of sugar per year per person, for all purposes.23
Porter concluded that the annual per-capita consumption of the other
four-fifths of the British population would have been fifteen pounds in
1831, nine pounds in 1840 (when duties were higher), and twenty pounds
in 1849. Against such calculations he put the interesting observation
that every person serving on one of Her Majesty’s ships was allowed one
and one-half ounces per day (or thirty-four pounds per year) by official
issue; while the allowance to aged paupers in government almshouses at
that time was nearly twenty-three pounds per year.</p>
<p>To put it somewhat differently, before the preferential duties
(designed to ease the lot of the West Indian planters and—ostensibly—of
the newly freed West Indian people) were removed and the price of sugar
began to seek its world level, Britain taxed the poor regressively for
their sugar, and hence kept sugar consumption substantially lower among
the poorer classes than it was even among the sailors and paupers who
were its official charges. The West Indian plantations had been
profitable from the first because of the desire for sugar (and like
products) in Europe; as we have seen, English internal demand eventually
overshadowed almost completely the re-export trade. Sugar, then, was a
cornerstone of British West Indian slavery and the slave trade, and the
enslaved Africans who produced the sugar were linked in clear economic
relationships to the British laboring people who were learning to eat
it.</p>
<p>Emancipation was a defeat for the planter classes, but a victory for
those at home who believed in expanded commerce and heightened
consumption. The indemnities paid to the planters (and ostensibly
intended to “protect” the newly freed, as well) were paid by the British
government; but they were more than amply compensated for by the sugar
duties, paid out of all proportion by the poor. When the legislation
supporting those duties began to crumble in 1852 under the attacks of
the free-trade advocates, the disingenuous assertion arose that the
duties protected the West Indian freedmen, but in fact the preferential
duties did not help the freedmen one whit. The duties certainly did
protect the West Indian planters, however, made mechanization of the
sugar industry a less attractive alternative, and kept the price of
sugar in Great Britain elevated.</p>
<p>Throughout the British West Indies, the planters’ “sufferings” after
freedom were resolved, with the connivance of the Foreign Office, by the
importation of contracted laborers from India, China, and elsewhere, and
special legislation to keep freedmen from voting and from acquiring
land. The overall aim was to prevent the newly freed from either
securing a livelihood independent of the sugar industry, or from using
collective bargaining and strikes to negotiate wages and working
conditions, as the proletarians in the metropolis were doing. These
strategies worked; even though the West Indies never again produced so
high a proportion of the sucrose consumed by the United Kingdom, they
remained “sugar islands,” their people doomed to straddle two economic
adaptations—as reconstituted peasants and as rural proletarians—neither
of which could become economically secure. During the two centuries when
enslaved Africans had produced Britain’s sugar in her Caribbean
colonies, they were tied intimately to the emerging factory populations
of the English cities by economic reciprocity and the circumstances of
their emergence. Now free but almost entirely ignored by the metropolis,
the West Indian people became invisible, until their migration to the
center of empire brought them back into uneasy view more than a century
later.</p>
<p>None of this would have been of concern to men like Porter. He was
interested in increasing sugar consumption at home, not in whether the
West Indian planters (and certainly not in whether the West Indian
freedmen) could make a living. He found fault with those who, “without
much consideration, have chosen to identify a high price of sugar with
the happiness of the lately-emancipated slave population of our West
India colonies,” and argued that being free was reward enough for the
ex-slaves.24 It was Porter, and other “free-trade” advocates, who
carried the day. Within two decades, the special protections for West
Indian sugar had all been removed.</p>
<p>As prices fell, new sucrose uses were added on—the development of
marmalades and preserves, condensed milk, chocolate, and sherbet. The
desire of the British working classes for sugar, in the half-century
after the first cracks appeared in the preferential duty system, seemed
insatiable. This certainly involved prior experiences with sugar and the
balance of their diet:</p>
<p>Sugar for a great part of our population is a stimulant, a source of
immediate energy if not inspiration, whether it is turned into alcohol
or whether it is consumed raw. As a matter of fact, the very high
consumption of sugar in some poor families is very closely correlated
with the poverty of their diet in what one might call secondary
satisfactions of diet and in its immediate stimulating faculties. This
is a very important point in sugar consumption, especially when this
includes sweets and “spreads” (on breads) for children. Then there is
this question—what is food or expenditure on food and how far is it a
necessity? The question put in that way perhaps does not mean much, but
I remember a statement—I think it is Bernard Shaw’s “Essay on Rent”—that
you feed your work horses with hay and your hunters with oats. This is
how we treat our human population: we feed our decorative professions on
foods that yield them a great deal of stimulation, a great many
secondary satisfactions, and we feed our lower population with a very
unstimulating and a very poor diet. . . . From the economic point of
view, conventions determine what particular foodstuffs are going to be
bought by any given amount of available income and a great many of these
are pure class conventions.25</p>
<p>Ashby touches here on an aspect of the transformation of English diet
that reverts to the early diffusion of sucrose and stimulant beverages.
Once one has read the encomia to tea and sugar by Slare and Moseley,
together with the Reverend Davies’s indignant remonstrance that the poor
would drink milk or small beer instead of tea if they could afford it,
it would be simplistic to conclude that people ate more sugar after 1850
just because its price declined. Meaning and power touch this time at
the point when a sugar-hungry population had access to
well-nigh-unlimited supplies of sugar—once they were habituated to its
use. That is why production must be linked to consumption, and so-called
inside meanings to the larger, “outside” meanings.</p>
<p>It is a pretty general observation, that those things which give us
most delight, by the free use of them, become hurtful; this cannot be
said of sugar; for as no ill property belongs to it, so nothing
pernicious can possibly attend its use. . . . It might be hop’d that
those who have complain’d of the cholic from the use of Tea, might, by
being less profuse in that, and more so in the free use of the finest
Sugar, by its soft and balsamick quality, prevent that disorder.26</p>
<p>So wrote an anonymous saccharophile of the mid-eighteenth century
whose enthusiasms were boundless. Mothers’ milk, he tells us, is
improved by the addition of sugar. Molasses is more nutritious than
butter or cheese, especially on bread, and ale and beer are served
better when brewed with it. Rum is healthier than brandy. Even unripe
fruit can be made palatable with sugar.</p>
<p>Intemperate praise of this sort was common at the time, and the
reader should make no mistake: whatever else the message, these paeans
were also political tracts, read by parliamentarians, judges,
physicians, military officers, businessmen, squires—and these
“progressive” ideas had a cumulative effect upon legislative attitudes
toward sugar and other imported foodstuffs. Yet the creation of a
radically new diet for the people of the United Kingdom—some features of
which were shared by all classes, and others differentially
distributed—cannot possibly be explained by reference to simple
legislation or some single, narrowly defined “cause.” Our primate liking
for sweetness, our capacity to endow the material world with symbolic
meaning, and our complication of the biology of ingestion with our
social structures all played a part in the rise of sucrose consumption
in England. But these neither explain why consumption varied over time
or from one class to another, nor get at why social groups can affect
the behavior of other groups, at different points in time or in
different ways.</p>
<p>The heightened productivity of the laboring classes, the radically
altered conditions of their lives, including their prior diet, their
readiness to emulate their rulers, the evolving world economy, and the
spread of the capitalist spirit—these factors cannot be measured or
weighted against one another. But they can be distinguished from factors
such as our primate nature, our symbolic faculty, and our disposition to
organize our biological satisfactions in social terms, for these latter
are constants, givens, the operation of which can be described, but not
explained in terms of their origins or differential effects.</p>
<p>Before analyzing how sucrose or any other food or taste fits into the
meal systems of the component groups or classes of a complex society, we
ought to be able to explain how it got there in the first place
(particularly in the case of a recent import such as sucrose), what
forces influenced its increasing use, and what made its consumption
important—changing it (in this instance) from rarity, novelty, or bauble
into absolute necessity. That anthropologists engaged in the study of
food in modern societies should apparently be so unconcerned with where
the foods come from and who produces them is odd, since such disinterest
diverges so radically from the traditional concerns of anthropologists
of food. When food enters into the description of a preliterate society
such as the Trobriand Islanders, the Tikopia, or the Bemba, the nature
and circumstances of its production, sources, and availability are
essential features of sociological analysis.27 But such features are not
analyzed when the food systems of modern societies are studied, probably
because the production of the foods and the circumstances of their
consumption seem so remote from each other. It is of course true that
few of us now produce our own food and that we usually buy all that we
eat—or the largest proportion of it—from other non-producers. A far cry
from the small, largely self-supporting “primitive” societies
anthropologists supposedly study, complex modern societies appear to
have divorced food production from food consumption; but why what
quantities of food were made available when they were, and how such
availabilities shaped choices, are questions deserving answers all the
same. There is still a connection between production and consumption,
and in the case of sugar, the facts suggest that early on production was
actually undertaken with specific groups of consumers in mind—the
national population of the United Kingdom, in fact.</p>
<p>If a study of the ritualization of foods in British life were
undertaken without reference either to time or to class divisions, the
search for meaning would be limited to what was presumably shared by all
English people at one point in time. So resolutely unhistorical a
position would make the system of meaning coterminous with the
present—and thus obscure, rather than clarify, the uses and meanings of
food. Divorcing the process from time, like divorcing the consumption of
sugar from its production, confines the discussion to a single point;
explaining why things are as they are is confined to existing
relationships among the parts of a social system. But looking backward
enables us to see how the relationships among the parts of such a system
took on their characteristic form over time.</p>
<p>As the first exotic luxury transformed into a proletarian necessity,
sugar was among the first imports to take on a new and different
political and military importance to the broadening capitalist classes
in the metropolis—different, that is, from gold, ivory, silk, and other
durable luxuries. Whereas the plantations were long viewed as sources of
profit through direct capital transfers for reinvestment at home, or
through the absorption of finished goods from home,28 the hypothesis
offered here is that sugar and other drug foods, by provisioning,
sating—and, indeed, drugging—farm and factory workers, sharply reduced
the overall cost of creating and reproducing the metropolitan
proletariat.</p>
<p>How did the British laboring classes become sugar eaters, after all?
The readiness of working people to work harder in order to be able to
earn—and thus consume—more was a crucial feature of the evolution of
modern patterns of eating. A new commercial spirit had to recognize this
readiness, perceiving it as a virtue to be encouraged and exploited.
Unleashing that spirit accompanied great changes in the economic and
political order, which transformed English agrarian life, “freed” the
rural population, led to the conquest and harnessing of the tropical
colonies, and resulted in the introduction of new comestibles into the
motherland. My argument is that the heightened consumption of goods like
sucrose was the direct consequence of deep alterations in the lives of
working people, which made new forms of foods and eating conceivable and
“natural,” like new schedules of work, new sorts of labor, and new
conditions of daily life.</p>
<p>But this does not mean that British working people were merely the
passive witnesses of change. An eighteenth-century writer observed:</p>
<p>In England the several ranks of men slide into each other almost
imperceptibly; and a spirit of equality runs through every part of the
constitution. Hence arises a strong emulation in all the several
stations and conditions to vie with each other; and a perpetual restless
ambition in each of the inferior ranks to raise themselves to the level
of those immediately above them. In such a state as this fashion must
have an uncontrolled sway. And a fashionable luxury must spread through
it like a contagion.29</p>
<p>Though this commentator surely exaggerated “the spirit of equality”
of his time, other writers have commented on the role of the laboring
classes themselves in taking on the habits and customs of their
“betters.”30</p>
<p>Different attitudes among the controllers of society toward working
people, and the disposition of working people to experiment with novel
foods eaten by wealthier people—such tendencies no doubt worked together
in the late eighteenth century. In the next century, other nations
followed the United Kingdom; becoming more urban and industrialized,
changing eating schedules to meet work schedules, teaching laborers to
eat away from home, to eat prepared food more frequently, and to consume
more sugar along the way. Managers of such societies recognized the
potentiality of workers to increase their own productivity if
sufficiently stimulated, and to open themselves to new, learnable
needs.</p>
<p>The determinate “cause” of such changes is a context, or a set of
situations, created by broad economic forces; within that context new
food “choices” are made—indeed, are given shape before they are even
perceived as choices. The choice between a “Danish” pastry and a
“French” doughnut during a ten-minute coffee break is a choice, but the
circumstances under which this choice is made may not be freely chosen.
Like the choice between a McDonald’s hamburger and a Gino’s chicken leg
during a thirty-minute lunch hour, the choice itself is far less
important than the constraints under which the choice is being made.</p>
<p>In much the same way, imitation (or emulation) does not take place in
some unhistorical but symbolically meaningful vacuum. What working
people actually imitate in the behavior of those with power over them,
and what they mean (intend and communicate) with such behavior, is not
always clear. The history of the tea habit is a case in point. What
laboring Englishmen did by way of imitation in this regard was to drink
tea with sugar and milk (usually inferior tea, sometimes twice-used tea,
or even hot water poured over bread crusts, sweetened with treacle), as
did others more privileged than they. Taking to the custom with a
vengeance, they increased their consumption of heavily sweetened tea
steadily, until World War I briefly interrupted the upward climb. But
does it explain very much to call this upswing the outcome of working
people’s imitation of their social betters? That the sweetened tea was
hot, stimulating, and calorie-rich; that hard work for wages under
difficult conditions typified the circumstances under which tea came to
be drunk; that tea had the power to make a cold meal seem like a hot
one—these seem equally important points. Still another factor was the
intimate relationship between where these foods were produced, on whose
initiative, by what sorts of workers, and under whose control, and where
they were consumed. The empire, after all, had an internal structure
that had seen the creation of the categories of plantation slave and
(eventually) factory proletarian within a single political system, and
had profited immensely from their provisioning one another under the
imperial thumb.</p>
<p>Where does this leave us, though? Why did the English people become
such enthusiastic sugar consumers? Not because of the innate primate
liking for sweetness; not because our species is symbolically
communicative and builds meaning into all it does, including eating; not
because socially inferior groups imitate their “superiors”; not even
because people in cold, wet climes supposedly like sugar more than other
people. Certain homelier facts seem more persuasive. The diet of the
British worker was both calorically and nutritively inadequate and
monotonous. Often working people could not get hot food, especially for
their breakfasts and midday meals. New schedules of work and rest,
changing conditions of employment, the end of the dependent relationship
of agricultural laborer to squire, the development of a putting-out
system, then a factory system—these were among the contextual conditions
for changes in food habits. It is in their light that the vaunted
disposition of people to imitate their betters can be made to rest on a
broader interpretive basis. When we read the encomia to sugar and
remember that this was a society swiftly adopting a more urban,
time-conscious, and industrial character, it is not surprising that
Slare sounded nearer the truth of things than Hanway.</p>
<p>Still, sugar, tea, and like products represented the growing freedom
of ordinary folks, their opportunity to participate in the elevation of
their own standards of living. But to assert this is to raise some
questions. The proclaimed freedom to choose meant freedom only within a
range of possibilities laid down by forces over which those who were,
supposedly, freely choosing exercised no control at all. That substances
like sugar could be changed from curiosities or adornments in English
life into essential ingredients of decent self-respecting hospitality
required that people weave them into the fabric of their daily lives,
endowing them with meaning and teaching each other to enjoy their
consumption.</p>
<p>It was not by processes of symbol making and meaning investment that
sugar was made available to the English people, but because of
political, economic, and military undertakings the organization of which
would have been unimaginable to the ordinary citizen. The immense
quantities of coerced labor required to produce sucrose and bitter
stimulant beverages also had to be arranged for, or the substances in
the quantities desired would not have been forthcoming. Only with these
arrangements secured could the wonderful and uniquely human capacity to
find and bestow meaning be exercised. In short, the creation of a
commodity that would permit taste and the symbolic faculty to be
exercised was far beyond the reach of both the enslaved Africans who
produced the sugar, on the one hand, and of the proletarianized English
people who consumed it, on the other. Slave and proletarian together
powered the imperial economic system that kept the one supplied with
manacles and the other with sugar and rum; but neither had more than
minimal influence over it. The growing freedom of the consumer to choose
was one kind of freedom, but not another.</p>
<p>Porter’s argument that lowered sugar prices were always followed by
higher consumption was amply borne out in the second half of the
nineteenth century, a period during which taxes and duties on sugars
dropped as well. A comparable abolition of government levies was a long
time coming, but by 1872 they were cut in half. Tax historian S.
Dowell’s reflections on this illuminate nicely the preceding two
centuries for us:</p>
<p>Here undoubtedly, in the opinion of many careful and provident
persons who bore in mind our fiscal system in the whole, and, regarding
advance in prosperity by leaps and bounds as a temporary and not the
normal condition of the progress of the nation, fixed their attention on
the eventualities of the future, we should have stayed the process of
reduction, which, if carried further, threatened the annihilation of the
tax. This tax, with those on tea and coffee, held, in their opinion, a
position of peculiar importance: to be kept, in time of peace, at low
rates at which, so evenly do these taxes lie over the whole surface of
the nation, the pressure was not felt by anyone, they were powerful
engines available when the nation should be called upon for a general
effort in time of war. To abolish these taxes would be to remove the
mainstays of our system of taxation.31</p>
<p>The part such taxes played in the creation of state extraction
systems, sustained by skimming from the costs of personal consumption,
is significant. Of sugar and other exotic products—particularly the
bitter, habit-forming stimulants which English people combined it
with—sugar was the most aptly taxable, partly because it was poorly
suited to smuggling (unlike tea, for instance). As its yield of wealth
to the exchequer grew, so its value as a taxable item was enshrined:
there arose a powerful vested interest in its continued and expanded
consumption. Like tea or tobacco, it could be counted upon to yield
revenues even when scarce supplies drove up its price. And, as Dowell
says, because its consumption was so widespread, “the pressure was not
felt by anyone.” Thus was the new freedom to afford sugar a key to
governance itself.</p>
<p>With the change in place of such commodities in the English diet, and
the growing recognition of the ultimate consequences of mass
consumption, the world market gradually set the price of sugar. But even
this overstates the case, for probably no single food commodity on the
world market has been subjected to so much politicking as sugar. If it
earlier was too important to be left to West Indian planters, it later
became too important to be left entirely exposed to market forces.
Sucrose was a source of bureaucratic, as well as mercantile and
industrial, wealth. Once the magnitude of its market and potential
market was grasped, maintaining control over it became important. Sugar
led all else in dramatizing the tremendous power concealed in mass
consumption. Control over it, and responsibility for the eventual
outcome, led to a sweeping revision of the philosophy that determined
the connections between metropolis and colony. It might not be too much
to say that the fate of the British West Indies was sealed, once it
became cheaper for the British masses to have their sugar from
elsewhere, and more profitable for the British bourgeoisie to sell more
sugar at lower prices.</p>
<p>To the extent that we can define things for others under
circumstances that make it difficult for them to test the meanings we
attribute to those things, we are exercising control over whether those
others use these things, consume them or fail to consume them, prize
them or disdain them. We affect their self-definition by motivating
their consumption, thereby entering intimately into the organization of
their very personalities: who and what they think they are. Tobacco,
sugar, and tea were the first objects within capitalism that conveyed
with their use the complex idea that one could become different by
consuming differently. This idea has little to do with nutrition or
primates or sweet tooths, and less than it appears to have with symbols.
But it is closely connected to England’s fundamental transformation from
a hierarchical, status-based, medieval society to a social-democratic,
capitalist, and industrial society.</p>
<p>The argument advanced here, that big background alterations in the
tempo and nature of work and daily life influenced changes in diet, is
difficult or impossible to prove. The further assumption is that the
nature of the new foods was important in their eventual acceptance. The
substances transformed by British capitalism from upper-class luxuries
into working-class necessities are of a certain type. Like alcohol or
tobacco, they provide respite from reality, and deaden hunger pangs.
Like coffee or chocolate or tea, they provide stimulus to greater effort
without providing nutrition. Like sugar they provide calories, while
increasing the attractiveness of these other substances when combined
with them. There was no conspiracy at work to wreck the nutrition of the
British working class, to turn them into addicts, or to ruin their
teeth. But the ever-rising consumption of sugar was an artifact of
intraclass struggles for profit—struggles that eventuated in a
world-market solution for drug foods, as industrial capitalism cut its
protectionist losses and expanded a mass market to satisfy proletarian
consumers once regarded as sinful or indolent.</p>
<p>In this perspective, sugar was an ideal substance. It served to make
a busy life seem less so; in the pause that refreshes, it eased, or
seemed to ease, the changes back and forth from work to rest; it
provided swifter sensations of fullness or satisfaction than complex
carbohydrates did; it combined easily with many other foods, in some of
which it was also used (tea and biscuit, coffee and bun, chocolate and
jam-smeared bread). And as we have seen, it was symbolically powerful,
for its use could be endowed with many subsidiary meanings. No wonder
the rich and powerful liked it so much, and no wonder the poor learned
to love it.</p>
