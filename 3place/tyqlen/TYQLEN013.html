<li><p>Hagelberg (1974: 51–52; 1976: 5) points out that noncentrifugal
sugars still figure importantly in consumption in a number of countries,
and estimates (in lit., July 30, 1983) that world output stands at
around twelve million tonnes (one metric ton = 2,204.6 pounds), a
significant figure.</p></li>
<li><p>Among the most interesting studies, I would note those by
Claudius Salmasius, Frederick Slare, William Falconer, William Reed,
Benjamin Moseley, Karl Ritter, Richard Bannister, Ellen Ellis, George R.
Porter, Noel Deerr, Jacob Baxa and Guntwin Bruhns, and, above all,
Edmund von Lippmann. Specific references to their works are provided in

<li><p>Of course this assertion glosses over an immense quantity of
research, both archaeological and ethnological, which I cannot deal with
here. Most scholars believe that settled agricultural life, based on
stable cereal (or root) cultivation, was a precondition for the
emergence of complex political systems (states), as in post-Neolithic
Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mexico, and so on. One authority (Cohen 1977) has
suggested that, even earlier, the successes in domesticating plants and
animals actually served to resolve a food crisis caused by the decline
of big game. Once stable cultivation was established, the human
population began to increase rapidly. Sauer 1952 and Anderson 1952
provide classic introductions to the saga of plant domestication. The
archaeologist V. Gordon Childe likened its consequences to a revolution,
and coined the term “Neolithic Revolution” to describe it (1936). Useful
information on domestication is provided in Chrispeels and Sadava 1977,
and in an article by David Harris (1969).</p></li>

<li><p>The improvement of sucrose extraction from the sugar beet,
building on studies that were pioneered by Marggraff (1709–1782), was
accomplished by his pupil Franz Achard (1753–1821). But it was Benjamin
Delessert who manufactured loaves of white sugar in 1812, to Napoleon’s
delight. The French beet sugar industry received favored treatment until
its product was fully competitive with cane sugar coming from French
tropical colonies, such as Martinique and Guadeloupe.</p></li>
<li><p>Henning 1916. A useful recent discussion can be found in
Pfaffman, Bartoshuk, and McBurney 1971. Henning sought to represent the
relations among the tastes of bitterness, saltiness, sourness, and
sweetness by a diagram having four faces. The four primary tastes are at
the apices, binary tastes along the edges, and tertiary tastes on the
surfaces, thus:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Taste tetrahedron (Henning 1916) as reproduced in Pfaffman et
al. 1971: 97.</p>
<p>Pfaffman et al. believe that the diagram works, at least for
representing successive taste sensations. The implications of a taste
system consisting of four scientifically verifiable primary tastes are
very substantial, but most authorities treat this position
circumspectly.</p>
<p>The use of the term “sweet” to describe water (and not just fresh
water as opposed to saltwater or to brackish water, but also to describe
the taste of water drunk after something salty, bitter, or sour has been
ingested) and to describe certain foods, such as scallops and crabmeat,
dramatizes the very wide range of the experience of sweetness as opposed
to the relatively narrow range of sugars and of a lexicon of taste. The
differences are sufficiently bewildering to lead one of the best
students of sweetness to write: “As psychologists explore sweetness, and
indeed the chemical senses, they are constantly required to emulate
Janus—looking one way toward the behavior of model systems in the search
for regularities and laws, but also to actual foods, where consumption
occurs and where regularities give way to irregularities and laws of
behavior to abundant exceptions” (Moskowitz 1974: 62).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Production</p></li>
<li><p>Edelman 1971. The family of naturally occurring substances called
carbohydrates, formed from carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, includes the
sugars, of which sucrose is most important to this account. It can be
found in all grasses, in some roots, and in the sap of many trees.
Photosynthesis effects the combination of carbon dioxide with water to
manufacture sugar (sucrose) and other starches and sugars. Our species
cannot manufacture sucrose, only consume it. Ingestion of carbohydrates,
together with inhalation of oxygen, allows glucose (blood sugar) to be
transformed into energy, and is accompanied by the exhalation of carbon
dioxide: “sugar consumption is thus the reverse of sugar formation”
(Hugill 1978: 11).</p></li>
<li><p>Of the six known species of the genus Saccharum, four appear to
be domesticated, and of these, Saccharum officinarum (“sugar of the
apothecaries”) is most widespread and important (Warner 1962). The
immense number of cultivated cane varieties is the consequence of a vast
amount of applied research on the major source of one of the world’s
leading commodities. Sugar has ranked among the top half-dozen food
imports worldwide for several centuries.</p></li>

<li><p>S. G. Harrison 1950: n.p.; R. J. Forbes 1966: 100–1.</p></li>
<li><p>Tabashir (tabasheer, tabaxir), or Sakkar Mambu, was much prized
as a medicinal. When hardened, this vegetable gum becomes transparent or
white, concreted, and sweet in taste. It may have been used in the same
way as sugar in medical preparations. The word tabaxir means “chalk” or
“mortar” in Urdu, according to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; it
occurs with the same meaning in the dialects of Maghribi Arabic. The
word “sugar” is believed to be derived from Sanskrit śarkarā, meaning
“gravel” or “grit.” Just as sugar came to be called a kind of salt by
the physicians of seventeenth-century western Europe, so was tabashir
called Arabian salt (Salz aus den glücklichen Arabien), “the salt of
Arabia Felix.” Opportunities for confusion between these substances were
considerable—even though they are not really similar—because both were
very rare, and probably some authors were describing them only second-
or third-hand. Parallel confusion marks discussions of Biblical
references to sweetness that mention neither manna nor honey. There
seems no likelihood that sugar was known in the Near East in Biblical
times, but scholars are not unanimous. See, for instance, Shapiro
1957.</p></li>
<li><p>Barnes writes: “Sugar cane is propagated commercially by the
vegetative method, which involves the planting of sections of the stem
of immature cane, this material being known as seed, seed cane, seed
pieces, and setts. The true seed of cane arising from natural or
controlled pollination of the female flowers is entirely unsuitable for
producing commercial crops. . . . The asexual or vegetative method
produces new plants in all respects like the canes from which the seed
pieces were taken, though in very rare cases a new individual cane is
developed from a bud sport which differs for unknown reasons from others
derived from the same variety. The new crop thusgrows from the buds of
the planted stem cuttings of the variety selected for commercial use”
(Barnes 1974: 257).</p></li>
<li><p>Hagelberg 1976: 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Ibid.</p></li>
<li><p>The words for molasses (e.g., French mélasse, Spanish melaza,
Portuguese melaço, etc.) come from the Latin mel, honey. The English
term “treacle” is from the Latin theriaca (from Greek thérion, wild
animal), an electuary or compound used in the treatment of poisonous
bites. Both Galen and Dioscorides developed “theriacs,” which often
contained the flesh of poisonous serpents. Such theriacs (or treacles)
eventually became enshrined in European medicine and did not disappear
from official pharmacopoeias until late in the nineteenth century. F.
Crane, writing in Notes and Queries (February 22, 1762), observes that
only in England did the term “treacle” come to mean molasses, presumably
by broadening its usage from a particular kind of compound to a general
substance. The important point, it seems to me, is that treacles had
been made with honey; that molasses, probably because of its rapidly
declining price, supplanted honey; and that the term for the compound
then could be transferred to the medium. We find “treacle” first written
to mean “molasses” in 1694; the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary cites
Westmacot, Script. Herb.: “good store of molossus or common Treacle to
sweeten it.” The term continues to be used to describe medicines as
well, but the word “molasses” never achieved popular usage in England,
whereas the liquid still called “treacle” (or “golden syrup”) remains
popular. The term “golden syrup” requires a passing comment in turn.
Refined molasses can be made both thinner and lighter in color, so as to
resemble honey, but with a readily varied consistency.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It achieved some kind of climax in the “golden syrup” perfected
toward the end of the nineteenth century by the Glasgow-based giant of
British sugar, Tate and Lyle. As Aykroyd (1967: 7) has pointed out, this
product, one of the most important prepared foods in modern history, has
been advertised by the invocation of a Biblical story that neatly
confounds it with honey. The container shows a dead lion, the lion
Samson killed, surrounded by bees: they have nested in the lion and made
honey. Samson’s riddle—“Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the
strong came forth sweetness”—could not be solved by the Philistines; but
Delilah worried it from him: “What is sweeter than honey? and what is
stronger than a lion?” (Judges 14:18). Aykroyd adds: The designers of
the emblem ignored the fact that the source of sweetness [in the
Biblical tale] is honey rather than sugar.” Indeed they did, epitomizing
thus a process of replacement that took centuries to complete.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Just as we cannot adequately discuss the place of sugar or sugarlike
substances in traditional Greek medicine, we must omit any serious
consideration of sugar in Indian medical practice. In all probability
hardened sugar, crystallized from the processed juice of the cane, was
being used medically in India by 400 A.D., if not earlier. But such
hardened sugar was, it seems certain, not known to Galen and his
contemporaries. The only sugar product—sucrose, that is to say—that may
have figured in Galenic medicine was probably the doughy, ropelike,
noncrystalline fanid—Arabic al-fānīd, English pennet, penide, penidium.
These words probably come from some Indic language. (The term phanita is
a Sanskrit-derived modifier of the word for “sugar” [śarkarā] employed
in the Bower Manuscript, dating to c. 375 A.D., where it refers to a
wholly liquid product. [Cf. Deerr 1949: I, 47]) Penidium gives rise to
Spanish alfeñique and English alembick, meaning a still. In its earlier
forms in English, such as “fanid,” it refers to a taffylike sugar
confection (or medicine) similar to the barley sugar of later English
usage. “Fanid,” writes Pittenger (1947: 5), “originally nothing but the
solidified cane juice after it had been boiled down and skimmed,
consisted of a brown to black syrupy dough, later described as being
yellowish and even as being whitish. It was evidently non-crystalline
because of statements to the effect that before cooling off completely,
it could be stretched into threads or leaves and rolled out.” Pomet,
writing in 1748, gives an admirably specific description of barley
sugar, which makes clear its affinity with the fanid (pennet, or
diapenidium) of European pharmacopoeia at the time: “Barley-sugar is
made either of white sugar or brown; the first sort is boil’d ’till the
Sugar becomes brittle, and will easily break after it is cold. When it
is boil’d to a Height, cast it upon a Marble, that is first lubricated
with Oil of Sweet Almonds; and afterwards work it to a Paste, in any
figure you fancy. The other Sort, improperly call’d Barley-Suger, is
made of Cassonade, or coarse Powder Sugar, clarified and boil’d to a
Toughness that will work with your Hands to any Shape, and is commonly
made up in little twisted Sticks. This Kind of sugar is more difficult
to make than the other, because of hitting the exact Proportion of
boiling to fetch it to such a Height that they may work it as they
please: This ought to be of a fine Amber-Colour, dry, new made, and such
as does not stick to the Teeth: Some Confectioners, to make it of a fine
Colour, stain it with Saffron” (Pomet 1748: 58).</li>
</ol>
<p>It is not possible to do justice to this and other kinds of sugar in
a work of the present sort. But it is worth noting that fanid or pennet
could be made in combination with almond oil, and shaped afterward into
different forms. This “sculptural” quality of some sugars was to play an
important part in the later development of sugar uses.</p>

<li><p>The first known exported sugar from the Canary Islands dates from
1506, but Fernández-Armesto (1982) believes that it began even earlier;
indeed, he supposes that Canarian sugar production surpassed Madeira’s
during the first years of the sixteenth century.</p></li>

<li><p>Ibid.: 7. Here Ratekin follows Lippmann—wrongly, I believe—in
attributing this mill type to Speciale. Mauro (1960: 209) reproduces a
1613 sketch of a mill said to have been introduced to Brazil from Peru
by a priest, after a genuine innovation in milling there (1608–12). The
new mill had three vertical rollers and a sweep bar, and allegedly
replaced a two-roller horizontal mill then in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Ratekin 1954: 10.</p></li>
<li><p>Ibid. Ratekin quotes Peter Martyr’s unsupportable claim that, by
1518, twenty-eight “mills” were operating, and Irene Wright’s more
reliable view of the growth of the industry in Santo Domingo (Wright
1916).</p></li>
<li><p>Ratekin 1954: 13; see also Sauer 1966.</p></li>
<li><p>Masefield (1967: 289–90) writes: “The first result of the
extension of sugar cane production to Madeira and the Canaries in the
fifteenth century was severe competition with existing European
producers. This was accentuated as the American colonies came into
production. By 1580 . . . the industry in Sicily was moribund. . . . In
Spain the industry languished. . . . The small medieval sugar industries
of southern Italy, Malta, the Morea, Rhodes, Crete and Cyprus all
underwent a similar decline and eventually disappeared.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“In both Madeira and the Canaries sugar production involved the use
of African slave labor. . . . This use of slaves may have helped the
islanders to undersell other European sugar producers, but Madeira and
the Canaries in their turn succumbed respectively to Brazilian and West
Indian competition.”</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>K. G. Davies 1974: 144. Davies’s mention of Javanese and Bengali
sugar is slightly surprising. For England, at any rate, the bulk of
sugars imported during the first half of the seventeenth century came
from Brazil and the Atlantic islands.</p></li>
<li><p>Andrews 1978: 187.</p></li>
<li><p>Though the term “muscovado” (mascabado, moscabado, etc.) survives
to describe some contemporary less refined brown sugars, “clayed” sugar
is no more. When semicrystalline sugars were poured into inverted
ceramic cones to permit the molasses and impurities to drain, it became
the practice to cap them with wet white clay. The water in the clay,
percolating downward, would carry with it much of the waste nonsucrose,
the molasses and other materials, leaving the base of the inverted sugar
“head” or “loaf” white in color. The apex of the cone would contain
darker, less pure sucrose, which was of poorer quality. The whiter sugar
was “clayed,” the darker “muscovado.” These were but two of the more
important descriptive terms for sugar types, of which there were scores
or hundreds. The British naturalist Sir Hans Sloane recounts the
apocryphal story that sugar claying began when it was noticed that a
hen, after foraging in wet clay, walked across wet sugar, and left it
whiter in those places where she had walked. Once sugar making had
passed the stage of removing molasses and impurities by drainage,
claying disappeared.</p></li>

<li><p>Quoted in Oldmixon 1708: I, 17. The seventeenth-century political
economist J. Pollexfen was prophetic: “Our Trade to our Plantations or
West-India Collonies takes off great quantities of our Products and
Manufactures, as well as Provisions and Handicraft Wares, and furnishes
us with some Goods for a further Manufactury, and others in great
abundance to be Exported to Foreign Nations, especially of Sugar and
Tobacco. And although some Objections may be made against the use and
necessity of those Commodities, yet being so introduced amongst us as it
may be impossible to prevent our having them from other Countries, and
being a Trade which imployes vast numbers of Ships and Seamen, ought to
be incouraged; for having lost so great a part of our Fishing Trades,
these Trades, and that to Newcastle, are now become the chief support of
our Navigation, and Nursery for Seamen. And if all back doors could be
shut, that all the Products Exported from those Collonies might without
diminution be brought to England, that what are not spent here, might be
Re-exported from hence; and those Collonies, as the proprietors are
English, made to have their whole dependance on England, the fruits of
their labours to be as much for the advantage of England, as those that
stay at Home, then all incouragement by easie Laws, Regulations and
Protection, should be given to them, they having more opportunities, and
being under a greater necessity of gaining more Laborious People, (from
whence Riches must arise) to help to make great improvements than
England, or any other of the Dominions belonging to it: And if it be
considered what Forests and Deserts have been improved, and Riches
acquired, in some of those Collonies, in so short a time, as the Age of
a Man, it must be agreed what hath been asserted, That the Original of
moveable Riches is from Labour, and that it may arise from the Labour of
Blacks and Vagrants, if well managed” (Pollexfen 1697: 86).</p></li>

<li><p>Hobsbawm 1968: 51. Hobsbawm adds to his argument elsewhere
(ibid., pp. 144–45): “We . . . expect to find, and do find, an
increasingly large excess of imports over exports after 1860. But we
also find—and this is rather odd—that at no time in the nineteenth
century did Britain have an export surplus in goods, in spite of her
industrial monopoly, her marked export-orientation, and her modest
domestic consumer market. . . . The buyers of our exports reflect the
limits of the markets to which Britain exported, which were essentially
countries which either did not want to take much more British textiles
or were too poor to have more than a very tiny per capita demand. But it
also reflects the traditional ‘underdeveloped’ slant of the British
economy, and also to some extent the luxury demand of the British upper
and middle classes. As we have seen, between 1814and 1845 about seventy
per cent of our net imports (in value) were raw materials, about
twenty-four per cent foodstuffs—overwhelmingly tropical or similar
products (tea, sugar, coffee)—and alcohol. There is not much doubt that
Britain consumed so much of these because we had a traditionally
important re-export trade in them. Just as cotton production grew, as it
were, as a by-product of a large international entrepot trade, so did
the unusually large consumption of sugar, tea, and so on, which accounts
for a large part of the deficit on current account.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect this may be too neat an explanation. The consumption of tea
and coffee diverged sharply in the eighteenth century, and these trends,
once established, were never reversed. Even if the re-export trade in
coffee maintained itself, tea won out over coffee in the British Isles,
to some substantial extent because tea was an imperial production in a
way that coffee neither was nor became. The same is even truer of sugar;
its consumption solidified once British colonies produced it, and that
has never changed.</p>

<li><p>Deerr 1950: II, 532. Davis (1979: 43–44) summarizes eloquently:
“Sugar was the largest British import for a century and a half, down to
the 1820s when it was overtaken by cotton. Sugar was wholly imported
from America, Asia or Africa; there was no British, and little European,
production. Medieval Europe had lived without it, but once cheap and
plentiful supplies appeared in the seventeenth century sugar rapidly
became a conventional necessity, and it was one without a substitute.
During the eighteenth century the slave-worked plantations of the
British Caribbean colonies were virtually the only suppliers, but in the
wars great amounts came in from British-occupied French West Indian
islands and the Dutch East Indies; and Mauritius and India became
important sources from the 1820s.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“Sugar was fairly homogeneous; that is, West Indian and Javan and
Mauritius sugar were not basically very dissimilar, though they were
imported at different stages of processing that gave them differing
reputations. The colonial product was protected until 1844 by a
discriminatory import duty that prevented foreign sugar import, but the
duty on colonial sugar itself was very high, even after it was halved in
1845. Sugar prices were therefore not only influenced on the supply side
by the opening of new sources to serve the British market, crop
fluctuations and changing costs of transport, but also by changes in the
general level of import duties and in colonial preferences. Britain’s
internal demand showed a strong long-run tendency to growth, because its
rapidly rising population had firmly established habits of sugar
consumption.</p>
<p>“Annual fluctuations in imports reflected crop variations and to some
extent merchant intentions, but stock-holding was limited, and in any
but the shortest run imports had to correspond with consumption.
Year-to-year figures show a fair degree of price-elasticity, the British
market responding to harvest variations by price changes as well as by
adjustment of stocks. In the longer run, however, the picture is
different. The slave revolution of 1791 in San Domingo (Haiti), which
was Europe’s largest supplier, caused some diversion of British supplies
to Europe, and a sharp rise in prices which was continued by the first
wartime increases in duties. Consumers seem to have been taken aback by
this, but they soon returned to their old consumption habits despite
continually rising prices. Throughout the war period the average
consumer responded to the rising price of sugar by spending more money
on it, and when prices fell after the wars he reduced his expenditure
rather than greatly increasing his consumption. When the long post-war
depression ended in the prosperity of mid-century, steeply rising
incomes caused an even faster rise in sugar consumption.</p>
<p>“This pattern of buying, revealing a rather inelastic demand, might
be expected for a non-substitutable article, on which few families spent
more than a few pence a week, but which in some small quantity had
become nearly a necessity, and which was attractive enough to invite a
greater share of expenditure as more and more incomes rose well above
the poverty line. Sugar retained its leading place among British imports
over a very long period because it was much the most used of imported
non-essential foodstuffs, and its relative importance sank only when the
basic foodstuffs themselves began to figure on a great scale in British
import trade.”</p>
<ol start="87" type="1">
<li>Such calculations, at least for 1700, must be wildly imprecise,
since both the amount of sugar consumed and England’s population in 1700
must be guessed. It seems certain, however, that nearly 13,000 tons of
sugar per year were reaching England by that time. If 10 percent of her
citizens could consume as much sugar as they wished, leaving none for
those poorer than themselves, each would have been using about 40 pounds
per year, or 1.75 ounces per day. I think these guesses are not
wild.</li>
</ol>
<p>There were, to be sure, even earlier attempts to guess at per-capita
consumption, and Joseph Massie’s “incursions into political arithmetic”
(Mathias 1979) include a sketch of differential sugar consumption by
class, for the year 1759. Massie’s purpose was to establish that the
costs of the West India monopoly had been borne by theEnglish consumers,
and he makes a good case. But I was not able to reconcile his
enumeration of “ranks, degrees and classes” and his calculations of
sugar consumed to arrive at any average figures.</p>

<li><p>Orr 1937: 23. Leverett writes: “Dental caries was not prevalent
in primitive societies apparently because their diets lacked easily
fermentable carbohydrates. Although caries is clearly a disease with
multiple causes, the principal mode of caries initiation is acid
dissolution of tooth enamel. This acid is produced by several different
microorganisms, most notably Streptococcus mutans, with fermentable
carbohydrates, especially sucrose, as the nutrient source. . . . In
England, for instance, there was a sharp increase in the prevalence of
dental caries during the Roman occupation. There was a decline in dental
caries after the departure of the Romans in the early 5th century A.D.,
and it did not significantly increase again until the second half of the
19th century, when sucrose became widely available to all levels of
society” (1982: 26–27).</p></li>

<li><p>Such general assertions are of course always risky and subject to
exceptions. But J. E. T. Rogers called the fifteenth century “the golden
age of the English labourer,” and with reason; the depopulation
resulting from the Black Death had created a labor shortage resulting in
the doubling of wages in many regions (Bowden 1967: 594). “Not until the
nineteenth century,” Postan writes, “was the wage-earner’s standard of
living again so high” (Postan 1939: 161). In the seventeenth century,
dearth fell especially hard upon the poor. The evidence collected and
assembled by Everitt and by Bowden in their contributions to The
Agrarian History of England and Wales makes clear that “the third,
fourth, and fifth decades of the seventeenth century witnessed extreme
hardship in England, and were probably among the most terrible years
through which the country has ever passed” (Bowden 1967: 621). These
were the years immediately preceding the large-scale introduction of
sugar and other commodities (such as tea) into England.</p></li>

<li><p>Not all of these particular items—saffron, for instance—are

most were imported to England; all were rare and costly; and knowledge
of their nature was for long imperfect and even fantastic. According to
tradition, it was Phoenician merchants who originally introduced saffron
to Cornwall and Ireland. Hunt (1963) claims that the Cornish buns and
cakes flavored with “saffran” confirm that tradition, while the
saffron-dyed shirts of Ireland, the leine caroich worn by chiefs,
supposedly are the origin of the tartan. England became a saffron
producer in later centuries.</p></li>

20–26) describes the casting of sugar statues duplicating existing
bronzes, which became common festive decor for the grand-ducal weddings
of the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries in major Italian and southern
French cities. Watson was not able to identify any pre–fifteenth-century
references for such sculptures, and concluded that sugar’s price
precluded this kind of display, even for the wealthy, in earlier
centuries. But since sugar was being imported to Venice no later than
about the eighth century, while refining was being improved there by the
thirteenth, earlier experimentation probably did occur. Sugar sculpture
in Islamic North Africa was common by the eleventh century. The Italian
sugar sculptures, Watson writes, were often called trionfi (triumphs):
“table decorations for banquets, most frequently wedding banquets . . .
usually . . . ornaments to delight the eye rather than the stomach . . .
sometimes presented to guests at the end of the event” (1978: 20). The
subjects were drawn from heraldic imagery, themes of triumph,
architecture, gods and goddesses, narrative groups from Biblical stories
or contemporary literature, and animals. This “court art,” Watson
believes, was partially eclipsed in the early eighteenth century by the
beginnings of hard-paste porcelain manufacture. The techniques, as well
as the ceremonial specifications, were vey likely diffused from North
Africa to northern Europe by way of Italy and then France.</p></li>

<li><p>Warner 1791: 136. Surely one of the most interesting passages
ever written about the subtleties is to be found here: “Hence arose an
extraordinary species of ornament, in use both among the English and
French, for a considerable time; representations of the membra virilia,
pudendaque muliebria, which were formed of pastry, or sugar, and placed
before the guests at entertainments, doubtless for the purpose of
causing jokes and conversations among them: as we at present use the
little devices of paste, containing mottos within them, to the same end.
. . . Nor were these obscene symbols confined to the ornaments of the
person, or to the decorations of the table, but, inthe early ages, were
even admitted into the most awful rites of religion. The consecrated
wafer, which the pious communicant received from the hands of the
priest, on Easter Sunday, was made up into a form highly indecent and
improper. . . . “Not until 1263, according to Warner, did the English
Church halt the apparently common practice of baking the communion
wafers in the shape of human testicles: “Prohibemus singulis
sacerdotibus parochialibus, ne ipsi parochianis suis die paschatis
testes seu hostias loco panis benedicti ministrent, ne ex ejus
ministratione, seu receptione erubescentiam evitare videantur, sed panem
benedictum faciant, sicut aliis diebus dominicis fieri consuevit” (Stat.
Synod. Nicolae, Episc. Anegravensis An. 1263). Warner adds: “Du Fresne
subjoins, ‘Ubi pro evitare legendum puto irritare, forte enim
intelliguntur paniculi, seu oblatae in testiculorum figuram formatae,
quas in hoc testo Paschali loco panis benedicti dabant’” (Gloss. Tom.
III, p. 1109). A revival of such odd practices, now of course entirely
divested of any religious associations, is evidenced by occasional
stories in the contemporary American press. A January 1982 article in
the Baltimore Evening Sun, for example, recounts the success of “adult”
gingerbread cookies and “erotic chocolates.” “I have people coming in,”
marvels one confectioner, “and saying: ‘I want to see the gynecologist
special.’ Some women actually take these candies to their doctors and
give their doctors candy after an examination.” I intend to deal
anthropologically with these rather bizarre materials in a subsequent
publication.</p></li>

<li><p>Levey 1973: 74. It is tempting to try to combine Galenic humoral
concepts with the “taste tetrahedron” proposed by Henning (1916) to show
the interrelationships among the taste qualities. Galen himself had
enumerated more than four taste qualities. But humoral medicine appears
to be grounded upon a quadripartite organization of physical reality,
and the taste qualities that were most often enumerated were four in
number. The four elements of the natural world were air, fire, water,
and earth; earth was dry, water moist, fire hot, air cold. Any two
elements combined to produce a complexion; there were four, each with
its own humor:</p>

<p>Yellow or green bile</p>
<p>Melancholic</p>
<p>Cold and dry</p>
<p>Black bile</p>
<p>All foodstuffs were made up of the same elements; their suitability
as food depended upon these elements, relative to the temperament of the
consumer. So lamb, which was considered moist and phlegmatic, was
unsuitable for old men, whose stomachs had too much phlegm already.
Children, by temperament phlegmatic, were to eat moderately hot and
moist meats; as they grew older, becoming either sanguine or choleric,
they were to eat cold salads, and colder meats (this is not, of course,
a reference to temperature), reverting to hot and moist meats in old
age. Appetite was believed to be a function of heat and dryness;
digestion, of heat and moisture; retention, of coldness and dryness;
expulsion, of moisture and coldness. Since foods had their
characteristic states, they could be prescribed in dietary fashion.
Moreover, the system was made more elaborate by the notion of degrees
(so that, for instance, lettuce was cold and moist, while cabbage was
hot in the first degree and dry in the second).</p>
<p>The “hot” and “cold” distinctions (which have nothing to do with
temperature, of course, and occur in much-modified form in the
contemporary folk medicine of much of the world) figured in Galenic
humoral medicine (Kremers and Urdang 1963: 16–17), and were maintained
and elaborated by Islamic scholars after the seventh century. Especially
important in this semiscientific elaboration (and in its subsequent
perpetuation in western medicine for centuries thereafter) was Alkindus
(Abū Yūsuf Ya’qūb ibn-Ishāq al-Kindī), physician to the caliphs
al-Ma’mun and al-Mu‘taim at Baghdad. Alkindus “prematurely attempted to
establish an exact method of prescribing by applying the law of
geometrical progression to the Galenic doctrine of qualities and degrees
of complicated mixtures. His geometrical prescribing combined with
musical harmony is well illustrated in the following:</p>

<p>Honey and sugar were humorally different, it appears. But the humoral
characterization of sugar probably developed within the Islamic world
itself, later to be diffused to Europe. Because of this, the two
substances were not used with complete interchangeability, though their
uses overlapped, and sugar replaced honey more and more. Sweet-tasting
foods seem generally to have been considered hot, the other three
“qualities” or tastes being cold:</p>
<p>Hic fervore vigent tres, salsus, amarus, acutus,</p>
<p>Alget acetosus, sic stipans, ponticus atque</p>
<p>Unctus, et insipidus, dulcis, dant temperamentum.</p>
<p>(Harington n.d. [1607]: 50)</p>
<p>But a fleeting glance at the relevant materials gives no indication
that sweetness was treated for diagnostic purposes as a “quality”
separate from the food that produced the sweet sensation. My attempt to
find some simple imposition of four tastes upon four humors (upon four
fluids, upon four body processes, upon four elements, etc., etc.)
failed. But serious study of the incorporation of sugar into the humoral
pathology of the European world would probably reveal much about the way
it was viewed, particularly in contrast to honey.</p>

<li><p>The influence of Arab pharmacology upon western concepts of
liquid medicines and beverages is suggested in a small way by
contemporary lexicon. It was through that influence that terms such as
sherbet, shrub, syrup, and julep entered English; and these
contributions of Arabic (and Persian, via Arabic) to English seem to
have been based largely on the diffusion of sugar uses.</p></li>
<li><p>Pittenger 1947. Note that nearly all the ingredients are white in
color. The association between purity and whiteness is ancient in
Europe. White sugar was commonly prescribed in medicines, and
combinations of white foods (chicken, cream, rice flour, almonds, etc.)
seem to have enjoyed a popularity at times out of all proportion to
their therapeutic efficacy.</p></li>

<li><p>An argument of a kind could be made for sugar’s innocence or

<li><p>Pittenger (1947) enumerates the following: (1) preservative; (2)
antioxidant; (3) solvent; (4) to give consistency or body; (5)
stabilizer; (6) to mask bitter and unpleasant-tasting drugs; (7) in
syrups; (8) as a demulcent; (9) as a food; (10) as a replacement for
glycerin; (11) in elixirs; (12) as a binder for tablets; (13) as an
excipient; (14) as a coating; (15) as a diluent and sweetening agent;
(16) as a confection base; (17) as an oil sugar base; (18) as an
aromatic sugar base; (19) as a homeopathic medicated globule base; (20)
as a homeopathic medicated cone base; (21) as a candy cough lozenge
base; (22) as a test diet base; (23) in calcium saccharate; (24)
medicinally. Of these, I believe that nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11,
13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, and 24 were known and employed in the
pharmacopoeias transferred to Europe in Latin translation beginning no
later than around 1140; that nos. 2, 12, 17, 19, and 20 were possibly
practiced; and that only nos. 10, 22, and 23 are probably European and
recent. Though I have not consulted specialists in the history of
pharmacy concerning this list, I believe the main point—that most such
practices were developed or invented in the Islamic world, between the
seventh and twelfth centuries—is unassailable.</p></li>
<li><p>Lippmann 1970 [1929]: 456–66. Serveto’s essay on syrups seems
innocuous enough to one ignorant of the deeper philosophical
implications—which have to do with much more basic conceptions of
orthodox Christianity. Pittenger’s (1947: 9) suggestion that Serveto may
have lost his life because of his hostility to sugared medicines is
insouciant, to say the least. On Syrups can hardly be called medical in
character, no matter how broadly one uses that adjective.</p></li>

study of diabetes mellitus (“the pissing sickness”) or saccharine

urine of diabetics and speculated on the possible particular
significance of this aspect of the disease. He is generally regarded as
the discoverer of diabetes m. (cf. Major 1945: 238–42). Willis was one
of the first medical men of his time to raise serious questions about
sugar and health, thus incurring the wrath of Frederick Slare.</p></li>

putting milk and sugar into our tea,” writes Dodd (1856: 411), “so do
the coffee-drinkers of tropical countries consider it to be barbarism to
introduce such additions to the fragant decoction of their favourite
berry. Lieutenant Welsted gives an amusing illustration of this: ‘A
party of Bedouins were disputing respecting the sanity of Lady Hester
Stanhope,—one party strenuously maintaining that it was impossible a
lady so charitable, so munificent, could be otherwise than in full
possession of her faculties. Their opponents alleged acts in proof to
the contrary. An old man with a white beard called for silence—a call
from the aged among the Arabs seldom made in vain. “She is mad,” said
he; and lowering his voice to a whisper, as if fearful such an outrage
against established custom should spread beyond his circle, he added,
“for she puts sugar in her coffee!” This was conclusive.’”</p></li>

22¾ pounds of tea were provided to the king (purchased at 50s. per
pound!); not until 1668 does a commercial order for 100 pounds of China
tea occur in the records. Only after the English were driven out of Java

<li><p>Hanway 1767. In an anonymous tract (whose author is undoubtedly
Hanway) inveighing against both tea and sugar, we are told: “If you
please, then, join them all together, and compute the expence, the loss
of time taken in breaking and washing the dishes, sweetening the tea,
spreading the bread and butter, the necessary pause which defamation and
malicious tea-table chat afford, and they will largely account for half
a day in winter, spent in doing that which is worse, very much worse
than doing nothing.” That the tea and sugar might serve to make it
possible for people to do much more than otherwise does not seem to have
occurred to such critics.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Dorothy George has commented insightfully (1925: 14) on the school of
opinion Hanway represented. In the latter half of the eighteenth
century, there was, she writes, “a general cry of national
deterioration. This is based largely on two ideas, one, the terrible
effects of increasing luxury, as seen for instance, in the nabob, or the
lamplighter with silk stockings, or the labourer’s family consuming tea
and sugar. The other is the decline of what Defoe called the Great Law
of Subordination, a theory of course much stimulated by the fears of
Jacobinism roused by the French Revolution. Though connected with
opposite schools of thought, the two ideas merged; the well-dressed
lamplighter for instance might be regarded as a symbol of either of the
two great causes of degeneration. Contemporary denunciations of luxury
and insubordination deserve a rather critical attention. They imply a
higher standard of living and some improvement in education. The fine
clothes, good food and constant tea-drinking so much complained of after
1750 were incompatible with the wholesale consumption of gin of the
earlier part of the century. There was something paradoxical in a
complaint by Dr. Price in 1773 that ‘the circumstances of the lower
ranks of people are altered in every respect for the worse, while tea,
wheaten bread and other delicacies are necessaries which were formerly
unknown to them.’”</p>
<p>But we can see clearly in retrospect that those who feared the moral
and political consequences of increased and widened consumption were
bound to lose out as the Industrial Revolution approached, the empire
expanded, and as the trading, planting, and manufacturing classes grew
apace, though not yet locked in competition with each other.</p>

Pegolotti’s (1936: 434–35) accounts from the thirteenth century are rich
with references to different sorts of sugars reaching Venice (and
passing through that city as well), mainly from the eastern
Mediterranean. Included here are the once-, twice-, and thrice-“cooked”
(refined) sugars; the various loaves (mucchera, caffettino, bambillonia,
musciatto, and domaschino), which differed in form and quality; powdered
sugar (polvere di zucchero or simply polvere); the various imperfectly
refined, molasses-heavy sugars (zucchero rosato, zucchero violato), etc.
There is also some mention of molasses, though such references are
unsatisfactory. Heyd 1959 [1879]: II, 690–93) notes that such liquids
were perceived, at least to judge by their names, as similar to honey:
mel zucarae, zuccara mellita, miel di calamele, meil sucre, etc. While a
reconstruction of both the distinctions among these sugars and some
specification of their different uses is possible—Lippmann (1970 [1929]:
339 ff.) actually attempts to classify them—it is a task for the future.
By turning instead to developing uses and preferences in England itself,
I am able to cover some of the same ground.</p></li>

Honey, was not published until 1759, and dealt with honey mainly as a
medicine. Crane’s work is particularly important because of her
insistence that honey was a food, a medicine, and a basis for
manufacturing alcohol—but not a sweetener. She argues persuasively that
sweetening was simply not valued that highly by the English before
perhaps the thirteenth century.</p></li>

poetically about tea. One of the earliest devotees was Nahum Tate, whose

includes the lines:</p></li>

its very production raises interesting questions of social history.
Sugar cane apparently excited similar excesses. Of James Grainger’s
interminable poem about sugar (“The Sugar Cane. In Four Books.”), Samuel
Johnson scoffed that he might as well have written of a parsley garden
or a cabbage patch. But the role of so-called didactic poetry in
influencing attitudes about these commodities should not be
slighted.</p>

as great. Better class industrial workers in Manchester in 1836 consumed
about ½ oz. of tea per head per week and 7 ozs. of sugar. Workers of a
corresponding type today consume 3 ozs. of tea and nearly 35 ozs. of
sugar in all forms. This five-fold increase in sugar consumption is the
most striking change of the nation’s diet during the last 100 years. It

<li><p>That apostle of colonization Edward Gibbon Wakefield, whom Karl
Marx criticized so roundly, has some sprightly remarks upon the
beneficial effects of the extension of markets. Of particular interest
is his implication that sugar (among other things) reduced the costs of
agricultural production in the metropolis: “It is not because an English
washerwoman cannot sit down to breakfast without tea and sugar, that the
world has been circumnavigated; but it is because the world has been
circumnavigated that an English washerwoman requires tea and sugar for
breakfast. According to the power of exchanging are the desires of
individuals and societies [so much for symbolic anthropology]. But every
increase of desires, or wants, has a tendency to supply the means of
gratification. . . . The sole ground on which it is supposed that the
blacks of the West Indies will work for wages as soon as they shall be
set free, is their love of finery. They will produce sugar, it is said,
in order to buy trinkets and fine clothes. . . . As with individuals, so
with nations. In England, the greatest improvements have taken place
continually, ever since colonization has continually produced new
desires among the English, and new markets wherein to purchase the
objects of desire. With the growth of sugar and tobacco in America, came
the more skilful growth of corn in England. Because, in England, sugar
was drank and tobacco smoked, corn was raised with less labour, by fewer
hands; and more Englishmen existed to eat bread, as well as to drink
sugar and smoke tobacco” (Wakefield 1968 [1833]: 509; emphasis
added).</p></li>

<li><p>Lloyd 1936: 114–15. George Orwell (1984 [1937]: 85–86) observed
this problem firsthand, and commented upon it with his usual acuity.
Analyzing the debate over the minimum food needed for continued
survival, he cites a miner’s family budget in which eight pounds of
sugar weekly are consumed, and writes: “The basis of their diet,
therefore, is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea, and
potatoes—an appalling diet. Would it not be better if they spent more
money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they
even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel
and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no
ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary
human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw
carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have,
the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire
may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an
unemployed man doesn’t. . . . When you are unemployed, which is say when
you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don’t want to eat
dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit ‘tasty.’ There is
always some cheaply pleasant thing to tempt you. Let’s have three
pennorth of chips! Run out and buy us a twopenny ice cream! Put the
kettle on and we’ll all have a nice cup of tea! . . . White
bread-and-marg and sugared tea don’t nourish you to any extent, but they
are nicer (at least most people think so) than brown bread-and-dripping

<li><p>Mintz 1979. I am not interested here in the intentions of the
British ruling classes, other than their internally divided—that is,
conflicting—intentions to profit from their investments. If they are
free, the proletarian and propertyless owners of their own labor power
sell it to the owners of capital; if they are enslaved, the slave and
propertyless nonowners of their own labor power surrender it under
duress. In the first instance, all such labor appears as paid labor,
paid for by the owners of capital; in the second instance, all such
labor appears as unpaid surplus labor yielded to the owners of the
slaves. “The value of labour-power resolves itself into the value of a
definite quantity of the means of subsistence. It therefore varies with
the value of these means or with the quantity of labour requisite for
their production” (Marx 1939 [1867]: 172). As British workers responded
to the availability of products such as tobacco, tea, and sugar, and
later, even more intensely to their declining prices, they consumed more
and more of them. Overall, they exchanged smaller and smaller quantities
of their earnings for larger and larger quantities of these and like
commodities. I have tried to suggest that the dietary and physiological
consequences of this were mixed; it is certainly an open question
whether all of such consequences were in the workers’ best interests. As
an interesting sidelight to this process, the development of exact and
interchangeable measures of both substances and human effort in the same
caloric terms gave new meaning to Marx’s concept of labor power: a unit
of work could be expressed exactly as a unit of sugar (in caloric
terms), and vice versa. It seems unlikely that this exact rendering of
the “weight” or “mass” of labor power, developed as part of the science
of nutrition at the turn of the century, was not fully understood at an
earlier time by some of those same sugar enthusiasts whose words have
been quoted here. The relationship between nutrition and disciplined
effort may have been learned first on the Caribbean sugar plantations,
in fact (as was so much else about labor exaction), before its
refinement in the free labor markets of Europe itself.</p></li>

<p>Turner comments: “There is a prima facie case for believing that a
dietary ‘calling’ to discipline the body by reference to a
religio-medical regimen would have been compatible with a spirit of
capitalism” (Turner 1982: 27). Turner hypothesizes some “elective
affinity” between diet and the rise of capitalism, but has in mind
something both more abstract and quite differently generated from my
line of argument here.</p>

<li><p>No mystery here. In the developed countries, sucrose contributes
a bigger share of calories to the total food intake of the poor than of
the rich. Statistical support for this assertion is weak; but no one
seems prepared to contradict it. Sucrose is commonly rationed in the
West in wartime, in part because it is usually imported (except for beet
sugar in some countries) and its flow may be interrupted, in part
because it is politically wise to ensure that everyone gets at least
some of what there is. But for those for whom it may compose up to
perhaps as much as 30 percent of total caloric intake (Stare 1975),
response to its virtual disappearance from the market parallels the
response to scarcities of alcohol, tobacco, and the stimulant
beverages.</p></li>
<li><p>“I know not why we should blush to confess that molasses was an
essential ingredient in American independence,” wrote John Adams in
1775. “Many great events have proceeded from much smaller causes.” The
thirteen colonies were voracious consumers of molasses and of rum,
manufactured from molasses. Only after the Revolution, and gradually,
did Americans give up their preference for molasses, rum, and tea, to
replace them in large measure with maple syrup or corn syrup, whisky,
and coffee. Sugar consumption rose very sharply in the nineteenth
century. On rum and molasses in the British imperial trade, see Sheridan

<li><p>Of course many unanswerable questions arise from such a
conjecture. But probably most sophisticated persons in the West would
rank both French and Chinese cuisines highly, and both stand in
contradistinction to, say, American or British or German cuisines in
their use of sugar—whether in terms of gross quantities, sugar’s
position in the sequence of dishes, or its forms of use. To advance the
conjecture even more unreliably: sweetness is more often unexpected in
Chinese and French cooking than in the other cuisines, and there is
altogether less of it. Readers should not be misled by the drama of
sweet and pungent dishes in Chinese cooking, or by French pastries.
Consumption figures are markedly lower in these two countries, though
the gap is closing rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p>“For approximately 50 years or more, sugar has provided 15 to 20%
of total calories in the average U.S. diet. . . . Studies of actual
intake among individuals suggest that the percentage of calories taken
as sugar is higher during the growing and adolescent years, when energy
demands are high, and lower during adult and later years. . . . The
usual range of sugar intake may therefore be between 10 and 30% of total
calories, with the average at 15 to 20%. There being no valid evidence
to the contrary, this rate of sugar intake may be considered moderate,
and can probably be exceeded somewhat without overstepping the bounds of
moderation” (Stare 1975: 240; emphasis added). Professor Emeritus
Frederick J. Stare, M.D., is not to be confused with Dr. Frederick
Slare, the eighteenth-century champion of sugar cited frequently in this
book.</p></li>

inexact, since crop-yield figures are highly variable and cannot be
averaged without introducing serious distortions. Nonetheless, the high
caloric yield of sugar under the best conditions, relative to any other
crop, and its amazing return of energy to the environment, make it a
spectacularly efficient food.</p></li>
<li><p>Hagelberg believes that world consumption of noncentrifugal
sugars is not falling, though he concedes that consumption of “direct
consumption white” sugar is rising, particularly in the world’s urban
areas. There is more to the argument than I can deal with adequately
here.</p></li>

beet-sugar industry, they write, provides “the earliest example of the

countries” (quoted in Hagelberg 1976: 13). This has happened with other
tropical products since.</p></li>

the average consumption says nothing about probable differences in
individual intake, or differences among economic, social, regional,
racial, and age groups. Reliable data on this problem, if we had them,
could prove immensely important in future policy-making.</p></li>

<li><p>A “full-time household manager who lives with her family in
Minneapolis,” Linda Delzell tells us in her article in Ms. (entitled
“The Family That Eats Together . . . Might Prefer Not To”), says that
her family’s members are each in charge of their own nutritional needs
since she quit planning and preparing meals three years ago. “David,
13,” she asserts, “survives on cereal, milk, peanut butter, raisins,
frozen pizza, orange juice, and McDonald’s hamburgers, fries and shakes.
At times I am almost certain that he will turn into a pizza,” she adds,
“but he’s five feet nine and a very sturdy athlete” (Ms., October 1980).
Delzell says her family could have arranged to eat together “with
long-range planning, sacrifice of individual interests, sophisticated
schedule juggling, or if need be, force. But all that came of it when we
tried was strong resentment on the kids’ part, added pressure on my
husband, and frustration for me. The change in our lifestyle has meant
that we have more time to spend together—though not at meals—and are
more relaxed.”</p></li>
<li><p>To impute the apparent feeling of a chronic shortage of time that
most persons have in modern society to the intention of anyone is not my
purpose here. But it seems to me at least possible—likely, even—that
those who run a society so bent on “discovering” new consumption needs
will have little interest in finding time for their
satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p>The example is borrowed (with some vulgar amendments) from Linder
1970, whose book deserves much more attention than it has
received.</p></li>
<li><p>Though this is a subject that may seem remote from the history of
sugar, my contention is that time and sucrose are closely linked. The
classic paper by Edward Thompson (1967) comes to mind in this
connection, as does the late Harry Braverman’s work (1974). But anyone
seriously interested in these connections must inevitably return to Karl
Marx’s concepts of commodity fetishism and alienation.</p></li>

astonishing degree are involved in a vast (food) culture

an updated presentation of the interconvertibility concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Cantor 1981: 302.</p></li>
<li><p>This argument can be linked to the sugar-fat combination noted

<li><p>Barthes 1975: 58. Lindsy van Gelder, in the December 1982 issue
of Ms., bemoans the ubiquity of food, particularly for those in urban
environments who wish both to diet and to see their friends: “There
aren’t an awful lot of places in New York City where an adult and child
can sit down together after 5 P.M. without a sugar bowl in between them
and a waiter hovering nearby.” Her article, entitled “Inventing
Food-Free Rituals,” contrasts nicely with Delzell’s abdication as family
cook (see note 25): Delzell can’t cook for her family and feel free; Van
Gelder can’t figure out how to see her friends without eating.</p></li>

<li><p>The proliferation of impersonal (machine-dispenser) food outlets
encourages the use of sucrose, which can increase shelf life and reduce
the frequency of servicing, for instance. On reading this material, a
colleague at a large American university wrote: “To gain space and save
money the administration removed a large bank of milk, juice and yoghurt
machines from a snack bar in the library, converting the room into a
study hall. When students complained, they added vending machines in
adjacent buildings. But the new vending machines are all for candy,
barbecue-flavored potato chips, cheese–peanut butter atrocities, etc. My
sense of it is that the latter machines are stocked very infrequently,
in contrast to the others, which required daily stocking and
refrigeration. Presumably here sugar’s preservative and processing
virtues are particularly important. And the consequences are
interesting—while milk and yoghurt might be used as complements to a
sandwich brought from home (as was my custom), their replacements have
no role in a meal at all.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Overseas, the penetration of the nonwestern world by cold stimulant
beverages provides different interruptions of meals and schedules. In
much of the former British colonial world, the replacement of tea by
Coca-Cola has an interesting symbolic weight: most of that world had
first been converted to hot tea, a century or two ago, and its
“retransformation” bespeaks American power. In the Soviet Union and the
People’s Republic of China, the growing success of cold stimulant
beverages carries a similar meaning. The number of beverage salesmen who
have become makers of foreign and military policy or journalistic
commentators upon such policy, such as Weinberger and Safire, makes one
think. See, for instance, Louis and Yazijian 1980.</p>
