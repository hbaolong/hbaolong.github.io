<h4 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h4>
<p>This book has a lengthy past. I began collecting data for it many
years ago, without even knowing it; then writing it took time, too. I
began to draft it in 1978, while enjoying a National Endowment for the
Humanities fellowship. I thank the Department of Anthropology of the
University of Pennsylvania, which bestowed on me a visiting title during
the year I spent in Philadelphia; and Professor William H. Davenport,
who generously afforded me, in addition to his company, half of his
precious office space to use as my own.</p>
<p>During the spring of 1978, thanks to the hospitality of the
Department of Anthropology of Princeton University, the Christian Gauss
Lecture Committee, and their respective chairmen, Professor James
Fernandez and Professor Joseph Frank, I was able to try out some of my
ideas on thoughtful audiences. Insightful critics, including Professors
Natalie Z. Davis, Stanley Stein, and Victor Brombert, did what they
could to help me with their queries.</p>
<p>The summers of 1980 and 1981 were spent at that mecca of scholarship,
the British Library. The Wenner-Gren Foundation and its director of
research, Lita Osmundsen, made it possible for me to go to England
during one of those summers. A research grant, provided through the good
offices of a great Hopkins dean, the late Dr. George Owen, financed the
other.</p>
<p>Of special importance were the people who helped me to find
materials, copied and kept in order citations, documents, and
references, and typed manuscript revisions. I am particularly grateful
to Elise LeCompte, who surely worked as hard on the book as I did,
before emigrating to graduate school. Marge Collignon typed the final
draft with skill and celerity. Dr. Susan Rosales Nelson worked swiftly
and efficiently in preparing the index.</p>
<p>To the librarians who showed me unfailing kindness at the Van Pelt
Library (University of Pennsylvania), the British Library, the Wellcome
Institute of Medicine Library, the Firestone Library (Princeton
University), the Enoch Pratt Free Public Library of Baltimore, and,
above all, the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (The Johns Hopkins
University), I owe more than I can say. A special salute to the staff of
the Interlibrary Loan Department of the Eisenhower Library, whose
industry, dedication, and efficiency are unmatched.</p>
<p>Many good friends read and criticized portions of the manuscript at
different points in its preparation. Among them I must mention my
colleague Professor Ashraf Ghani, as well as Dr. Sidney Cantor,
Professor Frederick Damon, Professor Stanley Engerman, Dr. Scott
Guggenheim, Dr. Hans Medick, and Professor Richard Price. Rich and
detailed critical commentary on the entire manuscript came from
Mr. Gerald Hagelberg, Professor Carol Heim, Mr. Keith McClelland,
Professor Rebecca J. Scott, Professor Kenneth Sharpe, and Dr. William C.
Sturtevant. I have not been able to deal adequately with all of their
criticisms and suggestions, but their help improved the text more than
they will probably recognize. Special enlightenment was volunteered by a
veteran member of the sugar tramp fraternity, Mr. George Greenwood, for
which I am most grateful. I also want to thank the members of my
department—faculty, staff, and students. Their encouragement and support
during our first decade together have given new meaning to the word
collegiality. My editor, Elisabeth Sifton, awed me with her skill and
fired me with her enthusiasm; I thank her warmly.</p>
<p><strong>If anyone suffered more with this book than I, it was my
spouse</strong>, Jacqueline, to whom it is dedicated with all of my love
and gratitude—a late present for our twentieth anniversary.</p>
