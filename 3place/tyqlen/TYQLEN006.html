<h4 id="food-sociality-and-sugar">1 ♦ Food, Sociality, and Sugar</h4>
<p>Our awareness that food and eating are foci of habit, taste, and deep
feeling must be as old as those occasions in the history of our species
when human beings first saw other humans eating unfamiliar foods. Like
languages and all other socially acquired group habits, food systems
dramatically demonstrate the infraspecific variability of humankind. It
is almost too obvious to dwell on: humans make food out of just about
everything; different groups eat different foods and in different ways;
all feel strongly about what they do eat and don’t eat, and about the
ways they do so. Of course, food choices are related in some ways to
availability, but human beings never eat every edible and available food
in their environment. Moreover, their food preferences are close to the
center of their self-definition: people who eat strikingly different
foods or similar foods in different ways are thought to be strikingly
different, sometimes even less human.</p>

</ul>
<p>The need for nourishment is expressed in the course of all human
interaction. Food choices and eating habits reveal distinctions of age,
sex, status, culture, and even occupation. These distinctions are
immensely important adornments on an inescapable necessity. “Nutrition
as a biological process,” wrote Audrey Richards, one of anthropology’s
best students of food and ingestion, “is more fundamental than sex. In
the life of the individual organism it is the more primary and recurrent
want, while in the wider sphere of human society it determines, more
largely than any other physiological function, the nature of social
groupings, and the form their activities take.”</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Nothing the newborn infant does establishes so swiftly its
social connection with the world as the expression and satisfaction of
its hunger.</strong> Hunger epitomizes the relation between its
dependence and the social universe of which it must become a part.
Eating and nurturance are closely linked in infancy and childhood, no
matter how their connection may be altered later. Food preferences that
emerge early in life do so within the bounds laid down by those who do
the nurturing, and therefore within the rules of their society and
culture. Ingestion and tastes hence carry an enormous affective load.
What we like, what we eat, how we eat it, and how we feel about it are
phenomenologically interrelated matters; together, they speak eloquently
to the question of how we perceive ourselves in relation to others.</p>
<p>From the beginning, anthropology has concerned itself with food and
ingestion. Robertson Smith, a founding father of anthropology, who
examined eating together as a special social act (he was interested in
the sacrificial meal, in connection with which he used the term
“commensals” to describe the relation between gods and human beings),
saw the breaking of bread by gods with men as “a symbol and a
confirmation of fellowship and mutual social obligations.” “Those who
sit at meat together are united for all social effects; those who do not
eat together are aliens to one another, without fellowship in religion
and without reciprocal social duties.”2 But Robertson Smith also argued
that “the essence of the thing lies in the physical act of eating
together”3—a bond, created simply by partaking of food, linking human
beings with one another.</p>
<p>In an early article, Lorna Marshall provided a glowing description of
how sharing food serves to reduce individual and intragroup tension. The
!Kung Bushmen, she reported, always consumed fresh meat immediately
after it became available: “The fear of hunger is mitigated; the person
one shares with will share in turn when he gets meat and people are
sustained by a web of mutual obligation. If there is hunger, it is
commonly shared. There are no distinct haves and have-nots. One is not
alone. . . . The idea of eating alone and not sharing is shocking to the
!Kung. It makes them shriek with an uneasy laughter. Lions could do
that, they say, not men.”4 Marshall described in detail how four hunters
who killed an eland, following ten days of hunting and three days of
tracking the wounded animal, bestowed the meat upon others—other
hunters, the wife of the owner of the arrow that first wounded the prey,
the relatives of the arrow’s owner, etc. She recorded sixty-three gifts
of raw meat and thought there had been many more. Small quantities of
meat were rapidly diffused, passed on in ever-diminishing portions. This
swift movement was not random or quixotic; it actually illuminated the
interior organization of the !Kung band, the distribution of kinfolk,
divisions of sex, age, and role. Each occasion to eat meat was hence a
natural occasion to discover who one was, how one was related to others,
and what that entailed.</p>
<p>The connections between food and kinship, or food and social groups,
take radically different forms in modern life. Yet surely food and
eating have not lost their affective significance, though as a means for
validating existing social relations their importance and their form are
now almost unrecognizably different. So an anthropological study of
contemporary western food and eating may try to answer some of the same
questions as are asked by our anthropological predecessors, such as
Richards, Robertson Smith, and Marshall—but both the data and the
methods will differ substantially. In this study, I have tried to place
a single food, or category of foods, in the evolution of a modern
western nation’s diet. It involved no fieldwork per se—though I stumbled
across issues that might be better understood if fieldwork were directed
to their exposition. Moreover, though I touch on the social aspects of
ingestion, I am concerned less with meals and more with mealtimes—how
meals were adapted to modern, industrial society, or how that society
affected the sociality of ingestion, how foods and the ways to eat them
were added to a diet or eliminated from it.</p>
<p>Specifically, I am concerned with a single substance called sucrose,
a kind of sugar extracted primarily from the sugar cane, and with what
became of it. The story can be summed up in a few sentences. In 1000
A.D., few Europeans knew of the existence of sucrose, or cane sugar. But
soon afterward they learned about it; by 1650, in England the nobility
and the wealthy had become inveterate sugar eaters, and sugar figured in
their medicine, literary imagery, and displays of rank. By no later than
1800, sugar had become a necessity—albeit a costly and rare one—in the
diet of every English person; by 1900, it was supplying nearly one-fifth
of the calories in the English diet.</p>
<p>How and why did this happen? What turned an exotic, foreign, and
costly substance into the daily fare of even the poorest and humblest
people? How could it have become so important so swiftly? What did sugar
mean to the rulers of the United Kingdom; what did it come to mean to
the ordinary folk who became its mass consumers? The answers may seem
self-evident; sugar is sweet, and human beings like sweetness. But when
unfamiliar substances are taken up by new users, they enter into
pre-existing social and psychological contexts and acquire—or are
given—contextual meanings by those who use them. How that happens is by
no means obvious. That human beings like the taste of sweetness does not
explain why some eat immense quantities of sweet foods and others hardly
any. These are not just individual differences, but differences among
groups, as well.</p>
<p>Uses imply meanings; to learn the anthropology of sugar, we need to
explore the meanings of its uses, to discover the early and more limited
uses of sugar, and to learn where and for what original purposes sugar
was produced. This means examining the sources of supply, the chronology
of uses, and the combination of sugar with other foods—including honey,
which is also sweet, and tea, coffee, and chocolate, which are bitter—in
the making of new dietary patterns. The sources of sugar involve those
tropical and subtropical regions that were transformed into British
colonies, and so we must examine the relationships between such colonies
and the motherland, also the areas that produced no sugar but the tea
with which it was drunk, and the people who were enslaved in order to
produce it.</p>
<p>Such an inquiry inevitably brings many more questions in its wake.
Did the English come to eat more sugar just because they liked it; did
they like it because they had too little of other foods to eat; or did
other factors affect their disposition toward this costly food? We need
to reflect on those social reformers, such as Jonas Hanway, who
inveighed against the wastefulness and prodigality of the laboring
classes because they came to want tea and sugar; and on their opponents,
the sugar brokers and refiners and shippers, such as George Porter, who
won out over the reformers because they envisioned sugar’s benefactions
for all Englishmen—and struggled to change the nature of the market.
This also means seeing how, over time, the exigencies of work changed
where, how, and when ordinary people ate, and how new foods were
created, with new virtues. Perhaps most important of all, we must
understand how, in the creation of an entirely new economic system,
strange and foreign luxuries, unknown even to European nobility a few
short centuries earlier, could so swiftly become part of the crucial
social center of British daily life, the universal substances of social
relationship for the farthest-flung empire in world history. And then we
shall have returned—though on a different level of explanation—to our
fellow humans the !Kung, dividing and redividing their eland meat as
they validate the social worth of the links that bind them to one
another.</p>
<p>Studying the varying use of a single ingestible like sugar is rather
like using a litmus test on particular environments. Any such traceable
feature can highlight, by its intensity, scale, and perhaps spread, its
association with other features with which it has a regular but not
invariant relation, and in some cases can serve as an index of them.
Such associations can be broad and important—as between rats and
disease, or drought and famine, or nutrition and fertility—or they may
seem trivial, as between sugar and spices. The affinity between such
phenomena may be intrinsic and explicable, as with, say, rats and
disease. But of course the association may also be quite arbitrary,
neither “causal” nor “functional,” as in the case of sugar and
spices—substances foreign to Europe, carried thence from distant lands,
gradually entering into the diet of people trying them out for the first
time; linked together mostly by the accident of usage and, to some
extent, by origin, but overlapping and diverging as their uses
overlapped and diverged and as the demand for them rose and fell. Sugar
has been associated during its history with slavery, in the colonies;
with meat, in flavoring or concealing taste; with fruit, in preserving;
with honey, as a substitute and rival. And sugar was associated with
tea, coffee, and chocolate; much of its history in the late seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries springs from that particular association. Sugar
was also first associated with the rich and the noble classes, and it
remained out of the reach of the less privileged for centuries.</p>
<p>In staying with sugar, the aim is not to de-emphasize other foods,
but to make clear the changing uses and meanings of sugar itself over
time. As uses change or are added on, as use both deepens and broadens,
meanings also change. There is nothing “natural” or inevitable about
these processes; they have no inbuilt dynamic of their own. The
relationship between the production of sugar and its consumption changed
over time and, as it did, the uses to which sugar was put and the
meanings to which it gave rise also changed. By keeping sugar itself as
the focus, we can actually see more clearly how its relationship to
other foods, those with which it was combined and those which it
eventually supplanted, was altered.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Nutritionists can construct diets for the species based on the best
scientific information available, but there is no infallible guide to
what is naturally the best food for human beings. We appear to be
capable of eating (and liking) just about anything that is not
immediately toxic. Cross-cultural studies of dietary preferences reveal
eloquently that the universes that human groups treat matter-of-factly
as their “natural environments” are clearly social, symbolically
constructed universes. What constitutes “good food,” like what
constitutes good weather, a good spouse, or a fulfilling life, is a
social, not a biological, matter. Good food, as Lévi-Strauss suggested
long ago, must be good to think about before it becomes good to eat.</p>
<p>If we look at the whole sweep of human cultural evolution and
concentrate on that last “minute” of geological time when the
domestication of plants and animals occurs, we can see that almost all
human beings who have ever lived were members of societies in which some
one particular vegetable food was “good.” Because plant domestication
and purposeful cultivation greatly increased the stability of the food
supply and, in consequence, the human population itself, most of us and
our ancestors during these past ten or twelve thousand years have
subsisted primarily on some one sort of vegetable food.5</p>
<p>Most great (and many minor) sedentary civilizations have been built
on the cultivation of a particular complex carbohydrate, such as maize
or potatoes or rice or millet or wheat. In these starch-based societies,
usually but not always horticultural or agricultural, people are
nourished by their bodily conversion of the complex carbohydrates,
either grains or tubers, into body sugars. Other plant foods, oils,
flesh, fish, fowl, fruits, nuts, and seasonings—many of the ingredients
of which are nutritively essential—will also be consumed, but the users
themselves usually view them as secondary, even if necessary, additions
to the major starch. This fitting together of core complex carbohydrate
and flavor-fringe supplement is a fundamental feature of the human
diet—not of all human diets, but certainly of enough of them in our
history to serve as the basis for important generalizations.</p>
<p>In her monographs on the Southern Bantu people called the Bemba,
Audrey Richards has described luminously how a preferred starch can be
the nutritive anchor of an entire culture:</p>
<p>For us it requires a real effort of imagination to visualize a state
of society in which food matters so much and from so many points of
view, but this effort is necessary if we are to understand the emotional
background of Bemba ideas as to diet.</p>
<p>To the Bemba each meal, to be satisfactory, must be composed of two
constituents: a thick porridge (ubwali) made of millet and the relish
(umunani) of vegetables, meat or fish, which is eaten with it. . . .
Ubwali is commonly translated by “porridge” but this is misleading. The
hot water and meal are mixed in proportion of 3 to 2 to make ubwali and
this produces a solid mass of the consistency of plasticine and quite
unlike what we know as porridge. Ubwali is eaten in hunks torn off in
the hand, rolled into balls, dipped in relish, and bolted whole.</p>
<p>Millet has already been described as the main constituent of Bemba
diet, but it is difficult for the European, accustomed as he is to a
large variety of foodstuffs, to realize fully what a “staple crop” can
mean to a primitive people. To the Bemba, millet porridge is not only
necessary, but it is the only constituent of his diet which actually
ranks as food. . . . I have watched natives eating the roasted grain off
four or five maize cobs under my very eyes, only to hear them shouting
to their fellows later, “Alas, we are dying of hunger. We have not had a
bite to eat all day. . . .”</p>
<p>The importance of millet porridge in native eyes is constantly
reflected in traditional utterance and ritual. In proverb and folktale
the ubwali stands for food itself. When discussing his kinship
obligations, a native will say, “How can a man refuse to help his
mother’s brother who has given him ubwali all these years?” or, “Is he
not her son? How should she refuse to make him ubwali?” . . .</p>
<p>But the native, while he declares he cannot live without ubwali, is
equally emphatic that he cannot eat porridge without a relish (umunani),
usually in the form of a liquid stew. . . .</p>
<p>The term umunani is applied to stews—meat, fish, caterpillars,
locusts, ants, vegetables (wild and cultivated), mushrooms,
etc.—prepared to eat with porridge. The functions of the relish are two:
first to make the ubwali easier to swallow, and second to give it taste.
A lump of porridge is glutinous and also gritty—the latter not only
owing to the flour of which it is made, but to the extraneous matter
mixed in with it on the grindstone. It needs a coating of something
slippery to make it slide down the throat. Dipping the porridge in a
liquid stew makes it easier to swallow. Thus the use of umunani, which
to European eyes adds valuable constituents to the diet, is defended by
the native on the ground that it overcomes the purely mechanical
difficulty of getting the food down the throat. . . . The Bemba himself
explains that the sauce is not food. . . .</p>
<p>It prevents the food “coming back.” Meat and vegetable stews are
cooked with salt whenever possible, and there is no doubt that an
additional function of the relish in native eyes is to give the porridge
taste and to lessen the monotony of the diet. Groundnut sauce is also
praised as bringing out the taste of a number of different relishes such
as mushrooms, caterpillars, etc.</p>
<p>In general, only one relish is eaten at a meal. The Bemba do not like
to mix their foods, and despise the European habit of eating a meal
composed of two or three kinds of dishes. He calls this habit
ukusobelekanya and one said, “It is like a bird first to pick at this
and then at that, or like a child who nibbles here and there through the
day.”6</p>
<p>The picture Richards paints for us is in its more general features
surprisingly common worldwide. People subsist on some principal complex
carbohydrate, usually a grain or root crop, around which their lives are
built. Its calendar of growth fits with their calendar of the year; its
needs are, in some curious ways, their needs. It provides the raw
materials out of which much of the meaning in life is given voice. Its
character, names, distinctive tastes and textures, the difficulties
associated with its cultivation, its history, mythical or not, are
projected on the human affairs of a people who consider what they eat to
be the basic food, to be the definition of food.</p>
<p>But some one such single food can be boring, too. People brought up
in starch-centered cultures may feel they have not really eaten unless
they have had ubwali (tortillas, rice, potatoes, bread, taro, yams,
manioc cakes—whatever), but they will also feel that ubwali is not
enough unless it is accompanied by umunani. Why this should be so is not
entirely clear, but over and over again the centricity of the complex
carbohydrates is accompanied by its contrastive periphery. Elisabeth and
Paul Rozin call one aspect of this common structural pattern a “flavor
principle” and they have drawn up lists of distinctive regional flavors,
like the nuoc mam of Southeast Asia, the chili peppers (Capsicum
species) of Mexico, West Africa, and parts of India and China, the
sofrito of the Hispanic Americans, and so on.7 But whether it be the
sauce the Bemba eat to provide taste and to make the starch easier to
swallow; the chili peppers that enliven a diet of maize-based atole and
tortillas; or the fish and bean pastes and soys of the Far East which
accompany rice or millet—these supplementary tastes gain their
importance because they make basic starches ingestively more
interesting. They also may supply important, often essential, dietary
elements, but this never seems to be the reason people give for eating
them.</p>
<p>Even in diets where a wider range of food possibilities appears to be
available, a general relationship between “center” and “edge” is usually
discernible. The Irish joke about “potatoes and point”—before eating
one’s potato, one would point it at a piece of salt pork hung above the
table—is clear enough. The habits of bread-eating peoples, who use fats
and salt to flavor the large quantities of bread they regularly eat, are
also well known. (A common East European combination used to be black
bread, chicken fat, raw garlic, and salt. There are scores of local
variants.) Pasta is eaten with a sauce; for even the most modest the
sauce changes a monotonous meal into a banquet. Cornmeal, couscous,
bulgur, millet, yams—it hardly matters which (though of course to those
whose diet is built around such an item, it matters enormously):
supplementary tastes round the diet out, punctuate it, and give it
variable character.</p>
<p>These supplements are not ordinarily consumed in large
quantities—hardly ever in quantities equal to those of the starches—and
people who eat them regularly might find the idea of doing so
nauseating. Their tastes and textures usually contrast noticeably with
the smoothness, lumpiness, grittiness, chewiness, blandness, or dryness
of the cooked starch, but they are usually blendable substances that can
be eaten when the starch itself is eaten: they “go” with it. Commonly,
they are liquid or semiliquid, soluble or meltable, often oily. Small
quantities of such supplements will change the character of substantial
quantities of liquid, especially if they have a strong or contrastive
taste and are served hot—as sauces to be ladled over starches or into
which a starch is dipped.</p>
<p>Often the supplemental food contains ingredients that are sun-dried,
fermented, cured, smoked, salted, semiputrefied, or otherwise altered
from a natural state. In these ways they contrast “processually” with
the principal starch as well. Many of the main starches need only to be
cleaned and cooked in order to be eaten.</p>
<p>The fringe additions need not be fish, flesh, fowl, or insect in
origin; often they are grasses such as watercress, chives, mint, or
seaweed (bitter, sour, pungent, chewy, slimy); lichens, mushrooms, or
other fungi (moldy-bitter, crisp, “cold”); dried spices (tart, bitter,
“hot,” aromatic); or certain fruits, either fresh or preserved (sour,
sweet, juicy, fibrous, tough). Because they may sting, burn, intensify
thirst, stimulate salivation, cause tearing or irritate mucous
membranes, be bitter, sour, salty, or sweet, they usually taste (and
probably smell) very different from the starch itself. And there is no
doubt that they increase the consumption of the core food.</p>
<p>In the last two or three centuries, whole societies—as opposed to
what were once tiny, privileged, uppermost segments of older, more
hierarchical societies—have apparently begun to stand such patterns on
end. In these rare new cases—the United States would be one—complex
carbohydrates decline as the central part of the diet, which is instead
composed for the most part of flesh (including fish and fowl), fats of
all kinds, and sugars (simple carbohydrates). These late-appearing
adaptations, which typically require immense caloric input for every
calorie delivered,8 contrast with the archaic hunter/fisher/gleaner
societies. In their own way, the United States, Argentina, and
Australia–New Zealand are as nutritionally extraordinary as the Eskimos,
the Tlingit, or the Masai.9</p>
<p>It should be superfluous to point out that the older dietary
complexes carried important symbolic loads. What people eat expresses
who and what they are, to themselves and to others. The congruence of
dietary patterns and their societies reveals the way cultural forms are
maintained by the ongoing activity of those who “carry” such forms,
whose behavior actualizes and incarnates them. Given the remarkable
capacity of human beings to change, and of societies to be transformed,
one must nonetheless imagine what would be involved in turning the
Mexican people into eaters of black bread, the Russian people into
eaters of maize, or the Chinese into eaters of cassava. And it is
important to note that the radical dietary changes of the last three
hundred years have largely been achieved by revolutionary pressures in
food processing and consumption and by adding on new foods, rather than
simply cutting back on older ones. In any event, transformations of diet
entail quite profound alterations in people’s images of themselves,
their notions of the contrasting virtues of tradition and change, the
fabric of their daily social life.</p>
<p>The character of the English diet at the time when sugar became known
to Englishmen—known and then desired—is relevant to our history. For
during the period when sugar was first becoming widely known, most
people in England and elsewhere were struggling to stabilize their diets
around adequate quantities of starch (in the form of wheat or other
grains), not to move beyond such consumption. What turns out to be most
interesting about the British picture is how little it differed from
eating habits and nutrition elsewhere in the world. As recently as a
century ago, the combination diet of a single starch supplemented by a
variety of other foods, and the constant possibility of widespread
hunger—sometimes famine—would have characterized something like 85
percent of the world’s population. Today, this picture still applies in
much of Asia, Africa, and Latin America; and the pattern of one-starch
“centricity” still typifies perhaps three-quarters of the world’s
population.</p>
<p>In 1650, the people of what was to become the United Kingdom also
lived on a starch-centered diet. Within a single century, they began to
move toward a pattern that has since been adopted by many other
societies. This transformation exemplifies one sort of modernization.
But it was not simply the consequence of other, more important changes;
indeed, in a sense it may have been the other way around: this and like
dietary transformations actively facilitated more fundamental changes in
British society. In other words, the question becomes not only how the
English people became sugar eaters, but also what this meant for the
subsequent transformation of their society.</p>
<p>Similarly, if we ask what sugar meant to the people of the United
Kingdom when it became a fixed and (in their view) essential part of
their diet, the answer partly depends on the function of sugar itself,
its significance, for them. “Meaning” in this case is not simply to be
“read” or “deciphered,” but arises from the cultural applications to
which sugar lent itself, the uses to which it was put. Meaning, in
short, is the consequence of activity. This does not mean that culture
is only (or is reducible to only) behavior. But not to ask how meaning
is put into behavior, to read the product without the production, is to
ignore history once again. Culture must be understood “not simply as a
product but also as production, not simply as socially constituted but
also as socially constituting.”10 One decodes the process of
codification, and not merely the code itself.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>Researchers working with infants in the United States have concluded
that there is a built-in human liking for sweet tastes, which appears
“very early in development and is relatively independent of
experience.”11 Though there are inadequate cross-cultural data to
sustain that position, sweetness seems to be so widely favored that it
is hard to avoid the inference of some inborn predisposition. The
nutrition scholar Norge Jerome has collected information to show how
sucrose-rich foods form part of the early acculturational experiences of
non-western peoples in many world areas, and there seems to be little or
no resistance to such items. It is perhaps noteworthy that sugar and
sugary foods are commonly diffused with stimulants, particularly
beverages. There may be some synergy involved in the ingestive learning
of new users: to date, there have been no reports on any group with a
nonsugar tradition rejecting the introduction of sugar, sweetened
condensed milk, sweetened beverages, sweetmeats, pastries,
confectionery, or other sweet dietary items into the culture. In fact, a
recent study on sucrose intolerance in northern Alaskan Eskimos revealed
that sucrose-intolerant individuals continued to consume sucrose despite
the discomforts associated with the offending items.12</p>
<p>Many scholars have promoted the thesis that mammalian responsiveness
to sweetness arose because for millions of years a sweet taste served to
indicate edibility to the tasting organism.13 Hominid evolution from
arboreal, fruit-eating primate ancestors makes this thesis particularly
persuasive, and has encouraged some students of the problem to go to
logical extremes:</p>
<p>. . . the least natural environments may sometimes provide the best
evidence about human nature. . . . Western peoples consume enormous per
capita quantities of refined sugar because, to most people, very sweet
foods taste very good. The existence of the human sweet tooth can be
explained, ultimately, as an adaptation of ancestral populations to
favor the ripest—and hence the sweetest—fruit. In other words, the
selective pressures of times past are most strikingly revealed by the
artificial, supernormal stimulus of refined sugar, despite the evidence
that eating refined sugar is maladaptive.14</p>
<p>In fact, it can be argued equally well (and more convincingly, it
seems to me) that the widely variant sugar-eating habits of contemporary
populations show that no ancestral predisposition within the species can
adequately explain what are in fact culturally conventionalized norms,
not biological imperatives. That there are links between fruit eating,
the sensation of sweetness, and the evolution of the primates is
persuasive. That they “explain” the heavy consumption of refined sugar
by some peoples in the modern world is not.</p>
<p>Indeed, all (or at least nearly all) mammals like sweetness.15 That
milk, including human milk, is sweet is hardly irrelevant. One scholar,
seeking to push the link between human preferences and sweetness just a
little further back, has even argued that the fetus experiences
sweetness when nourished in utero.16 The newborn infant usually lives
exclusively on milk at first. Jerome notes that the use of sweetened
liquids as a substitute for milk for infant feeding occurs across the
world. The first nonmilk “food” that a baby is likely to receive in
North American hospitals is a 5-percent glucose-and-water solution, used
to evaluate its postpartum functioning because “the newborn tolerates
glucose better than water.”17 On the one hand, that the human liking for
sweetness is not just an acquired disposition is supported by many
different kinds of evidence; on the other, the circumstances under which
that predisposition is intensified by cultural practice are highly
relevant to how strong the “sweet tooth” is.</p>
<p>Sweetness would have been known to our primate ancestors and to early
human beings in berries, fruit, and honey—honey being the most intensely
sweet, by far. Honey, of course, is an animal product, at least in the
sense that its raw material is gathered from flowering plants by bees.
“Sugar,” particularly sucrose, is a vegetable product extracted by human
ingenuity and technical achievement. And whereas honey was known to
human beings at all levels of technical achievement the world over from
a very early point in the historical record, sugar (sucrose) made from
the sugar cane is a late product that spread slowly during the first
millennium or so of its existence, and became widespread only during the
past five hundred years. Since the nineteenth century, the sugar beet, a
temperate crop, has become an almost equally important source of
sucrose, and the mastery of sucrose extraction from it has altered the
character of the world’s sugar industries.18 In the present century,
other caloric sweeteners, particularly those from maize (Zea mays), have
begun to challenge the primacy of sucrose, and noncaloric sweeteners
have also begun to win a place in the human diet.</p>
<p>Sensations of sweetness must be carefully distinguished from the
substances that give rise to them; and processed sugars, such as
sucrose, dextrose, and fructose, which are manufactured and refined
technochemically, must be distinguished from sugars as they occur in
nature. For chemists, “sugar” is a generic term for a large, varied
class of organic compounds of which sucrose is but one.</p>
<p>I concentrate in this book on sucrose, though there will be occasion
to refer to other sugars, and this focus is dictated by the history of
sucrose’s consumption in recent centuries, which completely outstripped
honey (its principal European competitor before the seventeenth
century), and made largely irrelevant such other products as maple sugar
and palm sugar. The very idea of sweetness came to be associated with
sugar in European thought and language, though honey continued to play a
privileged minor role, particularly in literary imagery. The lack of
clarity or specificity in European conceptions of sweetness as a
sensation is noticeable.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that, though there may be certain absolute
species-wide features in the human taste apparatus, different peoples
eat widely variant substances and have radically different ideas about
what tastes good, especially relative to other edible substances. Not
only do individuals differ in preferences and the degree of intensity of
a particular taste that suits them, but also there is no adequate
methodology to bracket or bound the range of tastes typical of persons
in any group. To add to the difficulties, the lexicons of taste
sensation, even if fully recorded, are immensely difficult to translate
for comparative purposes.</p>
<p>Still, there is probably no people on earth that lacks the lexical
means to describe that category of tastes we call “sweet.” Though the
taste of sweetness is not uniformly liked, either by whole cultures or
by all of the members of any one culture, no society rejects sweetness
as unpleasant—even though particular sweet things are tabooed or
eschewed for various reasons. Sweet tastes have a privileged position in
contrast to the more variable attitudes toward sour, salty, and bitter
tastes; this, of course, does not rule out the common predilections for
certain sour, salty, or bitter substances.</p>
<p>But to say that everyone everywhere likes sweet things says nothing
about where such tastes fit into the spectrum of taste possibilities,
how important sweetness is, where it occurs in a taste-preference
hierarchy, or how it is thought of in relation to other tastes.
Moreover, there is much evidence that people’s attitudes toward foods,
including sweet foods, have varied greatly with time and occasion. In
the modern world, one need only contrast the frequency, intensity, and
scale of sugar uses in the French diet with, say, the English or
American, to see how widely attitudes toward sweetness vary. Americans
seem to like meals to end with sweetness, in desserts; others also like
to start with sweetness. Moreover, sweetness is important in what
anthropologists call interval eating, or snacks, in American life. Other
peoples seem less inclined to treat sweetness as a “slot taste,”
suitable in only one or several positions; for them a sweet food might
appear at any point in the meal—as one of the middle courses, or as one
of several dishes served simultaneously. The propensity to mix sweetness
with other tastes is also highly variable.</p>
<p>The widely different ways that sweetness is perceived and employed
support my argument that the importance of sweetness in English taste
preferences grew over time, and was not characteristic before the
eighteenth century. Though in the West sweetness now generally is
considered by the culture (and perhaps by most scientists) a quality
counterposed to bitterness, sourness, and saltiness, which make up the
taste “tetrahedron,”19 or is contrasted to the piquancy or hotness with
which it is sometimes associated in Chinese, Mexican, and West African
cuisines, I suspect that this counter-position—in which sweetness
becomes the “opposite” of everything—is quite recent. Sweet could only
be a countertaste to salt/bitter/sour when there was a plentiful enough
source of sweetness to make this possible. Yet the contrast did not
always occur when sugar became plentiful; Britain, Germany, and the Low
Countries reacted differently, for instance, from France, Spain, and
Italy.</p>
<p>That some built-in predisposition to sweetness is part of the human
equipment seems inarguable. But it cannot possibly explain differing
food systems, degrees of preference, and taxonomies of taste—any more
than the anatomy of the so-called organs of speech can “explain” any
particular language. It is the borderline between our human liking for
sweetness and the supposed English “sweet tooth” that I hope to
illuminate in what follows.</p>
