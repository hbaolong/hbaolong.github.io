<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>This book has an odd history. Though it was completed only after a
recent and sustained period of writing, much of it grew from skimmings
and impressions collected over many years of reading and research.
Because of its subject matter, it is a figurative sort of homecoming.
For nearly the whole of my professional life, I have been studying the
history of the Caribbean region and of those tropical products, mainly
agricultural, that were associated with its “development” since the
European conquest. Not all such products originated in the New World;
and of course none of them, even those that were indigenous, became
important in world trade until the late fifteenth century. Because they
were produced thereafter for Europeans and North Americans, I became
interested in how those Europeans and North Americans became consumers.
Following production to where and when it became consumption is what I
mean by coming home.</p>
<p>Most people in the Caribbean region, descendants of the aboriginal
Amerind population and of settlers who came from Europe, Africa, and
Asia, have been rural and agricultural. Working among them usually means
working in the countryside; getting interested in them means getting
interested in what they produce by their labor. Because I worked among
these people—learning what they were like, what their lives were made
into by the conditions they lived under—I inevitably wanted to know more
about sugar and rum and coffee and chocolate. Caribbean people have
always been entangled with a wider world, for the region has, since
1492, been caught up in skeins of imperial control, spun in Amsterdam,
London, Paris, Madrid, and other European and North American centers of
world power. Someone working inside the rural sectors of those little
island societies would inevitably be inclined, I think, to view such
networks of control and dependence from the Caribbean vantage point: to
look up and out from local life, so to speak, rather than down and into
it. But this insider’s view has some of the same disadvantages as the
firmly European perspective of an earlier generation of observers for
whom the greater part of the dependent, outer, non-European world was in
most ways a remote, poorly known, and imperfect extension of Europe
itself. A view that excludes the linkage between metropolis and colony
by choosing one perspective and ignoring the other is necessarily
incomplete.</p>
<p>Working in Caribbean societies at the ground level, one is led to ask
in just what ways beyond the obvious ones the outer world and the
European world became interconnected, interlocked even; what forces
beyond the nakedly military and economic ones maintained this intimate
interdependence; and how benefits flowed, relative to the ways power was
exercised. Asking such questions takes on a specific meaning when one
also wants to know in particular about the histories of the products
that colonies supply to metropolises. In the Caribbean case, such
products have long been, and largely still are, tropical foods: spices
(such as ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and mace); beverage bases (coffee and
chocolate); and, above all, sugar and rum. At one time, dyes (such as
indigo and annatto and fustic) were important; various starches, starch
foods, and bases (such as cassava, from which tapioca is made,
arrowroot, sago, and various species of Zamia) have also figured in the
export trade; and a few industrial staples (like sisal) and essential
oils (like vetiver) have mattered; bauxite, asphalt, and oil still do.
Even some fruits, such as bananas, pineapples, and coconuts, have
counted in the world market from time to time.</p>
<p>But for the Caribbean region as a whole, the steady demand overall
and for most epochs has been for sugar, and even if it is now threatened
by yet other sweeteners, it seems likely to continue to hold its own.
Though the story of European sugar consumption has not been tied solely
to the Caribbean, and consumption has risen steadily worldwide, without
regard to where the sugar comes from, the Caribbean has figured
importantly in the picture for centuries.</p>
<p>Once one begins to wonder where the tropical products go, who uses
them, for what, and how much they are prepared to pay for them—what they
will forgo, and at what price, in order to have them—one is asking
questions about the market. But then one is also asking questions about
the metropolitan homeland, the center of power, not about the dependent
colony, the object and target of power. And once one attempts to put
consumption together with production, to fit colony to metropolis, there
is a tendency for one or the other—the “hub” or the “outer rim”—to slip
out of focus. As one looks at Europe the better to understand the
colonies as producers and Europe as consumer, or vice versa, the other
side of the relationship seems less clear. While the relationships
between colonies and metropolis are in the most immediate sense entirely
obvious, in another sense they are mystifying.</p>
<p>My own field experiences, I believe, influenced my perceptions of the
center-periphery relationship. In January 1948, when I went to Puerto
Rico to start my anthropological fieldwork, I chose a south-coast
municipality given over almost entirely to the cultivation of sugar cane
for the manufacture of sugar for the North American market. Most of the
land in that municipality was owned or leased by a single North American
corporation and its land-holding affiliate. After a stay in the town, I
moved to a rural district (barrio); there, for slightly more than a
year, I lived in a small shack with a young cane worker.</p>
<p>Surely one of the most remarkable things about Barrio Jauca—and,
indeed, about the entire municipality of Santa Isabel at the time—was
its dedication to sugar cane. In Barrio Jauca, one stands on a vast
alluvial plain, created by the scouring action of once-great rivers—a
fertile, fanlike surface extending from the hills down to the Caribbean
beaches that form Puerto Rico’s south coast. Northward, away from the
sea and toward the mountains, the land rises in low foothills, but the
coastal land is quite flat. A superhighway from northeast to southwest
now passes nearby, but in 1948 there was only a single tarred road,
running due east-west along the coast, linking the roadside villages and
the towns—Arroyo, Guayama, Salinas, Santa Isabel—of what was then an
immense, much-developed sugar-cane-producing region, a place where, I
learned, North Americans had penetrated most deeply into the vitals of
pre-1898 Puerto Rican life. The houses outside the town were mostly
shacks built on the shoulders of roads—sometimes clustered together in
little villages with a tiny store or two, a bar, and not much else.
Occasionally, an unarable field could be found, its saline soil
inhibiting cultivation, on which a few woebegone goats might graze. But
the road, the villages stretched along it, and such occasional barren
fields were the only interruptions to the eye between mountains and sea;
all else was sugar cane. It grew to the very edge of the road and right
up to the stoops of the houses. When fully grown, it can tower fifteen
feet above the ground. At its mature glory, it turned the plain into a
special kind of hot, impenetrable jungle, broken only by special
pathways (callejones) and irrigation ditches (zanjas de riego).</p>
<p>All the time I was in Barrio Jauca, I felt as if we were on an
island, floating in a sea of cane. My work there took me into the fields
regularly, especially but not only during the harvest (zafra). At that
time most of the work was still done by human effort alone, without
machines; cutting “seed,” seeding, planting, cultivating, spreading
fertilizer, ditching, irrigating, cutting, and loading cane—it had to be
loaded and unloaded twice before being ground—were all manual tasks. I
would sometimes stand by the line of cutters, who were working in
intense heat and under great pressure, while the foreman stood (and the
mayordomo rode) at their backs. If one had read about the history of
Puerto Rico and of sugar, then the lowing of the animals, the shouts of
the mayordomo, the grunting of the men as they swung their machetes, the
sweat and dust and din easily conjured up an earlier island era. Only
the sound of the whip was missing.</p>
<p>Of course, the sugar was not being produced for the Puerto Ricans
themselves: they consumed only a fraction of the finished product.
Puerto Rico had been producing sugar cane (and sugar in some form) for
four centuries, always mainly for consumers elsewhere, whether in
Seville, in Boston, or in some other place. Had there been no ready
consumers for it elsewhere, such huge quantities of land, labor, and
capital would never have been funneled into this one curious crop, first
domesticated in New Guinea, first processed in India, and first carried
to the New World by Columbus.</p>
<p>Yet I also saw sugar being consumed all around me. People chewed the
cane, and were experts not only on which varieties were best to chew,
but also on how to chew them—not so easy as one might expect. To be
chewed properly, cane must be peeled and the pith cut into chewable
portions. Out of it oozes a sticky, sweet, slightly grayish liquid.
(When ground by machine and in large quantities, this liquid becomes
green, because of the innumerable tiny particles of cane in suspension
within it.) The company went to what seemed like extreme lengths to keep
people from taking and eating sugar cane—there was, after all, so much
of it!—but people always managed to lay hands on some and to chew it
soon after it was cut, when it is best. This provided almost daily
nourishment for the children, for whom snagging a stalk—usually fallen
from an oxcart or a truck—was a great treat. Most people also took the
granular, refined kind of sugar, either white or brown, in their coffee,
the daily beverage of the Puerto Rican people. (Coffee drunk without
sugar is called café puya—“ox-goad coffee.”)</p>
<p>Though both the juice of the cane and the granular sugars were sweet,
they seemed otherwise quite unrelated. Nothing but sweetness brought
together the green-gray cane juice (guarapo) sucked from the fibers and
the granular sugars of the kitchen, used to sweeten coffee and to make
the guava, papaya, and bitter-orange preserves, the sesame and tamarind
drinks then to be found in Puerto Rican working-class kitchens. No one
thought about how one got from those giant fibrous reeds, flourishing
upon thousands of acres, to the delicate, fine, pure white granular food
and flavoring we call sugar. It was possible, of course, to see with
one’s own eye how it was done (or, at least, up to the last and most
profitable step, which was the conversion from brown to white, mostly
carried out in refineries on the mainland). In any one of the big
south-coast mills (centrales), Guánica or Cortada or Aguirre or
Mercedita, one could observe modern techniques of comminution for
freeing sucrose in a liquid medium from the plant fibers, the cleansing
and condensation, the heating that produced evaporation and, on cooling,
further crystallization, and the centrifugal brown sugar that was then
shipped northward for further refining. But I cannot remember ever
hearing anyone talk about making sugar, or wonder out loud about who
were the consumers of so much sugar. What local people were keenly aware
of was the market for sugar; though half or more of them were
illiterate, they had an understandably lively interest in world sugar
prices. Those old enough to remember the famous 1919–20 Dance of the
Millions—when the world market price of sugar rose to dizzying heights,
then dropped almost to zero, in a classical demonstration of oversupply
and speculation within a scarcity-based capitalist world market—were
especially aware of the extent to which their fates lay in the hands of
powerful, even mysterious, foreign others.</p>
<p>By the time I returned to Puerto Rico a couple of years later, I had
read a fair amount of Caribbean history, including the history of
plantation crops. I learned that although sugar cane was flanked by
other harvests—coffee, cacao (chocolate), indigo, tobacco, and so on—it
surpassed them all in importance and outlasted them. Indeed, the world
production of sugar has never fallen for more than an occasional decade
at a time during five centuries; perhaps the worst drop of all came with
the Haitian Revolution of 1791–1803 and the disappearance of the world’s
biggest colonial producer; and even that sudden and serious imbalance
was very soon redressed. But how remote this all seemed from the talk of
gold and souls—the more familiar refrains of historians (particularly
historians of the Hispanic achievement) recounting the saga of European
expansion to the New World! Even the religious education of the enslaved
Africans and indentured Europeans who came to the Caribbean with sugar
cane and the other plantation crops (a far cry from Christianity and
uplift for the Indians, the theme of Spanish imperial policy with which
the conventional accounts were then filled) was of no interest to
anyone.</p>
<p>I gave no serious thought to why the demand for sugar should have
risen so rapidly and so continuously for so many centuries, or even to
why sweetness might be a desirable taste. I suppose I thought the
answers to such questions were self-evident—who doesn’t like sweetness?
Now it seems to me that my lack of curiosity was obtuse; I was taking
demand for granted. And not just “demand” in the abstract; world sugar
production shows the most remarkable upward production curve of any
major food on the world market over the course of several centuries, and
it is continuing upward still. Only when I began to learn more Caribbean
history and more about particular relationships between planters in the
colonies and bankers, entrepreneurs, and different groups of consumers
in the metropolises, did I begin to puzzle over what “demand” really
was, to what extent it could be regarded as “natural,” what is meant by
words like “taste” and “preference” and even “good.”</p>
<p>Soon after my fieldwork in Puerto Rico, I had a chance for a summer
of study in Jamaica, where I lived in a small highland village that,
having been established by the Baptist Missionary Society on the eve of
emancipation as a home for newly freed church members, was still
occupied—almost 125 years later—by the descendants of those freedmen.
Though the agriculture in the highlands was mostly carried out on small
landholdings and did not consist of plantation crops, we could look down
from the lofty village heights on the verdant north coast and the
brilliant green checkerboards of the cane plantations there. These, like
the plantations on Puerto Rico’s south coast, produced great quantities
of cane for the eventual manufacture of granulated white sugar; here,
too, the final refining was done elsewhere—in the metropolis, and not in
the colony.</p>
<p>When I began to observe small-scale retailing in the busy market
place of a nearby town, however, I saw for the first time a coarse, less
refined sugar that harked back to earlier centuries, when haciendas
along Puerto Rico’s south coast, swallowed up after the invasion by
giant North American corporations, had also once produced it. In the
Brown’s Town Market of St. Ann Parish, Jamaica, one or two mule-drawn
wagons would arrive each market day carrying loads of hard brown sugar
in “loaves,” or “heads,” produced in traditional fashion by sugar makers
using ancient grinding and boiling equipment. Such sugar, which
contained considerable quantities of molasses (and some impurities), was
hardened in ceramic molds or cones from which the more liquid molasses
was drained, leaving behind the dark-brown, crystalline loaf. It was
consumed solely by poor, mostly rural Jamaicans. It is of course common
to find that the poorest people in less developed societies are in many
regards the most “traditional.” A product that the poor eat, both
because they are accustomed to it and because they have no choice, will
be praised by the rich, who will hardly ever eat it.</p>
<p>I encountered such sugar once more in Haiti, a few years later.
Again, it was produced on small holdings, ground and processed by
ancient machinery, and consumed by the poor. In Haiti, where nearly
everyone is poor, nearly everyone ate this sort of sugar. The loaves in
Haiti were shaped differently: rather like small logs, wrapped in banana
leaf, and called in Creole rapadou (in Spanish, raspadura). Since that
time, I have learned that such sugars exist throughout much of the rest
of the world, including India, where they were probably first produced,
perhaps as much as two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>There are great differences between families using ancient wooden
machinery and iron cauldrons to boil up a quantity of sugar to sell to
their neighbors in picturesque loaves, and the massed men and machinery
employed in producing thousands of tons of sugar cane (and, eventually,
of sugar) on modern plantations for export elsewhere. Such contrasts are
an integral feature of Caribbean history. They occur not only between
islands or between historical periods, but even within single societies
(as in the case of Jamaica or Haiti) at the same time. The production of
brown sugar in small quantities, remnant of an earlier technical and
social era, though it is of declining economic importance will no doubt
continue indefinitely, since it has cultural and sentimental meaning,
probably for producers as well as consumers.1 Caribbean sugar industries
have changed with the times, and they represent, in their evolution from
antecedent forms, interesting stages in the world history of modern
society.</p>
<p>I have explained that my first fieldwork in Puerto Rico was in a
village of cane workers. This was nearly my first experience outside the
continental United States, and though I had been raised in the country,
it was my first lengthy encounter with a community where nearly everyone
made a living from the soil. These people were not farmers, for whom the
production of agricultural commodities was a business; nor were they
peasants, tillers of soil they owned or could treat as their own, as
part of a distinctive way of life. They were agricultural laborers who
owned neither land nor any productive property, and who had to sell
their labor to eat. They were wage earners who lived like factory
workers, who worked in factories in the field, and just about everything
they needed and used they bought from stores. Nearly all of it came from
somewhere else: cloth and clothing, shoes, writing pads, rice, olive
oil, building materials, medicine. Almost without exception, what they
consumed someone else had produced.</p>
<p>The chemical and mechanical transformations by which substances are
bent to human use and become unrecognizable to those who know them in
nature have marked our relationship to nature for almost as long as we
have been human. Indeed, some would say that it is those very
transformations that define our humanity. But the division of labor by
which such transformations are realized can impart additional mystery to
the technical processes. When the locus of manufacture and that of use
are separated in time and space, when the makers and the users are as
little known to each other as are the processes of manufacture and use
themselves, the mystery will deepen. An anecdote may make the point.</p>
<p>My beloved companion and teacher in the field, the late Charles
Rosario, received his preparatory education in the United States. When
his fellow students learned that he came from Puerto Rico, they
immediately assumed that his father (who was a sociologist at the
University of Puerto Rico) was a hacendado—that is, a wealthy owner of
endless acres of tropical land. They asked Charlie to bring them some
distinctive souvenir of plantation life when he returned from the island
at the summer’s end; what they would relish most, they said, was a
machete. Eager to please his new friends, Charlie told me, he examined
countless machetes in the island stores. But he was dismayed to discover
that they were all manufactured in Connecticut—indeed, at a factory only
a few hours’ drive from the New England school he and his friends were
attending.</p>
<p>As I became more and more interested in the history of the Caribbean
region and its products, I began to learn about the plantations that
were its most distinctive and characteristic economic form. Such
plantations were first created in the New World during the early years
of the sixteenth century and were staffed for the most part with
enslaved Africans. Much changed, they were still there when I first went
to Puerto Rico, thirty years ago; so were the descendants of those
slaves and, as I later learned and saw elsewhere, the descendants of
Portuguese, Javanese, Chinese, and Indian contract laborers, and many
other varieties of human being whose ancestors had been brought to the
region to grow, cut, and grind sugar cane.</p>
<p>I began to join this information to my modest knowledge of Europe
itself. Why Europe? Because these island plantations had been the
invention of Europe, overseas experiments of Europe, many of them
successful (as far as the Europeans were concerned); and the history of
European societies had in certain ways paralleled that of the
plantation. One could look around and see sugar-cane plantations and
coffee, cacao, and tobacco haciendas, and so, too, one could imagine
those Europeans who had thought it promising to create them, to invest
in their creation, and to import vast numbers of people in chains from
elsewhere to work them. These last would be, if not slaves, then men who
sold their labor because they had nothing else to sell; who would
probably produce things of which they were not the principal consumers;
who would consume things they had not produced, and in the process earn
profit for others elsewhere.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the mysteriousness that accompanied my seeing,
at one and the same time, cane growing in the fields and white sugar in
my cup, should also accompany the sight of molten metal or, better, raw
iron ore, on the one hand, and a perfectly wrought pair of manacles or
leg irons, on the other. The mystery was not simply one of technical
transformation, impressive as that is, but also the mystery of people
unknown to one another being linked through space and time—and not just
by politics and economics, but along a particular chain of connection
maintained by their production.</p>
<p>The tropical substances whose production I observed in Puerto Rico
were foods of a curious kind. Most are stimulants; some are
intoxicating; tobacco tends to suppress hunger, whereas sugar provides
calories in unusually digestible form but not much else. Of all of these
substances, sugar has always been the most important. It is the epitome
of a historical process at least as old as Europe’s thrustings outside
itself in search of new worlds. I hope to explain what sugar reveals
about a wider world, entailing as it does a lengthy history of changing
relationships among peoples, societies, and substances.</p>
<p>The study of sugar goes back very far in history, even in European
history.2 Yet much about it remains obscure, even enigmatic. How and why
sugar has risen to such prevailing importance among European peoples to
whom it had at one time been hardly known is still not altogether clear.
A single source of satisfaction—sucrose extracted from the sugar
cane—for what appears to be a widespread, perhaps even universal, human
liking for sweetness became established in European taste preferences at
a time when European power, military might, and economic initiative were
transforming the world. That source linked Europe and many colonial
areas from the fifteenth century onward, the passage of centuries only
underlining its importance even while politics changed. And, conversely,
what the metropolises produced the colonies consumed. The desire for
sweet substances spread and increased steadily; many different products
were employed to satisfy it, and cane sugar’s importance therefore
varied from time to time.</p>
<p>Since sugar seems to satisfy a particular desire (it also seems, in
so doing, to awaken that desire yet anew), one needs to understand just
what makes demand work: how and why it increases under what conditions.
One cannot simply assume that everyone has an infinite desire for
sweetness, any more than one can assume the same about a desire for
comfort or wealth or power. In order to examine these questions in a
specific historical context, I will look at the history of sugar
consumption in Great Britain especially between 1650, when sugar began
to be fairly common, and 1900, by which time it had entered firmly into
the diet of every working family. But this will require some prior
examination of the production of the sugar that ended up on English
tables in the tea, the jam, the biscuits and cakes and sweets. Because
we do not know precisely how sugar was introduced to large segments of
Britain’s national population—at what rates, by what means, or under
exactly what conditions—some speculation is unavoidable. But it is
nevertheless possible to show how some people and groups unfamiliar with
sugar (and other newly imported ingestibles) gradually became users of
it—even, quite rapidly, daily users. Indeed, there is much evidence that
many consumers, over time, would have gladly eaten more sugar had they
been able to get it, while those who were already consuming it regularly
were prepared only reluctantly to reduce or forgo its use. Because
anthropology is concerned with how people stubbornly maintain past
practices, even when under strong negative pressures, but repudiate
other behaviors quite readily in order to act differently, these
materials throw light upon the historical circumstances from a
perspective rather different from the historian’s. Though I cannot
answer many questions that historians might bring to these data, I shall
suggest that anthropologists ask (and try to answer) certain other
questions.</p>
<p>Cultural or social anthropology has built its reputation as a
discipline upon the study of non-Western peoples; of peoples who form
numerically small societies; of peoples who do not practice any of the
so-called great religions; of peoples whose technical repertories are
modest—in short, upon the study of what are labeled “primitive”
societies. Now, the fact that most of us anthropologists have not made
such studies has not weakened the general belief that anthropology’s
strength as a discipline comes from knowing about societies the
behaviors of whose members are sufficiently different from our own, yet
are based on sufficiently similar principles, to allow us to document
the marvelous variability of human custom while vouchsafing the
unshakable, essential oneness of the species. This belief has a great
deal to recommend it. It is, anyway, my own view. Yet it has
unfortunately led anthropologists in the past to bypass willfully any
society that appeared in one regard or another not to qualify as
“primitive”—or even, occasionally, to ignore information that made it
clear that the society being studied was not quite so primitive (or
isolated) as the anthropologist would like. The latter is not an
outright suppression of data so much as an incapacity or unwillingness
to take such data into account theoretically. It is easy to be critical
of one’s predecessors. But how can one refrain from counterposing
Malinowski’s studied instructions about learning the natives’ point of
view by avoiding other Europeans in the field,3 with his rather casual
observation that the same natives had learned to play cricket in the
mission schools years before he began his fieldwork? True, Malinowski
never denied the presence of other Europeans, or of European
influence—indeed, he eventually reproached himself for too studiedly
ignoring the European presence, and called this his most serious
deficiency. But in much of his work, the West in all its guises was
played down or even ignored, leaving behind an allegedly pristine
primitivity, coolly observed by the anthropologist-as-hero. This curious
contrast—unspoiled aborigines on the one hand, hymn-singing mission
children on the other—is not an isolated one. By some strange sleight of
hand, one anthropological monograph after another whisks out of view any
signs of the present and how it came to be. This vanishing act imposes
burdens on those who feel the need to perform it; those of us who do not
ought to have been thinking much more soberly about what anthropologists
should study.</p>
<p>Many of anthropology’s most distinguished contemporary practitioners
have turned their attention to so-called modern or western societies,
but they and the rest of us seem to want to maintain the illusion of
what one of my colleagues has aptly dubbed “the uncontaminated McCoy.”
Even those of us who have studied non-primitive societies seem eager to
perpetuate the idea that the profession’s strength flows from our
mastery of the primitive, more than from the study of change, or of
becoming “modern.” Accordingly, the movement toward an anthropology of
modern life has been somewhat halting, and it has tried to justify
itself by concentrating on marginal or unusual enclaves in modern
societies: ethnic clusters, exotic occupations, criminal elements, the
“underlife,” etc. This surely has its positive side. Yet the
uncomfortable inference is that such groups most closely approximate the
anthropological notion of the primitive.</p>
<p>In the present instance, the prosaic quality of the subject matter is
inescapable; what could be less “anthropological” than the historical
examination of a food that graces every modern table? And yet the
anthropology of just such homely, everyday substances may help us to
clarify both how the world changes from what it was to what it may
become, and how it manages at the same time to stay in certain regards
very much the same.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that there is some value in trying to shape an
anthropology of the present, and that to do so we must study societies
that lack the features conventionally associated with the so-called
primitive. We must still take into account the institutions
anthropologists cherish—kinship, family, marriage, rites de passage—and
puzzle out the basic divisions by which people are assorted and grouped.
We would still try to find out more about fewer people than less about
more people. We would still, I believe, put credence in fieldwork, and
would value what informants say, as well as what they aspire to and what
they do. This would, of course, have to be a different anthropology. As
the archaeologist Robert Adams has suggested, anthropologists will no
longer be able to invoke scientific “objectivity” to protect themselves
from the political implications of their findings, if their subjects
turn out simply to be fellow citizens who are poorer or less influential
than they.4 And this new anthropology does not yet wholly exist. The
present book, mainly historical in nature, aspires to take a step in its
direction. My contention is that the social history of the use of new
foods in a western nation can contribute to an anthropology of modern
life. It would, of course, be immensely satisfying to be able to declare
that my brooding about sugar for thirty years has resulted in some
clear-cut alignment, the solution to a puzzle, the resolution of some
contradiction, perhaps even a discovery. But I remain uncertain. This
book has tended to write itself; I have watched the process, hoping it
would reveal something I did not already know.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>The organization of the volume is simple. In chapter 1, I attempt to
open the subject of the anthropology of food and eating, as part of an
anthropology of modern life. This leads me to a discussion of sweetness,
as opposed to sweet substances. Sweetness is a taste—what Hobbes called
a “Quality”—and the sugars, sucrose (which is won principally from the
cane and the sugar beet) among them, are substances that excite the
sensation of sweetness. Since any normal human being can apparently
experience sweetness, and since all the societies we know of recognize
it, something about sweetness must be linked to our character as a
species. Yet the liking for sweet things is of highly variable
intensity. Hence, an explanation of why some peoples eat lots of sweet
things and others hardly any cannot rely on the idea of the species-wide
characteristic. How, then, does a particular people become firmly
habituated to a large, regular, and dependable supply of sweetness?</p>
<p>Whereas fruit and honey were major sources of sweetness for the
English people before about 1650, they do not seem to have figured
significantly in the English diet. Sugar made from the juice of the cane
had reached England in small quantities by about 1100 A.D.; during the
next five centuries, the amounts of cane sugar available doubtless
increased, slowly and irregularly. In chapter 2, I look at the
production of sugar as the West began to consume more and more of it.
From 1650 onward, sugar began to change from a luxury and a rarity into
a commonplace and a necessity in many nations, England among them; with
a few significant exceptions, this increased consumption after 1650
accompanied the “development” of the West. It was, I believe, the second
(or possibly the first, if one discounts tobacco) so-called luxury
transformed in this fashion, epitomizing the productive thrust and
emerging intent of world capitalism, which centered at first upon the
Netherlands and England. I therefore also focus on the possessions that
supplied the United Kingdom with sugar, molasses, and rum: on their
system of plantation production, and the forms of labor exaction by
which such products were made available. I hope to show the special
significance of a colonial product like sugar in the growth of world
capitalism.</p>
<p>Thereafter, in chapter 3, I discuss the consumption of sugar. My aim
is, first, to show how production and consumption were so closely bound
together that each may be said partly to have determined the other, and,
second, to show that consumption must be explained in terms of what
people did and thought: sugar penetrated social behavior and, in being
put to new uses and taking on new meanings, was transformed from
curiosity and luxury into commonplace and necessity. The relationship
between production and consumption may even be paralleled by the
relationship between use and meaning. I don’t think meanings inhere in
substances naturally or inevitably. Rather, I believe that meaning
arises out of use, as people use substances in social relationships.</p>
<p>Outside forces often determine what is available to be endowed with
meaning. If the users themselves do not so much determine what is
available to be used as add meanings to what is available, what does
that say about meaning? At what point does the prerogative to bestow
meaning move from the consumers to the sellers? Or could it be that the
power to bestow meaning always accompanies the power to determine
availabilities? What do such questions—and their answers—mean for our
understanding of the operation of modern society, and for our
understanding of freedom and individualism?</p>
<p>In chapter 4, I try to say something about why things happened as
they did, and I attempt some treatment of circumstance, conjuncture, and
cause. Finally, in chapter 5, I offer a few suggestions about where
sugar, and the study of sugar in modern society, may be going. I have
suggested that anthropology is showing some uncertainty about its own
future. An anthropology of modern life and of food and eating, for
example, cannot ignore fieldwork or do without it. My hope is that I
have identified problems of significance concerning which fieldwork
might eventually yield results useful for both theory and policy.</p>
<p>My bias in a historical direction will be apparent. Though I do not
accept uncritically the dictum that anthropology must become history or
be nothing at all, I believe that without history its explanatory power
is seriously compromised. Social phenomena are by their nature
historical, which is to say that the relationships among events in one
“moment” can never be abstracted from their past and future setting.
Arguments about immanent human nature, about the human being’s inbuilt
capacity to endow the world with its characteristic structures, are not
necessarily wrong; but when these arguments replace or obviate history,
they are inadequate and misleading. Human beings do create social
structures, and do endow events with meaning; but these structures and
meanings have historical origins that shape, limit, and help to explain
such creativity.</p>
