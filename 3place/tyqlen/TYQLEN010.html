<h4 id="eating-and-being">5 ♦ Eating and Being</h4>
<p>By 1900, sugar in the form of processed sucrose had become an
essential ingredient in the British national diet. Combined with bitter
beverages, it was consumed daily by almost every living Briton. It was
added to foods in the kitchen and at table, and could be found in
prepared delicacies such as jams, biscuits, and pastries, which were
consumed at tea and frequently with meals. Sugar had also become a
common feature of festive and ceremonial foods from season to season and
from birth to death. Bread and salt had been the basis of western man’s
daily fare and daily imagery for millennia; now sugar had joined them.
Bread and salt—and sugar. A loaf of bread, a jug of wine—and sugar. The
diet of a whole species was gradually being remade.</p>
<p>The vastly expanded use and increasing individual consumption of
processed sucrose from 1650 to 1900 was made possible by many
achievements, among them the ever-greater technical mastery of sugar
chemistry, and a fuller scientific comprehension of sugar’s remarkable
versatility. It was the result of the application of new chemical
knowledge to a versatility long-esteemed, but never before so
imaginatively and completely exploited. By the time of World War I, the
enforced rationing of sugar was regarded as among the most painful and
immediate of the petty hardships caused by war—and of course the more
acutely felt by poorer and less privileged Britons.1 For the poor, the
tastes for sweetened tea, treacle pudding, condensed-milk custard,
biscuits, jam-smeared bread, candy, and chocolate were acquired early
and depressingly well. The more comfortable classes’ sweet tooth—just as
noteworthy in terms of what is called “national character”—was tempered
because they had so many other luxuries within reach.</p>
<p>The experience of the English in having sugar pumped into every
crevice of their diet was, as I have said, repeated in other lands, at
times more swiftly, after 1900—but with some significant differences.
Take, first, the United States, which had battened upon molasses and its
yield, rum, even before the thirteen colonies revolted.2 By 1880–84, the
United States was consuming thirty-eight pounds of sucrose per person
per year—already well ahead of all other major world consumers except
the United Kingdom. In three short years consumption had risen to 60.9
pounds.3 Within another decade, United States consumption rose still
higher. And after 1898–99—not a date picked out of a hat—it rose higher
yet. Whatever British capitalists had learned about sugar as a source of
profit after 1650, North American capitalists learned far more quickly;
those interested in the rise of North American imperialism could do
worse than looking carefully at the history of U.S. sugar
consumption.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear to what extent the perceived need of the
United States to introject tropical sugar-producing areas, by
transforming them into various sorts of colonies, was homologous with
the imperial objectives of other powers a century or so earlier. But the
mercantilist elements in this aspect of American foreign policy,
especially clear in the expansion of American military power in the
Caribbean sugar bowl, appear very late. Instead of Barbados the United
States had Puerto Rico; instead of Jamaica, Cuba; for the Pacific areas,
there were Hawaii and the Philippines. Not surprisingly, from the time
when the consumer market in the United States became
substantial—beginning around the end of the Civil War—until the present,
U.S. sugar policy has been a major political football, and a source of
stupendous (and often illicit) gain.4</p>
<p>The experience of France offers a startling contrast to that of the
Americans and the British. Like England and unlike the United States,
France early developed “sugar colonies,” exported sugar and its related
products in enormous quantities in the eighteenth century, and developed
a sweet tooth of its own. During much of the seventeenth century, French
interests dominated the European sugar trade, not yielding to the
British until afterward. French capital benefited from the slave trade
and the sugar trade, much as did British capital. Bordeaux and Nantes
played roles structurally similar to those of Liverpool and Bristol. And
there were many parallels in the colonial experience: the early
conquests of Martinique and Guadeloupe, like Barbados, and the
beginnings of a sugar industry there using engagés as indentured
servants were used in Barbados; shifting to a larger colony, Saint
Domingue, as Britain took Jamaica under Cromwell; and so on. (True,
England moved faster and farther; and in the Haitian Revolution France
was defeated and ejected by the slave revolutionaries.)</p>
<p>But the French sugar interests, no matter how zealous, were unable to
push French consumption to the point where it would deeply affect the
nature of French cuisine or the forms of French meal taking. To this day
the average French person consumes less sucrose than the average
Englishman (though the gap is closing). Only slowly has France begun to
approach the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Denmark, Iceland, the United States, and Australia—the world’s leading
sucrose consumers. In 1775, gross British sugar consumption was two and
one-half times that of the French—when the French population may have
been four times that of England and Wales. This would have meant French
per-capita consumption at that time was but one-tenth that of Britain.
Richard Sheridan, an American historian of the British Caribbean,
accepts the view that eighteenth-century French consumption reflected
far lower standards of living; but as he suggests, one should also
consider the drinking habits of these two nations.5 While the English
people moved from beer and ale through gin and rum and partially back to
beer and ale again, meanwhile acquiring a profound liking for heavily
sweetened tea, the French remained primarily wine drinkers throughout.
The acquisition of a coffee habit in the seventeenth century, though
certainly important—Michelet believed the French Revolution was in part
traceable to its effects!—did not reduce wine drinking. The wine habit
may have negatively influenced the disposition to consume sweet
substances, even while providing abundant calories.</p>
<p>Beyond this, there is the matter of cuisine itself. Brillat-Savarin
referred to sugar as the universal condiment; but, as P. Morton Shand,
commenting on English tastes, wrote, “he was using the word in its wider
general sense of a flavoring, and not with the particular and
specialized meaning it has since acquired.”6 Sweetness does not seem
ever to have been enshrined as a taste to be contrasted with all others
in the French taste spectrum—bitter, sour, salt, hot—as it has in
England and America. Though dessert has a firm place in French meals,
the position of cheese is even sturdier. Sweetness occurs in French food
in sometimes surprising fashion—often as if it were a spice. This is
rather like the Chinese usage, where sweetness also occurs somewhat
unexpectedly, and also not always as the climax to a meal. The less
conspicuous role of sugar in French and Chinese cuisines may have
something to do with their excellence.7 It is not necessarily a
mischievous question to ask whether sugar damaged English cooking, or
whether English cooking in the seventeenth century had more need of
sugar than French.</p>
<p>When we turn to the so-called less developed countries, yet another
perspective is afforded us. Sucrose, contributing as it does something
like one-seventh of the average caloric intake of populations in many
developed countries (which means, of course, more than that for certain
economic sectors and age groups), is so powerful a symbol of the good
life that some eminent authorities suggest its caloric contribution
could safely become even greater.8 Linked with the general welfare
centuries ago, sucrose is still viewed as beneficial by many observers.
To examine the reasons why, it may be useful to say a little more about
sugar itself—that is, sucrose from sugar cane—even at this late
point.</p>
<p>In the modern world, where the efficient use of energy counts more
and more each day, the efficiency of sugar-cane production is a potent
factor in sugar’s success. G. B. Hagelberg, one of the keenest students
of the world sucrose industry alive, writes, “As a rule, sugar cane (and
sugar beet) produce larger quantities of utilizable calories per land
unit in a given time than any other cultivated plant in their respective
climatic zones.”9 Per hectare (2.47 acres), sugar cane yields, under
optimum conditions, about twenty tons of dry material, some half of
which is in the form of sugar usable as food or feed; the other ten tons
of cane “trash,” or bagasse, is usable as fuel and for the manufacture
of paper products, building materials, and furfuraldehyde (a liquid
aldehyde used in manufacturing nylon and resins, and as a solvent).
Assuming certain raw material and processing parameters, the fifty tons
of millable cane stalks obtainable from one hectare under Caribbean
conditions will yield:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>5.6 tons of high grade raw sugar. On the basis of an annual per
capita consumption of 40 kilograms [88 lbs.], this quantity is
sufficient for 140 persons, providing the equivalent of 420 kilocalories
a day to each or about one-seventh [14 percent] of the total daily
caloric intake.</p></li>
<li><p>13.3 tons of wet bagasse (49 percent moisture, 2 percent soluble
solids). As fuel, this has a value equivalent to 2.4 tons of fuel oil.
Alternatively, depithed and bone dry, this quantity of bagasse can yield
somewhat over two tons of bleached paper pulp. Assuming that 500
kilograms of steam are required to process one ton of cane and that 2.3
tons of steam are generated per ton of wet bagasse, use of the bagasse
as fuel to process the 50 tons of cane for sugar should actually leave a
surplus of roughly 2.4 tons of wet bagasse or about 5 tons of steam for
other purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>1.35 tons of final or blackstrap molasses. Roughly a third of the
weight of final cane molasses is sucrose that cannot be commercially
recovered as centrifugal sugar and about a fifth is composed of reducing
sugars. . . . This quantity of molasses [with some additions] is almost
sufficient to fatten one bull from 200 to 400 kilograms live
weight.10</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To these remarkable calculations we must add something concerning
sugar’s relative efficiency as a calorie supplier. As agricultural
yields have risen with better modern scientific methods, sugar cane’s
long-standing superiority to other crops has grown proportionately. An
acre of good subtropical land will now produce more than eight million
calories in sugar, beyond the other products it yields. Comparisons with
temperate-zone crops are somewhat biased in sugar’s favor, but they are
striking, all the same. It is estimated that to produce eight million
calories with potatoes would require more than four acres; with wheat,
between nine and twelve acres. (It is senseless to add beef to this
comparison: to produce eight million calories of beef requires over 135
acres!11) Such calculations seem stark enough in a world that confronts
profound energy problems, but they must be projected backward as well
(even allowing that sugar-extraction methods centuries ago were nowhere
near so efficient as they are now). Such statistics throw light upon the
past, while raising vital questions about the future.</p>
<p>Where the need for calories, let alone other food values, is a
serious problem, sucrose may not be a good nutritional answer (in large
quantities, I think it is a terrible one); but circumstances early made
it, and have kept it, what looks like a good economic answer. When one
adds to this the remarkable energy-transforming nature of plants like
sugar cane and maize—even at high levels of human input in the form of
fertilizers, cultivation, etc., the solar-energy input is approximately
90 percent of the total energy consumed in producing a usable food—the
appeal of sucrose as a solution to food problems becomes almost
irresistible.</p>
<p>If we take into account the underlying hominid predisposition toward
sweetness, and add to it the astounding caloric yield of sucrose and the
efficiency of production that yield betokens, together with the steady
decline in the cost of sugar over the centuries, we have some reason for
sugar’s success in gaining new consumers. Of course none of this is to
overlook the concerted effort to create demand, nor does it help us
understand why some consumer markets have been much better than others
over the centuries. But even the most sophisticated contemporary
antisaccharites are compelled to recognize sugar’s appeal on grounds of
taste, energy economy, relative cost, and calories—an appeal sugar
manufacturers clearly recognize, and which their political,
professorial, and professional supporters push vigorously.</p>
<p>If we pick up once more the argument that the human diet since the
invention of agriculture has centered upon a core complex carbohydrate
“fringed” with contrasting tastes and textures to stimulate appetite
(and usually improving nutrition also), then the exact role of sucrose
in dietary change is difficult to establish. One might be prepared to
group sweet with sour, salt, and bitter as a taste that afforded a
contrast to the principal complex carbohydrates. But if the sweet fringe
expands so that the proportion of the complex-carbohydrate core is
reduced—to where it provides perhaps only half of the caloric intake
instead of 75 or 90 percent—then the whole architecture of the meal
itself has changed. There is nothing mysterious about this. During the
history of western cuisine, among the wealthy and powerful, protein-rich
foods like meat, fish, and poultry were probably the first major items
to supplant copious starch consumption, and such foods undoubtedly grew
more important even for the laboring classes between the seventeenth and
twentieth centuries, but not in comparable proportions. Instead, the
introduction of foods like sucrose made it possible to raise the caloric
content of the proletarian diet without increasing proportionately the
quantities of meat, fish, poultry, and dairy products.</p>
<p>Refined sugar thus became a symbol of the modern and industrial. It
early came to be viewed in this way, penetrating one cuisine after
another, accompanying or following on “westernization” or
“modernization” or “development.” Sucrose turns up as a pioneering and
popular sign of “progress” among Native North Americans, Eskimos,
Africans, and Pacific islanders. Commonly, people learn about it in one
of two ways: either they exchange their labor or products or wages for
it (along with other desired western goods); or else it is given to them
as part of the charity provided by the West—charity usually donated
after the westerners recognize the economic disorganization arising from
their protracted contact with “less developed” traditional cultures.</p>
<p>These are roughly the same processes that, at an earlier time, marked
the spread of European power and the economy of western capitalism, from
region to region and from continent to continent. Even in the case of
societies that have been sucrose consumers for centuries, one of the
corollaries of “development” is that older, traditional kinds of sugar
are being gradually replaced with the white, refined product, which the
manufacturers like to call “pure.” In countries like Mexico, Jamaica,
and Colombia, for example, all very old sugar producers and consumers,
the use of white sugar and of products fabricated with simple syrup has
spread downward from the Europeanized elites to the urban working
classes, then outward to the countryside, serving as a convenient marker
of social position or, at least, aspiration; the older sugars are
meanwhile eliminated because they are “old-fashioned” or “unsanitary” or
“less convenient.” Not all of these pejorative labels are wrong:
noncentrifugal sugars are not so usable in processed foods and
beverages, and the enterprises that produce them are usually less
efficient than modern factories. But notions of modernity enter in
strongly as more processed sugars diffuse to wider circles of consumers.
Eventually, the traditional sugars survive as heirlooms of a
sort—expensive relics of the past—whereupon they may reappear as stylish
“natural” or conspicuous items on the tables of the rich, whose
consumption habits helped to make them rare and expensive in the first
place, now produced in modern ways that make money for people quite
different from those who formerly produced them.12</p>
<p>The forces that impel consumers to spend more on “traditional”
consumption at one point, and on “modern” consumption at another, are
complicated and many-sided. One reason we do not understand them better
in the case of sugar is that sucrose vendors have always been interested
in patterns of consumption only in order to be able to change them; it
is the openness of the patterns to change that concerns them. Vendors
also understand that the patterns will not yield unless the conditions
under which consumption occurs are changed—not just what is worn, but
where and when, and with whom; not just what is eaten, but where and
when, and with whom.</p>
<p>A radical change in the perceived situation—for example, learning to
feel continuously hurried—can serve to motivate people to try different
things. For sucrose sellers, the aim is to increase the role of the
market in consumption. This may involve making consumers insecure about
their consumption; motivating them to try to identify themselves
differently by what they consume; or convincing them they can change the
view others have of them by what they consume. The precise ways in which
people change from the traditional to the new or modern are not fully
understood. We see how people move from old-fashioned brown-sugar loaves
or “heads” to paper boxes or bags of refined white sugar, from local
beverages to Coca-Cola, from homemade candy to store-bought candy; but
we understand far too little of precisely what steps or changes this
involves. What seems likely is that such changes repeat or re-enact
earlier, similar sequences. As different stages of change succeed one
another, we may see recapitulated in them the fairly regular or
recurrent historical stages by which outside forces dominated
consumption—and, antecedent to it, labor power—at earlier points in
western history.</p>
<p>We have seen how the relationships between the metropolises and their
sources of sucrose have changed radically over time, as the position of
sucrose in social life shifted. At first, sugar was brought from afar,
purchased from foreign producers. Later, each metropolis acquired its
own tropical colonies for the production of sugar on a mercantilist
basis, simultaneously enriching the state and its commercial and
financial classes, stimulating the consumption of both its home
manufactures and colonial products, and increasing the market
involvement of its own hinterlands. With the perfection of
temperate-zone beet-sugar processing, the move from protectionism to a
“free market” received more encouragement. Though the colonies remained
important sources of gain, the opening of trade and the mastery of
beet-sugar processing—the first important seizure by temperate
agriculture of what were previously the productive capacities of a
tropical region13—helped to counterbalance the subsequent political
challenges to the industrial capitalists at home made by the planter
classes in the colonies.</p>
<p>The character and level of sucrose consumption reflect wider
processes in yet another way: the differential allocation of sucrose to
different uses is a coefficient of other features of development. It is
possible to contrast household sucrose use, in candy making, jam making,
baking, etc., with its nonhousehold industrial uses, as in factory-baked
goods and the manufacture of other prepared and processed foods, both
sweet and nonsweet (salad dressings, breadings, catsup, etc.).
Statistics show clearly that the more developed the country, the higher
the percentage of nonhousehold, industrial use, and recent history
confirms as much. Two students of changes in the American use of refined
sugar have demonstrated that direct consumer or household use (assumed
to be synonymous with purchases of granulated sugar in packages of less
than fifty pounds) declined from 52.1 pounds per year in 1909–13 to 24.7
pounds in 1971; while industrial use (food products and beverages) has
risen during the same period from 19.3 pounds to 70.2 pounds.14 This
trend also shows up, though much less dramatically, in developing
countries.</p>
<p>Industrial use takes two different forms, however, as far as the
consumer is concerned: on the one hand, there is consumption outside the
home (in restaurants, at snack bars, checkout counters, theaters, etc.),
which has risen, pari passu, together with other developmental indices;
on the other, there is the ever-increasing use of prepared foods in the
home itself. These different forms of sucrose consumption in
manufactured and processed foods are connected; both are responses to
wider social forces, and they also show up in the developing countries.
That societies increasing their per-capita sugar consumption apace may
also be moving away from household toward nonhousehold consumption is a
way of saying that their citizens are bound to eat more meals away from
home, and to eat more prepared foods within the home.</p>
<p>Neither trend indicates specifically the social meanings of the
changes themselves. The relationship between sucrose and these broad
social changes is emblematic rather than essential—sugar is even more
important for what it reveals than for what it does—and we can examine
what it does to understand better what has made the doing possible.
Because sucrose is, in both its production and its consumption, at the
contact points of capitalist intent, it is worthwhile tracing the scale,
content, and form of the changes in its consumption.</p>
<p>At the production end, sugar early became one of the leading
motivations for making overseas agricultural experiments of a mixed
sort—that is, with capitalist means and unfree labor. At the consumption
end, it was, as we have seen, one of the first items transformed from
luxury to necessity, and thereby from rarity to mass-produced good, a
transformation embodying both the promise and the fulfillment of
capitalism itself. Sucrose production during the last five centuries of
western expansion shows an irregular but noticeable geographic movement:
first, it was a rarity, a medicine, a spice, coming from afar, traded
for but not produced (indeed, the production was somewhat mysterious);
then it became an expensive commodity produced from cane in overseas
tropical colonies of the very temperate power whose citizens consumed
it, these citizens being proletarianized but not proletarian (which is
to say, disfranchised but not yet exclusively wage-earning labor);
third, it was a less costly commodity produced elsewhere (not
necessarily in the colonies of the same power) by various forms of
labor, including proletarians; and, lastly, it became an inexpensive
everyday commodity, often produced from sugar beets within national
boundaries of the same power, much of it by proletarians for
proletarians, but most of it bought and sold worldwide in a “free”
market.</p>
<p>“Development,” as it is called, has meant among other things a
relatively steady increase in sugar consumption since perhaps the
mid-nineteenth century. Around 1800 the part of world sucrose production
that reached the market amounted to some 250,000 tons.15 By 1880 that
figure had risen fifteenfold, to 3.8 million tons. From 1880 until the
onset of World War I—the period when sugar production was technically
modernized—the production of centrifugal (“modern”) sugar rose to more
than sixteen million tons. And though the period between world wars was
one of economic depression and stagnation, it ended with world sugar
production at over thirty million tons. In spite of sharp declines
during the war, sucrose production resumed its remarkable climb after
1945. From 1900 to 1970, world production of centrifugal sugar increased
by about 500 percent, according to one source; another estimates the
increase as being more like 800 percent.16 Since world population
approximately doubled during those same seventy years, this means that
the “available” sugar per person per day worldwide rose from twenty-one
to fifty-one grams. By 1970, something like 9 percent of all available
food calories in the world were in the form of sucrose, and that figure
is probably higher now.</p>
<p>Many of the really big consuming countries today are European, but by
no means all. Iceland was the biggest per-capita consumer as of
1972—about 150 grams per person per day; Ireland, the Netherlands,
Denmark, and England were consuming more than 135 grams per person per
day at that time. One hundred and fifty grams works out to slightly more
than 120 pounds of sucrose per year, or about a third of a pound of
sucrose per person per day. For countries that are already big
consumers, like Ireland and England, sucrose may contribute 15–18
percent of total energy consumption per capita. Allocation of
differential quantities by age and class, if we had the data, would
reveal a remarkable, if not shocking, dependency of some age/class
sectors upon sucrose.17 It seems certain that less privileged groups
(not necessarily the poorest in the less developed countries; more
likely the poorest in the more developed countries) consume
disproportionate quantities; and it seems likely that younger persons
consume more than older or elderly persons. These are not much better
than wild guesses; hunches about regional, urban-rural, racial, and
sexual differences in sugar-consumption patterns worldwide would be even
riskier.</p>
<p>With development comes a higher percentage of sucrose use in prepared
foods. Indeed, the shift to indirect use, like sugar consumption itself,
has become a development signal of a kind. Health researcher Arvid
Wretlind estimated that the percentage of total sucrose consumed which
was used by food industries a decade ago in the Netherlands was 60, and
in England 47.18 Other analysts have found that, in the United States,
the proportion of total sucrose consumed which was used in food
preparation came to an estimated 65.5 percent of the total in 1977.19 So
large a commitment to indirect use does not occur in quite the same way
in the less developed world, even when sugar consumption is rising.</p>
<p>Increasing sugar consumption is only one of the ways “development”
changes food habits and choices, of course. While caloric intake
probably increases as sugar consumption rises, this increase is partly
achieved by substitutions, one of the clearest being the replacement of
complex carbohydrates (starches) with simple carbohydrates (sucrose). In
England, grain consumption decreased from a high of nearly 250 pounds
per person per year to less than 170 pounds between 1938 and 1969; sugar
consumption during the same period increased from a low of about 70
pounds (1942) to about 115 pounds; and one authority set the per-capita
figure at 125 pounds for 1975.20 This whittling away of the complex
carbohydrates is of interest quite aside from its nutritional
implications, given the change it betokens in the ancient relationship
between starch core and the flavor fringe.*</p>
<p>The disproportionate contribution of the fringe to caloric intake, as
the core’s contribution declines, is only one aspect of the change.
Together with the sugar increases come remarkable increases in the
consumption of fats. Two students of this change, using the years
1909–13 as their comparison base, have shown for the United States that
the average daily per-capita consumption of sugars as a proportion of
carbohydrates increased in sixty years from 31.5 percent to 52.6
percent; the total daily average per-capita consumption of complex
carbohydrates fell from about 350 grams to about 180 grams; while the
consumption of dietary fat increased by 25 percent to 155 grams.21 In
the past fifteen years there have been further sharp increases in fat
consumption, from 126 pounds to 135 pounds per person by 1979. If these
figures are accurate, they mean that the average per-capita annual
consumption of food fats and processed sugars in the United States in
1979 reached 265 pounds.22 This works out to almost exactly
three-quarters of a pound of fat and sugar per person per day.</p>
<p>The apparent connection between fats and sugars—and their effect on
the consumption of complex carbohydrates—has nutritional, psychological,
and economic implications.23 But what does this trend mean
culturally?</p>
<p>First, it is associated with the increasing tendency to eat outside
the home. The multiplication of syndicated food dispensaries, so-called
fast-food systems, since World War II, and particularly in the last two
decades, is highly significant. In the United States, the National
Advertising Bureau tells us, the “typical American eater” visits a
fast-food restaurant nine times a month. One-third of all food dollars
are spent on meals away from home, according to the Wall Street Journal.
(Of course we want to know at what rates these trends are revealing
themselves, to what specific segments of the population they apply, and
over how long a time—and we do not know.)</p>
<p>Second, there is the increased consumption of prepared foods within
the home, along with a heightened differentiation of the foods
themselves: we now are “free” to choose several different precooked and
frozen veal dishes, for instance, packaged by the same manufacturer but
different in “style” (milanese, marinara, limonata, oreganata,
francese). The number of foods that require nothing but temperature
changes before eating has risen in proportion to the total number of
prepared and partially prepared foods, including those that may require
more than heating to be done to them before they can be consumed. And
the variety of heating and chilling media, usually running on
high-energy output—woks, steamers, bakers, broilers, deep fryers,
radiation and convection ovens—has also risen sharply, all vended on the
basis of “speediness,” “convenience,” “economy,” and “cleanliness.”</p>
<p>These developments directly affect the role playing that has
traditionally accompanied family meals. Anthropological students of food
and eating have thought it valid to analogize from linguistics to
describe what happens, both in any given meal and in the patterning of
meals. Thus, Mary Douglas tells us that “the binary or other contrasts
must be seen in their syntagmatic relations.” By this, she explains, she
means putting into analyzable order food units descending from daily
menu to mouthful, and ascending from daily to weekly or yearly, and from
everyday to special, festive, and ceremonial. Paradigmatic relations
characterize the components within a meal, and syntagmatic relations
characterize those among meals; or, to cite Douglas again, “On the two
axes of syntagm and paradigm, chain and choice, sequence and set, call
it what you will, [Halliday] has shown how food elements can be ranged
until they are all accounted for either in grammatical terms or down to
the last lexical item.”24</p>
<p>But the whole momentum of modern life has been away from any such
“lexicon” or “grammar,” and the analogy is not a good one. Describing
the foods in a meal in linguistic terminology hardly “accounts for”
them, because the structural constraints on ingestion are not comparable
to those on language; we can eat without meals, but we cannot speak
without grammar. The function of grammar in language has to be agreed
upon by the speakers—that is, held in common and understood by them—for
communication to take place at all. Hence the relation of so-called
grammar to eating is only a cute artifact of description. Eating will of
course continue, even if the very idea of “meal” as we know it
disappears.</p>
<p>Viewed from the perspective of the modern-food technologist,
abolition of any such “grammar” is the best way of increasing
consumption of mass-produced food products while maximizing what he
might refer to as “freedom of individual choice.” Increased consumption
may not be the admitted intent; but it would be hard to conjecture what
else it is. The “paradigm” of the meal, the “syntagm” of the meal
schedule, and time restraints on eating may all be considered as
obstructions to the exercise of individual preference.</p>
<p>In contrast, meals that must be eaten by everyone at the same time
require advancement, postponement, or cancellation of competing events
by the participants. Meals consisting of the same items for all eaters
must be based on a least common denominator, rather than on each
person’s greatest preferences. Meals that are eaten in some fixed order
may run counter to one or another participant’s preference for soup last
or dessert later. Ceremonial meals that involve some invariant item
(lamb, turkey) may be unpleasant for an individual who dislikes that
food. When one is serving oneself from a serving plate, the helpings
must be adjusted to the desires of others who are eating. All of these
constraints reveal that social eating is precisely that: social,
involving communication, give and take, a search for consensus, some
common sense about individual needs, compromise through attending to the
needs of others. Social interaction leaves room for the operation of
opinion and in-group influence. But some might call these constraints
upon individual freedom.</p>
<p>The food technologist interested in selling products aims willy-nilly
at the obliteration of such schedules and “grammars,” and at a
standardized, even if large, “lexicon”—making it possible for everyone
to eat exactly what he or she wants to eat, in exactly the quantities
and under exactly the circumstances (time, place, occasion) he or she
prefers. Incidental to this is the elimination of the social
significance of eating together. Ideally, in these terms, an obese
daughter may now eat a series of yogurts, an enthusiastic
television-watching father a TV dinner, a jogging mother large
quantities of granola, and an alienated son no end of pizzas, Cokes, or
ice creams.25</p>
<p>As food availability has been generalized across modern society, the
structures of meals and the calendar of diet in daily life have tended
to disappear. Coffee and Coca-Cola are now appropriate at any time and
with any accompaniment. So, too, are breaded, deep-fried bits of complex
carbohydrate and protein (potatoes, corn and wheat bread sticks,
chicken, scallops, shrimp, pork, fish pieces). Synthetic juices that
split the difference between the food faddists and the Pepsi Generation;
fiber-rich cereals made calorie-heavy with raisins, figs, dates, honey,
nuts, and nut substitutes; crackers, cheeses, dips, pretzels, and
“munchies”—together these now provide a nutritive medium within which
social events occur, rather than the other way round. The meal, which
had a clear internal structure, dictated at least to some degree by the
one-cook-to-one-family pattern and the consequences of socialization
within such a pattern, as well as by “tradition,” can now mean different
items and different sequences for each consumer. The week’s round of
food, which once meant chicken or some equivalent on Sunday, or fish on
Friday, is no longer so stable, nor viewed as so necessary by the
participants. And the year’s round of food, which brought bock beer,
shad, fresh dill, and new potatoes, each in its turn, turkey twice a
year, and fruit cake with hard sauce at New Year’s, survives only on
sufferance, finessed by turkey burgers, year-round bock beer, and other
modern wonders.</p>
<p>These transformations have made ingestion more individualized and
noninteractive; they have desocialized eating. Choices to be made about
eating—when, where, what, how much, how quickly—are now made with less
reference to fellow eaters, and within ranges predetermined, on the one
hand, by food technology and, on the other, by what are perceived as
time constraints.</p>
<p>The experience of time in modern society is often one of an insoluble
shortage, and this perception may be essential to the smooth functioning
of an economic system based on the principle of ever-expanded
consumption.26 Anthropologists and economists have struggled with the
paradox implicit in modern society—that its vastly more productive
technologies result in individuals having (or feeling they have) less
time, rather than more. Because of time pressure, people try to condense
their consumption pleasure by consuming different things (such as movies
and popcorn) simultaneously. This simultaneous (but often peculiarly
unsatisfying) experience seems to the individual to be a “natural”
one—just as does the proliferation of fruit stands, croissant carts,
coffee machines, and the like on the corners and in the building
basements, laundry rooms, and hallways of American cities, in gas
stations, at checkout counters, in theater lobbies, and elsewhere.
Maximum enjoyment in minimum time has come to mean both divided
(simultaneous) consumption—one eats while walking or working, drinks
while driving or watching entertainment—and higher frequency of
occasions for consumption. Watching the Cowboys play the Steelers while
eating Fritos and drinking Coca-Cola, while smoking a joint, while one’s
girl sits on one’s lap, can be packing a great deal of experience into a
short time and thereby maximizing enjoyment. Or it can be experienced
quite differently, depending upon the values one holds. Most important,
however, people who experience pleasures simultaneously in these ways
are taught to think about the consumption itself—not about the
circumstances that led them to consume in that fashion, other than to
sense that there was “not enough time” to do otherwise.27</p>
<p>Since the only objective way to increase time is to alter percentages
for the activities it encompasses, and since the workday has remained
relatively the same length for a century, most adjustments in available
time tend to be cosmetic, or to involve “time-saving.” The development
of prepared food to be eaten in the home, as well as eating out, are
both regarded as time-saving practices. Of course, consuming prepared
food means surrendering much of one’s choice in what one eats. But, not
surprisingly, the food industry touts it as increasing one’s freedom of
choice—especially when the industry omits reference to what the food
itself contains. Thus is the dialectic between supposed individual
freedom and social patterning perpetuated.</p>
<p>In discussing the penetration of sucrose into the rhythms of the
British workday, I was able to give only summary treatment to such
fundamental changes as the alterations in the workday, the change in the
sexual division of labor, revised allocations of effort, and the
inversions of eating time and preparation time. We know that the
scheduling of events and rituals changed radically for the British
working class when sugar became common, but the research done on this
aspect is too broad (and hence too shallow) to permit documentation in
any serious fashion. Alterations in the perception of time must have
been at least as important as the actual objective remaking of the
workday, and these rarely express the exercise of power directly.
Indeed, it is just because such power is revealed only indirectly that
it can remain mysterious—setting the terms of work as if the machines
demanded it, or as if daylight made it necessary, or as if the others in
the work force fixed the tempo, or as if eating had to fit within a unit
of time, rather than its being the act of eating itself that determines
how much time it should take.</p>
<p>One of the effects of changing the time formula is that it subtly
recasts people’s images of their lives and of themselves. How much time
people actually have for different pursuits, how much time they believe
they have, and the relationship between these are aspects of daily life
shaped by externalities and, in particular in the modern world, by the
reorganization of the workday.28 What seem visible to the worker,
however, are the changed conditions of work. These new conditions shape
in turn what is left of his time; yet how much time one “has” may be
only fleetingly perceived as dependent, ultimately, on the work regime.
People live inside the time they think they have; they may experience
subjective changes in their moods, conditioned by their ability to live
up to (or, often, not to live up to) their own standards of performance;
but only now and then do they conceive of their performance as affected
by alterations that give and take away time, or their will to feel they
are controlling the use of time.</p>
<p>The patterning of time is linked to the patterning of ingestion;
material on the United States is sufficiently detailed to clarify the
line of argument here. The rise in the use of prepared foods, the
increase in meals eaten out, and the decline of the meal itself as a
ritual (particularly for kin groups) have led in recent decades to
different patterns of sucrose usage as well as to increases in the
consumption of sugars overall.</p>
<p>Between 1955 and 1965, per-capita usage of certain sweets and
sugars—candy, for example—actually dropped 10 percent. But during the
same period, the per-capita consumption of frozen-milk “desserts” rose
31 percent; of baked goods 50 percent; and of soft drinks 78 percent.29
From these figures, I think it is possible to infer an increasing
intervention in meal schedules. “The daily three-meal pattern, although
mentioned as a valid rule by almost all the subjects [of a recent
study,] is no longer a reality,” says the French anthropologist Claude
Fischler. Though the research on which this assertion is based is too
slight to be generalized, it indicates that 75 percent of American
families do not take breakfast together. Dinners eaten together are down
to three a week or less, and these meals usually last no more than
twenty minutes. Yet among urban, middle-class families, the number of
“contacts” between any family member and food might run as high as
twenty daily.30 Such figures hark back to the hunting-and-gathering
existence of our species, when food was eaten as it became available,
without much reference to situation or circumstance.</p>
<p>One fascinating expression of this modern American way of eating is
found in what we know is consumed and what people recall they have
consumed. Whereas the Department of Agriculture figures demonstrate that
we dispose of about 3,200 calories per capita per day, the average white
female adult, for example, can recall, when asked what she ate on the
previous day, only 1,560 calories, a noticeably low average, and less
than half the “disappearance” figure.31 Since average weight has risen
steadily in this country, these recall data are difficult to accept as
accurate. They suggest a pattern of ragged and discontinuous but very
frequent snacks that are surely forgotten by those who do the
eating.</p>
<p>Sucrose fits snugly into the picture, as the facts concerning
sweetened frozen-milk products, baked goods, and soft drinks
demonstrate. The “desserts” or baked goods together with beverages (more
commonly than not, soft drinks) constitute brief, meal-like
interventions during the day, which further erode the traditional
three-meal pattern. Enlarged mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks have
the effect of making the meals on either side more snacklike.</p>
<p>In short, it would appear that the meal structure—the “paradigmatics”
and “syntagmatics” of ingestion—is dissolving. To what extent this is
true for any given social group in any given western country is, of
course, unknown; but it is clear that the history of sugar consumption
predates—and in certain ways prefigures—the spread of unscheduled eating
as an aspect of modern life.</p>
<p>There is yet one other way in which sugar has affected the
modernization of consumption. The high sucrose content of many prepared
and processed foods that do not taste sweet (such as flour-dredged
meats, poultry, and fish that are baked, broiled, or deep-fried) is an
important source of the increase in sucrose consumption and
substantiates the astonishing versatility of sucrose. When used in
non-yeast-raised baked goods, we are told, “texture, grain and crumb
became smoother, softer and whiter. . . . This tenderizing effect of
sugars has long been recognized.”32 Sucrose also supplies “body” to soft
drinks, because “a heavy liquid is more appealing to the mouth than
water.”33 Sugar inhibits staleness in bread—“shelf life” is important in
a society that wants its supermarkets open twenty-four hours a day for
“convenience”—stabilizes the chemical content of salt, mitigates the
acidity of catsup, serves as a medium for yeast. In all of these uses,
its sweetness is largely irrelevant; indeed, many food manufacturers
would dearly love a chemical having all of the qualities of sucrose
without the calories and, in some cases, even without the sweetness.34
That is how far we have come since the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of these many virtues, the fate of sucrose is by no
means entirely assured. In the last decade, yet another sugar,
high-fructose corn syrup, has been making inroads into the sugar market,
particularly among prepared-food manufacturers. The most crushing blow
came when Coca-Cola partly replaced sucrose with HFCS; it seems probable
that other defeats will follow.35 At any rate, corn syrups are cutting
into the consumption of other sugars and will probably do so more and
more.</p>
<p>While per-capita sucrose use in the United States has hovered for
some time now around the hundred-pounds-per-year level, the consumption
of other sweeteners has risen steadily for at least seventy years. (This
is one reason why the somewhat sanctimonious assertions that “sugar
consumption” has not risen—here meaning sucrose consumption—usually
trumpeted by either sugar-corporation representatives or well-sweetened
professors of nutrition, must be viewed with reserve.) Thus the
per-capita “disappearance” figure for all nondietary sugars (i.e.,
sugars not occurring naturally, as in fruits) is nearly 130 pounds per
year. If disappearance is the same as consumption, then the daily
per-capita total nondietary consumption of sugars is nearly six ounces
per day.</p>
<p>The fact that the eater does not perceive much of this sugar as sweet
has two aspects. First, the sucrose may be used in small enough
proportions so that its taste is undiscernible—though doubtless there is
much individual variation in taste sensitivity to sweetness. Second, it
is probable that sweetness is perceived less when it is not expected,
noticed less in foods that are not considered “sweet.” If we include
nonsucrose sweeteners like HFCS in this consumption picture, the
situation gives rise to what one scholar has called “the
interconvertibility factor,”36 such that more and more edible substances
are becoming more and more substitutable. The German experiments with
deriving edible substances from naturally occurring petroleum during
World War II were, then, only harbingers of the future. This same
scholar suggests that the margarine/butter dyad is one of the oldest
“analogue relationships,”37 in which an unlikely food eventually becomes
partly indistinguishable from the product it imitates; the sucrose/HFCS
dyad gives rise to comparable questions. Whether worldwide, in national
markets, or in class-divided consumption patterns, the rivalries between
sucrose and other caloric and noncaloric sweeteners, like the rivalry
between dairy and nondairy products, are by no means fully understood.
At such nodal points of change, culture and technology, culture and
economics, culture and politics are in confrontation. And some of the
issues to which the recent success of HFCS has given rise—to note again
only the most significant such example for the present argument—will not
be fully settled in the lifetime of any of us.</p>
<p>From the very beginning of this book, my argument has been that
sugar—sucrose—has to be viewed in its multiple functions, and as a
culturally defined good. I have emphasized its unusual symbolic
“carrying power,” a symbolic weight that endured among the rich and
powerful until sucrose became common, cheap, and desired, when it spread
widely through the working classes of all western nations, carrying with
it many of its older meanings but also acquiring new ones. The affective
weight of sweetness, always considerable, was not so much diminished as
qualitatively changed by its abundance. The good life, the rich life,
the full life—was the sweet life.</p>
<p>The advent of margarine, invented by the French chemist Mège Mouriès
but made into a world commodity by the Dutch, can be counterposed to the
history of sucrose in symbolically interesting ways. As we have seen,
the gradual erosion of complex-carbohydrate consumption has been from
two sides—sugars on one, fats on the other. These foods occur together
in such items as milk desserts; they are epitomized among liquids by
condensed milk, among semisolids by ice cream, and among solids by
chocolate candy. In the last half-century or so, sugar-fat combinations
have taken two other important industrially processed forms: in
salty-food/sweet-drink combinations (hamburgers with Coca-Cola, hot dogs
with orange soda, pastrami with celery tonic), and in the combination of
sweet, cold drinks with deep-fried items in which sugar figures in the
exterior coating. These latter represent a special triumph of
situationally conditioned taste over nutrition. The fat side is
advertised with words like “juicy,” “succulent,” “hot,” “luscious,”
“savory,” “rich,” “satisfying,” and “finger-licking good.” The sugar
side is touted with words like “crisp,” “fresh,” “invigorating,” “icy,”
“wholesome,” “refreshing,” and “vibrant.” These sets of words are
counterposed in the language of commercial attraction.38</p>
<p>The combination of sugars and fats, as food choice or preference, is
a very important one.</p>
<p>Richness in diet is frequently associated with fat and sugar in the
diet and “eating out” with fast foods and snack foods. The latter also
not only are identified with high fat and high sugar but reflect “fast”
as part of the life style and, in some respects, reinforce fast living.
. . . Fat and sugar are more than functional aids to shelf life; they
are equally associated with the richness of food and, therefore, its
acceptability.39</p>
<p>The food technologist’s lexicon for the uses of sugar and fat pays
special attention to sugar’s way of making foods more palatable. Baked
products are judged by their quality of “go-away.” Proper proportions of
sugar and fat result in “good go-away”—which means that the mouthful of
food can be swallowed without leaving the inside of the mouth coated
with fat particles. The help of sugar in achieving good go-away is
vital. It is now permissible to add up to 10 percent sugar to
manufactured peanut butters in the U.S. No other food, they say, has
such poor go-away as peanut butter; sugar improves its go-away
marvelously. Soft-drink manufacturers, substituting saccharin for sugar,
struggle with a comparable problem. Gums of various sorts are introduced
to make the soft drink taste heavier in the mouth, the way sugar would
make it heavy, since the mouth—food technologists tell us—prefers
liquids that are heavier than water. The term “mouth feel” is used to
describe the felt “body” of liquids (like soft drinks), to which sugar
supplies agreeable weight or balance. It can be seen that this
terminology is not really concerned with taste: texture, perhaps, or
“feel,” but not taste.</p>
<p>• • •</p>
<p>These observations suggest that the lay person’s awareness of the
nature of his/her own perceptions of food is undeveloped. Much that is
subsumed under “taste” in modern eating is not taste at all, but
something else. The reaction to deep-fried foods covered with batter is
probably a good illustration. The inclusion of sugar in the batter
facilitates caramelization, sealing the food so that it can be cooked
without losing its own fatty and liquid contents. Whatever sucrose or
other sugars are used, their sweetness function is supplanted by one of
sugar’s other food uses; sweetness in the meal comes from the beverages
with which such deep-fried foods are consumed. This is not the place to
develop further some of the sociopsychological implications of the
heightened uses of convenience and fast foods, with their combinations
of cold, effervescent, usually stimulant sweet liquids with hot fatty
proteins and complex carbohydrates, often “finished” with sucrose-rich
batters. Perhaps people associate the “rich life” with such foods, and
perhaps the oral stimuli they provide “have numerous pleasant
associations that relate to early life experiences.”40</p>
<p>I have tried to suggest some of the ways that modern eating habits
have altered the place of sugar. While many of the world’s peoples are
still learning to eat sucrose in the ways and quantities that marked its
spread through England and the West, others are moving into a wholly
different period of eating history. Roland Barthes argued that the
famous place of food in French life has been qualitatively changing, and
his argument seems to hold for modern societies generally:</p>
<p>Food serves as a sign not only for themes, but also for situations;
and this, all told, means for a way of life that is emphasized, much
more than expressed, by it. To eat is a behavior that develops beyond
its own ends, replacing, summing up, and signalizing other behaviors,
and it is precisely for these reasons that it is a sign. What are these
other behaviors? Today, we might almost say that “polysemia” of food
characterizes modernities; in the past, only festive occasions were
signalized by food in any positive organized manner. But today, work
also has its own kind of food (on the level of a sign, that is):
energy-giving and light food is experienced as a very sign of, rather
than only a help toward, participation in modern life. . . . We are
witnessing an extraordinary expansion of the areas associated with food:
food is becoming incorporated into an ever-lengthening list of
situations. This adaptation is usually made in the name of hygiene and
better living, but in reality, to stress this fact once more, food is
also charged with signifying the situation in which it is used. It has a
twofold value, being nutrition as well as protocol, and its value as
protocol becomes increasingly more important as soon as the basic needs
are satisfied, as they are in France. In other words, we might say that
in contemporary French society, food has a constant tendency to
transform itself into situation.41</p>
<p>The peculiar versatility of sugars has led to their remarkable
permeation through so many foods and into nearly all cuisines. But the
subsidiary or additional uses of some sugars, particularly sucrose, have
become more important, not less, as prepared foods inside and outside
the home grow more popular. The function of sweetness in the patterning
of ingestion has changed, even while the nonsweetening uses of sucrose
and corn sweeteners have expanded. That sugars not only have remained
important in our new diets and eating habits but have become
proportionately much more so is additional evidence of their
versatility.</p>
<p>The track sugar has left in modern history is one involving masses of
people and resources, thrown into productive combination by social,
economic, and political forces that were actively remaking the entire
world. The technical and human energies these forces released were
unequaled in world history, and many of their consequences have been
beneficial. But the place of sugars in the modern diet, the strangely
imperceptible attrition of people’s control over what they eat, with the
eater becoming the consumer of a mass-produced food rather than the
controller and cook of it, the manifold forces that work to hold
consumption in channels predictable enough to maintain food-industry
profits, the paradoxical narrowing of individual choice, and of
opportunity to resist this trend, in the guise of increasing
convenience, ease, and “freedom”—these factors suggest the extent to
which we have surrendered our autonomy over our food.</p>
<p>Subtle encouragements to be modern, efficient, up to date, and
individualistic have become steadily more sophisticated. We are what we
eat; in the modern western world, we are made more and more into what we
eat, whenever forces we have no control over persuade us that our
consumption and our identity are linked.</p>
<p>More and more of the so-called “creative” people who design products
are not in the laboratories and, therefore, least open to technological
and scientific constraints. Marketing executives have found that ideas
generated by nontechnical people are more realistically associated with
markets and are less inhibited by restraints which would concern
technical people. As a consequence new product funds tend to be invested
more in services associated with advertising than those of technical
groups. . . .</p>
<p>The effect of such product development practices on consumption is
important. . . . If we define what has been referred to as richness as a
concomitant of flavor, then the repeated incorporation of “richness”
into a new product would not only provide regular reinforcement for
recognizing “richness,” but, with all of its omnipresent associations
promoted as good, result in increased consumption of fat and sugar. . .
. There is supposedly a safety factor associated with fat consumption
and probably also with sweetener consumption. But the statistics, at
least on the average, support the conclusion that as preparation of food
moves from kitchen to factory, the perception of richness and the
continuing emphasis on richness, certainly in snack foods, has
contributed not only to reinforcement but also the resultant increased
consumption. . . . It would appear that such increases due to the
relative inelasticity of demand for food could seriously unbalance
nutrition. . . . What is perhaps more disturbing is the degree to which
the discretionary limits of consumers are being reduced by the system
which designs food like any other consumer item. . . .42</p>
<p>Lionel Tiger, an anthropologist proceeding from a somewhat different
perspective, arrives at similarly critical conclusions. He points out
that as belief systems in modern societies become more secularized,
individuals change the way they view their own safety, and an
“extermination model,” as he calls it, results. That is, individuals
attach to such environmental risks as exposure to radiation or
chemicals, and perhaps especially to eating, a statistical reckoning of
their life chances. To believe one has an X-percent chance of developing
cancer after Y number of cigarettes is rather different, says Tiger,
“from the relatively straightforward connection to a theological
dominant in terms of whom the rules of right and wrong are plain and the
results of particular actions relatively clearly identifiable.”43 But,
perhaps more important, this change to a statistical, epidemiological
approach to risk burdens the individual with inhibitions in regard to
eating:</p>
<p>The decision about personal destiny, as far as health is concerned,
is stressed directly on the individual, despite the fact that everywhere
in the community blandishments exist to increase individual risk of
disease development: for example, the countless public feeding
facilities such as the fast food outlets who rely unduly on foods that
are not highly desirable from the disease prevention point of view. So
while the individual is faced with an entirely personal decision to
take, he or she must take it in a social context which is relatively
provocative in a destructive sense, because of the community’s
indifference to or lack of information about suitable patterns of
eating, or the vested interest of persons and groups committed to
maintaining advantageous positions in the economy which depend upon less
than medically desirable eating habits.44</p>
<p>Fischler, the French anthropologist, appalled by the way “snacking”
has supplanted meal taking (it is clear that the very word offends him,
and he declares proudly that there is no equivalent in French!), speaks
of the replacement of gastronomy by “gastro-anomie,” and raises
questions about the trend toward desocialized, aperiodic eating. One
senses today a quickening of such diffusion, a speeding up, even in
large, ancient societies that were apparently once resistant to such
processes, such as China and Japan. The changing nature of the
industrial workday, the cheap calories (both in cost and in resource
use) provided by sucrose, and the special-interest groups intent on
pushing its consumption45 make such cumulative pressure difficult to
resist on an individual or a group educational basis.</p>
<p>Food may be no more than a sign of yet larger, more fundamental
processes—or so it seems. Diet is remade because the entire productive
character of societies is recast and, with it, the very nature of time,
of work, and of leisure. If these occurrences raise questions for us and
about us—if they seem to others, as they seem to me, to have escaped
from human control even though they are very much the outcome of
organized human intent—then we need to understand them far better than
we do. We may aspire to change the world, rather than merely to observe
it. But we need to understand how it works in order to change it in
socially effective ways.</p>
<p>We anthropologists for too long have paradoxically denied the way the
world has changed and continues changing, as well as our
ability—responsibility, even—to contribute to a broad understanding of
the changes. If we have been betrayed by our own romanticism, we have
also lagged in recognizing and asserting our strengths. Those strengths
continue to lie in fieldwork (there is little in this book, I confess),
and in a full appreciation of humanity’s historical nature as a species.
Anthropological interest in how person, substance, and act are
integrated meaningfully can be pursued in the modern world as well as in
the primitive one. Studies of the everyday in modern life, of the
changing character of mundane matters like food, viewed from the joined
perspective of production and consumption, use and function, and
concerned with the differential emergence and variation of meaning, may
be one way to inspirit a discipline now dangerously close to losing its
sense of purpose.</p>
<p>To move from so minor a matter as sugar to the state of the world in
general may seem like yet another chorus of the bone song—the hip bone’s
connected to the leg bone, etc. But we have already seen how sucrose,
this “favored child of capitalism”—Fernando Ortiz’s lapidary
phrase46—epitomized the transition from one kind of society to another.
The first sweetened cup of hot tea to be drunk by an English worker was
a significant historical event, because it prefigured the transformation
of an entire society, a total remaking of its economic and social basis.
We must struggle to understand fully the consequences of that and
kindred events, for upon them was erected an entirely different
conception of the relationship between producers and consumers, of the
meaning of work, of the definition of self, of the nature of things.
What commodities are, and what commodities mean, would thereafter be
forever different. And for that same reason, what persons are, and what
being a person means, changed accordingly. In understanding the
relationship between commodity and person, we unearth anew the history
of ourselves.</p>
<p>A Negro Servant from America Cutting Sugar Cane first appeared in
Father J.-B. Labat’s Nouveau voyage aux isles d’Amérique (1722). The
artist’s choice of exotic costume was a common affectation of the time.
In fact, cane-cutting gangs worked in rags, under the direction of a
“driver” who held a whip in his hand. The illustration from Ten Views of
Antigua, on the following page, provides a more realistic view of field
labor on a sugar plantation. (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris)</p>
<p>This careful display of tropical plants, from William Rhind’s A
History of the Vegetable Kingdom (1865), includes sugar cane, somewhat
exaggerated in height and thickness but otherwise accurately
illustrated. Interestingly, the only human figures are shown next to the
cane; one appears to be cutting cane, and both are depicted as
black.</p>
<p>One of W. Clark’s Ten Views of Antigua (1823), which shows a slave
gang hoeing and planting sugar cane. Though this drawing was made only a
few years before the Emancipation in the British West Indies, the highly
organized, almost industrial character of field labor probably typified
the slave-based Caribbean plantation from its very beginnings more than
three centuries earlier. (British Library)</p>
<p>This fanciful drawing, from De Americae (Part V, 1595), by the
engraver Theodor de Bry, illustrates a text by Girolamo Benzoni on the
sugar-cane industry in Santo Domingo. Benzoni, an Italian adventurer,
visited the New World in the years 1541–55, and his account, La Historia
del mondo nuovo (1565), is one of the earliest we have for the
Caribbean. In this depiction the workers resemble Classical Greeks more
than Africans or Indians, and the cane processing is confusingly
presented: a “mill” at the upper right shows only a sluice and a water
wheel, while the device inside the shed is an edge-roller, long employed
in Europe to crush olives and apples and in India and elsewhere to crush
cane, but whose use is not documented for the New World.</p>
<p>This engraving, from César de Rochefort’s Histoire naturelle et
morale des Antilles (1681), is signed “A.W. delin” (presumably
delineavit), but A.W. is unidentified. The kind of sugar mill design it
shows was retained for centuries.</p>
<p>Two interior views of nineteenth-century sugar boiling-houses, by R.
Bridgens (top) and W. Clark (bottom). Once again, the time-conscious,
disciplined, industrial character of sugar manufacture is suggested.
(British Library)</p>
<p>A contemporary sugar mill in the Dominican Republic. Closely
resembling their predecessors going back several centuries, such mills
are still to be found in the Caribbean, as well as on the South American
mainland. The final product is a coarse brown sugar popular in the
traditional cuisines of many regions. (Bonnie Sharpe)</p>
<p>The Sugar Hogshead, by E. T. Parris (1846). Sugar shipped in great
barrels such as this was dispensed by local grocers. Parris, a
sentimental and rather undistinguished artist, painted many such London
scenes. The children, drawn like flies to the now-empty barrel, reveal
nicely how important sugar had become in the nineteenth-century British
diet.</p>
<p>These elegant nineteenth-century desserts, illustrations from the
cookbooks of the French bakers Dubois and Bernard, reveal the niche in
haute cuisine that developed after sugar lost its special symbolic
potency and became a relatively inexpensive commodity. (Centre de
Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>Contemporary renderings, in sugar paste, of miniature figures in
nineteenth-century costume. (Top: Laurent Sully Jaulmes/Musée des Arts
Décoratifs/Centre de Documentation du Sucre. Bottom: Philippe
Rousselet/Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>All Saints’ Day, Día de los Muertos, is celebrated in Mexico with
candy skulls, tombs, and wreaths, and an astounding display of
artistic/culinary ingenuity. The artistic and ritual association between
sugar and death is not a Mexican monopoly; in much of Europe, candied
funeral treats are popular. The link between Easter and sugar is neatly
contrastive. (C. Gibier/Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>This sugar mold, which includes a bust of George V, was prepared for
the king’s silver jubilee (1935). It harks back to the work of royal
sugar bakers of earlier centuries.(C. Gibier/Musée des Arts
Décoratifs/Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>A scale model (1:80) by sugar baker Mary Ford and her husband of the
British royal state coach, fashioned for the silver jubilee of Queen
Elizabeth II (1977). (C. Gibier/Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>The Cathedral of Notre Dame at Amiens, in scale (1:80), created in
1977 by sugar baker Hubert Lahm. Twenty thousand sugar cubes and 176
pounds of glaze were used in the construction of this work, which stands
59 inches high, 70 inches long, and 36 inches wide. (Centre de
Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>A model sailing ship on an elaborate base, entirely fashioned from
sugar paste by baker Hiroomi Tatematsu.(Centre de Documentation du
Sucre)</p>
<p>This model medieval castle was constructed by English chefs at a West
Sussex restaurant (1977). It probably typifies the work of royal sugar
bakers of an earlier era. (Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>This sculpture, Caesar’s Thumb, suggests how art and appetite
intersect in the history of sugar. Though carried to levels of extreme
delicacy in some works, sugar paste can also be employed as if it were
clay or stone. (C. Gibier/Centre de Documentation du Sucre)</p>
<p>Etienne Tholoniat, a great French sugar baker, puts the finishing
touches on a life-size chocolate nude with spun-sugar hair. She is lying
on a bed of six hundred sugar roses. (Centre de Documentation du
Sucre)</p>
