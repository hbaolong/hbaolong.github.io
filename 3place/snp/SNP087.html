<h4 id="chapter-89">Chapter 89</h4>
<p>Everything suffered. Everything became sun-bleached and
weather-beaten. The lifeboat, the raft until it was lost, the tarpaulin,
the stills, the rain catchers, the plastic bags, the lines, the
blankets, the net-all became worn, stretched, slack, cracked, dried,
rotted, torn, discoloured. What was orange became whitish orange. What
was smooth became rough. What was rough became smooth. What was sharp
became blunt. What was whole became tattered. Rubbing fish skins and
turtle fat on things, as I did, greasing them a little, made no
difference. The salt went on eating everything with its million hungry
mouths. As for the sun, it roasted everything. It kept Richard Parker in
partial subjugation. It picked skeletons clean and fired them to a
gleaming white. It burned off my clothes and would have burned off my
skin, dark though it was, had I not protected it beneath blankets and
propped-up turtle shells. When the heat was unbearable I took a bucket
and poured sea water on myself; sometimes the water was so warm it felt
like syrup. The sun also took care of all smells. I don’t remember any
smells. Or only the smell of the spent hand-flare shells. They smelled
like cumin, did I mention that? I don’t even remember what Richard
Parker smelled like.</p>
<p>We perished away. It happened slowly, so that I didn’t notice it all
the time. But I noticed it regularly. We were two emaciated mammals,
parched and starving. Richard Parker’s fur lost its lustre, and some of
it even fell away from his shoulders and haunches. He lost a lot of
weight, became a skeleton in an oversized bag of faded fur. I, too,
withered away, the moistness sucked out of me, my bones showing plainly
through my thin flesh. I began to imitate Richard Parker in sleeping an
incredible number of hours. It wasn’t proper sleep, but a state of
semi-consciousness in which daydreams and reality were nearly
indistinguishable. I made much use of my dream rag. These are the last
pages of my diary:</p>
<p>Today saw a shark bigger than any I’ve seen till now. A primeval
monster twenty feet long. Striped. A tiger shark-very dangerous. Circled
us. Feared it would attack. Have survived one tiger; thought I would die
at the hands of another. Did not attack. Floated away. Cloudy weather,
but nothing. No rain. Only morning greyness. Dolphins. Tried to gaff
one. Found I could not stand. R.P. weak and ill-tempered. Am so weak, if
he attacks I won’t be able to defend myself. Simply do not have the
energy to blow whistle. Calm and burning hot day. Sun beating without
mercy. Feel my brains are boiling inside my head. Feel horrid. Prostrate
body and soul. Will die soon. R.P. breathing but not moving. Will die
too. Will not kill me. Salvation. An hour of heavy, delicious, beautifal
rain. Filled mouth, filled bags and cans, filled body till it could not
take another drop. Let myself be soaked to rinse off salt. Crawled over
to see R.P. Not reacting. Body curled, tail flat. Coat clumpy with
wetness. Smaller when wet. Bony. Touched him for first time ever. To see
if dead. Not. Body still warm. Amazing to touch him. Even in this
condition, firm, muscular, alive. Touched him and fur shuddered as if I
were a gnat. At length, head half in water stirred. Better to drink than
to drown. Better sign still: tail jumped. Threw piece of turtle meat in
front of nose. Nothing. At last half rose-to drink. Drank and drank.
Ate. Did not rise fully. Spent a good hour licking himself all over.
Slept. It’s no use. Today I die. I will die today. I die.</p>
<p>This was my last entry. I went on from there, endured, but without
noting it. Do you see these invisible spirals on the imargins of the
page? I thought I would run out of paper. It was the pens that ran
out.</p>
