<h4 id="chapter-82">Chapter 82</h4>
<p>I kept rainwater and the water I collected from the solar stills in
the locker, out of Richard Parker’s sight, in the three 50-litre plastic
bags. I sealed them with string. Those plastic bags wouldn’t have been
more precious to me had they contained gold, sapphires, rubies and
diamonds. I worried incessantly about them. My worst nightmare was that
I would open the locker one morning and find that all three had spilled
or, worse still, had split. To forestall such a tragedy, I wrapped them
in blankets to keep them from rubbing against the metal hull of the
lifeboat, and I moved them as little as possible to reduce wear and
tear. But I fretted over the necks of the bags. Would the string not
wear them thin? How would I seal the bags if their necks were torn? When
the going was good, when the rain was torrential, when the bags had as
much water as I thought they could take, I filled the bailing cups, the
two plastic buckets, the two multi-purpose plastic containers, the three
beakers and the empty cans of water (which I now preciously kept). Next
I filled all the plastic vomit bags, sealing them by twisting them shut
and making a knot. After that, if the rain was still coming down, I used
myself as a container. I stuck the end of the rain-catcher tube in my
mouth and I drank and I drank and I drank. I always added a little sea
water to Richard Parker’s fresh water, in a greater proportion in the
days following a rainfall, in a lesser during periods of drought. On
occasion, in the early days, he dipped his head overboard, sniffed the
sea and took a few sips, but quickly he stopped doing it. Still, we
barely got by. The scarcity of fresh water was the single most constant
source of anxiety and suffering throughout our journey. Of whatever food
I caught, Richard Parker took the lion’s share, so to speak. I had
little choice in the matter. He was immediately aware when I landed a
turtle or a dorado or a shark, and I had to give quickly and generously.
I think I set world records for sawing open the belly shells of turtles.
As for fish, they were hewn to pieces practically while they were still
flopping about. If I got to be so indiscriminate about what I ate, it
was not simply because of appalling hunger; it was also plain rush.
Sometimes I just didn’t have the time to consider what was before me. It
either went into my mouth that instant or was lost to Richard Parker,
who was pawing and stamping the ground and huffing impatiently on the
edge of his territory. It came as an unmistakable indication to me of
how low I had sunk the day I noticed, with a pinching of the heart, that
I ate like an animal, that this noisy, frantic, unchewing wolfing-down
of mine was exactly the way Richard Parker ate.</p>
