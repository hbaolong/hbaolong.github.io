<h4 id="chapter-37">Chapter 37</h4>
<p>The ship sank. It made a sound like a monstrous metallic burp. Things
bubbled at the surface and then vanished. Everything was screaming: the
sea, the wind, my heart. From the lifeboat I saw something in the water.
I cried, “Richard Parker, is that you? It’s so hard to see. Oh, that
this rain would stop! Richard Parker? Richard Parker? Yes, it is
you!“</p>
<p>I could see his head. He was struggling to stay at the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>“Jesus, Mary, Muhammad and Vishnu, how good to see you, Richard
Parker! Don’t give up, please. Come to the lifeboat. Do you hear this
whistle? Treeeeee! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! You heard right. Swim, swim!
You’re a strong swimmer. It’s not a hundred feet.“</p>
<p>He had seen me. He looked panic-stricken. He started swimming my way.
The water about him was shifting wildly. He looked small and
helpless.</p>
<p>“Richard Parker, can you believe what has happened to us? Tell me
it’s a bad dream. Tell me it’s not real. Tell me I’m still in my bunk on
the Tsimtsum and I’m tossing and turning and soon I’ll wake up from this
nightmare. Tell me I’m still happy. Mother, my tender guardian angel of
wisdom, where are you? And you, Father, my loving worrywart? And you,
Ravi, dazzling hero of my childhood? Vishnu preserve me, Allah protect
me, Christ save me, I can’t bear it! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! “</p>
<p>I was not wounded in any part of my body, but I had never experienced
such intense pain, such a ripping of the nerves, such an ache of the
heart. He would not make it. He would drown. He was hardly moving
forward and his movements were weak. His nose and mouth kept dipping
underwater. Only his eyes were steadily on me.</p>
<p>“What are you doing, Richard Parker? Don’t you love life? Keep
swimming then! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! Kick with your legs. Kick!
Kick! Kick!“</p>
<p>He stirred in the water and made to swim.</p>
<p>“And what of my extended family-birds, beasts and reptiles? They too
have drowned. Every single thing I value in life has been destroyed. And
I am allowed no explanation? I am to suffer hell without any account
from heaven? In that case, what is the purpose of reason, Richard
Parker? Is it no more than to shine at practicalities-the getting of
food, clothing and shelter? Why can’t reason give greater answers? Why
can we throw a question further than we can pull in an answer? Why such
a vast net if there’s so little fish to catch?“</p>
<p>His head was barely above water. He was looking up, taking in the sky
one last time. There was a lifebuoy in the boat with a rope tied to it.
I took hold of it and waved it in the air.</p>
<p>“Do you see this lifebuoy, Richard Parker? Do you see it? Catch hold
of it! Humpf ! I’ll try again. Humpf !“</p>
<p>He was too far. But the sight of the lifebuoy flying his way gave him
hope. He revived and started beating the water with vigorous, desperate
strokes.</p>
<p>“That’s right! One, two. One, two. One, two. Breathe when you can.
Watch for the waves. Treeeeee! Treeeeee! Treeeeee! “</p>
<p>My heart was chilled to ice. I felt ill with grief. But there was no
time for frozen shock. It was shock in activity. Something in me did not
want to give up on life, was unwilling to let go, wanted to fight to the
very end. Where that part of me got the heart, I don’t know.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it ironic, Richard Parker? We’re in hell yet still we’re
afraid of immortality. Look how close you are! Treeeeee! Treeeeee!
Treeeeee! Hurrah, hurrah! You’ve made it, Richard Parker, you’ve made
it. Catch! Humpf !“</p>
<p>I threw the lifebuoy mightily. It fell in the water right in front of
him. With his last energies he stretched forward and took hold of
it.</p>
<p>“Hold on tight, I’ll pull you in. Don’t let go. Pull with your eyes
while I pull with my hands. In a few seconds you’ll be aboard and we’ll
be together. Wait a second. Together? We’ll be together . Have I gone
mad?“</p>
<p>I woke up to what I was doing. I yanked on the rope.</p>
<p>“Let go of that lifebuoy, Richard Parker! Let go, I said. I don’t
want you here, do you understand? Go somewhere else. Leave me alone. Get
lost. Drown! Drown!“</p>
<p>He was kicking vigorously with his legs. I grabbed an oar. I thrust
it at him, meaning to push him away. I missed and lost hold of the oar.
I grabbed another oar. I dropped it in an oarlock and pulled as hard as
I could, meaning to move the lifeboat away. All I accomplished was to
turn the lifeboat a little, bringing one end closer to Richard Parker. I
would hit him on the head! I lifted the oar in the air. He was too fast.
He reached up and pulled himself aboard.</p>
<p>“Oh my God!“</p>
<p>Ravi was right. Truly I was to be the next goat. I had a wet,
trembling, half-drowned, heaving and coughing three-year-old adult
Bengal tiger in my lifeboat. Richard Parker rose unsteadily to his feet
on the tarpaulin, eyes blazing as they met mine, ears laid tight to his
head, all weapons drawn. His head was the size and colour of the
lifebuoy, with teeth. I turned around, stepped over the zebra and threw
myself overboard.</p>
