<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>We commonly say in the trade that the most dangerous animal in a zoo
is Man. In a general way we mean how our species’ excessive
predatoriness has made the entire planet our prey. More specifically, we
have in mind the people who feed fishhooks to the otters, razors to the
bears, apples with small nails in them to the elephants and hardware
variations on the theme: ballpoint pens, paper clips, safety pins,
rubber bands, combs, coffee spoons, horseshoes, pieces of broken glass,
rings, brooches and other jewellery (and not just cheap plastic bangles:
gold wedding bands, too), drinking straws, plastic cutlery, ping-pong
balls, tennis balls and so on. The obituary of zoo animals that have
died from being fed foreign bodies would include gorillas, bison,
storks, rheas, ostriches, seals, sea lions, big cats, bears, camels,
elephants, monkeys, and most every variety of deer, ruminant and
songbird. Among zookeepers, Goliath’s death is famous; he was a bull
elephant seal, a great big venerable beast of two tons, star of his
European zoo, loved by all visitors. He died of internal bleeding after
someone fed him a broken beer bottle. The cruelty is often more active
and direct. The literature contains reports on the many torments
inflicted upon zoo animals: a shoebill dying of shock after having its
beak smashed with a hammer; a moose stag losing its beard, along with a
strip of flesh the size of an index finger, to a visitor’s knife (this
same moose was poisoned six months later); a monkey’s arm broken after
reaching out for proffered nuts; a deer’s antlers attacked with a
hacksaw; a zebra stabbed with a sword; and other assaults on other
animals, with walking sticks, umbrellas, hairpins, knitting needles,
scissors and whatnot, often with an aim to taking an eye out or to
injuring sexual parts. Animals are also poisoned. And there are
indecencies even more bizarre: onanists breaking a sweat on monkeys,
ponies, birds; a religious freak who cut a snake’s head off; a deranged
man who took to urinating in an elk’s mouth. At Pondicherry we were
relatively fortunate. We were spared the sadists who plied European and
American zoos. Nonetheless, our golden agouti vanished, stolen by
someone who ate it, Father suspected. Various birds-pheasants, peacocks,
macaws-lost feathers to people greedy for their beauty. We caught a man
with a knife climbing into the pen for mouse deer; he said he was going
to punish evil Ravana (who in the Ramayana took the form of a deer when
he kidnapped Sita, Rama’s consort). Another man was nabbed in the
process of stealing a cobra. He was a snake charmer whose own snake had
died. Both were saved: the cobra from a life of servitude and bad music,
and the man from a possible death bite. We had to deal on occasion with
stone throwers, who found the animals too placid and wanted a reaction.
And we had the lady whose sari was caught by a lion. She spun like a
yo-yo, choosing mortal embarrassment over mortal end. The thing was, it
wasn’t even an accident. She had leaned over, thrust her hand in the
cage and waved the end of her sari in the lion’s face, with what intent
we never figured out. She was not injured; there were many fascinated
men who came to her assistance. Her flustered explanation to Father was,
“Whoever heard of a lion eating a cotton sari? I thought lions were
carnivores.“ Our worst troublemakers were the visitors who gave food to
the animals. Despite our vigilance, Dr. Atal, the zoo veterinarian,
could tell by the number of animals with digestive disturbances which
had been the busy days at the zoo. He called “tidbit-itis“ the cases of
enteritis or gastritis due to too many carbohydrates, especially sugar.
Sometimes we wished people had stuck to sweets. People have a notion
that animals can eat anything without the least consequence to their
health. Not so. One of our sloth bears became seriously ill with severe
hemorrhagic enteritis after being given fish that had gone putrid by a
man who was convinced he was doing a good deed. Just beyond the ticket
booth Father had painted on a wall in bright red letters the
question:</p>
<p>Do You Know Which is the Most Dangerous Animal in the Zoo?</p>
<p>An arrow pointed to a small curtain. There were so many eager,
curious hands that pulled at the curtain that we had to replace it
regularly. Behind it was a mirror. But I learned at my expense that
Father believed there was another animal even more dangerous than us,
and one that was extremely common, too, found on every continent, in
every habitat: the redoubtable species Animalus anthropomorphicus , the
animal as seen through human eyes. We’ve all met one, perhaps even owned
one. It is an animal that is “cute,“ “friendly,“ “loving,“ “devoted,“
“merry,“ “understanding.“ These animals lie in ambush in every toy store
and children’s zoo. Countless stories are told of them. They are the
pendants of those “vicious,“ “bloodthirsty,“ “depraved“ animals that
inflame the ire of the maniacs I have just mentioned, who vent their
spite on them with walking sticks and umbrellas. In both cases we look
at an animal and see a mirror. The obsession with putting ourselves at
the centre of everything is the bane not only of theologians but also of
zoologists. I learned the lesson that an animal is an animal,
essentially and practically removed from us, twice: once with Father and
once with Richard Parker. It was on a Sunday morning. I was quietly
playing on my own. Father called out.</p>
<p>“Children, come here.“</p>
<p>Something was wrong. His tone of voice set off a small alarm bell in
my head. I quickly reviewed my conscience. It was clear. Ravi must be in
trouble again. I wondered what he had done this time. I walked into the
living room. Mother was there. That was unusual. The disciplining of
children, like the tending of animals, was generally left to Father.
Ravi walked in last, guilt written all over his criminal face.</p>
<p>“Ravi, Piscine, I have a very important lesson for you today.“</p>
<p>“Oh really, is this necessary?“ interrupted Mother. Her face was
flushed. I swallowed. If Mother, normally so unruffled, so calm, was
worried, even upset, it meant we were in serious trouble. I exchanged
glances with Ravi.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is,“ said Father, annoyed. “It may very well save their
lives.“</p>
<p>Save our lives! It was no longer a small alarm bell that was ringing
in my head-they were big bells now, like the ones we heard from Sacred
Heart of Jesus Church, not far from the zoo. “But Piscine? He’s only
eight,“ Mother insisted. “He’s the one who worries me the most.“</p>
<p>“I’m innocent!“ I burst out. “It’s Ravi’s fault, whatever it is. He
did it!“</p>
<p>“What?“ said Ravi. “I haven’t done anything wrong.“ He gave me the
evil eye.</p>
<p>“Shush!“ said Father, raising his hand. He was looking at Mother.
“Gita, you’ve seen Piscine. He’s at that age when boys run around and
poke their noses everywhere.“</p>
<p>Me? A run-arounder? An everywhere-nose-poker? Not so, not so! Defend
me, Mother, defend me, I implored in my heart. But she only sighed and
nodded, a signal that the terrible business could proceed.</p>
<p>“Come with me,“ said Father. We set out like prisoners off to their
execution. We left the house, went through the gate, entered the zoo. It
was early and the zoo hadn’t opened yet to the public. Animal keepers
and groundskeepers were going about their work. I noticed Sitaram, who
oversaw the orang-utans, my favourite keeper. He paused to watch us go
by. We passed birds, bears, apes, monkeys, ungulates, the terrarium
house, the rhinos, the elephants, the giraffes. We came to the big cats,
our tigers, lions and leopards. Babu, their keeper, was waiting for us.
We went round and down the path, and he unlocked the door to the cat
house, which was at the centre of a moated island. We entered. It was a
vast and dim cement cavern, circular in shape, warm and humid, and
smelling of cat urine. All around were great big cages divided up by
thick, green, iron bars. A yellowish light filtered down from the
skylights. Through the cage exits we could see the vegetation of the
surrounding island, flooded with sunlight. The cages were empty-save
one: Mahisha, our Bengal tiger patriarch, a lanky, hulking beast of 550
pounds, had been detained. As soon as we stepped in, he loped up to the
bars of his cage and set off a full-throated snarl, ears flat against
his skull and round eyes fixed on Babu. The sound was so loud and fierce
it seemed to shake the whole cat house. My knees started quaking. I got
close to Mother. She was trembling, too. Even Father seemed to pause and
steady himself. Only Babu was indifferent to the outburst and to the
searing stare that bored into him like a drill. He had a tested trust in
iron bars. Mahisha started pacing to and fro against the limits of his
cage. Father turned to us. “What animal is this?“ he bellowed above
Mahisha’s snarling.</p>
<p>“It’s a tiger,“ Ravi and I answered in unison, obediently pointing
out the blindingly obvious.</p>
<p>“Are tigers dangerous?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father, tigers are dangerous.“</p>
<p>“Tigers are very dangerous,“ Father shouted. “I want you to
understand that you are never-under any circumstances-to touch a tiger,
to pet a tiger, to put your hands through the bars of a cage, even to
get close to a cage. Is that clear? Ravi?“</p>
<p>Ravi nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>“Piscine?“</p>
<p>I nodded even more vigorously. He kept his eyes on me. I nodded so
hard I’m surprised my neck didn’t snap and my head fall to the floor. I
would like to say in my own defence that though I may have
anthropomorphized the animals till they spoke fluent English, the
pheasants complaining in uppity British accents of their tea being cold
and the baboons planning their bank robbery getaway in the flat,
menacing tones of American gangsters, the fancy was always conscious. I
quite deliberately dressed wild animals in tame costumes of my
imagination. But I never deluded myself as to the real nature of my
playmates. My poking nose had more sense than that. I don’t know where
Father got the idea that his youngest son was itching to step into a
cage with a ferocious carnivore. But wherever the strange worry came
from-and Father was a worrier-he was clearly determined to rid himself
of it that very morning.</p>
<p>“I’m going to show you how dangerous tigers are,“ he continued. “I
want you to remember this lesson for the rest of your lives.“</p>
<p>He turned to Babu and nodded. Babu left. Malahisha’s eyes followed
him and did not move from the door he disappeared through. He returned a
few seconds later carrying a goat with its legs tied. Mother gripped me
from behind. Mahihisha’s snarl turned into a growl deep in the throat.
Babu unlocked, opened, entered, closed and locked a cage next to the
tiger’s cage. Bars and a trapdoor separated the two. Immediately Mahisha
was up against the dividing bars, pawing them. To his growling he now
added explosive, arrested woofs . Babu placed the goat on the floor; its
flanks were heaving violently, its tongue hung from its mouth, and its
eyes were spinning orbs. He untied its legs. The goat got to its feet.
Babu exited the cage in the same careful way he had entered it. The cage
had two floors, one level with us, the other at the back, higher by
about three feet, that led outside to the island. The goat scrambled to
this second level. Mahisha, now unconcerned with Babu, paralleled the
move in his cage in a fluid, effortless motion. He crouched and lay
still, his slowly moving tail the only sign of tension. Babu stepped up
to the trapdoor between the cages and started pulling it open. In
anticipation of satisfaction, Mahisha fell silent. I heard two things at
that moment: Father saying “Never forget this lesson“ as he looked on
grimly; and the bleating of the goat. It must have been bleating all
along, only we couldn’t hear it before. I could feel Mother’s hand
pressed against my pounding heart. The trapdoor resisted with sharp
cries. Mahisha was beside himself-he looked as if he were about to burst
through the bars. He seemed to hesitate between staying where he was, at
the place where his prey was closest but most certainly out of reach,
and moving to the ground level, further away but where the trapdoor was
located. He raised himself and started snarling again. The goat started
to jump. It jumped to amazing heights. I had no idea a goat could jump
so high. But the back of the cage was a high and smooth cement wall.
With sudden ease the trapdoor slid open. Silence fell again, except for
bleating and the click-click of the goat’s hooves against the floor. A
streak of black and orange flowed from one cage to the next. Normally
the big cats were not given food one day a week, to simulate conditions
in the wild. We found out later that Father had ordered that Mahisha not
be fed for three days. I don’t know if I saw blood before turning into
Mother’s arms or if I daubed it on later, in my memory, with a big
brush. But I heard. It was enoiugh to scare the living vegetarian
daylights out of me. Mother bundled us out. We were in hysterics. She
was incensed.</p>
<p>“How could you, Santosh? They’re children! They’ll be scarred for the
rest of their lives.“</p>
<p>Her voice was hot and tremulous. I could see she had tears in her
eyes. I felt better.</p>
<p>“Gita, my bird, it’s for their sake. What if Piscine had stuck his
hand through the bars of the cage one day to touch the pretty orange
fur? Better a goat than him, no?“</p>
<p>His voice was soft, nearly a whisper. He looked contrite. He never
called her “my bird“ in front of us. We were huddled around her. He
joined us. But the lesson was not over, though it was gentler after
that. Father led us to the lions and leopards.</p>
<p>“Once there was a madman in Australia who was a black belt in karate.
He wanted to prove himself against the lions. He lost. Badly. The
keepers found only half his body in the morning.“ “Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>The Himalayan bears and the sloth bears.</p>
<p>“One strike of the claws from these cuddly creatures and your innards
will be scooped out and splattered all over the ground.“ “Yes, Father.“
The hippos.</p>
<p>“With those soft, flabby mouths of theirs they’ll crush your body to
a bloody pulp. On land they can outrun you.“ “Yes, Father.“ The
hyenas.</p>
<p>“The strongest jaws in nature. Don’t think that they’re cowardly or
that they only eat carrion. They’re not and they don’t! They’ll start
eating you while you’re still alive.“ “Yes, Father.“ The
orang-utans.</p>
<p>“As strong as ten men. They’ll break your bones as if they were
twigs. I know some of them were once pets and you played with them when
they were small. But now they’re grown-up and wild and
unpredictable.“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>The ostrich.</p>
<p>“Looks flustered and silly, doesn’t it? Listen up: it’s one of the
most dangerous animals in a zoo. Just one kick and your back is broken
or your torso is crushed.“ “Yes, Father.“ The spotted deer.</p>
<p>“So pretty, aren’t they? If the male feels he has to, he’ll charge
you and those short little antlers will pierce you like daggers.“ “Yes,
Father.“ The Arabian camel.</p>
<p>“One slobbering bite and you’ve lost a chunk of flesh.“ “Yes,
Father.“ The black swans.</p>
<p>“With their beaks they’ll crack your skull. With their wings they’ll
break your arms.“ “Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>The smaller birds.</p>
<p>“They’ll cut through your fingers with their beaks as if they were
butter.“ “Yes, Father.“ The elephants.</p>
<p>“The most dangerous animal of all. More keepers and visitors are
killed by elephants than by any other animal in a zoo. A young elephant
will most likely dismember you and trample your body parts flat. That’s
what happened to one poor lost soul in a European zoo who got into the
elephant house through a window. An older, more patient animal will
squeeze you against a wall or sit on you. Sounds funny-but think about
it!“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>“There are animals we haven’t stopped by. Don’t think they’re
harmless. Life will defend itself no matter how small it is. Every
animal is ferocious and dangerous. It may not kill you, but it will
certainly injure you. It will scratch you and bite you, and you can look
forward to a swollen, pus-filled infection, a high fever and a ten-day
stay in the hospital.“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>We came to the guinea pigs, the only other animals besides Mahisha to
have been starved at Father’s orders, having been denied their previous
evening’s meal. Father unlocked the cage. He brought out a bag of feed
from his pocket and emptied it on the floor.</p>
<p>“You see these guinea pigs?“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>The creatures were trembling with weakness as they frantically
nibbled their kernels of corn.</p>
<p>“Well…“ He leaned down and scooped one up. “They’re not dangerous.“
The other guinea pigs scattered instantly. Father laughed. He handed me
the squealing guinea pig. He meant to end on a light note. The guinea
pig rested in my arms tensely. It was a young one. I went to the cage
and carefully lowered it to the floor. It rushed to its mother’s side.
The only reason these guinea pigs weren’t dangerous-didn’t draw blood
with their teeth and claws-was that they were practically domesticated.
Otherwise, to grab a wild guinea pig with your bare hands would be like
taking hold of a knife by the blade. The lesson was over. Ravi and I
sulked and gave Father the cold shoulder for a week. Mother ignored him
too. When I went by the rhinoceros pit I fancied the rhinos’ heads were
hung low with sadness over the loss of one of their dear companions. But
what can you do when you love your father? Life goes on and you don’t
touch tigers. Except that now, for having accused Ravi of an unspecified
crime he hadn’t committed, I was as good as dead. In years subsequent,
when he was in the mood to terrorize me, he would whisper to me, “Just
wait till we’re alone. You’re the next goat! “</p>
