<h4 id="chapter-61">Chapter 61</h4>
<p>The next morning I was not too wet and I was feeling strong. I
thought this was remarkable considering the strain I was under and how
little I had eaten in the last several days. It was a fine day. I
decided to try my hand at fishing, for the first time in my life. After
a breakfast of three biscuits and one can of water, I read what the
survival manual had to say on the subject. The first problem arose:
bait. I thought about it. There were the dead animals, but stealing food
from under a tiger’s nose was a proposition I was not up to. He would
not realize that it was an investment that would bring him an excellent
return. I decided to use my leather shoe. I had only one left. The other
I had lost when the ship sank. I crept up to the lifeboat and I gathered
from the locker one of the fishing kits, the knife and a bucket for my
catch. Richard Parker was lying on his side. His tail jumped to life
when I was at the bow but his head did not lift. I let the raft out. I
attached a hook to a wire leader, which I tied to a line. I added some
lead weights. I picked three that had an intriguing torpedo shape. I
removed my shoe and cut it into pieces. It was hard work; the leather
was tough. I carefully worked the hook into a flat piece of hide, not
through it but into it, so that the point of the hook was hidden. I let
the line down deep. There had been so many fish the previous evening
that I expected easy success. I had none. The whole shoe disappeared bit
by bit, slight tug on the line by slight tug on the line, happy
freeloading fish by happy freeloading fish, bare hook by bare hook,
until I was left with only the rubber sole and the shoelace. When the
shoelace proved an unconvincing earthworm, out of sheer exasperation I
tried the sole, all of it. It was not a good idea. I felt a slight,
promising tug and then the line was unexpectedly light. All I pulled in
was line. I had lost the whole tackle. This loss did not strike me as a
terrible blow. There were other hooks, leader wires and weights in the
kit, besides a whole other kit. And I wasn’t even fishing for myself. I
had plenty of food in store. Still, a part of my mind-the one that says
what we don’t want to hear-rebuked me. “Stupidity has a price. You
should show more care and wisdom next time.“</p>
<p>Later that morning a second turtle appeared. It came right up to the
raft. It could have reached up and bit my bottom if it had wanted to.
When it turned I reached for its hind flipper, but as soon as I touched
it I recoiled in horror. The turtle swam away. The same part of my mind
that had rebuked me over my fishing fiasco scolded me again. “What
exactly do you intend to feed that tiger of yours? How much longer do
you think he’ll last on three dead animals? Do I need to remind you that
tigers are not carrion eaters? Granted, when he’s on his last legs he
probably won’t lift his nose at much. But don’t you think that before he
submits to eating puffy, putrefied zebra he’ll try the fresh, juicy
Indian boy just a short dip away? And how are we doing with the water
situation? You know how tigers get impatient with thirst. Have you
smelled his breath recently? It’s pretty awful. That’s a bad sign.
Perhaps you’re hoping that he’ll lap up the Pacific and in quenching his
thirst allow you to walk to America? Quite amazing, this limited
capacity to excrete salt that Sundarbans tigers have developed. Comes
from living in a tidal mangrove forest, I suppose. But it is a limited
capacity. Don’t they say that drinking too much saline water makes a
man-eater of a tiger? Oh, look. Speak of the devil. There he is. He’s
yawning. My, my, what an enormous pink cave. Look at those long yellow
stalactites and stalagmites. Maybe today you’ll get a chance to
visit.“</p>
<p>Richard Parker’s tongue, the size and colour of a rubber hot-water
bottle, retreated and his mouth closed. He swallowed. I spent the rest
of the day worrying myself sick. I stayed away from the lifeboat.
Despite my own dire predictions, Richard Parker passed the time calmly
enough. He still had water from the rainfall and he didn’t seem too
concerned with hunger. But he did make various tiger noises-growls and
moans and the like-that did nothing to put me at ease. The riddle seemed
irresolvable: to fish I needed bait, but I would have bait only once I
had fish. What was I supposed to do? Use one of my toes? Cut off one of
my ears? A solution appeared in the late afternoon in a most unexpected
way. I had pulled myself up to the lifeboat. More than that: I had
climbed aboard and was rummaging through the locker, feverishly looking
for an idea that would save my life. I had tied the raft so that it was
about six feet from the boat. I fancied that with a jump and a pull at a
loose knot I could save myself from Richard Parker. Desperation had
pushed me to take such a risk. Finding nothing, no bait and no new idea,
I sat up-only to discover that I was dead centre in the focus of his
stare. He was at the other end of the lifeboat, where the zebra used to
be, turned my way and sitting up, looking as if he’d been patiently
waiting for me to notice him. How was it that I hadn’t heard him stir?
What delusion was I under that I thought I could outwit him? Suddenly I
was hit hard across the face. I cried out and closed my eyes. With
feline speed he had leapt across the lifeboat and struck me. I was to
have my face clawed off-this was the gruesome way I was to die. The pain
was so severe I felt nothing. Blessed be shock. Blessed be that part of
us that protects us from too much pain and sorrow. At the heart of life
is a ruse box. I whimpered, “Go ahead, Richard Parker, finish me off.
But please, what you must do, do it quickly. A blown fuse should not be
overtested.“</p>
<p>He was taking his time. He was at my feet, making noises. No doubt he
had discovered the locker and its riches. I fearfully opened an eye. It
was a fish. There was a fish in the locker. It was flopping about like a
fish out of water. It was about fifteen inches long and it had wings. A
flying fish. Slim and dark grey-blue, with dry, featherless wings and
round, unblinking, yellowish eyes. It was this flying fish that had
struck me across the face, not Richard Parker. He was still fifteen feet
away, no doubt wondering what I was going on about. But he had seen the
fish. I could read a keen curiosity on his face. He seemed about ready
to investigate. I bent down, picked up the fish and threw it towards
him. This was the way to tame him! Where a rat had gone, a flying fish
would follow. Unfortunately, the flying fish flew. In mid-air, just
ahead of Richard Parker’s open mouth, the fish swerved and dropped into
the water. It happened with lightning speed. Richard Parker turned his
head and snapped his mouth, jowls flapping, but the fish was too quick
for him. He looked astonished and displeased. He turned to me again.
“Where’s my treat?“ his face seemed to inquire. Fear and sadness gripped
me. I turned with the half-hearted, half-abandoned hope that I could
jump onto the raft before he could jump onto me. At that precise instant
there was a vibration in the air and we were struck by a school of
flying fish. They came like a swarm of locusts. It was not only their
numbers; there was also something insect-like about the clicking,
whirring sound of their wings. They burst out of the water, dozens of
them at a time, some of them flick-flacking over a hundred yards through
the air. Many dived into the water just before the boat. A number sailed
clear over it. Some crashed into its side, sounding like firecrackers
going off. Several lucky ones returned to the water after a bounce on
the tarpaulin. Others, less fortunate, fell directly into the boat,
where they started a racket of flapping and flailing and splashing. And
still others flew right into us. Standing unprotected as I was, I felt I
was living the martyrdom of Saint Sebastian. Every fish that hit me was
like an arrow entering my flesh. I clutched at a blanket to protect
myself while also trying to catch some of the fish. I received cuts and
bruises all over my body. The reason for this onslaught became evident
immediately: dorados were leaping out of the water in hot pursuit of
them. The much larger dorados couldn’t match their flying, but they were
faster swimmers and their short lunges were very powerful. They could
overtake flying fish if they were just behind them and lunging from the
water at the same time and in the same direction. There were sharks too;
they also leapt out of the water, not so cleanly but with devastating
consequence for some dorados. This aquatic mayhem didn’t last long, but
while it did, the sea bubbled and boiled, fish jumped and jaws worked
hard. Richard Parker was tougher than I was in the face of these fish,
and far more efficient. He raised himself and went about blocking,
swiping and biting all the fish he could. Many were eaten live and
whole, struggling wings beating in his mouth. It was a dazzling display
of might and speed. Actually, it was not so much the speed that was
impressive as the pure animal confidence, the total absorption in the
moment. Such a mix of ease and concentration, such a
being-in-the-present, would be the envy of the highest yogis. When it
was over, the result, besides a very sore body for me, was six flying
fish in the locker and a much greater number in the lifeboat. I
hurriedly wrapped a fish in a blanket, gathered a hatchet and made for
the raft. I proceeded with great deliberation. The loss of my tackle
that morning had had a sobering effect on me. I couldn’t allow myself
another mistake. I unwrapped the fish carefully, keeping a hand pressed
down on it, fully aware that it would try to jump away to save itself.
The closer the fish was to appearing, the more afraid and disgusted I
became. Its head came into sight. The way I was holding it, it looked
like a scoop of loathsome fish ice cream sticking out of a wool blanket
cone. The thing was gasping for water, its mouth and gills opening and
closing slowly. I could feel it pushing with its wings against my hand.
I turned the bucket over and brought its head against the bottom. I took
hold of the hatchet. I raised it in the air. Several times I started
bringing the hatchet down, but I couldn’t complete the action. Such
sentimentalism may seem ridiculous considering what I had witnessed in
the last days, but those were the deeds of others, of predatory animals.
I suppose I was partly responsible for the rat’s death, but I’d only
thrown it; it was Richard Parker who had killed it. A lifetime of
peaceful vegetarianism stood between me and the willful beheading of a
fish. I covered the fish’s head with the blanket and turned the hatchet
around. Again my hand wavered in the air. The idea of beating a soft,
living head with a hammer was simply too much. I put the hatchet down. I
would break its neck, sight unseen, I decided. I wrapped the fish
tightly in the blanket. With both hands I started bending it. The more I
pressed, the more the fish struggled. I imagined what it would feel like
if I were wrapped in a blanket and someone were trying to break my neck.
I was appalled. I gave up a number of times. Yet I knew it had to be
done, and the longer I waited, the longer the fish’s suffering would go
on. Tears flowing down my cheeks, I egged myself on until I heard a
cracking sound and I no longer felt any life fighting in my hands. I
pulled back the folds of the blanket. The flying fish was dead. It was
split open and bloody on one side of its head, at the level of the
gills. I wept heartily over this poor little deceased soul. It was the
first sentient being I had ever killed. I was now a killer. I was now as
guilty as Cain. I was sixteen years old, a harmless boy, bookish and
religious, and now I had blood on my hands. It’s a terrible burden to
carry. All sentient life is sacred. I never forget to include this fish
in my prayers. After that it was easier. Now that it was dead, the
flying fish looked like fish I had seen in the markets of Pondicherry.
It was something else, something outside the essential scheme of
creation. I chopped it up into pieces with the hatchet and put it in the
bucket. In the dying hours of the day I tried fishing again. At first I
had no better luck than I’d had in the morning. But success seemed less
elusive. The fish nibbled at the hook with fervour. Their interest was
evident. I realized that these were small fish, too small for the hook.
So I cast my line further out and let it sink deeper, beyond the reach
of the small fish that concentrated around the raft and lifeboat. It was
when I used the flying fish’s head as bait, and with only one sinker,
casting my line out and pulling it in quickly, making the head skim over
the surface of the water, that I finally had my first strike. A dorado
surged forth and lunged for the fish head. I let out a little slack, to
make sure it had properly swallowed the bait, before giving the line a
good yank. The dorado exploded out of the water, tugging on the line so
hard I thought it was going to pull me off the raft. I braced myself.
The line became very taut. It was good line; it would not break. I
started bringing the dorado in. It struggled with all its might, jumping
and diving and splashing. The line cut into my hands. I wrapped my hands
in the blanket. My heart was pounding. The fish was as strong as an ox.
I was not sure I would be able to pull it in. I noticed all the other
fish had vanished from around the raft and boat. No doubt they had
sensed the dorado’s distress. I hurried. Its struggling would attract
sharks. But it fought like a devil. My arms were aching. Every time I
got it close to the raft, it beat about with such frenzy that I was
cowed into letting out some line. At last I managed to haul it aboard.
It was over three feet long. The bucket was useless. It would fit the
dorado like a hat. I held the fish down by kneeling on it and using my
hands. It was a writhing mass of pure muscle, so big its tail stuck out
from beneath me, pounding hard against the raft. It was giving me a ride
like I imagine a bucking bronco would give a cowboy. I was in a wild and
triumphant mood. A dorado is a magnificent-looking fish, large, fleshy
and sleek, with a bulging forehead that speaks of a forceful
personality, a very long dorsal fin as proud as a cock’s comb, and a
coat of scales that is smooth and bright. I felt I was dealing fate a
serious blow by engaging such a handsome adversary. With this fish I was
retaliating against the sea, against the wind, against the sinking of
ships, against all circumstances that were working against me. “Thank
you, Lord Vishnu, thank you!“ I shouted. “Once you saved the world by
taking the form of a fish. Now you have saved me by taking the form of a
fish. Thank you, thank you!“</p>
<p>Killing it was no problem. I would have spared myself the
trouble-after all, it was for Richard Parker and he would have
dispatched it with expert ease-but for the hook that was embedded in its
mouth. I exulted at having a dorado at the end of my line-I would be
less keen if it were a tiger. I went about the job in a direct way. I
took the hatchet in both my hands and vigorously beat the fish on the
head with the hammerhead (I still didn’t have the stomach to use the
sharp edge). The dorado did a most extraordinary thing as it died: it
began to flash all kinds of colours in rapid succesion. Blue, green,
red, gold and violet flickered and shimmered neon-like on its surface as
it struggled. I felt I was beating a rainbow to death. (I found out
later that the dorado is famed for its death-knell iridescence.) At last
it lay still and dull-coloured, and I could remove the hook. I even
managed to retrieve a part of my bait. You may be astonished that in
such a short period of time I could go from weeping over the muffled
killing of a flying fish to gleefully bludgeoning to death a dorado. I
could explain it by arguing that profiting from a pitiful flying fish’s
navigational mistake made me shy and sorrowful, while the excitement of
actively capturing a great dorado made me sanguinary and self-assured.
But in point of fact the explanation lies elsewhere. It is simple and
brutal: a person can get used to anything, even to killing. It was with
a hunter’s pride that I pulled the raft up to the lifeboat. I brought it
along the side, keeping very low. I swung my arm and dropped the dorado
into the boat. It landed with a heavy thud and provoked a gruff
expression of surprise from Richard Parker. After a sniff or two, I
heard the wet mashing sound of a mouth at work. I pushed myself off, not
forgetting to blow the whistle hard several times, to remind Richard
Parker of who had so graciously provided him with fresh food. I stopped
to pick up some biscuits and a can of water. The five remaining flying
fish in the locker were dead. I pulled their wings off, throwing them
away, and wrapped the fish in the now-consecrated fish blanket. By the
time I had rinsed myself of blood, cleaned up my fishing gear, put
things away and had my supper, night had come on. A thin layer of clouds
masked the stars and the moon, and it was very dark. I was tired, but
still excited by the events of the last hours. The feeling of busyness
was profoundly satisfying; I hadn’t thought at all about my plight or
myself. Fishing was surely a better way of passing the time than
yarn-spinning or playing I Spy . I determined to start again the next
day as soon as there was light. I fell asleep, my mind lit up by the
chameleon-like flickering of the dying dorado.</p>
