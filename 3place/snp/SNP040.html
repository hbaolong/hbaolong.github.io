<h4 id="chapter-38">Chapter 38</h4>
<p>I don’t understand. For days the ship had pushed on, bullishly
indifferent to its surroundings. The sun shone, rain fell, winds blew,
currents flowed, the sea built up hills, the sea dug up valleys-the
Tsimtsum did not care. It moved with the slow, massive confidence of a
continent. I had bought a map of the world for the trip; I had set it up
in our cabin against a cork billboard. Every morning I got our position
from the control bridge and marked it on the map with an orange tipped
pin. We sailed from Madras across the Bay of Bengal, down through the
Strait of Malacca, around Singapore and up to Manila. I loved every
minute of it. It was a thrill to be on a ship. Taking care of the
animals kept us very busy. Every night we fell into bed weary to our
bones. We were in Manila for two days, a question of fresh feed, new
cargo and, we were told, the performing of routine maintenance work on
the engines. I paid attention only to the first two. The fresh feed
included a ton of bananas, and the new cargo, a female Congo chimpanzee,
part of Father’s wheeling and dealing. A ton of bananas bristles with a
good three, four pounds of big black spiders. A chimpanzee is like a
smaller, leaner gorilla, but meaner-looking, with less of the melancholy
gentleness of its larger cousin. A chimpanzee shudders and grimaces when
it touches a big black spider, like you and I would do, before squashing
it angrily with its knuckles, not something you and I would do. I
thought bananas and a chimpanzee were more interesting than a loud,
filthy mechanical contraption in the dark bowels of a ship. Ravi spent
his days there, watching the men work. Something was wrong with the
engines, he said. Did something go wrong with the fixing of them? I
don’t know. I don’t think anyone will ever know. The answer is a mystery
lying at the bottom of thousands of feet of water. We left Manila and
entered the Pacific. On our fourth day out, midway to Midway, we sank.
The ship vanished into a pinprick hole on my map. A mountain collapsed
before my eyes and disappeared beneath my feet. All around me was the
vomit of a dyspeptic ship. I felt sick to my stomach. I felt shock. I
felt a great emptiness within me, which then filled with silence. My
chest hurt with pain and fear for days afterwards. I think there was an
explosion. But I can’t be sure. It happened while I was sleeping. It
woke me up. The ship was no luxury liner. It was a grimy, hardworking
cargo ship not designed for paying passengers or for their comfort.
There were all kinds of noises all the time. It was precisely because
the level of noise was so uniform that we slept like babies. It was a
form of silence that nothing disturbed, not Ravi’s snoring nor my
talking in my sleep. So the explosion, if there was one, was not a new
noise. It was an irregular noise. I woke up with a start, as if Ravi had
burst a balloon in my ears. I looked at my watch. It was just after
four-thirty in the morning. I leaned over and looked down at the bunk
below. Ravi was still sleeping. I dressed and climbed down. Normally I’m
a sound sleeper. Normally I would have gone back to sleep. I don’t know
why I got up that night. It was more the sort of thing Ravi would do. He
liked the word beckon ; he would have said, “Adventure beckons,“ and
would have gone off to prowl around the ship. The level of noise was
back to normal again, but with a different quality perhaps, muffled
maybe. I shook Ravi. I said, “Ravi! There was a funny noise. Let’s go
exploring.“ He looked at me sleepily. He shook his head and turned over,
pulling the sheet up to his cheek. Oh, Ravi! I opened the cabin door. I
remember walking down the corridor. Day or night it looked the same. But
I felt the night in me. I stopped at Father and Mother’s door and
considered knocking on it. I remember looking at my watch and deciding
against it. Father liked his sleep. I decided I would climb to the main
deck and catch the dawn. Maybe I would see a shooting star. I was
thinking about that, about shooting stars, as I climbed the stairs. We
were two levels below the main deck. I had already forgotten about the
funny noise. It was only when I had pushed open the heavy door leading
onto the main deck that I realized what the weather was like. Did it
qualify as a storm? It’s true there was rain, but it wasn’t so very
hard. It certainly wasn’t a driving rain, like you see during the
monsoons. And there was wind. I suppose some of the gusts would have
upset umbrellas. But I walked through it without much difficulty. As for
the sea, it looked rough, but to a landlubber the sea is always
impresive and forbidding, beautiful and dangerous. Waves were reaching
up, and their white foam, caught by the wind, was being whipped against
the side of the ship. But I’d seen that on other days and the ship
hadn’t sunk. A cargo ship is a huge and stable structure, a feat of
engineering. It’s designed to stay afloat under the most adverse
conditions. Weather like this surely wouldn’t sink a ship? Why, I only
had to close a door and the storm was gone. I advanced onto the deck. I
gripped the railing and faced the elements. This was adventure.</p>
<p>“Canada, here I come!“ I shouted as I was soaked and chilled. I felt
very brave. It was dark still, but there was enough light to see by.
Light on pandemonium it was. Nature can put on a thrilling show. The
stage is vast, the lighting is dramatic, the extras are innumerable, and
the budget for special effects is absolutely unlimited. What I had
before me was a spectacle of wind and water, an earthquake of the
senses, that even Hollywood couldn’t orchestrate. But the earthquake
stopped at the ground beneath my feet. The ground beneath my feet was
solid. I was a spectator safely ensconced in his seat. It was when I
looked up at a lifeboat on the bridge castle that I started to worry.
The lifeboat wasn’t hanging straight down. It was leaning in from its
davits. I turned and looked at my hands. My knuckles were white. The
thing was, I wasn’t holding on so tightly because of the weather, but
because otherwise I would fall in towards the ship. The ship was listing
to port, to the other side. It wasn’t a severe list, but enough to
surprise me. When I looked overboard the drop wasn’t sheer any more. I
could see the ship’s great black side. A shiver of cold went through me.
I decided it was a storm after all. Time to return to safety. I let go,
hotfooted it to the wall, moved over and pulled open the door. Inside
the ship, there were noises. Deep structural groans. I stumbled and
fell. No harm done. I got up. With the help of the handrails I went down
the stairwell four steps at a time. I had gone down just one level when
I saw water. Lots of water. It was blocking my way. It was surging from
below like a riotous crowd, raging, frothing and boiling. Stairs
vanished into watery darkness. I couldn’t believe my eyes. What was this
water doing here? Where had it come from? I stood nailed to the spot,
frightened and incredulous and ignorant of what I should do next. Down
there was where my family was. I ran up the stairs. I got to the main
deck. The weather wasn’t entertaining any more. I was very afraid. Now
it was plain and obvious: the ship was listing badly. And it wasn’t
level the other way either. There was a noticeable incline going from
bow to stern. I looked overboard. The water didn’t look to be eighty
feet away. The ship was sinking. My mind could hardly conceive it. It
was as unbelievable as the moon catching fire. Where were the officers
and the crew? What were they doing? Towards the bow I saw some men
running in the gloom. I thought I saw some animals too, but I dismissed
the sight as illusion crafted by rain and shadow. We had the hatch
covers over their bay pulled open when the weather was good, but at all
times the animals were kept confined to their cages. These were
dangerous wild animals we were transporting, not farm livestock. Above
me, on the bridge, I thought I heard some men shouting. The ship shook
and there was that sound, the monstrous metallic burp. What was it? Was
it the collective scream of humans and animals protesting their oncoming
death? Was it the ship itself giving up the ghost? I fell over. I got to
my feet. I looked overboard again. The sea was rising. The waves were
getting closer. We were sinking fast. I clearly heard monkeys shrieking.
Something was shaking the deck, A gaur-an Indian wild ox-exploded out of
the rain and thundered by me, terrified, out of control, berserk. I
looked at it, dumbstruck and amazed. Who in God’s name had let it out? I
ran for the stairs to the bridge. Up there was where the officers were,
the only people on the ship who spoke English, the masters of our
destiny here, the ones who would right this wrong. They would explain
everything. They would take care of my family and me. I climbed to the
middle bridge. There was no one on the starboard side. I ran to the port
side. I saw three men, crew members. I fell. I got up. They were looking
overboard. I shouted. They turned. They looked at me and at each other.
They spoke a few words. They came towards me quickly. I felt gratitude
and relief welling up in me. I said, “Thank God I’ve found you. What is
happening? I am very scared. There is water at the bottom of the ship. I
am worried about my family. I can’t get to the level where our cabins
are. Is this normal? Do you think-“</p>
<p>One of the men interrupted me by thrusting a life jacket into my arms
and shouting something in Chinese. I noticed an orange whistle dangling
from the life jacket. The men were nodding vigorously at me. When they
took hold of me and lifted me in their strong arms, I thought nothing of
it. I thought they were helping me. I was so full of trust in them that
I felt grateful as they carried me in th air. Only when they threw me
overboard did I begin to have doubts.</p>
