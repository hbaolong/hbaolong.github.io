<h4 id="chapter-43">Chapter 43</h4>
<p>The last trace I saw of the ship was a patch of oil glimmering on the
surface of the water. I was certain I wasn’t alone. It was inconceivable
that the Tsimtsum should sink without eliciting a peep of concern. Right
now in Tokyo, in Panama City, in Madras, in Honolulu, why, even in
Winnipeg, red lights were blinking on consoles, alarm bells were
ringing, eyes were opening wide in horror, mouths were gasping, “My God!
The Tsimtsum has sunk!“ and hands were reaching for phones. More red
lights were starting to blink and more alarm bells were starting to
ring. Pilots were running to their planes with their shoelaces still
untied, such was their hurry. Ship officers were spinning their wheels
till they were feeling dizzy. Even submarines were swerving underwater
to join in the rescue effort. We would be rescued soon. A ship would
appear on the horizon. A gun would be found to kill the hyena and put
the zebra out of its misery. Perhaps Orange Juice could be saved. I
would climb aboard and be greeted by my family. They would have been
picked up in another lifeboat. I only had to ensure my survival for the
next few hours until this rescue ship came. I reached from my perch for
the net. I rolled it up and tossed it midway on the tarpaulin to act as
a barrier, however small. Orange Juice had seemed practically
cataleptic. My guess was she was dying of shock. It was the hyena that
worried me. I could hear it whining. I clung to the hope that a zebra, a
familiar prey, and an orang-utan, an unfamiliar one, would distract it
from thoughts of me. I kept one eye on the horizon, one eye on the other
end of the lifeboat. Other than the hyena’s whining, I heard very little
from the animals, no more than claws scuffing against a hard surface and
occasional groans and arrested cries. No major fight seemed to be taking
place. Mid-morning the hyena appeared again. In the preceding minutes
its whining had been rising in volume to a scream. It jumped over the
zebra onto the stern, where the lifeboat’s side benches came together to
form a triangular bench. It was a fairly exposed position, the distance
between bench and gunnel being about twelve inches. The animal nervously
peered beyond the boat. Beholding a vast expanse of shifting water
seemed to be the last thing it wanted to see, for it instantly brought
its head down and dropped to the bottom of the boat behind the zebra.
That was a cramped space; between the broad back of the zebra and the
sides of the buoyancy tanks that went all round the boat beneath the
benches, there wasn’t much room left for a hyena. It thrashed about for
a moment before climbing to the stern again and jumping back over the
zebra to the middle of the boat, disappearing beneath the tarpaulin.
This burst of activity lasted less than ten seconds. The hyena came to
within fifteen feet of me. My only reaction was to freeze with fear. The
zebra, by comparison, swiftly reared its head and barked. I was hoping
the hyena would stay under the tarpaulin. I was disappointed. Nearly
immediately it leapt over the zebra and onto the stern bench again.
There it turned on itself a few times, whimpering and hesitating. I
wondered what it was going to do next. The answer came quickly: it
brought its head low and ran around the zebra in a circle, transforming
the stern bench, the side benches and the cross bench just beyond the
tarpaulin into a twenty-five-foot indoor track. It did one
lap-two-three-four-five-and onwards, non-stop, till I lost count. And
the whole time, lap after lap, it went yip yip yip yip yip in a
high-pitched way. My reaction, once again, was very slow. I was seized
by fear and could only watch. The beast was going at a good clip, and it
was no small animal; it was an adult male that looked to be about 140
pounds. The beating of its legs against the benches made the whole boat
shake, and its claws were loudly clicking on their surface. Each time it
came from the stern I tensed. It was hair-raising enough to see the
thing racing my way; worse still was the fear that it would keep going
straight. Clearly, Orange Juice, wherever she was, would not be an
obstacle. And the rolled-up tarpaulin and the bulge of the net were even
more pitiful defences. With the slightest of efforts the hyena could be
at the bow right at my feet. It didn’t seem intent on that course of
action; every time it came to the cross bench, it took it, and I saw the
upper half of its body moving rapidly along the edge of the tarpaulin.
But in this state, the hyena’s behaviour was highly unpredictable and it
could decide to attack me without warning. After a number of laps it
stopped short at the stern bench and crouched, directing its gaze
downwards, to the space below the tarpaulin. It lifted its eyes and
rested them upon me. The look was nearly the typical look of a
hyena-blank and frank, the curiosity apparent with nothing of the mental
set revealed, jaw hanging open, big ears sticking up rigidly, eyes
bright and black-were it not for the strain that exuded from every cell
of its body, an anxiety that made the animal glow, as if with a fever. I
prepared for my end. For nothing. It started running in circles again.
When an animal decides to do something, it can do it for a very long
time. All morning the hyena ran in circles going yip yip yip yip yip .
Once in a while it briefly stopped at the stern bench, but otherwise
every lap was identical to the previous one, with no variations in
movement, in speed, in the pitch or the volume of the yipping, in the
counter-clockwise direction of travel. Its yipping was shrill and
annoying in the extreme. It became so tedious and draining to watch that
I eventually turned my head to the side, trying to keep guard with the
corner of my eyes. Even the zebra, which at first snorted each time the
hyena raced by its head, fell into a stupor. Yet every time the hyena
paused at the stern bench, my heart jumped. And as much as I wanted to
direct my attention to the horizon, to where my salvation lay, it kept
straying back to this maniacal beast. I am not one to hold a prejudice
against any animal, but it is a plain fact that the spotted hyena is not
well served by its appearance. It is ugly beyond redemption. Its thick
neck and high shoulders that slope to the hindquarters look as if
they’ve come from a discarded prototype for the giraffe, and its shaggy,
coarse coat seems to have been patched together from the leftovers of
creation. The colour is a bungled mix of tan, black, yellow, grey, with
the spots having none of the classy ostentation of a leopard’s rosettes;
they look rather like the symptoms of a skin disease, a virulent form of
mange. The head is broad and too massive, with a high forehead, like
that of a bear, but suffering from a receding hairline, and with ears
that look ridiculously mouse-like, large and round, when they haven’t
been torn off in battle. The mouth is forever open and panting. The
nostrils are too big. The tail is scraggly and unwagging. The gait is
shambling. All the parts put together look doglike, but like no dog
anyone would want as a pet. But I had not forgotten Father’s words.
These were not cowardly carrion-eaters. If National Geographic portrayed
them as such, it was because National Geographic filmed during the day.
It is when the moon rises that the hyena’s day starts, and it proves to
be a devastating hunter. Hyenas attack in packs whatever animal can be
run down, its flanks opened while still in full motion. They go for
zebras, gnus and water buffaloes, and not only the old or the infirm in
a herd-full-grown members too. They are hardy attackers, rising up from
buttings and kickings immediately, never giving up for simple lack of
will. And they are clever; anything that can be distracted from its
mother is good. The ten-minute-old gnu is a favourite dish, but hyenas
also eat young lions and young rhinoceros. They are diligent when their
efforts are rewarded. In fifteen minutes flat, all that will be left of
a zebra is the skull, which may yet be dragged away and gnawed down at
leisure by young ones in the lair. Nothing goes to waste; even grass
upon which blood has been spilt will be eaten. Hyenas’ stomachs swell
visibly as they swallow huge chunks of kill. If they are lucky, they
become so full they have difficulty moving. Once they’ve digested their
kill, they cough up dense hairballs, which they pick clean of edibles
before rolling in them. Accidental cannibalism is a common occurrence
during the excitement of a feeding; in reaching for a bite of zebra, a
hyena will take in the ear or nostril of a clan member, no hard feelings
intended. The hyena feels no disgust at this mistake. Its delights are
too many to admit to disgust at anything. In fact, a hyena’s catholicity
of taste is so indiscriminate it nearly forces admiration. A hyena will
drink from water even as it is urinating in it. The animal has another
original use for its urine: in hot, dry weather it will cool itself by
relieving its bladder on the ground and stirring up a refreshing mud
bath with its paws. Hyenas snack on the excrement of herbivores with
clucks of pleasure. It’s an open question as to what hyenas won’t eat.
They eat their own kind (the rest of those whose ears and noses they
gobbled down as appetizers) once they’re dead, after a period of
aversion that lasts about one day. They will even attack motor
vehicles-the headlights, the exhaust pipe, the side mirrors. It is not
their gastric juices that limit hyenas, but the power of their jaws,
which is formidable. That was the animal I had racing around in circles
before me. An animal to pain the eye and chill the heart. Things ended
in typical hyena fashion. It stopped at the stern and started producing
deep groans interrupted by fits of heavy panting. I pushed myself away
on the oar till only the tips of my feet were holding on to the boat.
The animal hacked and coughed. Abruptly it vomited. A gush landed behind
the zebra. The hyena dropped into what it had just produced. It stayed
there, shaking and whining and turning around on itself, exploring the
furthest confines of animal anguish. It did not move from the restricted
space for the rest of the day. At times the zebra made noises about the
predator just behind it, but mostly it lay in hopeless and sullen
silence.</p>
