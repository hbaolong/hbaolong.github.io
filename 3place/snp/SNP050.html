<h4 id="chapter-49">Chapter 49</h4>
<p>In the morning I could not move. I was pinned by weakness to the
tarpaulin. Even thinking was exhausting. I applied myself to thinking
straight. At length, as slowly as a caravan of camels crossing a desert,
some thoughts came together. The day was like the previous one, warm and
overcast, the clouds low, the breeze light. That was one thought. The
boat was rocking gently, that was another. I thought of sustenance for
the first time. I had not had a drop to drink or a bite to eat or a
minute of sleep in three days. Finding this obvious explanation for my
weakness brought me a little strength. Richard Parker was still on
board. In fact, he was directly beneath me. Incredible that such a thing
should need consent to be true, but it was only after much deliberation,
upon assessing various mental items and points of view, that I concluded
that it was not a dream or a delusion or a misplaced memory or a fancy
or any other such falsity, but a solid, true thing witnessed while in a
weakened, highly agitated state. The truth of it would be confirmed as
soon as I felt well enough to investigate. How I had failed to notice
for two and a half days a 450-pound Bengal tiger in a lifeboat
twenty-six feet long was a conundrum I would have to try to crack later,
when I had more energy. The feat surely made Richard Parker the largest
stowaway, proportionally speaking, in the history of navigation. From
tip of nose to tip of tail he took up over a third of the length of the
ship he was on. You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did.
And as a result I perked up and felt much better. We see that in sports
all the time, don’t we? The tennis challenger starts strong but soon
loses confidence in his playing. The champion racks up the games. But in
the final set, when the challenger has nothing left to lose, he becomes
relaxed again, insouciant, daring. Suddenly he’s playing like the devil
and the champion must work hard to get those last points. So it was with
me. To cope with a hyena seemed remotely possible, but I was so
obviously outmatched by Richard Parker that it wasn’t even worth
worrying about. With a tiger aboard, my life was over. That being
settled, why not do something about my parched throat? I believe it was
this that saved my life that morning, that I was quite literally dying
of thirst. Now that the word had popped into my head I couldn’t think of
anything else, as if the word itself were salty and the more I thought
of it, the worse the effect. I have heard that the hunger for air
exceeds as a compelling sensation the thirst for water. Only for a few
minutes, I say. After a few minutes you die and the discomfort of
asphyxiation goes away. Whereas thirst is a drawn-out affair. Look:
Christ on the Cross died of suffocation, but His only complaint was of
thirst. If thirst can be so taxing that even God Incarnate complains
about it, imagine the effect on a regular human. It was enough to make
me go raving mad. I have never known a worse physical hell than this
putrid taste and pasty feeling in the mouth, this unbearable pressure at
the back of the throat, this sensation that my blood was turning to a
thick syrup that barely flowed. Truly, by comparison, a tiger was
nothing. And so I pushed aside all thoughts of Richard Parker and
fearlessly went exploring for fresh water.</p>
<p>The divining rod in my mind dipped sharply and a spring gushed water
when I remembered that I was on a genuine, regulation lifeboat and that
such a lifeboat was surely outfitted with supplies. That seemed like a
perfectly reasonable proposition. What captain would fail in so
elementary a way to ensure the safety of his crew? What ship chandler
would not think of making a little extra money under the noble guise of
saving lives? It was settled. There was water aboard. All I had to do
was find it. Which meant I had to move. I made it to the middle of the
boat, to the edge of the tarpaulin. It was a hard crawl. I felt I was
climbing the side of a volcano and I was about to look over the rim into
a boiling cauldron of orange lava. I lay flat. I carefully brought my
head over. I did not look over any more than I had to. I did not see
Richard Parker. The hyena was plainly visible, though. It was back
behind what was left of the zebra. It was looking at me. I was no longer
afraid of it. It wasn’t ten feet away, yet my heart didn’t skip a beat.
Richard Parker’s presence had at least that useful aspect. To be afraid
of this ridiculous dog when there was a tiger about was like being
afraid of splinters when trees are falling down. I became very angry at
the animal. “You ugly, foul creature,“ I muttered. The only reason I
didn’t stand up and beat it off the lifeboat with a stick was lack of
strength and stick, not lack of heart. Did the hyena sense something of
my mastery? Did it say to itself, “Super alpha is watching me-I better
not move?“ I don’t know. At any rate, it didn’t move. In fact, in the
way it ducked its head it seemed to want to hide from me. But it was no
use hiding. It would get its just deserts soon enough. Richard Parker
also explained the animals’ strange behaviour. Now it was clear why the
hyena had confined itself to such an absurdly small space behind the
zebra and why it had waited so long before killing it. It was fear of
the greater beast and fear of touching the greater beast’s food. The
strained, temporary peace between Orange Juice and the hyena, and my
reprieve, were no doubt due to the same reason: in the face of such a
superior predator, all of us were prey, and normal ways of preying were
affected. It seemed the presence of a tiger had saved me from a
hyena-surely a textbook example of jumping from the frying pan into the
fire. But the great beast was not behaving like a great beast, to such
an extent that the hyena had taken liberties. Richard Parker’s
passivity, and for three long days, needed explaining. Only in two ways
could I account for it: sedation and seasickness. Father regularly
sedated a number of the animals to lessen their stress. Might he have
sedated Richard Parker shortly before the ship sank? Had the shock of
the shipwreck-the noises, the falling into the sea, the terrible
struggle to swim to the lifeboat-increased the effect of the sedative?
Had seasickness taken over after that? These were the only plausible
explanations I could come up with. I lost interest in the question. Only
water interested me. I took stock of the lifeboat.</p>
