<h4 id="chapter-71">Chapter 71</h4>
<p>To those who should ever find themselves in a predicament such as I
was in, I would recommend the following program:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose a day when the waves are small but regular. You want a sea
that will put on a good show when your lifeboat is broadside to it,
though without capsizing your boat. Stream your sea anchor full out to
make your lifeboat as stable and comfortable as possible. Prepare your
safe haven from the lifeboat in case you should need it (you most likely
will). If you can, devise some means of bodily protection. Almost
anything can make a shield. Wrapping clothes or blankets around your
limbs will make for a minimal form of armour. Now comes the difficult
part: you must provoke the animal that is afflicting you. Tiger,
rhinoceros, ostrich, wild boar, brown bear-no matter the beast, you must
get its goat. The best way to do this will most likely be to go to the
edge of your territory and noisily intrude into the neutral zone. I did
just that: I went to the edge of the tarpaulin and stamped upon the
middle bench as I mildly blew into the whistle. It is important that you
make a consistent, recognizable noise to signal your aggression. But you
must be careful. You want to provoke your animal, but only so much. You
don’t want it to attack you outright. If it does, God be with you. You
will be torn to pieces, trampled flat, disembowelled, very likely eaten.
You don’t want that. You want an animal that is piqued, peeved, vexed,
bothered, irked, annoyed-but not homicidal. Under no circumstances
should you step into your animal’s territory. Contain your aggression to
staring into its eyes and hurling toots and taunts. When your animal has
been roused, work in all bad faith to provoke a border intrusion. A good
way of bringing this about in my experience is to back off slowly as you
are making your noises. Be sure not to break eye contact! As soon as the
animal has laid a paw in your territory, or even made a determined
advance into the neutral territory, you have achieved your goal. Don’t
be picky or legalistic as to where its paw actually landed. Be quick to
be affronted. Don’t wait to construe-misconstrue as fast as you can. The
point here is to make your animal understand that its upstairs neighbour
is exceptionally persnickety about territory. 5. Once your animal has
trespassed upon your territory, be unflagging in your outrage. Whether
you have fled to your safe haven off the lifeboat or retreated to the
back of your territory on the lifeboat, start blowing your whistle at
full blast and immediately trip the sea anchor . These two actions are
of pivotal importance. You must not delay putting them into effect. If
you can help your lifeboat get broadside to the waves by other means,
with an oar for example, apply yourself right away. The faster your
lifeboat broaches to the waves, the better. Blowing a whistle
continuously is exhausting for the weakened castaway, but you must not
falter. Your alarmed animal must associate its increasing nausea with
the shrill cries of the whistle. You can help things move along by
standing at the end of your boat, feet on opposing gunnels, and swaying
in rhythm to the motion imparted by the sea. However slight you are,
however large your lifeboat, you will be amazed at the difference this
will make. I assure you, in no time you’ll have your lifeboat rocking
and rolling like Elvis Presley. Just don’t forget to be blowing your
whistle all the while, and mind you don’t make your lifeboat capsize.
You want to keep going until the animal that is your burden-your tiger,
your rhinoceros, whatever-is properly green about the gills with
seasickness. You want to hear it heaving and dry retching. You want to
see it lying at the bottom of the lifeboat, limbs trembling, eyes rolled
back, a deathly rattle coming from its gaping mouth. And all the while
you must be shattering the animal’s ears with the piercing blows of your
whistle. If you become sick yourself, don’t waste your vomit by sending
it overboard. Vomit makes an excellent border guard. Puke on the edges
of your territory. When your animal appears good and sick, you can stop.
Seasickness comes on quickly, but it takes a long while to go away. You
don’t want to overstate your case. No one dies of nausea, but it can
seriously sap the will to live. When enough is enough, stream the sea
anchor, try to give shade to your animal if it has collapsed in direct
sunlight, and make sure it has water available when it recovers, with
anti-seasickness tablets dissolved in it, if you have any. Dehydration
is a serious danger at this point. Otherwise retreat to your territory
and leave your animal in peace. Water, rest and relaxation, besides a
stable lifeboat, will bring it back to life. The animal should be
allowed to recover fully before going through steps 1 to 8 again.
Treatment should be repeated until the association in the animal’s mind
between the sound of the whistle and the feeling of intense,
incapacitating nausea is fixed and totally unambiguous. Thereafter, the
whistle alone will deal with trespassing or any other untoward
behaviour. Just one shrill blow and you will see your animal shudder
with malaise and repair at top speed to the safest, furthest part of its
territory. Once this level of training is reached, use of the whistle
should be sparing.</li>
