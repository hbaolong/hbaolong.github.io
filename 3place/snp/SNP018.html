<h4 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h4>
<p>We are all born like Catholics, aren’t we-in limbo, without religion,
until some figure introduces us to God? After that meeting the matter
ends for most of us. If there is a change, it is usually for the lesser
rather than the greater; many people seem to lose God along life’s way.
That was not my case. The figure in question for me was an older sister
of Mother’s, of a more traditional mind, who brought me to a temple when
I was a small baby. Auntie Rohini was delighted to meet her newborn
nephew and thought she would include Mother Goddess in the delight. “It
will be his symbolic first outing,“ she said. It’s a samskara!“ Symbolic
indeed. We were in Madurai; I was the fresh veteran of a seven-hour
train journey. No matter. Off we went on this Hindu rite of passage,
Mother carrying me, Auntie propelling her. I have no conscious memory of
this first go-around in a temple, but some smell of incense, some play
of light and shadow, some flame, some burst of colour, something of the
sultriness and mystery of the place must have stayed with me. A germ of
religious exaltation, no bigger than a mustard seed, was sown in me and
left to germinate. It has never stopped growing since that day. I am a
Hindu because of sculptured cones of red kumkum powder and baskets of
yellow turmeric nuggets, because of garlands of flowers and pieces of
broken coconut, because of the clanging of bells to announce one’s
arrival to God, because of the whine of the reedy nadaswaram and the
beating of drums, because of the patter of bare feet against stone
floors down dark corridors pierced by shafts of sunlight, because of the
fragrance of incense, because of flames of arati lamps circling in the
darkness, because of bhajans being sweetly sung, because of elephants
standing around to bless, because of colourful murals telling colourful
stories, because of foreheads carrying, variously signified, the same
word-faith . I became loyal to these sense impressions even before I
knew what they meant or what they were for. It is my heart that commands
me so. I feel at home in a Hindu temple. I am aware of Presence, not
personal the way we usually feel presence, but something larger. My
heart still skips a beat when I catch sight of the murti, of God
Residing, in the inner sanctum of a temple. Truly I am in a sacred
cosmic womb, a place where everything is born, and it is my sweet luck
to behold its living core. My hands naturally come together in reverent
worship. I hunger for prasad, that sugary offering to God that comes
back to us as a sanctified treat. My palms need to feel the heat of a
hallowed flame whose blessing I bring to my eyes and forehead. But
religion is more than rite and ritual. There is what the rite and ritual
stand for. Here too I am a Hindu. The universe makes sense to me through
Hindu eyes. There is Brahman, the world soul, the sustaining frame upon
which is woven, warp and weft, the cloth of being, with all its
decorative elements of space and time. There is Brahman nirguna, without
qualities, which lies beyond understanding, beyond description, beyond
approach; with our poor words we sew a suit for it-One, Truth, Unity,
Absolute, Ultimate Reality, Ground of Being-and try to make it fit, but
Brahman nirguna always bursts the seams. We are left speechless. But
there is also Brahman saguna, with qualities, where the suit fits. Now
we call it Shiva, Krishna, Shakti, Ganesha; we can approach it with some
understanding; we can discern certain attributes-loving, merciful,
frightening;-and we feel the gentle pull of relationship. Brahman saguna
is Brahman made manifest to our limited senses, Brahman expressed not
only in gods but in humans, animals, trees, in a handful of earth, for
everything has a trace of the divine in it. The truth of life is that
Brahman is no different from atman, the spiritual force within us, what
you might call the soul. The individual soul touches upon the world soul
like a well reaches for the water table. That which sustains the
universe beyond thought and language, and that which is at the core of
us and struggles for expression, is the same thing. The finite within
the infinite, the infinite within the finite. If you ask me how Brahman
and atman relate precisely, I would say in the same way the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit relate: mysteriously. But one thing is clear:
atman seeks to realize Brahman, to be united with the Absolute, and it
travels in this life on a pilgrimage where it is born and dies, and is
born again and dies again, and again, and again, until it manages to
shed the sheaths that imprison it here below. The paths to liberation
are numerous, but the bank along the way is always the same, the Bank of
Karma, where the liberation account of each of us is credited or debited
depending on our actions. This, in a holy nutshell, is Hinduism, and I
have been a Hindu all my life. With its notions in mind I see my place
in the universe. But we should not cling! A plague upon fundamentalists
and literalists! I am reminded of a story of Lord Krishna when he was a
cowherd. Every night he invites the milkmaids to dance with him in the
forest. They come and they dance. The night is dark, the fire in their
midst roars and crackles, the beat of the music gets ever faster-the
girls dance and dance and dance with their sweet lord, who has made
himself so abundant as to be in the arms of each and every girl. But the
moment the girls become possessive, the moment each one imagines that
Krishna is her partner alone, he vanishes. So it is that we should not
be jealous with God. I know a woman here in Toronto who is very dear to
my heart. She was my foster mother. I call her Auntieji and she likes
that. She is Quebecoise. Though she has lived in Toronto for over thirty
years, her French-speaking mind still slips on occasion on the
understanding of English sounds. And so, when she first heard of Hare
Krishnas, she didn’t hear right. She heard “Hairless Christians,“ and
that is what they were to her for many years. When I corrected her, I
told her that in fact she was not so wrong; that Hindus, in their
capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in
the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians,
in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.</p>
