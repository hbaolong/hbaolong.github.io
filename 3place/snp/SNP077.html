<h4 id="chapter-79">Chapter 79</h4>
<p>There were sharks every day, mainly makos and blue sharks, but also
oceanic whitetips, and once a tiger shark straight from the blackest of
nightmares. Dawn and dusk were their favourite times. They never
seriously troubled us. On occasion one knocked the hull of the lifeboat
with its tail. I don’t think it was accidental (other marine life did it
too, turtles and even dorados). I believe it was part of a shark’s way
of determining the nature of the lifeboat. A good whack on the
offender’s nose with a hatchet sent it vanishing post-haste into the
deep. The main nuisance of sharks was that they made being in the water
risky, like trespassing on a property where there’s a sign saying Beware
of Dog. Otherwise, I grew quite fond of sharks. They were like
curmudgeonly old friends who would never admit that they liked me yet
came round to see me all the time. The blue sharks were smaller, usually
no more than four or five feet long, and the most attractive, sleek and
slender, with small mouths and discreet gill slits. Their backs were a
rich ultramarine and their stomachs snow white, colours that vanished to
grey or black when they were at any depth, but which close to the
surface sparkled with surprising brilliance. The makos were larger and
had mouths bursting with frightening teeth, but they too were nicely
coloured, an indigo blue that shimmered beautifully in the sun. The
oceanic whitetips were often shorter than the makos-some of which
stretched to twelve feet-but they were much stockier and had enormous
dorsal fins that they sailed high above the surface of the water, like a
war banner, a rapidly moving sight that was always nerve-racking to
behold. Besides, they were a dull colour, a sort of greyish brown, and
the mottled white tips of their fins held no special attraction. I
caught a number of small sharks, blue sharks for the most part, but some
makos too. Each time it was just after sunset, in the dying light of the
day, and I caught them with my bare hands as they came close to the
lifeboat. The first one was my largest, a mako over four feet long. It
had come and gone near the bow several times. As it was passing by yet
again, I impulsively dropped my hand into the water and grabbed it just
ahead of the tail, where its body was thinnest. Its harsh skin afforded
such a marvellously good grip that without thinking about what I was
doing, I pulled. As I pulled, it jumped, giving my arm a terrific shake.
To my horror and delight the thing vaulted in the air in an explosion of
water and spray. For the merest fraction of a second I didn’t know what
to do next. The thing was smaller than I-but wasn’t I being a foolhardy
Goliath here? Shouldn’t I let go? I turned and swung, and falling on the
tarpaulin, I threw the mako towards the stern. The fish fell from the
sky into Richard Parker’s territory. It landed with a crash and started
thwacking about with such thunder that I was afraid it would demolish
the boat. Richard Parker was startled. He attacked immediately. An epic
battle began. Of interest to zoologists I can report the following: a
tiger will not at first attack a shark out of water with its jaws but
will rather strike at it with its forepaws. Richard Parker started
clubbing the shark. I shuddered at every blow. They were simply
terrible. Just one delivered to a human would break every bone, would
turn any piece of furniture into splinters, would reduce an entire house
into a pile of rubble. That the mako was not enjoying the treatment was
evident from the way it was twisting and turning and beating its tail
and reaching with its mouth. Perhaps it was because Richard Parker was
not familiar with sharks, had never encountered a predatory
fish-whatever the case, it happened: an accident, one of those few times
when I was reminded that Richard Parker was not perfect, that despite
his honed instincts he too could bumble. He put his left paw into the
mako’s mouth. The mako closed its jaws. Immediately Richard Parker
reared onto his back legs. The shark was jerked up, but it wouldn’t let
go. Richard Parker fell back down, opened his mouth wide and full-out
roared. I felt a blast of hot air against my body. The air visibly
shook, like the heat coming off a road on a hot day. I can well imagine
that somewhere far off, 150 miles away, a ship’s watch looked up,
startled, and later reported the oddest thing, that he thought he heard
a cat’s meow coming from three o’clock. Days later that roar was still
ringing in my guts. But a shark is deaf, conventionally speaking. So
while I, who wouldn’t think of pinching a tiger’s paw, let alone of
trying to swallow one, received a volcanic roar full in the face and
quaked and trembled and turned liquid with fear and collapsed, the shark
perceived only a dull vibration. Richard Parker turned and started
clawing the shark’s head with his free front paw and biting it with his
jaws, while his rear legs began tearing at its stomach and back. The
shark held on to his paw, its only line of defence and attack, and
thrashed its tail. Tiger and shark twisted and tumbled about. With great
effort I managed to gain enough control of my body to get onto the raft
and release it. The lifeboat drifted away. I saw flashes of orange and
deep blue, of fur and skin, as the lifeboat rocked from side to side.
Richard Parker’s snarling was simply terrifying. At last the boat
stopped moving. After several minutes Richard Parker sat up, licking his
left paw.</p>
<p>In the following days he spent much time tending his four paws. A
shark’s skin is covered with minute tubercles that make it as rough as
sandpaper. He had no doubt cut himself while repeatedly raking the
shark. His left paw was injured, but the damage did not seem permanent;
no toes or claws were missing. As for the mako, except for the tips of
the tail and the mouth area, incongruously untouched, it was a
half-eaten, butchered mess. Chunks of reddish grey flesh and clumps of
internal organs were strewn about. I managed to gaff some of the shark’s
remains, but to my disappointment the vertebrae of sharks do not hold
fluid. At least the flesh was tasty and unfishy, and the crunchiness of
cartilage was a welcome respite from so much soft food. Subsequently I
went for smaller sharks, pups really, and I killed them myself. I found
that stabbing them through the eyes with the knife was a faster, less
tiresome way of killing them than hacking at the tops of their heads
with the hatchet.</p>
