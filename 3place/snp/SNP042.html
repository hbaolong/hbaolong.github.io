<h4 id="chapter-40">Chapter 40</h4>
<p>Richard Parker did not jump into the water after me. The oar I
intended to use as a club floated. I held on to it as I reached for the
lifebuoy, now vacant of its previous occupant. It was terrifying to be
in the water. It was black and cold and in a rage. I felt as if I were
at the bottom of a crumbling well. Water kept crashing down on me. It
stung my eyes. It pulled me down. I could hardly breathe. If there
hadn’t been the lifebuoy I wouldn’t have lasted a minute. I saw a
triangle slicing the water fifteen feet away. It was a shark’s fin. An
awful tingle, cold and liquid, went up and down my spine. I swam as fast
as I could to one end of the lifeboat, the end still covered by the
tarpaulin. I pushed myself up on the lifebuoy with my arms. I couldn’t
see Richard Parker. He wasn’t on the tarpaulin or on a bench. He was at
the bottom of the lifeboat. I pushed myself up again. All I could see,
briefly, at the other end, was the zebra’s head thrashing about. As I
fell back into the water another shark’s fin glided right before me. The
bright orange tarpaulin was held down by a strong nylon rope that wove
its way between metal grommets in the tarpaulin and blunt hooks on the
side of the boat. I happened to be treading water at the bow. The
tarpaulin was not as securely fixed going over the stem-which had a very
short prow, what in a face would be called a snub nose-as it was
elsewhere around the boat. There was a little looseness in the tarpaulin
as the rope went from one hook on one side of the stem to the next hook
on the other side. I lifted the oar in the air and I shoved its handle
into this looseness, into this life-saving detail. I pushed the oar in
as far as it would go. The lifeboat now had a prow projecting over the
waves, if crookedly. I pulled myself up and wrapped my legs around the
oar. The oar handle pushed up against the tarpaulin, but tarpaulin, rope
and oar held. I was out of the water, if only by a fluctuating two,
three feet. The crest of the larger waves kept striking me. I was alone
and orphaned, in the middle of the Pacific, hanging on to an oar, an
adult tiger in front of me, sharks beneath me, a storm raging about me.
Had I considered my prospects in the light of reason, I surely would
have given up and let go of the oar, hoping that I might drown before
being eaten. But I don’t recall that I had a single thought during those
first minutes of relative safety. I didn’t even notice daybreak. I held
on to the oar, I just held on, God only knows why. After a while I made
good use of the lifebuoy. I lifted it out of the water and put the oar
through its hole. I worked it down until the ring was hugging me. Now it
was only with my legs that I had to hold on. If Richard Parker appeared,
it would be more awkward to drop from the oar, but one terror at a time,
Pacific before tiger.</p>
