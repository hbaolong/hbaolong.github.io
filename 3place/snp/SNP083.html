<h4 id="chapter-85">Chapter 85</h4>
<p>Once there was lightning. The sky was so black, day looked like
night. The downpour was heavy. I heard thunder far away. I thought it
would stay at that. But a wind came up, throwing the rain this way and
that. Right after, a white splinter came crashing down from the sky,
puncturing the water. It was some distance from the lifeboat, but the
effect was perfectly visible. The water was shot through with what
looked like white roots; briefly, a great celestial tree stood in the
ocean. I had never imagined such a thing possible, lightning striking
the sea. The clap of thunder was tremendous. The flash of light was
incredibly vivid. I turned to Richard Parker and said, “Look, Richard
Parker, a bolt of lightning.“ I saw how he felt about it. He was flat on
the floor of the boat, limbs splayed and visibly trembling. The effect
on me was completely the opposite. It was something to pull me out of my
limited mortal ways and thrust me into a state of exalted wonder.
Suddenly a bolt struck much closer. Perhaps it was meant for us: we had
just fallen off the crest of a swell and were sinking down its back when
its top was hit. There was an explosion of hot air and hot water. For
two, perhaps three seconds, a gigantic, blinding white shard of glass
from a broken cosmic window danced in the sky, insubstantial yet
overwhelmingly powerful. Ten thousand trumpets and twenty thousand drums
could not have made as much noise as that bolt of lightning; it was
positively deafening. The sea turned white and all colour disappeared.
Everything was either pure white light or pure black shadow. The light
did not seem to illuminate so much as to penetrate. As quickly as it had
appeared, the bolt vanished-the spray of hot water had not finished
landing upon us and already it was gone. The punished swell returned to
black and rolled on indifferently. I was dazed, thunderstruck-nearly in
the true sense of the word. But not afraid.</p>
<p>“Praise be to Allah, Lord of All Worlds, the Compassionate, the
Merciful, Ruler of Judgment Day!“ I muttered. To Richard Parker I
shouted, “Stop your trembling! This is miracle. This is an outbreak of
divinity. This is.. .this is…“ I could not find what it was, this thing
so vast and fantastic. I was breathless and wordless. I lay back on the
tarpaulin, arms and legs spread wide. The rain chilled me to the bone.
But I was smiling. I remember that close encounter with electrocution
and third-degree burns as one of the few times during my ordeal when I
felt genuine happiness. At moments of wonder, it is easy to avoid small
thinking, to entertain thoughts that span the universe, that capture
both thunder and tinkle, thick and thin, the near and the far.</p>
