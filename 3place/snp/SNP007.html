<h4 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h4>
<p>My name isn’t the end of the story about my name. When your name is
Bob no one asks you, “How do you spell that?“ Not so with Piscine
Molitor Patel. Some thought it was P. Singh and that I was a Sikh, and
they wondered why I wasn’t wearing a turban. In my university days I
visited Montreal once with some friends. It fell to me to order pizzas
one night. I couldn’t bear to have yet another French speaker guffawing
at my name, so when the man on the phone asked, “Can I ’ave your name?“
I said, “I am who I am.“ Half an hour later two pizzas arrived for “Ian
Hoolihan.“</p>
<p>It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly
that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names. Witness Simon
who is called Peter, Matthew also known as Levi, Nathaniel who is also
Bartholomew, Judas, not Iscariot, who took the name Thaddeus, Simeon who
went by Niger, Saul who became Paul. My Roman soldier stood in the
schoolyard one morning when I was twelve. I had just arrived. He saw me
and a flash of evil genius lit up his dull mind. He raised his arm,
pointed at me and shouted, “It’s Pissing Patel!“</p>
<p>In a second everyone was laughing. It fell away as we filed into the
class. I walked in last, wearing my crown of thorns. The cruelty of
children comes as news to no one. The words would waft across the yard
to my ears, unprovoked, uncalled for: “Where’s Pissing? I’ve got to go.“
Or: “You’re facing the wall. Are you Pissing?“ Or something of the sort.
I would freeze or, the contrary, pursue my activity, pretending not to
have heard. The sound would disappear, but the hurt would linger, like
the smell of piss long after it has evaporated. Teachers started doing
it too. It was the heat. As the day wore on, the geography lesson, which
in the morning had been as compact as an oasis, started to stretch out
like the Thar Desert; the history lesson, so alive when the day was
young, became parched and dusty; the mathematics lesson, so precise at
first, became muddled. In their afternoon fatigue, as they wiped their
foreheads and the backs of their necks with their handkerchiefs, without
meaning to offend or get a laugh, even teachers forgot the fresh aquatic
promise of my name and distorted it in a shameful way. By nearly
imperceptible modulations I could hear the change. It was as if their
tongues were charioteers driving wild horses. They could manage well
enough the first syllable, the Pea , but eventually the heat was too
much and they lost control of their frothy-mouthed steeds and could no
longer rein them in for the climb to the second syllable, the seen .
Instead they plunged hell-bent into sing , and next time round, all was
lost. My hand would be up to give an answer and it would be acknowledged
with a “Yes, Pissing .“ Often the teacher wouldn’t realize what he had
just called me. He would look at me wearily after a moment, wondering
why I wasn’t coming out with the answer. And sometimes the class, as
beaten down by the heat as he was, wouldn’t react either. Not a snicker
or a smile. But I always heard the slur. I spent my last year at
St. Joseph’s School feeling like the persecuted prophet Muhammad in
Mecca, peace be upon him. But just as he planned his flight to Medina,
the Hejira that would mark the beginning of Muslim time, I planned my
escape and the beginning of a new time for me. After St. Joseph’s, I
went to Petit Seminaire, the best private English-medium secondary
school in Pondicherry. Ravi was already there, and like all younger
brothers, I would suffer from following in the footsteps of a popular
older sibling. He was the athlete of his generation at Petit Seminaire,
a fearsome bowler and a Powerful batter, the captain of the town’s best
cricket team, our very own Kapil Dev. That I was a swimmer made no
waves; it seems to be a law of human nature that those who live by the
sea are suspicious of swimmers, just as those who live in the mountains
are suspicious of mountain climbers. But following in someone’s shadow
wasn’t my escape, though I would have taken any name over “Pissing,“
even “Ravi’s brother.“ I had a better plan than that. I put it to
execution on the very first day of school, in the very first class.
Around me were other alumni of St. Joseph’s. The class started the way
all new classes start, with the stating of names. We called them out
from our desks in the order in which we happened to be sitting.</p>
<p>“Ganapathy Kumar,“ said Ganapathy Kumar.</p>
<p>“Vipin Nath,“ said Vipin Nath.</p>
<p>“Shamshool Hudha,“ said Shamshool Hudha.</p>
<p>“Peter Dharmaraj,“ said Peter Dharmaraj. Each name elicited a tick on
a list and a brief mnemonic stare from the teacher. I was terribly
nervous.</p>
<p>“Ajith Giadson,“ said Ajith Giadson, four desks away… “Sampath
Saroja,“ said Sampath Saroja, three away… “Stanley Kumar,“ said Stanley
Kumar, two away. “Sylvester Naveen,“ said Sylvester Naveen, right in
front of me. It was my turn. Time to put down Satan. Medina, here I
come. I got up from my desk and hurried to the blackboard. Before the
teacher could say a word, I picked up a piece of chalk and said as I
wrote:</p>
<p>My name is Piscine Molitor Patel, known to all as</p>
<p>-I double underlined the first two letters of my given name-</p>
<p>Pi Patel</p>
<p>For good measure I added</p>
<p>n = 3.14</p>
<p>and I drew a large circle, which I then sliced in two with a
diameter, to evoke that basic lesson of geometry. There was silence. The
teacher was staring at the board. I was holding my breath. Then he said,
“Very well, Pi. Sit down. Next time you will ask permission before
leaving your desk.“ “Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>He ticked my name off. And looked at the next boy. “Mansoor Ahamad,“
said Mansoor Ahamad. I was saved.</p>
<p>“Gautham Selvaraj,“ said Gautham Selvaraj. I could breathe.</p>
<p>“Arun Annaji,“ said Arun Annaji. A new beginning. I repeated the
stunt with every teacher. Repetition is important in the training not
only of animals but also of humans. Between one commonly named boy and
the next, I rushed forward and emblazoned, sometimes with a terrible
screech, the details of my rebirth. It got to be that after a few times
the boys sang along with me, a crescendo that climaxed, after a quick
intake of air while I underlined the proper note, with such a rousing
rendition of my new name that it would have been the delight of any
choirmaster. A few boys followed up with a whispered, urgent “Three!
Point! One! Four!“ as I wrote as fast as I could, and I ended the
concert by slicing the circle with such vigour that bits of chalk went
flying. When I put my hand up that day, which I did every chance I had,
teachers granted me the right to speak with a single syllable that was
music to my ears. Students followed suit. Even the St. Joseph’s devils.
In fact, the name caught on. Truly we are a nation of aspiring
engineers: shortly after, there was a boy named Omprakash who was
calling himself Omega, and another who was passing himself off as
Upsilon, and for a while there was a Gamma, a Lambda and a Delta. But I
was the first and the most enduring of the Greeks at Petit Seminaire.
Even my brother, the captain of the cricket team, that local god,
approved. He took me aside the next week.</p>
<p>“What’s this I hear about a nickname you have?“ he said. I kept
silent. Because whatever mocking was to come, it was to come. There was
no avoiding it.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize you liked the colour yellow so much.“</p>
<p>The colour yellow? I looked around. No one must hear what he was
about to say, especially not one of his lackeys. “Ravi, what do you
mean?“ I whispered.</p>
<p>“It’s all right with me, brother. Anything’s better than ‘Pissing’.
Even ‘Lemon Pie’.“ As he sauntered away he smiled and said, “You look a
bit red in the face.“ But he held his peace. And so, in that Greek
letter that looks like a shack with a corrugated tin roof, in that
elusive, irrational number with which scientists try to understand the
universe, I found refuge.</p>
