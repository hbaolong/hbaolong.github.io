<h4 id="chapter-78">Chapter 78</h4>
<p>There were many skies. The sky was invaded by great white clouds,
flat on the bottom but round and billowy on top. The sky was completely
cloudless, of a blue quite shattering to the senses. The sky was a
heavy, suffocating blanket of grey cloud, but without promise of rain.
The sky was thinly overcast. The sky was dappled with small, white,
fleecy clouds. The sky was streaked with high, thin clouds that looked
like a cotton ball stretched apart. The sky was a featureless milky
haze. The sky was a density of dark and blustery rain clouds that passed
by without delivering rain. The sky was painted with a small number of
flat clouds that looked like sandbars. The sky was a mere block to allow
a visual effect on the horizon: sunlight flooding the ocean, the
vertical edges between light and shadow perfectly distinct. The sky was
a distant black curtain of falling rain. The sky was many clouds at many
levels, some thick and opaque, others looking like smoke. The sky was
black and spitting rain on my smiling face. The sky was nothing but
falling water, a ceaseless deluge that wrinkled and bloated my skin and
froze me stiff. There were many seas. The sea roared like a tiger. The
sea whispered in your ear like a friend telling you secrets. The sea
clinked like small change in a pocket. The sea thundered like
avalanches. The sea hissed like sandpaper working on wood. The sea
sounded like someone vomiting. The sea was dead silent. And in between
the two, in between the sky and the sea, were all the winds. And there
were all the nights and all the moons. To be a castaway is to be a point
perpetually at the centre of a circle. However much things may appear to
change-the sea may shift from whisper to rage, the sky might go from
fresh blue to blinding white to darkest black-the geometry never
changes. Your gaze is always a radius. The circumference is ever great.
In fact, the circles multiply. To be a castaway is to be caught in a
harrowing ballet of circles. You are at the centre of one circle, while
above you two opposing circles spin about. The sun distresses you like a
crowd, a noisy, invasive crowd that makes you cup your ears, that makes
you close your eyes, that makes you want to hide. The moon distresses
you by silently reminding you of your solitude; you open your eyes wide
to escape your loneliness. When you look up, you sometimes wonder if at
the centre of a solar storm, if in the middle of the Sea of
Tranquillity, there isn’t another one like you also looking up, also
trapped by geometry, also struggling with fear, rage, madness,
hopelessness, apathy. Otherwise, to be a castaway is to be caught up in
grim and exhausting opposites. When it is light, the openness of the sea
is blinding and frightening. When it is dark, the darkness is
claustrophobic. When it is day, you are hot and wish to be cool and
dream of ice cream and pour sea water on yourself. When it is night you
are cold and wish to be warm and dream of hot curries; and wrap yourself
in blankets. When it is hot, you are parched and wish to be wet. When it
rains, you are nearly drowned and wish to be dry. When there is food,
there is too much of it and you must feast. When there is none, there is
truly none and you starve. When the sea is flat and motionless, you wish
it would stir. When it rises up and the circle that imprisons you is
broken by hills of water, you suffer that peculiarity of the high seas,
suffocation in open spaces, and you wish the sea would be flat again.
The opposites often take place at the same moment, so that when the sun
is scorching you till you are stricken down, you are also aware that it
is drying the strips of fish and meat that are hanging from your lines
and that it is a blessing for your solar stills. Conversely, when a rain
squall is replenishing your fresh water supplies, you also know that the
humidity will affect your cured provisions and that some will probably
go bad, turning pasty and green. When rough weather abates, and it
becomes clear that you have survived the sky’s attack and the sea’s
treachery, your jubilation is tempered by the rage that so much fresh
water should fall directly into the sea and by the worry that it is the
last rain you will ever see, that you will die of thirst before the next
drops fall.</p>
<p>The worst pair of opposites is boredom and terror. Sometimes your
life is a pendulum swing from one to the other. The sea is without a
wrinkle. There is not a whisper of wind. The hours last forever. You are
so bored you sink into a state of apathy close to a coma. Then the sea
becomes rough and your emotions are whipped into a frenzy. Yet even
these two opposites do not remain distinct. In your boredom there are
elements of terror: you break down into tears; you are filled with
dread; you scream; you deliberately hurt yourself And in the grip of
terror-the worst storm-you yet feel boredom, a deep weariness with it
all. Only death consistently excites your emotions, whether
contemplating it when life is safe and stale, or fleeing it when life is
threatened and precious. Life on a lifeboat isn’t much of a life. It is
like an end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn’t
be more simple, nor the stakes higher. Physically it is extraordinarily
arduous, and morally it is killing. You must make adjustments if you
want to survive. Much becomes expendable. You get your happiness where
you can. You reach a point where you’re at the bottom of hell, yet you
have your arms crossed and a smile on your face, and you feel you’re the
luckiest person on earth. Why? Because at your feet you have a tiny dead
fish.</p>
