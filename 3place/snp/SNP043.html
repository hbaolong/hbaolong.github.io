<h4 id="chapter-41">Chapter 41</h4>
<p>The elements allowed me to go on living. The lifeboat did not sink.
Richard Parker kept out of sight. The sharks prowled but did not lunge.
The waves splashed me but did not pull me off. I watched the ship as it
disappeared with much burbling and belching. Lights flickered and went
out. I looked about for my family, for survivors, for another lifeboat,
for anything that might bring me hope. There was nothing. Only rain,
marauding waves of black ocean and the flotsam of tragedy. The darkness
melted away from the sky. The rain stopped. I could not stay in the
position I was in forever. I was cold. My neck was sore from holding up
my head and from all the craning I had been doing. My back hurt from
leaning against the lifebuoy. And I needed to be higher up if I were to
see other lifeboats. I inched my way along the oar till my feet were
against the bow of the boat. I had to proceed with extreme caution. My
guess was that Richard Parker was on the floor of the lifeboat beneath
the tarpaulin, his back to me, facing the zebra, which he had no doubt
killed by now. Of the five senses, tigers rely the most on their sight.
Their eyesight is very keen, especially in detecting motion. Their
hearing is good. Their smell is average. I mean compared to other
animals, of course. Next to Richard Parker, I was deaf, blind and
nose-dead. But at the moment he could not see me, and in my wet
condition could probably not smell me, and what with the whistling of
the wind and the hissing of the sea as waves broke, if I were careful,
he would not hear me. I had a chance so long as he did not sense me. If
he did, he would kill me right away. Could he burst through the
tarpaulin, I wondered. Fear and reason fought over the answer. Fear said
Yes. He was a fierce, 450-pound carnivore. Each of his claws was as
sharp as a knife. Reason said No. The tarpaulin was sturdy canvas, not a
Japanese paper wall. I had landed upon it from a height. Richard Parker
could shred it with his claws with a little time and effort, but he
couldn’t pop through it like a jack-in-the-box. And he had not seen me.
Since he had not seen me, he had no reason to claw his way through it. I
slid along the oar. I brought both my legs to one side of the oar and
placed my feet on the gunnel. The gunnel is the top edge of a boat, the
rim if you want. I moved a little more till my legs were on the boat. I
kept my eyes fixed on the horizon of the tarpaulin. Any second I
expected to see Richard Parker rising up and coming for me. Several
times I had fits of fearful trembling. Precisely where I wanted to be
most still-my legs-was where I trembled most. My legs drummed upon the
tarpaulin. A more obvious rapping on Richard Parker’s door couldn’t be
imagined. The trembling spread to my arms and it was all I could do to
hold on. Each fit passed. When enough of my body was on the boat I
pulled myself up. I looked beyond the end of the tarpaulin. I was
surprised to see that the zebra was still alive. It lay near the stern,
where it had fallen, listless, but its stomach was still panting and its
eyes were still moving, expressing terror. It was on its side, facing
me, its head and neck awkwardly propped against the boat’s side bench.
It had badly broken a rear leg. The angle of it was completely
unnatural. Bone protruded through skin and there was bleeding. Only its
slim front legs had a semblance of normal position. They were bent and
neatly tucked against its twisted torso. From time to time the zebra
shook its head and barked and snorted. Otherwise it lay quietly. It was
a lovely animal. Its wet markings glowed brightly white and intensely
black. I was so eaten up by anxiety that I couldn’t dwell on it; still,
in passing, as a faint afterthought, the queer, clean, artistic boldness
of its design and the fineness of its head struck me. Of greater
significance to me was the strange fact that Richard Parker had not
killed it. In the normal course of things he should have killed the
zebra. That’s what predators do: they kill prey. In the present
circumstances, where Richard Parker would be under tremendous mental
strain, fear should have brought out an exceptional level of aggression.
The zebra should have been properly butchered. The reason behind its
spared life was revealed shortly. It froze my blood-and then brought a
slight measure of relief. A head appeared beyond the end of the
tarpaulin. It looked at me in a direct, frightened way, ducked under,
appeared again, ducked under again, appeared once more, disappeared a
last time. It was the bear-like, balding-looking head of a spotted
hyena. Our zoo had a clan of six, two dominant females and four
subordinate males. They were supposed to be going to Minnesota. The one
here was a male. I recognized it by its right ear, which was badly torn,
its healed jagged edge testimony to old violence. Now I understood why
Richard Parker had not killed the zebra: he was no longer aboard. There
couldn’t be both a hyena and a tiger in such a small space. He must have
fallen off the tarpaulin and drowned. I had to explain to myself how a
hyena had come to be on the lifeboat. I doubted hyenas were capable of
swimming in open seas. I concluded that it must have been on board all
along, hiding under the tarpaulin, and that I hadn’t noticed it when I
landed with a bounce. I realized something else: the hyena was the
reason those sailors had thrown me into the lifeboat. They weren’t
trying to save my life. That was the last of their concerns. They were
using me as fodder. They were hoping that the hyena would attack me and
that somehow I would get rid of it and make the boat safe for them, no
matter if it cost me my life. Now I knew what they were pointing at so
furiously just before the zebra appeared. I never thought that finding
myself confined in a small space with a spotted hyena would be good
news, but there you go. In fact, the good news was double: if it weren’t
for this hyena, the sailor wouldn’t have thrown me into the lifeboat and
I would have stayed on the ship and I surely would have drowned; and if
I had to share quarters with a wild animal, better the upfront ferocity
of a dog than the power and stealth of a cat. I breathed the smallest
sigh of relief. As a precautionary measure I moved onto the oar. I sat
astride it, on the rounded edge of the speared lifebuoy, my left foot
against the tip of the prow, my right foot on the gunnel. It was
comfortable enough and I was facing the boat. I looked about. Nothing
but sea and sky. The same when we were at the top of a swell. The sea
briefly imitated every land feature-every hill, every valley, every
plain. Accelerated geotectonics. Around the world in eighty swells. But
nowhere on it could I find my family. Things floated in the water but
none that brought me hope. I could see no other lifeboats. The weather
was changing rapidly. The sea, so immense, so breathtakingly immense,
was settling into a smooth and steady motion, with the waves at heel;
the wind was softening to a tuneful breeze; fluffy, radiantly white
clouds were beginning to light up in a vast fathomless dome of delicate
pale blue. It was the dawn of a beautiful day in the Pacific Ocean. My
shirt was already beginning to dry. The night had vanished as quickly as
the ship. I began to wait. My thoughts swung wildly. I was either fixed
on practical details of immediate survival or transfixed by pain,
weeping silently, my mouth open and my hands at my head.</p>
