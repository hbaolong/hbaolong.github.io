<h4 id="chapter-33">Chapter 33</h4>
<p>He shows me family memorabilia. Wedding photos first. A Hindu wedding
with Canada prominently on the edges. A younger him, a younger her. They
went to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon. Had a lovely time. Smiles to
prove it. We move back in time. Photos from his student days at U of T:
with friends; in front of St. Mike’s; in his room; during Diwali on
Gerrard Street; reading at St. Basil’s Church dressed in a white gown;
wearing another kind of white gown in a lab of the zoology department;
on graduation day. A smile every time, but his eyes tell another story.
Photos from Brazil, with plenty of three-toed sloths in situ . With a
turn of a page we jump over the Pacific-and there is next to nothing. He
tells me that the camera did click regularly-on all the usual important
occasions-but everything was lost. What little there is consists of what
was assembled by Mamaji and mailed over after the events. There is a
photo taken at the zoo during the visit of a V.I.P. In black and white
another world is revealed to me. The photo is crowded with people. A
Union cabinet minister is the focus of attention. There’s a giraffe in
the background. Near the edge of the group, I recognize a younger
Mr. Adirubasamy.</p>
<p>“Mamaji?“ I ask, pointing.</p>
<p>“Yes,“ he says. There’s a man next to the minister, with horn-rimmed
glasses and hair very cleanly combed. He looks like a plausible
Mr. Patel, face rounder than his son’s. “Is this your father?“ I ask. He
shakes his head. “I don’t know who that is.“</p>
<p>There’s a pause of a few seconds. He says, “It’s my father who took
the picture.“ On the same page there’s another group shot, mostly of
schoolchildren. He taps the photo.</p>
<p>“That’s Richard Parker,“ he says. I’m amazed. I look closely, trying
to extract personality from appearance. Unfortunately, it’s black and
white again and a little out of focus. A photo taken in better days,
casually. Richard Parker is looking away. He doesn’t even realize that
his picture is being taken. The opposing page is entirely taken up by a
colour photo of the swimming pool of the Aurobindo Ashram. It’s a nice
big outdoor pool with clear, sparkling water, a clean blue bottom and an
attached diving pool. The next page features a photo of the front gate
of Petit Seminaire school An arch has the school’s motto painted on it:
Nil magnum nisi bonum . No greatness without goodness. And that’s it. An
entire childhood memorialized in four nearly irrelevant photographs. He
grows sombre.</p>
<p>“The worst of it,“ he says, “is that I can hardly remember what my
mother looks like any more. I can see her in my mind, but it’s fleeting.
As soon as I try to have a good look at her, she fades. It’s the same
with her voice. If I saw her again in the street, it would all come
back. But that’s not likely to happen. It’s very sad not to remember
what your mother looks like.“</p>
<p>He closes the book.</p>
