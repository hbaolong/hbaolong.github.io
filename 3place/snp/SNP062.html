<h4 id="chapter-62">Chapter 62</h4>
<p>I slept in fits that night. Shortly before sunrise I gave up trying
to fall asleep again and lifted myself on an elbow. I spied with my
little eye a tiger. Richard Parker was restless. He was moaning and
growling and pacing about the lifeboat. It was impressive. I assessed
the situation. He couldn’t be hungry. Or at least not dangerously
hungry. Was he thirsty? His tongue hung from his mouth, but only on
occasion, and he was not panting. And his stomach and paws were still
wet. But they were not dripping wet. There probably wasn’t much water
left in the boat. Soon he would be thirsty. I looked up at the sky. The
cloud cover had vanished. But for a few wisps on the horizon, the sky
was clear. It would be another hot, rainless day. The sea moved in a
lethargic way, as if already exhausted by the oncoming heat. I sat
against the mast and thought over our problem. The biscuits and the
fishing gear assured us of the solid part of our diet. It was the liquid
part that was the rub. It all came down to what was so abundant around
us but marred by salt. I could perhaps mix some sea water with his fresh
water, but I had to procure more fresh water to start with. The cans
would not last long between the two of us-in fact, I was loath to share
even one with Richard Parker-and it would be foolish to rely on
rainwater. The solar stills were the only other possible source of
drinkable water. I looked at them doubtfully. They had been out two days
now. I noticed that one of them had lost a little air. I pulled on the
rope to tend to it. I topped off its cone with air. Without any real
expectation I reached underwater for the distillate pouch that was
clipped to the round buoyancy chamber. My fingers took hold of a bag
that was unexpectedly fat. A shiver of thrill went through me. I
controlled myself. As likely as not, salt water had leaked in. I
unhooked the pouch and, following the instructions, lowered it and
tilted the still so that any more water from beneath the cone might flow
into it. I closed the two small taps that led to the pouch, detached it
and pulled it out of the water. It was rectangular in shape and made of
thick, soft, yellow plastic, with calibration marks on one side. I
tasted the water. I tasted it again. It was salt-free.</p>
<p>“My sweet sea cow!“ I exclaimed to the solar still. “You’ve produced,
and how! What a delicious milk. Mind you, a little rubbery, but I’m not
complaining. Why, look at me drink!“</p>
<p>I finished the bag. It had a capacity of one litre and was nearly
full. After a moment of sigh-producing, shut-eyed satisfaction, I
reattached the pouch. I checked the other stills. Each one had an udder
similarly heavy. I collected the fresh milk, over eight litres of it, in
the fish bucket. Instantly these technological contraptions became as
precious to me as cattle are to a farmer. Indeed, as they floated
placidly in an arc, they looked almost like cows grazing in a field. I
ministered to their needs, making sure that there was enough sea water
inside each and that the cones and chambers were inflated to just the
right pressure. After adding a little sea water to the bucket’s
contents, I placed it on the side bench just beyond the tarpaulin. With
the end of the morning coolness, Richard Parker seemed safely settled
below. I tied the bucket in place using rope and the tarpaulin hooks on
the side of the boat. I carefully peeked over the gunnel. He was lying
on his side. His den was a foul sight. The dead mammals were heaped
together, a grotesque pile of decayed animal parts. I recognized a leg
or two, various patches of hide, parts of a head, a great number of
bones. Flying-fish wings were scattered about. I cut up a flying fish
and tossed a piece onto the side bench. After I had gathered what I
needed for the day from the locker and was ready to go, I tossed another
piece over the tarpaulin in front of Richard Parker. It had the intended
effect. As I drifted away I saw him come out into the open to fetch the
morsel of fish. His head turned and he noticed the other morsel and the
new object next to it. He lifted himself. He hung his huge head over the
bucket. I was afraid he would tip it over. He didn’t. His face
disappeared into it, barely fitting, and he started to lap up the water.
In very little time the bucket started shaking and rattling emptily with
each strike of his tongue. When he looked up, I stared him aggressively
in the eyes and I blew on the whistle a few times. He disappeared under
the tarpaulin. It occurred to me that with every passing day the
lifeboat was resembling a zoo enclosure more and more: Richard Parker
had his sheltered area for sleeping and resting, his food stash, his
lookout and now his water hole. The temperature climbed. The heat became
stifling. I spent the rest of the day in the shade of the canopy,
fishing. It seems I had had beginner’s luck with that first dorado. I
caught nothing the whole day, not even in the late afternoon, when
marine life appeared in abundance. A turtle turned up, a different kind
this time, a green sea turtle, bulkier and smoother-shelled, but curious
in the same fixed way as a hawksbill. I did nothing about it, but I
started thinking that I should. The only good thing about the day being
so hot was the sight the solar stills presented. Every cone was covered
on the inside with drops and rivulets of condensation. The day ended. I
calculated that the next morning would make it a week since the Tsimtsum
had sunk. Chapter 63</p>
<p>The Robertson family survived thirty-eight days at sea. Captain Bligh
of the celebrated mutinous Bounty and his fellow castaways survived
forty-seven days. Steven Callahan survived seventy-six. Owen Chase,
whose account of the sinking of the whaling ship Essex by a whale
inspired Herman Melville, survived eighty-three days at sea with two
mates, interrupted by a one-week stay on an inhospitable island. The
Bailey family survived 118 days. I have heard of a Korean merchant
sailor named Poon, I believe, who survived the Pacific for 173 days in
the 1950s. I survived 227 days. That’s how long my trial lasted, over
seven months. I kept myself busy. That was one key to my survival. On a
lifeboat, even on a raft, there’s always something that needs doing. An
average day for me, if such a notion can be applied to a castaway, went
like this:</p>
<p>Sunrise to mid-morning:</p>
<p>wake up prayers</p>
<p>breakfast for Richard Parker general inspection of raft and lifeboat,
with particular attention paid to all knots and ropes tending of solar
stills (wiping, inflating, topping off with water) breakfast and
inspection of food stores fishing and preparing of fish if any caught
(gutting, cleaning, hanging of strips of flesh on lines to cure in the
sun)</p>
<p>Mid-morning to late afternoon:</p>
<p>prayers light lunch rest and restful activities (writing in diary,
examining of scabs and sores, upkeeping of equipment, puttering about
locker, observation and study of Richard Parker, picking-at of turtle
bones, etc.)</p>
<p>Late afternoon to early evening:</p>
<p>prayers fishing and preparing of fish tending of curing strips of
flesh (turning over, cutting away of putrid parts) dinner preparations
dinner for self and Richard Parker</p>
<p>Sunset:</p>
<p>general inspection of raft and lifeboat (knots and ropes again)
collecting and safekeeping of distillate from solar stills storing of
all foods and equipment arrangements for night (making of bed, safe
storage on raft of flare, in case of ship, and rain catcher, in case of
rain) prayers</p>
<p>Night:</p>
<p>fitful sleeping prayers</p>
<p>Mornings were usually better than late afternoons, when the emptiness
of time tended to make itself felt. Any number of events affected this
routine. Rainfall, at any time of the day or night, stopped all other
business; for as long as it fell, I held up the rain catchers and was
feverishly occupied storing their catch. A turtle’s visit was another
major disruption. And Richard Parker, of course, was a regular
disturbance. Accommodating him was a priority I could not neglect for an
instant. He didn’t have much of a routine beyond eating, drinking and
sleeping, but there were times when he stirred from his lethargy and
rambled about his territory, making noises and being cranky. Thankfully,
every time, the sun and the sea quickly tired him and he returned to
beneath the tarpaulin, to lying on his side again, or flat on his
stomach, his head on top of his crossed front legs. But there was more
to my dealings with him than strict necessity. I also spent hours
observing him because it was a distraction. A tiger is a fascinating
animal at any time, and all the more so when it is your sole companion.
At first, looking out for a ship was something I did all the time,
compulsively. But after a few weeks, five or six, I stopped doing it
nearly entirely. And I survived because I made a point of forgetting. My
story started on a calendar day-July 2nd, 1977-and ended on a calendar
day-February 14th, 1978-but in between there was no calendar. I did not
count the days or the weeks or the months. Time is an illusion that only
makes us pant. I survived because I forgot even the very notion of time.
What I remember are events and encounters and routines, markers that
emerged here and there from the ocean of time and imprinted themselves
on my memory. The smell of spent hand-flare shells, and prayers at dawn,
and the killing of turtles, and the biology of algae, for example. And
many more. But I don’t know if I can put them in order for you. My
memories come in a jumble.</p>
