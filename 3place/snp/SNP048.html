<h4 id="chapter-46">Chapter 46</h4>
<p>Clouds that gathered where ships were supposed to appear, and the
passing of the day, slowly did the job of unbending my smile. It is
pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life. I
have so many bad nights to choose from that I’ve made none the champion.
Still, that second night at sea stands in my memory as one of
exceptional suffering, different from the frozen anxiety of the first
night in being a more conventional sort of suffering, the broken-down
kind consisting of weeping and sadness and spiritual pain, and different
from later ones in that I still had the strength to appreciate fully
what I felt. And that dreadful night was preceded by a dreadful evening.
I noticed the presence of sharks around the lifeboat. The sun was
beginning to pull the curtains on the day. It was a placid explosion of
orange and red, a great chromatic symphony, a colour canvas of
supernatural proportions, truly a splendid Pacific sunset, quite wasted
on me. The sharks were makos-swift, pointy-snouted predators with long,
murderous teeth that protruded noticeably from their mouths. They were
about six or seven feet long, one was larger still. I watched them
anxiously. The largest one came at the boat quickly, as if to attack,
its dorsal fin rising out of the water by several inches, but it dipped
below just before reaching us and glided underfoot with fearsome grace.
It returned, not coming so close this time, then disappeared. The other
sharks paid a longer visit, coming and going at different depths, some
in plain sight at hand’s reach below the surface of the water, others
deeper down. There were other fish too, big and small, colourful,
differently shaped. I might have considered them more closely had my
attention not been drawn elsewhere: Orange Juice’s head came into sight.
She turned and brought her arm onto the tarpaulin in a motion that
imitated exactly the way you or I would bring out an arm and place it on
the back of the chair next to our own in a gesture of expansive
relaxation. But such was clearly not her disposition. Bearing an
expression profoundly sad and mournful, she began to look about, slowly
turning her head from side to side. Instantly the likeness of apes lost
its amusing character. She had given birth at the zoo to two young ones,
strapping males five and eight years old that were her-and our-pride. It
was unmistakably these she had on her mind as she searched over the
water, unintentionally mimicking what I had been doing these last
thirty-six hours. She noticed me and expressed nothing about it. I was
just another animal that had lost everything and was vowed to death. My
mood plummeted. Then, with only a snarl for notice, the hyena went amok.
It hadn’t moved from its cramped quarters all day. It put its front legs
on the zebra’s side, reached over and gathered a fold of skin in its
jaws. It pulled roughly. A strip of hide came off the zebra’s belly like
gift-wrap paper comes off a gift, in a smooth-edged swath, only
silently, in the way of tearing skin, and with greater resistance.
Immediately blood poured forth like a river. Barking, snorting and
squealing, the zebra came to life to defend itself. It pushed on its
front legs and reared its head in an attempt to bite the hyena, but the
beast was out of reach. It shook its good hind leg, which did no more
than explain the origin of the previous night’s knocking: it was the
hoof beating against the side of the boat. The zebras attempts at
self-preservation only whipped the hyena into a frenzy of snarling and
biting. It made a gaping wound in the zebra’s side. When it was no
longer satisfied with the reach it had from behind the zebra, the hyena
climbed onto its haunches. It started pulling out coils of intestines
and other viscera. There was no order to what it was doing. It bit here,
swallowed there, seemingly overwhelmed by the riches before it. After
devouring half the liver, it started tugging on the whitish,
balloon-like stomach bag. But it was heavy, and with the zebra’s
haunches being higher than its belly-and blood being slippery-the hyena
started to slide into its victim. It plunged head and shoulders into the
zebra’s guts, up to the knees of its front legs. It pushed itself out,
only to slide back down. It finally settled in this position, half in,
half out. The zebra was being eaten alive from the inside. It protested
with diminishing vigour. Blood started coming out its nostrils. Once or
twice it reared its head straight up, as if appealing to heaven-the
abomination of the moment was perfectly expressed. Orange Juice did not
view these doings indifferently. She raised herself to her full height
on her bench. With her incongruously small legs and massive torso, she
looked like a refrigerator on crooked wheels. But with her giant arms
lifted in the air, she looked impressive. Their span was greater than
her height-one hand hung over the water, the other reached across the
width of the lifeboat nearly to the opposite side. She pulled back her
lips, showing off enormous canines, and began to roar . It was a deep,
powerful, huffing roar, amazing for an animal normally as silent as a
giraffe. The hyena was as startled as I was by the outburst. It cringed
and retreated. But not for long. After an intense stare at Orange Juice,
the hairs on its neck and shoulders stood up and its tail rose straight
in the air. It climbed back onto the dying zebra. There, blood dripping
from its mouth, it responded to Orange Juice in kind, with a
higher-pitched roar. The two animals were three feet apart, wide-open
jaws directly facing. They put all their energies into their cries,
their bodies shaking with the effort. I could see deep down the hyena’s
throat. The Pacific air, which until a minute before had been carrying
the whistling and whispering of the sea, a natural melody I would have
called soothing had the circumstances been happier, was all at once
filled with this appalling noise, like the fury of an all-out battle,
with the ear-splitting firing of guns and cannons and the thunderous
blasts of bombs. The hyena’s roar filled the higher range of what my
ears could hear, Orange Juice’s bass roar filled the lower range, and
somewhere in between I could hear the cries of the helpless zebra. My
ears were full. Nothing more, not one more sound, could push into them
and be registered. I began to tremble uncontrollably. I was convinced
the hyena was going to lunge at Orange Juice.</p>
<p>I could not imagine that matters could get worse, but they did. The
zebra snorted some of its blood overboard. Seconds later there was a
hard knock against the boat, followed by another. The water began to
churn around us with sharks. They were searching for the source of the
blood, for the food so close at hand. Their tail fins flashed out of the
water, their heads swung out. The boat was hit repeatedly. I was not
afraid we would capsize-I thought the sharks would actually punch
through the metal hull and sink us. With every bang the animals jumped
and looked alarmed, but they were not to be distracted from their main
business of roaring in each others faces. I was certain the shouting
match would turn physical. Instead it broke off abruptly after a few
minutes. Orange Juice, with huffs and lip-smacking noises, turned away,
and the hyena lowered its head and retreated behind the zebra’s
butchered body. The sharks, finding nothing, stopped knocking on the
boat and eventually left. Silence fell at last. A foul and pungent
smell, an earthy mix of rust and excrement, hung in the air. There was
blood everywhere, coagulating to a deep red crust. A single fly buzzed
about, sounding to me like an alarm bell of insanity. No ship, nothing
at all, had appeared on the horizon that day, and now the day was
ending. When the sun slipped below the horizon, it was not only the day
that died and the poor zebra, but my family as well. With that second
sunset, disbelief gave way to pain and grief. They were dead; I could no
longer deny it. What a thing to acknowledge in your heart! To lose a
brother is to lose someone with whom you can share the experience of
growing old, who is supposed to bring you a sister-in-law and nieces and
nephews, creatures to people the tree of your life and give it new
branches. To lose your father is to lose the one whose guidance and help
you seek, who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches. To
lose your mother, well, that is like losing the sun above you. It is
like losing-I’m sorry, I would rather not go on. I lay down on the
tarpaulin and spent the whole night weeping and grieving, my face buried
in my arms. The hyena spent a good part of the night eating. Chapter
47</p>
<p>The day broke, humid and overcast, with the wind warm and the sky a
dense blanket of grey clouds that looked like bunched-up, dirty cotton
sheets. The sea had not changed. It heaved the lifeboat up and down in a
regular motion. The zebra was still alive. I couldn’t believe it. It had
a two-foot-wide hole in its body, a fistula like a freshly erupted
volcano, spewed half-eaten organs glistening in the light or giving off
a dull, dry shine, yet, in its strictly essential parts, it continued to
pump with life, if weakly. Movement was confined to a tremor in the rear
leg and an occasional blinking of the eyes. I was horrified. I had no
idea a living being could sustain so much injury and go on living. The
hyena was tense. It was not settling down to its night of rest despite
the daylight. Perhaps it was a result of taking in so much food; its
stomach was grossly dilated. Orange Juice was in a dangerous mood too.
She was fidgeting and showing her teeth. I stayed where I was, curled up
near the prow. I was weak in body and in soul. I was afraid I would fall
into the water if I tried to balance on the oar. The zebra was dead by
noon. It was glassy-eyed and had become perfectly indifferent to the
hyena’s occasional assaults. Violence broke out in the afternoon.
Tension had risen to an unbearable level. The hyena was yipping. Orange
Juice was grunting and making loud lip-smacking noises. All of a sudden
their complaining fused and shot up to top volume. The hyena jumped over
the remains of the zebra and made for Orange Juice. I believe I have
made clear the menace of a hyena. It was certainly so clear in my mind
that I gave up on Orange Juice’s life before she even had a chance to
defend it. I underestimated her. I underestimated her grit. She thumped
the beast on the head. It was something shocking. It made my heart melt
with love and admiration and fear. Did I mention she was a former pet,
callously discarded by her Indonesian owners? Her story was like that of
every inappropriate pet. It goes something like this: The pet is bought
when it is small and cute. It gives much amusement to its owners. Then
it grows in size and in appetite. It reveals itself incapable of being
house-trained. Its increasing strength makes it harder to handle. One
day the maid pulls the sheet from its nest because she has decided to
wash it, or the son jokingly pinches a morsel of food from its
hands-over some such seemingly small matter, the pet flashes its teeth
in anger and the family is frightened. The very next day the pet finds
itself bouncing at the back of the family Jeep in the company of its
human brothers and sisters. A jungle is entered. Everyone in the vehicle
finds it a strange and formidable place. A clearing is come to. It is
briefly explored. All of a sudden the Jeep roars to life and its wheels
kick up dirt and the pet sees all the ones it has known and loved
looking at it from the back window as the Jeep speeds away. It has been
left behind. The pet does not understand. It is as unprepared for this
jungle as its human siblings are. It waits around for their return,
trying to quell the panic rising in it. They do not return. The sun
sets. Quickly it becomes depressed and gives up on life. It dies of
hunger and exposure in the next few days. Or is attacked by dogs. Orange
Juice could have been one of these forlorn pets. Instead she ended up at
the Pondicherry Zoo. She remained gentle and unaggressive her whole
life. I have memories from when I was a child of her never-ending arms
surrounding me, her fingers, each as long as my whole hand, picking at
my hair. She was a young female practising her maternal skills. As she
matured into her full wild self, I observed her at a distance. I thought
I knew her so well that I could predict her every move. I thought I knew
not only her habits but also her limits. This display of ferocity, of
savage courage, made me realize that I was wrong. All my life I had
known only a part of her. She thumped the beast on the head. And what a
thump it was. The beast’s head hit the bench it had just reached, making
such a sharp noise, besides splaying its front legs flat out, that I
thought surely either the bench or its jaw or both must break. The hyena
was up again in an instant, every hair on its body as erect as the hairs
on my head, but its hostility wasn’t quite so kinetic now. It withdrew.
I exulted. Orange Juice’s stirring defence brought a glow to my heart.
It didn’t last long. An adult female orang-utan cannot defeat an adult
male spotted hyena. That is the plain empirical truth. Let it become
known among zoologists. Had Orange Juice been a male, had she loomed as
large on the scales as she did in my heart, it might have been another
matter. But portly and overfed though she was from living in the comfort
of a zoo, even so she tipped the scales at barely 110 pounds. Female
orang-utans are half the size of males. But it is not simply a question
of weight and brute strength. Orange Juice was far from defenceless.
What it comes down to is attitude and knowledge. What does a fruit eater
know about killing? Where would it learn where to bite, how hard, for
how long? An orang-utan may be taller, may have very strong and agile
arms and long canines, but if it does not know how to use these as
weapons, they are of little use. The hyena, with only its jaws, will
overcome the ape because it knows what it wants and how to get it. The
hyena came back. It jumped on the bench and caught Orange Juice at the
wrist before she could strike. Orange Juice hit the hyena on the head
with her other arm, but the blow only made the beast snarl viciously.
She made to bite, but the hyena moved faster. Alas, Orange Juice’s
defence lacked precision and coherence. Her fear was something useless
that only hampered her. The hyena let go of her wrist and expertly got
to her throat. Dumb with pain and horror, I watched as Orange Juice
thumped the hyena ineffectually and pulled at its hair while her throat
was being squeezed by its jaws. To the end she reminded me of us: her
eyes expressed fear in such a humanlike way, as did her strained
whimpers. She made an attempt to climb onto the tarpaulin. The hyena
violently shook her. She fell off the bench to the bottom of the
lifeboat, the hyena with her. I heard noises but no longer saw anything.
I was next. That much was clear to me. With some difficulty I stood up.
I could hardly see through the tears in my eyes. I was no longer crying
because of my family or because of my impending death. I was far too
numb to consider either. I was crying because I was exceedingly tired
and it was time to get rest. I advanced over the tarpaulin. Though
tautly stretched at the end of the boat, it sagged a little in the
middle; it made for three or four toilsome, bouncy steps. And I had to
reach over the net and the rolled-up tarpaulin. And these efforts in a
lifeboat that was constantly rolling. In the condition I was in, it felt
like a great trek. When I laid my foot on the middle cross bench, its
hardness had an invigorating effect on me, as if I had just stepped on
solid ground. I planted both my feet on the bench and enjoyed my firm
stand. I was feeling dizzy, but since the capital moment of my life was
coming up this dizziness only added to my sense of frightened sublimity.
I raised my hands to the level of my chest-the weapons I had against the
hyena. It looked up at me. Its mouth was red. Orange Juice lay next to
it, against the dead zebra. Her arms were spread wide open and her short
legs were folded together and slightly turned to one side. She looked
like a simian Christ on the Cross. Except for her head. She was
beheaded. The neck wound was still bleeding. It was a sight horrible to
the eyes and killing to the spirit. Just before throwing myself upon the
hyena, to collect myself before the final struggle, I looked down.
Between my feet, under the bench, I beheld Richard Parker’s head. It was
gigantic. It looked the size of the planet Jupiter to my dazed senses.
His paws were like volumes of Encyclopaedia Britannica . I made my way
back to the bow and collapsed. I spent the night in a state of delirium.
I kept thinking I had slept and was awaking after dreaming of a
tiger.</p>
