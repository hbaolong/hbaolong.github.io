<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>First wonder goes deepest; wonder after that fits in the impression
made by the first. I owe to Hinduism the original landscape of my
religious imagination, those towns and rivers, battlefields and forests,
holy mountains and deep seas where gods, saints, villains and ordinary
people rub shoulders, and, in doing so, define who and why we are. I
first heard of the tremendous, cosmic might of loving kindness in this
Hindu land. It was Lord Krishna speaking. I heard him, and I followed
him. And in his wisdom and perfect love, Lord Krishna led me to meet one
man. I was fourteen years old-and a well-content Hindu on a holiday-when
I met Jesus Christ. It was not often that Father took time off from the
zoo, but one of the times he did we went to Munnar, just over in Kerala.
Munnar is a small hill station surrounded by some of the highest tea
estates in the world. It was early May and the monsoon hadn’t come yet.
The plains of Tamil Nadu were beastly hot. We made it to Munnar after a
winding, five-hour car ride from Madurai. The coolness was as pleasing
as having mint in your mouth. We did the tourist thing. We visited a
Tata tea factory. We enjoyed a boat ride on a lake. We toured a
cattle-breeding centre. We fed salt to some Nilgiri tahrs-a species of
wild goat-in a national park. (“We have some in our zoo. You should come
to Pondicherry,“ said Father to some Swiss tourists.) Ravi and I went
for walks in the tea estates near town. It was all an excuse to keep our
lethargy a little busy. By late afternoon Father and Mother were as
settled in the tea room of our comfortable hotel as two cats sunning
themselves at a window. Mother read while Father chatted with fellow
guests. There are three hills within Munnar. They don’t bear comparison
with the tall hills-mountains, you might call them-that surround the
town, but I noticed the first morning, as we were having breakfast, that
they did stand out in one way: on each stood a Godhouse. The hill on the
right, across the river from the hotel, had a Hindu temple high on its
side; the hill in the middle, further away, held up a mosque; while the
hill on the left was crowned with a Christian church. On our fourth day
in Munnar, as the afternoon was coming to an end, I stood on the hill on
the left. Despite attending a nominally Christian school, I had not yet
been inside a church-and I wasn’t about to dare the deed now. I knew
very little about the religion. It had a reputation for few gods and
great violence. But good schools. I walked around the church. It was a
building unremittingly unrevealing of what it held inside, with thick,
featureless walls pale blue in colour and high, narrow windows
impossible to look in through. A fortress. I came upon the rectory. The
door was open. I hid around a corner to look upon the scene. To the left
of the door was a small board with the words Parish Priest and Assistant
Priest on it. Next to each was a small sliding block. Both the priest
and his assistant were IN, the board informed me in gold letters, which
I could plainly see. One priest was working in his office, his back
turned to the bay windows, while the other was seated on a bench at a
round table in the large vestibule that evidently functioned as a room
for receiving visitors. He sat facing the door and the windows, a book
in his hands, a Bible I presumed. He read a little, looked up, read a
little more, looked up again. It was done in a way that was leisurely,
yet alert and composed. After some minutes, he closed the book and put
it aside. He folded his hands together on the table and sat there, his
expression serene, showing neither expectation nor resignation. The
vestibule had clean, white walls; the table and benches were of dark
wood; and the priest was dressed in a white cassock-it was all neat,
plain, simple. I was filled with a sense of peace. But more than the
setting, what arrested me was my intuitive understanding that he was
there-open, patient-in case someone, anyone, should want to talk to him;
a problem of the soul, a heaviness of the heart, a darkness of the
conscience, he would listen with love. He was a man whose profession it
was to love, and he would offer comfort and guidance to the best of his
ability. I was moved. What I had before my eyes stole into my heart and
thrilled me. He got up. I thought he might slide his block over, but he
didn’t. He retreated further into the rectory, that’s all, leaving the
door between the vestibule and the next room as open as the outside
door. I noted this, how both doors were wide open. Clearly, he and his
colleague were still available. I walked away and I dared. I entered the
church. My stomach was in knots. I was terrified I would meet a
Christian who would shout at me, “What are you doing here? How dare you
enter this sacred place, you defiler? Get out, right now!“</p>
<p>There was no one. And little to be understood. I advanced and
observed the inner sanctum. There was a painting. Was this the murti?
Something about a human sacrifice. An angry god who had to be appeased
with blood. Dazed women staring up in the air and fat babies with tiny
wings flying about. A charismatic bird. Which one was the god? To the
side of the sanctum was a painted wooden sculpture. The victim again,
bruised and bleeding in bold colours. I stared at his knees. They were
badly scraped. The pink skin was peeled back and looked like the petals
of a flower, revealing kneecaps that were fire-engine red. It was hard
to connect this torture scene with the priest in the rectory. The next
day, at around the same time, I let myself IN. Catholics have a
reputation for severity, for judgment that comes down heavily. My
experience with Father Martin was not at all like that. He was very
kind. He served me tea and biscuits in a tea set that tinkled and
rattled at every touch; he treated me like a grown-up; and he told me a
story. Or rather, since Christians are so fond of capital letters, a
Story. And what a story. The first thing that drew me in was disbelief.
What? Humanity sins but it’s God’s Son who pays the price? I tried to
imagine Father saying to me, “Piscine, a lion slipped into the llama pen
today and killed two llamas. Yesterday another one killed a black buck.
Last week two of them ate the camel. The week before it was painted
storks and grey herons. And who’s to say for sure who snacked on our
golden agouti? The situation has become intolerable. Something must be
done. I have decided that the only way the lions can atone for their
sins is if I feed you to them.“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father, that would be the right and logical thing to do. Give
me a moment to wash up.“ “Hallelujah, my son.“ “Hallelujah, Father.“</p>
<p>What a downright weird story. What peculiar psychology. I asked for
another story, one that I might find more satisfying. Surely this
religion had more than one story in its bag-religions abound with
stories. But Father Martin made me understand that the stories that came
before it-and there were many-were simply prologue to the Christians.
Their religion had one Story, and to it they came back again and again,
over and over. It was story enough for them. I was quiet that evening at
the hotel. That a god should put up with adversity, I could understand.
The gods of Hinduism face their fair share of thieves, bullies,
kidnappers and usurpers. What is the Ramayana but the account of one
long, bad day for Rama? Adversity, yes. Reversals of fortune, yes.
Treachery, yes. But humiliation ? Death ? I couldn’t imagine Lord
Krishna consenting to be stripped naked, whipped, mocked, dragged
through the streets and, to top it off, crucified-and at the hands of
mere humans, to boot. I’d never heard of a Hindu god dying. Brahman
Revealed did not go for death. Devils and monsters did, as did mortals,
by the thousands and millions-that’s what they were there for. Matter,
too, fell away. But divinity should not be blighted by death. It’s
wrong. The world soul cannot die, even in one contained part of it. It
was wrong of this Christian God to let His avatar die. That is
tantamount to letting a part of Himself die. For if the Son is to die,
it cannot be fake. If God on the Cross is God shamming a human tragedy,
it turns the Passion of Christ into the Farce of Christ. The death of
the Son must be real. Father Martin assured me that it was. But once a
dead God, always a dead God, even resurrected. The Son must have the
taste of death forever in His mouth. The Trinity must be tainted by it;
there must be a certain stench at the right hand of God the Father. The
horror must be real. Why would God wish that upon Himself? Why not leave
death to the mortals? Why make dirty what is beautiful, spoil what is
perfect? Love. That was Father Martin’s answer. And what about this
Son’s deportment? There is the story of baby Krishna, wrongly accused by
his friends of eating a bit of dirt. His foster mother, Yashoda, comes
up to him with a wagging finger. “You shouldn’t eat dirt, you naughty
boy,“ she scolds him. “But I haven’t,“ says the unchallenged lord of all
and everything, in sport disguised as a frightened human child. “Tut!
Tut! Open your mouth,“ orders Yashoda. Krishna does as he is told. He
opens his mouth. Yashoda gasps. She sees in Krishna’s mouth the whole
complete entire timeless universe, all the stars and planets of space
and the distance between them, all the lands and seas of the earth and
the life in them; she sees all the days of yesterday and all the days of
tomorrow; she sees all ideas and all emotions, all pity and all hope,
and the three strands of matter; not a pebble, candle, creature, village
or galaxy is missing, including herself and every bit of dirt in its
truthful place. “My Lord, you can close your mouth,“ she says
reverently. There is the story of Vishnu incarnated as Vamana the dwarf.
He asks of demon king Bali only as much land as he can cover in three
strides. Bali laughs at this runt of a suitor and his puny request. He
consents. Immediately Vishnu takes on his full cosmic size. With one
stride he covers the earth, with the second the heavens, and with the
third he boots Bali into the netherworld. Even Rama, that most human of
avatars, who had to be reminded of his divinity when he grew long-faced
over the struggle to get Sita, his wife, back from Ravana, evil king of
Lanka, was no slouch. No spindly cross would have kept him down. When
push came to shove, he transcended his limited human frame with strength
no man could have and weapons no man could handle. That is God as God
should be. With shine and power and might. Such as can rescue and save
and put down evil. This Son, on the other hand, who goes hungry, who
suffers from thirst, who gets tired, who is sad, who is anxious, who is
heckled and harassed, who has to put up with followers who don’t get it
and opponents who don’t respect Him-what kind of a god is that? It’s a
god on too human a scale, that’s what. There are miracles, yes, mostly
of a medical nature, a few to satisfy hungry stomachs; at best a storm
is tempered, water is briefly walked upon. If that is magic, it is minor
magic, on the order of card tricks. Any Hindu god can do a hundred times
better. This Son is a god who spent most of His time telling stories,
talking . This Son is a god who walked, a pedestrian god-and in a hot
place, at that-with a stride like any human stride, the sandal reaching
just above the rocks along the way; and when He splurged on
transportation, it was a regular donkey. This Son is a god who died in
three hours, with moans, gasps and laments. What kind of a god is that?
What is there to inspire in this Son? Love, said Father Martin. And this
Son appears only once, long ago, far away? Among an obscure tribe in a
backwater of West Asia on the confines of a long-vanished empire? Is
done away with before He has a single grey hair on His head? Leaves not
a single descendant, only scattered, partial testimony, His complete
works doodles in the dirt? Wait a minute. This is more than Brahman with
a serious case of stage fright. This is Brahman selfish. This is Brahman
ungenerous and unfair. This is Brahman practically unmanifest. If
Brahman is to have only one son, He must be as abundant as Krishna with
the milkmaids, no? What could justify such divine stinginess? Love,
repeated Father Martin. I’ll stick to my Krishna, thank you very much. I
find his divinity utterly compelling. You can keep your sweaty, chatty
Son to yourself. That was how I met that troublesome rabbi of long ago:
with disbelief and annoyance. I had tea with Father Martin three days in
a row. Each time, as teacup rattled against saucer, as spoon tinkled
against edge of cup, I asked questions. The answer was always the same.
He bothered me, this Son. Every day I burned with greater indignation
against Him, found more flaws to Him. He’s petulant ! It’s morning in
Bethany and God is hungry, God wants His breakfast. He comes to a fig
tree. It’s not the season for figs, so the tree has no figs. God is
peeved. The Son mutters, “May you never bear fruit again,“ and instantly
the fig tree withers. So says Matthew, backed up by Mark. I ask you, is
it the fig tree’s fault that it’s not the season for figs? What kind of
a thing is that to do to an innocent fig tree, wither it instantly? I
couldn’t get Him out of my head. Still can’t. I spent three solid days
thinking about Him. The more He bothered me, the less I could forget
Him. And the more I learned about Him, the less I wanted to leave Him.
On our last day, a few hours before we were to leave Munnar, I hurried
up the hill on the left. It strikes me now as a typically Christian
scene. Christianity is a religion in a rush. Look at the world created
in seven days. Even on a symbolic level, that’s creation in a frenzy. To
one born in a religion where the battle for a single soul can be a relay
race run over many centuries, with innumerable generations passing along
the baton, the quick resolution of Christianity has a dizzying effect.
If Hinduism flows placidly like the Ganges, then Christianity bustles
like Toronto at rush hour. It is a religion as swift as a swallow, as
urgent as an ambulance. It turns on a dime, expresses itself in the
instant. In a moment you are lost or saved. Christianity stretches back
through the ages, but in essence it exists only at one time: right now.
I booted up that hill. Though Father Martin was not IN-alas, his block
was slid over-thank God he was in. Short of breath I said, “Father, I
would like to be a Christian, please.“</p>
<p>He smiled. “You already are, Piscine-in your heart. Whoever meets
Christ in good faith is a Christian. Here in Munnar you met Christ.“</p>
<p>He patted me on the head. It was more of a thump, actually. His hand
went Boom Boom Boom on my head. I thought I would explode with joy.</p>
<p>“When you come back, we’ll have tea again, my son.“</p>
<p>“Yes, Father.“</p>
<p>It was a good smile he gave me. The smile of Christ. I entered the
church, without fear this time, for it was now my house too. I offered
prayers to Christ, who is alive. Then I raced down the hill on the left
and raced up the hill on the right-to offer thanks to Lord Krishna for
having put Jesus of Nazareth, whose humanity I found so compelling, in
my way.</p>
