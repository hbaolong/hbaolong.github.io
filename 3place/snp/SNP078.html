<h4 id="chapter-80">Chapter 80</h4>
<p>Of all the dorados, I remember one in particular, a special dorado.
It was early morning on a cloudy day, and we were in the midst of a
storm of flying fish. Richard Parker was actively swatting at them. I
was huddled behind a turtle shell, shielding myself from the flying
fish. I had a gaff with a piece of net hanging from it extended into the
open. I was hoping to catch fish in this way. I wasn’t having much luck.
A flying fish whizzed by. The dorado that was chasing it burst out of
the water. It was a bad calculation. The anxious flying fish got away,
just missing my net, but the dorado hit the gunnel like a cannonball.
The thud it made shook the whole boat. A spurt of blood sprayed the
tarpaulin. I reacted quickly. I dropped beneath the hail of flying fish
and reached for the dorado just ahead of a shark. I pulled it aboard. It
was dead, or nearly there, and turning all kinds of colours. What a
catch! What a catch! I thought excitedly. Thanks be to you,
Jesus-Matsya. The fish was fat and fleshy. It must have weighed a good
forty pounds. It would feed a horde. Its eyes and spine would irrigate a
desert. Alas, Richard Parker’s great head had turned my way. I sensed it
from the corner of my eyes. The flying fish were still coming, but he
was no longer interested in them; it was the fish in my hands that was
now the focus of his attention. He was eight feet away. His mouth was
half open, a fish wing dangling from it. His back became rounder. His
rump wriggled. His tail twitched. It was clear: he was in a crouch and
he was making to attack me. It was too late to get away, too late even
to blow my whistle. My time had come. But enough was enough. I had
suffered so much. I was so hungry. There are only so many days you can
go without eating. And so, in a moment of insanity brought on by
hunger-because I was more set on eating than I was on staying
alive-without any means of defence, naked in every sense of the term, I
looked Richard Parker dead in the eyes. Suddenly his brute strength
meant only moral weakness. It was nothing compared to the strength in my
mind. I stared into his eyes, wide-eyed and defiant, and we faced off.
Any zookeeper will tell you that a tiger, indeed any cat, will not
attack in the face of a direct stare but will wait until the deer or
antelope or wild ox has turned its eyes. But to know that and to apply
it are two very different things (and it’s a useless bit of knowledge if
you’re hoping to stare down a gregarious cat. While you hold one lion in
the thrall of your gaze, another will come up to you from behind). For
two, perhaps three seconds, a terrific battle of minds for status and
authority was waged between a boy and a tiger. He needed to make only
the shortest of lunges to be on top of me. But I held my stare. Richard
Parker licked his nose, groaned and turned away. He angrily batted a
flying fish. I had won. I gasped with disbelief, heaved the dorado into
my hands and hurried away to the raft. Shortly thereafter, I delivered
to Richard Parker a fair chunk of the fish. From that day onwards I felt
my mastery was no longer in question, and I began to spend progressively
more time on the lifeboat, first at the bow, then, as I gained
confidence, on the more comfortable tarpaulin. I was still scared of
Richard Parker, but only when it was necessary. His simple presence no
longer strained me. You can get used to anything-haven’t I already said
that? Isn’t that what all survivors say? Initially I lay on the
tarpaulin with my head against its rolled-up bow edge. It was raised a
little-since the ends of the lifeboat were higher than its middle-and so
I could keep an eye on Richard Parker. Later on I turned the other way,
with my head resting just above the middle bench, my back to Richard
Parker and his territory. In this position I was further away from the
edges of the boat and less exposed to wind and spray.</p>
