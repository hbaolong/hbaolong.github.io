<h4 id="chapter-23">Chapter 23</h4>
<p>Alas the sense of community that a common faith brings to a people
spelled trouble for me. In time, my religious doings went from the
notice of those to whom it didn’t matter and only amused, to that of
those to whom it did matter-and they were not amused.</p>
<p>“What is your son doing going to temple?“ asked the priest.</p>
<p>“Your son was seen in church crossing himself,“ said the imam.</p>
<p>“Your son has gone Muslim,“ said the pandit. Yes, it was all
forcefully brought to the attention of my bemused parents. You see, they
didn’t know. They didn’t know that I was a practising Hindu, Christian
and Muslim. Teenagers always hide a few things from their parents, isn’t
that so? All sixteen-year-olds have secrets, don’t they? But fate
decided that my parents and I and the three wise men, as I shall call
them, should meet one day on the Goubert Salai seaside esplanade and
that my secret should be outed. It was a lovely, breezy, hot Sunday
afternoon and the Bay of Bengal glittered under a blue sky. Townspeople
were out for a stroll. Children screamed and laughed. Coloured balloons
floated in the air. Ice cream sales were brisk. Why think of business on
such a day, I ask? Why couldn’t they have just walked by with a nod and
a smile? It was not to be. We were to meet not just one wise man but all
three, and not one after another but at the same time, and each would
decide upon seeing us that right then was the golden occasion to meet
that Pondicherry notable, the zoo director, he of the model devout son.
When I saw the first, I smiled; by the time I had laid eyes on the
third, my smile had frozen into a mask of horror. When it was clear that
all three were converging on us, my heart jumped before sinking very
low. The wise men seemed annoyed when they realized that all three of
them were approaching the same people. Each must have assumed that the
others were there for some business other than pastoral and had rudely
chosen that moment to deal with it Glances of displeasure were
exchanged. My parents looked puzzled to have their way gently blocked by
three broadly smiling religious strangers. I should explain that my
family was anything but orthodox. Father saw himself as part of the New
India-rich, modern and as secular as ice cream. He didn’t have a
religious bone in his body. He was a businessman, pronounced busynessman
in his case, a hardworking, earthbound professional, more concerned with
inbreeding among the lions than any overarching moral or existential
scheme. It’s true that he had all new animals blessed by a priest and
there were two small shrines at the zoo, one to Lord Ganesha and one to
Hanuman, gods likely to please a zoo director, what with the first
having the head of an elephant and the second being a monkey, but
Father’s calculation was that this was good for business, not good for
his soul, a matter of public relations rather than personal salvation.
Spiritual worry was alien to him; it was financial worry that rocked his
being. “One epidemic in the collection,“ he used to say, “and we’ll end
up in a road crew breaking up stones.“ Mother was mum, bored and neutral
on the subject. A Hindu upbringing and a Baptist education had precisely
cancelled each other out as far as religion was concerned and had left
her serenely impious. I suspect she suspected that I had a different
take on the matter, but she never said anything when as a child I
devoured the comic books of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata and an
illustrated children’s Bible and other stories of the gods. She herself
was a big reader. She was pleased to see me with my nose buried in a
book, any book, so long as it wasn’t naughty. As for Ravi, if Lord
Krishna had held a cricket bat rather than a flute, if Christ had
appeared more plainly to him as an umpire, if the prophet Muhammad,
peace be upon him, had shown some notions of bowling, he might have
lifted a religious eyelid, but they didn’t, and so he slumbered. After
the “Hellos“ and the “Good days,“ there was an awkward silence. The
priest broke it when he said, with pride in his voice, “Piscine is a
good Christian boy. I hope to see him join our choir soon.“</p>
<p>My parents, the pandit and the imam looked surprised.</p>
<p>“You must be mistaken. He’s a good Muslim boy. He comes without fail
to Friday prayer, and his knowledge of the Holy Qur’an is coming along
nicely.“ So said the imam. My parents, the priest and the pandit looked
incredulous. The pandit spoke. “You’re both wrong. He’s a good Hindu
boy. l see him all the time at the temple coming for darshan and
performing puja.“</p>
<p>My parents, the imam and the priest looked astounded.</p>
<p>“There is no mistake,“ said the priest. “I know this boy. He is
Piscine Molitor Patel and he’s a Christian.“</p>
<p>“I know him too, and I tell you he’s a Muslim,“ asserted the
imam.</p>
<p>“Nonsense!“ cried the pandit. “Piscine was born a Hindu, lives a
Hindu and will die a Hindu!“ The three wise men stared at each other,
breathless and disbelieving. Lord, avert their eyes from me, I whispered
in my soul. All eyes fell upon me.</p>
<p>“Piscine, can this be true?“ asked the imam earnestly. “Hindus and
Christians are idolaters. They have many gods.“</p>
<p>“And Muslims have many wives,“ responded the pandit. The priest
looked askance at both of them. “Piscine,“ he nearly whispered, “there
is salvation only in Jesus.“</p>
<p>“Balderdash! Christians know nothing about religion,“ said the
pandit. “They strayed long ago from God’s path,“ said the imam.</p>
<p>“Where’s God in your religion?“ snapped the priest. “You don’t have a
single miracle to show for it. What kind of religion is that, without
miracles?“</p>
<p>“It isn’t a circus with dead people jumping out of tombs all the
time, that’s what! We Muslims stick to the essential miracle of
existence. Birds flying, rain falling, crops growing-these are miracles
enough for us.“</p>
<p>“Feathers and rain are all very nice, but we like to know that God is
truly with us.“</p>
<p>“Is that so? Well, a whole lot of good it did God to be with you-you
tried to kill him! You banged him to a cross with great big nails. Is
that a civilized way to treat a prophet? The prophet Muhammad-peace be
upon him-brought us the word of God without any undignified nonsense and
died at a ripe old age.“</p>
<p>“The word of God? To that illiterate merchant of yours in the middle
of the desert? Those were drooling epileptic fits brought on by the
swaying of his camel, not divine revelation. That, or the sun frying his
brains!“</p>
<p>“If the Prophet-p.b.u.h.-were alive, he would have choice words for
you,“ replied the imam, with narrowed eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, he’s not! Christ is alive, while your old ‘p.b.u.h.’ is dead,
dead, dead!“</p>
<p>The pandit interrupted them quietly. In Tamil he said, “The real
question is, why is Piscine dallying with these foreign religions?“</p>
<p>The eyes of the priest and the imam properly popped out of their
heads. They were both native Tamils.</p>
<p>“God is universal,“ spluttered the priest. The imam nodded strong
approval. “There is only one God.“</p>
<p>“And with their one god Muslims are always causing troubles and
provoking riots. The proof of how bad Islam is, is how uncivilized
Muslims are,“ pronounced the pandit.</p>
<p>“Says the slave-driver of the caste system,“ huffed the imam. “Hindus
enslave people and worship dressed-up dolls.“</p>
<p>“They are golden calf lovers. They kneel before cows,“ the priest
chimed in.</p>
<p>“While Christians kneel before a white man! They are the flunkies of
a foreign god. They are the nightmare of all non-white people.“</p>
<p>“And they eat pigs and are cannibals,“ added the imam for good
measure.</p>
<p>“What it comes down to,“ the priest put out with cool rage, “is
whether Piscine wants real religion-or myths from a cartoon strip.“</p>
<p>“God-or idols,“ intoned the imam gravely.</p>
<p>“Our gods-or colonial gods,“ hissed the pandit. It was hard to tell
whose face was more inflamed. It looked as if might come to blows.
Father raised his hands. “Gentlemen, gentlemen, please!“ he interjected.
“I would like to remind you there is freedom of practice in this
country.“ Three apoplectic faces turned to him.</p>
<p>“Yes! Practice -singular!“ the wise men screamed in unison. Three
index fingers, like punctuation marks, jumped to attention in the air to
emphasize their point. They were not pleased at the unintended choral
effect or the spontaneous unity of their gestures. Their fingers came
down quickly, and they sighed and groaned each on his own. Father and
Mother stared on, at a loss for words. The pandit spoke first.
“Mr. Patel, Piscine’s piety is admirable. In these troubled times it’s
good to see a boy so keen on God. We all agree on that.“ The imam and
the priest nodded. “But he can’t be a Hindu, a Christian and a Muslim.
It’s impossible. He must choose.“</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a crime, but I suppose you’re right,“ Father
replied. The three murmured agreement and looked heavenward, as did
Father, whence they felt the decision must come. Mother looked at me. A
silence fell heavily on my shoulders.</p>
<p>“Hmmm, Piscine?“ Mother nudged me. “How do you feel about the
question?“ “Bapu Gandhi said, ‘All religions are true.’ I just want to
love God,“ I blurted out, and looked down, red in the face. My
embarrassment was contagious. No one said anything. It happened that we
were not far from the statue of Gandhi on the esplanade. Stick in hand,
an impish smile on his lips, a twinkle in his eyes, the Mahatma walked.
I fancy that he heard our conversation, but that he paid even greater
attention to my heart. Father cleared his throat and said in a
half-voice, “I suppose that’s what we’re all trying to do-love God.“</p>
<p>I thought it very funny that he should say that, he who hadn’t
stepped into a temple with a serious intent since I had had the faculty
of memory. But it seemed to do the trick. You can’t reprimand a boy for
wanting to love God. The three wise men pulled away with stiff, grudging
smiles on their faces. Father looked at me for a second, as if to speak,
then thought better, said, “Ice cream, anyone?“ and headed for the
closest ice cream wallah before we could answer. Mother gazed at me a
little longer, with an expression that was both tender and perplexed.
That was my introduction to interfaith dialogue. Father bought three ice
cream sandwiches. We ate them in unusual silence as we continued on our
Sunday walk.</p>
