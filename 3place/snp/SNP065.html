<h4 id="chapter-66">Chapter 66</h4>
<p>I fished with a variety of hooks at a variety of depths for a variety
of fish, from deep-sea fishing with large hooks and many sinkers to
surface fishing with smaller hooks and only one or two sinkers. Success
was slow to come, and when it did, it was much appreciated, but the
effort seemed out of proportion to the reward. The hours were long, the
fish were small, and Richard Parker was forever hungry. It was the gaffs
that finally proved to be my most valuable fishing equipment. They came
in three screw-in pieces: two tubular sections that formed the shaft-one
with a moulded plastic handle at its end and a ring for securing the
gaff with a rope-and a head that consisted of a hook measuring about two
inches across its curve and ending in a needle-sharp, barbed point.
Assembled, each gaff was about five feet long and felt as light and
sturdy as a sword. At first I fished in open water. I would sink the
gaff to a depth of four feet or so, sometimes with a fish speared on the
hook as bait, and I would wait. I would wait for hours, my body tense
till it ached. When a fish was in just the right spot, I jerked the gaff
up with all the might and speed I could muster. It was a split-second
decision. Experience taught me that it was better to strike when I felt
I had a good chance of success than to strike wildly, for a fish learns
from experience too, and rarely falls for the same trap twice. When I
was lucky, a fish was properly snagged on the hook, impaled, and I could
confidently bring it aboard. But if I gaffed a large fish in the stomach
or tail, it would often get away with a twist and a forward spurt of
speed. Injured, it would be easy prey for another predator, a gift I had
not meant to make. So with large fish I aimed for the ventral area
beneath their gills and their lateral fins, for a fish’s instinctive
reaction when struck there was to swim up , away from the hook, in the
very direction I was pulling. Thus it would happen-sometimes more
pricked than actually gaffed, a fish would burst out of the water in my
face. I quickly lost my revulsion at touching sea life. None of this
prissy fish blanket business any more. A fish jumping out of water was
confronted by a famished boy with a hands-on no-holds-barred approach to
capturing it. If I felt the gaff’s hold was uncertain, I would let go of
it-I had not forgotten to secure it with a rope to the raft-and I would
clutch at the fish with my hands. Fingers, though blunt, were far more
nimble than a hook. The struggle would be fast and furious. Those fish
were slippery and desperate, and I was just plain desperate. If only I
had had as many arms as the goddess Durga-two to hold the gaffs, four to
grasp the fish and two to wield the hatchets. But I had to make do with
two. I stuck fingers into eyes, jammed hands into gills, crushed soft
stomachs with knees bit tails with my teeth-I did whatever was necessary
to hold a fish down until I could reach for the hatchet and chop its
head off. With time and experience I became a better hunter. I grew
bolder and more agile. I developed an instinct, a feel, for what to do.
My success improved greatly when I started using part of the cargo net.
As a fishing net it was useless-too stiff and heavy and with a weave
that wasn’t tight enough. But it was perfect as a lure. Trailing freely
in the water, it proved irresistibly attractive to fish and even more so
when seaweed started growing on it. Fish that were local in their ambit
made the net their neighbourhood, and the quick ones, the ones that
tended to streak by, the dorados, slowed down to visit the new
development. Neither the residents nor the travellers ever suspected
that a hook was hidden in the weave. There were some days-too few
unfortunately-when I could have all the fish I cared to gaff. At such
times I hunted far beyond the needs of my hunger or my capacity to cure;
there simply wasn’t enough space on the lifeboat, or lines on the raft,
to dry so many strips of dorado, flying fish, jacks, groupers and
mackerels, let alone space in my stomach to eat them. I kept what I
could and gave the rest to Richard Parker. During those days of plenty,
I laid hands on so many fish that my body began to glitter from all the
fish scales that became stuck to it. I wore these spots of shine and
silver like tilaks, the marks of colour that we Hindus wear on our
foreheads as symbols of the divine. If sailors had come upon me then,
I’m sure they would have thought I was a fish god standing atop his
kingdom and they wouldn’t have stopped. Those were the good days. They
were rare. Turtles were an easy catch indeed, as the survival manual
said they were. Under the “hunting and gathering“ heading, they would go
under “gathering.“ Solid in build though they were, like tanks, they
were neither fast nor powerful swimmers; with just one hand gripped
around a back flipper, it was possible to hold on to a turtle. But the
survival manual failed to mention that a turtle caught was not a turtle
had. It still needed to be brought aboard. And hauling a struggling
130-pound turtle aboard a lifeboat was anything but easy. It was a
labour that demanded feats of strength worthy of Hanuman. I did it by
bringing the victim alongside the bow of the boat, carapace against
hull, and tying a rope to its neck, a front flipper and a back flipper.
Then I pulled until I thought my arms would come apart and my head would
explode. I ran the ropes around the tarpaulin hooks on the opposite side
of the bow; every time a rope yielded a little, I secured my gain before
the rope slipped back. Inch by inch, a turtle was heaved out of the
water. It took time. I remember one green sea turtle that hung from the
side of the lifeboat for two days, the whole while thrashing about
madly, free flippers beating in the air. Luckily, at the last stage, on
the lip of the gunnel, it would often happen that a turtle would help me
without meaning to. In an attempt to free its painfully twisted
flippers, it would pull on them; if I pulled at the same moment, our
conflicting efforts sometimes came together and suddenly it would
happen, easily: in the most dramatic fashion imaginable, a turtle would
surge over the gunnel and slide onto the tarpaulin. I would fall back,
exhausted but jubilant. Green sea turtles gave more meat than
hawksbills, and their belly shells were thinner. But they tended to be
bigger than hawksbills, often too big to lift out of the water for the
weakened castaway that I became. Lord, to think that I’m a strict
vegetarian. To think that when I was a child I always shuddered when I
snapped open a banana because it sounded to me like the breaking of an
animal’s neck. I descended to a level of savagery I never imagined
possible.</p>
