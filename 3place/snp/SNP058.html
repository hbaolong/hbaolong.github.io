<h4 id="chapter-58">Chapter 58</h4>
<p>I pulled out the survival manual. Its pages were still wet. I turned
them carefully. The manual was written by a British Royal Navy
commander. It contained a wealth of practical information on surviving
at sea after a shipwreck. It included survival tips such as:</p>
<p>Always read instructions carefully. Do not drink urine. Or sea water.
Or bird blood. Do not eat jellyfish. Or fish that are armed with spikes.
Or that have parrot-like beaks. Or that puff up like balloons.</p>
<p>• Pressing the eyes of fish will paralyze them.</p>
<p>• The body can be a hero in battle. If a castaway is injured, beware
of well-meaning but ill-founded medical treatment. Ignorance is the
worst doctor, while rest and sleep are the best nurses. Put up your feet
at least five minutes every hour. Unnecessary exertion should be
avoided. But an idle mind tends to sink, so the mind should be kept
occupied with whatever light distraction may suggest itself. Playing
card games, Twenty Questions and I Spy With My Little Eye are excellent
forms of simple recreation. Community singing is another sure-fire way
to lift the spirits. Yarn spinning is also highly recommended. Green
water is shallower than blue water. Beware of far-off clouds that look
like mountains. Look for green. Ultimately, a foot is the only good
judge of land. Do not go swimming. It wastes energy. Besides, a survival
craft may drift faster than you can swim. Not to mention the danger of
sea life. If you are hot, wet your clothes instead. Do not urinate in
your clothes. The momentary warmth is not worth the nappy rash.</p>
<p>Shelter yourself. Exposure can kill faster than thirst or hunger. So
long as no excessive water is lost through perspiration, the body can
survive up to fourteen days without water. If you feel thirsty, suck a
button. Turtles are an easy catch and make for excellent meals. Their
blood is a good, nutritious, salt-free drink; their flesh is tasty and
filling; their fat has many uses; and the castaway will find turtle eggs
a real treat. Mind the beak and the claws. Don’t let your morale flag.
Be daunted, but not defeated. Remember: the spirit, above all else,
counts. If you have the will to live, you will. Good luck!</p>
<p>There were also a few highly cryptic lines distilling the art and
science of navigation. I learned that the horizon, as seen from a height
of five feet on a calm day, was two and a half miles away. The
injunction not to drink urine was quite unnecessary. No one called
“Pissing“ in his childhood would be caught dead with a cup of pee at his
lips, even alone in a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific. And the
gastronomic suggestions only confirmed to my mind that the English
didn’t know the meaning of the word food . Otherwise, the manual was a
fascinating pamphlet on how to avoid being pickled in brine. Only one
important topic was not addressed: the establishing of alpha-omega
relationships with major lifeboat pests. I had to devise a training
program for Richard Parker. I had to make him understand that I was the
top tiger and that his territory was limited to the floor of the boat,
the stern bench and the side benches as far as the middle cross bench. I
had to fix in his mind that the top of the tarpaulin and the bow of the
boat, bordered by the neutral territory of the middle bench, was my
territory and utterly forbidden to him. I had to start fishing very
soon. It would not take long for Richard Parker to finish the animal
carcasses. At the zoo the adult lions and tigers ate on average ten
pounds of meat a day. There were many other things I had to do. I had to
find a means of sheltering myself. If Richard Parker stayed under the
tarpaulin all the time, it was for a good reason. To be continuously
outside, exposed to sun, wind, rain and sea, was exhausting, and not
only to the body but also to the mind. Hadn’t I just read that exposure
could inflict a quick death? I had to devise some sort of canopy. I had
to tie the raft to the lifeboat with a second rope, in case the first
should break or become loose.</p>
<p>I had to improve the raft. At present it was seaworthy, but hardly
habitable. I would have to make it fit for living in until I could move
to my permanent quarters on the lifeboat. For example, I had to find a
way to stay dry on it. My skin was wrinkled and swollen all over from
being constantly wet. That had to change. And I had to find a way to
store things on the raft. I had to stop hoping so much that a ship would
rescue me. I should not count on outside help. Survival had to start
with me. In my experience, a castaway’s worst mistake is to hope too
much and do too little. Survival starts by paying attention to what is
close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to
dreaming one’s life away. There was much I had to do. I looked out at
the empty horizon. There was so much water. And I was all alone. All
alone. I burst into hot tears. I buried my face in my crossed arms and
sobbed. My situation was patently hopeless.</p>
