<h4 id="chapter-72">Chapter 72</h4>
<p>In my case, to protect myself from Richard Parker while I trained
him, I made a shield with a turtle shell. I cut a notch on each side of
the shell and connected them with a length of rope. The shield was
heavier than I would have liked, but do soldiers ever get to choose
their ordnance? The first time I tried, Richard Parker bared his teeth,
rotated his ears full round, vomited a short guttural roar and charged.
A great, full-clawed paw rose in the air and cuffed my shield. The blow
sent me flying off the boat. I hit the water and instantly let go of the
shield. It sank without a trace after hitting me in the shin. I was
beside myself with terror-of Richard Parker, but also of being in the
water. In my mind a shark was at that very second shooting up for me. I
swam for the raft in frantic strokes, precisely the sort of wild
thrashing that sharks find so deliciously inviting. Luckily there were
no sharks. I reached the raft, let out all the rope and sat with my arms
wrapped around my knees and my head down, trying to put out the fire of
fear that was blazing within me. It was a long time before the trembling
of my body stopped completely. I stayed on the raft for the rest of that
day and the whole night. I did not eat or drink. I was at it again next
time I caught a turtle. Its shell was smaller, lighter, and made for a
better shield. Once more I advanced and started stamping on the middle
bench with my foot. I wonder if those who hear this story will
understand that my behaviour was not an act of insanity or a covert
suicide attempt but a simple necessity. Either I tamed him, made him see
who was Number One and who was Number Two-or I died the day I wanted to
climb aboard the lifeboat during rough weather and he objected. If I
survived my apprenticeship as a high seas animal trainer it was because
Richard Parker did not really want to attack me. Tigers, indeed all
animals, do not favour violence as a means of settling scores. When
animals fight, it is with the intent to kill and with the understanding
that they may be killed. A clash is costly. And so animals have a full
system of cautionary signals designed to avoid a showdown, and they are
quick to back down when they feel they can. Rarely will a tiger attack a
fellow predator without warning. Typically a head-on rush for the
adversary will be made, with much snarling and growling. But just before
it is too late, the tiger will freeze, the menace rumbling deep in its
throat. It will appraise the situation. If it decides that there is no
threat, it will turn away, feeling that its point has been made. Richard
Parker made his point with me four times. Four times he struck at me
with his right paw and sent me overboard, and four times I lost my
shield. I was terrified before, during and after each attack, and I
spent a long time shivering with fear on the raft. Eventually I learned
to read the signals he was sending me. I found that with his ears, his
eyes, his whiskers, his teeth, his tail and his throat, he spoke a
simple, forcefully punctuated language that told me what his next move
might be. I learned to back down before he lifted his paw in the air.
Then I made my point, feet on the gunnel, boat rolling, my single-note
language blasting from the whistle, and Richard Parker moaning and
gasping at the bottom of the boat. My fifth shield lasted me the rest of
his training.</p>
