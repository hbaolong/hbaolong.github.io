<h4 id="chapter-99">Chapter 99</h4>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Mr. Patel, we don’t believe your story.“</p>
<p>“Sorry-these cookies are good but they tend to crumble. I’m amazed.
Why not?“ “It doesn’t hold up.“ “What do you mean?“ “Bananas don’t
float.“ “I’m sorry?“</p>
<p>“You said the orang-utan came floating on an island of bananas.“
“That’s right.“ “Bananas don’t float.“ “Yes, they do.“ “They’re too
heavy.“</p>
<p>“No, they’re not. Here, try for yourself. I have two bananas right
here.“ Mr. Chiba: [translation] “Where did those come from? What else
does he have under his bedsheet?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Damn it. [/translation] No, that’s all right.“ “There’s
a sink over there.“ “That’s fine.“</p>
<p>“I insist. Fill that sink with water, drop these bananas in, and
we’ll see who’s right.“ “We’d like to move on.“ “I absolutely insist.“
[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “What do we do?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “I feel this is going to be another very long day.“
[/translation] [Sound of a chair being pushed back. Distant sound of
water gushing out of a tap]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “What’s happening? I can’t see from here.“ Mr. Okamoto
[Distantly] : “I’m filling the sink.“ “Have you put the bananas in
yet?“</p>
<p>[Distantly] “No.“</p>
<p>“And now?“</p>
<p>[Distantly] “They’re in.“</p>
<p>“And?“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “Are they floating?“ [Distantly] “They’re
floating.“ [/translation]</p>
<p>“So, are they floating?“ [Distantly] “They’re floating.“</p>
<p>“What did I tell you?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Yes, yes. But it would take a lot of bananas to hold up
an orang-utan.“ “It did. There was close to a ton. It still makes me
sick when I think of all those bananas floating away and going to waste
when they were mine for the picking.“ “It’s a pity. Now, about-“ “Could
I have my bananas back, please?“ Mr. Chiba: [translation] “I’ll get
them.“ [Sound of a chair being pushed back] [Distantly] “Look at that.
They really do float.“ [/translation] Mr. Okamoto: “What about this
algae island you say you came upon?“ Mr. Chiba: “Here are your bananas.“
Pi Patel: “Thank you. Yes?“</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to say it so bluntly, we don’t mean to hurt your feelings,
but you don’t really expect us to believe you, do you? Carnivorous
trees? A fish-eating algae that produces fresh water? Tree-dwelling
aquatic rodents? These things don’t exist.“</p>
<p>“Only because you’ve never seen them.“</p>
<p>“That’s right. We believe what we see.“</p>
<p>“So did Columbus. What do you do when you’re in the dark?“</p>
<p>“Your island is botanically impossible.“</p>
<p>“Said the fly just before landing in the Venus flytrap.“</p>
<p>“Why has no one else come upon it?“</p>
<p>“It’s a big ocean crossed by busy ships. I went slowly, observing
much.“ “No scientist would believe you.“</p>
<p>“These would be the same who dismissed Copernicus and Darwin. Have
scientists finished coming upon new plants? In the Amazon basin, for
example?“ “Not plants that contradict the laws of nature.“ “Which you
know through and through?“ “Well enough to know the possible from the
impossible.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “I have an uncle who knows a lot about botany. He lives in
the country near Hita-Gun. He’s a bonsai master.“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “A what?“</p>
<p>“A bonsai master. You know, bonsai are little trees.“ “You mean
shrubs.“</p>
<p>“No, I mean trees. Bonsai are little trees. They are less than two
feet tall. You can carry them in your arms. They can be very old. My
uncle has one that is over three hundred years old.“
“Three-hundred-year-old trees that are two feet tall that you can carry
in your arms?“ “Yes. They’re very delicate. They need a lot of
attention.“ “Whoever heard of such trees? They’re botanically
impossible.“ “But I assure you they exist, Mr. Patel. My uncle-“ “I
believe what I see.“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Just a moment, please. [translation] Atsuro, with all
due respect for your uncle who lives in the country near Hita-Gun, we’re
not here to talk idly about botany.“ “I’m just trying to help.“ “Do your
uncle’s bonsai eat meat?“</p>
<p>“I don’t think so.“</p>
<p>“Have you ever been bitten by one of his bonsai?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“In that case, your uncle’s bonsai are not helping us.[/translation]
Where were we?“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “With the tall, full-sized trees firmly rooted to the
ground I was telling you about.“</p>
<p>“Let us put them aside for now.“</p>
<p>“It might be hard. I never tried pulling them out and carrying them.“
“You’re a funny man, Mr. Patel. Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Ha! Ha! Ha! [translation] It wasn’t that funny.“
Mr. Okamoto: “Just keep laughing. [/translation] Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Now about the tiger, we’re not sure about it
either.“</p>
<p>“What do you mean?“</p>
<p>“We have difficulty believing it.“</p>
<p>“It’s an incredible story.“</p>
<p>“Precisely.“</p>
<p>“I don’t know how I survived.“ “Clearly it was a strain.“ “I’ll have
another cookie.“ “There are none left.“</p>
<p>“What’s in that bag?“</p>
<p>“Nothing.“</p>
<p>“Can I see?“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “There goes our lunch.“ [/translation]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Getting back to the tiger…“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Terrible business. Delicious sandwiches.“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Yes, they look good.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “I’m hungry.“ [/translation]</p>
<p>“Not a trace of it has been found. That’s a bit hard to believe,
isn’t it? There are no tigers in the Americas. If there were a wild
tiger out there, don’t you think the police would have heard about it by
now?“</p>
<p>“I should tell you about the black panther that escaped from the
Zurich Zoo in the middle of winter.“</p>
<p>“Mr. Patel, a tiger is an incredibly dangerous wild animal. How could
you survive in a lifeboat with one? It’s-“</p>
<p>“What you don’t realize is that we are a strange and forbidding
species to wild animals. We fill them with fear. They avoid us as much
as possible. It took centuries to still the fear in some pliable
animals-domestication it’s called-but most cannot get over their fear,
and I doubt they ever will. When wild animals fight us, it is out of
sheer desperation. They fight when they feel they have no other way out.
It’s a very last resort.“</p>
<p>“In a lifeboat ? Come on, Mr. Patel, it’s just too hard to
believe!“</p>
<p>“Hard to believe? What do you know about hard to believe? You want
hard to believe? I’ll give you hard to believe. It’s a closely held
secret among Indian zookeepers that in 1971 Bara the polar bear escaped
from the Calcutta Zoo. She was never heard from again, not by police or
hunters or poachers or anyone else. We suspect she’s living freely on
the banks of the Hugli River. Beware if you go to Calcutta, my good
sirs: if you have sushi on the breath you may pay a high price! If you
took the city of Tokyo and turned it upside down and shook it, you’d be
amazed at all the animals that would fall out: badgers, wolves, boa
constrictors, Komodo dragons, crocodiles, ostriches, baboons, capybaras,
wild boars, leopards, manatees, ruminants in untold numbers. There is no
doubt in my mind that feral giraffes and feral hippos have been living
in Tokyo for generations without being seen by a soul. You should
compare one day the things that stick to the soles of your shoes as you
walk down the street with what you see lying at the bottom of the cages
in the Tokyo Zoo-then look up! And you expect to find a tiger in a
Mexican jungle! It’s laughable, just plain laughable. Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>“There may very well be feral giraffes and feral hippos living in
Tokyo and a polar bear living freely in Calcutta. We just don’t believe
there was a tiger living in your lifeboat.“</p>
<p>“The arrogance of big-city folk! You grant your metropolises all the
animals of Eden, but you deny my hamlet the merest Bengal tiger!“</p>
<p>“Mr. Patel, please calm down.“</p>
<p>“If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for? Isn’t
love hard to believe?“ “Mr. Patel-“</p>
<p>“Don’t you bully me with your politeness! Love is hard to believe,
ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard
to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to
believe?“</p>
<p>“We’re just being reasonable.“</p>
<p>“So am I! I applied my reason at every moment. Reason is excellent
for getting food, clothing and shelter. Reason is the very best tool
kit. Nothing beats reason for keeping tigers away. But be excessively
reasonable and you risk throwing out the universe with the
bathwater.“</p>
<p>“Calm down, Mr. Patel, calm down.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “The bathwater? Why is he talking about
bathwater?“ [/translation]</p>
<p>“How can I be calm? You should have seen Richard Parker!“ “Yes,
yes.“</p>
<p>“Huge. Teeth like this! Claws like scimitars!“ Mr. Chiba:
[translation] “What are scimitars?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Chiba-san,, instead of asking stupid vocabulary
questions, why don’t you make yourself useful? This boy is a tough nut
to crack. Do something!“ [/translation] Mr. Chiba: “Look! A chocolate
bar!“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Wonderful!“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: [translation] “Like he hasn’t already stolen our whole
lunch. Soon he’ll be demanding tempura.“ [/translation] [Long
silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “We are losing sight of the point of this investigation.
We are here because of the sinking of a cargo ship. You are the sole
survivor. And you were only a passenger. You bear no responsibility for
what happened. We-“</p>
<p>“Chocolate is so good!“</p>
<p>“We are not seeking to lay criminal charges. You are an innocent
victim of a tragedy at sea. We are only trying to determine why and how
the Tsimtsum sank. We thought you might help us, Mr. Patel.“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>“Mr. Patel?“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Tigers exist, lifeboats exist, oceans exist. Because the
three have never come together in your narrow, limited experience, you
refuse to believe that they might. Yet the plain fact is that the
Tsimtsum brought them together and then sank.“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “What about this Frenchman?“ “What about him?“</p>
<p>“Two blind people in two separate lifeboats meeting up in the
Pacific-the coincidence seems a little far-fetched, no?“ “It certainly
does.“ “We find it very unlikely.“</p>
<p>“So is winning the lottery, yet someone always wins.“</p>
<p>“We find it extremely hard to believe.“</p>
<p>“So did I.“</p>
<p>[translation] “I knew we should have taken the day off.
[/translation] You talked about food?“</p>
<p>“We did.“</p>
<p>“He knew a lot about food.“ “If you can call it food.“</p>
<p>“The cook on the Tsimtsum was a Frenchman.“ “There are Frenchmen all
over the world.“ “Maybe the Frenchman you met was the cook.“</p>
<p>“Maybe. How should I know? I never saw him. I was blind. Then Richard
Parker ate him alive.“</p>
<p>“How convenient.“</p>
<p>“Not at all. It was horrific and it stank. By the way, how do you
explain the meerkat bones in the lifeboat?“</p>
<p>“Yes, the bones of a small animal were-“ “More than one!“</p>
<p>“-of some small animals were found in the lifeboat. They must have
come from the ship.“</p>
<p>“We had no meerkats at the zoo.“</p>
<p>“We have no proof they were meerkat bones.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Maybe they were banana bones! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!“</p>
<p>[translation] “Atsuro, shut up!“</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry, Okamoto-san. It’s the fatigue.“</p>
<p>“You’re bringing our service into disrepute!“</p>
<p>“Very sorry, Okamoto-san.“ [/translation]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “They could be bones from another small animal.“</p>
<p>“They were meerkats.“</p>
<p>“They could be mongooses.“</p>
<p>“The mongooses at the zoo didn’t sell. They stayed in India.“</p>
<p>“They could be shipboard pests, like rats. Mongooses are common in
India.“</p>
<p>“Mongooses as shipboard pests?“</p>
<p>“Why not?“</p>
<p>“Who swam in the stormy Pacific, several of them, to the lifeboat?
That’s a little hard to believe, wouldn’t you say?“</p>
<p>“Less hard to believe than some of the things we’ve heard in the last
two hours. Perhaps the mongooses were already aboard the lifeboat, like
the rat you mentioned.“</p>
<p>“Simply amazing the number of animals in that lifeboat.“</p>
<p>“Simply amazing.“</p>
<p>“A real jungle.“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Those bones are meerkat bones. Have them checked by an expert.“
“There weren’t that many left. And there were no heads.“ “I used them as
bait.“</p>
<p>“It’s doubtful an expert could tell whether they were meerkat bones
or mongoose bones.“ “Find yourself a forensic zoologist.“</p>
<p>“All right, Mr. Patel! You win. We cannot explain the presence of
meerkat bones, if that is what they are, in the lifeboat. But that is
not our concern here. We are here because a Japanese cargo ship owned by
Oika Shipping Company, flying the Panamanian flag, sank in the
Pacific.“</p>
<p>“Something I never forget, not for a minute. I lost my whole
family.“</p>
<p>“We’re sorry about that.“</p>
<p>“Not as much as I am.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “What do we do now?“ Mr. Okamoto: “I don’t
know.“ [/translation] [Long silence]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Would you like a cookie?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Yes, that would be nice. Thank you.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Thank you.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “It’s a nice day.“ Pi Patel: “Yes. Sunny.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Is this your first visit to Mexico?“ Mr. Okamoto: “Yes, it
is.“ “Mine too.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “So, you didn’t like my story?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “No, we liked it very much. Didn’t we, Atsuro? We will
remember it for a long, long time.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “We will.“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “But for the purposes of our investigation, we would
like to know what really happened.“</p>
<p>“What really happened?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“So you want another story?“</p>
<p>“Uhh.. .no. We would like to know what really happened.“ “Doesn’t the
telling of something always become a story?“</p>
<p>“Uhh.. .perhaps in English. In Japanese a story would have an element
of invention in it. We don’t want any invention. We want the ‘straight
facts’, as you say in English.“</p>
<p>“Isn’t telling about something-using words, English or
Japanese-already something of an invention? Isn’t just looking upon this
world already something of an invention?“</p>
<p>“Uhh.“</p>
<p>“The world isn’t just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no?
And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn’t
that make life a story?“ “Ha! Ha! Ha! You are very intelligent,
Mr. Patel.“ Mr. Chiba: [translation] “What is he talking about?“ “I have
no idea.“ [/translation] Pi Patel: “You want words that reflect
reality?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Words that do not contradict reality?“ “Exactly.“</p>
<p>“But tigers don’t contradict reality.“ “Oh please, no more
tigers.“</p>
<p>“I know what you want. You want a story that won’t surprise you. That
will confirm what you already know. That won’t make you see higher or
further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You
want dry, yeastless factuality.“</p>
<p>“Uhh.“</p>
<p>“You want a story without animals.“</p>
<p>“Yes!“</p>
<p>“Without tigers or orang-utans.“ “That’s right.“ “Without hyenas or
zebras.“ “Without them.“</p>
<p>“Without meerkats or mongooses.“</p>
<p>“We don’t want them.“</p>
<p>“Without giraffes or hippopotamuses.“</p>
<p>“We will plug our ears with our fingers!“</p>
<p>“So I’m right. You want a story without animals.“</p>
<p>“We want a story without animals that will explain the sinking of the
Tsimtsum .“ “Give me a minute, please.“</p>
<p>“Of course. [translation] I think we’re finally getting somewhere.
Let’s hope he speaks some sense.“ [/translation] [Long silence]</p>
<p>“Here’s another story.“</p>
<p>“Good.“</p>
<p>“The ship sank. It made a sound like a monstrous metallic burp.
Things bubbled at the surface and then vanished. I found myself kicking
water in the Pacific Ocean. I swam for the lifeboat. It was the hardest
swim of my life. I didn’t seem to be moving. I kept swallowing water. I
was very cold. I was rapidly losing strength. I wouldn’t have made it if
the cook hadn’t thrown me a lifebuoy and pulled me in. I climbed aboard
and collapsed.</p>
<p>“Four of us survived. Mother held on to some bananas and made it to
the lifeboat. The cook was already aboard, as was the sailor.</p>
<p>“He ate the flies. The cook, that is. We hadn’t been in the lifeboat
a full day; we had food and water to last us for weeks; we had fishing
gear and solar stills; we had no reason to believe that we wouldn’t be
rescued soon. Yet there he was, swinging his arms and catching flies and
eating them greedily. Right away he was in a holy terror of hunger. He
was calling us idiots and fools for not joining him in the feast. We
were offended and disgusted, but we didn’t show it. We were very polite
about it. He was a stranger and a foreigner. Mother smiled and shook her
head and raised her hand in refusal. He was a disgusting man. His mouth
had the discrimination of a garbage heap. He also ate the rat. He cut it
up and dried it in the sun. I-I’ll be honest-I had a small piece, very
small, behind Mother’s back. I was so hungry. He was such a brute, that
cook, ill-tempered and hypocritical.</p>
<p>“The sailor was young. Actually, he was older than me, probably in
his early twenties, but he broke his leg jumping from the ship and his
suffering made him a child. He was beautiful. He had no facial hair at
all and a clear, shining complexion. His features-the broad face, the
flattened nose, the narrow, pleated eyes-looked so elegant. I thought he
looked like a Chinese emperor. His suffering was terrible. He spoke no
English, not a single word, not yes or no, hello or thank you . He spoke
only Chinese. We couldn’t understand a word he said. He must have felt
very lonely. When he wept, Mother held his head in her lap and I held
his hand. It was very, very sad. He suffered and we couldn’t do anything
about it.</p>
<p>“His right leg was badly broken at the thigh. The bone stuck out of
his flesh. He screamed with pain. We set his leg as best we could and we
made sure he was eating and drinking. But his leg became infected.
Though we drained it of pus every day, it got worse. His foot became
black and bloated.</p>
<p>“It was the cook’s idea. He was a brute. He dominated us. He
whispered that the blackness would spread and that he would survive only
if his leg were amputated. Since the bone was broken at the thigh, it
would involve no more than cutting through flesh and setting a
tourniquet. I can still hear his evil whisper. He would do the job to
save the sailor’s life, he said, but we would have to hold him. Surprise
would be the only anaesthetic. We fell upon him. Mother and I held his
arms while the cook sat on his good leg. The sailor writhed and
screamed. His chest rose and fell. The cook worked the knife quickly.
The leg fell off. Immediately Mother and I let go and moved away. We
thought that if the restraint was ended, so would his struggling. We
thought he would lie calmly. He didn’t. He sat up instantly. His screams
were all the worse for being unintelligible. He screamed and we stared,
transfixed. There was blood everywhere. Worse, there was the contrast
between the frantic activity of the poor sailor and the gentle repose of
his leg at the bottom of the boat. He kept looking at the limb, as if
imploring it to return. At last he fell back. We hurried into action.
The cook folded some skin over the bone. We wrapped the stump in a piece
of cloth and we tied a rope above the wound to stop the bleeding. We
laid him as comfortably as we could on a mattress of life jackets and
kept him warm. I thought it was all for nothing. I couldn’t believe a
human being could survive so much pain, so much butchery. Throughout the
evening and night he moaned, and his breathing was harsh and uneven. He
had fits of agitated delirium. I expected him to die during the
night.</p>
<p>“He clung to life. At dawn he was still alive. He went in and out of
consciousness. Mother gave him water. I caught sight of the amputated
leg. It cut my breath short. In the commotion it had been shoved aside
and forgotten in the dark. It had seeped a liquid and looked thinner. I
took a life jacket and used it as a glove. I picked the leg up.</p>
<p>“‘What are you doing?’ asked the cook.</p>
<p>“‘I’m going to throw it overboard,’ I replied.</p>
<p>“‘Don’t be an idiot. We’ll use it as bait. That was the whole
point.’</p>
<p>“He seemed to regret his last words even as they were coming out, for
his voice faded quickly. He turned away.</p>
<p>“‘The whole point ?’ Mother asked. ‘What do you mean by that?’ “He
pretended to be busy.</p>
<p>“Mother’s voice rose. ‘Are you telling us that we cut this poor boy’s
leg off not to save his life but to get fishing bait?’ “Silence from the
brute. “‘Answer me!’ shouted Mother.</p>
<p>“Like a cornered beast he lifted his eyes and glared at her. ‘Our
supplies are running out,’ he snarled. ‘We need more food or we’ll
die.’</p>
<p>“Mother returned his glare. ‘Our supplies are not running out! We
have plenty of food and water. We have package upon package of biscuits
to tide us over till our rescue.’ She took hold of the plastic container
in which we put the open rations of biscuits. It was unexpectedly light
in her hands. The few crumbs in it rattled. ‘What!’ She opened it.
‘Where are the biscuits? The container was full last night!’</p>
<p>“The cook looked away. As did I.</p>
<p>“‘You selfish monster!’ screamed Mother. ‘The only reason we’re
running out of food is because you’re gorging yourself on it!’</p>
<p>“‘He had some too,’ he said, nodding my way. “Mother’s eyes turned to
me. My heart sank. “‘Piscine, is that true?’</p>
<p>“‘It was night, Mother. I was half asleep and I was so hungry. He
gave me a biscuit. I ate it without thinking…’</p>
<p>“‘Only one, was it?’ sneered the cook.</p>
<p>“It was Mother’s turn to look away. The anger seemed to go out of
her. Without saying another word she went back to nursing the
sailor.</p>
<p>“I wished for her anger. I wished for her to punish me. Only not this
silence. I made to arrange some life jackets for the sailor’s comfort so
that I could be next to her. I whispered, ‘I’m sorry, Mother, I’m
sorry.’ My eyes were brimming with tears. When I brought them up, I saw
that hers were too. But she didn’t look at me. Her eyes were gazing upon
some memory in mid-air.</p>
<p>“‘We’re all alone, Piscine, all alone,’ she said, in a tone that
broke every hope in my body. I never felt so lonely in all my life as I
did at that moment. We had been in the lifeboat two weeks already and it
was taking its toll on us. It was getting harder to believe that Father
and Ravi had survived.</p>
<p>“When we turned around, the cook was holding the leg by the ankle
over the water to drain it. Mother brought her hand over the sailor’s
eyes.</p>
<p>“He died quietly, the life drained out of him like the liquid from
his leg. The cook promptly butchered him. The leg had made for poor
bait. The dead flesh was too decayed to hold on to the fishing hook; it
simply dissolved in the water. Nothing went to waste with this monster.
He cut up everything, including the sailor’s skin and every inch of his
intestines. He even prepared his genitals. When he had finished with his
torso, he moved on to his arms and shoulders and to his legs. Mother and
I rocked with pain and horror. Mother shrieked at the cook, ‘How can you
do this, you monster? Where is your humanity? Have you no decency? What
did the poor boy do to you? You monster! You monster!’ The cook replied
with unbelievable vulgarity.</p>
<p>“‘At least cover his face, for God’s sake!’ cried my mother. It was
unbearable to have that beautiful face, so noble and serene, connected
to such a sight below. The cook threw himself upon the sailor’s head and
before our very eyes scalped him and pulled off his face. Mother and I
vomited.</p>
<p>“When he had finished, he threw the butchered carcass overboard.
Shortly after, strips of flesh and pieces of organs were lying to dry in
the sun all over the boat. We recoiled in horror. We tried not to look
at them. The smell would not go away.</p>
<p>“The next time the cook was close by, Mother slapped him in the face,
a full hard slap that punctuated the air with a sharp crack. It was
something shocking coming from my mother. And it was heroic. It was an
act of outrage and pity and grief and bravery. It was done in memory of
that poor sailor. It was to salvage his dignity.</p>
<p>“I was stunned. So was the cook. He stood without moving or saying a
word as Mother looked him straight in the face. I noticed how he did not
meet her eyes.</p>
<p>“We retreated to our private spaces. I stayed close to her. I was
filled with a mix of rapt admiration and abject fear.</p>
<p>“Mother kept an eye on him. Two days later she saw him do it. He
tried to be discreet, but she saw him bring his hand to his mouth. She
shouted, ‘I saw you! You just ate a piece! You said it was for bait! I
knew it. You monster! You animal! How could you? He’s human ! He’s your
own kind!’ If she had expected him to be mortified, to spit it out and
break down and apologize, she was wrong. He kept chewing. In fact, he
lifted his head up and quite openly put the rest of the strip in his
mouth. ‘Tastes like pork,’ he muttered. Mother expressed her indignation
and disgust by violently turning away. He ate another strip. ‘I feel
stronger already,’ he muttered. He concentrated on his fishing.</p>
<p>“We each had our end of the lifeboat. It’s amazing how willpower can
build walls. Whole days went by as if he weren’t there.</p>
<p>“But we couldn’t ignore him entirely. He was a brute, but a practical
brute. He was good with his hands and he knew the sea. He was full of
good ideas. He was the one who thought of building a raft to help with
the fishing. If we survived any time at all, it was thanks to him. I
helped him as best I could. He was very short-tempered, always shouting
at me and insulting me.</p>
<p>“Mother and I didn’t eat any of the sailor’s body, not the smallest
morsel, despite the cost in weakness to us, but we did start to eat what
the cook caught from the sea. My mother, a lifelong vegetarian, brought
herself to eat raw fish and raw turtle. She had a very hard time of it.
She never got over her revulsion. It came easier to me. I found hunger
improved the taste of everything.</p>
<p>“When your life has been given a reprieve, it’s impossible not to
feel some warmth for the one to whom you owe that reprieve. It was very
exciting when the cook hauled aboard a turtle or caught a great big
dorado. It made us smile broadly and there was a glow in our chests that
lasted for hours. Mother and the cook talked in a civil way, even joked.
During some spectacular sunsets, life on the boat was nearly good. At
such times I looked at him with-yes-with tenderness. With love. I
imagined that we were fast friends. He was a coarse man even when he was
in a good mood, but we pretended not to notice it, even to ourselves. He
said that we would come upon an island. That was our main hope. We
exhausted our eyes scanning the horizon for an island that never came.
That’s when he stole food and water.</p>
<p>“The flat and endless Pacific rose like a great wall around us. I
never thought we would get around it.</p>
<p>“He killed her. The cook killed my mother. We were starving. I was
weak. I couldn’t hold on to a turtle. Because of me we lost it. He hit
me. Mother hit him. He hit her back. She turned to me and said, ‘Go!’
pushing me towards the raft. I jumped for it. I thought she was coming
with me. I landed in the water. I scrambled aboard the raft. They were
fighting. I did nothing but watch. My mother was fighting an adult man.
He was mean and muscular. He caught her by the wrist and twisted it. She
shrieked and fell. He moved over her. The knife appeared. He raised it
in the air. It came down. Next it was up-it was red. It went up and down
repeatedly. I couldn’t see her. She was at the bottom of the boat. I saw
only him. He stopped. He raised his head and looked at me. He hurled
something my way. A line of blood struck me across the face. No whip
could have inflicted a more painful lash. I held my mother’s head in my
hands. I let it go. It sank in a cloud of blood, her tress trailing like
a tail. Fish spiralled down towards it until a shark’s long grey shadow
cut across its path and it vanished. I looked up. I couldn’t see him. He
was hiding at the bottom of the boat. He appeared when he threw my
mother’s body overboard. His mouth was red. The water boiled with
fish.</p>
<p>“I spent the rest of that day and the night on the raft, looking at
him. We didn’t speak a word. He could have cut the raft loose. But he
didn’t. He kept me around, like a bad conscience.</p>
<p>“In the morning, in plain sight of him, I pulled on the rope and
boarded the lifeboat. I was very weak. He said nothing. I kept my peace.
He caught a turtle. He gave me its blood. He butchered it and laid its
best parts for me on the middle bench. I ate.</p>
<p>“Then we fought and I killed him. He had no expression on his face,
neither of despair nor of anger, neither of fear nor of pain. He gave
up. He let himself be killed, though it was still a struggle. He knew he
had gone too far, even by his bestial standards. He had gone too far and
now he didn’t want to go on living any more. But he never said ‘I’m
sorry.’ Why do we cling to our evil ways?</p>
<p>“The knife was all along in plain view on the bench. We both knew it.
He could have had it in his hands from the start. He was the one who put
it there. I picked it up. I stabbed him in the stomach. He grimaced but
remained standing. I pulled the knife out and stabbed him again. Blood
was pouring out. Still he didn’t fall over. Looking me in the eyes, he
lifted his head ever so slightly. Did he mean something by this? I took
it that he did. I stabbed him in the throat, next to the Adam’s apple.
He dropped like a stone. And died. He didn’t say anything. He had no
last words. He only coughed up blood. A knife has a horrible dynamic
power; once in motion, it’s hard to stop. I stabbed him repeatedly. His
blood soothed my chapped hands. His heart was a struggle-all those tubes
that connected it. I managed to get it out. It tasted delicious, far
better than turtle. I ate his liver. I cut off great pieces of his
flesh.</p>
<p>“He was such an evil man. Worse still, he met evil in me-selfishness,
anger, ruthlessness. I must live with that.</p>
<p>“Solitude began. I turned to God. I survived.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>“Is that better? Are there any parts you find hard to believe?
Anything you’d like me to change?“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “What a horrible story.“ [Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Both the zebra and the Taiwanese sailor broke a leg,
did you notice that?“ “No, I didn’t.“</p>
<p>“And the hyena bit off the zebra’s leg just as the cook cut off the
sailor’s.“ “Ohhh, Okamoto-san, you see a lot.“</p>
<p>“The blind Frenchman they met in the other lifeboat-didn’t he admit
to killing a man and a woman?“</p>
<p>“Yes, he did.“</p>
<p>“The cook killed the sailor and his mother“ “Very impressive.“ “His
stories match.“</p>
<p>“So the Taiwanese sailor is the zebra, his mother is the orang-utan,
the cook is. the hyena-which means he is the tiger!“</p>
<p>“Yes. The tiger killed the hyena-and the blind Frenchman-just as he
killed the cook.“</p>
<p>[/translation]</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Do you have another chocolate bar?“ Mr. Chiba: “Right
away!“ “Thank you.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “But what does it mean, Okamoto-san?“ “I
have no idea.“</p>
<p>“And what about those teeth? Whose teeth were those in the tree?“ “I
don’t know. I’m not inside this boy’s head.“ [/translation] [Long
silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Please excuse me for asking, but did the cook say
anything about the sinking of the Tsimtsum ?“</p>
<p>“In this other story?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“He didn’t.“</p>
<p>“He made no mention of anything leading up to the early morning of
July 2nd that might explain what happened?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Nothing of a nature mechanical or structural?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Nothing about other ships or objects at sea?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“He could not explain the sinking of the Tsimtsum at all?“</p>
<p>“No“</p>
<p>“Could he say why it didn’t send out a distress signal?“</p>
<p>“And if it had? In my experience, when a dingy, third-rate
rust-bucket sinks, unless it has the luck of carrying oil, lots of it,
enough to kill entire ecosystems, no one cares and no one hears about
it. You’re on your own.“</p>
<p>“When Oika realized that something was wrong, it was too late. You
were too far out for air rescue. Ships in the area were told to be on
the lookout. They reported seeing nothing.“</p>
<p>“And while we’re on the subject, the ship wasn’t the only thing that
was third-rate. The crew were a sullen, unfriendly lot, hard at work
when officers were around but doing nothing when they weren’t. They
didn’t speak a word of English and they were of no help to us. Some of
them stank of alcohol by mid-afternoon. Who’s to say what those idiots
did? The officers-“</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?“</p>
<p>“By what?“</p>
<p>“‘Who’s to say what those idiots did?’“</p>
<p>“I mean that maybe in a fit of drunken insanity some of them released
the animals.“ Mr. Chiba: “Who had the keys to the cages?“ “Father
did.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “So how could the crew open the cages if they didn’t have
the keys?“ “I don’t know. They probably used crowbars.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Why would they do that? Why would anyone want to release
a dangerous wild animal from its cage?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Can anyone fathom the workings of a drunken man’s
mind? All I can tell you is what happened. The animals were out of their
cages.“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Excuse me. You have doubts about the fitness of the
crew?“ “Grave doubts.“</p>
<p>“Did you witness any of the officers being under the influence of
alcohol?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“But you saw some of the crew being under the influence of
alcohol?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Did the officers act in what seemed to you a competent and
professional manner?“</p>
<p>“They had little to do with us. They never came close to the
animals.“ “I mean in terms of running the ship.“</p>
<p>“How should I know? Do you think we had tea with them every day? They
spoke English, but they were no better than the crew. They made us feel
unwelcome in the common room and hardly said a word to us during meals.
They went on in Japanese, as if we weren’t there. We were just a lowly
Indian family with a bothersome cargo. We ended up eating on our own in
Father and Mother’s cabin. ‘Adventure beckons!’ said Ravi. That’s what
made it tolerable, our sense of adventure. We spent most of our time
shovelling excrement and rinsing cages and giving feed while Father
played the vet. So long as the animals were all right, we were all
right. I don’t know if the officers were competent.“</p>
<p>“You said the ship was listing to port?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And that there was an incline from bow to stern?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“So the ship sank stern first?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Not bow first?“ “No.“</p>
<p>“You are sure? There was a slope from the front of the ship to the
back?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Did the ship hit another ship?“ “I didn’t see another ship.“ “Did it
hit any other object?“ “Not that I saw.“ “Did it run aground?“ “No, it
sank out of sight.“</p>
<p>“You were not aware of mechanical problems after leaving Manila?“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“Did it appear to you that the ship was properly loaded?“</p>
<p>“It was my first time on a ship. I don’t know what a properly loaded
ship should look like.“ “You believe you heard an explosion?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Any other noises?“ “A thousand.“</p>
<p>“I mean that might explain the sinking.“</p>
<p>“No.“</p>
<p>“You said the ship sank quickly.“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Can you estimate how long it took?“</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say. Very quickly. I would think less than twenty
minutes.“ “And there was a lot of debris?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Was the ship struck by a freak wave?“ “I don’t think so.“ “But there
was a storm?“</p>
<p>“The sea looked rough to me. There was wind and rain.“</p>
<p>“How high were the waves?“</p>
<p>“High. Twenty-five, thirty feet.“</p>
<p>“That’s quite modest, actually.“</p>
<p>“Not when you’re in a lifeboat.“</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. But for a cargo ship.“</p>
<p>“Maybe they were higher. I don’t know. The weather was bad enough to
scare me witless, that’s all I know for sure.“</p>
<p>“You said the weather improved quickly. The ship sank and right after
it was a beautiful day, isn’t that what you said?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Sounds like no more than a passing squall.“</p>
<p>“It sank the ship.“</p>
<p>“That’s what we’re wondering.“</p>
<p>“My whole family died.“</p>
<p>“We’re sorry about that.“</p>
<p>“Not as much as I am.“</p>
<p>“So what happened, Mr. Patel? We’re puzzled. Everything was normal
and then.?“ “Then normal sank.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“I don’t know. You should be telling me. You’re the experts. Apply
your science.“ “We don’t understand.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “Now what?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “We give up. The explanation for the sinking of the
Tsimtsum is at the bottom of the Pacific.“</p>
<p>[Long silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Yes, that’s it. Let’s go.[/translation] Well,
Mr. Patel, I think we have all we need. We thank you very much for your
cooperaticon. You’ve been very, very helpful.“ “You’re welcome. But
before you go, I’d like to ask you something.“</p>
<p>“Yes?“</p>
<p>“The Tsimtsum sank on July 2nd, 1977.“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“And I arrived on the coast of Mexico, the sole human surviwor of the
Tsimtsum, on February 14th, 1978.“</p>
<p>“That’s right.“</p>
<p>“I told you two stories that account for the 227 days in between.“
“Yes, you did.“</p>
<p>“Neither explains the sinking of the Tsimtsum.“ “That’s right.“</p>
<p>“Neither makes a factual difference to you.“ “That’s true.“</p>
<p>“You can’t prove which story is true and which is not. You must take
my word for it.“ “I guess so.“</p>
<p>“In both stories the ship sinks, my entire family dies, and I
suffer.“ “Yes, that’s true.“</p>
<p>“So tell me, since it makes no factual difference to you and you
can’t prove the question either way, which story do you prefer? Which is
the better story, the story with animals or the story without
animals?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “That’s an interesting question.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “The story with animals.“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: [translation] “Yes. [/translation] The story with
animals is the better story.“ Pi Patel: “Thank you. And so it goes with
God.“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: [translation] “What did he just say?“ Mr. Okamoto: “I
don’t know.“ Mr. Chiba: “Oh look-he’s crying.“ [/translation] [Long
silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “We’ll be careful when we drive away. We don’t want to
run into Richard Parker.“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Don’t worry, you won’t. He’s hiding somewhere you’ll never
find him.“ Mr. Okamoto: “Thank you for taking the time to talk to us,
Mr. Patel. We’re grateful. And we’re really very sorry about what
happened to you.“ “Thank you.“</p>
<p>“What will you be doing now?“ “I guess I’ll go to Canada.“ “Not back
to India?“</p>
<p>“No. There’s nothing there for me now. Only sad memories.“ “Of
course, you know you will be getting insurance money.“</p>
<p>“Oh.“</p>
<p>“Yes. Oika will be in touch with you.“</p>
<p>[Silence]</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “We should be going. We wish you all the best,
Mr. Patel.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Yes, all the best.“</p>
<p>“Thank you.“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “Goodbye.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Goodbye.“</p>
<p>Pi Patel: “Would you like some cookies for the road?“</p>
<p>Mr. Okamoto: “That would be nice.“</p>

<p>“Thank you.“</p>
<p>Mr. Chiba: “Thank you.“</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Goodbye. God be with you, my brothers.“ “Thank you.
And with you too, Mr. Patel.“ Mr. Chiba: “Goodbye.“</p>
