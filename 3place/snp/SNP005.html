<h4 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h4>
<p>I was named after a swimming pool. Quite peculiar considering my
parents never took to water. One of my father’s earliest business
contacts was Francis Adirubasamy. He became a good friend of the family.
I called him Mamaji, mama being the Tamil word for uncle and ji being a
suffix used in India to indicate respect and affection. When he was a
young man, long before I was born, Mamaji was a champion competitive
swimmer, the champion of all South India. He looked the part his whole
life. My brother Ravi once told me that when Mamaji was born he didn’t
want to give up on breathing water and so the doctor, to save his life,
had to take him by the feet and swing him above his head round and
round.</p>
<p>“It did the trick!“ said Ravi, wildly spinning his hand above his
head. “He coughed out water and started breathing air, but it forced all
his flesh and blood to his upper body. That’s why his chest is so thick
and his legs are so skinny.“</p>
<p>I believed him. (Ravi was a merciless teaser. The first time he
called Mamaji “Mr. Fish“ to my face I left a banana peel in his bed.)
Even in his sixties, when he was a little stooped and a lifetime of
counter-obstetric gravity had begun to nudge his flesh downwards, Mamaji
swam thirty lengths every morning at the pool of the Aurobindo Ashram.
He tried to teach my parents to swim, but he never got them to go beyond
wading up to their knees at the beach and making ludicrous round motions
with their arms, which, if they were practising the breaststroke, made
them look as if they were walking through a jungle, spreading the tall
grass ahead of them, or, if it was the front crawl, as if they were
running down a hill and flailing their arms so as not to fall. Ravi was
just as unenthusiastic. Mamaji had to wait until I came into the picture
to find a willing disciple. The day I came of swimming age, which, to
Mother’s distress, Mamaji claimed was seven, he brought me down to the
beach, spread his arms seaward and said, “This is my gift to you.“</p>
<p>“And then he nearly drowned you,“ claimed Mother. I remained faithful
to my aquatic guru. Under his watchful eye I lay on the beach and
fluttered my legs and scratched away at the sand with my hands, turning
my head at every stroke to breathe. I must have looked like a child
throwing a peculiar, slow-motion tantrum. In the water, as he held me at
the surface, I tried my best to swim. It was much more difficult than on
land. But Mamaji was patient and encouraging. When he felt that I had
progressed sufficiently, we turned our backs on the laughing and the
shouting, the running and the splashing, the blue-green waves and the
bubbly surf, and headed for the proper rectangularity and the formal
flatness (and the paying admission) of the ashram swimming pool. I went
there with him three times a week throughout my childhood, a Monday,
Wednesday, Friday early morning ritual with the clockwork regularity of
a good front-crawl stroke. I have vivid memories of this dignified old
man stripping down to nakedness next to me, his body slowly emerging as
he neatly disposed of each item of clothing, decency being salvaged at
the very end by a slight turning away and a magnificent pair of imported
athletic bathing trunks. He stood straight and he was ready. It had an
epic simplicity. Swimming instruction, which in time became swimming
practice, was gruelling, but there was the deep pleasure of doing a
stroke with increasing ease and speed, over and over, till hypnosis
practically, the water turning from molten lead to liquid light.</p>
<p>It was on my own, a guilty pleasure, that I returned to the sea,
beckoned by the mighty waves that crashed down and reached for me in
humble tidal ripples, gentle lassos that caught their willing Indian
boy. My gift to Mamaji one birthday, I must have been thirteen or so,
was two full lengths of credible butterfly. I finished so spent I could
hardly wave to him. Beyond the activity of swimming, there was the talk
of it. It was the talk that Father loved. The more vigorously he
resisted actually swimming, the more he fancied it. Swim lore was his
vacation talk from the workaday talk of running a zoo. Water without a
hippopotamus was so much more manageable than water with one. Mamaji
studied in Paris for two years, thanks to the colonial administration.
He had the time of his life. This was in the early 1930s, when the
French were still trying to make Pondicherry as Gallic as the British
were trying to make the rest of India Britannic. I don’t recall exactly
what Mamaji studied. Something commercial, I suppose. He was a great
storyteller, but forget about his studies or the Eiffel Tower or the
Louvre or the cafes of the Champs-Elysees. All his stories had to do
with swimming pools and swimming competitions. For example, there was
the Piscine Deligny, the city’s oldest pool, dating back to 1796, an
open-air barge moored to the Quai d’Orsay and the venue for the swimming
events of the 1900 Olympics. But none of the times were recognized by
the International Swimming Federation because the pool was six metres
too long. The water in the pool came straight from the Seine, unfiltered
and unheated. “It was cold and dirty,“ said Mamaji. “The water, having
crossed all of Paris, came in foul enough. Then people at the pool made
it utterly disgusting.“ In conspiratorial whispers, with shocking
details to back up his claim, he assured us that the French had very low
standards of personal hygiene. “Deligny was bad enough. Bain Royal,
another latrine on the Seine, was worse. At least at Deligny they
scooped out the dead fish.“ Nevertheless, an Olympic pool is an Olympic
pool, touched by immortal glory. Though it was a cesspool, Mamaji spoke
of Deligny with a fond smile. One was better off at the Piscines
Chateau-Landon, Rouvet or du boulevard de la Gare. They were indoor
pools with roofs, on land and open year-round. Their water was supplied
by the condensation from steam engines from nearby factories and so was
cleaner and warmer. But these pools were still a bit dingy and tended to
be crowded. “There was so much gob and spit floating in the water, I
thought I was swimming through jellyfish,“ chuckled Mamaji. The Piscines
Hebert, Ledru-Rollin and Butte-aux-Cailles were bright, modern, spacious
pools fed by artesian wells. They set the standard for excellence in
municipal swimming pools. There was the Piscine des Tourelles, of
course, the city’s other great Olympic pool, inaugurated during the
second Paris games, of 1924. And there were still others, many of them.
But no swimming pool in Mamaji’s eyes matched the glory of the Piscine
Molitor. It was the crowning aquatic glory of Paris, indeed, of the
entire civilized world.</p>
<p>“It was a pool the gods would have delighted to swim in. Molitor had
the best competitive swimming club in Paris. There were two pools, an
indoor and an outdoor. Both were as big as small oceans. The indoor pool
always had two lanes reserved for swimmers who wanted to do lengths. The
water was so clean and clear you could have used it to make your morning
coffee. Wooden changing cabins, blue and white, surrounded the pool on
two floors. You could look down and see everyone and everything. The
porters who marked your cabin door with chalk to show that it was
occupied were limping old men, friendly in an ill-tempered way. No
amount of shouting and tomfoolery ever ruffled them. The showers gushed
hot, soothing water. There was a steam room and an exercise room. The
outside pool became a skating rink in winter. There was a bar, a
cafeteria, a large sunning deck, even two small beaches with real sand.
Every bit of tile, brass and wood gleamed. It was-it was…“</p>
<p>It was the only pool that made Mamaji fall silent, his memory making
too many lengths to mention. Mamaji remembered, Father dreamed. That is
how I got my name when I entered this world, a last, welcome addition to
my family, three years after Ravi: Piscine Molitor Patel .</p>
