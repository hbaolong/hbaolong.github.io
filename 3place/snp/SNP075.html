<h4 id="chapter-77">Chapter 77</h4>
<p>As the cartons of survival rations diminished, I reduced my intake
till I was following instructions exactly, holding myself to only two
biscuits every eight hours. I was continuously hungry. I thought about
food obsessively. The less I had to eat, the larger became the portions
I dreamed of. My fantasy meals grew to be the size of India. A Ganges of
dhal soup. Hot chapattis the size of Rajasthan. Bowls of rice as big as
Uttar Pradesh. Sambars to flood all of Tamil Nadu. Ice cream heaped as
high as the Himalayas. My dreaming became quite expert: all ingredients
for my dishes were always in fresh and plentiful supply; the oven or
frying pan was always at just the right temperature; the proportion of
things was always bang on; nothing was ever burnt or undercooked,
nothing too hot or too cold. Every meal was simply perfect-only just
beyond the reach of my hands. By degrees the range of my appetite
increased. Whereas at first I gutted fish and peeled their skin
fastidiously, soon I no more than rinsed off their slimy slipperiness
before biting into them, delighted to have such a treat between my
teeth. I recall flying fish as being quite tasty, their flesh rosy white
and tender. Dorado had a firmer texture and a stronger taste. I began to
pick at fish heads rather than toss them to Richard Parker or use them
as bait. It was a great discovery when I found that a fresh-tasting
fluid could be sucked out not only from the eyes of larger fish but also
from their vertebrae. Turtles-which previously I had roughly opened up
with the knife and tossed onto the floor of the boat for Richard Parker,
like a bowl of hot soup-became my favourite dish. It seems impossible to
imagine that there was a time when I looked upon a live sea turtle as a
ten-course meal of great delicacy, a blessed respite from fish. Yet so
it was. In the veins of turtles coursed a sweet lassi that had to be
drunk as soon as it spurted from their necks, because it coagulated in
less than a minute. The best poriyals and kootus in the land could not
rival turtle flesh, either cured brown or fresh deep red. No cardamom
payasam I ever tasted was as sweet or as rich as creamy turtle eggs or
cured turtle fat. A chopped-up mixture of heart, lungs, liver, flesh and
cleaned-out intestines sprinkled with fish parts, the whole soaked in a
yolk-and-serum gravy, made an unsurpassable, finger-licking thali. By
the end of my journey I was eating everything a turtle had to offer. In
the algae that covered the shells of some hawksbills I sometimes found
small crabs and barnacles. Whatever I found in a turtle’s stomach became
my turn to eat. I whiled away many a pleasant hour gnawing at a flipper
joint or splitting open bones and licking out their marrow. And my
fingers were forever picking away at bits of dry fat and dry flesh that
clung to the inner sides of shells, rummaging for food in the automatic
way of monkeys. Turtle shells were very handy. I couldn’t have done
without them. They served not only as shields, but as cutting boards for
fish and as bowls for mixing food. And when the elements had destroyed
the blankets beyond repair, I used the shells to protect myself from the
sun by propping them against each other and lying beneath them. It was
frightening, the extent to which a full belly made for a good mood. The
one would follow the other measure for measure: so much food and water,
so much good mood. It was such a terribly fickle existence. I was at the
mercy of turtle meat for smiles. By the time the last of the biscuits
had disappeared, anything was good to eat, no matter the taste. I could
put anything in my mouth, chew it and swallow it-delicious, foul or
plain-so long as it wasn’t salty. My body developed a revulsion for salt
that I still experience to this day. I tried once to eat Richard
Parker’s feces. It happened early on, when my system hadn’t learned yet
to live with hunger and my imagination was still wildly searching for
solutions. I had delivered fresh solar-still water to his bucket not
long before. After draining it in one go, he had disappeared below the
tarpaulin and I had returned to attending to some small matter in the
locker. As I always did in those early days, I glanced below the
tarpaulin every so often to make sure he wasn’t up to something. Well,
this one time, lo, he was. He was crouched, his back was rounded and his
rear legs were spread. His tail was raised, pushing up against the
tarpaulin. The position was tell-tale. Right away I had food in mind,
not animal hygiene. I decided there was little danger. He was turned the
other way and his head was out of sight. If I respected his peace and
quiet, he might not even notice me. I grabbed a bailing cup and
stretched my arm forward. My cup arrived in the nick of time. At the
second it was in position at the base of his tail, Richard Parker’s anus
distended, and out of it, like a bubble-gum balloon, came a black sphere
of excrement. It fell into my cup with a clink, and no doubt I will be
considered to have abandoned the last vestiges of humanness by those who
do not understand the degree of my suffering when I say that it sounded
to my ears like the music of a five-rupee coin dropped into a beggar’s
cup. A smile cracked my lips and made them bleed. I felt deep gratitude
towards Richard Parker. I pulled back the cup. I took the turd in my
fingers. It was very warm, but the smell was not strong. In size it was
like a big ball of gulab jamun, but with none of the softness. In fact,
it was as hard as a rock. Load a musket with it and you could have shot
a rhino. I returned the ball to the cup and added a little water. I
covered it and set it aside. My mouth watered as I waited. When I
couldn’t stand the wait any longer, I popped the ball into my mouth. I
couldn’t eat it. The taste was acrid, but it wasn’t that. It was rather
my mouth’s conclusion, immediate and obvious: there’s nothing to be had
here. It was truly waste matter, with no nutrients in it. I spat it out
and was bitter at the loss of precious water. I took the gaff and went
about collecting the rest of Richard Parker’s feces. They went straight
to the fish. After just a few weeks my body began to deteriorate. My
feet and ankles started to swell and I was finding it very tiring to
stand.</p>
