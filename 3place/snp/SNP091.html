<h4 id="chapter-94">Chapter 94</h4>
<p>When we reached land, Mexico to be exact, I was so weak I barely had
the strength to be happy about it. We had great difficulty landing. The
lifeboat nearly capsized in the surf. I streamed the sea anchors-what
was left of them-full open to keep us perpendicular to the waves, and I
tripped them as soon as we began riding a crest. In this way, streaming
and tripping the anchors, we surfed in to shore. It was dangerous. But
we caught one wave at just the right point and it carried us a great
distance, past the high, collapsing walls of water. I tripped the
anchors a last time and we were pushed in the rest of the way. The boat
hissed to a halt against the sand. I let myself down the side. I was
afraid to let go, afraid that so close to deliverance, in two feet of
water, I would drown. I looked ahead to see how far I had to go. The
glance gave me one of my last images of Richard Parker, for at that
precise moment he jumped over me. I saw his body, so immeasurably vital,
stretched in the air above me, a fleeting, furred rainbow. He landed in
the water, his back legs splayed, his tail high, and from there, in a
few hops, he reached the beach. He went to the left, his paws gouging
the wet sand, but changed his mind and spun around. He passed directly
in front of me on his way to the right. He didn’t look at me. He ran a
hundred yards or so along the shore before turning in. His gait was
clumsy and uncoordinated. He fell several times. At the edge of the
jungle, he stopped. I was certain he would turn my way. He would look at
me. He would flatten his ears. He would growl. In some such way, he
would conclude our relationship. He did nothing of the sort. He only
looked fixedly into the jungle. Then Richard Parker, companion of my
torment, awful, fierce thing that kept me alive, moved forward and
disappeared forever from my life.</p>
<p>I struggled to shore and fell upon the sand. I looked about. I was
truly alone, orphaned not only of my family, but now of Richard Parker,
and nearly, I thought, of God. Of course, I wasn’t. This beach, so soft,
firm and vast, was like the cheek of God, and somewhere two eyes were
glittering with pleasure and a mouth was smiling at having me there.
After some hours a member of my own species found me. He left and
returned with a group. They were six or seven. They came up to me with
their hands covering their noses and mouths. I wondered what was wrong
with them. They spoke to me in a strange tongue. They pulled the
lifeboat onto the sand. They carried me away. The one piece of turtle
meat I had brought from the boat they wrenched from my hand and threw
away. I wept like a child. It was not because I was overcome at having
survived my ordeal, though I was. Nor was it the presence of my brothers
and sisters, though that too was very moving. I was weeping because
Richard Parker had left me so unceremoniously. What a terrible thing it
is to botch a farewell. I am a person who believes in form, in the
harmony of order. Where we can, we must give things a meaningful shape.
For example-I wonder-could you tell my jumbled story in exactly one
hundred chapters, not one more, not one less? I’ll tell you, that’s one
thing I hate about my nickname, the way that number runs on forever.
It’s important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you
let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never
did, and your heart is heavy with remorse. That bungled goodbye hurts me
to this day. I wish so much that I’d had one last look at him in the
lifeboat, that I’d provoked him a little, so that I was on his mind. I
wish I had said to him then-yes, I know, to a tiger, but still-I wish I
had said, “Richard Parker, it’s over. We have survived. Can you believe
it? I owe you more gratitude than I can express. I couldn’t have done it
without you. I would like to say it formally: Richard Parker, thank you.
Thank you for saving my life. And now go where you must. You have known
the confined freedom of a zoo most of your life; now you will know the
free confinement of a jungle. I wish you all the best with it. Watch out
for Man. He is not your friend. But I hope you will remember me as a
friend. I will never forget you, that is certain. You will always be
with me, in my heart. What is that hiss? Ah, our boat has touched sand.
So farewell, Richard Parker, farewell. God be with you.“</p>
<p>The people who found me took me to their village, and there some
women gave me a bath and scrubbed me so hard that I wondered if they
realized I was naturally brown-skinned and not a very dirty white boy. I
tried to explain. They nodded and smiled and kept on scrubbing me as if
I were the deck of a ship. I thought they were going to skin me alive.
But they gave me food. Delicious food. Once I started eating, I couldn’t
stop. I thought I would never stop being hungry. The next day a police
car came and brought me to a hospital, and there my story ends. I was
overwhelmed by the generosity of those who rescued me. Poor people gave
me clothes and food. Doctors and nurses cared for me as if I were a
premature baby. Mexican and Canadian officials opened all doors for me
so that from the beach in Mexico to the home of my foster mother to the
classrooms of the University of Toronto, there was only one long, easy
corridor I had to walk down. To all these people I would like to extend
my heartfelt thanks.</p>
