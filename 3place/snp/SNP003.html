<h4 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h4>
<p>My suffering left me sad and gloomy. Academic study and the steady,
mindful practice of religion slowly wrought me back to life. I have kept
up with what some people would consider my strange religious practices.
After one year of high school, I attended the University of Toronto and
took a double-major Bachelor’s degree. My majors were religious studies
and zoology. My fourth-year thesis for religious studies concerned
certain aspects of the cosmogony theory of Isaac Luria, the great
sixteenth-century Kabbalist from Safed. My zoology thesis was a
functional analysis of the thyroid gland of the three-toed sloth. I
chose the sloth because its demeanour-calm, quiet and introspective-did
something to soothe my shattered self. There are two-toed sloths and
there are three-toed sloths, the case being determined by the forepaws
of the animals, since all sloths have three claws on their hind paws. I
had the great luck one summer of studying the three-toed sloth in situ
in the equatorial jungles of Brazil. It is a highly intriguing creature.
Its only real habit is indolence. It sleeps or rests on average twenty
hours a day. Our team tested the sleep habits of five wild three-toed
sloths by placing on their heads, in the early evening after they had
fallen asleep, bright red plastic dishes filled with water. We found
them still in place late the next morning, the water of the dishes
swarming with insects. The sloth is at its busiest at sunset, using the
word busy here in the most relaxed sense. It moves along the bough of a
tree in its characteristic upside-down position at the speed of roughly
400 metres an hour. On the ground, it crawls to its next tree at the
rate of 250 metres an hour, when motivated, which is 440 times slower
than a motivated cheetah. Unmotivated, it covers four to five metres in
an hour. The three-toed sloth is not well informed about the outside
world. On a scale of 2 to 10, where 2 represents unusual dullness and 10
extreme acuity, Beebe (1926) gave the sloths senses of taste, touch,
sight and hearing a rating of 2, and its sense of smell a rating of 3.
If you come upon a sleeping three-toed sloth in the wild, two or three
nudges should suffice to awaken it; it will then look sleepily in every
direction but yours. Why it should look about is uncertain since the
sloth sees everything in a Magoo-like blur. As for hearing, the sloth is
not so much deaf as uninterested in sound. Beebe reported that firing
guns next to sleeping or feeding sloths elicited little reaction. And
the sloth’s slightly better sense of smell should not be overestimated.
They are said to be able to sniff and avoid decayed branches, but
Bullock (1968) reported that sloths fall to the ground clinging to
decayed branches “often.“</p>
<p>How does it survive, you might ask. Precisely by being so slow.
Sleepiness and slothfulness keep it out of harm’s way, away from the
notice of jaguars, ocelots, harpy eagles and anacondas. A sloth’s hairs
shelter an algae that is brown during the dry season and green during
the wet season, so the animal blends in with the surrounding moss and
foliage and looks like a nest of white ants or of squirrels, or like
nothing at all but part of a tree. The three-toed sloth lives a
peaceful, vegetarian life in perfect harmony with its environment. “A
good-natured smile is forever on its lips,“ reported Tirler (1966). I
have seen that smile with my own eyes. I am not one given to projecting
human traits and emotions onto animals, but many a time during that
month in Brazil, looking up at sloths in repose, I felt I was in the
presence of upside-down yogis deep in meditation or hermits deep in
prayer, wise beings whose intense imaginative lives were beyond the
reach of my scientific probing. Sometimes I got my majors mixed up. A
number of my fellow religious-studies students-muddled agnostics who
didn’t know which way was up, who were in the thrall of reason, that
fool’s gold for the bright-reminded me of the three-toed sloth; and the
three-toed sloth, such a beautiful example of the miracle of life,
reminded me of God. I never had problems with my fellow scientists.
Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer-drinking lot
whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are
not preoccupied with science. I was a very good student, if I may say so
myself. I was tops at St. Michael’s College four years in a row. I got
every possible student award from the Department of Zoology. If I got
none from the Department of Religious Studies, it is simply because
there are no student awards in this department (the rewards of religious
study are not in mortal hands, we all know that). I would have received
the Governor General’s Academic Medal, the University of Toronto’s
highest undergraduate award, of which no small number of illustrious
Canadians have been recipients, were it not for a beef-eating pink boy
with a neck like a tree trunk and a temperament of unbearable good
cheer. I still smart a little at the slight. When you’ve suffered a
great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and
trifling. My life is like a memento mori painting from European art:
there is always a grinning skull at my side to remind me of the folly of
human ambition. I mock this skull. I look at it and I say, “You’ve got
the wrong fellow. You may not believe in life, but I don’t believe in
death. Move on!“ The skull snickers and moves ever closer, but that
doesn’t surprise me. The reason death sticks so closely to life isn’t
biological necessity-it’s envy. Life is so beautiful that death has
fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it
can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of
no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud. The pink
boy also got the nod from the Rhodes Scholarship committee. I love him
and I hope his time at Oxford was a rich experience. If Lakshmi, goddess
of wealth, one day favours me bountifully, Oxford is fifth on the list
of cities I would like to visit before I pass on, after Mecca, Varanasi,
Jerusalem and Paris. I have nothing to say of my working life, only that
a tie is a noose, and inverted though it is, it will hang a man
nonetheless if he’s not careful. I love Canada. I miss the heat of
India, the food, the house lizards on the walls, the musicals on the
silver screen, the cows wandering the streets, the crows cawing, even
the talk of cricket matches, but I love Canada. It is a great country
much too cold for good sense, inhabited by compassionate, intelligent
people with bad hairdos. Anyway, I have nothing to go home to in
Pondicherry. Richard Parker has stayed with me. I’ve never forgotten
him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my
dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love.
Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand
how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye,
without looking back even once. That pain is like an axe that chops at
my heart. The doctors and nurses at the hospital in Mexico were
incredibly kind to me. And the patients, too. Victims of cancer or car
accidents, once they heard my story, they hobbled and wheeled over to
see me, they and their families, though none of them spoke English and I
spoke no Spanish. They smiled at me, shook my hand, patted me on the
head, left gifts of food and clothing on my bed. They moved me to
uncontrollable fits of laughing and crying. Within a couple of days I
could stand, even make two, three steps, despite nausea, dizziness and
general weakness. Blood tests revealed that I was anemic, and that my
level of sodium was very high and my potassium low. My body retained
fluids and my legs swelled up tremendously. I looked as if I had been
grafted with a pair of elephant legs. My urine was a deep, dark yellow
going on to brown. After a week or so, I could walk just about normally
and I could wear shoes if I didn’t lace them up. My skin healed, though
I still have scars on my shoulders and back. The first time I turned a
tap on, its noisy, wasteful, superabundant gush was such a shock that I
became incoherent and my legs collapsed beneath me and I fainted in the
arms of a nurse. The first time I went to an Indian restaurant in Canada
I used my fingers. The waiter looked at me critically and said, “Fresh
off the boat, are you?“ I blanched. My fingers, which a second before
had been taste buds savouring the food a little ahead of my mouth,
became dirty under his gaze. They froze like criminals caught in the
act. I didn’t dare lick them. I wiped them guiltily on my napkin. He had
no idea how deeply those words wounded me. They were like nails being
driven into my flesh. I picked up the knife and fork. I had hardly ever
used such instruments. My hands trembled. My sambar lost its taste.</p>
