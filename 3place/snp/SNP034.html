<h4 id="chapter-32">Chapter 32</h4>
<p>There are many examples of animals coming to surprising living
arrangements. All are instances of that animal equivalent of
anthropomorphism: zoomorphism, where an animal takes a human being, or
another animal, to be one of its kind. The most famous case is also the
most common: the pet dog, which has so assimilated humans into the realm
of doghood as to want to mate with them, a fact that any dog owner who
has had to pull an amorous dog from the leg of a mortified visitor will
confirm. Our golden agouti and spotted paca got along very well,
conentedly huddling together and sleeping against each other until the
first was stolen. I have already mentioned our rhinoceros-and-goat herd,
and the case of circus lions. There are confirmed stories of drowning
sailors being pushed up to the surface of the water and held there by
dolphins, a characteristic way in which these marine mammals help each
other. A case is mentioned in the literature of a stoat and a rat living
in a companion relationship, while other rats presented to the stoat
were devoured by it in the typical way of stoats. We had our own case of
the freak suspension of the predator-prey relationship. We had a mouse
that lived for several weeks with the vipers. While other mice dropped
in the terrarium disappeared within two days, this little brown
Methuselah built itself a nest, stored the grains we gave it in various
hideaways and scampered about in plain sight of the snakes. We were
amazed. We put up a sign to bring the mouse to the public’s attention.
It finally met its end in a curious way: a young viper bit it. Was the
viper unaware of the mouse’s special status? Unsocialized to it,
perhaps? Whatever the case, the mouse was bitten by a young viper but
devoured-and immediately-by an adult. If there was a spell, it was
broken by the young one. Things returned to normal after that. All mice
disappeared down the vipers’ gullets at the usual rate. In the trade,
dogs are sometimes used as foster mothers for lion cubs. Though the cubs
grow to become larger than their caregiver, and far more dangerous, they
never give their mother trouble and she never loses her placid behaviour
or her sense of authority over her litter. Signs have to be put up to
explain to the public that the dog is not live food left for the lions
(just as we had to put up a sign pointing out that rhinoceros are
herbivores and do not eat goats). What could be the explanation for
zoomorphism? Can’t a rhinoceros distinguish big from small, tough hide
from soft fur? Isn’t it plain to a dolphin what a dolphin is like? I
believe the answer lies in something I mentioned earlier, that measure
of madness that moves life in strange but saving ways. The golden
agouti, like the rhinoceros, was in need of companionship. The circus
lions don’t care to know that their leader is a weakling human; the
fiction guarantees their social well-being and staves off violent
anarchy. As for the lion cubs, they would positively keel over with
fright if they knew their mother was a dog, for that would mean they
were motherless, the absolute worst condition imaginable for any young,
warm-blooded life. I’m sure even the adult viper, as it swallowed the
mouse, must have felt somewhere in its undeveloped mind a twinge of
regret, a feeling that something greater was just missed, an imaginative
leap away from the lonely, crude reality of a reptile.</p>
