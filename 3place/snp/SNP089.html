<h4 id="chapter-92">Chapter 92</h4>
<p>I made an exceptional botanical discovery. But there will be many who
disbelieve the following episode. Still, I give it to you now because
it’s part of the story and it happened to me. I was on my side. It was
an hour or two past noon on a day of quiet sunshine and gentle breeze. I
had slept a short while, a diluted sleep that had brought no rest and no
dreams. I turned over to my other side, expending as little energy as
possible in doing so. I opened my eyes. In the near distance I saw
trees. I did not react. I was certain it was an illusion that a few
blinks would make disappear. The trees remained. In fact, they grew to
be a forest. They were part of a low-lying island. I pushed myself up. I
continued to disbelieve my eyes. But it was a thrill to be deluded in
such a high-quality way. The trees were beautiful. They were like none I
had ever seen before. They had a pale bark, and equally distributed
branches that carried an amazing profusion of leaves. These leaves were
brilliantly green, a green so bright and emerald that, next to it,
vegetation during the monsoons was drab olive. I blinked deliberately,
expecting my eyelids to act like lumberjacks. But the trees would not
fall.</p>
<p>I looked down. I was both satisfied and disappointed with what I saw.
The island had no soil. Not that the trees stood in water. Rather, they
stood in what appeared to be a dense mass of vegetation, as sparkling
green as the leaves. Who had ever heard of land with no soil? With trees
growing out of pure vegetation? I felt satisfaction because such a
geology confirmed that I was right, that this island was a chimera, a
play of the mind. By the same token I felt disappointment because an
island, any island, however strange, would have been very good to come
upon. Since the trees continued to stand, I continued to look. To take
in green, after so much blue, was like music to my eyes. Green is a
lovely colour. It is the colour of Islam. It is my favourite colour. The
current gently pushed the lifeboat closer to the illusion. Its shore
could not be called a beach, there being neither sand nor pebbles, and
there was no pounding of surf either, since the waves that fell upon the
island simply vanished into its porosity. From a ridge some three
hundred yards inland, the island sloped to the sea and, forty or so
yards into it, fell off precipitously, disappearing from sight into the
depths of the Pacific, surely the smallest continental shelf on record.
I was getting used to the mental delusion. To make it last I refrained
from putting a strain on it; when the lifeboat nudged the island, I did
not move, only continued to dream. The fabric of the island seemed to be
an intricate, tightly webbed mass of tube-shaped seaweed, in diameter a
little thicker than two fingers. What a fanciful island, I thought.
After some minutes I crept up to the side of the boat. “Look for green,“
said the survival manual. Well, this was green. In fact, it was
chlorophyll heaven. A green to outshine food colouring and flashing neon
lights. A green to get drunk on. “Ultimately, a foot is the only good
judge of land,“ pursued the manual. The island was within reach of a
foot. To judge-and be disappointed-or not to judge, that was the
question. I decided to judge. I looked about to see if there were
sharks. There were none. I turned on my stomach, and holding on to the
tarpaulin, I slowly brought a leg down. My foot entered the sea. It was
pleasingly cool. The island lay just a little further down, shimmering
in the water. I stretched. I expected the bubble of illusion to burst at
any second. It did not. My foot sank into clear water and met the
rubbery resistance of something flexible but solid. I put more weight
down. The illusion would not give. I put my full weight on my foot.
Still I did not sink. Still I did not believe. Finally, it was my nose
that was the judge of land. It came to my olfactory sense, full and
fresh, overwhelming: the smell of vegetation. I gasped. After months of
nothing but salt-water-bleached smells, this reek of vegetable organic
matter was intoxicating. It was then that I believed, and the only thing
that sank was my mind; my thought process became disjointed. My leg
began to shake.</p>
<p>“My God! My God!“ I whimpered. I fell overboard. The combined shock
of solid land and cool water gave me the strength to pull myself forward
onto the island. I babbled incoherent thanks to God and collapsed. But I
could not stay still. I was too excited. I attempted to get to my feet.
Blood rushed away from my head. The ground shook violently. A dizzying
blindness overcame me. I thought I would faint. I steadied myself. All I
seemed able to do was pant. I managed to sit up.</p>
<p>“Richard Parker! Land! Land! We are saved!“ I shouted. The smell of
vegetation was extraordinarily strong. As for the greenness, it was so
fresh and soothing that strength and comfort seemed to be physically
pouring into my system through my eyes. What was this strange, tubular
seaweed, so intricately entangled? Was it edible? It seemed to be a
variety of marine algae, but quite rigid, far more so than normal algae.
The feel of it in the hand was wet and as of something crunchy. I pulled
at it. Strands of it broke off without too much effort. In cross-section
it consisted of two concentric walls: the wet, slightly rough outer
wall, so vibrantly green, and an inner wall midway between the outer
wall and the core of the algae. The division in the two tubes that
resulted was very plain: the centre tube was white in colour, while the
tube that surrounded it was decreasingly green as it approached the
inner wall. I brought a piece of the algae to my nose. Beyond the
agreeable fragrance of the vegetable, it had a neutral smell. I licked
it. My pulse quickened. The algae was wet with fresh water. I bit into
it. My chops were in for a shock. The inner tube was bitterly salty-but
the outer was not only edible, it was delicious. My tongue began to
tremble as if it were a finger flipping through a dictionary, trying to
find a long-forgotten word. It found it, and my eyes closed with
pleasure at hearing it: sweet . Not as in good , but as in sugary .
Turtles and fish are many things, but they are never, ever sugary. The
algae had a light sweetness that outdid in delight even the sap of our
maple trees here in Canada. In consistency, the closest I can compare it
to is water chestnuts. Saliva forcefully oozed through the dry pastiness
of my mouth. Making loud noises of pleasure, I tore at the algae around
me. The inner and outer tubes separated cleanly and easily. I began
stuffing the sweet outer into my mouth. I went at it with both hands,
force-feeding my mouth and setting it to work harder and faster than it
had in a very long time. I ate till there was a regular moat around me.
A solitary tree stood about two hundred feet away. It was the only tree
downhill from the ridge, which seemed a very long way off. I say ridge ;
the word perhaps gives an incorrect impression of how steep the rise
from the shore was. The island was low-lying, as I’ve said. The rise was
gentle, to a height of perhaps fifty or sixty feet. But in the state I
was in, that height loomed like a mountain. The tree was more inviting.
I noticed its patch of shade. I tried to stand again. I managed to get
to a squatting position but as soon as I made to rise, my head spun and
I couldn’t keep my balance. And even if I hadn’t fallen over, my legs
had no strength left in them. But my will was strong. I was determined
to move forward. I crawled, dragged myself, weakly leapfrogged to the
tree. I know I will never know a joy so vast as I experienced when I
entered that tree’s dappled, shimmering shade and heard the dry, crisp
sound of the wind rustling its leaves. The tree was not as large or as
tall as the ones inland, and for being on the wrong side of the ridge,
more exposed to the elements, it was a little scraggly and not so
uniformly developed as its mates. But it was a tree, and a tree is a
blessedly good thing to behold when you’ve been lost at sea for a long,
long time. I sang that tree’s glory, its solid, unhurried purity, its
slow beauty. Oh, that I could be like it, rooted to the ground but with
my every hand raised up to God in praise! I wept. As my heart exalted
Allah, my mind began to take in information about Allah’s works. The
tree did indeed grow right out of the algae, as I had seen from the
lifeboat. There was not the least trace of soil. Either there was soil
deeper down, or this species of tree was a remarkable instance of a
commensal or a parasite. The trunk was about the width of a man’s chest.
The bark was greyish green in colour, thin and smooth, and soft enough
that I could mark it with my fingernail. The cordate leaves were large
and broad, and ended in a single point. The head of the tree had the
lovely full roundness of a mango tree, but it was not a mango. I thought
it smelled somewhat like a lote tree, but it wasn’t a lote either. Nor a
mangrove. Nor any other tree I had ever seen. All I know was that it was
beautiful and green and lush with leaves. I heard a growl. I turned.
Richard Parker was observing me from the lifeboat. He was looking at the
island, too. He seemed to want to come ashore but was afraid. Finally,
after much snarling and pacing, he leapt from the boat. I brought the
orange whistle to my mouth. But he didn’t have aggression on his mind.
Simple balance was enough of a challenge; he was as wobbly on his feet
as I was. When he advanced, he crawled close to the ground and with
trembling limbs, like a newborn cub. Giving me a wide berth, he made for
the ridge and disappeared into the interior of the island. I passed the
day eating, resting, attempting to stand and, in a general way, bathing
in bliss. I felt nauseous when I exerted myself too much. And I kept
feeling that the ground was shifting beneath me and that I was going to
fall over, even when I was sitting still. I started worrying about
Richard Parker in the late afternoon. Now that the setting, the
territory, had changed, I wasn’t sure how he would take to me if he came
upon me. Reluctantly, strictly for safety’s sake, I crawled back to the
lifeboat. However Richard Parker took possession of the island, the bow
and the tarpaulin remained my territory. I searched for something to
moor the lifeboat to. Evidently the algae covered the shore thickly, for
it was all I could find. Finally, I resolved the problem by driving an
oar, handle first, deep into the algae and tethering the boat to it. I
crawled onto the tarpaulin. I was exhausted. My body was spent from
taking in so much food, and there was the nervous tension arising from
my sudden change of fortunes. As the day ended, I hazily remember
hearing Richard Parker roaring in the distance, but sleep overcame me. I
awoke in the night with a strange, uncomfortable feeling in my lower
belly. I thought it was a cramp, that perhaps I had poisoned myself with
the algae. I heard a noise. I looked. Richard Parker was aboard. He had
returned while I was sleeping. He was meowing and licking the pads of
his feet. I found his return puzzling but thought no further about
it-the cramp was quickly getting worse. I was doubled over with pain,
shaking with it, when a process, normal for most but long forgotten by
me, set itself into motion: defecation. It was very painful, but
afterwards I fell into the deepest, most refreshing sleep I had had
since the night before the Tsimtsum sank. When I woke up in the morning
I felt much stronger. I crawled to the solitary tree in a vigorous way.
My eyes feasted once more upon it, as did my stomach on the algae. I had
such a plentiful breakfast that I dug a big hole. Richard Parker once
again hesitated for hours before jumping off the boat. When he did,
mid-morning, as soon as he landed on the shore he jumped back and half
fell in the water and seemed very tense. He hissed and clawed the air
with a paw. It was curious. I had no idea what he was doing. His anxiety
passed, and noticeably surer-footed than the previous day, he
disappeared another time over the ridge. That day, leaning against the
tree, I stood. I felt dizzy. The only way I could make the ground stop
moving was to close my eyes and grip the tree. I pushed off and tried to
walk. I fell instantly. The ground rushed up to me before I could move a
foot. No harm done. The island, coated with such tightly woven, rubbery
vegetation, was an ideal place to relearn how to walk. I could fall any
which way, it was impossible to hurt myself. The next day, after another
restful night on the boat-to which, once again, Richard Parker had
returned-I was able to walk. Falling half a dozen times, I managed to
reach the tree. I could feel my strength increasing by the hour. With
the gaff I reached up and pulled down a branch from the tree. I plucked
off some leaves. They were soft and unwaxed, but they tasted bitter.
Richard Parker was attached to his den on the lifeboat-that was my
explanation for why he had returned another night. I saw him coming back
that evening, as the sun was setting. I had retethered the lifeboat to
the buried oar. I was at the bow, checking that the rope was properly
secured to the stem. He appeared all of a sudden. At first I didn’t
recognize him. This magnificent animal bursting over the ridge at full
gallop couldn’t possibly be the same listless, bedraggled tiger who was
my companion in misfortune? But it was. It was Richard Parker and he was
coming my way at high speed. He looked purposeful. His powerful neck
rose above his lowered head. His coat and his muscles shook at every
step. I could hear the drumming of his heavy body against the ground. I
have read that there are two fears that cannot be trained out of us: the
startle reaction upon hearing an unexpected noise, and vertigo. I would
like to add a third, to wit, the rapid and direct approach of a known
killer. I fumbled for the whistle. When he was twenty-five feet from the
lifeboat I blew into the whistle with all my might. A piercing cry split
the air. It had the desired effect. Richard Parker braked. But he
clearly wanted to move forward again. I blew a second time. He started
turning and hopping on the spot in a most peculiar, deer-like way,
snarling fiercely. I blew a third time. Every hair on him was raised.
His claws were full out. He was in a state of extreme agitation. I
feared that the defensive wall of my whistle blows was about to crumble
and that he would attack me. Instead, Richard Parker did the most
unexpected thing: he jumped into the sea. I was astounded. The very
thing I thought he would never do, he did, and with might and resolve.
He energetically paddled his way to the stern of the lifeboat. I thought
of blowing again, but instead opened the locker lid and sat down,
retreating to the inner sanctum of my territory. He surged onto the
stern, quantities of water pouring off him, making my end of the boat
pitch up. He balanced on the gunnel and the stern bench for a moment,
assessing me. My heart grew faint. I did not think I would be able to
blow into the whistle again. I looked at him blankly. He flowed down to
the floor of the lifeboat and disappeared under the tarpaulin. I could
see parts of him from the edges of the locker lid. I threw myself upon
the tarpaulin, out of his sight-but directly above him. I felt an
overwhelming urge to sprout wings and fly off. I calmed down. I reminded
myself forcefully that this had been my situation for the last long
while, to be living with a live tiger hot beneath me. As my breathing
slowed down, sleep came to me. Sometime during the night I awoke and, my
fear forgotten, looked over. He was dreaming: he was shaking and
growling in his sleep. He was loud enough about it to have woken me up.
In the morning, as usual, he went over the ridge. I decided that as soon
as I was strong enough I would go exploring the inland. It seemed quite
large, if the shoreline was any indication; left and right it stretched
on with only a slight curve, showing the island to have a fair girth. I
spent the day walking-and falling-from the shore to the tree and back,
in an attempt to restore my legs to health. At every fall I had a full
meal of algae. When Richard Parker returned as the day was ending, a
little earlier than the previous day, I was expecting him. I sat tight
and did not blow the whistle. He came to the water’s edge and in one
mighty leap reached the side of the lifeboat. He entered his territory
without intruding into mine, only causing the boat to lurch to one side.
His return to form was quite terrifying. The next morning, after giving
Richard Parker plenty of advance, I set off to explore the island. I
walked up to the ridge. I reached it easily, proudly moving one foot
ahead of the other in a gait that was spirited if still a little
awkward. Had my legs been weaker they would have given way beneath me
when I saw what I saw beyond the ridge. To start with details, I saw
that the whole island was covered with the algae, not just its edges. I
saw a great green plateau with a green forest in its centre. I saw all
around this forest hundreds of evenly scattered, identically sized ponds
with trees sparsely distributed in a uniform way between them, the whole
arrangement giving the unmistakable impression of following a design.
But it was the meerkats that impressed themselves most indelibly on my
mind. I saw in one look what I would conservatively estimate to be
hundreds of thousasands of meerkats. The landscape was covered in
meerkats. And when I appeared, it seamed that all of them turned to me,
astonished, like chickens in a farmyard, and stood up. We didn’t have
any meerkats in our zoo. But I had read about them. They were in the
books and in the literature. A meerkat is a small South African mammal
related to the mongoose; in other words, a carnivorous burrower, a foot
long and weighing two pounds when mature, slender and weasel-like in
build, with a pointed snout, eyes sitting squarely at the front of its
face, short legs, paws with four toes and long, non-retractile claws,
and an eight-inch tail. Its fur is light brown to grey in colour with
black or brown bands on its back, while the tip of its tail, its ears
and the characteristic circles around its eyes are black. It is an agile
and keen-sighted creature, diurnal and social in habits, and feeding in
its native range-the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa-on, among other
things, scorpions, to whose venom it is completely immune. When it is on
the lookout, the meerkat has the peculiarity of standing perfectly
upright on the tips of its back legs, balancing itself tripod-like with
its tail. Often a group of meerkats will take the stance collectively,
standing in a huddle and gazing in the same direction, looking like
commuters waiting for a bus. The earnest expression on their faces, and
the way their front paws hang before them, make them look either like
children self-consciously posing for a photographer or patients in a
doctor’s office stripped naked and demurely trying to cover their
genitals. That is what I beheld in one glance, hundreds of thousands of
meerkats-more, a million-turning to me and standing at attention, as if
saying, “Yes, sir?“ Mind you, a standing meerkat reaches up eighteen
inches at most, so it was not the height of these creatures that was so
breathtaking as their unlimited multitude. I stood rooted to the spot,
speechless. If I set a million meerkats fleeing in terror the chaos
would be indescribable. But their interest in me was shortlived. After a
few seconds, they went back to doing what they had been doing before I
appeared, which was either nibbling at the algae or staring into the
ponds. To see so many beings bending down at the same time reminded me
of prayer time in a mosque. The creatures seemed to feel no fear. As I
moved down from the ridge, none shied away or showed the least tension
at my presence. If I had wanted to, I could have touched one, even
picked one up. I did nothing of the sort. I simply walked into what was
surely the largest colony of meerkats in the world, one of the
strangest, most wonderful experiences of my life. There was a ceaseless
noise in the air. It was their squeaking, chirping, twittering and
barking. Such were their numbers and the vagaries of their excitement
that the noise came and went like a flock of birds, at times very loud,
swirling around me, then rapidly dying off as the closest meerkats fell
silent while others, further off, started up. Were they not afraid of me
because I should be afraid of them? The question crossed my mind. But
the answer-that they were harmless-was immediately apparent. To get
close to a pond, around which they were densely packed, I had to nudge
them away with my feet so as not to step on one. They took to my barging
without any offence, making room for me like a good-natured crowd. I
felt warm, furry bodies against my ankles as I looked into a pond. All
the ponds had the same round shape and were about the same size-roughly
forty feet in diameter. I expected shallowness. I saw nothing but deep,
clear water. The ponds seemed bottomless, in fact. And as far down as I
could see, their sides consisted of green algae. Evidently the layer
atop the island was very substantial. I could see nothing that accounted
for the meerkats’ fixed curiosity, and I might have given up on solving
the mystery had squeaking and barking not erupted at a pond nearby.
Meerkats were jumping up and down in a state of great ferment. Suddenly,
by the hundreds, they began diving into the pond. There was much pushing
and shoving as the meerkats behind vied to reach the pond’s edge. The
frenzy was collective; even tiny meerkittens were making for the water,
barely being held back by mothers and guardians. I stared in disbelief.
These were not standard Kalahari Desert meerkats. Standard Kalahari
Desert meerkats do not behave like frogs. These meerkats were most
definitely a subspecies that had specialized in a fascinating and
surprising way. I made for the pond, bringing my feet down gingerly, in
time to see meerkats swimming-actually swimming-and bringing to shore
fish by the dozens, and not small fish either. Some were dorados that
would have been unqualified feasts on the lifeboat. They dwarfed the
meerkats. It was incomprehensible to me how meerkats could catch such
fish. It was as the meerkats were hauling the fish out of the pond,
displaying real feats of teamwork, that I noticed something curious:
every fish, without exception, was already dead. Freshly dead. The
meerkats were bringing ashore dead fish they had not killed. I kneeled
by the pond, pushing aside several excited, wet meerkats. I touched the
water. It was cooler than I’d expected. There was a current that was
bringing colder water from below. I cupped a little water in my hand and
brought it to my mouth. I took a sip. It was fresh water. This explained
how the fish had died-for, of course, place a saltwater fish in fresh
water and it will quickly become bloated and die. But what were
seafaring fish doing in a freshwater pond? How had they got there? I
went to another pond, making my way through the meerkats. It too was
fresh. Another pond; the same. And again with a fourth pond. They were
all freshwater ponds. Where had such quantities of fresh water come
from, I asked myself. The answer was obvious: from the algae. The algae
naturally and continuously desalinated sea water, which was why its core
was salty while its outer surface was wet with fresh water: it was
oozing the fresh water out. I did not ask myself why the algae did this,
or how, or where the salt went. My mind stopped asking such questions. I
simply laughed and jumped into a pond. I found it hard to stay at the
surface of the water; I was still very weak, and I had little fat on me
to help me float. I held on to the edge of the pond. The effect of
bathing in pure, clean, salt-free water was more than I can put into
words. After such a long time at sea, my skin was like a hide and my
hair was long, matted and as silky as a fly-catching strip. I felt even
my soul had been corroded by salt. So, under the gaze of a thousand
meerkats, I soaked, allowing fresh water to dissolve every salt crystal
that had tainted me. The meerkats looked away. They did it like one man,
all of them turning in the same direction at exactly the same time. I
pulled myself out to see what it was. It was Richard Parker. He
confirmed what I had suspected, that these meerkats had gone for so many
generations without predators that any notion of flight distance, of
flight, of plain fear, had been genetically weeded out of them. He was
moving through them, blazing a trail of murder and mayhem, devouring one
meerkat after another, blood dripping from his mouth, and they, cheek to
jowl with a tiger, were jumping up and down on the spot, as if crying,
“My turn! My turn! My turn!“ I would see this scene time and again.
Nothing distracted the meerkats from their little lives of pond staring
and algae nibbling. Whether Richard Parker skulked up in masterly tiger
fashion before landing upon them in a thunder of roaring, or slouched by
indifferently, it was all the same to them. They were not to be ruffled.
Meekness ruled. He killed beyond his need. He killed meerkats that he
did not eat. In animals, the urge to kill is separate from the urge to
eat. To go for so long without prey and suddenly to have so many-his
pent-up hunting instinct was lashing out with a vengeance. He was far
away. There was no danger to me. At least for the moment. The next
morning, after he had gone, I cleaned the lifeboat. It needed it badly.
I won’t describe what the accumulation of human and animal skeletons,
mixed in with innumerable fish and turtle remains, looked like. The
whole foul, disgusting mess went overboard. I didn’t dare step onto the
floor of the boat for fear of leaving a tangible trace of my presence to
Richard Parker, so the job had to be done with the gaff from the
tarpaulin or from the side of the boat, standing in the water. What I
could not clean up with the gaff-the smells and the smears-I rinsed with
buckets of water. That night he entered his new, clean den without
comment. In his jaws were a number of dead meerkats, which he ate during
the night. I spent the following days eating and drinking and bathing
and observing the meerkats and walking and running and resting and
growing stronger. My running became smooth and unselfconscious, a source
of euphoria. My skin healed. My pains and aches left me. Put simply, I
returned to life. I explored the island. I tried to walk around it but
gave up. I estimate that it was about six or seven miles in diameter,
which means a circumference of about twenty miles. What I saw seemed to
indicate that the shore was unvarying in its features. The same blinding
greenness throughout, the same ridge, the same incline from ridge to
water, the same break in the monotony: a scraggly tree here and there.
Exploring the shore revealed one extraordinary thing: the algae, and
therefore the island itself, varied in height and density depending on
the weather. On very hot days, the algae’s weave became tight and dense,
and the island increased in height; the climb to the ridge became
steeper and the ridge higher. It was not a quick process. Only a hot
spell lasting several days triggered it. But it was unmistakable. I
believe it had to do with water conservation, with exposing less of the
algae’s surface to the sun’s rays. The converse phenomenon-the loosening
of the island-was faster, more dramatic, and the reasons for it more
evident. At such times the ridge came down, and the continental shelf,
so to speak, stretched out, and the algae along the shore became so
slack that I tended to catch my feet in it. This loosening was brought
on by overcast weather and, faster still, by heavy seas. I lived through
a major storm while on the island, and after the experience, I would
have trusted staying on it during the worst hurricane. It was an
awe-inspiring spectacle to sit in a tree and see giant waves charging
the island, seemingly preparing to ride up the ridge and unleash bedlam
and chaos-only to see each one melt away as if it had come upon
quicksand. In this respect, the island was Gandhian: it resisted by not
resisting. Every wave vanished into the island without a clash, with
only a little frothing and foaming. A tremor shaking the ground and
ripples wrinkling the surface of the ponds were the only indications
that some great force was passing through. And pass through it did: in
the lee of the island, considerably diminished, waves emerged and went
on their way. It was the strangest sight, that, to see waves leaving a
shoreline. The storm, and the resulting minor earthquakes, did not
perturb the meerkats in the least. They went about their business as if
the elements did not exist. Harder to understand was the island’s
complete desolation. I never saw such a stripped-down ecology. The air
of the place carried no flies, no butterflies, no bees, no insects of
any kind. The trees sheltered no birds. The plains hid no rodents, no
grubs, no worms, no snakes, no scorpions; they gave rise to no other
trees, no shrubs, no grasses, no flowers. The ponds harboured no
freshwater fish. The seashore teemed with no weeds, no crabs, no
crayfish, no coral, no pebbles, no rocks. With the single, notable
exception of the meerkats, there was not the least foreign matter on the
island, organic or inorganic. It was nothing but shining green algae and
shining green trees. The trees were not parasites. I discovered this one
day when I ate so much algae at the base of a small tree that I exposed
its roots. I saw that the roots did not go their own independent way
into the algae, but rather joined it, became it. Which meant that these
trees either lived in a symbiotic relationship with the algae, in a
giving-and-taking that was to their mutual advantage, or, simpler still,
were an integral part of the algae. I would guess that the latter was
the case because the trees did not seem to bear flowers or fruit. I
doubt that an independent organism, however intimate the symbiosis it
has entered upon, would give up on so essential a part of life as
reproduction. The leaves’ appetite for the sun, as testified by their
abundance, their breadth and their super-chlorophyll greenness, made me
suspect that the trees had primarily an energy-gathering function. But
this is conjecture. There is one last observation I would like to make.
It is based on intuition rather than hard evidence. It is this: that the
island was not an island in the conventional sense of the term-that is,
a small landmass rooted to the floor of the ocean-but was rather a
free-floating organism, a ball of algae of leviathan proportions. And it
is my hunch that the ponds reached down to the sides of this huge,
buoyant mass and opened onto the ocean, which explained the otherwise
inexplicable presence in them of dorados and other fish of the open
seas. It would all bear much further study, but unfortunately I lost the
algae that I took away. Just as I returned to life, so did Richard
Parker. By dint of stuffing himself with meerkats, his weight went up,
his fur began to glisten again, and he returned to his healthy look of
old. He kept up his habit of returning to the lifeboat at the end of
every day. I always made sure I was there before him, copiously marking
my territory with urine so that he didn’t forget who was who and what
was whose. But he left at first light and roamed further afield than I
did; the island being the same all over, I generally stayed within one
area. I saw very little of him during the day. And I grew nervous. I saw
how he raked the trees with his forepaws-great deep gouges in the
trunks, they were. And I began to hear his hoarse roaring, that aaonh
cry as rich as gold or honey and as spine-chilling as the depths of an
unsafe mine or a thousand angry bees. That he was searching for a female
was not in itself what troubled me; it was that it meant he was
comfortable enough on the island to be thinking about producing young. I
worried that in this new condition he might not tolerate another male in
his territory, his night territory in particular, especially if his
insistent cries went unanswered, as surely they would. One day I was on
a walk in the forest. I was walking vigorously, caught up in my own
thoughts. I passed a tree-and practically ran into Richard Parker. Both
of us were startled. He hissed and reared up on his hind legs, towering
over me, his great paws ready to swat me down. I stood frozen to the
spot, paralyzed with fear and shock. He dropped back on all fours and
moved away. When he had gone three, four paces, he turned and reared up
again, growling this time. I continued to stand like a statue. He went
another few paces and repeated the threat a third time. Satisfied that I
was not a menace, he ambled off. As soon as I had caught my breath and
stopped trembling, I brought the whistle to my mouth and started running
after him. He had already gone a good distance, but he was still within
sight. My running was powerful. He turned, saw me, crouched-and then
bolted. I blew into the whistle as hard as I could, wishing that its
sound would travel as far and wide as the cry of a lonely tiger. That
night, as he was resting two feet beneath me, I came to the conclusion
that I had to step into the circus ring again. The major difficulty in
training animals is that they operate either by instinct or by rote. The
shortcut of intelligence to make new associations that are not
instinctive is minimally available. Therefore, imprinting in an animal’s
mind the artificial connection that if it does a certain action, say,
roll over, it will get a treat can be achieved only by mind-numbing
repetition. It is a slow process that depends as much on luck as on hard
work, all the more so when the animal is an adult. I blew into the
whistle till my lungs hurt. I pounded my chest till it was covered with
bruises. I shouted “Hep! Hep! Hep!“-my tiger-language command to say
“Do!“-thousands of times. I tossed hundreds of meerkat morsels at him
that I would gladly have eaten myself. The training of tigers is no easy
feat. They are considerably less flexible in their mental make-up than
other animals that are commonly trained in circuses and zoos-sea lions
and chimpanzees, for example. But I don’t want to take too much credit
for what I managed to do with Richard Parker. My good fortune, the
fortune that saved my life, was that he was not only a young adult but a
pliable young adult, an omega animal. I was afraid that conditions on
the island might play against me, that with such an abundance of food
and water and so much space he might become relaxed and confident, less
open to my influence. But he remained tense. I knew him well enough to
sense it. At night in the lifeboat he was unsettled and noisy. I
assigned this tension to the new environment of the island; any change,
even positive, will make an animal tense. Whatever the cause, the strain
he was under meant that he continued to show a readiness to oblige;
more, that he felt a need to oblige. I trained him to jump through a
hoop I made with thin branches. It was a simple routine of four jumps.
Each one earned him part of a meerkat. As he lumbered towards me, I
first held the hoop at the end of my left arm, some three feet off the
ground. When he had leapt through it, and as he finished his run, I took
hold of the hoop with my right hand and, my back to him, commanded him
to return and leap through it again. For the third jump I knelt on the
ground and held the hoop over my head. It was a nerve-racking experience
to see him come my way. I never lost the fear that he would not jump but
attack me. Thankfully, he jumped every time. After which I got up and
tossed the hoop so that it rolled like a wheel. Richard Parker was
supposed to follow it and go through it one last time before it fell
over. He was never very good at this last part of the act, either
because I failed to throw the hoop properly or because he clumsily ran
into it. But at least he followed it, which meant he got away from me.
He was always filled with amazement when the hoop fell over. He would
look at it intently, as if it were some great fellow animal he had been
running with that had collapsed unexpectedly. He would stay next to it,
sniffing it. I would throw him his last treat and move away. Eventually
I quit the boat. It seemed absurd to spend my nights in such cramped
quarters with an animal who was becoming roomy in his needs, when I
could have an entire island. I decided the safe thing to do would be to
sleep in a tree. Richard Parker’s nocturnal practice of sleeping in the
lifeboat was never a law in my mind. It would not be a good idea for me
to be outside my territory, sleeping and defenceless on the ground, the
one time he decided to go for a midnight stroll. So one day I left the
boat with the net, a rope and some blankets. I sought out a handsome
tree on the edge of the forest and threw the rope over the lowest
branch. My fitness was such that I had no problem pulling myself up by
my arms and climbing the tree. I found two solid branches that were
level and close together, and I tied the net to them. I returned at the
end of the day. I had just finished folding the blankets to make my
mattress when I detected a commotion among the meerkats. I looked. I
pushed aside branches to see better. I looked in every direction and as
far as the horizon. It was unmistakable. The meerkats were abandoning
the ponds-indeed, the whole plain-and rapidly making for the forest. An
entire nation of meerkats was on the move, their backs arched and their
feet a blur. I was wondering what further surprise these animals held in
store for me when I noticed with consternation that the ones from the
pond closest to me had surrounded my tree and were climbing up the
trunk. The trunk was disappearing under a wave of determined meerkats. I
thought they were coming to attack me, that here was the reason why
Richard Parker slept in the lifeboat: during the day the meerkats were
docile and harmless, but at night, under their collective weight, they
crushed their enemies ruthlessly. I was both afraid and indignant. To
survive for so long in a lifeboat with a 450-pound Bengal tiger only to
die up a tree at the hands of two-pound meerkats struck me as a tragedy
too unfair and too ridiculous to bear. They meant me no harm. They
climbed up to me, over me, about me-and past me. They settled upon every
branch in the tree. It became laden with them. They even took over my
bed. And the same as far as the eye could see. They were climbing every
tree in sight. The entire forest was turning brown, an autumn that came
in a few minutes. Collectively, as they scampered by in droves to claim
empty trees deeper into the forest, they made more noise than a
stampeding herd of elephants. The plain, meanwhile, was becoming bare
and depopulated. From a bunk bed with a tiger to an overcrowded
dormitory with meerkats-will I be believed when I say that life can take
the most surprising turns? I jostled with meerkats so that I could have
a place in my own bed. They snuggled up to me. Not a square inch of
space was left free. They settled down and stopped squeaking and
chirping. Silence came to the tree. We fell asleep. I woke up at dawn
covered from head to toe in a living fur blanket. Some meerkittens had
discovered the warmer parts of my body. I had a tight, sweaty collar of
them around my neck-and it must have been their mother who had settled
herself so contentedly on the side of my head-while others had wedged
themselves in my groin area. They left the tree as briskly and as
unceremoniously as they had invaded it. It was the same with every tree
around. The plain grew thick with meerkats, and the noises of their day
started filling the air. The tree looked empty. And I felt empty, a
little. I had liked the experience of sleeping with the meerkats. I
began to sleep in the tree every night. I emptied the lifeboat of useful
items and made myself a nice treetop bedroom. I got used to the
unintentional scratches I received from meerkats climbing over me. My
only complaint would be that animals higher up occasionally relieved
themselves on me. One night the meerkats woke me up. They were
chattering and shaking. I sat up and looked in the direction they were
looking. The sky was cloudless and the moon full. The land was robbed of
its colour. Everything glowed strangely in shades of black, grey and
white. It was the pond. Silver shapes were moving in it, emerging from
below and breaking the black surface of the water. Fish. Dead fish. They
were floatimg up from deep down. The pond-remember, forty feet
across-was filling up with all kinds of dead fish until its surface was
no longer black but silver. And from the way the surface kept on being
disturbed, it was evident that more dead fish were coming up.</p>
<p>By the time a dead shark quietly appeared, the meerkats were in a
fury of excitement, shrieking like tropical birds. The hysteria spread
to the neighbouring trees. It was deafening. I wondered whether I was
about to see the sight of fish being hauled up trees. Not a single
meerkat went down to the pond. None even made the first motions of going
down. They did no more than loudly express their frustration. I found
the sight sinister. There was something disturbing about all those dead
fish. I lay down again and fought to go back to sleep over the meerkats’
racket. At first light I was stirred from my slumber by the hullabaloo
they made trooping down the tree. Yawning and stretching, I looked down
at the pond that had been the source of such fire and fluster the
previous night. It was empty. Or nearly. But it wasn’t the work of the
meerkats. They were just now diving in to get what was left. The fish
had disappeared. I was confounded. Was I looking at the wrong pond? No,
for sure it was that one. Was I certain it was not the meerkats that had
emptied it? Absolutely. I could hardly see them heaving an entire shark
out of water, let alone carrying it on their backs and disappearing with
it. Could it be Richard Parker? Possibly in part, but not an entire pond
in one night. It was a complete mystery. No amount of staring into the
pond and at its deep green walls could explain to me what had happened
to the fish. The next night I looked, but no new fish came into the
pond. The answer to the mystery came sometime later, from deep within
the forest. The trees were larger in the centre of the forest and
closely set. It remained clear below, there being no underbrush of any
kind, but overhead the canopy was so dense that the sky was quite
blocked off, or, another way of putting it, the sky was solidly green.
The trees were so near one another that their branches grew into each
other’s spaces; they touched and twisted around each other so that it
was hard to tell where one tree ended and the next began. I noted that
they had clean, smooth trunks, with none of the countless tiny marks on
their bark made by climbing meerkats. I easily guessed the reason why:
the meerkats could travel from one tree to another without the need to
climb up and down. I found, as proof of this, many trees on the
perimeter of the heart of the forest whose bark had been practically
shredded. These trees were without a doubt the gates into a meerkat
arboreal city with more bustle in it than Calcutta. It was here that I
found the tree. It wasn’t the largest in the forest, or in its dead
centre, or remarkable in any other way. It had good level branches,
that’s all. It would have made an excellent spot from which to see the
sky or take in the meerkats’ nightlife. I can tell you exacctly what day
I came upon the tree: it was the day before I left the island. I noticed
the tree because it seemed to have fruit. Whereas elsewhere the forest
canopy was uniformly green, these fruit stood out black against green.
The branches holding them were twisted in odd ways. I looked intently.
An entire island covered in barren trees but for one. And not even all
of one. The fruit grew from only one small part of the tree. I thought
that perhaps I had come upon the forest equivalent of a queen bee, and I
wondered whether this algae would ever cease to amaze me with its
botainical strangeness. I wanted to try the fruit, but the tree was too
high. So I returned with a rope. If the algae was delicious, what would
its fruit be like? I looped the rope; around the lowest limb of the tree
and, bough by bough, branch by branch, made my way to the small,
preciouis orchard. Up, close the fruit were dull green. They were about
the size and shape of oranges. Each was at the centre of a number of
twigs that were tightly curled around it-to protect it, I supposed. As I
got closer, I could see another purpose to these curled twigs: support.
The fruit had not one stem, but dozens. Their surfaces were studded with
stems that connected them to the surrounding twigs. These fruit must
surely be heavy and juicy, I thought. I got close. I reached with a hand
and took hold of one. I was disappointed at how light it felt. It
weighed hardly anything. I pulled at it, plucking it from all its stems.
I made myself comfortable on a sturdy branch, my back to the trunk of
the tree. Above me stood a shifting roof of green leaves that let in
shafts of sunlight. All round, for as far as I could see, hanging in the
air, were the twisting and turning roads of a great suspended city. A
pleasant breeze ran through the trees. I was keenly curious. I examined
the fruit. Ah, how I wish that moment had never been! But for it I might
have lived for years-why, for the rest of my life-on that island.
Nothing, I thought, could ever push me to return to the lifeboat and to
the suffering and deprivation I had endured on it-nothing! What reason
could I have to leave the island? Were my physical needs not met here?
Was there not more fresh water than I could drink in all my lifetime?
More algae than I could eat? And when I yearned for variety, more
meerkats and fish than I could ever desire? If the island floated and
moved, might it not move in the right direction? Might it not turn out
to be a vegetable ship that brought me to land? In the meantime, did I
not have these delightful meerkats to keep me company? And wastn’t
Richard Parker still in need of improving his fourth jump? The thought
of leaving the island had not crossed my mind once since I had arrived.
It had been many weeks now-I couldn’t say how many exactly-and they
would stretch on. I was certain about that. How wrong I was. If that
fruit had a seed, it was the seed of my departure. The fruit was not a
fruit. It was a dense accumulation of leaves glued together in a ball.
The dozens of stems were dozens of leaf stems. Each stem that I pulled
caused a leaf to peel off. After a few layers I came to leaves that had
lost their stems and were flatly glued to the ball. I used my
fingernails to catch their edges and pull them off. Sheath after sheath
of leaf lifted, like the skins off an onion. I could simply have ripped
the “fruit“ apart-I still call it that for lack of a better word-but I
chose to satisfy my curiosity in a measured way. It shrunk from the size
of an orange to that of a mandarin. My lap and the branches below were
covered with thin, soft leaf peelings. It was now the size of a
rambutan. I still get shivers in my spine when I think of it. The size
of a cherry. And then it came to light, an unspeakable pearl at the
heart of a green oyster. A human tooth. A molar, to be exact. The
surface stained green and finely pierced with holes. The feeling of
horror came slowly. I had time to pick at the other fruit. Each
contained a tooth. One a canine. Another a premolar. Here an incisor.
There another molar. Thirty-two teeth. A complete human set. Not one
tooth missing. Understanding dawned upon me. I did not scream. I think
only in movies is horror vocal. I simply shuddered and left the tree. I
spent the day in turmoil, weighing my options. They were all bad. That
night, in bed in my usual tree, I tested my conclusion. I took hold of a
meerkat and dropped it from the branch. It squeaked as it fell through
the air. When it touched the ground, it instantly made for the tree.</p>
<p>With typical innocence it returned to the spot right next to me.
There it began to lick its paws vigorously. It seemed much discomforted.
It panted heavily. I could have left it at that. But I wanted to know
for myself. I climbed down and took hold of the rope. I had made knots
in it to make my climbing easier. When I was at the bottom of the tree,
I brought my feet to within an inch of the ground. I hesitated. I let
go. At first I felt nothing. Suddenly a searing pain shot up through my
feet. I shrieked. I thought I would fall over. I managed to take hold of
the rope and pull myself off the ground. I frantically rubbed the soles
of my feet against the tree trunk. It helped, but not enough. I climbed
back to my branch. I soaked my feet in the bucket of water next to my
bed. I wiped my feet with leaves. I took the knife and killed two
meerkats and tried to soothe the pain with their blood and innards.
Still my feet burned. They burned all night. I couldn’t sleep for it,
and from the anxiety. The island was carnivorous. This explained the
disappearance of the fish in the pond. The island attracted saltwater
fish into its subterranean tunnels-how, I don’t know; perhaps fish ate
the algae as gluttonously as I did. They became trapped. Did they lose
their way? Did the openings onto the sea close off? Did the water change
salinity so subtly that it was too late by the time the fish realized
it? Whatever the case, they found themselves trapped in fresh water and
died. Some floated up to the surface of the ponds, the scraps that fed
the meerkats. At night, by some chemical process unknown to me but
obviously inhibited by sunlight, the predatory algae turned highly
acidic and the ponds became vats of acid that digested the fish. This
was why Richard Parker returned to the boat every night. This was why
the meerkats slept in the trees. This was why I had never seen anything
but algae on the island. And this explained the teeth. Some poor lost
soul had arrived on these terrible shores before me. How much time had
he-or was it she?-spent here? Weeks? Months? Years ? How many forlorn
hours in the arboreal city with only meerkats for company? How many
dreams of a happy life dashed? How much hope come to nothing? How much
stored-up conversation that died unsaid? How much loneliness endured?
How much hopelessness taken on? And after all that, what of it? What to
show for it? Nothing but some enamel, like small change in a pocket. The
person must have died in the tree. Was it illness? Injury? Depression?
How long does it take for a broken spirit to kill a body that has food,
water and shelter? The trees were carnivorous too, but at a much lower
level of acidity, safe enough to stay in for the night while the rest of
the island seethed. But once the person had died and stopped moving, the
tree must have slowly wrapped itself around the body and digested it,
the very bones leached of nutrients until they vanished. In time, even
the teeth would have disappeared. I looked around at the algae.
Bitterness welled up in me. The radiant promise it offered during the
day was replaced in my heart by all the treachery it delivered at night.
I muttered, “Nothing but teeth left! Teeth! “</p>
<p>By the time morning came, my grim decision was taken. I preferred to
set off and perish in search of my own kind than to live a lonely
half-life of physical comfort and spiritual death on this murderous
island. I filled my stores with fresh water and I drank like a camel. I
ate algae throughout the day until my stomach could take no more. I
killed and skinned as many meerkats as would fit in the locker and on
the floor of the lifeboat. I reaped dead fish from the ponds. With the
hatchet I hacked off a large mass of algae and worked a rope through it,
which I tied to the boat. I could not abandon Richard Parker. To leave
him would mean to kill him. He would not survive the first night. Alone
in my lifeboat at sunset I would know that he was burning alive. Or that
he had thrown himself in the sea, where he would drown. I waited for his
return. I knew he would not be late. When he was aboard, I pushed us
off. For a few hours the currents kept us near the island. The noises of
the sea bothered me. And I was no longer used to the rocking motions of
the boat. The night went by slowly. In the morning the island was gone,
as was the mass of algae we had been towing. As soon as night had
fallen, the algae had dissolved the rope with its acid. The sea was
heavy, the sky grey.</p>
