<h4 id="chapter-45">Chapter 45</h4>
<p>I was cold. It was a distracted observation, as if it didn’t concern
me. Daybreak came. It happened quickly, yet by imperceptible degrees. A
corner of the sky changed colours. The air began filling with light. The
calm sea opened up around me like a great book. Still it felt like
night. Suddenly it was day. Warmth came only when the sun, looking like
an electrically lit orange, broke across the horizon, but I didn’t need
to wait that long to feel it. With the very first rays of light it came
alive in me: hope. As things emerged in outline and filled with colour,
hope increased until it was like a song in my heart. Oh, what it was to
bask in it! Things would work out yet. The worst was over. I had
survived the night. Today I would be rescued. To think that, to string
those words together in my mind, was itself a source of hope. Hope fed
on hope. As the horizon became a neat, sharp line, I scanned it eagerly.
The day was clear again and visibility was perfect. I imagined Ravi
would greet me first and with a tease. “What’s this?“ he would say. “You
find yourself a great big lifeboat and you fill it with animals? You
think you’re Noah or something?“ Father would be unshaven and
dishevelled. Mother would look to the sky and take me in her arms. I
went through a dozen versions of what it was going to be like on the
rescue ship, variations on the theme of sweet reunion. That morning the
horizon might curve one way, my lips resolutely curved the other, in a
smile. Strange as it might sound, it was only after a long time that I
looked to see what was happening in the lifeboat. The hyena had attacked
the zebra. Its mouth was bright red and it was chewing on a piece of
hide. My eyes automatically searched for the wound, for the area under
attack. I gasped with horror. The zebra’s broken leg was missing. The
hyena had bitten it off and dragged it to the stern, behind the zebra. A
flap of skin hung limply over the raw stump. Blood was still dripping.
The victim bore its suffering patiently, without showy remonstrations. A
slow and constant grinding of its teeth was the only visible sign of
distress. Shock, revulsion and anger surged through me. I felt intense
hatred for the hyena. I thought of doing something to kill it. But I did
nothing. And my outrage was short-lived. I must be honest about that. I
didn’t have pity to spare for long for the zebra. When your own life is
threatened, your sense of empathy is blunted by a terrible, selfish
hunger for survival. It was sad that it was suffering so much-and being
such a big, strapping creature it wasn’t at the end of its ordeal- but
there was nothing I could do about it. I felt pity and then I moved on.
This is not something I am proud of. I am sorry I was so callous about
the matter. I have not forgotten that poor zebra and what it went
through. Not a prayer goes by that I don’t think of it. There was still
no sign of Orange Juice. I turned my eyes to the horizon again. That
afternoon the wind picked up a little and I noticed something about the
lifeboat: despite its weight, it floated lightly on the water, no doubt
because it was carrying less than its capacity. We had plenty of
freeboard, the distance between the water and the gunnel; it would take
a mean sea to swamp us. But it also meant that whatever end of the boat
was facing the wind tended to fall away, bringing us broadside to the
waves. With small waves the result was a ceaseless, fist-like beating
against the hull, while larger waves made for a tiresome rolling of the
boat as it leaned from side to side. This jerky and incessant motion was
making me feel queasy. Perhaps I would feel better in a new position. I
slid down the oar and shifted back onto the bow. I sat facing the waves,
with the rest of the boat to my left. I was closer to the hyena, but it
wasn’t stirring. It was as I was breathing deeply and concentrating on
making my nausea go away that I saw Orange Juice. I had imagined her
completely out of sight, near the bow beneath the tarpaulin, as far from
the hyena as she could get. Not so. She was on the side bench, just
beyond the edge of the hyena’s indoor track and barely hidden from me by
the bulge of rolled-up tarpaulin. She lifted her head only an inch or so
and right away I saw her. Curiosity got the best of me. I had to see her
better. Despite the rolling of the boat I brought myself to a kneeling
position. The hyena looked at me, but did not move. Orange Juice came
into sight. She was deeply slouched and holding on to the gunnel with
both her hands, her head sunk very low between her arms. Her mouth was
open and her tongue was lolling about. She was visibly panting. Despite
the tragedy afflicting me, despite not feeling well, I let out a laugh.
Everything about Orange Juice at that moment spelled one word:
seasickness . The image of a new species popped into my head: the rare
seafaring green orang-utan. I returned to my sitting position. The poor
dear looked so humanly sick! It is a particularly funny thing to read
human traits in animals, especially in apes and monkeys, where it is so
easy. Simians are the clearest mirrors we have in the animal world. That
is why they are so popular in zoos. I laughed again. I brought my hands
to my chest, surprised at how I felt. Oh my. This laughter was like a
volcano of happiness erupting in me. And Orange Juice had not only
cheered me up; she had also taken on both our feelings of seasickness. I
was feeling fine now. I returned to scrutinizing the horizon, my hopes
high. Besides being deathly seasick, there was something else about
Orange Juice that was remarkable: she was uninjured. And she had her
back turned to the hyena, as if she felt she could safely ignore it. The
ecosystem on this lifeboat was decidedly baffling. Since there are no
natural conditions in which a spotted hyena and an orangutan can meet,
there being none of the first in Borneo and none of the second in
Africa, there is no way of knowing how they would relate. But it seemed
to me highly improbable, if not totally incredible, that when brought
together these frugivorous tree-dwellers and carnivorous
savannah-dwellers would so radically carve out their niches as to pay no
attention to each other. Surely an orang-utan would smell of prey to a
hyena, albeit a strange one, one to be remembered afterwards for
producing stupendous hairballs, nonetheless better-tasting than an
exhaust pipe and well worth looking out for when near trees. And surely
a hyena would smell of a predator to an orangutan, a reason for being
vigilant when a piece of durian has been dropped to the ground
accidentally. But nature forever holds surprises. Perhaps it was not so.
If goats could be brought to live amicably with rhinoceros, why not
orang-utans with hyenas? That would be a big winner at a zoo. A sign
would have to be put up. I could see it already: “Dear Public, Do not be
afraid for the orang-utans! They are in the trees because that is where
they live, not because they are afraid of the spotted hyenas. Come back
at mealtime, or at sunset when they get thirsty, and you will see them
climbing down from their trees and moving about the grounds, absolutely
unmolested by the hyenas.“ Father would be fascinated. Sometime that
afternoon I saw the first specimen of what would become a dear, reliable
friend of mine. There was a bumping and scraping sound against the hull
of the lifeboat. A few seconds later, so close to the boat I could have
leaned down and grabbed it, a large sea turtle appeared, a hawksbill,
flippers lazily turning, head sticking out of the water. It was
striking-looking in an ugly sort of way, with a rugged, yellowish brown
shell about three feet long and spotted with patches of algae, and a
dark green face with a sharp beak, no lips, two solid holes for
nostrils, and black eyes that stared at me intently. The expression was
haughty and severe, like that of an ill-tempered old man who has
complaining on his mind. The queerest thing about the reptile was simply
that it was. It looked incongruous, floating there in the water, so odd
in its shape compared to the sleek, slippery design of fish. Yet it was
plainly in its element and it was I who was the odd one out. It hovered
by the boat for several minutes. I said to it, “Go tell a ship I’m here.
Go, go.“ It turned and sank out of sight, back flippers pushing water in
alternate strokes.</p>
