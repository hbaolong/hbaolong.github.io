<h4 id="chapter-34">Chapter 34</h4>
<p>Father said, “We’ll sail like Columbus!“</p>
<p>“He was hoping to find India,“ I pointed out sullenly. We sold the
zoo, lock, stock and barrel. To a new country, a new life. Besides
assuring our collection of a happy future, the transaction would pay for
our immigration and leave us with a good sum to make a fresh start in
Canada (though now, when I think of it, the sum is laughable-how blinded
we are by money). We could have sold our animals to zoos in India, but
American zoos were willing to pay higher prices. CITES , the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species, had just come into effect,
and the Window on the trading of captured wild animals had slammed shut.
The future of zoos would now lie with other zoos. The Pondicherry Zoo
closed shop at just the right time. There was a scramble to buy our
animals. The final buyers were a number of zoos, mainly the Lincoln Park
Zoo in Chicago and the soon-to-open Minnesota Zoo, but odd animals were
going to Los Angeles, Louisville, Oklahoma City and Cincinnati. And two
animals were being shipped to the Canada Zoo. That’s how Ravi and I
felt. We did not want to go. We did not want to live in a country of
gale-force winds and minus-two-hundred-degree winters. Canada was not on
the cricket map. Departure was made easier-as far as getting us used to
the idea-by the time it took for all the pre-departure preparations. It
took well over a year. I don’t mean for us. I mean for the animals.
Considering that animals dispense with clothes, footwear, linen,
furniture, kitchenware, toiletries; that nationality means nothing to
them; that they care not a jot for passports, money, employment
prospects, schools, cost of housing, healthcare facilities-considering,
in short, their lightness of being, it’s amazing how hard it is to move
them. Moving a zoo is like moving a city. The paperwork was colossal.
Litres of water used up in the wetting of stamps. Dear Mr. So-and-so
written hundreds of times. Offers made. Sighs heard. Doubts expressed.
Haggling gone through. Decisions sent higher up for approval. Prices
agreed upon. Deals clinched. Dotted lines signed. Congratulations given.
Certificates of origin sought. Certificates of health sought. Export
permits sought. Import permits sought. Quarantine regulations clarified.
Transportation organized. A fortune spent on telephone calls. It’s a
joke in the zoo business, a weary joke, that the paperwork involved in
trading a shrew weighs more than an elephant, that the paperwork
involved in trading an elephant weighs more than a whale, and that you
must never try to trade a whale, never. There seemed to be a single file
of nit-picking bureaucrats from Pondicherry to Minneapolis via Delhi and
Washington, each with his form, his problem, his hesitation. Shipping
the animals to the moon couldn’t possibly have been more complicated.
Father pulled nearly every hair off his head and came close to giving up
on a number of occasions. There were surprises. Most of our birds and
reptiles, and our lemurs, rhinos, orang-utans, mandrills, lion-tailed
macaques, giraffes, anteaters, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas,
zebras, Himalayan and sloth bears, Indian elephants and Nilgiri tahrs,
among others, were in demand, but others, Elfie for example, were met
with silence. “A cataract operation!“ Father shouted, waving the letter.
“They’ll take her if we do a cataract operation on her right eye. On a
hippopotamus! What next? Nose jobs on the rhinos?“ Some of our other
animals were considered “too common,“ the lions and baboons, for
example. Father judiciously traded these for an extra orang-utan from
the Mysore Zoo and a chimpanzee from the Manila Zoo. (As for Elfie, she
lived out the rest of her days at the Trivandrum Zoo.) One zoo asked for
“an authentic Brahmin cow“ for their children’s zoo. Father walked out
into the urban jungle of Pondicherry and bought a cow with dark wet
eyes, a nice fat hump and horns so straight and at such right angles to
its head that it looked as if it had licked an electrical outlet. Father
had its horns painted bright orange and little plastic bells fitted to
the tips, for added authenticity. A deputation of three Americans came.
I was very curious. I had never seen real live Americans. They were
pink, fat, friendly, very competent and sweated profusely. They examined
our animals. They put most of them to sleep and then applied
stethoscopes to hearts, examined urine and feces as if horoscopes, drew
blood in syringes and analyzed it, fondled humps and bumps, tapped
teeth, blinded eyes with flashlights, pinched skins, stroked and pulled
hairs. Poor animals. They must have thought they were being drafted into
the U.S. Army. We got big smiles from the Americans and bone-crushing,
handshakes. The result was that the animals, like us, got their working
papers. They were future Yankees, and we, future Canucks.</p>
