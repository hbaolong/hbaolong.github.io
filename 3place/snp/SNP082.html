<h4 id="chapter-84">Chapter 84</h4>
<p>I was on the tarpaulin, wrapped in a blanket, sleeping and dreaming
and awakening and daydreaming and generally passing the time. There was
a steady breeze. From time to time spray was blown off the crest of a
wave and wet the boat. Richard Parker had disappeared under the
tarpaulin. He liked neither getting wet nor the ups and downs of the
boat. But the sky was blue, the air was warm, and the sea was regular in
its motion. I awoke because there was a blast. I opened my eyes and saw
water in the sky. It crashed down on me. I looked up again. Cloudless
blue sky. There was another blast, to my left, not as powerful as the
first. Richard Parker growled fiercely. More water crashed against me.
It had an unpleasant smell. I looked over the edge of the boat. The
first thing I saw was a large black object floating in the water. It
took me a few seconds to understand what it was. An arching wrinkle
around its edge was my clue. It was an eye. It was a whale. Its eye, the
size of my head, was looking directly at me. Richard Parker came up from
beneath the tarpaulin. He hissed. I sensed from a slight change in the
glint of the whale’s eye that it was now looking at Richard Parker. It
gazed for thirty seconds or so before gently sinking under. I worried
that it might strike us with its tail, but it went straight down and
vanished in the dark blue. Its tail was a huge, fading, round bracket. I
believe it was a whale looking for a mate. It must have decided that my
size wouldn’t do, and besides, I already seemed to have a mate. We saw a
number of whales but none so close up as that first one. I would be
alerted to their presence by their spouting. They would emerge a short
distance away, sometimes three or four of them, a short-lived
archipelago of volcanic islands. These gentle behemoths always lifted my
spirits. I was convinced that they understood my condition, that at the
sight of me one of them exclaimed, “Oh! It’s that castaway with the
pussy cat Bamphoo was telling me about. Poor boy. Hope he has enough
plankton. I must tell Mumphoo and Tomphoo and Stimphoo about him. I
wonder if there isn’t a ship around I could alert. His mother would be
very happy to see him again. Goodbye, my boy. I’ll try to help. My
name’s Pimphoo.“ And so, through the grapevine, every whale of the
Pacific knew of me, and I would have been saved long ago if Pimphoo
hadn’t sought help from a Japanese ship whose dastardly crew harpooned
her, the same fate as befell Lamphoo at the hands of a Norwegian ship.
The hunting of whales is a heinous crime. Dolphins were fairly regular
visitors. One group stayed with us a whole day and night. They were very
gay. Their plunging and turning and racing just beneath the hull seemed
to have no purpose other than sporting fun. I tried to catch one. But
none came close to the gaff. And even if one had, they were too fast and
too big. I gave up and just watched them. I saw six birds in all. I took
each one to be an angel announcing nearby land. But these were seafaring
birds that could span the Pacific with hardly a flutter of the wings. I
watched them with awe and envy and self-pity. Twice I saw an albatross.
Each flew by high in the air without taking any notice of us. I stared
with my mouth open. They were something supernatural and
incomprehensible. Another time, a short distance from the boat, two
Wilson’s petrels skimmed by, feet skipping on the water. They, too, took
no notice of us, and left me similarly amazed. We at last attracted the
attention of a short-tailed shearwater. It circled above us, eventually
dropping down. It kicked out its legs, turned its wings and alighted in
the water, floating as lightly as a cork. It eyed me with curiosity. I
quickly baited a hook with a bit of flying fish and threw the line its
way. I put no weights on the line and had difficulty getting it close to
the bird. On my third try the bird paddled up to the sinking bait and
plunged its head underwater to get at it. My heart pounded with
excitement. I did not pull on the line for some seconds. When I did, the
bird merely squawked and regurgitated what it had just swallowed. Before
I could try again, it unfolded its wings and pulled itself up into the
air. Within two, three beatings of its wings it was on its way. I had
better luck with a masked booby. It appeared out of nowhere, gliding
towards us, wings spanning over three feet. It landed on the gunnel
within hand’s reach of me. Its round eyes took me in, the expression
puzzled and serious. It was a large bird with a pure snowy white body
and wings that were jet-black at their tips and rear edges. Its big,
bulbous head had a very pointed orange-yellow beak and the red eyes
behind the black mask made it look like a thief who had had a very long
night. Only the oversized, brown webbed feet left something to be
desired in their design. The bird was fearless. It spent several minutes
tweaking its feathers with its beak, exposing soft down. When it was
finished, it looked up and everything fell into place, and it showed
itself for what it was: a smooth, beautiful, aerodynamic airship. When I
offered it a bit of dorado, it pecked it out of my hand, jabbing the
palm. I broke its neck by leveraging its head backwards, one hand
pushing up the beak, the other holding the neck. The feathers were so
well attached that when I started pulling them out, skin came off-I was
not plucking the bird; I was tearing it apart. It was light enough as it
was, a volume with no weight. I took the knife and skinned it instead.
For its size there was a disappointing amount of flesh, only a little on
its chest. It had a more chewy texture than dorado flesh, but I didn’t
find there was much of a difference in taste. In its stomach, besides
the morsel of dorado I had just given it, I found three small fish.
After rinsing them of digestive juices, I ate them. I ate the bird’s
heart, liver and lungs. I swallowed its eyes and tongue with a gulp of
water. I crashed its head and picked out its small brain. I ate the
webbings of its feet. The rest of the bird was skin, bone and feathers.
I dropped it beyond the edge of the tarpaulin for Richard Parker, who
hadn’t seen the bird arrive. An orange paw reached out. Days later
feathers and down were still floating up from his den and being blown
out to sea. Those that landed in the water were swallowed by fish. None
of the birds ever announced land.</p>
