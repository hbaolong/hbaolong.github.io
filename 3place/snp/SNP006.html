<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>Our good old nation was just seven years old as a republic when it
became bigger by a small territory. Pondicherry entered the Union of
India on November 1, 1954. One civic achievement called for another. A
portion of the grounds of the Pondicherry Botanical Garden was made
available rent-free for an exciting business opportunity and-lo and
behold-India had a brand new zoo, designed and run according to the most
modern, biologically sound principles. It was a huge zoo, spread over
numberless acres, big enough to require a train to explore it, though it
seemed to get smaller as I grew older, train included. Now it’s so small
it fits in my head. You must imagine a hot and humid place, bathed in
sunshine and bright colours. The riot of flowers is incessant. There are
trees, shrubs and climbing plants in profusion-peepuls, gulmohurs,
flames of the forest, red silk cottons, jacarandas, mangoes, jackfruits
and many others that would remain unknown to you if they didn’t have
neat labels at their feet. There are benches. On these benches you see
men sleeping, stretched out, or couples sitting, young couples, who
steal glances at each other shyly and whose hands flutter in the air,
happening to touch. Suddenly, amidst the tall and slim trees up ahead,
you notice two giraffes quietly observing you. The sight is not the last
of your surprises. The next moment you are startled by a furious
outburst coming from a great troupe of monkeys, only outdone in volume
by the shrill cries of strange birds. You come to a turnstile. You
distractedly pay a small sum of money. You move on. You see a low wall.
What can you expect beyond a low wall? Certainly not a shallow pit with
two mighty Indian rhinoceros. But that is what you find. And when you
turn your head you see the elephant that was there all along, so big you
didn’t notice it. And in the pond you realize those are hippopotamuses
floating in the water. The more you look, the more you see. You are in
Zootown! Before moving to Pondicherry, Father ran a large hotel in
Madras. An abiding interest in animals led him to the zoo business. A
natural transition, you might think, from hotelkeeping to zookeeping.
Not so. In many ways, running a zoo is a hotelkeeper’s worst nightmare.
Consider: the guests never leave their rooms; they expect not only
lodging but full board; they receive a constant flow of visitors, some
of whom are noisy and unruly. One has to wait until they saunter to
their balconies, so to speak, before one can clean their rooms, and then
one has to wait until they tire of the view and return to their rooms
before one can clean their balconies; and there is much cleaning to do,
for the guests are as unhygienic as alcoholics. Each guest is very
particular about his or her diet, constantly complains about the
slowness of the service, and never, ever tips. To speak frankly, many
are sexual deviants, either terribly repressed and subject to explosions
of frenzied lasciviousness or openly depraved, in either case regularly
affronting management with gross outrages of free sex and incest. Are
these the sorts of guests you would want to welcome to your inn? The
Pondicherry Zoo was the source of some pleasure and many headaches for
Mr. Santosh Patel, founder, owner, director, head of a staff of
fifty-three, and my father. To me, it was paradise on earth. I have
nothing but the fondest memories of growing up in a zoo. I lived the
life of a prince. What maharaja’s son had such vast, luxuriant grounds
to play about? What palace had such a menagerie? My alarm clock during
my childhood was a pride of lions. They were no Swiss clocks, but the
lions could be counted upon to roar their heads off between five-thirty
and six every morning. Breakfast was punctuated by the shrieks and cries
of howler monkeys, hill mynahs and Moluccan cockatoos. I left for school
under the benevolent gaze not only of Mother but also of bright-eyed
otters and burly American bison and stretching and yawning orang-utans.
I looked up as I ran under some trees, otherwise peafowl might excrete
on me. Better to go by the trees that sheltered the large colonies of
fruit bats; the only assault there at that early hour was the bats’
discordant concerts of squeaking and chattering. On my way out I might
stop by the terraria to look at some shiny frogs glazed bright, bright
green, or yellow and deep blue, or brown and pale green. Or it might be
birds that caught my attention: pink flamingoes or black swans or
one-wattled cassowaries, or something smaller, silver diamond doves,
Cape glossy starlings, peach-faced lovebirds, Nanday conures,
orange-fronted parakeets. Not likely that the elephants, the seals, the
big cats or the bears would be up and doing, but the baboons, the
macaques, the mangabeys, the gibbons, the deer, the tapirs, the llamas,
the giraffes, the mongooses were early risers. Every morning before I
was out the main gate I had one last impression that was both ordinary
and unforgettable: a pyramid of turtles; the iridescent snout of a
mandrill; the stately silence of a giraffe; the obese, yellow open mouth
of a hippo; the beak-and-claw climbing of a macaw parrot up a wire
fence; the greeting claps of a shoebill’s bill; the senile, lecherous
expression of a camel. And all these riches were had quickly, as I
hurried to school. It was after school that I discovered in a leisurely
way what it’s like to have an elephant search your clothes in the
friendly hope of finding a hidden nut, or an orang-utan pick through
your hair for tick snacks, its wheeze of disappointment at what an empty
pantry your head is. I wish I could convey the perfection of a seal
slipping into water or a spider monkey swinging from point to point or a
lion merely turning its head. But language founders in such seas. Better
to picture it in your head if you want to feel it. In zoos, as in
nature, the best times to visit are sunrise and sunset. That is when
most animals come to life. They stir and leave their shelter and tiptoe
to the water’s edge. They show their raiments. They sing their songs.
They turn to each other and perform their rites. The reward for the
watching eye and the listening ear is great. I spent more hours than I
can count a quiet witness to the highly mannered, manifold expressions
of life that grace our planet. It is something so bright, loud, weird
and delicate as to stupefy the senses. I have heard nearly as much
nonsense about zoos as I have about God and religion. Well-meaning but
misinformed people think animals in the wild are “happy“ because they
are “free.“ These people usually have a large, handsome predator in
mind, a lion or a cheetah (the life of a gnu or of an aardvark is rarely
exalted). They imagine this wild animal roaming about the savannah on
digestive walks after eating a prey that accepted its lot piously, or
going for callisthenic runs to stay slim after overindulging. They
imagine this animal overseeing its offspring proudly and tenderly, the
whole family watching the setting of the sun from the limbs of trees
with sighs of pleasure. The life of the wild animal is simple, noble and
meaningful, they imagine. Then it is captured by wicked men and thrown
into tiny jails. Its “happiness“ is dashed. It yearns mightily for
“freedom“ and does all it can to escape. Being denied its “freedom“ for
too long, the animal becomes a shadow of itself, its spirit broken. So
some people imagine. This is not the way it is. Animals in the wild lead
lives of compulsion and necessity within an unforgiving social hierarchy
in an environment where the supply of fear is high and the supply of
food low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites
forever endured. What is the meaning of freedom in such a context?
Animals in the wild are, in practice, free neither in space nor in time,
nor in their personal relations. In theory-that is, as a simple physical
possibility-an animal could pick up and go, flaunting all the social
conventions and boundaries proper to its species. But such an event is
less likely to happen than for a member of our own species, say a
shopkeeper with all the usual ties-to family, to friends, to society-to
drop everything and walk away from his life with only the spare change
in his pockets and the clothes on his frame. If a man, boldest and most
intelligent of creatures, won’t wander from place to place, a stranger
to all, beholden to none, why would an animal, which is by temperament
far more conservative? For that is what animals are, conservative, one
might even say reactionary. The smallest changes can upset them. They
want things to be just so, day after day, month after month. Surprises
are highly disagreeable to them. You see this in their spatial
relations. An animal inhabits its space, whether in a zoo or in the
wild, in the same way chess pieces move about a
chessboard-significantly. There is no more happenstance, no more
“freedom,“ involved in the whereabouts of a lizard or a bear or a deer
than in the location of a knight on a chessboard. Both speak of pattern
and purpose. In the wild, animals stick to the same paths for the same
pressing reasons, season after season. In a zoo, if an animal is not in
its normal place in its regular posture at the usual hour, it means
something. It may be the reflection of nothing more than a minor change
in the environment. A coiled hose left out by a keeper has made a
menacing impression. A puddle has formed that bothers the animal. A
ladder is making a shadow. But it could mean something more. At its
worst, it could be that most dreaded thing to a zoo director: a symptom,
a herald of trouble to come, a reason to inspect the dung, to
cross-examine the keeper, to summon the vet. All this because a stork is
not standing where it usually stands! But let me pursue for a moment
only one aspect of the question. If you went to a home, kicked down the
front door, chased the people who lived there out into the street and
said, “Go! You are free! Free as a bird! Go! Go!“-do you think they
would shout and dance for joy? They wouldn’t. Birds are not free. The
people you’ve just evicted would sputter, “With what right do you throw
us out? This is our home. We own it. We have lived here for years. We’re
calling the police, you scoundrel.“</p>
<p>Don’t we say, “There’s no place like home?“ That’s certainly what
animals feel. Animals are territorial. That is the key to their minds.
Only a familiar territory will allow them to fulfill the two relentless
imperatives of the wild: the avoidance of enemies and the getting of
food and water. A biologically sound zoo enclosure-whether cage, pit,
moated island, corral, terrarium, aviary or aquarium-is just another
territory, peculiar only in its size and in its proximity to human
territory. That it is so much smaller than what it would be in nature
stands to reason. Territories in the wild are large not as a matter of
taste but of necessity. In a zoo, we do for animals what we have done
for ourselves with houses: we bring together in a small space what in
the wild is spread out. Whereas before for us the cave was here, the
river over there, the hunting grounds a mile that way, the lookout next
to it, the berries somewhere else-all of them infested with lions,
snakes, ants, leeches and poison ivy-now the river flows through taps at
hand’s reach and we can wash next to where we sleep, we can eat where we
have cooked, and we can surround the whole with a protective wall and
keep it clean and warm. A house is a compressed territory where our
basic needs can be fulfilled close by and safely. A sound zoo enclosure
is the equivalent for an animal (with the noteworthy absence of a
fireplace or the like, present in every human habitation). Finding
within it all the places it needs-a lookout, a place for resting, for
eating and drinking, for bathing, for grooming, etc.-and finding that
there is no need to go hunting, food appearing six days a week, an
animal will take possession of its zoo space in the same way it would
lay claim to a new space in the wild, exploring it and marking it out in
the normal ways of its species, with sprays of urine perhaps. Once this
moving-in ritual is done and the animal has settled, it will not feel
like a nervous tenant, and even less like a prisoner, but rather like a
landholder, and it will behave in the same way within its enclosure as
it would in its territory in the wild, including defending it tooth and
nail should it be invaded. Such an enclosure is subjectively neither
better nor worse for an animal than its condition in the wild; so long
as it fulfills the animal’s needs, a territory, natural or constructed,
simply is, without judgment, a given, like the spots on a leopard. One
might even argue that if an animal could choose with intelligence, it
would opt for living in a zoo, since the major difference between a zoo
and the wild is the absence of parasites and enemies and the abundance
of food in the first, and their respective abundance and scarcity in the
second. Think about it yourself. Would you rather be put up at the Ritz
with free room service and unlimited access to a doctor or be homeless
without a soul to care for you? But animals are incapable of such
discernment. Within the limits of their nature, they make do with what
they have. A good zoo is a place of carefully worked-out coincidence:
exactly where an animal says to us, “Stay out!“ with its urine or other
secretion, we say to it, “Stay in!“ with our barriers. Under such
conditions of diplomatic peace, all animals are content and we can relax
and have a look at each other. In the literature can be found legions of
examples of animals that could escape but did not, or did and returned.
There is the case of the chimpanzee whose cage door was left unlocked
and had swung open. Increasingly anxious, the chimp began to shriek and
to slam the door shut repeatedly-with a deafening clang each time-until
the keeper, notified by a visitor, hurried over to remedy the situation.
A herd of roe-deer in a European zoo stepped out of their corral when
the gate was left open. Frightened by visitors, the deer bolted for the
nearby forest, which had its own herd of wild roe-deer and could support
more. Nonetheless, the zoo roe-deer quickly returned to their corral. In
another zoo a worker was walking to his work site at an early hour,
carrying planks of wood, when, to his horror, a bear emerged from the
morning mist, heading straight for him at a confident pace. The man
dropped the planks and ran for his life. The zoo staff immediately
started searching for the escaped bear. They found it back in its
enclosure, having climbed down into its pit the way it had climbed out,
by way of a tree that had fallen over. It was thought that the noise of
the planks of wood falling to the ground had frightened it. But I don’t
insist. I don’t mean to defend zoos. Close them all down if you want
(and let us hope that what wildlife remains can survive in what is left
of the natural world). I know zoos are no longer in people’s good
graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom
plague them both. The Pondicherry Zoo doesn’t exist any more. Its pits
are filled in, the cages torn down. I explore it now in the only place
left for it, my memory.</p>
