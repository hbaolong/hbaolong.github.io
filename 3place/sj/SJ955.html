<h4 id="新约-马太福音matthew-第-26-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 –
马太福音(Matthew) – 第 26 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>26:1 耶稣说完了这一切的话，就对门徒说，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he
said unto his disciples,</p>
<p>26:2 你们知道过两天是逾越节，人子将要被交给人，钉在十字架上。</p>
<p>Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son
of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p>26:3 那时，祭司长和民间的长老－聚集在大祭司称为该亚法的院里。</p>
<p>Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called
Caiaphas,</p>
<p>26:4 大家商议，要用诡计拿住耶稣杀他。</p>
<p>And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
him.</p>
<p>26:5 只是说，当节的日子不可，恐怕民间生乱。</p>
<p>But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among
the people.</p>
<p>26:6 耶稣在伯大尼长大麻疯的西门家里，</p>
<p>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
<p>26:7
有一个女人，拿着一玉瓶极贵的香膏来，趁耶稣坐席的时候，浇在他的头上。</p>
<p>There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious
ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
<p>26:8 门徒看见，就很不喜悦，说，何用这样的枉费呢。</p>
<p>But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what
purpose is this waste?</p>
<p>26:9 这香膏可以卖许多钱，周济穷人。</p>
<p>For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the
poor.</p>
<p>26:10
耶稣看出他们的意思，就说，为什么难为这女人呢。他在我身上作的，是一件美事。</p>
<p>When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p>26:11 因为常有穷人你们同在。只是你们不常有我。</p>
<p>For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p>26:12 他将这香膏浇在我身上，是为我安葬作的。</p>
<p>For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for
my burial.</p>
<p>26:13
我实在告诉你们，普天之下，无论在什么地方传这福音，也要述说这女人所行的，作个记念。</p>
<p>Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in
the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be
told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p>26:14 当下，十二门徒里，有一个称为加略人犹大的，去见祭司长说，</p>
<p>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief
priests,</p>
<p>26:15 我把他交给你们，你们愿意给我多少钱。他们就给了他三十块钱。</p>
<p>And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto
you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>26:16 从那时候，他就找机会，要把耶稣交给他们。</p>
<p>And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p>26:17
除酵节的第一天，门徒来问耶稣说，你吃逾越节的筵席，要我们在那里给你豫备。</p>
<p>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came
to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to
eat the passover?</p>
<p>26:18
耶稣说，你们进城去，到某人那里，对他说，夫子说，我的时候快到了。我与门徒要在你家守逾越节</p>
<p>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The
Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house
with my disciples.</p>
<p>26:19 门徒遵着耶稣所吩咐的就去豫备了逾越节的筵席</p>
<p>And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made
ready the passover.</p>
<p>26:20 到了晚上，耶稣十二个门徒坐席。</p>
<p>Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
<p>26:21
正吃的时候，耶稣说，我实在告诉你们，你们中间有一个人要卖我了。</p>
<p>And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you
shall betray me.</p>
<p>26:22 他们就甚忧愁，一个一个的问他说，主，是我吗。</p>
<p>And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say
unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
<p>26:23 耶稣回答说，同我蘸手在盘子里的，就是他要卖我。</p>
<p>And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the
dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
<p>26:24
人子必要去世，正如经上指着他所写的，但卖人子的人有祸了。那人不生在世上倒好。</p>
<p>The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man
by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he
had not been born.</p>
<p>26:25 卖耶稣的犹大问他说，拉比，是我吗。耶稣说，你说的是。</p>
<p>Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I?
He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
<p>26:26
他们吃的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝福，就擘开，递给门徒，说，你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。</p>
<p>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake
it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my
body.</p>
<p>26:27 又拿起杯来，祝谢了，递给他们，说，你们都喝这个。</p>
<p>And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it;</p>
<p>26:28 因为这是我立约的血，为多人流出来，使罪得赦。</p>
<p>For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for
the remission of sins.</p>
<p>26:29
但我告诉你们，从今以候，我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里，同你们喝新的那日子。</p>
<p>But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the
vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s
kingdom.</p>
<p>26:30 他们唱了诗，就出来往橄榄山去。</p>
<p>And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.</p>
<p>26:31
那时，耶稣对他们说，今夜你们为我的缘故，都要跌倒。因为经上记着说，我要击打牧人，羊就分散了。</p>
<p>Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me
this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep
of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
<p>26:32 但我复活以后，要在你们以先往加利利去。</p>
<p>But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p>26:33 彼得说，众人虽然为你的缘故跌倒，我却永不跌倒。</p>
<p>Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended
because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
<p>26:34 耶稣说，我实在告诉你，今夜鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p>26:35
彼得说，我就是必须和你同死，也总不能不认你。众门徒都是这样说。</p>
<p>Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p>26:36
耶稣同门徒来到一个地方，名叫客西马尼，就对他们说，你们坐在这里，太26：36）等我到那边去祷告。</p>
<p>Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith
unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
<p>26:37
于是带着彼得，和西庇太的两个儿子同去，就忧愁起来，极其难过。</p>
<p>And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to
be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
<p>26:38
便对他们说，我心里甚是忧伤，几乎要死。你们在这里等候，和我一同儆醒。</p>
<p>Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p>26:39
他就稍往前走，俯伏在地祷告说，我父阿，倘若可行，求你叫这杯离开我。然而不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。</p>
<p>And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
<p>26:40
来到门徒那里，见他们睡着了，就对彼得说，怎吗样，你们不能同我儆醒片时吗。</p>
<p>And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith
unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
<p>26:41
总要儆醒祷告，免得入了迷惑。你们心灵固然愿意，肉体却软弱了。</p>
<p>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed
is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p>26:42
第二次又去祷告说，我父阿，这杯若不能离开我，必要我喝，就愿你的旨意成全。</p>
<p>He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father,
if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be
done.</p>
<p>26:43 又来见他们睡着了，因为他们的眼睛困倦。</p>
<p>And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
heavy.</p>
<p>26:44 耶稣又离开他们去了。第三次祷告，说的话还是与先前一样。</p>
<p>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time,
saying the same words.</p>
<p>26:45
于是来到门徒那里，对他们说，现在你们仍然睡觉安歇吧。（吧或作吗）时候到了，人子被卖在罪人手里了。</p>
<p>Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now,
and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is
betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>26:46 起来，我们走吧。看哪，卖我的人近了。</p>
<p>Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</p>
<p>26:47
说话之间，那十二个门徒里的犹大来了，并有许多人，带着刀棒，从祭司长和民间的长老那里，与他同来。</p>
<p>And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with
him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and
elders of the people.</p>
<p>26:48
那卖耶稣的，给了他们一个暗号，说，我与谁亲嘴，谁就是他。你们可以拿住他。</p>
<p>Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall
kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
<p>26:49 犹大随既到耶稣跟前说，请拉比安。就与他亲嘴。</p>
<p>And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed
him.</p>
<p>26:50
耶稣对他说，朋友，你来要作的事，就作吧。于是那些人上前，下手拿住耶稣。</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came
they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
<p>26:51
有跟随耶稣的一个人，伸手拔出刀来，将大祭司的仆人砍了一刀，削掉了他一个耳朵。</p>
<p>And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his
hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and
smote off his ear.</p>
<p>26:52 耶稣对他说，收刀入鞘吧。凡动刀的，必死在刀下。</p>
<p>Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for
all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p>26:53 你想我不能求我父，现在为我差遣十二营多天使来吗。</p>
<p>Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p>26:54 若是这样，经上所说，事情必须如此的话，怎吗应验呢。</p>
<p>But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must
be?</p>
<p>26:55
当时，耶稣对众人说，你们带着刀棒，出来拿我，如同拿强盗吗。我天天坐在殿里教训人，你们并没有拿我。</p>
<p>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with
you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
<p>26:56
但这一切的事成就了，为要应验先知书上的话。当下门徒都离开他逃走了。</p>
<p>But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be
fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p>26:57
拿耶稣的人，把他带到大祭司该亚法那里去。文士和长老，已经在那里聚会。</p>
<p>And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p>26:58
彼得远远的跟着耶稣，直到大祭司的院子，进到里面，就和差役同坐，要看这事到底怎样。</p>
<p>But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace, and
went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p>26:59 祭司长和全公会，寻梢假见证，控告耶稣，要治死他。</p>
<p>Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false
witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p>26:60 虽有好些人来作假见证，总得不着实据。末后有两个人前来说，</p>
<p>But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they
none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p>26:61 这个人曾说，我能拆毁神的殿，三日内又建造起来。</p>
<p>And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God,
and to build it in three days.</p>
<p>26:62
大祭司就站起来，对耶稣说，你什么都不回答吗。这些人作见证告你的是什么呢。</p>
<p>And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing?
what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p>26:63
耶稣却不言语。大祭司对他说，我指着永生神，叫你起誓告诉我们，你是神的儿子基督不是。</p>
<p>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto
him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be
the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>26:64
耶稣对他说，你说的是。然而我告诉你们，后来你们要看见人子，坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you,
Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>26:65
大祭司就撕开衣服说，他说了僭妄的话，我们何必再用见证人呢。这僭妄的话，现在你们都听见了。</p>
<p>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have
heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p>26:66 你们的意见如何。他们回答说，他是该死的。</p>
<p>What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p>26:67 他们就吐唾沫在他脸上，用拳头打他。也有用手掌打他的，说，</p>
<p>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote
him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p>26:68 基督阿，你是先知，告诉我们打你的是谁。</p>
<p>Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?</p>
<p>26:69
彼得在外面院子里坐着，有一个使女前来说，你素来也是同那加利利人耶稣一夥的。</p>
<p>Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p>26:70 彼得在众人面前却不承认，说，我不知道你说的是什么。</p>
<p>But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
sayest.</p>
<p>26:71
既出去，到了门口，又有一个使女看见他，就对那里的人说，这个人也是同拿撒勒人耶稣一夥的。</p>
<p>And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and
said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.</p>
<p>26:72 彼得又不承认，并且起誓说，我不认得那个人。</p>
<p>And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p>26:73
过了不多的时候，旁边站着的人前来，对彼得说，你真是他们一党的。你的口音把你露出来了。</p>
<p>And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.</p>
<p>26:74 彼得发咒起誓的说，我不认得那个人。立时鸡就叫了。</p>
<p>Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And
immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p>26:75
彼得想起耶稣所说的话，鸡叫以先，你要三次不认我。他就出去痛哭。</p>
<p>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.</p>
