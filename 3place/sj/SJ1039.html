<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-21-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 21 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>21:1
我们离别了众人，就开船一直行到哥士。第二天到了罗底，从那里到帕大喇。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had
launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</p>
<p>21:2 遇见一只船，要往腓尼基去，就上船起行。</p>
<p>And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and
set forth.</p>
<p>21:3
望见塞浦路斯，就从南边行过，往叙利亚去，我们就在推罗上岸。因为船要在那里卸货。</p>
<p>Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and
sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade
her burden.</p>
<p>21:4
找着了门徒，就在那里住了七天。他们被圣灵感动，对保罗说，不要上耶路撒冷去。</p>
<p>And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul
through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:5
过了这几天，我们就起身前行。他们众人同妻子儿女，送我们到城外，我们都跪在岸上祷告，彼此辞别。</p>
<p>And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our
way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till
we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and
prayed.</p>
<p>21:6 我们上了船，他们就回家去了。</p>
<p>And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and
they returned home again.</p>
<p>21:7
我们从推罗行尽了水路，来到多利买，就问那里的弟兄安，和他们同住了一天。</p>
<p>And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais,
and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</p>
<p>21:8
第二天，我们离开那里，来到凯撒利亚。就进了传福音的腓利家，和他同住。他是那七个执事里的一个。</p>
<p>And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and came
unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist,
which was one of the seven; and abode with him.</p>
<p>21:9 他有四个女儿，都是处女，是说预言的。</p>
<p>And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</p>
<p>21:10 我们在那里多住了几天，有一个先知，名叫亚迦布，从犹太下来。</p>
<p>And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a
certain prophet, named Agabus.</p>
<p>21:11
到了我们这里，就拿保罗的腰带，捆上自己的手脚，说，圣灵说，犹太人在耶路撒冷，要如此捆绑这腰带的主人，把他交给外邦人手里。</p>
<p>And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound his
own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the
Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>21:12 我们和那本地的人，听见这话，都苦劝保罗不要上耶路撒冷去。</p>
<p>And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,
besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:13
保罗说，你们为什么这样痛哭，使我心碎呢。我为主耶稣的名，不但被人捆绑，就是死在耶路撒冷，也是愿意的。</p>
<p>Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart? for
I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the
name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>21:14 保罗既不听劝，我们便住口了，只说，愿主的旨意成就便是了。</p>
<p>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of
the Lord be done.</p>
<p>21:15 过了几日，我们收拾行李上耶路撒冷去。</p>
<p>And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:16
有凯撒利亚的几个门徒和我们同去，带我们到一个久为（久为或作老）门徒的家里，叫我们与他同住，他名叫拿孙，是塞浦路斯人。</p>
<p>There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and
brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we
should lodge.</p>
<p>21:17 到了耶路撒冷，弟兄们欢欢喜喜的接待我们。</p>
<p>And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
gladly.</p>
<p>21:18 第二天，保罗同我们去见雅各。长老们也都在那里。</p>
<p>And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
elders were present.</p>
<p>21:19
保罗问了他们安，便将神用他传教，在外邦人中间所行之事，一一的述说了。</p>
<p>And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things
God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</p>
<p>21:20
他们听见，就归荣耀与神，对保罗说，兄台，你看犹太人中信主的有多少万，并且都为律法热心。</p>
<p>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him,
Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe;
and they are all zealous of the law:</p>
<p>21:21
他们听见人说，你教训一切在外邦的犹太人，离弃摩西，对他们说，不要给孩子行割礼，也不要遵行条规。</p>
<p>And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which
are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to
circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p>
<p>21:22 众人必听见你来了，这可怎吗办呢。</p>
<p>What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for
they will hear that thou art come.</p>
<p>21:23 你就照着我们的话行吧，我们这里有四个人，都有愿在身。</p>
<p>Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a
vow on them;</p>
<p>21:24
你带他们去，与他们一同行洁净的礼，替他们拿出规费，叫他们得以剃头。这样，众人就可知道，先前所听见你的事都是虚的。并可知道，你自己为人，循规蹈矩，遵行律法。</p>
<p>Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them,
that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things,
whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou
thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p>
<p>21:25
至于信主的外邦人，我们已经写信拟定，叫他们谨忌那祭偶像之物，和血，并勒死的牲畜，与奸淫。</p>
<p>As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded
that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves
from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and
from fornication.</p>
<p>21:26
于是保罗带着那四个人，第二天与他们一同行了洁净的礼，进了殿，报明洁净的日期满足。只等祭司为他们各人献祭。</p>
<p>Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them
entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of
purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of
them.</p>
<p>21:27
那七日将完，从亚细亚来的犹太人，看见保罗在殿里，就耸动了众人，下手拿他，</p>
<p>And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of
Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and
laid hands on him,</p>
<p>21:28
喊叫说，以色列人来帮助，这就是在各处教训众人糟践我们百姓，和律法，并这地方的。他又带着希腊人进殿，污秽了这圣地。</p>
<p>Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all
men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and
further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy
place.</p>
<p>21:29
这话是因他们曾看见以弗所人特罗非摩，同保罗在城里，以为保罗带他进了殿。</p>
<p>(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian,
whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</p>
<p>21:30
合城都震动，百姓一齐跑来，拿住保罗，拉他出殿，殿门立刻都关了。</p>
<p>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they
took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were
shut.</p>
<p>21:31
他们正想要杀他，有人报信给营里的千夫长说，耶路撒冷合城都乱了。</p>
<p>And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</p>
<p>21:32
千夫长立时带着兵丁，和几个百夫长，跑下去到他们那里。他们见了千夫长和兵丁，就止住不打保罗。</p>
<p>Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them:
and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating
of Paul.</p>
<p>21:33
于是千夫长上前拿住他，吩咐用两条铁链捆锁。又问他是什么人，作的是什么事。</p>
<p>Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to
be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had
done.</p>
<p>21:34
众人有喊叫这个的，有喊叫那个的。千夫长因为这样乱囔，得不着实情，就吩咐人把保罗带进营楼去。</p>
<p>And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and when
he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be
carried into the castle.</p>
<p>21:35 到了台阶，众人挤得兄猛，兵丁只得将保罗抬起来。</p>
<p>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the
soldiers for the violence of the people.</p>
<p>21:36 众人跟在后面，喊着说，除掉他。</p>
<p>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with
him.</p>
<p>21:37
将要带他进营楼，保罗对千夫长说，我对你说句话，可以不可以。他说，你懂得希腊话吗。</p>
<p>And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief
captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?</p>
<p>21:38 你莫非是从前作乱，带领四千凶徒，往旷野去的那埃及人吗。</p>
<p>Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an uproar,
and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were
murderers?</p>
<p>21:39
保罗说，我本是犹太人，生在基利家的大数，并不是无名小城的人，求你准我对百姓说话。</p>
<p>But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to
speak unto the people.</p>
<p>21:40
千夫长准了，保罗就站在台阶上，向百姓摆手，他们都静默无声，保罗使用希伯来话对他们说。</p>
<p>And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and
beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great
silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</p>
