<h4 id="旧约-以斯帖记esther-第-9-章-本篇共有-10-章">旧约 –
以斯帖记(Esther) – 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 10 章 )</h4>
<p>9:1
十二月，乃亚达月十三日，王的谕旨将要举行，就是犹大人的仇敌盼望辖制他们的日子，犹大人反倒辖制恨他们的人。</p>
<p>Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth
day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree drew near to
be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to
have power over them, (though it was turned to the contrary, that the
Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</p>
<p>9:2
犹大人在亚哈随鲁王各省的城里聚集，下手击杀那要害他们的人。无人能敌挡他们，因为各族都惧怕他们。</p>
<p>The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all
the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their
hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon
all people.</p>
<p>9:3
各省的首领，总督，省长，和办理王事的人，因惧怕末底改，就都帮助犹大人。</p>
<p>And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of
Mordecai fell upon them.</p>
<p>9:4 末底改在朝中为大，名声传遍各省，日渐昌盛。</p>
<p>For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out
throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
greater.</p>
<p>9:5 犹大人用刀击杀一切仇敌，任意杀灭恨他们的人。</p>
<p>Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword,
and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto those that
hated them.</p>
<p>9:6 在书珊城，犹大人杀灭了五百人。</p>
<p>And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred
men.</p>
<p>9:7 又杀巴珊大他，达分，亚斯帕他，</p>
<p>And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p>
<p>9:8 破拉他，亚大利雅，亚利大他，</p>
<p>And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>
<p>9:9 帕玛斯他，亚利赛，亚利代，瓦耶撒他。</p>
<p>And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</p>
<p>9:10
这十人都是哈米大他的孙子，犹大人仇敌哈曼的儿子。犹大人却没有下手夺取财物。</p>
<p>The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews,
slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</p>
<p>9:11 当日，将书珊城被杀的人数呈在王前。</p>
<p>On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the palace
was brought before the king.</p>
<p>9:12
王对王后以斯帖说，犹大人在书珊城杀灭了五百人，又杀了哈曼的十个儿子，在王各省不知如何呢。现在你要什么，我必赐给你。你还求什么，也必为你成就。</p>
<p>And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of
Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what
is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request
further? and it shall be done.</p>
<p>9:13
以斯帖说，王若以为美，求你准书珊的犹大人，明日也照今日的旨意行，并将哈曼十个儿子的尸首挂在木架上。</p>
<p>Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the
Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this day’s
decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</p>
<p>9:14
王便允准如此行。旨意传在书珊，人就把哈曼十个儿子的尸首挂起来了。</p>
<p>And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was given at
Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.</p>
<p>9:15
亚达月十四日书珊的犹大人又聚集在书珊，杀了三百人，却没有下手夺取财物。</p>
<p>For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the
fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men at
Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</p>
<p>9:16
在王各省其馀的犹大人，也都聚集保护性命，杀了恨他们的人七万五千，却没有下手夺取财物。这样，就脱离仇敌，得享平安。</p>
<p>But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered
themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid
not their hands on the prey,</p>
<p>9:17 亚达月十三日，行了这事。十四日安息，以这日为设筵欢乐的日子。</p>
<p>On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of
the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</p>
<p>9:18
但书珊的犹大人，这十三日，十四日聚集杀戮仇敌。十五日安息，以这日为设筵欢乐的日子。</p>
<p>But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and
gladness.</p>
<p>9:19
所以住无城墙乡村的犹大人，如今都以亚达月十四日为设筵欢乐的吉日，彼此馈送礼物。</p>
<p>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled towns,
made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</p>
<p>9:20 末底改记录这事，写信与亚哈随鲁王各省远近所有的犹大人，</p>
<p>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews
that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and
far,</p>
<p>9:21 嘱咐他们每年守亚达月十四，十五两日。</p>
<p>To stablish this among them, that they should keep the fourteenth day
of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</p>
<p>9:22
以这月的两日为犹大人脱离仇敌得平安，转忧为喜，转悲为乐的吉日。在这两日设筵欢乐，彼此馈送礼物，周济穷人。</p>
<p>As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month
which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a
good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of
sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</p>
<p>9:23
于是，犹大人按着末底改所写与他们的信，应承照初次所守的守为永例。</p>
<p>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had
written unto them;</p>
<p>9:24
是因犹大人的仇敌，亚甲族哈米大他的儿子哈曼，设谋杀害犹大人，掣普珥，是掣签，为要杀尽灭绝他们。</p>
<p>Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all
the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast
Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
<p>9:25
这事报告于王，王便降旨使哈曼谋害犹大人的恶事，归到他自己的头上，并吩咐把他和他的众子都挂在木架上。</p>
<p>But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters that
his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon
his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
gallows.</p>
<p>9:26
照着普珥的名字，犹大人就称这两日为普珥日。他们因这信上的话，又因所看见所遇见的事，</p>
<p>Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</p>
<p>9:27
就应承自己与后裔，并归附他们的人，每年按时必守这两日，永远不废。</p>
<p>The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon
all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that
they would keep these two days according to their writing, and according
to their appointed time every year;</p>
<p>9:28
各省各城，家家户户，世世代代纪念遵守这两日，使这普珥日在犹大人中不可废掉，在他们后裔中也不可忘记。</p>
<p>And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every
generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these
days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of
them perish from their seed.</p>
<p>9:29
亚比孩的女儿王后以斯帖，和犹大人末底改以全权写第二封信，坚嘱犹大人守这普珥日。</p>
<p>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew,
wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.</p>
<p>9:30
用和平诚实话，写信给亚哈随鲁王国中，一百二十七省所有的犹大人，</p>
<p>And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and
seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and
truth,</p>
<p>9:31
劝他们按时守这普珥日，禁食呼求，是照犹大人末底改，和王后以斯帖，所嘱咐的。也照犹大人为自己与后裔所应承的。</p>
<p>To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as
Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had
decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters of the fastings
and their cry.</p>
<p>9:32 以斯帖命定守普珥日，这事也记录在书上。</p>
<p>And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was
written in the book.</p>
