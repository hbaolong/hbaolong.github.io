<h4 id="新约-路加福音luke-第-1-章-本篇共有-24-章">新约 – 路加福音(Luke)
– 第 1 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>1:1 提阿非罗大人哪，有好些人提笔作书，</p>
<p>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a
declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</p>
<p>1:2
*述说在我们中间所成就的事，是照传道的人，从起初亲眼看见，又传给我们的</p>
<p>Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>
<p>1:3 这些事我既从起头都详细考察了，就定意要按着次序写给你，</p>
<p>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all
things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent
Theophilus,</p>
<p>1:4 使你知道所学之道都是确实的。</p>
<p>That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou
hast been instructed.</p>
<p>1:5
当犹太王希律的时候，亚比雅班里有一个祭司，名叫撒迦利亚。他妻子是亚伦的后人，名叫伊利莎白。</p>
<p>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest
named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife was of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</p>
<p>1:6
他们二人，在神面前都是义人，遵行主的一切诫命礼仪，没有可指摘的。</p>
<p>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the
commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p>
<p>1:7 只是没有孩子，因为伊利莎白不生育，两个人又年纪老迈了。</p>
<p>And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they
both were now well stricken in years.</p>
<p>1:8 撒迦利亚按班次，在神前面供祭司的职分，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office
before God in the order of his course,</p>
<p>1:9 照祭司的规矩掣签，得进主殿烧香。</p>
<p>According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn
incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>
<p>1:10 烧香的时后，众百姓在外面祷告。</p>
<p>And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the
time of incense.</p>
<p>1:11 有主的使者站在香坛的右边，向他显现。</p>
<p>And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the
right side of the altar of incense.</p>
<p>1:12 撒迦利亚看见，就惊慌害怕。</p>
<p>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon
him.</p>
<p>1:13
天使对他说，撒迦利亚，不要害怕。因为你的祈祷已经被听见了，你的妻子伊利莎白要给你生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫约翰。</p>
<p>But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call
his name John.</p>
<p>1:14 你必喜欢快乐，有许多人因他出世，也必喜乐。</p>
<p>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his
birth.</p>
<p>1:15 他在主面前将要为大，淡酒浓酒都不喝，从母腹里就被圣灵充满了。</p>
<p>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink
neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy
Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.</p>
<p>1:16 他要使许多以色列人回转，归于他们的神。</p>
<p>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their
God.</p>
<p>1:17
他必有以利亚的心志能力，行在主的前面，叫为父的心转向儿女，叫悖逆的人转从义人的智慧。又为主豫备合用的百姓。</p>
<p>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn
the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>
<p>1:18
撒迦利亚对天使说，我凭着什么可知道这事呢，我已经老了，我的妻子也年纪老迈了。</p>
<p>And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I
am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>
<p>1:19
天使回答说，我是站在神面前的加百列，奉差而来，对你说话，将这好信息报给你。</p>
<p>And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in
the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee
these glad tidings.</p>
<p>1:20
到了时候，这话必然应验。只因你不信，你必哑吧不能说话，直到这事成就的日子。</p>
<p>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day
that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my
words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>
<p>1:21 百姓等候撒迦利亚，诧异他许久在殿里。</p>
<p>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so
long in the temple.</p>
<p>1:22
及至他出来，不能和他们说话。他们知道他在殿里见了异象。因为他直向他们打手式，竟成了哑吧。</p>
<p>And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they
perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto
them, and remained speechless.</p>
<p>1:23 他供职的日子已满，就回家去了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration
were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>
<p>1:24 这些日子以后，他的妻子伊利莎白怀了孕，就隐藏了五个月，</p>
<p>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself
five months, saying,</p>
<p>1:25 说，主在眷顾我的日子，这样看待我，要把我在人间的羞耻除掉。</p>
<p>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me,
to take away my reproach among men.</p>
<p>1:26
到了第六个月，天使加百列奉神的差遣，往加利利的一座城去，这城名叫拿撒勒。</p>
<p>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>
<p>1:27
到一个童女那里，是已经许配大卫家的一个人，名叫约瑟，童女的名字叫马利亚。</p>
<p>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</p>
<p>1:28 天使进去，对他说，蒙大恩的女子，我问你安，主和你同在了。</p>
<p>And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly
favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</p>
<p>1:29 马利亚因这话就很惊慌，又反复思想这样问安是什么意思。</p>
<p>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her
mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>
<p>1:30 天使对他说，马利亚不要怕。你在神面前已经蒙恩了。</p>
<p>And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found
favour with God.</p>
<p>1:31 你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。</p>
<p>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son,
and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>
<p>1:32 他要为大，称为至高者的儿子。主神要把他祖大卫的位给他。</p>
<p>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and
the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</p>
<p>1:33 他要作雅各家的王，直到永远。他的国也没有穷尽。</p>
<p>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his
kingdom there shall be no end.</p>
<p>1:34 马利亚对天使说，我没有出嫁，怎吗有这事呢。</p>
<p>Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a
man?</p>
<p>1:35
天使回答说，圣灵要临到你身上，至高者的能力要荫庇你。因此所要生的圣者，必称为神的儿子。（或作所要生的必称为圣称为神的儿子）</p>
<p>And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore
also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son
of God.</p>
<p>1:36
况且你的亲戚伊利莎白，在年老的时候，也怀了男胎。就是那素来称为不生育的，现在有孕六个月了。</p>
<p>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in
her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called
barren.</p>
<p>1:37 因为出于神的话，没有一句不带能力的。</p>
<p>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>
<p>1:38
马利亚说，我是主的使女，情愿照你的话成就在我身上。天使就离开他去了。</p>
<p>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me
according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>
<p>1:39 那时候马利亚起身，急忙往山地里去，来到犹大的一座城。</p>
<p>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with
haste, into a city of Juda;</p>
<p>1:40 进了撒迦利亚的家，问伊利莎白安。</p>
<p>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</p>
<p>1:41
伊利莎白一听马利亚问安，所怀的胎就在腹里跳动，伊利莎白且圣灵充满。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of
Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the
Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>1:42 高声喊着说，你在妇女中是有福的，你所怀的胎也是有福的。</p>
<p>And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among
women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</p>
<p>1:43 我主的母到我这里来，这是从那里得的呢。</p>
<p>And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to
me?</p>
<p>1:44 因为你问安的声音，一入我耳，我腹里的胎，就欢喜跳动。</p>
<p>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears,
the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p>
<p>1:45 这相信的女子是有福的。因为主对他所说的话，都要应验。</p>
<p>And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of
those things which were told her from the Lord.</p>
<p>1:46 马利亚说，我心尊主为大，</p>
<p>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p>
<p>1:47 我灵以神我的救主为乐。</p>
<p>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>
<p>1:48 因为他顾念他使女的卑微。从今以后，万代要称我有福。</p>
<p>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold,
from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>
<p>1:49 那有权能的为我成就了大事。他的名为圣。</p>
<p>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his
name.</p>
<p>1:50 他怜悯敬畏他的人，直到世世代代。</p>
<p>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to
generation.</p>
<p>1:51 他用膀臂施展大能。那狂傲的人，正心里妄想，就被他赶散了。</p>
<p>He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in
the imagination of their hearts.</p>
<p>1:52 他叫有权柄的失位，叫卑贱的升高。</p>
<p>He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low
degree.</p>
<p>1:53 叫饥饿的得饱美食，叫富足的空手回去。</p>
<p>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
empty away.</p>
<p>1:54 他扶助了他的仆人以色列，</p>
<p>He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</p>
<p>1:55
为要记念亚伯拉罕和他的后裔，施怜悯，直到永远，正如从前对我们列祖所说的话。</p>
<p>As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</p>
<p>1:56 马利亚和伊利莎白同住，约有三个月，就回家了。</p>
<p>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own
house.</p>
<p>1:57 伊利莎白的产期到了，就生了一个儿子。</p>
<p>Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she
brought forth a son.</p>
<p>1:58 邻里亲族，听见主向他大施怜悯，就和他一同欢乐。</p>
<p>And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed
great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>
<p>1:59
到了第八日，他们来要给孩子行割礼。并要照他父亲的名字，叫他撒迦利亚。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise
the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his
father.</p>
<p>1:60 他母亲说，不可。要叫他约翰。</p>
<p>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called
John.</p>
<p>1:61 他们说，你亲族中没有叫这名字的。</p>
<p>And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called
by this name.</p>
<p>1:62 他们就向他父亲打手式，问他要叫这孩子什么名字。</p>
<p>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</p>
<p>1:63 他要了一块写字的板，就写上说，他的名字是约翰。他们便都希奇。</p>
<p>And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is
John. And they marvelled all.</p>
<p>1:64 撒迦利亚的口立时开了，舌头也舒展了，就说出话来，称颂神。</p>
<p>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he
spake, and praised God.</p>
<p>1:65 周围居住的人都惧怕，这一切的事就传遍了犹太的山地。</p>
<p>And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these
sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of
Judaea.</p>
<p>1:66
凡听见的人，都将这事放在心里，说，这个孩子，将来怎吗样呢。因为有主与他同在。</p>
<p>And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying,
What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with
him.</p>
<p>1:67 他父亲撒迦利亚，被圣灵充满了，就预言说，</p>
<p>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and
prophesied, saying,</p>
<p>1:68
主以色列的神，是应当称颂的。因他眷顾他的百姓，为他们施行救赎。</p>
<p>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed
his people,</p>
<p>1:69 在他仆人大卫家中，为我们兴起了拯救的角，</p>
<p>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his
servant David;</p>
<p>1:70 （正如主藉着从创世以来，圣先知的口所说的话）</p>
<p>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since
the world began:</p>
<p>1:71 拯救我们脱离仇敌，和一切恨我们之人的手。</p>
<p>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all
that hate us;</p>
<p>1:72 向我们列祖施怜悯，记念他的圣约。</p>
<p>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his
holy covenant;</p>
<p>1:73 就是他对我们祖宗亚伯拉罕所起的誓，</p>
<p>The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</p>
<p>1:74 叫我们既从仇敌手中被救出来，</p>
<p>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand
of our enemies might serve him without fear,</p>
<p>1:75 就可以终身在他面前，坦然无惧的用圣洁公义事奉他。</p>
<p>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our
life.</p>
<p>1:76
孩子阿，你要称为至高者的先知。因为你要行在主的前面，豫备他的道路。</p>
<p>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou
shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</p>
<p>1:77 叫他的百姓因罪得赦，就知到救恩。</p>
<p>To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of
their sins,</p>
<p>1:78 因我们神怜悯的心肠，叫清晨的日光从高天临到我们，</p>
<p>Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on
high hath visited us,</p>
<p>1:79 要照亮黑暗中死荫里的人。把我们的脚引到平安的路上。</p>
<p>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of
death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>
<p>1:80
那孩子渐渐长大，心灵强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。</p>
<p>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the
deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p>
