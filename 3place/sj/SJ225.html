<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-14-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 14 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>14:1 参孙下到亭拿，在那里看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿。</p>
<p>And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the
daughters of the Philistines.</p>
<p>14:2
参孙上来禀告他父母说，我在亭拿看见一个女子，是非利士人的女儿，愿你们给我娶来为妻。</p>
<p>And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have
seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now
therefore get her for me to wife.</p>
<p>14:3
他父母说，在你弟兄的女儿中，或在本国的民中，岂没有一个女子，何至你去在未受割礼的非利士人中娶妻呢。参孙对他父亲说，愿你给我娶那女子，因我喜悦她。</p>
<p>Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman
among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou
goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said
unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</p>
<p>14:4
他的父母却不知道这事是出于耶和华，因为他找机会攻击非利士人。那时，非利士人辖制以色列人。</p>
<p>But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that
he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the
Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>
<p>14:5
参孙跟他父母下亭拿去，到了亭拿的葡萄园，见有一只少壮狮子向他吼叫。</p>
<p>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and
came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared
against him.</p>
<p>14:6
耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他虽然手无器械，却将狮子撕裂，如同撕裂山羊羔一样。他行这事并没有告诉父母。</p>
<p>And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as
he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told
not his father or his mother what he had done.</p>
<p>14:7 参孙下去与女子说话，就喜悦她。</p>
<p>And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson
well.</p>
<p>14:8
过了些日子，再下去要娶那女子，转向道旁要看死狮，见有一群蜂子和蜜在死狮之内，</p>
<p>And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see
the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and
honey in the carcase of the lion.</p>
<p>14:9
就用手取蜜，且吃且走。到了父母那里，给他父母，他们也吃了。只是没有告诉这蜜是从死狮之内取来的。</p>
<p>And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his
father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not
them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</p>
<p>14:10
他父亲下去见女子。参孙在那里设摆筵宴，因为向来少年人都有这个规矩。</p>
<p>So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a
feast; for so used the young men to do.</p>
<p>14:11 众人看见参孙，就请了三十个人陪伴他。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty
companions to be with him.</p>
<p>14:12
参孙对他们说，我给你们出一个谜语，你们在七日筵宴之内，若能猜出意思告诉我，我就给你们三十件里衣，三十套衣裳。</p>
<p>And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if
ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and
find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of
garments:</p>
<p>14:13
你们若不能猜出意思告诉我，你们就给我三十件里衣，三十套衣裳。他们说，请将谜语说给我们听。</p>
<p>But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets
and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy
riddle, that we may hear it.</p>
<p>14:14
参孙对他们说，吃的从吃者出来。甜的从强者出来。他们三日不能猜出谜语的意思。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of
the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days
expound the riddle.</p>
<p>14:15
到第七天，他们对参孙的妻说，你诓哄你丈夫，探出谜语的意思告诉我们，免得我们用火烧你和你父家。你们请了我们来，是要夺我们所有的吗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s
wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest
we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye called us to take
that we have? is it not so?</p>
<p>14:16
参孙的妻在丈夫面前啼哭说，你是恨我，不是爱我，你给我本国的人出谜语，却没有将意思告诉我。参孙回答说，连我父母我都没有告诉，岂可告诉你呢。</p>
<p>And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me,
and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my
people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have
not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</p>
<p>14:17
七日筵宴之内，她在丈夫面前啼哭，到第七天逼着他，他才将谜语的意思告诉他妻，他妻就告诉本国的人。</p>
<p>And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and
it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay
sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her
people.</p>
<p>14:18
到第七天，日头未落以前，那城里的人对参孙说，有什么比蜜还甜呢。有什么比狮子还强呢。参孙对他们说，你们若非用我的母牛犊耕地，就猜不出我谜语的意思来。</p>
<p>And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the
sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a
lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had
not found out my riddle.</p>
<p>14:19
耶和华的灵大大感动参孙，他就下到亚实基伦，击杀了三十个人，夺了他们的衣裳，将衣裳给了猜出谜语的人。参孙发怒，就上父家去了。</p>
<p>And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave
change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger
was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.</p>
<p>14:20 参孙的妻便归了参孙的陪伴，就是作过他朋友的。</p>
<p>But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used as his
friend.</p>
