<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-1-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 1 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>1:1
当三十年四月初五日，以西结（原文作我）在迦巴鲁河边被掳的人中，天就开了，得见神的异象。</p>
<p>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in
the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of
Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</p>
<p>1:2 正是约雅斤王被掳去第五年四月初五日，</p>
<p>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king
Jehoiachin’s captivity,</p>
<p>1:3
在迦勒底人之地，迦巴鲁河边，耶和华的话特特临到布西的儿子祭司以西结。耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在他身上。</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son
of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand
of the LORD was there upon him.</p>
<p>1:4
我观看，见狂风从北方刮来，随着有一朵包括闪烁火的大云，周围有光辉。从其中的火内发出好像光耀的精金。</p>
<p>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great
cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and
out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the
fire.</p>
<p>1:5 又从其中显出四个活物的形像来。他们的形状是这样，有人的形像，</p>
<p>Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living
creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a
man.</p>
<p>1:6 各有四个脸面，四个翅膀。</p>
<p>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</p>
<p>1:7 他们的腿是直的，脚掌好像牛犊之蹄，都灿烂如光明的铜。</p>
<p>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was
like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of
burnished brass.</p>
<p>1:8 在四面的翅膀以下有人的手。这四个活物的脸和翅膀乃是这样，</p>
<p>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four
sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>
<p>1:9 翅膀彼此相接，行走并不转身，俱各直往前行。</p>
<p>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they
went; they went every one straight forward.</p>
<p>1:10
至于脸的形像，前面各有人的脸，右面各有狮子的脸，左面各有牛的脸，后面各有鹰的脸。</p>
<p>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man,
and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of
an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</p>
<p>1:11 各展开上边的两个翅膀相接，各以下边的两个翅膀遮体。</p>
<p>Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two
wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their
bodies.</p>
<p>1:12 他们俱各直往前行。灵往哪里去，他们就往那里去，行走并不转身。</p>
<p>And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to
go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>
<p>1:13
至于四活物的形像，就如烧着火炭的形状，又如火把的形状。火在四活物中间上去下来，这火有光辉，从火中发出闪电。</p>
<p>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up
and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of
the fire went forth lightning.</p>
<p>1:14 这活物往来奔走，好像电光一闪。</p>
<p>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a
flash of lightning.</p>
<p>1:15 我正观看活物的时候，见活物的脸旁各有一轮在地上。</p>
<p>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth
by the living creatures, with his four faces.</p>
<p>1:16
轮的形状和颜色（原文作作法）好像水苍玉。四轮都是一个样式，形状和作法好像轮中套轮。</p>
<p>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour
of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and
their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</p>
<p>1:17 轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。</p>
<p>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not
when they went.</p>
<p>1:18 至于轮辋，高而可畏。四个轮辋周围满有眼睛。</p>
<p>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and
their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</p>
<p>1:19 活物行走，轮也在旁边行走。活物从地上升，轮也都上升。</p>
<p>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when
the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were
lifted up.</p>
<p>1:20
灵往哪里去，活物就往那里去。活物上升，轮也在活物旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。</p>
<p>Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their
spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the
spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</p>
<p>1:21
那些行走，这些也行走。那些站住，这些也站住。那些从地上升，轮也在旁边上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。</p>
<p>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and
when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over
against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the
wheels.</p>
<p>1:22
活物的头以上有穹苍的形像，看着像可畏的水晶，铺张在活物的头以上。</p>
<p>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living
creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over
their heads above.</p>
<p>1:23 穹苍以下，活物的翅膀直张，彼此相对。每活物有两个翅膀遮体。</p>
<p>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the
other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had
two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</p>
<p>1:24
活物行走的时候，我听见翅膀的响声，像大水的声音，像全能者的声音，也像军队哄囔的声音。活物站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。</p>
<p>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise
of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as
the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>
<p>1:25 在他们头以上的穹苍之上有声音。他们站住的时候，便将翅膀垂下。</p>
<p>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads,
when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>
<p>1:26
在他们头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，彷佛蓝宝石。在宝座形像以上有彷佛人的形状。</p>
<p>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of
a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness
of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon
it.</p>
<p>1:27
我见从他腰以上有彷佛光耀的精金，周围都有火的形状，又见从他腰以下有彷佛火的形状，周围也有光辉。</p>
<p>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round
about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from
the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the
appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</p>
<p>1:28
下雨的日子，云中虹的形状怎样，周围光辉的形状也是怎样。这就是耶和华荣耀的形像。我一看见就俯伏在地，又听见一位说话的声音。</p>
<p>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain,
so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the
appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it,
I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>
