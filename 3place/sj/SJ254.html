<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-18-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 18 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>18:1
大卫对扫罗说完了话，约拿单的心与大卫的心深相契合。约拿单爱大卫，如同爱自己的性命。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul,
that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan
loved him as his own soul.</p>
<p>18:2 那日扫罗留住大卫，不容他再回父家。</p>
<p>And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his
father’s house.</p>
<p>18:3 约拿单爱大卫如同爱自己的性命，就与他结盟。</p>
<p>Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his
own soul.</p>
<p>18:4
约拿单从身上脱下外袍，给了大卫，又将战衣，刀，弓，腰带都给了他。</p>
<p>And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave
it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to
his girdle.</p>
<p>18:5
扫罗无论差遣大卫往何处去，他都作事精明。扫罗就立他作战士长，众百姓和扫罗的臣仆无不喜悦。</p>
<p>And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved himself
wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the
sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.</p>
<p>18:6
大卫打死了那非利士人，同众人回来的时候，妇女们从以色列各城里出来，欢欢喜喜，打鼓击磬，歌唱跳舞，迎接扫罗王。</p>
<p>And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the
slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of
Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy,
and with instruments of musick.</p>
<p>18:7 众妇女舞蹈唱和，说，扫罗杀死千千，大卫杀死万万。</p>
<p>And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul
hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</p>
<p>18:8
扫罗甚发怒，不喜悦这话，就说，将万万归大卫，千千归我，只剩下王位没有给他了。</p>
<p>And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said,
They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have
ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</p>
<p>18:9 从这日起，扫罗就怒视大卫。</p>
<p>And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</p>
<p>18:10
次日，从神那里来的恶魔大大降在扫罗身上，他就在家中胡言乱语。大卫照常弹琴，扫罗手里拿着枪。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came
upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played
with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul’s
hand.</p>
<p>18:11
扫罗把枪一抡，心里说，我要将大卫刺透，钉在墙上。大卫躲避他两次。</p>
<p>And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to
the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</p>
<p>18:12 扫罗惧怕大卫。因为耶和华离开自己，与大卫同在。</p>
<p>And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was
departed from Saul.</p>
<p>18:13 所以扫罗使大卫离开自己，立他为千夫长，他就领兵出入。</p>
<p>Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a
thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</p>
<p>18:14 大卫作事无不精明，耶和华也与他同在。</p>
<p>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was
with him.</p>
<p>18:15 扫罗见大卫作事精明，就甚怕他。</p>
<p>Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was
afraid of him.</p>
<p>18:16 但以色列和犹大众人都爱大卫，因为他领他们出入。</p>
<p>But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in
before them.</p>
<p>18:17
扫罗对大卫说，我将大女儿米拉给你为妻，只要你为我奋勇，为耶和华争战。扫罗心里说，我不好亲手害他，要藉非利士人的手害他。</p>
<p>And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I
give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s
battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand
of the Philistines be upon him.</p>
<p>18:18
大卫对扫罗说，我是谁，我是什么出身，我父家在以色列中是何等的家，岂敢作王的女婿呢。</p>
<p>And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</p>
<p>18:19
扫罗的女儿米拉到了当给大卫的时候，扫罗却给了米何拉人亚得列为妻。</p>
<p>But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should
have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite
to wife.</p>
<p>18:20 扫罗的次女米甲爱大卫。有人告诉扫罗，扫罗就喜悦。</p>
<p>And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the
thing pleased him.</p>
<p>18:21
扫罗心里说，我将这女儿给大卫，作他的网罗，好藉非利士人的手害他。所以扫罗对大卫说，你今日可以第二次作我的女婿。</p>
<p>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him,
and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul
said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the
twain.</p>
<p>18:22
扫罗吩咐臣仆说，你们暗中对大卫说，王喜悦你，王的臣仆也都喜爱你，所以你当作王的女婿。</p>
<p>And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly,
and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants
love thee: now therefore be the king’s son in law.</p>
<p>18:23
扫罗的臣仆就照这话说给大卫听。大卫说，你们以为作王的女婿是一件小事吗。我是贫穷卑微的人。</p>
<p>And Saul’s servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David
said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing
that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</p>
<p>18:24 扫罗的臣仆回奏说，大卫所说的如此如此。</p>
<p>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake
David.</p>
<p>18:25
扫罗说，你们要对大卫这样说，王不要什么聘礼，只要一百非利士人的阳皮，好在王的仇敌身上报仇。扫罗的意思要使大卫丧在非利士人的手里。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any
dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the
king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the
Philistines.</p>
<p>18:26
扫罗的臣仆将这话告诉大卫，大卫就欢喜作王的女婿。日期还没有到，</p>
<p>And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well
to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.</p>
<p>18:27
大卫和跟随他的人起身前往，杀了二百非利士人，将阳皮满数交给王，为要作王的女婿。于是扫罗将女儿米甲给大卫为妻。</p>
<p>Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the
Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they
gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in
law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</p>
<p>18:28 扫罗见耶和华与大卫同在，又知道女儿米甲爱大卫，</p>
<p>And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal
Saul’s daughter loved him.</p>
<p>18:29 就更怕大卫，常作大卫的仇敌。</p>
<p>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s
enemy continually.</p>
<p>18:30
每逢非利士军长出来打仗，大卫比扫罗的臣仆作事精明，因此他的名被人尊重。</p>
<p>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass,
after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all
the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</p>
