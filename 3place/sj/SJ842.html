<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-40-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 40 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>40:1
我们被掳掠第二十五年，耶路撒冷城攻破后十四年，正在年初，月之初十日，耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在我身上，他把我带到以色列地。</p>
<p>In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of
the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after
that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day the hand of the LORD was
upon me, and brought me thither.</p>
<p>40:2
在神的异象中带我到以色列地，安置在至高的山上。在山上的南边有彷佛一座城建立。</p>
<p>In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set
me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the frame of a city on the
south.</p>
<p>40:3
他带我到那里，见有一人，颜色（原文作形状）如铜，手拿麻绳和量度的竿，站在门口。</p>
<p>And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his
hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</p>
<p>40:4
那人对我说，人子阿，凡我所指示你的，你都要用眼看，用耳听，并要放在心上。我带你到这里来，特为要指示你。凡你所见的，你都要告诉以色列家。</p>
<p>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and
hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew
thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou
brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</p>
<p>40:5
我见殿四围有墙。那人手拿量度的竿，长六肘，每肘是一肘零一掌。他用竿量墙，厚一竿，高一竿。</p>
<p>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the
man’s hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand
breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the
height, one reed.</p>
<p>40:6
他到了朝东的门，就上门的台阶，量门的这槛，宽一竿。又量门的那槛，宽一竿。</p>
<p>Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up
the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was
one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed
broad.</p>
<p>40:7
又有卫房，每房长一竿，宽一竿，相隔五肘。门槛，就是挨着向殿的廊门槛，宽一竿。</p>
<p>And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad; and
between the little chambers were five cubits; and the threshold of the
gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.</p>
<p>40:8 他又量向殿门的廊子，宽一竿。</p>
<p>He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.</p>
<p>40:9 又量门廊，宽八肘，墙柱厚二肘。那门的廊子向着殿。</p>
<p>Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts
thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward.</p>
<p>40:10
东门洞有卫房，这旁三间，那旁三间，都是一样的尺寸。这边的柱子和那边的柱子，也是一样的尺寸。</p>
<p>And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on this side,
and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts
had one measure on this side and on that side.</p>
<p>40:11 他量门口，宽十肘，长十三肘。</p>
<p>And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and
the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</p>
<p>40:12
卫房前晒出的境界，这边一肘，那边一肘。卫房这边六肘，那边六肘。</p>
<p>The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on this side,
and the space was one cubit on that side: and the little chambers were
six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</p>
<p>40:13
又量门洞，从这卫房顶的后檐到那卫房顶的后檐，宽二十五肘。卫房门与门相对。</p>
<p>He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the
roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty cubits, door against
door.</p>
<p>40:14
又量（原文作造）廊子六十肘（七十士译本作二十肘），墙柱外是院子，有廊为界，在门洞两边。</p>
<p>He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of the
court round about the gate.</p>
<p>40:15 从大门口到内廊前，共五十肘。</p>
<p>And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the
porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.</p>
<p>40:16
卫房和门洞两旁柱间并廊子，都有严紧的窗棂。里边都有窗棂，柱上有雕刻的棕树。</p>
<p>And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to their
posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and
windows were round about inward: and upon each post were palm trees.</p>
<p>40:17 他带我到外院，见院的四围有铺石地。铺石地上有屋子三十间。</p>
<p>Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about: thirty chambers
were upon the pavement.</p>
<p>40:18 铺石地，就是矮铺石地在各门洞两旁，以门洞的长短为度。</p>
<p>And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of
the gates was the lower pavement.</p>
<p>40:19 他从下门量到内院外，共宽一百肘，东面北面都是如此。</p>
<p>Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate
unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred cubits
eastward and northward.</p>
<p>40:20 他量外院朝北的门，长宽若干。</p>
<p>And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the north, he
measured the length thereof, and the breadth thereof.</p>
<p>40:21
门洞的卫房，这旁三间，那旁三间。门洞的柱子和廊子，与第一门的尺寸一样。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。</p>
<p>And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and three on
that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the
measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the
breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>
<p>40:22
其窗棂和廊子，并雕刻的棕树，与朝东的门尺寸一样。登七层台阶上到这门，前面有廊子。</p>
<p>And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees, were after
the measure of the gate that looketh toward the east; and they went up
unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.</p>
<p>40:23
内院有门与这门相对，北面东面都是如此。他从这门量到那门，共一百肘。</p>
<p>And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the
north, and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate an hundred
cubits.</p>
<p>40:24
他带我往南去，见朝南有门，又照先前的尺寸量门洞的柱子和廊子。</p>
<p>After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward
the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof
according to these measures.</p>
<p>40:25
门洞两旁与廊子的周围都有窗棂，和先量的窗棂一样。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。</p>
<p>And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about,
like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five
and twenty cubits.</p>
<p>40:26
登七层台阶上到这门，前面有廊子。柱上有雕刻的棕树，这边一棵，那边一棵。</p>
<p>And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof
were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another
on that side, upon the posts thereof.</p>
<p>40:27 内院朝南有门。从这门量到朝南的那门，共一百肘。</p>
<p>And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and he
measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred cubits.</p>
<p>40:28 他带我从南门到内院，就照先前的尺寸量南门。</p>
<p>And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
measured the south gate according to these measures;</p>
<p>40:29
卫房和柱子，并廊子都照先前的尺寸。门洞两旁与廊子的周围都有窗棂。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。</p>
<p>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in
it and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long, and
five and twenty cubits broad.</p>
<p>40:30 周围有廊子，长二十五肘，宽五肘。</p>
<p>And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long, and five
cubits broad.</p>
<p>40:31 廊子朝着外院，柱上有雕刻的棕树。登八层台阶上到这门。</p>
<p>And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees
were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.</p>
<p>40:32 他带我到内院的东面，就照先前的尺寸量东门。</p>
<p>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
measured the gate according to these measures.</p>
<p>40:33
卫房和柱子，并廊子都照先前的尺寸。门洞两旁与廊子的周围都有窗棂。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。</p>
<p>And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the
arches thereof, were according to these measures: and there were windows
therein and in the arches thereof round about: it was fifty cubits long,

<p>40:34
廊子朝着外院。门洞两旁的柱子都有雕刻的棕树。登八层台阶上到这门。</p>
<p>And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees
were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the
going up to it had eight steps.</p>
<p>40:35 他带我到北门，就照先前的尺寸量那门，</p>
<p>And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according to
these measures;</p>
<p>40:36
就是量卫房和柱子，并廊子。门洞周围都有窗棂。门洞长五十肘，宽二十五肘。</p>
<p>The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits,
and the breadth five and twenty cubits.</p>
<p>40:37
廊柱朝着外院。门洞两旁的柱子都有雕刻的棕树。登八层台阶上到这门。</p>
<p>And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees
were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the
going up to it had eight steps.</p>
<p>40:38 门洞的柱旁有屋子和门。祭司（原文作他们）在那里洗燔祭牲。</p>
<p>And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of the
gates, where they washed the burnt offering.</p>
<p>40:39
在门廊内，这边有两张桌子，那边有两张桌子，在其上可以宰杀燔祭牲，赎罪祭牲，和赎愆祭牲。</p>
<p>And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two
tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering and the sin
offering and the trespass offering.</p>
<p>40:40 上到朝北的门口，这边有两张桌子，门廊那边也有两张桌子。</p>
<p>And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the north
gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of
the gate, were two tables.</p>
<p>40:41
门这边有四张桌子，那边有四张桌子，共八张。在其上祭司宰杀牺牲。</p>
<p>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the
side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their
sacrifices.</p>
<p>40:42
为燔祭牲有四张桌子，是凿过的石头作成的，长一肘半，宽一肘半，高一肘。祭司将宰杀燔祭牲和平安祭牲所用的器皿放在其上。</p>
<p>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a
cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit
high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the
burnt offering and the sacrifice.</p>
<p>40:43 有钩子，宽一掌，钉在廊内的四围。桌子上有牺牲的肉。</p>
<p>And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon
the tables was the flesh of the offering.</p>
<p>40:44
在北门旁，内院里有屋子，为歌唱的人而设。这屋子朝南（南原文作东）。在南门旁，又有一间朝北。</p>
<p>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the
inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect
was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the
prospect toward the north.</p>
<p>40:45 他对我说，这朝南的屋子是为看守殿宇的祭司。</p>
<p>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the
south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</p>
<p>40:46
那朝北的屋子是为看守祭坛的祭司。这些祭司是利未人中撒督的子孙，近前来事奉耶和华的。</p>
<p>And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of
Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister
unto him.</p>
<p>40:47 他又量内院，长一百肘，宽一百肘，是见方的。祭坛在殿前。</p>
<p>So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred
cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.</p>
<p>40:48
于是他带我到殿前的廊子，量廊子的墙柱。这面厚五肘，那面厚五肘。门两旁，这边三肘，那边三肘。</p>
<p>And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post
of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side:
and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three
cubits on that side.</p>
<p>40:49
廊子长二十肘，宽十一肘。上廊子有台阶。靠近墙柱又有柱子，这边一根，那边一根。</p>
<p>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven
cubits; and he brought me by the steps whereby they went up to it: and
there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that
side.</p>
