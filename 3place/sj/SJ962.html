<h4 id="新约-马可福音mark-第-5-章-本篇共有-16-章">新约 – 马可福音(Mark)
– 第 5 章 ( 本篇共有 16 章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 他们来到海边，格拉森人的地方。</p>
<p>And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country
of the Gadarenes.</p>
<p>5:2 耶稣一下船，就有一个被污鬼咐着的人，从坟茔里出来迎着他。</p>
<p>And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out
of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p>
<p>5:3 那人常住在坟茔里，没有人能捆住他，就是用铁链也不能。</p>
<p>Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no,
not with chains:</p>
<p>5:4
因为人屡次用脚镣和铁链捆锁他，铁链竟被他挣断了，脚镣也被他弄碎了。总没有人能制伏他。</p>
<p>Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the
chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in
pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p>
<p>5:5 他昼夜常在坟茔里和山中喊叫，又用石头砍自己。</p>
<p>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs,
crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p>
<p>5:6 他远远的看见耶稣，就跑过去拜他。</p>
<p>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p>
<p>5:7
大声呼叫说，至高神的儿子耶稣，我与你有什么相干。我指着神恳求你，不要叫我受苦。</p>
<p>And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee,
Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou
torment me not.</p>
<p>5:8 是因耶稣曾吩咐他说，污鬼阿，从这人身上出来吧。</p>
<p>For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.</p>
<p>5:9 耶稣问他说，你名叫什么。回答说，我名叫群，因为我们多的缘故。</p>
<p>And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name
is Legion: for we are many.</p>
<p>5:10 就再三的求耶稣，不要叫他们离开那地方。</p>
<p>And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the
country.</p>
<p>5:11 在那里山坡上，有一大群猪吃食。</p>
<p>Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine
feeding.</p>
<p>5:12 鬼就央求耶稣说，求你打发我们往猪群里附着猪去。</p>
<p>And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that
we may enter into them.</p>
<p>5:13
耶稣准了他们。污鬼就出来，进入猪里去。于是那群猪闯下山崖，投在海里，淹死了。猪的数目，约有二千。</p>
<p>And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went
out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep
place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in
the sea.</p>
<p>5:14 放猪的就逃跑了，去告诉城里和乡下的人。众人就来要看是什么事。</p>
<p>And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the
country. And they went out to see what it was that was done.</p>
<p>5:15
他们来到耶稣那里，看见那被鬼附着的人，就是从前被群鬼所附的，坐着，穿上衣服，心里明白过来。他们就害怕。</p>
<p>And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the
devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind:
and they were afraid.</p>
<p>5:16
看见这事的，便将鬼附之人所遇见的，和那群猪的事，都告诉了众人。</p>
<p>And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was
possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</p>
<p>5:17 众人就央求耶稣离开他们的境界。</p>
<p>And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>
<p>5:18 耶稣上船的时后，那从前被鬼附着的人，恳求和耶稣同在。</p>
<p>And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with
the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p>
<p>5:19
耶稣不许，却对他说，你回家去，到你的亲属那里，将主为你所作的，是何等大的事，是怎样怜悯你，都告诉他们。</p>
<p>Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to thy
friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and
hath had compassion on thee.</p>
<p>5:20
那人就走了，在低加波利，传扬耶稣为他作了何等大的事，众人都希奇。</p>
<p>And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great things
Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</p>
<p>5:21 耶稣坐船又渡到那边去，就有许多人到他那里聚集。他正在海边上。</p>
<p>And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side,
much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the sea.</p>
<p>5:22 有一个管会堂的人，名叫睚鲁，来见耶稣，就伏在他脚前，</p>
<p>And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus
by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p>
<p>5:23
再三的求他说，我的小女儿快要死了，求你去按手在他身上，使他痊愈，得以活了。</p>
<p>And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at the
point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on her, that she may
be healed; and she shall live.</p>
<p>5:24 耶稣就和他同去，有许多人跟随拥挤他。</p>
<p>And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged
him.</p>
<p>5:25 有一个女人，患了十二年的血漏，</p>
<p>And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p>
<p>5:26
在好些医生手里，受了许多的苦。又花尽了他所有的，一点也不见好，病势反倒更重了。</p>
<p>And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all
that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,</p>
<p>5:27 他听见耶稣的事，就从后头来，杂在众人中间，摸耶稣的衣裳。</p>
<p>When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and touched
his garment.</p>
<p>5:28 意思说，我只摸他的衣裳，就必痊愈。</p>
<p>For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole.</p>
<p>5:29 于是他血漏的源头，立刻乾了。他便觉得身上的灾病好了。</p>
<p>And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt
in her body that she was healed of that plague.</p>
<p>5:30
耶稣顿时心里觉得有能力从自己身上出去，就在众人中间转过来说，谁摸我的衣裳。</p>
<p>And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of
him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my
clothes?</p>
<p>5:31 门徒对他说，你看众人拥挤你，还说谁摸我吗。</p>
<p>And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging
thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>
<p>5:32 耶稣周围观看，要见作这事的女人。</p>
<p>And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>
<p>5:33
那女人知道在自己身上所成的事，就恐惧战竞，来俯伏在耶稣跟前，将实情全告诉他。</p>
<p>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her,
came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</p>
<p>5:34
耶稣对他说，女儿，你的信救了你，平平安安的回去吧。你的灾病痊愈了。</p>
<p>And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in
peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>
<p>5:35
还说话的时候，有人从管会堂的家里来说，你的女儿死了，何必还劳动先生呢。</p>
<p>While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s
house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the
Master any further?</p>
<p>5:36 耶稣听见所说的话，就对管会堂的说，不要怕。只要信。</p>
<p>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto the
ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p>
<p>5:37 于是带着彼得，雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰同去，不许别人跟随他。</p>
<p>And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James, and John
the brother of James.</p>
<p>5:38
他们来到管会堂的家里，耶稣看见那里乱囔，并有人大大的哭泣哀号。</p>
<p>And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and seeth
the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</p>
<p>5:39
进到里面，就对他们说，为什么乱囔哭泣呢，孩子不是死了，是睡着了。</p>
<p>And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this ado,
and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>
<p>5:40
他们就嗤笑耶稣。耶稣把他们都撵出去，就带着孩子的父母，和跟随的人进入了孩子所在的地方。</p>
<p>And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he
taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with
him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying.</p>
<p>5:41
就拉着孩子的手，对他说，大利大古米。翻出来，就是说，闺女，我吩咐你起来。</p>
<p>And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi;
which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.</p>
<p>5:42 那闺女立时起来走。他们就大大的惊奇。闺女已经十二岁了。</p>
<p>And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of the age
of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.</p>
<p>5:43 耶稣切切的嘱咐他们，不要叫人知道这事。又吩咐给他东西吃。</p>
<p>And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and
commanded that something should be given her to eat.</p>
