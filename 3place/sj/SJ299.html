<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-8-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
那时，所罗门将以色列的长老和各支派的首领，并以色列的族长，招聚到耶路撒冷，要把耶和华的约柜从大卫城就是锡安运上来。</p>
<p>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king
Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant
of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</p>
<p>8:2 以他念月，就是七月，在节前，以色列人都聚集到所罗门王那里。</p>
<p>And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at
the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.</p>
<p>8:3 以色列长老来到，祭司便抬起约柜，</p>
<p>And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
ark.</p>
<p>8:4
祭司和利未人将耶和华的约柜运上来，又将会幕和会幕的一切圣器具都带上来。</p>
<p>And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, even
those did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p>8:5
所罗门王和聚集到他那里的以色列全会众，一同在约柜前献牛羊为祭，多得不可胜数。</p>
<p>And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were
assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>8:6
祭司将耶和华的约柜抬进内殿，就是至圣所，放在两个基路伯的翅膀底下。</p>
<p>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto
his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place, even
under the wings of the cherubims.</p>
<p>8:7 基路伯张着翅膀在约柜之上，遮掩约柜和抬柜的杠。</p>
<p>For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the
ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p>8:8
这杠甚长，杠头在内殿前的圣所可以看见，在殿外却不能看见，直到如今还在那里。</p>
<p>And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen
out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seen without:
and there they are unto this day.</p>
<p>8:9
约柜里惟有两块石版，就是以色列人出埃及地后，耶和华与他们立约的时候摩西在何烈山所放的。除此以外，并无别物。</p>
<p>There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which
Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>8:10 祭司从圣所出来的时候，有云充满耶和华的殿。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</p>
<p>8:11 甚至祭司不能站立供职，因为耶和华的荣光充满了殿。</p>
<p>So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud:
for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:12 那时所罗门说，耶和华曾说，他必住在幽暗之处。</p>
<p>Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick
darkness.</p>
<p>8:13 我已经建造殿宇作你的居所，为你永远的住处。</p>
<p>I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for
thee to abide in for ever.</p>
<p>8:14 王转脸为以色列会众祝福，以色列会众就都站立。</p>
<p>And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation
of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)</p>
<p>8:15
所罗门说，耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的。因他亲口向我父大卫所应许的，也亲手成就了。</p>
<p>And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his
mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,
saying,</p>
<p>8:16
他说，自从我领我民以色列出埃及以来，我未曾在以色列各支派中选择一城建造殿宇为我名的居所，但拣选大卫治理我民以色列。</p>
<p>Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I
chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my
name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people
Israel.</p>
<p>8:17 所罗门说，我父大卫曾立意，要为耶和华以色列神的名建殿。</p>
<p>And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>8:18 耶和华却对我父大卫说，你立意为我的名建殿，这意思甚好。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart
to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine
heart.</p>
<p>8:19 只是你不可建殿，惟你所生的儿子必为我名建殿。</p>
<p>Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall
come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name.</p>
<p>8:20
现在耶和华成就了他所应许的话，使我接续我父大卫坐以色列的国位，又为耶和华以色列神的名建造了殿。</p>
<p>And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up
in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the
LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of
Israel.</p>
<p>8:21
我也在其中为约柜预备一处。约柜内有耶和华的约，就是他领我们列祖出埃及地的时候，与他们所立的约。</p>
<p>And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenant of
the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of
the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>8:22 所罗门当着以色列会众，站在耶和华的坛前，向天举手说，</p>
<p>And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward
heaven:</p>
<p>8:23
耶和华以色列的神阿，天上地下没有神可比你的。你向那尽心行在你面前的仆人守约施慈爱。</p>
<p>And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven
above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy
servants that walk before thee with all their heart:</p>
<p>8:24
向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话现在应验了。你亲口应许，亲手成就，正如今日一样。</p>
<p>Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst
him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled it with thine
hand, as it is this day.</p>
<p>8:25
耶和华以色列的神阿，你所应许你仆人我父大卫的话说，你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，在我面前行事像你所行的一样，就不断人坐以色列的国位。现在求你应验这话。</p>
<p>Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my
father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man
in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take
heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before
me.</p>
<p>8:26 以色列的神阿，求你成就向你仆人我父大卫所应许的话。</p>
<p>And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,
which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</p>
<p>8:27
神果真住在地上吗。看哪，天和天上的天尚且不足你居住的，何况我所建的这殿呢。</p>
<p>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven
of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have
builded?</p>
<p>8:28
惟求耶和华我的神垂顾仆人的祷告祈求，俯听仆人今日在你面前的祈祷呼吁。</p>
<p>Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer,
which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</p>
<p>8:29
愿你昼夜看顾这殿，就是你应许立为你名的居所。求你垂听仆人向此处祷告的话。</p>
<p>That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even
toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward
this place.</p>
<p>8:30
你仆人和你民以色列向此处祈祷的时候，求你在天上你的居所垂听，垂听而赦免。</p>
<p>And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy
people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in
heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.</p>
<p>8:31 人若得罪邻舍，有人叫他起誓，他来到这殿在你的坛前起誓，</p>
<p>If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this
house:</p>
<p>8:32
求你在天上垂听，判断你的仆人，定恶人有罪，照他所行的报应在他头上。定义人有理，照他的义赏赐他。</p>
<p>Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning
the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the
righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.</p>
<p>8:33
你的民以色列若得罪你，败在仇敌面前，又归向你，承认你的名，在这殿里祈求祷告，</p>
<p>When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they
have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy
name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house:</p>
<p>8:34
求你在天上垂听，赦免你民以色列的罪，使他们归回你赐给他们列祖之地。</p>
<p>Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel,
and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their
fathers.</p>
<p>8:35
你的民因得罪你，你惩罚他们，使天闭塞不下雨。他们若向此处祷告，承认你的名，离开他们的罪，</p>
<p>When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have
sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy
name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them:</p>
<p>8:36
求你在天上垂听，赦免你仆人以色列民的罪，将当行的善道指教他们，且降雨在你的地，就是你赐给你民为业之地。</p>
<p>Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of
thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should
walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people
for an inheritance.</p>
<p>8:37
国中若有饥荒，瘟疫，旱风，霉烂，蝗虫，蚂蚱，或有仇敌犯境围困城邑，无论遭遇什么灾祸疾病，</p>
<p>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them
in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness
there be;</p>
<p>8:38
你的民以色列，或是众人，或是一人，自觉有罪（原文作灾），向这殿举手，无论祈求什么，祷告什么，</p>
<p>What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by all thy
people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart,
and spread forth his hands toward this house:</p>
<p>8:39
求你在天上你的居所垂听赦免。你是知道人心的，要照各人所行的待他们，（惟有你知道世人的心），</p>
<p>Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and
give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for
thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of
men;)</p>
<p>8:40 使他们在你赐给我们列祖之地上一生一世敬畏你。</p>
<p>That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which
thou gavest unto our fathers.</p>
<p>8:41 论到不属你民以色列的外邦人，为你名从远方而来，</p>
<p>Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but
cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake;</p>
<p>8:42
（他们听人论说你的大名和大能的手，并伸出来的膀臂）向这殿祷告，</p>
<p>(For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and
of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this
house;</p>
<p>8:43
求你在天上你的居所垂听，照着外邦人所祈求的而行，使天下万民都认识你的名，敬畏你像你的民以色列一样。又使他们知道我建造的这殿是称为你名下的。</p>
<p>Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that
the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know
thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know
that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.</p>
<p>8:44
你的民若奉你的差遣，无论往何处去与仇敌争战，向耶和华所选择的城与我为你名所建造的殿祷告，</p>
<p>If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever
thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which
thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thy
name:</p>
<p>8:45 求你在天上垂听他们的祷告祈求，使他们得胜。</p>
<p>Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
maintain their cause.</p>
<p>8:46
你的民若得罪你（世上没有不犯罪的人），你向他们发怒，将他们交给仇敌掳到仇敌之地，或远或近，</p>
<p>If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and
thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they
carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;</p>
<p>8:47
他们若在掳到之地想起罪来，回心转意，恳求你说，我们有罪了，我们悖逆了，我们作恶了。</p>
<p>Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were
carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the
land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and
have done perversely, we have committed wickedness;</p>
<p>8:48
他们若在掳到之地尽心尽性归服你，又向自己的地，就是你赐给他们列祖之地和你所选择的城，并我为你名所建造的殿祷告，</p>
<p>And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their
soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and
pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers,
the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for
thy name:</p>
<p>8:49 求你在天上你的居所垂听他们的祷告祈求，为他们伸冤。</p>
<p>Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</p>
<p>8:50
饶恕得罪你的民，赦免他们的一切过犯，使他们在掳他们的人面前蒙怜恤。</p>
<p>And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their
transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give
them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have
compassion on them:</p>
<p>8:51 因为他们是你的子民，你的产业，是你从埃及领出来脱离铁炉的。</p>
<p>For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest
forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:</p>
<p>8:52
愿你的眼目看顾仆人，听你民以色列的祈求，无论何时向你祈求，愿你垂听。</p>
<p>That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and
unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all
that they call for unto thee.</p>
<p>8:53
主耶和华阿，你将他们从地上的万民中分别出来作你的产业，是照你领我们列祖出埃及的时候，藉你仆人摩西所应许的话。</p>
<p>For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth,
to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy
servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORD God.</p>
<p>8:54
所罗门在耶和华的坛前屈膝跪着，向天举手，在耶和华面前祷告祈求已毕，就起来，</p>
<p>And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of
the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to
heaven.</p>
<p>8:55 站着，大声为以色列全会众祝福，说，</p>
<p>And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud
voice, saying,</p>
<p>8:56
耶和华是应当称颂的。因为他照着一切所应许的赐平安给他的民以色列人，凡藉他仆人摩西应许赐福的话，一句都没有落空。</p>
<p>Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel,
according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all
his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his
servant.</p>
<p>8:57
愿耶和华我们的神与我们同在，像与我们列祖同在一样，不撇下我们，不丢弃我们，</p>
<p>The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not
leave us, nor forsake us:</p>
<p>8:58
使我们的心归向他，遵行他的道，谨守他吩咐我们列祖的诫命，律例，典章。</p>
<p>That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and
to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he
commanded our fathers.</p>
<p>8:59
我在耶和华面前祈求的这些话，愿耶和华我们的神昼夜垂念，每日为他仆人与他民以色列伸冤，</p>
<p>And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the
cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times,
as the matter shall require:</p>
<p>8:60 使地上的万民都知道惟独耶和华是神，并无别神。</p>
<p>That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is God, and
that there is none else.</p>
<p>8:61
所以你们当向耶和华我们的神存诚实的心，遵行他的律例，谨守他的诫命，至终如今日一样。</p>
<p>Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in
his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.</p>
<p>8:62 王和以色列众民一同在耶和华面前献祭。</p>
<p>And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
LORD.</p>
<p>8:63
所罗门向耶和华献平安祭，用牛二万二千，羊十二万。这样，王和以色列众民为耶和华的殿行奉献之礼。</p>
<p>And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the
house of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:64
当日，王因耶和华殿前的铜坛太小，容不下燔祭，素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油，便将耶和华殿前院子当中分别为圣，在那里献燔祭，素祭，和平安祭牲的脂油。</p>
<p>The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was
before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and
meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen
altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt
offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p>
<p>8:65
那时，所罗门和以色列众人，就是从哈马口直到埃及小河所有的以色列人，都聚集成为大会，在耶和华我们的神面前守节七日又七日，共十四日。</p>
<p>And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a
great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of
Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen
days.</p>

第八日，王遣散众民。他们都为王祝福。因见耶和华向他仆人大卫和他民以色列所施的一切恩惠，就都心中喜乐，各归各家去了。</p>

and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness
that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his
people.</p>
