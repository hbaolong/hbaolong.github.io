<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-9-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>9:1
先知以利沙叫了一个先知门徒来，吩咐他说，你束上腰，手拿这瓶膏油往基列的拉末去。</p>
<p>And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets,
and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine
hand, and go to Ramothgilead:</p>
<p>9:2
到了那里，要寻梢宁示的孙子，约沙法的儿子耶户，使他从同僚中起来，带他进严密的屋子，</p>
<p>And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from
among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;</p>
<p>9:3
将瓶里的膏油倒在他头上，说，耶和华如此说，我膏你作以色列王。说完了，就开门逃跑，不要迟延。</p>
<p>Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus
saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the
door, and flee, and tarry not.</p>
<p>9:4 于是那少年先知往基列的拉末去了。</p>
<p>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
Ramothgilead.</p>
<p>9:5
到了那里，看见众军长都坐着，就说，将军哪，我有话对你说。耶户说，我们众人里，你要对哪一个说呢。回答说，将军哪，我要对你说。</p>
<p>And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and
he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which
of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</p>
<p>9:6
耶户就起来，进了屋子，少年人将膏油倒在他头上，对他说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，我膏你作耶和华民以色列的王。</p>
<p>And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his
head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have
anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</p>
<p>9:7
你要击杀你主人亚哈的全家，我好在耶洗别身上伸我仆人众先知和耶和华一切仆人流血的冤。</p>
<p>And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge
the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants
of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</p>
<p>9:8
亚哈全家必都灭亡，凡属亚哈的男丁，无论是困住的，自由的，我必从以色列中剪除，</p>
<p>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left
in Israel:</p>
<p>9:9 使亚哈的家像尼八儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅儿子巴沙的家。</p>
<p>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</p>
<p>9:10
耶洗别必在耶斯列田里被狗所吃，无人葬埋。说完了，少年人就开门逃跑了。</p>
<p>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there
shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</p>
<p>9:11
耶户出来，回到他主人的臣仆那里，有一人问他说，平安吗。这狂妄的人来见你有什么事呢。回答说，你们认得那人，也知道他说什么。</p>
<p>Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto
him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said
unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</p>
<p>9:12
他们说，这是假话，你据实地告诉我们。回答说，他如此如此对我说。他说，耶和华如此说，我膏你作以色列王。</p>
<p>And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus
spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king
over Israel.</p>
<p>9:13
他们就急忙各将自己的衣服铺在上层台阶，使耶户坐在其上。他们吹角，说，耶户作王了。</p>
<p>Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under
him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is
king.</p>
<p>9:14
这样，宁示的孙子，约沙法的儿子耶户背叛约兰。先是约兰和以色列众人因为亚兰王哈薛的缘故，把守基列的拉末。</p>
<p>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against
Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of
Hazael king of Syria.</p>
<p>9:15
但约兰王回到耶斯列，医治与亚兰王哈薛打仗所受的伤。耶户说，若合你们的意思，就不容人逃出城往耶斯列报信去。</p>
<p>But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of
Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor
escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</p>
<p>9:16
于是耶户坐车往耶斯列去，因为约兰病卧在那里。犹大王亚哈谢已经下去看望他。</p>
<p>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.
And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</p>
<p>9:17
有一个守望的人站在耶斯列的楼上，看见耶户带着一群人来，就说，我看见一群人。约兰说，打发一个骑马的去迎接他们，问说，平安不平安。</p>
<p>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the
company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said,
Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it
peace?</p>
<p>9:18
骑马的就去迎接耶户，说，王问说，平安不平安。耶户说，平安不平安与你何干。你转在我后头吧。守望的人又说，使者到了他们那里，却不回来。</p>
<p>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the
king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn
thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to
them, but he cometh not again.</p>
<p>9:19
王又打发一个骑马的去。这人到了他们那里，说，王问说，平安不平安。耶户说，平安不平安与你何干。你转在我后头吧。</p>
<p>Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said,
Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to
do with peace? turn thee behind me.</p>
<p>9:20
守望的人又说，他到了他们那里，也不回来。车赶得甚猛，像宁示的孙子耶户的赶法。</p>
<p>And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not
again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi;
for he driveth furiously.</p>
<p>9:21
约兰吩咐说，套车。人就给他套车。以色列王约兰和犹大王亚哈谢各坐自己的车出去迎接耶户，在耶斯列人拿伯的田那里遇见他。</p>
<p>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram
king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot,
and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the
Jezreelite.</p>
<p>9:22
约兰见耶户就说，耶户阿，平安吗。耶户说，你母亲耶洗别的淫行邪术这样多，焉能平安呢。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace,
Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy
mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</p>
<p>9:23 约兰就转车逃跑，对亚哈谢说，亚哈谢阿，反了。</p>
<p>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is
treachery, O Ahaziah.</p>
<p>9:24
耶户开满了弓，射中约兰的脊背，箭从心窝穿出，约兰就仆倒在车上。</p>
<p>And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between
his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his
chariot.</p>
<p>9:25
耶户对他的军长毕甲说，你把他抛在耶斯列人拿伯的田间。你当追想，你我一同坐车跟随他父亚哈的时候，耶和华对亚哈所说的预言，</p>
<p>Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the
portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that,
when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this
burden upon him;</p>
<p>9:26
说，我昨日看见拿伯的血和他众子的血，我必在这块田上报应你。这是耶和华说的，现在你要照着耶和华的话，把他抛在这田间。</p>
<p>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of
his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith
the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground,
according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>9:27
犹大王亚哈谢见这光景，就从园亭之路逃跑。耶户追赶他，说，把这人也杀在车上。到了靠近以伯莲的姑珥坡上击伤了他。他逃到米吉多，就死在那里。</p>
<p>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of
the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also
in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by
Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</p>
<p>9:28
他的臣仆用车将他的尸首送到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他自己的坟墓里，与他列祖同葬。</p>
<p>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried
him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p>9:29 亚哈谢登基作犹大王的时候，是在亚哈的儿子约兰第十一年。</p>
<p>And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to
reign over Judah.</p>
<p>9:30 耶户到了耶斯列。耶洗别听见就擦粉，梳头，从窗户里往外观看。</p>
<p>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</p>
<p>9:31 耶户进门的时候，耶洗别说，杀主人的心利阿，平安吗。</p>
<p>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who
slew his master?</p>
<p>9:32
耶户抬头向窗户观看，说，谁顺从我。有两三个太监从窗户往外看他。</p>
<p>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?
who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</p>
<p>9:33
耶户说，把她扔下来。他们就把她扔下来。她的血溅在墙上和马上。于是把她践踏了。</p>
<p>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her
blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her
under foot.</p>
<p>9:34
耶户进去，吃了喝了，吩咐说，你们把这被咒诅的妇人葬埋了，因为她是王的女儿。</p>
<p>And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now
this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter.</p>
<p>9:35 他们就去葬埋她，只寻得她的头骨和脚，并手掌。</p>
<p>And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the
skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</p>
<p>9:36
他们回去告诉耶户，耶户说，这正应验耶和华藉他仆人提斯比人以利亚所说的话，说，在耶斯列田间，狗必吃耶洗别的肉。</p>
<p>Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the
word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of
Jezebel:</p>
<p>9:37 耶洗别的尸首必在耶斯列田间如同粪土，甚至人不能说这是耶洗别。</p>
<p>And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is
Jezebel.</p>
