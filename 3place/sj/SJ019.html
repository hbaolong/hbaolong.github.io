<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第19-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第19 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>19:1
那两个天使晚上到了所多玛。罗得正坐在所多玛城门口，看见他们，就起来迎接，脸伏于地下拜，</p>
<p>And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate
of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself
with his face toward the ground;</p>
<p>19:2
说，我主阿，请你们到仆人家里洗洗脚，住一夜，清早起来再走。他们说，不，我们要在街上过夜。</p>
<p>And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your
servant’s house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall
rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will
abide in the street all night.</p>
<p>19:3
罗得切切地请他们，他们这才进去，到他屋里。罗得为他们预备筵席，烤无酵饼，他们就吃了。</p>
<p>And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and
entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake
unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>
<p>19:4
他们还没有躺下，所多玛城里各处的人，连老带少，都来围住那房子，</p>
<p>But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom,
compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every
quarter:</p>
<p>19:5
呼叫罗得说，今日晚上到你这里来的人在哪里呢。把他们带出来，任我们所为。</p>
<p>And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which
came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know
them.</p>
<p>19:6 罗得出来，把门关上，到众人那里，</p>
<p>And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after
him,</p>
<p>19:7 说，众弟兄，请你们不要作这恶事。</p>
<p>And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>
<p>19:8
<strong>我有两个女儿，还是处女，容我领出来，任凭你们的心愿而行。只是这两个人既然到我舍下，不要向他们作什么。</strong></p>
<p>Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I
pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your
eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the
shadow of my roof.</p>
<p>19:9
众人说，退去吧。又说，这个人来寄居，还想要作官哪。<strong>现在我们要害你比害他们更甚。</strong>众人就向前拥挤罗得，要攻破房门。</p>
<p>And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came
in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with
thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and
came near to break the door.</p>
<p>19:10 只是那二人伸出手来，将罗得拉进屋去，把门关上，</p>
<p>But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to
them, and shut to the door.</p>
<p>19:11
并且使门外的人，无论老少，眼都昏迷。他们摸来摸去，总寻不着房门。</p>
<p>And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find
the door.</p>
<p>19:12
二人对罗得说，你这里还有什么人吗。无论是女婿是儿女，和这城中一切属你的人，你都要将他们从这地方带出去。</p>
<p>And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law,
and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city,
bring them out of this place:</p>
<p>19:13
<strong>我们要毁灭这地方。因为城内罪恶的声音在耶和华面前甚大，耶和华差我们来，要毁灭这地方。</strong></p>
<p>For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen
great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy
it.</p>
<p>19:14
罗得就出去，告诉娶了（或作将要娶）他女儿的女婿们说，你们起来离开这地方，因为耶和华要毁灭这城。他女婿们却以为他说的是戏言。</p>
<p>And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his
daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will
destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in
law.</p>
<p>19:15
天明了，天使催逼罗得说，起来，带着你的妻子和你在这里的两个女儿出去，免得你因这城里的罪恶同被剿灭。</p>
<p>And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying,
Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou
be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>
<p>19:16
但罗得迟延不走。二人因为耶和华怜恤罗得，就拉着他的手和他妻子的手，并他两个女儿的手，把他们领出来，安置在城外。</p>
<p>And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the
hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being
merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the
city.</p>
<p>19:17
领他们出来以后，就说，<strong>逃命吧。不可回头看，也不可在平原站住。要往山上逃跑，免得你被剿灭。</strong></p>
<p>And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he
said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in
all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.</p>
<p>19:18 罗得对他们说，我主阿，不要如此，</p>
<p>And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:</p>
<p>19:19
你仆人已经在你眼前蒙恩。你又向我显出莫大的慈爱，救我的性命。我不能逃到山上去，恐怕这灾祸临到我，我便死了。</p>
<p>Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast
magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life;
and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I
die:</p>
<p>19:20
看哪，这座城又小又近，容易逃到，这不是一个小的吗。求你容我逃到那里，我的性命就得存活。</p>
<p>Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one:
Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall
live.</p>
<p>19:21 天使对他说，这事我也应允你。我不倾覆你所说的这城。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing
also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast
spoken.</p>
<p>19:22
你要速速地逃到那城。因为你还没有到那里，我不能作什么。因此那城名叫琐珥（琐珥就是小的意思）。</p>
<p>Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be
come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.</p>
<p>19:23 罗得到了琐珥，日头已经出来了。</p>
<p>The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>
<p>19:24
当时，<strong>耶和华将硫磺与火从天上耶和华那里降与所多玛和蛾摩拉，</strong></p>
<p>Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire
from the LORD out of heaven;</p>
<p>19:25
把那些城和全平原，并城里所有的居民，连地上生长的，都毁灭了。</p>
<p>And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</p>
<p>19:26
<strong>罗得的妻子在后边回头一看，就变成了一根盐柱。</strong></p>
<p>But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of
salt.</p>
<p>19:27 亚伯拉罕清早起来，到了他从前站在耶和华面前的地方，</p>
<p>And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood
before the LORD:</p>
<p>19:28
向所多玛和蛾摩拉与平原的全地观看，不料，那地方烟气上腾，如同烧窑一般。</p>
<p>And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of
the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the
smoke of a furnace.</p>
<p>19:29
当神毁灭平原诸城的时候，他记念亚伯拉罕，正在倾覆罗得所住之城的时候，就打发罗得从倾覆之中出来。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that
God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow,
when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.</p>
<p>19:30
罗得因为怕住在琐珥，就同他两个女儿从琐珥上去，住在山里。他和两个女儿住在一个洞里。</p>
<p>And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two
daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a
cave, he and his two daughters.</p>
<p>19:31
<strong>大女儿对小女儿说，我们的父亲老了，地上又无人按着世上的常规进到我们这里。</strong></p>
<p>And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there
is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the
earth:</p>
<p>19:32
来，我们可以叫父亲喝酒，与他同寝。这样，我们好从他存留后裔。</p>
<p>Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,
that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>
<p>19:33
于是，那夜她们叫父亲喝酒，大女儿就进去和她父亲同寝。她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。</p>
<p>And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn
went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay
down, nor when she arose.</p>
<p>19:34
第二天，大女儿对小女儿说，我昨夜与父亲同寝。今夜我们再叫他喝酒，你可以进去与他同寝。这样，我们好从父亲存留后裔。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the
younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink
wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may
preserve seed of our father.</p>
<p>19:35
于是，那夜她们又叫父亲喝酒，小女儿起来与她父亲同寝。她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。</p>
<p>And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down,
nor when she arose.</p>
<p>19:36 这样，<strong>罗得的两个女儿都从她父亲怀了孕。</strong></p>
<p>Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.</p>
<p>19:37 大女儿生了儿子，给他起名叫摩押，就是现今摩押人的始祖。</p>
<p>And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is
the father of the Moabites unto this day.</p>
<p>19:38 小女儿也生了儿子，给他起名叫便亚米，就是现今亚扪人的始祖。</p>
<p>And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi:
the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.</p>
