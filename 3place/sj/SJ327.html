<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-14-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 14 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>14:1
以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施第二年，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢登基。</p>
<p>In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned
Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.</p>
<p>14:2
他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫约耶但，是耶路撒冷人。</p>
<p>He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned
twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan
of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14:3
亚玛谢行耶和华眼中看为正的事，但不如他祖大卫，乃效法他父约阿施一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not
like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his
father did.</p>
<p>14:4 只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。</p>
<p>Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did
sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.</p>
<p>14:5 国一坚定，就把杀他父王的臣仆杀了，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.</p>
<p>14:6
却没有治死杀王之人的儿子，是照摩西律法书上耶和华所吩咐的说，不可因子杀父，也不可因父杀子，各人要为本身的罪而死。</p>
<p>But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that
which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD
commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the
children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every
man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>
<p>14:7
亚玛谢在盐谷杀了以东人一万，又攻取了西拉，改名叫约帖，直到今日。</p>
<p>He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by
war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</p>
<p>14:8
那时，亚玛谢差遣使者去见耶户的孙子约哈斯的儿子以色列王约阿施，说，你来，我们二人相见于战场。</p>
<p>Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of
Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the
face.</p>
<p>14:9
以色列王约阿施差遣使者去见犹大王亚玛谢，说，黎巴嫩的蒺藜差遣使者去见黎巴嫩的香柏树，说，将你的女儿给我儿子为妻。后来黎巴嫩有一个野兽经过，把蒺藜践踏了。</p>
<p>And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying,
The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon,
saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild
beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p>
<p>14:10
你打败了以东人就心高气傲，你以此为荣耀，在家里安居就吧了，为何要惹祸，使自己和犹大国一同败亡呢。</p>
<p>Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up:
glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy
hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
<p>14:11
亚玛谢却不肯听这话。于是以色列王约阿施上来，在犹大的伯示麦与犹大王亚玛谢相见于战场。</p>
<p>But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up;
and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at
Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>
<p>14:12 犹大人败在以色列人面前，各自逃回家里去了。</p>
<p>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man
to their tents.</p>
<p>14:13
以色列王约阿施在伯示麦擒住亚哈谢的孙子，约阿施的儿子犹大王亚玛谢，就来到耶路撒冷，拆毁耶路撒冷的城墙，从以法莲门直到角门共四百肘，</p>
<p>And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of
Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and
brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the
corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p>
<p>14:14
又将耶和华殿里与王宫府库里所有的金银和器皿都拿了去，并带人去为质，就回撒马利亚去了。</p>
<p>And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were
found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s
house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p>14:15
约阿施其馀所行的事和他的勇力，并与犹大王亚玛谢争战的事，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and
how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the
book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>14:16
约阿施与他列祖同睡，葬在撒马利亚，以色列诸王的坟地里。他儿子耶罗波安接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with
the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>14:17
以色列王约哈斯的儿子约阿施死后，犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢又活了十五年。</p>
<p>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of
Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p>
<p>14:18 亚玛谢其馀的事都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book
of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>14:19
耶路撒冷有人背叛亚玛谢，他就逃到拉吉。叛党却打发人到拉吉将他杀了。</p>
<p>Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to
Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</p>
<p>14:20 人就用马将他的尸首驮到耶路撒冷，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。</p>
<p>And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with
his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p>14:21
犹大众民立亚玛谢的儿子亚撒利雅（又名乌西雅）接续他父作王，那时他年十六岁。</p>
<p>And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen years
old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</p>
<p>14:22
亚玛谢与他列祖同睡之后，亚撒利雅收回以拉他仍归犹大，又重新修理。</p>
<p>He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
with his fathers.</p>
<p>14:23
犹大王约阿施的儿子亚玛谢十五年，以色列王约阿施的儿子耶罗波安在撒马利亚登基，作王四十一年。</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and
reigned forty and one years.</p>
<p>14:24
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的一切罪。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to
sin.</p>
<p>14:25
他收回以色列边界之地，从哈马口直到亚拉巴海，正如耶和华以色列的神，藉他仆人迦特希弗人亚米太的儿子先知约拿所说的。</p>
<p>He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the
sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which
he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the
prophet, which was of Gathhepher.</p>
<p>14:26
因为耶和华看见以色列人甚是艰苦，无论困住的，自由的都没有了，也无人帮助以色列人。</p>
<p>For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter:
for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for
Israel.</p>
<p>14:27
耶和华并没有说要将以色列的名从天下涂抹，乃藉约阿施的儿子耶罗波安拯救他们。</p>
<p>And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from
under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of
Joash.</p>
<p>14:28
耶罗波安其馀的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，他怎样争战，怎样收回大马士革和先前属犹大的哈马归以色列，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his
might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which
belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>14:29 耶罗波安与他列祖以色列诸王同睡。他儿子撒迦利雅接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel;
and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
