<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-23-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 23 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>23:1 耶和华的话又临到我说，</p>
<p>The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,</p>
<p>23:2 人子阿，有两个女子，是一母所生，</p>
<p>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</p>
<p>23:3
她们在埃及行邪淫，在幼年时行邪淫。她们在那里作处女的时候，有人拥抱她们的怀，抚摸她们的乳。</p>
<p>And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in
their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised
the teats of their virginity.</p>
<p>23:4
她们的名字，姊姊名叫阿荷拉，妹妹名叫阿荷利巴。她们都归于我，生了儿女。论到她们的名字，阿荷拉就是撒马利亚，阿荷利巴就是耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister:
and they were mine, and they bare sons and daughters. Thus were their
names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</p>
<p>23:5 阿荷拉归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人。</p>
<p>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her
lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbours,</p>
<p>23:6 这些人都穿蓝衣，作省长，副省长，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。</p>
<p>Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them
desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</p>
<p>23:7
阿荷拉就与亚述人中最美的男子放纵淫行，她因所恋爱之人的一切偶像，玷污自己。</p>
<p>Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all them that were
the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all
their idols she defiled herself.</p>
<p>23:8
自从在埃及的时候，她就没有离开淫乱，因为她年幼作处女的时候，埃及人与她行淫，抚摸她的乳，纵欲与她行淫。</p>
<p>Neither left she her whoredoms brought from Egypt: for in her youth
they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and
poured their whoredom upon her.</p>
<p>23:9 因此，我将她交在她所爱的人手中，就是她所恋爱的亚述人手中。</p>
<p>Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the
hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</p>
<p>23:10
他们就露了她的下体，掳掠她的儿女，用刀杀了她，使她在妇女中留下臭名，因他们向她施行审判。</p>
<p>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters,
and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they
had executed judgment upon her.</p>
<p>23:11
她妹妹阿荷利巴虽然看见了，却还贪恋，比她姊姊更丑。行淫乱比她姊姊更多。</p>
<p>And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her
inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in
her whoredoms.</p>
<p>23:12
她贪恋邻邦的亚述人，就是穿极华美的衣服，骑着马的省长，副省长，都是可爱的少年人。</p>
<p>She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers
clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them
desirable young men.</p>
<p>23:13 我看见她被玷污了，她姊妹二人同行一路。</p>
<p>Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</p>
<p>23:14
阿荷利巴又加增淫行，因她看见人像画在墙上，就是用丹色所画迦勒底人的像，</p>
<p>And that she increased her whoredoms: for when she saw men pourtrayed
upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with
vermilion,</p>
<p>23:15
腰间系着带子，头上有下垂的裹头巾，都是军长的形状，仿照巴比伦人的形像。他们的故土就是迦勒底。</p>
<p>Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon
their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the
Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</p>
<p>23:16 阿荷利巴一看见就贪恋他们，打发使者往迦勒底去见他们。</p>
<p>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted upon them, and
sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</p>
<p>23:17
巴比伦人就来登她爱情的床，与她行淫玷污她。她被玷污，随后心里与他们生疏。</p>
<p>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they
defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her
mind was alienated from them.</p>
<p>23:18
这样，她显露淫行，又显露下体。我心就与她生疏，像先前与她姊姊生疏一样。</p>
<p>So she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness: then
my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her
sister.</p>
<p>23:19 她还加增她的淫行，追念她幼年在埃及地行邪淫的日子，</p>
<p>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, in calling to remembrance the days
of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of
Egypt.</p>
<p>23:20 贪恋情人身壮精足，如驴如马。</p>
<p>For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of
asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</p>
<p>23:21
这样，你就想起你幼年的淫行。那时，埃及人拥抱你的怀，抚摸你的乳。</p>
<p>Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in
bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the paps of thy youth.</p>
<p>23:22
阿荷利巴阿，主耶和华如此说，我必激动你先爱而后生疏的人来攻击你。我必使他们来，在你四围攻击你。</p>
<p>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise
up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will
bring them against thee on every side;</p>
<p>23:23
所来的就是巴比伦人，迦勒底的众人，比割人，书亚人，哥亚人，同着他们的还有亚述众人，乃是作省长，副省长，作军长有名声的，都骑着马，是可爱的少年人。</p>
<p>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and
all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains
and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon
horses.</p>
<p>23:24
他们必带兵器，战车，辎重车，率领大众来攻击你。他们要拿大小盾牌，顶盔摆阵，在你四围攻击你。我要将审判的事交给他们，他们必按着自己的条例审判你。</p>
<p>And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels,
and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and
shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and
they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</p>
<p>23:25
我必以忌恨攻击你。他们必以忿怒办你。他们必割去你的鼻子和耳朵。你遗留（或作馀剩下同）的人必倒在刀下。他们必掳去你的儿女。你所遗留的必被火焚烧。</p>
<p>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal
furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and
thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy
daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</p>
<p>23:26 他们必剥去你的衣服，夺取你华美的宝器。</p>
<p>They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes, and take away thy fair
jewels.</p>
<p>23:27
这样，我必使你的淫行和你从埃及地染来的淫乱止息了，使你不再仰望亚述，也不再追念埃及。</p>
<p>Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom
brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thine
eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</p>
<p>23:28
主耶和华如此说，我必将你交在你所恨恶的人手中，就是你心与他生疏的人手中。</p>
<p>For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the
hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind
is alienated:</p>
<p>23:29
他们必以恨恶办你，夺取你一切劳碌得来的，留下你赤身露体。你淫乱的下体，连你的淫行，带你的淫乱，都被显露。</p>
<p>And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy
labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy
whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</p>
<p>23:30
人必向你行这些事。因为你随从外邦人行邪淫，被他们的偶像玷污了。</p>
<p>I will do these things unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring
after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</p>
<p>23:31 你走了你姊姊所走的路，所以我必将她的杯交在你手中。</p>
<p>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her
cup into thine hand.</p>
<p>23:32
主耶和华如此说，你必喝你姊姊所喝的杯。那杯又深又广，盛得甚多，使你被人嗤笑讥刺。</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep
and large: thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it
containeth much.</p>
<p>23:33
你必酩酊大醉，满有愁苦，喝乾你姊姊撒马利亚的杯，就是令人惊骇凄凉的杯。</p>
<p>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of
astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</p>
<p>23:34
你必喝这杯，以致喝尽。杯破又龈杯片，撕裂自己的乳。因为这事我曾说过。这是主耶和华说的。</p>
<p>Thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt break the
sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it,
saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>23:35
主耶和华如此说，因你忘记我，将我丢在背后，所以你要担当你淫行和淫乱的报应。</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me,
and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and
thy whoredoms.</p>
<p>23:36
耶和华又对我说，人子阿，你要审问阿荷拉与阿荷利巴吗。当指出她们所行可憎的事。</p>
<p>The LORD said moreover unto me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah
and Aholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations;</p>
<p>23:37
她们行淫，手中有杀人的血，又与偶像行淫，并使她们为我所生的儿女经火烧给偶像。</p>
<p>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and
with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused
their sons, whom they bare unto me, to pass for them through the fire,
to devour them.</p>
<p>23:38
此外，她们还有向我所行的，就是同日玷污我的圣所，干犯我的安息日。</p>
<p>Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary
in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</p>
<p>23:39
她们杀了儿女献与偶像，当天又入我的圣所，将圣所亵渎了。她们在我殿中所行的乃是如此。</p>
<p>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came
the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, thus have they
done in the midst of mine house.</p>
<p>23:40
况且你们二妇打发使者去请远方人。使者到他们那里，他们就来了。你们为他们沭浴己身，粉饰眼目，佩戴妆饰，</p>
<p>And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto
whom a messenger was sent; and, lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash
thyself, paintedst thy eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments,</p>
<p>23:41 坐在华美的床上，前面摆设桌案，将我的香料膏油摆在其上。</p>
<p>And satest upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it,
whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil.</p>
<p>23:42
在那里有群众安逸欢乐的声音，并有粗俗的人和酒徒从旷野同来，把镯子戴在二妇的手上，把华冠戴在她们的头上。</p>
<p>And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the
men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which
put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their
heads.</p>
<p>23:43
我论这行淫衰老的妇人说，现在人还要与她行淫，她也要与人行淫。</p>
<p>Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit
whoredoms with her, and she with them?</p>
<p>23:44 人与阿荷拉，并阿荷利巴二淫妇苟合，好像与妓女苟合。</p>
<p>Yet they went in unto her, as they go in unto a woman that playeth
the harlot: so went they in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd
women.</p>
<p>23:45
必有义人，照审判淫妇和流人血的妇人之例，审判她们。因为她们是淫妇，手中有杀人的血。</p>
<p>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of
adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because
they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</p>
<p>23:46
主耶和华如此说，我必使多人来攻击她们，使她们抛来抛去，被人抢夺。</p>
<p>For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and
will give them to be removed and spoiled.</p>
<p>23:47
这些人必用石头打死她们，用刀剑杀害她们，又杀戮她们的儿女，用火焚烧她们的房屋。</p>
<p>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with
their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn
up their houses with fire.</p>
<p>23:48
这样，我必使淫行从境内止息，好叫一切妇人都受警戒，不效法你们的淫行。</p>
<p>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women
may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</p>
<p>23:49
人必照着你们的淫行报应你们。你们要担当拜偶像的罪，就知道我是主耶和华。</p>
<p>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear
the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</p>
