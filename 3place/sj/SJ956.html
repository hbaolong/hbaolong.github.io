<h4 id="新约-马太福音matthew-第-27-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 –
马太福音(Matthew) – 第 27 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>27:1 到了早晨，众祭司长和民间的长老，大家商议，要治死耶稣。</p>
<p>When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of the
people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>
<p>27:2 就把他捆绑解去交给巡抚彼拉多。</p>
<p>And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to
Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>
<p>27:3
这时候，卖耶稣的犹大，看见耶稣已经定了罪，就后悔，把那三十块钱，拿回来给祭司长和长老说，</p>
<p>Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of
silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>
<p>27:4
我卖了无辜之人的血，是有罪了。他们说，他们说，那与我们有什么相干。你自己承当吧。</p>
<p>Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And
they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</p>
<p>27:5 犹大就把那银钱丢在殿里，出去吊死了。</p>
<p>And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and departed,
and went and hanged himself.</p>
<p>27:6 祭司长拾起银钱来说，这是血价，不可放在库里。</p>
<p>And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not
lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of
blood.</p>
<p>27:7 他们商议，就用那银钱买了窑户的一块田，为要埋葬外乡人。</p>
<p>And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to
bury strangers in.</p>
<p>27:8 所以那块田，直到今日还叫作血田。</p>
<p>Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this
day.</p>
<p>27:9
这就应了先知耶利米的话，说，他们用那三十块钱，就是被估定之人的价钱，是以色列人中所估定的，</p>
<p>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that
was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;</p>
<p>27:10 买了窑户的一块田。这是照着主所吩咐我的。</p>
<p>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</p>
<p>27:11
耶稣站在巡抚面前，巡抚问他说，你是犹太人的王吗。耶稣说，你说的是。</p>
<p>And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,
saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou
sayest.</p>
<p>27:12 他被祭司长和长老控告的时候什么都不回答。</p>
<p>And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he answered
nothing.</p>
<p>27:13 彼拉多就对他说，他们作见证，告你这吗多的事，你没有听见吗。</p>
<p>Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they
witness against thee?</p>
<p>27:14 耶稣仍不回答，连一句话也不说，以致巡抚甚觉希奇。</p>
<p>And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the governor
marvelled greatly.</p>
<p>27:15
巡抚有一个常例，每逢这节期，随众人所要的，释放一个囚犯给他们。</p>
<p>Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a
prisoner, whom they would.</p>
<p>27:16 当时，有一个出名的囚犯叫巴拉巴。</p>
<p>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>
<p>27:17
众人聚集的时候，彼拉多就对他们说，你们要我释放那一个给你们。是巴拉巴呢。是称为基督的耶稣呢。</p>
<p>Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them,
Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which is called
Christ?</p>
<p>27:18 巡抚原知道，他们是因为嫉妒才把他解了来。</p>
<p>For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>
<p>27:19
正坐堂的时候，他的夫人打发人来说，这义人的事，你一点不可管。因为我今天在梦中，为他受了许多的苦。</p>
<p>When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him,
saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>
<p>27:20 祭司长和长老，挑唆众人，求释放巴拉巴，除灭耶稣。</p>
<p>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they
should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>
<p>27:21
巡抚对众人说，这两个人，你们要我释放那一个给你们呢。他们说，巴拉巴。</p>
<p>The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain will
ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>
<p>27:22
彼拉多说，这样，那称为基督的耶稣，我怎吗办他呢。他们说，把他钉十字架。</p>
<p>Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is
called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>27:23
巡抚说，为什么呢，他作了什么恶事呢。他们便极力的喊着说，把他钉十字架。</p>
<p>And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried
out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>
<p>27:24
彼拉多见说也无济于事，反要生乱，就拿水在众人面前洗手，说，流这义人的血，罪不在我，你们承当吧。</p>
<p>When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a
tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the
multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see
ye to it.</p>
<p>27:25 众人都回答说，他的血归到我们，和我们的子孙身上。</p>
<p>Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on
our children.</p>
<p>27:26 于是彼拉多释放巴拉巴给他们，把耶稣鞭打了，交给人钉十字架。</p>
<p>Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged Jesus,
he delivered him to be crucified.</p>
<p>27:27 巡抚的兵就把耶稣带进衙门，叫全营的兵都聚集在他那里。</p>
<p>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall,
and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</p>
<p>27:28 他们给他脱了衣服，穿上一件朱红色袍子。</p>
<p>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>
<p>27:29
用荆棘编作冠冕，戴在他头上，拿一根苇子放在他右手里。跪在他面前戏弄他说，恭喜犹太人的王阿。</p>
<p>And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his
head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him,
and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p>27:30 又吐唾沫在他脸上，拿苇子打他的头。</p>
<p>And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the
head.</p>
<p>27:31
戏弄完了，就给他脱了袍子，仍穿上他自己的衣服，带他出去，要钉十字架。</p>
<p>And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him,
and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</p>
<p>27:32
他们出来的时候，遇见一个古利奈人，名叫西门，就勉强他同去，好背着耶稣的十字架。</p>
<p>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him
they compelled to bear his cross.</p>
<p>27:33 到了一个地方，名叫各各他，意思就是髑髅地。</p>
<p>And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say,
a place of a skull,</p>
<p>27:34 兵丁拿苦胆调和的酒，给耶稣喝。他尝了，就不肯喝。</p>
<p>They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had
tasted thereof, he would not drink.</p>
<p>27:35 他们既将他钉在十字架上，就拈阄分他的衣服。</p>
<p>And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that
it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my
garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</p>
<p>27:36 又坐在那里看守他。</p>
<p>And sitting down they watched him there;</p>
<p>27:37
在他头以上，安一个牌子，写着他的罪状，说，这是犹太人的王耶稣。</p>
<p>And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE
KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>27:38 当时，有两个强盗，和他同钉十字架，一个在右边，一个在左边。</p>
<p>Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right
hand, and another on the left.</p>
<p>27:39 从那里经过的人，讥诮他，摇着头说，</p>
<p>And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>
<p>27:40
你这拆毁圣殿，三日又建造起来的，可以救自己吧。你如果是神的儿子，就从十字架上下来吧。</p>
<p>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the
cross.</p>
<p>27:41 祭司长和文士并长老，也是这样戏弄他，说，</p>
<p>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
elders, said,</p>
<p>27:42
他救了别人，不能救自己。他是以色列的王，现在可以从十字架上下来，我们就信他。</p>
<p>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel,
let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</p>
<p>27:43
他倚靠神，神若喜悦他，现在可以救他。因为他曾说，我是神的儿子。</p>
<p>He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for
he said, I am the Son of God.</p>
<p>27:44 那和他同钉的强盗，也是这样的讥诮他。</p>
<p>The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same in his
teeth.</p>
<p>27:45 从午正到申初，遍地都黑暗了。</p>
<p>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the
ninth hour.</p>
<p>27:46
约在申初，耶稣大声喊着说，以利，以利，拉马撒巴各大尼。就是说，我的神，我的神，为什么离弃我。</p>
<p>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli,
Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou
forsaken me?</p>
<p>27:47 站在那里的人，有的听见就说，这个人呼叫以利亚呢。</p>
<p>Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man
calleth for Elias.</p>
<p>27:48
内中有一个人，赶紧跑去，拿海绒蘸满了醋，绑在苇子上，送给他喝。</p>
<p>And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled it
with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>
<p>27:49 其馀的人说，且等着，看以利亚来救他不来。</p>
<p>The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save
him.</p>
<p>27:50 耶稣又大声喊叫，气就断了。</p>
<p>Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the
ghost.</p>
<p>27:51 忽然殿里的幔子，从上到下裂为两半。地也震动。盘石也崩裂。</p>
<p>And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;</p>
<p>27:52 坟墓也开了。已睡圣徒的身体，多有起来的。</p>
<p>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept
arose,</p>
<p>27:53 到耶稣复活以后，他们从坟墓里出来，进了圣城，向许多人显现。</p>
<p>And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the
holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>
<p>27:54
百夫长和一同看守耶稣的人，看见地震，并所经历的事，就极其害怕，说，这真是神的儿子了。</p>
<p>Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jesus,
saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they feared
greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>
<p>27:55
有好些妇女在那里远远的观看。他们是从加利利跟随耶稣来服事他的。</p>
<p>And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed Jesus
from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>
<p>27:56
内中有抹大拉的马利亚，又有雅各和约西的母亲马利亚，并有西庇太两个儿子的母亲。</p>
<p>Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and
Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children.</p>
<p>27:57
到了晚上，有一个财主，名叫约瑟，是亚利马太来的。他也是耶稣的门徒。</p>
<p>When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named
Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple:</p>
<p>27:58 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体。彼拉多就吩咐给他。</p>
<p>He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate
commanded the body to be delivered.</p>
<p>27:59 约瑟取了身体，用乾净细麻布裹好，</p>
<p>And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen
cloth,</p>
<p>27:60
安放在自己的新坟墓里，就是他凿在盘石里的。他又把大石头辊到墓口，就去了。</p>
<p>And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock:
and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre, and
departed.</p>
<p>27:61 有抹大拉的马利亚，和那个马利亚在那里，对着坟墓坐着。</p>
<p>And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over
against the sepulchre.</p>
<p>27:62
次日，就是豫备日的第二天，祭司长和法利赛人聚集，来见彼拉多，说，</p>
<p>Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief
priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>
<p>27:63
大人，我们记得那诱惑人的，还活着的时候，曾说，三日后我要复活。</p>
<p>Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet
alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>
<p>27:64
因此，请吩咐人将坟墓把守妥当，直到第三日。恐怕他的门徒来把他偷了去，就告诉百姓说，他从死里复活了。这样，那后来的迷惑，比先前的更利害了。</p>
<p>Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third
day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and say unto
the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse
than the first.</p>
<p>27:65 彼拉多说，你们有看守的兵。去吧，尽你们所能的，把守妥当。</p>
<p>Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure
as ye can.</p>
<p>27:66 他们就带着看守的兵同去，封了石头，将坟墓把守妥当。</p>
<p>So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and
setting a watch.</p>
