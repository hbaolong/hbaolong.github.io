<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-29-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 29 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>29:1
希西家登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十九年。他母亲名叫亚比雅，是撒迦利雅的女儿。</p>
<p>Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old, and he
reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</p>
<p>29:2 希西家行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
to all that David his father had done.</p>
<p>29:3 元年正月，开了耶和华殿的门，重新修理。</p>
<p>He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the
doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</p>
<p>29:4 他召众祭司和利未人来，聚集在东边的宽阔处，</p>
<p>And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
together into the east street,</p>
<p>29:5
对他们说，利未人哪，当听我说，现在你们要洁净自己，又洁净耶和华你们列祖神的殿，从圣所中除去污秽之物。</p>
<p>And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and
sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the
filthiness out of the holy place.</p>
<p>29:6
我们列祖犯了罪，行耶和华我们神眼中看为恶的事，离弃他，转脸背向他的居所，</p>
<p>For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the
eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away
their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.</p>
<p>29:7 封锁廊门，吹灭灯火，不在圣所中向以色列神烧香，或献燔祭。</p>
<p>Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps,
and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy
place unto the God of Israel.</p>
<p>29:8
因此，耶和华的忿怒临到犹大和耶路撒冷，将其中的人抛来抛去，令人惊骇，嗤笑，正如你们亲眼所见的。</p>
<p>Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he
hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye
see with your eyes.</p>
<p>29:9 所以我们的祖宗倒在刀下，我们的妻子儿女也被掳掠。</p>
<p>For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our
daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</p>
<p>29:10
现在我心中有意与耶和华以色列的神立约，好使他的烈怒转离我们。</p>
<p>Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</p>
<p>29:11
我的众子阿，现在不要懈怠。因为耶和华拣选你们站在他面前事奉他，与他烧香。</p>
<p>My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand
before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn
incense.</p>
<p>29:12
于是，利未人哥辖的子孙，亚玛赛的儿子玛哈，亚撒利雅的儿子约珥。米拉利的子孙，亚伯底的儿子基士，耶哈利勒的儿子亚撒利雅。革顺的子孙，薪玛的儿子约亚，约亚的儿子伊甸；</p>
<p>Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of
Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish
the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the
Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</p>
<p>29:13 以利撒反的子孙申利和耶利。亚萨的子孙撒迦利雅和玛探雅。</p>
<p>And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of
Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:</p>
<p>29:14 希幔的子孙耶歇和示每。耶杜顿的子孙示玛雅和乌薛。</p>
<p>And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of
Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</p>
<p>29:15
起来聚集他们的弟兄，洁净自己，照着王的吩咐，耶和华的命令，进去洁净耶和华的殿。</p>
<p>And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and
came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the
LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:16
祭司进入耶和华的殿要洁净殿，将殿中所有污秽之物搬到耶和华殿的院内，利未人接去，搬到外头汲沦溪边。</p>
<p>And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to
cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the
temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the
Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p>29:17
从正月初一日洁净起，初八日到了耶和华的殿廊，用八日的工夫洁净耶和华的殿，到正月十六日才洁净完了。</p>
<p>Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and
on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so
they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</p>
<p>29:18
于是，他们晋见希西家王，说，我们已将耶和华的全殿和燔祭坛，并坛的一切器皿，陈设饼的桌子，与桌子的一切器皿都洁净了。</p>
<p>Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed
all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the
vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels
thereof.</p>
<p>29:19
并且亚哈斯王在位犯罪的时候所废弃的器皿，我们预备齐全，且洁净了，现今都在耶和华的坛前。</p>
<p>Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away
in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they
are before the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:20 希西家王清早起来，聚集城里的首领都上耶和华的殿。</p>
<p>Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the
city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:21
牵了七只公牛，七只公羊，七只羊羔，七只公山羊，要为国，为殿，为犹大人作赎罪祭。王吩咐亚伦的子孙众祭司，献在耶和华的坛上，</p>
<p>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and
seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the
sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron
to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:22
就宰了公牛，祭司接血洒在坛上，宰了公羊，把血洒在坛上，又宰了羊羔，也把血洒在坛上。</p>
<p>So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and
sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they
sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they
sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</p>
<p>29:23 把那作赎罪祭的公山羊牵到王和会众面前，他们就按手在其上。</p>
<p>And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the
king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</p>
<p>29:24
祭司宰了羊，将血献在坛上作赎罪祭，为以色列众人赎罪，因为王吩咐将燔祭和赎罪祭为以色列众人献上。</p>
<p>And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their
blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king
commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made
for all Israel.</p>
<p>29:25
王又派利未人在耶和华殿中敲钹，鼓瑟，弹琴，乃照大卫和他先见迦得，并先知拿单所吩咐的，就是耶和华藉先知所吩咐的。</p>
<p>And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with
psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and
of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the
commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</p>
<p>29:26 利未人拿大卫的乐器，祭司拿号，一同站立。</p>
<p>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests
with the trumpets.</p>
<p>29:27
希西家吩咐在坛上献燔祭，燔祭一献，就唱赞美耶和华的歌，用号，并用以色列王大卫的乐器相和。</p>
<p>And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar.
And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began also with
the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king of
Israel.</p>
<p>29:28 会众都敬拜，歌唱的歌唱，吹号的吹号，如此直到燔祭献完了。</p>
<p>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the
trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering was
finished.</p>
<p>29:29 献完了祭，王和一切跟随的人都俯伏敬拜。</p>
<p>And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were
present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</p>
<p>29:30
希西家王与众首领又吩咐利未人用大卫和先见亚萨的诗词颂赞耶和华。他们就欢欢喜喜地颂赞耶和华，低头敬拜。</p>
<p>Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to
sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the
seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads
and worshipped.</p>
<p>29:31
希西家说，你们既然归耶和华为圣，就要前来把祭物和感谢祭奉到耶和华殿里。会众就把祭物和感谢祭奉来，凡甘心乐意的也将燔祭奉来。</p>
<p>Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves
unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into
the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and
thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt
offerings.</p>
<p>29:32
会众所奉的燔祭如下，公牛七十只，公羊一百只，羊羔二百只，这都是作燔祭献给耶和华的。</p>
<p>And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two
hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p>
<p>29:33 又有分别为圣之物，公牛六百只，绵羊三千只。</p>
<p>And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand
sheep.</p>
<p>29:34
但祭司太少，不能剥尽燔祭牲的皮，所以他们的弟兄利未人帮助他们，直等燔祭的事完了，又等别的祭司自洁了。因为利未人诚心自洁，胜过祭司。</p>
<p>But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the
burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them,
till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified
themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify
themselves than the priests.</p>
<p>29:35
燔祭和平安祭牲的脂油，并燔祭同献的奠祭甚多。这样，耶和华殿中的事务俱都齐备了（或作就整顿了）。</p>
<p>And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the
peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So
the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p>
<p>29:36 这事办的甚速，希西家和众民都喜乐，是因神为众民所预备的。</p>
<p>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the
people: for the thing was done suddenly.</p>
