<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记下2-samuel-第-17-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记下(2 Samuel) – 第 17 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>17:1
亚希多弗又对押沙龙说，求你准我挑选一万二千人，今夜我就起身追赶大卫，</p>
<p>Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve
thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night:</p>
<p>17:2
趁他疲乏手软，我忽然追上他，使他惊惶。跟随他的民必都逃跑，我就单杀王一人，</p>
<p>And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed, and will
make him afraid: and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I
will smite the king only:</p>
<p>17:3
使众民都归顺你。你所寻梢的人既然死了，众民就如已经归顺你。这样，也都平安无事了。</p>
<p>And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou
seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be in peace.</p>
<p>17:4 押沙龙和以色列的长老都以这话为美。</p>
<p>And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
Israel.</p>
<p>17:5 押沙龙说，要召亚基人户筛来，我们也要听他怎样说。</p>
<p>Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear
likewise what he saith.</p>
<p>17:6
户筛到了押沙龙面前，押沙龙向他说，亚希多弗是如此如此说的，我们照着他的话行可以不可以。若不可，你就说吧。</p>
<p>And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying,
Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do after his saying?
if not; speak thou.</p>
<p>17:7 户筛对押沙龙说，亚希多弗这次所定的谋不善。</p>
<p>And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given
is not good at this time.</p>
<p>17:8
户筛又说，你知道，你父亲和跟随他的人都是勇士，现在他们心里恼怒，如同田野丢崽子的母熊一般，而且你父亲是个战士，必不和民一同住宿。</p>
<p>For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be
mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her
whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge
with the people.</p>
<p>17:9
他现今或藏在坑中或在别处，若有人首先被杀，凡听见的必说，跟随押沙龙的民被杀了。</p>
<p>Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and it
will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that
whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people
that follow Absalom.</p>
<p>17:10
虽有人胆大如狮子，他的心也必消化。因为以色列人都知道你父亲是英雄，跟随他的人也都是勇士。</p>
<p>And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion,
shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty
man, and they which be with him are valiant men.</p>
<p>17:11
依我之计，不如将以色列众人从但直到别是巴，如同海边的沙那样多聚集到你这里来，你也亲自率领他们出战。</p>
<p>Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee,
from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for
multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person.</p>
<p>17:12
这样，我们在何处遇见他，就下到他那里，如同露水下在地上一般，连他带跟随他的人，一个也不留下。</p>
<p>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and
we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and
of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as
one.</p>
<p>17:13
他若进了哪一座城，以色列众人必带绳子去，将那城拉到河里，甚至连一块小石头都不剩下。</p>
<p>Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring
ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be
not one small stone found there.</p>
<p>17:14
押沙龙和以色列众人说，亚基人户筛的计谋比亚希多弗的计谋更好。这是因耶和华定意破坏亚希多弗的良谋，为要降祸与押沙龙。</p>
<p>And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the
Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had
appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that
the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom.</p>
<p>17:15
户筛对祭司撒督和亚比亚他说，亚希多弗为押沙龙和以色列的长老所定的计谋是如此如此，我所定的计谋是如此如此。</p>
<p>Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and
thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus
and thus have I counselled.</p>
<p>17:16
现在你们要急速打发人去，告诉大卫说，今夜不可住在旷野的渡口，务要过河，免得王和跟随他的人都被吞灭。</p>
<p>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this
night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the
king be swallowed up, and all the people that are with him.</p>
<p>17:17
那时，约拿单和亚希玛斯在隐罗结那里等候，不敢进城，恐怕被人看见。有一个使女出来，将这话告诉他们，他们就去报信给大卫王。</p>
<p>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be
seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they
went and told king David.</p>
<p>17:18
然而有一个童子看见他们，就去告诉押沙龙。他们急忙跑到巴户琳某人的家里。那人院中有一口井，他们就下到井里。</p>
<p>Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of
them away quickly, and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, which had a
well in his court; whither they went down.</p>
<p>17:19 那家的妇人用盖盖上井口，又在上头铺上碎麦，事就没有泄漏。</p>
<p>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth, and
spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known.</p>
<p>17:20
押沙龙的仆人来到那家，问妇人说，亚希玛斯和约拿单在哪里。妇人说，他们过了河了。仆人找他们，找不着，就回耶路撒冷去了。</p>
<p>And when Absalom’s servants came to the woman to the house, they
said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They
be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not
find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>17:21
他们走后，二人从井里上来，去告诉大卫王说，亚希多弗如此如此定计害你，你们务要起来，快快过河。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out
of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise,
and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled
against you.</p>
<p>17:22
于是大卫和跟随他的人都起来，过约旦河。到了天亮，无一人不过约旦河的。</p>
<p>Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and they
passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them
that was not gone over Jordan.</p>
<p>17:23
亚希多弗见不依从他的计谋，就备上驴，归回本城。到了家，留下遗言，便吊死了，葬在他父亲的坟墓里。</p>
<p>And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled
his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put
his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in
the sepulchre of his father.</p>
<p>17:24 大卫到了玛哈念，押沙龙和跟随他的以色列人也都过了约旦河。</p>
<p>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and
all the men of Israel with him.</p>
<p>17:25
押沙龙立亚玛撒作元帅，代替约押。亚玛撒是以实玛利人（又作以色列人）以特拉的儿子。以特拉曾与拿辖的女儿亚比该亲近。这亚比该与约押的母亲洗鲁雅是姊妹。</p>
<p>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which
Amasa was a man’s son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in
to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab’s mother.</p>
<p>17:26 押沙龙和以色列人都安营在基列地。</p>
<p>So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>17:27
大卫到了玛哈念，亚扪族的拉巴人拿辖的儿子朔比，罗底巴人亚米利的儿子玛吉，基列的罗基琳人巴西莱，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the
son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of
Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</p>
<p>17:28
带着被，褥，盆，碗，瓦器，小麦，大麦，麦面，炒谷，豆子，红豆，炒豆，</p>
<p>Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley,
and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles, and parched
pulse,</p>
<p>17:29
蜂蜜，奶油，绵羊，奶饼，供给大卫和跟随他的人吃。他们说，民在旷野，必饥渴困乏了。</p>
<p>And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and
for the people that were with him, to eat: for they said, The people is
hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</p>
