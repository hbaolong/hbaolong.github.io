<h4 id="旧约-出埃及记exodus-第-32-章-本篇共有-40-章">旧约 –
出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 32 章 ( 本篇共有 40 章 )</h4>
<p>32:1
百姓见摩西迟延不下山，就大家聚集到亚伦那里，对他说，起来，为我们作神像，可以在我们前面引路，因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。</p>
<p>And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the
mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto
him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses,
the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is
become of him.</p>
<p>32:2 亚伦对他们说，你们去摘下你们妻子，儿女耳上的金环，拿来给我。</p>
<p>And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in
the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring
them unto me.</p>
<p>32:3 百姓就都摘下他们耳上的金环，拿来给亚伦。</p>
<p>And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their
ears, and brought them unto Aaron.</p>
<p>32:4
亚伦从他们手里接过来，铸了一只牛犊，用雕刻的器具作成。他们就说，以色列阿，这是领你出埃及地的神。</p>
<p>And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving
tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy
gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>32:5 亚伦看见，就在牛犊面前筑坛，且宣告说，明日要向耶和华守节。</p>
<p>And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made
proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.</p>
<p>32:6 次日清早，百姓起来献燔祭和平安祭，就坐下吃喝，起来玩耍。</p>
<p>And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings,
and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to
drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<p>32:7
耶和华吩咐摩西说，下去吧，因为你的百姓，就是你从埃及地领出来的，已经败坏了。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people,
which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted
themselves:</p>
<p>32:8
他们快快偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸了一只牛犊，向它下拜献祭，说，以色列阿，这就是领你出埃及地的神。</p>
<p>They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have
brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>32:9 耶和华对摩西说，我看这百姓真是硬着颈项的百姓。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold,
it is a stiffnecked people:</p>
<p>32:10
你且由着我，我要向他们发烈怒，将他们灭绝，使你的后裔成为大国。</p>
<p>Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them,
and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.</p>
<p>32:11
摩西便恳求耶和华他的神说，耶和华阿，你为什么向你的百姓发烈怒呢，这百姓是你用大力和大能的手从埃及地领出来的。</p>
<p>And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy
wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of
the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p>
<p>32:12
为什么使埃及人议论说，他领他们出去，是要降祸与他们，把他们杀在山中，将他们从地上除灭。求你转意，不发你的烈怒，后悔，不降祸与你的百姓。</p>
<p>Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he
bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from
the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this
evil against thy people.</p>
<p>32:13
求你记念你的仆人亚伯拉罕，以撒，以色列。你曾指着自己起誓说，我必使你们的后裔像天上的星那样多，并且我所应许的这全地，必给你们的后裔，他们要永远承受为业。</p>
<p>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou
swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your
seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of
will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</p>
<p>32:14 于是耶和华后悔，不把所说的祸降与他的百姓。</p>
<p>And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
people.</p>
<p>32:15
摩西转身下山，手里拿着两块法版。这版是两面写的，这面那面都有字，</p>
<p>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of
the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their
sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</p>
<p>32:16 是神的工作，字是神写的，刻在版上。</p>
<p>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing
of God, graven upon the tables.</p>
<p>32:17
约书亚一听见百姓呼喊的声音，就对摩西说，在营里有争战的声音。</p>
<p>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he
said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</p>
<p>32:18
摩西说，这不是人打胜仗的声音，也不是人打败仗的声音，我所听见的乃是人歌唱的声音。</p>
<p>And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery,
neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the
noise of them that sing do I hear.</p>
<p>32:19
摩西挨近营前就看见牛犊，又看见人跳舞，便发烈怒，把两块版扔在山下摔碎了，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he
saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast
the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.</p>
<p>32:20
又将他们所铸的牛犊用火焚烧，磨得粉碎，撒在水面上，叫以色列人喝。</p>
<p>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire,
and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the
children of Israel drink of it.</p>
<p>32:21 摩西对亚伦说，这百姓向你作了什么，你竟使他们陷在大罪里。</p>
<p>And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou
hast brought so great a sin upon them?</p>
<p>32:22 亚伦说，求我主不要发烈怒。这百姓专于作恶，是你知道的。</p>
<p>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest
the people, that they are set on mischief.</p>
<p>32:23
他们对我说，你为我们作神像，可以在我们前面引路，因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。</p>
<p>For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as
for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we
wot not what is become of him.</p>
<p>32:24
我对他们说，凡有金环的可以摘下来，他们就给了我。我把金环扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了。</p>
<p>And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off.
So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out
this calf.</p>
<p>32:25 摩西见百姓放肆（亚伦纵容他们，使他们在仇敌中间被讥刺），</p>
<p>And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made
them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)</p>
<p>32:26
就站在营门中，说，凡属耶和华的，都要到我这里来。于是利未的子孙都到他那里聚集。</p>
<p>Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the
LORD’s side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered
themselves together unto him.</p>
<p>32:27
他对他们说，耶和华以色列的神这样说，你们各人把刀跨在腰间，在营中往来，从这门到那门，各人杀他的弟兄与同伴并邻舍。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every
man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
companion, and every man his neighbour.</p>
<p>32:28 利未的子孙照摩西的话行了。那一天百姓中被杀的约有三千。</p>
<p>And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and
there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p>
<p>32:29
摩西说，今天你们要自洁，归耶和华为圣，各人攻击他的儿子和弟兄，使耶和华赐福与你们。</p>
<p>For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even
every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon
you a blessing this day.</p>
<p>32:30
到了第二天，摩西对百姓说，你们犯了大罪。我如今要上耶和华那里去，或者可以为你们赎罪。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people,
Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD;
peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p>
<p>32:31
摩西回到耶和华那里，说，唉，这百姓犯了大罪，为自己作了金像。</p>
<p>And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have
sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</p>
<p>32:32
倘或你肯赦免他们的罪，。。。。。。不然，求你从你所写的册上涂抹我的名。</p>
<p>Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin–; and if not, blot me, I pray
thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</p>
<p>32:33 耶和华对摩西说，谁得罪我，我就从我的册上涂抹谁的名。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him
will I blot out of my book.</p>
<p>32:34
现在你去领这百姓，往我所告诉你的地方去，我的使者必在你前面引路，只是到我追讨的日子，我必追讨他们的罪。</p>
<p>Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have
spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless
in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them.</p>
<p>32:35 <strong>耶和华杀百姓的缘故是因他们同亚伦作了牛犊。</strong></p>
<p>And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which
Aaron made.</p>
