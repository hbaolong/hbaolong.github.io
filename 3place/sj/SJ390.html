<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-23-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 23 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>23:1
第七年，耶何耶大奋勇自强，将百夫长耶罗罕的儿子亚撒利雅，约哈难的儿子以实玛利，俄备得的儿子亚撒利雅，亚大雅的儿子玛西雅，细基利的儿子以利沙法召来，与他们立约。</p>
<p>And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the
captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of
Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah,
and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.</p>
<p>23:2
他们走遍犹大，从犹大各城里招聚利未人和以色列的众族长到耶路撒冷来。</p>
<p>And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the
cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came
to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>23:3
会众在神殿里与王立约。耶何耶大对他们说，看哪，王的儿子必当作王，正如耶和华指着大卫子孙所应许的话。</p>
<p>And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house
of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son shall reign, as
the LORD hath said of the sons of David.</p>
<p>23:4
又说，你们当这样行，祭司和利未人凡安息日进班的，三分之一要把守各门，</p>
<p>This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on
the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, shall be porters of the
doors;</p>
<p>23:5
三分之一要在王宫，三分之一要在基址门。众百姓要在耶和华殿的院内。</p>
<p>And a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at
the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall be in the courts of
the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>23:6
除了祭司和供职的利未人之外，不准别人进耶和华的殿。惟独他们可以进去，因为他们圣洁。众百姓要遵守耶和华所吩咐的。</p>
<p>But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and
they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they are holy:
but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD.</p>
<p>23:7
利未人要手中各拿兵器，四围护卫王。凡擅入殿宇的，必当治死。王出入的时候，你们当跟随他。</p>
<p>And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with
his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he
shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and
when he goeth out.</p>
<p>23:8
利未人和犹大众人都照着祭司耶何耶大一切所吩咐的去行，各带所管安息日进班出班的人来，因为祭司耶何耶大不许他们下班。</p>
<p>So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were
to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go out on the sabbath:
for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses.</p>
<p>23:9 祭司耶何耶大便将神殿里所藏大卫王的枪，盾牌，挡牌交给百夫长，</p>
<p>Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds
spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king David’s, which
were in the house of God.</p>
<p>23:10
又分派众民手中各拿兵器，在坛和殿那里，从殿右直到殿左，站在王子的四围。</p>
<p>And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand,
from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along
by the altar and the temple, by the king round about.</p>
<p>23:11
于是领王子出来，给他戴上冠冕，将律法书交给他，立他作王。耶何耶大和众子膏他，众人说，愿王万岁。</p>
<p>Then they brought out the king’s son, and put upon him the crown, and
gave him the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons
anointed him, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p>23:12 亚他利雅听见民奔走赞美王的声音，就到民那里，进耶和华的殿，</p>
<p>Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising
the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD:</p>
<p>23:13
看见王站在殿门的柱旁，百夫长和吹号的人侍立在王左右，国民都欢乐吹号，又有歌唱的，用各样的乐器领人歌唱赞美。亚他利雅就撕裂衣服，喊叫说，反了。反了。</p>
<p>And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the
entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the
people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers
with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then
Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p>23:14
祭司耶何耶大带管辖军兵的百夫长出来，吩咐他们说，将她赶到班外，凡跟随她的必用刀杀死。因为祭司说，不可在耶和华殿里杀她。</p>
<p>Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that
were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the
ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For
the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>23:15 众兵就闪开，让她去。她走到王宫的马门，便在那里把她杀了。</p>
<p>So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of
the horse gate by the king’s house, they slew her there.</p>
<p>23:16 耶何耶大与众民和王立约，都要作耶和华的民。</p>
<p>And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people,
and between the king, that they should be the LORD’s people.</p>
<p>23:17
于是众民都到巴力庙，拆毁了庙，打碎坛和像，又在坛前将巴力的祭司玛坦杀了。</p>
<p>Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and
brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of
Baal before the altars.</p>
<p>23:18
耶何耶大派官看守耶和华的殿，是在祭司利未人手下。这祭司利未人是大卫分派在耶和华殿中，照摩西律法上所写的，给耶和华献燔祭，又按大卫所定的例，欢乐歌唱。</p>
<p>Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the
hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house
of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written
in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained
by David.</p>
<p>23:19
且设立守门的把守耶和华殿的各门，无论为何事，不洁净的人都不准进去。</p>
<p>And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that
none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.</p>
<p>23:20
又率领百夫长和贵胄，与民间的官长，并国中的众民，请王从耶和华殿下来，由上门进入王宫，立王坐在国位上。</p>
<p>And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought
down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high
gate into the king’s house, and set the king upon the throne of the
kingdom.</p>
<p>23:21 国民都欢乐，合城都安静。众人已将亚他利雅用刀杀了。</p>
<p>And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet,
after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.</p>
