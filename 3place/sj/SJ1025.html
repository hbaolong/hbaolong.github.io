<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-7-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 7 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 大祭司就说，这些事果然有吗。</p>
<p>Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</p>
<p>7:2
司提反说，诸位父兄请听。当日我们的祖宗亚伯拉罕在美索不达米亚还未住哈兰的时候，荣耀的神向他显现，</p>
<p>And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory
appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
dwelt in Charran,</p>
<p>7:3 对他说，你要离开本地和亲族，往我要指示你的地方去。</p>
<p>And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred,
and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</p>
<p>7:4
他就离开迦勒底人之地住在哈兰。他父亲死了以后，神使他从那里搬到你们现在所住之地。</p>
<p>Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran:
and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this
land, wherein ye now dwell.</p>
<p>7:5
在这地方神并没有给他产业，连立足之地也没有给他。但应许要将这地赐给他和他的后裔为业。那时他还没有儿子。</p>
<p>And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his
foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession,
and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</p>
<p>7:6
神说，他的后裔，必寄居外邦，那里的人，要叫他们作奴仆，苦待他们四百年。</p>
<p>And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange
land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them
evil four hundred years.</p>
<p>7:7
神又说，使他们作奴仆的那国，我要惩罚，以后他们要出来，在这地方事奉我。</p>
<p>And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said
God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this
place.</p>
<p>7:8
神又赐他割礼的约。于是亚伯拉罕生了以撒，第八日给他行了割礼。以撒生雅各，雅各生十二位先祖。</p>
<p>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat
Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and
Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</p>
<p>7:9 先祖嫉妒约瑟，把他卖到埃及去。神却与他同在，</p>
<p>And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God
was with him,</p>
<p>7:10
救他脱离一切苦难，又使他在埃及王法老面前，得恩典有智慧。法老就派他作埃及国的宰相兼管全家。</p>
<p>And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and
wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor
over Egypt and all his house.</p>
<p>7:11 后来埃及和迦南全地遭遇饥荒，大受艰难，我们的祖宗，就绝了粮。</p>
<p>Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and
great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</p>
<p>7:12 雅各听见在埃及有粮，就打发我们的祖宗，初次往那里去。</p>
<p>But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our
fathers first.</p>
<p>7:13 第二次约瑟与弟兄相认，他的亲族也被法老知道了。</p>
<p>And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and
Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>7:14 约瑟就打发弟兄请父亲雅各，和全家七十五个人都来。</p>
<p>Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his
kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</p>
<p>7:15 于是雅各下了埃及，后来他和我们的祖宗都死在那里。</p>
<p>So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</p>
<p>7:16
又被带到示剑，葬于亚伯拉罕在示剑用银子从哈抹子孙买来的坟墓里。</p>
<p>And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that
Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of
Sychem.</p>
<p>7:17 及至神应许亚伯拉罕的日期将到，以色列民在埃及兴盛众多，</p>
<p>But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to
Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</p>
<p>7:18 直到有不晓得约瑟的新王兴起。</p>
<p>Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</p>
<p>7:19
他用诡计待我们的宗族，苦害我们的祖宗，叫他们丢弃婴孩，使婴孩不能存活。</p>
<p>The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our
fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they
might not live.</p>
<p>7:20 那时，摩西生下来，俊美非凡，在他父亲家里抚养了三个月。</p>
<p>In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished
up in his father’s house three months:</p>
<p>7:21 他被丢弃的时候，法老的女儿拾了去，养为自己的儿子。</p>
<p>And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and
nourished him for her own son.</p>
<p>7:22 摩西学了埃及人一切的学问，说话行事，都有才能。</p>
<p>And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was
mighty in words and in deeds.</p>
<p>7:23 他将到四十岁，心中起意，去看望他的弟兄以色列人。</p>
<p>And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit
his brethren the children of Israel.</p>
<p>7:24
到了那里，见他们一个人受冤屈，就护庇他，为那受欺压的人报仇，打死了埃及人。</p>
<p>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him
that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</p>
<p>7:25 他以为弟兄必明白神是藉他的手搭救他们。他们却不明白。</p>
<p>For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by
his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</p>
<p>7:26
第二天，遇见两个以色列人争斗，就劝他们和睦，说，你们二位是弟兄，为什么彼此欺负呢。</p>
<p>And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and
would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do
ye wrong one to another?</p>
<p>7:27 那欺负邻舍的，把他推开说，谁立你作我们的首领，和审判官呢。</p>
<p>But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made
thee a ruler and a judge over us?</p>
<p>7:28 难道你要杀我，像昨天杀那埃及人吗。</p>
<p>Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</p>
<p>7:29 摩西听见这话就逃走了，寄居于米甸。在那里生了两个儿子。</p>
<p>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of
Madian, where he begat two sons.</p>
<p>7:30
过了四十年，在西奈山的旷野，有一位天使，从荆棘火焰中，向摩西显现。</p>
<p>And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the
wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a
bush.</p>
<p>7:31 摩西见了那异象，便觉希奇。正进前观看的时候，有主的声音说，</p>
<p>When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to
behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him,</p>
<p>7:32
我是你列祖的神，就是亚伯拉罕的神，以撒的神，雅各的神。徒07：32）摩西战战竞竞，不敢观看。</p>
<p>Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God
of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not
behold.</p>
<p>7:33 主对他说，把你脚上的鞋脱下来。因为你所站之地是圣地。</p>
<p>Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the
place where thou standest is holy ground.</p>
<p>7:34
我的百姓在埃及所受的困苦，我实在看见了。他们悲叹的声音，我也听见了。我下来要救他们，你来，我要差你往埃及去。</p>
<p>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in
Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver
them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</p>
<p>7:35
这摩西，就是百姓弃绝说，谁立你作我们的首领，和审判官的。神却藉那在荆棘中显现之使者的手，差派他作首领，作救赎的。</p>
<p>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a
judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand
of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</p>
<p>7:36
这人领百姓出来，在埃及，在红海，在旷野，四十年间行了奇事神迹。</p>
<p>He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in
the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty
years.</p>
<p>7:37
那曾对以色列人说，神要从你们弟兄中间，给你们兴起一位先知像我的，就是这位摩西。</p>
<p>This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet
shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
me; him shall ye hear.</p>
<p>7:38
这人曾在旷野会中，和西奈山上与那对他说话的天使同在，又与我们的祖宗同在，并且领受活泼的圣言传给我们。</p>
<p>This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel
which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received
the lively oracles to give unto us:</p>
<p>7:39 我们的祖宗不肯听从，反弃绝他，心里归向埃及，</p>
<p>To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in
their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</p>
<p>7:40
对亚伦说，你且为我们造些神像，在我们前面引路。因为领我们出埃及地的那个摩西，我们不知道他遭了什么事。</p>
<p>Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this
Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is
become of him.</p>
<p>7:41
那时，他们造了一个牛犊，又拿祭物献给那像，欢喜自己手中的工作。</p>
<p>And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the
idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</p>
<p>7:42
神就转脸不顾，任凭他们事奉天上的日月星辰，正如先知书上所写的说，以色列家阿，你们四十年间在旷野，岂是将牺牲和祭物献给我吗。</p>
<p>Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as
it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye
offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in
the wilderness?</p>
<p>7:43
你们抬着摩洛的帐幕，和理番神的星。就是你们所造为要敬拜的像。因此，我要把你们迁到巴比伦外去。</p>
<p>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god
Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you
away beyond Babylon.</p>
<p>7:44
我们的祖宗在旷野，有法柜的帐幕，是神吩咐摩西叫他照所看见的样式作的。</p>
<p>Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he
had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to
the fashion that he had seen.</p>
<p>7:45
这帐幕，我们的祖宗相继承，当神在他们面前赶出外邦人去的时候，他们同约书亚把张幕搬进承受为业之地，直存到大卫的日子。</p>
<p>Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the
possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our
fathers, unto the days of David;</p>
<p>7:46 大卫在神面前蒙恩，祈求为雅各的神豫备居所。</p>
<p>Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the
God of Jacob.</p>
<p>7:47 却是所罗门为神造成殿宇。</p>
<p>But Solomon built him an house.</p>
<p>7:48 其实至高者并不住人手所造的。就如先知所言，</p>
<p>Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as
saith the prophet,</p>
<p>7:49
主说，天是我的座位，地是我的脚凳。你们要为我造何等的殿宇，那里是我安息的地方呢。</p>
<p>Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye
build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?</p>
<p>7:50 这一切都是我手中所造的吗。</p>
<p>Hath not my hand made all these things?</p>
<p>7:51
你们这硬着颈项，心与耳未受割礼的人，常时抗拒圣灵。你们的祖宗怎样，你们也怎样。</p>
<p>Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always
resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.</p>
<p>7:52
那一个先知，不是你们祖宗逼迫呢。他们也把豫先传说那义者要来的人杀了。如今你们又把那义者卖了，杀了。</p>
<p>Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have
slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye
have been now the betrayers and murderers:</p>
<p>7:53 你们受了天使所传的律法，竟不遵守。</p>
<p>Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not
kept it.</p>
<p>7:54 众人听见这话，就极其恼怒，向司提反咬牙切齿。</p>
<p>When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they
gnashed on him with their teeth.</p>
<p>7:55
但司提反被圣灵充满，定睛望天，看见神的荣耀，又看见耶稣站在神的右边。</p>
<p>But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into
heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand
of God,</p>
<p>7:56 就说，我看见天开了，人子站在神的右边。</p>
<p>And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man
standing on the right hand of God.</p>
<p>7:57 众人大声喊叫，捂着耳朵，齐心拥上前去。</p>
<p>Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and
ran upon him with one accord,</p>
<p>7:58
把他推到城外，用石头打他。作见证的人，把衣裳放在一个少年人名叫扫罗的脚前。</p>
<p>And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid
down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.</p>
<p>7:59 他们正用石头打的时候，司提反呼吁主说，求耶稣接收我的灵魂。</p>
<p>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus,
receive my spirit.</p>
<p>7:60
又跪下大声喊着说，主阿，不要将这罪归于他们。说了这话就睡了。扫罗也喜悦他被害。</p>
<p>And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this
sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</p>
