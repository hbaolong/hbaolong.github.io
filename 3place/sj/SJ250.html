<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-14-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 14 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>14:1
有一日，扫罗的儿子约拿单对拿他兵器的少年人说，我们不如过到那边，到非利士人的防营那里去。但他没有告诉父亲。</p>
<p>Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said
unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the
Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his
father.</p>
<p>14:2
扫罗在基比亚的尽边，坐在米矶仑的石榴树下，跟随他的约有六百人。</p>
<p>And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate
tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him were about
six hundred men;</p>
<p>14:3
在那里有亚希突的儿子亚希亚，穿着以弗得。亚希突是以迦博的哥哥，非尼哈的儿子，以利的孙子。以利从前在示罗作耶和华的祭司。约拿单去了，百姓却不知道。</p>
<p>And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas,
the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the
people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p>14:4
约拿单要从隘口过到非利士防营那里去。这隘口两边各有一个山峰，一名播薛，一名西尼。</p>
<p>And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto
the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side, and a
sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez, and the
name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p>14:5 一峰向北，与密抹相对，一峰向南，与迦巴相对。</p>
<p>The forefront of the one was situate northward over against Michmash,
and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
<p>14:6
约拿单对拿兵器的少年人说，我们不如过到未受割礼人的防营那里去，或者耶和华为我们施展能力。因为耶和华使人得胜，不在乎人多人少。</p>
<p>And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and
let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that
the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save
by many or by few.</p>
<p>14:7
拿兵器的对他说，随你的心意行吧。你可以上去，我必跟随你，与你同心。</p>
<p>And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine heart:
turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p>
<p>14:8 约拿单说，我们要过到那些人那里去，使他们看见我们。</p>
<p>Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men, and we
will discover ourselves unto them.</p>
<p>14:9
他们若对我们说，你们站住，等我们到你们那里去，我们就站住，不上他们那里去。</p>
<p>If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will
stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p>
<p>14:10
他们若说，你们上到我们这里来，这话就是我们的证据。我们便上去，因为耶和华将他们交在我们手里了。</p>
<p>But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the
LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign unto
us.</p>
<p>14:11
二人就使非利士的防兵看见。非利士人说，希伯来人从所藏的洞穴里出来了。</p>
<p>And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p>14:12
防兵对约拿单和拿兵器的人说，你们上到这里来，我们有一件事指示你们。约拿单就对拿兵器的人说，你跟随我上去，因为耶和华将他们交在以色列人手里了。</p>
<p>And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer,
and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said
unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered
them into the hand of Israel.</p>
<p>14:13
约拿单就爬上去，拿兵器的人跟随他。约拿单杀倒非利士人，拿兵器的人也随着杀他们。</p>
<p>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his
armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him.</p>
<p>14:14
约拿单和拿兵器的人起头所杀的约有二十人，都在一亩地的半犁沟之内。</p>
<p>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made,
was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, which a
yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p>14:15
于是在营中，在田野，在众民内都有战兢，防兵和掠兵也都战兢，地也震动，战兢之势甚大。</p>
<p>And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the
people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the
earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
<p>14:16
在便雅悯的基比亚，扫罗的守望兵看见非利士的军众溃散，四围乱窜。</p>
<p>And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold,
the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one
another.</p>
<p>14:17
扫罗就对跟随他的民说，你们查点查点，看从我们这里出去的是谁。他们一查点，就知道约拿单和拿兵器的人没有在这里。</p>
<p>Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now, and
see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan
and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p>14:18
那时神的约柜在以色列人那里。扫罗对亚希亚说，你将神的约柜运了来。</p>
<p>And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of
God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p>14:19
扫罗正与祭司说话的时候，非利士营中的喧囔越发大了。扫罗就对祭司说，停手吧。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the
noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and
Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
<p>14:20
扫罗和跟随他的人都聚集，来到战场，看见非利士人用刀互相击杀，大大惶乱。</p>
<p>And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves,
and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword was against
his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p>
<p>14:21
从前由四方来跟随非利士军的希伯来人现在也转过来，帮助跟随扫罗和约拿单的以色列人了。</p>
<p>Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that time,
which went up with them into the camp from the country round about, even
they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and
Jonathan.</p>
<p>14:22
那藏在以法莲山地的以色列人听说非利士人逃跑，就出来紧紧地追杀他们。</p>
<p>Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount
Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also
followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p>14:23 那日，耶和华使以色列人得胜，一直战到伯亚文。</p>
<p>So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto
Bethaven.</p>
<p>14:24
扫罗叫百姓起誓说，凡不等到晚上向敌人报完了仇吃什么的，必受咒诅。因此这日百姓没有吃什么，就极其困惫。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured
the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until
evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
tasted any food.</p>
<p>14:25 众民进入树林，见有蜜在地上。</p>
<p>And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the
ground.</p>
<p>14:26
他们进了树林，见有蜜流下来，却没友人敢用手取蜜入口，因为他们怕那誓言。</p>
<p>And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the
oath.</p>
<p>14:27
约拿单没有听见他父亲叫百姓起誓，所以伸手中的杖，用杖头蘸在蜂房里，转手送入口内，眼睛就明亮了。</p>
<p>But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the
oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand,
and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his
eyes were enlightened.</p>
<p>14:28
百姓中有一人对他说，你父亲曾叫百姓严严地起誓说，今日吃什么的，必受咒诅。因此百姓就疲乏了。</p>
<p>Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day. And the people were faint.</p>
<p>14:29
约拿单说，我父亲连累你们了。你看，我尝了这一点蜜，眼睛就明亮了。</p>
<p>Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray
you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of
this honey.</p>
<p>14:30
今日百姓若任意吃了从仇敌所夺的物，击杀的非利士人岂不更多吗。</p>
<p>How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the
spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a
much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
<p>14:31
这日，以色列人击杀非利士人，从密抹直到亚雅仑。百姓甚是疲乏，</p>
<p>And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and
the people were very faint.</p>
<p>14:32 就急忙将所夺的牛羊和牛犊宰于地上，肉还带血就吃了。</p>
<p>And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and
calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with
the blood.</p>
<p>14:33
有人告诉扫罗说，百姓吃带血的肉，得罪耶和华了。扫罗说，你们有罪了，今日要将大石头滚到我这里来。</p>
<p>Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD,
in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll
a great stone unto me this day.</p>
<p>14:34
扫罗又说，你们散在百姓中，对他们说，你们各人将牛羊牵到我这里来宰了吃，不可吃带血的肉得罪耶和华。这夜，百姓就把牛羊牵到那里宰了。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto
them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and
slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the
blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night,
and slew them there.</p>
<p>14:35 扫罗为耶和华筑了一座坛，这是他初次为耶和华筑的坛。</p>
<p>And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar
that he built unto the LORD.</p>
<p>14:36
扫罗说，我们不如夜里下去追赶非利士人，抢掠他们，直到天亮，不留他们一人。众民说，你看怎样好就去行吧。祭司说，我们先当亲近神。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and
spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.
And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the
priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p>
<p>14:37
扫罗求问神说，我下去追赶非利士人可以不可以。你将他们交在以色列人手里不交。这日神没有回答他。</p>
<p>And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?
wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not
that day.</p>
<p>14:38 扫罗说，你们百姓中的长老都上这里来，查明今日是谁犯了罪。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and
know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p>
<p>14:39
我指着救以色列永生的耶和华起誓，就是我儿子约拿单犯了罪，他也必死。但百姓中无一人回答他。</p>
<p>For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all
the people that answered him.</p>
<p>14:40
扫罗就对以色列众人说，你们站在一边，我与我儿子约拿单也站在一边。百姓对扫罗说，你看怎样好就去行吧。</p>
<p>Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan
my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what
seemeth good unto thee.</p>
<p>14:41
扫罗祷告耶和华以色列的神说，求你指示实情。于是掣签掣出扫罗和约拿单来。百姓尽都无事。</p>
<p>Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect lot.
And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p>
<p>14:42
扫罗说，你们再掣签，看是我，是我儿子约拿单，就掣出约拿单来。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan
was taken.</p>
<p>14:43
扫罗对约拿单说，你告诉我，你作了什么事。约拿单说，我实在以手里的杖，用杖头蘸了一点蜜尝了一尝。这样我就死吗（吗或作吧）。</p>
<p>Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan
told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the
rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p>
<p>14:44 扫罗说，约拿单哪，你定要死。若不然，愿神重重地降罚与我。</p>
<p>And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely
die, Jonathan.</p>
<p>14:45
百姓对扫罗说，约拿单在以色列人中这样大行拯救，岂可使他死呢。断乎不可。我们指着永生的耶和华起誓，连他的一根头发也不可落地，因为他今日与神一同作事。于是百姓救约拿单免了死亡。</p>
<p>And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought
this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there
shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought
with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.</p>
<p>14:46 扫罗回去，不追赶非利士人。非利士人也回本地去了。</p>
<p>Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines
went to their own place.</p>
<p>14:47
扫罗执掌以色列的国权，常常攻击他四围的一切仇敌，就是摩押人，亚扪人，以东人，和琐巴诸王，并非利士人。他无论往何处去，都打败仇敌。</p>
<p>So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his
enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon,
and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the
Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p>
<p>14:48 扫罗奋勇攻击亚玛力人，救了以色列人脱离抢掠他们之人的手。</p>
<p>And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered
Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p>
<p>14:49
扫罗的儿子是约拿单，亦施韦，麦基舒亚。他的两个女儿，长女名米拉，次女名米甲。</p>
<p>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and
the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn
Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
<p>14:50
扫罗的妻名叫亚希暖，是亚希玛斯的女儿。扫罗的元帅名叫押尼珥，是尼珥的儿子。尼珥是扫罗的叔叔。</p>
<p>And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and
the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s
uncle.</p>
<p>14:51 扫罗的父亲基士，押尼珥的父亲尼珥，都是亚别的儿子。</p>
<p>And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the
son of Abiel.</p>
<p>14:52
扫罗平生常与非利士人大大争战。扫罗遇见有能力的人或勇士，都招募了来跟随他。</p>
<p>And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:
and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto
him.</p>
