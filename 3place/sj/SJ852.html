<h4 id="旧约-但以理书daniel-第-2-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
但以理书(Daniel) – 第 2 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 尼布甲尼撒在位第二年，他作了梦，心里烦乱，不能睡觉。</p>
<p>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar
dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake
from him.</p>
<p>2:2
王吩咐人将术士，用法术的，行邪术的，和迦勒底人召来，要他们将王的梦告诉王，他们就来站在王前。</p>
<p>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers,
and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams.
So they came and stood before the king.</p>
<p>2:3 王对他们说，我作了一梦，心里烦乱，要知道这是什么梦。</p>
<p>And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit
was troubled to know the dream.</p>
<p>2:4
迦勒底人用亚兰的言语对王说，愿王万岁。请将那梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。</p>
<p>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for
ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
interpretation.</p>
<p>2:5
王回答迦勒底人说，梦我已经忘了（或作我已定命八节同），你们若不将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必被凌迟，你们的房屋必成为粪堆。</p>
<p>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from
me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation
thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a
dunghill.</p>
<p>2:6
你们若将梦和梦的讲解告诉我，就必从我这里得赠品和赏赐，并大尊荣。现在你们要将梦和梦的讲解告诉我。</p>
<p>But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall
receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore shew me the
dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>2:7 他们第二次对王说，请王将梦告诉仆人，仆人就可以讲解。</p>
<p>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the
dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>
<p>2:8
王回答说，我准知道你们是故意迟延，因为你们知道那梦我已经忘了。</p>
<p>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain
the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>
<p>2:9
你们若不将梦告诉我，只有一法待你们。因为你们预备了谎言乱语向我说，要等候时势改变。现在你们要将梦告诉我，因我知道你们能将梦的讲解告诉我。</p>
<p>But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one
decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak
before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I
shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>2:10
迦勒底人在王面前回答说，世上没有人能将王所问的事说出来。因为没有君王，大臣，掌权的向术士，或用法术的，或迦勒底人问过这样的事。</p>
<p>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man
upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter: therefore there is no
king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or
astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>
<p>2:11
王所问的事甚难。除了不与世人同居的神明，没有人在王面前能说出来。</p>
<p>And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none
other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling
is not with flesh.</p>
<p>2:12 因此，王气忿忿地大发烈怒，吩咐灭绝巴比伦所有的哲士。</p>
<p>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to
destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p>2:13
于是命令发出，哲士将要见杀，人就寻梢但以理和他的同伴，要杀他们。</p>
<p>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they
sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>
<p>2:14 王的护卫长亚略出来，要杀巴比伦的哲士，但以理就用婉言回答他，</p>
<p>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of
the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of
Babylon:</p>
<p>2:15
向王的护卫长亚略说，王的命令为何这样紧急呢。亚略就将情节告诉但以理。</p>
<p>He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree
so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>
<p>2:16 但以理遂进去求王宽限，就可以将梦的讲解告诉王。</p>
<p>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him
time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>
<p>2:17
但以理回到他的居所，将这事告诉他的同伴哈拿尼雅，米沙利，亚撒利雅，</p>
<p>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah,
Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>
<p>2:18
要他们祈求天上的神施怜悯，将这奥秘的事指明，免得但以理和他的同伴与巴比伦其馀的哲士一同灭亡。</p>
<p>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this
secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of
the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p>2:19 这奥秘的事就在夜间异象中给但以理显明，但以理便称颂天上的神。</p>
<p>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then
Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>
<p>2:20
但以理说，神的名是应当称颂的。从亘古直到永远，因为智慧能力都属乎他。</p>
<p>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and
ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>
<p>2:21
他改变时候，日期，废王，立王，将智慧赐与智慧人，将知识赐与聪明人。</p>
<p>And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings, and
setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them
that know understanding:</p>
<p>2:22 他显明深奥隐秘的事，知道暗中所有的，光明也与他同居。</p>
<p>He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the
darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>
<p>2:23
我列祖的神阿，我感谢你，赞美你，因你将智慧才能赐给我，允准我们所求的，把王的事给我们指明。</p>
<p>I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast
given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we
desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s
matter.</p>
<p>2:24
于是，但以理进去见亚略，就是王所派灭绝巴比伦哲士的，对他说，不要灭绝巴比伦的哲士，求你领我到王面前，我要将梦的讲解告诉王。</p>
<p>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to
destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus unto him; Destroy
not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will
shew unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p>2:25
亚略就急忙将但以理领到王面前，对王说，我在被掳的犹大人中遇见一人，他能将梦的讲解告诉王。</p>
<p>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus
unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make
known unto the king the interpretation.</p>
<p>2:26
王问称为伯提沙撒的但以理说，你能将我所作的梦和梦的讲解告诉我吗。</p>
<p>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the
interpretation thereof?</p>
<p>2:27
但以理在王面前回答说，王所问的那奥秘事，哲士，用法术的，术士，观兆的都不能告诉王。</p>
<p>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret
which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the
magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>
<p>2:28
只有一位在天上的神能显明奥秘的事。他已将日后必有的事指示尼布甲尼撒王。你的梦和你在床上脑中的异象是这样，</p>
<p>But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known
to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream,
and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</p>
<p>2:29
王阿，你在床上想到后来的事，那显明奥秘事的主把将来必有的事指示你。</p>
<p>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed,
what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh
known to thee what shall come to pass.</p>
<p>2:30
至于那奥秘的事显明给我，并非因我的智慧胜过一切活人，乃为使王知道梦的讲解和心里的思念。</p>
<p>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that
I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known
the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts
of thy heart.</p>
<p>2:31
王阿，你梦见一个大像，这像甚高，极其光耀，站在你面前，形状甚是可怕。</p>
<p>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great image,
whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and the form thereof
was terrible.</p>
<p>2:32 这像的头是精金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的，</p>
<p>This image’s head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</p>
<p>2:33 腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的。</p>
<p>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</p>
<p>2:34
你观看，见有一块非人手凿出来的石头打在这像半铁半泥的脚上，把脚砸碎。</p>
<p>Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote
the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to
pieces.</p>
<p>2:35
于是金，银，铜，铁，泥都一同砸得粉碎，成如夏天禾场上的糠秕，被风吹散，无处可寻。打碎这像的石头变成一座大山，充满天下。</p>
<p>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold,
broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer
threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found
for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain,
and filled the whole earth.</p>
<p>2:36 这就是那梦。我们在王面前要讲解那梦。</p>
<p>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before
the king.</p>
<p>2:37
王阿，你是诸王之王。天上的神已将国度，权柄，能力，尊荣都赐给你。</p>
<p>Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath given
thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</p>
<p>2:38
凡世人所住之地的走兽，并天空的飞鸟，他都交付你手，使你掌管这一切。你就是那金头。</p>
<p>And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field
and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand, and hath made
thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.</p>
<p>2:39
在你以后必另兴一国，不及于你。又有第三国，就是铜的，必掌管天下。</p>
<p>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and
another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the
earth.</p>
<p>2:40
第四国，必坚壮如铁，铁能打碎克制百物，又能压碎一切，那国也必打碎压制列国。</p>
<p>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron
breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron that breaketh
all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</p>
<p>2:41
你既见像的脚和脚指头，一半是窑匠的泥，一半是铁，那国将来也必分开。你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国也必有铁的力量。</p>
<p>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters’ clay, and
part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of
the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with
miry clay.</p>
<p>2:42 那脚指头，既是半铁半泥，那国也必半强半弱。</p>
<p>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so
the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</p>
<p>2:43
你既见铁与泥搀杂，那国民也必与各种人搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。</p>
<p>And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle
themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not cleave one to
another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</p>
<p>2:44
当那列王在位的时候，天上的神必另立一国，永不败坏，也不归别国的人，却要打碎灭绝那一切国，这国必存到永远。</p>
<p>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a
kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</p>
<p>2:45
你既看见非人手凿出来的一块石头从山而出，打碎金，银，铜，铁，泥，那就是至大的神把后来必有的事给王指明。这梦准是这样，这讲解也是确实的。</p>
<p>Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain
without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the
clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the
king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and
the interpretation thereof sure.</p>
<p>2:46
当时，尼布甲尼撒王俯伏在地，向但以理下拜，并且吩咐人给他奉上供物和香品。</p>
<p>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and worshipped
Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet
odours unto him.</p>
<p>2:47
王对但以理说，你既能显明这奥秘的事，你们的神诚然是万神之神，万王之主，又是显明奥秘事的。</p>
<p>The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your
God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets,
seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p>
<p>2:48
于是王高抬但以理，赏赐他许多上等礼物，派他管理巴比伦全省，又立他为总理，掌管巴比伦的一切哲士。</p>
<p>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts,
and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the
governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</p>
<p>2:49
但以理求王，王就派沙得拉，米煞，亚伯尼歌管理巴比伦省的事务，只是但以理常在朝中侍立。</p>
<p>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in
the gate of the king.</p>
