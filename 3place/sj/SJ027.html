<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第27-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第27 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>27:1
以撒年老，眼睛昏花，不能看见，就叫了他大儿子以扫来，说，我儿，以扫说，我在这里。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,
so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto
him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.</p>
<p>27:2 他说，我如今老了，不知道哪一天死。</p>
<p>And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
death:</p>
<p>27:3 现在拿你的器械，就是箭囊和弓，往田野去为我打猎，</p>
<p>Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow,
and go out to the field, and take me some venison;</p>
<p>27:4 照我所爱的作成美味，拿来给我吃，使我在未死之先给你祝福。</p>
<p>And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I
may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</p>
<p>27:5
以撒对他儿子以扫说话，利百加也听见了。以扫往田野去打猎，要得野味带来。</p>
<p>And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to
the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</p>
<p>27:6 利百加就对她儿子雅各说，我听见你父亲对你哥哥以扫说，</p>
<p>And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy
father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,</p>
<p>27:7
你去把野兽带来，作成美味给我吃，我好在未死之先，在耶和华面前给你祝福。</p>
<p>Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless
thee before the LORD before my death.</p>
<p>27:8 现在，我儿，你要照着我所吩咐你的，听从我的话。</p>
<p>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
command thee.</p>
<p>27:9
你到羊群里去，给我拿两只肥山羊羔来，我便照你父亲所爱的给他作成美味。</p>
<p>Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the
goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he
loveth:</p>
<p>27:10 你拿到你父亲那里给他吃，使他在未死之先给你祝福。</p>
<p>And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he
may bless thee before his death.</p>
<p>27:11
雅各对他母亲利百加说，我哥哥以扫浑身是有毛的，我身上是光滑的。</p>
<p>And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a
hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</p>
<p>27:12 倘若我父亲摸着我，必以我为欺哄人的，我就招咒诅，不得祝福。</p>
<p>My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a
deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</p>
<p>27:13
他母亲对他说，我儿，你招的咒诅归到我身上。你只管听我的话，去把羊羔给我拿来。</p>
<p>And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey
my voice, and go fetch me them.</p>
<p>27:14 他便去拿来，交给他母亲。他母亲就照他父亲所爱的作成美味。</p>
<p>And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his
mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</p>
<p>27:15 利百加又把家里所存大儿子以扫上好的衣服给他小儿子雅各穿上，</p>
<p>And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which were
with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son:</p>
<p>27:16 又用山羊羔皮包在雅各的手上和颈项的光滑处，</p>
<p>And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and
upon the smooth of his neck:</p>
<p>27:17 就把所作的美味和饼交在他儿子雅各的手里。</p>
<p>And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared,
into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
<p>27:18 雅各到他父亲那里说，我父亲。他说，我在这里。我儿，你是谁。</p>
<p>And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here
am I; who art thou, my son?</p>
<p>27:19
雅各对他父亲说，我是你的长子以扫。我已照你所吩咐我的行了。请起来坐着，吃我的野味，好给我祝福。</p>
<p>And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I have done
according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my
venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>
<p>27:20
以撒对他儿子说，我儿，你如何找得这吗快呢。他说，因为耶和华你的神使我遇见好机会得着的。</p>
<p>And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so
quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to
me.</p>
<p>27:21
以撒对雅各说，我儿，你近前来，我摸摸你，知道你真是我的儿子以扫不是。</p>
<p>And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel
thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</p>
<p>27:22
雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他，说，声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手。</p>
<p>And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said,
The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</p>
<p>27:23
以撒就辨不出他来。因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样，就给他祝福。</p>
<p>And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.</p>
<p>27:24 又说，你真是我儿子以扫吗，他说，我是。</p>
<p>And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</p>
<p>27:25
以撒说，你递给我，我好吃我儿子的野味，给你祝福。雅各就递给他，他便吃了，又拿酒给他，他也喝了。</p>
<p>And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison,
that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did
eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank.</p>
<p>27:26 他父亲以撒对他说，我儿，你上前来与我亲嘴。</p>
<p>And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my
son.</p>
<p>27:27
他就上前与父亲亲嘴。他父亲一闻他衣服上的香气，就给他祝福，说，我儿的香气如同耶和华赐福之田地的香气一样。</p>
<p>And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his
raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the
smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</p>
<p>27:28 愿神赐你天上的甘露，地上的肥土，并许多五谷新酒。</p>
<p>Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</p>
<p>27:29
愿多民事奉你，多国跪拜你。愿你作你弟兄的主。你母亲的儿子向你跪拜。凡咒诅你的，愿他受咒诅。为你祝福的，愿他蒙福。</p>
<p>Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy
brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every
one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</p>
<p>27:30
以撒为雅各祝福已毕，雅各从他父亲那里才出来，他哥哥以扫正打猎回来，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing
Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his
father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</p>
<p>27:31
也作了美味，拿来给他父亲，说，请父亲起来，吃你儿子的野味，好给我祝福。</p>
<p>And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father,
and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s
venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>
<p>27:32 他父亲以撒对他说，你是谁，他说，我是你的长子以扫。</p>
<p>And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am
thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</p>
<p>27:33
以撒就大大地战兢，说，你未来之先，是谁得了野味拿来给我呢，我已经吃了，为他祝福。他将来也必蒙福。</p>
<p>And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that
hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before
thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.</p>
<p>27:34
以扫听了他父亲的话，就放声痛哭，说，我父阿，求你也为我祝福。</p>
<p>And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great
and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me
also, O my father.</p>
<p>27:35 以撒说，你兄弟已经用诡计来将你的福分夺去了。</p>
<p>And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy
blessing.</p>
<p>27:36
以扫说，他名雅各，岂不是正对吗，因为他欺骗了我两次。他从前夺了我长子的名分，你看，他现在又夺了我的福分。以扫又说，你没有留下为我可祝的福吗。</p>
<p>And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me
these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath
taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing
for me?</p>
<p>27:37
以撒回答以扫说，我已立他为你的主，使他的弟兄都给他作仆人，并赐他五谷新酒可以养生。我儿，现在我还能为你作什么呢。</p>
<p>And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy
lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with
corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee,
my son?</p>
<p>27:38
以扫对他父亲说，父阿，你只有一样可祝的福吗，我父阿，求你也为我祝福。以扫就放声而哭。</p>
<p>And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father?
bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and
wept.</p>
<p>27:39 他父亲以撒说，地上的肥土必为你所住。天上的甘露必为你所得。</p>
<p>And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling
shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from
above;</p>
<p>27:40
你必倚靠刀剑度日，又必事奉你的兄弟。到你强盛的时候，必从你颈项上挣开他的轭。</p>
<p>And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it
shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt
break his yoke from off thy neck.</p>
<p>27:41
以扫因他父亲给雅各祝的福，就怨恨雅各，心里说，为我父亲居丧的日子近了，到那时候，我要杀我的兄弟雅各。</p>
<p>And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father
blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my
father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</p>
<p>27:42
有人把利百加大儿子以扫的话告诉利百加，她就打发人去，叫了她小儿子雅各来，对他说，你哥哥以扫想要杀你，报仇雪恨。</p>
<p>And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she
sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy
brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill
thee.</p>
<p>27:43
现在，我儿，你要听我的话，起来，逃往哈兰，我哥哥拉班那里去，</p>
<p>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban
my brother to Haran;</p>
<p>27:44 同他住些日子，直等你哥哥的怒气消了。</p>
<p>And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury turn
away;</p>
<p>27:45
你哥哥向你消了怒气，忘了你向他所作的事，我便打发人去把你从那里带回来。为什么一日丧你们二人呢。</p>
<p>Until thy brother’s anger turn away from thee, and he forget that
which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from
thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</p>
<p>27:46
利百加对以撒说，我因这赫人的女子连性命都厌烦了。倘若雅各也娶赫人的女子为妻，像这些一样，我活着还有什么益处呢。</p>
<p>And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the
daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such
as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life
do me?</p>
