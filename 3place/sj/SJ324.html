<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-11-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 11 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>11:1 亚哈谢的母亲亚他利雅见她儿子死了，就起来剿灭王室。</p>
<p>And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead,
she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.</p>
<p>11:2
但约兰王的女儿，亚哈谢的妹子约示巴，将亚哈谢的儿子约阿施从那被杀的王子中偷出来，把他和他的乳母都藏在卧房里，躲避亚他利雅，免得被杀。</p>
<p>But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took
Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons which
were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber
from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.</p>
<p>11:3 约阿施和他的乳母藏在耶和华的殿里六年。亚他利雅篡了国位。</p>
<p>And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.</p>
<p>11:4
第七年，耶何耶大打发人叫迦利人（或作亲兵）和护卫兵的众百夫长来，领他们进了耶和华的殿，与他们立约，使他们在耶和华殿里起誓，又将王的儿子指给他们看，</p>
<p>And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into
the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath
of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.</p>
<p>11:5 吩咐他们说，你们当这样行，凡安息日进班的三分之一要看守王宫，</p>
<p>And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A
third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of
the watch of the king’s house;</p>
<p>11:6
三分之一要在苏珥门，三分之一要在护卫兵院的后门。这样把守王宫，拦阻闲人。</p>
<p>And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the
gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it
be not broken down.</p>
<p>11:7 你们安息日所有出班的三分之二要在耶和华的殿里护卫王。</p>
<p>And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.</p>
<p>11:8
各人手拿兵器，四围护卫王。凡擅入你们班次的必当治死，王出入的时候，你们当跟随他。</p>
<p>And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons
in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and
be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</p>
<p>11:9
众百夫长就照着祭司耶何耶大一切所吩咐的去行，各带所管安息日进班出班的人来见祭司耶何耶大。</p>
<p>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that
Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were
to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath,
and came to Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p>11:10 祭司便将耶和华殿里所藏大卫王的枪和盾牌交给百夫长。</p>
<p>And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David’s
spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:11
护卫兵手中各拿兵器，在坛和殿那里，从殿右直到殿左，站在王子的四围。</p>
<p>And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round
about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner
of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.</p>
<p>11:12
祭司领王子出来，给他戴上冠冕，将律法书交给他，膏他作王。众人就拍掌说，愿王万岁。</p>
<p>And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon him, and
gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and
they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p>11:13 亚他利雅听见护卫兵和民的声音，就到民那里，进耶和华的殿，</p>
<p>And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she
came to the people into the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:14
看见王照例站在柱旁，百夫长和吹号的人侍立在王左右，国中的众民欢乐吹号。亚他利雅就撕裂衣服，喊叫说，反了。反了。</p>
<p>And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the
people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent
her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p>11:15
祭司耶何耶大吩咐管辖军兵的百夫长说，将她赶出班外，凡跟随她的必用刀杀死。因为祭司说不可在耶和华殿里杀她，</p>
<p>But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the
officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the
ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest
had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:16 众兵就闪开让她去。她从马路上王宫去，便在那里被杀。</p>
<p>And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the
horses came into the king’s house: and there was she slain.</p>
<p>11:17
耶何耶大使王和民与耶和华立约，作耶和华的民。又使王与民立约。</p>
<p>And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the
people, that they should be the LORD’s people; between the king also and
the people.</p>
<p>11:18
于是国民都到巴力庙，拆毁了庙，打碎坛和像，又在坛前将巴力的祭司玛坦杀了。祭司耶何耶大派官看守耶和华的殿，</p>
<p>And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake
it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and
slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest
appointed officers over the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:19
又率领百夫长和迦利人（或作亲兵）与护卫兵，以及国中的众民，请王从耶和华殿下来，由护卫兵的门进入王宫，他就坐了王位。</p>
<p>And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king
from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard
to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.</p>
<p>11:20
国民都欢乐，合城都安静。众人已将亚他利雅在王宫那里用刀杀了。</p>
<p>And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet:
and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s house.</p>
<p>11:21 约阿施登基的时候年方七岁。</p>
<p>Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.</p>
