<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-16-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 16 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>16:1
保罗来到特庇，又到路司得。在那里有一个门徒，名叫提摩太，是信主之犹太妇人的儿子，他父亲却是希腊人。</p>
<p>Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was
there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess,
and believed; but his father was a Greek:</p>
<p>16:2 路司得和以哥念的弟兄，都称赞他。</p>
<p>Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and
Iconium.</p>
<p>16:3
保罗要带他同去，只因那些地方的犹太人，都知道他父亲是希腊人，就给他行了割礼。</p>
<p>Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised
him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all
that his father was a Greek.</p>
<p>16:4 他们经过各城，把耶路撒冷使徒和长老所定的条规，交给门徒遵守。</p>
<p>And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees
for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>16:5 于是众教会信心越发坚固，人数天天加增。</p>
<p>And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in
number daily.</p>
<p>16:6
圣灵既然禁止他们在亚细亚讲道，他们就经过弗吕家，加拉太一带地方。</p>
<p>Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,</p>
<p>16:7 到了每西亚的边界，他们想要往庇推尼去，耶稣的灵却不许。</p>
<p>After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but
the Spirit suffered them not.</p>
<p>16:8 他们就越过每西亚，下到特罗亚去。</p>
<p>And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</p>
<p>16:9
在夜间有异象现与保罗。有一个马其顿人，站着求他说，请你过到马其顿来帮助我们。</p>
<p>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of
Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help
us.</p>
<p>16:10
保罗既看见这异象，我们随既想要往马其顿去，以为神召我们传福音给那里的人听。</p>
<p>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go
into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to
preach the gospel unto them.</p>
<p>16:11 于是从特罗亚开船，一直行到撒摩特喇，第二天到了尼亚波利。</p>
<p>Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to
Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;</p>
<p>16:12
从那里来到腓立比，就是马其顿这一方的头一个城。也是罗马的驻防城。我们在这城里住了几天。</p>
<p>And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of
Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain
days.</p>
<p>16:13
当安息日，我们出城门，到了河边，知道那里有一个祷告的地方，我们就坐下对那聚会的妇女讲道。</p>
<p>And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where
prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women
which resorted thither.</p>
<p>16:14
有一个卖紫色布疋的妇人，名叫吕底亚，是推雅推喇城的人，素来敬拜神。他听见了，主就开导他的心，叫他留心听保罗所讲的话。</p>
<p>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of
Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened,
that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</p>
<p>16:15
他和他一家，既领了洗，便求我们说，你们若以为我是真信主的，（或作你们若以为我是忠心事奉主的）请到我家里来住。于是强留我们。</p>
<p>And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,
saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</p>
<p>16:16
后来，我们往那祷告的地方去。有一个使女迎着面来，他被巫鬼所附，用法术，叫他主人得大财利。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed
with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain
by soothsaying:</p>
<p>16:17
他跟随保罗和我们，喊着说，这些人是至高神的仆人，对你们传说救人的道。</p>
<p>The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the
servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of
salvation.</p>
<p>16:18
他一连多日这样喊叫，保罗就心中厌烦，转身对那鬼说，我奉耶稣基督的名，吩咐你从他身上出来。那鬼当时就出来了。</p>
<p>And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said
to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of
her. And he came out the same hour.</p>
<p>16:19
使女的主人们，见得利的指望没有了，便揪住保罗和西拉，拉他们到市上去见首领。</p>
<p>And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they
caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the
rulers,</p>
<p>16:20 又带到官长面前说，这些人原是犹太人，竟骚扰我们的城，</p>
<p>And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews,
do exceedingly trouble our city,</p>
<p>16:21 传我们罗马人所不可受，不可行的规矩。</p>
<p>And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to
observe, being Romans.</p>
<p>16:22 众人就一同起来攻击他们。官长吩咐剥了他们的衣裳，用棍打。</p>
<p>And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates
rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</p>
<p>16:23 打了许多棍，便将他们下在监里，嘱咐禁卒严紧看守。</p>
<p>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into
prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:</p>
<p>16:24 禁卒领了这样的命，就把他们下在监里，两脚上了木狗。</p>
<p>Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner
prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.</p>
<p>16:25 约在半夜，保罗和西拉，祷告唱诗赞美神，众囚犯也侧耳而听。</p>
<p>And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and
the prisoners heard them.</p>
<p>16:26
忽然地大震动，甚至监牢的地基都摇动了。监门立刻全开，众囚犯的锁链也都松开了。</p>
<p>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of
the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and
every one’s bands were loosed.</p>
<p>16:27 禁卒一醒，看见监门全开，以为囚犯已经逃走，就拔刀要自杀。</p>
<p>And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the
prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself,
supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</p>
<p>16:28 保罗大声呼叫说，不要伤害自己，我们都在这里。</p>
<p>But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we
are all here.</p>
<p>16:29 禁卒叫人拿灯来，就跳进去，战战竞竞的，俯伏在保罗西拉面前。</p>
<p>Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and
fell down before Paul and Silas,</p>
<p>16:30 又领他们出来说，二位先生，我当怎样行才能得救。</p>
<p>And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</p>
<p>16:31 他们说，当信主耶稣，你和你一家都必得救。</p>
<p>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved, and thy house.</p>
<p>16:32 他们就把主的道，讲给他和他全家的人听。</p>
<p>And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in
his house.</p>
<p>16:33
当夜就在那时候，禁卒把他们带去，洗他们的伤。他和属乎他的人，立时都受了洗。</p>
<p>And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their
stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</p>
<p>16:34
于是禁卒领他们上自己家里去，给他们摆上饭，他和全家，因为信了神，都很喜乐。</p>
<p>And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them,
and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</p>
<p>16:35 到了天亮，官长打发差役来说，释放那两个人吧。</p>
<p>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let
those men go.</p>
<p>16:36
禁卒就把这话告诉保罗说，官长打发人来叫释放你们。如今可以出监，平平安安的去吧。</p>
<p>And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The
magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in
peace.</p>
<p>16:37
保罗却说，我们是罗马人，并没有定罪，他们就在众人面前打了我们，又把我们下在监里。现在要私下撵我们出去吗，这是不行的。叫他们自己来领我们出去吧。</p>
<p>But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,
being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us
out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us
out.</p>
<p>16:38 差役把这话回禀官长。官长听见他们是罗马人，就害怕了。</p>
<p>And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they
feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</p>
<p>16:39 于是来劝他们，领他们出来，请他们离开那城。</p>
<p>And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired
them to depart out of the city.</p>
<p>16:40
二人出了监，往吕底亚家里去。见了弟兄们，劝慰他们一番，就走了。</p>
<p>And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia:
and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and
departed.</p>
