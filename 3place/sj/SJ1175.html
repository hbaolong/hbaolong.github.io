<h4 id="新约-启示录revelation-第-9-章-本篇共有-22-章">新约 –
启示录(Revelation) – 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>9:1
第五位天使吹号，我就看见一个星从天落到地上。有无底坑的钥匙赐给他。</p>
<p>And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto
the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.</p>
<p>9:2
他开了无底坑，便有烟从坑里往上冒，好像大火炉的烟。日头和天空，都因这烟昏暗了。</p>
<p>And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the
pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were
darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.</p>
<p>9:3
有蝗虫从烟中出来飞到地上。有能力赐给他们，好像地上蝎子的能力一样。</p>
<p>And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them
was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</p>
<p>9:4
并且吩咐他们说，不可伤害地上的草，和各样青物，并一切树木，惟独要伤害额上没有神印记的人。</p>
<p>And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the
earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men
which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.</p>
<p>9:5
但不许蝗虫害死他们，只叫他们受痛苦五个月。这痛苦就像蝎子螫人的痛苦一样。</p>
<p>And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that
they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.</p>
<p>9:6 在那些日子，人要求死，决不得死。愿意死，死却远避他们。</p>
<p>And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and
shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.</p>
<p>9:7
蝗虫的形状，好像豫备出战的马一样，头上戴的好像金冠冕，脸面好像男人的脸面。</p>
<p>And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto
battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their
faces were as the faces of men.</p>
<p>9:8 头发像女人的头发，牙齿像狮子的牙齿。</p>
<p>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the
teeth of lions.</p>
<p>9:9
胸前有甲，好像铁甲。他们翅膀的声音，好像许多车马奔跑上阵的声音。</p>
<p>And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the
sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running
to battle.</p>
<p>9:10 有尾巴像蝎子。尾巴上的毒钩能伤人五个月。</p>
<p>And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in
their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.</p>
<p>9:11
有无底坑的使者作他们的王。按着希伯来话，名叫亚巴顿，希腊话，名叫亚玻伦。</p>
<p>And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless
pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue
hath his name Apollyon.</p>
<p>9:12 第一样灾祸过去，还有两样灾祸要来。</p>
<p>One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter.</p>
<p>9:13 第六位天使吹号，我就听见有声音，从神面前金坛的四角出来，</p>
<p>And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns
of the golden altar which is before God,</p>
<p>9:14
吩咐那吹号的第六位天使，说，把那捆绑在伯拉大河的四个使者释放了。</p>
<p>Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four
angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.</p>
<p>9:15
那四个使者就被释放。他们原是豫备好了，到某年某月某日某时，要杀人的三分之一。</p>
<p>And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and
a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.</p>
<p>9:16 马军有二万万。他们的数目我听见了。</p>
<p>And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand
thousand: and I heard the number of them.</p>
<p>9:17
我在异象中看见那些马和骑马的，骑马的胸前有甲如火，与紫玛瑙，并硫磺。马的头好像狮子头，有火，有烟，有硫磺，从马的口中出来。</p>
<p>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them,
having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the
heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths
issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</p>
<p>9:18 口中所出来的火，与烟，并硫磺，这三样灾杀了人的三分之一。</p>
<p>By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by
the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.</p>
<p>9:19
这马的能力，是在口里，和尾巴上。因这尾巴像蛇，并且有头用以害人。</p>
<p>For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their
tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do
hurt.</p>
<p>9:20
其馀未曾被这灾所杀的人，仍旧不悔改自己手所作的，还是去拜鬼魔，和那些不能看，不能听，不能走，金，银，铜，木，石，的偶像。</p>
<p>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet
repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship
devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of
wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:</p>
<p>9:21 又不悔改他们那些凶杀，邪术，奸淫，偷窃的事。</p>
<p>Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor
of their fornication, nor of their thefts.</p>
