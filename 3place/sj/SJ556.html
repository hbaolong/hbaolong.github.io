<h4 id="旧约-诗篇psalms-第-78-章-本篇共有-150-章">旧约 – 诗篇(Psalms) –
第 78 章 ( 本篇共有 150 章 )</h4>
<p>78:1
（亚萨的训诲诗）我的民哪，你门要留心听我的训诲，侧耳听我口中的话。</p>
<p>Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of
my mouth.</p>
<p>78:2 我要开口说比喻。我要说出古时的谜语。</p>
<p>I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
old:</p>
<p>78:3 是我们所听见所知道的，也是我们的祖宗告诉我们的。</p>
<p>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p>78:4
我们不将这些事向他们的子孙隐瞒。要将耶和华的美德和他的能力，并他奇妙的作为，述说给后代听。</p>
<p>We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation
to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful
works that he hath done.</p>
<p>78:5
因为他在雅各中立法度，在以色列中设律法，是他吩咐我们祖宗，要传给子孙的。</p>
<p>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known
to their children:</p>
<p>78:6 使将要生的后代子孙，可以晓得。他们也要起来告诉他们的子孙。</p>
<p>That the generation to come might know them, even the children which
should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:</p>
<p>78:7 好叫他们仰望神，不忘记神的作为。惟要守他的命令。</p>
<p>That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of
God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p>78:8 不要像他们的祖宗，是顽梗悖逆居心不正之辈，向着神心不诚实。</p>
<p>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p>78:9 以法莲的子孙，带着兵器，拿着弓，临阵之日，转身退后。</p>
<p>The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back
in the day of battle.</p>
<p>78:10 他们不遵守神的约，不肯照他的律法行。</p>
<p>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
law;</p>
<p>78:11 又忘记他所行的，和他显给他们奇妙的作为。</p>
<p>And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.</p>
<p>78:12 他在埃及地，在琐安田，在他们祖宗的眼前，施行奇事。</p>
<p>Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land
of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p>78:13 他将海分裂，使他们过去。又叫水立起如垒。</p>
<p>He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the
waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p>78:14 他白日用云彩，终夜用火光，引导他们。</p>
<p>In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with
a light of fire.</p>
<p>78:15 他在旷野分裂磐石，多多的给他们水喝，如从深渊而出。</p>
<p>He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of
the great depths.</p>
<p>78:16 他使水从磐石涌出，叫水如江河下流。</p>
<p>He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run
down like rivers.</p>
<p>78:17 他们却仍旧得罪他，在乾燥之地悖逆至高者。</p>
<p>And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in
the wilderness.</p>
<p>78:18 他们心中试探神，随自己所欲的求食物。</p>
<p>And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
lust.</p>
<p>78:19 并且妄论神，说，神在旷野岂能摆设筵席吗。</p>
<p>Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in
the wilderness?</p>
<p>78:20
他曾击打磐石，使水涌出，成了江河。他还能赐粮食吗。还能为他的百姓豫备肉吗。</p>
<p>Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his
people?</p>
<p>78:21
所以耶和华听见，就发怒。有烈火向雅各烧起，有怒气向以色列上腾。</p>
<p>Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled
against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p>78:22 因为他们不信服神，不倚赖他的救恩。</p>
<p>Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation:</p>
<p>78:23 他却吩咐天空，又敞开天上的门。</p>
<p>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors
of heaven,</p>
<p>78:24 降吗哪像雨给他们吃，将天上的粮食赐给他们。</p>
<p>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the
corn of heaven.</p>
<p>78:25 各人或作人吃大能者的食物。他赐下粮食，使他们饱足。</p>
<p>Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p>78:26 他领东风起在天空，又用能力引了南风来。</p>
<p>He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he
brought in the south wind.</p>
<p>78:27 他降肉像雨在他们当中，多如尘土，又降飞鸟，多如海沙。</p>
<p>He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as
the sand of the sea:</p>
<p>78:28 落在他们的营中，在他们住处的四面。</p>
<p>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their
habitations.</p>
<p>78:29 他们吃了，而且饱足。这样，就随了他们所欲的。</p>
<p>So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own
desire;</p>
<p>78:30 他们贪而无厌，食物还在他们口中的时候，</p>
<p>They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet
in their mouths,</p>
<p>78:31
神的怒气，就向他们上腾，杀了他们内中的肥壮人。打倒以色列的少年人。</p>
<p>The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and
smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p>78:32 虽是这样，他们仍旧犯罪，不信他奇妙的作为。</p>
<p>For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
works.</p>
<p>78:33 因此他叫他们的日子，全归虚空，叫他们的年岁，尽属惊恐。</p>
<p>Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in
trouble.</p>
<p>78:34 他杀他们的时候，他们才求问他，回心转意，切切的寻求神。</p>
<p>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
enquired early after God.</p>
<p>78:35 他们也追念神是他们的磐石，至高的神，是他们的救赎主。</p>
<p>And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their
redeemer.</p>
<p>78:36 他们却用口馅媚他，用舌向他说谎。</p>
<p>Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied
unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p>78:37 因他们的心向他不正，在他的约上，也不忠心。</p>
<p>For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in
his covenant.</p>
<p>78:38
但他有怜悯，赦免他们的罪孽，不灭绝他们。而且屡次消他的怒气，不发尽他的忿怒。</p>
<p>But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p>78:39 他想到他们不过是血气，是一阵去而不返的风。</p>
<p>For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away,
and cometh not again.</p>
<p>78:40 他们在旷野悖逆他，在荒地叫他担忧，何其多呢。</p>
<p>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the
desert!</p>
<p>78:41 他们再三试探神，惹动以色列的圣者。</p>
<p>Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
Israel.</p>
<p>78:42 他们不追念他的能力（原文作手），和赎他们脱离敌人的日子。</p>
<p>They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from
the enemy.</p>
<p>78:43 他怎样在埃及地显神迹，在琐安田显奇事。</p>
<p>How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field
of Zoan:</p>
<p>78:44 把他们的江河，并河汊的水，都变为血，使他们不能喝。</p>
<p>And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they
could not drink.</p>
<p>78:45 他叫苍蝇成群，落在他们当中，吸尽他们。又叫青蛙灭了他们。</p>
<p>He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and
frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p>78:46 把他们的土产交给蚂蚱，把他们辛苦得来的交给蝗虫。</p>
<p>He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour
unto the locust.</p>
<p>78:47 他降冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树。下严霜打坏他们的桑树。</p>
<p>He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with
frost.</p>
<p>78:48 又把他们的牲畜交给冰雹，把他们的群畜交给闪电。</p>
<p>He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
thunderbolts.</p>
<p>78:49
他使猛烈的怒气，和忿怒，恼恨，苦难，成了一群降灾的使者，临到他们。</p>
<p>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p>78:50 他为自己的怒气修平了路，将他们交给瘟疫，使他们死亡。</p>
<p>He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but
gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p>78:51 在埃及击杀一切长子，在含的帐棚中，击杀他们强壮时头生的。</p>
<p>And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in
the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p>78:52 他却领出自己的民如羊，在旷野引他们如羊群。</p>
<p>But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in
the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p>78:53 他领他们稳稳妥妥的，使他们不至害怕。海却淹没他们的仇敌。</p>
<p>And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p>78:54 他带他们到自己圣地的边界，到他右手所得的这山地。</p>
<p>And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this
mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p>78:55
他在他们面前赶出外邦人，用绳子将外邦的地量给他们为业，叫以色列支派的人，住在他们的帐棚里。</p>
<p>He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents.</p>
<p>78:56 他们仍旧试探悖逆至高的神，不守他的法度。</p>
<p>Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
testimonies:</p>
<p>78:57
反倒退后，行诡诈，像他们的祖宗一样。他们改变，如同翻背的弓。</p>
<p>But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were
turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p>78:58
因他们的邱坛，惹了他的怒气，因他们雕刻的偶像，触动他的愤恨。</p>
<p>For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him
to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p>78:59 神听见，就发怒，极其憎恶以色列人。</p>
<p>When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</p>
<p>78:60 甚至他离弃示罗的帐幕，就是他在人间所搭的帐棚。</p>
<p>So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed
among men;</p>
<p>78:61 又将他的约柜原文作能力交与人掳去，将他的荣耀交在敌人手中。</p>
<p>And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the
enemy’s hand.</p>
<p>78:62 并将他的百姓交与刀剑，向他的产业发怒。</p>
<p>He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his
inheritance.</p>
<p>78:63 少年人被火烧灭。处女也无喜歌。</p>
<p>The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given
to marriage.</p>
<p>78:64 祭司倒在刀下。寡妇却不哀哭。</p>
<p>Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
lamentation.</p>
<p>78:65 那时主像世人睡醒，像勇士饮酒呼喊。</p>
<p>Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that
shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p>78:66 他就打退了他的敌人，叫他们永蒙羞辱。</p>
<p>And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetual reproach.</p>
<p>78:67 并且他弃掉约瑟的帐棚，不拣选以法莲支派，</p>
<p>Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe
of Ephraim:</p>
<p>78:68 却拣选犹大支派，他所喜爱的锡安山。</p>
<p>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.</p>
<p>78:69 盖造他的圣所，好像高峰，又像他建立永存之地。</p>
<p>And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he
hath established for ever.</p>
<p>78:70 又拣选他的仆人大卫，从羊圈中将他召来。</p>
<p>He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
sheepfolds:</p>
<p>78:71
叫他不再跟从那些带奶的母羊，为要牧养自己的百姓雅各，和自己的产业以色列。</p>
<p>From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob
his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p>78:72 于是他按心中的纯正，牧养他们，用手中的巧妙，引导他们。</p>
<p>So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided
them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
