<h4 id="旧约-约书亚记joshua-第-10-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 10 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>10:1
耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德听见约书亚夺了艾城，尽行毁灭，怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也照样待艾城和艾城的王，又听见基遍的居民与以色列人立了和约，住在他们中间，</p>
<p>Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard how
Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to
Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the
inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among
them;</p>
<p>10:2
就甚惧怕。因为基遍是一座大城，如都城一般，比艾城更大，并且城内的人都是勇士。</p>
<p>That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of
the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men
thereof were mighty.</p>
<p>10:3
所以耶路撒冷王亚多尼洗德打发人去见希伯仑王何咸，耶末王毗兰，拉吉王雅非亚，和伊矶伦王底璧，说，</p>
<p>Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish,
and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>
<p>10:4
求你们上来帮助我，我们好攻打基遍，因为他们与约书亚和以色列人立了和约。</p>
<p>Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath
made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p>
<p>10:5
于是五个亚摩利王，就是耶路撒冷王，希伯仑王，耶末王，拉吉王，伊矶伦王，大家聚集，率领他们的众军上去，对着基遍安营，攻打基遍。</p>
<p>Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the
king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of
Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their
hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>
<p>10:6
基遍人就打发人往吉甲的营中去见约书亚，说，你不要袖手不顾你的仆人，求你速速上来拯救我们，帮助我们，因为住山地亚摩利人的诸王都聚集攻击我们。</p>
<p>And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying,
Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save
us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the
mountains are gathered together against us.</p>
<p>10:7 于是约书亚和他一切兵丁，并大能的勇士，都从吉甲上去。</p>
<p>So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with
him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p>
<p>10:8
耶和华对约书亚说，不要怕他们。因为我已将他们交在你手里，他们无一人能在你面前删立得住。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered
them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before
thee.</p>
<p>10:9 约书亚就终夜从吉甲上去，猛然临到他们那里。</p>
<p>Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from Gilgal all
night.</p>
<p>10:10
耶和华使他们在以色列人面前溃乱。约书亚在基遍大大地杀败他们，追赶他们，在伯和仑的上坡路击杀他们，直到亚西加和玛基大。</p>
<p>And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a
great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up
to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:11
他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大冰雹（冰雹原文作石头）在他们身上，直降到亚西加，打死他们。被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用刀杀死的还多。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the
going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from
heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died
with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the
sword.</p>
<p>10:12
当耶和华将亚摩利人交付以色列人的日子，约书亚就祷告耶和华，在以色列人眼前说，日头阿，你要停在基遍。月亮阿，你要止在亚雅仑谷。</p>
<p>Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up
the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of
Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley
of Ajalon.</p>
<p>10:13
于是日头停留，月亮止住，直等国民向敌人报仇。这事岂不是写在雅煞珥书上吗。日头在天当中停住，不急速下落，约有一日之久。</p>
<p>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had
avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book
of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not
to go down about a whole day.</p>
<p>10:14
在这日以前，这日以后，耶和华听人的祷告，没有像这日的，是因耶和华为以色列争战。</p>
<p>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD
hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel.</p>
<p>10:15 约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。</p>
<p>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.</p>
<p>10:16 那五王逃跑，藏在玛基大洞里。</p>
<p>But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:17 有人告诉约书亚说，那五王已经找到了，都藏在玛基大洞里。</p>
<p>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a
cave at Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:18 约书亚说，你们把几块大石头滚到洞口，派人看守，</p>
<p>And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and
set men by it for to keep them:</p>
<p>10:19
你们却不可耽延，要追赶你们的仇敌，击杀他们尽后边的人，不容他们进自己的城邑，因为耶和华你们的神已经把他们交在你们手里。</p>
<p>And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the
LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>
<p>10:20
约书亚和以色列人大大杀败他们，直到将他们灭尽。其中剩下的人都进了坚固的城。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made
an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were
consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced
cities.</p>
<p>10:21
众百姓就安然回玛基大营中，到约书亚那里。没有一人敢向以色列人饶舌。</p>
<p>And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in
peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>10:22 约书亚说，打开洞口，将那五王从洞里带出来，领到我面前。</p>
<p>Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those
five kings unto me out of the cave.</p>
<p>10:23
众人就这样行，将那五王，就是耶路撒冷王，希伯仑王，耶末王，拉吉王，伊矶伦王，从洞里带出来，领到约书亚面前。</p>
<p>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of
the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</p>
<p>10:24
带出那五王到约书亚面前的时候，约书亚就召了以色列众人来，对那些和他同去的军长说，你们近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。他们就近前来，把脚踏在这些王的颈项上。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua,
that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains
of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the
necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the
necks of them.</p>
<p>10:25
约书亚对他们说，你们不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。应当刚强壮胆，因为耶和华必这样待你们所要攻打的一切仇敌。</p>
<p>And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and
of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against
whom ye fight.</p>
<p>10:26
随后约书亚将这五王杀死，挂在五棵树上。他们就在树上直挂到晚上。</p>
<p>And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on
five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</p>
<p>10:27
日头要落的时候，约书亚一吩咐，人就把尸首从树上取下来，丢在他们藏过的洞里，把几块大石头放在洞口，直存到今日。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that
Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them
into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the
cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</p>
<p>10:28
当日，约书亚夺了玛基大，用刀击杀城中的人和王。将其中一切人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个。他待玛基大王，像从前待耶利哥王一样。</p>
<p>And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the
souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of
Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
<p>10:29 约书亚和以色列众人从玛基大往立拿去，攻打立拿。</p>
<p>Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</p>
<p>10:30
耶和华将立拿和立拿的王也交在以色列人手里。约书亚攻打这城，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，没有留下一个。他待立拿王，像从前待耶利哥王一样。</p>
<p>And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand
of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls
that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king
thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
<p>10:31 约书亚和以色列众人从立拿往拉吉去，对着拉吉安营，攻打这城。</p>
<p>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish,
and encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
<p>10:32
耶和华将拉吉交在以色列人的手里。第二天约书亚就夺了拉吉，用刀击杀了城中的一切人口，是照他向立拿一切所行的。</p>
<p>And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it
on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to
Libnah.</p>
<p>10:33
那时基色王荷兰上来帮助拉吉，约书亚就把他和他的民都击杀了，没有留下一个。</p>
<p>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote
him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</p>
<p>10:34
约书亚和以色列众人从拉吉往伊矶伦去，对着伊矶伦安营，攻打这城。</p>
<p>And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him;
and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
<p>10:35
当日就夺了城，用刀击杀了城中的人。那日，约书亚将城中的一切人口尽行杀灭，是照他向拉吉一切所行的。</p>
<p>And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that
day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</p>
<p>10:36 约书亚和以色列众人从伊矶伦上希伯仑去，攻打这城，</p>
<p>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron;
and they fought against it:</p>
<p>10:37
就夺了希伯仑和属希伯仑的诸城邑，用刀将城中的人与王，并那些城邑中的人口，都击杀了，没有留下一个，是照他向伊矶伦所行的，把城中的一切人口尽行杀灭。</p>
<p>And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the
king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were
therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to
Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were
therein.</p>
<p>10:38 约书亚和以色列众人回到底璧，攻打这城，</p>
<p>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought
against it:</p>
<p>10:39
就夺了底璧和属底璧的城邑，又擒获底璧的王，用刀将这些城中的人口尽行杀灭，没有留下一个。他待底璧和底璧王，像从前待希伯仑和立拿与立拿王一样。</p>
<p>And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and
they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all
the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to
Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also
to Libnah, and to her king.</p>
<p>10:40
这样，约书亚击杀全地的人，就是山地，南地，高原，山坡的人，和那些地的诸王，没有留下一个。将凡有气息的尽行杀灭，正如耶和华以色列的神所吩咐的。</p>
<p>So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and
of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
Israel commanded.</p>
<p>10:41 约书亚从加低斯巴尼亚攻击到迦萨，又攻击歌珊全地，直到基遍。</p>
<p>And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the
country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</p>
<p>10:42
约书亚一时杀败了这些王，并夺了他们的地，因为耶和华以色列的神为以色列争战。</p>
<p>And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>
<p>10:43 于是约书亚和以色列众人回到吉甲的营中。</p>
<p>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.</p>
