<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-31-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 31 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>31:1 十一年三月初一日，耶和华的话临到我说，</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the
first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,</p>
<p>31:2
人子阿，你要向埃及王法老和他的众人说，在威势上谁能与你相比呢。</p>
<p>Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude;
Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p>
<p>31:3
亚述王曾如黎巴嫩中的香柏树，枝条荣美，影密如林，极其高大，树尖插入云中。</p>
<p>Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and
with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among
the thick boughs.</p>
<p>31:4
众水使它生长。深水使它长大。所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道延到田野诸树。</p>
<p>The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers
unto all the trees of the field.</p>
<p>31:5
所以它高大超过田野诸树。发旺的时候，枝子繁多，因得大水之力枝条长长。</p>
<p>Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field,
and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of
the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</p>
<p>31:6
空中的飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝。田野的走兽都在枝条下生子。所有大国的人民都在它荫下居住。</p>
<p>All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his
branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and
under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</p>
<p>31:7 树大条长，成为荣美，因为根在众水之旁。</p>
<p>Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for
his root was by great waters.</p>
<p>31:8
神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽它。松树不及它的枝子。枫树不及它的枝条。神园中的树都没有它荣美。</p>
<p>The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees
were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his
beauty.</p>
<p>31:9 我使它的枝条蕃多，成为荣美，以致神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒它。</p>
<p>I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all
the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</p>
<p>31:10 所以主耶和华如此说，因它高大，树尖插入云中，心骄气傲，</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs,
and his heart is lifted up in his height;</p>
<p>31:11
我就必将它交给列国中大有威势的人。他必定办它。我因它的罪恶，已经驱逐它。</p>
<p>I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the
heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his
wickedness.</p>
<p>31:12
外邦人，就是列邦中强暴的，将它砍断弃掉。它的枝条落在山间和一切谷中，它的枝子折断，落在地的一切河旁。地上的众民已经走去，离开它的荫下。</p>
<p>And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and
have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches
are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and
all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left
him.</p>
<p>31:13
空中的飞鸟都要宿在这败落的树上，田野的走兽都要卧在它的枝条下，</p>
<p>Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the
beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</p>
<p>31:14
好使水旁的诸树不因高大而自尊，也不将树尖插入云中，并且那些得水滋润，有势力的，也不得高大自立。因为它们在世人中，和下坑的人都被交与死亡，到阴府去了。</p>
<p>To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves
for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs,
neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for
they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in
the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</p>
<p>31:15
主耶和华如此说，它下阴间的那日，我便使人悲哀。我为它遮盖深渊，使江河凝结，大水停流。我也使黎巴嫩为它凄惨，田野的诸树都因它发昏。</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I
caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the
floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon
to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</p>
<p>31:16
我将它扔到阴间，与下坑的人一同下去。那时，列国听见它坠落的响声就都震动，并且伊甸的一切树就是黎巴嫩得水滋润，最佳最美的树都在阴府受了安慰。</p>
<p>I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him
down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of
Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be
comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</p>
<p>31:17
它们也与它同下阴间，到被杀的人那里。它们曾作它的膀臂，在列国中它的荫下居住。</p>
<p>They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with
the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in
the midst of the heathen.</p>
<p>31:18
在这样荣耀威势上，在伊甸园诸树中，谁能与你相比呢。然而你要与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府，在未受割礼的人中，与被杀的人一同躺卧。法老和他的群众乃是如此。这是主耶和华说的。</p>
<p>To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees
of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the
nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the
uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and
all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
