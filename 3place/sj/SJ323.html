<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-10-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 10 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>10:1
亚哈有七十个儿子在撒马利亚。耶户写信送到撒马利亚，通知耶斯列的首领，就是长老和教养亚哈众子的人，说，</p>
<p>And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and
sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them
that brought up Ahab’s children, saying,</p>
<p>10:2 你们那里既有你们主人的众子和车马，器械，坚固城，</p>
<p>Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master’s sons
are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city
also, and armour;</p>
<p>10:3
接了这信，就可以在你们主人的众子中选择一个贤能合宜的，使他坐他父亲的位，你们也可以为你们主人的家争战。</p>
<p>Look even out the best and meetest of your master’s sons, and set him
on his father’s throne, and fight for your master’s house.</p>
<p>10:4
他们却甚惧怕，彼此说，二王在他面前尚且站立不住，我们怎能站得住呢。</p>
<p>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood
not before him: how then shall we stand?</p>
<p>10:5
家宰，邑宰，和长老，并教养众子的人，打发人去见耶户，说，我们是你的仆人，凡你所吩咐我们的都必遵行，我们不立谁作王，你看怎样好就怎样行。</p>
<p>And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the
elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying,
We are thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not
make any king: do thou that which is good in thine eyes.</p>
<p>10:6
耶户又给他们写信说，你们若归顺我，听从我的话，明日这时候，要将你们主人众子的首级带到耶斯列来见我。那时王的儿子七十人都住在教养他们那城中的尊贵人家里。</p>
<p>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye be
mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men
your master’s sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time.
Now the king’s sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of
the city, which brought them up.</p>
<p>10:7
信一到，他们就把王的七十个儿子杀了，将首级装在筐里，送到在耶斯列的耶户那里。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the
king’s sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets,
and sent him them to Jezreel.</p>
<p>10:8
有使者来告诉耶户说，他们将王众子的首级送来了。耶户说，将首级在城门口堆作两堆，搁到明日。</p>
<p>And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought
the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at
the entering in of the gate until the morning.</p>
<p>10:9
次日早晨，耶户出来，站着对众民说，你们都是公义的，我背叛我主人，将他杀了。这些人却是谁杀的呢。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and
said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I conspired against my
master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</p>
<p>10:10
由此可知，耶和华指着亚哈家所说的话一句没有落空，因为耶和华藉他仆人以利亚所说的话都成就了。</p>
<p>Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of
the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the
LORD hath done that which he spake by his servant Elijah.</p>
<p>10:11
凡亚哈家在耶斯列所剩下的人和他的大臣，密友，祭司，耶户尽都杀了，没有留下一个。</p>
<p>So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and
all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him
none remaining.</p>
<p>10:12 耶户起身往撒马利亚去。在路上，牧人剪羊毛之处，</p>
<p>And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the
shearing house in the way,</p>
<p>10:13
遇见犹大王亚哈谢的弟兄，问他们说，你们是谁。回答说，我们是亚哈谢的弟兄，现在下去要问王和太后的众子安。</p>
<p>Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who
are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go
down to salute the children of the king and the children of the
queen.</p>
<p>10:14
耶户吩咐说，活捉他们。跟从的人就活捉了他们，将他们杀在剪羊毛之处的坑边，共四十二人，没有留下一个。</p>
<p>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them
at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left
he any of them.</p>
<p>10:15
耶户从那里前行，恰遇利甲的儿子约拿达来迎接他，耶户问他安，对他说，你诚心待我像我诚心待你吗。约拿达回答说，是。耶户说，若是这样，你向我伸手，他就伸手。耶户拉他上车。</p>
<p>And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of
Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine
heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It
is. If it be, give me thine hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took
him up to him into the chariot.</p>
<p>10:16
耶户说，你和我同去，看我为耶和华怎样热心。于是请他坐在车上，</p>
<p>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made
him ride in his chariot.</p>
<p>10:17
到了撒马利亚，就把撒马利亚的亚哈家剩下的人都杀了，直到灭尽，正如耶和华对以利亚所说的。</p>
<p>And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in
Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD,
which he spake to Elijah.</p>
<p>10:18 耶户招聚众民，对他们说，亚哈事奉巴力还冷淡，耶户却更热心。</p>
<p>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab
served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</p>
<p>10:19
现在我要给巴力献大祭。应当叫巴力的众先知和一切拜巴力的人，并巴力的众祭司，都到我这里来，不可缺少一个。凡不来的必不得活。耶户这样行，是用诡计要杀尽拜巴力的人。</p>
<p>Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great
sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.
But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the
worshippers of Baal.</p>
<p>10:20 耶户说，要为巴力宣告严肃会。于是宣告了。</p>
<p>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
proclaimed it.</p>
<p>10:21
耶户差人走遍以色列地。凡拜巴力的人都来齐了，没有一个不来的。他们进了巴力庙，巴力庙中从前边直到后边都满了人。</p>
<p>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal
came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into
the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to
another.</p>
<p>10:22
耶户吩咐掌管礼服的人说，拿出礼服来，给一切拜巴力的人穿。他就拿出礼服来给了他们。</p>
<p>And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments
for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth
vestments.</p>
<p>10:23
耶户和利甲的儿子约拿达进了巴力庙，对拜巴力的人说，你们察看察看，在你们这里不可有耶和华的仆人，只可容留拜巴力的人。</p>
<p>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of
Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there
be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers
of Baal only.</p>
<p>10:24
耶户和约拿达进去，献平安祭和燔祭。耶户先安排八十人在庙外，吩咐说，我将这些人交在你们手中，若有一人脱逃，谁放的必叫他偿命。</p>
<p>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu
appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have
brought into your hands escape, he that letteth him go, his life shall
be for the life of him.</p>
<p>10:25
耶户献完了燔祭，就出来吩咐护卫兵和众军长说，你们进去杀他们，不容一人出来。护卫兵和军长就用刀杀他们，将尸首抛出去，便到巴力庙的城去了，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the
burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in,
and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of
the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the
city of the house of Baal.</p>
<p>10:26 将巴力庙中的柱像都拿出来烧了。</p>
<p>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and
burned them.</p>
<p>10:27 毁坏了巴力柱像，拆毁了巴力庙作为厕所，直到今日。</p>
<p>And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of
Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.</p>
<p>10:28 这样，耶户在以色列中灭了巴力。</p>
<p>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</p>
<p>10:29
只是耶户不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，就是拜伯特利和但的金牛犊。</p>
<p>Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves
that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</p>
<p>10:30
耶和华对耶户说，因你办好我眼中看为正的事，照我的心意待亚哈家，你的子孙必接续你坐以色列的国位，直到四代。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing
that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto the house of Ahab
according to all that was in mine heart, thy children of the fourth
generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p>10:31
只是耶户不尽心遵守耶和华以色列神的律法，不离开耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel
with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which
made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>10:32 在那些日子，耶和华才割裂以色列国，使哈薛攻击以色列的境界，</p>
<p>In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote
them in all the coasts of Israel;</p>
<p>10:33
乃是约旦河东，基列全地，从靠近亚嫩谷边的亚罗珥起，就是基列和巴珊的迦得人，流便人，玛拿西人之地。</p>
<p>From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the
Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon,
even Gilead and Bashan.</p>
<p>10:34 耶户其馀的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his
might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?</p>
<p>10:35 耶户与他列祖同睡，葬在撒马利亚。他儿子约哈斯接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And
Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>10:36 耶户在撒马利亚作以色列王二十八年。</p>
<p>And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and
eight years.</p>
