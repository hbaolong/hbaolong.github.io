<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-10-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 10 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>10:1
撒母耳拿瓶膏油倒在扫罗的头上，与他亲嘴，说，这不是耶和华膏你作他产业的君吗。</p>
<p>Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and
kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to
be captain over his inheritance?</p>
<p>10:2
你今日与我离别之后，在便雅悯境内的泄撒，靠近拉结的坟墓，要遇见两个人。他们必对你说，你去找的那几头驴已经找着了。现在你父亲不为驴挂心，反为你担忧，说，我为儿子怎么才好呢？</p>
<p>When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men
by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will
say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo,
thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you,
saying, What shall I do for my son?</p>
<p>10:3
你从那里往前行，到了他泊的橡树那里，必遇见三个往伯特利去拜神的人，一个带着三只山羊羔，一个带着三个饼，一个带着一皮袋酒。</p>
<p>Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the
plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to
Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of
bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</p>
<p>10:4 他们必问你安，给你两个饼，你就从他们手中接过来。</p>
<p>And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which
thou shalt receive of their hands.</p>
<p>10:5
此后你到神的山，在那里有非利士人的防兵。你到了城的时候，必遇见一班先知从邱坛下来，前面有鼓瑟的，击鼓的，吹笛的，弹琴的，他们都受感说话。</p>
<p>After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison
of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come
thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming
down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and
a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p>10:6
耶和华的灵必大大感动你，你就与他们一同受感说话。你要变为新人。</p>
<p>And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</p>
<p>10:7 这兆头临到你，你就可以趁时而作，因为神与你同在。</p>
<p>And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as
occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</p>
<p>10:8
你当在我以先下到吉甲，我也必下到那里献燔祭和平安祭。你要等候七日，等我到了那里，指示你当行的事。</p>
<p>And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come
down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of
peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and
shew thee what thou shalt do.</p>
<p>10:9
扫罗转身离别撒母耳，神就赐他一个新心。当日这一切兆头都应验了。</p>
<p>And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel,
God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that
day.</p>
<p>10:10
扫罗到了那山，有一班先知遇见他，神的灵大大感动他，他就在先知中受感说话。</p>
<p>And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets
met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among
them.</p>
<p>10:11
素来认识扫罗的，看见他和先知一同受感说话，就彼此说，基士的儿子遇见什么了。扫罗也列在先知中吗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that,
behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to
another, What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also
among the prophets?</p>
<p>10:12
那地方有一个人说，这些人的父亲是谁呢。此后有句俗语说，扫罗也列在先知中吗。</p>
<p>And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father?
Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</p>
<p>10:13 扫罗受感说话已毕，就上邱坛去了。</p>
<p>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high
place.</p>
<p>10:14
扫罗的叔叔问扫罗和他仆人说，你们往哪里去了。回答说，找驴去了。我们见没有驴，就到了撒母耳那里。</p>
<p>And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye?
And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where,
we came to Samuel.</p>
<p>10:15 扫罗的叔叔说，请将撒母耳向你们所说的话告诉我。</p>
<p>And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto
you.</p>
<p>10:16
扫罗对他叔叔说，他明明地告诉我们驴已经找着了。至于撒母耳所说的国事，扫罗却没有告诉叔叔。</p>
<p>And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were
found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told
him not.</p>
<p>10:17 撒母耳将百姓招聚到米斯巴耶和华那里，</p>
<p>And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</p>
<p>10:18
对他们说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，我领你们以色列人出埃及，救你们脱离埃及人的手，又救你们脱离欺压你们各国之人的手。</p>
<p>And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them
that oppressed you:</p>
<p>10:19
你们今日却厌弃了救你们脱离一切灾难的神，说，求你立一个王治理我们。现在你们应当按着支派，宗族都站在耶和华面前。</p>
<p>And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of
all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him,
Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the
LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</p>
<p>10:20 于是，撒母耳使以色列众支派近前来掣签，就掣出便雅悯支派来。</p>
<p>And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the
tribe of Benjamin was taken.</p>
<p>10:21
又使便雅悯支派按着宗族近前来，就掣出玛特利族，从其中又掣出基士的儿子扫罗。众人寻梢他却寻不着，</p>
<p>When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was
taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</p>
<p>10:22
就问耶和华说，那人到这里来了没有。耶和华说，他藏在器具中了。</p>
<p>Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet
come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among
the stuff.</p>
<p>10:23
众人就跑去从那里领出他来。他站在百姓中间，身体比众民高过一头。</p>
<p>And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the
people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and
upward.</p>
<p>10:24
撒母耳对众民说，你们看耶和华所拣选的人，众民中有可比他的吗。众民就大声欢呼说，愿王万岁。</p>
<p>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath
chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the
people shouted, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p>10:25
撒母耳将国法对百姓说明，又记在书上，放在耶和华面前，然后遣散众民，各回各家去了。</p>
<p>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it
in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the
people away, every man to his house.</p>
<p>10:26 扫罗往基比亚回家去，有神感动的一群人跟随他。</p>
<p>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of
men, whose hearts God had touched.</p>
<p>10:27
但有些匪徒说，这人怎能救我们呢。就藐视他，没有送他礼物。扫罗却不理会。</p>
<p>But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they
despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</p>
