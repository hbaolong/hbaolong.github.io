<h4 id="新约-约翰福音john-第-6-章-本篇共有-21-章">新约 – 约翰福音(John)
– 第 6 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>6:1 这事以后，耶稣渡过加利利海，就是提比哩亚海。</p>
<p>After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the
sea of Tiberias.</p>
<p>6:2 有许多人，因为看见他在病人身上所行的神迹，就跟随他。</p>
<p>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles
which he did on them that were diseased.</p>
<p>6:3 耶稣上了山，和门徒一同坐在那里。</p>
<p>And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
disciples.</p>
<p>6:4 那时犹太人的逾越节近了。</p>
<p>And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</p>
<p>6:5
耶稣举目看见许多人来，就对腓力说，我们从那里买饼叫这些人吃呢。</p>
<p>When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company come unto
him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may
eat?</p>
<p>6:6 他说这话，是要试验腓力。他自己原知道要怎样行。</p>
<p>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would
do.</p>
<p>6:7
腓力回答说，就是二十两银子的饼，叫他们各人吃一点，也是不够的。</p>
<p>Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</p>
<p>6:8 有一个门徒，就是西门彼得的兄弟安得烈，对耶稣说，</p>
<p>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, saith unto
him,</p>
<p>6:9
在这里有一个孩童，带着五个大麦饼，两条鱼。只是分给这许多人，还算什么呢。</p>
<p>There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two small
fishes: but what are they among so many?</p>
<p>6:10
耶稣说，你们叫众人坐下。原来那地方的草多，众人就坐下。数目约有五千。</p>
<p>And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in
the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</p>
<p>6:11
耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，就分给那坐着的人。分鱼也是这样，都随着他们所要的。</p>
<p>And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set
down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.</p>
<p>6:12
他们吃饱了，耶稣对门徒说，把剩下的零碎，收拾起来，免得有糟蹋的。</p>
<p>When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the
fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</p>
<p>6:13
他们便将那五个大麦饼的零碎，就是众人剩下的，收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。</p>
<p>Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with
the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above
unto them that had eaten.</p>
<p>6:14 众人看见耶稣所行的神迹。就说，这真是那要到世间来的先知。</p>
<p>Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said,
This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.</p>
<p>6:15 耶稣既知道众人要来强逼他作王，就独自又退到山上去了。</p>
<p>When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by
force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself
alone.</p>
<p>6:16 到了晚上，他的门徒下海边去，</p>
<p>And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the sea,</p>
<p>6:17
上了船，要过海往迦百农去。天已经黑了，耶稣还没有来到他们那里。</p>
<p>And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum. And
it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them.</p>
<p>6:18 忽然狂风大作，海就翻腾起来。</p>
<p>And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</p>
<p>6:19
门徒摇橹约行了十里多路，看见耶稣在海面上走，渐渐近了船，他们就害怕。</p>
<p>So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they
see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh unto the ship: and they
were afraid.</p>
<p>6:20 耶稣对他们说，是我。不要怕。</p>
<p>But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</p>
<p>6:21 门徒就喜欢接他上船，船立时到了他们所要去的地方。</p>
<p>Then they willingly received him into the ship: and immediately the
ship was at the land whither they went.</p>
<p>6:22
第二日，站在海那边的众人，知道那里没有别的船，只有一只小船，又知道耶稣没有同他的门徒上船，乃是门徒自己去的。</p>
<p>The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of
the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one
whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with his
disciples into the boat, but that his disciples were gone away
alone;</p>
<p>6:23 然而有几只小船从提比哩亚来，靠近主祝谢后分饼给人吃的地方。</p>
<p>(Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place
where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks:)</p>
<p>6:24 众人见耶稣和门徒，都不在那里，就上了船，往迦百农去找耶稣。</p>
<p>When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither his
disciples, they also took shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for
Jesus.</p>
<p>6:25 既在海那边找着了，就对他说，拉比，是几时到这里来的。</p>
<p>And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said
unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</p>
<p>6:26
耶稣回答说，我实实在在的告诉你们，你们找我，并不是因见了神迹，乃是因吃饼得饱。</p>
<p>Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek
me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the
loaves, and were filled.</p>
<p>6:27
不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永生的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的。因为人子是父神所印证的。</p>
<p>Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which
endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto
you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</p>
<p>6:28 众人问他说，我们当行什么，才算作神的工呢。</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the
works of God?</p>
<p>6:29 耶稣回答说，信神所差来的，这就是作神的工。</p>
<p>Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye
believe on him whom he hath sent.</p>
<p>6:30 他们又说，你行什么神迹，叫我们看见就信你。你到底作什么事呢。</p>
<p>They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then, that we
may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p>
<p>6:31
我们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，如经上写着说，他从天上赐下粮来给他们吃。</p>
<p>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave
them bread from heaven to eat.</p>
<p>6:32
耶稣说，我实实在在的告诉你们，那从天上来的粮，不是摩西赐给你们的，乃是我父将天上的真粮赐给你们。</p>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave
you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread
from heaven.</p>
<p>6:33 因为神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世界的。</p>
<p>For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth
life unto the world.</p>
<p>6:34 他们说，主阿，常将这粮赐给我们。</p>
<p>Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</p>
<p>6:35
耶稣说，我就是生命的粮。到我这里来的，必定不饿。信我的，永远不渴。</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to
me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never
thirst.</p>
<p>6:36 只是我对你们说过，你们已经看见我，还是不信。</p>
<p>But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.</p>
<p>6:37 凡父所赐给我的人，必到我这里来。到我这里来的，我总不丢弃他。</p>
<p>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh
to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>
<p>6:38
因为我从天上!降下来，不是要按自己的意思行，乃是要按那差我来者的意思行。</p>
<p>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of
him that sent me.</p>
<p>6:39
差我来者的意思，就是他所赐给我的，叫一个也不失落，在末日却叫他复活。</p>
<p>And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of all which
he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at
the last day.</p>
<p>6:40
因为我父的意思，是叫一切见子而信的人得永生。并且在末日我要叫他复活。</p>
<p>And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth
the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will
raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p>6:41 犹太人因为耶稣说，我是从天上降下来的粮，就私下议论他。</p>
<p>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which
came down from heaven.</p>
<p>6:42
说，这不是约瑟的儿子耶稣吗。他的父母我们岂不认得吗。他如今怎吗说，我是从天上降下来的呢。</p>
<p>And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and
mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I came down from
heaven?</p>
<p>6:43 耶稣回答说，你们不要大家议论。</p>
<p>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
yourselves.</p>
<p>6:44
若不是差我来的父吸引人，就没有能到我这里来的。到我这里来的，在末日我要叫他复活。</p>
<p>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him:
and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p>6:45
在先知书上写着说，他们都要蒙神的教训。凡听见父之教训又学习的，就到我这里来。</p>
<p>It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.
Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father,
cometh unto me.</p>
<p>6:46 这不是说，有人看过父，惟独从神来的，他看见过父。</p>
<p>Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he
hath seen the Father.</p>
<p>6:47 我实实在在的告诉你们，信的人有永生。</p>
<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life.</p>
<p>6:48 我就是生命的粮。</p>
<p>I am that bread of life.</p>
<p>6:49 你们的祖宗在旷野吃过吗哪，还是死了。</p>
<p>Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</p>
<p>6:50 这是从天上降下来的粮，叫人吃了就不死。</p>
<p>This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat
thereof, and not die.</p>
<p>6:51
我是从天上降下来生命的粮。人若吃这粮，就必永远活着。我所要赐的粮，就是我的肉，为世人之生命所赐的。</p>
<p>I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of
this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my
flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</p>
<p>6:52 因此，犹太人彼此争论说，这个人怎能把他的肉，给我们吃呢。</p>
<p>The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can this man
give us his flesh to eat?</p>
<p>6:53
耶稣说，我实实在在的告诉你们，你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面。</p>
<p>Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye
eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in
you.</p>
<p>6:54 吃我肉，喝我血的人就有永生。在末日我要叫他复活。</p>
<p>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and
I will raise him up at the last day.</p>
<p>6:55 我的肉真是可吃的，我的血真是可喝的。</p>
<p>For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>
<p>6:56 吃我肉喝我血的人，常在我里面，我也常在他里面。</p>
<p>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I
in him.</p>
<p>6:57
永活的父怎样差我来，我又因父活着，照样，吃我肉的人，也要因我活着。</p>
<p>As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he
that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</p>
<p>6:58
这就是从天上降下来的粮。吃这个粮的人，就永远活着，不像你们的祖宗吃过吗哪，还是死了。</p>
<p>This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers
did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for
ever.</p>
<p>6:59 这些话是耶稣在迦百农会堂里教训人说的。</p>
<p>These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
<p>6:60 他的门徒中有好些人听见了，就说，这话甚难，谁能听呢。</p>
<p>Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this, said, This
is an hard saying; who can hear it?</p>
<p>6:61
耶稣心里知道门徒为这话议论，就对他们说，这话是叫你们厌弃吗。（厌弃原文作跌倒）</p>
<p>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said
unto them, Doth this offend you?</p>
<p>6:62 倘或你们看见人子升到他原来所在之处，怎吗样呢。</p>
<p>What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
before?</p>
<p>6:63
叫人活着的乃是灵，肉体是无益的。我对你们所说的话，就是灵，就是生命。</p>
<p>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the
words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</p>
<p>6:64
只是你们中间有不信的人。耶稣从起头就知道，谁不信他，谁要卖他。</p>
<p>But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew from the
beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray
him.</p>
<p>6:65
耶稣又说，所以我对你们说过，若不是蒙我父的恩赐，没有人能到我这里来。</p>
<p>And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me,
except it were given unto him of my Father.</p>
<p>6:66 从此他门徒中多有退去的，不再和他同行。</p>
<p>From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no more
with him.</p>
<p>6:67 耶稣就对那十二个门徒说，你们也要去吗。</p>
<p>Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p>
<p>6:68 西门彼得回答说，主阿，你有永生之道，我们还归从谁呢。</p>
<p>Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast
the words of eternal life.</p>
<p>6:69 我们已经信了，又知道你是神的圣者。</p>
<p>And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the
living God.</p>
<p>6:70
耶稣说，我不是拣选了你们十二个门徒吗，但你们中间有一个是魔鬼。</p>
<p>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is
a devil?</p>
<p>6:71
耶稣这话是指着加略人西门的儿子犹大说的。他本是十二个门徒里的一个，后来要卖耶稣的。</p>
<p>He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that
should betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>
