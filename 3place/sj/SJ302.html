<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-11-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 11 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>11:1
所罗门王在法老的女儿之外，又宠爱许多外邦女子，就是摩押女子，亚扪女子，以东女子，西顿女子，赫人女子。</p>
<p>But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter
of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and
Hittites;</p>
<p>11:2
论到这些国的人，耶和华曾晓谕以色列人说，你们不可与她们往来相通，因为她们必诱惑你们的心去随从她们的神。所罗门却恋爱这些女子。</p>
<p>Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of
Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you:
for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon
clave unto these in love.</p>
<p>11:3 所罗门有妃七百，都是公主。还有嫔三百。这些妃嫔诱惑他的心。</p>
<p>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p>
<p>11:4
所罗门年老的时候，他的妃嫔诱惑他的心去随从别神，不效法他父亲大卫诚诚实实地顺服耶和华他的神。</p>
<p>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away
his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD
his God, as was the heart of David his father.</p>
<p>11:5 因为所罗门随从西顿人的女神亚斯她录和亚扪人可憎的神米勒公。</p>
<p>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and
after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>
<p>11:6
所罗门行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不效法他父亲大卫专心顺从耶和华。</p>
<p>And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully
after the LORD, as did David his father.</p>
<p>11:7
所罗门为摩押可憎的神基抹和亚扪人可憎的神摩洛，在耶路撒冷对面的山上建筑邱坛。</p>
<p>Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
abomination of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>11:8
他为那些向自己的神烧香献祭的外邦女子，就是他娶来的妃嫔也是这样行。</p>
<p>And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense
and sacrificed unto their gods.</p>
<p>11:9
耶和华向所罗门发怒，因为他的心偏离向他两次显现的耶和华以色列的神。</p>
<p>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned
from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice,</p>
<p>11:10 耶和华曾吩咐他不可随从别神，他却没有遵守耶和华所吩咐的。</p>
<p>And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go
after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.</p>
<p>11:11
所以耶和华对他说，你忌行了这事，不遵守我所吩咐你守的约和律例，我必将你的国夺回，赐给你的臣子。</p>
<p>Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of
thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have
commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give
it to thy servant.</p>
<p>11:12
然而，因你父亲大卫的缘故，我不在你活着的日子行这事，必从你儿子的手中将国夺回。</p>
<p>Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s
sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p>
<p>11:13
只是我不将全国夺回，要因我仆人大卫和我所选择的耶路撒冷，还留一支派给你的儿子。</p>
<p>Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe
to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I
have chosen.</p>
<p>11:14 耶和华使以东人哈达兴起，作所罗门的敌人。他是以东王的后裔。</p>
<p>And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite:
he was of the king’s seed in Edom.</p>
<p>11:15
先前大卫攻击以东，元帅约押上去葬埋阵亡的人，将以东的男丁都杀了。</p>
<p>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of
the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male
in Edom;</p>
<p>11:16
约押和以色列众人在以东住了六个月，直到将以东的男丁尽都剪除。</p>
<p>(For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had
cut off every male in Edom:)</p>
<p>11:17 那时哈达还是幼童。他和他父亲的臣仆，几个以东人逃往埃及。</p>
<p>That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants
with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.</p>
<p>11:18
他们从米甸起行，到了巴兰。从巴兰带着几个人来到埃及见埃及王法老。法老为他派定粮食，又给他房屋田地。</p>
<p>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men
with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of
Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him
land.</p>
<p>11:19
哈达在法老面前大蒙恩惠，以致法老将王后答比匿的妹子赐他为妻。</p>
<p>And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave
him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the
queen.</p>
<p>11:20
答比匿的妹子给哈达生了一个儿子，名叫基努拔。答比匿使基努拔在法老的宫里断奶，基努拔就与法老的众子一同住在法老的宫里。</p>
<p>And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among
the sons of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>11:21
哈达在埃及听见大卫与他列祖同睡，元帅约押也死了，就对法老说，求王容我回本国去。</p>
<p>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let
me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</p>
<p>11:22
法老对他说，你在我这里有什么缺乏，你竟要回你本国去呢。他回答说，我没有缺乏什么，只是求王容我回去。</p>
<p>Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered,
Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</p>
<p>11:23
神又使以利亚大的儿子利逊兴起，作所罗门的敌人。他先前逃避主人琐巴王哈大底谢。</p>
<p>And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah,
which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</p>
<p>11:24
大卫击杀琐巴人的时候，利逊招聚了一群人，自己作他们的头目，往大马士革居住，在那里作王。</p>
<p>And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when
David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,
and reigned in Damascus.</p>
<p>11:25
所罗门活着的时候，哈达为患之外，利逊也作以色列的敌人。他恨恶以色列人，且作了亚兰人的王。</p>
<p>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the
mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over
Syria.</p>
<p>11:26
所罗门的臣仆，尼八的儿子耶罗波安也举手攻击王。他是以法莲支派的洗利达人，他母亲是寡妇，名叫洗鲁阿。</p>
<p>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s
servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted
up his hand against the king.</p>
<p>11:27
他举手攻击王的缘故，乃由先前所罗门建造米罗，修补他父亲大卫城的破口。</p>
<p>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king:
Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his
father.</p>
<p>11:28
耶罗波安是大有才能的人。所罗门见这少年人殷勤，就派他监管约瑟家的一切工程。</p>
<p>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing
the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the
charge of the house of Joseph.</p>
<p>11:29
一日，耶罗波安出了耶路撒冷，示罗人先知亚希雅在路上遇见他。亚希雅身上穿着一件新衣。他们二人在田野，以外并无别人。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had
clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the
field:</p>
<p>11:30 亚希雅将自己穿的那件新衣撕成十二片，</p>
<p>And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in
twelve pieces:</p>
<p>11:31
对耶罗波安说，你可以拿十片。耶和华以色列的神如此说，我必将国从所罗门手里夺回，将十个支派赐给你。</p>
<p>And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the
LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand
of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</p>
<p>11:32
（我因仆人大卫和我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷城的缘故，仍给所罗门留一个支派。）</p>
<p>(But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for
Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel:)</p>
<p>11:33
因为他离弃我，敬拜西顿人的女神亚斯她录，摩押的神基抹，和亚扪人的神米勒公，没有遵从我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，守我的律例典章，像他父亲大卫一样。</p>
<p>Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the
goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom
the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do
that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my
judgments, as did David his father.</p>
<p>11:34
但我不从他手里将全国夺回。使他终身为君，是因我所拣选的仆人大卫谨守我的诫命律例。</p>
<p>Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will
make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake,
whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</p>
<p>11:35 我必从他儿子的手里将国夺回，以十个支派赐给你，</p>
<p>But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it
unto thee, even ten tribes.</p>
<p>11:36
还留一个支派给他的儿子，使我仆人大卫在我所选择立我名的耶路撒冷城里，在我面前长有灯光。</p>
<p>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may
have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen
me to put my name there.</p>
<p>11:37 我必拣选你，使你照心里一切所愿的，作王治理以色列。</p>
<p>And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy
soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</p>
<p>11:38
你若听从我一切所吩咐你的，遵行我的道，行我眼中看为正的事，谨守我的律例诫命，像我仆人大卫所行的，我就与你同在，为你立坚固的家，像我为大卫所立的一样，将以色列人赐给你。</p>
<p>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee,
and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my
statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be
with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will
give Israel unto thee.</p>
<p>11:39 我必因所罗门所行的使大卫后裔受患难，但不至于永远。</p>
<p>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</p>
<p>11:40
所罗门因此想要杀耶罗波安。耶罗波安却起身逃往埃及。到了埃及王示撒那里，就住在埃及，直到所罗门死了。</p>
<p>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and
fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the
death of Solomon.</p>
<p>11:41 所罗门其馀的事，凡他所行的和他的智慧都写在所罗门记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</p>
<p>11:42 所罗门在耶路撒冷作以色列众人的王共四十年。</p>
<p>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was
forty years.</p>
<p>11:43
所罗门与他列祖同睡，葬在他父亲大卫的城里。他儿子罗波安接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
