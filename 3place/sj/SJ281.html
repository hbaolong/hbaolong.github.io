<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记下2-samuel-第-14-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记下(2 Samuel) – 第 14 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>14:1 洗鲁雅的儿子约押，知道王心里想念押沙龙，</p>
<p>Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king’s heart was
toward Absalom.</p>
<p>14:2
就打发人往提哥亚去，从那里叫了一个聪明的妇人来，对她说，请你假装居丧的，穿上孝衣，不要用膏抹身，要装作为死者许久悲哀的妇人。</p>
<p>And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said
unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now
mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman
that had a long time mourned for the dead:</p>
<p>14:3 进去见王，对王如此如此说。于是约押将当说的话教导了妇人。</p>
<p>And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put
the words in her mouth.</p>
<p>14:4 提哥亚妇人到王面前，伏地叩拜，说，王阿，求你拯救。</p>
<p>And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face
to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king.</p>
<p>14:5 王问她说，你有什么事呢。回答说，婢女实在是寡妇，我丈夫死了。</p>
<p>And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I am
indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</p>
<p>14:6 我有两个儿子，一日在田间争斗，没有人解劝，这个就打死那个。</p>
<p>And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the
field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other, and
slew him.</p>
<p>14:7
现在全家的人都起来攻击婢女，说，你将那打死兄弟的交出来，我们好治死他，偿他打死兄弟的命，灭绝那承受家业的。这样，他们要将我剩下的炭火灭尽，不与我丈夫留名留后在世上。</p>
<p>And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and
they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for
the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also:
and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to
my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.</p>
<p>14:8 王对妇人说，你回家去吧。我必为你下令。</p>
<p>And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give
charge concerning thee.</p>
<p>14:9
提哥亚妇人又对王说，我主我王，愿这罪归我和我父家，与王和王的位无干。</p>
<p>And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the
iniquity be on me, and on my father’s house: and the king and his throne
be guiltless.</p>
<p>14:10 王说，凡难为你的，你就带他到我这里来，他必不再搅扰你。</p>
<p>And the king said, Whosoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to me,
and he shall not touch thee any more.</p>
<p>14:11
妇人说，愿王记念耶和华你的神，不许报血仇的人施行灭绝，恐怕他们灭绝我的儿子。王说，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你的儿子连一根头发也不致落在地上。</p>
<p>Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God,
that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any
more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As the LORD liveth, there
shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.</p>
<p>14:12 妇人说，求我主我王容婢女再说一句话。王说，你说吧。</p>
<p>Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word
unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</p>
<p>14:13
妇人说，王为何也起意要害神的民呢。王不使那逃亡的人回来，王的这话就是自证己错了。</p>
<p>And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing
against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one
which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his
banished.</p>
<p>14:14
我们都是必死的，如同水泼在地上，不能收回。神并不夺取人的性命，乃设法使逃亡的人不致成为赶出，回不来的。</p>
<p>For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which
cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet
doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.</p>
<p>14:15
我来将这话告诉我主我王，是因百姓使我惧怕。婢女想，不如将这话告诉王，或者王成就婢女所求的。</p>
<p>Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the
king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid
said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will
perform the request of his handmaid.</p>
<p>14:16
人要将我和我儿子从神的地业上一同除灭，王必应允救我脱离他的手。</p>
<p>For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of
the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance
of God.</p>
<p>14:17
婢女又想，我主我王的话必安慰我。因为我主我王能辨别是非，如同神的使者一样。惟愿耶和华你的神与你同在。</p>
<p>Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be
comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern
good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee.</p>
<p>14:18
王对妇人说，我要问你一句话，你一点不要瞒我。妇人说，愿我主我王说。</p>
<p>Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I
pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my
lord the king now speak.</p>
<p>14:19
王说，你这些话莫非是约押的主意吗。妇人说，我敢在我主我王面前起誓，王的话升对，不偏左右，是王的仆人约押吩咐我的，这些话是他教导我的。</p>
<p>And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And
the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none
can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the
king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these
words in the mouth of thine handmaid:</p>
<p>14:20
王的仆人约押如此行，为要挽回这事。我主的智慧却如神使者的智慧，能知世上一切事。</p>
<p>To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this
thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God,
to know all things that are in the earth.</p>
<p>14:21
王对约押说，我应允你这事。你可以去，把那少年人押沙龙带回来。</p>
<p>And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go
therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</p>
<p>14:22
约押就面伏于地叩拜，祝谢于王，又说，王既应允仆人所求的，仆人今日知道在我主我王眼前蒙恩了。</p>
<p>And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and
thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have
found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath
fulfilled the request of his servant.</p>
<p>14:23 于是约押起身往基述去，将押沙龙带回耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14:24
王说，使他回自己家里去，不要见我的面。押沙龙就回自己家里去，没有见王的面。</p>
<p>And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see
my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king’s
face.</p>
<p>14:25
以色列全地之中，无人像押沙龙那样俊美，得人的称赞，从脚底到头顶毫无瑕疵。</p>
<p>But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for
his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head
there was no blemish in him.</p>
<p>14:26
他的头发甚重，每到年底剪发一次。所剪下来的，按王的平称一称，重二百舍客勒。</p>
<p>And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year’s end that he
polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:)
he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king’s
weight.</p>
<p>14:27
押沙龙生了三个儿子，一个女儿。女儿名叫他玛，是个容貌俊美的女子。</p>
<p>And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose
name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</p>
<p>14:28 押沙龙住在耶路撒冷足有二年，没有见王的面。</p>
<p>So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king’s
face.</p>
<p>14:29
押沙龙打发人去叫约押来，要托他去见王，约押却不肯来。第二次打发人去叫他，他仍不肯来。</p>
<p>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he
would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would
not come.</p>
<p>14:30
所以押沙龙对仆人说，你们看，约押有一块田，与我的田相近，其中有大麦，你们去放火烧了。押沙龙的仆人就去放火烧了那田。</p>
<p>Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab’s field is near mine,
and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s servants
set the field on fire.</p>
<p>14:31
于是约押起来，到了押沙龙家里，问他说，你的仆人为何放火烧了我的田呢。</p>
<p>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said unto
him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</p>
<p>14:32
押沙龙回答约押说，我打发人去请你来，好托你去见王，替我说，我为何从基述回来呢。不如仍在那里。现在要许我见王的面。我若有罪，任凭王杀我就是了。</p>
<p>And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come
hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come
from Geshur? it had been good for me to have been there still: now
therefore let me see the king’s face; and if there be any iniquity in
me, let him kill me.</p>
<p>14:33
于是约押去见王，将这话奏告王，王便叫押沙龙来。押沙龙来见王，在王面前俯伏于地，王就与押沙龙亲嘴。</p>
<p>So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for
Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the
ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom.</p>
