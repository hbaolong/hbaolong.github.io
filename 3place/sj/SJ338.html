<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-25-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 25 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>25:1
西底家背叛巴比伦王。他作王第九年十月初十日，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领全军来攻击耶路撒冷，对城安营，四围筑垒攻城。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched
against it; and they built forts against it round about.</p>
<p>25:2 于是城被围困，直到西底家王十一年。</p>
<p>And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
Zedekiah.</p>
<p>25:3 四月初九日，城里有大饥荒，甚至百姓都没有粮食。</p>
<p>And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the
city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.</p>
<p>25:4
城被攻破，一切兵丁就在夜间从靠近王园两城中间的门逃跑。迦勒底人正在四围攻城，王就向亚拉巴逃走。</p>
<p>And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by
the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king’s garden:
(now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went
the way toward the plain.</p>
<p>25:5
迦勒底的军队追赶王，在耶利哥的平原追上他。他的全军都离开他四散了。</p>
<p>And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him
in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him.</p>
<p>25:6 迦勒底人就拿住王，带他到在利比拉的巴比伦王那里审判他。</p>
<p>So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to
Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.</p>
<p>25:7
在西底家眼前杀了他的众子，并且剜了西底家的眼睛，用铜链锁着他，带到巴比伦去。</p>
<p>And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the
eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him
to Babylon.</p>
<p>25:8
巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒十九年五月初七日，巴比伦王的臣仆，护卫长尼布撒拉旦来到耶路撒冷，</p>
<p>And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the
nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came
Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon,
unto Jerusalem:</p>
<p>25:9
用火焚烧耶和华的殿和王宫，又焚烧耶路撒冷的房屋，就是各大户家的房屋。</p>
<p>And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all the
houses of Jerusalem, and every great man’s house burnt he with fire.</p>
<p>25:10 跟从护卫长迦勒底的全军就拆毁耶路撒冷四围的城墙。</p>
<p>And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the
guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
<p>25:11
那时护卫长尼布撒拉旦将城里所剩下的百姓，并已经投降巴比伦王的人，以及大众所剩下的人，都掳去了。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the
multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away.</p>
<p>25:12 但护卫长留下些民中最穷的，使他们修理葡萄园，耕种田地。</p>
<p>But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be
vinedressers and husbandmen.</p>
<p>25:13
耶和华殿的铜柱，并耶和华殿的盆座和铜海，迦勒底人都打碎了，将那铜运到巴比伦去了，</p>
<p>And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the
bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the
Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
<p>25:14 又带去锅，铲子，腊剪，调羹，并所用的一切铜器，</p>
<p>And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and
all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</p>
<p>25:15 火鼎，碗，无论金的银的，护卫长也都带去了。</p>
<p>And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of gold, in
gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the guard took away.</p>
<p>25:16
所罗门为耶和华殿所造的两根铜柱，一个铜海，和几个盆座，这一切的铜，多得无法可称。</p>
<p>The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for
the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without
weight.</p>
<p>25:17
这一根柱子高十八肘，柱上有铜顶，高三肘。铜顶的周围有网子和石榴，都是铜的。那一根柱子，照此一样，也有网子。</p>
<p>The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter
upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the
wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of
brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work.</p>
<p>25:18 护卫长拿住大祭司西莱雅，副祭司西番亚，和三个把门的，</p>
<p>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
<p>25:19
又从城中拿住一个管理兵丁的官（或作太监），并在城里所遇常见王面的五个人和检点国民军长的书记，以及城里遇见的国民六十个人。</p>
<p>And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of
war, and five men of them that were in the king’s presence, which were
found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered
the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land
that were found in the city:</p>
<p>25:20 护卫长尼布撒拉旦将这些人带到在利比拉的巴比伦王那里。</p>
<p>And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to
the king of Babylon to Riblah:</p>
<p>25:21
巴比伦王就把他们击杀在哈马地的利比拉。这样，犹大人被掳去离开本地。</p>
<p>And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the
land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.</p>
<p>25:22
至于犹大国剩下的民，就是巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒所剩下的，巴比伦王立了沙番的孙子，亚希甘的儿子基大利作他们的省长。</p>
<p>And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.</p>
<p>25:23
众军长和属他们的人听见巴比伦王立了基大利作省长，于是军长尼探雅的儿子以实玛利，加利亚的儿子约哈难，尼陀法人单户蔑的儿子西莱雅，玛迦人的儿子雅撒尼亚，和属他们的人都到米斯巴见基大利。</p>
<p>And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard
that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to
Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the
son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and
Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
<p>25:24
基大利向他们和属他们的人起誓说，你们不必惧怕迦勒底臣仆，只管住在这地服事巴比伦王，就可以得福。</p>
<p>And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them,
Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and
serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you.</p>
<p>25:25
七月间，宗室以利沙玛的孙子，尼探雅的儿子以实玛利带着十个人来，杀了基大利和同他在米斯巴的犹大人与迦勒底人。</p>
<p>But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men
with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the
Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.</p>
<p>25:26
于是众民，无论大小，连众军长。因为惧怕迦勒底人，都起身往埃及去了。</p>
<p>And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the
armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the
Chaldees.</p>
<p>25:27
犹大王约雅斤被掳后三十七年，巴比伦王以未米罗达元年十二月二十七日，使犹大王约雅斤抬头，提他出监。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and
twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the
year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of
Judah out of prison;</p>
<p>25:28 又对他说恩言，使他的位高过与他一同在巴比伦众王的位，</p>
<p>And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of
the kings that were with him in Babylon;</p>
<p>25:29 给他脱了囚服。他终身常在巴比伦王面前吃饭。</p>
<p>And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually
before him all the days of his life.</p>
<p>25:30 王赐他所需用的食物，日日赐他一分，终身都是这样。</p>
<p>And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the king, a
daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.</p>
