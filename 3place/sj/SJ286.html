<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记下2-samuel-第-19-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记下(2 Samuel) – 第 19 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>19:1 有人告诉约押说，王为押沙龙哭泣悲哀。</p>
<p>And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for
Absalom.</p>
<p>19:2 众民听说王为他儿子忧愁，他们得胜的欢乐却变成悲哀。</p>
<p>And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for
his son.</p>
<p>19:3 那日众民暗暗地进城，就如败阵逃跑，惭愧的民一般。</p>
<p>And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people
being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p>
<p>19:4 王蒙着脸，大声哭号说，我儿押沙龙阿。押沙龙，我儿，我儿阿。</p>
<p>But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice,
O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>
<p>19:5
约押进去见王，说，你今日使你一切仆人脸面惭愧了。他们今日救了你的性命和你儿女妻妾的性命，</p>
<p>And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed
this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy
life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of
thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines;</p>
<p>19:6
你却爱那恨你的人，恨那爱你的人。你今日明明地不以将帅，仆人为念。我今日看明，若押沙龙活着，我们都死亡，你就喜悦了。</p>
<p>In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou
hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor
servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we
had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.</p>
<p>19:7
现在你当出去，安慰你仆人的心。我指着耶和华起誓，你若不出去，今夜必无一人与你同在一处。这祸患就比你从幼年到如今所遭的更甚。</p>
<p>Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not
tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than
all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.</p>
<p>19:8
于是王起来，坐在城门口。众民听说王坐在城门口，就都到王面前。以色列人已经逃跑，各回各家去了。</p>
<p>Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the
people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the
people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his
tent.</p>
<p>19:9
以色列众支派的人纷纷议论说，王曾救我们脱离仇敌的手，又救我们脱离非利士人的手，现在他躲避押沙龙逃走了。</p>
<p>And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he
delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out
of the land for Absalom.</p>
<p>19:10
我们膏押沙龙治理我们，他已经阵亡。现在为什么不出一言请王回来呢。</p>
<p>And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p>
<p>19:11
大卫王差人去见祭司撒督和亚比亚他，说，你们当向犹大长老说，以色列众人已经有话请王回宫，你们为什么落在他们后头呢。</p>
<p>And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying,
Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the
king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the
king, even to his house.</p>
<p>19:12 你们是我的弟兄，是我的骨肉，为什么在人后头请王回来呢。</p>
<p>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are
ye the last to bring back the king?</p>
<p>19:13
也要对亚玛撒说，你不是我的骨肉吗。我若不立你替约押常作元帅，愿神重重地降罚与我。</p>
<p>And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do
so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me
continually in the room of Joab.</p>
<p>19:14
如此就挽回犹大众人的心，如同一人的心。他们便打发人去见王，说，请王和王的一切臣仆回来。</p>
<p>And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of
one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all
thy servants.</p>
<p>19:15
王就回来，到了约旦河。犹大人来到吉甲，要去迎接王，请他过约旦河。</p>
<p>So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal,
to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan.</p>
<p>19:16
巴户琳的便雅悯人，基拉的儿子示每急忙与犹大人一同下去迎接大卫王。</p>
<p>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted
and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p>
<p>19:17
跟从示每的有一千便雅悯人，还有扫罗家的仆人洗巴和他十五个儿子，二十个仆人。他们都趟过约旦河迎接王。</p>
<p>And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the
servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty
servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king.</p>
<p>19:18
有摆渡船过去，渡王的家眷，任王使用。王要过约旦河的时候，基拉的儿子示每就俯伏在王面前，</p>
<p>And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king’s household,
and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down
before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p>
<p>19:19
对王说，我主我王出耶路撒冷的时候，仆人行悖逆的事，现在求我主不要因此加罪与仆人，不要记念，也不要放在心上。</p>
<p>And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me,
neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day
that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take
it to his heart.</p>
<p>19:20
仆人明知自己有罪，所以约瑟全家之中，今日我首先下来迎接我主我王。</p>
<p>For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am
come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my
lord the king.</p>
<p>19:21
洗鲁雅的儿子亚比筛说，示每既咒骂耶和华的受膏者，不应当治死他吗。</p>
<p>But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be
put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p>19:22
大卫说，洗鲁雅的儿子，我与你们有何关涉，使你们今日与我反对呢。今日在以色列中岂可治死人呢。我岂不知今日我作以色列的王吗。</p>
<p>And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that
ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to
death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over
Israel?</p>
<p>19:23 于是王对示每说，你必不死。王就向他起誓。</p>
<p>Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king
sware unto him.</p>
<p>19:24
扫罗的孙子米非波设也下去迎接王。他自从王去的日子，直到王平平安安地回来，没有修脚，没有剃胡须，也没有洗衣服。</p>
<p>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had
neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes,
from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.</p>
<p>19:25
他来到耶路撒冷迎接王的时候，王问他说，米非波设，你为什么没有与我同去呢。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king,
that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me,
Mephibosheth?</p>
<p>19:26
他回答说，我主我王，仆人是瘸腿的。那日我想要备驴骑上，与王同去，无奈我的仆人欺哄了我，</p>
<p>And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy
servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go
to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p>
<p>19:27
又在我主我王面前谗毁我。然而我主我王如同神的使者一般，你看怎样好，就怎样行吧。</p>
<p>And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord
the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine
eyes.</p>
<p>19:28
因为我祖全家的人，在我主我王面前都算为死人，王却使仆人在王的席上同人吃饭，我现在向王还能辨理诉冤吗。</p>
<p>For all of my father’s house were but dead men before my lord the
king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine
own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the
king?</p>
<p>19:29 王对他说，你何必再提你的事呢。我说，你与洗巴均分地土。</p>
<p>And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p>
<p>19:30
米非波设对王说，我主我王既平平安安地回宫，就任凭洗巴都取了也可以。</p>
<p>And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch
as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.</p>
<p>19:31
基列人巴西莱从罗基琳下来，要送王过约旦河，就与王一同过了约旦河。</p>
<p>And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over
Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p>
<p>19:32
巴西莱年纪老迈，已经八十岁了。王住在玛哈念的时候，他就拿食物来供给王。他原是大富户。</p>
<p>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he
had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was
a very great man.</p>
<p>19:33 王对巴西莱说，你与我同去，我要在耶路撒冷那里养你的老。</p>
<p>And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will
feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>19:34
巴西莱对王说，我在世的年日还能有多少，使我与王同上耶路撒冷呢。</p>
<p>And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I
should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p>
<p>19:35
仆人现在八十岁了，还能尝出饮食的滋味，辨别美恶吗。还能听男女歌唱的声音吗。仆人何必累赘我主我王呢。</p>
<p>I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and
evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any
more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should
thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?</p>
<p>19:36 仆人只要送王过约旦河，王何必赐我这样的恩典呢。</p>
<p>Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why
should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p>
<p>19:37
求你准我回去，好死在我本城，葬在我父母的墓旁。这里有王的仆人金罕，让他同我主我王过去，可以随意待他。</p>
<p>Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine
own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But
behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and
do to him what shall seem good unto thee.</p>
<p>19:38
王说，金罕可以与我同去，我必照你的心愿待他。你向我求什么，我都必为你成就。</p>
<p>And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do
to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt
require of me, that will I do for thee.</p>
<p>19:39
于是众民过约旦河，王也过去。王与巴西莱亲嘴，为他祝福，巴西莱就回本地去了。</p>
<p>And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over,
the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own
place.</p>
<p>19:40
王过去，到了吉甲，金罕也跟他过去。犹大众民和以色列民的一半也都送王过去。</p>
<p>Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and
all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of
Israel.</p>
<p>19:41
以色列众人来见王，对他说，我们弟兄犹大人为什么暗暗送王和王的家眷，并跟随王的人过约旦河。</p>
<p>And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto
the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and
have brought the king, and his household, and all David’s men with him,
over Jordan?</p>
<p>19:42
犹大众人回答以色列人说，因为王与我们是亲属，你们为何因这事发怒呢。我们吃了王的什么呢。王赏赐了我们什么呢。</p>
<p>And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king
is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have
we eaten at all of the king’s cost? or hath he given us any gift?</p>
<p>19:43
以色列人回答犹大人说，按支派，我们与王有十分的情分。在大卫身上，我们也比你们更有情分。你们为何藐视我们，请王回来不先与我们商量呢。但犹大人的话比以色列人的话更硬。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have
ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye: why
then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in
bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer
than the words of the men of Israel.</p>
