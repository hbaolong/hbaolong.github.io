<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第38-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第38 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>38:1 那时，犹大离开他弟兄下去，到一个亚杜兰人名叫希拉的家里去。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his
brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was
Hirah.</p>
<p>38:2
犹大在那里看见一个迦南人名叫书亚的女儿，就娶她为妻，与她同房，</p>
<p>And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was
Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>
<p>38:3 她就怀孕生了儿子，犹大给他起名叫珥。</p>
<p>And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>
<p>38:4 她又怀孕生了儿子，母亲给他起名叫俄南。</p>
<p>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name
Onan.</p>
<p>38:5
她复又生了儿子，给他起名叫示拉。她生示拉的时候，犹大正在基悉。</p>
<p>And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name
Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>
<p>38:6 犹大为长子珥娶妻，名叫他玛。</p>
<p>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.</p>
<p>38:7 犹大的长子珥在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华就叫他死了。</p>
<p>And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and
the LORD slew him.</p>
<p>38:8
犹大对俄南说，你当与你哥哥的妻子同房，向她尽你为弟的本分，为你哥哥生子立后。</p>
<p>And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife, and marry
her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>
<p>38:9
俄南知道生子不归自己，所以同房的时候便遗在地，免得给他哥哥留后。</p>
<p>And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass,
when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the
ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.</p>
<p>38:10 俄南所作的在耶和华眼中看为恶，耶和华也就叫他死了。</p>
<p>And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him
also.</p>
<p>38:11
犹大心里说，恐怕示拉也死，像他两个哥哥一样，就对他儿妇他玛说，你去，在你父亲家里守寡，等我儿子示拉长大。他玛就回去，住在她父亲家里。</p>
<p>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy
father’s house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest
peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt
in her father’s house.</p>
<p>38:12
过了许久，犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了。犹大得了安慰，就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉上亭拿去，到他剪羊毛的人那里。</p>
<p>And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and
Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he
and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</p>
<p>38:13 有人告诉他玛说，你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了。</p>
<p>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to
Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>
<p>38:14
他玛见示拉已经长大，还没有娶她为妻，就脱了她作寡妇的衣裳，用帕子蒙着脸，又遮住身体，坐在亭拿路上的伊拿印城门口。</p>
<p>And she put her widow’s garments off from her, and covered her with a
vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which is by the way
to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given
unto him to wife.</p>
<p>38:15 犹大看见她，以为是妓女，因为她蒙着脸。</p>
<p>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had
covered her face.</p>
<p>38:16
犹大就转到她那里去，说，来吧。让我与你同寝。他原不知道是他的儿妇。他玛说，你要与我同寝，把什么给我呢，</p>
<p>And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let
me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in
law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in
unto me?</p>
<p>38:17
犹大说，我从羊群里取一只山羊羔，打发人送来给你。他玛说，在未送以先，你愿意给我一个当头吗，</p>
<p>And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said,
Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?</p>
<p>38:18
他说，我给你什么当头呢，他玛说，你的印，你的带子，和你手里的杖。犹大就给了她，与她同寝，她就从犹大怀了孕。</p>
<p>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet,
and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave it
her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.</p>
<p>38:19 他玛起来走了，除去帕子，仍旧穿上作寡妇的衣裳。</p>
<p>And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put
on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
<p>38:20
犹大托他朋友亚杜兰人送一只山羊羔去，要从那女人手里取回当头来，却找不着她。</p>
<p>And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to
receive his pledge from the woman’s hand: but he found her not.</p>
<p>38:21
就问那地方的人说，伊拿印路旁的妓女在哪里，他们说，这里并没有妓女。</p>
<p>Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot,
that was openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in
this place.</p>
<p>38:22
他回去见犹大说，我没有找着她，并且那地方的人说，这里没有妓女。</p>
<p>And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the
men of the place said, that there was no harlot in this place.</p>
<p>38:23
犹大说，我把这山羊羔送去了，你竟找不着她。任凭她拿去吧，免得我们被羞辱。</p>
<p>And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I
sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>
<p>38:24
约过了三个月，有人告诉犹大说，你的儿妇他玛作了妓女，且因行淫有了身孕。犹大说，拉出她来，把她烧了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah,
saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also,
behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth,
and let her be burnt.</p>
<p>38:25
他玛被拉出来的时候便打发人去见她公公，对他说，这些东西是谁的，我就是从谁怀的孕。请你认一认，这印和带子并杖都是谁的，</p>
<p>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By
the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray
thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.</p>
<p>38:26
犹大承认说，她比我更有义，因为我没有将她给我的儿子示拉。从此犹大不再与她同寝了。</p>
<p>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous
than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her
again no more.</p>
<p>38:27 他玛将要生产，不料她腹里是一对双生。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins
were in her womb.</p>
<p>38:28
到生产的时候，一个孩子伸出一只手来。收生婆拿红线拴在他手上，说，这是头生的。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his
hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread,
saying, This came out first.</p>
<p>38:29
随后这孩子把手收回去，他哥哥生出来了。收生婆说，你为什么抢着来呢，因此给他起名叫法勒斯。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his
brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach
be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.</p>
<p>38:30 后来，他兄弟那手上有红线的也生出来，就给他起名叫谢拉。</p>
<p>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon
his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>
