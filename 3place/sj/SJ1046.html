<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-28-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 28 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>28:1 我们既已得救，才知道那岛名叫马耳他。</p>
<p>And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called
Melita.</p>
<p>28:2
土人看待我们，有非常的情分，因为当时下雨，天气又冷，就生火，接待我们众人。</p>
<p>And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain,
and because of the cold.</p>
<p>28:3
那时保罗拾起一捆柴，放在火上，有一条毒蛇，因为热了出来，咬住他的手。</p>
<p>And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the
fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</p>
<p>28:4
土人看见那毒蛇，悬在他手上，就彼此说，这人必是个凶手，虽然从海里救上来，天理还不容他活着。</p>
<p>And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they
said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he
hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
<p>28:5 保罗竟把那蛇，甩在火里，并没有受伤。</p>
<p>And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
<p>28:6
土人想他必要肿起来，或是忽然仆倒死了。看了多时，见他无害，就转念说，他是个神。</p>
<p>Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead
suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come
to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p>28:7
离那地方不远，有田产是岛长部百流的。他接纳我们，尽情款待三日。</p>
<p>In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island,
whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days
courteously.</p>
<p>28:8
当时，部百流的父亲，患热病和痢疾躺着。保罗进去，为他祷告，按手在他身上，治好了他。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever
and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his
hands on him, and healed him.</p>
<p>28:9 从此，岛上其馀的病人，也来得了医治。</p>
<p>So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island,
came, and were healed:</p>
<p>28:10
他们又多方的尊敬我们。到了开船的时候，也把我们所需用的送到船上。</p>
<p>Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they
laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>
<p>28:11
过了三个月，我们上了亚力山太的船，往前行。这船以宙斯双子为记，是在海岛过了冬的。</p>
<p>And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had
wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p>28:12 到了叙拉古，我们停泊三日。</p>
<p>And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>
<p>28:13
又从那里绕行，来到利基翁。过了一天，起了南风，第二天就来到部丢利。</p>
<p>And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after
one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>
<p>28:14 在那里遇见弟兄们，请我们与他们同住七天。这样我们来到罗马。</p>
<p>Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven
days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
<p>28:15
那里的弟兄们，一听见我们的信息，就出来到亚比乌市，和三馆地方迎接我们。保罗见了他们，就感谢神，放心壮胆。</p>
<p>And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us
as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he
thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p>28:16
进了罗马城，（有古卷在此有百夫长把众囚犯交给御营的统领惟有）保罗蒙准，和一个看守他的兵，另住在一处。</p>
<p>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to
the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with
a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p>28:17
过了三天，保罗请犹太人的首领来。他们来了，就对他们说，弟兄们，我虽没有作什么事干犯本国的百姓，和我们祖宗的规条，却被锁绑，从耶路撒冷解在罗马人的手里。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of
the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them,
Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or
customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into
the hands of the Romans.</p>
<p>28:18 他们审问了我，就愿意释放我。因为在我身上，并没有该死的罪。</p>
<p>Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there
was no cause of death in me.</p>
<p>28:19
无奈犹太人不服，我不得己，只好上告于凯撒。并没有什么事，要控告我本国的百姓。</p>
<p>But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto
Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
<p>28:20
因此，我请你们来见面说话。我原为以色列人所指望的，被这链子捆锁。</p>
<p>For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to
speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this
chain.</p>
<p>28:21
他们说，我们并没有接着从犹太来论你的信，也没有弟兄到这里来，报信给我们说，你有什么不好处。</p>
<p>And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea
concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake
any harm of thee.</p>
<p>28:22
但我们愿意听你的意见如何。因为这教门，我们晓得是到处被毁谤的。</p>
<p>But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning
this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p>28:23
他们和保罗约定了日子，就有许多人到他的寓处来，保罗从早到晚，对他们讲论这事，证明神国的道，引摩西的律法和先知的书，以耶稣的事，劝勉他们。</p>
<p>And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into
his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out
of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
<p>28:24 他所说的话，有信的，有不信的。</p>
<p>And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed
not.</p>
<p>28:25
他们彼此不合，就散了。未散以先，保罗说了一句话，说，圣灵藉先知以赛亚，向你们祖宗所说的话，是不错的。</p>
<p>And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that
Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the
prophet unto our fathers,</p>
<p>28:26
他说，你去告诉这百姓说，你们听是要听见，却不明白。看是要看见，却不晓得。</p>
<p>Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and
shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p>28:27
因为这百姓，油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。</p>
<p>For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull
of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart,
and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p>28:28
所以你们当知道，神这救恩，如今传给外邦人，他们也必听受。（有古卷在此有，</p>
<p>Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent
unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
<p>28:29 保罗说了这话犹太人议论纷纷的就走了）。</p>
<p>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great
reasoning among themselves.</p>
<p>28:30
保罗在自己所租的房子里，住了足足两年。凡来见他的人，他全都接待，</p>
<p>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received
all that came in unto him,</p>
<p>28:31 放胆传讲神国的道，将耶稣基督的事教导人，并没有人禁止。</p>
<p>Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern
the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</p>
