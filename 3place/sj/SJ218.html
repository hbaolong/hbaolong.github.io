<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-7-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 7 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>7:1
耶路巴力就是基甸，他和一切跟随的人早晨起来，在哈律泉旁安营。米甸营在他们北边的平原，靠近摩利冈。</p>
<p>Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him,
rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of
the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in
the valley.</p>
<p>7:2
耶和华对基甸说，跟随你的人过多，我不能将米甸人交在他们手中，免得以色列人向我夸大，说，是我们自己的手救了我们。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too
many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt
themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</p>
<p>7:3
现在你要向这些人宣告说，凡惧怕胆怯的，可以离开基列山回去。于是有二万二千人回去，只剩下一万。</p>
<p>Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,
Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from
mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand;
and there remained ten thousand.</p>
<p>7:4
耶和华对基甸说，人还是过多。你要带他们下到水旁，我好在那里为你试试他们。我指点谁说，这人可以同你去，他就可以同你去。我指点谁说，这人不可同你去，他就不可同你去。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring
them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it
shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the
same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall
not go with thee, the same shall not go.</p>
<p>7:5
基甸就带他们下到水旁。耶和华对基甸说，凡用舌头舔水，像狗舔的，要使他单站在一处。凡跪下喝水的，也要使他单站在一处。</p>
<p>So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto
Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog
lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth
down upon his knees to drink.</p>
<p>7:6 于是用手捧着舔水的有三百人，其馀的都跪下喝水。</p>
<p>And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their
mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down
upon their knees to drink water.</p>
<p>7:7
耶和华对基甸说，我要用这舔水的三百人拯救你们，将米甸人交在你手中。其馀的人都可以各归各处去。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped
will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all
the other people go every man unto his place.</p>
<p>7:8
这三百人就带着食物和角。其馀的以色列人，基甸都打发他们各归各的帐棚，只留下这三百人。米甸营在他下边的平原里。</p>
<p>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he
sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those
three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the
valley.</p>
<p>7:9
当那夜，耶和华吩咐基甸说，起来，下到米甸营里去，因我已将他们交在你手中。</p>
<p>And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,
Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine
hand.</p>
<p>7:10 倘若你怕下去，就带你的仆人普拉下到那营里去。</p>
<p>But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to
the host:</p>
<p>7:11
你必听见他们所说的，然后你就有胆量下去攻营。于是基甸带着仆人普拉下到营旁。</p>
<p>And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be
strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his
servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</p>
<p>7:12
米甸人，亚玛力人，和一切东方人都布散在平原，如同蝗虫那样多。他们的骆驼无数，多如海边的沙。</p>
<p>And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the
east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their
camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for
multitude.</p>
<p>7:13
基甸到了，就听见一人将梦告诉同伴说，我作了一梦，梦见一个大麦饼滚入米甸营中，到了帐幕，将帐幕撞倒，帐幕就翻转倾覆了。</p>
<p>And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream
unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of
barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and
smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>
<p>7:14
那同伴说，这不是别的，乃是以色列人约阿施的儿子基甸的刀。神已将米甸和全军都交在他的手中。</p>
<p>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword
of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God
delivered Midian, and all the host.</p>
<p>7:15
基甸听见这梦和梦的讲解，就敬拜神，回到以色列营中，说，起来吧。耶和华已将米甸的军队交在你们手中了。</p>
<p>And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the
interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host
of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand
the host of Midian.</p>
<p>7:16
于是基甸将三百人分作三队，把角和空瓶交在各人手里，瓶内都藏着火把，</p>
<p>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put
a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the
pitchers.</p>
<p>7:17
吩咐他们说，你们要看我行事，我到了营的旁边怎样行，你们也要怎样行。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when
I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall
ye do.</p>
<p>7:18
我和一切跟随我的人吹角的时候，你们也要在营的四围吹角，喊叫说，耶和华和基甸的刀。</p>
<p>When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye
the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of
the LORD, and of Gideon.</p>
<p>7:19
基甸和跟随他的一百人，在三更之初才换更的时候，来到营旁，就吹角，打破手中的瓶。</p>
<p>So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the
outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had
but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the
pitchers that were in their hands.</p>
<p>7:20
三队的人就都吹角，打破瓶子，左手拿着火把，右手拿着角，喊叫说，耶和华和基甸的刀。</p>
<p>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers,
and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right
hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of
Gideon.</p>
<p>7:21
他们在营的四围各站各的地方。全营的人都乱窜。三百人呐喊，使他们逃跑。</p>
<p>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all
the host ran, and cried, and fled.</p>
<p>7:22
三百人就吹角，耶和华使全营的人用刀互相击杀，逃到西利拉的伯哈示他，直逃到靠近他巴的亚伯米何拉。</p>
<p>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man’s
sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host
fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto
Tabbath.</p>
<p>7:23 以色列人就从拿弗他利，亚设，和玛拿西全地聚集来追赶米甸人。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali,
and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the
Midianites.</p>
<p>7:24
基甸打发人走遍以法莲山地，说，你们下来攻击米甸人，争先把守约旦河的渡口，直到伯巴拉。于是以法莲的众人聚集，把守约旦河的渡口，直到伯巴拉，</p>
<p>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come
down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto
Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves
together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.</p>
<p>7:25
捉住了米甸人的两个首领，一名俄立，一名西伊伯。将俄立杀在俄立磐石上，将西伊伯杀在西伊伯酒榨那里。又追赶米甸人，将俄立和西伊伯的首级带过约旦河，到基甸那里。</p>
<p>And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they
slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of
Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to
Gideon on the other side Jordan.</p>
