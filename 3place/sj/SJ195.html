<h4 id="旧约-约书亚记joshua-第-8-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
耶和华对约书亚说，不要惧怕，也不要惊惶。你起来，率领一切兵丁上艾城去，我已经把艾城的王和他的民，他的城，并他的地，都交在你手里。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed:
take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I
have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city,
and his land:</p>
<p>8:2
你怎样待耶利哥和耶利哥的王，也当照样待艾城和艾城的王。只是城内所夺的财物和牲畜，你们可以取为自己的掠物。你要在城后设下伏兵。</p>
<p>And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and
her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take
for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind
it.</p>
<p>8:3
于是，约书亚和一切兵丁都起来，要上艾城去。约书亚选了三万大能的勇士，夜间打发他们前往，</p>
<p>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and
Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them
away by night.</p>
<p>8:4 吩咐他们说，你们要在城后埋伏，不可离城太远，都要各自准备。</p>
<p>And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against
the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye
all ready:</p>
<p>8:5
我与我所带领的众民要向城前往。城里的人像初次出来攻击我们的时候，我们就在他们面前逃跑，</p>
<p>And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto the
city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at
the first, that we will flee before them,</p>
<p>8:6
他们必出来追赶我们，直到我们引诱他们离开城。因为他们必说，这些人像初次在我们面前逃跑。所以我们要在他们面前逃跑，</p>
<p>(For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the
city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore
we will flee before them.</p>
<p>8:7
你们就从埋伏的地方起来，夺取那城。因为耶和华你们的神，必把城交在你们手里。</p>
<p>Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for
the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.</p>
<p>8:8
你们夺了城以后，就放火烧城，要照耶和华的话行。这是我吩咐你们的。</p>
<p>And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall set the
city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See,
I have commanded you.</p>
<p>8:9
约书亚打发他们前往，他们就上埋伏的地方去，住在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边。这夜约书亚却在民中住宿。</p>
<p>Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and
abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged
that night among the people.</p>
<p>8:10
约书亚清早起来，点齐百姓，他和以色列的长老在百姓前面上艾城去。</p>
<p>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and
went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</p>
<p>8:11
众民，就是他所带领的兵丁，都上去，向前直往，来到城前，在艾城北边安营。在约书亚和艾城中间有一山谷。</p>
<p>And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went
up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north
side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</p>
<p>8:12
他挑了约有五千人，使他们埋伏在伯特利和艾城的中间，就是在艾城的西边，</p>
<p>And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush
between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.</p>
<p>8:13
于是安置了百姓，就是城北的全军和城西的伏兵。这夜约书亚进入山谷之中。</p>
<p>And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the
north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city,
Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p>
<p>8:14
艾城的王看见这景况，就和全城的人，清早急忙起来，按所定的时候，出到亚拉巴前，要与以色列人交战。王却不知道在城后有伏兵。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted and
rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to
battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain;
but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the
city.</p>
<p>8:15 约书亚和以色列众人在他们面前装败，往那通旷野的路逃跑。</p>
<p>And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,
and fled by the way of the wilderness.</p>
<p>8:16
城内的众民都被招聚，追赶他们。艾城人追赶的时候，就被引诱离开城。</p>
<p>And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue
after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the
city.</p>
<p>8:17
艾城和伯特利城没有一人不出来追赶以色列人的，撇了敞开的城门，去追赶以色列人。</p>
<p>And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after
Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</p>
<p>8:18
耶和华吩咐约书亚说，你向艾城伸出手里的短枪，因为我要将城交在你手里。约书亚就向城伸出手里的短枪。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is in thy
hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched
out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city.</p>
<p>8:19
他一伸手，伏兵就从埋伏的地方急忙起来，夺了城，跑进城去，放火焚烧。</p>
<p>And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon
as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and
took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</p>
<p>8:20
艾城的人回头一看，不料，城中烟气冲天，他们就无力向左向右逃跑。那往旷野逃跑的百姓便转身攻击追赶他们的人。</p>
<p>And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the
smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee
this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned
back upon the pursuers.</p>
<p>8:21
约书亚和以色列众人见伏兵已经夺了城，城中烟气飞腾，就转身回去，击杀艾城的人。</p>
<p>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the
city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,
and slew the men of Ai.</p>
<p>8:22
伏兵也出城迎击艾城人，艾城人就困在以色列人中间，前后都是以色列人。于是以色列人击杀他们，没有留下一个，也没有一个逃脱的，</p>
<p>And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in
the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they
smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</p>
<p>8:23 生擒了艾城的王，将他解到约书亚那里。</p>
<p>And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</p>
<p>8:24
以色列人在田间和旷野杀尽所追赶一切艾城的居民。艾城人倒在刀下，直到灭尽。以色列众人就回到艾城，用刀杀了城中的人。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the
inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased
them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they
were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it
with the edge of the sword.</p>
<p>8:25 当日杀毙的人，连男带女共有一万二千，就是艾城所有的人。</p>
<p>And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and women,
were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.</p>
<p>8:26
约书亚没有收回手里所伸出来的短枪，直到把艾城的一切居民尽行杀灭。</p>
<p>For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the
spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</p>
<p>8:27
惟独城中的牲畜和财物，以色列人都取为自己的掠物，是照耶和华所吩咐约书亚的话。</p>
<p>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey
unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded
Joshua.</p>
<p>8:28 约书亚将艾城焚烧，使城永为高堆，荒场，直到今日。</p>
<p>And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a desolation
unto this day.</p>
<p>8:29
又将艾城王挂在树上，直到晚上。日落的时候，约书亚吩咐人把尸首从树上取下来，丢在城门口，在尸首上堆成一大堆石头，直存到今日。</p>
<p>And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as
the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase
down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city,
and raise thereon a great heap of stones, that remaineth unto this
day.</p>
<p>8:30 那时，约书亚在艺巴路山上为耶和华以色列的神筑一座坛，</p>
<p>Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount
Ebal,</p>
<p>8:31
是用没有动过铁器的整石头筑的，照着耶和华仆人摩西所吩咐以色列人的话，正如摩西律法书上所写的。众人在这坛上给耶和华奉献燔祭和平安祭。</p>
<p>As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as
it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones,
over which no man hath lift up any iron: and they offered thereon burnt
offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</p>
<p>8:32
约书亚在那里，当着以色列人面前，将摩西所写的律法抄写在石头上。</p>
<p>And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which
he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>8:33
以色列众人，无论是本地人，是寄居的，和长老，官长，并审判官，都站在约柜两旁，在抬耶和华约柜的祭司利未人面前，一半对着基利心山，一半对着以巴路山，为以色列民祝福，正如耶和华仆人摩西先前所吩咐的。</p>
<p>And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges,
stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the
Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the
stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against
mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the
servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the
people of Israel.</p>
<p>8:34
随后，约书亚将律法上祝福，咒诅的话，照着律法书上一切所写的，都宣读了一遍。</p>
<p>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and
cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</p>
<p>8:35
摩西所吩咐的一切话，约书亚在以色列全会众和妇女，孩子，并他们中间寄居的外人面前，没有一句不宣读的。</p>
<p>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read
not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the
little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</p>
