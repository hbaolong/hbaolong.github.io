<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记下2-samuel-第-13-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记下(2 Samuel) – 第 13 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>13:1
大卫的儿子押沙龙有一个美貌的妹子，名叫他玛。大卫的儿子暗嫩爱她。</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a
fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved
her.</p>
<p>13:2 暗嫩为他妹子他玛忧急成病。他玛还是处女，暗嫩以为难向她行事。</p>
<p>And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for
she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to
her.</p>
<p>13:3
暗嫩有一个朋友，名叫约拿达，是大卫长兄示米亚的儿子。这约拿达为人极其狡猾。</p>
<p>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah
David’s brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</p>
<p>13:4
他问暗嫩说，王的儿子阿，为何一天比一天瘦弱呢。请你告诉我。暗嫩回答说，我爱我兄弟押沙龙的妹子他玛。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, lean from
day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love
Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</p>
<p>13:5
约拿达说，你不如躺在床上装病。你父亲来看你，就对他说，求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前预备食物，递给我吃，使我看见，好从她手里接过来吃。</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself
sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee,
let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my
sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.</p>
<p>13:6
于是暗嫩躺卧装病。王来看他，他对王说，求父叫我妹子他玛来，在我眼前为我作两个饼，我好从她手里接过来吃。</p>
<p>So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come
to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister
come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her
hand.</p>
<p>13:7
大卫就打发人到宫里，对他玛说，你往你哥哥暗嫩的屋里去，为他预备食物。</p>
<p>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s
house, and dress him meat.</p>
<p>13:8
他玛就到她哥哥暗嫩的屋里。暗嫩正躺卧。他玛抟面，在他眼前作饼，且烤熟了，</p>
<p>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house; and he was laid down. And
she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did
bake the cakes.</p>
<p>13:9
在他面前将饼从锅里倒出来，他却不肯吃，便说，众人离开我出去吧。众人就都离开他，出去了。</p>
<p>And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to
eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every
man from him.</p>
<p>13:10
暗嫩对他玛说，你把食物拿进卧房，我好从你手里接过来吃。他玛就把所作的饼拿进卧房，到她哥哥暗嫩那里，</p>
<p>And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I
may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and
brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</p>
<p>13:11 拿着饼上前给他吃，他便拉住他玛，说，我妹妹，你来与我同寝。</p>
<p>And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her,
and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</p>
<p>13:12
他玛说，我哥哥，不要玷辱我。以色列人中不当这样行，你不要作这丑事。</p>
<p>And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such
thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</p>
<p>13:13
你玷辱了我，我何以掩盖我的羞耻呢。你在以色列中也成了愚妄人。你可以求王，他必不禁止我归你。</p>
<p>And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou
shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee,
speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee.</p>
<p>13:14 但暗嫩不肯听她的话，因比她力大，就玷辱她，与她同寝。</p>
<p>Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than
she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>
<p>13:15
随后，暗嫩极其恨她，那恨她的心比先前爱她的心更甚，对她说，你起来，去吧。</p>
<p>Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he
hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And
Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>
<p>13:16
他玛说，不要这样。你赶出我去的这罪比你才行的更重。但暗嫩不肯听她的话，</p>
<p>And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending me
away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not
hearken unto her.</p>
<p>13:17
就叫伺候自己的仆人来，说，将这个女子赶出去。她一出去，你就关门，上闩。</p>
<p>Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put
now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</p>
<p>13:18
那时他玛穿着彩衣，因为没有出嫁的公主都是这样穿。暗嫩的仆人就把她赶出去，关门上闩。</p>
<p>And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes
were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant
brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</p>
<p>13:19
他玛把灰尘撒在头上，撕裂所穿的彩衣，以手抱头，一面行走，一面哭喊。</p>
<p>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers
colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on
crying.</p>
<p>13:20
她胞兄押沙龙问她说，莫非你哥哥暗嫩与你亲近了吗。我妹妹，暂且不要作声，他是你的哥哥，不要将这事放在心上。他玛就孤孤单单地住在她胞兄押沙龙家里。</p>
<p>And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been
with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard
not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s
house.</p>
<p>13:21 大卫王听见这事，就甚发怒。</p>
<p>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth.</p>
<p>13:22
押沙龙并不和他哥哥暗嫩说好说歹。因为暗嫩玷辱他妹妹他玛，所以押沙龙恨恶他。</p>
<p>And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for
Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</p>
<p>13:23
过了二年，在靠近以法莲的巴力夏琐有人为押沙龙剪羊毛。押沙龙请王的众子与他同去。</p>
<p>And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited
all the king’s sons.</p>
<p>13:24
押沙龙来见王，说，现在有人为仆人剪羊毛，请王和王的臣仆与仆人同去。</p>
<p>And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath
sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with
thy servant.</p>
<p>13:25
王对押沙龙说，我儿，我们不必都去，恐怕使你耗费太多。押沙龙再三请王，王仍是不肯去，只为他祝福。</p>
<p>And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go,
lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would
not go, but blessed him.</p>
<p>13:26
押沙龙说，王若不去，求王许我哥哥暗嫩同去。王说，何必要他去呢。</p>
<p>Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with
us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?</p>
<p>13:27 押沙龙再三求王，王就许暗嫩和王的众子与他同去。</p>
<p>But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go
with him.</p>
<p>13:28
押沙龙吩咐仆人说，你们注意，看暗嫩饮酒畅快的时候，我对你们说杀暗嫩，你们便杀他，不要惧怕。这不是我吩咐你们的吗。你们只管壮胆奋勇。</p>
<p>Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when
Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon;
then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be
valiant.</p>
<p>13:29
押沙龙的仆人就照押沙龙所吩咐的，向暗嫩行了。王的众子都起来，各人骑上骡子，逃跑了。</p>
<p>And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded.
Then all the king’s sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule,
and fled.</p>
<p>13:30
他们还在路上，有风声传到大卫那里，说，押沙龙将王的众子都杀了，没有留下一个。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to
David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king’s sons, and there is not
one of them left.</p>
<p>13:31
王就起来，撕裂衣服，躺在地上。王的臣仆也都撕裂衣服，站在旁边。</p>
<p>Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and
all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</p>
<p>13:32
大卫的长兄，示米亚的儿子约拿达说，我主，不要以为王的众子少年人都杀了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。自从暗嫩玷辱押沙龙妹子他玛的那日，押沙龙就定意杀暗嫩了。</p>
<p>And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother, answered and said,
Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the
king’s sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom
this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister
Tamar.</p>
<p>13:33
现在，我主我王，不要把这事放在心上，以为王的众子都死了，只有暗嫩一个人死了。</p>
<p>Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart,
to think that all the king’s sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead.</p>
<p>13:34
押沙龙逃跑了。守望的少年人举目观看，见有许多人从山坡的路上来。</p>
<p>But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his
eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the
hill side behind him.</p>
<p>13:35
约拿达对王说，看哪，王的众子都来了，果然与你仆人所说的相合。</p>
<p>And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come: as thy
servant said, so it is.</p>
<p>13:36 话才说完，王的众子都到了，放声大哭，王和臣仆也都哭得甚恸。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that,
behold, the king’s sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and
the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</p>
<p>13:37
押沙龙逃到基述王亚米忽的儿子达买那里去了。大卫天天为他儿子悲哀。</p>
<p>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of
Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</p>
<p>13:38 押沙龙逃到基述，在那里住了三年。</p>
<p>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</p>
<p>13:39 暗嫩死了以后，大卫王得了安慰，心里切切想念押沙龙。</p>
<p>And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he
was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>
