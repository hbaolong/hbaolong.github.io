<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-8-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
以利沙曾对所救活之子的那妇人说，你和你的全家要起身往你可住的地方去住，因为耶和华命饥荒降在这地七年。</p>
<p>Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life,
saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever
thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall
also come upon the land seven years.</p>
<p>8:2 妇人就起身，照神人的话带着全家往非利士地去，住了七年。</p>
<p>And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and
she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines seven years.</p>
<p>8:3
七年完了，那妇人从非利士地回来，就出去为自己的房屋田地哀告王。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman returned
out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the
king for her house and for her land.</p>
<p>8:4
那时王正与神人的仆人基哈西说，请你将以利沙所行的一切大事告诉我。</p>
<p>And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath
done.</p>
<p>8:5
基哈西告诉王以利沙如何使死人复活，恰巧以利沙所救活，她儿子的那妇人为自己的房屋田地来哀告王。基哈西说，我主我王，这就是那妇人，这是她的儿子，就是以利沙所救活的。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a
dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to
life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said,
My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha
restored to life.</p>
<p>8:6
王问那妇人，她就把那事告诉王。于是王为她派一个太监，说，凡属这妇人的都还给她，自从她离开本地直到今日，她田地的出产也都还给她。</p>
<p>And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers,
and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land,
even until now.</p>
<p>8:7
以利沙来到大马士革，亚兰王便哈达正患病。有人告诉王说，神人来到这里了。</p>
<p>And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick;
and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</p>
<p>8:8
王就吩咐哈薛说，你带着礼物去见神人，托他求问耶和华，我这病能好不能好。</p>
<p>And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go,
meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I
recover of this disease?</p>
<p>8:9
于是哈薛用四十个骆驼，驮着大马士革的各样美物为礼物，去见以利沙。到了他那里，站在他面前，说，你儿子亚兰王便哈达打发我来见你，他问说，我这病能好不能好。</p>
<p>So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of
every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood
before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to
thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
<p>8:10
以利沙对哈薛说，你回去告诉他说，这病必能好。但耶和华指示我，他必要死。</p>
<p>And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly
recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die.</p>
<p>8:11 神人定睛看着哈薛，甚至他惭愧。神人就哭了。</p>
<p>And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and
the man of God wept.</p>
<p>8:12
哈薛说，我主为什么哭。回答说，因为我知道你必苦害以色列人，用火焚烧他们的保障，用刀杀死他们的壮丁，摔死他们的婴孩，剖开他们的孕妇。</p>
<p>And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know
the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong
holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the
sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with
child.</p>
<p>8:13
哈薛说，你仆人算什么，不过是一条狗，焉能行这大事呢。以利沙回答说，耶和华指示我，你必作亚兰王。</p>
<p>And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do
this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou
shalt be king over Syria.</p>
<p>8:14
哈薛离开以利沙，回去见他的主人。主人问他说，以利沙对你说什么。回答说，他告诉我你必能好。</p>
<p>So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him,
What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou
shouldest surely recover.</p>
<p>8:15
次日，哈薛拿被窝浸在水中，蒙住王的脸，王就死了。于是哈薛篡了他的位。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and
dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and
Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>8:16
以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰第五年，犹大王约沙法还在位的时候，约沙法的儿子约兰登基作了犹大王。</p>
<p>And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat
king of Judah began to reign.</p>
<p>8:17 约兰登基的时候年三十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王八年。</p>
<p>Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>8:18
他行以色列诸王所行的，与亚哈家一样。因为他娶了亚哈的女儿为妻，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。</p>
<p>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of
Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the
sight of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:19
耶和华却因他仆人大卫的缘故，仍不肯灭绝犹大，照他所应许大卫的话，永远赐灯光与他的子孙。</p>
<p>Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s sake, as
he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children.</p>
<p>8:20 约兰年间，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，自己立王。</p>
<p>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a
king over themselves.</p>
<p>8:21
约兰率领所有的战车往撒益去，夜间起来，攻打围困他的以东人和车兵长。犹大兵就逃跑，各回各家去了。</p>
<p>So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he
rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the
captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</p>
<p>8:22
这样，以东人背叛犹大，脱离他的权下，直到今日。那时立拿人也背叛了。</p>
<p>Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then
Libnah revolted at the same time.</p>
<p>8:23 约兰其馀的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>8:24
约兰与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>8:25 以色列王亚哈的儿子约兰十二年，犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢登基。</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</p>
<p>8:26
他登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王一年。他母亲名叫亚他利雅，是以色列王暗利的孙女。</p>
<p>Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he
reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the
daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p>
<p>8:27
亚哈谢效法亚哈家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与亚哈家一样，因为他是亚哈家的女婿。</p>
<p>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the
sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law
of the house of Ahab.</p>
<p>8:28
他与亚哈的儿子约兰同往基列的拉末去，与亚兰王哈薛争战。亚兰人打伤了约兰，</p>
<p>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king
of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p>
<p>8:29
约兰王回到耶斯列，医治在拉末与亚兰王哈薛打仗的时候所受的伤。犹大王约兰的儿子亚哈谢因为亚哈的儿子约兰病了，就下到耶斯列看望他。</p>
<p>And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which
the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king
of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see
Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>
