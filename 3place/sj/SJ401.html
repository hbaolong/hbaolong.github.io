<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-34-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 34 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>34:1 约西亚登基的时候年八岁，在耶路撒冷作王三十一年。</p>
<p>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in
Jerusalem one and thirty years.</p>
<p>34:2 他行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他祖大卫所行的，不偏左右。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked
in the ways of David his father, and declined neither to the right hand,
nor to the left.</p>
<p>34:3
他作王第八年，尚且年幼，就寻求他祖大卫的神。到了十二年才洁净犹大和耶路撒冷，除掉邱坛，木偶，雕刻的像，和铸造的像。</p>
<p>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began
to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he
began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves,
and the carved images, and the molten images.</p>
<p>34:4
众人在他面前拆毁巴力的坛，砍断坛上高高的日像，又把木偶和雕刻的像，并铸造的像打碎成灰，撒在祭偶像人的坟上，</p>
<p>And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the
images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and
the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made
dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed
unto them.</p>
<p>34:5 将他们祭司的骸骨烧在坛上，洁净了犹大和耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed
Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>34:6
又在玛拿西，以法莲，西缅，拿弗他利各城，和四围破坏之处，都这样行。</p>
<p>And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon,
even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.</p>
<p>34:7
又拆毁祭坛，把木偶和雕刻的像打碎成灰，砍断以色列遍地所有的日像，就回耶路撒冷去了。</p>
<p>And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten
the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all
the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>34:8
约西亚王十八年，净地净殿之后，就差遣亚萨利雅的儿子沙番，邑宰玛西雅，约哈斯的儿子史官约亚去修理耶和华他神的殿。</p>
<p>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land,
and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the
governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair
the house of the LORD his God.</p>
<p>34:9
他们就去见大祭司希勒家，将奉到神殿的银子交给他。这银子是看守殿门的利未人从玛拿西，以法莲，和一切以色列剩下的人，以及犹大，便雅悯众人，并耶路撒冷的居民收来的。</p>
<p>And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the
money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that
kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of
all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they
returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>34:10 又将这银子交给耶和华殿里督工的，转交修理耶和华殿的工匠，</p>
<p>And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of
the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in
the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house:</p>
<p>34:11
就是交给木匠，石匠，买凿成的石头和架木与楝梁，修犹大王所毁坏的殿。</p>
<p>Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn stone,
and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of
Judah had destroyed.</p>
<p>34:12
这些人办事诚实，督工的是利未人米拉利的子孙雅哈，俄巴底。督催的是哥辖的子孙撒迦利亚，米书兰。还有善于作乐的利未人。</p>
<p>And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them were
Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah
and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set it forward; and
other of the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick.</p>
<p>34:13
他们又监管扛抬的人，督催一切作工的。利未人中也有作书记，作司事，作守门的。</p>
<p>Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers of all
that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites there
were scribes, and officers, and porters.</p>
<p>34:14
他们将奉到耶和华殿的银子运出来的时候，祭司希勒家偶然得了摩西所传耶和华的律法书。</p>
<p>And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house
of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD
given by Moses.</p>
<p>34:15
希勒家对书记沙番说，我在耶和华殿里得了律法书。遂将书递给沙番。</p>
<p>And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the
book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book
to Shaphan.</p>
<p>34:16 沙番把书拿到王那里，回覆王说，凡交给仆人们办的都办理了。</p>
<p>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word
back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do
it.</p>
<p>34:17 耶和华殿里的银子倒出来，交给督工的和匠人的手里了。</p>
<p>And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house
of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and
to the hand of the workmen.</p>
<p>34:18
书记沙番又对王说，祭司希勒家递给我一卷书。沙番就在王面前读那书。</p>
<p>Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest
hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</p>
<p>34:19 王听见律法上的话，就撕裂衣服，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law,
that he rent his clothes.</p>
<p>34:20
吩咐希勒家与沙番的儿子亚希甘，米迦的儿子亚比顿，书记沙番，和王的臣仆亚撒雅说，</p>
<p>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and
Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of
the king’s, saying,</p>
<p>34:21
你们去为我，为以色列和犹大剩下的人，以这书上的话求问耶和华。因我们列祖没有遵守耶和华的言语，没有照这书上所记的去行，耶和华的烈怒就倒在我们身上。</p>
<p>Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel
and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great
is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers
have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in
this book.</p>
<p>34:22
于是，希勒家和王所派的众人都去见女先知户勒大。户勒大是掌管礼服沙龙的妻，沙龙是哈斯拉的孙子，特瓦的儿子。户勒大住在耶路撒冷第二区。他们请问于她。</p>
<p>And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the
prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah,
keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and
they spake to her to that effect.</p>
<p>34:23
她对他们说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，你们可以回覆那差遣你们来见我的人说，</p>
<p>And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the
man that sent you to me,</p>
<p>34:24
耶和华如此说，我必照着在犹大王面前所读那书上的一切咒诅，降祸与这地和其上的居民。</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and
upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses that are written in
the book which they have read before the king of Judah:</p>
<p>34:25
因为他们离弃我，向别神烧香，用他们手所作的惹我发怒，所以我的忿怒如火倒在这地上，总不息灭。</p>
<p>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other
gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their
hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall
not be quenched.</p>
<p>34:26
然而差遣你们来求问耶和华的犹大王，你们要这样回覆他说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，至于你所听见的话，</p>
<p>And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so
shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel concerning the
words which thou hast heard;</p>
<p>34:27
就是听见我指着这地和其上居民所说的话，你便心里敬服，在我面前自卑，撕裂衣服，向我哭泣，因此我应允了你。这是我耶和华说的。</p>
<p>Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before
God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the
inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy
clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>34:28
我必使你平平安安地归到坟墓，到你列祖那里，我要降与这地和其上居民的一切灾祸，你也不至亲眼看见。他们就回覆王去了。</p>
<p>Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered
to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I
will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So
they brought the king word again.</p>
<p>34:29 王差遣人招聚犹大和耶路撒冷的众长老来。</p>
<p>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>34:30
王和犹大众人，与耶路撒冷的居民，并祭司利未人，以及所有的百姓，无论大小，都一同上到耶和华的殿。王就把殿里所得的约书念给他们听。</p>
<p>And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of
Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the
Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears
all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of
the LORD.</p>
<p>34:31
王站在他的地位上，在耶和华面前立约，要尽心尽性地顺从耶和华，遵守他的诫命，法度，律例，成就这书上所记的约言。</p>
<p>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD,
to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his
testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his
soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this
book.</p>
<p>34:32
又使住耶路撒冷和便雅悯的人都服从这约。于是耶路撒冷的居民都遵行他们列祖之神的约。</p>
<p>And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to
stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the
covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</p>
<p>34:33
约西亚从以色列各处将一切可憎之物尽都除掉，使以色列境内的人都事奉耶和华他们的神。约西亚在世的日子，就跟从耶和华他们列祖的神，总不离开。</p>
<p>And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries
that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present
in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God. And all his days
they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.</p>
