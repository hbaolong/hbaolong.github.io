<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-35-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 35 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>35:1
约西亚在耶路撒冷向耶和华守逾越节。正月十四日，就宰了逾越节的羊羔。</p>
<p>Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they
killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</p>
<p>35:2 王分派祭司各尽其职，又勉励他们办耶和华殿中的事。</p>
<p>And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the
service of the house of the LORD,</p>
<p>35:3
又对那归耶和华为圣，教训以色列人的利未人说，你们将圣约柜安放在以色列王大卫儿子所罗门建造的殿里，不必再用肩扛抬。现在要事奉耶和华你们的神，服事他的民以色列。</p>
<p>And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy
unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of
David king of Israel did build; it shall not be a burden upon your
shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel,</p>
<p>35:4
你们应当按着宗族，照着班次，遵以色列王大卫和他儿子所罗门所写的，自己预备。</p>
<p>And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your
courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according
to the writing of Solomon his son.</p>
<p>35:5
要按着你们的弟兄，这民宗族的班次，站在圣所，每班中要利未宗族的几个人。</p>
<p>And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after the
division of the families of the Levites.</p>
<p>35:6
要宰逾越节的羊羔，洁净自己，为你们的弟兄预备了，好遵守耶和华藉摩西所吩咐的话。</p>
<p>So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your
brethren, that they may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand
of Moses.</p>
<p>35:7
约西亚从群畜中赐给在那里所有的人民，绵羊羔和山羊羔三万只，牛三千只，作逾越节的祭物。这都是出自王的产业中。</p>
<p>And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for
the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of
thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these were of the king’s
substance.</p>
<p>35:8
约西亚的众首领也乐意将牺牲给百姓和祭司利未人。又有管理神殿的希勒家，撒迦利亚，耶歇将羊羔二千六百只，牛三百只，给祭司作逾越节的祭物。</p>
<p>And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and
to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of
God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and
six hundred small cattle, and three hundred oxen.</p>
<p>35:9
利未人的族长歌楠雅和他两个兄弟示玛雅，拿坦业，与哈沙比雅，耶利，约撒拔将羊羔五千只，牛五百只，给利未人作逾越节的祭物。</p>
<p>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the
Levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle, and five
hundred oxen.</p>
<p>35:10
这样，供献的事齐备了。祭司站在自己的地方，利未人按着班次站立，都是照王所吩咐的。</p>
<p>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place,
and the Levites in their courses, according to the king’s
commandment.</p>
<p>35:11
利未人宰了逾越节的羊羔，祭司从他们手里接过血来洒在坛上。利未人剥皮，</p>
<p>And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood
from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.</p>
<p>35:12
将燔祭搬来，按着宗族的班次分给众民，好照摩西书上所写的，献给耶和华。献牛也是这样。</p>
<p>And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according
to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD,
as it is written in the book of Moses. And so did they with the
oxen.</p>
<p>35:13
他们按着常例，用火烤逾越节的羊羔。别的圣物用锅，用釜，用罐煮了，速速地送给众民。</p>
<p>And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance:
but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in
pans, and divided them speedily among all the people.</p>
<p>35:14
然后为自己和祭司预备祭物。因为祭司亚伦的子孙献燔祭和脂油，直到晚上。所以利未人为自己和祭司亚伦的子孙，预备祭物。</p>
<p>And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests:
because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering of burnt
offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for
themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</p>
<p>35:15
歌唱的亚萨之子孙，照着大卫，亚萨，希幔，和王的先见耶杜顿所吩咐的，站在自己的地位上。守门的看守各门，不用离开他们的职事，因为他们的弟兄利未人给他们预备祭物。</p>
<p>And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to
the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s
seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from
their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</p>
<p>35:16
当日，供奉耶和华的事齐备了，就照约西亚王的吩咐守逾越节，献燔祭在耶和华的坛上。</p>
<p>So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the
passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD,
according to the commandment of king Josiah.</p>
<p>35:17 当时在耶路撒冷的以色列人守逾越节，又守除酵节七日。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at
that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</p>
<p>35:18
自从先知撒母耳以来，在以色列中没有守过这样的逾越节，以色列诸王也没有守过，像约西亚，祭司，利未人，在那里的犹大人，和以色列人，以及耶路撒冷居民所守的逾越节。</p>
<p>And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days
of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a
passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah
and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>35:19 这逾越节是约西亚作王十八年守的。</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover
kept.</p>
<p>35:20
这事以后，约西亚修完了殿，有埃及王尼哥上来，要攻击靠近幼发拉底河的迦基米施。约西亚出去抵挡他。</p>
<p>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of
Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went
out against him.</p>
<p>35:21
他差遣使者来见约西亚，说，犹大王阿，我与你何干。我今日来不是要攻击你，乃是要攻击与我争战之家，并且神吩咐我速行，你不要干预神的事，免得他毁灭你，因为神是与我同在。</p>
<p>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee,
thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day, but against the
house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear
thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee
not.</p>
<p>35:22
约西亚却不肯转去离开他，改装要与他打仗，不听从神藉尼哥之口所说的话，便来到米吉多平原争战。</p>
<p>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised
himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words
of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of
Megiddo.</p>
<p>35:23
弓箭手射中约西亚王。王对他的臣仆说，我受了重伤，你拉我出阵吧。</p>
<p>And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</p>
<p>35:24
他的臣仆扶他下了战车，上了次车，送他到耶路撒冷，他就死了，葬在他列祖的坟墓里。犹大人和耶路撒冷人都为他悲哀。</p>
<p>His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in
the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and
he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers. And all
Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</p>
<p>35:25
耶利米为约西亚作哀歌。所有歌唱的男女也唱哀歌，追悼约西亚，直到今日。而且在以色列中成了定例。这歌载在哀歌书上。</p>
<p>And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the
singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and
made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the
lamentations.</p>
<p>35:26 约西亚其馀的事和他遵着耶和华律法上所记而行的善事，</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to
that which was written in the law of the LORD,</p>
<p>35:27 并他自始至终所行的，都写在以色列和犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book
of the kings of Israel and Judah.</p>
