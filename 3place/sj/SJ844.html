<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-42-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 42 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>42:1
他带我出来向北，到外院，又带我进入圣屋。这圣屋一排顺着空地，一排与北边铺石地之屋相对。</p>
<p>Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward the
north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the
separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</p>
<p>42:2 这圣屋长一百肘，宽五十肘，有向北的门。</p>
<p>Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and the
breadth was fifty cubits.</p>
<p>42:3
对着内院那二十肘宽之空地，又对着外院的铺石地，在第三层楼上有楼廊对着楼廊。</p>
<p>Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court, and
over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery
against gallery in three stories.</p>
<p>42:4 在圣屋前有一条夹道，宽十肘，长一百肘。房门都向北。</p>
<p>And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a
way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</p>
<p>42:5 圣屋因为楼廊占去些地方，所以上层比中下两层窄些。</p>
<p>Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were higher
than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the building.</p>
<p>42:6
圣屋有三层，却无柱子，不像外院的屋子有柱子。所以上层比中下两层更窄。</p>
<p>For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the pillars of
the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than the lowest
and the middlemost from the ground.</p>
<p>42:7 圣屋外，东边有墙，靠着外院，长五十肘。</p>
<p>And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the
utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was
fifty cubits.</p>
<p>42:8 靠着外院的圣屋长五十肘。殿北面的圣屋长一百肘。</p>
<p>For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was fifty
cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.</p>
<p>42:9 在圣屋以下，东头有进入之处，就是从外院进入之处。</p>
<p>And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as one
goeth into them from the utter court.</p>
<p>42:10
向南（原文作东）在内院墙里有圣屋，一排与铺石地之屋相对，一排顺着空地。</p>
<p>The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court toward
the east, over against the separate place, and over against the
building.</p>
<p>42:11
这圣屋前的夹道与北边圣屋的夹道长宽一样。出入之处与北屋门的样式相同。</p>
<p>And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which
were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and all
their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to
their doors.</p>
<p>42:12 正在墙前，夹道的东头，有门可以进入，与向南圣屋的门一样。</p>
<p>And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south
was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall
toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p>
<p>42:13
他对我说，顺着空地的南屋北屋，都是圣屋。亲近耶和华的祭司当在那里吃至圣的物，也当在那里放至圣的物，就是素祭，赎罪祭，和赎愆祭，因此处为圣。</p>
<p>Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers,
which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the
priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy things:
there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and
the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</p>
<p>42:14
祭司进去出了圣所的时候，不可直到外院，但要在圣屋放下他们供职的衣服，因为是圣衣。要穿上别的衣服才可以到属民的外院。</p>
<p>When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of the
holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments
wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other
garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the
people.</p>
<p>42:15 他量完了内殿，就带我出朝东的门，量院的四围。</p>
<p>Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought
me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and measured
it round about.</p>
<p>42:16 他用量度的竿量四围，量东面五百肘（原文作竿本章下同），</p>
<p>He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>
<p>42:17 用竿量北面五百肘，</p>
<p>He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
reed round about.</p>
<p>42:18 用竿量南面五百肘，</p>
<p>He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the measuring
reed.</p>
<p>42:19 又转到西面，用竿量五百肘。</p>
<p>He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds
with the measuring reed.</p>
<p>42:20
他量四面，四围有墙，长五百肘，宽五百肘，为要分别圣地与俗地。</p>
<p>He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five
hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between
the sanctuary and the profane place.</p>
