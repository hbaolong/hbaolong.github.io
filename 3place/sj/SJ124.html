<h4 id="旧约-民数记numbers-第-7-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
民数记(Numbers) – 第 7 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>7:1
摩西立完了帐幕，就把帐幕用膏抹了，使它成圣，又把其中的器具和坛，并坛上的器具，都抹了，使它成圣。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had
anointed them, and sanctified them;</p>
<p>7:2
当天，以色列的众首领，就是各族的族长，都来奉献。他们是各支派的首领，管理那些被数的人。</p>
<p>That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who
were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered,
offered:</p>
<p>7:3
他们把自己的供物送到耶和华面前，就是六辆篷子车和十二只公牛。每两个首领奉献一辆车，每首领奉献一只牛。他们把这些都奉到帐幕前。</p>
<p>And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons,
and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox:
and they brought them before the tabernacle.</p>
<p>7:4 耶和华晓谕摩西说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>7:5 你要收下这些，好作会幕的使用，都要照利未人所办的事交给他们。</p>
<p>Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle
of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every
man according to his service.</p>
<p>7:6 于是摩西收了车和牛，交给利未人，</p>
<p>And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
Levites.</p>
<p>7:7 把两辆车，四只牛，照革顺子孙所办的事交给他们，</p>
<p>Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according
to their service:</p>
<p>7:8
又把四辆车，八只牛，照米拉利子孙所办的事交给他们。他们都在祭司亚伦的儿子以他玛手下。</p>
<p>And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari,
according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron
the priest.</p>
<p>7:9
但车与牛都没有交给哥辖子孙。因为他们办的是圣所的事，在肩头上抬圣物。</p>
<p>But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the
sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their
shoulders.</p>
<p>7:10 用膏抹坛的日子，首领都来行奉献坛的礼，众首领就在坛前献供物。</p>
<p>And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that
it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the
altar.</p>
<p>7:11
耶和华对摩西说，众首领为行奉献坛的礼，要每天一个首领来献供物。</p>

prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.</p>
