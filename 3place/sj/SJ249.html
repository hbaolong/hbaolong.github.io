<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-13-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 13 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>13:1 扫罗登基年四十岁。作以色列王二年的时候，</p>
<p>Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
Israel,</p>
<p>13:2
就从以色列中拣选了三千人，二千跟随扫罗在密抹和伯特利山，一千跟随约拿单在便雅悯的基比亚。其馀的人扫罗都打发各回各家去了。</p>
<p>Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand
were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with
Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every
man to his tent.</p>
<p>13:3
约拿单攻击迦巴，非利士人的防营，非利士人听见了。扫罗就在遍地吹角，意思说，要使希伯来人听见。</p>
<p>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba,
and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout
all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</p>
<p>13:4
以色列众人听见扫罗攻击非利士人的防营，又听见以色列人为非利士人所憎恶，就跟随扫罗聚集在吉甲。</p>
<p>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of the
Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination with the
Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to
Gilgal.</p>
<p>13:5
非利士人聚集，要与以色列人争战，有车三万辆，马兵六千，步兵像海边的沙那样多，就上来在伯亚文东边的密抹安营。</p>
<p>And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people
as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up,
and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.</p>
<p>13:6
以色列百姓见自己危急窘迫，就藏在山洞，丛林，石穴，隐密处，和坑中。</p>
<p>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the
people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves,
and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.</p>
<p>13:7
有些希伯来人过了约旦河，逃到迦得和基列地。扫罗还是在吉甲，百姓都战战兢兢地跟随他。</p>
<p>And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and
Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed
him trembling.</p>
<p>13:8
扫罗照着撒母耳所定的日期等了七日。撒母耳还没有来到吉甲，百姓也离开扫罗散去了。</p>
<p>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had
appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered
from him.</p>
<p>13:9 扫罗说，把燔祭和平安祭带到我这里来。扫罗就献上燔祭。</p>
<p>And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.</p>
<p>13:10 刚献完燔祭，撒母耳就到了。扫罗出去迎接他，要问他好。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering
the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him,
that he might salute him.</p>
<p>13:11
撒母耳说，你作的是什么事呢。扫罗说，因为我见百姓离开我散去，你也不照所定的日期来到，而且非利士人聚集在密抹。</p>
<p>And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw
that the people were scattered from me, and that thou camest not within
the days appointed, and that the Philistines gathered themselves
together at Michmash;</p>
<p>13:12
所以我心里说，恐怕我没有祷告耶和华。非利士人下到吉甲攻击我，我就勉强献上燔祭。</p>
<p>Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to
Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself
therefore, and offered a burnt offering.</p>
<p>13:13
撒母耳对扫罗说，你作了糊涂事了，没有遵守耶和华你神所吩咐你的命令。若遵守，耶和华必在以色列中坚立你的王位，直到永远。</p>
<p>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept
the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now
would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever.</p>
<p>13:14
现在你的王位必不长久。耶和华已经寻着一个合他心意的人，立他作百姓的君，因为你没有遵守耶和华所吩咐你的。</p>
<p>But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a
man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him to be captain
over his people, because thou hast not kept that which the LORD
commanded thee.</p>
<p>13:15
撒母耳就起来，从吉甲上到便雅悯的基比亚。扫罗数点跟随他的，约有六百人。</p>
<p>And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin.
And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six
hundred men.</p>
<p>13:16
扫罗和他儿子约拿单，并跟随他们的人，都住在便雅悯的迦巴。但非利士人安营在密抹。</p>
<p>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were present with
them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in
Michmash.</p>
<p>13:17 有掠兵从非利士营中出来，分为三队，一队往俄弗拉向书亚地去，</p>
<p>And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three
companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth to Ophrah, unto
the land of Shual:</p>
<p>13:18 一队往伯和仑去，一队往洗波音谷对面的地境向旷野去。</p>
<p>And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another company
turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim
toward the wilderness.</p>
<p>13:19
那时，以色列全地没有一个铁匠。因为非利士人说，恐怕希伯来人制造刀枪。</p>
<p>Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for
the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:</p>
<p>13:20 以色列人要磨锄，犁，斧，铲，就下到非利士人那里去磨。</p>
<p>But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every
man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock.</p>
<p>13:21 但有锉可以锉铲，犁，三齿叉，斧子，并赶牛锥。</p>
<p>Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for
the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.</p>
<p>13:22
所以到了争战的日子，跟随扫罗和约拿单的人没有一个手里有刀有枪的，惟独扫罗和他儿子约拿单有。</p>
<p>So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword
nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and
Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.</p>
<p>13:23 非利士人的一队防兵到了密抹的隘口。</p>
<p>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
Michmash.</p>
