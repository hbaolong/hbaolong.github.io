<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-1-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 1 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>1:1
约书亚死后，以色列人求问耶和华说，我们中间谁当首先上去攻击迦南人，与他们争战。</p>
<p>Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of
Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the
Canaanites first, to fight against them?</p>
<p>1:2 耶和华说，犹大当先上去，我已将那地交在他手中。</p>
<p>And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the
land into his hand.</p>
<p>1:3
犹大对他哥哥西缅说，请你同我到拈阄所得之地去，好与迦南人争战。以后我也同你到你拈阄所得之地去。于是西缅与他同去。</p>
<p>And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,
that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with
thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>
<p>1:4
犹大就上去，耶和华将迦南人和比利洗人交在他们手中。他们在比色击杀了一万人。</p>
<p>And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the
Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand
men.</p>
<p>1:5 又在那里遇见亚多尼比色，与他争战，杀败迦南人和比利洗人。</p>
<p>And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and
they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</p>
<p>1:6 亚多尼比色逃跑。他们追赶，拿住他，砍断他手脚的大姆指。</p>
<p>But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</p>
<p>1:7
亚多尼比色说，从前有七十个王，手脚的大姆指都被我砍断，在我桌子底下拾取零碎食物。现在神按着我所行的报应我了。于是他们将亚多尼比色带到耶路撒冷，他就死在那里。</p>
<p>And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs
and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I
have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,
and there he died.</p>
<p>1:8
犹大人攻打耶路撒冷，将城攻取，用刀杀了城内的人，并且放火烧城。</p>
<p>Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken
it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on
fire.</p>
<p>1:9 后来犹大人下去，与住山地，南地，和高原的迦南人争战。</p>
<p>And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the
Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the
valley.</p>
<p>1:10
犹大人去攻击住希伯仑的迦南人，杀了示筛，亚希幔，挞买。希伯仑从前名叫基列亚巴。</p>
<p>And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the
name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>
<p>1:11 他们从那里去攻击底壁的居民。底壁从前名叫基列西弗。</p>
<p>And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the
name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:</p>
<p>1:12
迦勒说，谁能攻打基列西弗，将城夺取，我就把我女儿押撒给他为妻。</p>
<p>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him
will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p>
<p>1:13
迦勒兄弟基纳斯的儿子俄陀聂夺取了那城，迦勒就把女儿押撒给他为妻。</p>
<p>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it: and
he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p>
<p>1:14
押撒过门的时候，劝缮夫向她父亲求一块田。押撒一下驴，迦勒问她说，你要什么。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask
of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said
unto her, What wilt thou?</p>
<p>1:15
她说，求你赐福给我，你既将我安置在南地，求你也给我水泉。迦勒就把上泉下泉赐给她。</p>
<p>And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a
south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper
springs and the nether springs.</p>
<p>1:16
摩西的内兄（或作岳父）是基尼人，他的子孙与犹大人一同离了棕树城，往亚拉得以南的犹大旷野去，就住在民中。</p>
<p>And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of
the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of
Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among
the people.</p>
<p>1:17
犹大和他哥哥西缅同去，击杀了住洗法的迦南人，将城尽行毁灭，那城的名便叫何珥玛。</p>
<p>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites
that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the
city was called Hormah.</p>
<p>1:18
犹大又取了迦萨和迦萨的四境，亚实基伦和亚实基伦的四境，以革伦和以革伦的四境。</p>
<p>Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the
coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</p>
<p>1:19
耶和华与犹大同在，犹大就赶出山地的居民，只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车。</p>
<p>And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of the
mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because
they had chariots of iron.</p>
<p>1:20
以色列人照摩西所说的，将希伯仑给了迦勒。迦勒就从那里赶出亚衲族的三个族长。</p>
<p>And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled
thence the three sons of Anak.</p>
<p>1:21
便雅悯人没有赶出住耶路撒冷的耶布斯人。耶布斯人仍在耶路撒冷与便雅悯人同住，直到今日。</p>
<p>And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that
inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of
Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p>
<p>1:22 约瑟家也上去攻打伯特利。耶和华与他们同在。</p>
<p>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the
LORD was with them.</p>
<p>1:23 约瑟家打发人去窥探伯特利。那城起先名叫路斯。</p>
<p>And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the
city before was Luz.)</p>
<p>1:24
窥探的人看见一个人从城里出来，就对他说，求你将进城的路指示我们，我们必恩待你。</p>
<p>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said
unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will
shew thee mercy.</p>
<p>1:25
那人将进城的路指示他们，他们就用刀击杀了城中的居民，但将那人和他全家放去。</p>
<p>And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the
city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his
family.</p>
<p>1:26
那人往赫人之地去，筑了一座城，起名叫路斯。那城到如今还叫这名。</p>
<p>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and
called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this
day.</p>
<p>1:27
玛拿西没有赶出伯善和属伯善乡村的居民，他纳和属他纳乡村的居民，多珥和属多珥乡村的居民，以伯莲和属以伯莲乡村的居民，米吉多和属米吉多乡村的居民。迦南人却执意住在那些地方。</p>
<p>Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her
towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants
of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that
land.</p>
<p>1:28 及至以色列强盛了，就使迦南人作苦工，没有把他们全然赶出。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</p>
<p>1:29
以法莲没有赶出住基色的迦南人。于是迦南人仍住在基色，在以法莲中间。</p>
<p>Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but
the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>
<p>1:30
西布伦没有赶出基伦的居民和拿哈拉的居民。于是迦南人仍住在西布伦中间，成了服苦的人。</p>
<p>Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the
inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became
tributaries.</p>
<p>1:31
亚设没有赶出亚柯和西顿的居民，亚黑拉和亚革悉的居民，黑巴，亚弗革与利合的居民。</p>
<p>Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of
Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p>
<p>1:32 于是，亚设因为没有赶出那地的迦南人，就住在他们中间。</p>
<p>But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the
land: for they did not drive them out.</p>
<p>1:33
拿弗他利没有赶出伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民，于是拿弗他利就住在那地的迦南人中间。然而伯示麦和伯亚纳的居民成了服苦的人。</p>
<p>Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor
the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the
inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and
of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</p>
<p>1:34 亚摩利人强逼但人住在山地，不容他们下到平原。</p>
<p>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for
they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</p>
<p>1:35
亚摩利人却执意住在希烈山和亚雅伦并沙宾。然而约瑟家胜了他们，使他们成了服苦的人。</p>
<p>But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they
became tributaries.</p>
<p>1:36 亚摩利人的境界，是从亚克拉浜坡，从西拉而上。</p>
<p>And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from
the rock, and upward.</p>
