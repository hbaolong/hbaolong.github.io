<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-13-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 13 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>13:1
那时，有一个神人奉耶和华的命从犹大来到伯特利。耶罗波安正站在坛旁要烧香。</p>
<p>And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the
LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.</p>
<p>13:2
神人奉耶和华的命向坛呼叫，说，坛哪，坛哪。耶和华如此说，大卫家里必生一个儿子，名叫约西亚，他必将邱坛的祭司，就是在你上面烧香的，杀在你上面，人的骨头也必烧在你上面。</p>
<p>And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O
altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto
the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the
priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones
shall be burnt upon thee.</p>
<p>13:3
当日，神人设个预兆，说，这坛必破裂，坛上的灰必倾撒，这是耶和华说的预兆。</p>
<p>And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the
LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that
are upon it shall be poured out.</p>
<p>13:4
耶罗波安王听见神人向伯特利的坛所呼叫的话，就从坛上伸手，说，拿住他吧。王向神人所伸的手就枯乾了，不能弯回。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man
of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth
his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he
put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again
to him.</p>
<p>13:5 坛也破裂了，坛上的灰倾撒了，正如神人奉耶和华的命所设的预兆。</p>
<p>The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the
LORD.</p>
<p>13:6
王对神人说，请你为我祷告，求耶和华你神的恩典使我的手复原。于是神人祈祷耶和华，王的手就复了原，仍如寻常一样。</p>
<p>And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the
face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored
me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s hand was
restored him again, and became as it was before.</p>
<p>13:7 王对神人说，请你同我回去吃饭，加添心力，我也必给你赏赐。</p>
<p>And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh
thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p>
<p>13:8
神人对王说，你就是把你的宫一半给我，我也不同你进去，也不在这地方吃饭喝水。</p>
<p>And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor
drink water in this place:</p>
<p>13:9
因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我，说不可在伯特利吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。</p>
<p>For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no
bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou
camest.</p>
<p>13:10 于是神人从别的路回去，不从伯特利来的原路回去。</p>
<p>So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to
Bethel.</p>
<p>13:11
有一个老先知住在伯特利，他儿子们来，将神人当日在伯特利所行的一切事和向王所说的话都告诉了父亲。</p>
<p>Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told
him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the
words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their
father.</p>
<p>13:12
父亲问他们说，神人从哪条路去了呢。儿子们就告诉他。原来他们看见那从犹大来的神人所去的路。</p>
<p>And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had
seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</p>
<p>13:13
老先知就吩咐他儿子们说，你们为我备驴。他们备好了驴，他就骑上，</p>
<p>And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the
ass: and he rode thereon,</p>
<p>13:14
去追赶神人，遇见他坐在橡树底下，就问他说，你是从犹大来的神人不是。他说，是。</p>
<p>And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak:
and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
And he said, I am.</p>
<p>13:15 老先知对他说，请你同我回家吃饭。</p>
<p>Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</p>
<p>13:16 神人说，我不可同你回去进你的家，也不可在这里同你吃饭喝水。</p>
<p>And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither
will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:</p>
<p>13:17
因为有耶和华的话嘱咐我说，你在那里不可吃饭喝水，也不可从你去的原路回来。</p>
<p>For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no
bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou
camest.</p>
<p>13:18
老先知对他说，我也是先知，和你一样。有天使奉耶和华的命对我说，你去把他带回你的家，叫他吃饭喝水。这都是老先知诓哄他。</p>
<p>He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake
unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into
thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied unto
him.</p>
<p>13:19 于是神人同老先知回去，在他家里吃饭喝水。</p>
<p>So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank
water.</p>
<p>13:20 二人坐席的时候，耶和华的话临到那带神人回来的先知，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the
LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:</p>
<p>13:21
他就对那从犹大来的神人说，耶和华如此说，你既违背耶和华的话，不遵守耶和华你神的命令，</p>
<p>And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD,
and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded
thee,</p>
<p>13:22
反倒回来，在耶和华禁止你吃饭喝水的地方吃了喝了，因此你的尸身不得入你列祖的坟墓。</p>
<p>But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place,
of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;
thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>
<p>13:23 吃喝完了，老先知为所带回来的先知备驴。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he
had brought back.</p>
<p>13:24
他就去了，在路上有个狮子遇见他，将他咬死，尸身倒在路上，驴站在尸身旁边，狮子也站在尸身旁边。</p>
<p>And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and
his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also
stood by the carcase.</p>
<p>13:25
有人从那里经过，看见尸身倒在路上，狮子站在尸身旁边，就来到老先知所住的城里述说这事。</p>
<p>And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and
the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city
where the old prophet dwelt.</p>
<p>13:26
那带神人回来的先知听见这事，就说，这是那违背了耶和华命令的神人，所以耶和华把他交给狮子。狮子抓伤他，咬死他，是应验耶和华对他说的话。</p>
<p>And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,
which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake unto him.</p>
<p>13:27 老先知就吩咐他儿子们说，你们为我备驴。他们就备了驴。</p>
<p>And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled
him.</p>
<p>13:28
他去了，看见神人的尸身倒在路上，驴和狮子站在尸身旁边，狮子却没有吃尸身，也没有抓伤驴。</p>
<p>And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and
the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase,
nor torn the ass.</p>
<p>13:29
老先知就把神人的尸身驮在驴上，带回自己的城里，要哀哭他，葬埋他。</p>
<p>And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it
upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city,
to mourn and to bury him.</p>
<p>13:30 就把他的尸身葬在自己的坟墓里，哀哭他，说，哀哉。我兄阿。</p>
<p>And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him,
saying, Alas, my brother!</p>
<p>13:31
安葬之后，老先知对他儿子们说，我死了，你们要葬我在神人的坟墓里，使我的尸骨靠近他的尸骨，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his
sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the
man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</p>
<p>13:32
因为他奉耶和华的命，指着伯特利的坛，和撒马利亚各城有邱坛之殿所说的话必定应验。</p>
<p>For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the
altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which are
in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</p>
<p>13:33
这事以后，耶罗波安仍不离开他的恶道，将凡民立为邱坛的祭司。凡愿意的，他都分别为圣，立为邱坛的祭司。</p>
<p>After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made
again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever
would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high
places.</p>
<p>13:34 这事叫耶罗波安的家陷在罪里，甚至他的家从地上除灭了。</p>
<p>And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it
off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</p>
