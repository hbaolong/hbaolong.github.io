<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-12-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 12 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 那时，希律王手下苦害教会中几个人。</p>
<p>Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex
certain of the church.</p>
<p>12:2 用刀杀了约翰的哥哥雅各。</p>
<p>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</p>
<p>12:3 他见犹太人喜欢这事，又去捉拿彼得。那时正是除酵的日子。</p>
<p>And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take
Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)</p>
<p>12:4
希律拿了彼得收在监里，交付四班兵丁看守，每班四个人，意思要在逾越节后，把他提出来，当着百姓办他</p>
<p>And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered
him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter
to bring him forth to the people.</p>
<p>12:5 于是彼得被囚在监里。教会却为他切切的祷告神。</p>
<p>Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>
<p>12:6
希律将要提他出来的前一夜，彼得被两条铁链锁着，睡在两个兵丁当中。看守的人也在门外看守。</p>
<p>And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was
sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers
before the door kept the prison.</p>
<p>12:7
忽然有主的一个使者，站在旁边，屋里有光照耀。天使拍彼得的肋旁，拍醒了他，说，快快起来。那铁链就从他手上脱落下来。</p>
<p>And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined
in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up,
saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</p>
<p>12:8
天使对他说，束上带子。穿上鞋。他就那样作。天使又说，披上外衣跟着我来。</p>
<p>And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.
And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and
follow me.</p>
<p>12:9 彼得就出来跟着他，不知道天使所作是真的，只当见了异象。</p>
<p>And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true
which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p>
<p>12:10
过了第一层，第二层监牢，就来到临街的铁门。那门自己开了。他们出来，走过一条街，天使便离开他去了。</p>
<p>When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the
iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own
accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and
forthwith the angel departed from him.</p>
<p>12:11
彼得醒悟过来，说，我现在真知道主差遣他的使者，救我脱离希律的手，和犹太百姓一切所盼望的。</p>
<p>And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety,
that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand
of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</p>
<p>12:12
想了一想，就往那称呼马可的约翰他母亲马利亚家去。在那里有好些人聚集祷告。</p>
<p>And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary
the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered
together praying.</p>
<p>12:13 彼得敲外门，有一个使女，名叫罗大出来探听。</p>
<p>And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to
hearken, named Rhoda.</p>
<p>12:14
听见是彼得的声音，就欢喜的顾不得开门，跑进去告诉众人说，彼得站在门外。</p>
<p>And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for
gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</p>
<p>12:15
他们说，你是疯了。使女极力的说，真是他。他们说，必是他的天使。</p>
<p>And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed
that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</p>
<p>12:16 彼得不住的敲门。他们开了门，看见他，就甚惊奇。</p>
<p>But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and
saw him, they were astonished.</p>
<p>12:17
彼得摆手，不要他们作声，就告诉他们主怎样领他出监。又说，你们把这事告诉雅各，和众弟兄。于是出去往别处去了。</p>
<p>But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,
declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And
he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he
departed, and went into another place.</p>
<p>12:18 到了天亮，兵丁扰乱得很，不知道彼得往那里去了。</p>
<p>Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the
soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p>
<p>12:19
希律找他，找不着，就审问看守的人，吩咐把他们拉去杀了。后来希律离开犹太，下凯撒利亚去，住在那里。</p>
<p>And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the
keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went
down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</p>
<p>12:20
希律恼怒推罗西顿的人。他们那一块地方，是从王的地土得粮，因此就托了王的内侍臣伯拉斯都的情，一心来求和。</p>
<p>And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they
came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s
chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was
nourished by the king’s country.</p>
<p>12:21 希律在所定的日子，穿上朝服，坐在位上，对他们讲论一番。</p>
<p>And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his
throne, and made an oration unto them.</p>
<p>12:22 百姓喊着说，这是神的声音，不是人的声音。</p>
<p>And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and
not of a man.</p>
<p>12:23
希律不归荣耀给神，所以主的使者立刻罚他。他被虫所咬，气就绝了。</p>
<p>And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not
God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>12:24 神的道日见兴旺，越发广传。</p>
<p>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</p>
<p>12:25
巴拿巴和扫罗，办完了他们供给的事，就从耶路撒冷回来，带着称呼马可的约翰同去。</p>
<p>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had
fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was
Mark.</p>
