<h4 id="新约-马可福音mark-第-6-章-本篇共有-16-章">新约 – 马可福音(Mark)
– 第 6 章 ( 本篇共有 16 章 )</h4>
<p>6:1 耶稣离开那里，来到自己的家乡。门徒也跟从他。</p>
<p>And he went out from thence, and came into his own country; and his
disciples follow him.</p>
<p>6:2
他到了安息日，他在会堂里教训人。众人听见，就甚希奇，说，这人从那里有这些事呢，所赐给他的是什么智慧，他手所作的是何等的异能呢。</p>
<p>And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the
synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From whence
hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto
him, that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands?</p>
<p>6:3
这不是那木匠吗。不是马利亚的儿子，雅各，约西，犹大，西门的长兄吗。他的妹妹们不也是在我们这里吗。他们就厌弃他。（厌弃他原文作因他跌倒）</p>
<p>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and
Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And
they were offended at him.</p>
<p>6:4
耶稣对他们说，大凡先知，除了本地亲属本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。</p>
<p>But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, but in his
own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</p>
<p>6:5
耶稣就在那里不得行什么异能，不过按手在几个病人身上，治好他们。</p>
<p>And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands
upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</p>
<p>6:6 他也诧异他们不信，就往周围乡村教训人去了。</p>
<p>And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round about
the villages, teaching.</p>
<p>6:7
耶稣叫了十二个门徒来，差遣他们两个两个的出去。也赐给他们权柄，制伏污鬼。</p>
<p>And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them forth by
two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;</p>
<p>6:8
并且嘱咐他们，行路的时候，不要带食物和口袋，腰袋里也不要带钱，除了拐杖以外，什么都不要带。</p>
<p>And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey,
save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in their purse:</p>
<p>6:9 只要穿鞋。也不要穿两件挂子。</p>
<p>But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</p>
<p>6:10
又对他们说，你们无论到何处，进了人的家，就住在那里，直到离开那地方。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an house,
there abide till ye depart from that place.</p>
<p>6:11
何处的人，不接待你们，不听你们，你们离开那里的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去，对他们作见证。</p>
<p>And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart
thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them.
Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha
in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p>6:12 门徒就出去，传道叫人悔改。</p>
<p>And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</p>
<p>6:13 又赶出许多的鬼，用油抹了许多病人，治好他们。</p>
<p>And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were
sick, and healed them.</p>
<p>6:14
耶稣的名声传扬出来。希律王听见了，就说，施洗的约翰从死里复活了，所以这些异能由他里面发出来。</p>
<p>And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:) and he
said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead, and therefore
mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</p>
<p>6:15 但别人说，是以利亚。又有人说，是先知，正像先知中的一位。</p>
<p>Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a prophet,
or as one of the prophets.</p>
<p>6:16 希律听见，却说，是我所斩的约翰，他复活了。</p>
<p>But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I beheaded:
he is risen from the dead.</p>
<p>6:17
先是希律为他兄弟腓力的妻子希罗底的缘故，差人去拿住约翰，锁在监里，因为希律已经娶了那妇人。</p>
<p>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and bound
him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife: for he had
married her.</p>
<p>6:18 约翰曾对希律说，你娶你兄弟的妻子是不合理的。</p>
<p>For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy
brother’s wife.</p>
<p>6:19 于是希罗底怀恨他，想要杀他。只是不能。</p>
<p>Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have killed
him; but she could not:</p>
<p>6:20
因为希律知道约翰是义人，是圣人，所以敬畏他，保护他。听他讲论，就多照着行。并且乐意听他。（多照着行有古卷作游移不定）</p>
<p>For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an holy,
and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard
him gladly.</p>
<p>6:21
有一天，恰巧是希律的生日，希律摆设筵席，请了大臣和千夫长，并加利利作首领的。</p>
<p>And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a
supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates of Galilee;</p>
<p>6:22
希罗底的女儿进来跳舞，使希律和同席的人都欢喜。王就对女子说，你随意向我求什么，我必给你。</p>
<p>And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and danced, and
pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel,
Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it thee.</p>
<p>6:23 又对他起誓说，随你向我求什么，就是我国的一半，我也必给你。</p>
<p>And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give
it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</p>
<p>6:24
他就出去，对他母亲说，我可以求什么呢。他母亲说，施洗约翰的头。</p>
<p>And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And
she said, The head of John the Baptist.</p>
<p>6:25
他就急忙进去见王，求他说，我愿王立时把施洗约翰的头，放在盘子里给我。</p>
<p>And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and asked,
saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John
the Baptist.</p>
<p>6:26 王就甚忧愁。但因他所起的誓，又因同席的人，就不肯推辞。</p>
<p>And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath’s sake, and for
their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</p>
<p>6:27
随既差一个护卫兵，吩咐拿约翰的头来。护卫兵就去在监里斩了约翰，</p>
<p>And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded his head
to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</p>
<p>6:28 把头放在盘子里，拿来给女子，女子就给他母亲。</p>
<p>And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel: and the
damsel gave it to her mother.</p>
<p>6:29 约翰的门徒听见了，就来把他的尸首领去，葬在坟墓里。</p>
<p>And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse,
and laid it in a tomb.</p>
<p>6:30 使徒聚集到耶稣那里，将一切所作的事，所传的道，全告诉他。</p>
<p>And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told
him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</p>
<p>6:31
他就说，你们来同我暗暗的到旷野地方去歇一歇。这是因为来往的人多，他们连吃饭也没有工夫。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place,
and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no
leisure so much as to eat.</p>
<p>6:32 他们就坐船，暗暗的往旷野地方去。</p>
<p>And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</p>
<p>6:33
众人看见他们去，有许多认识他们的，就从各城步行，一同跑到那里，比他们先赶到了。</p>
<p>And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran afoot
thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came together unto
him.</p>
<p>6:34
耶稣出来，见有许多的人，就怜悯他们。因为他们如同羊没有牧人一般。于是开口教训他们许多道理。</p>
<p>And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved with
compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not having a
shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p>
<p>6:35 天已经晚了，门徒进前来说，这是野地，天已经晚了，</p>
<p>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him, and
said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed:</p>
<p>6:36 请叫众人散开，他们好往四面乡村里去，自己买什么吃的。</p>
<p>Send them away, that they may go into the country round about, and
into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have nothing to
eat.</p>
<p>6:37
耶稣回答说，你们给他们吃吧。门徒说，我们可以去买二十两银子的饼，给他们吃吗。</p>
<p>He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they say
unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread, and give
them to eat?</p>
<p>6:38
耶稣说，你们有多少饼，可以去看看。他们知道了，就说，五个饼，两条鱼。</p>
<p>He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when
they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</p>
<p>6:39 耶稣吩咐他们叫众人一帮一帮的，坐在青草地上。</p>
<p>And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the
green grass.</p>
<p>6:40 众人就一排一排的坐下，有一百一排的，有五十一排的。</p>
<p>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p>
<p>6:41
耶稣拿着这五个饼，两条鱼，望天祝福，擘开饼，递给门徒摆在众人面前。也把那两条鱼分给众人。</p>
<p>And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked
up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave them to his
disciples to set before them; and the two fishes divided he among them
all.</p>
<p>6:42 他们都吃，并且吃饱了。</p>
<p>And they did all eat, and were filled.</p>
<p>6:43 门徒就把碎饼碎鱼，收拾起来，装满了十二个篮子。</p>
<p>And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of the
fishes.</p>
<p>6:44 吃饼的男子，共有五千。</p>
<p>And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men.</p>
<p>6:45 耶稣随既催门徒上船，先渡到那边伯赛大去，等他叫众人散开。</p>
<p>And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship,
and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while he sent away
the people.</p>
<p>6:46 他既辞别了他们，就往山上去祷告。</p>
<p>And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to
pray.</p>
<p>6:47 到了晚上，船在海中，耶稣独自在岸上。</p>
<p>And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he
alone on the land.</p>
<p>6:48
看见门徒，因风不顺，摇橹甚苦。夜里约有四更天，就在海面上走往他们那里去，意思要走过他们去。</p>
<p>And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary unto
them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them,
walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.</p>
<p>6:49 但门徒看见他在海面上走，以为是鬼怪，就喊叫起来。</p>
<p>But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been
a spirit, and cried out:</p>
<p>6:50
因为他们都看见了他，且甚惊慌。耶稣连忙对他们说，你们放心。是我，不要怕。</p>
<p>For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked
with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is I; be not
afraid.</p>
<p>6:51 于是到他们那里上了船，风就住了。他们心里十分惊奇。</p>
<p>And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased: and they
were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and wondered.</p>
<p>6:52 这是因为他们不明白那分饼的事，心里还是愚顽。</p>
<p>For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their heart
was hardened.</p>
<p>6:53 既渡过去，来到革尼撒勒地方，就靠了岸。</p>
<p>And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret,
and drew to the shore.</p>
<p>6:54 一下船，众人认得是耶稣。</p>
<p>And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew
him,</p>
<p>6:55
就跑遍那一带地方，听见他在何处，便将有病的人，用褥子抬到那里。</p>
<p>And ran through that whole region round about, and began to carry
about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.</p>
<p>6:56
凡耶稣所到的地方，或村中，或城里，或乡间，他们都将病人放在街市上，求耶稣只容他们摸他的衣裳？？子。凡摸着的人，就都好了。</p>
<p>And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country,
they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might
touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched
him were made whole.</p>
