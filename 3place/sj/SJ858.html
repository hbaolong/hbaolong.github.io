<h4 id="旧约-但以理书daniel-第-8-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
但以理书(Daniel) – 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
伯沙撒王在位第三年，有异象现与我但以理，是在先前所见的异象之后。</p>
<p>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared
unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the
first.</p>
<p>8:2
我见了异象的时候，我以为在以拦省书珊城（或作宫）中。我见异象又如在乌莱河边。</p>
<p>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at
Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a
vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>
<p>8:3
我举目观看，见有双角的公绵羊站在河边，两角都高。这角高过那角，更高的是后长的。</p>
<p>Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before
the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but
one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p>8:4
我见那公绵羊往西，往北，往南抵触。兽在它面前都站立不住，也没有能救护脱离它手的。但它任意而行，自高自大。</p>
<p>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that
no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could
deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became
great.</p>
<p>8:5
我正思想的时候，见有一只公山羊从西而来，遍行全地，脚不沾尘。这山羊两眼当中有一非常的角。</p>
<p>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on
the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat
had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p>8:6
它往我所看见，站在河边有双角的公绵羊那里去，大发忿怒，向它直闯。</p>
<p>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing
before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.</p>
<p>8:7
我见公山羊就近公绵羊，向它发烈怒，抵触它，折断它的两角。绵羊在它面前删立不住。它将绵羊触倒在地，用脚践踏，没有能救绵羊脱离它手的。</p>
<p>And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler
against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was
no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the
ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the
ram out of his hand.</p>
<p>8:8
这山羊极其自高自大，正强盛的时候，那大角折断了，又在角根上向天的四方（方原文作风）长出四个非常的角来。</p>
<p>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the
great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the
four winds of heaven.</p>
<p>8:9
四角之中有一角长出一个小角，向南，向东，向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。</p>
<p>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
pleasant land.</p>
<p>8:10 它渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。</p>
<p>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some
of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them.</p>
<p>8:11
并且它自高自大，以为高及天象之君。除掉常献给君的燔祭，毁坏君的圣所。</p>
<p>Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him
the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was
cast down.</p>
<p>8:12
因罪过的缘故，有军旅和常献的燔祭交付它。它将真理抛在地上，任意而行，无不顺利。</p>
<p>And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of
transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practised, and prospered.</p>
<p>8:13
我听见有一位圣者说话，又有一位圣者问那说话的圣者说，这除掉常献的燔祭和施行毁坏的罪过，将圣所与军旅（或作以色列的军）践踏的异象，要到几时才应验呢。</p>
<p>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that
certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the
daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the
sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
<p>8:14 他对我说，到二千三百日，圣所就必洁净。</p>
<p>And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then
shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p>8:15
我但以理见了这异象，愿意明白其中的意思。忽有一位形状像人的站在我面前。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and
sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
appearance of a man.</p>
<p>8:16
我又听见乌莱河两岸中有人声呼叫说，加百列阿，要使此人明白这异象。</p>
<p>And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called,
and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p>8:17
他便来到我所站的地方。他一来，我就惊慌俯伏在地。他对我说，人子阿，你要明白，因为这是关乎末后的异象。</p>
<p>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and
fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at
the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
<p>8:18 他与我说话的时候，我面伏在地沉睡。他就摸我，扶我站起来，</p>
<p>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p>8:19 说，我要指示你恼怒临完必有的事，因为这是关乎末后的定期。</p>
<p>And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last
end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</p>
<p>8:20 你所看见双角的公绵羊，就是玛代和波斯王。</p>
<p>The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and
Persia.</p>
<p>8:21
那公山羊就是希腊王（希腊原文作雅完下同）。两眼当中的大角就是头一王。</p>
<p>And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is
between his eyes is the first king.</p>
<p>8:22
至于那折断了的角，在其根上又长出四角，这四角就是四国，必从这国里兴起来，只是权势都不及他。</p>
<p>Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms
shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
<p>8:23
这四国末时，犯法的人罪恶满盈，必有一王兴起，面貌凶恶，能用双关的诈语。</p>
<p>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are
come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark
sentences, shall stand up.</p>
<p>8:24
他的权柄必大，却不是因自己的能力。他必行非常的毁灭，事情顺利，任意而行。又必毁灭有能力的和圣民。</p>
<p>And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall
destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy
the mighty and the holy people.</p>
<p>8:25
他用权术成就手中的诡计，心里自高自大，在人坦然无备的时候，毁灭多人。又要站起来攻击万君之君，至终却非因人手而灭亡。</p>
<p>And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his
hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall
destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but
he shall be broken without hand.</p>
<p>8:26
所说二千三百日的异象是真的，但你要将这异象封住，因为关乎后来许多的日子。</p>
<p>And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true:
wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.</p>
<p>8:27
于是我但以理昏迷不醒，病了数日，然后起来办理王的事务。我因这异象惊奇，却无人能明白其中的意思。</p>
<p>And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up,
and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but
none understood it.</p>
