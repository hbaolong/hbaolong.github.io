<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-22-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 22 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>22:1 亚兰国和以色列国三年没有争战。</p>
<p>And they continued three years without war between Syria and
Israel.</p>
<p>22:2 到第三年，犹大王约沙法下去见以色列王。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of
Judah came down to the king of Israel.</p>
<p>22:3
以色列王对臣仆说，你们不知道基列的拉末是属我们的吗。我们岂可静坐不动，不从亚兰王手里夺回来吗。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in
Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the
king of Syria?</p>
<p>22:4
亚哈问约沙法说，你肯同我去攻取基列的拉末吗。约沙法对以色列王说，你我不分彼此，我的民与你的民一样，我的马与你的马一样。</p>
<p>And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to
Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou
art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</p>
<p>22:5 约沙法对以色列王说，请你先求问耶和华。</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee,
at the word of the LORD to day.</p>
<p>22:6
于是以色列王招聚先知，约有四百人，问他们说，我上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以。他们说，可以上去，因为主必将那城交在王的手里。</p>
<p>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to
battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall
deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>
<p>22:7 约沙法说，这里不是还有耶和华的先知，我们可以求问他吗。</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
besides, that we might enquire of him?</p>
<p>22:8
以色列王对约沙法说，还有一个人，是音拉的儿子米该雅，我们可以托他求问耶和华。只是我恨他。因为他指着我所说的预言，不说吉语，单说凶言。约沙法说，王不必这样说。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man,
Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate
him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And
Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>
<p>22:9
以色列王就召了一个太监来，说，你快去，将音拉的儿子米该雅召来。</p>
<p>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten hither
Micaiah the son of Imlah.</p>
<p>22:10
以色列王和犹大王约沙法在撒马利亚城门前的空场上，各穿朝服，坐在位上，所有的先知都在他们面前说预言。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on
his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance
of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</p>
<p>22:11
基拿拿的儿子西底家造了两个铁角，说，耶和华如此说，你要用这角抵触亚兰人，直到将他们灭尽。</p>
<p>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he
said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until
thou have consumed them.</p>
<p>22:12
所有的先知也都这样预言说，可以上基列的拉末去，必然得胜，因为耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。</p>
<p>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead,
and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the king’s hand.</p>
<p>22:13
那去召米该雅的使者对米该雅说。众先知一口同音地都向王说吉言，你不如与他们说一样的话，也说吉言。</p>
<p>And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,
saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king
with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of
them, and speak that which is good.</p>
<p>22:14
米该雅说，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，耶和华对我说什么，我就说什么。</p>
<p>And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me,
that will I speak.</p>
<p>22:15
米该雅到王面前，王问他说，米该雅阿，我们上去攻取基列的拉末可以不可以。他回答说，可以上去，必然得胜，耶和华必将那城交在王的手中。</p>
<p>So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we
go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered
him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the
king.</p>
<p>22:16 王对他说，我当嘱咐你几次，你才奉耶和华的名向我说实话呢。</p>
<p>And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that
thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the LORD?</p>
<p>22:17
米该雅说，我看见以色列众民散在山上，如同没有牧人的羊群一般。耶和华说，这民没有主人，他们可以平平安安地各归各家去。</p>
<p>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that
have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them
return every man to his house in peace.</p>
<p>22:18
以色列王对约沙法说，我岂没有告诉你，这人指着我所说的预言，不说吉语单说凶言吗。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee
that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</p>
<p>22:19
米该雅说，你要听耶和华的话。我看见耶和华坐在宝座上，天上的万军侍立在他左右。</p>
<p>And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD
sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his
right hand and on his left.</p>
<p>22:20
耶和华说，谁去引诱亚哈上基列的拉末去阵亡呢。这个就这样说，那个就那样说。</p>
<p>And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and
fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on
that manner.</p>
<p>22:21 随后有一个神灵出来，站在耶和华面前，说，我去引诱他。</p>
<p>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I
will persuade him.</p>
<p>22:22
耶和华问他说，你用何法呢。他说，我去，要在他众先知口中作谎言的灵。耶和华说，这样，你必能引诱他，你去如此行吧。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth,
and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he
said, Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also: go forth, and do
so.</p>
<p>22:23
现在耶和华使谎言的灵入了你这些先知的口，并且耶和华已经命定降祸与你。</p>
<p>Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth
of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning
thee.</p>
<p>22:24
基拿拿的儿子西底家前来，打米该雅的脸，说，耶和华的灵从哪里离开我与你说话呢。</p>
<p>But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the
cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak
unto thee?</p>
<p>22:25 米该雅说，你进严密的屋子藏躲的那日，就必看见了。</p>
<p>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt
go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>
<p>22:26 以色列王说，将米该雅带回，交给邑宰亚们和王的儿子约阿施，说</p>
<p>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto
Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son;</p>
<p>22:27
王如此说，把这个人下在监里，使他受苦，吃不饱喝不足，等候我平平安安地回来。</p>
<p>And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed
him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come
in peace.</p>
<p>22:28
米该雅说，你若能平平安安地回来，那就是耶和华没有藉我说这话了。又说，众民哪，你们都要听。</p>
<p>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not
spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.</p>
<p>22:29 以色列王和犹大王约沙法上基列的拉末去了。</p>
<p>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramothgilead.</p>
<p>22:30
以色列王对约沙法说，我要改装上阵，你可以仍穿王服。以色列王就改装上阵。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of
Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</p>
<p>22:31
先是亚兰王吩咐他的三十二个车兵长说，他们的兵将，无论大小，你们都不可与他们争战，只要与以色列王争战。</p>
<p>But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had
rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save
only with the king of Israel.</p>
<p>22:32
车兵长看见约沙法，便说，这必是以色列王。就转过去与他争战，约沙法便呼喊。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And they
turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.</p>
<p>22:33 车兵长见不是以色列王，就转去不追他了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that
it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing
him.</p>
<p>22:34
有一人随便开弓，恰巧射入以色列王的甲缝里。王对赶车的说，我受了重伤，你转过车来，拉我出阵吧。</p>
<p>And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of
Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the
driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;
for I am wounded.</p>
<p>22:35
那日，阵势越战越猛，有人扶王站在车上，抵挡亚兰人。到晚上，王就死了，血从伤处流在车中。</p>
<p>And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his
chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of
the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>
<p>22:36 约在日落的时候，有号令传遍军中，说，各归本城，各归本地吧。</p>
<p>And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going
down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own
country.</p>
<p>22:37 王既死了，众人将他送到撒马利亚，就葬在那里。</p>
<p>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the
king in Samaria.</p>
<p>22:38
又有人把他的车洗在撒马利亚的池旁（妓女在那里洗澡），狗来舔他的血，正如耶和华所说的话。</p>
<p>And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs
licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word
of the LORD which he spake.</p>
<p>22:39
亚哈其馀的事，凡他所行的和他所修造的象牙宫，并所建筑的一切城邑，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory
house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>22:40 亚哈与他列祖同睡。他儿子亚哈谢接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>22:41 以色列王亚哈第四年，亚撒的儿子约沙法登基作了犹大王。</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the
fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</p>
<p>22:42
约沙法登基的时候年三十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王二十五年。他母亲名叫阿苏巴，乃示利希的女儿。</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and
he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>
<p>22:43
约沙法行他父亲亚撒所行的道，不偏离左右，行耶和华眼中看为正的事。只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。</p>
<p>And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:
nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered
and burnt incense yet in the high places.</p>
<p>22:44 约沙法与以色列王和好。</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</p>
<p>22:45
约沙法其馀的事和他所显出的勇力，并他怎样争战，都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>22:46 约沙法将他父亲亚撒在世所剩下的娈童都从国中除去了。</p>
<p>And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his
father Asa, he took out of the land.</p>
<p>22:47 那时以东没有王，有总督治理。</p>
<p>There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</p>
<p>22:48
约沙法制造他施船只，要往俄斐去，将金子运来。只是没有去，因为船在以旬迦别破坏了。</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they
went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</p>
<p>22:49
亚哈的儿子亚哈谢对约沙法说，容我的仆人和你的仆人坐船同去吧。约沙法却不肯。</p>
<p>Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants
go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</p>
<p>22:50
约沙法与列祖同睡。葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约兰接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in
his stead.</p>
<p>22:51
犹大王约沙法十七年，亚哈的儿子亚哈谢在撒马利亚登基，作以色列王共二年。</p>
<p>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years
over Israel.</p>
<p>22:52
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他的父母，又行尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的事。</p>
<p>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</p>
<p>22:53
他照他父亲一切所行的，事奉敬拜巴力，惹耶和华以色列神的怒气。</p>
<p>For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the
LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>
