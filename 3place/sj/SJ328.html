<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-15-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 15 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 以色列王耶罗波安二十七年，犹大王亚玛谢的儿子亚撒利雅登基，</p>
<p>In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began
Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.</p>
<p>15:2
他登基的时候年十六岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十二年。他母亲名叫耶可利雅，是耶路撒冷人。</p>
<p>Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two
and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jecholiah of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>15:3 亚撒利雅行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亲亚玛谢一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
to all that his father Amaziah had done;</p>
<p>15:4 只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。</p>
<p>Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
burnt incense still on the high places.</p>
<p>15:5
耶和华降灾与王，使他长大麻疯，直到死日，他就住在别的宫里。他的儿子约坦管理家事，治理国民。</p>
<p>And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of
his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king’s son was
over the house, judging the people of the land.</p>
<p>15:6 亚撒利雅其馀的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>15:7
亚撒利雅与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约坦接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>15:8
犹大王亚撒利雅三十八年，耶罗波安的儿子撒迦利雅在撒马利亚作以色列王六个月。</p>
<p>In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah
the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months.</p>
<p>15:9
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他列祖所行的，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>15:10 雅比的儿子沙龙背叛他，在百姓面前击杀他，篡了他的位。</p>
<p>And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him
before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:11 撒迦利雅其馀的事都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>15:12
这是从前耶和华应许耶户说，你的子孙必坐以色列的国位直到四代。这话果然应验了。</p>
<p>This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy
sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation. And
so it came to pass.</p>
<p>15:13
犹大王乌西雅（就是亚撒利雅）三十九年，雅比的儿子沙龙登基在撒马利亚作王一个月。</p>
<p>Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth
year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in
Samaria.</p>
<p>15:14
迦底的儿子米拿现从得撒上撒马利亚，杀了雅比的儿子沙龙，篡了他的位。</p>
<p>For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria,
and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and
reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:15 沙龙其馀的事和他背叛的情形都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he
made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.</p>
<p>15:16
那时米拿现从得撒起攻打提斐萨和其四境，击杀城中一切的人，剖开其中所有的孕妇，都因他们没有给他开城。</p>
<p>Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts
thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote
it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.</p>
<p>15:17
犹大王亚撒利雅三十九年，迦底的儿子米拿现登基，在撒马利亚作以色列王十年。</p>
<p>In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem
the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in
Samaria.</p>
<p>15:18
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，终身不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to sin.</p>
<p>15:19
亚述王普勒来攻击以色列国，米拿现给他一千他连得银子，请普勒帮助他坚定国位。</p>
<p>And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave
Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to
confirm the kingdom in his hand.</p>
<p>15:20
米拿现向以色列一切大富户索要银子，使他们各出五十舍客勒，就给了亚述王。于是亚述王回去，不在国中停留。</p>
<p>And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men
of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of
Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the
land.</p>
<p>15:21 米拿现其馀的事，凡他所行的都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>15:22 米拿现与他列祖同睡。他儿子比加辖接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in
his stead.</p>
<p>15:23
犹大王亚撒利雅五十年，米拿现的儿子比加辖在撒马利亚登基作以色列王二年。</p>
<p>In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of
Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two
years.</p>
<p>15:24
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to
sin.</p>
<p>15:25
比加辖的将军，利玛利的儿子比加背叛他，在撒马利亚王宫里的卫所杀了他。亚珥歌伯和亚利耶并基列的五十人帮助比加。比加击杀他，篡了他的位。</p>
<p>But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against
him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, with
Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed
him, and reigned in his room.</p>
<p>15:26 比加辖其馀的事，凡他所行的都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold,
they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel.</p>
<p>15:27
犹大王亚撒利雅五十二年，利玛利的儿子比加在撒马利亚登基作以色列王二十年。</p>
<p>In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son
of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty
years.</p>
<p>15:28
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，不离开尼八的儿子耶罗波安使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed
not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to
sin.</p>
<p>15:29
以色列王比加年间，亚述王提革拉毗列色来夺了以云，亚伯伯玛迦，亚挪，基低斯，夏琐，基列，加利利，和拿弗他利全地，将这些地方的居民都掳到亚述去了。</p>
<p>In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and
Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried
them captive to Assyria.</p>
<p>15:30
乌西雅的儿子约坦二十年，以拉的儿子何细亚背叛利玛利的儿子比加，击杀他，篡了他的位。</p>
<p>And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of
Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the
twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.</p>
<p>15:31 比加其馀的事，凡他所行的都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they
are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>15:32
以色列王利玛利的儿子比加第二年，犹大王乌西雅的儿子约坦登基。</p>
<p>In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began
Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.</p>
<p>15:33
他登基的时候年二十五岁，在耶路撒冷作王十六年。他母亲名叫耶路沙，是撒督的女儿。</p>
<p>Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok.</p>
<p>15:34 约坦行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亲乌西雅一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did
according to all that his father Uzziah had done.</p>
<p>15:35
只是邱坛还没有废去，百姓仍在那里献祭烧香。约坦建立耶和华殿的上门。</p>
<p>Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and
burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the
house of the LORD.</p>
<p>15:36 约坦其馀的事，凡他所行的都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>15:37
在那些日子，耶和华才使亚兰王利汛和利玛利的儿子比加去攻击犹大。</p>
<p>In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of
Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.</p>
<p>15:38
约坦与他列祖同睡，葬在他祖大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子亚哈斯接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.</p>
