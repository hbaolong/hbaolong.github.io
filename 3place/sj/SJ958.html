<h4 id="新约-马可福音mark-第-1-章-本篇共有-16-章">新约 – 马可福音(Mark)
– 第 1 章 ( 本篇共有 16 章 )</h4>
<p>1:1 神的儿子，耶稣基督福音的起头，</p>
<p>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>
<p>1:2
正如先知以赛亚书上记着说，（有古卷无以赛亚三字）看哪，我要差遣我的使者在你面前，豫备道路。</p>
<p>As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before
thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p>1:3 在旷野有人声喊着说，豫备主的道，修直他的路。</p>
<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p>1:4 照这话，约翰来了，在旷野施洗，传悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。</p>
<p>John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>1:5
犹太全地，和耶路撒冷的人，都出去到约翰那里，承认他们的罪，在约旦河里受他的洗。</p>
<p>And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of
Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan,
confessing their sins.</p>
<p>1:6 约翰穿骆驼毛的衣服，腰束皮带，吃的是蝗虫野蜜。</p>
<p>And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin
about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
<p>1:7
他传道说，有一位在我以后来的，能力比我更大，我就是弯腰给他解鞋带，也是不配的。</p>
<p>And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the
latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
<p>1:8 我是用水给你们施洗，他却要用圣灵给你们施洗。</p>
<p>I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with
the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>1:9 那时，耶稣从加利利的拿撒勒来，在约旦河里受了约翰的洗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>
<p>1:10 他从水里一上来，就看见天裂开了，圣灵彷佛鸽子，降在他身上。</p>
<p>And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens
opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>
<p>1:11 又有声音从天上来说，你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。</p>
<p>And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son,
in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p>1:12 圣灵就把耶稣催到旷野里去。</p>
<p>And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>
<p>1:13
他在旷野四十天受撒但的试探。并与野兽同在一处。且有天使来伺候他。</p>
<p>And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and
was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p>1:14 约翰下监以后，耶稣来到加利利，宣传神的福音，</p>
<p>Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p>1:15 说，日期满了，神的国近了。你们当悔改，信福音。</p>
<p>And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand:
repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
<p>1:16
耶稣顺着加利利的海边走，看见西门，和西门的兄弟安得烈，在海边撒网。他们本是打鱼的。</p>
<p>Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his
brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p>1:17 耶稣对他们说，来跟从我，我要叫你们得人如得鱼一样。</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to
become fishers of men.</p>
<p>1:18 他们就立刻舍了网，跟从了他。</p>
<p>And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p>1:19
耶稣稍往前走，又见西庇太的儿子雅各，和雅各的兄弟约翰，在船上补网。</p>
<p>And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the son of
Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their
nets.</p>
<p>1:20
耶稣随既招呼他们。他们就把父亲西庇太，和雇工人留在船上，跟从耶稣去了。</p>
<p>And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in
the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p>1:21 到了迦百农，耶稣就在安息日进了会堂教训人。</p>
<p>And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he
entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
<p>1:22
众人很希奇他的教训。因为他教训他们，正像有权柄的人，不像文士。</p>
<p>And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one
that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p>1:23 在会堂里有一个人，被污鬼附着。他喊叫说，</p>
<p>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he
cried out,</p>
<p>1:24
拿撒勒人耶稣，我们与你有什么相干，你来灭我们吗。我知道你是谁，乃是神的圣者。</p>
<p>Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the
Holy One of God.</p>
<p>1:25 耶稣责备他说，不要作声，从这人身上出来吧。</p>
<p>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of
him.</p>
<p>1:26 污鬼叫那人抽了一阵疯，大声喊叫，就出来了。</p>
<p>And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud
voice, he came out of him.</p>
<p>1:27
众人都惊讶，以致彼此对问说，这是什么事，是个新道理阿。他用权柄吩咐污鬼，连污鬼也听从了他。</p>
<p>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among
themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for
with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey
him.</p>
<p>1:28 耶稣的名声，就传遍了加利利的四方。</p>
<p>And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region
round about Galilee.</p>
<p>1:29 他们一出会堂，就同着雅各约翰，进了西门和安得烈的家。</p>
<p>And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered
into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p>1:30 西门的岳母，正害热病躺着。就有人告诉耶稣。</p>
<p>But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him
of her.</p>
<p>1:31 耶稣进前拉着他的手，扶他起来，热就退了，他就服事他们。</p>
<p>And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and
immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p>1:32
天晚日落的时候，有人带着一切害病的，和被鬼附的，来到耶稣跟前。</p>
<p>And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that
were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>
<p>1:33 合城的人都聚集在门前。</p>
<p>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p>1:34
耶稣治好了许多害各样病的人，又赶出许多鬼，不许鬼说话，因为鬼认识他。</p>
<p>And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out
many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew
him.</p>
<p>1:35 次日早晨，天未亮的时候，耶稣起来，到旷野地方去，在那里祷告。</p>
<p>And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out,
and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
<p>1:36 西门和同伴追了他去。</p>
<p>And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
<p>1:37 遇见了就对他说，众人都找你。</p>
<p>And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for
thee.</p>
<p>1:38
耶稣对他们说，我们可以往别处去，到邻近的乡村，我也好在那里传道。因为我是为这事出来的。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may
preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
<p>1:39 于是在加利利全地，进了会堂，传道赶鬼。</p>
<p>And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast
out devils.</p>
<p>1:40
有一个长大麻疯的，来求耶稣，向他跪下说，你若肯，必能叫我洁净了。</p>
<p>And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to
him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p>1:41 耶稣动了慈心，就伸手摸他，说，我肯，你洁净了吧。</p>
<p>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched
him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
<p>1:42 大麻疯既时离开他，他就洁净了。</p>
<p>And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from
him, and he was cleansed.</p>
<p>1:43 耶稣严严的嘱咐他，就打发他走，</p>
<p>And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
<p>1:44
对他说，你要谨慎，什么话都不可告诉人。只要去把身体给祭司察看，又因为你洁净了，献上摩西所吩咐的礼物，对众人作证据。</p>
<p>And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way,
shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things
which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p>1:45
那人出去，倒说许多的话，把这件事传扬开了，叫耶稣以后不得再明明的进城，只好在外边旷野地方。人从各处都就了他来。</p>
<p>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad
the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the
city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every
quarter.</p>
