<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第43-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第43 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>43:1 那地的饥荒甚大。</p>
<p>And the famine was sore in the land.</p>
<p>43:2
他们从埃及带来的粮食吃尽了，他们的父亲就对他们说，你们再去给我籴些粮来。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had
brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a
little food.</p>
<p>43:3
犹大对他说，那人谆谆地告诫我们说，你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。</p>
<p>And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto
us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with
you.</p>
<p>43:4 你若打发我们的兄弟与我们同去，我们就下去给你籴粮。</p>
<p>If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee
food:</p>
<p>43:5
你若不打发他去，我们就不下去，因为那人对我们说，你们的兄弟若不与你们同来，你们就不得见我的面。</p>
<p>But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said
unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</p>
<p>43:6 以色列说，你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有兄弟呢，</p>
<p>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the
man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>
<p>43:7
他们回答说，那人详细问到我们和我们的亲属，说，你们的父亲还在吗。你们还有兄弟吗。我们就按着他所问的告诉他，焉能知道他要说，必须把你们的兄弟带下来呢。</p>
<p>And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our
kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and
we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly
know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</p>
<p>43:8
犹大又对他父亲以色列说，你打发童子与我同去，我们就起身下去，好叫我们和你，并我们的妇人孩子，都得存活，不至于死。</p>
<p>And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we
will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and
also our little ones.</p>
<p>43:9
我为他作保。你可以从我手中追讨，我若不带他回来交在你面前，我情愿永远担罪。</p>
<p>I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I
bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the
blame for ever:</p>
<p>43:10 我们若没有耽搁，如今第二次都回来了。</p>
<p>For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second
time.</p>
<p>43:11
他们的父亲以色列说，若必须如此，你们就当这样行，可以将这地土产中最好的乳香，蜂蜜，香料，没药，榧子，杏仁都取一点，收在器具里，带下去送给那人作礼物，</p>
<p>And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now, do
this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry
down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and
myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>
<p>43:12
又要手里加倍地带银子，并将归还在你们口袋内的银子仍带在手里。那或者是错了。</p>
<p>And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought
again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand;
peradventure it was an oversight:</p>
<p>43:13 也带着你们的兄弟，起身去见那人。</p>
<p>Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>
<p>43:14
但愿全能的神使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯，释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。我若丧了儿子，就丧了吧。</p>
<p>And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away
your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am
bereaved.</p>
<p>43:15
于是，他们拿着那礼物，又手里加倍地带银子，并且带着便雅悯，起身下到埃及，站在约瑟面前。</p>
<p>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their
hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood
before Joseph.</p>
<p>43:16
约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来，就对家宰说，将这些人领到屋里。要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为晌午这些人同我吃饭。</p>
<p>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his
house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men
shall dine with me at noon.</p>
<p>43:17 家宰就遵着约瑟的命去行，领他们进约瑟的屋里。</p>
<p>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into
Joseph’s house.</p>
<p>43:18
他们因为被领到约瑟的屋里，就害怕，说，领我们到这里来，必是因为头次归还在我们口袋里的银子，找我们的错缝，下手害我们，强取我们为奴仆，抢夺我们的驴。</p>
<p>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s
house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our
sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion
against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our
asses.</p>
<p>43:19 他们就挨进约瑟的家宰，在屋门口和他说话，</p>
<p>And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they
communed with him at the door of the house,</p>
<p>43:20 说，我主阿，我们头次下来实在是要籴粮。</p>
<p>And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
food:</p>
<p>43:21
后来到了住宿的地方，我们打开口袋，不料，各人的银子，分量足数，仍在各人的口袋内，现在我们手里又带回来了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our
sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our
money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</p>
<p>43:22 另外又带下银子来籴粮。不知道先前谁把银子放在我们的口袋里。</p>
<p>And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we
cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>
<p>43:23
家宰说，你们可以放心，不要害怕，是你们的神和你们父亲的神赐给你们财宝在你们的口袋里。你们的银子，我早已收了。他就把西缅带出来，交给他们。</p>
<p>And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your
father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he
brought Simeon out unto them.</p>
<p>43:24 家宰就领他们进约瑟的屋里，给他们水洗脚，又给他们草料喂驴。</p>
<p>And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water,
and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</p>
<p>43:25
他们就预备那礼物，等候约瑟晌午来，因为他们听见要在那里吃饭。</p>
<p>And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they
heard that they should eat bread there.</p>
<p>43:26
约瑟来到家里，他们就把手中的礼物拿进屋去给他，又俯伏在地，向他下拜。</p>
<p>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in
their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</p>
<p>43:27
约瑟问他们好，又问，你们的父亲就是你们所说的那老人家平安吗。他还在吗。</p>
<p>And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well,
the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</p>
<p>43:28
他们回答说，你仆人我们的父亲平安。他还在。于是他们低头下拜。</p>
<p>And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is
yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</p>
<p>43:29
约瑟举目看见他同母的兄弟便雅悯，就说，你们向我所说那顶小的兄弟就是这位吗。又说，小儿阿，愿神赐恩给你。</p>
<p>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s
son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me?
And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.</p>
<p>43:30
约瑟爱弟之情发动，就急忙寻梢可哭之地，进入自己的屋里，哭了一场。</p>
<p>And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and
he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept
there.</p>
<p>43:31 他洗了脸出来，勉强隐忍，吩咐人摆饭。</p>
<p>And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and
said, Set on bread.</p>
<p>43:32
他们就为约瑟单摆了一席，为那些人又摆了一席，也为和约瑟同吃饭的埃及人另摆了一席，因为埃及人不可和希伯来人一同吃饭。那原是埃及人所厌恶的。</p>
<p>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and
for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the
Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an
abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>
<p>43:33
约瑟使众弟兄在他面前排列坐席，都按着长幼的次序，众弟兄就彼此诧异。</p>
<p>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,
and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at
another.</p>
<p>43:34
约瑟把他面前的食物分出来，送给他们。但便雅悯所得的比别人多五倍。他们就饮酒，和约瑟一同宴乐。</p>
<p>And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin’s
mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were
merry with him.</p>
