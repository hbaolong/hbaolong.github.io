<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-20-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 20 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>20:1
亚兰王便哈达聚集他的全军，率领三十二个王，带着车马上来围攻撒马利亚。</p>
<p>And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and
there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and
he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.</p>
<p>20:2 又差遣使者进城见以色列王亚哈，对他说，便哈达如此说，</p>
<p>And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said
unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</p>
<p>20:3 你的金银都要归我，你妻子儿女中最美的也要归我。</p>
<p>Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children,
even the goodliest, are mine.</p>
<p>20:4
以色列王回答说，我主我王阿，可以依着你的话，我与我所有的都归你。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according
to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>
<p>20:5
使者又来说，便哈达如此说，我已差遣人去见你，要你将你的金银，妻子，儿女都给我。</p>
<p>And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,
saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me
thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children;</p>
<p>20:6
但明日约在这时候，我还要差遣臣仆到你那里，搜查你的家和你仆人的家，将你眼中一切所喜爱的都拿了去。</p>
<p>Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and
they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it
shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it
in their hand, and take it away.</p>
<p>20:7
以色列王召了国中的长老来，对他们说，请你们看看，这人是怎样地谋害我，他先差遣人到我这里来，要我的妻子，儿女，和金银，我并没有推辞他。</p>
<p>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said,
Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for he sent
unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my
gold; and I denied him not.</p>
<p>20:8 长老和百姓对王说，不要听从他，也不要应允他。</p>
<p>And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto
him, nor consent.</p>
<p>20:9
故此，以色列王对便哈达的使者说，你们告诉我主我王说，王头一次差遣人向仆人所要的，仆人都依从。但这次所要的，我不能依从。使者就去回覆便哈达。</p>
<p>Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the
king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will
do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and
brought him word again.</p>
<p>20:10
便哈达又差遣人去见亚哈说，撒马利亚的尘土若够跟从我的人每人捧一捧的，愿神明重重地降罚与我。</p>
<p>And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and
more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the
people that follow me.</p>
<p>20:11
以色列王说，你告诉他说，才顶盔贯甲的，休要像摘盔卸甲的夸口。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that
girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.</p>
<p>20:12
便哈达和诸王正在帐幕里喝酒，听见这话，就对他臣仆说，摆队吧。他们就摆队攻城。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was
drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his
servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array
against the city.</p>
<p>20:13
有一个先知来见以色列王亚哈，说，耶和华如此说，这一大群人你看见了吗。今日我必将他们交在你手里，你就知道我是耶和华。</p>
<p>And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I
will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I am
the LORD.</p>
<p>20:14
亚哈说，藉着谁呢。他回答说，耶和华说，藉着跟从省长的少年人。亚哈说，要谁率领呢。他说，要你亲自率领。</p>
<p>And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even by the
young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order
the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p>
<p>20:15
于是亚哈数点跟从省长的少年人，共有二百三十二名，后又数点以色列的众兵，共有七千名。</p>
<p>Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and
they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the
people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.</p>
<p>20:16
午间，他们就出城。便哈达和帮助他的三十二个王正在帐幕里痛饮。</p>
<p>And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in
the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped
him.</p>
<p>20:17
跟从省长的少年人先出城。便哈达差遣人去探望，他们回报说，有人从撒马利亚出来了。</p>
<p>And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and
Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of
Samaria.</p>
<p>20:18
他说，他们若为讲和出来，要活捉他们。若为打仗出来，也要活捉他们。</p>
<p>And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or
whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p>
<p>20:19 跟从省长的少年人出城，军兵跟随他们。</p>
<p>So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the
city, and the army which followed them.</p>
<p>20:20
各人遇见敌人就杀。亚兰人逃跑，以色列人追赶他们。亚兰王便哈达骑着马和马兵一同逃跑。</p>
<p>And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel
pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with
the horsemen.</p>
<p>20:21 以色列王出城攻打车马，大大击杀亚兰人。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots,
and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>
<p>20:22
那先知来见以色列王，对他说，你当自强，留心怎样防备。因为到明年这时候，亚兰王必上来攻击你。</p>
<p>And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return
of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.</p>
<p>20:23
亚兰王的臣仆对亚兰王说，以色列人的神是山神，所以他们胜过我们。但在平原与他们打仗，我们必定得胜。</p>
<p>And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are
gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us
fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than
they.</p>
<p>20:24 王当这样行，把诸王革去，派军长代替他们，</p>
<p>And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place,
and put captains in their rooms:</p>
<p>20:25
又照着王丧失军兵之数，再招募一军，马补马，车补车，我们在平原与他们打仗，必定得胜。王便听臣仆的话去行。</p>
<p>And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for
horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the
plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto
their voice, and did so.</p>
<p>20:26 次年，便哈达果然点齐亚兰人上亚弗去，要与以色列人打仗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered
the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.</p>
<p>20:27
以色列人也点齐军兵，预备食物，迎着亚兰人出去，对着他们安营，好像两小群山羊羔。亚兰人却满了地面。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and
went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like
two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.</p>
<p>20:28
有神人来见以色列王，说，耶和华如此说，亚兰人既说我耶和华是山神，不是平原的神，所以我必将这一大群人都交在你手中，你们就知道我是耶和华。</p>
<p>And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and
said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD is
God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore will I
deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that
I am the LORD.</p>
<p>20:29
以色列人与亚兰人相对安营七日，到第七日两军交战。那一日以色列人杀了亚兰人步兵十万，</p>
<p>And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it
was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of
Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.</p>
<p>20:30
其馀的逃入亚弗城。城墙塌倒，压死剩下的二万七千人。便哈达也逃入城，藏在严密的屋子里。</p>
<p>But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fell upon
twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad fled,
and came into the city, into an inner chamber.</p>
<p>20:31
他的臣仆对他说，我们听说以色列王都是仁慈的王，现在我们不如腰束麻布，头套绳索，出去投降以色列王，或者他存留王的性命。</p>
<p>And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the
kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee,
put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the
king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.</p>
<p>20:32
于是他们腰束麻布，头套绳索，去见以色列王，说，王的仆人便哈达说，求王存留我的性命。亚哈说，他还活着吗。他是我的兄弟。</p>
<p>So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their
heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad
saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my
brother.</p>
<p>20:33
这些人留心探出他的口气来，便急忙就着他的话说，便哈达是王的兄弟。王说，你们去请他来。便哈达出来见王，王就请他上车。</p>
<p>Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from
him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then
he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he
caused him to come up into the chariot.</p>
<p>20:34
便哈达对王说，我父从你父那里所夺的城邑，我必归还。你可以在大马士革立街市，像我父在撒马利亚所立的一样。亚哈说，我照此立约，放你回去，就与他立约，放他去了。</p>
<p>And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from
thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in
Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send thee
away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him
away.</p>
<p>20:35
有先知的一个门徒奉耶和华的命对他的同伴说，你打我吧。那人不肯打他。</p>
<p>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour
in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to
smite him.</p>
<p>20:36
他就对那人说，你既不听从耶和华的话，你一离开我，必有狮子咬死你。那人一离开他，果然遇见狮子，把他咬死了。</p>
<p>Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the
LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay
thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and
slew him.</p>
<p>20:37
先知的门徒又遇见一个人，对他说，你打我吧。那人就打他，将他打伤。</p>
<p>Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the
man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p>
<p>20:38 他就去了，用头巾蒙眼，改换面目，在路旁等候王。</p>
<p>So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p>
<p>20:39
王从那里经过，他向王呼叫说，仆人在阵上的时候，有人带了一个人来，对我说，你看守这人，若把他失了，你的性命必代替他的性命。不然，你必交出一他连得银子来。</p>
<p>And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy
servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned
aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any
means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou
shalt pay a talent of silver.</p>
<p>20:40
仆人正在忙乱之间，那人就不见了。以色列王对他说，你自己定妥了，必照样判断你。</p>
<p>And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king
of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided
it.</p>
<p>20:41 他急忙除掉蒙眼的头巾，以色列王就认出他是一个先知。</p>
<p>And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of
Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p>
<p>20:42
他对王说，耶和华如此说，因你将我定要灭绝的人放去，你的命就必代替他的命，你的民也必代替他的民。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go
out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore
thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people.</p>
<p>20:43 于是以色列王闷闷不乐地回到撒马利亚，进了他的宫。</p>
<p>And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and
came to Samaria.</p>
