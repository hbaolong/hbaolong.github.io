<h4 id="新约-马太福音matthew-第-13-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 –
马太福音(Matthew) – 第 13 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>13:1 当那一天，耶稣从房子里出来，坐在海边。</p>
<p>The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
side.</p>
<p>13:2 有许多人到他那里聚集，他只得上船坐下。众人都站在岸上。</p>
<p>And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he went
into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</p>
<p>13:3 他用比喻对他们讲许多道里，说，有一个撒种的出去撒种。</p>
<p>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a
sower went forth to sow;</p>
<p>13:4 撒种的时候，有落在路旁的，飞鸟来吃尽了。</p>
<p>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls
came and devoured them up:</p>
<p>13:5 有落在土浅石头地上的。土既不深，发苗最快。</p>
<p>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and
forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
<p>13:6 日头出来一晒，因为没有根，就枯乾了。</p>
<p>And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no
root, they withered away.</p>
<p>13:7 有落在荆棘里的。荆棘长起来，把他济住了。</p>
<p>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked
them:</p>
<p>13:8
又有落在好土里的，就结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。</p>
<p>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an
hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>
<p>13:9 有耳可听的，就应当听。</p>
<p>Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>13:10 门徒进前来，问耶稣说，对众人讲话，为什么用比喻呢。</p>
<p>And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto
them in parables?</p>
<p>13:11 耶稣回答说，因为天国的奥秘，只叫你们知道，不叫他们知道。</p>
<p>He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.</p>
<p>13:12
凡有的，还要加给他，叫他有馀。凡没有的，连他所有的，也要夺去。</p>
<p>For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more
abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even
that he hath.</p>
<p>13:13
所以我用比喻对他们讲，是因他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。</p>
<p>Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not;
and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p>13:14
在他们身上，正应了以赛亚的预言说，你们听是要听见，却不明白。看是要看见，却不晓得。</p>
<p>And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By
hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall
see, and shall not perceive:</p>
<p>13:15
因为这百姓油蒙了心，耳朵发沉，眼睛闭着。恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，我就医治他们。</p>
<p>For this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of
hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should
see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with
their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p>13:16
但你们的眼睛是有福的，因为看见了。你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为听见了。</p>
<p>But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they
hear.</p>
<p>13:17
我实在告诉你们，从前有许多先知和义人，要看你们所看的，却没有看见。要听你们所听见的，却没有听见。</p>
<p>For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have
desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to
hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>
<p>13:18 所以你们当听这撒种的比喻。</p>
<p>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
<p>13:19
凡听见天国道里不明白的，那恶者就来，把所撒在他心里的夺去了。这就是撒在路旁的了。</p>
<p>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it
not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown
in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
<p>13:20 撒在石头地上的，就是人听了道，当下欢喜领受。</p>
<p>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that
heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>
<p>13:21
只因心里没有根，不过是暂时的。及至为道遭了患难，或是受了逼迫，立刻就倒了。</p>
<p>Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when
tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
offended.</p>
<p>13:22
撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了道，后来有世上的思虑，钱财的迷惑，把道挤住了，不能结实。</p>
<p>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the
word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke
the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p>13:23
撒在好土地上的，就是人听了道明白了，后来结实，有一百倍的，有六十倍的，有三十倍的。</p>
<p>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the
word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth
forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>
<p>13:24 耶稣又设个比喻对他们说，天国好像人撒好种在田里。</p>
<p>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:</p>
<p>13:25 及至人睡觉的时候，有仇敌来，将稗子撒在麦子里，就走了。</p>
<p>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,
and went his way.</p>
<p>13:26 到长苗吐穗的时候，稗子也显出来。</p>
<p>But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then
appeared the tares also.</p>
<p>13:27
田主的仆人来告诉他说，主阿，你不是撒好种在田里吗。从那里来的稗子呢。</p>
<p>So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst
not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?</p>
<p>13:28 主人说，这是仇敌作的。仆人说，你要我们去薅出来吗。</p>
<p>He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto
him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
<p>13:29 主人说，不必，恐怕薅稗子，连麦子也拔出来。</p>
<p>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also
the wheat with them.</p>
<p>13:30
这两样一齐长，等着收割。当收割的时候，我要对收割的人说，先将稗子薅出来，捆成捆，留着烧。惟有麦子，要收在仓里。</p>
<p>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest
I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind
them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p>13:31
他又设个比喻对他们说，天国好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里。</p>
<p>Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven
is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his
field:</p>
<p>13:32
这原是百种里最小的。等到长起来，却比各样的菜都大，且成了树。天上的飞鸟来宿在他的枝上。</p>
<p>Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is
the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the
air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
<p>13:33
他又对他们讲个比喻说，天国好像面酵，有妇人拿来，藏在三斗面里，直等全团都发起来。</p>
<p>Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like
unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till
the whole was leavened.</p>
<p>13:34
这都是耶稣用比喻对众人说的话。若不用比喻，就不对他们说什么。</p>
<p>All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and
without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>
<p>13:35
这是要应验先知的话说，我要开口用比喻，把创世以来所隐藏的事发明出来。</p>
<p>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I
will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept
secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>13:36
当下耶稣离开众人，进了房子。他的门徒进前来说，请把田间稗子的比喻，讲给我们听。</p>
<p>Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his
disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the
tares of the field.</p>
<p>13:37 他回答说，那撒好种的，就是人子。</p>
<p>He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the
Son of man;</p>
<p>13:38 田地，就是世界。好种，就是天国之子。稗子，就是那恶者之子。</p>
<p>The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>
<p>13:39
撒稗子的仇敌，就是魔鬼。收割的时候，就是世界的末了。收割的人，就是天使。</p>
<p>The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the
world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>
<p>13:40 将稗子薅出来，用火焚烧。世界的末了，也要如此。</p>
<p>As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall
it be in the end of this world.</p>
<p>13:41
人子要差遣使者，把一切叫人跌倒的，和作恶的，从他国里挑出来，</p>
<p>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out
of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;</p>
<p>13:42 丢在火炉里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。</p>
<p>And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>13:43
那时义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。有耳可听的，就应当听。</p>
<p>Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>13:44
天国好像宝贝藏在地里。人遇见了，就把他藏起来。欢欢喜喜的去变卖一切所有的买这块地。</p>
<p>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field;
the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
<p>13:45 天国又好像买卖人，寻梢好珠子。</p>
<p>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking
goodly pearls:</p>
<p>13:46 遇见一颗重价的珠子，就去变卖他一切所有的，买了这颗珠子。</p>
<p>Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all
that he had, and bought it.</p>
<p>13:47 天国又好像网撒在海里，聚拢各样水族。</p>
<p>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into
the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>
<p>13:48
网既满了，人就拉上岸来。坐下，拣好的收在器具里，将不好的丢弃了。</p>
<p>Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>
<p>13:49
世界的末了，也要这样。天使要出来，从义人中，把恶人分别出来，</p>
<p>So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth,
and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>
<p>13:50 丢在火炉里。在那里必要哀哭切齿了。</p>
<p>And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing
and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>13:51 耶稣说，这一切的话，你们都明白了吗。他们说，我们明白了，</p>
<p>Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say
unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>
<p>13:52
他说，凡文士受教作天国的门徒，就像一个家主，从他库里拿出新旧的东西来。</p>
<p>Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed
unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder,
which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.</p>
<p>13:53 耶稣说完了这些比喻，就离开那里，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he
departed thence.</p>
<p>13:54
来到自己的家乡，在会堂里教训人，甚至他们都希奇说，这人从那里有这等智慧，和异能呢。</p>
<p>And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their
synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath
this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</p>
<p>13:55
这不是木匠的儿子吗。他母亲不是叫马利亚吗。他弟兄们不是叫雅各，约西，（有古卷作约瑟），西门，犹大吗。</p>
<p>Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and
his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>
<p>13:56 他妹妹们不是都在我们这里吗。这人从那里有这一切的事呢。</p>
<p>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man
all these things?</p>
<p>13:57
他们就厌弃他。（厌弃他原文作因他跌倒）耶稣对他们说，大凡先知，除了本地本家之外，没有不被人尊敬的。</p>
<p>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is
not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house.</p>
<p>13:58 耶稣因为他们不信，就在那里不多行异能了。</p>
<p>And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</p>
