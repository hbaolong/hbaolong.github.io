<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-31-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 31 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>31:1
这事既都完毕，在那里的以色列众人就到犹大的城邑，打碎柱像，砍断木偶，又在犹大，便雅悯，以法莲，玛拿西遍地将邱坛和祭坛拆毁净尽。于是以色列众人各回各城，各归各地。</p>
<p>Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out
to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the
groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah
and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly
destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
to his possession, into their own cities.</p>
<p>31:2
希西家派定祭司利未人的班次，各按各职献燔祭和平安祭，又在耶和华殿（原文作营）门内事奉，称谢颂赞耶和华。</p>
<p>And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites
after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and
Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to
give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.</p>
<p>31:3
王又从自己的产业中定出分来为燔祭，就是早晚的燔祭和安息日，月朔，并节期的燔祭，都是按耶和华律法上所载的。</p>
<p>He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the burnt
offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the
burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set
feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>31:4
又吩咐住耶路撒冷的百姓将祭司，利未人所应得的分给他们，使他们专心遵守耶和华的律法。</p>
<p>Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the
portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in
the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>31:5
谕旨一出，以色列人就把初熟的五谷，新酒，油，蜜，和田地的出产多多送来，又把各物的十分之一送来的极多。</p>
<p>And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel
brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey,
and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things
brought they in abundantly.</p>
<p>31:6
住犹大各城的以色列人和犹大人也将牛羊的十分之一，并分别为圣归耶和华他们神之物，就是十分取一之物，尽都送来，积成堆垒。</p>
<p>And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the
cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and
the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God,
and laid them by heaps.</p>
<p>31:7 从三月积起，到七月才完。</p>
<p>In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and
finished them in the seventh month.</p>
<p>31:8
希西家和众首领来，看见堆垒，就称颂耶和华，又为耶和华的民以色列人祝福。</p>
<p>And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</p>
<p>31:9 希西家向祭司，利未人查问这堆垒。</p>
<p>Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning
the heaps.</p>
<p>31:10
撒督家的大祭司亚撒利雅回答说，自从民将供物送到耶和华殿以来，我们不但吃饱，且剩下的甚多。因为耶和华赐福给他的民，所剩下的才这样丰盛。</p>
<p>And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and
said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of
the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD
hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great store.</p>
<p>31:11 希西家吩咐在耶和华殿里预备仓房，他们就预备了。</p>
<p>Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD;
and they prepared them,</p>
<p>31:12
他们诚心将供物和十分取一之物，并分别为圣之物，都搬入仓内。利未人歌楠雅掌管这事，他兄弟示每为副管。</p>
<p>And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things
faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei his
brother was the next.</p>
<p>31:13
耶歇，亚撒细雅，拿哈，亚撒黑，耶利末，约撒拔，以列，伊斯玛基雅，玛哈，比拿雅都是督理，在歌楠雅和他兄弟示每的手下，是希西家王和管理神殿的亚撒利雅所派的。</p>
<p>And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and
Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were
overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the
commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of
God.</p>
<p>31:14
守东门的利未人音拿的儿子可利，掌管乐意献与神的礼物，发放献与耶和华的供物和至圣的物。</p>
<p>And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, was
over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the
LORD, and the most holy things.</p>
<p>31:15
在他手下有伊甸，泯雅泯，耶书亚，示玛雅，亚玛利雅，示迦尼雅，在祭司的各城里供紧要的职任，无论弟兄大小，都按着班次分给他们。</p>
<p>And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set
office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to
the small:</p>
<p>31:16
按家谱，三岁以外的男丁，凡每日进耶和华殿，按班次供职的，也分给他。</p>
<p>Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward,
even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily
portion for their service in their charges according to their
courses;</p>
<p>31:17 又按宗族家谱分给祭司，按班次职任分给二十岁以外的利未人，</p>
<p>Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers,
and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by
their courses;</p>
<p>31:18
又按家谱计算，分给他们会中的妻子，儿女。因他们身供要职，自洁成圣。</p>
<p>And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their
sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their
set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:</p>
<p>31:19
按名派定的人要把应得的分给亚伦子孙，住在各城郊野，祭司所有的男丁和一切载入家谱的利未人。</p>
<p>Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields of
the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests,
and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p>
<p>31:20
希西家在犹大遍地这样办理，行耶和华他神眼中看为善为正为忠的事。</p>
<p>And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which
was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</p>
<p>31:21
凡他所行的，无论是办神殿的事，是遵律法守诫命，是寻求他的神，都是尽心去行，无不亨通。</p>
<p>And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God,
and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it with
all his heart, and prospered.</p>
