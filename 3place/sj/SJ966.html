<h4 id="新约-马可福音mark-第-9-章-本篇共有-16-章">新约 – 马可福音(Mark)
– 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 16 章 )</h4>
<p>9:1
耶稣又对他们说，我实在告诉你们，站在这里的，有人在没尝死味以前，必要看见神的国大有能力临到。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be some of
them that stand here, which shall not taste of death, till they have
seen the kingdom of God come with power.</p>
<p>9:2
过了六天，耶稣带着彼得，雅各，约翰，暗暗的上了高山，就在他们面前变了形像。</p>
<p>And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and John,
and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he
was transfigured before them.</p>
<p>9:3 衣服放光，极其洁白。地上漂布的，没有一个能漂得那样白。</p>
<p>And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as no
fuller on earth can white them.</p>
<p>9:4 忽然有以利亚同摩西向他们显现。并且和耶稣说话。</p>
<p>And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were talking
with Jesus.</p>
<p>9:5
彼得对耶稣说，拉比，（拉比就是夫子）我们在这里真好。可以搭三座棚，一座为你，一座为摩西，一座为以利亚。</p>
<p>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be
here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for
Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p>9:6 彼得不知道说什么才好。因为他们甚是惧怕，</p>
<p>For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</p>
<p>9:7
有一朵云彩来遮盖他们。也有声音从云彩里出来说，这是我的爱子，你们要听他。</p>
<p>And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came out of
the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>
<p>9:8 门徒忽然周围一看，不见一人，只见耶稣同他们在那里。</p>
<p>And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no man any
more, save Jesus only with themselves.</p>
<p>9:9
下山的时候，耶稣嘱咐他们说，人子还没有从死里复活，你们不要将所看见的告诉人。</p>
<p>And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they
should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were
risen from the dead.</p>
<p>9:10 门徒将这话存记在心，彼此议论从死里复活是什么意思。</p>
<p>And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one with
another what the rising from the dead should mean.</p>
<p>9:11 他们就问耶稣说，文士为什么说，以利亚必须先来。</p>
<p>And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias must first
come?</p>
<p>9:12
耶稣说，以利亚固然先来，复兴万事。经上不是指着人子说，他要受许多的苦，被人轻慢呢。</p>
<p>And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and
restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man, that he
must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</p>
<p>9:13
我告诉你们，以利亚已经来了，他们也任意待他，正如经上所指着他的话。</p>
<p>But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have done
unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</p>
<p>9:14 耶稣到了门徒那里，看见有许多人围着他们，又有文士和他们辩论。</p>
<p>And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about
them, and the scribes questioning with them.</p>
<p>9:15 众人一见耶稣，都甚希奇，就跑上去问他的安。</p>
<p>And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly
amazed, and running to him saluted him.</p>
<p>9:16 耶稣问他们说，你们和他们辩论的是什么。</p>
<p>And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</p>
<p>9:17
众人中间有一个回答说，夫子，我带了我的儿子到你这里来，他被哑巴鬼附着。</p>
<p>And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought
unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</p>
<p>9:18
无论在那里，鬼捉弄他，把他摔倒，他就口中流沫，咬牙切齿，身体枯乾，我请过你的门徒把鬼赶出去，他们却是不能。</p>
<p>And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and
gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to thy disciples
that they should cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p>9:19
耶稣说，嗳，不信的世代阿，我在你们这里要到几时呢。我忍耐你们要到几时呢。把他带到我这里来吧。</p>
<p>He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I
be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him unto me.</p>
<p>9:20
他们就带了他来。他一见耶稣，鬼便叫他重重的抽疯。倒在地上，翻来覆去，口中流沫。</p>
<p>And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the
spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</p>
<p>9:21 耶稣问他父亲说，他得这病，有多少日子呢。回答说，从小的时后。</p>
<p>And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came unto him?
And he said, Of a child.</p>
<p>9:22
鬼屡次把他扔在火里，水里，要灭他。你若能作什么，求你怜悯我们，帮助我们。</p>
<p>And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to
destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and
help us.</p>
<p>9:23 耶稣对他说，你若能信，在信的人，凡事都能。</p>
<p>Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible
to him that believeth.</p>
<p>9:24
孩子的父亲立时喊着说，我信。但我信不足，求主帮助。（有古卷作立时流泪的喊着说）</p>
<p>And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said with
tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</p>
<p>9:25
耶稣看见众人都跑上来，就斥责那污鬼，说，你们聋哑的鬼，我吩咐你从他里头出来，再不要进去。</p>
<p>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the
foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I charge thee,
come out of him, and enter no more into him.</p>
<p>9:26
那鬼喊叫，使孩子大大的抽了一阵疯，就出来了。孩子好像死了一班，以致众人多半说，他是死了。</p>
<p>And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him: and he
was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</p>
<p>9:27 但耶稣拉他的手，扶他起来，他就站起来了。</p>
<p>But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he arose.</p>
<p>9:28 耶稣进了屋子，门徒就暗暗的问他说，我们为什么不能赶出他去呢。</p>
<p>And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him
privately, Why could not we cast him out?</p>
<p>9:29
耶稣说，非用祷告，（有古卷在这有禁食二字）这一类的鬼，总不能出来。（或作不能赶他出来）</p>
<p>And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by
prayer and fasting.</p>
<p>9:30 他们离开那地方，经过加利利。耶稣不愿意人知道。</p>
<p>And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would
not that any man should know it.</p>
<p>9:31
于是教训门徒，说，人子将要被交在人手里，他们要杀害他。被杀以后，过三天他要复活。</p>
<p>For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is
delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after that
he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>
<p>9:32 门徒却不明白这话，又不敢问他。</p>
<p>But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p>9:33 他们来到迦百农。耶稣在屋里问门徒说，你们在路上议论的是什么。</p>
<p>And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What
was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?</p>
<p>9:34 门徒不作声，因为他们在路上彼此争论谁为大。</p>
<p>But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among
themselves, who should be the greatest.</p>
<p>9:35
耶稣坐下，叫十二个门徒来，说，有人愿意作首先的，他必作众人末后的，作众人的用人。</p>
<p>And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them, If any
man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of
all.</p>
<p>9:36
于是领过一个小孩子来，叫他站在门徒中间。又抱起他来，对他们说，</p>
<p>And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and when he
had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</p>
<p>9:37
凡为我名，接待一个像这小孩子的就是接待我。凡接待我的，不是接待我，乃是接待那差我来的。</p>
<p>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receiveth
me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that sent
me.</p>
<p>9:38
约翰对耶稣说，夫子，我们看见一个人，奉你的名赶鬼，我们就禁止他，因为他不跟从我们。</p>
<p>And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils
in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad him, because he
followeth not us.</p>
<p>9:39 耶稣说，不要禁止他。因为没有人奉我名行异能，反倒轻易毁谤我。</p>
<p>But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a
miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me.</p>
<p>9:40 不敌挡我们的，就是帮助我们的。</p>
<p>For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>
<p>9:41
凡因你们是属基督，给你们一杯水喝的，我实在告诉你们，他不能不得赏赐。</p>
<p>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name,
because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose
his reward.</p>
<p>9:42
凡使这信我的一个小子跌倒的，倒不如把大磨石栓在这人的颈项上，扔在海里。</p>
<p>And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in
me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he were cast into the sea.</p>
<p>9:43 倘若你一只手叫你跌倒，就把他砍下来。</p>
<p>And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, into the
fire that never shall be quenched:</p>
<p>9:44 你缺了肢体进入永生，强如有两只手落到地狱，入那不灭的火里去。</p>
<p>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p>9:45 倘若你一只脚叫你跌倒，就把他砍下来。</p>
<p>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee to
enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into
the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>
<p>9:46 你瘸腿进入永生，强如有两只脚被丢在地狱里。</p>
<p>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p>9:47
倘若你一只眼叫你跌倒，就去掉他。你只有一只眼进入神的国，强如有两只眼被丢在地狱里。</p>
<p>And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for thee to
enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be
cast into hell fire:</p>
<p>9:48 在那里虫是不死的，火是不灭的。</p>
<p>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p>9:49 因为必用火当盐，腌各人。（有古卷在此有凡祭物必用盐腌）</p>
<p>For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be
salted with salt.</p>
<p>9:50
盐本是好的，若失了味，可用什么叫他在咸呢。你们里头应当有盐，彼此和睦。</p>
<p>Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness, wherewith will
ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with
another.</p>
