<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-6-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 6 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>6:1
以色列人出埃及地后四百八十年，所罗门作以色列王第四年西弗月，就是二月，开工建造耶和华的殿。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth
year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the
second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:2 所罗门王为耶和华所建的殿，长六十肘，宽二十肘，高三十肘。</p>
<p>And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>
<p>6:3 殿前的廊子长二十肘，与殿的宽窄一样，阔十肘。</p>
<p>And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the
length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits
was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>
<p>6:4 又为殿作了严紧的窗棂。</p>
<p>And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
<p>6:5 靠着殿墙，围着外殿内殿，造了三层旁屋。</p>
<p>And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>
<p>6:6
下层宽五肘，中层宽六肘，上层宽七肘。殿外旁屋的梁木搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。</p>
<p>The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six
cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the
wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
<p>6:7
建殿是用山中凿成的石头。建殿的时候，槌子，斧子，和别样铁器的响声都没有听见。</p>
<p>And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready
before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe
nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>
<p>6:8
在殿右边当中的旁屋有门，门内有旋螺的楼梯，可以上到第二层，从第二层可以上到第三层。</p>
<p>The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house:
and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of
the middle into the third.</p>
<p>6:9 所罗门建殿，安置香柏木的楝梁，又用香柏木板遮盖。</p>
<p>So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with
beams and boards of cedar.</p>
<p>6:10 靠着殿所造的旁屋，每层高五肘，香柏木的楝梁搁在殿墙坎上。</p>
<p>And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high:
and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
<p>6:11 耶和华的话临到所罗门说，</p>
<p>And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>
<p>6:12
论到你所建的这殿，你若遵行我的律例，谨守我的典章，遵从我的一切诫命，我必向你应验我所应许你父亲大卫的话。</p>
<p>Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk
in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments
to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake
unto David thy father:</p>
<p>6:13 我必住在以色列人中间，并不丢弃我民以色列。</p>
<p>And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake
my people Israel.</p>
<p>6:14 所罗门建造殿宇。</p>
<p>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
<p>6:15
殿里面用香柏木板贴墙，从地到棚顶都用木板遮蔽，又用松木板铺地。</p>
<p>And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered
them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with
planks of fir.</p>
<p>6:16
内殿，就是至圣所，长二十肘，从地到棚顶用香柏木板遮蔽（或作隔断）。</p>
<p>And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor
and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within,
even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p>
<p>6:17 内殿前的外殿，长四十肘。</p>
<p>And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
long.</p>
<p>6:18
殿里一点石头都不显露，一概用香柏木遮蔽。上面刻着野瓜和初开的花。</p>
<p>And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>
<p>6:19 殿里预备了内殿，好安放耶和华的约柜。</p>
<p>And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark
of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:20
内殿长二十肘，宽二十肘，高二十肘，墙面都贴上精金。又用香柏木作坛，包上精金。</p>
<p>And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and
he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of
cedar.</p>
<p>6:21
所罗门用精金贴了殿内的墙，又用金链子挂在内殿前门扇，用金包裹。</p>
<p>So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a
partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it
with gold.</p>
<p>6:22 全殿都贴上金子，直到贴完。内殿前的坛，也都用金包裹。</p>
<p>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all
the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with
gold.</p>
<p>6:23 他用橄榄木作两个基路伯，各高十肘，安在内殿。</p>
<p>And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten
cubits high.</p>
<p>6:24
这一个基路伯有两个翅膀，各长五肘，从这翅膀尖到那翅膀尖共有十肘。</p>
<p>And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the
other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto
the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>
<p>6:25
那一个基路伯的两个翅膀也是十肘，两个基路伯的尺寸，形像都是一样。</p>
<p>And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of one
measure and one size.</p>
<p>6:26 这基路伯高十肘，那基路伯也是如此。</p>
<p>The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the
other cherub.</p>
<p>6:27
他将两个基路伯安在内殿里。基路伯的翅膀是张开的，这基路伯的一个翅膀挨着这边的墙，那基路伯的一个翅膀挨着那边的墙，里边的两个翅膀在殿中间彼此相接。</p>
<p>And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched
forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched
the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall;
and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>
<p>6:28 又用金子包裹二基路伯。</p>
<p>And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
<p>6:29 内殿，外殿周围的墙上都刻着基路伯，棕树，和初开的花。</p>
<p>And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
without.</p>
<p>6:30 内殿，外殿的地板都贴上金子。</p>
<p>And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
without.</p>
<p>6:31 又用橄榄木制造内殿的门扇，门楣，门框。门口有墙的五分之一。</p>
<p>And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the
lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>
<p>6:32
在橄榄木作的两门扇上刻着基路伯，棕树，和初开的花，都贴上金子。</p>
<p>The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them
with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm
trees.</p>
<p>6:33 又用橄榄木制造外殿的门框，门口有墙的四分之一。</p>
<p>So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a
fourth part of the wall.</p>
<p>6:34
用松木作门两扇。这扇分两扇，是摺叠的。那扇分两扇。也是摺叠的。</p>
<p>And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door
were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>
<p>6:35 上面刻着基路伯，棕树，和初开的花，都用金子贴了。</p>
<p>And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and
covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
<p>6:36 他又用凿成的石头三层，香柏木一层建筑内院。</p>
<p>And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a
row of cedar beams.</p>
<p>6:37 所罗门在位第四年西弗月，立了耶和华殿的根基。</p>
<p>In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid,
in the month Zif:</p>
<p>6:38
到十一年布勒月，就是八月，殿和一切属殿的都按着样式造成。他建殿的工夫共有七年。</p>
<p>And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth
month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and
according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building
it.</p>
