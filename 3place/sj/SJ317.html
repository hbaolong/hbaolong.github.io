<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-4-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 4 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>4:1
有一个先知门徒的妻哀求以利沙说，你仆人我丈夫死了，他敬畏耶和华是你所知道的。现在有债主来，要取我两个儿子作奴仆。</p>
<p>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the
prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou
knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to
take unto him my two sons to be bondmen.</p>
<p>4:2
以利沙问她说，我可以为你作什么呢。你告诉我，你家里有什么。她说，婢女家中除了一瓶油之外，没有什么。</p>
<p>And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what
hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing
in the house, save a pot of oil.</p>
<p>4:3 以利沙说，你去，向你众邻舍借空器皿，不要少借。</p>
<p>Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours,
even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</p>
<p>4:4
回到家里，关上门，你和你儿子在里面将油倒在所有的器皿里，倒满了的放在一边。</p>
<p>And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and
upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt
set aside that which is full.</p>
<p>4:5
于是，妇人离开以利沙去了，关上门，自己和儿子在里面。儿子把器皿拿来，她就倒油。</p>
<p>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons,
who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</p>
<p>4:6
器皿都满了，她对儿子说，再给我拿器皿来。儿子说，再没有器皿了。油就止住了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto
her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a
vessel more. And the oil stayed.</p>
<p>4:7
妇人去告诉神人，神人说，你去卖油还债，所剩的你和你儿子可以靠着度日。</p>
<p>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil,
and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest.</p>
<p>4:8
一日，以利沙走到书念，在那里有一个大户的妇人强留他吃饭。此后，以利沙每从那里经过就进去吃饭。</p>
<p>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great
woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft
as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</p>
<p>4:9 妇人对丈夫说，我看出那常从我们这里经过的是圣洁的神人。</p>
<p>And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an
holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.</p>
<p>4:10
我们可以为他在墙上盖一间小楼，在其中安放床榻，桌子，椅子，灯台，他来到我们这里，就可以住在其间。</p>
<p>Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us
set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick:
and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in
thither.</p>
<p>4:11 一日，以利沙来到那里，就进了那楼躺卧。</p>
<p>And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the
chamber, and lay there.</p>
<p>4:12
以利沙吩咐仆人基哈西说，你叫这书念妇人来。他就把妇人叫了来，妇人站在以利沙面前。</p>
<p>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he
had called her, she stood before him.</p>
<p>4:13
以利沙吩咐仆人说，你对她说，你既为我们费了许多心思，可以为你作什么呢。你向王或元帅有所求的没有。她回答说，我在我本乡安居无事。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest
thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she
answered, I dwell among mine own people.</p>
<p>4:14
以利沙对仆人说，究竟当为她作什么呢。基哈西说，她没有儿子，她丈夫也老了。</p>
<p>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered,
Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</p>
<p>4:15 以利沙说，再叫她来。于是叫了她来，她就站在门口。</p>
<p>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the
door.</p>
<p>4:16
以利沙说，明年到这时候，你必抱一个儿子。她说，神人，我主阿，不要那样欺哄婢女。</p>
<p>And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou
shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not
lie unto thine handmaid.</p>
<p>4:17 妇人果然怀孕，到了那时候，生了一个儿子，正如以利沙所说的。</p>
<p>And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha
had said unto her, according to the time of life.</p>
<p>4:18 孩子渐渐长大，一日到他父亲和收割的人那里，</p>
<p>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to
his father to the reapers.</p>
<p>4:19
他对父亲说，我的头阿，我的头阿。他父亲对仆人说，把他抱到他母亲那里。</p>
<p>And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad,
Carry him to his mother.</p>
<p>4:20 仆人抱去，交给他母亲。孩子坐在母亲的膝上，到晌午就死了。</p>
<p>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on
her knees till noon, and then died.</p>
<p>4:21 他母亲抱他上了楼，将他放在神人的床上，关上门出来，</p>
<p>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut
the door upon him, and went out.</p>
<p>4:22
呼叫她丈夫说，你叫一个仆人给我牵一匹驴来，我要快快地去见神人，就回来。</p>
<p>And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one
of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of
God, and come again.</p>
<p>4:23
丈夫说，今日不是月朔，也不是安息日，你为何要去见他呢。妇人说，平安无事。</p>
<p>And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new
moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</p>
<p>4:24
于是备上驴，对仆人说，你快快赶着走，我若不吩咐你，就不要迟慢。</p>
<p>Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go
forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.</p>
<p>4:25
妇人就往迦密山去见神人。神人远远地看见她，对仆人基哈西说，看哪，书念的妇人来了。</p>
<p>So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came
to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi
his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</p>
<p>4:26
你跑去迎接她，问她说，你平安吗。你丈夫平安吗。孩子平安吗。她说，平安。</p>
<p>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with
thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she
answered, It is well.</p>
<p>4:27
妇人上了山，到神人那里，就抱住神人的脚。基哈西前来要推开她，神人说，由她吧。因为她心里愁苦，耶和华向我隐瞒，没有指示我。</p>
<p>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by
the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God
said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath
hid it from me, and hath not told me.</p>
<p>4:28 妇人说，我何尝向我主求过儿子呢。我岂没有说过，不要欺哄我吗。</p>
<p>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not
deceive me?</p>
<p>4:29
以利沙吩咐基哈西说，你束上腰，手拿我的杖前去。若遇见人，不要向他问安。人若向你问安，也不要回答。要把我的杖放在孩子脸上。</p>
<p>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine
hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any
salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the
child.</p>
<p>4:30
孩子的母亲说，我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓，我必不离开你。于是以利沙起身，随着她去了。</p>
<p>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</p>
<p>4:31
基哈西先去，把杖放在孩子脸上，却没有声音，也没有动静。基哈西就迎着以利沙回来，告诉他说，孩子还没有醒过来。</p>
<p>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of
the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went
again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</p>
<p>4:32 以利沙来到，进了屋子，看见孩子死了，放在自己的床上。</p>
<p>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead,
and laid upon his bed.</p>
<p>4:33 他就关上门，只有自己和孩子在里面，他便祈祷耶和华，</p>
<p>He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed
unto the LORD.</p>
<p>4:34
上床伏在孩子身上，口对口，眼对眼，手对手。既伏在孩子身上，孩子的身体就渐渐温和了。</p>
<p>And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his
mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he
stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed
warm.</p>
<p>4:35
然后他下来，在屋里来往走了一趟，又上去伏在孩子身上，孩子打了七个喷嚏，就睁开眼睛了。</p>
<p>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up,
and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and
the child opened his eyes.</p>
<p>4:36
以利沙叫基哈西说，你叫这书念妇人来。于是叫了她来。以利沙说，将你儿子抱起来。</p>
<p>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called
her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.</p>
<p>4:37 妇人就进来，在以利沙脚前俯伏于地，抱起她儿子出去了。</p>
<p>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the
ground, and took up her son, and went out.</p>
<p>4:38
以利沙又来到吉甲，那地正有饥荒。先知门徒坐在他面前，他吩咐仆人说，你将大锅放在火上，给先知门徒熬汤。</p>
<p>And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land;
and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto
his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of
the prophets.</p>
<p>4:39
有一个人去到田野掐菜，遇见一棵野瓜藤，就摘了一兜野瓜回来，切了搁在熬汤的锅中，因为他们不知道是什么东西。</p>
<p>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild
vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred
them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</p>
<p>4:40
倒出来给众人吃，吃的时候，都喊叫说，神人哪，锅中有致死的毒物。所以众人不能吃了。</p>
<p>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they
were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of
God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</p>
<p>4:41
以利沙说，拿点面来，就把面撒在锅中，说，倒出来，给众人吃吧。锅中就没有毒了。</p>
<p>But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he
said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm
in the pot.</p>
<p>4:42
有一个人从巴力沙利沙来，带着初熟大麦作的饼二十个，并新穗子，装在口袋里送给神人。神人说，把这些给众人吃。</p>
<p>And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God
bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn
in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may
eat.</p>
<p>4:43
仆人说，这一点岂可摆给一百人吃呢。以利沙说，你只管给众人吃吧。因为耶和华如此说，众人必吃了，还剩下。</p>
<p>And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men?
He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the
LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</p>
<p>4:44 仆人就摆在众人面前，他们吃了，果然还剩下，正如耶和华所说的。</p>
<p>So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
according to the word of the LORD.</p>
