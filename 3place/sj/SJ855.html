<h4 id="旧约-但以理书daniel-第-5-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
但以理书(Daniel) – 第 5 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 伯沙撒王为他的一千大臣设摆盛筵，与这一千人对面饮酒。</p>
<p>Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords,
and drank wine before the thousand.</p>
<p>5:2
伯沙撒欢饮之间，吩咐人将他父（或作祖下同）尼布甲尼撒从耶路撒冷殿中所掠的金银器皿拿来，王与大臣，皇后，妃嫔好用这器皿饮酒。</p>
<p>Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden
and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the
temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his
wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p>
<p>5:3
于是他们把耶路撒冷神殿库房中所掠的金器皿拿来，王和大臣，皇后，妃嫔就用这器皿饮酒。</p>
<p>Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the
temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his
princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p>
<p>5:4 他们饮酒，赞美金，银，铜，铁，木，石所造的神。</p>
<p>They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of
brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>
<p>5:5
当时，忽有人的指头显出，在王宫与灯台相对的粉墙上写字。王看见写字的指头，</p>
<p>In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote over
against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king’s
palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.</p>
<p>5:6 就变了脸色，心意惊惶，腰骨好像脱节，双膝彼此相碰，</p>
<p>Then the king’s countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled
him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote
one against another.</p>
<p>5:7
大声吩咐将用法术的和迦勒底人并观兆的领进来，对巴比伦的哲士说，谁能读这文字，把讲解告诉我，他必身穿紫袍，项带金链，在我国中位列第三。</p>
<p>The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and
the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of
Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the
interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain
of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p>5:8 于是王的一切哲士都进来，却不能读那文字，也不能把讲解告诉王。</p>
<p>Then came in all the king’s wise men: but they could not read the
writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</p>
<p>5:9 伯沙撒王就甚惊惶，脸色改变，他的大臣也都惊奇。</p>
<p>Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was
changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p>
<p>5:10
太后（或作皇后下同）因王和他大臣所说的话，就进入宴宫，说，愿王万岁。你心意不要惊惶，脸面不要变色。</p>
<p>Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came
into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for
ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be
changed:</p>
<p>5:11
在你国中有一人，他里头有圣神的灵，你父在世的日子，这人心中光明，又有聪明智慧，好像神的智慧。你父尼布甲尼撒王，就是王的父，立他为术士，用法术的，和迦勒底人，并观兆的领袖。</p>
<p>There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy
gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom,
like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king
Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of
the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p>
<p>5:12
在他里头有美好的灵性，又有知识聪明，能圆梦，释谜语，解疑惑。这人名叫但以理，尼布甲尼撒王又称他为伯提沙撒，现在可以召他来，他必解明这意思。</p>
<p>Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding,
interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of
doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar:
now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>
<p>5:13
但以理就被领到王前。王问但以理说，你是被掳之犹大人中的但以理吗。就是我父王从犹大掳来的吗。</p>
<p>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake and
said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the
captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p>
<p>5:14 我听说你里头有神的灵，心中光明，又有聪明和美好的智慧。</p>
<p>I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee,
and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in
thee.</p>
<p>5:15
现在哲士和用法术的都领到我面前，为叫他们读这文字，把讲解告诉我，无奈他们都不能把讲解说出来。</p>
<p>And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before
me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the
interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of
the thing:</p>
<p>5:16
我听说你善于讲解，能解疑惑。现在你若能读这文字，把讲解告诉我，就必身穿紫袍，项戴金链，在我国中位列第三。</p>
<p>And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and
dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to
me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and
have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the
kingdom.</p>
<p>5:17
但以理在王面前回答说，你的赠品可以归你自己，你的赏赐可以归给别人。我却要为王读这文字，把讲解告诉王。</p>
<p>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to
thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing
unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</p>
<p>5:18 王阿，至高的神曾将国位，大权，荣耀，威严赐与你父尼布甲尼撒。</p>
<p>O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>
<p>5:19
因神所赐他的大权，各方，各国，各族的人都在他面前山兢恐惧。他可以随意生杀，随意升降。</p>
<p>And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and
whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he
would he put down.</p>
<p>5:20
但他心高气傲，灵也刚愎，甚至行事狂傲，就被革去王位，夺去荣耀。</p>
<p>But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he
was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from
him:</p>
<p>5:21
他被赶出离开世人，他的心变如兽心，与野驴同居，吃草如牛，身被天露滴湿，等他知道至高的神在人的国中掌权，凭自己的意旨立人治国。</p>
<p>And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like
the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with
grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he
knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he
appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</p>
<p>5:22
伯沙撒阿，你是他的儿子（或作孙子），你虽知道这一切，你心仍不自卑，</p>
<p>And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though
thou knewest all this;</p>
<p>5:23
竟向天上的主自高，使人将他殿中的器皿拿到你面前，你和大臣，皇后，妃嫔用这器皿饮酒。你又赞美那不能看，不能听，无知无识，金，银，铜，铁，木，石所造的神，却没有将荣耀归于那手中有你气息，管理你一切行动的神。</p>
<p>But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have
brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords,
thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast
praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone,
which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath
is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</p>
<p>5:24 因此从神那里显出指头来写这文字。</p>
<p>Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was
written.</p>
<p>5:25 所写的文字是，弥尼，弥尼，提客勒，乌法珥新。</p>
<p>And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
UPHARSIN.</p>
<p>5:26 讲解是这样，弥尼，就是神已经数算你国的年日到此完毕。</p>
<p>This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy
kingdom, and finished it.</p>
<p>5:27 提客勒，就是你被称在天平里，显出你的亏欠。</p>
<p>TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting.</p>
<p>5:28
毗勒斯（与乌法珥新同义），就是你的国分裂，归与玛代人和波斯人。</p>
<p>PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
Persians.</p>
<p>5:29
伯沙撒下令，人就把紫袍给但以理穿上，把金链给他戴在颈项上，又传令使他在国中位列第三。</p>
<p>Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with scarlet, and
put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning
him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>
<p>5:30 当夜，迦勒底王伯沙撒被杀。</p>
<p>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</p>
<p>5:31 玛代人大流士年六十二岁，取了迦勒底国。</p>
<p>And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and
two years old.</p>
