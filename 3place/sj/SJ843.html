<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-41-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 41 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>41:1
他带我到殿那里量墙柱，这面厚六肘，那面厚六肘，宽窄与会幕相同。</p>
<p>Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six
cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,
which was the breadth of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>41:2
门口宽十肘。门两旁，这边五肘，那边五肘。他量殿长四十肘，宽二十肘。</p>
<p>And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the door
were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side: and
he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth, twenty
cubits.</p>
<p>41:3 他到内殿量墙柱，各厚二肘。门口宽六肘，门两旁各宽七肘。</p>
<p>Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two cubits;
and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.</p>
<p>41:4 他量内殿，长二十肘，宽二十肘。他对我说，这是至圣所。</p>
<p>So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth,
twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is the most
holy place.</p>
<p>41:5 他又量殿墙，厚六肘。围着殿有旁屋，各宽四肘。</p>
<p>After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth
of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on every
side.</p>
<p>41:6
旁屋有三层，层叠而上，每层排列三十间。旁屋的梁木搁在殿墙坎上，免得插入殿墙。</p>
<p>And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty in
order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the
side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not
hold in the wall of the house.</p>
<p>41:7
这围殿的旁屋越高越宽。因旁屋围殿悬叠而上，所以越上越宽，从下一层，由中一层，到上一层。</p>
<p>And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the
side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward
round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still
upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the
midst.</p>
<p>41:8 我又见围着殿有高月台。旁屋的根基，高足一竿，就是六大肘。</p>
<p>I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations of
the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</p>
<p>41:9 旁屋的外墙厚五肘。旁屋之外还有馀地。</p>
<p>The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber without,
was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the side
chambers that were within.</p>
<p>41:10 在旁屋与对面的房屋中间有空地，宽二十肘。</p>
<p>And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round
about the house on every side.</p>
<p>41:11 旁屋的门都向馀地，一门向北，一门向南。周围的馀地宽五肘。</p>
<p>And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was
left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south: and
the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about.</p>
<p>41:12 在西面空地之后有房子，宽七十肘，长九十肘，墙四围厚五肘。</p>
<p>Now the building that was before the separate place at the end toward
the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five
cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety cubits.</p>
<p>41:13 这样，他量殿，长一百肘，又量空地和那房子并墙，共长一百肘。</p>
<p>So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the separate
place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred cubits
long;</p>
<p>41:14 殿的前面和两旁的空地，宽一百肘。</p>
<p>Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place
toward the east, an hundred cubits.</p>
<p>41:15 他量空地后面的那房子，并两旁的楼廊，共长一百肘。</p>
<p>And he measured the length of the building over against the separate
place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one side and
on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the
porches of the court;</p>
<p>41:16
内殿，院廊，门槛，严紧的窗棂，并对着门槛的三层楼廊，从地到窗棂（窗棂都有蔽子），</p>
<p>The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about
on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood round
about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were
covered;</p>
<p>41:17
直到门以上，就是到内殿和外殿内外四围墙壁，都按尺寸用木板遮蔽。</p>
<p>To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without, and
by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</p>
<p>41:18
墙上雕刻基路伯和棕树。每二基路伯中间有一棵棕树，每基路伯有二脸。</p>
<p>And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree
was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two faces;</p>
<p>41:19
这边有人脸向着棕树，那边有狮子脸向着棕树，殿内周围都是如此。</p>
<p>So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side,
and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other side: it
was made through all the house round about.</p>
<p>41:20 从地至门以上，都有基路伯和棕树。殿墙就是这样。</p>
<p>From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees
made, and on the wall of the temple.</p>
<p>41:21 殿的门柱是方的。至圣所的前面，形状和殿的形状一样。</p>
<p>The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the sanctuary;
the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.</p>
<p>41:22
坛是木头作的，高三肘，长二肘。坛角和坛面，并四旁，都是木头作的。他对我说，这是耶和华面前的桌子。</p>
<p>The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof two
cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls
thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that is
before the LORD.</p>
<p>41:23 殿和至圣所的门各有两扇。</p>
<p>And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</p>
<p>41:24 每扇分两扇，这两扇是摺叠的。这边门分两扇，那边门也分两扇。</p>
<p>And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves
for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.</p>
<p>41:25
殿的门扇上雕刻基路伯和棕树，与刻在墙上的一般。在外头廊前有木槛。</p>
<p>And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubims
and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick
planks upon the face of the porch without.</p>
<p>41:26 廊这边那边都有严紧的窗棂和棕树。殿的旁屋和槛就是这样。</p>
<p>And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on
the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side chambers of
the house, and thick planks.</p>
