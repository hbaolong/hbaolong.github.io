<p>1:1
以色列人出埃及地后，第二年二月初一日，耶和华在西奈的旷野，会幕中晓谕摩西说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in
the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
saying,</p>
<p>1:2 你要按以色列全会众的家室，宗族，人名的数目，计算所有的男丁。</p>
<p>Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,
after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of
their names, every male by their polls;</p>
<p>1:3
凡以色列中，从二十岁以外，能出去打仗的，你和亚伦要照他们的军队数点。</p>
<p>From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to
war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies.</p>
<p>1:4 每支派中，必有一人作本支派的族长，帮助你们。</p>
<p>And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of
the house of his fathers.</p>
<p>1:5 他们的名字，属流便的，有示丢珥的儿子以利蓿。</p>
<p>And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you: of the
tribe of Reuben; Elizur the son of Shedeur.</p>

names:</p>

当二月初一日招聚全会众。会众就照他们的家室，宗族，人名的数目，从二十岁以外的，都述说自己的家谱。</p>
<p>And they assembled all the congregation together on the first day of
the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their
families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the
names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls.</p>

Sinai.</p>

<p>1:48 因为耶和华晓谕摩西说，</p>
<p>For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>1:49 惟独利未支派你不可数点，也不可在以色列人中计算他们的总数。</p>
<p>Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of
them among the children of Israel:</p>
<p>1:50
只要派利未人管法柜的帐幕和其中的器具，并属乎帐幕的。他们要抬（抬或作搬运）帐幕和其中的器具，并要办理帐幕的事，在帐幕的四围安营。</p>
<p>But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony,
and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it:
they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they
shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p>1:51
帐幕将往前行的时候，利未人要拆卸。将支搭的时候，利未人要竖起。近前来的外人必被治死。</p>
<p>And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it
down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it
up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</p>
<p>1:52 以色列人支搭帐棚，要照他们的军队，各归本营，各归本纛。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his
own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.</p>
<p>1:53
但利未人要在法柜帐幕的四围安营，免得忿怒临到以色列会众。利未人并要谨守法柜的帐幕。</p>
<p>But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony,
that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel:
and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of
testimony.</p>
<p>1:54 以色列人就这样行。凡耶和华所吩咐摩西的，他们就照样行了。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses, so did they.</p>
