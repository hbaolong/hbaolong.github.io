<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-21-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 21 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>21:1
这事以后，又有一事。耶斯列人拿伯在耶斯列有只个葡萄园，靠近撒马利亚王亚哈的宫。</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite
had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of
Samaria.</p>
<p>21:2
亚哈对拿伯说，你将你的葡萄园给我作菜园，因为是靠近我的宫。我就把更好的葡萄园换给你，或是你要银子，我就按着价值给你。</p>
<p>And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may
have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I
will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to
thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p>
<p>21:3 拿伯对亚哈说，我敬畏耶和华，万不敢将我先人留下的产业给你。</p>
<p>And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give
the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p>
<p>21:4
亚哈因耶斯列人拿伯说我不敢将我先人留下的产业给你，就闷闷不乐地回宫，躺在床上，转脸向内，也不吃饭。</p>
<p>And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word
which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will
not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon
his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</p>
<p>21:5 王后耶洗别来问他说，你为什么心里这样忧闷，不吃饭呢。</p>
<p>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy
spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</p>
<p>21:6
他回答说，因我向耶斯列人拿伯说，你将你的葡萄园给我，我给你价银，或是你愿意，我就把别的葡萄园换给你。他却说，我不将我的葡萄园给你。</p>
<p>And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and
said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please
thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will
not give thee my vineyard.</p>
<p>21:7
王后耶洗别对亚哈说，你现在是治理以色列国不是。只管起来，心里畅畅快快地吃饭，我必将耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园给你。</p>
<p>And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom
of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will
give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
<p>21:8
于是托亚哈的名写信，用王的印印上，送给那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄。</p>
<p>So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal,
and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his
city, dwelling with Naboth.</p>
<p>21:9 信上写着说，你们当宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上，</p>
<p>And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth
on high among the people:</p>
<p>21:10
又叫两个匪徒坐在拿伯对面，作见证告他说，你谤渎神和王了。随后就把他拉出去用石头打死。</p>
<p>And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against
him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him
out, and stone him, that he may die.</p>
<p>21:11 那些与拿伯同城居住的长老贵胄得了耶洗别的信，就照信而行，</p>
<p>And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the
inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and as it
was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.</p>
<p>21:12 宣告禁食，叫拿伯坐在民间的高位上。</p>
<p>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</p>
<p>21:13
有两个匪徒来，坐在拿伯的对面，当着众民作见证告他说，拿伯谤渎神和王了。众人就把他拉到城外，用石头打死。</p>
<p>And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him:
and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the
presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.
Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones,
that he died.</p>
<p>21:14 于是打发人去见耶洗别，说，拿伯被石头打死了。</p>
<p>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</p>
<p>21:15
耶洗别听见拿伯被石头打死，就对亚哈说，你起来得耶斯列人拿伯不肯为价银给你的葡萄园吧。现在他已经死了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and
was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the
vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for
money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</p>
<p>21:16 亚哈听见拿伯死了，就起来，下去要得耶斯列人拿伯的葡萄园。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
possession of it.</p>
<p>21:17 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说，</p>
<p>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>
<p>21:18
你起来，去见住撒马利亚的以色列王亚哈，他下去要得拿伯的葡萄园，现今正在那园里。</p>
<p>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:
behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to
possess it.</p>
<p>21:19
你要对他说，耶和华如此说，你杀了人，又得他的产业吗。又要对他说，耶和华如此说，狗在何处舔拿伯的血，也必在何处舔你的血。</p>
<p>And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou
killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,
saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of
Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.</p>
<p>21:20
亚哈对以利亚说，我仇敌阿，你找到我吗。他回答说，我找到你了。因为你卖了自己，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事。</p>
<p>And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he
answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil
in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:21
耶和华说，我必使灾祸临到你，将你除尽。凡属你的男丁，无论困住的，自由的，都从以色列中剪除。</p>
<p>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall,
and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</p>
<p>21:22
我必使你的家像尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家，又像亚希雅的儿子巴沙的家。因为你惹我发怒，又使以色列人陷在罪里。</p>
<p>And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the
provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to
sin.</p>
<p>21:23 论到耶洗别，耶和华也说，狗在耶斯列的外郭必吃耶洗别的肉。</p>
<p>And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</p>
<p>21:24
凡属亚哈的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。</p>
<p>Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that
dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>
<p>21:25
（从来没有像亚哈的，因他自卖，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，受了王后耶洗别的耸动。</p>
<p>But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work
wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred
up.</p>
<p>21:26
就照耶和华在以色列人面前所赶出的亚摩利人，行了最可憎恶的事，信从偶像。）</p>
<p>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all
things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children
of Israel.</p>
<p>21:27
亚哈听见这话，就撕裂衣服，禁食，身穿麻布，睡卧也穿着麻布，并且缓缓而行。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in
sackcloth, and went softly.</p>
<p>21:28 耶和华的话临到提斯比人以利亚说，</p>
<p>And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>
<p>21:29
亚哈在我面前赦样自卑，你看见了吗。因他在我面前自卑，他还在世的时候，我不降这祸。到他儿子的时候，我必降这祸与他的家。</p>
<p>Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth
himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his
son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.</p>
