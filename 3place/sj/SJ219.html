<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-8-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
以法莲人对基甸说，你去与米甸人争战，没有招我们同去，为什么这样待我们呢。他们就与基甸大大地争吵。</p>
<p>And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus,
that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the
Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.</p>
<p>8:2
基甸对他们说，我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢。以法莲拾取剩下的葡萄不强过亚比以谢所摘的葡萄吗。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is
not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of
Abiezer?</p>
<p>8:3
神已将米甸人的两个首领俄立和西伊伯交在你们手中。我所行的岂能比你们所行的呢。基甸说了这话，以法莲人的怒气就消了。</p>
<p>God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and
Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger
was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p>
<p>8:4 基甸和跟随他的三百人到约旦河过渡，虽然疲乏，还是追赶。</p>
<p>And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred
men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</p>
<p>8:5
基甸对疏割人说，求你们拿饼来给跟随我的人吃，因为他们疲乏了。我们追赶米甸人的两个王西巴和撒慕拿。</p>
<p>And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of
bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am
pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</p>
<p>8:6
疏割人的首领回答说，西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给你的军兵吗。</p>
<p>And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna
now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</p>
<p>8:7
基甸说，耶和华将西巴和撒慕拿交在我手之后，我就用野地的荆条和枳棘打伤你们。</p>
<p>And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and
Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of
the wilderness and with briers.</p>
<p>8:8
基甸从那里上到毗努伊勒，对那里的人也是这样说。毗努伊勒人也与疏割人回答他的话一样。</p>
<p>And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and
the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered
him.</p>
<p>8:9 他向毗努伊勒人说，我平平安安回来的时候，我必拆毁这楼。</p>
<p>And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again
in peace, I will break down this tower.</p>
<p>8:10
那时西巴和撒慕拿，并跟随他们的军队都在加各，约有一万五千人，就是东方人全军所剩下的。已经被杀约有十二万拿刀的。</p>
<p>Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,
about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the
children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men
that drew sword.</p>
<p>8:11
基甸就由挪巴和约比哈东边，从住帐棚人的路上去，杀败了米甸人的军兵，因为他们坦然无惧。</p>
<p>And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east
of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure.</p>
<p>8:12
西巴和撒慕拿逃跑。基甸追赶他们，捉住米甸的二王西巴和撒慕拿，惊散全军。</p>
<p>And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the
two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the
host.</p>
<p>8:13 约阿施的儿子基甸由希列斯坡从阵上回来，</p>
<p>And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was
up,</p>
<p>8:14
捉住疏割的一个少年人，问他，疏割的首领长老是谁。他就将首领长老七十七个人的名字写出来。</p>
<p>And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him:
and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders
thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.</p>
<p>8:15
基甸到了疏割，对那里的人说，你们从前讥诮我说，西巴和撒慕拿已经在你手里，你使我们将饼给跟随你的疲乏人吗。现在西巴和撒慕拿在这里。</p>
<p>And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and
Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah
and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men
that are weary?</p>
<p>8:16
于是捉住那城内的长老，用野地的荆条和枳棘责打（原文作指教）疏割人。</p>
<p>And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and
briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</p>
<p>8:17 又拆了毗努伊勒的楼，杀了那城里的人。</p>
<p>And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
city.</p>
<p>8:18
基甸问西巴和撒慕拿说，你们在他泊山所杀的人是什么样式。回答说，他们好像你，各人都有王子的样式。</p>
<p>Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they
whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they;
each one resembled the children of a king.</p>
<p>8:19
基甸说，他们是我同母的弟兄，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，你们从前若存留他们的性命，我如今就不杀你们了。</p>
<p>And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as
the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</p>
<p>8:20
于是对他的长子益帖说，你起来杀他们。但益帖因为是童子，害怕，不敢拔刀。</p>
<p>And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the
youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</p>
<p>8:21
西巴和撒慕拿说，你自己起来杀我们吧。因为人如何，力量也是如何。基甸就起来，杀了西巴和撒慕拿，夺获他们骆驼项上戴的月牙圈。</p>
<p>Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the
man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and
Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels’
necks.</p>
<p>8:22
以色列人对基甸说，你既救我们脱离米甸人的手，愿你和你的儿孙管理我们。</p>
<p>Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both
thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us
from the hand of Midian.</p>
<p>8:23
基甸说，我不管理你们，我的儿子也不管理你们，惟有耶和华管理你们。</p>
<p>And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my
son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</p>
<p>8:24
基甸又对他们说，我有一件事求你们，请你们各人将所夺的耳环给我。原来仇敌是以实玛利人，都是戴金耳环的。）</p>
<p>And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye
would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden
earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)</p>
<p>8:25
他们说，我们情愿给你。就铺开一件外衣，各人将所夺的耳环丢在其上。</p>
<p>And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a
garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</p>
<p>8:26
基甸所要出来的金耳环重一千七百舍客勒金子。此外还有米甸王所戴的月环，耳坠，和所穿的紫色衣服，并骆驼项上的金链子。</p>
<p>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and
collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside
the chains that were about their camels’ necks.</p>
<p>8:27
基甸以此制造了一个以弗得，设立在本城俄弗拉。后来以色列人拜那以弗得行了邪淫。这就作了基甸和他全家的网罗。</p>
<p>And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in
Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing
became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p>
<p>8:28
这样，米甸人被以色列人制伏了，不敢再抬头。基甸还在的日子，国中太平四十年。</p>
<p>Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they
lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty
years in the days of Gideon.</p>
<p>8:29 约阿施的儿子耶路巴力回去，住在自己家里。</p>
<p>And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</p>
<p>8:30 基甸有七十个亲生的儿子，因为他有许多的妻。</p>
<p>And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he
had many wives.</p>
<p>8:31 他的妾住在示剑，也给他生了一个儿子。基甸与他起名叫亚比米勒。</p>
<p>And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose
name he called Abimelech.</p>
<p>8:32
约阿施的儿子基甸，年纪老迈而死，葬在亚比以谢族的俄弗拉，在他父亲约阿施的坟墓里。</p>
<p>And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in
the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>
<p>8:33
基甸死后，以色列人又去随从诸巴力行邪淫，以巴力比利土为他们的神。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of
Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made
Baalberith their god.</p>
<p>8:34
以色列人不记念耶和华他们的神，就是拯救他们脱离四围仇敌之手的，</p>
<p>And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had
delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side:</p>
<p>8:35 也不照着耶路巴力，就是基甸向他们所施的恩惠厚待他的家。</p>
<p>Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely,
Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto
Israel.</p>
