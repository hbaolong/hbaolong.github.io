<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-20-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 20 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>20:1
于是以色列从但到别是巴，以及住基列地的众人都出来，如同一人，聚集在米斯巴耶和华面前。</p>
<p>Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was
gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land
of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.</p>
<p>20:2
以色列民的首领，就是各支派的军长，都站在神百姓的会中。拿刀的步兵共有四十万。</p>
<p>And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,
presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred
thousand footmen that drew sword.</p>
<p>20:3
以色列人上到米斯巴，便雅悯人都听见了。以色列人说，请你将这件恶事的情由对我们说明。</p>
<p>(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were
gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was
this wickedness?</p>
<p>20:4
那利未人，就是被害之妇人的丈夫，回答说，我和我的妾到了便雅悯的基比亚住宿。</p>
<p>And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and
said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine,
to lodge.</p>
<p>20:5
基比亚人夜间起来，围了我住的房子，想要杀我，又将我的妾强奸致死。</p>
<p>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round
about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine
have they forced, that she is dead.</p>
<p>20:6
我就把我妾的尸身切成块子，使人拿着传送以色列得为业的全地，因为基比亚人在以色列中行了凶淫丑恶的事。</p>
<p>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have
committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</p>
<p>20:7 你们以色列人都当筹划商议。</p>
<p>Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and
counsel.</p>
<p>20:8
众民都起来如同一人，说，我们连一人都不回自己帐棚，自己房屋去。</p>
<p>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go
to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</p>
<p>20:9 我们向基比亚人必这样行，照所掣的签去攻击他们。</p>
<p>But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will
go up by lot against it;</p>
<p>20:10
我们要在以色列各支派中，一百人挑取十人，一千人挑取百人，一万人挑取千人，为民运粮，等大众到了便雅悯的基比亚，就照基比亚人在以色列中所行的丑事征伐他们。</p>
<p>And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of
Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten
thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they
come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have
wrought in Israel.</p>
<p>20:11 于是以色列众人彼此连合如同一人，聚集攻击那城。</p>
<p>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
together as one man.</p>
<p>20:12
以色列众支派打发人去，问便雅悯支派的各家说，你们中间怎吗作了这样的恶事呢。</p>
<p>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,
saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</p>
<p>20:13
现在你们要将基比亚的那些匪徒交出来，我们好治死他们，从以色列中除掉这恶。便雅悯人却不肯听从他们弟兄以色列人的话。</p>
<p>Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are
in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.
But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their
brethren the children of Israel:</p>
<p>20:14
便雅悯人从他们的各城里出来，聚集到了基比亚，要与以色列人打仗。</p>
<p>But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the
cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of
Israel.</p>
<p>20:15
那时便雅悯人从各城里点出拿刀的，共有二万六千。另外还有基比亚人点出七百精兵。</p>
<p>And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the
cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the
inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</p>
<p>20:16
在众军之中有拣选的七百精兵，都是左手便利的，能用机弦甩石打人，毫发不差。</p>
<p>Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded;
every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss.</p>
<p>20:17 便雅悯人之外，点出以色列人拿刀的，共有四十万，都是战士。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred
thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.</p>
<p>20:18
以色列人就起来，到伯特利去求问神说，我们中间谁当首先上去与便雅悯人争战呢。耶和华说，犹大当先上去。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God,
and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the
battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall
go up first.</p>
<p>20:19 以色列人早晨起来，对着基比亚安营。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped
against Gibeah.</p>
<p>20:20 以色列人出来，要与便雅悯人打仗，就在基比亚前摆阵。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the
men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at
Gibeah.</p>
<p>20:21 便雅悯人就从基比亚出来，当日杀死以色列人二万二千。</p>
<p>And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed
down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand
men.</p>
<p>20:22 以色列人彼此奋勇，仍在头一日摆阵的地方又摆阵。</p>
<p>And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their
battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array
the first day.</p>
<p>20:23
未摆阵之先，以色列人上去，在耶和华面前哭号，直到晚上，求问耶和华说，我们再去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗可以不可以。耶和华说，可以上去攻击他们。</p>
<p>(And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until
even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to
battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said,
Go up against him.)</p>
<p>20:24 第二日，以色列人就上前攻击便雅悯人。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin
the second day.</p>
<p>20:25
便雅悯人也在这日从基比亚出来，与以色列人接战，又杀死他们一万八千，都是拿刀的。</p>
<p>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,
and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again
eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</p>
<p>20:26
以色列众人就上到伯特利，坐在耶和华面前哭号，当日禁食直到晚上。又在耶和华面前献燔祭和平安祭。</p>
<p>Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and
came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and
fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace
offerings before the LORD.</p>
<p>20:27 *</p>
<p>And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the
covenant of God was there in those days,</p>
<p>20:28
那时，神的约柜在那里。亚伦的孙子，以利亚撒的儿子非尼哈侍立在约柜前。以色列人问耶和华说，我们当再出去与我们弟兄便雅悯人打仗呢。还是吧兵呢。耶和华说，你们当上去，因为明日我必将他们交在你们手中。</p>
<p>And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it
in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the
children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go
up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</p>
<p>20:29 以色列人在基比亚的四围设下伏兵。</p>
<p>And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</p>
<p>20:30
第三日，以色列人又上去攻击便雅悯人，在基比亚前摆阵，与前两次一样。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin
on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at
other times.</p>
<p>20:31
便雅悯人也出来迎敌，就被引诱离城。在田间两条路上，一通伯特利，一通基比亚，像前两次，动手杀死以色列人约有三十个。</p>
<p>And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were
drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and
kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the
house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of
Israel.</p>
<p>20:32
便雅悯人说，他们仍旧败在我们面前。但以色列人说，我们不如逃跑，引诱他们离开城到路上来。</p>
<p>And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us,
as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw
them from the city unto the highways.</p>
<p>20:33
以色列众人都起来，在巴力他玛摆阵，以色列的伏兵从马利迦巴埋伏的地方冲上前去。</p>
<p>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came
forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</p>
<p>20:34
有以色列人中的一万精兵，来到基比亚前接战，势派甚是凶猛。便雅悯人却不知道灾祸临近了。</p>
<p>And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all
Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near
them.</p>
<p>20:35
耶和华使以色列人杀败便雅悯人。那日，以色列人杀死便雅悯人二万五千一百，都是拿刀的。</p>
<p>And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel
destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an
hundred men: all these drew the sword.</p>
<p>20:36
于是便雅悯人知道自己败了。先是以色列人。因为靠着在基比亚前所设的伏兵，就在便雅悯人面前嫂败。</p>
<p>So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men
of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the
liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</p>
<p>20:37 伏兵急忙闯进基比亚，用刀杀死全城的人。</p>
<p>And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers
in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of
the sword.</p>
<p>20:38 以色列人预先同伏兵约定在城内放火，以烟气上腾为号。</p>
<p>Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the
liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up
out of the city.</p>
<p>20:39
以色列人临退阵的时候，便雅悯人动手杀死以色列人，约有三十个，就说，他们仍像前次被我们杀败了。</p>
<p>And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to
smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said,
Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</p>
<p>20:40
当烟气如柱从城中上腾的时候，便雅悯人回头观看，见全城的烟气冲天。</p>
<p>But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of
smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the
city ascended up to heaven.</p>
<p>20:41
以色列人又转身回来，便雅悯人就甚惊惶，因为看见灾祸临到自己了。</p>
<p>And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were
amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</p>
<p>20:42
他们在以色列人面前转身往旷野逃跑。以色列人在后面追杀。那从各城里出来的，也都夹攻杀灭他们。</p>
<p>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the
way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came
out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</p>
<p>20:43
以色列人围绕便雅悯人，追赶他们，在他们歇脚之处，对着日出之地的基比亚践踏他们。</p>
<p>Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and
trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p>
<p>20:44 便雅悯人死了的有一万八千，都是勇士。</p>
<p>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men
of valour.</p>
<p>20:45
其馀的人转身向旷野逃跑，往临门磐去。以色列人在道路上杀了他们五千人，如拾取遗穗一样，追到基顿又杀了他们二千人。</p>
<p>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of
Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and
pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of
them.</p>
<p>20:46 那日便雅悯死了的共有二万五千人，都是拿刀的勇士。</p>
<p>So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five
thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.</p>
<p>20:47
只剩下六百人，转身向旷野逃跑，到了临门磐，就在那里住了四个月。</p>
<p>But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock
Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</p>
<p>20:48
以色列人又转到便雅悯地，将各城的人和牲畜，并一切所遇见的，都用刀杀尽，又放火烧了一切城邑。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and
smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as
the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the
cities that they came to.</p>
