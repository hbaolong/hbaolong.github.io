<h4 id="新约-马可福音mark-第-8-章-本篇共有-16-章">新约 – 马可福音(Mark)
– 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 16 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1 那时，又有许多人聚集，并没有什么吃的。耶稣叫门徒来，说，</p>
<p>In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to
eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them,</p>
<p>8:2 我怜悯这众人，因为他们同我在这里已经三天，也没有吃的了。</p>
<p>I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with
me three days, and have nothing to eat:</p>
<p>8:3 我若打发他们饿着回家，就必在路上困乏。因为其中有从远处来的。</p>
<p>And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint
by the way: for divers of them came from far.</p>
<p>8:4 门徒回答说，在这野地，从那里能得饼，叫这些人吃饱呢。</p>
<p>And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these
men with bread here in the wilderness?</p>
<p>8:5 耶稣问他们说，你们有多少饼。他们说，七个。</p>
<p>And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p>8:6
他吩咐众人坐在地上，就拿着这七个饼，祝谢了，擘开递给门徒叫他们摆开，门徒就摆在众人面前。</p>
<p>And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took
the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples
to set before them; and they did set them before the people.</p>
<p>8:7 又有几条小鱼。耶稣祝了福，就吩咐也摆在众人面前。</p>
<p>And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set
them also before them.</p>
<p>8:8 众人都吃，并且吃饱了。收拾剩下的零碎，有七筐子。</p>
<p>So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat
that was left seven baskets.</p>
<p>8:9 人数约有四千。耶稣打发他们走了，</p>
<p>And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them
away.</p>
<p>8:10 随既同门徒上船，来到大玛努他境内。</p>
<p>And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came
into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>
<p>8:11
法利赛人出来盘问耶稣，求他从天上显个神迹给他们看，想要试探他。</p>
<p>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking
of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p>
<p>8:12
耶稣心里深深的叹息说，这世代为什么求神迹呢。我实在告诉你们，没有神迹给这世代看。</p>
<p>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this
generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign
be given unto this generation.</p>
<p>8:13 他就离开他们，又上船往海那边去了。</p>
<p>And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the
other side.</p>
<p>8:14 门徒忘了带饼。在船上除了一个饼，没有别的食物。</p>
<p>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in
the ship with them more than one loaf.</p>
<p>8:15 耶稣嘱咐他们说，你们要谨慎，防备法利赛人的酵，和希律的酵。</p>
<p>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the
Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</p>
<p>8:16 他们彼此议论说，这是因为我们没有饼吧。</p>
<p>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no
bread.</p>
<p>8:17
耶稣看出来，就说，你们为什么因为没有饼就议论呢。你们还不省悟，还不明白吗。你们的心还是愚顽吗。</p>
<p>And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye, because ye
have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your
heart yet hardened?</p>
<p>8:18 你们有眼睛看不见吗，有耳朵，听不见吗。也不记得吗。</p>
<p>Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not
remember?</p>
<p>8:19
我擘开那五个饼分给五千人，你们收拾的零碎，装满了多少篮子呢。他们说，十二个。</p>
<p>When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets
full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him, Twelve.</p>
<p>8:20
又擘开那七个饼分给四千人，你们收拾的零碎，装满了多少筐子呢。他们说，七个。</p>
<p>And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of
fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p>
<p>8:21 耶稣说，你们还是不明白吗。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>
<p>8:22 他们来到伯赛大，有人带一个瞎子来，求耶稣摸他。</p>
<p>And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto him, and
besought him to touch him.</p>
<p>8:23
耶稣拉着瞎子的手，领他到村外。就吐唾沫在他眼睛上，按手在他身上，问他说，你看见什么了。</p>
<p>And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town;
and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked
him if he saw ought.</p>
<p>8:24 他就抬头一看说，我看见人了。他们好像树木，并且行走。</p>
<p>And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p>
<p>8:25
随后又按手在他眼睛上，他定睛一看，就复了原，样样都看得清楚了。</p>
<p>After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look
up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p>
<p>8:26 耶稣打发他回家，说，连这村子你也不要进去。</p>
<p>And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town,
nor tell it to any in the town.</p>
<p>8:27
耶稣和门徒出去，往凯撒利亚-腓立比的村庄去。在路上问门徒说，人说我是谁。</p>
<p>And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of Caesarea
Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Whom
do men say that I am?</p>
<p>8:28
他们说，有人说，是施洗的约翰。有人说，是以利亚。又有人说，是先知里的一位。</p>
<p>And they answered, John the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others,
One of the prophets.</p>
<p>8:29 又问他们说，你们说我是谁。彼得回答说，你是基督。</p>
<p>And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter
answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p>
<p>8:30 耶稣就禁戒他们，不要告诉人。</p>
<p>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>
<p>8:31
从此他教训他们说，人子必须受许多的苦，被长老祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，过三天复活。</p>
<p>And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and
scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</p>
<p>8:32 耶稣明明的说这话，彼得就拉着他，劝他。</p>
<p>And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to
rebuke him.</p>
<p>8:33
耶稣转过来，看着门徒，就责备彼得说，撒但，退我后边去吧。因为你不体贴神的意思，只体贴人的意思。</p>
<p>But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked
Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou savourest not the
things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</p>
<p>8:34
于是叫众人和门徒来，对他们说，若有人要跟从我，就当舍己，背起他的十字架来跟从我。</p>
<p>And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also,
he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>
<p>8:35
因为凡救自己生命的，（生命或作灵魂下同）必丧掉生命。凡为我和福音丧掉生命的，必救了生命。</p>
<p>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall
lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.</p>
<p>8:36 人就是赚得全世界，赔上自己的生命，有什么益处呢。</p>
<p>For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and
lose his own soul?</p>
<p>8:37 人还能拿什么换生命呢。</p>
<p>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>
<p>8:38
凡在这淫乱罪恶的世代，把我和我的道当作可耻的，人子在他父的荣耀里，同圣天使降临的时候，也要把那人当作可耻的。</p>
<p>Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this
adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be
ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy
angels.</p>
