<h4 id="旧约-以斯帖记esther-第-2-章-本篇共有-10-章">旧约 –
以斯帖记(Esther) – 第 2 章 ( 本篇共有 10 章 )</h4>
<p>2:1
这事以后，亚哈随鲁王的忿怒止息，就想念瓦实提和她所行的，并怎样降旨办她。</p>
<p>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he
remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against
her.</p>
<p>2:2 于是王的侍臣对王说，不如为王寻梢美貌的处女。</p>
<p>Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, Let there be
fair young virgins sought for the king:</p>
<p>2:3
王可以派官在国中的各省，招聚美貌的处女到书珊城（或作宫）的女院，交给掌管女子的太监希该，给她们当用的香品。</p>
<p>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto
Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege
the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for
purification be given them:</p>
<p>2:4
王所喜爱的女子可以立为王后，代替瓦实提。王以这事为美，就如此行。</p>
<p>And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>
<p>2:5
书珊城有一个犹大人，名叫末底改，是便雅悯人基士的曾孙，示每的孙子，睚珥的儿子。</p>
<p>Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was
Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a
Benjamite;</p>
<p>2:6
从前巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒，将犹大王耶哥尼雅（又名约雅斤）和百姓从耶路撒冷掳去，末底改也在其内。</p>
<p>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had
been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
king of Babylon had carried away.</p>
<p>2:7
末底改抚养他叔叔的女儿哈大沙（后名以斯帖），因为她没有父母。这女子又容貌俊美，她父母死了，末底改就收她为自己的女儿。</p>
<p>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter:
for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and
beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for
his own daughter.</p>
<p>2:8
王的谕旨传出，就招聚许多女子到书珊城，交给掌管女子的希该。以斯帖也送入王宫，交付希该。</p>
<p>So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was
heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the
palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the
king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>
<p>2:9
希该喜悦以斯帖，就恩待她。急忙给她需用的香品和她所当得的分，又派所当得的七个宫女服事她，使她和她的宫女搬入女院上好的房屋。</p>
<p>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him; and he
speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as
belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out
of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best
place of the house of the women.</p>
<p>2:10 以斯帖未曾将籍贯宗族告诉人，因为末底改嘱咐她不可叫人知道。</p>
<p>Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had
charged her that she should not shew it.</p>
<p>2:11
末底改天天在女院前边行走，要知道以斯帖平安不平安，并后事如何。</p>
<p>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house,
to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>
<p>2:12
众女子照例先洁净身体十二个月。六个月用没药油，六个月用香料和洁身之物。满了日期，然后挨次进去见亚哈随鲁王。</p>
<p>Now when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after
that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women,
(for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six
months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with
other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>
<p>2:13 女子进去见王是这样。从女院到王宫的时候，凡她所要的都必给她。</p>
<p>Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she desired was
given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s
house.</p>
<p>2:14
晚上进去，次日回到女子第二院，交给掌管妃嫔的太监沙甲。除非王喜爱她，再提名召她，就不再进去见王。</p>
<p>In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the
second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s
chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no
more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by
name.</p>
<p>2:15
末底改叔叔亚比孩的女儿，就是末底改收为自己女儿的以斯帖，按次序当进去见王的时候，除了掌管女子的太监希该所派定给她的，她别无所求。凡看见以斯帖的都喜悦她。</p>
<p>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of
Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the
king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the
keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight
of all them that looked upon her.</p>
<p>2:16 亚哈随鲁王第七年十月，就是提别月，以斯帖被引入宫见王。</p>
<p>So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the
tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his
reign.</p>
<p>2:17
王爱以斯帖过于爱众女，她在王眼前蒙宠爱比众处女更甚。王就把王后的冠冕戴在她头上，立她为王后，代替瓦实提。</p>
<p>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace
and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the
royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</p>
<p>2:18
王因以斯帖的缘故给众首领和臣仆设摆大筵席，又豁免各省的租税，并照王的厚意大颁赏赐。</p>
<p>Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces,
and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>
<p>2:19 第二次招聚处女的时候，末底改坐在朝门。</p>
<p>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then
Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</p>
<p>2:20
以斯帖照着末底改所嘱咐的，还没有将籍贯宗族告诉人。因为以斯帖遵末底改的命，如抚养她的时候一样。</p>
<p>Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had
charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when
she was brought up with him.</p>
<p>2:21
当那时候，末底改坐在朝门，王的太监中有两个守门的，辟探和提列，恼恨亚哈随鲁王，想要下手害他。</p>
<p>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the
king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door,
were wroth, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p>2:22
末底改知道了，就告诉王后以斯帖。以斯帖奉末底改的名，报告于王。</p>
<p>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther the
queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai’s name.</p>
<p>2:23
究察这事，果然是实，就把二人挂在木头上，将这事在王面前写于历史上。</p>
<p>And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the
book of the chronicles before the king.</p>
