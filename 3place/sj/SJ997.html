<h4 id="新约-路加福音luke-第-24-章-本篇共有-24-章">新约 – 路加福音(Luke)
– 第 24 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>24:1
七日的头一日，黎明的时候，那些妇女带着所豫备的香料，来到坟墓前。</p>
<p>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they
came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared,
and certain others with them.</p>
<p>24:2 看见石头已经从坟墓辊开了。</p>
<p>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
<p>24:3 他们就进去，只是不见主耶稣的身体。</p>
<p>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>24:4 正在猜疑之间，忽然有两个人站在旁边。衣服放光。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold,
two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
<p>24:5
妇女们惊怕，将脸伏地。那两个人就对他们说，为什么在死人中找活人呢。</p>
<p>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth,
they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
<p>24:6
他不在这里，已经复活了。当记念他还在加利利的时候，怎样告诉你们，</p>
<p>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he
was yet in Galilee,</p>
<p>24:7 说，人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。</p>
<p>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p>24:8 他们就想起耶稣的话来，</p>
<p>And they remembered his words,</p>
<p>24:9 便从坟墓那里回去，把这一切事告诉十一个使徒和其馀的人。</p>
<p>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the
eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p>24:10
那告诉使徒的，就是抹大拉的马利亚，和约亚拿，并雅各的母亲马利亚，还有与他们在一处的妇女。</p>
<p>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and
other women that were with them, which told these things unto the
apostles.</p>
<p>24:11 他们这些话，使徒以为是胡言，就不相信。</p>
<p>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them
not.</p>
<p>24:12
彼得起来，跑到坟墓前，低头往里看，见细麻布独在一处，就回去了，心里希奇所成的事。</p>
<p>Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he
beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in
himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p>24:13
正当那日，门徒中有两个人往一个村子去，这村子名叫以马忤斯，离耶路撒冷约有二十五里。</p>
<p>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</p>
<p>24:14 他们彼此谈论所遇见的这一切事。</p>
<p>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p>24:15 正谈论相问的时候，耶稣亲自就近他们，和他们同行。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned,
Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
<p>24:16 只是他们的眼睛迷糊了，不认识他。</p>
<p>But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
<p>24:17
耶稣对他们说，你们走路彼此谈论的是什么事呢。他们就站住，脸上带着愁容。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that
ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>
<p>24:18
二人中有一个名叫革流巴的，回答说，你在耶路撒冷作客，还不知道这几天在那里所出的事吗。</p>
<p>And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him,
Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things
which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
<p>24:19
耶稣说，什么事呢。他们说，就是拿撒勒人耶稣的事。他是个先知，在神和众百姓面前，说话行事都有大能。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and
word before God and all the people:</p>
<p>24:20 祭司长和我们的官府，竟把他解去定了死罪，钉在十字架上。</p>
<p>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
<p>24:21
但我们素来所盼望要赎以色列民的就是他。不但如此，而且这事成就，现在已经三天了。</p>
<p>But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel:
and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were
done.</p>
<p>24:22 再者，我们中间有几个妇女使我们惊奇，他们清早到了坟墓那里。</p>
<p>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which
were early at the sepulchre;</p>
<p>24:23 不见他的身体，就回来告诉我们说，看见了天使显现，说他活了。</p>
<p>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had
also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
<p>24:24
又有我们的几个人，往坟墓那里去，所遇见的，正如妇女们所说的，只是没有看见他。</p>
<p>And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and
found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p>24:25
耶稣对他们说，无知的人哪，先知所说的一切话，你们的心，信得太迟钝了。</p>
<p>Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all
that the prophets have spoken:</p>
<p>24:26 基督这样受害，又进入他的荣耀，岂不是应当的吗。</p>
<p>Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his
glory?</p>
<p>24:27
于是从摩西和众先知起，凡经上所指着自己的话，都给他们讲解明白了。</p>
<p>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them
in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p>24:28 将近他们所去的村子，耶稣好像还要往前行</p>
<p>And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made
as though he would have gone further.</p>
<p>24:29
他们却强留他说，时候晚了，日头已经平西了，请你同我住下吧。耶稣就进去，要同他们住下。</p>
<p>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward
evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with
them.</p>
<p>24:30 到了坐席的时候，耶稣拿起饼来，祝谢了，擘开，递给他们。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and
blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p>24:31 他们的眼睛明亮了，这才认出他来。忽然耶稣不见了。</p>
<p>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of
their sight.</p>
<p>24:32
他们彼此说，在路上，他和我们说话，给我们讲解圣经的时候，我们的心岂不是火热的吗。</p>
<p>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while
he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?</p>
<p>24:33
他们就立时起身，回耶路撒冷去，正遇见十一个使徒，和他们的同人，聚集在一处。</p>
<p>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found
the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
<p>24:34 说，主果然复活，已经现给西门看了。</p>
<p>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p>24:35
两个人就把路上所遇见，和擘饼的时候怎样被他们认出来的事，都述说了一遍。</p>
<p>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known
of them in breaking of bread.</p>
<p>24:36 正说这话的时候，耶稣亲自站在他们当中，说，愿你们平安。</p>
<p>And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p>24:37 他们却惊慌害怕，以为所看见的是魂。</p>
<p>But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had
seen a spirit.</p>
<p>24:38 耶稣说，你们为什么愁烦。为什么心里起疑念呢。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise
in your hearts?</p>
<p>24:39
你们看我的手，我的脚，就知道实在是我了。摸我看看。魂无骨无肉，你们看我是有的。</p>
<p>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see;
for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
<p>24:40 说了这话，就把手和脚给他们看。</p>
<p>And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
feet.</p>
<p>24:41
他们正喜得不敢信，并且希奇，耶稣就说，你们这里有什么吃的没有。</p>
<p>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto
them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
<p>24:42 他们便给他一片烧鱼。有古卷在此有和一块蜜房</p>
<p>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
<p>24:43 他接过来，在他们面前吃了。</p>
<p>And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p>24:44
耶稣对他们说，这就是我从前与你们同在之时，所告诉你们的话，说，摩西的律法，先知的书，和诗篇上所记的，凡指着我的话，都必须应验。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you,
while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were
written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms,
concerning me.</p>
<p>24:45 于是耶稣开他们的心窍，使他们能明白圣经。</p>
<p>Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
scriptures,</p>
<p>24:46 又对他们说，照经上所写的，基督必受害，第三日从死里复活。</p>
<p>And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to
suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
<p>24:47 并且人要奉他的名传悔改赦罪的道，从耶路撒冷起直传到万邦。</p>
<p>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>24:48 你们就是这些事的见证。</p>
<p>And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p>24:49
我要将我父所应许的降在你们身上。你们要在城里等候，直到你们领受从上头来的能力。</p>
<p>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye
in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on
high.</p>
<p>24:50 耶稣领他们到伯大尼的对面，就举手给他们祝福。</p>
<p>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands,
and blessed them.</p>
<p>24:51 正祝福的时候，他就离开他们，被带到天上去了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them,
and carried up into heaven.</p>
<p>24:52 他们就拜他，大大的欢喜，回耶路撒冷去。</p>
<p>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy:</p>
<p>24:53 常在殿里称颂神。</p>
<p>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
Amen.</p>
