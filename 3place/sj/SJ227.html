<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-16-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 16 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 参孙到了迦萨，在那里看见一个妓女，就与她亲近。</p>
<p>Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto
her.</p>
<p>16:2
有人告诉迦萨人说，参孙到这里来了。他们就把他团团围住，终夜在城门悄悄埋伏，说，等到天亮我们便杀他。</p>
<p>And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they
compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the
city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is
day, we shall kill him.</p>
<p>16:3
参孙睡到半夜，起来，将城门的门扇，门框，门闩，一齐拆下来，扛在肩上，扛到希伯仑前的山顶上。</p>
<p>And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the
doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with
them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them up
to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</p>
<p>16:4 后来参孙在梭烈谷喜爱一个妇人，名叫大利拉。</p>
<p>And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of
Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</p>
<p>16:5
非利士人的首领上去见那妇人，对她说，求你诓哄参孙，探探他因何有这吗大的力气，我们用何法能胜他，捆绑克制他。我们就每人给你一千一百舍客勒银子。</p>
<p>And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her,
Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what means
we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we
will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</p>
<p>16:6
大利拉对参孙说，求你告诉我，你因何有这吗大的力气，当用何法捆绑克制你。</p>
<p>And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great
strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict
thee.</p>
<p>16:7
参孙回答说，人若用七条未乾的青绳子捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。</p>
<p>And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that
were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
<p>16:8
于是非利士人的首领拿了七条未乾的青绳子来，交给妇人，她就用绳子捆绑参孙。</p>
<p>Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs
which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</p>
<p>16:9
有人预先埋伏在妇人的内室里。妇人说，参孙哪。非利士人拿你来了。参孙就挣断绳子，如挣断经火的麻线一般。这样，他力气的根由人还是不知道。</p>
<p>Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.
And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire.
So his strength was not known.</p>
<p>16:10
大利拉对参孙说，你欺哄我，向我说谎言。现在求你告诉我当用何法捆绑你。</p>
<p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound.</p>
<p>16:11
参孙回答说，人若用没有使过的新绳捆绑我，我就软弱像别人一样。</p>
<p>And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never
were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</p>
<p>16:12
大利拉就用新绳捆绑他。对他说，参孙哪。非利士人拿你来了。有人预先埋伏在内室里。参孙将臂上的绳挣断了，如挣断一条线一样。</p>
<p>Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said
unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were liers in
wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a
thread.</p>
<p>16:13
大利拉对参孙说，你到如今还是欺哄我，向我说谎言。求你告诉我，当用何法捆绑你。参孙回答说，你若将我头上的七条发绺，与纬线同织就可以了。</p>
<p>And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told
me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her,
If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</p>
<p>16:14
于是大利拉将他的发绺与纬线同织，用橛子钉住，对他说，参孙哪。非利士人拿你来了。参孙从睡中醒来，将机上的橛子和纬线一齐都拔出来了。</p>
<p>And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines
be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with
the pin of the beam, and with the web.</p>
<p>16:15
大利拉对参孙说，你既不与我同心，怎吗说你爱我呢。你这三次欺哄我，没有告诉我，你因何有这吗大的力气。</p>
<p>And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine
heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast
not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</p>
<p>16:16 大利拉天天用话催逼他，甚至他心里烦闷要死。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and
urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</p>
<p>16:17
参孙就把心中所藏的都告诉了她，对她说，向来人没有用剃头刀剃我的头，因为我自出母胎就归神作拿细耳人。若剃了我的头发，我的力气就离开我，我便软弱像别人一样。</p>
<p>That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not
come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my
mother’s womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I
shall become weak, and be like any other man.</p>
<p>16:18
大利拉见他把心中所藏的都告诉了她，就打发人到非利士人的首领那里，对他们说，他已经把心中所藏的都告诉了我，请你们再上来一次。于是非利士人的首领手里拿着银子，上到妇人那里。</p>
<p>And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and
called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for
he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came
up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</p>
<p>16:19
大利拉使参孙枕着她的膝睡觉，叫了一个人来剃除他头上的七条发绺。于是大利拉克制他，他的力气就离开他了。</p>
<p>And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and
she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began
to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</p>
<p>16:20
大利拉说，参孙哪。非利士人拿你来了。参孙从睡中醒来，心里说，我要像前几次出去活动身体。他却不知道耶和华已经离开他了。</p>
<p>And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out
of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and
shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</p>
<p>16:21
非利士人将他拿住，剜了他的眼睛，带他下到迦萨，用铜链拘索他。他就在监里推磨。</p>
<p>But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him
down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in
the prison house.</p>
<p>16:22 然而他的头发被剃之后，又渐渐长起来了。</p>
<p>Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
shaven.</p>
<p>16:23
非利士人的首领聚集，要给他们的神大衮献大祭，并且欢乐，因为他们说，我们的神将我们的仇敌参孙交在我们手中了。</p>
<p>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer
a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said,
Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</p>
<p>16:24
众人看见参孙，就赞美他们的神说，我们的神将毁坏我们地，杀害我们许多人的仇敌交在我们手中了。</p>
<p>And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said,
Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of
our country, which slew many of us.</p>
<p>16:25
他们正宴乐的时候，就说，叫参孙来，在我们面前戏耍戏耍。于是将参孙从监里提出来，他就在众人面前戏耍。他们使他站在两柱中间。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said,
Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson
out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him
between the pillars.</p>
<p>16:26 参孙向拉他手的童子说，求你让我摸着托房的柱子，我要靠一靠。</p>
<p>And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me
that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may
lean upon them.</p>
<p>16:27
那时房内充满男女，非利士人的众首领也都在那里。房的平顶上约有三千男女，观看参孙戏耍。</p>
<p>Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the
Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three
thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</p>
<p>16:28
参孙求告耶和华说，主耶和华阿，求你眷念我。神阿，求你赐我这一次的力量，使我在非利士人身上报那剜我双眼的仇。</p>
<p>And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember me, I
pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I
may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</p>
<p>16:29 参孙就抱住托房的那两根柱子，左手抱一根，右手抱一根，</p>
<p>And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house
stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and
of the other with his left.</p>
<p>16:30
说，我情愿与非利士人同死。就尽力屈身，房子倒塌，压住首领和房内的众人。这样，参孙死时所杀的人，比活着所杀的还多。</p>
<p>And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon
all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at his death
were more than they which he slew in his life.</p>
<p>16:31
参孙的弟兄和他父的全家，都下去取他的尸首，抬上来葬在琐拉和以实陶中间，在他父玛挪亚的坟墓里。参孙作以色列的士师二十年。</p>
<p>Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took
him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the
buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty
years.</p>
