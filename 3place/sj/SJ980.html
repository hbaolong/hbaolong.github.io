<h4 id="新约-路加福音luke-第-7-章-本篇共有-24-章">新约 – 路加福音(Luke)
– 第 7 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 耶稣对百姓讲完了这一切的话，就进了迦百农。</p>
<p>Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,
he entered into Capernaum.</p>
<p>7:2 有一个百夫长所宝贵的仆人，害病快要死了。</p>
<p>And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick,
and ready to die.</p>
<p>7:3
百夫长风闻耶稣的事，就托犹太人的几个长老，去求耶稣来救他的仆人。</p>
<p>And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews,
beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
<p>7:4
他们到了耶稣那里，就切切的求他说，你给他行这事，是他所配得的。</p>
<p>And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
<p>7:5 因为他爱我们的百姓，给我们建造会堂。</p>
<p>For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
<p>7:6
耶稣就和他们同去。离那家不远，百夫长托几个朋友去见耶稣，对他说，主阿，不要劳动。因你到我舍下，我不敢当。</p>
<p>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble
not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my
roof:</p>
<p>7:7 我也自以为不配去见你，只要你说一句话，我的仆人就必好了。</p>
<p>Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say
in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p>7:8
因为我在人的权下，也有兵在我以下，对这个说去，他就去。对那个说来，他就来。对我的仆人说，你作这事，他就去作。</p>
<p>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he
cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
<p>7:9
耶稣听见这话，就希奇他，转身对跟随的众人说，我告诉你们，这吗大的信心，就是在以色列中我也没有遇见过。</p>
<p>When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I
have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
<p>7:10 那托来的人回到百夫长家里，看见仆人已经好了。</p>
<p>And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant
whole that had been sick.</p>
<p>7:11
过不了多时，有古卷作次日耶稣往一座城去，这城名叫拿因，他的门徒和极多的人与他同行。</p>
<p>And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called
Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
<p>7:12
将近城门，有一个死人被抬出来。这人是他母亲独生的儿子，他母亲又是寡妇。有城里的许多人同着寡妇送殡。</p>
<p>Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a
dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow:
and much people of the city was with her.</p>
<p>7:13 主看见那寡妇就怜悯他，对他说，不要哭。</p>
<p>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto
her, Weep not.</p>
<p>7:14
于是进前按着杠，抬的人就站住了。耶稣说，少年人，我吩咐你起来。</p>
<p>And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still.
And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
<p>7:15 那死人就坐起，并且说话。耶稣便把他交给他母亲。</p>
<p>And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him
to his mother.</p>
<p>7:16
众人都惊奇，归荣耀与神说，有大先知在我们中间兴起来了。又说，神眷顾了他的百姓。</p>
<p>And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a
great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his
people.</p>
<p>7:17 他这事的风声就传遍了犹太，和周围地方。</p>
<p>And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and
throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p>7:18 约翰的门徒把这些事都告诉约翰。</p>
<p>And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
<p>7:19
他便叫了两个门徒来，打发他们到主那里去，说，那将要来的是你吗，还是我们等候别人呢。</p>
<p>And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus,
saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p>7:20
那两个人来到耶稣那里，说，施洗的约翰打发我们来问你，那将要来的是你吗，还是我们等候别人呢。</p>
<p>When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us
unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
another?</p>
<p>7:21
正当那时候，耶稣治好了许多有疾病的，受灾患的，被恶鬼附着的。又开恩叫好些瞎子能看见。</p>
<p>And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues,
and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight.</p>
<p>7:22
耶稣回答说，你们去把所看见所听见的事告诉约翰。就是瞎子看见，瘸子行走，长大麻疯的洁净，聋子听见，死人复活，穷人有福音传给他们。</p>
<p>Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what
things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk,
the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor
the gospel is preached.</p>
<p>7:23 凡不因我跌倒的，就有福了。</p>
<p>And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p>7:24
约翰所差来的人既走了，耶稣就对众人讲论约翰说，你们从前出去到旷野，是要看什么呢。要看风吹动的芦苇吗。</p>
<p>And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto
the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to
see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
<p>7:25
你们出去到底是要看什么。要看穿细软衣服的人吗。那穿华丽衣服宴乐度日的人，是在王宫里。</p>
<p>But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are
in kings’ courts.</p>
<p>7:26
你们出去究竟是要看什么。要看先知吗。我告诉你们，是的，他比先知大多了。</p>
<p>But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and
much more than a prophet.</p>
<p>7:27
经上记着说，我要差遣我的使者在你前面，豫备道路。所说的就是这个人。</p>
<p>This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before
thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p>7:28
我告诉你们，凡妇人所生的，没有一个大过约翰的。然而神国里最小的比他还大。</p>
<p>For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a
greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the
kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p>7:29 众百姓和税吏，既受过约翰的洗，听见这话，就以神为义。</p>
<p>And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God,
being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
<p>7:30
但法利赛人和律法师，没有受过约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。二十九三十两节或作众百姓和税吏听见了约翰的话就受了他的洗便以神为义但法利赛人和律法师不受约翰的洗，竟为自己废弃了神的旨意。</p>
<p>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
<p>7:31 主又说，这样，我可用什么比这世代的人呢。他们好像什么呢。</p>
<p>And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation? and to what are they like?</p>
<p>7:32
好像孩童坐在街市上，彼此呼叫说，我们向你们吹笛，你们不跳舞，我们向你们举哀，你们不啼哭。</p>
<p>They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling
one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not
danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
<p>7:33 施洗的约翰来，不吃饼，不喝酒。你们说他是被鬼附着的。</p>
<p>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and
ye say, He hath a devil.</p>
<p>7:34
人子来，也吃也喝。你们说他是贪食好酒的人，是税吏和罪人的朋友。</p>
<p>The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>
<p>7:35 但智慧之子，都以智慧为是。</p>
<p>But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
<p>7:36 有一个法利赛人，请耶稣和他吃饭。耶稣就到法利赛人家里去坐席。</p>
<p>And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And
he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</p>
<p>7:37
那城里有一个女人，是个罪人。知道耶稣在法利赛人家里坐席，就拿着盛香膏的玉瓶，</p>
<p>And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew
that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box
of ointment,</p>
<p>7:38
站在耶稣背后，挨着他的脚哭，眼泪湿了耶稣的脚，就用自己的头发擦乾，又用嘴连连亲他的脚，把香膏抹上。</p>
<p>And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his
feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</p>
<p>7:39
请耶稣的法利赛人看见这事，心里说，这人若是先知，必知道摸他的是谁，是个怎样的女人，乃是个罪人。</p>
<p>Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within
himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who
and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a
sinner.</p>
<p>7:40 耶稣对他说，西门，我有句话要对你说。西门说，夫子，请说。</p>
<p>And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto
thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
<p>7:41
耶稣说，一个债主，有两个人欠他的债。一个欠他五十两银子，一个欠五两银子。</p>
<p>There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five
hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
<p>7:42
因为他们无力偿还，债主就开恩免了他们两个人的债。这两个人那一个更爱他呢。</p>
<p>And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell
me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
<p>7:43 西门回答说，我想是那多得恩免的人。耶稣说，你断的不错。</p>
<p>Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most.
And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p>7:44
于是转过来向着那女人，便对西门说，你看见这女人吗。我进了你的家，你没有给我水洗脚。但这女人用眼泪湿了我的脚，用头发擦乾。</p>
<p>And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet:
but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of
her head.</p>
<p>7:45
你没有与我亲嘴，但这女人从我进来的时候，就不住的用嘴亲我的脚。</p>
<p>Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath
not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
<p>7:46 你没有用油抹我的头，但这女人用香膏抹我的脚。</p>
<p>My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed
my feet with ointment.</p>
<p>7:47
所以我告诉你，他许多的罪都赦免了。因为他的爱多。但那赦免少的，他的爱就少。</p>
<p>Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth
little.</p>
<p>7:48 于是对那女人说，你的罪赦免了。</p>
<p>And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
<p>7:49 同席的人心里说，这是什么人，竟赦免人的罪呢。</p>
<p>And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves,
Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
<p>7:50 耶稣对那女人说，你的信救了你，平平安安的回去吧。</p>
<p>And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
