<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-10-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 10 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 在凯撒利亚有一个人，名叫哥尼流，是意大利营的百夫长。</p>
<p>There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of
the band called the Italian band,</p>
<p>10:2
他是个虔诚人，他和全家都敬畏）神，多多周济百姓，常常祷告）神。</p>
<p>A devout man, and one that feared God with all his house, which gave
much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.</p>
<p>10:3
有一天，约在申初，他在异象中，明明看见神的一个使者进去，到他那里，说，哥尼流。</p>
<p>He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel
of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</p>
<p>10:4
哥尼流定睛看他，惊怕说，主阿，什么事呢。天使说，你的祷告，和你的周济，达到神面前已蒙记念了。</p>
<p>And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord?
And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a
memorial before God.</p>
<p>10:5 现在你打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来。</p>
<p>And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is
Peter:</p>
<p>10:6 他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。房子在海边上。</p>
<p>He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side:
he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</p>
<p>10:7
向他说话的天使去后，哥尼流叫了两个家人，和常伺候他的一个虔诚兵来。</p>
<p>And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called
two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited
on him continually;</p>
<p>10:8 把这事都述说给他们听，就打发他们往约帕去。</p>
<p>And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to
Joppa.</p>
<p>10:9 第二天，他们行路将近那城，彼得约在午正，上房顶去祷告。</p>
<p>On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the
city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:</p>
<p>10:10 觉得饿了，想要吃。那家的人正豫备饭的时候，彼得魂游象外。</p>
<p>And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made
ready, he fell into a trance,</p>
<p>10:11 看见天开了，有一物降下，好像一块大布。系着四角，槌在地上。</p>
<p>And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending unto him, as
it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the
earth:</p>
<p>10:12 里面有地上各样四足的走兽，和昆虫，并天上的飞鸟。</p>
<p>Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild
beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</p>
<p>10:13 又有声音向他说，彼得起来，宰了吃。</p>
<p>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</p>
<p>10:14
彼得却说，主阿，这是不可的，凡俗物，和不洁净的物，我从来没有吃过。</p>
<p>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that
is common or unclean.</p>
<p>10:15 第二次有声音向他说，神所洁净的，你不可当作俗物。</p>
<p>And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath
cleansed, that call not thou common.</p>
<p>10:16 这样一连三次，那物随既收回天上去了。</p>
<p>This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into
heaven.</p>
<p>10:17
彼得心里正在猜疑之间，不知所看见的异象是什么意思，哥尼流所差来的人，已经访问到西门的家，站在门外，</p>
<p>Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen
should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made
enquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,</p>
<p>10:18 喊着问，有称呼彼得的西门住在这里没有。</p>
<p>And called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were
lodged there.</p>
<p>10:19 彼得还思想那异象的时候，圣灵向他说，有三个人来找你。</p>
<p>While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold,
three men seek thee.</p>
<p>10:20 起来，下去，和他们同往，不要疑惑。因为是我差他们来的。</p>
<p>Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting
nothing: for I have sent them.</p>
<p>10:21
于是彼得下去见那些人，说，我就是你们所找的人。你们来是为什么缘故。</p>
<p>Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from
Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause
wherefore ye are come?</p>
<p>10:22
他们说，百夫长哥尼流是个义人，敬畏神，为犹太通国所称赞，他蒙一位圣天使指示，叫他请你到他家里去，听你的话。</p>
<p>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that
feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was
warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to
hear words of thee.</p>
<p>10:23 彼得请他们进去，住了一宿。</p>
<p>Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went
away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</p>
<p>10:24
次日起身和他们同去，还有约帕的几个弟兄同着他去。又次日，他们进入凯撒利亚。哥尼流已经请了他的亲属密友，等候他们。</p>
<p>And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited
for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.</p>
<p>10:25 彼得一进去，哥尼流就迎接他，俯伏在他脚前拜他。</p>
<p>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his
feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p>10:26 彼得却拉他说，我也是人。</p>
<p>But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</p>
<p>10:27 彼得和他说着话进去，见有好些人在那里聚集，</p>
<p>And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come
together.</p>
<p>10:28
就对他们说，你们知道犹太人，和别国的人亲近往来，本是不合例的。但神已经指示我，无论什么人，都不能看作俗而不洁净的。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a
man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation;
but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or
unclean.</p>
<p>10:29
所已我被请的时候，就不推辞而来。现在请问，你们叫我来有什么意思呢。</p>
<p>Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent
for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?</p>
<p>10:30
哥尼流说，前四天这个时候，我在家中守着申初的祷告，忽然有一个人，穿着光明的衣裳，站在我面前，</p>
<p>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and
at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before
me in bright clothing,</p>
<p>10:31
说，哥尼流，你的祷告，已蒙垂听，你的周济，达到神面前已蒙记念了。</p>
<p>And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in
remembrance in the sight of God.</p>
<p>10:32
你当打发人往约帕去，请那称呼彼得的西门来，他住在海边一个硝皮匠西门的家里。</p>
<p>Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is
Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side:
who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</p>
<p>10:33
所以我立时打发人去请你，你来了很好。现在我们都在神面前，要听主所吩咐你的一切话。</p>
<p>Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that
thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear
all things that are commanded thee of God.</p>
<p>10:34 彼得就开口说，我真看出神是不偏待人。</p>
<p>Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons:</p>
<p>10:35 原来各国中，那敬畏主行义的人，都为主所悦纳。</p>
<p>But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness,
is accepted with him.</p>
<p>10:36
神藉着耶稣基督（他是万有的主）传和平的福音，将这道赐给以色列人。</p>
<p>The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace
by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)</p>
<p>10:37 这话在约翰宣传洗礼以后，所加利利起，传遍了犹太。</p>
<p>That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea,
and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</p>
<p>10:38
神怎样以圣灵和能力，膏拿撒勒人耶稣，这都是你们知道的。他周流四方行善事，医好凡被魔鬼压制的人。因为神与他同在。</p>
<p>How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of
the devil; for God was with him.</p>
<p>10:39
他在犹太人之地，并耶路撒冷，所行的一切事，有我们作见证。他们把他挂在木头上杀了。</p>
<p>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of
the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</p>
<p>10:40 第三日神叫他复活，显现出来，</p>
<p>Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;</p>
<p>10:41
不是显给众人看，乃是显给神豫先所拣选为他作见证的人看，就是我们这些在他从死里复活以后，和他同吃同喝的人。</p>
<p>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even
to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</p>
<p>10:42
他吩咐我们传道给众人，证明他是神所立定的，要作审判活人死人的主。</p>
<p>And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it
is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.</p>
<p>10:43 众先知也为他作见证，说，凡信他的人，必因他的名，得蒙赦罪。</p>
<p>To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever
believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</p>
<p>10:44 彼得还说这话的时候，圣灵降在一切听道的人身上。</p>
<p>While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them
which heard the word.</p>
<p>10:45
那些奉割礼和彼得同来的信徒，见圣灵的恩赐也浇在外邦人身上，就都希奇。</p>
<p>And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many
as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the
gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>10:46 因听见他们说方言，称赞神为大。</p>
<p>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then
answered Peter,</p>
<p>10:47
于是彼得说，这些人既受了圣灵，与我们一样，谁能禁止用水给他们施洗呢。</p>
<p>Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which
have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?</p>
<p>10:48 就吩咐奉耶稣基督的名给他们施洗。他们又请彼得住了几天。</p>
<p>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then
prayed they him to tarry certain days.</p>
