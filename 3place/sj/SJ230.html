<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-19-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 19 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>19:1
当以色列中没有王的时候，有住以法莲山地那边的一个利未人，娶了一个犹大伯利恒的女子为妾。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel,
that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim,
who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.</p>
<p>19:2 妾行淫离开丈夫，回犹大的伯利恒，到了父家，在那里住了四个月。</p>
<p>And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from
him unto her father’s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole
months.</p>
<p>19:3
她丈夫起来，带着一个仆人，两匹驴去见她，用好话劝她回来。女子就引丈夫进入父家。她父见了那人，便欢欢喜喜地迎接。</p>
<p>And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto
her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple
of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the
father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</p>
<p>19:4
那人的岳父，就是女子的父亲，将那人留下住了三天。于是二人一同吃喝，住宿。</p>
<p>And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged
there.</p>
<p>19:5
到第四天，利未人清早起来要走，女子的父亲对女婿说，请你吃点饭，加添心力，然后可以行路。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the
morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said unto
his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and
afterward go your way.</p>
<p>19:6
于是二人坐下一同吃喝。女子的父亲对那人说，请你再住一夜，畅快你的心。</p>
<p>And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for
the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and
tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.</p>
<p>19:7 那人起来要走，他岳父强留他，他又住了一宿。</p>
<p>And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
therefore he lodged there again.</p>
<p>19:8
到第五天，他清早起来要走，女子的父亲说，请你吃点饭，加添心力，等到日头偏西再走。于是二人一同吃饭。</p>
<p>And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the
damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried
until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</p>
<p>19:9
那人同他的妾和仆人起来要走，他岳父，就是女子的父亲，对他说，看哪，日头偏西了，请你再住一夜。天快晚了，可以在这里住宿，畅快你的心。明天早早起行回家去。</p>
<p>And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his
servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold,
now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold,
the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry;
and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home.</p>
<p>19:10
那人不愿再住一夜，就备上那两匹驴，带着妾起身走了，来到耶布斯的对面，耶布斯就是耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed,
and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there were with him
two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</p>
<p>19:11
临近耶布斯的时候，日头快要落了，仆人对主人说，我们不如进这耶布斯人的城里住宿。</p>
<p>And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant
said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this
city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</p>
<p>19:12
主人回答说，我们不可进不是以色列人住的外邦城，不如过到基比亚去。</p>
<p>And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the
city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will pass
over to Gibeah.</p>
<p>19:13 又对仆人说，我们可以到一个地方，或住在基比亚，或住在拉玛。</p>
<p>And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of
these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</p>
<p>19:14 他们就往前走。将到便雅悯的基比亚，日头已经落了。</p>
<p>And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon
them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</p>
<p>19:15
他们进入基比亚要在那里住宿，就坐在城里的街上，因为无人接他们进家住宿。</p>
<p>And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah: and
when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there was
no man that took them into his house to lodging.</p>
<p>19:16
晚上，有一个老年人从田间作工回来。他原是以法莲山地的人，住在基比亚。那地方的人却是便雅悯人。</p>
<p>And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at
even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but
the men of the place were Benjamites.</p>
<p>19:17
老年人举目看见客人坐在城里的街上，就问他说，你从哪里来。要往哪里去。</p>
<p>And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the
street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence
comest thou?</p>
<p>19:18
他回答说，我们从犹大的伯利恒来，要往以法莲山地那边去。我原是那里的人，到过犹大的伯利恒，现在我往耶和华的殿去，在这里无人接我进他的家。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the
side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah,
but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there is no man that
receiveth me to house.</p>
<p>19:19
其实我有粮草可以喂驴，我与我的妾，并我的仆人，有饼有酒，并不缺少什么。</p>
<p>Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is
bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man
which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.</p>
<p>19:20
老年人说，愿你平安。你所需用的我都给你，只是不可在街上过夜。</p>
<p>And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy wants
lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</p>
<p>19:21 于是领他们到家里，喂上驴，他们就洗脚吃喝。</p>
<p>So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses:
and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</p>
<p>19:22
他们心里正欢畅的时候，城中的匪徒围住房子，连连叩门，对房主老人说，你把那进你家的人带出来，我们要与他交合。</p>
<p>Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the
city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat at
the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying,
Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know
him.</p>
<p>19:23
那房主出来对他们说，弟兄们哪，不要这样作恶。这人既然进了我的家，你们就不要行这丑事。</p>
<p>And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said
unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly; seeing
that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.</p>
<p>19:24
我有个女儿，还是处女，并有这人的妾，我将她们领出来任凭你们玷辱她们，只是向这人不可行这样的丑事。</p>
<p>Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will
bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good
unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</p>
<p>19:25
那些人却不听从他的话。那人就把他的妾拉出去交给他们，他们便与她交合，终夜凌辱她，直到天色快亮才放她去。</p>
<p>But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine,
and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all
the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let
her go.</p>
<p>19:26
天快亮的时候，妇人回到她主人住宿的房门前，就仆倒在地，直到天亮。</p>
<p>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the
door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.</p>
<p>19:27
早晨，她的主人起来开了房门，出去要行路，不料那妇人仆倒在房门前，两手搭在门槛上。</p>
<p>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the
house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine
was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>19:28
就对妇人说，起来，我们走吧。妇人却不回答。那人便将她驮在驴上，起身回本处去了。</p>
<p>And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered.
Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him
unto his place.</p>
<p>19:29
到了家里，用刀将妾的尸身切成十二块，使人拿着传送以色列的四境。</p>
<p>And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold
on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve
pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</p>
<p>19:30
凡看见的人都说，从以色列人出埃及地，直到今日，这样的事没有行过，也没有见过。现在应当思想，大家商议当怎样办理。</p>
<p>And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done
nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the
land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak your
minds.</p>
