<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-33-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 33 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>33:1 玛拿西登基的时候年十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十五年。</p>
<p>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
fifty and five years in Jerusalem:</p>
<p>33:2
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人那可憎的事，</p>
<p>But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the
abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>33:3
重新建筑他父希西家所拆毁的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，作木偶，且敬拜事奉天上的万象，</p>
<p>For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and
worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</p>
<p>33:4
在耶和华的殿宇中筑坛耶和华曾指着这殿说，我的名必永远在耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had
said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.</p>
<p>33:5 他在耶和华殿的两院中为天上的万象筑坛，</p>
<p>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of
the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>33:6
并在欣嫩子谷使他的儿女经火，又观兆，用法术，行邪术，立交鬼的和行巫术的，多行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气，</p>
<p>And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of
the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and
used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he
wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</p>
<p>33:7
又在神殿内立雕刻的偶像。神曾对大卫和他儿子所罗门说，我在以色列各支派中所选择的耶路撒冷和这殿，必立我的名直到永远。</p>
<p>And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house
of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this
house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of
Israel, will I put my name for ever:</p>
<p>33:8
以色列人若谨守遵行我藉摩西所吩咐他们的一切法度，律例，典章，我就不再使他们挪移离开我所赐给他们列祖之地。</p>
<p>Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the
land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take
heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law
and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p>33:9
玛拿西引诱犹大和耶路撒冷的居民，以致他们行恶比耶和华在以色列人面前所灭的列国更甚。</p>
<p>So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, and
to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>33:10 耶和华警戒玛拿西和他的百姓，他们却是不听。</p>
<p>And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not
hearken.</p>
<p>33:11
所以耶和华使亚述王的将帅来攻击他们，用铙钩钩住玛拿西，用铜链锁住他，带到巴比伦去。</p>
<p>Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the
king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him
with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</p>
<p>33:12
他在急难的时候，就恳求耶和华他的神，且在他列祖的神面前极其自卑。</p>
<p>And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and
humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</p>
<p>33:13
他祈祷耶和华，耶和华就允准他的祈求，垂听他的祷告，使他归回耶路撒冷，仍坐国位。玛拿西这才知道惟独耶和华是神。</p>
<p>And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his
supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then
Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.</p>
<p>33:14
此后，玛拿西在大卫城外，从谷内基训西边直到鱼门口，建筑城墙，环绕俄斐勒，这墙筑得甚高。又在犹大各坚固城内设立勇敢的军长。</p>
<p>Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west
side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate,
and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put
captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.</p>
<p>33:15
并除掉外邦人的神像与耶和华殿中的偶像，又将他在耶和华殿的山上和耶路撒冷所筑的各坛都拆毁抛在城外。</p>
<p>And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of
the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house
of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.</p>
<p>33:16
重修耶和华的祭坛，在坛上献平安祭，感谢祭，吩咐犹大人事奉耶和华以色列的神。</p>
<p>And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace
offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God
of Israel.</p>
<p>33:17 百姓却仍在邱坛上献祭，只献给耶和华他们的神。</p>
<p>Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet
unto the LORD their God only.</p>
<p>33:18
玛拿西其馀的事和祷告他神的话，并先见奉耶和华以色列神的名警戒他的言语，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God,
and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God
of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of
Israel.</p>
<p>33:19
他的祷告，与神怎样应允他，他未自卑以前的罪愆过犯，并在何处建筑邱坛，设立亚舍拉和雕刻的偶像，都写在何赛的书上。</p>
<p>His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins,
and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set
up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are
written among the sayings of the seers.</p>
<p>33:20
玛拿西与他列祖同睡，葬在自己的宫院里。他儿子亚们接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own
house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>33:21 亚们登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王二年。</p>
<p>Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned
two years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>33:22
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法他父玛拿西所行的，祭祀事奉他父玛拿西所雕刻的偶像，</p>
<p>But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did
Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images
which Manasseh his father had made, and served them;</p>
<p>33:23 不在耶和华面前像他父玛拿西自卑。这亚们所犯的罪越犯越大。</p>
<p>And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had
humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.</p>
<p>33:24 他的臣仆背叛，在宫里杀了他。</p>
<p>And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own
house.</p>
<p>33:25 但国民杀了那些背叛亚们王的人，立他儿子约西亚接续他作王。</p>
<p>But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his
stead.</p>
