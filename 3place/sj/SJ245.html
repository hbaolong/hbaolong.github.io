<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-9-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 9 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>9:1
有一个便雅悯人，名叫基士，是便雅悯人亚斐亚的玄孙，比歌拉的曾孙，洗罗的孙子，亚别的儿子，是个大能的勇士（或作大财主）。</p>
<p>Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of
Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a
Benjamite, a mighty man of power.</p>
<p>9:2
他有一个儿子，名叫扫罗，又健壮，又俊美，在以色列人中没有一个能比他的。身体比众民高过一头。</p>
<p>And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a
goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person
than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the
people.</p>
<p>9:3
扫罗的父亲基士丢了几头驴，他就吩咐儿子扫罗说，你带一个仆人去寻梢驴。</p>
<p>And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul
his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the
asses.</p>
<p>9:4
扫罗就走过以法莲山地，又过沙利沙地，都没有找着。又过沙琳地，驴也不在那里。又过便雅悯地，还没有找着。</p>
<p>And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of
Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of
Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the
Benjamites, but they found them not.</p>
<p>9:5
到了苏弗地，扫罗对跟随他的仆人说，我们不如回去，恐怕我父亲不为驴挂心，反为我们担忧。</p>
<p>And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant
that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring
for the asses, and take thought for us.</p>
<p>9:6
仆人说，这城里有一位神人，是众人所尊重的，凡他所说的全都应验。我们不如往他那里去，或者他能将我们当走的路指示我们。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God,
and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass:
now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we
should go.</p>
<p>9:7
扫罗对仆人说，我们若去，有什么可以送那人呢。我们囊中的食物都吃尽了，也没有礼物可以送那神人，我们还有什么没有。</p>
<p>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we
bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a
present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>
<p>9:8
仆人回答扫罗说，我手里有银子一舍客勒的四分之一，可以送那神人，请他指示我们当走的路。</p>
<p>And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at
hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man
of God, to tell us our way.</p>
<p>9:9
（从前以色列中，若有人去问神，就说，我们问先见去吧。现在称为先知的，从前称为先见。）</p>
<p>(Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he
spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a
Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>
<p>9:10
扫罗对仆人说，你说的是，我们可以去。于是他们往神人所住的城里去了。</p>
<p>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they
went unto the city where the man of God was.</p>
<p>9:11
他们上坡要进城，就遇见几个少年女子出来打水，问她们说，先见在这里没有。</p>
<p>And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens
going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</p>
<p>9:12
女子回答说，在这里，他在你们前面。快去吧。他今日正到城里，因为今日百姓要在邱坛献祭。</p>
<p>And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you:
make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice
of the people to day in the high place:</p>
<p>9:13
在他还没有上邱坛吃祭物之先，你们一进城必遇见他。因他未到，百姓不能吃，必等他先祝祭，然后请的客才吃。现在你们上去，这时候必遇见他。</p>
<p>As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him,
before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat
until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they
eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye
shall find him.</p>
<p>9:14 二人就上去。将进城的时候，撒母耳正迎着他们来，要上邱坛去。</p>
<p>And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the
city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high
place.</p>
<p>9:15 扫罗未到的前一日，耶和华已经指示撒母耳说，</p>
<p>Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came,
saying,</p>
<p>9:16
明日这时候，我必使一个人从便雅悯地到你这里来，你要膏他作我民以色列的君。他必救我民脱离非利士人的手。因我民的哀声上达于我，我就眷顾他们。</p>
<p>To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of
Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel,
that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I
have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>
<p>9:17
撒母耳看见扫罗的时候，耶和华对他说，看哪，这人就是我对你所说的，他必治理我的民。</p>
<p>And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom
I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people.</p>
<p>9:18 扫罗在城门里走到撒母耳跟前，说，请告诉我，先见的寓所在哪里。</p>
<p>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray
thee, where the seer’s house is.</p>
<p>9:19
撒母耳回答说，我就是先见。你在我前面上邱坛去，因为你们今日必与我同席。明日早晨我送你去，将你心里的事都告诉你。</p>
<p>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me
unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I
will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</p>
<p>9:20
至于你前三日所丢的那几头驴，你心里不必挂念，已经找着了。以色列众人所仰慕的是谁呢。不是仰慕你和你父的全家吗。</p>
<p>And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy
mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of
Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?</p>
<p>9:21
扫罗说，我不是以色列支派中至小的便雅悯人吗。我家不是便雅悯支派中至小的家吗。你为何对我说这样的话呢。</p>
<p>And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of
the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the
tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>
<p>9:22
撒母耳领扫罗和他仆人进了客堂，使他们在请来的客中坐首位。客约有三十个人。</p>
<p>And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the
parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were
bidden, which were about thirty persons.</p>
<p>9:23 撒母耳对厨役说，我交给你收存的那一分祭肉现在可以拿来。</p>
<p>And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee,
of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</p>
<p>9:24
厨役就把收存的腿拿来，摆在扫罗面前，撒母耳说，这是所留下的，放在你面前。吃吧。因我请百姓的时候，特意为你存留这肉到此时。当日，扫罗就与撒母耳同席。</p>
<p>And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and
set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it
before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee
since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel
that day.</p>
<p>9:25 众人从邱坛下来进城，撒母耳和扫罗在房顶上说话。</p>
<p>And when they were come down from the high place into the city,
Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p>
<p>9:26
次日清早起来，黎明的时候，扫罗在房顶上。撒母耳呼叫他说，起来吧，我好送你回去。扫罗就起来，和撒母耳一同出去。</p>
<p>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the
day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I
may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he
and Samuel, abroad.</p>
<p>9:27
二人下到城角，撒母耳对扫罗说，要吩咐仆人先走（仆人就先走了）。你且站在这里，等我将神的话传与你听。</p>
<p>And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to
Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand
thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>
