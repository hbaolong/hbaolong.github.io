<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记下2-samuel-第-12-章-本篇共有-24-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记下(2 Samuel) – 第 12 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>12:1
耶和华差遣拿单去见大卫。拿单到了大卫那里，对他说，在一座城里有两个人，一个是富户，一个是穷人。</p>
<p>And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said
unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
poor.</p>
<p>12:2 富户有许多牛群羊群。</p>
<p>The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
<p>12:3
穷人除了所买来养活的一只小母羊羔之外，别无所有。羊羔在他家里和他儿女一同长大，吃他所吃的，喝他所喝的，睡在他怀中，在他看来如同女儿一样。</p>
<p>But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had
bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his
children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay
in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
<p>12:4
有一客人来到这富户家里。富户舍不得从自己的牛群羊群中取一只预备给客人吃，却取了那穷人的羊羔，预备给客人吃。</p>
<p>And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take
of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man
that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it for
the man that was come to him.</p>
<p>12:5
大卫就甚恼怒那人，对拿单说，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，行这事的人该死。</p>
<p>And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to
Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall
surely die:</p>
<p>12:6 他必偿还羊羔四倍。因为他行这事，没有怜恤的心。</p>
<p>And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing,
and because he had no pity.</p>
<p>12:7
拿单对大卫说，你就是那人。耶和华以色列的神如此说，我膏你作以色列的王，救你脱离扫罗的手。</p>
<p>And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD God
of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of
the hand of Saul;</p>
<p>12:8
我将你主人的家业赐给你，将你主人的妻交在你怀里，又将以色列和犹大家赐给你。你若还以为不足，我早就加倍地赐给你。</p>
<p>And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into thy
bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had
been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such
things.</p>
<p>12:9
你为什么藐视耶和华的命令，行他眼中看为恶的事呢。你借亚扪人的刀杀害赫人乌利亚，又娶了他的妻为妻。</p>
<p>Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil
in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and
hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of
the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>12:10
你既藐视我，娶了赫人乌利亚的妻为妻，所以刀剑必永不离开陪的家。</p>
<p>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because
thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to
be thy wife.</p>
<p>12:11
耶和华如此说，我必从你家中兴起祸患攻击你。我必在你眼前把你的妃嫔赐给别人，他在日光之下就与她们同寝。</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of
thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give
them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of
this sun.</p>
<p>12:12 你在暗中行这事，我却要在以色列众人面前，日光之下，报应你。</p>
<p>For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
Israel, and before the sun.</p>
<p>12:13
大卫对拿单说，我得罪耶和华了。拿单说，耶和华已经除掉你的罪，你必不至于死。</p>
<p>And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt
not die.</p>
<p>12:14
只是你行这事，叫耶和华的仇敌大得亵渎的机会，故此，你所得的孩子必定要死。</p>
<p>Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the
enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto thee
shall surely die.</p>
<p>12:15
拿单就回家去了。耶和华击打乌利亚妻给大卫所生的孩子，使他得重病。</p>
<p>And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child
that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>
<p>12:16 所以大卫为这孩子恳求神，而且禁食，进入内室，终夜躺在地上。</p>
<p>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and
went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>
<p>12:17
他家中的老臣来到他旁边，要把他从地上扶起来，他却不肯起来，也不同他们吃饭。</p>
<p>And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise him up
from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with
them.</p>
<p>12:18
到第七日，孩子死了。大卫的臣仆不敢告诉他孩子死了，因他们说，孩子还活着的时候，我们劝他，他尚且不肯听我们的话，若告诉他孩子死了，岂不更加忧伤吗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the
servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they
said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he
would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we
tell him that the child is dead?</p>
<p>12:19
大卫见臣仆彼此低声说话，就知道孩子死了，问臣仆说，孩子死了吗。他们说，死了。</p>
<p>But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that
the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child
dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>
<p>12:20
大卫就从地上起来，沭浴，抹膏，换了衣裳，进耶和华的殿敬拜。然后回宫，吩咐人摆饭，他便吃了。</p>
<p>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself,
and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and
worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they
set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>
<p>12:21
臣仆问他说，你所行的是什么意思。孩子活着的时候，你禁食哭泣。孩子死了，你倒起来吃饭。</p>
<p>Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou hast
done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive; but
when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p>
<p>12:22
大卫说，孩子还活着，我禁食哭泣。因为我想，或者耶和华怜恤我，使孩子不死也未可知。</p>
<p>And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I
said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the child
may live?</p>
<p>12:23
孩子死了，我何必禁食，我岂能使他返回呢。我必往他那里去，他却不能回我这里来。</p>
<p>But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back
again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>
<p>12:24
大卫安慰他的妻拔示巴，与她同寝，她就生了儿子，给他起名叫所罗门。耶和华也喜爱他，</p>
<p>And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay
with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the
LORD loved him.</p>
<p>12:25 就藉先知拿单赐他一个名字，叫耶底底亚，因为耶和华爱他。</p>
<p>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name
Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
<p>12:26 约押攻取亚扪人的京城拉巴。</p>
<p>And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the
royal city.</p>
<p>12:27 约押打发使者去见大卫，说，我攻打拉巴，取其水城。</p>
<p>And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against
Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>
<p>12:28
现在你要聚集其馀的军兵来，安营围攻这城，恐怕我取了这城，人就以我的名叫这城。</p>
<p>Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp
against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called
after my name.</p>
<p>12:29 于是大卫聚集众军，往拉巴去攻城，就取了这城，</p>
<p>And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and
fought against it, and took it.</p>
<p>12:30
夺了亚扪人之王所戴的金冠冕（王或作玛勒堪。玛勒堪就是米勒公，又名摩洛，亚扪族之神名），其上的金子重一他连得，又嵌着宝石。人将这冠冕戴在大卫头上。大卫从城里夺了许多财物，</p>
<p>And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight whereof
was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David’s
head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.</p>
<p>12:31
将城里的人拉出来，放在锯下，或铁耙下，或铁斧下，或叫他经过砖窑（或作强他们用锯，或用打粮食的铁器，或用铁斧作工，或使在砖窑里服役）。大卫待亚扪各城的居民都是如此。其后，大卫和众军都回耶路撒冷去了。</p>
<p>And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them under
saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them
pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the
children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
Jerusalem.</p>
