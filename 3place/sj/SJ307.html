<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-16-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 16 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子耶户，责备巴沙说，</p>
<p>Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against
Baasha, saying,</p>
<p>16:2
我既从尘埃中提拔你，立你作我民以色列的君，你竟行耶罗波安所行的道，使我民以色列陷在罪里，惹我发怒，</p>
<p>Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince
over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and
hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their
sins;</p>
<p>16:3 我必除尽你和你的家，使你的家像尼八的儿子耶罗波安的家一样。</p>
<p>Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity
of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son
of Nebat.</p>
<p>16:4 凡属巴沙的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。</p>
<p>Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>
<p>16:5 巴沙其馀的事，凡他所行的和他的勇力，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?</p>
<p>16:6 巴沙与他列祖同睡，葬在得撒。他儿子以拉接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah
his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>16:7
耶和华的话临到哈拿尼的儿子先知耶户，责备巴沙和他的家，因他行耶和华眼中看为恶的一切事，以他手所作的惹耶和华发怒，像耶罗波安的家一样，又因他杀了耶罗波安的全家。</p>
<p>And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the
word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the
evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger
with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and
because he killed him.</p>
<p>16:8
犹大王亚撒二十六年，巴沙的儿子以拉在得撒登基作以色列王共二年。</p>
<p>In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son
of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</p>
<p>16:9
有管理他一半战车的臣子心利背叛他。当他在得撒家宰亚杂家里喝醉的时候，</p>
<p>And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of
Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</p>
<p>16:10 心利就进去杀了他，篡了他的位。这是犹大王亚撒二十七年的事。</p>
<p>And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and
seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>16:11
心利一坐王位就杀了巴沙的全家，连他的亲属，朋友也没有留下一个男丁。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his
throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that
pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his
friends.</p>
<p>16:12 心利这样灭绝巴沙的全家，正如耶和华藉先知耶户责备巴沙的话。</p>
<p>Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</p>
<p>16:13
这是因巴沙和他儿子以拉的一切罪，就是他们使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列神的怒气。</p>
<p>For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which
they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD
God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>
<p>16:14 以拉其馀的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>16:15
犹大王亚撒二十七年，心利在得撒作王七日。那时民正安营围攻非利士的基比顿。</p>
<p>In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign
seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon,
which belonged to the Philistines.</p>
<p>16:16
民在营中听说心利背叛，又杀了王，故此以色列众人当日在营中立元帅暗利作以色列王。</p>
<p>And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired,
and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the
captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.</p>
<p>16:17 暗利率领以色列众人，从基比顿上去，围困得撒。</p>
<p>And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
besieged Tirzah.</p>
<p>16:18 心利见城破失，就进了王宫的卫所，放火焚烧宫殿，自焚而死。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he
went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house
over him with fire, and died,</p>
<p>16:19
这是因他犯罪，行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD,
in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make
Israel to sin.</p>
<p>16:20 心利其馀的事和他背叛的情形都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought,
are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?</p>
<p>16:21
那时，以色列民分为两半，一半随从基纳的儿子提比尼，要立他作王。一半随从暗利。</p>
<p>Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the
people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half
followed Omri.</p>
<p>16:22
但随从暗利的民胜过随从基纳的儿子提比尼的民。提比尼死了，暗利就作了王。</p>
<p>But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that
followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</p>
<p>16:23
犹大王亚撒三十一年，暗利登基作以色列王共十二年。在得撒作王六年。</p>
<p>In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign
over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.</p>
<p>16:24
暗利用二他连得银子向撒玛买了撒马利亚山，在山上造城，就按着山的原主撒玛的名，给所造的城起名叫撒马利亚。</p>
<p>And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver,
and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built,
after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.</p>
<p>16:25 暗利行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王作恶更甚。</p>
<p>But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all
that were before him.</p>
<p>16:26
因他行了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所行的，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪，以虚无的神惹耶和华以色列神的怒气。</p>
<p>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his
sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel
to anger with their vanities.</p>
<p>16:27 暗利其馀的事和他所显出的勇力都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he
shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel?</p>
<p>16:28 暗利与他列祖同睡，葬在撒马利亚。他儿子亚哈接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab
his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>16:29
犹大王亚撒三十八年，暗利的儿子亚哈登基作了以色列王。暗利的儿子亚哈在撒马利亚作以色列王二十二年。</p>
<p>And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the
son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over
Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</p>
<p>16:30 暗利的儿子亚哈行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，比他以前的列王更甚，</p>
<p>And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all
that were before him.</p>
<p>16:31
犯了尼八的儿子耶罗波安所犯的罪。他还以为轻，又娶了西顿王谒巴力的女儿耶洗别为妻，去事奉敬拜巴力，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk
in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel
the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal,
and worshipped him.</p>
<p>16:32 在撒马利亚建造巴力的庙，在庙里为巴力筑坛。</p>
<p>And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had
built in Samaria.</p>
<p>16:33
亚哈又作亚舍拉，他所行的惹耶和华以色列神的怒气，比他以前的以色列诸王更甚。</p>
<p>And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of
Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.</p>
<p>16:34
亚哈在位的时候，有伯特利人希伊勒重修耶利哥城。立根基的时候，丧了长子亚比兰。安门的时候，丧了幼子西割，正如耶和华藉嫩的儿子约书亚所说的话。</p>
<p>In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof
in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he
spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
