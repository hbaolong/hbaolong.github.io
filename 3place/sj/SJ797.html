<h4 id="旧约-耶利米书jeremiah-第-52-章-本篇共有-52-章">旧约 –
耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 52 章 ( 本篇共有 52 章 )</h4>
<p>52:1
西底家登基的时候年二十一岁，在耶路撒冷作王十一年。他母亲名叫哈慕她，是立拿人耶利米的女儿。</p>
<p>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the
daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
<p>52:2 西底家行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，是照约雅敬一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to
all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
<p>52:3
因此耶和华的怒气在耶路撒冷和犹大发作，以致将人民从自己的面前赶出。</p>
<p>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and
Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>52:4
西底家背叛巴比伦王。他作王第九年十月初十日，巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领全军来攻击耶路撒冷，对城安营，四围筑垒攻城。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched
against it, and built forts against it round about.</p>
<p>52:5 于是城被围困直到西底家王十一年。</p>
<p>So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</p>
<p>52:6 四月初九日，城里有大饥荒，甚至百姓都没有粮食。</p>
<p>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine
was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the
land.</p>
<p>52:7
城被攻破，一切兵丁就在夜间从靠近王园两城中间的门，出城逃跑。迦勒底人正在四围攻城。他们就往亚拉巴逃去。</p>
<p>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went
forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two
walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the
city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</p>
<p>52:8
迦勒底的军队追赶西底家王，在耶利哥的平原追上他。他的全军都离开他四散了。</p>
<p>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from
him.</p>
<p>52:9
迦勒底人就拿住王，带他到在哈马地利比拉的巴比伦王那里。巴比伦王便审判他。</p>
<p>Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon
to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</p>
<p>52:10
巴比伦王在西底家眼前杀了他的众子，又在利比拉杀了犹大的一切首领，</p>
<p>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he
slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</p>
<p>52:11
并且剜了西底家的眼睛，用铜链锁着他，带到巴比伦去，将他囚在监里，直到他死的日子。</p>
<p>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound
him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till
the day of his death.</p>
<p>52:12
巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒十九年五月初十日，在巴比伦王面前侍立的护卫长尼布撒拉旦进入耶路撒冷，</p>
<p>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the
nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan,
captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon, into
Jerusalem,</p>
<p>52:13
用火焚烧耶和华的殿和王宫，又焚烧耶路撒冷的房屋，就是各大户家的房屋。</p>
<p>And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the
houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he with
fire:</p>
<p>52:14 跟从护卫长迦勒底的全军就拆毁耶路撒冷四围的城墙。</p>
<p>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the
guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
<p>52:15
那时护卫长尼布撒拉旦将民中最穷的和城里所剩下的百姓，并已经投降巴比伦王的人，以及大众所剩下的人，都掳去了。</p>
<p>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that
remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of
Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
<p>52:16
但护卫长尼布撒拉旦留下些民中最穷的，使他们修理葡萄园，耕种田地。</p>
<p>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of
the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</p>
<p>52:17
耶和华殿的铜柱并殿内的盆座和铜海，迦勒底人都打碎了，将那铜运到巴比伦去了，</p>
<p>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the
bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
<p>52:18 又带去锅，铲子，腊剪，盘子，调羹，并所用的一切铜器，</p>
<p>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls,
and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered,
took they away.</p>
<p>52:19
杯，火鼎，碗，盆，灯台，调羹，爵，无论金的银的，护卫长也都带去了。</p>
<p>And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons,
and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of
gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the captain
of the guard away.</p>
<p>52:20
所罗门为耶和华殿所造的两根铜柱，一个铜海，并座下的十二只铜牛，这一切的铜多得无法可称。</p>
<p>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the
bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass
of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
<p>52:21 这一根柱子高十八肘，厚四指，是空的，围十二肘。</p>
<p>And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen
cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness
thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</p>
<p>52:22
柱上有铜顶，高五肘。铜顶的周围有网子和石榴，都是铜的。那一根柱子照此一样，也有石榴。</p>
<p>And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter
was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round
about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were
like unto these.</p>
<p>52:23 柱子四面有九十六个石榴，在网子周围，共有一百石榴。</p>
<p>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the
pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</p>
<p>52:24 护卫长拿住大祭司西莱雅，副祭司西番亚，和三个把门的，</p>
<p>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
<p>52:25
又从城中拿住一个管理兵丁的官（或作太监），并在城里所遇常见王面的七个人和检点国民军长的书记，以及城里所遇见的国民六十个人。</p>
<p>He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the
men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person,
which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who
mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the
land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
<p>52:26 护卫长尼布撒拉旦将这些人带到利比拉的巴比伦王那里。</p>
<p>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them
to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</p>
<p>52:27
巴比伦王就把他们击杀在哈马地的利比拉。这样，犹大人被掳去离开本地。</p>
<p>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah
in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his
own land.</p>
<p>52:28
尼布甲尼撒所掳的民数记在下面，在他第七年掳去犹大人三千零二十三名。</p>
<p>This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the
seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</p>
<p>52:29 尼布甲尼撒十八年从耶路撒冷掳去八百三十二人。</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</p>
<p>52:30
尼布甲尼撒二十三年，护卫长尼布撒拉旦掳去犹大人七百四十五名。共有四千六百人。</p>
<p>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the
captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred
forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six
hundred.</p>
<p>52:31
犹大王约雅斤被掳后三十七年，巴比伦王以未米罗达元年十二月二十五日，使犹大王约雅斤抬头，提他出监，</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity
of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and
twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the
first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
and brought him forth out of prison,</p>
<p>52:32 又对他说恩言，使他的位高过与他一同在巴比伦众王的位，</p>
<p>And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the
kings that were with him in Babylon,</p>
<p>52:33 给他脱了囚服。他终身在巴比伦王面前吃饭。</p>
<p>And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread
before him all the days of his life.</p>
<p>52:34
巴比伦王赐他所需用的食物，日日赐他一分，终身是这样，直到他死的日子。</p>
<p>And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of
Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of
his life.</p>
