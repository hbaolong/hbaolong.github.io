<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-26-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 26 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>26:1
犹大众民立亚玛谢的儿子乌西雅（又名亚撒利雅）接续他父作王，那时他年十六岁。</p>
<p>Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah.</p>
<p>26:2 亚玛谢与他列祖同睡之后，乌西雅收回以禄仍归犹大，又重新修理。</p>
<p>He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept
with his fathers.</p>
<p>26:3
乌西雅登基的时候年十六岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十二年。他母亲名叫耶可利雅，是耶路撒冷人。</p>
<p>Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned
fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Jecoliah of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>26:4 乌西雅行耶和华眼中看为正的事，效法他父亚玛谢一切所行的。</p>
<p>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according
to all that his father Amaziah did.</p>
<p>26:5
通晓神默示，撒迦利亚在世的时候，乌西雅定意寻求神。他寻求耶和华，神就使他亨通。</p>
<p>And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in
the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to
prosper.</p>
<p>26:6
他出去攻击非利士人，拆毁了迦特城，雅比尼城，和亚实突城。在非利士人中，在亚实突境内，又建筑了些城。</p>
<p>And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down
the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and
built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</p>
<p>26:7 神帮助他攻击非利士人和住在姑珥巴力的阿拉伯人，并米乌尼人。</p>
<p>And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians
that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.</p>
<p>26:8 亚扪人给乌西雅进贡。他的名声传到埃及，因他甚是强盛。</p>
<p>And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad
even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself
exceedingly.</p>
<p>26:9
乌西雅在耶路撒冷的角门和谷门，并城墙转弯之处，建筑城楼，且甚坚固。</p>
<p>Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at
the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.</p>
<p>26:10
又在旷野与高原和平原，建筑望楼，挖了许多井，因他的牲畜甚多。又在山地和佳美之地，有农夫和修理葡萄园的人，因为他喜悦农事。</p>
<p>Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had
much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen
also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved
husbandry.</p>
<p>26:11
乌西雅又有军兵，照书记耶利和官长玛西雅所数点的，在王的一个将军哈拿尼雅手下，分队出战。</p>
<p>Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by
bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the
scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the
king’s captains.</p>
<p>26:12 族长，大能勇士的总数共有二千六百人，</p>
<p>The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of
valour were two thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p>26:13
他们手下的军兵共有三十万七千五百人，都有大能，善于争战，帮助王攻击仇敌。</p>
<p>And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and seven
thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the
king against the enemy.</p>
<p>26:14 乌西雅为全军预备盾牌，枪，盔，甲，弓，和甩石的机弦，</p>
<p>And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and
spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
stones.</p>
<p>26:15
又在耶路撒冷使巧匠作机器，安在城楼和角楼上，用以射箭发石。乌西雅的名声传到远方。因为他得了非常的帮助，甚是强盛。</p>
<p>And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on
the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones
withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped,
till he was strong.</p>
<p>26:16
他既强盛，就心高气傲，以致行事邪僻，干犯耶和华他的神，进耶和华的殿，要在香坛上烧香。</p>
<p>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction:
for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple
of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</p>
<p>26:17 祭司亚撒利雅率领耶和华勇敢的祭司八十人，跟随他进去。</p>
<p>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore
priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</p>
<p>26:18
他们就阻挡乌西雅王，对他说，乌西雅阿，给耶和华烧香不是你的事，乃是亚伦子孙承接圣职祭司的事。你出圣殿吧。因为你犯了罪。你行这事，耶和华神必不使你得荣耀。</p>
<p>And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but
to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense:
go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be
for thine honour from the LORD God.</p>
<p>26:19
乌西雅就发怒，手拿香炉要烧香。他向祭司发怒的时候，在耶和华殿中香坛旁众祭司面前，额上忽然发出大麻疯。</p>
<p>Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense:
and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his
forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the
incense altar.</p>
<p>26:20
大祭司亚撒利雅和众祭司观看，见他额上发出大麻疯，就催他出殿。他自己也急速出去，因为耶和华降灾与他。</p>
<p>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him,
and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out
from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had
smitten him.</p>
<p>26:21
乌西雅王长大麻疯直到死日，因此住在别的宫里，与耶和华的殿隔绝。他儿子约坦管理家事，治理国民。</p>
<p>And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt
in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of
the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the
people of the land.</p>
<p>26:22 乌西雅其馀的事，自始至终都是亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚所记的。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the
prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</p>
<p>26:23
乌西雅与他列祖同睡，葬在王陵的田间他列祖的坟地里。因为人说，他是长大麻疯的。他儿子约坦接续他作王。</p>
<p>So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they
said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>
