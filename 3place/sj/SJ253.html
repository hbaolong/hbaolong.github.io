<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-17-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 17 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>17:1
非利士人招聚他们的军旅，要来争战。聚集在属犹大的梭哥，安营在梭哥和亚西加中间的以弗大悯。</p>
<p>Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and
were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to Judah, and pitched
between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.</p>
<p>17:2
扫罗和以色列人也聚集，在以拉谷安营，摆列队伍，要与非利士人打仗。</p>
<p>And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by
the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the
Philistines.</p>
<p>17:3 非利士人站在这边山上，以色列人站在那边山上，当中有谷。</p>
<p>And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel
stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between
them.</p>
<p>17:4
从非利士营中出来一个讨战的人，名叫歌利亚，是迦特人，身高六肘零一虎口。</p>
<p>And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,
named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</p>
<p>17:5 头戴铜盔，身穿铠甲，甲重五千舍客勒。</p>
<p>And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed with a
coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of
brass.</p>
<p>17:6 腿上有铜护膝，两肩之中背负铜戟。</p>
<p>And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
between his shoulders.</p>
<p>17:7
枪杆粗如织布的机轴，铁枪头重六百舍客勒。有一个拿盾牌的人在他前面走。</p>
<p>And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s
head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went
before him.</p>
<p>17:8
歌利亚对着以色列的军队站立，呼叫说，你们出来摆列队伍作什么呢。我不是非利士人吗。你们不是扫罗的仆人吗。可以从你们中间拣选一人，使他下到我这里来。</p>
<p>And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them,
Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine,
and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down
to me.</p>
<p>17:9
他若能与我战斗，将我杀死，我们就作你们的仆人。我若胜了他，将他杀死，你们就作我们的仆人，服事我们。</p>
<p>If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your
servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be
our servants, and serve us.</p>
<p>17:10
那非利士人又说，我今日向以色列人的军队骂阵。你们叫一个人出来，与我战斗。</p>
<p>And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give
me a man, that we may fight together.</p>
<p>17:11 扫罗和以色列众人听见非利士人的这些话，就惊惶，极其害怕。</p>
<p>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they
were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</p>
<p>17:12
大卫是犹大，伯利恒的以法他人耶西的儿子。耶西有八个儿子。当扫罗的时候，耶西已经老迈。</p>
<p>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose
name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an
old man in the days of Saul.</p>
<p>17:13
耶西的三个大儿子跟随扫罗出征。这出征的三个儿子，长子名叫以利押，次子名叫亚比拿达，三子名叫沙玛。</p>
<p>And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the
battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were
Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third
Shammah.</p>
<p>17:14 大卫是最小的。那三个大儿子跟随扫罗。</p>
<p>And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul.</p>
<p>17:15 大卫有时离开扫罗，回伯利恒放他父亲的羊。</p>
<p>But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at
Bethlehem.</p>
<p>17:16 那非利士人早晚都出来站着，如此四十日。</p>
<p>And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented
himself forty days.</p>
<p>17:17
一日，耶西对他儿子大卫说，你拿一伊法烘了的穗子和十个饼，速速地送到营里去，交给你哥哥们。</p>
<p>And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah
of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy
brethren.</p>
<p>17:18
再拿这十块奶饼，送给他们的千夫长，且问你哥哥们好，向他们要一封信来。</p>
<p>And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand, and
look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.</p>
<p>17:19 扫罗与大卫的三个哥哥和以色列众人，在以拉谷与非利士人打仗。</p>
<p>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of
Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</p>
<p>17:20
大卫早晨起来，将羊交托一个看守的人，照着他父亲所吩咐的话，带着食物去了。到了辎重营，军兵刚出到战场，呐喊要战。</p>
<p>And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a
keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to
the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for
the battle.</p>
<p>17:21 以色列人和非利士人都摆列队伍，彼此相对。</p>
<p>For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army
against army.</p>
<p>17:22
大卫把他带来的食物留在看守物件人的手下，跑到战场，问他哥哥们安。</p>
<p>And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren.</p>
<p>17:23
与他们说话的时候，那讨战的，就是属迦特的非利士人歌利亚，从非利士队中出来，说从前所说的话。大卫都听见了。</p>
<p>And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the
Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the
Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard
them.</p>
<p>17:24 以色列众人看见那人，就逃跑，极其害怕。</p>
<p>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and
were sore afraid.</p>
<p>17:25
以色列人彼此说，这上来的人你看见了吗。他上来是要向以色列人骂阵。若有能杀他的，王必赏赐他大财，将自己的女儿给他为妻，并在以色列人中免他父家纳粮当差。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?
surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who
killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give
him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.</p>
<p>17:26
大卫问站在旁边的人说，有人杀这非利士人，除掉以色列人的耻辱，怎样待他呢。这未受割礼的非利士人是谁呢。竟敢向永生神的军队骂阵吗。</p>
<p>And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be
done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the
reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he
should defy the armies of the living God?</p>
<p>17:27
百姓照先前的话回答他说，有人能杀这非利士人，必如此如此待他。</p>
<p>And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be
done to the man that killeth him.</p>
<p>17:28
大卫的长兄以利押听见大卫与他们所说的话，就向他发怒，说，你下来作什么呢。在旷野的那几只羊，你交托了谁呢。我知道你的骄傲和你心里的恶意，你下来特为要看争战。</p>
<p>And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and
Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou
down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the
wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for
thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.</p>
<p>17:29 大卫说，我作了什么呢。我来岂没有缘故吗。</p>
<p>And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</p>
<p>17:30
大卫就离开他转向别人，照先前的话而问。百姓仍照先前的话回答他。</p>
<p>And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same
manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</p>
<p>17:31 有人听见大卫所说的话，就告诉了扫罗。扫罗便打发人叫他来。</p>
<p>And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed them
before Saul: and he sent for him.</p>
<p>17:32
大卫对扫罗说，人都不必因那非利士人胆怯。你的仆人要去与那非利士人战斗。</p>
<p>And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy
servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</p>
<p>17:33
扫罗对大卫说，你不能去与那非利士人战斗。因为你年纪太轻，他自幼就作战士。</p>
<p>And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he a man of
war from his youth.</p>
<p>17:34
大卫对扫罗说，你仆人为父亲放羊，有时来了狮子，有时来了熊，从群中衔一只羊羔去。</p>
<p>And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father’s sheep, and
there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</p>
<p>17:35
我就追赶它，击打它，将羊羔从它口中救出来。它起来要害我，我就揪着它的胡子，将它打死。</p>
<p>And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his
mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and
smote him, and slew him.</p>
<p>17:36
你仆人曾打死狮子和熊，这未受割礼的非利士人向永生神的军队骂阵，也必像狮子和熊一般。</p>
<p>Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised
Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of
the living God.</p>
<p>17:37
大卫又说，耶和华救我脱离狮子和熊的爪，也必救我脱离这非利士人的手。扫罗对大卫说，你可以去吧。耶和华必与你同在。</p>
<p>David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the
lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand
of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with
thee.</p>
<p>17:38
扫罗就把自己的战衣给大卫穿上，将铜盔给他戴上，又给他穿上铠甲。</p>
<p>And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass
upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</p>
<p>17:39
大卫把刀跨在战衣外，试试能走不能走。因为素来没有穿惯，就对扫罗说，我穿戴这些不能走，因为素来没有穿惯。于是摘脱了。</p>
<p>And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for
he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these;
for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</p>
<p>17:40
他手中拿杖，又在溪中挑选了五块光滑石子，放在袋里，就是牧人带的囊里。手中拿着甩石的机弦，就去迎那非利士人。</p>
<p>And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones
out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in
a scrip; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the
Philistine.</p>
<p>17:41 非利士人也渐渐地迎着大卫来，拿盾牌的走在前头。</p>
<p>And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that
bare the shield went before him.</p>
<p>17:42
非利士人观看，见了大卫，就藐视他。因为他年轻，面色光红，容貌俊美。</p>
<p>And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained
him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</p>
<p>17:43
非利士人对大卫说，你拿杖到我这里来，我岂是狗呢。非利士人就指着自己的神咒诅大卫。</p>
<p>And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou comest to
me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</p>
<p>17:44
非利士人又对大卫说，来吧。我将你的肉给空中的飞鸟，田野的走兽吃。</p>
<p>And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy
flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</p>
<p>17:45
大卫对非利士人说，你来攻击我，是靠着刀枪和铜戟。我来攻击你，是靠着万军之耶和华的名，就是你所怒骂带领以色列军队的神。</p>
<p>Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword,
and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of
the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast
defied.</p>
<p>17:46
今日耶和华必将你交在我手里。我必杀你，斩你的头，又将非利士军兵的尸首给空中的飞鸟，地上的野兽吃，使普天下的人都知道以色列中有神。</p>
<p>This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite
thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the
host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the
wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a
God in Israel.</p>
<p>17:47
又使这众人知道耶和华使人得胜，不是用刀用枪，因为争战的胜败全在乎耶和华。他必将你们交在我们手里。</p>
<p>And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword
and spear: for the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give you into our
hands.</p>
<p>17:48
非利士人起身，迎着大卫前来。大卫急忙迎着非利士人，往战场跑去。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew
nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet
the Philistine.</p>
<p>17:49
大卫用手从囊中掏出一块石子来，用机弦甩去，打中非利士人的额，石子进入额内，他就仆倒，面伏于地。</p>
<p>And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang
it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into
his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth.</p>
<p>17:50
这样，大卫用机弦甩石，胜了那非利士人，打死他。大卫手中却没有刀。</p>
<p>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone,
and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the
hand of David.</p>
<p>17:51
大卫跑去，站在非利士人身旁，将他的刀从鞘中拔出来，杀死他，割了他的头。非利士众人看见他们讨战的勇士死了，就都逃跑。</p>
<p>Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his
sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off
his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was
dead, they fled.</p>
<p>17:52
以色列人和犹大人便起身呐喊，追赶非利士人，直到迦特（或作该）和以革伦的城门。被杀的非利士人倒在沙拉音的路上，直到迦特和以革伦。</p>
<p>And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued
the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of
Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to
Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.</p>
<p>17:53 以色列人追赶非利士人回来，就夺了他们的营盘。</p>
<p>And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</p>
<p>17:54
大卫将那非利士人的头拿到耶路撒冷，却将他军装放在自己的帐棚里。</p>
<p>And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.</p>
<p>17:55
扫罗看见大卫去攻击非利士人，就问元帅押尼珥说，押尼珥阿，那少年人是谁的儿子。押尼珥说，我敢在王面前起誓，我不知道。</p>
<p>And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto
Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And
Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>17:56 王说，你可以问问那幼年人是谁的儿子。</p>
<p>And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.</p>
<p>17:57
大卫打死非利士人回来，押尼珥领他到扫罗面前，他手中拿着非利士人的头。</p>
<p>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner
took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in
his hand.</p>
<p>17:58
扫罗问他说，少年人哪，你是谁的儿子。大卫说，我是你仆人伯利恒人耶西的儿子。</p>
<p>And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David
answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</p>
