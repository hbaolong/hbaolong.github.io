– 第41 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>41:1 过了两年，法老作梦，梦见自己站在河边，</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</p>
<p>41:2 有七只母牛从河里上来，又美好又肥壮，在芦荻中吃草。</p>
<p>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine
and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</p>
<p>41:3
随后又有七只母牛从河里上来，又丑陋又乾瘦，与那七只母牛一同站在河边。</p>
<p>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river,
ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink
of the river.</p>
<p>41:4
这又丑陋又乾瘦的七只母牛吃尽了那又美好又肥壮的七只母牛。法老就醒了。</p>
<p>And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well
favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>
<p>41:5
他又睡着，第二回作梦，梦见一棵麦子长了七个穗子，又肥大又佳美，</p>
<p>And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of
corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</p>
<p>41:6 随后又长了七个穗子，又细弱又被东风吹焦了。</p>
<p>And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up
after them.</p>
<p>41:7
这细弱的穗子吞了那七个又肥大又饱满的穗子。法老醒了，不料是个梦。</p>
<p>And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And
Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</p>
<p>41:8
到了早晨，法老心里不安，就差人召了埃及所有的术士和博士来。法老就把所作的梦告诉他们，却没有人能给法老圆解。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and
he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men
thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could
interpret them unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>41:9 那时酒政对法老说，我今日想起我的罪来。</p>
<p>Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my
faults this day:</p>
<p>41:10 从前法老恼怒臣仆，把我和膳长下在护卫长府布的监里。</p>
<p>Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:</p>
<p>41:11 我们二人同夜各作一梦，各梦都有讲解。</p>
<p>And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man
according to the interpretation of his dream.</p>
<p>41:12
在那里同着我们有一个希伯来的少年人，是护卫长的仆人，我们告诉他，他就把我们的梦圆解，是按着各人的梦圆解的。</p>
<p>And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the
captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our
dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</p>
<p>41:13 后来正如他给我们圆解的成就了。我官复原职，膳长被挂起来了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>
<p>41:14
法老遂即差人去召约瑟，他们便急忙带他出监，他就剃头，刮脸，换衣裳，进到法老面前。</p>
<p>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out
of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came
in unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>41:15
法老对约瑟说，我作了一梦，没有人能解。我听见人说，你听了梦就能解。</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is
none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou
canst understand a dream to interpret it.</p>
<p>41:16 约瑟回答法老说，这不在乎我，神必将平安的话回答法老。</p>
<p>And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give
Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>
<p>41:17 法老对约瑟说，我梦见我站在河边，</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the
bank of the river:</p>
<p>41:18 有七只母牛从河里上来，又肥壮又美好，在芦荻中吃草。</p>
<p>And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed
and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</p>
<p>41:19
随后又有七只母牛上来，又软弱又丑陋又乾瘦，在埃及遍地，我没有见过这样不好的。</p>
<p>And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill
favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt
for badness:</p>
<p>41:20 这又乾瘦又丑陋的母牛吃尽了那以先的七只肥母牛，</p>
<p>And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat
kine:</p>
<p>41:21
吃了以后却看不出是吃了，那丑陋的样子仍旧和先前一样。我就醒了。</p>
<p>And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had
eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I
awoke.</p>
<p>41:22 我又梦见一棵麦子，长了七个穗子，又饱满又佳美，</p>
<p>And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk,
full and good:</p>
<p>41:23 随后又长了七个穗子，枯槁细弱，被东风吹焦了。</p>
<p>And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east
wind, sprung up after them:</p>
<p>41:24
这些细弱的穗子吞了那七个佳美的穗子。我将这梦告诉了术士，却没有人能给我解说。</p>
<p>And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto
the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</p>
<p>41:25
约瑟对法老说，法老的梦乃是一个。神已将所要作的事指示法老了。</p>
<p>And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath
shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</p>
<p>41:26 七只好母牛是七年，七个好穗子也是七年。这梦乃是一个。</p>
<p>The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are
seven years: the dream is one.</p>
<p>41:27
那随后上来的七只又乾瘦又丑陋的母牛是七年，那七个虚空，被东风吹焦的穗子也是七年，都是七个荒年。</p>
<p>And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are
seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall
be seven years of famine.</p>
<p>41:28 这就是我对法老所说，神已将所要作的事显明给法老了。</p>
<p>This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about
to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>41:29 埃及遍地必来七个大丰年，</p>
<p>Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the
land of Egypt:</p>
<p>41:30
随后又要来七个荒年，甚至埃及地都忘了先前的丰收，全地必被饥荒所灭。</p>
<p>And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the
plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall
consume the land;</p>
<p>41:31 因那以后的饥荒甚大，便不觉得先前的丰收了。</p>
<p>And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that
famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</p>
<p>41:32 至于法老两回作梦，是因神命定这事，而且必速速成就。</p>
<p>And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because
the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to
pass.</p>
<p>41:33 所以，法老当拣选一个有聪明有智慧的人，派他治理埃及地。</p>
<p>Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set
him over the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:34
法老当这样行，又派官员管理这地。当七个丰年的时候，征收埃及地的五分之一，</p>
<p>Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and
take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous
years.</p>
<p>41:35
叫他们把将来丰年一切的粮食聚敛起来，积蓄五谷，收存在各城里作食物，归于法老的手下。</p>
<p>And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and
lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the
cities.</p>
<p>41:36
所积蓄的粮食可以防备埃及地将来的七个荒年，免得这地被饥荒所灭。</p>
<p>And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years
of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not
through the famine.</p>
<p>41:37 法老和他一切臣仆都以这事为妙。</p>
<p>And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all
his servants.</p>
<p>41:38
法老对臣仆说，像这样的人，有神的灵在他里头，我们岂能找得着呢，</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this
is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</p>
<p>41:39
法老对约瑟说，神既将这事都指示你，可见没有人像你这样有聪明有智慧。</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all
this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:</p>
<p>41:40
你可以掌管我的家。我的民都必听从你的话。惟独在宝座上我比你大。</p>
<p>Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my
people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.</p>
<p>41:41 法老又对约瑟说，我派你治理埃及全地。</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land
of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:42
法老就摘下手上打印的戒指，戴在约瑟的手上，给他穿上细麻衣，把金链戴在他的颈项上，</p>
<p>And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph’s
hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain
about his neck;</p>
<p>41:43
又叫约瑟坐他的副车，喝道的在前呼叫说，跪下。这样，法老派他治理埃及全地。</p>
<p>And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they
cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land
of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:44
法老对约瑟说，我是法老，在埃及全地，若没有你的命令，不许人擅自办事（原文作动手动脚）。</p>
<p>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no
man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:45
法老赐名给约瑟，叫撒发那忒巴内亚，又将安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给他为妻。约瑟就出去巡行埃及地。</p>
<p>And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to
wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went
out over all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:46
约瑟见埃及王法老的时候年三十岁。他从法老面前出去，遍行埃及全地。</p>
<p>And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of
Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went
throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:47 七个丰年之内，地的出产极丰极盛（原文作一把一把的），</p>
<p>And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
handfuls.</p>
<p>41:48
约瑟聚敛埃及地七个丰年一切的粮食，把粮食积存在各城里。各城周围田地的粮食都积存在本城里。</p>
<p>And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the
land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the
field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.</p>
<p>41:49 约瑟积蓄五谷甚多，如同海边的沙，无法计算，因为谷不可胜数。</p>
<p>And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he
left numbering; for it was without number.</p>
<p>41:50
荒年未到以前，安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给约瑟生了两个儿子。</p>
<p>And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came,
which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him.</p>
<p>41:51
约瑟给长子起名叫玛拿西（就是使之忘了的意思），因为他说，神使我忘了一切的困苦和我父的全家。</p>
<p>And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said
he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.</p>
<p>41:52
他给次子起名叫以法莲（就是使之昌盛的意思），因为他说，神使我在受苦的地方昌盛。</p>
<p>And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me
to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>
<p>41:53 埃及地的七个丰年一完，</p>
<p>And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt,
were ended.</p>
<p>41:54
七个荒年就来了。正如约瑟所说的，各地都有饥荒。惟独埃及全地有粮食。</p>
<p>And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had
said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt
there was bread.</p>
<p>41:55
及至埃及全地有了饥荒，众民向法老哀求粮食，法老对他们说，你们往约瑟那里去，凡他所说的，你们都要作。</p>
<p>And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to
Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto
Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</p>
<p>41:56
当时饥荒遍满天下，约瑟开了各处的仓，粜粮给埃及人。在埃及地饥荒甚大。</p>
<p>And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened
all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed
sore in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>41:57 各地的人都往埃及去，到约瑟那里籴粮，因为天下的饥荒甚大。</p>
<p>And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because
that the famine was so sore in all lands.</p>
