<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-32-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 32 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>32:1
这虔诚的事以后，亚述王西拿基立来侵入犹大，围困一切坚固城，想要攻破占据。</p>
<p>After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king
of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced
cities, and thought to win them for himself.</p>
<p>32:2 希西家见西拿基立来，定意要攻打耶路撒冷，</p>
<p>And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was
purposed to fight against Jerusalem,</p>
<p>32:3 就与首领和勇士商议，塞住城外的泉源。他们就都帮助他。</p>
<p>He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the
waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help
him.</p>
<p>32:4
于是有许多人聚集，塞了一切泉源，并通流国中的小河，说，亚述王来，为何让他得着许多水呢。</p>
<p>So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the
fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying,
Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water?</p>
<p>32:5
希西家力图自强，就修筑所有拆毁的城墙，高与城楼相齐。在城外又筑一城，坚固大卫城的米罗，制造了许多军器，盾牌。</p>
<p>Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was
broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and
repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in
abundance.</p>
<p>32:6
设立军长管理百姓，将他们招聚在城门的宽阔处，用话勉励他们，说，</p>
<p>And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake
comfortably to them, saying,</p>
<p>32:7
你们当刚强壮胆，不要因亚述王和跟随他的大军恐惧，惊慌。因为与我们同在的，比与他们同在的更大。</p>
<p>Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of
Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more
with us than with him:</p>
<p>32:8
与他们同在的是肉臂，与我们同在的是耶和华我们的神，他必帮助我们，为我们争战。百姓就靠犹大王希西家的话，安然无惧了。</p>
<p>With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help
us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the
words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>
<p>32:9
此后，亚述王西拿基立和他的全军攻打拉吉，就差遣臣仆到耶路撒冷见犹大王希西家和一切在耶路撒冷的犹大人，说，</p>
<p>After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to
Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power
with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at
Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p>32:10 亚述王西拿基立如此说，你们倚靠什么，还在耶路撒冷受困呢。</p>
<p>Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye
abide in the siege in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>32:11
希西家对你们说耶和华我们的神必救我们脱离亚述王的手，这不是诱惑你们，使你们受饥渴而死吗。</p>
<p>Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by
famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of
the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p>32:12
这希西家岂不是废去耶和华的邱坛和祭坛，吩咐犹大与耶路撒冷的人说你们当在一个坛前敬拜，在其上烧香吗。</p>
<p>Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars,
and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one
altar, and burn incense upon it?</p>
<p>32:13
我与我列祖向列邦所行的，你们岂不知道吗。列邦的神何尝能救自己的国脱离我手呢。</p>
<p>Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of
other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able
to deliver their lands out of mine hand?</p>
<p>32:14
我列祖所灭的国，那些神中谁能救自己的民脱离我手呢。难道你们的神能救你们脱离我手吗。</p>
<p>Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers
utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that
your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
<p>32:15
所以你们不要叫希西家这样欺哄诱惑你们，也不要信他。因为没有一国一邦的神能救自己的民脱离我手和我列祖的手，何况你们的神更不能救你们脱离我的手。</p>
<p>Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this
manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was
able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my
fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?</p>
<p>32:16 西拿基立的臣仆还有别的话毁谤耶和华神和他仆人希西家。</p>
<p>And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his
servant Hezekiah.</p>
<p>32:17
西拿基立也写信毁谤耶和华以色列的神说，列邦的神既不能救他的民脱离我手，希西家的神也不能救他的民脱离我手了。</p>
<p>He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak
against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not
delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of
Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.</p>
<p>32:18
亚述王的臣仆用犹大言语向耶路撒冷城上的民大声呼叫，要惊吓他们，扰乱他们，以便取城。</p>
<p>Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people
of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble
them; that they might take the city.</p>
<p>32:19 他们论耶路撒冷的神，如同论世上人手所造的神一样。</p>
<p>And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of
the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.</p>
<p>32:20 希西家王和亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚因此祷告，向天呼求。</p>
<p>And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son
of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.</p>
<p>32:21
耶和华就差遣一个使者进入亚述王营中，把所有大能的勇士和官长，将帅尽都灭了。亚述王满面含羞地回到本国，进了他神的庙中，有他亲生的儿子在那里用刀杀了他。</p>
<p>And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of
valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.
So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come
into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew
him there with the sword.</p>
<p>32:22
这样，耶和华救希西家和耶路撒冷的居民脱离亚述王西拿基立的手，也脱离一切仇敌的手，又赐他们四境平安。</p>
<p>Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from
the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all
other, and guided them on every side.</p>
<p>32:23
有许多人到耶路撒冷，将供物献与耶和华，又将宝物送给犹大王希西家。此后，希西家在列邦人的眼中看为尊大。</p>
<p>And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to
Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all
nations from thenceforth.</p>
<p>32:24
那时希西家病得要死，就祷告耶和华，耶和华应允他，赐他一个兆头。</p>
<p>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the
LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.</p>
<p>32:25
希西家却没有照他所蒙的恩报答耶和华。因他心里骄傲，所以忿怒要临到他和犹大并耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto
him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him,
and upon Judah and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>32:26
但希西家和耶路撒冷的居民觉得心里骄傲，就一同自卑，以致耶和华的忿怒在希西家的日子没有临到他们。</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart,
both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD
came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p>
<p>32:27
希西家大有尊荣资财，建造府库，收藏金银，宝石，香料，盾牌，和各样的宝器，</p>
<p>And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones,
and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant
jewels;</p>
<p>32:28 又建造仓房，收藏五谷，新酒，和油，又为各类牲畜盖棚立圈。</p>
<p>Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and
stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.</p>
<p>32:29 并且建立城邑，还有许多的羊群牛群，因为神赐他极多的财产。</p>
<p>Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds
in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.</p>
<p>32:30
这希西家也塞住基训的上源，引水直下，流在大卫城的西边。希西家所行的事尽都亨通。</p>
<p>This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and
brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And
Hezekiah prospered in all his works.</p>
<p>32:31
惟有一件事，就是巴比伦王差遣使者来见希西家，访问国中所现的奇事。这件事神离开他，要试验他，好知道他心内如何。</p>
<p>Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon,
who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land,
God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his
heart.</p>
<p>32:32
希西家其馀的事和他的善行，都写在亚摩斯的儿子先知以赛亚的默示书上，和犹大，以色列的诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they
are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in
the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p>32:33
希西家与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫子孙的高陵上。他死的时候，犹大人和耶路撒冷的居民都尊敬他。他儿子玛拿西接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his
son reigned in his stead.</p>
