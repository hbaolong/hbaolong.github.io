<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第29-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第29 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>29:1 雅各起行，到了东方人之地，</p>
<p>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people
of the east.</p>
<p>29:2
看见田间有一口井，有三群羊卧在井旁。因为人饮羊群都是用那井里的水。井口上的石头是大的。</p>
<p>And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there were
three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the
flocks: and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.</p>
<p>29:3
常有羊群在那里聚集，牧人把石头转离井口饮羊，随后又把石头放在井口的原处。</p>
<p>And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone
from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again
upon the well’s mouth in his place.</p>
<p>29:4
雅各对牧人说，弟兄们，你们是哪里来的，他们说，我们是哈兰来的。</p>
<p>And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they said,
Of Haran are we.</p>
<p>29:5 他问他们说，拿鹤的孙子拉班，你们认识吗。他们说，我们认识。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said,
We know him.</p>
<p>29:6 雅各说，他平安吗。他们说，平安。看哪，他女儿拉结领着羊来了。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and,
behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</p>
<p>29:7
雅各说，日头还高，不是羊群聚集的时候，你们不如饮羊，再去放一放。</p>
<p>And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed
them.</p>
<p>29:8 他们说，我们不能，必等羊群聚齐，人把石头转离井口才可饮羊。</p>
<p>And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together,
and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the
sheep.</p>
<p>29:9
雅各正和他们说话的时候，拉结领着她父亲的羊来了，因为那些羊是她牧放的。</p>
<p>And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s
sheep: for she kept them.</p>
<p>29:10
雅各看见母舅拉班的女儿拉结和母舅拉班的羊群，就上前把石头转离井口，饮他母舅拉班的羊群。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his
mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that
Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered
the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</p>
<p>29:11 雅各与拉结亲嘴，就放声而哭。</p>
<p>And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p>29:12
雅各告诉拉结，自己是她父亲的外甥，是利百加的儿子，拉结就跑去告诉她父亲。</p>
<p>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he
was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</p>
<p>29:13
拉班听见外甥雅各的信息，就跑去迎接，抱着他，与他亲嘴，领他到自己的家。雅各将一切的情由告诉拉班。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him,
and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</p>
<p>29:14 拉班对他说，你实在是我的骨肉。雅各就和他同住了一个月。</p>
<p>And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he
abode with him the space of a month.</p>
<p>29:15
拉班对雅各说，你虽是我的骨肉（原文作弟兄），岂可白白地服事我。请告诉我，你要什么为工价。</p>
<p>And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest
thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages
be?</p>
<p>29:16 拉班有两个女儿，大的名叫利亚，小的名叫拉结。</p>
<p>And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the
name of the younger was Rachel.</p>
<p>29:17 利亚的眼睛没有神气，拉结却生得美貌俊秀。</p>
<p>Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.</p>
<p>29:18 雅各爱拉结，就说，我愿为你小女儿拉结服事你七年。</p>
<p>And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for
Rachel thy younger daughter.</p>
<p>29:19 拉班说，我把她给你，胜似给别人，你与我同住吧。</p>
<p>And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I
should give her to another man: abide with me.</p>
<p>29:20
雅各就为拉结服事了七年。他因为深爱拉结，就看这七年如同几天。</p>
<p>And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but
a few days, for the love he had to her.</p>
<p>29:21
雅各对拉班说，日期已经满了，求你把我的妻子给我，我好与她同房。</p>
<p>And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</p>
<p>29:22 拉班就摆设筵席，请齐了那地方的众人。</p>
<p>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a
feast.</p>
<p>29:23 到晚上，拉班将女儿利亚送来给雅各，雅各就与她同房。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,
and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</p>
<p>29:24 拉班又将婢女悉帕给女儿利亚作使女。</p>
<p>And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.</p>
<p>29:25
到了早晨，雅各一看是利亚，就对拉班说，你向我作的是什么事呢。我服事你，不是为拉结吗，你为什么欺哄我呢。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he
said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with
thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</p>
<p>29:26
拉班说，大女儿还没有给人，先把小女儿给人，在我们这地方没有这规矩。</p>
<p>And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the
younger before the firstborn.</p>
<p>29:27 你为这个满了七日，我就把那个也给你，你再为她服事我七年。</p>
<p>Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service
which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>
<p>29:28 雅各就如此行。满了利亚的七日，拉班便将女儿拉结给雅各为妻。</p>
<p>And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his
daughter to wife also.</p>
<p>29:29 拉班又将婢女辟拉给女儿拉结作使女。</p>
<p>And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her
maid.</p>
<p>29:30
雅各也与拉结同房，并且爱拉结胜似爱利亚，于是又服事了拉班七年。</p>
<p>And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than
Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>
<p>29:31
耶和华见利亚失宠（原文作被恨下同），就使她生育，拉结却不生育。</p>
<p>And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but
Rachel was barren.</p>
<p>29:32
利亚怀孕生子，就给他起名叫流便（就是有儿子的意思），因而说，耶和华看见我的苦情，如今我的丈夫必爱我。</p>
<p>And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben:
for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now
therefore my husband will love me.</p>
<p>29:33
她又怀孕生子，就说，耶和华因为听见我失宠，所以又赐给我这个儿子。于是给他起名叫西缅（就是听见的意思）。</p>
<p>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD
hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also:
and she called his name Simeon.</p>
<p>29:34
她又怀孕生子，起名叫利未（就是联合的意思），说，我给丈夫生了三个儿子，他必与我联合。</p>
<p>And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will
my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons:
therefore was his name called Levi.</p>
<p>29:35
她又怀孕生子，说，这回我要赞美耶和华，因此给他起名叫犹大（就是赞美的意思）。这才停了生育。</p>
<p>And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I
praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left
bearing.</p>
