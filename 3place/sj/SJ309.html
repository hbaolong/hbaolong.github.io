<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-18-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 18 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>18:1
过了许久，到第三年，耶和华的话临到以利亚说，你去，使亚哈得见你。我要降雨在地上。</p>
<p>And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came
to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I
will send rain upon the earth.</p>
<p>18:2 以利亚就去，要使亚哈得见他。那时，撒马利亚有大饥荒。</p>
<p>And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
famine in Samaria.</p>
<p>18:3 亚哈将他的家宰俄巴底召了来。俄巴底甚是敬畏耶和华，</p>
<p>And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now
Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p>
<p>18:4
耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，俄巴底将一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们。</p>
<p>For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that
Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and
fed them with bread and water.)</p>
<p>18:5
亚哈对俄巴底说，我们走遍这地，到一切水泉旁和一切溪边，或者找得着青草，可以救活骡马，免得绝了牲畜。</p>
<p>And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of
water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the
horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</p>
<p>18:6 于是二人分地游行，亚哈独走一路，俄巴底独走一路。</p>
<p>So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab
went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</p>
<p>18:7
俄巴底在路上恰与以利亚相遇，俄巴底认出他来，就俯伏在地，说，你是我主以利亚不是。</p>
<p>And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew
him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?</p>
<p>18:8 回答说，是。你去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里。</p>
<p>And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
here.</p>
<p>18:9 俄巴底说，仆人有什么罪，你竟要将我交在亚哈手里，使他杀我呢。</p>
<p>And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</p>
<p>18:10
我指着永生耶和华你的神起誓，无论哪一邦哪一国，我主都打发人去找你。若说你没有在那里，就必使那邦那国的人起誓说，实在是找不着你。</p>
<p>As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my
lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he
took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.</p>
<p>18:11 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里。</p>
<p>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.</p>
<p>18:12
恐怕我一离开你，耶和华的灵就提你到我所不知道的地方去。这样，我去告诉亚哈，他若找不着你，就必杀我。仆人却是自幼敬畏耶和华的。</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the
Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I
come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy
servant fear the LORD from my youth.</p>
<p>18:13
耶洗别杀耶和华众先知的时候，我将耶和华的一百个先知藏了，每五十人藏在一个洞里，拿饼和水供养他们，岂没有人将这事告诉我主吗。</p>
<p>Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of
the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by fifty in a
cave, and fed them with bread and water?</p>
<p>18:14 现在你说，要去告诉你主人说，以利亚在这里，他必杀我。</p>
<p>And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and
he shall slay me.</p>
<p>18:15
以利亚说，我指着所事奉永生的万军之耶和华起誓，我今日必使亚哈得见我。</p>
<p>And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I
will surely shew myself unto him to day.</p>
<p>18:16 于是俄巴底去迎着亚哈，告诉他。亚哈就去迎着以利亚。</p>
<p>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet
Elijah.</p>
<p>18:17 亚哈见了以利亚，便说，使以色列遭灾的就是你吗。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him,
Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</p>
<p>18:18
以利亚说，使以色列遭灾的不是我，乃是你和你父家。因为你们离弃耶和华的诫命，去随从巴力。</p>
<p>And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD,
and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>
<p>18:19
现在你当差遣人，招聚以色列众人和事奉巴力的那四百五十个先知，并耶洗别所供养事奉亚舍拉的那四百个先知，使他们都上迦密山去见我。</p>
<p>Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel,
and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the
groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</p>
<p>18:20 亚哈就差遣人招聚以色列众人和先知都上迦密山。</p>
<p>So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>
<p>18:21
以利亚前来对众民说，你们心持两意要到几时呢。若耶和华是神，就当顺从耶和华。若巴力是神，就当顺从巴力。众民一言不答。</p>
<p>And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>
<p>18:22
以利亚对众民说，作耶和华先知的只剩下我一个人。巴力的先知却有四百五十个人。</p>
<p>Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of
the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty men.</p>
<p>18:23
当给我们两只牛犊，巴力的先知可以挑选一只，切成块子，放在柴上，不要点火。我也预备一只牛犊放在柴上，也不点火。</p>
<p>Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one
bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and
put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on
wood, and put no fire under:</p>
<p>18:24
你们求告你们神的名，我也求告耶和华的名。那降火显应的神，就是神。众民回答说，这话甚好。</p>
<p>And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of
the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all
the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p>
<p>18:25
以利亚对巴力的先知说，你们既是人多，当先挑选一只牛犊，预备好了，就求告你们神的名，却不要点火。</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for
yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of
your gods, but put no fire under.</p>
<p>18:26
他们将所得的牛犊预备好了，从早晨到午间，求告巴力的名说，巴力阿，求你应允我们。却没有声音，没有应允的。他们在所筑的坛四围踊跳。</p>
<p>And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it,
and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O
Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they
leaped upon the altar which was made.</p>
<p>18:27
到了正午，以利亚嬉笑他们，说，大声求告吧。因为他是神，他或默想，或走到一边，或行路，或睡觉，你们当叫醒他。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry
aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he
is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>
<p>18:28
他们大声求告，按着他们的规矩，用刀枪自割，自刺，直到身体流血。</p>
<p>And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with
knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>
<p>18:29
从午后直到献晚祭的时候，他们狂呼乱叫，却没有声音，没有应允的，也没有理会的。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until
the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was
neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>
<p>18:30
以利亚对众民说，你们到我这里来。众民就到他那里。他便重修已经毁坏耶和华的坛。</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that
was broken down.</p>
<p>18:31
以利亚照雅各子孙支派的数目，取了十二块石头（耶和华的话曾临到雅各说，你的名要叫以色列），</p>
<p>And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes
of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying,
Israel shall be thy name:</p>
<p>18:32
用这些石头为耶和华的名筑一座坛，在坛的四围挖沟，可容谷种二细亚，</p>
<p>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he
made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of
seed.</p>
<p>18:33
又在坛上摆好了柴，把牛犊切成块子放在柴上，对众人说，你们用四个桶盛满水，倒在燔祭和柴上。</p>
<p>And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid
him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on
the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>
<p>18:34
又说，倒第二次。他们就倒第二次。又说，倒第三次。他们就倒第三次。</p>
<p>And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second time.
And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.</p>
<p>18:35 水流在坛的四围，沟里也满了水。</p>
<p>And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench
also with water.</p>
<p>18:36
到了献晚祭的时候，先知以利亚近前来，说，亚伯拉罕，以撒，以色列的神，耶和华阿，求你今日使人知道你是以色列的神，也知道我是你的仆人，又是奉你的命行这一切事。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these
things at thy word.</p>
<p>18:37
耶和华阿，求你应允我，应允我。使这民知道你耶和华是神，又知道是你叫这民的心回转。</p>
<p>Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the
LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>
<p>18:38
于是，耶和华降下火来，烧尽燔祭，木柴，石头，尘土，又烧乾沟里的水。</p>
<p>Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and
the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was
in the trench.</p>
<p>18:39 众民看见了，就俯伏在地，说，耶和华是神。耶和华是神。</p>
<p>And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and they
said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p>
<p>18:40
以利亚对他们说，拿住巴力的先知，不容一人逃脱。众人就拿住他们。以利亚带他们到基顺河边，在那里杀了他们。</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of
them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the
brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p>
<p>18:41 以利亚对亚哈说，你现在可以上去吃喝，因为有多雨的响声了。</p>
<p>And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for there is a
sound of abundance of rain.</p>
<p>18:42
亚哈就上去吃喝。以利亚上了迦密山顶，屈身在地，将脸伏在两膝之中。</p>
<p>So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of
Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face
between his knees,</p>
<p>18:43
对仆人说，你上去，向海观看。仆人就上去观看，说，没有什么。他说，你再去观看。如此七次。</p>
<p>And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went
up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven
times.</p>
<p>18:44
第七次仆人说，我看见有一小片云从海里上来，不过如人手那样大。以利亚说，你上去告诉亚哈，当套车下去，免得被雨阻挡。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there
ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said,
Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the
rain stop thee not.</p>
<p>18:45 霎时间，天因风云黑暗，降下大雨。亚哈就坐车往耶斯列去了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with
clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to
Jezreel.</p>
<p>18:46
耶和华的灵（原文作手）降在以利亚身上，他就束上腰，奔在亚哈前头，直到耶斯列的城门。</p>
<p>And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins,
and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>
