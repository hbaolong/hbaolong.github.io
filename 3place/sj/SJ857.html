<h4 id="旧约-但以理书daniel-第-7-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
但以理书(Daniel) – 第 7 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>7:1
巴比伦王伯沙撒元年，但以理在床上作梦，见了脑中的异象，就记录这梦，述说其中的大意。</p>
<p>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream
and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told
the sum of the matters.</p>
<p>7:2 但以理说，我夜里见异象，看见天的四风陡起，刮在大海之上。</p>
<p>Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the
four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea.</p>
<p>7:3 有四个大兽从海中上来，形状各有不同，</p>
<p>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
another.</p>
<p>7:4
头一个像狮子，有鹰的翅膀。我正观看的时候，兽的翅膀被拔去，兽从地上得立起来，用两脚站立，像人一样，又得了人心。</p>
<p>The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the
wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and
made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to
it.</p>
<p>7:5
又有一兽如熊，就是第二兽，旁跨而坐，口齿内衔着三根肋骨。有吩咐这兽的说，起来吞吃多肉。</p>
<p>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up
itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the
teeth of it: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.</p>
<p>7:6
此后我观看，又有一兽如豹，背上有鸟的四个翅膀。这兽有四个头，又得了权柄。</p>
<p>After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had upon
the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and
dominion was given to it.</p>
<p>7:7
其后我在夜间的异象中观看，见第四兽甚是可怕，极其强壮，大有力量，有大铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。这兽与前三兽大不相同，头有十角。</p>
<p>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast,
dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron
teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with the
feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it;
and it had ten horns.</p>
<p>7:8
我正观看这些角，见其中又长起一个小角。先前的角中有三角在这角前，连根被它拔出来。这角有眼，像人的眼，有口说夸大的话。</p>
<p>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another
little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up
by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man,
and a mouth speaking great things.</p>
<p>7:9
我观看，见有宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者。他的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛。宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烈火。</p>
<p>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did
sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the
pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as
burning fire.</p>
<p>7:10
从他面前有火，像河发出。事奉他的有千千，在他面前侍立的有万万。他坐着要行审判，案卷都展开了。</p>
<p>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood
before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</p>
<p>7:11
那时我观看，见那兽因小角说夸大话的声音被杀，身体损坏，扔在火中焚烧。</p>
<p>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn
spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed,
and given to the burning flame.</p>
<p>7:12 其馀的兽，权柄都被夺去，生命却仍存留，直到所定的时候和日期。</p>
<p>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken
away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</p>
<p>7:13
我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，被领到亘古常在者面前，</p>
<p>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
brought him near before him.</p>
<p>7:14
得了权柄，荣耀，国度，使各方，各国，各族的人都事奉他。他的权柄是永远的，不能废去。他的国必不败坏。</p>
<p>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all
people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that
which shall not be destroyed.</p>
<p>7:15 至于我但以理，我的灵在我里面愁烦，我脑中的异象使我惊惶。</p>
<p>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and the
visions of my head troubled me.</p>
<p>7:16
我就近一位侍立者，问他这一切的真情。他就告诉我，将那事的讲解给我说明。</p>
<p>I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth
of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the
things.</p>
<p>7:17 这四个大兽就是四王将要在世上兴起。</p>
<p>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise
out of the earth.</p>
<p>7:18 然而，至高者的圣民，必要得国享受，直到永永远远。</p>
<p>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess
the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</p>
<p>7:19
那时我愿知道第四兽的真情，它为何与那三兽的真情大不相同，甚是可怕，有铁牙铜爪，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。</p>
<p>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse
from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and
his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the
residue with his feet;</p>
<p>7:20
头有十角和那另长的一角，在这角前有三角被它打落。这角有眼，有说夸大话的口，形状强横，过于它的同类。</p>
<p>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which
came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes,
and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than
his fellows.</p>
<p>7:21 我观看，见这角与圣民争战，胜了他们。</p>
<p>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed
against them;</p>
<p>7:22 直到亘古常在者来给至高者的圣民伸冤，圣民得国的时候就到了。</p>
<p>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints
of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the
kingdom.</p>
<p>7:23
那侍立者这样说，第四兽就是世上必有的第四国，与一切国大不相同，必吞吃全地，并且践踏嚼碎。</p>
<p>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon
earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the
whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
<p>7:24
至于那十角，就是从这国中必兴起的十王，后来又兴起一王，与先前的不同。他必制伏三王。</p>
<p>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise:
and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the
first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p>
<p>7:25
他必向至高者说夸大的话，必折磨至高者的圣民，必想改变节期和律法。圣民必交付他手一载，二载，半载。</p>
<p>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear
out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and
they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the
dividing of time.</p>
<p>7:26
然而，审判者必坐着行审判。他的权柄必被夺去，毁坏，灭绝，一直到底。</p>
<p>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to
consume and to destroy it unto the end.</p>
<p>7:27
国度，权柄，和天下诸国的大权必赐给至高者的圣民。他的国是永远的。一切掌权的都必事奉他，顺从他。</p>
<p>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under
the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most
High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall
serve and obey him.</p>
<p>7:28
那事至此完毕。至于我但以理，心中甚是惊惶，脸色也改变了，却将那事存记在心。</p>
<p>Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations
much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the
matter in my heart.</p>
