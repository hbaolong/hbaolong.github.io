<h4 id="旧约-历代记下2-chronicles-第-24-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
历代记下(2 Chronicles) – 第 24 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>24:1
约阿施登基的时候年七岁，在耶路撒冷作王四十年。他母亲名叫西比亚，是别是巴人。</p>
<p>Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Zibiah of
Beersheba.</p>
<p>24:2 祭司耶何耶大在世的时候，约阿施行耶和华眼中看为正的事。</p>
<p>And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the
days of Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p>24:3 耶何耶大为他娶了两个妻，并且生儿养女。</p>
<p>And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
daughters.</p>
<p>24:4 此后，约阿施有意重修耶和华的殿，</p>
<p>And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the
house of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:5
便召聚众祭司和利未人，吩咐他们说，你们要往犹大各城去，使以色列众人捐纳银子，每年可以修理你们神的殿。你们要急速办理这事。只是利未人不急速办理。</p>
<p>And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to
them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to
repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten
the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.</p>
<p>24:6
王召了大祭司耶何耶大来，对他说，从前耶和华的仆人摩西，为法柜的帐幕与以色列会众所定的捐项，你为何不叫利未人照这例从犹大和耶路撒冷带来作殿的费用呢。</p>
<p>And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why
hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out
of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the
servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the
tabernacle of witness?</p>
<p>24:7
因为那恶妇亚他利雅的众子曾拆毁神的殿，又用耶和华殿中分别为圣的物供奉巴力。</p>
<p>For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house
of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did
they bestow upon Baalim.</p>
<p>24:8 于是王下令，众人作了一柜，放在耶和华殿的门外，</p>
<p>And at the king’s commandment they made a chest, and set it without
at the gate of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:9
又通告犹大和耶路撒冷的百姓，要将神仆人摩西在旷野所吩咐以色列人的捐项给耶和华送来。</p>
<p>And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in
to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon
Israel in the wilderness.</p>
<p>24:10 众首领和百姓都欢欢喜喜地将银子送来，投入柜中，直到捐完。</p>
<p>And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and
cast into the chest, until they had made an end.</p>
<p>24:11
利未人见银子多了，就把柜抬到王所派的司事面前。王的书记和大祭司的属员来将柜倒空，仍放在原处。日日都是这样，积蓄的银子甚多。</p>
<p>Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the
king’s office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there
was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and
emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus
they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.</p>
<p>24:12
王与耶何耶大将银子交给耶和华殿里办事的人，他们就雇了石匠，木匠重修耶和华的殿，又雇了铁匠，铜匠修理耶和华的殿。</p>
<p>And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the
service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to
repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to
mend the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:13 工人操作，渐渐修成，将神殿修造得与从前一样，而且甚是坚固。</p>
<p>So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they
set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.</p>
<p>24:14
工程完了，他们就把其馀的银子拿到王与耶何耶大面前，用以制造耶和华殿供奉所用的器皿和调羹，并金银的器皿。耶何耶大在世的时候，众人常在耶和华殿里献燔祭。</p>
<p>And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money
before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of
the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and
vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the
house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.</p>
<p>24:15 耶何耶大年纪老迈，日子满足而死。死的时候年一百三十岁，</p>
<p>But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred
and thirty years old was he when he died.</p>
<p>24:16
葬在大卫城列王的坟墓里。因为他在以色列人中行善，又事奉神，修理神的殿。</p>
<p>And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he
had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.</p>
<p>24:17 耶何耶大死后，犹大的众首领来朝拜王。王就听从他们。</p>
<p>Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made
obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.</p>
<p>24:18
他们离弃耶和华他们列祖神的殿，去事奉亚舍拉和偶像。因他们这罪，就有忿怒临到犹大和耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served
groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their
trespass.</p>
<p>24:19
但神仍遣先知到他们那里，引导他们归向耶和华。这先知警戒他们，他们却不肯听。</p>
<p>Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and
they testified against them: but they would not give ear.</p>
<p>24:20
那时，神的灵感动祭司耶何耶大的儿子撒迦利亚，他就站在上面对民说，神如此说，你们为何干犯耶和华的诫命，以致不得亨通呢。因为你们离弃耶和华，所以他也离弃你们。</p>
<p>And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the
priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith
God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot
prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken
you.</p>
<p>24:21
众民同心谋害撒迦利亚，就照王的吩咐，在耶和华殿的院内用石头打死他。</p>
<p>And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the
commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:22
这样，约阿施王不想念撒迦利亚的父亲耶何耶大向自己所施的恩，杀了他的儿子。撒迦利亚临死的时候说，愿耶和华鉴察伸冤。</p>
<p>Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his
father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The
LORD look upon it, and require it.</p>
<p>24:23
满了一年，亚兰的军兵上来攻击约阿施，来到犹大和耶路撒冷，杀了民中的众首领，将所掠的财货送到大马士革王那里。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria
came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed
all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the
spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.</p>
<p>24:24
亚兰的军兵虽来了一小队，耶和华却将大队的军兵交在他们手里，是因犹大人离弃耶和华他们列祖的神，所以藉亚兰人惩罚约阿施。</p>
<p>For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the
LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had
forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment
against Joash.</p>
<p>24:25
亚兰人离开约阿施的时候，他患重病。臣仆背叛他，要报祭司耶何耶大儿子流血之仇，杀他在床上，葬他在大卫城，只是不葬在列王的坟墓里。</p>
<p>And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great
diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the
sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and
they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the
sepulchres of the kings.</p>
<p>24:26
背叛他的是亚扪妇人示米押的儿子撒拔和摩押妇人示米利的儿子约萨拔。</p>
<p>And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of
Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
Moabitess.</p>
<p>24:27
至于他的众子和他所受的警戒，并他重修神殿的事，都写在列王的传上。他儿子亚玛谢接续他作王。</p>
<p>Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon
him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in
the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
