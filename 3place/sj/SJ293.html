<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-2-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 2 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 大卫的死期临近了，就嘱吩他儿子所罗门说，</p>
<p>Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
Solomon his son, saying,</p>
<p>2:2 我现在要走世人必走的路。所以，你当刚强，作大丈夫，</p>
<p>I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew
thyself a man;</p>
<p>2:3
遵守耶和华你神所吩咐的，照着摩西律法上所写的行主的道，谨守他的律例，诫命，典章，法度。这样，你无论作什么事，不拘往何处去，尽都亨通。</p>
<p>And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep
his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his
testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest
thyself:</p>
<p>2:4
耶和华必成就向我所应许的话说，你的子孙若谨慎自己的行为，尽心尽意诚诚实实地行在我面前，就不断人坐以色列的国位。</p>
<p>That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me,
saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in
truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail
thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p>2:5
你知道洗鲁雅的儿子约押向我所行的，就是杀了以色列的两个元帅，尼珥的儿子押尼珥和益帖的儿子亚玛撒。他在太平之时流这二人的血，如在争战之时一样，将这血染了腰间束的带和脚上穿的鞋。</p>
<p>Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,
and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner
the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed
the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that
was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>
<p>2:6 所以你要照你的智慧行，不容他白头安然下阴间。</p>
<p>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go
down to the grave in peace.</p>
<p>2:7
你当恩待基列人巴西莱的众子，使他们常与你同席吃饭。因为我躲避你哥哥押沙龙的时候，他们拿食物来迎接我。</p>
<p>But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let
them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I
fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>
<p>2:8
在你这里有巴户琳的便雅悯人，基拉的儿子示每。我往玛哈念去的那日，他用狠毒的言语咒骂我，后来却下约旦河迎接我，我就指着耶和华向他起誓说，我必不用刀杀你。</p>
<p>And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite
of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went
to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him
by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p>
<p>2:9
现在你不要以他为无罪。你是聪明人，必知道怎样待他，使他白头见杀，流血下到阴间。</p>
<p>Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and
knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
down to the grave with blood.</p>
<p>2:10 大卫与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城。</p>
<p>So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David.</p>
<p>2:11
大卫作以色列王四十年，在希伯仑作王七年，在耶路撒冷作王三十三年。</p>
<p>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven
years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2:12 所罗门坐他父亲大卫的位，他的国甚是坚固。</p>
<p>Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
was established greatly.</p>
<p>2:13
哈及的儿子亚多尼雅去见所罗门的母亲拔示巴，拔示巴问他说，你来是为平安吗。回答说，是为平安。</p>
<p>And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
Peaceably.</p>
<p>2:14 又说，我有话对你说。拔示巴说，你说吧。</p>
<p>He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say
on.</p>
<p>2:15
亚多尼雅说，你知道国原是归我的，以色列众人也都仰望我作王，不料，国反归了我兄弟，因他得国是出乎耶和华。</p>
<p>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all
Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom
is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the
LORD.</p>
<p>2:16 现在我有一件事求你，望你不要推辞。拔示巴说，你说吧。</p>
<p>And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto
him, Say on.</p>
<p>2:17
他说，求你请所罗门王将书念的女子亚比煞赐我为妻，因他必不推辞你。</p>
<p>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will
not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p>
<p>2:18 拔示巴说，好，我必为你对王提说。</p>
<p>And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>
<p>2:19
于是，拔示巴去见所罗门王，要为亚多尼雅提说。王起来迎接，向她下拜，就坐在位上，吩咐人为王母设一座位，她便坐在王的右边。</p>
<p>Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her,
and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s
mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>
<p>2:20
拔示巴说，我有一件小事求你，望你不要推辞。王说，请母亲说，我必不推辞。</p>
<p>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say
me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will
not say thee nay.</p>
<p>2:21 拔示巴说，求你将书念的女子亚比煞赐给你哥哥亚多尼雅为妻。</p>
<p>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
brother to wife.</p>
<p>2:22
所罗门王对他母亲说，为何单替他求书念的女子亚比煞呢。也可以为他求国吧。他是我的哥哥，他有祭司亚比亚他和洗鲁雅的儿子约押为辅佐。</p>
<p>And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou
ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also;
for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest,
and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>
<p>2:23
所罗门王就指着耶和华起誓说，亚多尼雅这话是自己送命，不然，愿神重重地降罚与我。</p>
<p>Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and
more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own
life.</p>
<p>2:24
耶和华坚立我，使我坐在父亲大卫的位上，照着所应许的话为我建立家室。现在我指着永生的耶和华起誓，亚多尼雅今日必被治死。</p>
<p>Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set
me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as
he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>
<p>2:25 于是所罗门王差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，将亚多尼雅杀死。</p>
<p>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and
he fell upon him that he died.</p>
<p>2:26
王对祭司亚比亚他说，你回亚拿突归自己的田地去吧。你本是该死的，但因你在我父亲大卫面前抬过主耶和华的约柜，又与我父亲同受一切苦难，所以我今日不将你杀死。</p>
<p>And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,
unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORD God
before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all
wherein my father was afflicted.</p>
<p>2:27
所罗门就革除亚比亚他，不许他作耶和华的祭司。这样，便应验耶和华在示罗论以利家所说的话。</p>
<p>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that
he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the
house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p>2:28
约押虽然没有归从押沙龙，却归从了亚多尼雅。他听见这风声，就逃到耶和华的帐幕，抓住祭坛的角。</p>
<p>Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though
he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the
LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p>2:29
有人告诉所罗门王说，约押逃到耶和华的帐幕，现今在祭坛的旁边。所罗门就差遣耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，说，你去将他杀死。</p>
<p>And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle
of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p>
<p>2:30
比拿雅来到耶和华的帐幕，对约押说，王吩咐说，你出来吧。他说，我不出去，我要死在这里。比拿雅就去回覆王，说约押如此如此回答我。</p>
<p>And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him,
Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here.
And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and
thus he answered me.</p>
<p>2:31
王说，你可以照着他的话行，杀死他，将他葬埋，好叫约押流无辜人血的罪不归我和我的父家了。</p>
<p>And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him,
and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab
shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
<p>2:32
耶和华必使约押流人血的罪归到他自己的头上。因为他用刀杀了两个比他又义又好的人，就是以色列元帅尼珥的儿子押尼珥和犹大元帅益帖的儿子亚玛撒，我父亲大卫却不知道。</p>
<p>And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon
two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword,
my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner,
captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of
the host of Judah.</p>
<p>2:33
故此，流这二人血的罪必归到约押和他后裔的头上，直到永远。惟有大卫和他的后裔，并他的家与国，必从耶和华那里得平安，直到永远。</p>
<p>Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon
the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and
upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from
the LORD.</p>
<p>2:34
于是耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅上去，将约押杀死，葬在旷野约押自己的坟墓（原文作房屋）里。</p>
<p>So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew
him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
<p>2:35
王就立耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅作元帅，代替约押，又使祭司撒督代替亚比亚他。</p>
<p>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the
host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.</p>
<p>2:36
王差遣人将示每召来，对他说，你要在耶路撒冷建造房屋居住，不可出来往别处去。</p>
<p>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build
thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any
whither.</p>
<p>2:37
你当确实地知道，你何日出来过汲沦溪，何日必死。你的罪（原文作血）必归到自己的头上。</p>
<p>For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest over the
brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die:
thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p>
<p>2:38
示每对王说，这话甚好。我主我王怎样说，仆人必怎样行。于是示每多日住在耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord the
king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem
many days.</p>
<p>2:39
过了三年，示每的两个仆人逃到迦特王玛迦的儿子亚吉那里去。有人告诉示每说，你的仆人在迦特。</p>
<p>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And
they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</p>
<p>2:40
示每起来，备上驴，往迦特到亚吉那里去找他的仆人，就从迦特带他仆人回来。</p>
<p>And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from
Gath.</p>
<p>2:41 有人告诉所罗门说，示每出耶路撒冷往迦特去，回来了。</p>
<p>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath,
and was come again.</p>
<p>2:42
王就差遣人将示每召了来，对他说，我岂不是叫你指着耶和华起誓，并且警戒你说你当确实地知道，你哪日出来往别处去，那日必死吗。你也对我说，这话甚好，我必听从。</p>
<p>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not
make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know
for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard is good.</p>
<p>2:43 现在你为何不遵守你指着耶和华起的誓和我所吩咐你的命令呢。</p>
<p>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment
that I have charged thee with?</p>
<p>2:44
王又对示每说，你向我父亲大卫所行的一切恶事，你自己心里也知道，所以耶和华必使你的罪恶归到自己的头上。</p>
<p>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness
which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father:
therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;</p>
<p>2:45
惟有所罗门王必得福，并且大卫的国位必在耶和华面前坚定，直到永远。</p>
<p>And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be
established before the LORD for ever.</p>
<p>2:46
于是王吩咐耶何耶大的儿子比拿雅，他就去杀死示每。这样，便坚定了所罗门的国位。</p>
<p>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out,
and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the
hand of Solomon.</p>
