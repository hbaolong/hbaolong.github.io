<h4 id="旧约-士师记judges-第-18-章-本篇共有-21-章">旧约 – 士师记(Judges)
– 第 18 章 ( 本篇共有 21 章 )</h4>
<p>18:1
那时，以色列中没有王。但支派的人仍是寻地居住。因为到那日子，他们还没有在以色列支派中得地为业。</p>
<p>In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the
tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto
that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes
of Israel.</p>
<p>18:2
但人从琐拉和以实陶打发本族中的五个勇士，去仔细窥探那地，吩咐他们说，你们去窥探那地。他们来到以法莲山地，进了米迦的住宅，就在那里住宿。</p>
<p>And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their
coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the
land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:
who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged
there.</p>
<p>18:3
他们临近米迦的住宅，听出那少年利未人的口音来，就进去问他说，谁领你到这里来。你在这里作什么。你在这里得什么。</p>
<p>When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the
young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who
brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what hast
thou here?</p>
<p>18:4 他回答说，米迦待我如此如此，请我作祭司。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath
hired me, and I am his priest.</p>
<p>18:5 他们对他说，请你求问神，使我们知道所行的道路通达不通达。</p>
<p>And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we
may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.</p>
<p>18:6
祭司对他们说，你们可以平平安安地去，你们所行的道路是在耶和华面前的。</p>
<p>And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is your
way wherein ye go.</p>
<p>18:7
五人就走了，来到拉亿，见那里的民安居无虑，如同西顿人安居一样。在那地没有人掌权扰乱他们。他们离西顿人也远，与别人没有来往。</p>
<p>Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people
that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the
Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,
that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the
Zidonians, and had no business with any man.</p>
<p>18:8
五人回到琐拉和以实陶，见他们的弟兄。弟兄问他们说，你们有什么话。</p>
<p>And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their
brethren said unto them, What say ye?</p>
<p>18:9
他们回答说，起来，我们上去攻击他们吧。我们已经窥探那地，见那地甚好。你们为何静坐不动呢。要急速前往得那地为业，不可迟延。</p>
<p>And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have
seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye still? be not
slothful to go, and to enter to possess the land.</p>
<p>18:10
你们到了那里，必看见安居无虑的民，地也宽阔。神已将那地交在你们手中。那地百物俱全，一无所缺。</p>
<p>When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land:
for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no want of
any thing that is in the earth.</p>
<p>18:11 于是但族中的六百人，各带兵器，从琐拉和以实陶前往，</p>
<p>And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah
and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war.</p>
<p>18:12
上到犹大的基列耶琳，在基列耶琳后边安营。因此那地方名叫玛哈尼但，直到今日。</p>
<p>And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore
they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it is behind
Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p>18:13 他们从那里往以法莲山地去，来到米迦的住宅。</p>
<p>And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of
Micah.</p>
<p>18:14
从前窥探拉亿地的五个人对他们的弟兄说，这宅子里有以弗得和家中的神像，并雕刻的像与铸成的像，你们知道吗。现在你们要想一想当怎样行。</p>
<p>Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish,
and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses
an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now
therefore consider what ye have to do.</p>
<p>18:15 五人就进入米迦的住宅，到了那少年利未人的房内问他好。</p>
<p>And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man
the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.</p>
<p>18:16 那六百但人各带兵器，站在门口。</p>
<p>And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which
were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.</p>
<p>18:17
窥探地的五个人走进去，将雕刻的像，以弗得，家中的神像，并铸成的像，都拿了去。祭司和带兵器的六百人，一同站在门口。</p>
<p>And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came in
thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and
the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with
the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war.</p>
<p>18:18
那五个人进入米迦的住宅，拿出雕刻的像，以弗得，家中的神像，并铸成的像，祭司就问他们说，你们作什么呢。</p>
<p>And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image, the
ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto
them, What do ye?</p>
<p>18:19
他们回答说，不要作声，用手捂口，跟我们去吧。我们必以你为父，为祭司。你作一家的祭司好呢。还是作以色列一族一支派的祭司好呢。</p>
<p>And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy
mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better
for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a
priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?</p>
<p>18:20
祭司心里喜悦，便拿着以弗得和家中的神像，并雕刻的像，进入他们中间。</p>
<p>And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the
teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</p>
<p>18:21 他们就转身离开那里，妻子，儿女，牲畜，财物都在前头。</p>
<p>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle
and the carriage before them.</p>
<p>18:22 离米迦的住宅已远，米迦的近邻都聚集来，追赶但人，</p>
<p>And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that
were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together, and
overtook the children of Dan.</p>
<p>18:23 呼叫但人。但人回头问米迦说，你聚集这许多人来作什么呢。</p>
<p>And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces,
and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a
company?</p>
<p>18:24
米迦说，你们将我所作的神像和祭司都带了去，我还有所剩的吗。怎吗还问我说作什么呢。</p>
<p>And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest,
and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that ye say
unto me, What aileth thee?</p>
<p>18:25
但人对米迦说，你不要使我们听见你的声音，恐怕有性暴的人攻击你，以致你和你的全家尽都丧命。</p>
<p>And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard
among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with
the lives of thy household.</p>
<p>18:26
但人还是走他们的路。米迦见他们的势力比自己强盛，就转身回家去了。</p>
<p>And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they
were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.</p>
<p>18:27
但人将米迦所作的神像和他的祭司都带到拉亿，见安居无虑的民，就用刀杀了那民，又放火烧了那城，</p>
<p>And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which
he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and
secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the
city with fire.</p>
<p>18:28
并无人搭救。因为离西顿远，他们又与别人没有来往。城在平原，那平原靠近伯利合。但人又在那里修城居住，</p>
<p>And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they
had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth by
Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.</p>
<p>18:29
照着他们始祖以色列之子但的名字，给那城起名叫但。原先那城名叫拉亿。</p>
<p>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their
father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city was Laish
at the first.</p>
<p>18:30
但人就为自己设立那雕刻的像。摩西的孙子，革舜的儿子约拿单，和他的子孙作但支派的祭司，直到那地遭掳掠的日子。</p>
<p>And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the
son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the
tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</p>
<p>18:31
神的殿在示罗多少日子，但人为自己设立米迦所雕刻的像也在但多少日子。</p>
<p>And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the
time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</p>
