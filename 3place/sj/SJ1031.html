<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-13-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 13 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>13:1
在安提阿的教会中，有几位先知和教师，就是巴拿巴，和称呼尼结的西面，古利奈人路求，与分封之王希律同养的马念，并扫罗。</p>
<p>Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and
teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch,
and Saul.</p>
<p>13:2
他们事奉主，禁食的时候，圣灵说，要为我分派巴拿巴和扫罗，去作我召他们所作的工。</p>
<p>As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,
Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called
them.</p>
<p>13:3 于是禁食祷告，按手在他们头上，就打发他们去了。</p>
<p>And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them,
they sent them away.</p>
<p>13:4 他们既被圣灵差遣，就下到西流基，从那里坐船往塞浦路斯去。</p>
<p>So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto Seleucia;
and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</p>
<p>13:5
到了撒拉米，就在犹太人各会堂里传讲神的道。也有约翰作他们的帮手。</p>
<p>And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the
synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p>
<p>13:6
经过全岛，直到帕弗，在那里遇见一个有法术假充先知的犹太人，名叫巴耶稣。</p>
<p>And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a
certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:</p>
<p>13:7
这人常和方伯士求保罗同在，士求保罗是个通达人。他请了巴拿巴和扫罗来，要听神的道。</p>
<p>Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent
man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of
God.</p>
<p>13:8
只是那行法术的吕马，（这名翻出来就是行法术的意思）敌挡使徒，要叫方伯不信真道。</p>
<p>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)
withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p>
<p>13:9 扫罗又名保罗，被圣灵充满定睛看他，</p>
<p>Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost, set
his eyes on him,</p>
<p>13:10
说，你这充满各样诡诈奸恶，魔鬼的儿子，众善得仇敌，你混乱主的正道还不止住吗。</p>
<p>And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of the
devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert
the right ways of the Lord?</p>
<p>13:11
现在主的手加在你身上。你要瞎眼，暂且不见日光。他的眼睛立刻昏蒙黑暗，四下里求人拉着手领他。</p>
<p>And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be
blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on
him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by
the hand.</p>
<p>13:12 方伯看见所作的事，很希奇主的道，就信了。</p>
<p>Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being
astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
<p>13:13
保罗和他的同人，从帕弗开船，来到旁非利亚的别加。约翰就离开他们回耶路撒冷去。</p>
<p>Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga
in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>13:14
他们离了别加往前行，来到彼西底的安提阿。在安息日进会堂作下。</p>
<p>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia,
and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</p>
<p>13:15
读完了律法先知的书，管会堂的叫人过去，对他们说，二位兄台，若有什么劝勉众人的话，请说。</p>
<p>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the
synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any
word of exhortation for the people, say on.</p>
<p>13:16 保罗就起来，举手说，以色列人，和一切敬畏神的人，请听。</p>
<p>Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel,
and ye that fear God, give audience.</p>
<p>13:17
这以色列民的神，拣选了我们的祖宗，当民寄居埃及的时候，抬举他们，用大能的手领他们出来。</p>
<p>The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the
people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an
high arm brought he them out of it.</p>
<p>13:18 又在旷野容忍他们约有四十年。（容忍或作抚养）</p>
<p>And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>13:19 既灭了迦南地七族的人，就把那地分给他们为业。</p>
<p>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan, he
divided their land to them by lot.</p>
<p>13:20
此后，给他们设立士师，约有四百五十年，直到先知撒母耳的时候。</p>
<p>And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four
hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</p>
<p>13:21
后来他们求一个王，神就将便雅悯支派中，基士的儿子扫罗，给他们作王四十年。</p>
<p>And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the
son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty
years.</p>
<p>13:22
既废了扫罗，就选立大卫作他们的王。又为他作见证说，我寻得耶西的儿子大卫，他是合我心意的人，凡事要遵行我的旨意。</p>
<p>And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their
king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the
son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall fulfil all my
will.</p>
<p>13:23
从这人的后裔中，神已经照着所应许的，为以色列人立了一位救主，就是耶稣。</p>
<p>Of this man’s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto
Israel a Saviour, Jesus:</p>
<p>13:24 在他没有出来以先，约翰向以色列众民宣讲悔改的洗礼。</p>
<p>When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of
repentance to all the people of Israel.</p>
<p>13:25
约翰将行尽他的程途说，你们以为我是谁，我不是基督。只是有一位在我以后来的，我解他脚上的鞋带，也是不配的。</p>
<p>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I
am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of his
feet I am not worthy to loose.</p>
<p>13:26
弟兄们，亚伯拉罕的子孙，和你们中间敬畏神的人哪，这救世的道，是传给我们的。</p>
<p>Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever
among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.</p>
<p>13:27
耶路撒冷居住的人，和他们的官长，因为不认识基督，也不明白每日安息日所读众先知的书，就把基督定了死罪，正应了先知的预言。</p>
<p>For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew
him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath
day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</p>
<p>13:28 虽然查不出他有当死的罪来，还是求彼拉多杀他。</p>
<p>And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain.</p>
<p>13:29
既成就了经上指着他所记的一切话，就把他从木头上取下来，放在坟墓里。</p>
<p>And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took
him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</p>
<p>13:30 神却叫他从死里复活。</p>
<p>But God raised him from the dead:</p>
<p>13:31
那从加利利同上耶路撒冷的人多日看见他，这些人如今在民间是他的见证。</p>
<p>And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee
to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</p>
<p>13:32 我们也报好信息给你们，就是那应许祖宗的话，</p>
<p>And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was
made unto the fathers,</p>
<p>13:33
神已经向我们这作儿女的应验，叫耶稣复活了。正如诗篇第二篇上记着说，你是我的儿子，我今日生你。</p>
<p>God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath
raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou
art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</p>
<p>13:34
论到神叫他从死里复活，不再归于朽坏，就这样说，我必将所应许大卫那圣洁可靠的恩典，赐给你们。</p>
<p>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to
return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure
mercies of David.</p>
<p>13:35 又有一篇上说，你必不叫你的圣者见朽坏。</p>
<p>Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer thine
Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p>13:36
大卫在世的时候，遵行了神的旨意，就睡了，（或作大卫按神的旨意服事了他那一世的人就睡了）。归到他祖宗那里，已经见朽坏。</p>
<p>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God,
fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</p>
<p>13:37 惟独神所复活的，他并未见朽坏。</p>
<p>But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</p>
<p>13:38 所以弟兄们，你们当晓得，赦罪的道是由这人传给你们的。</p>
<p>Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this
man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</p>
<p>13:39
你们靠摩西的律法，在一切不得称义的事上，信靠这人，就都称义了。</p>
<p>And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which
ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.</p>
<p>13:40 所以你们务要小心，免得先知书上所说的临到你们。</p>
<p>Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the
prophets;</p>
<p>13:41
主说，你们这轻慢的人要观看，要惊奇，要灭亡。因为在你们的时候，我行一件事，虽有人告诉你们，你们总是不信。</p>
<p>Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in
your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man
declare it unto you.</p>
<p>13:42 他们出会堂的时候，众人请他们到下安息日，再讲这话给他们听。</p>
<p>And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles
besought that these words might be preached to them the next
sabbath.</p>
<p>13:43
散会以后，犹太人和敬虔进犹太教的人，多有跟从保罗，巴拿巴的，二人对他们讲道，劝他们务要恒久在神的恩中。</p>
<p>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and
religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them,
persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</p>
<p>13:44 到下安息日，合城的人，几乎都来聚集，要听神的道。</p>
<p>And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear
the word of God.</p>
<p>13:45
但犹太人看见人这样多，就满心嫉妒，硬驳保罗所说的话，并毁谤。</p>
<p>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and
spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and
blaspheming.</p>
<p>13:46
保罗和巴拿巴放胆说，神的道先讲给你们，原是应当的，只因你们弃绝这道，断定自己不配得永生，我们就转向外邦人去。</p>
<p>Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that
the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put
it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we
turn to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>13:47
因为主曾这样吩咐我们说，我已经立你作外邦人的光，叫你施行救恩直到地极。</p>
<p>For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a
light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the
ends of the earth.</p>
<p>13:48
外邦人听见这话，就欢喜了，赞美神的道，凡豫定得永生的人都信了。</p>
<p>And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the
word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life
believed.</p>
<p>13:49 于是主的道，传遍了那一带地方。</p>
<p>And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.</p>
<p>13:50
但犹太人挑唆虔敬尊贵的妇女，和城内有名望的人，逼迫保罗，巴拿巴，将他们赶出境外。</p>
<p>But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the
chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them out of their coasts.</p>
<p>13:51 二人对着众人跺下脚上的尘土，就往以哥念去了。</p>
<p>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto
Iconium.</p>
<p>13:52 门徒满心喜乐，又被圣灵充满。</p>
<p>And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.</p>
