<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-14-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 14 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>14:1 那时，耶罗波安的儿子亚比雅病了。</p>
<p>At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>
<p>14:2
耶罗波安对他的妻说，你可以起来改装，使人不知道你是耶罗波安的妻，往示罗去，在那里有先知亚希雅。他曾告诉我说，你必作这民的王。</p>
<p>And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee
to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I
should be king over this people.</p>
<p>14:3
现在你要带十个饼，与几个薄饼，和一瓶蜜去见他，他必告诉你儿子将要怎样。</p>
<p>And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey,
and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child.</p>
<p>14:4
耶罗波安的妻就这样行，起身往示罗去，到了亚希雅的家。亚希雅因年纪老迈，眼目发直，不能看见。</p>
<p>And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came
to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set
by reason of his age.</p>
<p>14:5
耶和华先晓谕亚希雅说，耶罗波安的妻要来问你，因她儿子病了，你当如此如此告诉她。她进来的时候必装作别的妇人。</p>
<p>And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to
ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt
thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall
feign herself to be another woman.</p>
<p>14:6
她刚进门，亚希雅听见她脚步的响声，就说，耶罗波安的妻，进来吧。你为何装作别的妇人呢。我奉差遣将凶事告诉你。</p>
<p>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came
in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy
tidings.</p>
<p>14:7
你回去告诉耶罗波安说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，我从民中将你高举，立你作我民以色列的君，</p>
<p>Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I
exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people
Israel,</p>
<p>14:8
将国从大卫家夺回赐给你。你却不效法我仆人大卫，遵守我的诫命，一心顺从我，行我眼中看为正的事。</p>
<p>And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee:
and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my
commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only
which was right in mine eyes;</p>
<p>14:9
你竟行恶，比那在你以先的更甚，为自己立了别神，铸了偶像，惹我发怒，将我丢在背后。</p>
<p>But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast
gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to
anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>
<p>14:10
因此，我必使灾祸临到耶罗波安的家，将属耶罗波安的男丁，无论困住的，自由的都从以色列中剪除，必除尽耶罗波安的家，如人除尽粪土一般。</p>
<p>Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and
will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him
that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of
the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all
gone.</p>
<p>14:11
凡属耶罗波安的人，死在城中的必被狗吃，死在田野的必被空中的鸟吃。这是耶和华说的。</p>
<p>Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him
that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD
hath spoken it.</p>
<p>14:12 所以你起身回家去吧。你的脚一进城，你儿子就必死了。</p>
<p>Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet
enter into the city, the child shall die.</p>
<p>14:13
以色列众人必为他哀哭，将他葬埋。凡属耶罗波安的人，惟有他得入坟墓。因为在耶罗波安的家中，只有他向耶和华以色列的神显出善行。</p>
<p>And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some
good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</p>
<p>14:14
耶和华必另立一王治理以色列。到了日期，他必剪除耶罗波安的家。那日期已经到了。</p>
<p>Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall
cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</p>
<p>14:15
耶和华必击打以色列人，使他们摇动，像水中的芦苇一般。又将他们从耶和华赐给他们列祖的美地上拔出来，分散在大河那边。因为他们作木偶，惹耶和华发怒。</p>
<p>For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water,
and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to
their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they
have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</p>
<p>14:16
因耶罗波安所犯的罪，又使以色列人陷在罪里，耶和华必将以色列人交给仇敌。</p>
<p>And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did
sin, and who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>14:17 耶罗波安的妻起身回去，到了得撒，刚到门槛，儿子就死了。</p>
<p>And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when
she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;</p>
<p>14:18
以色列众人将他葬埋，为他哀哭，正如耶和华藉他仆人先知亚希雅所说的话。</p>
<p>And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the
word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
prophet.</p>
<p>14:19
耶罗波安其馀的事，他怎样争战，怎样作王，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.</p>
<p>14:20
耶罗波安作王二十二年，就与他列祖同睡。他儿子拿答接续他作王。</p>
<p>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he
slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>14:21
所罗门的儿子罗波安作犹大王。他登基的时候年四十一岁，在耶路撒冷，就是耶和华从以色列众支派中所选择立他名的城，作王十七年。罗波安的母亲名叫拿玛，是亚扪人。</p>
<p>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty
and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years
in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes
of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name was Naamah an
Ammonitess.</p>
<p>14:22
犹大人行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，犯罪触动他的愤恨，比他们列祖更甚。</p>
<p>And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to
jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their
fathers had done.</p>
<p>14:23 因为他们在各高冈上，各青翠树下筑坛，立柱像和木偶。</p>
<p>For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on
every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
<p>14:24
国中也有娈童。犹大人效法耶和华在以色列人面前所赶出的外邦人，行一切可憎恶的事。</p>
<p>And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to
all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>14:25 罗波安王第五年，埃及王示撒上来攻取耶路撒冷，</p>
<p>And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak
king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</p>
<p>14:26
夺了耶和华殿和王宫里的宝物，尽都带走，又夺去所罗门制造的金盾牌。</p>
<p>And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the
treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away
all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
<p>14:27 罗波安王制造铜盾牌代替那金盾牌，交给守王宫门的护卫长看守。</p>
<p>And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed
them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of
the king’s house.</p>
<p>14:28
王每逢进耶和华的殿，护卫兵就拿这盾牌，随后仍将盾牌送回，放在护卫房。</p>
<p>And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that
the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.</p>
<p>14:29 罗波安其馀的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>14:30 罗波安与耶罗波安时常争战。</p>
<p>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</p>
<p>14:31
罗波安与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他母亲名叫拿玛，是亚扪人。他儿子亚比央（又名亚比雅）接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
