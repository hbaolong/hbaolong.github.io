<h4 id="旧约-列王记上1-kings-第-15-章-本篇共有-22-章">旧约 – 列王记上(1
Kings) – 第 15 章 ( 本篇共有 22 章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 尼八的儿子耶罗波安王十八年，亚比央登基作犹大王，</p>
<p>Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
Abijam over Judah.</p>
<p>15:2 在耶路撒冷作王三年。他母亲名叫玛迦，是押沙龙的女儿。</p>
<p>Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>
<p>15:3
亚比央行他父亲在他以前所行的一切恶，他的心不像他祖大卫的心，诚诚实实地顺服耶和华他的神。</p>
<p>And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before
him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart
of David his father.</p>
<p>15:4
然而耶和华他的神因大卫的缘故，仍使他在耶路撒冷有灯光，叫他儿子接续他作王，坚立耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem:</p>
<p>15:5
因为大卫除了赫人乌利亚那件事，都是行耶和华眼中看为正的事，一生没有违背耶和华一切所吩咐的。</p>
<p>Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, and
turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of
his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.</p>
<p>15:6 罗波安在世的日子常与耶罗波安争战。</p>
<p>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his
life.</p>
<p>15:7
亚比央其馀的事，凡他所行的，都写在犹大列王记上。亚比央常与耶罗波安争战。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there
was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</p>
<p>15:8 亚比央与他列祖同睡，葬在大卫的城里。他儿子亚撒接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:9 以色列王耶罗波安二十年，亚撒登基作犹大王，</p>
<p>And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
Judah.</p>
<p>15:10 在耶路撒冷作王四十一年。他祖母名叫玛迦，是押沙龙的女儿。</p>
<p>And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>
<p>15:11 亚撒效法他祖大卫行耶和华眼中看为正的事，</p>
<p>And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as did
David his father.</p>
<p>15:12 从国中除去娈童，又除掉他列祖所造的一切偶像。</p>
<p>And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the
idols that his fathers had made.</p>
<p>15:13
并且贬了他祖母玛迦太后的位，因她造了可憎的偶像亚舍拉。亚撒砍下她的偶像，烧在汲沦溪边，</p>
<p>And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being queen,
because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and
burnt it by the brook Kidron.</p>
<p>15:14 只是邱坛还没有废去。亚撒一生却向耶和华存诚实的心。</p>
<p>But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was
perfect with the LORD all his days.</p>
<p>15:15
亚撒将他父亲所分别为圣，与自己所分别为圣的金银和器皿，都奉到耶和华的殿里。</p>
<p>And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the
things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver,
and gold, and vessels.</p>
<p>15:16 亚撒和以色列王巴沙在世的日子常常争战。</p>
<p>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
days.</p>
<p>15:17
以色列王巴沙上来要攻击犹大，修筑拉玛，不许人从犹大王亚撒那里出入。</p>
<p>And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah,
that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of
Judah.</p>
<p>15:18
于是亚撒将耶和华殿和王宫府库里所剩下的金银都交在他臣仆手中，打发他们往住大马士革的亚兰王希旬的孙子，他伯利们的儿子便哈达那里去，</p>
<p>Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the
treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s
house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa
sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of
Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p>
<p>15:19
说，你父曾与我父立约，我与你也要立约。现在我将金银送你为礼物，求你废掉你与以色列王巴沙所立的约，使他离开我。</p>
<p>There is a league between me and thee, and between my father and thy
father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come
and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from
me.</p>
<p>15:20
便哈达听从亚撒王的话，派军长去攻击以色列的城邑。他们就攻破以云，但，亚伯伯玛迦，基尼烈全境，拿弗他利全境。</p>
<p>So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the
hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and
Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of
Naphtali.</p>
<p>15:21 巴沙听见，就停工不修筑拉玛了，仍住在得撒。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left off
building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</p>
<p>15:22
于是亚撒王宣告犹大众人，不准一个推辞，吩咐他们将巴沙修筑拉玛所用的石头，木头都运去，用以修筑便雅悯的迦巴和米斯巴。</p>
<p>Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none was
exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba
of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</p>
<p>15:23
亚撒其馀的事，凡他所行的，并他的勇力与他所建筑的城邑，都写在犹大列王记上。亚撒年老的时候，脚上有病。</p>
<p>The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he
did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his
old age he was diseased in his feet.</p>
<p>15:24
亚撒与他列祖同睡，葬在他祖大卫城他列祖的坟地里。他儿子约沙法接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>15:25 犹大王亚撒第二年，耶罗波安的儿子拿答登基作以色列王共二年，</p>
<p>And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the
second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.</p>
<p>15:26
拿答行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行他父亲所行的，犯他父亲使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>15:27
以萨迦人亚希雅的儿子巴沙背叛拿答，在非利士的基比顿杀了他。那时拿答和以色列众人正围困基比顿。</p>
<p>And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired
against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the
Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon.</p>
<p>15:28 在犹大王亚撒第三年巴沙杀了他，篡了他的位。</p>
<p>Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and
reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:29
巴沙一作王就杀了耶罗波安的全家，凡有气息的没有留下一个，都灭尽了，正应验耶和华藉他仆人示罗人亚希雅所说的话。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of
Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had
destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by
his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:</p>
<p>15:30
这是因为耶罗波安所犯的罪使以色列人陷在罪里，惹动耶和华以色列神的怒气。</p>
<p>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of
Israel to anger.</p>
<p>15:31 拿答其馀的事，凡他所行的，都写在以色列诸王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>15:32 亚撒和以色列王巴沙在世的日子常常争战。</p>
<p>And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their
days.</p>
<p>15:33
犹大王亚撒第三年，亚希雅的儿子巴沙在得撒登基作以色列众人的王共二十四年。</p>
<p>In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah
to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.</p>
<p>15:34
他行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，行耶罗波安所行的道，犯他使以色列人陷在罪里的那罪。</p>
<p>And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.</p>
