<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第37-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第37 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>37:1 雅各住在迦南地，就是他父亲寄居的地。</p>
<p>And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the
land of Canaan.</p>
<p>37:2
雅各的记略如下。约瑟十七岁与他哥哥们一同牧羊。他是个童子，与他父亲的妾辟拉，悉帕的儿子们常在一处。约瑟将他哥哥们的恶行报给他们的父亲。</p>
<p>These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years
old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the
sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</p>
<p>37:3
以色列原来爱约瑟过于爱他的众子，因为约瑟是他年老生的。他给约瑟作了一件彩衣。</p>
<p>Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was
the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.</p>
<p>37:4
约瑟的哥哥们见父亲爱约瑟过于爱他们，就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话。</p>
<p>And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all
his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto
him.</p>
<p>37:5 约瑟作了一梦，告诉他哥哥们，他们就越发恨他。</p>
<p>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they
hated him yet the more.</p>
<p>37:6 约瑟对他们说，请听我所作的梦，</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed:</p>
<p>37:7 我们在田里捆禾稼，我的捆起来站着，你们的捆来围着我的捆下拜。</p>
<p>For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf
arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round
about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</p>
<p>37:8
他的哥哥们回答说，难道你真要作我们的王吗。难道你真要管辖我们吗，他们就因为他的梦和他的话越发恨他。</p>
<p>And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or
shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more
for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
<p>37:9
后来他又作了一梦，也告诉他的哥哥们说，看哪，我又作了一梦，梦见太阳，月亮，与十一个星向我下拜。</p>
<p>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said,
Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon
and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</p>
<p>37:10
约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲和他哥哥们，他父亲就责备他说，你作的这是什么梦。难道我和你母亲，你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗，</p>
<p>And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father
rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down
ourselves to thee to the earth?</p>
<p>37:11 他哥哥们都嫉妒他，他父亲却把这话存在心里。</p>
<p>And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.</p>
<p>37:12 约瑟的哥哥们往示剑去放他们父亲的羊。</p>
<p>And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.</p>
<p>37:13
以色列对约瑟说，你哥哥们不是在示剑放羊吗。你来，我要打发你往他们那里去。约瑟说，我在这里。</p>
<p>And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in
Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here
am I.</p>
<p>37:14
以色列说，你去看看你哥哥们平安不平安，群羊平安不平安，就回来报信给我。于是打发他出希伯仑谷，他就往示剑去了。</p>
<p>And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy
brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent
him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</p>
<p>37:15 有人遇见他在田野走迷了路，就问他说，你找什么，</p>
<p>And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the
field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</p>
<p>37:16 他说，我找我的哥哥们，求你告诉我，他们在何处放羊。</p>
<p>And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they
feed their flocks.</p>
<p>37:17
那人说，他们已经走了，我听见他们说要往多坍去。约瑟就去追赶他哥哥们，遇见他们在多坍。</p>
<p>And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let
us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in
Dothan.</p>
<p>37:18 他们远远地看见他，趁他还没有走到跟前，大家就同谋要害死他，</p>
<p>And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them,
they conspired against him to slay him.</p>
<p>37:19 彼此说，你看。那作梦的来了。</p>
<p>And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>
<p>37:20
来吧。我们将他杀了，丢在一个坑里，就说有恶兽把他吃了。我们且看他的梦将来怎吗样。</p>
<p>Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit,
and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see
what will become of his dreams.</p>
<p>37:21 流便听见了，要救他脱离他们的手，说，我们不可害他的性命。</p>
<p>And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and
said, Let us not kill him.</p>
<p>37:22
又说，不可流他的血，可以把他丢在这野地的坑里，不可下手害他。流便的意思是要救他脱离他们的手，把他归还他的父亲。</p>
<p>And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit
that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid
him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.</p>
<p>37:23
约瑟到了他哥哥们那里，他们就剥了他的外衣，，就是他穿的那件彩衣，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that
they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on
him;</p>
<p>37:24 把他丢在坑里。那坑是空的，里头没有水。</p>
<p>And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty,
there was no water in it.</p>
<p>37:25
他们坐下吃饭，举目观看，见有一夥米甸的以实玛利人从基列来，用骆驼驮着香料，乳香，没药，要带下埃及去。</p>
<p>And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and
looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
to Egypt.</p>
<p>37:26 犹大对众弟兄说，我们杀我们的兄弟，藏了他的血有什么益处呢。</p>
<p>And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our
brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
<p>37:27
我们不如将他卖给以实玛利人，不可下手害他。因为他是我们的兄弟，我们的骨肉。众弟兄就听从了他。</p>
<p>Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be
upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were
content.</p>
<p>37:28
有些米甸的商人从那里经过，哥哥们就把约瑟从坑里拉上来，讲定二十舍客勒银子，把约瑟卖给以实玛利人。他们就把约瑟带到埃及去了。</p>
<p>Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted
up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty
pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
<p>37:29 流便回到坑边，见约瑟不在坑里，就撕裂衣服，</p>
<p>And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the
pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>
<p>37:30 回到兄弟们那里，说，童子没有了。我往哪里去才好呢，</p>
<p>And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I,
whither shall I go?</p>
<p>37:31 他们宰了一只公山羊，把约瑟的那件彩衣染了血，</p>
<p>And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and
dipped the coat in the blood;</p>
<p>37:32
打发人送到他们的父亲那里，说，我们捡了这个。请认一认是你儿子的外衣不是，</p>
<p>And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their
father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son’s
coat or no.</p>
<p>37:33
他认得，就说，这是我儿子的外衣。有恶兽把他吃了，约瑟被撕碎了。撕碎了。</p>
<p>And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast hath
devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>
<p>37:34 雅各便撕裂衣服，腰间围上麻布，为他儿子悲哀了多日。</p>
<p>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and
mourned for his son many days.</p>
<p>37:35
他的儿女都起来安慰他，他却不肯受安慰，说，我必悲哀着下阴间，到我儿子那里。约瑟的父亲就为他哀哭。</p>
<p>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he
refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave
unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</p>
<p>37:36 米甸人带约瑟到埃及，把他卖给法老的内臣护卫长波提乏。</p>
<p>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.</p>
