<h4 id="旧约-耶利米书jeremiah-第-34-章-本篇共有-52-章">旧约 –
耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 34 章 ( 本篇共有 52 章 )</h4>
<p>34:1
巴比伦王尼布甲尼撒率领他的全军和地上属他的各国各邦，攻打耶路撒冷和属耶路撒冷所有的城邑。那时，耶和华的话临到耶利米说，</p>
<p>The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of
his dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against
all the cities thereof, saying,</p>
<p>34:2
耶和华以色列的神说，你去告诉犹大王西底家，耶和华如此说，我要将这城交付巴比伦王的手，他必用火焚烧。</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king
of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this
city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with
fire:</p>
<p>34:3
你必不能逃脱他的手，定被拿住，交在他的手中。你的眼要见巴比伦王的眼，他要口对口和你说话，你也必到巴比伦去。</p>
<p>And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken,
and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the
king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou
shalt go to Babylon.</p>
<p>34:4
犹大王西底家阿，你还要听耶和华的话。耶和华论到你如此说，你必不被刀剑杀死，</p>
<p>Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith
the LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</p>
<p>34:5
你必平安而死，人必为你焚烧物件，好像为你列祖，就是在你以前的先王焚烧一般。人必为你举哀，说，哀哉。我主阿。耶和华说，这话是我说的。</p>
<p>But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers,
the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for
thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced
the word, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>34:6 于是，先知耶利米在耶路撒冷将这一切话告诉犹大王西底家。</p>
<p>Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of
Judah in Jerusalem,</p>
<p>34:7
那时，巴比伦王的军队正攻打耶路撒冷，又攻打犹大所剩下的城邑，就是拉吉和亚西加。原来犹大的坚固城只剩下这两座。</p>
<p>When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against
all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against
Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</p>
<p>34:8 *</p>
<p>This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at
Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them;</p>
<p>34:9
西底家王与耶路撒冷的众民立约，要向他们宣告自由，叫各人任他希伯来的仆人和婢女自由出去，谁也不可使他的一个犹大弟兄作奴仆。（此后，有耶和华的话临到耶利米。）</p>
<p>That every man should let his manservant, and every man his
maidservant, being an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should
serve himself of them, to wit, of a Jew his brother.</p>
<p>34:10
所有立约的首领和众民就任他的仆人婢女自由出去，谁也不再叫他们作奴仆。大家都顺从，将他们释放了。</p>
<p>Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into
the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every
one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them
any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.</p>
<p>34:11
后来却又反悔，叫所任去自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。</p>
<p>But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,
whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection
for servants and for handmaids.</p>
<p>34:12 因此耶和华的话临到耶利米说，</p>
<p>Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD,
saying,</p>
<p>34:13
耶和华以色列的神如此说，我将你们的列祖从埃及地为奴之家领出来的时候，与他们立约说，</p>
<p>Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your
fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,
out of the house of bondmen, saying,</p>
<p>34:14
你的一个希伯来弟兄若卖给你，服事你六年，到第七年你们各人就要任他自由出去。只是你们列祖不听从我，也不侧耳而听。</p>
<p>At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew,
which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years,
thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not
unto me, neither inclined their ear.</p>
<p>34:15
如今你们回转，行我眼中看为正的事，各人向邻舍宣告自由，并且在称为我名下的殿中，在我面前立约。</p>
<p>And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in
proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a
covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</p>
<p>34:16
你们却又反悔，亵渎我的名，各人叫所任去随意自由的仆人婢女回来，勉强他们仍为仆婢。</p>
<p>But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant,
and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their
pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you
for servants and for handmaids.</p>
<p>34:17
所以耶和华如此说，你们没有听从我，各人向弟兄邻舍宣告自由。看哪。我向你们宣告一样自由，就是使你们自由于刀剑，饥荒，瘟疫之下，并且使你们在天下万国中抛来抛去。这是耶和华的话。</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his
neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the
sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be
removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p>34:18 *</p>
<p>And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which
have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before
me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts
thereof,</p>
<p>34:19
犹大的首领，耶路撒冷的首领，太监，祭司，和国中的众民曾将牛犊劈开，分成两半，从其中经过，在我面前立约。后来又违背我的约，不遵行这约上的话。</p>
<p>The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and
the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the
parts of the calf;</p>
<p>34:20
我必将他们交在仇敌和寻索其命的人手中。他们的尸首必给空中的飞鸟和地上的野兽作食物。</p>
<p>I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the
hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for
meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p>34:21
并且我必将犹大王西底家和他的首领交在他们仇敌和寻索其命的人，与那暂离你们而去巴比伦王军队的手中。</p>
<p>And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand
of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and
into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from
you.</p>
<p>34:22
耶和华说，我必吩咐他们回到这城，攻打这城，将城攻取，用火焚烧。我也要使犹大的城邑变为荒场，无人居住。</p>
<p>Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to
this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it
with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an
inhabitant.</p>
