<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第24-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第24 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>24:1 亚伯拉罕年纪老迈，向来在一切事上耶和华都赐福给他。</p>
<p>And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had
blessed Abraham in all things.</p>
<p>24:2 亚伯拉罕对管理他全业最老的仆人说，请你把手放在我大腿底下。</p>
<p>And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled
over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh:</p>
<p>24:3
我要叫你指着耶和华天地的主起誓，不要为我儿子娶这迦南地中的女子为妻。</p>
<p>And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the
God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the
daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</p>
<p>24:4 你要往我本地本族去，为我的儿子以撒娶一个妻子。</p>
<p>But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife
unto my son Isaac.</p>
<p>24:5
仆人对他说，倘若女子不肯跟我到这地方来，我必须将你的儿子带回你原出之地吗。</p>
<p>And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be
willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again
unto the land from whence thou camest?</p>
<p>24:6 亚伯拉罕对他说，你要谨慎，不要带我的儿子回那里去。</p>
<p>And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son
thither again.</p>
<p>24:7
耶和华天上的主曾带领我离开父家和本族的地，对我说话，向我起誓说，我要将这地赐给你的后裔。他必差遣使者在你面前，你就可以从那里为我儿子娶一个妻子。</p>
<p>The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and
from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware
unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his
angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from
thence.</p>
<p>24:8
倘若女子不肯跟你来，我使你起的誓就与你无干了，只是不可带我的儿子回那里去。</p>
<p>And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt
be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</p>
<p>24:9 仆人就把手放在他主人亚伯拉罕的大腿底下，为这事向他起誓。</p>
<p>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,
and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>
<p>24:10
那仆人从他主人的骆驼里取了十匹骆驼，并带些他主人各样的财物，起身往美索不达米亚去，到了拿鹤的城。</p>
<p>And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and
departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he
arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.</p>
<p>24:11
天将晚，众女子出来打水的时候，他便叫骆驼跪在城外的水井那里。</p>
<p>And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of
water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to
draw water.</p>
<p>24:12
他说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神阿，求你施恩给我主人亚伯拉罕，使我今日遇见好机会。</p>
<p>And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me
good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham.</p>
<p>24:13 我现今站在井旁，城内居民的女子们正出来打水。</p>
<p>Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the
men of the city come out to draw water:</p>
<p>24:14
我向哪一个女子说，请你拿下水瓶来，给我水喝，她若说，请喝，我也给你的骆驼喝，愿那女子就作你所预定给你仆人以撒的妻。这样，我便知道你施恩给我主人了。</p>
<p>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let
down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say,
Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that
thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that
thou hast shewed kindness unto my master.</p>
<p>24:15
话还没有说完，不料，利百加肩头上扛着水瓶出来。利百加是彼土利所生的。彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold,
Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of
Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>24:16
那女子容貌极其俊美，还是处女，也未曾有人亲近她。她下到井旁，打满了瓶，又上来。</p>
<p>And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any
man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher,
and came up.</p>
<p>24:17 仆人跑上前去迎着她，说，求你将瓶里的水给我一点喝。</p>
<p>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink
a little water of thy pitcher.</p>
<p>24:18 女子说，我主请喝，就急忙拿下瓶来，托在手上给他喝。</p>
<p>And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</p>
<p>24:19 女子给他喝了，就说，我再为你的骆驼打水，叫骆驼也喝足。</p>
<p>And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water
for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</p>
<p>24:20
她就急忙把瓶里的水倒在槽里，又跑到井旁打水，就为所有的骆驼打上水来。</p>
<p>And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran
again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</p>
<p>24:21
那人定睛看她，一句话也不说，要晓得耶和华赐他通达的道路没有。</p>
<p>And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD
had made his journey prosperous or not.</p>
<p>24:22
骆驼喝足了，那人就拿一个金环，重半舍客勒，两个金镯，重十舍客勒，给了那女子，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man
took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her
hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</p>
<p>24:23
说，请告诉我，你是谁的女儿，你父亲家里有我们住宿的地方没有。</p>
<p>And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there
room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?</p>
<p>24:24 女子说，我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。</p>
<p>And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</p>
<p>24:25 又说，我们家里足有粮草，也有住宿的地方。</p>
<p>She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough,
and room to lodge in.</p>
<p>24:26 那人就低头向耶和华下拜，</p>
<p>And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</p>
<p>24:27
说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神是应当称颂的，因他不断地以慈爱诚实待我主人。至于我，耶和华在路上引领我，直走到我主人的兄弟家里。</p>
<p>And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath
not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the
way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brethren.</p>
<p>24:28 女子跑回去，照着这些话告诉她母亲和她家里的人。</p>
<p>And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these
things.</p>
<p>24:29 *</p>
<p>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out
unto the man, unto the well.</p>
<p>24:30
利百加有一个哥哥，名叫拉班，看见金环，又看见金镯在他妹子的手上，并听见他妹子利百加的话，说那人对我如此如此说。拉班就跑出来往井旁去，到那人跟前，见他仍站在骆驼旁边的井旁那里。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his
sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister,
saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and,
behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</p>
<p>24:31
便对他说，你这蒙耶和华赐福的，请进来，为什么站在外边，我已经收拾了房屋，也为骆驼预备了地方。</p>
<p>And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest
thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the
camels.</p>
<p>24:32
那人就进了拉班的家。拉班卸了骆驼，用草料喂上，拿水给那人和跟随的人洗脚，</p>
<p>And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave
straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the
men’s feet that were with him.</p>
<p>24:33
把饭摆在他面前，叫他吃，他却说，我不吃，等我说明白我的事情再吃。拉班说，请说。</p>
<p>And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not
eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</p>
<p>24:34 他说，我是亚伯拉罕的仆人。</p>
<p>And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.</p>
<p>24:35
耶和华大大地赐福给我主人，使他昌大，又赐给他羊群，牛群，金银，仆婢，骆驼，和驴。</p>
<p>And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great:
and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and
menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</p>
<p>24:36
我主人的妻子撒拉年老的时候给我主人生了一个儿子。我主人也将一切所有的都给了这个儿子。</p>
<p>And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old:
and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</p>
<p>24:37 我主人叫我起誓说，你不要为我儿子娶迦南地的女子为妻。</p>
<p>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my
son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</p>
<p>24:38 你要往我父家，我本族那里去，为我的儿子娶一个妻子。</p>
<p>But thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take
a wife unto my son.</p>
<p>24:39 我对我主人说，恐怕女子不肯跟我来。</p>
<p>And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow
me.</p>
<p>24:40
他就说，我所事奉的耶和华必要差遣他的使者与你同去，叫你的道路通达，你就得以在我父家，我本族那里，给我的儿子娶一个妻子。</p>
<p>And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his
angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my
son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:</p>
<p>24:41
只要你到了我本族那里，我使你起的誓就与你无干。他们若不把女子交给你，我使你起的誓也与你无干。</p>
<p>Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my
kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my
oath.</p>
<p>24:42
我今日到了井旁，便说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神阿，愿你叫我所行的道路通达。</p>
<p>And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master
Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:</p>
<p>24:43
我如今站在井旁，对哪一个出来打水的女子说，请你把你瓶里的水给我一点喝。</p>
<p>Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that
when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I
pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;</p>
<p>24:44
她若说，你只管喝，我也为你的骆驼打水。愿那女子就作耶和华给我主人儿子所预定的妻。</p>
<p>And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy
camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for
my master’s son.</p>
<p>24:45
我心里的话还没有说完，利百加就出来，肩头上扛着水瓶，下到井旁打水。我便对她说，请你给我水喝。</p>
<p>And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came
forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well,
and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.</p>
<p>24:46
她就急忙从肩头上拿下瓶来，说，请喝，我也给你的骆驼喝。我便喝了。她又给我的骆驼喝了。</p>
<p>And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and
said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she
made the camels drink also.</p>
<p>24:47
我问她说，你是谁的女儿，她说，我是密迦与拿鹤之子彼土利的女儿。我就把环子戴在她鼻子上，把镯子戴在她两手上。</p>
<p>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The
daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put
the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands.</p>
<p>24:48
随后我低头向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神。因为他引导我走合式的道路，使我得着我主人兄弟的孙女，给我主人的儿子为妻。</p>
<p>And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the
LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take
my master’s brother’s daughter unto his son.</p>
<p>24:49
现在你们若愿以慈爱诚实待我主人，就告诉我。若不然，也告诉我，使我可以或向左，或向右。</p>
<p>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and
if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</p>
<p>24:50
拉班和彼土利回答说，这事乃出于耶和华，我们不能向你说好说歹。</p>
<p>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from
the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</p>
<p>24:51
看哪，利百加在你面前，可以将她带去，照着耶和华所说的，给你主人的儿子为妻。</p>
<p>Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy
master’s son’s wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
<p>24:52 亚伯拉罕的仆人听见他们这话，就向耶和华俯伏在地。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words,
he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</p>
<p>24:53
当下仆人拿出金器，银器，和衣服送给利百加，又将宝物送给她哥哥和她母亲。</p>
<p>And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and
to her mother precious things.</p>
<p>24:54
仆人和跟从他的人吃了喝了，住了一夜。早晨起来，仆人就说，请打发我回我主人那里去吧。</p>
<p>And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and
tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me
away unto my master.</p>
<p>24:55
利百加的哥哥和她母亲说，让女子同我们再住几天，至少十天，然后她可以去。</p>
<p>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a
few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</p>
<p>24:56
仆人说，耶和华既赐给我通达的道路，你们不要耽误我，请打发我走，回我主人那里去吧。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered
my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</p>
<p>24:57 他们说，我们把女子叫来问问她。</p>
<p>And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth.</p>
<p>24:58 就叫了利百加来，问她说，你和这人同去吗。利百加说，我去。</p>
<p>And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this
man? And she said, I will go.</p>
<p>24:59
于是他们打发妹子利百加和她的乳母，同亚伯拉罕的仆人，并跟从仆人的，都走了。</p>
<p>And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s
servant, and his men.</p>
<p>24:60
他们就给利百加祝福说，我们的妹子阿，愿你作千万人的母。愿你的后裔得着仇敌的城门。</p>
<p>And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be
thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the
gate of those which hate them.</p>
<p>24:61
利百加和她的使女们起来，骑上骆驼，跟着那仆人，仆人就带着利百加走了。</p>
<p>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels,
and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his
way.</p>
<p>24:62 那时，以撒住在南地，刚从庇耳拉海莱回来。</p>
<p>And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the
south country.</p>
<p>24:63 天将晚，以撒出来在田间默想，举目一看，见来了些骆驼。</p>
<p>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he
lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</p>
<p>24:64 利百加举目看见以撒，就急铅下了骆驼，</p>
<p>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted
off the camel.</p>
<p>24:65
问那仆人说，这田间走来迎接我们的是谁。仆人说，是我的主人。利百加就拿帕子蒙上脸。</p>
<p>For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in
the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master:
therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</p>
<p>24:66 仆人就将所办的一切事都告诉以撒。</p>
<p>And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</p>
<p>24:67
以撒便领利百加进了他母亲撒拉的帐棚，娶了她为妻，并且爱她。以撒自从他母亲不在了，这才得了安慰。</p>
<p>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah,
and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after
his mother’s death.</p>
