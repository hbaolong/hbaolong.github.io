<h4 id="旧约-以西结书ezekiel-第-10-章-本篇共有-48-章">旧约 –
以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 10 章 ( 本篇共有 48 章 )</h4>
<p>10:1
我观看，见基路伯头上的穹苍之中，显出蓝宝石的形状，彷佛宝座的形像。</p>
<p>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head
of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone,
as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p>
<p>10:2
主对那穿细麻衣的人说，你进去，在旋转的轮内基路伯以下，从基路伯中间将火炭取满两手，撒在城上。我就见他进去。</p>
<p>And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between
the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of
fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he
went in in my sight.</p>
<p>10:3 那人进去的时候，基路伯站在殿的右边，云彩充满了内院。</p>
<p>Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man
went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</p>
<p>10:4
耶和华的荣耀从基路伯那里上升，停在门槛以上。殿内满了云彩，院宇也被耶和华荣耀的光辉充满。</p>
<p>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over
the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and
the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.</p>
<p>10:5 基路伯翅膀的响声听到外院，好像全能神说话的声音。</p>
<p>And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the outer
court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</p>
<p>10:6
他吩咐那穿细麻衣的人说，要从旋转的轮内基路伯中间取火。那人就进去站在一个轮子旁边。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with
linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the
cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</p>
<p>10:7
有一个基路伯从基路伯中伸手到基路伯中间的火那里，取些放在那穿细麻衣的人两手中，那人就拿出去了。</p>
<p>And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims
unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took thereof, and put
it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and
went out.</p>
<p>10:8 在基路伯翅膀之下，显出有人手的样式。</p>
<p>And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand under
their wings.</p>
<p>10:9
我又观看，见基路伯旁边有四个轮子。这基路伯旁有一个轮子，那基路伯旁有一个轮子，每基路伯都是如此。轮子的颜色（原文作形状）彷佛水苍玉。</p>
<p>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel
by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance
of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.</p>
<p>10:10 至于四轮的形状，都是一个样式，彷佛轮中套轮。</p>
<p>And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a
wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</p>
<p>10:11
轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，并不掉转。头向何方，他们也随向何方，行走的时候并不掉转。</p>
<p>When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as
they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it;
they turned not as they went.</p>
<p>10:12
他们全身，连背带手和翅膀，并轮周围都满了眼睛。这四个基路伯的轮子都是如此。</p>
<p>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels
that they four had.</p>
<p>10:13 至于这些轮子，我耳中听见说是旋转的。</p>
<p>As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.</p>
<p>10:14
基路伯各有四脸，第一是基路伯的脸，第二是人的脸，第三是狮子的脸，第四是鹰的脸。</p>
<p>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the
face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>
<p>10:15 基路伯升上去了。这是我在迦巴鲁河边所见的活物。</p>
<p>And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature that I
saw by the river of Chebar.</p>
<p>10:16
基路伯行走，轮也在旁边行走。基路伯展开翅膀，离地上升，轮也不转离他们旁边。</p>
<p>And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the
cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same
wheels also turned not from beside them.</p>
<p>10:17
那些站住，这些也站住。那些上升，这些也一同上升，因为活物的灵在轮中。</p>
<p>When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up, these
lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature was in
them.</p>
<p>10:18 耶和华的荣耀从殿的门槛那里出去，停在基路伯以上。</p>
<p>Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of the
house, and stood over the cherubims.</p>
<p>10:19
基路伯出去的时候，就展开翅膀，在我眼前离地上升。轮也在他们的旁边，都停在耶和华殿的东门口。在他们以上有以色列神的荣耀。</p>
<p>And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the
earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside them,
and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s house;
and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</p>
<p>10:20
这是我在迦巴鲁河边所见，以色列神荣耀以下的活物，我就知道他们是基路伯。</p>
<p>This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the
river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.</p>
<p>10:21 各有四个脸面，四个翅膀，翅膀以下有人手的样式。</p>
<p>Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and the
likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</p>
<p>10:22
至于他们脸的模样，并身体的形像，是我从前在迦巴鲁河边所看见的。他们俱各直往前行。</p>
<p>And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the
river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went every one
straight forward.</p>
