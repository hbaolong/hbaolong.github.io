<h4 id="旧约-创世记genesis-第39-章-本篇共有50-章">旧约– 创世记(Genesis)
– 第39 章( 本篇共有50 章)</h4>
<p>39:1
约瑟被带下埃及去。有一个埃及人，是法老的内臣，护卫长波提乏，从那些带下他来的以实玛利人手下买了他去。</p>
<p>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of
Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of
the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither.</p>
<p>39:2 约瑟住在他主人埃及人的家中，耶和华与他同在，他就百事顺利。</p>
<p>And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was
in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>
<p>39:3 他主人见耶和华与他同在，又见耶和华使他手里所办的尽都顺利，</p>
<p>And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD made
all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>
<p>39:4
约瑟就在主人眼前蒙恩，伺候他主人，并且主人派他管理家务，把一切所有的都交在他手里。</p>
<p>And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made
him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his
hand.</p>
<p>39:5
自从主人派约瑟管理家务和他一切所有的，耶和华就因约瑟的缘故赐福与那埃及人的家。凡家里和田间一切所有的都蒙耶和华赐福。</p>
<p>And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in
his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the
Egyptian’s house for Joseph’s sake; and the blessing of the LORD was
upon all that he had in the house, and in the field.</p>
<p>39:6
波提乏将一切所有的都交在约瑟的手中，除了自己所吃的饭，别的事一概不知。约瑟原来秀雅俊美。</p>
<p>And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand; and he knew not ought
he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person,
and well favoured.</p>
<p>39:7 这事以后，约瑟主人的妻以目送情给约瑟，说，你与我同寝吧。</p>
<p>And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast
her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>
<p>39:8
约瑟不从，对他主人的妻说，看哪，一切家务，我主人都不知道。他把所有的都交在我手里。</p>
<p>But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master
wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that
he hath to my hand;</p>
<p>39:9
在这家里没有比我大的。并且他没有留下一样不交给我，只留下了你，因为你是他的妻子。我怎能作这大恶，得罪神呢，</p>
<p>There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back
any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do
this great wickedness, and sin against God?</p>
<p>39:10
后来她天天和约瑟说，约瑟却不听从她，不与她同寝，也不和她在一处。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he
hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>
<p>39:11 有一天，约瑟进屋里去办事，家中人没有一个在那屋里，</p>
<p>And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house
to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there
within.</p>
<p>39:12
妇人就拉住他的衣裳，说，你与我同寝吧。约瑟把衣裳丢在妇人手里，跑到外边去了。</p>
<p>And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left
his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>
<p>39:13 妇人看见约瑟把衣裳丢在她手里跑出去了，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her
hand, and was fled forth,</p>
<p>39:14
就叫了家里的人来，对他们说，你们看。他带了一个希伯来人进入我们家里，要戏弄我们。他到我这里来，要与我同寝，我就大声喊叫。</p>
<p>That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them,
saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in
unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:</p>
<p>39:15 他听见我放声喊起来，就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑到外边去了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and
cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out.</p>
<p>39:16 妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里，等着他主人回家，</p>
<p>And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>
<p>39:17
就对他如此如此说，你所带到我们这里的那希伯来仆人进来要戏弄我，</p>
<p>And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew
servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock
me:</p>
<p>39:18 我放声喊起来，他就把衣裳丢在我这里，跑出去了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left
his garment with me, and fled out.</p>
<p>39:19
约瑟的主人听见他妻子对他所说的话，说，你的仆人如此如此待我，他就生气，</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife,
which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to
me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p>39:20
把约瑟下在监里，就是王的囚犯被囚的地方。于是约瑟在那里坐监。</p>
<p>And Joseph’s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place
where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the
prison.</p>
<p>39:21 但耶和华与约瑟同在，向他施恩，使他在司狱的眼前蒙恩。</p>
<p>But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him
favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>
<p>39:22
司狱就把监里所有的囚犯都交在约瑟手下。他们在那里所办的事都是经他的手。</p>
<p>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the
prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was
the doer of it.</p>
<p>39:23
凡在约瑟手下的事，司狱一概不察，因为耶和华与约瑟同在。耶和华使他所作的尽都顺利。</p>
<p>The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his
hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD
made it to prosper.</p>
