<h4 id="旧约-民数记numbers-第-4-章-本篇共有-36-章">旧约 –
民数记(Numbers) – 第 4 章 ( 本篇共有 36 章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 耶和华晓谕摩西，亚伦说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>4:2 你从利未人中，将哥辖子孙的总数，照他们的家室，宗族，</p>
<p>Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after
their families, by the house of their fathers,</p>
<p>4:3 从三十岁直到五十岁，凡前来任职，在会幕里办事的，全都计算。</p>
<p>From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that
enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation.</p>
<p>4:4 哥辖子孙在会幕搬运至圣之物，所办的事乃是这样，</p>
<p>This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of
the congregation, about the most holy things:</p>
<p>4:5
起营的时候，亚伦和他儿子要进去摘下遮掩柜的幔子，用以蒙盖法柜，</p>
<p>And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons,
and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of
testimony with it:</p>
<p>4:6 又用海狗皮盖在上头，再蒙上纯蓝色的毯子，把杠穿上。</p>
<p>And shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall
spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
thereof.</p>
<p>4:7
又用蓝色毯子铺在陈设饼的桌子上，将盘子，调羹，奠酒的爵，和杯摆在上头。桌子上也必有常设的饼。</p>
<p>And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue,
and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to
cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:</p>
<p>4:8 在其上又要蒙朱红色的毯子，再蒙上海狗皮，把杠穿上。</p>
<p>And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the
same with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves
thereof.</p>
<p>4:9
要拿蓝色毯子，把灯台和灯台上所用的灯盏，剪子，腊花盘，并一切盛油的器皿，全都遮盖。</p>
<p>And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the
light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the
oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:</p>
<p>4:10 又要把灯台和灯台的一切器具包在海狗皮里，放在抬架上。</p>
<p>And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering
of badgers’ skins, and shall put it upon a bar.</p>
<p>4:11 在金坛上要铺蓝色毯子，蒙上海狗皮，把杠穿上。</p>
<p>And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to the staves
thereof:</p>
<p>4:12
又要把圣所用的一切器具包在蓝色毯子里，用海狗皮蒙上，放在抬架上。</p>
<p>And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they
minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover
them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put them on a bar:</p>
<p>4:13 要收去坛上的灰，把紫色毯子铺在坛上。</p>
<p>And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a
purple cloth thereon:</p>
<p>4:14
又要把所用的一切器具，就是火鼎，肉锸子，铲子，盘子，一切属坛的器具都摆在坛上，又蒙上海狗皮，把杠穿上。</p>
<p>And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they
minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels,
and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon
it a covering of badgers’ skins, and put to the staves of it.</p>
<p>4:15
将要起营的时候，亚伦和他儿子把圣所和圣所的一切器具遮盖完了，哥辖的子孙就要来抬，只是不可摸圣物，免得他们死亡。会幕里这些物件是哥辖子孙所当抬的</p>
<p>And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they
shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the
burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>4:16
祭司亚伦的儿子以利亚撒所要看守的是点灯的油与香料，并当献的素祭和膏油，也要看守全帐幕与其中所有的，并圣所和圣所的器具。</p>
<p>And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth
the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat
offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.</p>
<p>4:17 耶和华晓谕摩西，亚伦说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>4:18 你们不可将哥辖人的支派从利未人中剪除。</p>
<p>Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among
the Levites:</p>
<p>4:19
他们挨近至圣物的时候，亚伦和他儿子要进去派他们各人所当办的，所当抬的。这样待他们，好使他们活着，不致死亡。</p>
<p>But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:</p>
<p>4:20 只是他们连片时不可进去观看圣所，免得他们死亡。</p>
<p>But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered,
lest they die.</p>
<p>4:21 耶和华晓谕摩西说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>4:22 你要将革顺子孙的总数，照着宗族，家室，</p>
<p>Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of
their fathers, by their families;</p>
<p>4:23 从三十岁直到五十岁，凡前来任职，在会幕里办事的，全都数点。</p>
<p>From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou
number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in
the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>4:24 革顺人各族所办的事，所抬的物乃是这样，</p>
<p>This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and
for burdens:</p>
<p>4:25
他们要抬帐幕的幔子和会幕，并会幕的盖与其上的海狗皮，和会幕的门帘，</p>
<p>And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
badgers’ skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation,</p>
<p>4:26
院子的帷子和门帘（院子是围帐幕和坛的），绳子，并所用的器具，不论是作什么用的，他们都要经理。</p>
<p>And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the
gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round
about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and
all that is made for them: so shall they serve.</p>
<p>4:27
革顺的子孙在一切抬物办事之上都要凭亚伦和他儿子的吩咐。他们所当抬的，要派他们看守。</p>
<p>At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of
the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their
service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.</p>
<p>4:28
这是革顺子孙的各族在会幕里所办的事。他们所看守的，必在祭司亚伦儿子以他玛的手下。</p>
<p>This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand
of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>
<p>4:29 至于米拉利的子孙，你要照着家室，宗族把他们数点。</p>
<p>As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
families, by the house of their fathers;</p>
<p>4:30 从三十岁直到五十岁，凡前来任职，在会幕里办事的，你都要数点。</p>
<p>From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou
number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of
the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>

<p>And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
thereof,</p>
<p>4:32
院子四围的柱子和其上带卯的座，橛子，绳子，并一切使用的器具。他们所抬的器具，你们要按名指定。</p>
<p>And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all
their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge
of their burden.</p>

<p>This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according
to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the
