<h4 id="旧约-但以理书daniel-第-11-章-本篇共有-12-章">旧约 –
但以理书(Daniel) – 第 11 章 ( 本篇共有 12 章 )</h4>
<p>11:1 又说，当玛代王大流士元年，我曾起来扶助米迦勒，使他坚强。</p>
<p>Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm
and to strengthen him.</p>
<p>11:2
现在我将真事指示你，波斯还有三王兴起，第四王必富足远胜诸王。他因富足成为强盛，就必激动大众攻击希腊国。</p>
<p>And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet
three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all:
and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the
realm of Grecia.</p>
<p>11:3 必有一个勇敢的王兴起，执掌大权，随意而行。</p>
<p>And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
<p>11:4
他兴起的时候，他的国必破裂，向天的四方（方原文作风）分开，却不归他的后裔，治国的权势也都不及他。因为他的国必被拔出，归与他后裔之外的人。</p>
<p>And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be
divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor
according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be
plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
<p>11:5
南方的王必强盛，他将帅中必有一个比他更强盛，执掌权柄，他的权柄甚大。</p>
<p>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes;
and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall
be a great dominion.</p>
<p>11:6
过些年后，他们必互相连合，南方王的女儿必就了北方王来立约。但这女子帮助之力存立不住，王和他所倚靠之力也不能存立。这女子和引导她来的，并生她的，以及当时扶助她的，都必交于死地。</p>
<p>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the
king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make
an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither
shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that
brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in
these times.</p>
<p>11:7
但这女子的本家（原文作根）必另生一子（子原文作枝）继续王位，他必率领军队进入北方王的保障，攻击他们，而且得胜。</p>
<p>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate,
which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the
king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>
<p>11:8
并将他们的神像和铸成的偶像，与金银的宝器掠到埃及去。数年之内，他不去攻击北方的王。</p>
<p>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their
princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he
shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>
<p>11:9 北方的王（原?文作他）必入南方王的国，却要仍回本地。</p>
<p>So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
return into his own land.</p>
<p>11:10
北方王（原文作他）的二子必动干戈，招聚许多军兵。这军兵前去，如洪水泛滥，又必再去争战，直到南方王的保障。</p>
<p>But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of
great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass
through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his
fortress.</p>
<p>11:11
南方王必发烈怒，出来与北方王争战，摆列大军。北方王的军兵必交付他手。</p>
<p>And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come
forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall
set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his
hand.</p>
<p>11:12
他的众军高傲，他的心也必自高。他虽使数万人仆倒，却不得常胜。</p>
<p>And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted
up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be
strengthened by it.</p>
<p>11:13
北方王必回来摆列大军，比先前的更多。满了所定的年数，他必率领大军，带极多的军装来。</p>
<p>For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after
certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p>
<p>11:14
那时，必有许多人起来攻击南方王，并且你本国的强暴人必兴起，要应验那异象，他们却要败亡。</p>
<p>And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the
south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>
<p>11:15
北方王必来筑垒攻取坚固城。南方的军兵必站立不住，就是选择的精兵（精兵原文作民）也无力站住。</p>
<p>So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take
the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand,
neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to
withstand.</p>
<p>11:16
来攻击他的，必任意而行，无人在北方王（原文作他）面前删立得住。他必站在那荣美之地，用手施行毁灭。</p>
<p>But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will,
and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious
land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
<p>11:17
他必定意用全国之力而来，立公正的约，照约而行，将自己的女儿给南方王为妻，想要败坏他（或作埃及），这计却不得成就，与自己毫无益处。</p>
<p>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole
kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give
him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on
his side, neither be for him.</p>
<p>11:18
其后他必转回夺取了许多海岛。但有一大帅，除掉他令人受的羞辱，并且使这羞辱归他本身。</p>
<p>After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take
many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered
by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon
him.</p>
<p>11:19 他就必转向本地的保障，却要绊跌仆倒，归于无有。</p>
<p>Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he
shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
<p>11:20
那时，必有一人兴起接续他为王，使横征暴敛的人通行国中的荣美地。这王不多日就必灭亡，却不因忿怒，也不因争战。</p>
<p>Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of
the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in
anger, nor in battle.</p>
<p>11:21
必有一个卑鄙的人兴起接续为王，人未曾将国的尊荣给他，他却趁人坦然无备的时候，用谄媚的话得国。</p>
<p>And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall
not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and
obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
<p>11:22
必有无数的军兵势如洪水，在他面前冲没败坏。同盟的君也必如此。</p>
<p>And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him,
and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>
<p>11:23
与那君结盟之后，他必行诡诈，因为他必上来以微小的军（原文作民）成为强盛。</p>
<p>And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he
shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
<p>11:24
趁人坦然无备的时候，他必来到国中极肥美之地，行他列祖和他列祖之祖所未曾行的，将掳物，掠物，和财宝散给众人，又要设计攻打保障，然而这都是暂时的。</p>
<p>He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his
fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and
riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds,
even for a time.</p>
<p>11:25
他必奋勇向前，率领大军攻击南方王。南方王也必以极大极强的军兵与他争战，却站立不住，因为有人设计谋害南方王。</p>
<p>And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of
the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred
up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand:
for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
<p>11:26 吃王膳的，必败坏他。他的军队必被冲没，而且被杀的甚多。</p>
<p>Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and
his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
<p>11:27
至于这二王，他们心怀恶计，同席说谎，计谋却不成就。因为到了定期，事就了结。</p>
<p>And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall
speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall
be at the time appointed.</p>
<p>11:28
北方王（原文作他）必带许多财宝回往本国，他的心反对圣约，任意而行，回到本地。</p>
<p>Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart
shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return
to his own land.</p>
<p>11:29 到了定期，他必返回，来到南方。后一次却不如前一次，</p>
<p>At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but
it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
<p>11:30
因为基提战船必来攻击他，他就丧胆而回，又要恼恨圣约，任意而行。他必回来联络背弃圣约的人。</p>
<p>For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall
be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant:
so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them
that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
<p>11:31
他必兴兵，这兵必亵渎圣地，就是保障，除掉常献的燔祭，设立那行毁坏可憎的。</p>
<p>And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they
shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
<p>11:32
作恶违背圣约的人，他必用巧言勾引。惟独认识神的子民必刚强行事。</p>
<p>And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by
flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and
do exploits.</p>
<p>11:33
民间的智慧人必训诲多人。然而他们多日必倒在刀下，或被火烧，或被掳掠抢夺。</p>
<p>And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet
they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil,
many days.</p>
<p>11:34 他们仆倒的时候，稍得扶助，却有许多人用谄媚的话亲近他们。</p>
<p>Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help:
but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
<p>11:35
智慧人中有些仆倒的，为要熬炼其馀的人，使他们清净洁白，直到末了。因为到了定期，事就了结。</p>
<p>And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to
purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it
is yet for a time appointed.</p>
<p>11:36
王必任意而行，自高自大，超过所有的神，又用奇异的话攻击万神之神。他必行事亨通，直到主的忿怒完毕，因为所定的事必然成就。</p>
<p>And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous
things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation
be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>
<p>11:37
他必不顾他列祖的神，也不顾妇女所羡慕的神，无论何神他都不顾。因为他必自大，高过一切。</p>
<p>Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of
women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.</p>
<p>11:38
他倒要敬拜保障的神，用金，银，宝石和可爱之物敬奉他列祖所不认识的神。</p>
<p>But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom
his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with
precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
<p>11:39
他必靠外邦神的帮助，攻破最坚固的保障。凡承认他的，他必将荣耀加给他们，使他们管辖许多人，又为贿赂分地与他们。</p>
<p>Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he
shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to
rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
<p>11:40
到末了，南方王要与他交战。北方王必用战车，马兵，和许多战船，势如暴风来攻击他，也必进入列国，如洪水泛滥。</p>
<p>And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him:
and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with
chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter
into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
<p>11:41
又必进入那荣美之地，有许多国就被倾覆，但以东人，摩押人，和一大半亚扪人必脱离他的手。</p>
<p>He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall
be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and
Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>11:42 他必伸手攻击列国。埃及地也不得脱离。</p>
<p>He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land
of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
<p>11:43
他必把持埃及的金银财宝和各样的宝物。利比亚人和古实人都必跟从他。</p>
<p>But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and
over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the
Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
<p>11:44
但从东方和北方必有消息扰乱他，他就大发烈怒出去，要将多人杀灭净尽。</p>
<p>But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him:
therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to
make away many.</p>
<p>11:45
他必在海和荣美的圣山中间设立他如宫殿的帐幕。然而到了他的结局，必无人能帮助他。</p>
<p>And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in
the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall
help him.</p>
