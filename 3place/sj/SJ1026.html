<h4 id="新约-使徒行传acts-第-8-章-本篇共有-28-章">新约 – 使徒行传(Acts)
– 第 8 章 ( 本篇共有 28 章 )</h4>
<p>8:1
从这日起，耶路撒冷的教会，大遭逼迫。除了使徒以外，门徒都分散在犹太和撒玛列亚各处。</p>
<p>And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a
great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they
were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria,
except the apostles.</p>
<p>8:2 有虔诚的人，把司提反埋葬了，为他捶胸大哭。</p>
<p>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.</p>
<p>8:3 扫罗却残害教会，进各人的家，拉着男女下在监里。</p>
<p>As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house,
and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
<p>8:4 那些分散的人，往各处去传道。</p>
<p>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching
the word.</p>
<p>8:5 腓利下撒玛利亚城去，宣讲基督。</p>
<p>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.</p>
<p>8:6 众人听见了，又看见腓利所行的神迹，就同心合意的听从他的话。</p>
<p>And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
<p>8:7
因为有许多人被污鬼附着，那些鬼大声呼叫，从他们身上出来。还有许多瘫痪的，瘸腿的，都得了医治。</p>
<p>For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that
were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were
lame, were healed.</p>
<p>8:8 在那城里，就大有欢喜。</p>
<p>And there was great joy in that city.</p>
<p>8:9
有一个人，名叫西门，向来在那城里行邪术，妄自尊大，使撒玛利亚的百姓惊奇。</p>
<p>But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the
same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out
that himself was some great one:</p>
<p>8:10 无论大小，都听从他，说，这人就是称为神的大能者。</p>
<p>To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying,
This man is the great power of God.</p>
<p>8:11 他们听从他，因他久用邪术，使他们惊奇。</p>
<p>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
<p>8:12
及至他们信了腓利所传神国的福音，和耶稣基督的名，连男带女就受了洗。</p>
<p>But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both
men and women.</p>
<p>8:13
西门自己也信了。既受了洗，就常与腓利在一处。看见他所行的神迹和大异能，就甚惊奇。</p>
<p>Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs
which were done.</p>
<p>8:14
使徒在耶路撒冷，听见撒玛利亚人领受了神的道，就打发彼得约翰往他们那里去。</p>
<p>Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had
received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
<p>8:15 两个人到了，就为他们祷告，要叫他们受圣灵。</p>
<p>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>8:16 因为圣灵还没有降在他们一人身上。他们只奉主耶稣的名受了洗。</p>
<p>(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized
in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
<p>8:17 于是使徒按手在他们头上，他们就受了圣灵。</p>
<p>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>8:18 西门看见使徒按手，便有圣灵赐下。就拿钱给使徒说，</p>
<p>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the
Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p>8:19 把这权柄也给我，叫我手按着谁。谁就可以受圣灵。</p>
<p>Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he
may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>8:20
彼得说，你的银子，和你一同灭亡吧。因你想神的恩赐，是可以用钱买的。</p>
<p>But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou
hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
<p>8:21 你在这道上，无分无关。因为在神面前，你的心不正。</p>
<p>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not
right in the sight of God.</p>
<p>8:22 你当懊悔你这罪恶，祈求主。或者你心里的意念可得赦免。</p>
<p>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the
thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p>8:23 我看出你正在苦胆之中，被罪恶捆绑。</p>
<p>For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the
bond of iniquity.</p>
<p>8:24 西门说，愿你们为我求主，叫你们所说的，没有一样临到我身上。</p>
<p>Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none
of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p>8:25
使徒既证明主道，而且传讲，就回耶路撒冷去，一路在撒玛利亚好些村庄传扬福音。</p>
<p>And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord,
returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the
Samaritans.</p>
<p>8:26
有主的一个使者对腓利说，起来，向南走，往那从耶路撒冷下迦萨的路上去。那路是旷野。</p>
<p>And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go
toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,
which is desert.</p>
<p>8:27
腓利就起身去了。不料，有一个埃塞俄比亚人（既古实见以赛亚十八章一节）是个有大权的太监，在埃塞俄比亚女王干大基的手下总管银库，他上耶路撒冷礼拜去了。</p>
<p>And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of
great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to
worship,</p>
<p>8:28 现在回来，在车上坐着，念先知以赛亚的书。</p>
<p>Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet.</p>
<p>8:29 圣灵对腓利说，你去贴近那车走。</p>
<p>Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this
chariot.</p>
<p>8:30
腓利就跑到太监那里，听见他念先知以赛亚的书，便问他说，你所念的，你明白吗。</p>
<p>And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias,
and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p>8:31 他说，没有人指教我，怎能明白呢。于是请腓利上车，与他同坐。</p>
<p>And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he
desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p>8:32
他所念的那段经，说，他像羊被牵到宰杀之地，又像羊羔在剪毛的手下无声，他也是这样不开口。</p>
<p>The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a
sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth:</p>
<p>8:33
他卑微的时候，人不按公义审判他。（原文作他的审判被夺去）谁能述说他的世代，因为他的生命从地上夺去。</p>
<p>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare
his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p>8:34
太监对腓利说，请问先知说这话，是指着谁，是指着自己呢，是指着别人呢。</p>
<p>And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p>8:35 腓利就开口从这经上起，对他传讲耶稣</p>
<p>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and
preached unto him Jesus.</p>
<p>8:36
二人正往前走，到了有水的地方，太监说，看哪，这里有水，我受洗有什么妨碍呢。（有古卷在此有腓利说，</p>
<p>And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and
the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be
baptized?</p>
<p>8:37 你若是一心相信就可以，他回答说，我信耶稣基督是神的儿子）</p>
<p>And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.
And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of
God.</p>
<p>8:38 于是吩咐车站住，腓利和太监二人同下水里去，腓利就给他施洗。</p>
<p>And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both
into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
<p>8:39
从水里上来，主的灵把腓利提了去，太监也不再见他了，就欢欢喜喜的走路。</p>
<p>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his
way rejoicing.</p>
<p>8:40
后来有人在亚锁都遇见腓利，他走遍那地方，在各城宣传福音，直到凯撒利亚。</p>
<p>But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in
all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
