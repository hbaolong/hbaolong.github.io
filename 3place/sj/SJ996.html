<h4 id="新约-路加福音luke-第-23-章-本篇共有-24-章">新约 – 路加福音(Luke)
– 第 23 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>23:1 众人都起来，把耶稣解到彼拉多面前。</p>
<p>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.</p>
<p>23:2
就告他说，我们见这人诱惑国民，禁止纳税给凯撒，并说自己是基督，是王。</p>
<p>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting
the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he
himself is Christ a King.</p>
<p>23:3 彼拉多问耶稣说，你是犹太人的王吗。耶稣回答说，你说的是。</p>
<p>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>23:4 彼拉多对祭司长和众人说，我查不出这人有什么罪来。</p>
<p>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no
fault in this man.</p>
<p>23:5
但他们越发极力的说，他煽惑百姓，在犹太遍地传道，从加利利起，直到这里了。</p>
<p>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.</p>
<p>23:6 彼拉多一听见，就问这人是加利利人吗。</p>
<p>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean.</p>
<p>23:7
既晓得耶稣属希律所管，就把他送到希律那里去。那时希律正在耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he
sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p>23:8
希律看见耶稣，就很欢喜。因为听见过他的事，久已想要见他。并且指望看他行一件神迹。</p>
<p>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous
to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him;
and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
<p>23:9 于是问他许多的话。耶稣却一言不答。</p>
<p>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
nothing.</p>
<p>23:10 祭司长和文士，都站着极力的告他。</p>
<p>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
him.</p>
<p>23:11
希律和他的兵丁就藐视耶稣，戏弄他，给他穿上华丽衣服，把他送回彼拉多那里去。</p>
<p>And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and
arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</p>
<p>23:12 从前希律和彼拉多彼此有仇。在那一天就成了朋友。</p>
<p>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for
before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p>23:13 彼拉多传齐了祭司长，和官府，并百姓，</p>
<p>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the
rulers and the people,</p>
<p>23:14
就对他们说，你们解这人到我这里，说他是诱惑百姓的。看哪，我也曾将你们告他的事，在你们面前审问他，并没有查出他什么罪来。</p>
<p>Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you,
have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse
him:</p>
<p>23:15
就是希律也是如此，所以把他送回来。可见他没有作什么该死的事。</p>
<p>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of
death is done unto him.</p>
<p>23:16 故此我要责打他，把他释放了。有古卷在此有</p>
<p>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
<p>23:17 每逢这节期巡抚必须释放一个囚犯给他们</p>
<p>(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>
<p>23:18 众人却一齐喊着说，除掉这个人，释放巴拉巴给我们。</p>
<p>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas:</p>
<p>23:19 这巴拉巴是因在城里作乱杀人下在监里的。</p>
<p>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was
cast into prison.)</p>
<p>23:20 彼拉多愿意释放耶稣，就又劝解他们。</p>
<p>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.</p>
<p>23:21 无奈他们喊着说，钉他十字架，钉他十字架</p>
<p>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
<p>23:22
彼拉多第三次对他们说，为什么呢，这人作了什么恶事呢，我并没有查出他什么该死的罪来。所以我要责打他，把他释放了。</p>
<p>And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I
have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and
let him go.</p>
<p>23:23
他们大声催逼彼拉多，求他把耶稣钉在十字架上。他们的声音就得了胜，</p>
<p>And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be
crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests
prevailed.</p>
<p>23:24 彼拉多这才照他们所求的定案。</p>
<p>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>
<p>23:25
把他们所求的那作乱杀人下在监里的，释放了。把耶稣交给他们，任凭他们的意思行。</p>
<p>And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast
into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their
will.</p>
<p>23:26
带耶稣去的时候，有一个古利奈人西门，从乡下来。他们就抓住他，把十字架搁在他身上，叫他背着跟随耶稣。</p>
<p>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might
bear it after Jesus.</p>
<p>23:27
有许多百姓，跟随耶稣，内中有好些妇女，妇女们为他号？？痛哭。</p>
<p>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which
also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
<p>23:28
耶稣转身对他们说，耶路撒冷的女子，不要为我哭，当为自己和自己的儿女哭。</p>
<p>But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
<p>23:29
因为日子要到，人必说，不生育的，和未会怀胎的，未曾乳养婴孩的，有福了。</p>
<p>For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
which never gave suck.</p>
<p>23:30 那时，人要向大山说，倒在我们身上。向小山说，遮盖我们。</p>
<p>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the
hills, Cover us.</p>
<p>23:31 这些事既行在有汁水的树上，那枯乾的树，将来怎吗样呢。</p>
<p>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in
the dry?</p>
<p>23:32 又有两个犯人，和耶稣一同带来处死。</p>
<p>And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to
death.</p>
<p>23:33
到了一个地方，名叫髑髅地，就在那里把耶稣钉在十字架上，又钉了两个犯人，一个在左边，一个在右边。</p>
<p>And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there
they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the
other on the left.</p>
<p>23:34
当下耶稣说，父阿，赦免他们。因为他们所作的，他们不晓得。兵丁就拈阄分他的衣服。</p>
<p>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p>23:35
百姓站在那里观看。官府也嗤笑他说，他救了别人。他若是基督，神所拣选的，可以救自己吧。</p>
<p>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided
him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the
chosen of God.</p>
<p>23:36 兵丁也戏弄他，上前拿醋送给他喝，</p>
<p>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
vinegar,</p>
<p>23:37 说，你若是犹太人的王，可以救自己吧。</p>
<p>And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p>23:38
在耶稣以上有一个牌子，有古卷在此有用希腊罗马希伯来的文字写着，这是犹太人的王。</p>
<p>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek,
and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>23:39
那同钉的两个犯人，有一个讥诮他说，你不是基督吗。可以救自己和我们吧。</p>
<p>And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying,
If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p>23:40 那一个就应声责备他说，你既是一样受刑的，还不怕神吗。</p>
<p>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
<p>23:41
我们是应该的。因为我们所受的，与我们所作的相称。但这个人没有作过一件不好的事。</p>
<p>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but
this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>23:42 就说，耶稣阿，你得国降临的时候，求你记念我。</p>
<p>And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom.</p>
<p>23:43 耶稣对他说，我实在告诉你，今日你要同我在乐园里了。</p>
<p>And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be
with me in paradise.</p>
<p>23:44 那时约有午正，遍地都黑暗了，直到申初，</p>
<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all
the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>23:45 日头变黑了。殿里的幔子从当中裂为两半。</p>
<p>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the
midst.</p>
<p>23:46
耶稣大声喊着说，父阿，我将我的灵魂交在你手里。说了这话，气就断了。</p>
<p>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy
hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the
ghost.</p>
<p>23:47 百夫长看见所成的事，就归荣耀与神说，这真是个义人。</p>
<p>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying,
Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
<p>23:48 聚集观看的众人，见了这所成的事，都捶着胸回去了。</p>
<p>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the
things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
<p>23:49
还有一切与耶稣熟识的人，和从加利利跟着他来的妇女们，都远远的站着，看着这些事。</p>
<p>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
<p>23:50 有一个人名叫约瑟，是个议士，为人善良公义。</p>
<p>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a
good man, and a just:</p>
<p>23:51
众人所谋所为，他并没有附从。他本是犹太亚利马太城里素常盼望神国的人。</p>
<p>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was
of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the
kingdom of God.</p>
<p>23:52 这人去见彼拉多，求耶稣的身体。</p>
<p>This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>23:53
就取下来用细麻布裹好，安放在石头凿成的坟墓里，那里头从来没有葬过人。</p>
<p>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
<p>23:54 那日是豫备日，安息日也快到了。</p>
<p>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
<p>23:55
那些从加利利和耶稣同来的妇女，跟在后面，看见了坟墓，和他的身体怎样安放。</p>
<p>And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after,
and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p>23:56
他们就回去，豫备了香料香膏。他们在安息日，便遵着诫命安息了。</p>
<p>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the
sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>
