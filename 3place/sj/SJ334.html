<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-21-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 21 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>21:1
玛拿西登基的时候年十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王五十五年。他母亲名叫协西巴。</p>
<p>Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned
fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Hephzibah.</p>
<p>21:2
玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，效法耶和华在以色列人面前赶出的外邦人所行可憎的事。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the
abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children
of Israel.</p>
<p>21:3
重新建筑他父希西家所毁坏的邱坛，又为巴力筑坛，作亚舍拉像，效法以色列王亚哈所行的，且敬拜事奉天上的万象。</p>
<p>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had
destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did
Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
them.</p>
<p>21:4
在耶和华殿宇中筑坛。耶和华曾指着这殿说，我必立我的名在耶路撒冷。</p>
<p>And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said,
In Jerusalem will I put my name.</p>
<p>21:5 他在耶和华殿的两院中为天上的万象筑坛，</p>
<p>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of
the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:6
并使他的儿子经火，又观兆，用法术，立交鬼的和行巫术的，多行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，惹动他的怒气。</p>
<p>And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and
used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he
wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
anger.</p>
<p>21:7
又在殿内立雕刻的亚舍拉像。耶和华曾对大卫和他儿子所罗门说，我在以色列众支派中所选择的耶路撒冷和这殿，必立我的名，直到永远。</p>
<p>And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house,
of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house,
and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will
I put my name for ever:</p>
<p>21:8
以色列人若谨守遵行我一切所吩咐他们的，和我仆人摩西所吩咐他们的一切律法，我就不再使他们挪移离开我所赐给他们列祖之地。</p>
<p>Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land
which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to
all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my
servant Moses commanded them.</p>
<p>21:9
他们却不听从。玛拿西引诱他们行恶，比耶和华在以色列人面前所灭的列国更甚。</p>
<p>But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil
than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of
Israel.</p>
<p>21:10 耶和华藉他仆人众先知说，</p>
<p>And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,</p>
<p>21:11
因犹大王玛拿西行这些可憎的恶事比先前亚摩利人所行的更甚，使犹大人拜他的偶像，陷在罪里。</p>
<p>Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, and hath
done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him,
and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols:</p>
<p>21:12
所以耶和华以色列的神如此说，我必降祸与耶路撒冷和犹大，叫一切听见的人无不耳呜。</p>
<p>Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing
such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both
his ears shall tingle.</p>
<p>21:13
我必用量撒马利亚的准绳和亚哈家的线铊拉在耶路撒冷上，必擦净耶路撒冷，如人擦盘，将盘倒扣。</p>
<p>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipeth
a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</p>
<p>21:14
我必弃掉所馀剩的子民（原文作产业），把他们交在仇敌手中，使他们成为一切仇敌掳掠之物。</p>
<p>And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them
into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil
to all their enemies;</p>
<p>21:15
是因他们自从列祖出埃及直到如今，常行我眼中看为恶的事，惹动我的怒气。</p>
<p>Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have
provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of
Egypt, even unto this day.</p>
<p>21:16
玛拿西行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，使犹大人陷在罪里，又流许多无辜人的血，充满了耶路撒冷，从这边直到那边。</p>
<p>Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled
Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made
Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:17 玛拿西其馀的事，凡他所行的和他所犯的罪都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his
sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>21:18
玛拿西与他列祖同睡，葬在自己宫院乌撒的园内。他儿子亚们接续他作王。</p>
<p>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of
his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>21:19
亚们登基的时候年二十二岁，在耶路撒冷作王二年。他母亲名叫米舒利密，是约提巴人哈鲁斯的女儿。</p>
<p>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Meshullemeth,
the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</p>
<p>21:20 亚们行耶和华眼中看为恶的事，与他父亲玛拿西所行的一样。</p>
<p>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
father Manasseh did.</p>
<p>21:21 行他父亲一切所行的，敬奉他父亲所敬奉的偶像，</p>
<p>And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served
the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:</p>
<p>21:22 离弃耶和华他列祖的神，不遵行耶和华的道。</p>
<p>And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way
of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:23 亚们王的臣仆背叛他，在宫里杀了他。</p>
<p>And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in
his own house.</p>
<p>21:24 但国民杀了那些背叛亚们王的人，立他儿子约西亚接续他作王。</p>
<p>And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against
king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his
stead.</p>
<p>21:25 亚们其馀所行的事都写在犹大列王记上。</p>
<p>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>21:26 亚们葬在乌撒的园内自己的坟墓里。他儿子约西亚接续他作王。</p>
<p>And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah
his son reigned in his stead.</p>
