<h4 id="新约-路加福音luke-第-3-章-本篇共有-24-章">新约 – 路加福音(Luke)
– 第 3 章 ( 本篇共有 24 章 )</h4>
<p>3:1
凯撒提庇留在位第十五年，本丢彼拉多作犹太巡抚，希律作加利利分封的王，他兄弟腓力作以土利亚和特拉可尼地方分封的王，吕撒聂作亚比利尼分封的王，</p>
<p>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius
Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of
Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,</p>
<p>3:2
亚那和该亚法作大祭司，那时，撒迦利亚的儿子约翰在旷野里，神的话临到他。</p>
<p>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto
John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>
<p>3:3 他就来到约旦河一带地方，宣讲悔改的洗礼，使罪得赦。</p>
<p>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism
of repentance for the remission of sins;</p>
<p>3:4
正如先知以赛亚书上所记的话，说，在旷野有人声喊着说，豫备主的道，修直他的路。</p>
<p>As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet,
saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of
the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p>3:5
一切山洼都要填满，大小山冈都要削平。弯弯曲曲的地方要改为正直，高高低低的道路要改为平坦。</p>
<p>Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways
shall be made smooth;</p>
<p>3:6 凡是血气的，都要见神的救恩。</p>
<p>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p>
<p>3:7
约翰对那出来要受他洗的众人说，毒蛇的种类，谁指示你们逃避将来的忿怒呢。</p>
<p>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him,
O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
come?</p>
<p>3:8
你们要结出果子来，与悔改的心向称，不要自己心里说，有亚伯拉罕为我们的祖宗。我告诉你们，神能从这些石头中，给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来。</p>
<p>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to
say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say unto
you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto
Abraham.</p>
<p>3:9 现在斧子已经放在树根上，凡不结好果子的树，就砍下来丢在火里。</p>
<p>And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree
therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast
into the fire.</p>
<p>3:10 众人问他说，这样我们当作什么呢。</p>
<p>And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</p>
<p>3:11
约翰回答说，有两件衣裳的，就分给那没有的。有食物的也当这样行。</p>
<p>He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him
impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do
likewise.</p>
<p>3:12 又有税吏来受洗，问他说，夫子，我们当作什么呢。</p>
<p>Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master,
what shall we do?</p>
<p>3:13 约翰说，除了例定的数目，不要多取。</p>
<p>And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed
you.</p>
<p>3:14
又有兵丁问他说，我们当作什么呢。约翰说，不要以强暴待人，也不要讹诈人，自己有钱粮就当知足。</p>
<p>And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we
do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any
falsely; and be content with your wages.</p>
<p>3:15 百姓指望基督来的时候，人都心猜疑，或者约翰是基督。</p>
<p>And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their
hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;</p>
<p>3:16
约翰说，我是用水给你们施洗，但有一位能力比我更大的要来，我就是给他解鞋带也不配。他要用圣灵与火给你们施洗。</p>
<p>John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water;
but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
fire:</p>
<p>3:17
他手里拿着簸箕，要扬净他的场，把麦子收在仓里，把糠用不灭的火烧尽了。</p>
<p>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and
will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn with
fire unquenchable.</p>
<p>3:18 约翰又用许多别的话劝百姓，向他们传福音。</p>
<p>And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the
people.</p>
<p>3:19
只是分封的王希律，因他兄弟之妻希罗底的缘故，并因他所行的一切恶事，受了约翰的责备，</p>
<p>But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his
brother Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</p>
<p>3:20 又另外添了一件，就是把约翰收在监里。</p>
<p>Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.</p>
<p>3:21 众百姓都受了洗，耶稣也受了洗，正祷告的时候，天就开了，</p>
<p>Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus
also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,</p>
<p>3:22
圣灵降临在他身上，形状妨佛鸽子。又有声音从天上来，说，你是我的爱子，我喜悦你。</p>
<p>And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him,
and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in
thee I am well pleased.</p>
<p>3:23
