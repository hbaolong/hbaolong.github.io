<h4 id="旧约-撒母耳记上1-samuel-第-25-章-本篇共有-31-章">旧约 –
撒母耳记上(1 Samuel) – 第 25 章 ( 本篇共有 31 章 )</h4>
<p>25:1
撒母耳死了，以色列众人聚集，为他哀哭，将他葬在拉玛他自己的坟墓（原文作房屋）里。大卫起身，下到巴兰的旷野。</p>
<p>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and
lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and
went down to the wilderness of Paran.</p>
<p>25:2
在玛云有一个人，他的产业在迦密，是一个大富户，有三千绵羊，一千山羊。他正在迦密剪羊毛。</p>
<p>And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and
the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand
goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>
<p>25:3
那人名叫拿八，是迦勒族的人。他的妻名叫亚比该，是聪明俊美的妇人。拿八为人刚愎凶恶。</p>
<p>Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail:
and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful
countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was
of the house of Caleb.</p>
<p>25:4 大卫在旷野听见说拿八剪羊毛，</p>
<p>And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p>
<p>25:5
大卫就打发十个仆人，吩咐他们说，你们上迦密去见拿八，提我的名问他安。</p>
<p>And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men,
Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>
<p>25:6
要对那富户如此说，愿你平安，愿你家平安，愿你一切所有的都平安。</p>
<p>And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both
to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou
hast.</p>
<p>25:7
现在我听说有人为你剪羊毛，你的牧人在迦密的时候和我们在一处，我们没有欺负他们，他们也未曾失落什么。</p>
<p>And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which
were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto
them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>
<p>25:8
可以问你的仆人，他们必告诉你。所以愿我的仆人在你眼前蒙恩，因为是在好日子来的。求你随手取点赐与仆人和你儿子大卫。</p>
<p>Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young
men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray
thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son
David.</p>
<p>25:9 大卫的仆人到了，将这话提大卫的名都告诉了拿八，就住了口。</p>
<p>And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all
those words in the name of David, and ceased.</p>
<p>25:10
拿八回答大卫的仆人说，大卫是谁。耶西的儿子是谁。近来悖逆主人奔逃的仆人甚多，</p>
<p>And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who
is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away
every man from his master.</p>
<p>25:11
我岂可将饮食和为我剪羊毛人所宰的肉给我不知道从哪里来的人呢。</p>
<p>Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have
killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence
they be?</p>
<p>25:12 大卫的仆人就转身从原路回去，照这话告诉大卫。</p>
<p>So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and
told him all those sayings.</p>
<p>25:13
大卫向跟随他的人说，你们各人都要带上刀。众人就都带上刀，大卫也带上刀。跟随大卫上去的约有四百人，留下二百人看守器具。</p>
<p>And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they
girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and
there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode
by the stuff.</p>
<p>25:14
有拿八的一个仆人告诉拿八的妻亚比该说，大卫从旷野打发使者来问我主人的安，主人却辱骂他们。</p>
<p>But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold,
David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he
railed on them.</p>
<p>25:15
但是那些人待我们甚好。我们在田野与他们来往的时候，没有受他们的欺负，也未曾失落什么。</p>
<p>But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither
missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we
were in the fields:</p>
<p>25:16 我们在他们那里牧羊的时候，他们昼夜作我们的保障。</p>
<p>They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were
with them keeping the sheep.</p>
<p>25:17
所以你当筹划，看怎样行才好。不然，祸患定要临到我主人和他全家。他性情凶暴，无人敢与他说话。</p>
<p>Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is
such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>
<p>25:18
亚比该急忙将二百饼，两皮袋酒，五只收拾好了的羊，五细亚烘好了的穗子，一百葡萄饼，二百无花果饼，都驮在驴上，</p>
<p>Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles
of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched
corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs,
and laid them on asses.</p>
<p>25:19
对仆人说，你们前头走，我随着你们去。这事她却没有告诉丈夫拿八。</p>
<p>And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after
you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p>
<p>25:20
亚比该骑着驴，正下山坡，见大卫和跟随他的人从对面下来，亚比该就迎接他们。</p>
<p>And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the
covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against
her; and she met them.</p>
<p>25:21
大卫曾说，我在旷野为那人看守所有的，以致他一样不失落，实在是徒然了。他向我以恶报善。</p>
<p>Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow
hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained
unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p>
<p>25:22 凡属拿八的男丁，我若留一个到明日早晨，愿神重重降罚与我。</p>
<p>So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all
that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the
wall.</p>
<p>25:23 亚比该见大卫，便急忙下驴，在大卫面前脸伏于地叩拜，</p>
<p>And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and
fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,</p>
<p>25:24
俯伏在大卫的脚前，说，我主阿，愿这罪归我。求你容婢女向你进言，更求你听婢女的话。</p>
<p>And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this
iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine
audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</p>
<p>25:25
我主不要理这坏人拿八，他的性情与他的名相称。他名叫拿八（就是愚顽的意思），他为人果然愚顽。但我主所打发的仆人，婢女并没有看见。</p>
<p>Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal:
for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:
but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst
send.</p>
<p>25:26
我主阿，耶和华既然阻止你亲手报仇，取流血的罪，所以我指着永生的耶和华，又敢在你面前起誓说，愿你的仇敌和谋害你的人都像拿八一样。</p>
<p>Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth,
seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from
avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they
that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>
<p>25:27 如今求你将婢女送来的礼物给跟随你的仆人。</p>
<p>And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord,
let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>
<p>25:28
求你饶恕婢女的罪过。耶和华必为我主建立坚固的家，因我主为耶和华争战。并且在你平生的日子查不出有什么过来。</p>
<p>I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD
will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the
battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy
days.</p>
<p>25:29
虽有人起来追逼你，寻索你的性命，你的性命却在耶和华你的神那里蒙保护，如包裹宝器一样。你仇敌的性命，耶和华必抛去，如用机弦甩石一样。</p>
<p>Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul
of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God;
and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the
middle of a sling.</p>
<p>25:30 *</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord
according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall
have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</p>
<p>25:31
我主现在若不亲手报仇流无辜人的血，到了耶和华照所应许你的话赐福与你，立你作以色列的王，那时我主必不至心里不安，觉得良心有亏。耶和华赐福与我主的时候，求你记念婢女</p>
<p>That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my
lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath
avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord,
then remember thine handmaid.</p>
<p>25:32
大卫对亚比该说，耶和华以色列的神是应当称颂的，因为他今日使你来迎接我。</p>
<p>And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which
sent thee this day to meet me:</p>
<p>25:33 你和你的见识也当称赞。因为你今日拦阻我亲手报仇，流人的血。</p>
<p>And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me
this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine
own hand.</p>
<p>25:34
我指着阻止我加害于你的耶和华以色列永生的神起誓，你若不速速地来迎接我，到明日早晨，凡属拿八的男丁必定不留一个。</p>
<p>For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept
me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me,
surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that
pisseth against the wall.</p>
<p>25:35
大卫受了亚比该送来的礼物，就对她说，我听了你的话，准了你的情面，你可以平平安安地回家吧。</p>
<p>So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and
said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to
thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>
<p>25:36
亚比该到拿八那里，见他在家里设摆筵席，如同王的筵席。拿八快乐大醉。亚比该无论大小事都没有告诉他，就等到次日早晨。</p>
<p>And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house,
like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he
was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until
the morning light.</p>
<p>25:37
到了早晨，拿八醒了酒，他的妻将这些事都告诉他，他就魂不附体，身僵如石头一般。</p>
<p>But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of
Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died
within him, and he became as a stone.</p>
<p>25:38 过了十天，耶和华击打拿八，他就死了。</p>
<p>And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote Nabal,
that he died.</p>
<p>25:39
大卫听见拿八死了，就说，应当称颂耶和华，因他伸了拿八羞辱我的冤，又阻止仆人行恶。也使拿八的恶归到拿八的头上。于是大卫打发人去，与亚比该说，要娶她为妻。</p>
<p>And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the
LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal,
and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the
wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with
Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</p>
<p>25:40
大卫的仆人到了迦密见亚比该，对她说，大卫打发我们来见你，想要娶你为妻。</p>
<p>And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they
spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to
wife.</p>
<p>25:41 亚比该就起来，俯伏在地，说，我情愿作婢女，洗我主仆人的脚。</p>
<p>And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said,
Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants
of my lord.</p>
<p>25:42
亚比该立刻起身，骑上驴，带着五个使女，跟从大卫的使者去了，就作了大卫的妻。</p>
<p>And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five
damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers
of David, and became his wife.</p>
<p>25:43 大卫先娶了耶斯列人亚希暖，她们二人都作了他的妻。</p>
<p>David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them
his wives.</p>
<p>25:44
扫罗已将他的女儿米甲，就是大卫的妻，给了迦琳人拉亿的儿子帕提为妻。</p>
<p>But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the
son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</p>
