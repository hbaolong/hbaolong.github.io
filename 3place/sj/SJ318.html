<h4 id="旧约-列王记下2-kings-第-5-章-本篇共有-25-章">旧约 – 列王记下(2
Kings) – 第 5 章 ( 本篇共有 25 章 )</h4>
<p>5:1
亚兰王的元帅乃缦在他主人面前为尊为大，因耶和华曾藉他使亚兰人得胜。他又是大能的勇士，只是长了大麻疯。</p>
<p>Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man
with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given
deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, but he was a
leper.</p>
<p>5:2
先前亚兰人成群地出去，从以色列国掳了一个小女子，这女子就服事乃缦的妻。</p>
<p>And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away
captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on
Naaman’s wife.</p>
<p>5:3
她对主母说，巴不得我主人去见撒马利亚的先知，必能治好他的大麻疯。</p>
<p>And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the
prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p>5:4 乃缦进去，告诉他主人说，以色列国的女子如此如此说。</p>
<p>And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the
maid that is of the land of Israel.</p>
<p>5:5
亚兰王说，你可以去，我也达信于以色列王。于是乃缦带银子十他连得，金子六千舍客勒，衣裳十套，就去了。</p>
<p>And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto
the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of
silver, and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</p>
<p>5:6
且带信给以色列王，信上说，我打发臣仆乃缦去见你，你接到这信，就要治好他的大麻疯。</p>
<p>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when
this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman my
servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy.</p>
<p>5:7
以色列王看了信就撕裂衣服，说，我岂是神，能使人死使人活呢。这人竟打发人来，叫我治好他的大麻疯。你们看一看，这人何以寻隙攻击我呢。</p>
<p>And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter,
that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive,
that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy?
wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against
me.</p>
<p>5:8
神人以利沙听见以色列王撕裂衣服，就打发人去见王，说，你为什么撕了衣服呢。可使那人到我这里来，他就知道以色列中有先知了。</p>
<p>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of
Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore
hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know
that there is a prophet in Israel.</p>
<p>5:9 于是，乃缦带着车马到了以利沙的家，站在门前。</p>
<p>So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the
door of the house of Elisha.</p>
<p>5:10
以利沙打发一个使者，对乃缦说，你去在约旦河中沭浴七回，你的肉就必复原，而得洁净。</p>
<p>And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan
seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be
clean.</p>
<p>5:11
乃缦却发怒走了，说，我想他必定出来见我，站着求告耶和华他神的名，在患处以上摇手，治好这大麻疯。</p>
<p>But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He
will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD
his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper.</p>
<p>5:12
大马士革的河亚吧拿和法珥法岂不比以色列的一切水更好吗。我在那里沭浴不得洁净吗。于是气忿忿地转身去了。</p>
<p>Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the
waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and
went away in a rage.</p>
<p>5:13
他的仆人进前来，对他说，我父阿，先知若吩咐你作一件大事，你岂不作吗。何况说你去沭浴而得洁净呢。</p>
<p>And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father,
if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have
done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be
clean?</p>
<p>5:14
于是乃缦下去，照着神人的话，在约旦河里沭浴七回。他的肉复原，好像小孩子的肉，他就洁净了。</p>
<p>Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like
unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</p>
<p>5:15
乃缦带着一切跟随他的人，回到神人那里，站在他面前，说，如今我知道，除了以色列之外，普天下没有神。现在求你收点仆人的礼物。</p>
<p>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came,
and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no
God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a
blessing of thy servant.</p>
<p>5:16
以利沙说，我指着所事奉永生的耶和华起誓，我必不受。乃缦再三地求他，他却不受。</p>
<p>But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive
none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</p>
<p>5:17
乃缦说，你若不肯受，请将两骡子驮的土赐给仆人。从今以后，仆人必不再将燔祭或平安祭献与别神，只献给耶和华。</p>
<p>And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy
servant two mules’ burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth
offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the
LORD.</p>
<p>5:18
惟有一件事，愿耶和华饶恕你仆人，我主人进临门庙叩拜的时候，我用手搀他在临门庙，我也屈身。我在临门庙屈身的这事，愿耶和华饶恕我。</p>
<p>In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth
into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand,
and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the
house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.</p>
<p>5:19
以利沙对他说，你可以平平安安地回去。乃缦就离开他去了。走了不远，</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little
way.</p>
<p>5:20
神人以利沙的仆人基哈西心里说，我主人不愿从这亚兰人乃缦手里受他带来的礼物，我指着永生的耶和华起誓，我必跑去追上他，向他要些。</p>
<p>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my
master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands
that which he brought: but, as the LORD liveth, I will run after him,
and take somewhat of him.</p>
<p>5:21
于是基哈西追赶乃缦。乃缦看见有人追赶，就急忙下车迎着他，说，都平安吗。</p>
<p>So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running
after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is
all well?</p>
<p>5:22
说，都平安。我主人打发我来说，刚才有两个少年人，是先知门徒，从以法莲山地来见我，请你赐他们一他连得银子，两套衣裳。</p>
<p>And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold,
even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the
sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and
two changes of garments.</p>
<p>5:23
乃缦说，请受二他连得。再三地请受，便将二他连得银子装在两个口袋里，又将两套衣裳交给两个仆人。他们就在基哈西前头抬着走。</p>
<p>And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and
bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments,
and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before
him.</p>
<p>5:24 到了山冈，基哈西从他们手中接过来，放在屋里，打发他们回去。</p>
<p>And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand, and
bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and they
departed.</p>
<p>5:25
基哈西进去，站在他主人面前。以利沙问他说，基哈西你从哪里来。回答说，仆人没有往哪里去。</p>
<p>But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto
him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no
whither.</p>
<p>5:26
以利沙对他说，那人下车转回迎你的时候，我的心岂没有去呢。这岂是受银子，衣裳，买橄榄园，葡萄园，牛羊，仆婢的时候呢。</p>
<p>And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man
turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive
money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and
sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</p>
<p>5:27
因此，乃缦的大麻疯必沾染你和你的后裔，直到永远。基哈西从以利沙面前退出去，就长了大麻疯，像雪那样白。</p>
<p>The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy
seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as
snow.</p>
