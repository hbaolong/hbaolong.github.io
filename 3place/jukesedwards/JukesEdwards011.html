<h4 id="chapter-i">CHAPTER I</h4>
<p>XTIMOTHY EDWARDS</p>
<p>To make more clear, if possible, the persistence of intellectual
activity and moral virtue, let us study samples of the family. Take for
instance the eldest son, Timothy. He was a member of and leader in the
famous Massachusetts council of war in the Revolution, a colonel in the
militia, and a judge. His descendants have been leaders in Binghamton,
Pittsburg, Indianapolis, Bangor, St. Louis, Northampton, New Bedford,
San Francisco, New York, New Haven, and many other cities and towns in
New England, New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. From his
descendants a Connecticut town, Chaplin, is named; Newark, Ohio, had a
long-time principal, Jonathan E. Chaplin; Andover Theological Seminary
had one of its most famous treasurers, Samuel Farrar; the American board
of missions had one of its grandest leaders and secretaries, Dr. Elias
Cornelius; the American Baptist Missionary Union had one of its eminent
secretaries, Dr. Solomon Peck; the American Missionary Association had
as its great treasurer, W.E. Whiting; the famous young ladies’ seminary
of Lenox, Mass., had for thirty years its great principal, Elizabeth
Sedgwick; Boston had a prominent lawyer, a graduate of Harvard, William
Minot; St. Louis had a leading lawyer, William D. Sedgwick; Antietam had
in the list of killed the gallant Major Sedgwick; San Francisco recorded
among her distinguished sons the long-time superintendent of the Pacific
mail steamship company; the United States navy counted as one of her
able officers a surgeon, Dr. George Hopkins; Amherst had as her most
famous instructor Professor W.S. Tyler, D.D., LL.D., at the head of the
Greek department for half a century; she also has the present brilliant
professor of biology, John M. Tyler; Sheridan had as a brilliant colonel
in the grand ride of the Shenandoah Colonel M.W. Tyler; invention claims
the discoverer of the Turbine wheel, W.W. Tyler; Knox College has
claimed as a leader at one time, as has Smith at another, Professor
Henry H. Tyler.</p>
<p>A detailed study of the family of the eldest son is suggestive. He
was the sixth child, born in Northampton, 1738, when the father was
thirty-five and the mother twenty-eight. He was but twenty years old
when the father and mother died and the care of the family devolved upon
him. He had graduated from Princeton the previous year but the
responsibility of a large family prevented his entering upon
professional life. Two years after the death of his father he married
and removed to Elizabethtown, N.J., where he resided for ten years. In
1770 he returned to Stockbridge, Mass. Berkshire county was still on the
frontier and was sparsely settled. The store which Mr. Edwards opened in
1770 was the first in the county. The settlers raised wheat on the newly
cleared land. This Mr. Edwards bought and sent to New York, bringing
back goods in return. In five years he became the most prosperous man in
the county, buying and clearing a very large farm on which he employed
as many as fifty men in the busy season.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Revolutionary struggle was a most inopportune
time for Timothy Edwards; but for that he would have become one of the
wealthiest men of his day. All business was suspended and he gave
himself to his country’s cause with intense devotion. He was at once
appointed on a commission with General Schuyler to treat with the
Indians; was appointed commissary to look after the supply of the army
with provisions. From 1777 to 1780 he was a leader in the Legislature of
Massachusetts; was elected to the Continental Congress with John Hancock
and John Adams; was a colonel in the Massachusetts militia and a judge
of probate. When the war broke out Timothy Edwards was worth 0,000,
which he had accumulated in addition to all his other burdens. When the
war closed he had nothing, and was ,000 in debt to New York merchants.
To understand what sacrifices he made it must be understood that when
the government was in great straits he took ,000 of money that was as
good as gold and let the government have it, taking in return money that
was of slight value. He also took fifty tons of flour to Springfield and
let the government have it for paper money at par. There were no greater
heroes in the Revolutionary war than such men as Timothy Edwards. He was
nearly fifty years old when the war closed and he found himself the
father of thirteen children and without property or business. Full of
courage and enterprise he succeeded in supporting his family in comfort
and in regaining a substantial property before his death, which occurred
in the midst of the next war, October 27, 1813.</p>
<p>It was not an easy thing to educate children in those times. When the
Revolutionary war broke out his oldest child was but thirteen, and when
it ended he had ten children under twenty-one. There were only three
books in the schools at Stockbridge during the war, Dilworth’s Spelling
Book and Arithmetic and the Book of Psalms. From these the children of
Timothy Edwards received their education and that it was a good training
subsequent events show.</p>
<p>The first born, a daughter, married Benjamin Chaplin, Jr., a graduate
of Yale (1778), and for her second husband Capt. Dan Tyler, of
Brookline, Ct., a graduate of Harvard. Her second child, Edward, became
Register of Probate. Jonathan, the second born, had several children who
became prominent in professional and business life. Phoebe married
Rev. Asahel Hooker, an eminent graduate of Yale, and for her second
husband Rev. Samuel Farrer, a graduate of Harvard, and for many years
treasurer and financial agent of Andover Theological Seminary. Her
children were noted men and women, graduates of Yale and Dartmouth,
clergymen, theological professors, secretary of the American Board of
Foreign Missions, and secretary American Baptist Missionary Union,
prominent teachers and authors.</p>
<p>Rhoda Edwards, another of Timothy’s daughters, married Col. Josiah
Dwight, of Springfield. Among their fifteen children and their
descendants are the founder of a famous young ladies’ school at Lenox;
an author of “Spanish Conquest of America,“ and five other considerable
works; clerk of supreme court of Massachusetts; a Boston lawyer,
graduate of Harvard; an eminent linguist and graduate of Harvard; music
teacher in New York City, educated in Germany; St. Louis lawyer,
graduate of Harvard college and law school, who studied in Germany;
major in Civil war, wounded at Antietam; hospital nurse in Civil war;
graduate of Yale; graduate of Cambridge, Eng., and author of “Five Years
in an English University;“ a graduate of Amherst and Andover, and
missionary in Southern India; lawyer in Springfield; eminent teacher at
Northampton; leading physician at Northampton; leading physician at New
Bedford; supt. Pacific Mail Steamship Company; merchant in New York;
insurance manager, New York; author of “Greece and Roman Mythology,“ and
five other important works; supt. Cincinnati, Hamilton Dayton R.R.; a
New York lawyer and graduate of Yale; author of “History of Virginia,“
and two other works; graduate Dartmouth and Andover; assistant surgeon
U.S. Navy; and an officer in Civil war, who fought in thirty
battles.</p>
<p>Mary Edwards, another daughter of Timothy, married Mason Whiting,
District Attorney of New York, and member of New York Legislature. In
this family of eight children and their descendants are an authoress; a
colonel in Civil war; treasurer American Missionary Association;
Rev. W.S. Tyler, D.D., LL.D., a graduate of Amherst and Andover,
professor of Greek for fifty years at Amherst; Col. Mason Whiting Tyler,
graduate of Amherst, gallant soldier in Civil war; Wm. W. Tyler,
graduate of Amherst, manufacturer of famous Turbine Water Wheels; Henry
Mather Tyler, graduate of Amherst, professor of Greek at Knox College,
pastor at Galesburg, Fitchburg and Worcester, and professor of Greek at
Smith College; John Mason Tyler, graduate of Amherst and Union
Theological Seminary, studied at Gothenburg and Leipsic, professor of
Biology at Amherst and eminent lecturer.</p>
<p>To William Edwards, another son of Timothy, oldest son of Jonathan
Edwards, an entire chapter will be given.</p>
