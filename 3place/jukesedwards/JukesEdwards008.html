<h4 id="chapter-vi">CHAPTER VI</h4>
<p>CAPACITY, CHARACTER AND TRAINING</p>
<p>In view of what has been learned regarding Jonathan Edwards, his
ancestors and his children, his grandchildren might have found some
excuse for presuming upon the capacity and character which they
inherited. In their veins was the blood of famous lines of noble men and
women; the blood of Edwards, Stoddard, Pierrpont, and Hooker was
thrilling in their thought and intensifying their character. They had
inherited capacity and character at their best, but they did not presume
upon it. If ever inheritance would justify indifference to training, it
was in the case of the grandchildren of Jonathan Edwards, but they were
far from indifferent to their responsibility.</p>
<p>It must be understood that the “family of Jonathan Edwards“ includes
not only his descendants, but the men who married into the family and
whose children became descendants of Mr. Edwards. At first this may not
seem the proper interpretation, but there is no other that is
legitimate. In the case of the “Jukes“ Mr. Dugdale includes in the
family both the men and the women who married into the family, but in
the case of Mr. Edwards there is no call to include the women who thus
came into the family, and it would have magnified the study
needlessly.</p>
<p>Until quite recently there has been no way to discover the standing
of married women in American life except as we know the social,
scholastic, and professional position of their husbands. In most
families a son-in-law becomes a representative factor of a family.
Therefore, whenever the “Edwards family“ is spoken of it includes the
sons-in-law, but it does not include the daughters-in-law, nor does it
go beyond Jonathan Edwards to include his brothers and sisters or their
descendants.</p>
<p>The “Jukes“ had no inherited capacity or training upon which they
could safely presume. Their only chance lay in nursing every germ of
hope by means of industry and education, through the discipline of the
shop, the training of the schools, and the inspiration of the church.
Did they appreciate this? Far from it. Instead of developing capacity by
training, not one of the 1,200 secured even a moderate education, and
only twenty of them ever had a trade, and ten of these learned it in the
state prison.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although the Edwards family inherited abundant
capacity and character, every child has been educated from early
childhood. Not all of the college members of the family have been
discovered, and yet among the men alone I have found 285 graduates and a
surprisingly large number of these have supplemented the college course
with post-graduate or professional study. Just as the “Jukes“ have
intensified their degeneracy by neglect, the Edwards family has
magnified capacity and character by industry and education.</p>
<p>Among the 285 college graduates of the Edwards family there are
thirteen presidents of colleges and other higher institutions of
learning, sixty-five professors of colleges, and many principals of
important academies and seminaries. Forty-five American and foreign
colleges and universities have this family among the alumni. From this
family have come presidents for Yale, Princeton, Union, Hamilton,
Amherst, the University of California, the University of Tennessee, the
famous Litchfield (Conn.) law school, the Columbia law school, and
Andover Theological Seminary. Among these are such men as President
Timothy Dwight, Yale, 1794-1817; Theodore Dwight Woolsey, Yale, 1846-71;
Timothy Dwight, Yale, 1886-97; Jonathan Edwards (Jr.), Union, 1799-1801;
Daniel C. Gilman, Johns Hopkins; Merrill E. Gates, Amherst; and Edwards
A. Park, Andover.</p>
