<h4 id="chapter-xi">CHAPTER XI</h4>
<p>THE MARY EDWARDS DWIGHT FAMILY</p>
<p>After studying at some length the family of the eldest son of
Jonathan Edwards, it is worth while to study the family of one of the
daughters. Mary, the fourth child born at Northampton (1734), was
married at the age of 16 to Timothy Dwight, born in Vermont (1726) and
graduated from Yale in 1744.</p>
<p>It is interesting to find a daughter of Jonathan Edwards marrying a
Yale graduate, who “had such extreme sensibility to the beauty and
sweetness of always doing right, and such a love of peace, and regarded
the legal profession as so full of temptations to do wrong, in great
degree and small“ that he persistently refused to study law, though it
had been his father’s great desire. The conscientiousness of Major
Dwight is well illustrated by this incident. There was a lottery in the
interest of Princeton college, authorized by the legislature of New
Jersey, and Dwight was sent twenty tickets for sale. He returned them,
but the time required for the mail in those days was so long that they
did not reach the destination until after the drawing. Major Dwight was
notified that one of his twenty tickets had drawn 0,000 and all but one
ticket had drawn some prize. Major Dwight paid for the one blank ticket
and would not take a cent of the large prize money. This was worthy a
son-in-law of Mr. Edwards, the progenitor of a family of mighty men.</p>
<p>Major Dwight was a merchant in Northampton, a selectman, judge of
probate for sixteen years and was for several years a member of the
legislature. At the time of his death, 1778, he was possessed of 3,000
acres of valuable land in Northampton, and he willed his wife ,050, and
each of his thirteen children ,165. At that time there were but five
painted houses in Northampton and but two were carpeted. Of the fourteen
children, thirteen grew up, and twelve were married; and their entire
family adds greatly to the glory of the family of Jonathan Edwards. The
oldest son, Dr. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale, said with much
tenderness and force, “All that I am and all that I shall be, I owe to
my mother.“ She was a woman of remarkable will power and intellectual
vigor. She was but seventeen when her first child was born and was the
mother of fourteen children at forty-two.</p>
<p>The first-born, President Timothy Dwight, S.T.D., LL.D., born 1752,
was one of the most eminent of Americans. He learned his alphabet at a
single sitting while a mere child, and at four knew the catechism by
heart. He graduated from Yale at seventeen; taught the Hopkins school in
New Haven at seventeen and eighteen; was tutor in Yale from nineteen to
twenty-five years of age; wrote the “Conquest of Canada,“ which was
reprinted in London, at nineteen. This work was dedicated to George
Washington by permission. At twenty-three, he was in the fore front of
the advocates of independence. At twenty-two, General Washington
appointed him a chaplain in the army, and personally requested that he
accept. His widow received 50 a year pension because of this service. He
was a member of the Massachusetts legislature and secured an important
grant to Harvard university. He was offered a professorship at Harvard
and could have gone to Congress without opposition, but he declined
both, and at thirty-two accepted a country pastorate at Greenfield Hill,
Connecticut. He remained there twenty-two years. His salary was 50. He
also had a gift of ,500 for accepting the call, a parish lot of six
acres, and twenty cords of wood annually. This was said to be the
largest ministerial salary in New England. At forty-three he was called
from the country parish to the presidency of Yale. His salary as
president was 34. Later he had 00, from which he paid 50 for two
amanuenses which he required because his sight had failed him. He
published fourteen important works. He was largely instrumental in
organizing the American Board of Commissioners of Foreign Missions; the
American Missionary Society and the American Bible Society. To him is
largely due the establishment of theological seminaries in the country.
For forty-six years he taught every year either in a public or private
school or college, and all but one year of that time he preached every
week and almost invariably he prepared a new sermon. When he died, from
a cancer at sixty-five, the children insisted that the estate should be
for the mother during her lifetime, and when she died there was found to
be 6,000 although his salary had always been ridiculously small.</p>
<p>The eight children were all boys, and all but one grew to manhood.
Timothy was a hardware merchant in New Haven and New York for more than
forty years. He endowed the “Dwight Professorship of Didactic Theology
in Yale,“ which was named for him. There were nine children,
grandchildren of President Dwight by his eldest son. Of these the
eldest, also Timothy, was the leading paper manufacturer in the trust
mill headquarters at Chicago, and his six children were enterprising and
successful business men in Illinois and Wisconsin. John William Dwight
was one of the leading manufacturers of chemicals in Connecticut. Edward
Strong Dwight, of Yale, 1838, and of Theological Seminary, Yale, was for
many years a trustee of Amherst and a prominent clergyman. J.H. Lyman,
M.D., and Edward Huntington Lyman, M.D., were names that added luster to
the family of President Dwight. Benjamin Woolsey Dwight, M.D., another
son of the President of Yale, was a graduate of Yale and treasurer of
Hamilton college for nineteen years. Among his descendants are Richard
Smith Dewey, M.D., of Ann Arbor, in charge of Brooklyn City Hospital;
charge of military hospital at Hesse Cassel in Franco-Prussian war;
assistant superintendent Illinois State Insane hospital at Elgin. Also
Elliott Anthony, of Hamilton, 1850; Chicago lawyer; city attorney; a
member of the Illinois Constitutional Convention in 1862 and again in
1870; founder of the Law Institute, Chicago, and for several years the
president. Also Edward Woolsey Dwight, who was a leading citizen and
legislator of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It is impracticable to give the record of many of the distinguished
members of such a family, but a brief notice of a few will give some
idea of the standard of the family.</p>
<p>Benj. Woodbridge Dwight, Ph.D., b. 1816, g. Hamilton 1835, Yale
Theological Seminary, professor in Hamilton; founded Central
Presbyterian church, Joliet, Ill.; established “Dwight’s High School,“
Brooklyn; editor-in-chief of “The Interior“ of Chicago, which he owned
and edited; contributor to many magazines; author of several scholarly
works; had the first preparatory school which placed German on a level
with Greek in importance, and founded a large preparatory boarding
school at Clinton, N.Y. He was a man of rare ability, character and
success.</p>
<p>Prof. Theodore William Dwight, LL.D., b. 1822, g. Hamilton 1840, g.
Yale Law S.; professor Hamilton College sixteen years; dean of Columbia
College Law S. from 1858 to 1892. James Brice of England placed him at
the head of legal learning in the United States and said: “It would be
worth an English student’s while to cross the Atlantic to attend his
course.“ Another eminent English lawyer, A.V. Dicey, in “Legal
Education“ wrote of him as “the greatest living American teacher of
law.“ He gave a course of lectures each year at Cornell; was a member of
the N.Y. Constitutional Convention in 1867; was a member of the famous
committee of seventy in N.Y. City that exposed the Tweed ring; was
president of the New York Prison Association and presided when
Mr. Dugdale was employed to study the Jukes; associate editor “American
Law Register;“ was legal editor of “Johnson’s Encyclopædia,“ and made
many important contributions to the legal literature of the country.
There have been few men of equal eminence in our country’s history.</p>
<p>President Theodore Dwight Woolsey, D.D., LL.D., b. New York City,
October 31, 1801, was the grandson of Mary Edwards Dwight and great
grandson of Jonathan Edwards; g. Yale 1820; studied at Princeton
Theological Seminary and g. at Yale L.S.; studied in German
universities; professor in Yale twenty-two years; president of Yale
1846-1871. Wesleyan conferred degree of LL.D. and Harvard that of LL.D.
and S.T.D. all before he was fifty years of age. President of the
Evangelical Alliance held in N.Y. City 1873, the leading American on the
Committee for the Revision of the Bible. After resigning the presidency
he continued to lecture at Yale until his death, 1889. There was no more
eminent American in unofficial life from 1840 to 1890 than he. President
Hayes once said that he was greatly perplexed at one time as to the line
of public policy which he should pursue until it occurred to him that
President Woolsey was the one American on whose judgment he could rely,
and after consulting him his course was entirely clear and his action
wise. He was the author of several valuable and standard works. Yale’s
first great advance was in the time of President Timothy Dwight, its
second was in the administration of President Theodore Dwight Woolsey.
When he became president the classes about doubled in size. He
introduced new departments at once and endowments came in, such as had
never been considered possible. The tuition was raised from 3 to 0; the
salaries were greatly increased, graduate courses were introduced; many
new buildings were erected and everything went forward at a radically
different pace. Yale and American thought owe much to President Woolsey.
He wrote many scholarly works.</p>
<p>There were thirteen children born to President Woolsey. Of these, one
daughter married Rev. Edgar Laing Heermance, a graduate of Yale and a
useful and talented man; one of the sons, Theodore Salisbury, was a
graduate of Yale, and professor of International Law at Yale.</p>
<p>President Timothy Dwight, D.D., LL.D., b. 1828, g. Yale 1849, g. Yale
Theological School, studied at Bonn and Berlin in Germany; was professor
at Yale and president from 1886 to 1897. He has been an eminent American
scholar for half a century. If there were but two or three such men in a
family it would make it memorable. Yale gave him the degree of D.D., and
both Harvard and Princeton that of LL.D. He was editor of “The New
Englander.“ It is a singular fact that the three great advances which
Yale has made have been in the times of the two Dwights and of Woolsey,
all descendants of Jonathan Edwards. By the end of his third year the
number of students had risen to 1365 and the sixth year to 1784. The
gifts to Yale in each of the fifteen years of his administration were
fabulous as compared with any past experiences, often above 50,000.</p>
<p>President Sereno Edwards Dwight, D.D., g. Yale 1803, practiced law in
New Haven; author of important books which were republished in England;
became a clergyman at the age of twenty-nine; pastor of Park St. Church,
Boston; was chaplain of the U.S. Senate; established successful boarding
school in New Haven. Among his students were the two boys who afterwards
made the famous Andrews Stoddard’s Latin Grammar. His literary work was
extensive and valuable. Standing by himself he would shed lustre upon
the names he bore, Edwards and Dwight. He was a tutor in Yale and was
third president of Hamilton College.</p>
<p>William Theodore Dwight, D.D., b. 1795, g. Yale 1813, tutor at Yale,
practiced law in Philadelphia; became a clergyman; pastor in Portland;
overseer of Bowdoin College. He was offered three professorships, which
he declined. He was one of the religious leaders of America for many
years.</p>
<p>Hon. Theodore Dwight, b. 1764, lawyer. Editor “The Connecticut
Mirror“ and “The Hartford Courant;“ member of Congress, where he won
honors by successfully combating the famous John Randolph; secretary of
the famous Hartford Convention; established and edited 1815-17 the
“Albany Daily Advertiser;“ established and edited the “New York Daily
Advertiser“ 1817-36; wrote “Life of Thomas Jefferson,“ and many other
works of importance. There were few men in his day who occupied a
position of such influence.</p>
<p>Theodore Dwight, 2d, b. 1796, g. Yale 1814, eminent scholar,
imprisoned in Paris for distributing the New Testament gratis in the
streets; spoke seven languages; was the warmest American friend of
Garibaldi and was authorized by him to edit his works in this country;
was director N.Y. Asylum for the Blind, and of the N.Y. Public School
Assn.; was instrumental in having music introduced into the schools of
N.Y. City; was prominent in religious and philanthropic as well as
educational work. In the Kansas crisis he induced 3,000 settlers to go
to Kansas, and indirectly caused nearly 10,000 to go at that critical
time. He edited at various times “The N.Y. Daily Advertiser,“ “The
Youths Penny Paper,“ “The American Magazine,“ “The Family Visitor,“ “The
N.Y. Presbyterian,“ “The Christian Alliance,“ and wrote several
successful text-books and many literary and historical works. He was a
leader in the noblest sense of the term.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Dwight, M.D., b. 1770, surgeon in United States Army,
practiced medicine in Providence; prepared the first school geography
ever published in the United States; wrote many historical works;
original advocate of special institutional care for the insane. After
eleven years of ardent championship he saw the first insane retreat
established.</p>

Seminary 1857, studied in Germany and France and was an eminent
physician in Philadelphia. Rev. S.G. Dwight, g. Union Theological

<p>Imperfectly as these names represent the achievements of the
descendants of Mary Edwards Dwight they do hint strongly at the vigor,
character and scholarship for which the family of Jonathan Edwards
stands in American life.</p>
<p>There is another large family of Dwights, direct descendants of
Jonathan Edwards, through his granddaughter, Rhoda Edwards, but these
are not, of course, included in this list of Mary’s descendants. Many of
these are eminent men, and reference is here made to their omission,
lest some one should think the facts regarding them were not
gathered.</p>
<p>A MODERN INSTANCE</p>
<p>It was known that John Eliot Woodbridge removed to Youngstown, O.,
about one hundred years ago, but no trace of him was found until these
chapters were in type when it appeared that this undiscovered remainder
was a most important branch of the family.</p>
<p>Congressman R.W. Taylor, of Ohio, chairman of the committee to pass
upon the case of Mr. Roberts of Utah, is a descendant of Jonathan
Edwards through John Eliot Woodbridge. His masterly treatment of the
case is recognized throughout the country. Here is what the “Detroit
Free Press“ said of him at the time of the investigation:</p>
<p>“In appearance he is not of the robust order of statesmen. With fair
face, shoulders that he has always permitted to droop, indispensable
eyeglasses, and hands that nine women out of ten would envy, modest
demeanor, and kindly instincts, he is among the last of men that a
casual observer would pick as fitting leaders where nerve,
aggressiveness, and fearless determination must be joined with an
ability to give and take in legal controversy.</p>
<p>“But this passing judgment would be at widest variance with the
truth. College mates of Taylor will recall the deceptiveness of this
outward appearance. It concealed muscles of steel and a will that had
only to be right in order to be invincible. He was the peer of any
amateur baseball catcher in his day, and held the same enviable place as
a student of the classics. He was the strong man for the D.K.E.
initiations, and took the same rank in all scholastic competitions.“</p>
<p>Dr. Timothy Woodbridge, of Youngstown, was a graduate of the medical
college of Philadelphia, and was one of the eminent physicians of
Eastern Ohio. His grandson, Benjamin Warner Wells, of Chicago, was a
graduate of Annapolis naval academy. He was Admiral Schley’s flag
secretary in the engagement at Santiago. Dr. John Eliot Woodbridge,
Cleveland, is an eminent specialist in typhoid fever cases. Robert
Walker Taylor was comptroller of the United States treasury for fifteen
years.</p>
