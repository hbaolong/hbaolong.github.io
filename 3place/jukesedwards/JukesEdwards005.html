<h4 id="chapter-iii">CHAPTER III</h4>
<p>THE INHERITANCE AND TRAINING OF MR. EDWARDS</p>
<p>No man can have the intellectual power, nobility of character, and
personal grandeur of Jonathan Edwards and transmit it to his children’s
children for a century and a half who has not himself had a great
inheritance. The whole teaching of the culture of animals and plants
leaves no room to question the persistency of character, and this is so
grandly exemplified in the descendants of Mr. Edwards that it is
interesting to see what inheritances were focused in him.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to find that the ancestors of Mr. Edwards were
cradled in the intellectual literary activities of the days of Queen
Elizabeth. The family is of Welsh origin and can be traced as far as
1282, when Edward, the conquerer, appeared. His great-great-grandfather,
Richard Edwards, who went from Wales to London about 1580, was a
clergyman in the Elizabethan period. Those were days which provided
tonic for the keenest spirits and brightest minds and professional men
profited most from the influence of Spencer, Bacon, and Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Among the first men to come to the new colonies in New England was
William, a son of this clergyman, born about 1620, who came to Hartford,
where his son Richard, born 1647, the grandfather of Jonathan, was an
eminently prosperous merchant. Richard was an only son. The father of
Jonathan, Timothy Edwards, was an only son in a family of seven.
Aristocracy was at its height in the household of the merchants of
Hartford in the middle of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Harvard was America’s only college, and it was a great event for a
young man to go from Hartford to Harvard, but this Timothy Edwards did,
and he took all attainable honors, graduating in 1661, taking the
degrees of A.B. and A.M. the same day, “an uncommon mark of respect paid
extraordinary proficiency in learning.“ This brilliant graduate of
Harvard was soon settled over the church at East Windsor, Conn., where
he remained sixty-five years as pastor.</p>
<p>Who can estimate the inheritance which comes to a child of such a
pastor who had been born in a merchant’s home. In the four generations
which stood behind Jonathan Edwards were two merchants and two
preachers, a grand combination for manly and intellectual power.</p>
<p>In this pastor’s home Jonathan Edwards was born October 5, 1703.
Those were days in which great men came into the world. There were born
within fifteen years of Jonathan Edwards a wonderful array of thinkers
along religious and philosophic lines, men who have molded the thought
and lives of a multitude of persons. Among these intellectual giants
born within fifteen years of Mr. Edwards were John Wesley, George
Whitefield, Swedenborg, Voltaire, Rousseau, and Hume.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the full significance of Mr. Edwards’ legacy
to the world, it is well to study some conditions of his life. It would
not be easy to find a man whose surroundings and training in childhood
were better than those of Jonathan Edwards. The parsonage on the banks
of the Connecticut was a delightful home. His parents and his
grandparents were ideal American Christian educated persons. He was
prepared for college by his father and mother. He was a devout little
Christian before he was twelve years of age. When he was but ten years
old he, with two other lads about his own age, made a booth of branches
in a retired spot in a neighboring wood, where the three went daily for
a season of prayer.</p>
<p>He began the study of Latin at six and at twelve had a good
preparation for college in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, all of which had
come from home study. He not only knew books, but he knew nature and
loved her. From early childhood to advanced years this remained true. He
entered Yale college at twelve years of age. In a letter which he wrote
while a college freshman he speaks of himself as a child. Not many
freshmen take that view of themselves, but a lad of twelve, away from
home at college could have been little more than a child.</p>
<p>He was the fifth in a family of eleven children, so that he had no
lack of companionship from both older and younger sisters. The older
sisters had contributed much to his preparation for college. They were a
never-failing source of inspiration. At fourteen he read in a masterly
way “Locke on the Human Understanding.“ It took a powerful hold on his
mind and greatly affected his life. In a letter to his father he asked a
special favor that he might have a copy of “The Art of Thinking,“ not
because it was necessary to his college work, but because he thought it
would be profitable.</p>
<p>While still in his teens he wrote a series of “Resolutions,“ the like
of which it would be difficult to duplicate in the case of any other
youth. These things are dwelt upon as indicating the way in which every
fibre of his being was prepared for the great moral and intellectual
legacy he left his children and his children’s children. Here are ten of
his seventy resolutions:</p>
<p>Resolved, to do whatever I think to be my duty, and most for the good
and advantage of mankind in general.</p>
<p>Resolved, so to do, whatever difficulties I meet with, how many
soever, and how great soever.</p>
<p>Resolved, to be continually endeavoring to find out some new
contrivance and invention to promote the forementioned things.</p>
<p>Resolved, never to lose one moment of time, but to improve it in the
most profitable way I possibly can.</p>
<p>Resolved, to live with all my might while I do live.</p>
<p>Resolved, to be endeavoring to find out fit objects of charity and
liberality.</p>
<p>Resolved, never to do anything out of revenge.</p>
<p>Resolved, never to suffer the least motions of anger towards
irrational beings.</p>
<p>Resolved, never to speak evil of any one, so that it shall tend to
his dishonor, more or less, upon no account except for some real
good.</p>
<p>Resolved, to maintain the strictest temperance in eating and
drinking.</p>
<p>Yale in the days of Mr. Edwards was not the Yale of the closing year
of the nineteenth century. It has now 2,500 students and has had 19,000
graduates. It had a very humble beginning in March, 1702, the year
before Mr. Edwards was born. It began with one lone student. The father
of Jonathan Edwards had been greatly interested in the starting of the
college. In 1701, Rev. Mr. Russell, of Branford, a graduate of Harvard,
as was the senior Edwards, invited to his home ten other Connecticut
pastors of whom nine were graduates of Harvard. Each brought from his
library some of his most valuable books, and laying them upon
Mr. Russell’s table, said: “I give these books for the founding of a
college in this colony.“ This produced a profound impression upon the
clergymen of Connecticut, notably upon the graduates of Harvard. The
first year the college was nominally located at Saybrook, but as there
was only one student he lived with the president at Killingworth, now
Clinton, nine miles away.</p>
<p>When Jonathan Edwards, a lad of twelve, entered college, there had
been, all told, only about fifty graduates. It was during the time that
he was a student that the college took the name of Yale. The first year
he was there the college was in three places at the same time because of
dissensions among the students, and the very small class graduated in
two places because neither faction would go to the other place. In all
these agitations Mr. Edwards took no part. He simply devoted himself to
his studies and followed the line of least resistance so far as taking
sides in a senseless controversy was concerned. After graduation he
remained at Yale two years for post-graduate work, mostly in theology,
and then accepted an invitation to preach for the leading Presbyterian
church in New York City; but after eight months he returned to Yale as a
tutor and remained two years.</p>
<p>At this time he was very severe in discipline, bending every energy
to securing the right conditions for the most and best work. This is
what he wrote in his diary when he was twenty-one:</p>
<p>“By a sparingness in diet, and eating, as much as may be, what is
light and easy of digestion, I shall doubtless be able to think more
clearly, and shall gain time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>By lengthening out my life.</p></li>
<li><p>Shall need less time for digestion after meals.</p></li>
<li><p>Shall be able to study more closely, without injury to my
health.</p></li>
<li><p>Shall need less time for sleep.</p></li>
<li><p>Shall more seldom be troubled with the headache.“</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. Edwards was twenty-three years of age when he was ordained at
Northampton as associate pastor with his grandfather Stoddard, then in
his 84th year, and the 54th year of his pastorate. Soon after this
Mr. Stoddard died and Mr. Edwards became pastor in full charge and
remained for twenty-five years. He was a great student and thinker. He
rose at four o’clock and spent thirteen hours a day in his study. It is
worth while to follow the personal intellectual habits of the man whose
descendants we are to study. When he was ready for the consideration of
a great subject he would set apart a week for it and mounting his horse
early Monday morning would start off for the hills and forests. When he
had thought himself up to a satisfactory intensity he would alight,
fasten his horse, go off into the woods and think himself through that
particular stage of the argument, then he would pin a bit of paper on
some particular place on his coat as a reminder of the conclusion he had
reached. He would then ride on some miles further and repeat the
experience. Not infrequently he would be gone the entire week on a
thinking expedition, returning with the front of his coat covered with
the scalps of intellectual victories. Without stopping for any domestic
salutations he would go at once to his study and taking off these bits
of paper in the same order in which he had put them on would carefully
write out his argument. In nothing did Jonathan Edwards stand out so
clearly as boy, youth and man as in his sacrifice of every other feature
of his life for the attainment of power as a thinker.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards has gone into history as a theologian of the most
stalwart character. It is undeniable that he preached the most terrific
doctrine ever uttered by an American leader, but this was only the
logical result of the intellectual projection of his effort to make
sacrifices in order to benefit humanity. As a child he sacrificed
everything for health and virtue that he might have influence, and as a
man he knew no other plan or purpose in life. His masterpiece is upon
the “will“ which he developed to the full in himself.</p>
<p>The greatest religious awakening that the Western world has ever
known was started in his church at Northampton, not over ecclesiastical
differences, or theological discussion but over a question of morality
among the young people of the town. It had to do with the impropriety of
the young ladies entertaining their gentlemen friends on Sunday evenings
and especially of their allowing them to remain to such unreasonable
hours. And the issue which ultimately drove him from his pastorate,
after twenty-five years of service, by an almost unanimous vote was not
one of ecclesiasticism or theology, but of morals among the young
people. He insisted upon vigorous action in relation to the loose and as
he thought immoral reading of the youth of the town. As this involved
some prominent families he had to retire from the pastorate.</p>
<p>The views of Mr. Edwards on pastoral work reveal the singleness of
purpose of the man as a student and thinker. He never made pastoral
calls. He had no criticism to make of those pastors who had talent for
entertaining people by occasional calls, but as he had no gifts in that
direction he regarded it advisable to use his time in cultivating such
talents as he had. Whoever wished to talk with him about personal, moral
or religious conditions found in him a profitable counsellor. In his
preaching, which was equal to anything America has ever known, he made
no attempt to win his hearers by tricks of oratory or by emotional
appeals, though he had a most fascinating personality. He was six feet
in height, slender in form, with a high, broad forehead, eyes piercing
and luminous and a serene countenance. In the pulpit he was graceful,
easy, natural and earnest, though he had little action. He rested his
left elbow on the pulpit and held his manuscript in his left hand while
with his right he turned the leaves. In him were combined the
intellectual and moral vigor which are calculated to make the progenitor
of a great family.</p>
