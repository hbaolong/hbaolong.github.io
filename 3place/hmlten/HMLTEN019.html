<h4 id="scene-7">Scene 7</h4>
<p>(The King and Laertes enter another room in the castle.)</p>
<p>KING: Now you know the whole story.</p>
<p>After Hamlet killed your father, He tried to kill me.</p>
<p>LAERTES: It appears to be true. But tell me why You did not punish
him for these crimes.</p>
<p>KING: For two special reasons. The queen, His mother, lives almost
for his looks.</p>
<p>And I love her too much to let her be hurt. Also, the common people
love him.</p>
<p>No matter what I said about him, They would never have believed
it.</p>
<p>Their anger would have turned on me.</p>
<p>LAERTES (bitterly): And so I have lost a noble father and</p>
<p>My sister has been driven to madness.</p>
<p>But my revenge will come!</p>
<p>KING: Do not lose sleep over it. Do not think That I am ready to
forget what happened. You shall soon hear more.</p>
<p>I loved your father, and I love myself.</p>
<p>I will have my revenge for Hamlet’s crimes! (A messenger enters.)</p>
<p>MESSENGER: Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.</p>
<p>This one is for you. This is for the queen. KING: From Hamlet! Who
brought them?</p>
<p>MESSENGER: Sailors, my lord.</p>
<p>(Messenger exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Laertes, you shall hear this.</p>
<p>(reading): “Your majesty, I am back in your kingdom. Tomorrow I would
like to see you and tell you the reasons for my sudden and strange
return. Hamlet.” What does this</p>
<p>mean? Have the others come back, too?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Is it Hamlet’s handwriting?</p>
<p>KING: Yes. What does it mean?</p>
<p>LAERTES: I have no idea, my lord.</p>
<p>But let him come.</p>
<p>It warms the sickness in my heart</p>
<p>That I shall have my revenge so soon.</p>
<p>KING: Will you take my advice, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Yes, my lord—as long as you</p>
<p>Do not advise me to let Hamlet live.</p>
<p>KING: I have a plan for his death.</p>
<p>Even his mother will call it an accident. LAERTES: My lord, I want a
hand in it!</p>
<p>KING: I have heard that you are good at fencing. They say you shine
at the sport. In fact, Hamlet is jealous of your reputation and Would
like nothing more than to beat you. Now let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>What would you most like to do to Hamlet</p>
<p>To show that you are your father’s son? LAERTES: To cut his throat in
the church!</p>
<p>KING: Revenge could take place anywhere.</p>
<p>But, good Laertes, here’s a better plan: Hamlet will be told that you
are here.</p>
<p>We’ll have some men praise your skill</p>
<p>At fencing and make bets on who would win In a duel—you or Hamlet.
He, unsuspecting, Will not check the tips of the swords.</p>
<p>It would be easy for you to choose a sword Whose tip was not covered
for safety.</p>
<p>Then, in one practice pass,</p>
<p>You can settle with him for your father.</p>
<p>LAERTES: I will do it!</p>
<p>And to make sure, I’ll put some poison</p>
<p>On the tip of my sword. I have it already. It is so strong that there
is no antidote.</p>
<p>KING: Let’s think some more about this.</p>
<p>If our plan fails, it would make us look bad. It would be better not
to try than to fail. That is why we should have a backup plan. Let me
see . . . Ah! I have it!</p>
<p>As you duel, you’ll both get thirsty.</p>
<p>When he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared A cup for him. If he by
chance escapes</p>
<p>The poison on your sword, He’ll get it from the cup.</p>
<p>(The Queen enters, greatly upset.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: One sorrow after another— Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Drowned! Oh, where?</p>
<p>QUEEN: There is a willow tree by the brook.</p>
<p>Its leaves reflect in the glassy stream.</p>
<p>While making flower chains there, she</p>
<p>Climbed up on an overhanging tree branch To hang her garlands from
it.</p>
<p>The branch broke off, and she fell into the Weeping brook. For a
while, her clothes</p>
<p>spread wide</p>
<p>And held her up like a mermaid.</p>
<p>But then, heavy with water, her clothes</p>
<p>Pulled the poor wretch to muddy death. LAERTES: Alas, then she is
drowned?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Drowned, drowned . . .</p>
<p>LAERTES: You’ve had too much water,</p>
<p>Poor Ophelia, so I’ll hold back my tears.</p>
<p>But I’m only human. I cannot. (He cries.) When these tears are gone,
that will be The last of the woman in me. (He exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Let us follow him, Gertrude.</p>
<p>It took all I had to calm his rage!</p>
<p>This sad news is sure to revive it.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us follow him.</p>
<p>(The King and Queen exit.)</p>
