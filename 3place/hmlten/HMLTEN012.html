<h4 id="scene-4">Scene 4</h4>
<p>(The Queen and Polonius enter her room.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: He is on his way. Now, be firm.</p>
<p>Tell him his pranks have been out of hand.</p>
<p>Say that you have spared him trouble until now. I’ll hide here
silently.</p>
<p>HAMLET (from offstage): Mother, Mother!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Hide! I hear him coming.</p>
<p>(Polonius hides behind the drapes. Hamlet enters.) HAMLET: Now,
Mother, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>QUEEN (referring to King Claudius): Hamlet, you have offended your
father.</p>
<p>HAMLET (referring to the dead King Hamlet):</p>
<p>Mother, you have offended my father.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Have you forgotten who I am?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Of course not. You are the queen,</p>
<p>Your husband’s brother’s wife, and—</p>
<p>I wish it were not so—you are my mother.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Don’t speak to me like that!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come, come, sit down. Do not move.</p>
<p>Sit here until I set up a mirror where you May see the innermost part
of yourself.</p>
<p>QUEEN: What will you do? Murder me? Help, help!</p>
<p>POLONIUS (from behind the drapes): Help!</p>
<p>HAMLET (drawing his sword): What’s that—a rat?</p>
<p>(He stabs through the drapes.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Oh, I am killed! (Polonius dies.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, my, what have you done?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I don’t know. Is it the king?</p>
<p>(Hamlet draws forth Polonius.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, what a rash and bloody deed!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Almost as bad, good Mother,</p>
<p>As killing a king and marrying his brother.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Killing a king?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, lady, that’s what I said.</p>
<p>(to Polonius): You wretched fool, farewell! I thought you were the
king. You found out That being too busy is dangerous.</p>
<p>(to the queen): Stop wringing your hands.</p>
<p>Sit down, and let me wring your heart.</p>
<p>For so I shall, unless it has become too hard.</p>
<p>QUEEN: What have I done, that you dare</p>
<p>Wag your tongue so rudely against me?</p>
<p>HAMLET: An act that takes the rose</p>
<p>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</p>
<p>And sets a blister there. An act that makes Marriage vows as false as
gamblers’ oaths.</p>
<p>All of heaven is sick from thinking about it. QUEEN: What act? What
do you mean?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Think about your husband, so good That he was almost like a
god.</p>
<p>Now look at your present husband.</p>
<p>Do you have eyes?</p>
<p>You cannot call it love, for at your age, The passion in the blood is
tame.</p>
<p>Who would go from my father to his own brother?</p>
<p>What devil fooled you into doing it? Oh, shame! Where is your
blush?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, Hamlet, speak no more.</p>
<p>You turn my eyes into my very soul.</p>
<p>There I see such black and grained spots That will never come
clean.</p>
<p>I beg you, say no more!</p>
<p>These words are like daggers in my ears. No more, sweet Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He is a murderer and a villain,</p>
<p>A wretch not worth a twentieth of a tenth Of your former husband. A
monster who Stole the crown and put it in his pocket!</p>
<p>QUEEN: No more!</p>
<p>HAMLET: A king of rags and patches!</p>
<p>(The Ghost enters, visible only to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>Save me and hover over me, you angels!</p>
<p>(to the Ghost): What is it, your grace? QUEEN: Oh, no, he’s mad!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Have you come to scold your son Who has not yet taken
revenge? Tell me!</p>
<p>GHOST: Do not forget. This visit Is meant to push you a little.</p>
<p>But, look at your mother. She suffers.</p>
<p>Step between her and her fighting soul. Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How is it with you, lady?</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, how is it with you?</p>
<p>You look at nothing and speak to the air?</p>
<p>What are you looking at?</p>
<p>HAMLET: At him, at him! See how pale he is!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Dear son, nothing is there.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do you see nothing there?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Nothing at all.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Did you hear nothing?</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, look there! See how it steals away!</p>
<p>My father, dressed as when he was alive.</p>
<p>Look—he is going out the door now! (The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: You are seeing things that don’t exist. HAMLET: Mother,
confess your sins to heaven. Repent what’s past. Avoid what is to come.
QUEEN: Son, you have broken my heart in two.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then throw away the worse part</p>
<p>And live more purely with the other half.</p>
<p>Good night. But do not go to my uncle’s bed.</p>
<p>Pretend to be good, even if you are not. Stay away tonight, and
that</p>
<p>Will make it easier tomorrow night.</p>
<p>The next night, it will be even easier.</p>
<p>(pointing to Polonius): For this, I am sorry, But it has pleased
heaven</p>
<p>To punish me with this, and this with me.</p>
<p>I will answer for the death I gave him. So again, good night.</p>
<p>I must be cruel, only to be kind—</p>
<p>Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. But one more thing, good
lady . . .</p>
<p>QUEEN: What is it?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I must go to England. Did you know? QUEEN: I had forgotten.
But, yes, you are right.</p>
<p>HAMLET: My two friends—whom I trust as I Trust poisonous snakes—will
go with me To deliver sealed letters from the king.</p>
<p>So be it. It’s fun to see the hangman hanged With his own noose. I
know the plan,</p>
<p>And they won’t be able to get the best of me. (pointing to Polonius):
I’ll drag the body out. Indeed, this adviser is now so still, so grave,
Who was in life a foolish old knave.</p>
<p>Good night, Mother.</p>
<p>(All exit, Hamlet dragging out Polonius.)</p>
