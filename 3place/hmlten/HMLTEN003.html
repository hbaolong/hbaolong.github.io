<h4 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(King Claudius, Queen Gertrude, Prince Hamlet,</p>
<p>Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants enter
a room of state in the castle at Elsinore.)</p>
<p>KING: The memory of our dear brother’s death Is still fresh. Our
hearts are full of grief. Yet, we must think of our kingdom,</p>
<p>Which needs a leader in this warlike time. Therefore we have taken as
wife</p>
<p>Our former sister-in-law.</p>
<p>Now, as you know, young Fortinbras</p>
<p>Thinks that we are weak. He thinks that Our late dear brother’s
death</p>
<p>Has left our state in confusion and chaos. Thinking he has an
advantage, he has been Pestering us to surrender those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father to our brother.</p>
<p>That is the reason for this meeting.</p>
<p>We have written to the King of Norway, The uncle of young
Fortinbras.</p>
<p>He is sick and bedridden. He knows little Of his nephew’s actions. We
asked him To order his nephew to leave us alone.</p>
<p>We want you, Cornelius and Voltimand, To take this letter to the King
of Norway.</p>
<p>Now farewell—and do your duty quickly! (King Claudius hands them a
letter.)</p>
<p>CORNELIUS AND VOLTIMAND: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>(They bow and exit.)</p>
<p>KING: Now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</p>
<p>You mentioned a request. What is it?</p>
<p>LAERTES: My good lord, I ask your permission</p>
<p>To return to France. I came here willingly To show my support for
your coronation. Now, I must confess, that duty done,</p>
<p>My wishes bend again toward France.</p>
<p>KING: Do you have your father’s permission? What does Polonius
say?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, he has my permission.</p>
<p>KING: Enjoy your youth, Laertes. Time is yours, And you may spend it
as you like!</p>
<p>But now, my nephew Hamlet, and my son— HAMLET (aside): I may be your
nephew,</p>
<p>But I will never be your son!</p>
<p>KING: Why are you still so gloomy?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Good Hamlet, cast off your dark mood. You know that all living
things must die, Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, madam, I know.</p>
<p>KING: It is sweet of you, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To mourn this way for your father.</p>
<p>But, your father lost a father.</p>
<p>And that lost father also lost his.</p>
<p>You must mourn for a time. But to keep on Mourning so long is
stubborn and unmanly. It shows a weak heart, an impatient mind. It is a
fault against heaven, against the dead, And against nature. Please stop
grieving. Think of us as a father. Let all see that</p>
<p>You are heir to the throne, and I love you No less than the dearest
father loves his son! Your wish to return to school in Wittenberg Goes
against our wishes. We ask you to stay Here in the cheer and comfort of
our eye, Our chief courtier, nephew, and our son.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Please, Hamlet, stay here with us.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I shall obey you, Mother.</p>
<p>KING: Why, it is a loving and fair reply.</p>
<p>(to the Queen): Madam, come.</p>
<p>(All exit but Hamlet.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, that this too, too solid flesh</p>
<p>Would melt, thaw, and turn into a dew! Or if only suicide were not a
sin!</p>
<p>Oh, God! Oh, God!</p>
<p>How weary, stale, flat, and useless</p>
<p>The world seems! It is an unweeded garden, Gone to seed. That it
should come to this! Not even two months dead, so fine a king! He loved
my mother so much that</p>
<p>He wouldn’t allow the wind to blow too hard On her face. She would
hang on him</p>
<p>As if her appetite grew by what it fed on. Yet, within a month—let me
not think of it! Frailty, your name is woman!</p>
<p>Oh, God! A beast with no power to reason Would have mourned longer!
Now,</p>
<p>Married to my uncle—my father’s brother— But no more like my
father</p>
<p>Than I am like Hercules. Within a month, Before the salt of her tears
had left her eyes, She married. Oh, most wicked speed!</p>
<p>This marriage can come to no good.</p>
<p>But break, my heart—I must hold my tongue!</p>
<p>(Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo enter.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Hail to your lordship!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Hello, Horatio! What brought you Here from Wittenberg?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I came to see your father’s funeral.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do not mock me, fellow student.</p>
<p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding. HORATIO: Indeed, it
followed soon after.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Thrift, Horatio! The funeral meats Were served cold at the
marriage tables.</p>
<p>I wish I had never seen that day, Horatio! My father!—I think I see
my father.</p>
<p>HORATIO (surprised): Where, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p>
<p>HORATIO: I saw him once. He was a good king.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He was a man, all in all.</p>
<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p>HORATIO: My lord, I think I saw him last night.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Saw who?</p>
<p>HORATIO: My lord . . . the king, your father.</p>
<p>HAMLET: My father? Let me hear!</p>
<p>HORATIO: Yes. Listen, I will tell you about it. For two nights,
Marcellus and Bernardo Saw a figure like your father,</p>
<p>Dressed from head to toe in armor.</p>
<p>They told me about it in secret.</p>
<p>I kept watch with them the third night. The ghostly figure came.</p>
<p>I knew your father. It looked just like him. HAMLET: Did you speak to
it?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I did, but it did not answer.</p>
<p>HAMLET: It is very strange.</p>
<p>HORATIO: As I live, my honored lord, it is true. We thought it our
duty to let you know of it.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Indeed, sirs—but it troubles me.</p>
<p>Are you on watch tonight?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS AND BERNARDO: We are, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He was dressed in armor, you say?</p>
<p>BOTH: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then you did not see his face?</p>
<p>HORATIO: We did. He wore the visor up.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Was he frowning?</p>
<p>HORATIO: His face was more sad than angry.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I wish I had been there!</p>
<p>I will watch with you tonight.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will walk again. If it looks like My noble father, I’ll
speak to it.</p>
<p>Do not tell anyone else about this.</p>
<p>I’ll see you tonight, between 11 and 12. ALL: Until then,
farewell.</p>
<p>(Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo exit.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: My father’s spirit—in arms! All is not well.</p>
<p>I wish night had already come! Until then, Be still, my soul. Foul
deeds will rise,</p>
<p>Though the earth hides them from our eyes.</p>
<p>(Hamlet exits.)</p>
