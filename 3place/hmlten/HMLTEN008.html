<h4 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(The King, the Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and attendants enter
a room in the castle.)</p>
<p>KING: Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and</p>
<p>Guildenstern! We have missed you!</p>
<p>We asked you to come so quickly because</p>
<p>We need a favor from you. You have heard Something about the changes
in Hamlet. He is different both inside and out.</p>
<p>The reason—other than his father’s death— I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>You two are close to his age and have been Brought up with him since
childhood.</p>
<p>I ask you both to stay here in our court For a short time. Spend time
with him.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find out what is wrong.</p>
<p>If we knew, perhaps we could help him.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Gentlemen, he has talked about you.</p>
<p>I am sure there are no two men living</p>
<p>That he likes any better than you.</p>
<p>If it will please you to spend some time here, Your visit will be
royally rewarded.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No reward is necessary.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: We are happy to help.</p>
<p>KING: Thank you, Rosencrantz and Gentle Guildenstern.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Thank you, Guildenstern and</p>
<p>Gentle Rosencrantz. I beg you to visit My too-much-changed son at
once.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit. Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My good lord, the ambassadors From Norway have joyfully
returned.</p>
<p>KING: You have always brought good news!</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Have I, my lord? I assure you,</p>
<p>Majesty, that my duty is as sacred to me As my soul. And I think I
have found The very cause of Hamlet’s madness.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, speak of that. I long to hear it! POLONIUS: First, talk to
the ambassadors.</p>
<p>My news shall be dessert to that great feast. KING: Very well. Bring
them in.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits.)</p>
<p>(to the Queen): He tells me that he knows</p>
<p>Why Hamlet has been behaving so strangely.</p>
<p>QUEEN: I thought the reasons were clear—</p>
<p>His father’s death and our quick marriage.</p>
<p>KING: Well, let us hear what Polonius says.</p>
<p>(Polonius enters, with Voltimand and Cornelius.)</p>
<p>Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, What news do you have from
Norway?</p>
<p>VOLTIMAND: The King of Norway thought</p>
<p>That his nephew was preparing for war</p>
<p>With Poland. But as he looked into it,</p>
<p>He found it was truly against your highness. Then he ordered young
Fortinbras to stop. In brief, Fortinbras obeys and vows</p>
<p>Never to take arms against your majesty. At this, the overjoyed King
of Norway</p>
<p>Gave him enough money to take his soldiers Against Poland.</p>
<p>(Voltimand gives the king a paper.)</p>
<p>The King of Norway asks your permission For his nephew to march
through your lands On his way to Poland.</p>
<p>KING: When we have more time,</p>
<p>We’ll read, answer, and think about this. Meantime, we thank you for
your efforts. Rest now. Tonight, we’ll feast together.</p>
<p>(Voltimand and Cornelius exit.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: That was good news!</p>
<p>And now, since brevity is the soul of wit, I will be brief: Your
noble son is mad.</p>
<p>It is true that it is a pity,</p>
<p>And a pity it is that it is true.</p>
<p>But, to get to the point—</p>
<p>Let us agree that he is mad. Now we must Find out the cause of this
effect,</p>
<p>Or, rather, the cause of this defect.</p>
<p>My daughter has given me this.</p>
<p>(Polonius holds up a letter.)</p>
<p>Now, listen and think about it. (reading) “To the heavenly, and my
soul’s idol,</p>
<p>The most beautified Ophelia”— (He comments on the letter.)</p>
<p>That’s a stupid word, a vile word.</p>
<p>“Beautified” is a vile word. But listen.</p>
<p>(reading again): “Doubt that the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun
does move.</p>
<p>Doubt truth to be a liar.</p>
<p>But never doubt that I love.</p>
<p>Oh, Ophelia, I am not very good at this. But please believe that I
love you best.</p>
<p>Oh, most best, believe it. Farewell.</p>
<p>I am yours forever, dear lady. Hamlet. ”</p>
<p>(He folds up the letter.)</p>
<p>In obedience, my daughter showed me this.</p>
<p>KING: But how has she received his love?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Well, when I first found out about it,</p>
<p>I went right away and told my daughter,</p>
<p>“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of your reach.</p>
<p>This must not be. ” And then I told her</p>
<p>That she should lock herself away from him, Admit no messengers,
receive no gifts.</p>
<p>She took my advice. He fell into a sadness, Then into a fast, then
into a weakness,</p>
<p>Then into a lightness. In this way, he fell into The madness that all
of us now mourn.</p>
<p>KING: Do you think this is the reason?</p>
<p>QUEEN: It may be. It’s very likely.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Have I ever been wrong before?</p>
<p>KING: Not that I know.</p>
<p>How may we test your idea?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: You know sometimes he walks For hours at a time here in the
lobby.</p>
<p>QUEEN: So he does, indeed.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: At such a time, I’ll make sure that My daughter is
nearby.</p>
<p>You and I will hide behind the drapes and Watch their meeting. If he
does not love her, And has not gone mad because of it, then I’ll quit my
job and be a farmer!</p>
<p>KING: We will try it.</p>
<p>(Hamlet enters, reading a book.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: See how sadly he comes, reading.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Go away, I beg you, both of you.</p>
<p>I’ll speak to him presently. Please leave.</p>
<p>(The King, the Queen, and attendants exit.)</p>
<p>How are you, my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I am well, thanks to God.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes. You are a sly fishmonger.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Not I, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then I wish you were that honest.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Honest, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, sir. In this world, an honest man Is one in ten
thousand.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: That’s very true, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do you have a daughter?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: I have, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do not let her walk in the sun.</p>
<p>She could get hurt if she goes outside.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>(aside): Still talking about my daughter. Yet he did not know me at
first. He thought I sold fish. He is far gone. Truly, in my youth, I
suffered for love in much the</p>
<p>same way. I’ll speak to him again.</p>
<p>(to Hamlet): What do you read, my lord? HAMLET: Words, words,
words.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Between who?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: I mean, the matter that you read.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Lies, sir! The writer says here that old men have gray
beards, that their faces are wrinkled, and that their eyes are runny. He
also says they lack brains and have weak</p>
<p>legs. All of this, sir, I most strongly believe, yet I don’t think it
should be written down.</p>
<p>POLONIUS (aside): Though this be madness, yet there is a method in
it. (to Hamlet): My lord, I must most humbly take leave of you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Sir, you cannot take from me anything that I will more
willingly give—except my life, except my life, except my life . . .</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Farewell, my lord.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: These tiresome old fools!</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Good lads, what’s the news?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then the end of time must be near! But your news is not true.
Let me ask you a question. What have you ever done to Fortune that she
sends you to prison here?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: Prison, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Denmark is a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Then the world is one.</p>
<p>HAMLET: A big one, with many rooms and dungeons, Denmark being the
worst.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: We do not think so, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, then, it is not a prison to you! For there is nothing
either good or bad unless you think it so. To me, it is a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Then your ambition makes it one. Denmark is too narrow
for your mind.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, God, I could live in a nutshell, and count myself a king
of infinite space —except that I have bad dreams.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: Those dreams, indeed, are ambition, for ambition is
merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p>HAMLET: A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Truly. And I believe that ambition is so light and airy
that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Shall we go to the court? For, truly,</p>
<p>I cannot think about this anymore.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN: We’ll wait upon you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, you won’t. I will not group you with the rest of my
servants. To tell the truth, I am most dreadfully waited upon. But, in
the familiar way of friendship,</p>
<p>what brings you here to Elsinore?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: To visit you. No other reason. HAMLET: Thank you. But,
really, dear friends,</p>
<p>were you not sent for? Come, tell me the</p>
<p>truth. Come, come. Speak to me!</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, anything—but answer the</p>
<p>question. You were sent for, weren’t you?</p>
<p>I know the king and queen sent for you.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: For what reason, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: You tell me. In the name of our</p>
<p>friendship, be truthful with me.</p>
<p>Were you sent for or not?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will tell you why, so you won’t have to break your secrecy
with the king and queen. I have lately—but I don’t know</p>
<p>why—lost all joy and stopped exercising. Indeed, I feel so bad that
the earth seems to me a sterile place. This most excellent air—why, it
seems no more to me than a foul collection of vapors. What a piece of
work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in mind! In shape and
motion,</p>
<p>how admirable! In action, how like an angel! In understanding, how
like a god! The beauty of the world! The highest of animals! And yet to
me, what is this</p>
<p>piece of dust? Man does not delight me, no. Nor does woman, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: I had no such thoughts.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why did you laugh, then, when I said “Man does not delight
me”?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: I was thinking, my lord, if man does not delight you,
the actors who are coming will get a weak welcome.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Which actors are they?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: The ones you like so much—the tragedy-actors from the
city.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why are they traveling? In the city,</p>
<p>they seemed to be doing well, in reputation and profit. Are they
still as well-liked as</p>
<p>they were when I was there?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No, indeed, they are not.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why? Have they grown rusty?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No, they are still good. But there is a new group of
child actors. They are very popular now. They are quite in fashion.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You say they are children? Who takes</p>
<p>care of them? How are they fed? Will they quit acting when their
voices change? Will they say later, when they grow into common actors,
that their writers do them wrong?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: There has been much talk about it. No one knows how the
argument will be resolved. Still, that is why the tragedy- actors are on
the road now.</p>
<p>(Trumpets from offstage announce the actors.) GUILDENSTERN: Here come
the players.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived about me.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: In what way, my dear lord? HAMLET: I am but mad
north-northwest.</p>
<p>When the wind is from the south, I know a hawk from a handsaw!</p>
<p>(Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Greetings, gentlemen!</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern):</p>
<p>That great baby you see there is not yet out of his baby clothes.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ (aside to Hamlet): Perhaps the old</p>
<p>man is in his second childhood.</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside): I predict that he comes to tell me of the actors.
Listen.</p>
<p>(to Polonius): Greetings, sir.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, the actors are here.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Is that so?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Upon my honor.</p>
<p>(Four or five actors enter.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Welcome, gentlemen! Welcome, all! (to Polonius): My good
lord, will you see that the players have good rooms? Let them make
themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, I will. Come, sirs.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits, with all the actors but the first.</p>
<p>Hamlet speaks to the remaining actor.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Can you play “The Murder of Gonzago”?</p>
<p>FIRST ACTOR: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: We’ll have it tomorrow night. You</p>
<p>could, if I needed it, study a speech of some 12 or 16 lines, which
I’ll write and</p>
<p>add to the play, couldn’t you? FIRST ACTOR: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Very well. (pointing where Polonius has exited): Follow that
lord, and see that you do not mock him.</p>
<p>(First actor exits. Hamlet speaks to Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern.)</p>
<p>I’ll see you tonight. Welcome to Elsinore. ROSENCRANTZ: Thank you, my
good lord.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Now I am alone.</p>
<p>Oh, what a rogue I am! Am I a coward?</p>
<p>I must be, or I would have fed all the birds With the king’s
body—that bloody villain! Oh, revenge!</p>
<p>I, the son of a dear father murdered,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must unpack my heart with
words.</p>
<p>Well, I have heard that guilty creatures,</p>
<p>Sitting at a play, have been struck to the soul By a scene reminding
them of their own acts. Sometimes they are prompted to admit</p>
<p>Their evil actions. I’ll have these actors Play something like my
father’s murder Before my uncle. I’ll observe his looks.</p>
<p>If he reacts, I’ll know what to do.</p>
<p>The ghost I have seen may be the devil.</p>
<p>I know the devil can take a pleasing shape. Perhaps, due to my
weakness and sadness, He is leading me down an evil path.</p>
<p>I want to trust the ghost—but I can’t be sure That it was my father’s
spirit.</p>
<p>I need more proof. The play’s the thing In which I’ll catch the
conscience of the king.</p>
<p>(Hamlet exits.)</p>
