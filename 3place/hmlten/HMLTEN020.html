<h4 id="act-5">ACT 5</h4>
<p>(A gravedigger and his helper enter a churchyard.)</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Is she to have a Christian burial Even though she was a
suicide?</p>
<p>HELPER: That’s what I heard.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: How can that be?</p>
<p>Did she drown herself in self-defense? HELPER: The coroner said it
wasn’t suicide.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s getting the benefit of the doubt Because she was a
gentlewoman.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Who knows? And who cares? All I want is a drink. Why
don’t you go</p>
<p>And get us something at the tavern?</p>
<p>(Helper exits. Hamlet and Horatio enter, and stand at a</p>
<p>distance. They watch as the gravedigger digs and sings.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Has he no feeling for his work?</p>
<p>How can he sing while he digs a grave?</p>
<p>HORATIO: He is so used to digging graves That he doesn’t really think
about it.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You’re probably right.</p>
<p>Only those who don’t work very hard Have time for dainty
feelings.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER (singing): “A pickaxe And a spade, a spade,</p>
<p>Dig a deep pit for the latest guest.</p>
<p>Bring a burial sheet for the lovely maid Who will soon be here for
her final rest. ”</p>
<p>(He hits a skull with his shovel and throws it up to the
surface.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: There’s a skull. Could it be The skull of a lawyer?</p>
<p>Where are his arguments now, his cases,</p>
<p>His evidence, and his tricks? Why does he let This rude man now knock
him about</p>
<p>With a dirty shovel? Shouldn’t he accuse The brute of assault? Hmmm.
This fellow Might have been a great buyer of land.</p>
<p>Is this how he ends up—</p>
<p>With his fine head full of fine dirt?</p>
<p>All his deeds and legal papers would</p>
<p>Just about fit in this box. Must the buyer</p>
<p>Himself have no more room than this? HORATIO: Not an inch more, my
lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will speak to this fellow.</p>
<p>(to the gravedigger): Whose grave is this? GRAVEDIGGER: Mine,
sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What man do you dig it for?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: For no man, sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What woman, then?</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: For no woman, either.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Who is to be buried in it?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: One who wds a woman, sir.</p>
<p>But, rest her soul, she’s dead.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How careful you are with words! How long have you been a
gravedigger?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: I began on the day that our</p>
<p>Last King Hamlet defeated old Fortinbras, Thirty years ago. It was
the very day</p>
<p>That young Hamlet was born— He that has been sent to England.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why was he sent to England?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Why, because he is mad.</p>
<p>He shall recover his wits there.</p>
<p>Or, if he does not, it won’t matter much. HAMLET: Why?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: No one in England will notice. There, all the men are as
mad as he.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Say, how long will a man lie in the earth before he rots?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Eight or nine years. (He picks up a skull.) Here’s a
skull now. This skull has</p>
<p>been in the earth for twenty-three years. HAMLET: Whose was it?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: This, sir, was Yorick’s skull— the king’s jester.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Let me see. (He takes the skull.)</p>
<p>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. He was a fellow of infinite
fun.</p>
<p>He carried me on his back 1,000 times.</p>
<p>I hate to think of this!</p>
<p>Where are your jokes now, your tricks, Your songs, your flashes of
merriment? Not one is left to mock your grinning? Go to my lady’s room
right now.</p>
<p>Tell her that no matter how thick she puts On her makeup, she will
end up like this. Make her laugh at that.</p>
<p>Horatio, do you think Alexander the Great Looked like this in the
earth?</p>
<p>HORATIO: Just the same.</p>
<p>HAMLET: And smelled like this? Pah!</p>
<p>(He throws down the skull.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Just the same, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: To what lowly uses we may return,</p>
<p>Horatio! Even the noble dust of Alexander Might end up stopping up a
knot-hole.</p>
<p>HORATIO: You think too much, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: But just consider it for a minute: Alexander died, Alexander
was buried,</p>
<p>Alexander returned to dust. The dust is earth.</p>
<p>From earth we get clay. That very clay</p>
<p>Might someday stop a hole in a beer-barrel. The imperial Caesar, dead
and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. Oh, that he
who awed the world might</p>
<p>Patch a wall to keep the winter wind out! But, that’s enough for now.
Look!</p>
<p>Here comes the king.</p>
<p>(Priests enter, leading a procession. The King, the Queen, Laertes,
and mourners follow. Attendants carry a coffin.)</p>
<p>Who could be in the coffin?</p>
<p>The queen is here, but so few mourners! This suggests a suicide. It
must have been Someone of high rank. Let’s hide and watch.</p>
<p>(Hamlet and Horatio hide.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: What other ceremonies will there be?</p>
<p>FIRST PRIEST: We have already done all we can</p>
<p>For her funeral. Her death was doubtful.</p>
<p>She should be buried in unblessed ground, And pebbles thrown on
her.</p>
<p>Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,</p>
<p>With flowers and prayers and funeral bells. LAERTES (sadly): Can no
more be done?</p>
<p>FIRST PRIEST: No more may be done.</p>
<p>We would mock the service of the dead To give her the same respect we
show To souls who parted in peace.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Lay her in the earth.</p>
<p>From her fair and pure flesh</p>
<p>May violets spring! I tell you, selfish priest, My sister will be an
angel</p>
<p>When you lie howling below.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What—it’s the fair Ophelia?</p>
<p>QUEEN (scattering flowers): Sweets to the sweet.</p>
<p>Farewell. I hoped that you would marry Hamlet.</p>
<p>I wanted to scatter flowers on Your bridal bed, sweet maid.</p>
<p>Instead, I put them on your grave.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Oh, may countless woes fall on The man who caused her
madness!</p>
<p>Don’t bury her until I have held her</p>
<p>Once more in my arms! (He leaps into the grave.)</p>
<p>Now pile your dust on both of us! HAMLET (advancing): Who is this</p>
<p>Who makes such a show of his grief?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Who is this who comes uninvited? HAMLET (leaping into the
grave): It is I, Hamlet</p>
<p>the Dane.</p>
<p>LAERTES (fighting with him): Her death Was all your fault, you
monster! HAMLET: You are wrong about that.</p>
<p>Take your fingers from my throat!</p>
<p>KING (to some attendants): Pull them apart!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Hamlet! Hamlet!</p>
<p>(Attendants part them. They come out of the grave.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, I will fight him about this Until the last moment of my
life!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, my son, about what?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I loved Ophelia! Not even 40,000 brothers, with all their
love,</p>
<p>Could love her as much.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, he is mad, Laertes!</p>
<p>QUEEN: For the sake of God, leave him alone!</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Laertes): Did you come to whine?</p>
<p>To show your love by leaping into her grave?</p>
<p>Be buried alive with her, and so will I.</p>
<p>If you’re going to rant and rave, I’ll rant as well as you!</p>
<p>QUEEN: This is madness.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Laertes, why do you accuse me?</p>
<p>I have always loved you like a brother.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You may do what you may.</p>
<p>The cat will mew, the dog will have his day. (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Good Horatio, look after him.</p>
<p>(Horatio exits.)</p>
<p>(to Laertes): Be patient. Think about our talk last night.</p>
<p>You’ll soon have another chance to fight. (All exit.)</p>
