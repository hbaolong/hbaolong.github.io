<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>About 500 years ago, Hamlet’s father, the king of Denmark, was
murdered by his own brother, Claudius. Then Claudius quickly married
Hamlet’s mother, Gertrude. As the play opens, Hamlet’s father’s ghost
appears and tells his son who murdered him. He urges Hamlet to seek
revenge. As the play unfolds, Hamlet tries to convince himself that he
should murder Claudius.</p>
<p>This is Shakespeare’s most famous play, known for the anguished
character of Hamlet.</p>

<h4 id="act-1">ACT 1</h4>
<p>(Francisco is at his post before the castle in Elsinore. Bernardo
enters.)</p>
<p>BERNARDO: The clock has struck 12.</p>
<p>I’ll take over the watch now, Francisco.</p>
<p>FRANCISCO: Thank you for relieving me.</p>
<p>It is bitter cold, and I am sick at heart.</p>
<p>BERNARDO: Has it been quiet tonight?</p>
<p>FRANCISCO: Not a mouse stirring.</p>
<p>BERNARDO: Well, good night. Tell my Partners on watch to hurry.</p>
<p>FRANCISCO: I think I hear them now.</p>
<p>(Horatio and Marcellus enter as Francisco exits.) MARCELLUS: Hello,
Bernardo!</p>
<p>BERNARDO: Welcome, Horatio and Marcellus. MARCELLUS: Has it appeared
again—the thing?</p>
<p>BERNARDO: I have seen nothing.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Horatio says it is only our fantasy. He will not believe
that we saw it twice! By standing watch with us tonight, he can See it
for himself.</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>HORATIO: It will not appear.</p>
<p>BERNARDO: Sit down awhile,</p>
<p>And let us once again tell you about</p>
<p>What we have seen two nights in a row.</p>
<p>Last night, about this same time,</p>
<p>The clock was striking one—</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Quiet! It’s coming again!</p>
<p>(The Ghost enters, dressed in armor.)</p>
<p>BERNARDO: It looks just like the dead King!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Speak to it, Horatio!</p>
<p>HORATIO (to the Ghost): Who are you?</p>
<p>Why do you wear the armor in which Our buried King did sometimes
march?</p>
<p>By heaven, I order you to speak! MARCELLUS: It seems to be
offended.</p>
<p>BERNARDO: See, it stalks away!</p>
<p>HORATIO: Stay! Speak! I order you, speak! (The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: It will not answer. It is gone.</p>
<p>BERNARDO: What do you think now, Horatio? You tremble and look
pale.</p>
<p>Isn’t this something more than fantasy? HORATIO: Before my God,</p>
<p>I would never have believed it</p>
<p>Unless I saw it with my own eyes.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Isn’t it like the King?</p>
<p>HORATIO: As like as you are to yourself!</p>
<p>That was the very armor he had on when He fought the ambitious King
of Norway. And he frowned just like that once,</p>
<p>When angry. It is strange.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to think.</p>
<p>But it seems like a bad sign.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Tell me, if you know,</p>
<p>Why this quiet and watchful ghost Has come here these past
nights.</p>
<p>And why does our country seem</p>
<p>To be preparing for war?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I’ll tell what I’ve heard.</p>
<p>Our last King, whose image just appeared, Killed King Fortinbras of
Norway.</p>
<p>Along with his life,</p>
<p>Fortinbras lost all the lands He had risked in the battle.</p>
<p>If Fortinbras had won, our good King Would have had to give up his
lands.</p>
<p>That was their agreement, so it was only fair. Now, sir, young
Fortinbras, his son,</p>
<p>Rash, hot, and foolish,</p>
<p>Has raised an army of lawless men</p>
<p>To recover the land lost by his father.</p>
<p>This must be why we are preparing for war,</p>
<p>And the reason we must keep watch at night. BERNARDO: I think you
must be right.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Quiet! Look! Here it comes again! (The Ghost enters
again.)</p>
<p>Stay, illusion! If you have any use of voice, Speak to me. If I may
help you in any way, Speak to me. If you know anything about</p>
<p>Your country’s fate, which,</p>
<p>By knowing in advance, we may avoid, Oh, speak!</p>
<p>(A rooster crows. The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>BERNARDO: It was about to speak,</p>
<p>When the rooster crowed.</p>
<p>HORATIO: I have heard that spirits</p>
<p>Must leave the earth during the day,</p>
<p>And what we just saw proves that story! The sun is rising. Our watch
is over.</p>
<p>Let us report what we have seen tonight To young Hamlet. I think
that</p>
<p>This spirit, silent to us, will speak to him. MARCELLUS: Let’s do it.
I know where he is.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(King Claudius, Queen Gertrude, Prince Hamlet,</p>
<p>Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords, and Attendants enter
a room of state in the castle at Elsinore.)</p>
<p>KING: The memory of our dear brother’s death Is still fresh. Our
hearts are full of grief. Yet, we must think of our kingdom,</p>
<p>Which needs a leader in this warlike time. Therefore we have taken as
wife</p>
<p>Our former sister-in-law.</p>
<p>Now, as you know, young Fortinbras</p>
<p>Thinks that we are weak. He thinks that Our late dear brother’s
death</p>
<p>Has left our state in confusion and chaos. Thinking he has an
advantage, he has been Pestering us to surrender those lands</p>
<p>Lost by his father to our brother.</p>
<p>That is the reason for this meeting.</p>
<p>We have written to the King of Norway, The uncle of young
Fortinbras.</p>
<p>He is sick and bedridden. He knows little Of his nephew’s actions. We
asked him To order his nephew to leave us alone.</p>
<p>We want you, Cornelius and Voltimand, To take this letter to the King
of Norway.</p>
<p>Now farewell—and do your duty quickly! (King Claudius hands them a
letter.)</p>
<p>CORNELIUS AND VOLTIMAND: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>(They bow and exit.)</p>
<p>KING: Now, Laertes, what’s the news with you?</p>
<p>You mentioned a request. What is it?</p>
<p>LAERTES: My good lord, I ask your permission</p>
<p>To return to France. I came here willingly To show my support for
your coronation. Now, I must confess, that duty done,</p>
<p>My wishes bend again toward France.</p>
<p>KING: Do you have your father’s permission? What does Polonius
say?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, he has my permission.</p>
<p>KING: Enjoy your youth, Laertes. Time is yours, And you may spend it
as you like!</p>
<p>But now, my nephew Hamlet, and my son— HAMLET (aside): I may be your
nephew,</p>
<p>But I will never be your son!</p>
<p>KING: Why are you still so gloomy?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Good Hamlet, cast off your dark mood. You know that all living
things must die, Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, madam, I know.</p>
<p>KING: It is sweet of you, Hamlet,</p>
<p>To mourn this way for your father.</p>
<p>But, your father lost a father.</p>
<p>And that lost father also lost his.</p>
<p>You must mourn for a time. But to keep on Mourning so long is
stubborn and unmanly. It shows a weak heart, an impatient mind. It is a
fault against heaven, against the dead, And against nature. Please stop
grieving. Think of us as a father. Let all see that</p>
<p>You are heir to the throne, and I love you No less than the dearest
father loves his son! Your wish to return to school in Wittenberg Goes
against our wishes. We ask you to stay Here in the cheer and comfort of
our eye, Our chief courtier, nephew, and our son.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Please, Hamlet, stay here with us.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I shall obey you, Mother.</p>
<p>KING: Why, it is a loving and fair reply.</p>
<p>(to the Queen): Madam, come.</p>
<p>(All exit but Hamlet.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, that this too, too solid flesh</p>
<p>Would melt, thaw, and turn into a dew! Or if only suicide were not a
sin!</p>
<p>Oh, God! Oh, God!</p>
<p>How weary, stale, flat, and useless</p>
<p>The world seems! It is an unweeded garden, Gone to seed. That it
should come to this! Not even two months dead, so fine a king! He loved
my mother so much that</p>
<p>He wouldn’t allow the wind to blow too hard On her face. She would
hang on him</p>
<p>As if her appetite grew by what it fed on. Yet, within a month—let me
not think of it! Frailty, your name is woman!</p>
<p>Oh, God! A beast with no power to reason Would have mourned longer!
Now,</p>
<p>Married to my uncle—my father’s brother— But no more like my
father</p>
<p>Than I am like Hercules. Within a month, Before the salt of her tears
had left her eyes, She married. Oh, most wicked speed!</p>
<p>This marriage can come to no good.</p>
<p>But break, my heart—I must hold my tongue!</p>
<p>(Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo enter.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Hail to your lordship!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Hello, Horatio! What brought you Here from Wittenberg?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I came to see your father’s funeral.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do not mock me, fellow student.</p>
<p>I think it was to see my mother’s wedding. HORATIO: Indeed, it
followed soon after.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Thrift, Horatio! The funeral meats Were served cold at the
marriage tables.</p>
<p>I wish I had never seen that day, Horatio! My father!—I think I see
my father.</p>
<p>HORATIO (surprised): Where, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: In my mind’s eye, Horatio.</p>
<p>HORATIO: I saw him once. He was a good king.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He was a man, all in all.</p>
<p>I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p>HORATIO: My lord, I think I saw him last night.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Saw who?</p>
<p>HORATIO: My lord . . . the king, your father.</p>
<p>HAMLET: My father? Let me hear!</p>
<p>HORATIO: Yes. Listen, I will tell you about it. For two nights,
Marcellus and Bernardo Saw a figure like your father,</p>
<p>Dressed from head to toe in armor.</p>
<p>They told me about it in secret.</p>
<p>I kept watch with them the third night. The ghostly figure came.</p>
<p>I knew your father. It looked just like him. HAMLET: Did you speak to
it?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I did, but it did not answer.</p>
<p>HAMLET: It is very strange.</p>
<p>HORATIO: As I live, my honored lord, it is true. We thought it our
duty to let you know of it.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Indeed, sirs—but it troubles me.</p>
<p>Are you on watch tonight?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS AND BERNARDO: We are, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He was dressed in armor, you say?</p>
<p>BOTH: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then you did not see his face?</p>
<p>HORATIO: We did. He wore the visor up.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Was he frowning?</p>
<p>HORATIO: His face was more sad than angry.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I wish I had been there!</p>
<p>I will watch with you tonight.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will walk again. If it looks like My noble father, I’ll
speak to it.</p>
<p>Do not tell anyone else about this.</p>
<p>I’ll see you tonight, between 11 and 12. ALL: Until then,
farewell.</p>
<p>(Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo exit.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: My father’s spirit—in arms! All is not well.</p>
<p>I wish night had already come! Until then, Be still, my soul. Foul
deeds will rise,</p>
<p>Though the earth hides them from our eyes.</p>
<p>(Hamlet exits.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-3">Scene 3</h4>
<p>(Laertes and Ophelia enter a room in Polonius’s house.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: My bags are on board. Farewell.</p>
<p>And, sister, please write to me.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Do you doubt that I would?</p>
<p>LAERTES: As for Hamlet, and his affections, Do not expect too
much.</p>
<p>They are like violets in the spring,</p>
<p>Fast-growing and sweet, but not lasting, The perfume of a minute. No
more.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: No more than that?</p>
<p>LAERTES: No. Perhaps he loves you now.</p>
<p>But be careful. Remember his position.</p>
<p>His will is not his own.</p>
<p>Unlike other people, he may not do as he wishes.</p>
<p>The safety and well-being</p>
<p>Of this whole state depend on his choices. Therefore, he must first
consider Denmark Before he can choose a wife.</p>
<p>If he says he loves you, keep all this in mind. If you lose your
heart or your honor,</p>
<p>You might also lose your good reputation. Fear it, Ophelia. Fear it,
my dear sister.</p>
<p>Be careful of the danger of desire.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: I shall take your words to heart.</p>
<p>But, my good brother, do not show me The steep and thorny way to
heaven</p>
<p>If you don’t take your own advice.</p>
<p>(Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Still here, Laertes? Aboard! Aboard! The wind sits in the
shoulder of your sail, And you are keeping everyone waiting.</p>
<p>(laying his hand on Laertes’s head): There!</p>
<p>My blessing on you! Here is some advice. Be friendly, but by no means
vulgar.</p>
<p>Keep those friends you have, and</p>
<p>Tie them to your soul with hoops of steel. But do not give the hand
of friendship</p>
<p>Too easily to every new person you meet. Give every man your ear, but
few your voice. Listen to criticism, but do not judge others. Buy
clothes as costly as you can afford— Good quality, but not gaudy—</p>
<p>For a man’s clothing tells a lot about him. Neither a borrower nor a
lender be,</p>
<p>For a loan can lose both itself and the friend, And borrowing dulls
the edge of thrift.</p>
<p>This above all: To your own self be true, And it must follow, as the
night the day, You cannot then be false to any man.</p>
<p>Farewell. My blessings go with you!</p>
<p>LAERTES: I humbly take my leave, my lord.</p>
<p>(to Ophelia): Farewell, Ophelia. Remember What I have said to
you.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: It is locked in my memory,</p>
<p>And you yourself shall keep the key to it.</p>
<p>(Laertes exits.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What did he say to you, Ophelia? OPHELIA: Something about
the Lord Hamlet.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: I thought so.</p>
<p>I’m told that you and Hamlet</p>
<p>Have been spending much time alone lately. If this is so, I must tell
you that you do not Understand what people might be saying. What is
between you? Tell me the truth.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: My lord, he has let me know That he feels affection toward
me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Affection? Ha! Are you fool enough To believe him?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: He has courted me honorably And has supported his words</p>
<p>With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Such vows are like traps for birds.</p>
<p>Do not take him seriously. From now on,</p>
<p>You must not be so available. In fact,</p>
<p>Do not spend any time alone with him.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to even talk to him.</p>
<p>That’s an order. Change your ways.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: I shall obey, my lord.</p>
<p>(Polonius and Ophelia exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-4">Scene 4</h4>
<p>(Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus enter an area before the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: The air seems to bite. It is very cold. What is the hour?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I think it is almost 12.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: No, it is past midnight.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Indeed? Then it is almost the time That the spirit has been
coming to walk.</p>
<p>(The Ghost enters.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Look, my lord, it comes!</p>
<p>HAMLET: May the angels defend us!</p>
<p>Whether you mean us evil or good,</p>
<p>I will speak to you. I’ll call you Hamlet, King, Father, Royal
Dane.</p>
<p>Oh, answer me! Tell why your holy bones Have burst their burial
clothes.</p>
<p>Why has your tomb opened its marble jaws To cast you up again? What
does this mean, That you rise up to visit in full armor?</p>
<p>Say, why is this? What should we do? (The Ghost motions to
Hamlet.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: It beckons you to draw nearer.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Do not go after it!</p>
<p>HORATIO: No, by no means.</p>
<p>HAMLET: It will not speak unless I follow it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Do not, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, what should I fear?</p>
<p>My life is not worth the price of a pin.</p>
<p>And for my soul, what can it do to that? It waves me forth again.
I’ll follow it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What if it leads you toward danger Or into madness?
Beware!</p>
<p>HAMLET: It waves to me still.</p>
<p>(to the Ghost): Go on. I’ll follow you.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS (holding him back): You shall not go, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Hold off your hands.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Listen to us. You shall not go.</p>
<p>HAMLET: My fate cries out,</p>
<p>And makes each vein in this body As brave as a lion.</p>
<p>(The Ghost beckons.)</p>
<p>Let go, gentlemen.</p>
<p>(breaking free): I’ll make a ghost of anyone Who tries to stop me! I
say, away!</p>
<p>(to the Ghost): Go on. I’ll follow you.</p>
<p>(The Ghost and Hamlet exit.)</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Let us go after him.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What good will that do?</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Heaven will take care of it!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: No, let’s follow him.</p>
<p>(Horatio and Marcellus exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-5">Scene 5</h4>
<p>(The Ghost and Hamlet enter a more remote part of the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Where will you lead me? Speak! I’ll go no further.</p>
<p>GHOST: Listen to me.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will.</p>
<p>GHOST: The hour is almost come, when I must Give myself up to the
tormenting flames.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Alas, poor ghost!</p>
<p>GHOST: Do not pity me, but listen To what I shall tell you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Speak! I am bound to hear.</p>
<p>GHOST: And when you hear, you will be Bound to revenge.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What?</p>
<p>GHOST: I am your father’s spirit—</p>
<p>Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined
to wasting fires Till the foul crimes done in my life</p>
<p>Are burned away. If I were not forbidden To tell the secrets of my
prison-house,</p>
<p>I could tell a tale whose lightest word</p>
<p>Would freeze your young blood. It would Make your eyes pop from their
sockets, and Your hair stand up like a porcupine’s quills. But this
eternal tale must not be heard</p>
<p>By ears of flesh and blood. Oh, listen!</p>
<p>If you did ever love your dear father— HAMLET: Oh, God!</p>
<p>GHOST: Avenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Murder!</p>
<p>GHOST: Murder most foul, as murder always is.</p>
<p>But this was most foul, strange, and unnatural.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Tell me what happened, so that I, With wings as swift as
thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.</p>
<p>GHOST: Hamlet, hear what I say.</p>
<p>The story is being told that a serpent</p>
<p>Stung me as I was sleeping in my orchard. All Denmark has been told
this lie.</p>
<p>But know, noble youth,</p>
<p>The serpent that did sting your father’s life Now wears his
crown.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, it’s just as I thought! My uncle!</p>
<p>GHOST: Yes, that beast.</p>
<p>First he won to his shameful lust</p>
<p>The will of my queen. Oh, Hamlet, What a fall that was for her!</p>
<p>From me, whose love was sacred and true, To that wretch who is so far
below me!</p>
<p>But quickly: I think I smell the morning air.</p>
<p>I will be brief. I was sleeping in my orchard, As was my custom in
the afternoon,</p>
<p>When your uncle stole in upon me</p>
<p>And poured poison in my ear.</p>
<p>The poison he used was swift as quicksilver. It coursed through my
whole body</p>
<p>And killed me almost in an instant.</p>
<p>Thus, as I was sleeping, I was killed</p>
<p>By my own brother’s hand. In one moment, I was deprived of life, of
crown, of queen. Cut off even before I could confess my sins.</p>
<p>I was sent to my maker</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible! Oh, horrible! Most horrible! If you have any feelings
in you, bear it not. Do not let the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for
luxury and evil incest. But</p>
<p>Whatever you do, do not harm your mother. Leave her to heaven and to
those thorns That lie in her heart to prick and sting her. Farewell at
once! It is almost morning.</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye! Hamlet, remember me! (The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Remember you!</p>
<p>Yes, you poor ghost! From my memory, I’ll wipe away all foolish
records,</p>
<p>All advice from books, all past pressures That youth and observation
put there.</p>
<p>Your commandment alone shall live Within my brain, unmixed with
lesser Matter. Oh, most evil woman!</p>
<p>Oh, villain, villain, smiling, evil villain!</p>
<p>One may smile, and smile, and be a villain.</p>
<p>At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark. So, Uncle, there you
are. Now to my promise: “Remember me.” I have sworn it.</p>
<p>HORATIO (from offstage): My lord, my lord!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS (from offstage): Lord Hamlet!</p>
<p>HORATIO (from offstage): Heaven help him! (Horatio and Marcellus
enter.)</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: What happened, my noble lord?</p>
<p>HORATIO: What news, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, wonderful!</p>
<p>HORATIO: My good lord, tell us.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, you will reveal it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Not I, my lord, by heaven!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then you’ll keep a secret?</p>
<p>HORATIO AND MARCELLUS: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: There’s a villain living in Denmark.</p>
<p>HORATIO: We don’t need a ghost, my lord,</p>
<p>Come from the grave to tell us this.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, you are right.</p>
<p>And so, let us shake hands and part.</p>
<p>You go about your business,</p>
<p>And I’ll go about mine. Now, good friends, As you are friends,
scholars, and soldiers, Grant me one poor request.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What is it, my lord? We will.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Never make known what you have Seen tonight.</p>
<p>HORATIO AND MARCELLUS: We will not.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Swear it, upon my sword.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: We have sworn, my lord, already. HAMLET: Indeed, upon my
sword, indeed.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath the stage): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come on!</p>
<p>You hear this fellow in the cellar? Swear. HORATIO: State the oath,
my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Never to speak of what you have seen, Swear by my sword.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come here, gentlemen,</p>
<p>And lay your hands again upon my sword. Never to speak of what you
have heard,</p>
<p>Swear by my sword.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Well said, old mole! Once more, good friends.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Oh, this is very strange!</p>
<p>HAMLET: And therefore, as a stranger, welcome it. There are more
things in heaven and earth,</p>
<p>Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</p>
<p>But come here, as before. Swear.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Rest, rest, troubled spirit!</p>
<p>(Horatio and Marcellus swear.) So, gentlemen,</p>
<p>With all my love I do thank you.</p>
<p>Let us go in together.</p>
<p>And, remember, not a word.</p>
<p>The time is out of joint. Oh, cursed spite! That ever I was born to
set it right!</p>
<p>Now, come, let’s go together.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="act-2">ACT 2</h4>
<p>(Polonius and Reynaldo enter a room in Polonius’s house.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Before you visit Laertes, find out What other people are
saying about him. You might start by saying something</p>
<p>Like this: “I know Laertes a little,</p>
<p>But not well. He seems to be very wild,</p>
<p>Addicted to such and such. ” And then you Could name whatever vices
you please, but None so bad as to dishonor him.</p>
<p>REYNALDO: Such as gambling, my lord?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Yes, or drinking and fighting, The common wildness of young
men.</p>
<p>Speak of his faults in such a way that They may seem very minor,</p>
<p>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind.</p>
<p>As you speak of my son’s slight faults,</p>
<p>The person you’re speaking to might say, “I know the gentleman. I saw
him yesterday, Or the other day, or then, or then,</p>
<p>With such, or such. And, as you say,</p>
<p>There he was gambling. ” Listen, now,</p>
<p>Your bait of falsehood takes this fish of truth.</p>
<p>I just want to know what he’s been doing.</p>
<p>Do you understand me? REYNALDO: I do, my lord.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Farewell now. Keep an eye on him. (Reynaldo exits. Ophelia
enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Ophelia! What’s the matter?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Oh, Father, I am so frightened!</p>
<p>POLONIUS: With what, in the name of God?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: As I was sewing in my room,</p>
<p>Lord Hamlet came in, his shirt unbuttoned. He wore no hat, and his
socks were dirty And falling down to his ankles.</p>
<p>He had a horrible look on his face.</p>
<p>He seemed out of his mind.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Mad for your love?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: My lord, I do not know.</p>
<p>But it seemed that way.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What did he say?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: He held me hard by the wrist.</p>
<p>Then he stared directly into my face,</p>
<p>As if he wanted to draw it. For a long time, He stayed like this. At
last, he shook my arm, Raised a pitiful sigh, and let me go.</p>
<p>Then, with his head turned over his shoulder,</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>He found his way out without using his eyes, For he left my room
without their help,</p>
<p>And, to the last, kept his eyes on me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Come with me to tell the king.</p>
<p>This kind of love is dangerous.</p>
<p>It can lead one to desperate deeds.</p>
<p>Have you given him any hard words lately? OPHELIA: No, my good
lord.</p>
<p>But, as you ordered, I’ve refused his letters And have spent no time
with him.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: That has driven him mad.</p>
<p>I am sorry that I misjudged him.</p>
<p>I thought he was toying with you and Meant to ruin you. Maybe I am
too</p>
<p>jealous!</p>
<p>Let us see the king. We must tell him.</p>
<p>If this is kept secret, it could lead To more grief than any of us
need.</p>
<p>(Ophelia and Polonius exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-2-1">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(The King, the Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and attendants enter
a room in the castle.)</p>
<p>KING: Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and</p>
<p>Guildenstern! We have missed you!</p>
<p>We asked you to come so quickly because</p>
<p>We need a favor from you. You have heard Something about the changes
in Hamlet. He is different both inside and out.</p>
<p>The reason—other than his father’s death— I cannot imagine.</p>
<p>You two are close to his age and have been Brought up with him since
childhood.</p>
<p>I ask you both to stay here in our court For a short time. Spend time
with him.</p>
<p>Maybe you can find out what is wrong.</p>
<p>If we knew, perhaps we could help him.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Gentlemen, he has talked about you.</p>
<p>I am sure there are no two men living</p>
<p>That he likes any better than you.</p>
<p>If it will please you to spend some time here, Your visit will be
royally rewarded.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No reward is necessary.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: We are happy to help.</p>
<p>KING: Thank you, Rosencrantz and Gentle Guildenstern.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Thank you, Guildenstern and</p>
<p>Gentle Rosencrantz. I beg you to visit My too-much-changed son at
once.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit. Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My good lord, the ambassadors From Norway have joyfully
returned.</p>
<p>KING: You have always brought good news!</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Have I, my lord? I assure you,</p>
<p>Majesty, that my duty is as sacred to me As my soul. And I think I
have found The very cause of Hamlet’s madness.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, speak of that. I long to hear it! POLONIUS: First, talk to
the ambassadors.</p>
<p>My news shall be dessert to that great feast. KING: Very well. Bring
them in.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits.)</p>
<p>(to the Queen): He tells me that he knows</p>
<p>Why Hamlet has been behaving so strangely.</p>
<p>QUEEN: I thought the reasons were clear—</p>
<p>His father’s death and our quick marriage.</p>
<p>KING: Well, let us hear what Polonius says.</p>
<p>(Polonius enters, with Voltimand and Cornelius.)</p>
<p>Welcome, my good friends! Say, Voltimand, What news do you have from
Norway?</p>
<p>VOLTIMAND: The King of Norway thought</p>
<p>That his nephew was preparing for war</p>
<p>With Poland. But as he looked into it,</p>
<p>He found it was truly against your highness. Then he ordered young
Fortinbras to stop. In brief, Fortinbras obeys and vows</p>
<p>Never to take arms against your majesty. At this, the overjoyed King
of Norway</p>
<p>Gave him enough money to take his soldiers Against Poland.</p>
<p>(Voltimand gives the king a paper.)</p>
<p>The King of Norway asks your permission For his nephew to march
through your lands On his way to Poland.</p>
<p>KING: When we have more time,</p>
<p>We’ll read, answer, and think about this. Meantime, we thank you for
your efforts. Rest now. Tonight, we’ll feast together.</p>
<p>(Voltimand and Cornelius exit.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: That was good news!</p>
<p>And now, since brevity is the soul of wit, I will be brief: Your
noble son is mad.</p>
<p>It is true that it is a pity,</p>
<p>And a pity it is that it is true.</p>
<p>But, to get to the point—</p>
<p>Let us agree that he is mad. Now we must Find out the cause of this
effect,</p>
<p>Or, rather, the cause of this defect.</p>
<p>My daughter has given me this.</p>
<p>(Polonius holds up a letter.)</p>
<p>Now, listen and think about it. (reading) “To the heavenly, and my
soul’s idol,</p>
<p>The most beautified Ophelia”— (He comments on the letter.)</p>
<p>That’s a stupid word, a vile word.</p>
<p>“Beautified” is a vile word. But listen.</p>
<p>(reading again): “Doubt that the stars are fire. Doubt that the sun
does move.</p>
<p>Doubt truth to be a liar.</p>
<p>But never doubt that I love.</p>
<p>Oh, Ophelia, I am not very good at this. But please believe that I
love you best.</p>
<p>Oh, most best, believe it. Farewell.</p>
<p>I am yours forever, dear lady. Hamlet. ”</p>
<p>(He folds up the letter.)</p>
<p>In obedience, my daughter showed me this.</p>
<p>KING: But how has she received his love?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Well, when I first found out about it,</p>
<p>I went right away and told my daughter,</p>
<p>“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of your reach.</p>
<p>This must not be. ” And then I told her</p>
<p>That she should lock herself away from him, Admit no messengers,
receive no gifts.</p>
<p>She took my advice. He fell into a sadness, Then into a fast, then
into a weakness,</p>
<p>Then into a lightness. In this way, he fell into The madness that all
of us now mourn.</p>
<p>KING: Do you think this is the reason?</p>
<p>QUEEN: It may be. It’s very likely.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Have I ever been wrong before?</p>
<p>KING: Not that I know.</p>
<p>How may we test your idea?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: You know sometimes he walks For hours at a time here in the
lobby.</p>
<p>QUEEN: So he does, indeed.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: At such a time, I’ll make sure that My daughter is
nearby.</p>
<p>You and I will hide behind the drapes and Watch their meeting. If he
does not love her, And has not gone mad because of it, then I’ll quit my
job and be a farmer!</p>
<p>KING: We will try it.</p>
<p>(Hamlet enters, reading a book.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: See how sadly he comes, reading.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Go away, I beg you, both of you.</p>
<p>I’ll speak to him presently. Please leave.</p>
<p>(The King, the Queen, and attendants exit.)</p>
<p>How are you, my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I am well, thanks to God.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes. You are a sly fishmonger.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Not I, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then I wish you were that honest.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Honest, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, sir. In this world, an honest man Is one in ten
thousand.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: That’s very true, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do you have a daughter?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: I have, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do not let her walk in the sun.</p>
<p>She could get hurt if she goes outside.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>(aside): Still talking about my daughter. Yet he did not know me at
first. He thought I sold fish. He is far gone. Truly, in my youth, I
suffered for love in much the</p>
<p>same way. I’ll speak to him again.</p>
<p>(to Hamlet): What do you read, my lord? HAMLET: Words, words,
words.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Between who?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: I mean, the matter that you read.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Lies, sir! The writer says here that old men have gray
beards, that their faces are wrinkled, and that their eyes are runny. He
also says they lack brains and have weak</p>
<p>legs. All of this, sir, I most strongly believe, yet I don’t think it
should be written down.</p>
<p>POLONIUS (aside): Though this be madness, yet there is a method in
it. (to Hamlet): My lord, I must most humbly take leave of you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Sir, you cannot take from me anything that I will more
willingly give—except my life, except my life, except my life . . .</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Farewell, my lord.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: These tiresome old fools!</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Good lads, what’s the news?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: None, my lord, but that the world’s grown honest.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then the end of time must be near! But your news is not true.
Let me ask you a question. What have you ever done to Fortune that she
sends you to prison here?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: Prison, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Denmark is a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Then the world is one.</p>
<p>HAMLET: A big one, with many rooms and dungeons, Denmark being the
worst.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: We do not think so, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, then, it is not a prison to you! For there is nothing
either good or bad unless you think it so. To me, it is a prison.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Then your ambition makes it one. Denmark is too narrow
for your mind.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, God, I could live in a nutshell, and count myself a king
of infinite space —except that I have bad dreams.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: Those dreams, indeed, are ambition, for ambition is
merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p>HAMLET: A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Truly. And I believe that ambition is so light and airy
that it is but a shadow’s shadow.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Shall we go to the court? For, truly,</p>
<p>I cannot think about this anymore.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN: We’ll wait upon you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, you won’t. I will not group you with the rest of my
servants. To tell the truth, I am most dreadfully waited upon. But, in
the familiar way of friendship,</p>
<p>what brings you here to Elsinore?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: To visit you. No other reason. HAMLET: Thank you. But,
really, dear friends,</p>
<p>were you not sent for? Come, tell me the</p>
<p>truth. Come, come. Speak to me!</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, anything—but answer the</p>
<p>question. You were sent for, weren’t you?</p>
<p>I know the king and queen sent for you.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: For what reason, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: You tell me. In the name of our</p>
<p>friendship, be truthful with me.</p>
<p>Were you sent for or not?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will tell you why, so you won’t have to break your secrecy
with the king and queen. I have lately—but I don’t know</p>
<p>why—lost all joy and stopped exercising. Indeed, I feel so bad that
the earth seems to me a sterile place. This most excellent air—why, it
seems no more to me than a foul collection of vapors. What a piece of
work is man! How noble in reason! How infinite in mind! In shape and
motion,</p>
<p>how admirable! In action, how like an angel! In understanding, how
like a god! The beauty of the world! The highest of animals! And yet to
me, what is this</p>
<p>piece of dust? Man does not delight me, no. Nor does woman, though by
your smiling you seem to say so.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: I had no such thoughts.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why did you laugh, then, when I said “Man does not delight
me”?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: I was thinking, my lord, if man does not delight you,
the actors who are coming will get a weak welcome.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Which actors are they?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: The ones you like so much—the tragedy-actors from the
city.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why are they traveling? In the city,</p>
<p>they seemed to be doing well, in reputation and profit. Are they
still as well-liked as</p>
<p>they were when I was there?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No, indeed, they are not.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why? Have they grown rusty?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: No, they are still good. But there is a new group of
child actors. They are very popular now. They are quite in fashion.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You say they are children? Who takes</p>
<p>care of them? How are they fed? Will they quit acting when their
voices change? Will they say later, when they grow into common actors,
that their writers do them wrong?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: There has been much talk about it. No one knows how the
argument will be resolved. Still, that is why the tragedy- actors are on
the road now.</p>
<p>(Trumpets from offstage announce the actors.) GUILDENSTERN: Here come
the players.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. But my uncle-father
and aunt-mother are deceived about me.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: In what way, my dear lord? HAMLET: I am but mad
north-northwest.</p>
<p>When the wind is from the south, I know a hawk from a handsaw!</p>
<p>(Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Greetings, gentlemen!</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern):</p>
<p>That great baby you see there is not yet out of his baby clothes.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ (aside to Hamlet): Perhaps the old</p>
<p>man is in his second childhood.</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside): I predict that he comes to tell me of the actors.
Listen.</p>
<p>(to Polonius): Greetings, sir.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, the actors are here.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Is that so?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Upon my honor.</p>
<p>(Four or five actors enter.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Welcome, gentlemen! Welcome, all! (to Polonius): My good
lord, will you see that the players have good rooms? Let them make
themselves comfortable.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: My lord, I will. Come, sirs.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Follow him, friends. We’ll hear a play tomorrow.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits, with all the actors but the first.</p>
<p>Hamlet speaks to the remaining actor.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Can you play “The Murder of Gonzago”?</p>
<p>FIRST ACTOR: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: We’ll have it tomorrow night. You</p>
<p>could, if I needed it, study a speech of some 12 or 16 lines, which
I’ll write and</p>
<p>add to the play, couldn’t you? FIRST ACTOR: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Very well. (pointing where Polonius has exited): Follow that
lord, and see that you do not mock him.</p>
<p>(First actor exits. Hamlet speaks to Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern.)</p>
<p>I’ll see you tonight. Welcome to Elsinore. ROSENCRANTZ: Thank you, my
good lord.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Now I am alone.</p>
<p>Oh, what a rogue I am! Am I a coward?</p>
<p>I must be, or I would have fed all the birds With the king’s
body—that bloody villain! Oh, revenge!</p>
<p>I, the son of a dear father murdered,</p>
<p>Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must unpack my heart with
words.</p>
<p>Well, I have heard that guilty creatures,</p>
<p>Sitting at a play, have been struck to the soul By a scene reminding
them of their own acts. Sometimes they are prompted to admit</p>
<p>Their evil actions. I’ll have these actors Play something like my
father’s murder Before my uncle. I’ll observe his looks.</p>
<p>If he reacts, I’ll know what to do.</p>
<p>The ghost I have seen may be the devil.</p>
<p>I know the devil can take a pleasing shape. Perhaps, due to my
weakness and sadness, He is leading me down an evil path.</p>
<p>I want to trust the ghost—but I can’t be sure That it was my father’s
spirit.</p>
<p>I need more proof. The play’s the thing In which I’ll catch the
conscience of the king.</p>
<p>(Hamlet exits.)</p>
<h4 id="act-3">ACT 3</h4>
<p>(The King, the Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and
Guildenstern enter a room in the castle.)</p>
<p>KING: Didn’t Hamlet tell you why he has been Acting so strange?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: He says that he feels distracted, But he will not speak
of the cause.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Was he interested in any pastime?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Madam, it so happened that We passed some actors on our
way here. We told him about this,</p>
<p>And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are at
the castle now, And I think they have already been ordered To play
before him tonight.</p>
<p>POLONIUS: It is true. He asked me to invite</p>
<p>Your Majesties to attend the play tonight.</p>
<p>KING: With all my heart, I am very happy</p>
<p>To hear that he is interested in something.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, tell him that we will be there. ROSENCRANTZ: We shall, my
lord.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit.)</p>
<p>KING: Sweet Gertrude, leave us, too.</p>
<p>We have sent for Hamlet so that he,</p>
<p>As if by accident, may meet Ophelia here. Her father and I—lawful
spies—</p>
<p>Will watch them</p>
<p>Without being seen. We wish to judge,</p>
<p>By the way he acts, if he is in love or not.</p>
<p>QUEEN: I shall obey you.</p>
<p>(to Ophelia): As for you, Ophelia, I do wish That your beauty is the
happy cause of</p>
<p>Hamlet’s wildness. I also hope your virtues Will bring him back to
himself again—</p>
<p>For the honor of you both.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Madam, I wish the same.</p>
<p>(The Queen exits.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Ophelia, walk over here.</p>
<p>Read from this book of prayers</p>
<p>So it won’t seem strange that you are alone.</p>
<p>(to the King): I hear him coming!</p>
<p>(The King and Polonius exit. Hamlet enters.) HAMLET: To be, or not to
be—</p>
<p>That is the question. Is it nobler in the mind To suffer the slings
and arrows</p>
<p>Of outrageous fortune? Or is it better To take arms against a sea of
troubles, And by fighting, end them?</p>
<p>To die is to sleep—no more than that.</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>By this sleep we say we end the heartaches</p>
<p>And the thousand natural shocks</p>
<p>That flesh must suffer. It is an end</p>
<p>Warmly to be wished. To die is to sleep.</p>
<p>To sleep . . . perhaps to dream.</p>
<p>Ay, there’s the rub. For in the sleep of death, What dreams may
come?</p>
<p>These thoughts must make us pause.</p>
<p>Why bear the whips and scorns of time? Why suffer the pangs of
unhappy love and The proud man’s insults,</p>
<p>When we might end them with a dagger? It is because we dread what
might happen After death, that undiscovered country</p>
<p>From which no traveler returns.</p>
<p>This dread puzzles the will.</p>
<p>It makes us prefer to bear those ills we have Rather than fly to
others we do not know. Thus conscience makes cowards of us all. (He sees
Ophelia.) The fair Ophelia!</p>
<p>In your prayers, remember my sins.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: My lord, I have gifts of yours that</p>
<p>I would like to return. Please take them.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, not I. I never gave you anything.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: You know right well you did.</p>
<p>And with them such sweet words that made The things richer. Their
perfume now lost, Take them back. For, to the noble mind,</p>
<p>Rich gifts turn poor when givers are unkind. HAMLET: I did love you
once.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: You made me believe so.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You should not have believed me. I loved you not!</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Then I was truly deceived.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Go to a nunnery! Why should you</p>
<p>become a mother of sinners? Why should such fellows as I be crawling
between</p>
<p>earth and heaven? We are all scoundrels, all of us. Believe none of
us. Go to a</p>
<p>nunnery! But if you do marry, I’ll give you this advice: If you are
as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, you will not escape</p>
<p>slander. Be off to a nunnery!</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Or, if you must marry, marry a fool. Wise men know well
enough how wicked you might be. I say, we will have no</p>
<p>more marriages. Those who are married already, all but one, shall
live. The rest</p>
<p>shall keep as they are. To a nunnery—go! (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<p>OPHELIA: What a noble mind has lost its reason! And I, the most
wretched of ladies.</p>
<p>I heard the sweet music of his loving words. Now that music is out of
tune and harsh.</p>
<p>Oh, woe is me, to have seen</p>
<p>What I have seen, to see what I see! (The King and Polonius
enter.)</p>
<p>KING: His thoughts are not of love!</p>
<p>The way he spoke—it was not like madness.</p>
<p>There’s something in his soul that sadness Sits on, like a hen on
eggs. When they hatch, There will be some danger. To prevent it, I have
a plan. Hamlet will go to England. The English king owes us some
money,</p>
<p>And Hamlet can collect it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the seas, and different countries, Will bring Hamlet back to
himself.</p>
<p>What do you think of this idea, Polonius?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: It should work. But I do believe</p>
<p>That his grief springs from neglected love. My lord, do as you
please.</p>
<p>But may I suggest this:</p>
<p>After the play, let his mother meet with him In private. Maybe she
can get him to talk. I’ll hide in the room so I can overhear them. If
she can’t uncover his grief, send him</p>
<p>To England—or lock him up wherever You think would be best.</p>
<p>KING: It shall be so: Madness in great ones Must not go
unwatched.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-2-2">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(Hamlet and certain actors enter a hall in the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Say the speech as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the
tongue. If you yell it, as many of your actors do, I’d just as soon have
the town-crier speak my lines. Do not saw the air too much with your
hands, but use gentle motions. It is much better to act with a
smoothness. Do not be too boring, either. Use your own</p>
<p>judgment. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action.
Remember that the purpose of acting is to hold the</p>
<p>mirror up to nature. In other words, show</p>
<p>things as they are. Now go and get ready. (Actors exit. Horatio
enters.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Greetings, Horatio!</p>
<p>HORATIO: Sweet lord, I am at your service.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Horatio, you are as sensible a man As I have ever known.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Oh, my dear lord—</p>
<p>HAMLET: I am not saying this to flatter you.</p>
<p>What advantage could I hope for from you? You have no wealth but your
good spirits to Feed and clothe you. Why should anyone Flatter the poor?
Since I could distinguish</p>
<p>Among men, I chose you as a friend.</p>
<p>Even though you have had some bad luck, You have never complained.
You take the Bad with the good, with equal thanks.</p>
<p>Blessed are those that can keep on going No matter how fate treats
them.</p>
<p>Give me the man who is not passion’s slave, And I will hold him in my
heart—</p>
<p>As I do you! But enough of this.</p>
<p>There is a play tonight before the king.</p>
<p>One scene in it is very close to</p>
<p>What I have told you of my father’s death. When you see that act on
stage,</p>
<p>Watch my uncle. If his hidden guilt</p>
<p>Does not make itself known at that point, I’ll be very surprised. I,
too, will keep</p>
<p>My eyes on his face. After the play, we will</p>
<p>Compare notes about what we have seen. HORATIO: Very well, my
lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I hear them coming to the play.</p>
<p>I must start my mad act again.</p>
<p>Find yourself a place to sit.</p>
<p>(Trumpets are heard offstage, announcing the king and queen. King,
Queen, Polonius, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others enter.)</p>
<p>KING: How are you this evening, Hamlet?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Excellent, to be sure. Like a chameleon, I eat the air, full
of promises.</p>
<p>You cannot feed chickens that way.</p>
<p>KING: You make no sense, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Nor to me, either. Are the actors ready?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Come here, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, good mother. Something more attractive pulls me.</p>
<p>POLONIUS (to the king): Did you hear that?</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Ophelia): Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</p>
<p>(He lies down at Ophelia’s feet.) OPHELIA (blushing): No, my
lord!</p>
<p>HAMLET: I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Well, yes, my lord. You are in a merry mood, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why shouldn’t I be? Look how cheerful my mother looks—and
my</p>
<p>father has been dead less than two hours.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: No, it’s been four months, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: So long? Oh, heavens! Dead two</p>
<p>months, and not forgotten yet? Then</p>
<p>there’s hope that a great man’s memory</p>
<p>may outlive his life by half a year!</p>
<p>(Trumpets are heard offstage. A mime show enters.</p>
<p>The actor king and queen very lovingly embrace. He</p>
<p>rests his head upon her shoulder, and she lays him</p>
<p>down on a bed of flowers. Then, seeing that he is</p>
<p>asleep, she leaves. A short time later, in comes</p>
<p>another man. He takes off the king’s crown, kisses it, pours poison
in the king’s ears, and exits. The queen returns, finds the king dead,
and mourns loudly. The poisoner comes in again, with three or four
others,</p>
<p>seeming to mourn with her. The dead body is carried away. The
poisoner woos the queen with gifts. For a while, she seems put off and
unwilling, but in the end she accepts his love. All the actors
exit.)</p>
<p>OPHELIA: What does this mean, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: It means mischief.</p>
<p>(The announcer enters.)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: For us, and for our play, We hope you like what it does
say, And now we’ll start, with no delay.</p>
<p>OPHELIA: That was brief, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: As brief as woman’s love.</p>
<p>(Actor King and Actor Queen enter.)</p>
<p>ACTOR KING: It has been thirty years Since love united us in
marriage.</p>
<p>ACTOR QUEEN: May it be thirty more Before our love is over!</p>
<p>But, woe is me, you are so sick lately.</p>
<p>As big as my love is, my fear is just as big. ACTOR KING: Yes, I must
leave you soon, love.</p>
<p>You shall live in this fair world after me. My honored and dear
wife,</p>
<p>I hope your next husband shall be as kind— ACTOR QUEEN: Oh, stop
talking like that!</p>
<p>If I take a second husband, let me be cursed!</p>
<p>For none wed the second</p>
<p>But those who killed the first.</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside): Bitter thoughts!</p>
<p>ACTOR QUEEN: The only reason</p>
<p>For a second marriage is money, not love. It would kill my husband a
second time, When the second husband kisses me.</p>
<p>ACTOR KING: I know you mean that now, But later you might break that
vow.</p>
<p>Nothing lasts forever, so it’s not strange That even our love might
someday change. You think you’d no second husband wed,</p>
<p>But that might change when the first is dead.</p>
<p>ACTOR QUEEN: Dear, I swear that this is true: The only one I’ll ever
love is you.</p>
<p>ACTOR KING: What a deep vow! Sweet, leave me now.</p>
<p>I must sleep. (He sleeps.)</p>
<p>ACTOR QUEEN: My dear, may sleep rest you, And may nothing come
between us two.</p>
<p>(Actor Queen exits.)</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Queen): How do you like it so far?</p>
<p>QUEEN: The lady protests too much, I think.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, but she’ll keep her word.</p>
<p>KING: Have you already seen this play?</p>
<p>Is there anything offensive in it?</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, no! They are just acting.</p>
<p>The poison is not real. There’s no offense in the world.</p>
<p>KING: What do you call the play?</p>
<p>HAMLET: “The Mousetrap.” It’s based on a</p>
<p>murder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the duke’s name. His wife is
Baptista. You shall see. It’s a play about evil, but what of it? Your
majesty and all of us with</p>
<p>clear consciences—it can’t touch us.</p>
<p>(First actor enters.)</p>
<p>FIRST ACTOR: Evil thoughts, busy hands, strong poison, and no
witnesses! It’s perfect!</p>
<p>(He pours poison into the Actor King’s ear.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: He poisons him in the garden for his money. The story is
written in excellent Italian. Later you shall see how the</p>
<p>murderer gets the love of Gonzago’s wife.</p>
<p>(The king gets up.)</p>
<p>OPHELIA: The king rises.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why? Did something frighten him?</p>
<p>QUEEN (to King): What’s wrong, my lord?</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Stop the play.</p>
<p>KING: Give me some light. Let’s go!</p>
<p>ALL: Lights, lights, lights!</p>
<p>(All exit but Hamlet and Horatio.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Horatio, did you watch him?</p>
<p>HORATIO: Very well, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: During the talk about the poisoning?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I watched him very closely.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Ah, ha!</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter.)</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: My lord, may I have a word? HAMLET: Sir, you may have a
whole story.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: The king, sir. He is very upset.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Too much to drink, sir?</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: No, my lord. He seems quite ill.</p>
<p>The queen, your mother, has sent me.</p>
<p>She wants me to tell you that she is amazed and astonished by your
behavior.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh wonderful son, who can so astonish</p>
<p>a mother! Did she say anything else?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: She wants to speak with you in</p>
<p>her room before you go to bed.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I shall obey. Now, leave me, friends.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Horatio exit.)</p>
<p>It is now the very witching time of night, When evil comes out into
the world.</p>
<p>Now I could drink hot blood and do</p>
<p>Such bitter business that the day would Shake to look at it. Now to
my mother— Oh, heart, do not lose your nature.</p>
<p>Let me be cruel to her, not unnatural.</p>
<p>I will speak daggers to her, but use none.</p>
<p>After all, she is my mother. I am her son. (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-3-1">Scene 3</h4>
<p>(The King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern enter a room in the
castle.)</p>
<p>KING: I don’t like him, and I don’t feel safe Around him when he is
mad. Therefore, Prepare to go to England with him.</p>
<p>GUILDENSTERN: Yes, your majesty.</p>
<p>It is our sacred duty to keep you safe, For so many people depend on
you.</p>
<p>KING: Get ready for this speedy voyage.</p>
<p>We will put chains around this fear Which now runs about so
freely.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern exit. Polonius enters.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: He’s going to his mother’s room.</p>
<p>Behind the drapes I’ll hide and listen.</p>
<p>I’m sure she’ll find out what’s wrong.</p>
<p>Before you go to bed I’ll call on you And tell you what I know.</p>
<p>KING: Thanks, my dear sir.</p>
<p>(Polonius exits.)</p>
<p>Oh, my crime is terrible! It smells to heaven! Like Cain in the Bible
story, I have</p>
<p>Murdered my own brother! I cannot pray, Though I want to so
badly.</p>
<p>My stronger guilt defeats my strong desire. Like a man with two
things to do,</p>
<p>I stand here, wondering where to begin</p>
<p>And neglect both. This cursed hand seems Thicker than itself with
brother’s blood.</p>
<p>Is there not rain enough in the heavens</p>
<p>To wash it white as snow? What prayer</p>
<p>Could I use? “Forgive me my foul murder”? That cannot be, since I
still have</p>
<p>All those things for which I did the murder:</p>
<p>My crown, my ambition, and my queen. May one be pardoned and keep the
goods? In this evil world, money buys justice.</p>
<p>It can often buy the law, too. But it is not so In heaven. No
trickery there. What then? What happens when one cannot repent? Oh,
wretched state! Oh, soul black as death!</p>
<p>Bow, stubborn knees! And, heart like steel, Be soft as a newborn
babe’s skin!</p>
<p>All may be well.</p>
<p>(The King kneels. Hamlet enters.)</p>
<p>HAMLET (aside): Now I could easily do it.</p>
<p>(He draws his sword.) But, no!</p>
<p>If I do it now, he goes to heaven.</p>
<p>A villain kills my father, and for that,</p>
<p>I, his only son, send the villain to heaven. Oh, this would be
foolish, not revenge!</p>
<p>He took my father by surprise,</p>
<p>With all his crimes on his head, lusty as May. How his record stands,
only heaven knows.</p>
<p>No. Up, sword, and be ready later, When he is drunk, in his rage,</p>
<p>Or in the evil pleasure of his bed.</p>
<p>Gambling, or swearing, or doing something That does not lead to
heaven. Then get him, So his heels may kick at heaven and his soul May
go to hell, where it belongs.</p>
<p>(Hamlet exits. The King rises.) KING: My words fly up,</p>
<p>But my thoughts remain below.</p>
<p>Words without thoughts never to heaven go. (The King exits.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-4-1">Scene 4</h4>
<p>(The Queen and Polonius enter her room.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: He is on his way. Now, be firm.</p>
<p>Tell him his pranks have been out of hand.</p>
<p>Say that you have spared him trouble until now. I’ll hide here
silently.</p>
<p>HAMLET (from offstage): Mother, Mother!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Hide! I hear him coming.</p>
<p>(Polonius hides behind the drapes. Hamlet enters.) HAMLET: Now,
Mother, what’s the matter?</p>
<p>QUEEN (referring to King Claudius): Hamlet, you have offended your
father.</p>
<p>HAMLET (referring to the dead King Hamlet):</p>
<p>Mother, you have offended my father.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Have you forgotten who I am?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Of course not. You are the queen,</p>
<p>Your husband’s brother’s wife, and—</p>
<p>I wish it were not so—you are my mother.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Don’t speak to me like that!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come, come, sit down. Do not move.</p>
<p>Sit here until I set up a mirror where you May see the innermost part
of yourself.</p>
<p>QUEEN: What will you do? Murder me? Help, help!</p>
<p>POLONIUS (from behind the drapes): Help!</p>
<p>HAMLET (drawing his sword): What’s that—a rat?</p>
<p>(He stabs through the drapes.)</p>
<p>POLONIUS: Oh, I am killed! (Polonius dies.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, my, what have you done?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I don’t know. Is it the king?</p>
<p>(Hamlet draws forth Polonius.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, what a rash and bloody deed!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Almost as bad, good Mother,</p>
<p>As killing a king and marrying his brother.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Killing a king?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, lady, that’s what I said.</p>
<p>(to Polonius): You wretched fool, farewell! I thought you were the
king. You found out That being too busy is dangerous.</p>
<p>(to the queen): Stop wringing your hands.</p>
<p>Sit down, and let me wring your heart.</p>
<p>For so I shall, unless it has become too hard.</p>
<p>QUEEN: What have I done, that you dare</p>
<p>Wag your tongue so rudely against me?</p>
<p>HAMLET: An act that takes the rose</p>
<p>From the fair forehead of an innocent love</p>
<p>And sets a blister there. An act that makes Marriage vows as false as
gamblers’ oaths.</p>
<p>All of heaven is sick from thinking about it. QUEEN: What act? What
do you mean?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Think about your husband, so good That he was almost like a
god.</p>
<p>Now look at your present husband.</p>
<p>Do you have eyes?</p>
<p>You cannot call it love, for at your age, The passion in the blood is
tame.</p>
<p>Who would go from my father to his own brother?</p>
<p>What devil fooled you into doing it? Oh, shame! Where is your
blush?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, Hamlet, speak no more.</p>
<p>You turn my eyes into my very soul.</p>
<p>There I see such black and grained spots That will never come
clean.</p>
<p>I beg you, say no more!</p>
<p>These words are like daggers in my ears. No more, sweet Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He is a murderer and a villain,</p>
<p>A wretch not worth a twentieth of a tenth Of your former husband. A
monster who Stole the crown and put it in his pocket!</p>
<p>QUEEN: No more!</p>
<p>HAMLET: A king of rags and patches!</p>
<p>(The Ghost enters, visible only to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>Save me and hover over me, you angels!</p>
<p>(to the Ghost): What is it, your grace? QUEEN: Oh, no, he’s mad!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Have you come to scold your son Who has not yet taken
revenge? Tell me!</p>
<p>GHOST: Do not forget. This visit Is meant to push you a little.</p>
<p>But, look at your mother. She suffers.</p>
<p>Step between her and her fighting soul. Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How is it with you, lady?</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, how is it with you?</p>
<p>You look at nothing and speak to the air?</p>
<p>What are you looking at?</p>
<p>HAMLET: At him, at him! See how pale he is!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Dear son, nothing is there.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Do you see nothing there?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Nothing at all.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Did you hear nothing?</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, look there! See how it steals away!</p>
<p>My father, dressed as when he was alive.</p>
<p>Look—he is going out the door now! (The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: You are seeing things that don’t exist. HAMLET: Mother,
confess your sins to heaven. Repent what’s past. Avoid what is to come.
QUEEN: Son, you have broken my heart in two.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then throw away the worse part</p>
<p>And live more purely with the other half.</p>
<p>Good night. But do not go to my uncle’s bed.</p>
<p>Pretend to be good, even if you are not. Stay away tonight, and
that</p>
<p>Will make it easier tomorrow night.</p>
<p>The next night, it will be even easier.</p>
<p>(pointing to Polonius): For this, I am sorry, But it has pleased
heaven</p>
<p>To punish me with this, and this with me.</p>
<p>I will answer for the death I gave him. So again, good night.</p>
<p>I must be cruel, only to be kind—</p>
<p>Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind. But one more thing, good
lady . . .</p>
<p>QUEEN: What is it?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I must go to England. Did you know? QUEEN: I had forgotten.
But, yes, you are right.</p>
<p>HAMLET: My two friends—whom I trust as I Trust poisonous snakes—will
go with me To deliver sealed letters from the king.</p>
<p>So be it. It’s fun to see the hangman hanged With his own noose. I
know the plan,</p>
<p>And they won’t be able to get the best of me. (pointing to Polonius):
I’ll drag the body out. Indeed, this adviser is now so still, so grave,
Who was in life a foolish old knave.</p>
<p>Good night, Mother.</p>
<p>(All exit, Hamlet dragging out Polonius.)</p>
<h4 id="act-4">ACT 4</h4>
<p>(The King enters a room in the castle, joining the Queen, who is
groaning.)</p>
<p>KING: These sighs must mean something.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, what I have seen tonight!</p>
<p>KING: What, Gertrude? How is Hamlet?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Mad as the wind in a storm.</p>
<p>He heard a noise from behind the drapes,</p>
<p>Cried out, “A rat,” and killed Polonius! KING: Oh, heavy deed!</p>
<p>It would have been my fate, if I’d been there. How will we explain
this bloody deed?</p>
<p>The people will blame us. Where is he? QUEEN: He has taken away the
body.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, Gertrude, we have to find him.</p>
<p>We’ll put him on a ship right away.</p>
<p>This vile deed must somehow be explained.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enter.)</p>
<p>Greetings, friends. We need some help.</p>
<p>In his madness, Hamlet has killed Polonius And dragged the body
away.</p>
<p>Go find him, and bring the body</p>
<p>Into the chapel. I beg you, hurry! (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
exit.)</p>
<p>Gertrude, we’ll talk to our wisest friends. We’ll let them know what
has happened And what we plan to do. Perhaps then they Won’t blame us
for it. Oh, come away! My soul is full of pain and dismay.</p>
<p>(King and Queen exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-2-3">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(Hamlet enters another room in the castle.) HAMLET: The body is
safely hidden.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN (from offstage): Hamlet! Lord
Hamlet!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Who’s calling me? Here they come. (Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern enter.)</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Sir, where is the body?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I’ve mixed it with the dust.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Tell us where it is, so we may take it to the
chapel.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why should I be spoken to like this</p>
<p>by a sponge like you?</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: You take me for a sponge?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, one that soaks up the king’s favor</p>
<p>and rewards. When he wants to find out what you know, all he has to
do is squeeze you. Then, sponge, you become dry again.</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: I do not understand you, lord. HAMLET: I am not
surprised. A good speech means</p>
<p>nothing to a foolish ear. Take me to the king. (All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-3-2">Scene 3</h4>
<p>(King, with attendants, enters another room.)</p>
<p>KING: I have sent them to look for Hamlet</p>
<p>And to find the body. Hamlet is dangerous! Yet we must not bring the
law upon him. He is loved by the people. To keep peace, His sudden
leaving must seem planned.</p>
<p>(Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Hamlet enter.) Now, Hamlet, where’s
Polonius?</p>
<p>HAMLET: At supper.</p>
<p>KING: At supper! Where?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Not where he eats,</p>
<p>But where the worms are eating him.</p>
<p>KING: Now, now. Tell us where Polonius is.</p>
<p>HAMLET: In heaven. Send for him there.</p>
<p>If your messenger doesn’t find him, Seek him in the other place
yourself.</p>
<p>But if you don’t find him this month,</p>
<p>You shall smell him as you go into the lobby. KING (to attendants):
Go seek him there.</p>
<p>HAMLET: He will stay there until you come.</p>
<p>(Attendants exit.)</p>
<p>KING: Hamlet, for your own safety, we must Send you away with fiery
quickness.</p>
<p>So get ready. The ship is waiting, and</p>
<p>The wind is high. You must go to England. HAMLET: Good. Farewell,
dear Mother.</p>
<p>KING: I am your loving father, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You are my mother.</p>
<p>Father and mother are man and wife.</p>
<p>Man and wife are one flesh.</p>
<p>And so, you are my mother.</p>
<p>Now, on to England! (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<p>KING (to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern): Follow him. Make him hurry.
Do not delay.</p>
<p>I want him out of here tonight. Away!</p>
<p>Everything is ready. Make haste! (All exit but the King.)</p>
<p>King of England, if you value my good will, You’ll do what I ask in
the letter. I want The immediate death of Hamlet.</p>
<p>He rages in my blood like a sickness,</p>
<p>And you must cure me! Until I know it’s done,</p>
<p>Whatever my luck, my joy will not be won. (King exits.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-4-2">Scene 4</h4>
<p>(Fortinbras enters, leading marching forces across a plain in
Denmark.)</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS (to Captain): Go and greet</p>
<p>The Danish king. Find out if he will Still allow us to march across
his land On our way to Poland.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>(All but the Captain exit. Hamlet, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern
enter.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Good sir, whose army is that?</p>
<p>Who commands it, and why is it here?</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: It is Norway’s army, sir,</p>
<p>Commanded by Fortinbras, the nephew Of the King of Norway. He is on
his way To fight against some part of Poland.</p>
<p>We go to gain a little patch of ground That is worth very little.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, then, the Polish king Won’t even defend it.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: On the contrary, sir.</p>
<p>The Polish army is already there.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What a waste! Thousands of men Will die for no reason. I
thank you, sir.</p>
<p>CAPTAIN: God be with you, sir.</p>
<p>(Captain exits.)</p>
<p>ROSENCRANTZ: Are you ready to go, my lord? HAMLET: I’ll be right with
you. Go on ahead. (All exit but Hamlet.)</p>
<p>How everything pushes me on to revenge! What is a man, if all he does
is eat and sleep? A beast, no more. Surely he who made us Able to think
and reason</p>
<p>Meant for us to use that ability.</p>
<p>Now, perhaps I think too much.</p>
<p>Maybe I am one part wisdom and Three parts coward. I do not know Why
I say “I must do this thing,”</p>
<p>Unless I have the cause, the will,</p>
<p>The strength, and the means to do it.</p>
<p>The examples of others urge me on.</p>
<p>Look at this army, led by a tender prince. They will risk their lives
for everything,</p>
<p>Even for an eggshell. At least Fortinbras Acts to avenge his father.
How about me, Then, with a father killed, a mother stained? To my shame,
I see the approaching death Of 20,000 men. They will fight for land Not
big enough for their graves.</p>
<p>Oh, from this time until the end,</p>
<p>May all my thoughts be for revenge! (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-5-1">Scene 5</h4>
<p>(The Queen and Horatio enter a room.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: What does Ophelia want?</p>
<p>HORATIO: She speaks of her father.</p>
<p>Her words don’t make any sense.</p>
<p>QUEEN: Let her come in.</p>
<p>(Horatio exits.)</p>
<p>To my sick soul, everything seems To suggest that danger is
ahead.</p>
<p>So full of crippling fear is guilt,</p>
<p>It spills itself in fearing to be spilt! (Horatio enters again, with
Ophelia.)</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Where is the beautiful queen?</p>
<p>QUEEN: How are you, Ophelia?</p>
<p>OPHELIA (singing): “He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and
gone.</p>
<p>At his head is green grass, At his feet, a stone. ”</p>
<p>QUEEN: But Ophelia— (The King enters.)</p>
<p>OPHELIA: Listen to this: (singing):</p>
<p>“His shroud is white as the mountain snow.</p>
<p>He lies among sweet white flowers, Watered by our tearful showers.
”</p>
<p>KING: How are you, pretty lady?</p>
<p>QUEEN: She’s obsessed with her father.</p>
<p>OPHELIA (singing): “Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day</p>
<p>All in the morning time,</p>
<p>And I a maid at your window, I’ll be your Valentine.</p>
<p>Then up he rose, put on his clothes, And opened the bedroom door.</p>
<p>Let in the maid, who stayed a while, And was a maiden nevermore.</p>
<p>She said, ’Before you asked me in,</p>
<p>You promised we would wed.’</p>
<p>He said, ‘It’s true, I would have done it, If you’d not come to my
bed.’”</p>
<p>KING: How long has she been this way?</p>
<p>OPHELIA: I hope all will be well, But I can’t help crying.</p>
<p>To think they would lay him In the cold, cold ground!</p>
<p>My brother shall hear of it.</p>
<p>And so I thank you for your good advice. Come, my coach! Good night,
sweet ladies. Good night, ladies. Good night, good night!</p>
<p>(Ophelia exits.)</p>
<p>KING (to Horatio): Follow her, will you? (Horatio exits.)</p>
<p>Oh, this poison of deep grief springs</p>
<p>From her father’s death. Oh, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they do not
come As single spies, but as armies!</p>
<p>First, her father is killed.</p>
<p>Next, your son is gone. The people are upset By talk of Polonius’s
death.</p>
<p>They think I had something to do with it.</p>
<p>Poor Ophelia! Divided from her own mind.</p>
<p>Laertes has secretly come back from France.</p>
<p>He has heard rumors about his father’s</p>
<p>death. (He hears a noise from offstage.)</p>
<p>What’s that? Where are my guards? (A gentleman enters.)</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN: Save yourself, my lord:</p>
<p>Young Laertes and his rebel force</p>
<p>Have swept aside your own soldiers.</p>
<p>The mob calls him “Lord.” They say,</p>
<p>“We have chosen! Laertes shall be king!” (Noise is heard from
offstage.)</p>
<p>KING: The doors are broken down!</p>
<p>(Laertes enters, followed by some Danes. The gentleman exits.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: Where is the king?</p>
<p>(to his followers): Guard the door.</p>
<p>DANES: We will, we will.</p>
<p>(The Danes exit.)</p>
<p>LAERTES (to the king): Oh, you vile king, Give me my father!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Calm down, good Laertes.</p>
<p>LAERTES: If one drop of my blood stays calm, It would betray my
father.</p>
<p>KING: Why are you so angry? Tell me!</p>
<p>LAERTES: Where is my father?</p>
<p>KING: Dead.</p>
<p>LAERTES: I will have revenge for my father’s death! KING: Good
Laertes, in getting your revenge,</p>
<p>Will you kill both friend and foe? LAERTES: None but his enemies.</p>
<p>KING: Do you wish to know who they are?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Of course.</p>
<p>KING: I had nothing to do with his death.</p>
<p>I am in grief for it.</p>
<p>DANES (from offstage): Let her come in.</p>
<p>LAERTES: What noise is that?</p>
<p>(Ophelia enters again, wearing straw and flowers on her clothing and
in her hair.)</p>
<p>Ophelia! Oh, heat, dry up my brains!</p>
<p>May salty tears burn out my eyes!</p>
<p>By heaven, your madness shall be avenged! Dear maid, kind sister,
sweet Ophelia!</p>
<p>Oh, heavens! Can a young maid’s wits Be as mortal as an old man’s
life?</p>
<p>OPHELIA (singing): “There, at his grave— Hey non nonny, hey
nonny—</p>
<p>Our tears we gave— ”</p>
<p>LAERTES: If you were still sane, you could not Speak better for
revenge.</p>
<p>OPHELIA (singing): “Will he come again?</p>
<p>No, no, he is dead,</p>
<p>Go to your death bed,</p>
<p>He never will come again.</p>
<p>His beard was as white as snow, He is gone, he is gone,</p>
<p>And all we can do is moan—</p>
<p>God have mercy on his soul!” (She exits.) KING: Laertes, I share your
grief.</p>
<p>Go now and find your wisest friends.</p>
<p>They shall listen to both of us and judge. If they find me guilty,
then you shall have My kingdom, my crown, my life—</p>
<p>And all else that I call mine. If not, Be patient, and we shall find
a way To make up for your loss.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Let this be so.</p>
<p>The way he died, his secret burial—</p>
<p>No noble rites or formal ceremony—</p>
<p>All these things cry out for explanation. KING: And you shall have
it.</p>
<p>Where the guilt is, let the great axe fall.</p>
<p>Now, go with me.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-6">Scene 6</h4>
<p>(Horatio enters another room with a servant.) HORATIO: Who wants to
speak with me?</p>
<p>SERVANT: Sailors, sir, with letters for you.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Let them come in.</p>
<p>(Servant exits. Sailors enter.)</p>
<p>FIRST SAILOR: Greetings, sir. This letter comes from the ambassador
who was on his way to England.</p>
<p>HORATIO (reading): “Dear Horatio,</p>
<p>When you have finished reading this,</p>
<p>arrange for these fellows to see the king. They have some letters for
him. Pirates boarded our ship two days after we set</p>
<p>sail. In the battle that followed, I</p>
<p>boarded their ship. As soon as they got clear of our ship, I alone
became their</p>
<p>prisoner. I have been treated well. They expect a favor from me in
return. Let the</p>
<p>king have the letters I have sent. Then</p>
<p>come to me as fast as you would run</p>
<p>away from death. I have something to tell you that will make you
speechless. I do</p>
<p>not want to put it in writing. These good fellows will bring you
where I am.</p>
<p>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are still on their way to England. I
have much to tell you about them. Yours, Hamlet. ”</p>
<p>(to sailors): Come with me to the king.</p>
<p>Then you can take me to Hamlet.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-7">Scene 7</h4>
<p>(The King and Laertes enter another room in the castle.)</p>
<p>KING: Now you know the whole story.</p>
<p>After Hamlet killed your father, He tried to kill me.</p>
<p>LAERTES: It appears to be true. But tell me why You did not punish
him for these crimes.</p>
<p>KING: For two special reasons. The queen, His mother, lives almost
for his looks.</p>
<p>And I love her too much to let her be hurt. Also, the common people
love him.</p>
<p>No matter what I said about him, They would never have believed
it.</p>
<p>Their anger would have turned on me.</p>
<p>LAERTES (bitterly): And so I have lost a noble father and</p>
<p>My sister has been driven to madness.</p>
<p>But my revenge will come!</p>
<p>KING: Do not lose sleep over it. Do not think That I am ready to
forget what happened. You shall soon hear more.</p>
<p>I loved your father, and I love myself.</p>
<p>I will have my revenge for Hamlet’s crimes! (A messenger enters.)</p>
<p>MESSENGER: Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.</p>
<p>This one is for you. This is for the queen. KING: From Hamlet! Who
brought them?</p>
<p>MESSENGER: Sailors, my lord.</p>
<p>(Messenger exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Laertes, you shall hear this.</p>
<p>(reading): “Your majesty, I am back in your kingdom. Tomorrow I would
like to see you and tell you the reasons for my sudden and strange
return. Hamlet.” What does this</p>
<p>mean? Have the others come back, too?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Is it Hamlet’s handwriting?</p>
<p>KING: Yes. What does it mean?</p>
<p>LAERTES: I have no idea, my lord.</p>
<p>But let him come.</p>
<p>It warms the sickness in my heart</p>
<p>That I shall have my revenge so soon.</p>
<p>KING: Will you take my advice, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Yes, my lord—as long as you</p>
<p>Do not advise me to let Hamlet live.</p>
<p>KING: I have a plan for his death.</p>
<p>Even his mother will call it an accident. LAERTES: My lord, I want a
hand in it!</p>
<p>KING: I have heard that you are good at fencing. They say you shine
at the sport. In fact, Hamlet is jealous of your reputation and Would
like nothing more than to beat you. Now let me ask you a question.</p>
<p>What would you most like to do to Hamlet</p>
<p>To show that you are your father’s son? LAERTES: To cut his throat in
the church!</p>
<p>KING: Revenge could take place anywhere.</p>
<p>But, good Laertes, here’s a better plan: Hamlet will be told that you
are here.</p>
<p>We’ll have some men praise your skill</p>
<p>At fencing and make bets on who would win In a duel—you or Hamlet.
He, unsuspecting, Will not check the tips of the swords.</p>
<p>It would be easy for you to choose a sword Whose tip was not covered
for safety.</p>
<p>Then, in one practice pass,</p>
<p>You can settle with him for your father.</p>
<p>LAERTES: I will do it!</p>
<p>And to make sure, I’ll put some poison</p>
<p>On the tip of my sword. I have it already. It is so strong that there
is no antidote.</p>
<p>KING: Let’s think some more about this.</p>
<p>If our plan fails, it would make us look bad. It would be better not
to try than to fail. That is why we should have a backup plan. Let me
see . . . Ah! I have it!</p>
<p>As you duel, you’ll both get thirsty.</p>
<p>When he calls for drink, I’ll have prepared A cup for him. If he by
chance escapes</p>
<p>The poison on your sword, He’ll get it from the cup.</p>
<p>(The Queen enters, greatly upset.)</p>
<p>QUEEN: One sorrow after another— Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Drowned! Oh, where?</p>
<p>QUEEN: There is a willow tree by the brook.</p>
<p>Its leaves reflect in the glassy stream.</p>
<p>While making flower chains there, she</p>
<p>Climbed up on an overhanging tree branch To hang her garlands from
it.</p>
<p>The branch broke off, and she fell into the Weeping brook. For a
while, her clothes</p>
<p>spread wide</p>
<p>And held her up like a mermaid.</p>
<p>But then, heavy with water, her clothes</p>
<p>Pulled the poor wretch to muddy death. LAERTES: Alas, then she is
drowned?</p>
<p>QUEEN: Drowned, drowned . . .</p>
<p>LAERTES: You’ve had too much water,</p>
<p>Poor Ophelia, so I’ll hold back my tears.</p>
<p>But I’m only human. I cannot. (He cries.) When these tears are gone,
that will be The last of the woman in me. (He exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Let us follow him, Gertrude.</p>
<p>It took all I had to calm his rage!</p>
<p>This sad news is sure to revive it.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us follow him.</p>
<p>(The King and Queen exit.)</p>
<h4 id="act-5">ACT 5</h4>
<p>(A gravedigger and his helper enter a churchyard.)</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Is she to have a Christian burial Even though she was a
suicide?</p>
<p>HELPER: That’s what I heard.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: How can that be?</p>
<p>Did she drown herself in self-defense? HELPER: The coroner said it
wasn’t suicide.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s getting the benefit of the doubt Because she was a
gentlewoman.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Who knows? And who cares? All I want is a drink. Why
don’t you go</p>
<p>And get us something at the tavern?</p>
<p>(Helper exits. Hamlet and Horatio enter, and stand at a</p>
<p>distance. They watch as the gravedigger digs and sings.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Has he no feeling for his work?</p>
<p>How can he sing while he digs a grave?</p>
<p>HORATIO: He is so used to digging graves That he doesn’t really think
about it.</p>
<p>HAMLET: You’re probably right.</p>
<p>Only those who don’t work very hard Have time for dainty
feelings.</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER (singing): “A pickaxe And a spade, a spade,</p>
<p>Dig a deep pit for the latest guest.</p>
<p>Bring a burial sheet for the lovely maid Who will soon be here for
her final rest. ”</p>
<p>(He hits a skull with his shovel and throws it up to the
surface.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: There’s a skull. Could it be The skull of a lawyer?</p>
<p>Where are his arguments now, his cases,</p>
<p>His evidence, and his tricks? Why does he let This rude man now knock
him about</p>
<p>With a dirty shovel? Shouldn’t he accuse The brute of assault? Hmmm.
This fellow Might have been a great buyer of land.</p>
<p>Is this how he ends up—</p>
<p>With his fine head full of fine dirt?</p>
<p>All his deeds and legal papers would</p>
<p>Just about fit in this box. Must the buyer</p>
<p>Himself have no more room than this? HORATIO: Not an inch more, my
lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will speak to this fellow.</p>
<p>(to the gravedigger): Whose grave is this? GRAVEDIGGER: Mine,
sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What man do you dig it for?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: For no man, sir.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What woman, then?</p>
<p>HAMLET</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: For no woman, either.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Who is to be buried in it?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: One who wds a woman, sir.</p>
<p>But, rest her soul, she’s dead.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How careful you are with words! How long have you been a
gravedigger?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: I began on the day that our</p>
<p>Last King Hamlet defeated old Fortinbras, Thirty years ago. It was
the very day</p>
<p>That young Hamlet was born— He that has been sent to England.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why was he sent to England?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Why, because he is mad.</p>
<p>He shall recover his wits there.</p>
<p>Or, if he does not, it won’t matter much. HAMLET: Why?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: No one in England will notice. There, all the men are as
mad as he.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Say, how long will a man lie in the earth before he rots?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: Eight or nine years. (He picks up a skull.) Here’s a
skull now. This skull has</p>
<p>been in the earth for twenty-three years. HAMLET: Whose was it?</p>
<p>GRAVEDIGGER: This, sir, was Yorick’s skull— the king’s jester.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Let me see. (He takes the skull.)</p>
<p>Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio. He was a fellow of infinite
fun.</p>
<p>He carried me on his back 1,000 times.</p>
<p>I hate to think of this!</p>
<p>Where are your jokes now, your tricks, Your songs, your flashes of
merriment? Not one is left to mock your grinning? Go to my lady’s room
right now.</p>
<p>Tell her that no matter how thick she puts On her makeup, she will
end up like this. Make her laugh at that.</p>
<p>Horatio, do you think Alexander the Great Looked like this in the
earth?</p>
<p>HORATIO: Just the same.</p>
<p>HAMLET: And smelled like this? Pah!</p>
<p>(He throws down the skull.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Just the same, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: To what lowly uses we may return,</p>
<p>Horatio! Even the noble dust of Alexander Might end up stopping up a
knot-hole.</p>
<p>HORATIO: You think too much, Hamlet.</p>
<p>HAMLET: But just consider it for a minute: Alexander died, Alexander
was buried,</p>
<p>Alexander returned to dust. The dust is earth.</p>
<p>From earth we get clay. That very clay</p>
<p>Might someday stop a hole in a beer-barrel. The imperial Caesar, dead
and turned to clay, Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. Oh, that he
who awed the world might</p>
<p>Patch a wall to keep the winter wind out! But, that’s enough for now.
Look!</p>
<p>Here comes the king.</p>
<p>(Priests enter, leading a procession. The King, the Queen, Laertes,
and mourners follow. Attendants carry a coffin.)</p>
<p>Who could be in the coffin?</p>
<p>The queen is here, but so few mourners! This suggests a suicide. It
must have been Someone of high rank. Let’s hide and watch.</p>
<p>(Hamlet and Horatio hide.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: What other ceremonies will there be?</p>
<p>FIRST PRIEST: We have already done all we can</p>
<p>For her funeral. Her death was doubtful.</p>
<p>She should be buried in unblessed ground, And pebbles thrown on
her.</p>
<p>Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,</p>
<p>With flowers and prayers and funeral bells. LAERTES (sadly): Can no
more be done?</p>
<p>FIRST PRIEST: No more may be done.</p>
<p>We would mock the service of the dead To give her the same respect we
show To souls who parted in peace.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Lay her in the earth.</p>
<p>From her fair and pure flesh</p>
<p>May violets spring! I tell you, selfish priest, My sister will be an
angel</p>
<p>When you lie howling below.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What—it’s the fair Ophelia?</p>
<p>QUEEN (scattering flowers): Sweets to the sweet.</p>
<p>Farewell. I hoped that you would marry Hamlet.</p>
<p>I wanted to scatter flowers on Your bridal bed, sweet maid.</p>
<p>Instead, I put them on your grave.</p>
<p>LAERTES: Oh, may countless woes fall on The man who caused her
madness!</p>
<p>Don’t bury her until I have held her</p>
<p>Once more in my arms! (He leaps into the grave.)</p>
<p>Now pile your dust on both of us! HAMLET (advancing): Who is this</p>
<p>Who makes such a show of his grief?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Who is this who comes uninvited? HAMLET (leaping into the
grave): It is I, Hamlet</p>
<p>the Dane.</p>
<p>LAERTES (fighting with him): Her death Was all your fault, you
monster! HAMLET: You are wrong about that.</p>
<p>Take your fingers from my throat!</p>
<p>KING (to some attendants): Pull them apart!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Hamlet! Hamlet!</p>
<p>(Attendants part them. They come out of the grave.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, I will fight him about this Until the last moment of my
life!</p>
<p>QUEEN: Oh, my son, about what?</p>
<p>HAMLET: I loved Ophelia! Not even 40,000 brothers, with all their
love,</p>
<p>Could love her as much.</p>
<p>KING: Oh, he is mad, Laertes!</p>
<p>QUEEN: For the sake of God, leave him alone!</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Laertes): Did you come to whine?</p>
<p>To show your love by leaping into her grave?</p>
<p>Be buried alive with her, and so will I.</p>
<p>If you’re going to rant and rave, I’ll rant as well as you!</p>
<p>QUEEN: This is madness.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Laertes, why do you accuse me?</p>
<p>I have always loved you like a brother.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>You may do what you may.</p>
<p>The cat will mew, the dog will have his day. (Hamlet exits.)</p>
<p>KING: Good Horatio, look after him.</p>
<p>(Horatio exits.)</p>
<p>(to Laertes): Be patient. Think about our talk last night.</p>
<p>You’ll soon have another chance to fight. (All exit.)</p>
<h4 id="scene-2-4">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(Hamlet and Horatio enter a hall in the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: In my letter, I mentioned that I</p>
<p>Wanted to tell you some things in person. We were on our way to
England—</p>
<p>Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and I.</p>
<p>In my heart there was a kind of fighting That kept me awake. On an
impulse—</p>
<p>And praise be to heaven for such impulses—</p>
<p>I got up from my bunk and left my cabin.</p>
<p>I wrapped my sailor’s coat around me</p>
<p>And groped around in the dark to find them.</p>
<p>I finally found them asleep, and I stole Their packet of letters. I
went back</p>
<p>To my own room again, my fears forgetting My manners. I opened their
letters.</p>
<p>There I found—oh, royal treachery!— A message from our king</p>
<p>To the King of England. It said that,</p>
<p>Upon opening the letter, without even Taking time to sharpen the axe,
the king Was to have my head cut off!</p>
<p>HORATIO (shocked): Is it possible?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Here’s the letter—read it yourself.</p>
<p>But do you want to know what I did next?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I beg you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I sat down and wrote a new letter.</p>
<p>In it, I mentioned how the King of England And the King of Denmark
have always been Good friends. In the name of the friendship, I said
that, without stopping to debate,</p>
<p>He should put the bearers of the letter</p>
<p>To sudden death. They were not to be given Any time to say their
prayers.</p>
<p>Naturally, I signed it with the name of my</p>
<p>Mother’s husband. I had my father’s Official sealing ring in my
bag.</p>
<p>It matches the present king’s seal.</p>
<p>I folded the letter like the other.</p>
<p>I sealed it with wax and placed it safely</p>
<p>Back where I had found the first one.</p>
<p>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern never</p>
<p>Knew about the change. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, when the
pirates attacked. What happened after that, you already know.</p>
<p>HORATIO: So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz Went to their deaths?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, man, they loved their work! They are not on my
conscience.</p>
<p>Their defeat was their own fault.</p>
<p>When lesser men come between the swords</p>
<p>Of the mighty, they take their own risks.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What kind of a king do we have?</p>
<p>HAMLET: He killed my father,</p>
<p>Disgraced my mother, and</p>
<p>Stood between me and the crown.</p>
<p>Then he tried to have me killed!</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be perfect if I could put an end To him with my own
hands?</p>
<p>HORATIO: He will soon learn what happened</p>
<p>When the King of England got your letter.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, but meanwhile, the time is mine.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to end a man’s life.</p>
<p>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>
<p>That I lost control of myself with Laertes. I’ll try to make it up to
him. But, still,</p>
<p>His grief made mine even greater.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Quiet! Someone’s coming.</p>
<p>(Osric enters.)</p>
<p>OSRIC: My lord, welcome back to Denmark.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I humbly thank you, sir.</p>
<p>OSRIC: Sir, his majesty asked me to tell you That he has placed a
large bet on your skill.</p>
<p>As you may already know, Laertes Is a highly skilled swordsman.</p>
<p>It is said that no one is better than he.</p>
<p>The king, sir, has bet six fine horses That you can beat Laertes in a
duel.</p>
<p>The exact bet is this: In 12 passes,</p>
<p>Laertes shall not hit you more than 3 times. Laertes, on the other
hand, has said that He will hit you 9 times out of 12.</p>
<p>The bet could be settled immediately</p>
<p>If your lordship would accept the challenge.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I am willing. I will win for the king If I can. If not, I
will gain nothing</p>
<p>But my shame and the odd hits.</p>
<p>OSRIC: My lord, I shall deliver your message. (Osric exits.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I do not think so. Since Laertes went to France, I have been
practicing. I shall win with those odds. Don’t think I’m not a</p>
<p>little nervous about it. But it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>HORATIO (worried): If you have any bad feelings</p>
<p>about this, I will say that you are ill.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Not at all. I don’t pay attention to</p>
<p>omens and bad feelings. There is a special plan in the death of a
sparrow. If death</p>
<p>comes now, it won’t come later. If it is not to come later, it will
come now. In any case, it will come sooner or later.</p>
<p>Being ready for it is all that matters.</p>
<p>(The King, the Queen, Laertes, lords, Osric, and attendants carrying
swords enter.)</p>
<p>KING: Hamlet, shake hands with Laertes.</p>
<p>(The king puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s.)</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Laertes): Give me your pardon, sir.</p>
<p>I have done you wrong. You must have heard That I am not myself
lately.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I offended you.</p>
<p>LAERTES: I accept your apology.</p>
<p>KING: Give them the swords, young Osric.</p>
<p>Hamlet, you know the wager?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Very well, my lord.</p>
<p>Your grace has bet on the weaker side.</p>
<p>KING: I do not think so. I have seen you both. I think you will give
Laertes a good fight.</p>
<p>LAERTES (seeing that he has not been given the poisoned sword): This
one is too heavy.</p>
<p>Let me see another.</p>
<p>HAMLET: This one is fine for me!</p>
<p>(They prepare to duel. Servants enter with cups of wine.) KING: Set
the cups of wine upon that table.</p>
<p>If Hamlet wins, I’ll drink to his health! (They begin. Hamlet scores
the first point.)</p>
<p>KING: I’ll drink to that! Your health, Hamlet. (He drinks some wine.
Then, as trumpets play, he</p>
<p>secretly puts the poison into another cup of wine and raises it,
offering it to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>Have a sip yourself.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I’ll play this bout first. Set it down</p>
<p>for a while. (to Laertes): Come on.</p>
<p>(They play, and Hamlet scores again.)</p>
<p>KING (to the queen): Our son shall win.</p>
<p>QUEEN: But he’s out of shape and short of</p>
<p>breath. (to Hamlet): Hamlet, take my</p>
<p>napkin, wipe your forehead. (picking up the poisoned cup that the
king has set aside for Hamlet): I’ll drink to your good luck,
Hamlet.</p>
<p>KING: Gertrude, do not drink!</p>
<p>QUEEN: I shall, my lord, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p>(She drinks and offers the cup to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>KING (aside): The poisoned cup! It is too late.</p>
<p>HAMLET (to the queen): Not yet, thanks. Later. (They continue their
swordplay. Fighting fiercely,</p>
<p>Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned sword. As they fight on, they
drop their swords during a scuffle. Each one accidentally picks up the
other’s sword. Then Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned sword—just
as the queen falls.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Both of them are bleeding!</p>
<p>(to Hamlet): How are you, my lord?</p>
<p>OSRIC (to Laertes): How are you, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Why, as a bird</p>
<p>Caught in my own trap, Osric.</p>
<p>I am justly killed by my own treachery.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How is the queen?</p>
<p>KING: She faints from seeing you bleed.</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, no! The drink, the drink!</p>
<p>Oh, my dear Hamlet! I am poisoned.</p>
<p>(The queen dies.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, villainy! Stop everything!</p>
<p>Let the door be locked! Find the traitor! (Laertes falls.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: The traitor is here, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Hamlet, you are killed.</p>
<p>No medicine in the world can do you good. In you there is not half an
hour of life.</p>
<p>The treacherous weapon is in your hand. The tip had no guard, and it
was poisoned. Both of us have been wounded by it.</p>
<p>Here I lie, never to rise again.</p>
<p>Your mother’s poisoned.</p>
<p>I can say no more.</p>
<p>The king—the king’s to blame.</p>
<p>HAMLET: The point is poisoned? Then, poison, do your work!</p>
<p>(Hamlet stabs the king.)</p>
<p>OSRIC AND LORDS: Treason! Treason!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Here, you villain! Finish this!</p>
<p>Follow my mother!</p>
<p>(Hamlet forces the king to drink. The king dies.) LAERTES: It is only
fair. It was all his idea.</p>
<p>Exchange forgiveness with me, Hamlet.</p>
<p>I forgive you for my death and my father’s.</p>
<p>Forgive me for yours. (Laertes dies.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: May heaven make you free of it!</p>
<p>I follow you. Unhappy queen, farewell!</p>
<p>I am dead, Horatio. You are alive.</p>
<p>Tell my story to those who don’t know it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Don’t believe that I shall live.</p>
<p>There’s still some wine left.</p>
<p>HAMLET: As you are a man, give me the cup. Let it go, by heaven, I’ll
have it.</p>
<p>(Hamlet takes the cup from Horatio.) Oh, good Horatio,</p>
<p>If you ever did hold me in your heart, Stay away from happiness for a
while, And in this harsh world</p>
<p>Draw your breath in pain to tell my story.</p>
<p>(Marching and the sound of shots are heard.) What warlike noise is
that?</p>
<p>OSRIC: Young Fortinbras has returned in victory from Poland. And
the</p>
<p>ambassadors from England have also come with news.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, I die, Horatio!</p>
<p>I cannot live to hear the news from England. But I predict that
Fortinbras will be the next King of Denmark. He has my dying vote. Tell
him— (He cannot finish the sentence.</p>
<p>The rest is silence. Hamlet dies.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: There ends a noble life.</p>
<p>Good night, sweet prince,</p>
<p>May flights of angels sing you to your rest!</p>
<p>(Fortinbras, ambassadors, and others enter.) FORTINBRAS: What is all
this?</p>
<p>HORATIO: What would you like to see?</p>
<p>If it’s sorrow or woe, cease your search.</p>
<p>FIRST AMBASSADOR: The sight is dismal.</p>
<p>Our news from England comes too late. The one who gave the order
cannot hear. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Now where will we
get our thanks?</p>
<p>HORATIO (pointing to the king): Not from His mouth, even if he could
speak.</p>
<p>He never gave the order for their deaths.</p>
<p>I will tell you how all this happened. FORTINBRAS: Let us hear it
without delay.</p>
<p>I have some rights to this kingdom, Which I shall now claim.</p>
<p>HORATIO: I shall also speak of that.</p>
<p>But for now, let us honor these dead.</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS: Let four captains</p>
<p>Carry Hamlet like a soldier. For his funeral, Let soldiers’ music and
the rites of war</p>
<p>Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies! A sight like this belongs
on a battlefield. Here it seems out of place.</p>
<p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p>(A salute of guns is fired. Drums beat. The bodies are carried out.
All exit.)</p>
<p>“This above all: to your own self be true, And it must follow, as
night the day,</p>
<p>You cannot then be false to any man.”</p>
<p>The ghost of the murdered king begs his son to get revenge. But young
Prince Hamlet is beset by doubts and unable to bring himself to action.
If he waits too long, however, he could well become the murderer’s next
target.</p>
