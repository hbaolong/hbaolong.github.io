<h4 id="scene-5">Scene 5</h4>
<p>(The Ghost and Hamlet enter a more remote part of the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Where will you lead me? Speak! I’ll go no further.</p>
<p>GHOST: Listen to me.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I will.</p>
<p>GHOST: The hour is almost come, when I must Give myself up to the
tormenting flames.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Alas, poor ghost!</p>
<p>GHOST: Do not pity me, but listen To what I shall tell you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Speak! I am bound to hear.</p>
<p>GHOST: And when you hear, you will be Bound to revenge.</p>
<p>HAMLET: What?</p>
<p>GHOST: I am your father’s spirit—</p>
<p>Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined
to wasting fires Till the foul crimes done in my life</p>
<p>Are burned away. If I were not forbidden To tell the secrets of my
prison-house,</p>
<p>I could tell a tale whose lightest word</p>
<p>Would freeze your young blood. It would Make your eyes pop from their
sockets, and Your hair stand up like a porcupine’s quills. But this
eternal tale must not be heard</p>
<p>By ears of flesh and blood. Oh, listen!</p>
<p>If you did ever love your dear father— HAMLET: Oh, God!</p>
<p>GHOST: Avenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Murder!</p>
<p>GHOST: Murder most foul, as murder always is.</p>
<p>But this was most foul, strange, and unnatural.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Tell me what happened, so that I, With wings as swift as
thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.</p>
<p>GHOST: Hamlet, hear what I say.</p>
<p>The story is being told that a serpent</p>
<p>Stung me as I was sleeping in my orchard. All Denmark has been told
this lie.</p>
<p>But know, noble youth,</p>
<p>The serpent that did sting your father’s life Now wears his
crown.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, it’s just as I thought! My uncle!</p>
<p>GHOST: Yes, that beast.</p>
<p>First he won to his shameful lust</p>
<p>The will of my queen. Oh, Hamlet, What a fall that was for her!</p>
<p>From me, whose love was sacred and true, To that wretch who is so far
below me!</p>
<p>But quickly: I think I smell the morning air.</p>
<p>I will be brief. I was sleeping in my orchard, As was my custom in
the afternoon,</p>
<p>When your uncle stole in upon me</p>
<p>And poured poison in my ear.</p>
<p>The poison he used was swift as quicksilver. It coursed through my
whole body</p>
<p>And killed me almost in an instant.</p>
<p>Thus, as I was sleeping, I was killed</p>
<p>By my own brother’s hand. In one moment, I was deprived of life, of
crown, of queen. Cut off even before I could confess my sins.</p>
<p>I was sent to my maker</p>
<p>With all my imperfections on my head.</p>
<p>Oh, horrible! Oh, horrible! Most horrible! If you have any feelings
in you, bear it not. Do not let the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for
luxury and evil incest. But</p>
<p>Whatever you do, do not harm your mother. Leave her to heaven and to
those thorns That lie in her heart to prick and sting her. Farewell at
once! It is almost morning.</p>
<p>Goodbye, goodbye! Hamlet, remember me! (The Ghost exits.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Remember you!</p>
<p>Yes, you poor ghost! From my memory, I’ll wipe away all foolish
records,</p>
<p>All advice from books, all past pressures That youth and observation
put there.</p>
<p>Your commandment alone shall live Within my brain, unmixed with
lesser Matter. Oh, most evil woman!</p>
<p>Oh, villain, villain, smiling, evil villain!</p>
<p>One may smile, and smile, and be a villain.</p>
<p>At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark. So, Uncle, there you
are. Now to my promise: “Remember me.” I have sworn it.</p>
<p>HORATIO (from offstage): My lord, my lord!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS (from offstage): Lord Hamlet!</p>
<p>HORATIO (from offstage): Heaven help him! (Horatio and Marcellus
enter.)</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: What happened, my noble lord?</p>
<p>HORATIO: What news, my lord?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, wonderful!</p>
<p>HORATIO: My good lord, tell us.</p>
<p>HAMLET: No, you will reveal it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Not I, my lord, by heaven!</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Then you’ll keep a secret?</p>
<p>HORATIO AND MARCELLUS: Yes, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: There’s a villain living in Denmark.</p>
<p>HORATIO: We don’t need a ghost, my lord,</p>
<p>Come from the grave to tell us this.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, you are right.</p>
<p>And so, let us shake hands and part.</p>
<p>You go about your business,</p>
<p>And I’ll go about mine. Now, good friends, As you are friends,
scholars, and soldiers, Grant me one poor request.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What is it, my lord? We will.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Never make known what you have Seen tonight.</p>
<p>HORATIO AND MARCELLUS: We will not.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Swear it, upon my sword.</p>
<p>MARCELLUS: We have sworn, my lord, already. HAMLET: Indeed, upon my
sword, indeed.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath the stage): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come on!</p>
<p>You hear this fellow in the cellar? Swear. HORATIO: State the oath,
my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Never to speak of what you have seen, Swear by my sword.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Come here, gentlemen,</p>
<p>And lay your hands again upon my sword. Never to speak of what you
have heard,</p>
<p>Swear by my sword.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Well said, old mole! Once more, good friends.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Oh, this is very strange!</p>
<p>HAMLET: And therefore, as a stranger, welcome it. There are more
things in heaven and earth,</p>
<p>Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.</p>
<p>But come here, as before. Swear.</p>
<p>GHOST (from beneath): Swear.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Rest, rest, troubled spirit!</p>
<p>(Horatio and Marcellus swear.) So, gentlemen,</p>
<p>With all my love I do thank you.</p>
<p>Let us go in together.</p>
<p>And, remember, not a word.</p>
<p>The time is out of joint. Oh, cursed spite! That ever I was born to
set it right!</p>
<p>Now, come, let’s go together.</p>
<p>(All exit.)</p>
