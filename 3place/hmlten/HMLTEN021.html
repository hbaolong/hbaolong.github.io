<h4 id="scene-2">Scene 2</h4>
<p>(Hamlet and Horatio enter a hall in the castle.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: In my letter, I mentioned that I</p>
<p>Wanted to tell you some things in person. We were on our way to
England—</p>
<p>Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and I.</p>
<p>In my heart there was a kind of fighting That kept me awake. On an
impulse—</p>
<p>And praise be to heaven for such impulses—</p>
<p>I got up from my bunk and left my cabin.</p>
<p>I wrapped my sailor’s coat around me</p>
<p>And groped around in the dark to find them.</p>
<p>I finally found them asleep, and I stole Their packet of letters. I
went back</p>
<p>To my own room again, my fears forgetting My manners. I opened their
letters.</p>
<p>There I found—oh, royal treachery!— A message from our king</p>
<p>To the King of England. It said that,</p>
<p>Upon opening the letter, without even Taking time to sharpen the axe,
the king Was to have my head cut off!</p>
<p>HORATIO (shocked): Is it possible?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Here’s the letter—read it yourself.</p>
<p>But do you want to know what I did next?</p>
<p>HORATIO: I beg you.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I sat down and wrote a new letter.</p>
<p>In it, I mentioned how the King of England And the King of Denmark
have always been Good friends. In the name of the friendship, I said
that, without stopping to debate,</p>
<p>He should put the bearers of the letter</p>
<p>To sudden death. They were not to be given Any time to say their
prayers.</p>
<p>Naturally, I signed it with the name of my</p>
<p>Mother’s husband. I had my father’s Official sealing ring in my
bag.</p>
<p>It matches the present king’s seal.</p>
<p>I folded the letter like the other.</p>
<p>I sealed it with wax and placed it safely</p>
<p>Back where I had found the first one.</p>
<p>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern never</p>
<p>Knew about the change. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight, when the
pirates attacked. What happened after that, you already know.</p>
<p>HORATIO: So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz Went to their deaths?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Why, man, they loved their work! They are not on my
conscience.</p>
<p>Their defeat was their own fault.</p>
<p>When lesser men come between the swords</p>
<p>Of the mighty, they take their own risks.</p>
<p>HORATIO: What kind of a king do we have?</p>
<p>HAMLET: He killed my father,</p>
<p>Disgraced my mother, and</p>
<p>Stood between me and the crown.</p>
<p>Then he tried to have me killed!</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be perfect if I could put an end To him with my own
hands?</p>
<p>HORATIO: He will soon learn what happened</p>
<p>When the King of England got your letter.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Yes, but meanwhile, the time is mine.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to end a man’s life.</p>
<p>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</p>
<p>That I lost control of myself with Laertes. I’ll try to make it up to
him. But, still,</p>
<p>His grief made mine even greater.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Quiet! Someone’s coming.</p>
<p>(Osric enters.)</p>
<p>OSRIC: My lord, welcome back to Denmark.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I humbly thank you, sir.</p>
<p>OSRIC: Sir, his majesty asked me to tell you That he has placed a
large bet on your skill.</p>
<p>As you may already know, Laertes Is a highly skilled swordsman.</p>
<p>It is said that no one is better than he.</p>
<p>The king, sir, has bet six fine horses That you can beat Laertes in a
duel.</p>
<p>The exact bet is this: In 12 passes,</p>
<p>Laertes shall not hit you more than 3 times. Laertes, on the other
hand, has said that He will hit you 9 times out of 12.</p>
<p>The bet could be settled immediately</p>
<p>If your lordship would accept the challenge.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I am willing. I will win for the king If I can. If not, I
will gain nothing</p>
<p>But my shame and the odd hits.</p>
<p>OSRIC: My lord, I shall deliver your message. (Osric exits.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I do not think so. Since Laertes went to France, I have been
practicing. I shall win with those odds. Don’t think I’m not a</p>
<p>little nervous about it. But it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>HORATIO (worried): If you have any bad feelings</p>
<p>about this, I will say that you are ill.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Not at all. I don’t pay attention to</p>
<p>omens and bad feelings. There is a special plan in the death of a
sparrow. If death</p>
<p>comes now, it won’t come later. If it is not to come later, it will
come now. In any case, it will come sooner or later.</p>
<p>Being ready for it is all that matters.</p>
<p>(The King, the Queen, Laertes, lords, Osric, and attendants carrying
swords enter.)</p>
<p>KING: Hamlet, shake hands with Laertes.</p>
<p>(The king puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s.)</p>
<p>HAMLET (to Laertes): Give me your pardon, sir.</p>
<p>I have done you wrong. You must have heard That I am not myself
lately.</p>
<p>Forgive me if I offended you.</p>
<p>LAERTES: I accept your apology.</p>
<p>KING: Give them the swords, young Osric.</p>
<p>Hamlet, you know the wager?</p>
<p>HAMLET: Very well, my lord.</p>
<p>Your grace has bet on the weaker side.</p>
<p>KING: I do not think so. I have seen you both. I think you will give
Laertes a good fight.</p>
<p>LAERTES (seeing that he has not been given the poisoned sword): This
one is too heavy.</p>
<p>Let me see another.</p>
<p>HAMLET: This one is fine for me!</p>
<p>(They prepare to duel. Servants enter with cups of wine.) KING: Set
the cups of wine upon that table.</p>
<p>If Hamlet wins, I’ll drink to his health! (They begin. Hamlet scores
the first point.)</p>
<p>KING: I’ll drink to that! Your health, Hamlet. (He drinks some wine.
Then, as trumpets play, he</p>
<p>secretly puts the poison into another cup of wine and raises it,
offering it to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>Have a sip yourself.</p>
<p>HAMLET: I’ll play this bout first. Set it down</p>
<p>for a while. (to Laertes): Come on.</p>
<p>(They play, and Hamlet scores again.)</p>
<p>KING (to the queen): Our son shall win.</p>
<p>QUEEN: But he’s out of shape and short of</p>
<p>breath. (to Hamlet): Hamlet, take my</p>
<p>napkin, wipe your forehead. (picking up the poisoned cup that the
king has set aside for Hamlet): I’ll drink to your good luck,
Hamlet.</p>
<p>KING: Gertrude, do not drink!</p>
<p>QUEEN: I shall, my lord, if you don’t mind.</p>
<p>(She drinks and offers the cup to Hamlet.)</p>
<p>KING (aside): The poisoned cup! It is too late.</p>
<p>HAMLET (to the queen): Not yet, thanks. Later. (They continue their
swordplay. Fighting fiercely,</p>
<p>Laertes wounds Hamlet with the poisoned sword. As they fight on, they
drop their swords during a scuffle. Each one accidentally picks up the
other’s sword. Then Hamlet wounds Laertes with the poisoned sword—just
as the queen falls.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: Both of them are bleeding!</p>
<p>(to Hamlet): How are you, my lord?</p>
<p>OSRIC (to Laertes): How are you, Laertes?</p>
<p>LAERTES: Why, as a bird</p>
<p>Caught in my own trap, Osric.</p>
<p>I am justly killed by my own treachery.</p>
<p>HAMLET: How is the queen?</p>
<p>KING: She faints from seeing you bleed.</p>
<p>QUEEN: No, no! The drink, the drink!</p>
<p>Oh, my dear Hamlet! I am poisoned.</p>
<p>(The queen dies.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, villainy! Stop everything!</p>
<p>Let the door be locked! Find the traitor! (Laertes falls.)</p>
<p>LAERTES: The traitor is here, Hamlet.</p>
<p>Hamlet, you are killed.</p>
<p>No medicine in the world can do you good. In you there is not half an
hour of life.</p>
<p>The treacherous weapon is in your hand. The tip had no guard, and it
was poisoned. Both of us have been wounded by it.</p>
<p>Here I lie, never to rise again.</p>
<p>Your mother’s poisoned.</p>
<p>I can say no more.</p>
<p>The king—the king’s to blame.</p>
<p>HAMLET: The point is poisoned? Then, poison, do your work!</p>
<p>(Hamlet stabs the king.)</p>
<p>OSRIC AND LORDS: Treason! Treason!</p>
<p>HAMLET: Here, you villain! Finish this!</p>
<p>Follow my mother!</p>
<p>(Hamlet forces the king to drink. The king dies.) LAERTES: It is only
fair. It was all his idea.</p>
<p>Exchange forgiveness with me, Hamlet.</p>
<p>I forgive you for my death and my father’s.</p>
<p>Forgive me for yours. (Laertes dies.)</p>
<p>HAMLET: May heaven make you free of it!</p>
<p>I follow you. Unhappy queen, farewell!</p>
<p>I am dead, Horatio. You are alive.</p>
<p>Tell my story to those who don’t know it.</p>
<p>HORATIO: Don’t believe that I shall live.</p>
<p>There’s still some wine left.</p>
<p>HAMLET: As you are a man, give me the cup. Let it go, by heaven, I’ll
have it.</p>
<p>(Hamlet takes the cup from Horatio.) Oh, good Horatio,</p>
<p>If you ever did hold me in your heart, Stay away from happiness for a
while, And in this harsh world</p>
<p>Draw your breath in pain to tell my story.</p>
<p>(Marching and the sound of shots are heard.) What warlike noise is
that?</p>
<p>OSRIC: Young Fortinbras has returned in victory from Poland. And
the</p>
<p>ambassadors from England have also come with news.</p>
<p>HAMLET: Oh, I die, Horatio!</p>
<p>I cannot live to hear the news from England. But I predict that
Fortinbras will be the next King of Denmark. He has my dying vote. Tell
him— (He cannot finish the sentence.</p>
<p>The rest is silence. Hamlet dies.)</p>
<p>HORATIO: There ends a noble life.</p>
<p>Good night, sweet prince,</p>
<p>May flights of angels sing you to your rest!</p>
<p>(Fortinbras, ambassadors, and others enter.) FORTINBRAS: What is all
this?</p>
<p>HORATIO: What would you like to see?</p>
<p>If it’s sorrow or woe, cease your search.</p>
<p>FIRST AMBASSADOR: The sight is dismal.</p>
<p>Our news from England comes too late. The one who gave the order
cannot hear. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Now where will we
get our thanks?</p>
<p>HORATIO (pointing to the king): Not from His mouth, even if he could
speak.</p>
<p>He never gave the order for their deaths.</p>
<p>I will tell you how all this happened. FORTINBRAS: Let us hear it
without delay.</p>
<p>I have some rights to this kingdom, Which I shall now claim.</p>
<p>HORATIO: I shall also speak of that.</p>
<p>But for now, let us honor these dead.</p>
<p>FORTINBRAS: Let four captains</p>
<p>Carry Hamlet like a soldier. For his funeral, Let soldiers’ music and
the rites of war</p>
<p>Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies! A sight like this belongs
on a battlefield. Here it seems out of place.</p>
<p>Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p>(A salute of guns is fired. Drums beat. The bodies are carried out.
All exit.)</p>
<p>“This above all: to your own self be true, And it must follow, as
night the day,</p>
<p>You cannot then be false to any man.”</p>
<p>The ghost of the murdered king begs his son to get revenge. But young
Prince Hamlet is beset by doubts and unable to bring himself to action.
If he waits too long, however, he could well become the murderer’s next
target.</p>
