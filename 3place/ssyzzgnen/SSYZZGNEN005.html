<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the
first. Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a
Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended
by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to
teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called the Dewey Decimal System was
school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had no chance to compare
it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around me: Atticus
and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everything—at least, what
one didn’t know the other did. Furthermore, I couldn’t help noticing
that my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected
each time without opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers
thought essential to the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated
on a half-Decimal half-Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively
alone or in a group, but Jem was a poor example: no tutorial system
devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books. As for me,
I knew nothing except what I gathered from Time magazine and reading
everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched sluggishly
along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not
help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something.
Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of
unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.</p>
<p>As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem,
who had to stay until three o’clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast
as I could, not stopping until I reached the safety of our front porch.
One afternoon as I raced by, something caught my eye and caught it in
such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, and went
back.</p>
<p>Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots
reached out into the side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of
the trees attracted my attention.</p>
<p>Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level,
winking at me in the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked
around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of
chewing gum minus their outer wrappers.</p>
<p>My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible,
but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I
examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all
right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed
it into my mouth: Wrigley’s Double-Mint.</p>
<p>When Jem came home he asked me where I got such a wad. I told him I
found it.</p>
<p>“Don’t eat things you find, Scout.”</p>
<p>“This wasn’t on the ground, it was in a tree.”</p>
<p>Jem growled.</p>
<p>“Well it was,” I said. “It was sticking in that tree yonder, the one
comin‘ from school.”</p>
<p>“Spit it out right now!”</p>
<p>I spat it out. The tang was fading, anyway. “I’ve been chewin‘ it all
afternoon and I ain’t dead yet, not even sick.”</p>
<p>Jem stamped his foot. “Don’t you know you’re not supposed to even
touch the trees over there? You’ll get killed if you do!”</p>
<p>“You touched the house once!”</p>
<p>“That was different! You go gargle—right now, you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Ain’t neither, it’ll take the taste outa my mouth.”</p>
<p>“You don’t ‘n’ I’ll tell Calpurnia on you!”</p>
<p>Rather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For
some reason, my first year of school had wrought a great change in our
relationship: Calpurnia’s tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my
business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval. On my
part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her.</p>
<p>Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer
was our best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots,
or trying to sleep in the treehouse; summer was everything good to eat;
it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape; but most of all, summer
was Dill.</p>
<p>The authorities released us early the last day of school, and Jem and
I walked home together. “Reckon old Dill’ll be coming home tomorrow,” I
said.</p>
<p>“Probably day after,” said Jem. “Mis’sippi turns ’em loose a day
later.”</p>
<p>As we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to
point for the hundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the
chewing gum, trying to make Jem believe I had found it there, and found
myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil.</p>
<p>“I see it, Scout! I see it—”</p>
<p>Jem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny
package. We ran home, and on the front porch we looked at a small box
patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewing-gum wrappers. It
was the kind of box wedding rings came in, purple velvet with a minute
catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch. Inside were two scrubbed and
polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem examined them.</p>
<p>“Indian-heads,” he said. “Nineteen-six and Scout, one of em’s
nineteen-hundred. These are real old.”</p>
<p>“Nineteen-hundred,” I echoed. “Say—”</p>
<p>“Hush a minute, I’m thinkin‘.”</p>
<p>“Jem, you reckon that’s somebody’s hidin‘ place?”</p>
<p>“Naw, don’t anybody much but us pass by there, unless it’s some grown
person’s—”</p>
<p>“Grown folks don’t have hidin‘ places. You reckon we ought to keep
’em, Jem?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what we could do, Scout. Who’d we give ‘em back to? I
know for a fact don’t anybody go by there—Cecil goes by the back street
an’ all the way around by town to get home.”</p>
<p>Cecil Jacobs, who lived at the far end of our street next door to the
post office, walked a total of one mile per school day to avoid the
Radley Place and old Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. Mrs. Dubose lived two
doors up the street from us; neighborhood opinion was unanimous that
Mrs. Dubose was the meanest old woman who ever lived. Jem wouldn’t go by
her place without Atticus beside him.</p>
<p>“What you reckon we oughta do, Jem?”</p>
<p>Finders were keepers unless title was proven. Plucking an occasional
camellia, getting a squirt of hot milk from Miss Maudie Atkinson’s cow
on a summer day, helping ourselves to someone’s scuppernongs was part of
our ethical culture, but money was different.</p>
<p>“Tell you what,” said Jem. “We’ll keep ‘em till school starts, then
go around and ask everybody if they’re theirs. They’re some bus child’s,
maybe—he was too taken up with gettin’ outa school today an‘ forgot ’em.
These are somebody’s, I know that. See how they’ve been slicked up?
They’ve been saved.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but why should somebody wanta put away chewing gum like that?
You know it doesn’t last.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Scout. But these are important to somebody…”</p>
<p>“How’s that, Jem…?”</p>
<p>“Well, Indian-heads—well, they come from the Indians. They’re real
strong magic, they make you have good luck. Not like fried chicken when
you’re not lookin‘ for it, but things like long life ’n‘ good health,
’n‘ passin’ six-weeks tests… these are real valuable to somebody. I’m
gonna put em in my trunk.”</p>
<p>Before Jem went to his room, he looked for a long time at the Radley
Place. He seemed to be thinking again.</p>
<p>Two days later Dill arrived in a blaze of glory: he had ridden the
train by himself from Meridian to Maycomb Junction (a courtesy
title—Maycomb Junction was in Abbott County) where he had been met by
Miss Rachel in Maycomb’s one taxi; he had eaten dinner in the diner, he
had seen two twins hitched together get off the train in Bay St. Louis
and stuck to his story regardless of threats. He had discarded the
abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real
short pants with a belt; he was somewhat heavier, no taller, and said he
had seen his father. Dill’s father was taller than ours, he had a black
beard (pointed), and was president of the L andandandand N Railroad.</p>
<p>“I helped the engineer for a while,” said Dill, yawning.</p>
<p>“In a pig’s ear you did, Dill. Hush,” said Jem. “What’ll we play
today?”</p>
<p>“Tom and Sam and Dick,” said Dill. “Let’s go in the front yard.” Dill
wanted the Rover Boys because there were three respectable parts. He was
clearly tired of being our character man.</p>
<p>“I’m tired of those,” I said. I was tired of playing Tom Rover, who
suddenly lost his memory in the middle of a picture show and was out of
the script until the end, when he was found in Alaska.</p>
<p>“Make us up one, Jem,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m tired of makin‘ ’em up.”</p>
<p>Our first days of freedom, and we were tired. I wondered what the
summer would bring.</p>
<p>We had strolled to the front yard, where Dill stood looking down the
street at the dreary face of the Radley Place. “I—smell—death,” he said.
“I do, I mean it,” he said, when I told him to shut up.</p>
<p>“You mean when somebody’s dyin‘ you can smell it?”</p>
<p>“No, I mean I can smell somebody an‘ tell if they’re gonna die. An
old lady taught me how.” Dill leaned over and sniffed me.
“Jean—Louise—Finch, you are going to die in three days.”</p>
<p>“Dill if you don’t hush I’ll knock you bowlegged. I mean it,
now—”</p>
<p>“Yawl hush,” growled Jem, “you act like you believe in Hot
Steams.”</p>
<p>“You act like you don’t,” I said.</p>
<p>“What’s a Hot Steam?” asked Dill.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you ever walked along a lonesome road at night and passed by
a hot place?” Jem asked Dill. “A Hot Steam’s somebody who can’t get to
heaven, just wallows around on lonesome roads an‘ if you walk through
him, when you die you’ll be one too, an’ you’ll go around at night
suckin‘ people’s breath—”</p>
<p>“How can you keep from passing through one?”</p>
<p>“You can’t,” said Jem. “Sometimes they stretch all the way across the
road, but if you hafta go through one you say, ‘Angel-bright,
life-in-death; get off the road, don’t suck my breath.’ That keeps ’em
from wrapping around you—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you believe a word he says, Dill,” I said. “Calpurnia says
that’s nigger-talk.”</p>
<p>Jem scowled darkly at me, but said, “Well, are we gonna play anything
or not?”</p>
<p>“Let’s roll in the tire,” I suggested.</p>
<p>Jem sighed. “You know I’m too big.”</p>
<p>“You c’n push.”</p>
<p>I ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the
house. I slapped it up to the front yard. “I’m first,” I said.</p>
<p>Dill said he ought to be first, he just got here.</p>
<p>Jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for Dill,
and I folded myself inside the tire.</p>
<p>Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my
contradicting him on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an
opportunity to reward me. He did, by pushing the tire down the sidewalk
with all the force in his body. Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad
palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating. I could not put out my
hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees. I could only
hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I would be stopped
by a bump in the sidewalk. I heard him behind me, chasing and
shouting.</p>
<p>The tire bumped on gravel, skeetered across the road, crashed into a
barrier and popped me like a cork onto pavement. Dizzy and nauseated, I
lay on the cement and shook my head still, pounded my ears to silence,
and heard Jem’s voice: “Scout, get away from there, come on!”</p>
<p>I raised my head and stared at the Radley Place steps in front of me.
I froze.</p>
<p>“Come on, Scout, don’t just lie there!” Jem was screaming. “Get up,
can’tcha?”</p>
<p>I got to my feet, trembling as I thawed.</p>
<p>“Get the tire!” Jem hollered. “Bring it with you! Ain’t you got any
sense at all?”</p>
<p>When I was able to navigate, I ran back to them as fast as my shaking
knees would carry me.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you bring it?” Jem yelled.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get it?” I screamed.</p>
<p>Jem was silent.</p>
<p>“Go on, it ain’t far inside the gate. Why, you even touched the house
once, remember?”</p>
<p>Jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk,
treaded water at the gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire.</p>
<p>“See there?” Jem was scowling triumphantly. “Nothin‘ to it. I swear,
Scout, sometimes you act so much like a girl it’s mortifyin’.”</p>
<p>There was more to it than he knew, but I decided not to tell him.</p>
<p>Calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, “Lemonade time! You
all get in outa that hot sun ’fore you fry alive!” Lemonade in the
middle of the morning was a summertime ritual. Calpurnia set a pitcher
and three glasses on the porch, then went about her business. Being out
of Jem’s good graces did not worry me especially. Lemonade would restore
his good humor.</p>
<p>Jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. “I know
what we are going to play,” he announced. “Something new, something
different.”</p>
<p>“What?” asked Dill.</p>
<p>“Boo Radley.”</p>
<p>Jem’s head at times was transparent: he had thought that up to make
me understand he wasn’t afraid of Radleys in any shape or form, to
contrast his own fearless heroism with my cowardice.</p>
<p>“Boo Radley? How?” asked Dill.</p>
<p>Jem said, “Scout, you can be Mrs. Radley—”</p>
<p>“I declare if I will. I don’t think—”</p>
<p>“’Smatter?” said Dill. “Still scared?”</p>
<p>“He can get out at night when we’re all asleep…” I said.</p>
<p>Jem hissed. “Scout, how’s he gonna know what we’re doin‘? Besides, I
don’t think he’s still there. He died years ago and they stuffed him up
the chimney.”</p>
<p>Dill said, “Jem, you and me can play and Scout can watch if she’s
scared.”</p>
<p>I was fairly sure Boo Radley was inside that house, but I couldn’t
prove it, and felt it best to keep my mouth shut or I would be accused
of believing in Hot Steams, phenomena I was immune to in the
daytime.</p>
<p>Jem parceled out our roles: I was Mrs. Radley, and all I had to do
was come out and sweep the porch. Dill was old Mr. Radley: he walked up
and down the sidewalk and coughed when Jem spoke to him. Jem, naturally,
was Boo: he went under the front steps and shrieked and howled from time
to time.</p>
<p>As the summer progressed, so did our game. We polished and perfected
it, added dialogue and plot until we had manufactured a small play upon
which we rang changes every day.</p>
<p>Dill was a villain’s villain: he could get into any character part
assigned him, and appear tall if height was part of the devilry
required. He was as good as his worst performance; his worst performance
was Gothic. I reluctantly played assorted ladies who entered the script.
I never thought it as much fun as Tarzan, and I played that summer with
more than vague anxiety despite Jem’s assurances that Boo Radley was
dead and nothing would get me, with him and Calpurnia there in the
daytime and Atticus home at night.</p>
<p>Jem was a born hero.</p>
<p>It was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of
gossip and neighborhood legend: Mrs. Radley had been beautiful until she
married Mr. Radley and lost all her money. She also lost most of her
teeth, her hair, and her right forefinger (Dill’s contribution. Boo bit
it off one night when he couldn’t find any cats and squirrels to eat.);
she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the time, while Boo slowly
whittled away all the furniture in the house.</p>
<p>The three of us were the boys who got into trouble; I was the probate
judge, for a change; Dill led Jem away and crammed him beneath the
steps, poking him with the brushbroom. Jem would reappear as needed in
the shapes of the sheriff, assorted townsfolk, and Miss Stephanie
Crawford, who had more to say about the Radleys than anybody in
Maycomb.</p>
<p>When it was time to play Boo’s big scene, Jem would sneak into the
house, steal the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when
Calpurnia’s back was turned, then sit in the swing and cut up
newspapers. Dill would walk by, cough at Jem, and Jem would fake a
plunge into Dill’s thigh. From where I stood it looked real.</p>
<p>When Mr. Nathan Radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would
stand still and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he
would do to us if he suspected. Our activities halted when any of the
neighbors appeared, and once I saw Miss Maudie Atkinson staring across
the street at us, her hedge clippers poised in midair.</p>
<p>One day we were so busily playing Chapter XXV, Book II of One Man’s
Family, we did not see Atticus standing on the sidewalk looking at us,
slapping a rolled magazine against his knee. The sun said twelve
noon.</p>
<p>“What are you all playing?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Jem.</p>
<p>Jem’s evasion told me our game was a secret, so I kept quiet.</p>
<p>“What are you doing with those scissors, then? Why are you tearing up
that newspaper? If it’s today’s I’ll tan you.”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>“Nothing what?” said Atticus.</p>
<p>“Nothing, sir.”</p>
<p>“Give me those scissors,” Atticus said. “They’re no things to play
with. Does this by any chance have anything to do with the Radleys?”</p>
<p>“No sir,” said Jem, reddening.</p>
<p>“I hope it doesn’t,” he said shortly, and went inside the house.</p>
<p>“Je-m…”</p>
<p>“Shut up! He’s gone in the livingroom, he can hear us in there.”</p>
<p>Safely in the yard, Dill asked Jem if we could play any more.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Atticus didn’t say we couldn’t—”</p>
<p>“Jem,” I said, “I think Atticus knows it anyway.”</p>
<p>“No he don’t. If he did he’d say he did.”</p>
<p>I was not so sure, but Jem told me I was being a girl, that girls
always imagined things, that’s why other people hated them so, and if I
started behaving like one I could just go off and find some to play
with.</p>
<p>“All right, you just keep it up then,” I said. “You’ll find out.”</p>
<p>Atticus’s arrival was the second reason I wanted to quit the game.
The first reason happened the day I rolled into the Radley front yard.
Through all the head-shaking, quelling of nausea and Jem-yelling, I had
heard another sound, so low I could not have heard it from the sidewalk.
Someone inside the house was laughing.</p>
