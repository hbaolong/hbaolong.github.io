<h4 id="chapter-30">Chapter 30</h4>
<p>“Mr. Arthur, honey,” said Atticus, gently correcting me. “Jean
Louise, this is Mr. Arthur Radley. I believe he already knows you.”</p>
<p>If Atticus could blandly introduce me to Boo Radley at a time like
this, well—that was Atticus.</p>
<p>Boo saw me run instinctively to the bed where Jem was sleeping, for
the same shy smile crept across his face. Hot with embarrassment, I
tried to cover up by covering Jem up.</p>
<p>“Ah-ah, don’t touch him,” Atticus said.</p>
<p>Mr. Heck Tate sat looking intently at Boo through his horn-rimmed
glasses. He was about to speak when Dr. Reynolds came down the hall.</p>
<p>“Everybody out,” he said, as he came in the door. “Evenin‘, Arthur,
didn’t notice you the first time I was here.”</p>
<p>Dr. Reynolds’s voice was as breezy as his step, as though he had said
it every evening of his life, an announcement that astounded me even
more than being in the same room with Boo Radley. Of course… even Boo
Radley got sick sometimes, I thought. But on the other hand I wasn’t
sure.</p>
<p>Dr. Reynolds was carrying a big package wrapped in newspaper. He put
it down on Jem’s desk and took off his coat. “You’re quite satisfied
he’s alive, now? Tell you how I knew. When I tried to examine him he
kicked me. Had to put him out good and proper to touch him. So scat,” he
said to me.</p>
<p>“Er—” said Atticus, glancing at Boo. “Heck, let’s go out on the front
porch. There are plenty of chairs out there, and it’s still warm
enough.”</p>
<p>I wondered why Atticus was inviting us to the front porch instead of
the livingroom, then I understood. The livingroom lights were awfully
strong.</p>
<p>We filed out, first Mr. Tate—Atticus was waiting at the door for him
to go ahead of him. Then he changed his mind and followed Mr. Tate.</p>
<p>People have a habit of doing everyday things even under the oddest
conditions. I was no exception: “Come along, Mr. Arthur,” I heard myself
saying, “you don’t know the house real well. I’ll just take you to the
porch, sir.”</p>
<p>He looked down at me and nodded.</p>
<p>I led him through the hall and past the livingroom.</p>
<p>“Won’t you have a seat, Mr. Arthur? This rocking-chair’s nice and
comfortable.”</p>
<p>My small fantasy about him was alive again: he would be sitting on
the porch… right pretty spell we’re having, isn’t it, Mr. Arthur?</p>
<p>Yes, a right pretty spell. Feeling slightly unreal, I led him to the
chair farthest from Atticus and Mr. Tate. It was in deep shadow. Boo
would feel more comfortable in the dark.</p>
<p>Atticus was sitting in the swing, and Mr. Tate was in a chair next to
him. The light from the livingroom windows was strong on them. I sat
beside Boo.</p>
<p>“Well, Heck,” Atticus was saying, “I guess the thing to do—good Lord,
I’m losing my memory…” Atticus pushed up his glasses and pressed his
fingers to his eyes. “Jem’s not quite thirteen… no, he’s already
thirteen—I can’t remember. Anyway, it’ll come before county court—”</p>
<p>“What will, Mr. Finch?” Mr. Tate uncrossed his legs and leaned
forward.</p>
<p>“Of course it was clear-cut self defense, but I’ll have to go to the
office and hunt up—”</p>
<p>“Mr. Finch, do you think Jem killed Bob Ewell? Do you think
that?”</p>
<p>“You heard what Scout said, there’s no doubt about it. She said Jem
got up and yanked him off her—he probably got hold of Ewell’s knife
somehow in the dark… we’ll find out tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Mis-ter Finch, hold on,” said Mr. Tate. “Jem never stabbed Bob
Ewell.”</p>
<p>Atticus was silent for a moment. He looked at Mr. Tate as if he
appreciated what he said. But Atticus shook his head.</p>
<p>“Heck, it’s mighty kind of you and I know you’re doing it from that
good heart of yours, but don’t start anything like that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate got up and went to the edge of the porch. He spat into the
shrubbery, then thrust his hands into his hip pockets and faced Atticus.
“Like what?” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if I spoke sharply, Heck,” Atticus said simply, “but
nobody’s hushing this up. I don’t live that way.”</p>
<p>“Nobody’s gonna hush anything up, Mr. Finch.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate’s voice was quiet, but his boots were planted so solidly on
the porch floorboards it seemed that they grew there. A curious contest,
the nature of which eluded me, was developing between my father and the
sheriff.</p>
<p>It was Atticus’s turn to get up and go to the edge of the porch. He
said, “H’rm,” and spat dryly into the yard. He put his hands in his
pockets and faced Mr. Tate.</p>
<p>“Heck, you haven’t said it, but I know what you’re thinking. Thank
you for it. Jean Louise—” he turned to me. “You said Jem yanked
Mr. Ewell off you?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, that’s what I thought… I—”</p>
<p>“See there, Heck? Thank you from the bottom of my heart, but I don’t
want my boy starting out with something like this over his head. Best
way to clear the air is to have it all out in the open. Let the county
come and bring sandwiches. I don’t want him growing up with a whisper
about him, I don’t want anybody saying, ‘Jem Finch… his daddy paid a
mint to get him out of that.’ Sooner we get this over with the
better.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Finch,” Mr. Tate said stolidly, “Bob Ewell fell on his knife. He
killed himself.”</p>
<p>Atticus walked to the corner of the porch. He looked at the wisteria
vine. In his own way, I thought, each was as stubborn as the other. I
wondered who would give in first. Atticus’s stubbornness was quiet and
rarely evident, but in some ways he was as set as the Cunninghams.
Mr. Tate’s was unschooled and blunt, but it was equal to my
father’s.</p>
<p>“Heck,” Atticus’s back was turned. “If this thing’s hushed up it’ll
be a simple denial to Jem of the way I’ve tried to raise him. Sometimes
I think I’m a total failure as a parent, but I’m all they’ve got. Before
Jem looks at anyone else he looks at me, and I’ve tried to live so I can
look squarely back at him… if I connived at something like this, frankly
I couldn’t meet his eye, and the day I can’t do that I’ll know I’ve lost
him. I don’t want to lose him and Scout, because they’re all I’ve
got.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Finch.” Mr. Tate was still planted to the floorboards. “Bob
Ewell fell on his knife. I can prove it.”</p>
<p>Atticus wheeled around. His hands dug into his pockets. “Heck, can’t
you even try to see it my way? You’ve got children of your own, but I’m
older than you. When mine are grown I’ll be an old man if I’m still
around, but right now I’m—if they don’t trust me they won’t trust
anybody. Jem and Scout know what happened. If they hear of me saying
downtown something different happened—Heck, I won’t have them any more.
I can’t live one way in town and another way in my home.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate rocked on his heels and said patiently, “He’d flung Jem
down, he stumbled over a root under that tree and—look, I can show
you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate reached in his side pocket and withdrew a long switchblade
knife. As he did so, Dr. Reynolds came to the door. “The son—deceased’s
under that tree, doctor, just inside the schoolyard. Got a flashlight?
Better have this one.”</p>
<p>“I can ease around and turn my car lights on,” said Dr. Reynolds, but
he took Mr. Tate’s flashlight. “Jem’s all right. He won’t wake up
tonight, I hope, so don’t worry. That the knife that killed him,
Heck?”</p>
<p>“No sir, still in him. Looked like a kitchen knife from the handle.
Ken oughta be there with the hearse by now, doctor, ’night.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate flicked open the knife. “It was like this,” he said. He held
the knife and pretended to stumble; as he leaned forward his left arm
went down in front of him. “See there? Stabbed himself through that soft
stuff between his ribs. His whole weight drove it in.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate closed the knife and jammed it back in his pocket. “Scout is
eight years old,” he said. “She was too scared to know exactly what went
on.”</p>
<p>“You’d be surprised,” Atticus said grimly.</p>
<p>“I’m not sayin‘ she made it up, I’m sayin’ she was too scared to know
exactly what happened. It was mighty dark out there, black as ink. ’d
take somebody mighty used to the dark to make a competent witness…”</p>
<p>“I won’t have it,” Atticus said softly.</p>
<p>“God damn it, I’m not thinking of Jem!”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate’s boot hit the floorboards so hard the lights in Miss
Maudie’s bedroom went on. Miss Stephanie Crawford’s lights went on.
Atticus and Mr. Tate looked across the street, then at each other. They
waited.</p>
<p>When Mr. Tate spoke again his voice was barely audible. “Mr. Finch, I
hate to fight you when you’re like this. You’ve been under a strain
tonight no man should ever have to go through. Why you ain’t in the bed
from it I don’t know, but I do know that for once you haven’t been able
to put two and two together, and we’ve got to settle this tonight
because tomorrow’ll be too late. Bob Ewell’s got a kitchen knife in his
craw.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate added that Atticus wasn’t going to stand there and maintain
that any boy Jem’s size with a busted arm had fight enough left in him
to tackle and kill a grown man in the pitch dark.</p>
<p>“Heck,” said Atticus abruptly, “that was a switchblade you were
waving. Where’d you get it?”</p>
<p>“Took it off a drunk man,” Mr. Tate answered coolly.</p>
<p>I was trying to remember. Mr. Ewell was on me… then he went down… Jem
must have gotten up. At least I thought…</p>
<p>“Heck?”</p>
<p>“I said I took it off a drunk man downtown tonight. Ewell probably
found that kitchen knife in the dump somewhere. Honed it down and bided
his time… just bided his time.”</p>
<p>Atticus made his way to the swing and sat down. His hands dangled
limply between his knees. He was looking at the floor. He had moved with
the same slowness that night in front of the jail, when I thought it
took him forever to fold his newspaper and toss it in his chair.</p>
<p>Mr. Tate clumped softly around the porch. “It ain’t your decision,
Mr. Finch, it’s all mine. It’s my decision and my responsibility. For
once, if you don’t see it my way, there’s not much you can do about it.
If you wanta try, I’ll call you a liar to your face. Your boy never
stabbed Bob Ewell,” he said slowly, “didn’t come near a mile of it and
now you know it. All he wanted to do was get him and his sister safely
home.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate stopped pacing. He stopped in front of Atticus, and his back
was to us. “I’m not a very good man, sir, but I am sheriff of Maycomb
County. Lived in this town all my life an‘ I’m goin’ on forty-three
years old. Know everything that’s happened here since before I was born.
There’s a black boy dead for no reason, and the man responsible for it’s
dead. Let the dead bury the dead this time, Mr. Finch. Let the dead bury
the dead.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate went to the swing and picked up his hat. It was lying beside
Atticus. Mr. Tate pushed back his hair and put his hat on.</p>
<p>“I never heard tell that it’s against the law for a citizen to do his
utmost to prevent a crime from being committed, which is exactly what he
did, but maybe you’ll say it’s my duty to tell the town all about it and
not hush it up. Know what’d happen then? All the ladies in Maycomb
includin‘ my wife’d be knocking on his door bringing angel food cakes.
To my way of thinkin’, Mr. Finch, taking the one man who’s done you and
this town a great service an‘ draggin’ him with his shy ways into the
limelight—to me, that’s a sin. It’s a sin and I’m not about to have it
on my head. If it was any other man, it’d be different. But not this
man, Mr. Finch.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate was trying to dig a hole in the floor with the toe of his
boot. He pulled his nose, then he massaged his left arm. “I may not be
much, Mr. Finch, but I’m still sheriff of Maycomb County and Bob Ewell
fell on his knife. Good night, sir.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate stamped off the porch and strode across the front yard. His
car door slammed and he drove away.</p>
<p>Atticus sat looking at the floor for a long time. Finally he raised
his head. “Scout,” he said, “Mr. Ewell fell on his knife. Can you
possibly understand?”</p>
<p>Atticus looked like he needed cheering up. I ran to him and hugged
him and kissed him with all my might. “Yes sir, I understand,” I
reassured him. “Mr. Tate was right.”</p>
<p>Atticus disengaged himself and looked at me. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’d be sort of like shootin‘ a mockingbird, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>Atticus put his face in my hair and rubbed it. When he got up and
walked across the porch into the shadows, his youthful step had
returned. Before he went inside the house, he stopped in front of Boo
Radley. “Thank you for my children, Arthur,” he said.</p>
