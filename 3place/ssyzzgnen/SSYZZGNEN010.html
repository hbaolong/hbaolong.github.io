<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>“You can just take that back, boy!”</p>
<p>This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a
rather thin time for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready
to let fly. Atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever
heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and too big for such
childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better off
everybody would be. I soon forgot.</p>
<p>Cecil Jacobs made me forget. He had announced in the schoolyard the
day before that Scout Finch’s daddy defended niggers. I denied it, but
told Jem.</p>
<p>“What’d he mean sayin‘ that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” Jem said. “Ask Atticus, he’ll tell you.”</p>
<p>“Do you defend niggers, Atticus?” I asked him that evening.</p>
<p>“Of course I do. Don’t say nigger, Scout. That’s common.”</p>
<p>“’s what everybody at school says.”</p>
<p>“From now on it’ll be everybody less one—”</p>
<p>“Well if you don’t want me to grow up talkin‘ that way, why do you
send me to school?”</p>
<p>My father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our
compromise, my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or
another since my first day’s dose of it: the beginning of last September
had brought on sinking spells, dizziness, and mild gastric complaints. I
went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head
against the head of Miss Rachel’s cook’s son, who was afflicted with a
tremendous ringworm. It didn’t take.</p>
<p>But I was worrying another bone. “Do all lawyers defend n-Negroes,
Atticus?”</p>
<p>“Of course they do, Scout.”</p>
<p>“Then why did Cecil say you defended niggers? He made it sound like
you were runnin‘ a still.”</p>
<p>Atticus sighed. “I’m simply defending a Negro—his name’s Tom
Robinson. He lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. He’s
a member of Calpurnia’s church, and Cal knows his family well. She says
they’re clean-living folks. Scout, you aren’t old enough to understand
some things yet, but there’s been some high talk around town to the
effect that I shouldn’t do much about defending this man. It’s a
peculiar case—it won’t come to trial until summer session. John Taylor
was kind enough to give us a postponement…”</p>
<p>“If you shouldn’t be defendin‘ him, then why are you doin’ it?”</p>
<p>“For a number of reasons,” said Atticus. “The main one is, if I
didn’t I couldn’t hold up my head in town, I couldn’t represent this
county in the legislature, I couldn’t even tell you or Jem not to do
something again.”</p>
<p>“You mean if you didn’t defend that man, Jem and me wouldn’t have to
mind you any more?”</p>
<p>“That’s about right.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the
nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime
that affects him personally. This one’s mine, I guess. You might hear
some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will:
you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what
anybody says to you, don’t you let ’em get your goat. Try fighting with
your head for a change… it’s a good one, even if it does resist
learning.”</p>
<p>“Atticus, are we going to win it?”</p>
<p>“No, honey.”</p>
<p>“Then why—”</p>
<p>“Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is
no reason for us not to try to win,” Atticus said.</p>
<p>“You sound like Cousin Ike Finch,” I said. Cousin Ike Finch was
Maycomb County’s sole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General
Hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain. At least once a year
Atticus, Jem and I called on him, and I would have to kiss him. It was
horrible. Jem and I would listen respectfully to Atticus and Cousin Ike
rehash the war. “Tell you, Atticus,” Cousin Ike would say, “the Missouri
Compromise was what licked us, but if I had to go through it agin I’d
walk every step of the way there an‘ every step back jist like I did
before an’ furthermore we’d whip ‘em this time… now in 1864, when
Stonewall Jackson came around by—I beg your pardon, young folks. Ol’
Blue Light was in heaven then, God rest his saintly brow…”</p>
<p>“Come here, Scout,” said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked
my head under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently.
“It’s different this time,” he said. “This time we aren’t fighting the
Yankees, we’re fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how
bitter things get, they’re still our friends and this is still our
home.”</p>
<p>With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day:
“You gonna take that back, boy?”</p>
<p>“You gotta make me first!” he yelled. “My folks said your daddy was a
disgrace an‘ that nigger oughta hang from the water-tank!”</p>
<p>I drew a bead on him, remembered what Atticus had said, then dropped
my fists and walked away, “Scout’s a cow—ward!” ringing in my ears. It
was the first time I ever walked away from a fight.</p>
<p>Somehow, if I fought Cecil I would let Atticus down. Atticus so
rarely asked Jem and me to do something for him, I could take being
called a coward for him. I felt extremely noble for having remembered,
and remained noble for three weeks. Then Christmas came and disaster
struck.</p>
<p>Jem and I viewed Christmas with mixed feelings. The good side was the
tree and Uncle Jack Finch. Every Christmas Eve day we met Uncle Jack at
Maycomb Junction, and he would spend a week with us.</p>
<p>A flip of the coin revealed the uncompromising lineaments of Aunt
Alexandra and Francis.</p>
<p>I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandra’s husband, but
as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, “Get off the
fence,” once, I never saw any reason to take notice of him. Neither did
Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst of friendliness, Aunty and Uncle
Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home as soon as was humanly
possible, married, and produced Francis. Henry and his wife deposited
Francis at his grandparents’ every Christmas, then pursued their own
pleasures.</p>
<p>No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas
day at home. We went to Finch’s Landing every Christmas in my memory.
The fact that Aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being
forced to spend a religious holiday with Francis Hancock. He was a year
older than I, and I avoided him on principle: he enjoyed everything I
disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous diversions.</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra was Atticus’s sister, but when Jem told me about
changelings and siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth,
that my grandparents had perhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch.
Had I ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to
obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra would have been analogous to
Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was cold and there.</p>
<p>When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had
to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always
thought it funny when Uncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were
the only two men we ever saw kiss each other. Uncle Jack shook hands
with Jem and swung me high, but not high enough: Uncle Jack was a head
shorter than Atticus; the baby of the family, he was younger than Aunt
Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of
his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin.</p>
<p>He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably
because he never behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor
service for Jem and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would
tell us exactly what he was going to do, give us an estimation of how
much it would hurt, and explain the use of any tongs he employed. One
Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot,
permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me
laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every
day he stood at his gate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and
delivering five-minute sermons to any passers-by who desired spiritual
comfort. I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull
it out, but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said
he yanked it while I was laughing, that was what was known as
relativity.</p>
<p>“What’s in those packages?” I asked him, pointing to the long thin
parcels the porter had given him.</p>
<p>“None of your business,” he said.</p>
<p>Jem said, “How’s Rose Aylmer?”</p>
<p>Rose Aylmer was Uncle Jack’s cat. She was a beautiful yellow female
Uncle Jack said was one of the few women he could stand permanently. He
reached into his coat pocket and brought out some snapshots. We admired
them.</p>
<p>“She’s gettin‘ fat,” I said.</p>
<p>“I should think so. She eats all the leftover fingers and ears from
the hospital.”</p>
<p>“Aw, that’s a damn story,” I said.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
<p>Atticus said, “Don’t pay any attention to her, Jack. She’s trying you
out. Cal says she’s been cussing fluently for a week, now.” Uncle Jack
raised his eyebrows and said nothing. I was proceeding on the dim
theory, aside from the innate attractiveness of such words, that if
Atticus discovered I had picked them up at school he wouldn’t make me
go.</p>
<p>But at supper that evening when I asked him to pass the damn ham,
please, Uncle Jack pointed at me. “See me afterwards, young lady,” he
said.</p>
<p>When supper was over, Uncle Jack went to the livingroom and sat down.
He slapped his thighs for me to come sit on his lap. I liked to smell
him: he was like a bottle of alcohol and something pleasantly sweet. He
pushed back my bangs and looked at me. “You’re more like Atticus than
your mother,” he said. “You’re also growing out of your pants a
little.”</p>
<p>“I reckon they fit all right.”</p>
<p>“You like words like damn and hell now, don’t you?”</p>
<p>I said I reckoned so.</p>
<p>“Well I don’t,” said Uncle Jack, “not unless there’s extreme
provocation connected with ’em. I’ll be here a week, and I don’t want to
hear any words like that while I’m here. Scout, you’ll get in trouble if
you go around saying things like that. You want to grow up to be a lady,
don’t you?”</p>
<p>I said not particularly.</p>
<p>“Of course you do. Now let’s get to the tree.”</p>
<p>We decorated the tree until bedtime, and that night I dreamed of the
two long packages for Jem and me. Next morning Jem and I dived for them:
they were from Atticus, who had written Uncle Jack to get them for us,
and they were what we had asked for.</p>
<p>“Don’t point them in the house,” said Atticus, when Jem aimed at a
picture on the wall.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to teach ’em to shoot,” said Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>“That’s your job,” said Atticus. “I merely bowed to the
inevitable.”</p>
<p>It took Atticus’s courtroom voice to drag us away from the tree. He
declined to let us take our air rifles to the Landing (I had already
begun to think of shooting Francis) and said if we made one false move
he’d take them away from us for good.</p>
<p>Finch’s Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a
high bluff and ending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff,
were traces of an old cotton landing, where Finch Negroes had loaded
bales and produce, unloaded blocks of ice, flour and sugar, farm
equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut road ran from the riverside
and vanished among dark trees. At the end of the road was a two-storied
white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In his old
age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife;
but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era
ended. The internal arrangements of the Finch house were indicative of
Simon’s guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his
offspring.</p>
<p>There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children,
one for Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives.
Simple enough; but the daughters’ rooms could be reached only by one
staircase, Welcome’s room and the guestroom only by another. The
Daughters’ Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of their parents,
so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters’ nocturnal comings and
goings.</p>
<p>There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto
it by a wooden catwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole,
used to summon field hands or as a distress signal; a widow’s walk was
on the roof, but no widows walked there—from it, Simon oversaw his
overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives of
surrounding landholders.</p>
<p>There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one
Finch female, recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it
from raiders in the neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the
Daughters’ Staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed
through. When we arrived at the Landing, Aunt Alexandra kissed Uncle
Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy shook hands silently with
Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who gave us a
present. Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to
entertain our cousin. Francis was eight and slicked back his hair.</p>
<p>“What’d you get for Christmas?” I asked politely.</p>
<p>“Just what I asked for,” he said. Francis had requested a pair of
knee-pants, a red leather booksack, five shirts and an untied bow
tie.</p>
<p>“That’s nice,” I lied. “Jem and me got air rifles, and Jem got a
chemistry set—”</p>
<p>“A toy one, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“No, a real one. He’s gonna make me some invisible ink, and I’m gonna
write to Dill in it.”</p>
<p>Francis asked what was the use of that.</p>
<p>“Well, can’t you just see his face when he gets a letter from me with
nothing in it? It’ll drive him nuts.”</p>
<p>Talking to Francis gave me the sensation of settling slowly to the
bottom of the ocean. He was the most boring child I ever met. As he
lived in Mobile, he could not inform on me to school authorities, but he
managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra, who in turn
unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me hell,
whichever struck his fancy. But the only time I ever heard Atticus speak
sharply to anyone was when I once heard him say, “Sister, I do the best
I can with them!” It had something to do with my going around in
overalls.</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not
possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do
nothing in a dress, she said I wasn’t supposed to be doing things that
required pants. Aunt Alexandra’s vision of my deportment involved
playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl
necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of
sunshine in my father’s lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray
of sunshine in pants just as well, but Aunty said that one had to behave
like a sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown progressively worse
every year. She hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge,
but when I asked Atticus about it, he said there were already enough
sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business, he didn’t mind me
much the way I was.</p>
<p>At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem
and Francis sat with the adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued
to isolate me long after Jem and Francis graduated to the big table. I
often wondered what she thought I’d do, get up and throw something? I
sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table
with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how civilized I
could be; after all, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps. When
I begged Atticus to use his influence, he said he had none—we were
guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. He also said Aunt Alexandra
didn’t understand girls much, she’d never had one.</p>
<p>But her cooking made up for everything: three kinds of meat, summer
vegetables from her pantry shelves; peach pickles, two kinds of cake and
ambrosia constituted a modest Christmas dinner. Afterwards, the adults
made for the livingroom and sat around in a dazed condition. Jem lay on
the floor, and I went to the back yard. “Put on your coat,” said Atticus
dreamily, so I didn’t hear him.</p>
<p>Francis sat beside me on the back steps. “That was the best yet,” I
said.</p>
<p>“Grandma’s a wonderful cook,” said Francis. “She’s gonna teach me
how.”</p>
<p>“Boys don’t cook.” I giggled at the thought of Jem in an apron.</p>
<p>“Grandma says all men should learn to cook, that men oughta be
careful with their wives and wait on ’em when they don’t feel good,”
said my cousin.</p>
<p>“I don’t want Dill waitin‘ on me,” I said. “I’d rather wait on
him.”</p>
<p>“Dill?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Don’t say anything about it yet, but we’re gonna get married
as soon as we’re big enough. He asked me last summer.”</p>
<p>Francis hooted.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with him?” I asked. “Ain’t anything the matter
with him.”</p>
<p>“You mean that little runt Grandma says stays with Miss Rachel every
summer?”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly who I mean.”</p>
<p>“I know all about him,” said Francis.</p>
<p>“What about him?”</p>
<p>“Grandma says he hasn’t got a home—”</p>
<p>“Has too, he lives in Meridian.”</p>
<p>“—he just gets passed around from relative to relative, and Miss
Rachel keeps him every summer.”</p>
<p>“Francis, that’s not so!”</p>
<p>Francis grinned at me. “You’re mighty dumb sometimes, Jean Louise.
Guess you don’t know any better, though.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“If Uncle Atticus lets you run around with stray dogs, that’s his own
business, like Grandma says, so it ain’t your fault. I guess it ain’t
your fault if Uncle Atticus is a nigger-lover besides, but I’m here to
tell you it certainly does mortify the rest of the family—”</p>
<p>“Francis, what the hell do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Just what I said. Grandma says it’s bad enough he lets you all run
wild, but now he’s turned out a nigger-lover we’ll never be able to walk
the streets of Maycomb agin. He’s ruinin‘ the family, that’s what he’s
doin’.”</p>
<p>Francis rose and sprinted down the catwalk to the old kitchen. At a
safe distance he called, “He’s nothin‘ but a nigger-lover!”</p>
<p>“He is not!” I roared. “I don’t know what you’re talkin‘ about, but
you better cut it out this red hot minute!”</p>
<p>I leaped off the steps and ran down the catwalk. It was easy to
collar Francis. I said take it back quick.</p>
<p>Francis jerked loose and sped into the old kitchen. “Nigger-lover!”
he yelled.</p>
<p>When stalking one’s prey, it is best to take one’s time. Say nothing,
and as sure as eggs he will become curious and emerge. Francis appeared
at the kitchen door. “You still mad, Jean Louise?” he asked
tentatively.</p>
<p>“Nothing to speak of,” I said.</p>
<p>Francis came out on the catwalk.</p>
<p>“You gonna take it back, Fra—ancis?” But I was too quick on the draw.
Francis shot back into the kitchen, so I retired to the steps. I could
wait patiently. I had sat there perhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt
Alexandra speak: “Where’s Francis?”</p>
<p>“He’s out yonder in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“He knows he’s not supposed to play in there.”</p>
<p>Francis came to the door and yelled, “Grandma, she’s got me in here
and she won’t let me out!”</p>
<p>“What is all this, Jean Louise?”</p>
<p>I looked up at Aunt Alexandra. “I haven’t got him in there, Aunty, I
ain’t holdin‘ him.”</p>
<p>“Yes she is,” shouted Francis, “she won’t let me out!”</p>
<p>“Have you all been fussing?”</p>
<p>“Jean Louise got mad at me, Grandma,” called Francis.</p>
<p>“Francis, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out
of you I’ll tell your father. Did I hear you say hell a while ago?”</p>
<p>“Nome.”</p>
<p>“I thought I did. I’d better not hear it again.”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener. The moment she was out of
sight Francis came out head up and grinning. “Don’t you fool with me,”
he said.</p>
<p>He jumped into the yard and kept his distance, kicking tufts of
grass, turning around occasionally to smile at me. Jem appeared on the
porch, looked at us, and went away. Francis climbed the mimosa tree,
came down, put his hands in his pockets and strolled around the yard.
“Hah!” he said. I asked him who he thought he was, Uncle Jack? Francis
said he reckoned I got told, for me to just sit there and leave him
alone.</p>
<p>“I ain’t botherin‘ you,” I said.</p>
<p>Francis looked at me carefully, concluded that I had been
sufficiently subdued, and crooned softly, “Nigger-lover…”</p>
<p>This time, I split my knuckle to the bone on his front teeth. My left
impaired, I sailed in with my right, but not for long. Uncle Jack pinned
my arms to my sides and said, “Stand still!”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra ministered to Francis, wiping his tears away with her
handkerchief, rubbing his hair, patting his cheek. Atticus, Jem, and
Uncle Jimmy had come to the back porch when Francis started yelling.</p>
<p>“Who started this?” said Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>Francis and I pointed at each other. “Grandma,” he bawled, “she
called me a whore-lady and jumped on me!”</p>
<p>“Is that true, Scout?” said Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>“I reckon so.”</p>
<p>When Uncle Jack looked down at me, his features were like Aunt
Alexandra’s. “You know I told you you’d get in trouble if you used words
like that? I told you, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, but—”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re in trouble now. Stay there.”</p>
<p>I was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried in
indecision a moment too long: I turned to flee but Uncle Jack was
quicker. I found myself suddenly looking at a tiny ant struggling with a
bread crumb in the grass.</p>
<p>“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live! I hate you an‘
despise you an’ hope you die tomorrow!” A statement that seemed to
encourage Uncle Jack, more than anything. I ran to Atticus for comfort,
but he said I had it coming and it was high time we went home. I climbed
into the back seat of the car without saying good-bye to anyone, and at
home I ran to my room and slammed the door. Jem tried to say something
nice, but I wouldn’t let him.</p>
<p>When I surveyed the damage there were only seven or eight red marks,
and I was reflecting upon relativity when someone knocked on the door. I
asked who it was; Uncle Jack answered.</p>
<p>“Go away!”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack said if I talked like that he’d lick me again, so I was
quiet. When he entered the room I retreated to a corner and turned my
back on him. “Scout,” he said, “do you still hate me?”</p>
<p>“Go on, please sir.”</p>
<p>“Why, I didn’t think you’d hold it against me,” he said. “I’m
disappointed in you—you had that coming and you know it.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t either.”</p>
<p>“Honey, you can’t go around calling people—”</p>
<p>“You ain’t fair,” I said, “you ain’t fair.”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack’s eyebrows went up. “Not fair? How not?”</p>
<p>“You’re real nice, Uncle Jack, an‘ I reckon I love you even after
what you did, but you don’t understand children much.”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack put his hands on his hips and looked down at me. “And why
do I not understand children, Miss Jean Louise? Such conduct as yours
required little understanding. It was obstreperous, disorderly and
abusive—”</p>
<p>“You gonna give me a chance to tell you? I don’t mean to sass you,
I’m just tryin‘ to tell you.”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack sat down on the bed. His eyebrows came together, and he
peered up at me from under them. “Proceed,” he said.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “Well, in the first place you never stopped to
gimme a chance to tell you my side of it—you just lit right into me.
When Jem an‘ I fuss Atticus doesn’t ever just listen to Jem’s side of
it, he hears mine too, an’ in the second place you told me never to use
words like that except in ex-extreme provocation, and Francis provocated
me enough to knock his block off—”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack scratched his head. “What was your side of it, Scout?”</p>
<p>“Francis called Atticus somethin‘, an’ I wasn’t about to take it off
him.”</p>
<p>“What did Francis call him?”</p>
<p>“A nigger-lover. I ain’t very sure what it means, but the way Francis
said it—tell you one thing right now, Uncle Jack, I’ll be—I swear before
God if I’ll sit there and let him say somethin‘ about Atticus.”</p>
<p>“He called Atticus that?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, he did, an‘ a lot more. Said Atticus’d be the ruination of
the family an’ he let Jem an me run wild…”</p>
<p>From the look on Uncle Jack’s face, I thought I was in for it again.
When he said, “We’ll see about this,” I knew Francis was in for it.
“I’ve a good mind to go out there tonight.”</p>
<p>“Please sir, just let it go. Please.”</p>
<p>“I’ve no intention of letting it go,” he said. “Alexandra should know
about this. The idea of—wait’ll I get my hands on that boy…”</p>
<p>“Uncle Jack, please promise me somethin‘, please sir. Promise you
won’t tell Atticus about this. He—he asked me one time not to let
anything I heard about him make me mad, an’ I’d ruther him think we were
fightin‘ about somethin’ else instead. Please promise…”</p>
<p>“But I don’t like Francis getting away with something like that—”</p>
<p>“He didn’t. You reckon you could tie up my hand? It’s still bleedin‘
some.”</p>
<p>“Of course I will, baby. I know of no hand I would be more delighted
to tie up. Will you come this way?”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack gallantly bowed me to the bathroom. While he cleaned and
bandaged my knuckles, he entertained me with a tale about a funny
nearsighted old gentleman who had a cat named Hodge, and who counted all
the cracks in the sidewalk when he went to town. “There now,” he said.
“You’ll have a very unladylike scar on your wedding-ring finger.”</p>
<p>“Thank you sir. Uncle Jack?”</p>
<p>“Ma’am?”</p>
<p>“What’s a whore-lady?”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack plunged into another long tale about an old Prime Minister
who sat in the House of Commons and blew feathers in the air and tried
to keep them there when all about him men were losing their heads. I
guess he was trying to answer my question, but he made no sense
whatsoever.</p>
<p>Later, when I was supposed to be in bed, I went down the hall for a
drink of water and heard Atticus and Uncle Jack in the livingroom:</p>
<p>“I shall never marry, Atticus.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I might have children.”</p>
<p>Atticus said, “You’ve a lot to learn, Jack.”</p>
<p>“I know. Your daughter gave me my first lessons this afternoon. She
said I didn’t understand children much and told me why. She was quite
right. Atticus, she told me how I should have treated her—oh dear, I’m
so sorry I romped on her.”</p>
<p>Atticus chuckled. “She earned it, so don’t feel too remorseful.”</p>
<p>I waited, on tenterhooks, for Uncle Jack to tell Atticus my side of
it. But he didn’t. He simply murmured, “Her use of bathroom invective
leaves nothing to the imagination. But she doesn’t know the meaning of
half she says—she asked me what a whore-lady was…”</p>
<p>“Did you tell her?”</p>
<p>“No, I told her about Lord Melbourne.”</p>
<p>“Jack! When a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness’
sake. But don’t make a production of it. Children are children, but they
can spot an evasion quicker than adults, and evasion simply muddles ’em.
No,” my father mused, “you had the right answer this afternoon, but the
wrong reasons. Bad language is a stage all children go through, and it
dies with time when they learn they’re not attracting attention with it.
Hotheadedness isn’t. Scout’s got to learn to keep her head and learn
soon, with what’s in store for her these next few months. She’s coming
along, though. Jem’s getting older and she follows his example a good
bit now. All she needs is assistance sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Atticus, you’ve never laid a hand on her.”</p>
<p>“I admit that. So far I’ve been able to get by with threats. Jack,
she minds me as well as she can. Doesn’t come up to scratch half the
time, but she tries.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the answer,” said Uncle Jack.</p>
<p>“No, the answer is she knows I know she tries. That’s what makes the
difference. What bothers me is that she and Jem will have to absorb some
ugly things pretty soon. I’m not worried about Jem keeping his head, but
Scout’d just as soon jump on someone as look at him if her pride’s at
stake…”</p>
<p>I waited for Uncle Jack to break his promise. He still didn’t.</p>
<p>“Atticus, how bad is this going to be? You haven’t had too much
chance to discuss it.”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t be worse, Jack. The only thing we’ve got is a black
man’s word against the Ewells‘. The evidence boils down to
you-did—I-didn’t. The jury couldn’t possibly be expected to take Tom
Robinson’s word against the Ewells’—are you acquainted with the
Ewells?”</p>
<p>Uncle Jack said yes, he remembered them. He described them to
Atticus, but Atticus said, “You’re a generation off. The present ones
are the same, though.”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, then?”</p>
<p>“Before I’m through, I intend to jar the jury a bit—I think we’ll
have a reasonable chance on appeal, though. I really can’t tell at this
stage, Jack. You know, I’d hoped to get through life without a case of
this kind, but John Taylor pointed at me and said, ‘You’re It.’”</p>
<p>“Let this cup pass from you, eh?”</p>
<p>“Right. But do you think I could face my children otherwise? You know
what’s going to happen as well as I do, Jack, and I hope and pray I can
get Jem and Scout through it without bitterness, and most of all,
without catching Maycomb’s usual disease. Why reasonable people go stark
raving mad when anything involving a Negro comes up, is something I
don’t pretend to understand… I just hope that Jem and Scout come to me
for their answers instead of listening to the town. I hope they trust me
enough… Jean Louise?”</p>
<p>My scalp jumped. I stuck my head around the corner. “Sir?”</p>
<p>“Go to bed.”</p>
<p>I scurried to my room and went to bed. Uncle Jack was a prince of a
fellow not to let me down. But I never figured out how Atticus knew I
was listening, and it was not until many years later that I realized he
wanted me to hear every word he said.</p>
