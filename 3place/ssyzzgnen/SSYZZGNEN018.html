<h4 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h4>
<p>“Jem,” I said, “are those the Ewells sittin‘ down yonder?”</p>
<p>“Hush,” said Jem, “Mr. Heck Tate’s testifyin‘.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate had dressed for the occasion. He wore an ordinary business
suit, which made him look somehow like every other man: gone were his
high boots, lumber jacket, and bullet-studded belt. From that moment he
ceased to terrify me. He was sitting forward in the witness chair, his
hands clasped between his knees, listening attentively to the circuit
solicitor.</p>
<p>The solicitor, a Mr. Gilmer, was not well known to us. He was from
Abbottsville; we saw him only when court convened, and that rarely, for
court was of no special interest to Jem and me. A balding, smooth-faced
man, he could have been anywhere between forty and sixty. Although his
back was to us, we knew he had a slight cast in one of his eyes which he
used to his advantage: he seemed to be looking at a person when he was
actually doing nothing of the kind, thus he was hell on juries and
witnesses. The jury, thinking themselves under close scrutiny, paid
attention; so did the witnesses, thinking likewise.</p>
<p>“…in your own words, Mr. Tate,” Mr. Gilmer was saying.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Mr. Tate, touching his glasses and speaking to his
knees, “I was called—”</p>
<p>“Could you say it to the jury, Mr. Tate? Thank you. Who called
you?”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate said, “I was fetched by Bob—by Mr. Bob Ewell yonder, one
night—”</p>
<p>“What night, sir?”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate said, “It was the night of November twenty-first. I was just
leaving my office to go home when B—Mr. Ewell came in, very excited he
was, and said get out to his house quick, some nigger’d raped his
girl.”</p>
<p>“Did you go?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. Got in the car and went out as fast as I could.”</p>
<p>“And what did you find?”</p>
<p>“Found her lying on the floor in the middle of the front room, one on
the right as you go in. She was pretty well beat up, but I heaved her to
her feet and she washed her face in a bucket in the corner and said she
was all right. I asked her who hurt her and she said it was Tom
Robinson—”</p>
<p>Judge Taylor, who had been concentrating on his fingernails, looked
up as if he were expecting an objection, but Atticus was quiet.</p>
<p>“—asked her if he beat her like that, she said yes he had. Asked her
if he took advantage of her and she said yes he did. So I went down to
Robinson’s house and brought him back. She identified him as the one, so
I took him in. That’s all there was to it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” said Mr. Gilmer.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor said, “Any questions, Atticus?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said my father. He was sitting behind his table; his chair was
skewed to one side, his legs were crossed and one arm was resting on the
back of his chair.</p>
<p>“Did you call a doctor, Sheriff? Did anybody call a doctor?” asked
Atticus.</p>
<p>“No sir,” said Mr. Tate.</p>
<p>“Didn’t call a doctor?”</p>
<p>“No sir,” repeated Mr. Tate.</p>
<p>“Why not?” There was an edge to Atticus’s voice.</p>
<p>“Well I can tell you why I didn’t. It wasn’t necessary, Mr. Finch.
She was mighty banged up. Something sho‘ happened, it was obvious.”</p>
<p>“But you didn’t call a doctor? While you were there did anyone send
for one, fetch one, carry her to one?”</p>
<p>“No sir—”</p>
<p>Judge Taylor broke in. “He’s answered the question three times,
Atticus. He didn’t call a doctor.”</p>
<p>Atticus said, “I just wanted to make sure, Judge,” and the judge
smiled.</p>
<p>Jem’s hand, which was resting on the balcony rail, tightened around
it. He drew in his breath suddenly. Glancing below, I saw no
corresponding reaction, and wondered if Jem was trying to be dramatic.
Dill was watching peacefully, and so was Reverend Sykes beside him.</p>
<p>“What is it?” I whispered, and got a terse, “Sh-h!”</p>
<p>“Sheriff,” Atticus was saying, “you say she was mighty banged up. In
what way?”</p>
<p>“Well—”</p>
<p>“Just describe her injuries, Heck.”</p>
<p>“Well, she was beaten around the head. There was already bruises
comin‘ on her arms, and it happened about thirty minutes before—”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate grinned. “Sorry, that’s what they said. Anyway, she was
pretty bruised up when I got there, and she had a black eye comin‘.”</p>
<p>“Which eye?”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate blinked and ran his hands through his hair. “Let’s see,” he
said softly, then he looked at Atticus as if he considered the question
childish. “Can’t you remember?” Atticus asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Tate pointed to an invisible person five inches in front of him
and said, “Her left.”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Sheriff,” said Atticus. “Was it her left facing you
or her left looking the same way you were?”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate said, “Oh yes, that’d make it her right. It was her right
eye, Mr. Finch. I remember now, she was bunged up on that side of her
face…”</p>
<p>Mr. Tate blinked again, as if something had suddenly been made plain
to him. Then he turned his head and looked around at Tom Robinson. As if
by instinct, Tom Robinson raised his head.</p>
<p>Something had been made plain to Atticus also, and it brought him to
his feet. “Sheriff, please repeat what you said.”</p>
<p>“It was her right eye, I said.”</p>
<p>“No…” Atticus walked to the court reporter’s desk and bent down to
the furiously scribbling hand. It stopped, flipped back the shorthand
pad, and the court reporter said, “‘Mr. Finch. I remember now she was
bunged up on that side of the face.’”</p>
<p>Atticus looked up at Mr. Tate. “Which side again, Heck?”</p>
<p>“The right side, Mr. Finch, but she had more bruises—you wanta hear
about ’em?”</p>
<p>Atticus seemed to be bordering on another question, but he thought
better of it and said, “Yes, what were her other injuries?” As Mr. Tate
answered, Atticus turned and looked at Tom Robinson as if to say this
was something they hadn’t bargained for.</p>
<p>“…her arms were bruised, and she showed me her neck. There were
definite finger marks on her gullet—”</p>
<p>“All around her throat? At the back of her neck?”</p>
<p>“I’d say they were all around, Mr. Finch.”</p>
<p>“You would?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir, she had a small throat, anybody could’a reached around it
with—”</p>
<p>“Just answer the question yes or no, please, Sheriff,” said Atticus
dryly, and Mr. Tate fell silent.</p>
<p>Atticus sat down and nodded to the circuit solicitor, who shook his
head at the judge, who nodded to Mr. Tate, who rose stiffly and stepped
down from the witness stand.</p>
<p>Below us, heads turned, feet scraped the floor, babies were shifted
to shoulders, and a few children scampered out of the courtroom. The
Negroes behind us whispered softly among themselves; Dill was asking
Reverend Sykes what it was all about, but Reverend Sykes said he didn’t
know. So far, things were utterly dull: nobody had thundered, there were
no arguments between opposing counsel, there was no drama; a grave
disappointment to all present, it seemed. Atticus was proceeding
amiably, as if he were involved in a title dispute. With his infinite
capacity for calming turbulent seas, he could make a rape case as dry as
a sermon. Gone was the terror in my mind of stale whiskey and barnyard
smells, of sleepy-eyed sullen men, of a husky voice calling in the
night, “Mr. Finch? They gone?” Our nightmare had gone with daylight,
everything would come out all right.</p>
<p>All the spectators were as relaxed as Judge Taylor, except Jem. His
mouth was twisted into a purposeful half-grin, and his eyes happy about,
and he said something about corroborating evidence, which made me sure
he was showing off.</p>
<p>“…Robert E. Lee Ewell!”</p>
<p>In answer to the clerk’s booming voice, a little bantam cock of a man
rose and strutted to the stand, the back of his neck reddening at the
sound of his name. When he turned around to take the oath, we saw that
his face was as red as his neck. We also saw no resemblance to his
namesake. A shock of wispy new-washed hair stood up from his forehead;
his nose was thin, pointed, and shiny; he had no chin to speak of—it
seemed to be part of his crepey neck.</p>
<p>“—so help me God,” he crowed.</p>
<p>Every town the size of Maycomb had families like the Ewells. No
economic fluctuations changed their status—people like the Ewells lived
as guests of the county in prosperity as well as in the depths of a
depression. No truant officers could keep their numerous offspring in
school; no public health officer could free them from congenital
defects, various worms, and the diseases indigenous to filthy
surroundings.</p>
<p>Maycomb’s Ewells lived behind the town garbage dump in what was once
a Negro cabin. The cabin’s plank walls were supplemented with sheets of
corrugated iron, its roof shingled with tin cans hammered flat, so only
its general shape suggested its original design: square, with four tiny
rooms opening onto a shotgun hall, the cabin rested uneasily upon four
irregular lumps of limestone. Its windows were merely open spaces in the
walls, which in the summertime were covered with greasy strips of
cheesecloth to keep out the varmints that feasted on Maycomb’s
refuse.</p>
<p>The varmints had a lean time of it, for the Ewells gave the dump a
thorough gleaning every day, and the fruits of their industry (those
that were not eaten) made the plot of ground around the cabin look like
the playhouse of an insane child: what passed for a fence was bits of
tree-limbs, broomsticks and tool shafts, all tipped with rusty
hammer-heads, snaggle-toothed rake heads, shovels, axes and grubbing
hoes, held on with pieces of barbed wire. Enclosed by this barricade was
a dirty yard containing the remains of a Model-T Ford (on blocks), a
discarded dentist’s chair, an ancient icebox, plus lesser items: old
shoes, worn-out table radios, picture frames, and fruit jars, under
which scrawny orange chickens pecked hopefully.</p>
<p>One corner of the yard, though, bewildered Maycomb. Against the
fence, in a line, were six chipped-enamel slop jars holding brilliant
red geraniums, cared for as tenderly as if they belonged to Miss Maudie
Atkinson, had Miss Maudie deigned to permit a geranium on her premises.
People said they were Mayella Ewell’s.</p>
<p>Nobody was quite sure how many children were on the place. Some
people said six, others said nine; there were always several dirty-faced
ones at the windows when anyone passed by. Nobody had occasion to pass
by except at Christmas, when the churches delivered baskets, and when
the mayor of Maycomb asked us to please help the garbage collector by
dumping our own trees and trash.</p>
<p>Atticus took us with him last Christmas when he complied with the
mayor’s request. A dirt road ran from the highway past the dump, down to
a small Negro settlement some five hundred yards beyond the Ewells‘. It
was necessary either to back out to the highway or go the full length of
the road and turn around; most people turned around in the Negroes’
front yards. In the frosty December dusk, their cabins looked neat and
snug with pale blue smoke rising from the chimneys and doorways glowing
amber from the fires inside. There were delicious smells about: chicken,
bacon frying crisp as the twilight air. Jem and I detected squirrel
cooking, but it took an old countryman like Atticus to identify possum
and rabbit, aromas that vanished when we rode back past the Ewell
residence.</p>
<p>All the little man on the witness stand had that made him any better
than his nearest neighbors was, that if scrubbed with lye soap in very
hot water, his skin was white.</p>
<p>“Mr. Robert Ewell?” asked Mr. Gilmer.</p>
<p>“That’s m’name, cap’n,” said the witness.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer’s back stiffened a little, and I felt sorry for him.
Perhaps I’d better explain something now. I’ve heard that lawyers’
children, on seeing their parents in court in the heat of argument, get
the wrong idea: they think opposing counsel to be the personal enemies
of their parents, they suffer agonies, and are surprised to see them
often go out arm-in-arm with their tormenters during the first recess.
This was not true of Jem and me. We acquired no traumas from watching
our father win or lose. I’m sorry that I can’t provide any drama in this
respect; if I did, it would not be true. We could tell, however, when
debate became more acrimonious than professional, but this was from
watching lawyers other than our father. I never heard Atticus raise his
voice in my life, except to a deaf witness. Mr. Gilmer was doing his
job, as Atticus was doing his. Besides, Mr. Ewell was Mr. Gilmer’s
witness, and he had no business being rude to him of all people.</p>
<p>“Are you the father of Mayella Ewell?” was the next question.</p>
<p>“Well, if I ain’t I can’t do nothing about it now, her ma’s dead,”
was the answer.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor stirred. He turned slowly in his swivel chair and looked
benignly at the witness. “Are you the father of Mayella Ewell?” he
asked, in a way that made the laughter below us stop suddenly.</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” Mr. Ewell said meekly.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor went on in tones of good will: “This the first time
you’ve ever been in court? I don’t recall ever seeing you here.” At the
witness’s affirmative nod he continued, “Well, let’s get something
straight. There will be no more audibly obscene speculations on any
subject from anybody in this courtroom as long as I’m sitting here. Do
you understand?”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell nodded, but I don’t think he did. Judge Taylor sighed and
said, “All right, Mr. Gilmer?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir. Mr. Ewell, would you tell us in your own words what
happened on the evening of November twenty-first, please?”</p>
<p>Jem grinned and pushed his hair back. Just-in-your-own words was
Mr. Gilmer’s trademark. We often wondered who else’s words Mr. Gilmer
was afraid his witness might employ.</p>
<p>“Well, the night of November twenty-one I was comin‘ in from the
woods with a load o’kindlin’ and just as I got to the fence I heard
Mayella screamin‘ like a stuck hog inside the house—”</p>
<p>Here Judge Taylor glanced sharply at the witness and must have
decided his speculations devoid of evil intent, for he subsided
sleepily.</p>
<p>“What time was it, Mr. Ewell?”</p>
<p>“Just ‘fore sundown. Well, I was sayin’ Mayella was screamin‘ fit to
beat Jesus—” another glance from the bench silenced Mr. Ewell.</p>
<p>“Yes? She was screaming?” said Mr. Gilmer.</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell looked confusedly at the judge. “Well, Mayella was raisin‘
this holy racket so I dropped m’load and run as fast as I could but I
run into th’ fence, but when I got distangled I run up to th‘ window and
I seen—” Mr. Ewell’s face grew scarlet. He stood up and pointed his
finger at Tom Robinson. “—I seen that black nigger yonder ruttin’ on my
Mayella!”</p>
<p>So serene was Judge Taylor’s court, that he had few occasions to use
his gavel, but he hammered fully five minutes. Atticus was on his feet
at the bench saying something to him, Mr. Heck Tate as first officer of
the county stood in the middle aisle quelling the packed courtroom.
Behind us, there was an angry muffled groan from the colored people.</p>
<p>Reverend Sykes leaned across Dill and me, pulling at Jem’s elbow.
“Mr. Jem,” he said, “you better take Miss Jean Louise home. Mr. Jem, you
hear me?”</p>
<p>Jem turned his head. “Scout, go home. Dill, you’n‘Scout go home.”</p>
<p>“You gotta make me first,” I said, remembering Atticus’s blessed
dictum.</p>
<p>Jem scowled furiously at me, then said to Reverend Sykes, “I think
it’s okay, Reverend, she doesn’t understand it.”</p>
<p>I was mortally offended. “I most certainly do, I c’n understand
anything you can.”</p>
<p>“Aw hush. She doesn’t understand it, Reverend, she ain’t nine
yet.”</p>
<p>Reverend Sykes’s black eyes were anxious. “Mr. Finch know you all are
here? This ain’t fit for Miss Jean Louise or you boys either.”</p>
<p>Jem shook his head. “He can’t see us this far away. It’s all right,
Reverend.”</p>
<p>I knew Jem would win, because I knew nothing could make him leave
now. Dill and I were safe, for a while: Atticus could see us from where
he was, if he looked.</p>
<p>As Judge Taylor banged his gavel, Mr. Ewell was sitting smugly in the
witness chair, surveying his handiwork. With one phrase he had turned
happy picknickers into a sulky, tense, murmuring crowd, being slowly
hypnotized by gavel taps lessening in intensity until the only sound in
the courtroom was a dim pink-pink-pink: the judge might have been
rapping the bench with a pencil.</p>
<p>In possession of his court once more, Judge Taylor leaned back in his
chair. He looked suddenly weary; his age was showing, and I thought
about what Atticus had said—he and Mrs. Taylor didn’t kiss much—he must
have been nearly seventy.</p>
<p>“There has been a request,” Judge Taylor said, “that this courtroom
be cleared of spectators, or at least of women and children, a request
that will be denied for the time being. People generally see what they
look for, and hear what they listen for, and they have the right to
subject their children to it, but I can assure you of one thing: you
will receive what you see and hear in silence or you will leave this
courtroom, but you won’t leave it until the whole boiling of you come
before me on contempt charges. Mr. Ewell, you will keep your testimony
within the confines of Christian English usage, if that is possible.
Proceed, Mr. Gilmer.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell reminded me of a deaf-mute. I was sure he had never heard
the words Judge Taylor directed at him—his mouth struggled silently with
them—but their import registered on his face. Smugness faded from it,
replaced by a dogged earnestness that fooled Judge Taylor not at all: as
long as Mr. Ewell was on the stand, the judge kept his eyes on him, as
if daring him to make a false move.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer and Atticus exchanged glances. Atticus was sitting down
again, his fist rested on his cheek and we could not see his face.
Mr. Gilmer looked rather desperate. A question from Judge Taylor made
him relax: “Mr. Ewell, did you see the defendant having sexual
intercourse with your daughter?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>The spectators were quiet, but the defendant said something. Atticus
whispered to him, and Tom Robinson was silent.</p>
<p>“You say you were at the window?” asked Mr. Gilmer.</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>“How far is it from the ground?”</p>
<p>“’bout three foot.”</p>
<p>“Did you have a clear view of the room?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>“How did the room look?”</p>
<p>“Well, it was all slung about, like there was a fight.”</p>
<p>“What did you do when you saw the defendant?”</p>
<p>“Well, I run around the house to get in, but he run out the front
door just ahead of me. I sawed who he was, all right. I was too
distracted about Mayella to run after’im. I run in the house and she was
lyin‘ on the floor squallin’—”</p>
<p>“Then what did you do?”</p>
<p>“Why, I run for Tate quick as I could. I knowed who it was, all
right, lived down yonder in that nigger-nest, passed the house every
day. Jedge, I’ve asked this county for fifteen years to clean out that
nest down yonder, they’re dangerous to live around ‘sides devaluin’ my
property—”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Ewell,” said Mr. Gilmer hurriedly.</p>
<p>The witness made a hasty descent from the stand and ran smack into
Atticus, who had risen to question him. Judge Taylor permitted the court
to laugh.</p>
<p>“Just a minute, sir,” said Atticus genially. “Could I ask you a
question or two?”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell backed up into the witness chair, settled himself, and
regarded Atticus with haughty suspicion, an expression common to Maycomb
County witnesses when confronted by opposing counsel.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ewell,” Atticus began, “folks were doing a lot of running that
night. Let’s see, you say you ran to the house, you ran to the window,
you ran inside, you ran to Mayella, you ran for Mr. Tate. Did you,
during all this running, run for a doctor?”</p>
<p>“Wadn’t no need to. I seen what happened.”</p>
<p>“But there’s one thing I don’t understand,” said Atticus. “Weren’t
you concerned with Mayella’s condition?”</p>
<p>“I most positively was,” said Mr. Ewell. “I seen who done it.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean her physical condition. Did you not think the nature of
her injuries warranted immediate medical attention?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you think she should have had a doctor, immediately?”</p>
<p>The witness said he never thought of it, he had never called a doctor
to any of his’n in his life, and if he had it would have cost him five
dollars. “That all?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not quite,” said Atticus casually. “Mr. Ewell, you heard the
sheriff’s testimony, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“You were in the courtroom when Mr. Heck Tate was on the stand,
weren’t you? You heard everything he said, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell considered the matter carefully, and seemed to decide that
the question was safe.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Do you agree with his description of Mayella’s injuries?”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>Atticus looked around at Mr. Gilmer and smiled. Mr. Ewell seemed
determined not to give the defense the time of day.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tate testified that her right eye was blackened, that she was
beaten around the—”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” said the witness. “I hold with everything Tate said.”</p>
<p>“You do?” asked Atticus mildly. “I just want to make sure.” He went
to the court reporter, said something, and the reporter entertained us
for some minutes by reading Mr. Tate’s testimony as if it were
stock-market quotations: “…which eye her left oh yes that’d make it her
right it was her right eye Mr. Finch I remember now she was bunged.” He
flipped the page. “Up on that side of the face Sheriff please repeat
what you said it was her right eye I said—”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Bert,” said Atticus. “You heard it again, Mr. Ewell. Do
you have anything to add to it? Do you agree with the sheriff?”</p>
<p>“I holds with Tate. Her eye was blacked and she was mighty beat
up.”</p>
<p>The little man seemed to have forgotten his previous humiliation from
the bench. It was becoming evident that he thought Atticus an easy
match. He seemed to grow ruddy again; his chest swelled, and once more
he was a red little rooster. I thought he’d burst his shirt at Atticus’s
next question:</p>
<p>“Mr. Ewell, can you read and write?”</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer interrupted. “Objection,” he said. “Can’t see what
witness’s literacy has to do with the case,
irrelevant’n‘immaterial.”</p>
<p>Judge Taylor was about to speak but Atticus said, “Judge, if you’ll
allow the question plus another one you’ll soon see.”</p>
<p>“All right, let’s see,” said Judge Taylor, “but make sure we see,
Atticus. Overruled.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer seemed as curious as the rest of us as to what bearing the
state of Mr. Ewell’s education had on the case.</p>
<p>“I’ll repeat the question,” said Atticus. “Can you read and
write?”</p>
<p>“I most positively can.”</p>
<p>“Will you write your name and show us?”</p>
<p>“I most positively will. How do you think I sign my relief
checks?”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell was endearing himself to his fellow citizens. The whispers
and chuckles below us probably had to do with what a card he was.</p>
<p>I was becoming nervous. Atticus seemed to know what he was doing—but
it seemed to me that he’d gone frog-sticking without a light. Never,
never, never, on cross-examination ask a witness a question you don’t
already know the answer to, was a tenet I absorbed with my baby-food. Do
it, and you’ll often get an answer you don’t want, an answer that might
wreck your case.</p>
<p>Atticus was reaching into the inside pocket of his coat. He drew out
an envelope, then reached into his vest pocket and unclipped his
fountain pen. He moved leisurely, and had turned so that he was in full
view of the jury. He unscrewed the fountain-pen cap and placed it gently
on his table. He shook the pen a little, then handed it with the
envelope to the witness. “Would you write your name for us?” he asked.
“Clearly now, so the jury can see you do it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell wrote on the back of the envelope and looked up
complacently to see Judge Taylor staring at him as if he were some
fragrant gardenia in full bloom on the witness stand, to see Mr. Gilmer
half-sitting, half-standing at his table. The jury was watching him, one
man was leaning forward with his hands over the railing.</p>
<p>“What’s so interestin‘?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You’re left-handed, Mr. Ewell,” said Judge Taylor. Mr. Ewell turned
angrily to the judge and said he didn’t see what his being left-handed
had to do with it, that he was a Christ-fearing man and Atticus Finch
was taking advantage of him. Tricking lawyers like Atticus Finch took
advantage of him all the time with their tricking ways. He had told them
what happened, he’d say it again and again—which he did. Nothing Atticus
asked him after that shook his story, that he’d looked through the
window, then ran the nigger off, then ran for the sheriff. Atticus
finally dismissed him.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer asked him one more question. “About your writing with your
left hand, are you ambidextrous, Mr. Ewell?”</p>
<p>“I most positively am not, I can use one hand good as the other. One
hand good as the other,” he added, glaring at the defense table.</p>
<p>Jem seemed to be having a quiet fit. He was pounding the balcony rail
softly, and once he whispered, “We’ve got him.”</p>
<p>I didn’t think so: Atticus was trying to show, it seemed to me, that
Mr. Ewell could have beaten up Mayella. That much I could follow. If her
right eye was blacked and she was beaten mostly on the right side of the
face, it would tend to show that a left-handed person did it. Sherlock
Holmes and Jem Finch would agree. But Tom Robinson could easily be
left-handed, too. Like Mr. Heck Tate, I imagined a person facing me,
went through a swift mental pantomime, and concluded that he might have
held her with his right hand and pounded her with his left. I looked
down at him. His back was to us, but I could see his broad shoulders and
bull-thick neck. He could easily have done it. I thought Jem was
counting his chickens.</p>
