<h4 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h4>
<p>For reasons unfathomable to the most experienced prophets in Maycomb
County, autumn turned to winter that year. We had two weeks of the
coldest weather since 1885, Atticus said. Mr. Avery said it was written
on the Rosetta Stone that when children disobeyed their parents, smoked
cigarettes and made war on each other, the seasons would change: Jem and
I were burdened with the guilt of contributing to the aberrations of
nature, thereby causing unhappiness to our neighbors and discomfort to
ourselves.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Radley died that winter, but her death caused hardly a
ripple—the neighborhood seldom saw her, except when she watered her
cannas. Jem and I decided that Boo had got her at last, but when Atticus
returned from the Radley house he said she died of natural causes, to
our disappointment.</p>
<p>“Ask him,” Jem whispered.</p>
<p>“You ask him, you’re the oldest.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you oughta ask him.”</p>
<p>“Atticus,” I said, “did you see Mr. Arthur?”</p>
<p>Atticus looked sternly around his newspaper at me: “I did not.”</p>
<p>Jem restrained me from further questions. He said Atticus was still
touchous about us and the Radleys and it wouldn’t do to push him any.
Jem had a notion that Atticus thought our activities that night last
summer were not solely confined to strip poker. Jem had no firm basis
for his ideas, he said it was merely a twitch.</p>
<p>Next morning I awoke, looked out the window and nearly died of
fright. My screams brought Atticus from his bathroom half-shaven.</p>
<p>“The world’s endin‘, Atticus! Please do something—!” I dragged him to
the window and pointed.</p>
<p>“No it’s not,” he said. “It’s snowing.”</p>
<p>Jem asked Atticus would it keep up. Jem had never seen snow either,
but he knew what it was. Atticus said he didn’t know any more about snow
than Jem did. “I think, though, if it’s watery like that, it’ll turn to
rain.”</p>
<p>The telephone rang and Atticus left the breakfast table to answer it.
“That was Eula May,” he said when he returned. “I quote—‘As it has not
snowed in Maycomb County since 1885, there will be no school
today.’”</p>
<p>Eula May was Maycomb’s leading telephone operator. She was entrusted
with issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the
fire siren, and giving first-aid instructions when Dr. Reynolds was
away.</p>
<p>When Atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our
plates instead of out the windows, Jem asked, “How do you make a
snowman?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said Atticus. “I don’t want you all
to be disappointed, but I doubt if there’ll be enough snow for a
snowball, even.”</p>
<p>Calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. When we ran
to the back yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t walk about in it,” said Jem. “Look, every step you
take’s wasting it.”</p>
<p>I looked back at my mushy footprints. Jem said if we waited until it
snowed some more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. I stuck out my
tongue and caught a fat flake. It burned.</p>
<p>“Jem, it’s hot!”</p>
<p>“No it ain’t, it’s so cold it burns. Now don’t eat it, Scout, you’re
wasting it. Let it come down.”</p>
<p>“But I want to walk in it.”</p>
<p>“I know what, we can go walk over at Miss Maudie’s.”</p>
<p>Jem hopped across the front yard. I followed in his tracks. When we
were on the sidewalk in front of Miss Maudie’s, Mr. Avery accosted us.
He had a pink face and a big stomach below his belt.</p>
<p>“See what you’ve done?” he said. “Hasn’t snowed in Maycomb since
Appomattox. It’s bad children like you makes the seasons change.”</p>
<p>I wondered if Mr. Avery knew how hopefully we had watched last summer
for him to repeat his performance, and reflected that if this was our
reward, there was something to say for sin. I did not wonder where
Mr. Avery gathered his meteorological statistics: they came straight
from the Rosetta Stone.</p>
<p>“Jem Finch, you Jem Finch!”</p>
<p>“Miss Maudie’s callin‘ you, Jem.”</p>
<p>“You all stay in the middle of the yard. There’s some thrift buried
under the snow near the porch. Don’t step on it!”</p>
<p>“Yessum!” called Jem. “It’s beautiful, ain’t it, Miss Maudie?”</p>
<p>“Beautiful my hind foot! If it freezes tonight it’ll carry off all my
azaleas!”</p>
<p>Miss Maudie’s old sunhat glistened with snow crystals. She was
bending over some small bushes, wrapping them in burlap bags. Jem asked
her what she was doing that for.</p>
<p>“Keep ’em warm,” she said.</p>
<p>“How can flowers keep warm? They don’t circulate.”</p>
<p>“I cannot answer that question, Jem Finch. All I know is if it
freezes tonight these plants’ll freeze, so you cover ’em up. Is that
clear?”</p>
<p>“Yessum. Miss Maudie?”</p>
<p>“What, sir?”</p>
<p>“Could Scout and me borrow some of your snow?”</p>
<p>“Heavens alive, take it all! There’s an old peach basket under the
house, haul it off in that.” Miss Maudie’s eyes narrowed. “Jem Finch,
what are you going to do with my snow?”</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” said Jem, and we transferred as much snow as we could
from Miss Maudie’s yard to ours, a slushy operation.</p>
<p>“What are we gonna do, Jem?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You’ll see,” he said. “Now get the basket and haul all the snow you
can rake up from the back yard to the front. Walk back in your tracks,
though,” he cautioned.</p>
<p>“Are we gonna have a snow baby, Jem?”</p>
<p>“No, a real snowman. Gotta work hard, now.”</p>
<p>Jem ran to the back yard, produced the garden hoe and began digging
quickly behind the woodpile, placing any worms he found to one side. He
went in the house, returned with the laundry hamper, filled it with
earth and carried it to the front yard.</p>
<p>When we had five baskets of earth and two baskets of snow, Jem said
we were ready to begin.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think this is kind of a mess?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Looks messy now, but it won’t later,” he said.</p>
<p>Jem scooped up an armful of dirt, patted it into a mound on which he
added another load, and another until he had constructed a torso.</p>
<p>“Jem, I ain’t ever heard of a nigger snowman,” I said.</p>
<p>“He won’t be black long,” he grunted.</p>
<p>Jem procured some peachtree switches from the back yard, plaited
them, and bent them into bones to be covered with dirt.</p>
<p>“He looks like Stephanie Crawford with her hands on her hips,” I
said. “Fat in the middle and little-bitty arms.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make ’em bigger.” Jem sloshed water over the mud man and added
more dirt. He looked thoughtfully at it for a moment, then he molded a
big stomach below the figure’s waistline. Jem glanced at me, his eyes
twinkling: “Mr. Avery’s sort of shaped like a snowman, ain’t he?”</p>
<p>Jem scooped up some snow and began plastering it on. He permitted me
to cover only the back, saving the public parts for himself. Gradually
Mr. Avery turned white.</p>
<p>Using bits of wood for eyes, nose, mouth, and buttons, Jem succeeded
in making Mr. Avery look cross. A stick of stovewood completed the
picture. Jem stepped back and viewed his creation.</p>
<p>“It’s lovely, Jem,” I said. “Looks almost like he’d talk to you.”</p>
<p>“It is, ain’t it?” he said shyly.</p>
<p>We could not wait for Atticus to come home for dinner, but called and
said we had a big surprise for him. He seemed surprised when he saw most
of the back yard in the front yard, but he said we had done a jim-dandy
job. “I didn’t know how you were going to do it,” he said to Jem, “but
from now on I’ll never worry about what’ll become of you, son, you’ll
always have an idea.”</p>
<p>Jem’s ears reddened from Atticus’s compliment, but he looked up
sharply when he saw Atticus stepping back. Atticus squinted at the
snowman a while. He grinned, then laughed. “Son, I can’t tell what
you’re going to be—an engineer, a lawyer, or a portrait painter. You’ve
perpetrated a near libel here in the front yard. We’ve got to disguise
this fellow.”</p>
<p>Atticus suggested that Jem hone down his creation’s front a little,
swap a broom for the stovewood, and put an apron on him.</p>
<p>Jem explained that if he did, the snowman would become muddy and
cease to be a snowman.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what you do, so long as you do something,” said
Atticus. “You can’t go around making caricatures of the neighbors.”</p>
<p>“Ain’t a characterture,” said Jem. “It looks just like him.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Avery might not think so.”</p>
<p>“I know what!” said Jem. He raced across the street, disappeared into
Miss Maudie’s back yard and returned triumphant. He stuck her sunhat on
the snowman’s head and jammed her hedge-clippers into the crook of his
arm. Atticus said that would be fine.</p>
<p>Miss Maudie opened her front door and came out on the porch. She
looked across the street at us. Suddenly she grinned. “Jem Finch,” she
called. “You devil, bring me back my hat, sir!”</p>
<p>Jem looked up at Atticus, who shook his head. “She’s just fussing,”
he said. “She’s really impressed with your—accomplishments.”</p>
<p>Atticus strolled over to Miss Maudie’s sidewalk, where they engaged
in an arm-waving conversation, the only phrase of which I caught was
“…erected an absolute morphodite in that yard! Atticus, you’ll never
raise ’em!”</p>
<p>The snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by
nightfall Mr. Avery’s direst predictions came true: Calpurnia kept every
fireplace in the house blazing, but we were cold. When Atticus came home
that evening he said we were in for it, and asked Calpurnia if she
wanted to stay with us for the night. Calpurnia glanced up at the high
ceilings and long windows and said she thought she’d be warmer at her
house. Atticus drove her home in the car.</p>
<p>Before I went to sleep Atticus put more coal on the fire in my room.
He said the thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest
night in his memory, and that our snowman outside was frozen solid.</p>
<p>Minutes later, it seemed, I was awakened by someone shaking me.
Atticus’s overcoat was spread across me. “Is it morning already?”</p>
<p>“Baby, get up.”</p>
<p>Atticus was holding out my bathrobe and coat. “Put your robe on
first,” he said.</p>
<p>Jem was standing beside Atticus, groggy and tousled. He was holding
his overcoat closed at the neck, his other hand was jammed into his
pocket. He looked strangely overweight.</p>
<p>“Hurry, hon,” said Atticus. “Here’re your shoes and socks.”</p>
<p>Stupidly, I put them on. “Is it morning?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s a little after one. Hurry now.”</p>
<p>That something was wrong finally got through to me. “What’s the
matter?”</p>
<p>By then he did not have to tell me. Just as the birds know where to
go when it rains, I knew when there was trouble in our street. Soft
taffeta-like sounds and muffled scurrying sounds filled me with helpless
dread.</p>
<p>“Whose is it?”</p>
<p>“Miss Maudie’s, hon,” said Atticus gently.</p>
<p>At the front door, we saw fire spewing from Miss Maudie’s diningroom
windows. As if to confirm what we saw, the town fire siren wailed up the
scale to a treble pitch and remained there, screaming.</p>
<p>“It’s gone, ain’t it?” moaned Jem.</p>
<p>“I expect so,” said Atticus. “Now listen, both of you. Go down and
stand in front of the Radley Place. Keep out of the way, do you hear?
See which way the wind’s blowing?”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Jem. “Atticus, reckon we oughta start moving the furniture
out?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, son. Do as I tell you. Run now. Take care of Scout, you
hear? Don’t let her out of your sight.”</p>
<p>With a push, Atticus started us toward the Radley front gate. We
stood watching the street fill with men and cars while fire silently
devoured Miss Maudie’s house. “Why don’t they hurry, why don’t they
hurry…” muttered Jem.</p>
<p>We saw why. The old fire truck, killed by the cold, was being pushed
from town by a crowd of men. When the men attached its hose to a
hydrant, the hose burst and water shot up, tinkling down on the
pavement.</p>
<p>“Oh-h Lord, Jem…”</p>
<p>Jem put his arm around me. “Hush, Scout,” he said. “It ain’t time to
worry yet. I’ll let you know when.”</p>
<p>The men of Maycomb, in all degrees of dress and undress, took
furniture from Miss Maudie’s house to a yard across the street. I saw
Atticus carrying Miss Maudie’s heavy oak rocking chair, and thought it
sensible of him to save what she valued most.</p>
<p>Sometimes we heard shouts. Then Mr. Avery’s face appeared in an
upstairs window. He pushed a mattress out the window into the street and
threw down furniture until men shouted, “Come down from there, Dick! The
stairs are going! Get outta there, Mr. Avery!”</p>
<p>Mr. Avery began climbing through the window.</p>
<p>“Scout, he’s stuck…” breathed Jem. “Oh God…”</p>
<p>Mr. Avery was wedged tightly. I buried my head under Jem’s arm and
didn’t look again until Jem cried, “He’s got loose, Scout! He’s all
right!”</p>
<p>I looked up to see Mr. Avery cross the upstairs porch. He swung his
legs over the railing and was sliding down a pillar when he slipped. He
fell, yelled, and hit Miss Maudie’s shrubbery.</p>
<p>Suddenly I noticed that the men were backing away from Miss Maudie’s
house, moving down the street toward us. They were no longer carrying
furniture. The fire was well into the second floor and had eaten its way
to the roof: window frames were black against a vivid orange center.</p>
<p>“Jem, it looks like a pumpkin—”</p>
<p>“Scout, look!”</p>
<p>Smoke was rolling off our house and Miss Rachel’s house like fog off
a riverbank, and men were pulling hoses toward them. Behind us, the fire
truck from Abbottsville screamed around the curve and stopped in front
of our house.</p>
<p>“That book…” I said.</p>
<p>“What?” said Jem.</p>
<p>“That Tom Swift book, it ain’t mine, it’s Dill’s…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Scout, it ain’t time to worry yet,” said Jem. He
pointed. “Looka yonder.”</p>
<p>In a group of neighbors, Atticus was standing with his hands in his
overcoat pockets. He might have been watching a football game. Miss
Maudie was beside him.</p>
<p>“See there, he’s not worried yet,” said Jem.</p>
<p>“Why ain’t he on top of one of the houses?”</p>
<p>“He’s too old, he’d break his neck.”</p>
<p>“You think we oughta make him get our stuff out?”</p>
<p>“Let’s don’t pester him, he’ll know when it’s time,” said Jem.</p>
<p>The Abbottsville fire truck began pumping water on our house; a man
on the roof pointed to places that needed it most. I watched our
Absolute Morphodite go black and crumble; Miss Maudie’s sunhat settled
on top of the heap. I could not see her hedge-clippers. In the heat
between our house, Miss Rachel’s and Miss Maudie’s, the men had long ago
shed coats and bathrobes. They worked in pajama tops and nightshirts
stuffed into their pants, but I became aware that I was slowly freezing
where I stood. Jem tried to keep me warm, but his arm was not enough. I
pulled free of it and clutched my shoulders. By dancing a little, I
could feel my feet.</p>
<p>Another fire truck appeared and stopped in front of Miss Stephanie
Crawford’s. There was no hydrant for another hose, and the men tried to
soak her house with hand extinguishers.</p>
<p>Miss Maudie’s tin roof quelled the flames. Roaring, the house
collapsed; fire gushed everywhere, followed by a flurry of blankets from
men on top of the adjacent houses, beating out sparks and burning chunks
of wood.</p>
<p>It was dawn before the men began to leave, first one by one, then in
groups. They pushed the Maycomb fire truck back to town, the
Abbottsville truck departed, the third one remained. We found out next
day it had come from Clark’s Ferry, sixty miles away.</p>
<p>Jem and I slid across the street. Miss Maudie was staring at the
smoking black hole in her yard, and Atticus shook his head to tell us
she did not want to talk. He led us home, holding onto our shoulders to
cross the icy street. He said Miss Maudie would stay with Miss Stephanie
for the time being.</p>
<p>“Anybody want some hot chocolate?” he asked. I shuddered when Atticus
started a fire in the kitchen stove.</p>
<p>As we drank our cocoa I noticed Atticus looking at me, first with
curiosity, then with sternness. “I thought I told you and Jem to stay
put,” he said.</p>
<p>“Why, we did. We stayed—”</p>
<p>“Then whose blanket is that?”</p>
<p>“Blanket?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am, blanket. It isn’t ours.”</p>
<p>I looked down and found myself clutching a brown woolen blanket I was
wearing around my shoulders, squaw-fashion.</p>
<p>“Atticus, I don’t know, sir… I—”</p>
<p>I turned to Jem for an answer, but Jem was even more bewildered than
I. He said he didn’t know how it got there, we did exactly as Atticus
had told us, we stood down by the Radley gate away from everybody, we
didn’t move an inch—Jem stopped.</p>
<p>“Mr. Nathan was at the fire,” he babbled, “I saw him, I saw him, he
was tuggin‘ that mattress—Atticus, I swear…”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, son.” Atticus grinned slowly. “Looks like all of
Maycomb was out tonight, in one way or another. Jem, there’s some
wrapping paper in the pantry, I think. Go get it and we’ll—”</p>
<p>“Atticus, no sir!”</p>
<p>Jem seemed to have lost his mind. He began pouring out our secrets
right and left in total disregard for my safety if not for his own,
omitting nothing, knot-hole, pants and all.</p>
<p>“…Mr. Nathan put cement in that tree, Atticus, an‘ he did it to stop
us findin’ things—he’s crazy, I reckon, like they say, but Atticus, I
swear to God he ain’t ever harmed us, he ain’t ever hurt us, he coulda
cut my throat from ear to ear that night but he tried to mend my pants
instead… he ain’t ever hurt us, Atticus—”</p>
<p>Atticus said, “Whoa, son,” so gently that I was greatly heartened. It
was obvious that he had not followed a word Jem said, for all Atticus
said was, “You’re right. We’d better keep this and the blanket to
ourselves. Someday, maybe, Scout can thank him for covering her up.”</p>
<p>“Thank who?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Boo Radley. You were so busy looking at the fire you didn’t know it
when he put the blanket around you.”</p>
<p>My stomach turned to water and I nearly threw up when Jem held out
the blanket and crept toward me. “He sneaked out of the house—turn
‘round—sneaked up, an’ went like this!”</p>
<p>Atticus said dryly, “Do not let this inspire you to further glory,
Jeremy.”</p>
<p>Jem scowled, “I ain’t gonna do anything to him,” but I watched the
spark of fresh adventure leave his eyes. “Just think, Scout,” he said,
“if you’d just turned around, you’da seen him.”</p>
<p>Calpurnia woke us at noon. Atticus had said we need not go to school
that day, we’d learn nothing after no sleep. Calpurnia said for us to
try and clean up the front yard.</p>
<p>Miss Maudie’s sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly
in amber, and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. We
found her in her back yard, gazing at her frozen charred azaleas. “We’re
bringing back your things, Miss Maudie,” said Jem. “We’re awful
sorry.”</p>
<p>Miss Maudie looked around, and the shadow of her old grin crossed her
face. “Always wanted a smaller house, Jem Finch. Gives me more yard.
Just think, I’ll have more room for my azaleas now!”</p>
<p>“You ain’t grievin‘, Miss Maudie?” I asked, surprised. Atticus said
her house was nearly all she had.</p>
<p>“Grieving, child? Why, I hated that old cow barn. Thought of settin‘
fire to it a hundred times myself, except they’d lock me up.”</p>
<p>“But—”</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry about me, Jean Louise Finch. There are ways of doing
things you don’t know about. Why, I’ll build me a little house and take
me a couple of roomers and—gracious, I’ll have the finest yard in
Alabama. Those Bellingraths’ll look plain puny when I get started!”</p>
<p>Jem and I looked at each other. “How’d it catch, Miss Maudie?” he
asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Jem. Probably the flue in the kitchen. I kept a fire
in there last night for my potted plants. Hear you had some unexpected
company last night, Miss Jean Louise.”</p>
<p>“How’d you know?”</p>
<p>“Atticus told me on his way to town this morning. Tell you the truth,
I’d like to’ve been with you. And I’d‘ve had sense enough to turn
around, too.”</p>
<p>Miss Maudie puzzled me. With most of her possessions gone and her
beloved yard a shambles, she still took a lively and cordial interest in
Jem’s and my affairs.</p>
<p>She must have seen my perplexity. She said, “Only thing I worried
about last night was all the danger and commotion it caused. This whole
neighborhood could have gone up. Mr. Avery’ll be in bed for a week—he’s
right stove up. He’s too old to do things like that and I told him so.
Soon as I can get my hands clean and when Stephanie Crawford’s not
looking, I’ll make him a Lane cake. That Stephanie’s been after my
recipe for thirty years, and if she thinks I’ll give it to her just
because I’m staying with her she’s got another think coming.”</p>
<p>I reflected that if Miss Maudie broke down and gave it to her, Miss
Stephanie couldn’t follow it anyway. Miss Maudie had once let me see it:
among other things, the recipe called for one large cup of sugar.</p>
<p>It was a still day. The air was so cold and clear we heard the
courthouse clock clank, rattle and strain before it struck the hour.
Miss Maudie’s nose was a color I had never seen before, and I inquired
about it.</p>
<p>“I’ve been out here since six o’clock,” she said. “Should be frozen
by now.” She held up her hands. A network of tiny lines crisscrossed her
palms, brown with dirt and dried blood.</p>
<p>“You’ve ruined ’em,” said Jem. “Why don’t you get a colored man?”
There was no note of sacrifice in his voice when he added, “Or
Scout’n’me, we can help you.”</p>
<p>Miss Maudie said, “Thank you sir, but you’ve got a job of your own
over there.” She pointed to our yard.</p>
<p>“You mean the Morphodite?” I asked. “Shoot, we can rake him up in a
jiffy.”</p>
<p>Miss Maudie stared down at me, her lips moving silently. Suddenly she
put her hands to her head and whooped. When we left her, she was still
chuckling.</p>
<p>Jem said he didn’t know what was the matter with her—that was just
Miss Maudie.</p>
