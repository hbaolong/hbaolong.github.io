<h4 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h4>
<p>After many telephone calls, much pleading on behalf of the defendant,
and a long forgiving letter from his mother, it was decided that Dill
could stay. We had a week of peace together. After that, little, it
seemed. A nightmare was upon us.</p>
<p>It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was
in her chair in the corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the
floor reading. It had been a placid week: I had minded Aunty; Jem had
outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and me construct a new rope
ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radley
come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the
back door to the front yard and he’d follow it, like an ant). There was
a knock on the front door, Jem answered it and said it was Mr. Heck
Tate.</p>
<p>“Well, ask him to come in,” said Atticus.</p>
<p>“I already did. There’s some men outside in the yard, they want you
to come out.”</p>
<p>In Maycomb, grown men stood outside in the front yard for only two
reasons: death and politics. I wondered who had died. Jem and I went to
the front door, but Atticus called, “Go back in the house.”</p>
<p>Jem turned out the livingroom lights and pressed his nose to a window
screen. Aunt Alexandra protested. “Just for a second, Aunty, let’s see
who it is,” he said.</p>
<p>Dill and I took another window. A crowd of men was standing around
Atticus. They all seemed to be talking at once.</p>
<p>“…movin‘ him to the county jail tomorrow,” Mr. Tate was saying, “I
don’t look for any trouble, but I can’t guarantee there won’t be
any…”</p>
<p>“Don’t be foolish, Heck,” Atticus said. “This is Maycomb.”</p>
<p>“…said I was just uneasy.”</p>
<p>“Heck, we’ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure
there’s nothing to be uneasy about. This is Saturday,” Atticus said.
“Trial’ll probably be Monday. You can keep him one night, can’t you? I
don’t think anybody in Maycomb’ll begrudge me a client, with times this
hard.”</p>
<p>There was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when Mr. Link Deas
said, “Nobody around here’s up to anything, it’s that Old Sarum bunch
I’m worried about… can’t you get a—what is it, Heck?”</p>
<p>“Change of venue,” said Mr. Tate. “Not much point in that, now is
it?”</p>
<p>Atticus said something inaudible. I turned to Jem, who waved me to
silence.</p>
<p>“—besides,” Atticus was saying, “you’re not scared of that crowd, are
you?”</p>
<p>“…know how they do when they get shinnied up.”</p>
<p>“They don’t usually drink on Sunday, they go to church most of the
day…” Atticus said.</p>
<p>“This is a special occasion, though…” someone said.</p>
<p>They murmured and buzzed until Aunty said if Jem didn’t turn on the
livingroom lights he would disgrace the family. Jem didn’t hear her.</p>
<p>“—don’t see why you touched it in the first place,” Mr. Link Deas was
saying. “You’ve got everything to lose from this, Atticus. I mean
everything.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?”</p>
<p>This was Atticus’s dangerous question. “Do you really think you want
to move there, Scout?” Bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept
clean of my men. “Do you really think that, son? Then read this.” Jem
would struggle the rest of an evening through the speeches of Henry W.
Grady.</p>
<p>“Link, that boy might go to the chair, but he’s not going till the
truth’s told.” Atticus’s voice was even. “And you know what the truth
is.”</p>
<p>There was a murmur among the group of men, made more ominous when
Atticus moved back to the bottom front step and the men drew nearer to
him.</p>
<p>Suddenly Jem screamed, “Atticus, the telephone’s ringing!”</p>
<p>The men jumped a little and scattered; they were people we saw every
day: merchants, in-town farmers; Dr. Reynolds was there; so was
Mr. Avery.</p>
<p>“Well, answer it, son,” called Atticus.</p>
<p>Laughter broke them up. When Atticus switched on the overhead light
in the livingroom he found Jem at the window, pale except for the vivid
mark of the screen on his nose.</p>
<p>“Why on earth are you all sitting in the dark?” he asked.</p>
<p>Jem watched him go to his chair and pick up the evening paper. I
sometimes think Atticus subjected every crisis of his life to tranquil
evaluation behind The Mobile Register, The Birmingham News and The
Montgomery Advertiser.</p>
<p>“They were after you, weren’t they?” Jem went to him. “They wanted to
get you, didn’t they?”</p>
<p>Atticus lowered the paper and gazed at Jem. “What have you been
reading?” he asked. Then he said gently, “No son, those were our
friends.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a—a gang?” Jem was looking from the corners of his
eyes.</p>
<p>Atticus tried to stifle a smile but didn’t make it. “No, we don’t
have mobs and that nonsense in Maycomb. I’ve never heard of a gang in
Maycomb.”</p>
<p>“Ku Klux got after some Catholics one time.”</p>
<p>“Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either,” said Atticus,
“you’re confusing that with something else. Way back about
nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was a political organization
more than anything. Besides, they couldn’t find anybody to scare. They
paraded by Mr. Sam Levy’s house one night, but Sam just stood on his
porch and told ’em things had come to a pretty pass, he’d sold ’em the
very sheets on their backs. Sam made ’em so ashamed of themselves they
went away.”</p>
<p>The Levy family met all criteria for being Fine Folks: they did the
best they could with the sense they had, and they had been living on the
same plot of ground in Maycomb for five generations.</p>
<p>“The Ku Klux’s gone,” said Atticus. “It’ll never come back.”</p>
<p>I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus
saying to Aunty, “…in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody,
but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life,” a
pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again.</p>
<p>I sought Jem and found him in his room, on the bed deep in thought.
“Have they been at it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Sort of. She won’t let him alone about Tom Robinson. She almost said
Atticus was disgracin‘ the family. Scout… I’m scared.”</p>
<p>“Scared’a what?”</p>
<p>“Scared about Atticus. Somebody might hurt him.” Jem preferred to
remain mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave
him alone.</p>
<p>Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church
when the congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the
yard with another knot of men. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered
if he had seen the light. He never went to church. Even Mr. Underwood
was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for any organization but The Maycomb
Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, and printer. His days
were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionally from
an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news;
people brought it to him. It was said that he made up every edition of
The Maycomb Tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the
linotype. This was believable. Something must have been up to haul
Mr. Underwood out.</p>
<p>I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that they’d moved
Tom Robinson to the Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to
me, that if they’d kept him there in the first place there wouldn’t have
been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on the third row from the
front, and I heard him rumble, “Nearer my God to thee,” some notes
behind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to
be by himself in church.</p>
<p>The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by
Aunt Alexandra’s presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly
after dinner, where if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him
sitting back in his swivel chair reading. Aunt Alexandra composed
herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard,
the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room
with a stack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays
creeping around in Deer’s Pasture.</p>
<p>Shooting on Sundays was prohibited, so Dill and I kicked Jem’s
football around the pasture for a while, which was no fun. Dill asked if
I’d like to have a poke at Boo Radley. I said I didn’t think it’d be
nice to bother him, and spent the rest of the afternoon filling Dill in
on last winter’s events. He was considerably impressed.</p>
<p>We parted at suppertime, and after our meal Jem and I were settling
down to a routine evening, when Atticus did something that interested
us: he came into the livingroom carrying a long electrical extension
cord. There was a light bulb on the end.</p>
<p>“I’m going out for a while,” he said. “You folks’ll be in bed when I
come back, so I’ll say good night now.”</p>
<p>With that, he put his hat on and went out the back door.</p>
<p>“He’s takin‘ the car,” said Jem.</p>
<p>Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts;
another was that he liked to walk. As far back as I could remember,
there was always a Chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse, and
Atticus put many miles on it in business trips, but in Maycomb he walked
to and from his office four times a day, covering about two miles. He
said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk
with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe one’s mind
incapable of definite purpose.</p>
<p>Later on, I bade my aunt and brother good night and was well into a
book when I heard Jem rattling around in his room. His go-to-bed noises
were so familiar to me that I knocked on his door: “Why ain’t you going
to bed?”</p>
<p>“I’m goin‘ downtown for a while.” He was changing his pants.</p>
<p>“Why? It’s almost ten o’clock, Jem.”</p>
<p>He knew it, but he was going anyway.</p>
<p>“Then I’m goin‘ with you. If you say no you’re not, I’m goin’ anyway,
hear?”</p>
<p>Jem saw that he would have to fight me to keep me home, and I suppose
he thought a fight would antagonize Aunty, so he gave in with little
grace.</p>
<p>I dressed quickly. We waited until Aunty’s light went out, and we
walked quietly down the back steps. There was no moon tonight.</p>
<p>“Dill’ll wanta come,” I whispered.</p>
<p>“So he will,” said Jem gloomily.</p>
<p>We leaped over the driveway wall, cut through Miss Rachel’s side yard
and went to Dill’s window. Jem whistled bob-white. Dill’s face appeared
at the screen, disappeared, and five minutes later he unhooked the
screen and crawled out. An old campaigner, he did not speak until we
were on the sidewalk. “What’s up?”</p>
<p>“Jem’s got the look-arounds,” an affliction Calpurnia said all boys
caught at his age.</p>
<p>“I’ve just got this feeling,” Jem said, “just this feeling.”</p>
<p>We went by Mrs. Dubose’s house, standing empty and shuttered, her
camellias grown up in weeds and johnson grass. There were eight more
houses to the post office corner.</p>
<p>The south side of the square was deserted. Giant monkey-puzzle bushes
bristled on each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail
glistened under the street lights. A light shone in the county toilet,
otherwise that side of the courthouse was dark. A larger square of
stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights burned from deep
within them.</p>
<p>Atticus’s office was in the courthouse when he began his law
practice, but after several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in
the Maycomb Bank building. When we rounded the corner of the square, we
saw the car parked in front of the bank. “He’s in there,” said Jem.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t. His office was reached by a long hallway. Looking down
the hall, we should have seen Atticus Finch, Attorney-at-Law in small
sober letters against the light from behind his door. It was dark.</p>
<p>Jem peered in the bank door to make sure. He turned the knob. The
door was locked. “Let’s go up the street. Maybe he’s visitin‘
Mr. Underwood.”</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood not only ran The Maycomb Tribune office, he lived in
it. That is, above it. He covered the courthouse and jailhouse news
simply by looking out his upstairs window. The office building was on
the northwest corner of the square, and to reach it we had to pass the
jail.</p>
<p>The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county’s
buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair
might have designed. It was certainly someone’s dream. Starkly out of
place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed houses, the
Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and two cells
high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy
was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its
ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged
between Tyndal’s Hardware Store and The Maycomb Tribune office. The jail
was Maycomb’s only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked
like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good
solid respectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was
full of niggers.</p>
<p>As we walked up the sidewalk, we saw a solitary light burning in the
distance. “That’s funny,” said Jem, “jail doesn’t have an outside
light.”</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s over the door,” said Dill.</p>
<p>A long extension cord ran between the bars of a second-floor window
and down the side of the building. In the light from its bare bulb,
Atticus was sitting propped against the front door. He was sitting in
one of his office chairs, and he was reading, oblivious of the nightbugs
dancing over his head.</p>
<p>I made to run, but Jem caught me. “Don’t go to him,” he said, “he
might not like it. He’s all right, let’s go home. I just wanted to see
where he was.”</p>
<p>We were taking a short cut across the square when four dusty cars
came in from the Meridian highway, moving slowly in a line. They went
around the square, passed the bank building, and stopped in front of the
jail.</p>
<p>Nobody got out. We saw Atticus look up from his newspaper. He closed
it, folded it deliberately, dropped it in his lap, and pushed his hat to
the back of his head. He seemed to be expecting them.</p>
<p>“Come on,” whispered Jem. We streaked across the square, across the
street, until we were in the shelter of the Jitney Jungle door. Jem
peeked up the sidewalk. “We can get closer,” he said. We ran to Tyndal’s
Hardware door—near enough, at the same time discreet.</p>
<p>In ones and twos, men got out of the cars. Shadows became substance
as lights revealed solid shapes moving toward the jail door. Atticus
remained where he was. The men hid him from view.</p>
<p>“He in there, Mr. Finch?” a man said.</p>
<p>“He is,” we heard Atticus answer, “and he’s asleep. Don’t wake him
up.”</p>
<p>In obedience to my father, there followed what I later realized was a
sickeningly comic aspect of an unfunny situation: the men talked in
near-whispers.</p>
<p>“You know what we want,” another man said. “Get aside from the door,
Mr. Finch.”</p>
<p>“You can turn around and go home again, Walter,” Atticus said
pleasantly. “Heck Tate’s around somewhere.”</p>
<p>“The hell he is,” said another man. “Heck’s bunch’s so deep in the
woods they won’t get out till mornin‘.”</p>
<p>“Indeed? Why so?”</p>
<p>“Called ’em off on a snipe hunt,” was the succinct answer. “Didn’t
you think a’that, Mr. Finch?”</p>
<p>“Thought about it, but didn’t believe it. Well then,” my father’s
voice was still the same, “that changes things, doesn’t it?”</p>
<p>“It do,” another deep voice said. Its owner was a shadow.</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?”</p>
<p>This was the second time I heard Atticus ask that question in two
days, and it meant somebody’s man would get jumped. This was too good to
miss. I broke away from Jem and ran as fast as I could to Atticus.</p>
<p>Jem shrieked and tried to catch me, but I had a lead on him and Dill.
I pushed my way through dark smelly bodies and burst into the circle of
light.</p>
<p>“H-ey, Atticus!”</p>
<p>I thought he would have a fine surprise, but his face killed my joy.
A flash of plain fear was going out of his eyes, but returned when Dill
and Jem wriggled into the light.</p>
<p>There was a smell of stale whiskey and pigpen about, and when I
glanced around I discovered that these men were strangers. They were not
the people I saw last night. Hot embarrassment shot through me: I had
leaped triumphantly into a ring of people I had never seen before.</p>
<p>Atticus got up from his chair, but he was moving slowly, like an old
man. He put the newspaper down very carefully, adjusting its creases
with lingering fingers. They were trembling a little.</p>
<p>“Go home, Jem,” he said. “Take Scout and Dill home.”</p>
<p>We were accustomed to prompt, if not always cheerful acquiescence to
Atticus’s instructions, but from the way he stood Jem was not thinking
of budging.</p>
<p>“Go home, I said.”</p>
<p>Jem shook his head. As Atticus’s fists went to his hips, so did
Jem’s, and as they faced each other I could see little resemblance
between them: Jem’s soft brown hair and eyes, his oval face and
snug-fitting ears were our mother’s, contrasting oddly with Atticus’s
graying black hair and square-cut features, but they were somehow alike.
Mutual defiance made them alike.</p>
<p>“Son, I said go home.”</p>
<p>Jem shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’ll send him home,” a burly man said, and grabbed Jem roughly by
the collar. He yanked Jem nearly off his feet.</p>
<p>“Don’t you touch him!” I kicked the man swiftly. Barefooted, I was
surprised to see him fall back in real pain. I intended to kick his
shin, but aimed too high.</p>
<p>“That’ll do, Scout.” Atticus put his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t kick
folks. No—” he said, as I was pleading justification.</p>
<p>“Ain’t nobody gonna do Jem that way,” I said.</p>
<p>“All right, Mr. Finch, get ’em outa here,” someone growled. “You got
fifteen seconds to get ’em outa here.”</p>
<p>In the midst of this strange assembly, Atticus stood trying to make
Jem mind him. “I ain’t going,” was his steady answer to Atticus’s
threats, requests, and finally, “Please Jem, take them home.”</p>
<p>I was getting a bit tired of that, but felt Jem had his own reasons
for doing as he did, in view of his prospects once Atticus did get him
home. I looked around the crowd. It was a summer’s night, but the men
were dressed, most of them, in overalls and denim shirts buttoned up to
the collars. I thought they must be cold-natured, as their sleeves were
unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. Some wore hats pulled firmly down
over their ears. They were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men who seemed
unused to late hours. I sought once more for a familiar face, and at the
center of the semi-circle I found one.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mr. Cunningham.”</p>
<p>The man did not hear me, it seemed.</p>
<p>“Hey, Mr. Cunningham. How’s your entailment gettin‘ along?”</p>
<p>Mr. Walter Cunningham’s legal affairs were well known to me; Atticus
had once described them at length. The big man blinked and hooked his
thumbs in his overall straps. He seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his
throat and looked away. My friendly overture had fallen flat.</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was
white in contrast to his sunscorched face, which led me to believe that
he wore one most days. He shifted his feet, clad in heavy work
shoes.</p>
<p>“Don’t you remember me, Mr. Cunningham? I’m Jean Louise Finch. You
brought us some hickory nuts one time, remember?” I began to sense the
futility one feels when unacknowledged by a chance acquaintance.</p>
<p>“I go to school with Walter,” I began again. “He’s your boy, ain’t
he? Ain’t he, sir?”</p>
<p>Mr. Cunningham was moved to a faint nod. He did know me, after
all.</p>
<p>“He’s in my grade,” I said, “and he does right well. He’s a good
boy,” I added, “a real nice boy. We brought him home for dinner one
time. Maybe he told you about me, I beat him up one time but he was real
nice about it. Tell him hey for me, won’t you?”</p>
<p>Atticus had said it was the polite thing to talk to people about what
they were interested in, not about what you were interested in.
Mr. Cunningham displayed no interest in his son, so I tackled his
entailment once more in a last-ditch effort to make him feel at
home.</p>
<p>“Entailments are bad,” I was advising him, when I slowly awoke to the
fact that I was addressing the entire aggregation. The men were all
looking at me, some had their mouths half-open. Atticus had stopped
poking at Jem: they were standing together beside Dill. Their attention
amounted to fascination. Atticus’s mouth, even, was half-open, an
attitude he had once described as uncouth. Our eyes met and he shut
it.</p>
<p>“Well, Atticus, I was just sayin‘ to Mr. Cunningham that entailments
are bad an’ all that, but you said not to worry, it takes a long time
sometimes… that you all’d ride it out together…” I was slowly drying up,
wondering what idiocy I had committed. Entailments seemed all right
enough for livingroom talk.</p>
<p>I began to feel sweat gathering at the edges of my hair; I could
stand anything but a bunch of people looking at me. They were quite
still.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” I asked.</p>
<p>Atticus said nothing. I looked around and up at Mr. Cunningham, whose
face was equally impassive. Then he did a peculiar thing. He squatted
down and took me by both shoulders.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell him you said hey, little lady,” he said.</p>
<p>Then he straightened up and waved a big paw. “Let’s clear out,” he
called. “Let’s get going, boys.”</p>
<p>As they had come, in ones and twos the men shuffled back to their
ramshackle cars. Doors slammed, engines coughed, and they were gone.</p>
<p>I turned to Atticus, but Atticus had gone to the jail and was leaning
against it with his face to the wall. I went to him and pulled his
sleeve. “Can we go home now?” He nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave
his face a going-over and blew his nose violently.</p>
<p>“Mr. Finch?”</p>
<p>A soft husky voice came from the darkness above: “They gone?”</p>
<p>Atticus stepped back and looked up. “They’ve gone,” he said. “Get
some sleep, Tom. They won’t bother you any more.”</p>
<p>From a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the
night: “You’re damn tootin‘ they won’t. Had you covered all the time,
Atticus.”</p>
<p>Mr. Underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his
window above The Maycomb Tribune office.</p>
<p>It was long past my bedtime and I was growing quite tired; it seemed
that Atticus and Mr. Underwood would talk for the rest of the night,
Mr. Underwood out the window and Atticus up at him. Finally Atticus
returned, switched off the light above the jail door, and picked up his
chair.</p>
<p>“Can I carry it for you, Mr. Finch?” asked Dill. He had not said a
word the whole time.</p>
<p>“Why, thank you, son.”</p>
<p>Walking toward the office, Dill and I fell into step behind Atticus
and Jem. Dill was encumbered by the chair, and his pace was slower.
Atticus and Jem were well ahead of us, and I assumed that Atticus was
giving him hell for not going home, but I was wrong. As they passed
under a streetlight, Atticus reached out and massaged Jem’s hair, his
one gesture of affection.</p>
