<h4 id="chapter-27">Chapter 27</h4>
<p>Things did settle down, after a fashion, as Atticus said they would.
By the middle of October, only two small things out of the ordinary
happened to two Maycomb citizens. No, there were three things, and they
did not directly concern us—the Finches—but in a way they did.</p>
<p>The first thing was that Mr. Bob Ewell acquired and lost a job in a
matter of days and probably made himself unique in the annals of the
nineteen-thirties: he was the only man I ever heard of who was fired
from the WPA for laziness. I suppose his brief burst of fame brought on
a briefer burst of industry, but his job lasted only as long as his
notoriety: Mr. Ewell found himself as forgotten as Tom Robinson.
Thereafter, he resumed his regular weekly appearances at the welfare
office for his check, and received it with no grace amid obscure
mutterings that the bastards who thought they ran this town wouldn’t
permit an honest man to make a living. Ruth Jones, the welfare lady,
said Mr. Ewell openly accused Atticus of getting his job. She was upset
enough to walk down to Atticus’s office and tell him about it. Atticus
told Miss Ruth not to fret, that if Bob Ewell wanted to discuss
Atticus’s “getting” his job, he knew the way to the office.</p>
<p>The second thing happened to Judge Taylor. Judge Taylor was not a
Sunday-night churchgoer: Mrs. Taylor was. Judge Taylor savored his
Sunday night hour alone in his big house, and churchtime found him holed
up in his study reading the writings of Bob Taylor (no kin, but the
judge would have been proud to claim it). One Sunday night, lost in
fruity metaphors and florid diction, Judge Taylor’s attention was
wrenched from the page by an irritating scratching noise. “Hush,” he
said to Ann Taylor, his fat nondescript dog. Then he realized he was
speaking to an empty room; the scratching noise was coming from the rear
of the house. Judge Taylor clumped to the back porch to let Ann out and
found the screen door swinging open. A shadow on the corner of the house
caught his eye, and that was all he saw of his visitor. Mrs. Taylor came
home from church to find her husband in his chair, lost in the writings
of Bob Taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.</p>
<p>The third thing happened to Helen Robinson, Tom’s widow. If Mr. Ewell
was as forgotten as Tom Robinson, Tom Robinson was as forgotten as Boo
Radley. But Tom was not forgotten by his employer, Mr. Link Deas.
Mr. Link Deas made a job for Helen. He didn’t really need her, but he
said he felt right bad about the way things turned out. I never knew who
took care of her children while Helen was away. Calpurnia said it was
hard on Helen, because she had to walk nearly a mile out of her way to
avoid the Ewells, who, according to Helen, “chunked at her” the first
time she tried to use the public road. Mr. Link Deas eventually received
the impression that Helen was coming to work each morning from the wrong
direction, and dragged the reason out of her. “Just let it be, Mr. Link,
please suh,” Helen begged. “The hell I will,” said Mr. Link. He told her
to come by his store that afternoon before she left. She did, and
Mr. Link closed his store, put his hat firmly on his head, and walked
Helen home. He walked her the short way, by the Ewells‘. On his way
back, Mr. Link stopped at the crazy gate.</p>
<p>“Ewell?” he called. “I say Ewell!”</p>
<p>The windows, normally packed with children, were empty.</p>
<p>“I know every last one of you’s in there a-layin‘ on the floor! Now
hear me, Bob Ewell: if I hear one more peep outa my girl Helen about not
bein’ able to walk this road I’ll have you in jail before sundown!”
Mr. Link spat in the dust and walked home.</p>
<p>Helen went to work next morning and used the public road. Nobody
chunked at her, but when she was a few yards beyond the Ewell house, she
looked around and saw Mr. Ewell walking behind her. She turned and
walked on, and Mr. Ewell kept the same distance behind her until she
reached Mr. Link Deas’s house. All the way to the house, Helen said, she
heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul words. Thoroughly
frightened, she telephoned Mr. Link at his store, which was not too far
from his house. As Mr. Link came out of his store he saw Mr. Ewell
leaning on the fence. Mr. Ewell said, “Don’t you look at me, Link Deas,
like I was dirt. I ain’t jumped your—”</p>
<p>“First thing you can do, Ewell, is get your stinkin‘ carcass off my
property. You’re leanin’ on it an‘ I can’t afford fresh paint for it.
Second thing you can do is stay away from my cook or I’ll have you up
for assault—”</p>
<p>“I ain’t touched her, Link Deas, and ain’t about to go with no
nigger!”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid,
an‘ if assault ain’t enough to keep you locked up awhile, I’ll get you
in on the Ladies’ Law, so get outa my sight! If you don’t think I mean
it, just bother that girl again!”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewell evidently thought he meant it, for Helen reported no
further trouble.</p>
<p>“I don’t like it, Atticus, I don’t like it at all,” was Aunt
Alexandra’s assessment of these events. “That man seems to have a
permanent running grudge against everybody connected with that case. I
know how that kind are about paying off grudges, but I don’t understand
why he should harbor one—he had his way in court, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I think I understand,” said Atticus. “It might be because he knows
in his heart that very few people in Maycomb really believed his and
Mayella’s yarns. He thought he’d be a hero, but all he got for his pain
was… was, okay, we’ll convict this Negro but get back to your dump. He’s
had his fling with about everybody now, so he ought to be satisfied.
He’ll settle down when the weather changes.”</p>
<p>“But why should he try to burgle John Taylor’s house? He obviously
didn’t know John was home or he wouldn’t‘ve tried. Only lights John
shows on Sunday nights are on the front porch and back in his den…”</p>
<p>“You don’t know if Bob Ewell cut that screen, you don’t know who did
it,” said Atticus. “But I can guess. I proved him a liar but John made
him look like a fool. All the time Ewell was on the stand I couldn’t
dare look at John and keep a straight face. John looked at him as if he
were a three-legged chicken or a square egg. Don’t tell me judges don’t
try to prejudice juries,” Atticus chuckled.</p>
<p>By the end of October, our lives had become the familiar routine of
school, play, study. Jem seemed to have put out of his mind whatever it
was he wanted to forget, and our classmates mercifully let us forget our
father’s eccentricities. Cecil Jacobs asked me one time if Atticus was a
Radical. When I asked Atticus, Atticus was so amused I was rather
annoyed, but he said he wasn’t laughing at me. He said, “You tell Cecil
I’m about as radical as Cotton Tom Heflin.”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra was thriving. Miss Maudie must have silenced the whole
missionary society at one blow, for Aunty again ruled that roost. Her
refreshments grew even more delicious. I learned more about the poor
Mrunas’ social life from listening to Mrs. Merriweather: they had so
little sense of family that the whole tribe was one big family. A child
had as many fathers as there were men in the community, as many mothers
as there were women. J. Grimes Everett was doing his utmost to change
this state of affairs, and desperately needed our prayers.</p>
<p>Maycomb was itself again. Precisely the same as last year and the
year before that, with only two minor changes. Firstly, people had
removed from their store windows and automobiles the stickers that said
NRA—WE DO OUR PART. I asked Atticus why, and he said it was because the
National Recovery Act was dead. I asked who killed it: he said nine old
men.</p>
<p>The second change in Maycomb since last year was not one of national
significance. Until then, Halloween in Maycomb was a completely
unorganized affair. Each child did what he wanted to do, with assistance
from other children if there was anything to be moved, such as placing a
light buggy on top of the livery stable. But parents thought things went
too far last year, when the peace of Miss Tutti and Miss Frutti was
shattered.</p>
<p>Misses Tutti and Frutti Barber were maiden ladies, sisters, who lived
together in the only Maycomb residence boasting a cellar. The Barber
ladies were rumored to be Republicans, having migrated from Clanton,
Alabama, in 1911. Their ways were strange to us, and why they wanted a
cellar nobody knew, but they wanted one and they dug one, and they spent
the rest of their lives chasing generations of children out of it.</p>
<p>Misses Tutti and Frutti (their names were Sarah and Frances), aside
from their Yankee ways, were both deaf. Miss Tutti denied it and lived
in a world of silence, but Miss Frutti, not about to miss anything,
employed an ear trumpet so enormous that Jem declared it was a
loudspeaker from one of those dog Victrolas.</p>
<p>With these facts in mind and Halloween at hand, some wicked children
had waited until the Misses Barber were thoroughly asleep, slipped into
their livingroom (nobody but the Radleys locked up at night), stealthily
made away with every stick of furniture therein, and hid it in the
cellar. I deny having taken part in such a thing.</p>
<p>“I heard ’em!” was the cry that awoke the Misses Barber’s neighbors
at dawn next morning. “Heard ’em drive a truck up to the door! Stomped
around like horses. They’re in New Orleans by now!”</p>
<p>Miss Tutti was sure those traveling fur sellers who came through town
two days ago had purloined their furniture. “Da-rk they were,” she said.
“Syrians.”</p>
<p>Mr. Heck Tate was summoned. He surveyed the area and said he thought
it was a local job. Miss Frutti said she’d know a Maycomb voice
anywhere, and there were no Maycomb voices in that parlor last
night—rolling their r’s all over her premises, they were. Nothing less
than the bloodhounds must be used to locate their furniture, Miss Tutti
insisted, so Mr. Tate was obliged to go ten miles out the road, round up
the county hounds, and put them on the trail.</p>
<p>Mr. Tate started them off at the Misses Barber’s front steps, but all
they did was run around to the back of the house and howl at the cellar
door. When Mr. Tate set them in motion three times, he finally guessed
the truth. By noontime that day, there was not a barefooted child to be
seen in Maycomb and nobody took off his shoes until the hounds were
returned.</p>
<p>So the Maycomb ladies said things would be different this year. The
high-school auditorium would be open, there would be a pageant for the
grown-ups; apple-bobbing, taffy-pulling, pinning the tail on the donkey
for the children. There would also be a prize of twenty-five cents for
the best Halloween costume, created by the wearer.</p>
<p>Jem and I both groaned. Not that we’d ever done anything, it was the
principle of the thing. Jem considered himself too old for Halloween
anyway; he said he wouldn’t be caught anywhere near the high school at
something like that. Oh well, I thought, Atticus would take me.</p>
<p>I soon learned, however, that my services would be required on stage
that evening. Mrs. Grace Merriweather had composed an original pageant
entitled Maycomb County: Ad Astra Per Aspera, and I was to be a ham. She
thought it would be adorable if some of the children were costumed to
represent the county’s agricultural products: Cecil Jacobs would be
dressed up to look like a cow; Agnes Boone would make a lovely
butterbean, another child would be a peanut, and on down the line until
Mrs. Merriweather’s imagination and the supply of children were
exhausted.</p>
<p>Our only duties, as far as I could gather from our two rehearsals,
were to enter from stage left as Mrs. Merriweather (not only the author,
but the narrator) identified us. When she called out, “Pork,” that was
my cue. Then the assembled company would sing, “Maycomb County, Maycomb
County, we will aye be true to thee,” as the grand finale, and
Mrs. Merriweather would mount the stage with the state flag.</p>
<p>My costume was not much of a problem. Mrs. Crenshaw, the local
seamstress, had as much imagination as Mrs. Merriweather. Mrs. Crenshaw
took some chicken wire and bent it into the shape of a cured ham. This
she covered with brown cloth, and painted it to resemble the original. I
could duck under and someone would pull the contraption down over my
head. It came almost to my knees. Mrs. Crenshaw thoughtfully left two
peepholes for me. She did a fine job. Jem said I looked exactly like a
ham with legs. There were several discomforts, though: it was hot, it
was a close fit; if my nose itched I couldn’t scratch, and once inside I
could not get out of it alone.</p>
<p>When Halloween came, I assumed that the whole family would be present
to watch me perform, but I was disappointed. Atticus said as tactfully
as he could that he just didn’t think he could stand a pageant tonight,
he was all in. He had been in Montgomery for a week and had come home
late that afternoon. He thought Jem might escort me if I asked him.</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra said she just had to get to bed early, she’d been
decorating the stage all afternoon and was worn out—she stopped short in
the middle of her sentence. She closed her mouth, then opened it to say
something, but no words came.</p>
<p>“’s matter, Aunty?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh nothing, nothing,” she said, “somebody just walked over my
grave.” She put away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick
of apprehension, and suggested that I give the family a preview in the
livingroom. So Jem squeezed me into my costume, stood at the livingroom
door, called out “Po-ork,” exactly as Mrs. Merriweather would have done,
and I marched in. Atticus and Aunt Alexandra were delighted.</p>
<p>I repeated my part for Calpurnia in the kitchen and she said I was
wonderful. I wanted to go across the street to show Miss Maudie, but Jem
said she’d probably be at the pageant anyway.</p>
<p>After that, it didn’t matter whether they went or not. Jem said he
would take me. Thus began our longest journey together.</p>
