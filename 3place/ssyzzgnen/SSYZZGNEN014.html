<h4 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h4>
<p>“Put my bag in the front bedroom, Calpurnia,” was the first thing
Aunt Alexandra said. “Jean Louise, stop scratching your head,” was the
second thing she said.</p>
<p>Calpurnia picked up Aunty’s heavy suitcase and opened the door. “I’ll
take it,” said Jem, and took it. I heard the suitcase hit the bedroom
floor with a thump. The sound had a dull permanence about it. “Have you
come for a visit, Aunty?” I asked. Aunt Alexandra’s visits from the
Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned a bright green
square Buick and a black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state of
tidiness, but today they were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>“Didn’t your father tell you?” she asked.</p>
<p>Jem and I shook our heads.</p>
<p>“Probably he forgot. He’s not in yet, is he?”</p>
<p>“Nome, he doesn’t usually get back till late afternoon,” said
Jem.</p>
<p>“Well, your father and I decided it was time I came to stay with you
for a while.”</p>
<p>“For a while” in Maycomb meant anything from three days to thirty
years. Jem and I exchanged glances.</p>
<p>“Jem’s growing up now and you are too,” she said to me. “We decided
that it would be best for you to have some feminine influence. It won’t
be many years, Jean Louise, before you become interested in clothes and
boys—”</p>
<p>I could have made several answers to this: Cal’s a girl, it would be
many years before I would be interested in boys, I would never be
interested in clothes… but I kept quiet.</p>
<p>“What about Uncle Jimmy?” asked Jem. “Is he comin‘, too?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, he’s staying at the Landing. He’ll keep the place going.”</p>
<p>The moment I said, “Won’t you miss him?” I realized that this was not
a tactful question. Uncle Jimmy present or Uncle Jimmy absent made not
much difference, he never said anything. Aunt Alexandra ignored my
question.</p>
<p>I could think of nothing else to say to her. In fact I could never
think of anything to say to her, and I sat thinking of past painful
conversations between us: How are you, Jean Louise? Fine, thank you
ma’am, how are you? Very well, thank you, what have you been doing with
yourself? Nothin‘. Don’t you do anything? Nome. Certainly you have
friends? Yessum. Well what do you all do? Nothin’.</p>
<p>It was plain that Aunty thought me dull in the extreme, because I
once heard her tell Atticus that I was sluggish.</p>
<p>There was a story behind all this, but I had no desire to extract it
from her then. Today was Sunday, and Aunt Alexandra was positively
irritable on the Lord’s Day. I guess it was her Sunday corset. She was
not fat, but solid, and she chose protective garments that drew up her
bosom to giddy heights, pinched in her waist, flared out her rear, and
managed to suggest that Aunt Alexandra’s was once an hour-glass figure.
From any angle, it was formidable.</p>
<p>The remainder of the afternoon went by in the gentle gloom that
descends when relatives appear, but was dispelled when we heard a car
turn in the driveway. It was Atticus, home from Montgomery. Jem,
forgetting his dignity, ran with me to meet him. Jem seized his
briefcase and bag, I jumped into his arms, felt his vague dry kiss and
said, “’d you bring me a book? ’d you know Aunty’s here?”</p>
<p>Atticus answered both questions in the affirmative. “How’d you like
for her to come live with us?”</p>
<p>I said I would like it very much, which was a lie, but one must lie
under certain circumstances and at all times when one can’t do anything
about them.</p>
<p>“We felt it was time you children needed—well, it’s like this,
Scout,” Atticus said. “Your aunt’s doing me a favor as well as you all.
I can’t stay here all day with you, and the summer’s going to be a hot
one.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” I said, not understanding a word he said. I had an idea,
however, that Aunt Alexandra’s appearance on the scene was not so much
Atticus’s doing as hers. Aunty had a way of declaring What Is Best For
The Family, and I suppose her coming to live with us was in that
category.</p>
<p>Maycomb welcomed her. Miss Maudie Atkinson baked a Lane cake so
loaded with shinny it made me tight; Miss Stephanie Crawford had long
visits with Aunt Alexandra, consisting mostly of Miss Stephanie shaking
her head and saying, “Uh, uh, uh.” Miss Rachel next door had Aunty over
for coffee in the afternoons, and Mr. Nathan Radley went so far as to
come up in the front yard and say he was glad to see her.</p>
<p>When she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, Aunt
Alexandra seemed as if she had always lived with us. Her Missionary
Society refreshments added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not
permit Calpurnia to make the delicacies required to sustain the Society
through long reports on Rice Christians); she joined and became
Secretary of the Maycomb Amanuensis Club. To all parties present and
participating in the life of the county, Aunt Alexandra was one of the
last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any
moral come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective
case; she was an incurable gossip. When Aunt Alexandra went to school,
self-doubt could not be found in any textbook, so she knew not its
meaning. She was never bored, and given the slightest chance she would
exercise her royal prerogative: she would arrange, advise, caution, and
warn.</p>
<p>She never let a chance escape her to point out the shortcomings of
other tribal groups to the greater glory of our own, a habit that amused
Jem rather than annoyed him: “Aunty better watch how she talks—scratch
most folks in Maycomb and they’re kin to us.”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra, in underlining the moral of young Sam Merriweather’s
suicide, said it was caused by a morbid streak in the family. Let a
sixteen-year-old girl giggle in the choir and Aunty would say, “It just
goes to show you, all the Penfield women are flighty.” Everybody in
Maycomb, it seemed, had a Streak: a Drinking Streak, a Gambling Streak,
a Mean Streak, a Funny Streak.</p>
<p>Once, when Aunty assured us that Miss Stephanie Crawford’s tendency
to mind other people’s business was hereditary, Atticus said, “Sister,
when you stop to think about it, our generation’s practically the first
in the Finch family not to marry its cousins. Would you say the Finches
have an Incestuous Streak?”</p>
<p>Aunty said no, that’s where we got our small hands and feet.</p>
<p>I never understood her preoccupation with heredity. Somewhere, I had
received the impression that Fine Folks were people who did the best
they could with the sense they had, but Aunt Alexandra was of the
opinion, obliquely expressed, that the longer a family had been
squatting on one patch of land the finer it was.</p>
<p>“That makes the Ewells fine folks, then,” said Jem. The tribe of
which Burris Ewell and his brethren consisted had lived on the same plot
of earth behind the Maycomb dump, and had thrived on county welfare
money for three generations.</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra’s theory had something behind it, though. Maycomb was
an ancient town. It was twenty miles east of Finch’s Landing, awkwardly
inland for such an old town. But Maycomb would have been closer to the
river had it not been for the nimble-wittedness of one Sinkfield, who in
the dawn of history operated an inn where two pig-trails met, the only
tavern in the territory. Sinkfield, no patriot, served and supplied
ammunition to Indians and settlers alike, neither knowing or caring
whether he was a part of the Alabama Territory or the Creek Nation so
long as business was good. Business was excellent when Governor William
Wyatt Bibb, with a view to promoting the newly created county’s domestic
tranquility, dispatched a team of surveyors to locate its exact center
and there establish its seat of government. The surveyors, Sinkfield’s
guests, told their host that he was in the territorial confines of
Maycomb County, and showed him the probable spot where the county seat
would be built. Had not Sinkfield made a bold stroke to preserve his
holdings, Maycomb would have sat in the middle of Winston Swamp, a place
totally devoid of interest. Instead, Maycomb grew and sprawled out from
its hub, Sinkfield’s Tavern, because Sinkfield reduced his guests to
myopic drunkenness one evening, induced them to bring forward their maps
and charts, lop off a little here, add a bit there, and adjust the
center of the county to meet his requirements. He sent them packing next
day armed with their charts and five quarts of shinny in their
saddlebags—two apiece and one for the Governor.</p>
<p>Because its primary reason for existence was government, Maycomb was
spared the grubbiness that distinguished most Alabama towns its size. In
the beginning its buildings were solid, its courthouse proud, its
streets graciously wide. Maycomb’s proportion of professional people ran
high: one went there to have his teeth pulled, his wagon fixed, his
heart listened to, his money deposited, his soul saved, his mules
vetted. But the ultimate wisdom of Sinkfield’s maneuver is open to
question. He placed the young town too far away from the only kind of
public transportation in those days—river-boat—and it took a man from
the north end of the county two days to travel to Maycomb for
store-bought goods. As a result the town remained the same size for a
hundred years, an island in a patchwork sea of cottonfields and
timberland.</p>
<p>Although Maycomb was ignored during the War Between the States,
Reconstruction rule and economic ruin forced the town to grow. It grew
inward. New people so rarely settled there, the same families married
the same families until the members of the community looked faintly
alike. Occasionally someone would return from Montgomery or Mobile with
an outsider, but the result caused only a ripple in the quiet stream of
family resemblance. Things were more or less the same during my early
years.</p>
<p>There was indeed a caste system in Maycomb, but to my mind it worked
this way: the older citizens, the present generation of people who had
lived side by side for years and years, were utterly predictable to one
another: they took for granted attitudes, character shadings, even
gestures, as having been repeated in each generation and refined by
time. Thus the dicta No Crawford Minds His Own Business, Every Third
Merriweather Is Morbid, The Truth Is Not in the Delafields, All the
Bufords Walk Like That, were simply guides to daily living: never take a
check from a Delafield without a discreet call to the bank; Miss Maudie
Atkinson’s shoulder stoops because she was a Buford; if Mrs. Grace
Merriweather sips gin out of Lydia E. Pinkham bottles it’s nothing
unusual—her mother did the same.</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra fitted into the world of Maycomb like a hand into a
glove, but never into the world of Jem and me. I so often wondered how
she could be Atticus’s and Uncle Jack’s sister that I revived
half-remembered tales of changelings and mandrake roots that Jem had
spun long ago.</p>
<p>These were abstract speculations for the first month of her stay, as
she had little to say to Jem or me, and we saw her only at mealtimes and
at night before we went to bed. It was summer and we were outdoors. Of
course some afternoons when I would run inside for a drink of water, I
would find the livingroom overrun with Maycomb ladies, sipping,
whispering, fanning, and I would be called: “Jean Louise, come speak to
these ladies.”</p>
<p>When I appeared in the doorway, Aunty would look as if she regretted
her request; I was usually mud-splashed or covered with sand.</p>
<p>“Speak to your Cousin Lily,” she said one afternoon, when she had
trapped me in the hall.</p>
<p>“Who?” I said.</p>
<p>“Your Cousin Lily Brooke,” said Aunt Alexandra.</p>
<p>“She our cousin? I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra managed to smile in a way that conveyed a gentle
apology to Cousin Lily and firm disapproval to me. When Cousin Lily
Brooke left I knew I was in for it.</p>
<p>It was a sad thing that my father had neglected to tell me about the
Finch Family, or to install any pride into his children. She summoned
Jem, who sat warily on the sofa beside me. She left the room and
returned with a purple-covered book on which Meditations of Joshua S.
St. Clair was stamped in gold.</p>
<p>“Your cousin wrote this,” said Aunt Alexandra. “He was a beautiful
character.”</p>
<p>Jem examined the small volume. “Is this the Cousin Joshua who was
locked up for so long?”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra said, “How did you know that?”</p>
<p>“Why, Atticus said he went round the bend at the University. Said he
tried to shoot the president. Said Cousin Joshua said he wasn’t anything
but a sewer-inspector and tried to shoot him with an old flintlock
pistol, only it just blew up in his hand. Atticus said it cost the
family five hundred dollars to get him out of that one—”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra was standing stiff as a stork. “That’s all,” she said.
“We’ll see about this.”</p>
<p>Before bedtime I was in Jem’s room trying to borrow a book, when
Atticus knocked and entered. He sat on the side of Jem’s bed, looked at
us soberly, then he grinned.</p>
<p>“Er—h’rm,“ he said. He was beginning to preface some things he said
with a throaty noise, and I thought he must at last be getting old, but
he looked the same.”I don’t exactly know how to say this,“ he began.</p>
<p>“Well, just say it,” said Jem. “Have we done something?”</p>
<p>Our father was actually fidgeting. “No, I just want to explain to you
that—your Aunt Alexandra asked me… son, you know you’re a Finch, don’t
you?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’ve been told.” Jem looked out of the corners of his
eyes. His voice rose uncontrollably, “Atticus, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>Atticus crossed his knees and folded his arms. “I’m trying to tell
you the facts of life.”</p>
<p>Jem’s disgust deepened. “I know all that stuff,” he said.</p>
<p>Atticus suddenly grew serious. In his lawyer’s voice, without a shade
of inflection, he said: “Your aunt has asked me to try and impress upon
you and Jean Louise that you are not from run-of-the-mill people, that
you are the product of several generations’ gentle breeding—” Atticus
paused, watching me locate an elusive redbug on my leg.</p>
<p>“Gentle breeding,” he continued, when I had found and scratched it,
“and that you should try to live up to your name—” Atticus persevered in
spite of us: “She asked me to tell you you must try to behave like the
little lady and gentleman that you are. She wants to talk to you about
the family and what it’s meant to Maycomb County through the years, so
you’ll have some idea of who you are, so you might be moved to behave
accordingly,” he concluded at a gallop.</p>
<p>Stunned, Jem and I looked at each other, then at Atticus, whose
collar seemed to worry him. We did not speak to him.</p>
<p>Presently I picked up a comb from Jem’s dresser and ran its teeth
along the edge.</p>
<p>“Stop that noise,” Atticus said.</p>
<p>His curtness stung me. The comb was midway in its journey, and I
banged it down. For no reason I felt myself beginning to cry, but I
could not stop. This was not my father. My father never thought these
thoughts. My father never spoke so. Aunt Alexandra had put him up to
this, somehow. Through my tears I saw Jem standing in a similar pool of
isolation, his head cocked to one side.</p>
<p>There was nowhere to go, but I turned to go and met Atticus’s vest
front. I buried my head in it and listened to the small internal noises
that went on behind the light blue cloth: his watch ticking, the faint
crackle of his starched shirt, the soft sound of his breathing.</p>
<p>“Your stomach’s growling,” I said.</p>
<p>“I know it,” he said.</p>
<p>“You better take some soda.”</p>
<p>“I will,” he said.</p>
<p>“Atticus, is all this behavin‘ an’ stuff gonna make things different?
I mean are you—?”</p>
<p>I felt his hand on the back of my head. “Don’t you worry about
anything,” he said. “It’s not time to worry.” When I heard that, I knew
he had come back to us. The blood in my legs began to flow again, and I
raised my head. “You really want us to do all that? I can’t remember
everything Finches are supposed to do…”</p>
<p>“I don’t want you to remember it. Forget it.”</p>
<p>He went to the door and out of the room, shutting the door behind
him. He nearly slammed it, but caught himself at the last minute and
closed it softly. As Jem and I stared, the door opened again and Atticus
peered around. His eyebrows were raised, his glasses had slipped. “Get
more like Cousin Joshua every day, don’t I? Do you think I’ll end up
costing the family five hundred dollars?”</p>
<p>I know now what he was trying to do, but Atticus was only a man. It
takes a woman to do that kind of work.</p>
