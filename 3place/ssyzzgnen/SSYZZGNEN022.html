<h4 id="chapter-21">Chapter 21</h4>
<p>She stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get Judge Taylor’s
attention. She was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her
hand.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor saw her and said, “It’s Calpurnia, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she said. “Could I just pass this note to Mr. Finch,
please sir? It hasn’t got anything to do with—with the trial.”</p>
<p>Judge Taylor nodded and Atticus took the envelope from Calpurnia. He
opened it, read its contents and said, “Judge, I—this note is from my
sister. She says my children are missing, haven’t turned up since noon…
I… could you—”</p>
<p>“I know where they are, Atticus.” Mr. Underwood spoke up. “They’re
right up yonder in the colored balcony—been there since precisely
one-eighteen P.M.”</p>
<p>Our father turned around and looked up. “Jem, come down from there,”
he called. Then he said something to the Judge we didn’t hear. We
climbed across Reverend Sykes and made our way to the staircase.</p>
<p>Atticus and Calpurnia met us downstairs. Calpurnia looked peeved, but
Atticus looked exhausted.</p>
<p>Jem was jumping in excitement. “We’ve won, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“I’ve no idea,” said Atticus shortly. “You’ve been here all
afternoon? Go home with Calpurnia and get your supper—and stay
home.”</p>
<p>“Aw, Atticus, let us come back,” pleaded Jem. “Please let us hear the
verdict, please sir.”</p>
<p>“The jury might be out and back in a minute, we don’t know—” but we
could tell Atticus was relenting. “Well, you’ve heard it all, so you
might as well hear the rest. Tell you what, you all can come back when
you’ve eaten your supper—eat slowly, now, you won’t miss anything
important—and if the jury’s still out, you can wait with us. But I
expect it’ll be over before you get back.”</p>
<p>“You think they’ll acquit him that fast?” asked Jem.</p>
<p>Atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us.</p>
<p>I prayed that Reverend Sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped
praying when I remembered that people got up and left in droves when the
jury was out—tonight, they’d overrun the drugstore, the O.K. Café and
the hotel, that is, unless they had brought their suppers too.</p>
<p>Calpurnia marched us home: “—skin every one of you alive, the very
idea, you children listenin‘ to all that! Mister Jem, don’t you know
better’n to take your little sister to that trial? Miss Alexandra’ll
absolutely have a stroke of paralysis when she finds out! Ain’t fittin’
for children to hear…”</p>
<p>The streetlights were on, and we glimpsed Calpurnia’s indignant
profile as we passed beneath them. “Mister Jem, I thought you was
gettin‘ some kinda head on your shoulders—the very idea, she’s your
little sister! The very idea, sir! You oughta be perfectly ashamed of
yourself—ain’t you got any sense at all?”</p>
<p>I was exhilarated. So many things had happened so fast I felt it
would take years to sort them out, and now here was Calpurnia giving her
precious Jem down the country—what new marvels would the evening
bring?</p>
<p>Jem was chuckling. “Don’t you want to hear about it, Cal?”</p>
<p>“Hush your mouth, sir! When you oughta be hangin‘ your head in shame
you go along laughin’—” Calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that
moved Jem to little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her
classic, “If Mr. Finch don’t wear you out, I will—get in that house,
sir!”</p>
<p>Jem went in grinning, and Calpurnia nodded tacit consent to having
Dill in to supper. “You all call Miss Rachel right now and tell her
where you are,” she told him. “She’s run distracted lookin‘ for you—you
watch out she don’t ship you back to Meridian first thing in the
mornin’.”</p>
<p>Aunt Alexandra met us and nearly fainted when Calpurnia told her
where we were. I guess it hurt her when we told her Atticus said we
could go back, because she didn’t say a word during supper. She just
rearranged food on her plate, looking at it sadly while Calpurnia served
Jem, Dill and me with a vengeance. Calpurnia poured milk, dished out
potato salad and ham, muttering, “’shamed of yourselves,” in varying
degrees of intensity. “Now you all eat slow,” was her final command.</p>
<p>Reverend Sykes had saved our places. We were surprised to find that
we had been gone nearly an hour, and were equally surprised to find the
courtroom exactly as we had left it, with minor changes: the jury box
was empty, the defendant was gone; Judge Taylor had been gone, but he
reappeared as we were seating ourselves.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s moved, hardly,” said Jem.</p>
<p>“They moved around some when the jury went out,” said Reverend Sykes.
“The menfolk down there got the womenfolk their suppers, and they fed
their babies.”</p>
<p>“How long have they been out?” asked Jem.</p>
<p>“‘bout thirty minutes. Mr. Finch and Mr. Gilmer did some more
talkin’, and Judge Taylor charged the jury.”</p>
<p>“How was he?” asked Jem.</p>
<p>“What say? Oh, he did right well. I ain’t complainin‘ one bit—he was
mighty fair-minded. He sorta said if you believe this, then you’ll have
to return one verdict, but if you believe this, you’ll have to return
another one. I thought he was leanin’ a little to our side—” Reverend
Sykes scratched his head.</p>
<p>Jem smiled. “He’s not supposed to lean, Reverend, but don’t fret,
we’ve won it,” he said wisely. “Don’t see how any jury could convict on
what we heard—”</p>
<p>“Now don’t you be so confident, Mr. Jem, I ain’t ever seen any jury
decide in favor of a colored man over a white man…” But Jem took
exception to Reverend Sykes, and we were subjected to a lengthy review
of the evidence with Jem’s ideas on the law regarding rape: it wasn’t
rape if she let you, but she had to be eighteen—in Alabama, that is—and
Mayella was nineteen. Apparently you had to kick and holler, you had to
be overpowered and stomped on, preferably knocked stone cold. If you
were under eighteen, you didn’t have to go through all this.</p>
<p>“Mr. Jem,” Reverend Sykes demurred, “this ain’t a polite thing for
little ladies to hear…”</p>
<p>“Aw, she doesn’t know what we’re talkin‘ about,” said Jem. “Scout,
this is too old for you, ain’t it?”</p>
<p>“It most certainly is not, I know every word you’re saying.” Perhaps
I was too convincing, because Jem hushed and never discussed the subject
again.</p>
<p>“What time is it, Reverend?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Gettin‘ on toward eight.”</p>
<p>I looked down and saw Atticus strolling around with his hands in his
pockets: he made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over
to the jury box. He looked in it, inspected Judge Taylor on his throne,
then went back to where he started. I caught his eye and waved to him.
He acknowledged my salute with a nod, and resumed his tour.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilmer was standing at the windows talking to Mr. Underwood.
Bert, the court reporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet
on the table.</p>
<p>But the officers of the court, the ones present—Atticus, Mr. Gilmer,
Judge Taylor sound asleep, and Bert, were the only ones whose behavior
seemed normal. I had never seen a packed courtroom so still. Sometimes a
baby would cry out fretfully, and a child would scurry out, but the
grown people sat as if they were in church. In the balcony, the Negroes
sat and stood around us with biblical patience.</p>
<p>The old courthouse clock suffered its preliminary strain and struck
the hour, eight deafening bongs that shook our bones.</p>
<p>When it bonged eleven times I was past feeling: tired from fighting
sleep, I allowed myself a short nap against Reverend Sykes’s comfortable
arm and shoulder. I jerked awake and made an honest effort to remain so,
by looking down and concentrating on the heads below: there were sixteen
bald ones, fourteen men that could pass for redheads, forty heads
varying between brown and black, and—I remembered something Jem had once
explained to me when he went through a brief period of psychical
research: he said if enough people—a stadium full, maybe—were to
concentrate on one thing, such as setting a tree afire in the woods,
that the tree would ignite of its own accord. I toyed with the idea of
asking everyone below to concentrate on setting Tom Robinson free, but
thought if they were as tired as I, it wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>Dill was sound asleep, his head on Jem’s shoulder, and Jem was
quiet.</p>
<p>“Ain’t it a long time?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Sure is, Scout,” he said happily.</p>
<p>“Well, from the way you put it, it’d just take five minutes.”</p>
<p>Jem raised his eyebrows. “There are things you don’t understand,” he
said, and I was too weary to argue.</p>
<p>But I must have been reasonably awake, or I would not have received
the impression that was creeping into me. It was not unlike one I had
last winter, and I shivered, though the night was hot. The feeling grew
until the atmosphere in the courtroom was exactly the same as a cold
February morning, when the mockingbirds were still, and the carpenters
had stopped hammering on Miss Maudie’s new house, and every wood door in
the neighborhood was shut as tight as the doors of the Radley Place. A
deserted, waiting, empty street, and the courtroom was packed with
people. A steaming summer night was no different from a winter morning.
Mr. Heck Tate, who had entered the courtroom and was talking to Atticus,
might have been wearing his high boots and lumber jacket. Atticus had
stopped his tranquil journey and had put his foot onto the bottom rung
of a chair; as he listened to what Mr. Tate was saying, he ran his hand
slowly up and down his thigh. I expected Mr. Tate to say any minute,
“Take him, Mr. Finch…”</p>
<p>But Mr. Tate said, “This court will come to order,” in a voice that
rang with authority, and the heads below us jerked up. Mr. Tate left the
room and returned with Tom Robinson. He steered Tom to his place beside
Atticus, and stood there. Judge Taylor had roused himself to sudden
alertness and was sitting up straight, looking at the empty jury
box.</p>
<p>What happened after that had a dreamlike quality: in a dream I saw
the jury return, moving like underwater swimmers, and Judge Taylor’s
voice came from far away and was tiny. I saw something only a lawyer’s
child could be expected to see, could be expected to watch for, and it
was like watching Atticus walk into the street, raise a rifle to his
shoulder and pull the trigger, but watching all the time knowing that
the gun was empty.</p>
<p>A jury never looks at a defendant it has convicted, and when this
jury came in, not one of them looked at Tom Robinson. The foreman handed
a piece of paper to Mr. Tate who handed it to the clerk who handed it to
the judge…</p>
<p>I shut my eyes. Judge Taylor was polling the jury: “Guilty… guilty…
guilty… guilty…” I peeked at Jem: his hands were white from gripping the
balcony rail, and his shoulders jerked as if each “guilty” was a
separate stab between them.</p>
<p>Judge Taylor was saying something. His gavel was in his fist, but he
wasn’t using it. Dimly, I saw Atticus pushing papers from the table into
his briefcase. He snapped it shut, went to the court reporter and said
something, nodded to Mr. Gilmer, and then went to Tom Robinson and
whispered something to him. Atticus put his hand on Tom’s shoulder as he
whispered. Atticus took his coat off the back of his chair and pulled it
over his shoulder. Then he left the courtroom, but not by his usual
exit. He must have wanted to go home the short way, because he walked
quickly down the middle aisle toward the south exit. I followed the top
of his head as he made his way to the door. He did not look up.</p>
<p>Someone was punching me, but I was reluctant to take my eyes from the
people below us, and from the image of Atticus’s lonely walk down the
aisle.</p>
<p>“Miss Jean Louise?”</p>
<p>I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony
on the opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend
Sykes’s voice was as distant as Judge Taylor’s:</p>
<p>“Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father’s passin‘.”</p>
