<h4 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h4>
<p>When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern
neighborhood, but when I was well into the second grade at school and
tormenting Boo Radley became passe, the business section of Maycomb drew
us frequently up the street past the real property of Mrs. Henry
Lafayette Dubose. It was impossible to go to town without passing her
house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way. Previous minor
encounters with her left me with no desire for more, but Jem said I had
to grow up some time.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant
attendance, two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front
steps and a dog-trot hall. She was very old; she spent most of each day
in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It was rumored that she kept
a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps.</p>
<p>Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would
be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation
regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy prediction on what we
would amount to when we grew up, which was always nothing. We had long
ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of
the street; that only made her raise her voice and let the whole
neighborhood in on it.</p>
<p>We could do nothing to please her. If I said as sunnily as I could,
“Hey, Mrs. Dubose,” I would receive for an answer, “Don’t you say hey to
me, you ugly girl! You say good afternoon, Mrs. Dubose!”</p>
<p>She was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as “Atticus”
and her reaction was apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most
disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way, we were told that it was
quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother’s death. A
lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it was
heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild. I did not
remember our mother, but Jem did—he would tell me about her
sometimes—and he went livid when Mrs. Dubose shot us this message.</p>
<p>Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had
concluded that it was cowardly to stop at Miss Rachel’s front steps and
wait, and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner
each evening to meet Atticus coming from work. Countless evenings
Atticus would find Jem furious at something Mrs. Dubose had said when we
went by.</p>
<p>“Easy does it, son,” Atticus would say. “She’s an old lady and she’s
ill. You just hold your head high and be a gentleman. Whatever she says
to you, it’s your job not to let her make you mad.” Jem would say she
must not be very sick, she hollered so. When the three of us came to her
house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to her and say,
“Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture this evening.”</p>
<p>I never heard Atticus say like a picture of what. He would tell her
the courthouse news, and would say he hoped with all his heart she’d
have a good day tomorrow. He would return his hat to his head, swing me
to his shoulders in her very presence, and we would go home in the
twilight. It was times like these when I thought my father, who hated
guns and had never been to any wars, was the bravest man who ever
lived.</p>
<p>The day after Jem’s twelfth birthday his money was burning up his
pockets, so we headed for town in the early afternoon. Jem thought he
had enough to buy a miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling
baton for me.</p>
<p>I had long had my eye on that baton: it was at V. J. Elmore’s, it was
bedecked with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then
my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the Maycomb County High
School band. Having developed my talent to where I could throw up a
stick and almost catch it coming down, I had caused Calpurnia to deny me
entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand. I
felt that I could overcome this defect with a real baton, and I thought
it generous of Jem to buy one for me.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.</p>
<p>“Where are you two going at this time of day?” she shouted. “Playing
hooky, I suppose. I’ll just call up the principal and tell him!” She put
her hands on the wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right
face.</p>
<p>“Aw, it’s Saturday, Mrs. Dubose,” said Jem.</p>
<p>“Makes no difference if it’s Saturday,” she said obscurely. “I wonder
if your father knows where you are?”</p>
<p>“Mrs. Dubose, we’ve been goin‘ to town by ourselves since we were
this high.” Jem placed his hand palm down about two feet above the
sidewalk.</p>
<p>“Don’t you lie to me!” she yelled. “Jeremy Finch, Maudie Atkinson
told me you broke down her scuppernong arbor this morning. She’s going
to tell your father and then you’ll wish you never saw the light of day!
If you aren’t sent to the reform school before next week, my name’s not
Dubose!”</p>
<p>Jem, who hadn’t been near Miss Maudie’s scuppernong arbor since last
summer, and who knew Miss Maudie wouldn’t tell Atticus if he had, issued
a general denial.</p>
<p>“Don’t you contradict me!” Mrs. Dubose bawled. “And you—” she pointed
an arthritic finger at me—“what are you doing in those overalls? You
should be in a dress and camisole, young lady! You’ll grow up waiting on
tables if somebody doesn’t change your ways—a Finch waiting on tables at
the O.K. Café—hah!”</p>
<p>I was terrified. The O.K. Café was a dim organization on the north
side of the square. I grabbed Jem’s hand but he shook me loose.</p>
<p>“Come on, Scout,” he whispered. “Don’t pay any attention to her, just
hold your head high and be a gentleman.”</p>
<p>But Mrs. Dubose held us: “Not only a Finch waiting on tables but one
in the courthouse lawing for niggers!”</p>
<p>Jem stiffened. Mrs. Dubose’s shot had gone home and she knew it:</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against
his raising? I’ll tell you!” She put her hand to her mouth. When she
drew it away, it trailed a long silver thread of saliva. “Your father’s
no better than the niggers and trash he works for!”</p>
<p>Jem was scarlet. I pulled at his sleeve, and we were followed up the
sidewalk by a philippic on our family’s moral degeneration, the major
premise of which was that half the Finches were in the asylum anyway,
but if our mother were living we would not have come to such a
state.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at
Mrs. Dubose’s assessment of the family’s mental hygiene. I had become
almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the
first one coming from an adult. Except for her remarks about Atticus,
Mrs. Dubose’s attack was only routine. There was a hint of summer in the
air—in the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm, which meant good
times coming: no school and Dill.</p>
<p>Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmore’s for my baton. Jem
took no pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and
walked silently beside me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit
Mr. Link Deas, who said, “Look out now, Scout!” when I missed a toss,
and when we approached Mrs. Dubose’s house my baton was grimy from
having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.</p>
<p>She was not on the porch.</p>
<p>In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it,
what made him break the bonds of “You just be a gentleman, son,” and the
phase of self-conscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had
probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I,
and I took it for granted that he kept his temper—he had a naturally
tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought
the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he
simply went mad.</p>
<p>What Jem did was something I’d do as a matter of course had I not
been under Atticus’s interdict, which I assumed included not fighting
horrible old ladies. We had just come to her gate when Jem snatched my
baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into Mrs. Dubose’s front
yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said, forgetting that she packed
a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her
girl Jessie probably wouldn’t.</p>
<p>He did not begin to calm down until he had cut the tops off every
camellia bush Mrs. Dubose owned, until the ground was littered with
green buds and leaves. He bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in
two and threw it down.</p>
<p>By that time I was shrieking. Jem yanked my hair, said he didn’t
care, he’d do it again if he got a chance, and if I didn’t shut up he’d
pull every hair out of my head. I didn’t shut up and he kicked me. I
lost my balance and fell on my face. Jem picked me up roughly but looked
like he was sorry. There was nothing to say.</p>
<p>We did not choose to meet Atticus coming home that evening. We
skulked around the kitchen until Calpurnia threw us out. By some voo-doo
system Calpurnia seemed to know all about it. She was a less than
satisfactory source of palliation, but she did give Jem a hot
biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and shared with me. It tasted
like cotton.</p>
<p>We went to the livingroom. I picked up a football magazine, found a
picture of Dixie Howell, showed it to Jem and said, “This looks like
you.” That was the nicest thing I could think to say to him, but it was
no help. He sat by the windows, hunched down in a rocking chair,
scowling, waiting. Daylight faded.</p>
<p>Two geological ages later, we heard the soles of Atticus’s shoes
scrape the front steps. The screen door slammed, there was a
pause—Atticus was at the hat rack in the hall—and we heard him call,
“Jem!” His voice was like the winter wind.</p>
<p>Atticus switched on the ceiling light in the livingroom and found us
there, frozen still. He carried my baton in one hand; its filthy yellow
tassel trailed on the rug. He held out his other hand; it contained fat
camellia buds.</p>
<p>“Jem,” he said, “are you responsible for this?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>“Why’d you do it?”</p>
<p>Jem said softly, “She said you lawed for niggers and trash.”</p>
<p>“You did this because she said that?”</p>
<p>Jem’s lips moved, but his, “Yes sir,” was inaudible.</p>
<p>“Son, I have no doubt that you’ve been annoyed by your contemporaries
about me lawing for niggers, as you say, but to do something like this
to a sick old lady is inexcusable. I strongly advise you to go down and
have a talk with Mrs. Dubose,” said Atticus. “Come straight home
afterward.”</p>
<p>Jem did not move.</p>
<p>“Go on, I said.”</p>
<p>I followed Jem out of the livingroom. “Come back here,” Atticus said
to me. I came back.</p>
<p>Atticus picked up the Mobile Press and sat down in the rocking chair
Jem had vacated. For the life of me, I did not understand how he could
sit there in cold blood and read a newspaper when his only son stood an
excellent chance of being murdered with a Confederate Army relic. Of
course Jem antagonized me sometimes until I could kill him, but when it
came down to it he was all I had. Atticus did not seem to realize this,
or if he did he didn’t care.</p>
<p>I hated him for that, but when you are in trouble you become easily
tired: soon I was hiding in his lap and his arms were around me.</p>
<p>“You’re mighty big to be rocked,” he said.</p>
<p>“You don’t care what happens to him,” I said. “You just send him on
to get shot at when all he was doin‘ was standin’ up for you.”</p>
<p>Atticus pushed my head under his chin. “It’s not time to worry yet,”
he said. “I never thought Jem’d be the one to lose his head over
this—thought I’d have more trouble with you.”</p>
<p>I said I didn’t see why we had to keep our heads anyway, that nobody
I knew at school had to keep his head about anything.</p>
<p>“Scout,” said Atticus, “when summer comes you’ll have to keep your
head about far worse things… it’s not fair for you and Jem, I know that,
but sometimes we have to make the best of things, and the way we conduct
ourselves when the chips are down—well, all I can say is, when you and
Jem are grown, maybe you’ll look back on this with some compassion and
some feeling that I didn’t let you down. This case, Tom Robinson’s case,
is something that goes to the essence of a man’s conscience—Scout, I
couldn’t go to church and worship God if I didn’t try to help that
man.”</p>
<p>“Atticus, you must be wrong…”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“Well, most folks seem to think they’re right and you’re wrong…”</p>
<p>“They’re certainly entitled to think that, and they’re entitled to
full respect for their opinions,” said Atticus, “but before I can live
with other folks I’ve got to live with myself. The one thing that
doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.”</p>
<p>When Jem returned, he found me still in Atticus’s lap, “Well, son?”
said Atticus. He set me on my feet, and I made a secret reconnaissance
of Jem. He seemed to be all in one piece, but he had a queer look on his
face. Perhaps she had given him a dose of calomel.</p>
<p>“I cleaned it up for her and said I was sorry, but I ain’t, and that
I’d work on ’em ever Saturday and try to make ’em grow back out.”</p>
<p>“There was no point in saying you were sorry if you aren’t,” said
Atticus. “Jem, she’s old and ill. You can’t hold her responsible for
what she says and does. Of course, I’d rather she’d have said it to me
than to either of you, but we can’t always have our ’druthers.”</p>
<p>Jem seemed fascinated by a rose in the carpet. “Atticus,” he said,
“she wants me to read to her.”</p>
<p>“Read to her?”</p>
<p>“Yes sir. She wants me to come every afternoon after school and
Saturdays and read to her out loud for two hours. Atticus, do I have
to?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>“But she wants me to do it for a month.”</p>
<p>“Then you’ll do it for a month.”</p>
<p>Jem planted his big toe delicately in the center of the rose and
pressed it in. Finally he said, “Atticus, it’s all right on the sidewalk
but inside it’s—it’s all dark and creepy. There’s shadows and things on
the ceiling…”</p>
<p>Atticus smiled grimly. “That should appeal to your imagination. Just
pretend you’re inside the Radley house.”</p>
<p>The following Monday afternoon Jem and I climbed the steep front
steps to Mrs. Dubose’s house and padded down the open hallway. Jem,
armed with Ivanhoe and full of superior knowledge, knocked at the second
door on the left.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Dubose?” he called.</p>
<p>Jessie opened the wood door and unlatched the screen door.</p>
<p>“Is that you, Jem Finch?” she said. “You got your sister with you. I
don’t know—”</p>
<p>“Let ’em both in, Jessie,” said Mrs. Dubose. Jessie admitted us and
went off to the kitchen.</p>
<p>An oppressive odor met us when we crossed the threshold, an odor I
had met many times in rain-rotted gray houses where there are coal-oil
lamps, water dippers, and unbleached domestic sheets. It always made me
afraid, expectant, watchful.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room was a brass bed, and in the bed was
Mrs. Dubose. I wondered if Jem’s activities had put her there, and for a
moment I felt sorry for her. She was lying under a pile of quilts and
looked almost friendly.</p>
<p>There was a marble-topped washstand by her bed; on it were a glass
with a teaspoon in it, a red ear syringe, a box of absorbent cotton, and
a steel alarm clock standing on three tiny legs.</p>
<p>“So you brought that dirty little sister of yours, did you?” was her
greeting.</p>
<p>Jem said quietly, “My sister ain’t dirty and I ain’t scared of you,”
although I noticed his knees shaking.</p>
<p>I was expecting a tirade, but all she said was, “You may commence
reading, Jeremy.”</p>
<p>Jem sat down in a cane-bottom chair and opened Ivanhoe. I pulled up
another one and sat beside him.</p>
<p>“Come closer,” said Mrs. Dubose. “Come to the side of the bed.”</p>
<p>We moved our chairs forward. This was the nearest I had ever been to
her, and the thing I wanted most to do was move my chair back again.</p>
<p>She was horrible. Her face was the color of a dirty pillowcase, and
the corners of her mouth glistened with wet, which inched like a glacier
down the deep grooves enclosing her chin. Old-age liver spots dotted her
cheeks, and her pale eyes had black pinpoint pupils. Her hands were
knobby, and the cuticles were grown up over her fingernails. Her bottom
plate was not in, and her upper lip protruded; from time to time she
would draw her nether lip to her upper plate and carry her chin with it.
This made the wet move faster.</p>
<p>I didn’t look any more than I had to. Jem reopened Ivanhoe and began
reading. I tried to keep up with him, but he read too fast. When Jem
came to a word he didn’t know, he skipped it, but Mrs. Dubose would
catch him and make him spell it out. Jem read for perhaps twenty
minutes, during which time I looked at the soot-stained mantelpiece, out
the window, anywhere to keep from looking at her. As he read along, I
noticed that Mrs. Dubose’s corrections grew fewer and farther between,
that Jem had even left one sentence dangling in mid-air. She was not
listening.</p>
<p>I looked toward the bed.</p>
<p>Something had happened to her. She lay on her back, with the quilts
up to her chin. Only her head and shoulders were visible. Her head moved
slowly from side to side. From time to time she would open her mouth
wide, and I could see her tongue undulate faintly. Cords of saliva would
collect on her lips; she would draw them in, then open her mouth again.
Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It worked
separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at
low tide. Occasionally it would say, “Pt,” like some viscous substance
coming to a boil.</p>
<p>I pulled Jem’s sleeve.</p>
<p>He looked at me, then at the bed. Her head made its regular sweep
toward us, and Jem said, “Mrs. Dubose, are you all right?” She did not
hear him.</p>
<p>The alarm clock went off and scared us stiff. A minute later, nerves
still tingling, Jem and I were on the sidewalk headed for home. We did
not run away, Jessie sent us: before the clock wound down she was in the
room pushing Jem and me out of it.</p>
<p>“Shoo,” she said, “you all go home.”</p>
<p>Jem hesitated at the door.</p>
<p>“It’s time for her medicine,” Jessie said. As the door swung shut
behind us I saw Jessie walking quickly toward Mrs. Dubose’s bed.</p>
<p>It was only three forty-five when we got home, so Jem and I
drop-kicked in the back yard until it was time to meet Atticus. Atticus
had two yellow pencils for me and a football magazine for Jem, which I
suppose was a silent reward for our first day’s session with
Mrs. Dubose. Jem told him what happened.</p>
<p>“Did she frighten you?” asked Atticus.</p>
<p>“No sir,” said Jem, “but she’s so nasty. She has fits or somethin‘.
She spits a lot.”</p>
<p>“She can’t help that. When people are sick they don’t look nice
sometimes.”</p>
<p>“She scared me,” I said.</p>
<p>Atticus looked at me over his glasses. “You don’t have to go with
Jem, you know.”</p>
<p>The next afternoon at Mrs. Dubose’s was the same as the first, and so
was the next, until gradually a pattern emerged: everything would begin
normally—that is, Mrs. Dubose would hound Jem for a while on her
favorite subjects, her camellias and our father’s nigger-loving
propensities; she would grow increasingly silent, then go away from us.
The alarm clock would ring, Jessie would shoo us out, and the rest of
the day was ours.</p>
<p>“Atticus,” I said one evening, “what exactly is a nigger-lover?”</p>
<p>Atticus’s face was grave. “Has somebody been calling you that?”</p>
<p>“No sir, Mrs. Dubose calls you that. She warms up every afternoon
calling you that. Francis called me that last Christmas, that’s where I
first heard it.”</p>
<p>“Is that the reason you jumped on him?” asked Atticus.</p>
<p>“Yes sir…”</p>
<p>“Then why are you asking me what it means?”</p>
<p>I tried to explain to Atticus that it wasn’t so much what Francis
said that had infuriated me as the way he had said it. “It was like he’d
said snot-nose or somethin‘.”</p>
<p>“Scout,” said Atticus, “nigger-lover is just one of those terms that
don’t mean anything—like snot-nose. It’s hard to explain—ignorant,
trashy people use it when they think somebody’s favoring Negroes over
and above themselves. It’s slipped into usage with some people like
ourselves, when they want a common, ugly term to label somebody.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t really a nigger-lover, then, are you?”</p>
<p>“I certainly am. I do my best to love everybody… I’m hard put,
sometimes—baby, it’s never an insult to be called what somebody thinks
is a bad name. It just shows you how poor that person is, it doesn’t
hurt you. So don’t let Mrs. Dubose get you down. She has enough troubles
of her own.”</p>
<p>One afternoon a month later Jem was ploughing his way through Sir
Walter Scout, as Jem called him, and Mrs. Dubose was correcting him at
every turn, when there was a knock on the door. “Come in!” she
screamed.</p>
<p>Atticus came in. He went to the bed and took Mrs. Dubose’s hand. “I
was coming from the office and didn’t see the children,” he said. “I
thought they might still be here.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dubose smiled at him. For the life of me I could not figure out
how she could bring herself to speak to him when she seemed to hate him
so. “Do you know what time it is, Atticus?” she said. “Exactly fourteen
minutes past five. The alarm clock’s set for five-thirty. I want you to
know that.”</p>
<p>It suddenly came to me that each day we had been staying a little
longer at Mrs. Dubose’s, that the alarm clock went off a few minutes
later every day, and that she was well into one of her fits by the time
it sounded. Today she had antagonized Jem for nearly two hours with no
intention of having a fit, and I felt hopelessly trapped. The alarm
clock was the signal for our release; if one day it did not ring, what
would we do?</p>
<p>“I have a feeling that Jem’s reading days are numbered,” said
Atticus.</p>
<p>“Only a week longer, I think,” she said, “just to make sure…”</p>
<p>Jem rose. “But—”</p>
<p>Atticus put out his hand and Jem was silent. On the way home, Jem
said he had to do it just for a month and the month was up and it wasn’t
fair.</p>
<p>“Just one more week, son,” said Atticus.</p>
<p>“No,” said Jem. “Yes,” said Atticus.</p>
<p>The following week found us back at Mrs. Dubose’s. The alarm clock
had ceased sounding, but Mrs. Dubose would release us with, “That’ll
do,” so late in the afternoon Atticus would be home reading the paper
when we returned. Although her fits had passed off, she was in every
other way her old self: when Sir Walter Scott became involved in lengthy
descriptions of moats and castles, Mrs. Dubose would become bored and
pick on us:</p>
<p>“Jeremy Finch, I told you you’d live to regret tearing up my
camellias. You regret it now, don’t you?”</p>
<p>Jem would say he certainly did.</p>
<p>“Thought you could kill my Snow-on-the-Mountain, did you? Well,
Jessie says the top’s growing back out. Next time you’ll know how to do
it right, won’t you? You’ll pull it up by the roots, won’t you?”</p>
<p>Jem would say he certainly would.</p>
<p>“Don’t you mutter at me, boy! You hold up your head and say yes
ma’am. Don’t guess you feel like holding it up, though, with your father
what he is.”</p>
<p>Jem’s chin would come up, and he would gaze at Mrs. Dubose with a
face devoid of resentment. Through the weeks he had cultivated an
expression of polite and detached interest, which he would present to
her in answer to her most blood-curdling inventions.</p>
<p>At last the day came. When Mrs. Dubose said, “That’ll do,” one
afternoon, she added, “And that’s all. Good-day to you.”</p>
<p>It was over. We bounded down the sidewalk on a spree of sheer relief,
leaping and howling.</p>
<p>That spring was a good one: the days grew longer and gave us more
playing time. Jem’s mind was occupied mostly with the vital statistics
of every college football player in the nation. Every night Atticus
would read us the sports pages of the newspapers. Alabama might go to
the Rose Bowl again this year, judging from its prospects, not one of
whose names we could pronounce. Atticus was in the middle of Windy
Seaton’s column one evening when the telephone rang.</p>
<p>He answered it, then went to the hat rack in the hall. “I’m going
down to Mrs. Dubose’s for a while,” he said. “I won’t be long.”</p>
<p>But Atticus stayed away until long past my bedtime. When he returned
he was carrying a candy box. Atticus sat down in the livingroom and put
the box on the floor beside his chair.</p>
<p>“What’d she want?” asked Jem.</p>
<p>We had not seen Mrs. Dubose for over a month. She was never on the
porch any more when we passed.</p>
<p>“She’s dead, son,” said Atticus. “She died a few minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“Oh,” said Jem. “Well.”</p>
<p>“Well is right,” said Atticus. “She’s not suffering any more. She was
sick for a long time. Son, didn’t you know what her fits were?”</p>
<p>Jem shook his head.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Dubose was a morphine addict,” said Atticus. “She took it as a
pain-killer for years. The doctor put her on it. She’d have spent the
rest of her life on it and died without so much agony, but she was too
contrary—”</p>
<p>“Sir?” said Jem.</p>
<p>Atticus said, “Just before your escapade she called me to make her
will. Dr. Reynolds told her she had only a few months left. Her business
affairs were in perfect order but she said, ‘There’s still one thing out
of order.’”</p>
<p>“What was that?” Jem was perplexed.</p>
<p>“She said she was going to leave this world beholden to nothing and
nobody. Jem, when you’re sick as she was, it’s all right to take
anything to make it easier, but it wasn’t all right for her. She said
she meant to break herself of it before she died, and that’s what she
did.”</p>
<p>Jem said, “You mean that’s what her fits were?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what they were. Most of the time you were reading to her
I doubt if she heard a word you said. Her whole mind and body were
concentrated on that alarm clock. If you hadn’t fallen into her hands,
I’d have made you go read to her anyway. It may have been some
distraction. There was another reason—”</p>
<p>“Did she die free?” asked Jem.</p>
<p>“As the mountain air,” said Atticus. “She was conscious to the last,
almost. Conscious,” he smiled, “and cantankerous. She still disapproved
heartily of my doings, and said I’d probably spend the rest of my life
bailing you out of jail. She had Jessie fix you this box—”</p>
<p>Atticus reached down and picked up the candy box. He handed it to
Jem.</p>
<p>Jem opened the box. Inside, surrounded by wads of damp cotton, was a
white, waxy, perfect camellia. It was a Snow-on-the-Mountain.</p>
<p>Jem’s eyes nearly popped out of his head. “Old hell-devil, old
hell-devil!” he screamed, flinging it down. “Why can’t she leave me
alone?”</p>
<p>In a flash Atticus was up and standing over him. Jem buried his face
in Atticus’s shirt front. “Sh-h,” he said. “I think that was her way of
telling you—everything’s all right now, Jem, everything’s all right. You
know, she was a great lady.”</p>
<p>“A lady?” Jem raised his head. His face was scarlet. “After all those
things she said about you, a lady?”</p>
<p>“She was. She had her own views about things, a lot different from
mine, maybe… son, I told you that if you hadn’t lost your head I’d have
made you go read to her. I wanted you to see something about her—I
wanted you to see what real courage is, instead of getting the idea that
courage is a man with a gun in his hand. It’s when you know you’re
licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no
matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do. Mrs. Dubose won, all
ninety-eight pounds of her. According to her views, she died beholden to
nothing and nobody. She was the bravest person I ever knew.”</p>
<p>Jem picked up the candy box and threw it in the fire. He picked up
the camellia, and when I went off to bed I saw him fingering the wide
petals. Atticus was reading the paper.</p>
