<p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p>
<p>“WALL STREET Is…MAIN STREET”</p>
<p>Despite Roosevelt’s best efforts, the New Deal did not end the
Depression. That was accomplished by the Second World War. In one of the
most remarkable developments in economic history,the American economy
expanded by 125 percent between 1940 and 1944. With significant
exceptions, civilian production continued during these years, but in
addition to the civilian production, the United States also produced
6,500 naval vessels,296,400 air-planes,86,330 tanks,64,546 landing
craft,3.5 million jeeps,trucks, and personnel carriers,53 million
deadweight tons of car govessels, 12 million rifles, carbines, and
machine guns, and 47 million tons of artillery shells.</p>
<p>This fantastic boom in the economy (the unemployed in 1944 numbered a
mere seven hundred thousand, 10 percent of the number of unemployed as
recently as 1940) was not, however,reflected on Wall Street.Yet the
outbreak of war in Europe in September 1939 did not cause a panic such
as had occurred in 1914. It was obvious months earlier that war was
likely, and the les-sons of the Great War indicated that, whatever the
tragedy tohumanity, it would be beneficial to the American
economy.Indeed,the Dow Jones industrial average gained twenty points in
the firstfew days of the war, a major increase at that time. But the
rally soonstalled amid fears that Hitler, not facing the threat of a
second frontthanks to his pact with Stalin, would prevail over France
andBritain, who were both relatively weaker than they had been aquarter
century earlier. When the great German victories in the spring of 1940
destroyed French power and brought Britain to the brink of defeat, the
market began a three-year decline.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp;Poor’s average had ended 1939 at 12.06.It ended
1942 at 8.67, a drop of more than 25 percent. In April 1942,the Dow
Jones closed below 100 for the last time. Significantly the sedeclines
came while corporate profits, which had been only $6.4 billion in 1939,
soared to $20.9 billion in 1942.</p>
<p>Even worse than the fall in prices, at least from the brokers’
standpoint, was that volume began to seriously decline as well.Nineteen
thirty-nine was the first year since 1923 when averagedaily volume on
the New York Stock Exchange dropped below amillion shares (it had
averaged 2.5 million ten years earlier). Andthat was only the beginning.
The average was 954,000 in 1939.Thefollowing year it was 751,000. In
1941 it was 619,000, and in1942 it reached a dismal 455,000.Brokers,
with often little to doon the floor of the exchange, would sometimes
play baseball,usingrolled-up newspapers for bats and crumpled quotation
sheets forballs. The Wall Street community of
brokers,underwriters,anddealers, which had numbered 5,855 in 1940,had
dwindled to only 4,343 by 1947.</p>
<p>Only in 1943, after El Alamein and Stalingrad,did volume pick</p>
<p>up, once again averaging a million shares a day that year. But evenas
victory in the war became more and more certain,the marketremained
stubbornly mired in the doldrums. The public still hadall-too-vivid
memories of 1929 and wanted no part of Wall Street.Although per capita
disposable income doubled between 1940and 1945, the public did not
invest in stocks. Instead they paiddown their automobile and mortgage
loans, increased their lifeinsurance, and more than anything, saved.
Americans saved $4.2billion in 1940.Four years later they saved an
awesome $35.9 billion, with most of this money going into safe, insured
savings</p>
<p>accounts and war bonds, not risky Wall Street.</p>
<p>Further, the great majority of economists were predicting the</p>
<p>return of depression once the stimulus of war was removed. After
all,World War I had been followed by a sharp depression in 1920-21.But
the economists, like so many generals throughout history, werefighting
the last war. The American economy had been only mod-erately affected by
the First World War, due to just a small number of curbs on civilian
production. But the U.S. economy in the Sec-250</p>
<p>ond World War was, in many ways, a centrally planned one.The</p>
<p>CEO of the American economy was Donald Nelson,a formerexecutive vice
president of Sears Roebuck, who was appointed byRoosevelt as head of the
War Production Board.(Roosevelt had orig-inally wanted to call it the
War Production Administration,but real-ized that its initials would then
be WPA and knew that that wouldnever do.) It was the job of Nelson and
the WPB to determine whatwas needed to win the war, what raw materials
and industrialcapacity were available to produce it, and who got what
first. By1945 the WPB was the largest civilian wartime bureaucracy
inWashington,with twenty-five thousand employees, and used as much paper
every day as a major city newspaper. Hardly a paper clip could be
manufactured without its approval.</p>
<p>As a result, new housing, appliances, automobiles,trucks,
tires,radios, telephones, and so on, were virtually unobtainable in
thewaryears. This produced a vast pent-up demand that, coupled with the
capita</p>
<p>accumulated in people’s savings accounts and war bonds,fueled a
postwar boom, not a bust. When wages and prices werefreed from wartime
constraints in early 1946, the American econ-omy underwent a virulent
inflation as well as a continued expansion.Still, Wall Street did not
fully participate.On December 31,1949, the Dow Jones average stood at
only 200, just twice what ithad been in 1940, although the gross
national product had nearlytripled and corporate profits had done far
better than that. Eventhe bluest of blue-chip stocks, such as Firestone
and KennecottCopper, were selling for under four times earnings, despite
paying 8 to 12 percent in dividends, far above what bonds were
paying.</p>
<p>But underneath Wall Street’s continued lackluster surface, the</p>
<p>seeds of its far brighter future were being sown.That future
waspowerfully affected by two very different men,Charles E.Merrill and
Benjamin Graham.</p>
<p>Charles Merrill, like so many who made their fame and fortune on</p>
<p>Wall Street,was from a relatively modest, small-town background.Born
in 1885 in Green Cove Springs, south of Jacksonville in whatwas then the
semitropical wilds of northern Florida, Merrill wasthe son of a doctor
and pharmacist. He attended several schools and colleges, including two
years at Amherst College,but never graduated. He left school to take a
job with his fiancée’s father,who was treasurer of a small holding
company on Wall Street.Merrill arrived on the Street just in time to
experience the panic of1907 but soon prospered. He worked for several
firms before set-ting up his own, Charles E.Merrill Company,in early
1914.</p>
<p>Merrill, a natural salesman, made friends on Wall Street easily</p>
<p>and quickly. But hardly had the new firm opened its doors whenthe
outbreak of World War I put it right out of business with theclosing of
the exchange. Merrill survived by doing quiet trading inthe illicit but
tolerated New Street market until the exchangereopened. The following
year, Merrill merged his firm with that ofa bond salesman named Edmund
Lynch, and the name of MerrillLynch and Company appeared on Wall Street
for the first time.(The usual comma between the two names was
accidentally omit-ted in the partnership papers and has been
intentionally left out in all the reorganizations and renamings since
then.)</p>
<p>By the 1920s the firm was well established and successful. All</p>
<p>he same, Merrill was beginning to notice and tentatively exploit
anew, untapped source of customers,middle-class families withdisposable
(thus investable) income who had never beforethought of becoming stock
owners. He also began underwritingstock issues, especially chain stores
such as Kresge,Western AutoSupply,and J.C. Penney.In 1926 his firm
underwrote a large issueof Safeway Stores, of which he became a director
and a major stockholder in his own right.</p>
<p>As the bull market began to lose touch with the underlying</p>
<p>economy in late 1928,Merrill was among the first to sense
theimpending disaster. So early was he, in fact, that he doubted hisown
instincts and went to see a psychiatrist–psychiatry hadbecome
fashionable among the affluent in the postwar era–fear-ing he was being
irrational. After a few sessions, however, he andthe psychiatrist both
decided he was very rational indeed.Theyterminated treatment, and both
doctor and patient began sellingtheir stockholdings. Like many brokers,
Merrill was largely out ofthe market by the fall of 1929. Unlike many
brokers, however, hehad been advising his clients to get out since March
of that year.The following year, as Merrill saw the Depression lasting
indef-initely, he decided to get out of the business altogether.He sold
his seat on the exchange and sold the firm to E.A. Pierce &amp;Co. </p>
<p>He and Lynch both became limited partners of that firm, whichwas in
the forefront of those firms calling for reform on WallStreet. He spent
the next few years acting as a consultant to thevarious chain stores he
had helped to underwrite,and in thisperiod he probably began to develop
the idea of bringing chain-store techniques to the brokerage business to
create a firm of national scope and unprecedented size.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1930s E.A.Pierce &amp; Co.was not doing well</p>
<p>and Merrill was invited to return as an active partner and take
overthe management. In 1940 he agreed. Although Edmund Lynch diedthat
year, Merrill insisted his name be kept, and the new firm wasnamed
Merrill Lynch,E.A. Pierce,and Cassatt.The New Orleansbrokerage firm of
Fenner and Beane soon merged with Merrill’s, andthe firm became Merrill
Lynch, Pierce,Fenner and Beane.(Beane retired in 1958, when Winthrop
Smith’s name was added.)</p>
<p>Merrill immediately began to create a new type of brokerage</p>
<p>business. The smaller firms of the old style were typified by
RichardWhitney and Company (except, of course, for the illegalities of
itseponymous partner), which had probably fewer than fifty accountsfor
most of its existence,mostly owned by family and friends.Larger firms of
the era had what were then called customers’mento solicit and handle
accounts outside the immediate circle of thepartners’ associates, but
these accounts were acquired mostly by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Because customers’men worked strictly on commission,they had</p>
<p>a great incentive to encourage their customers to trade
frequently,whether that was in their best interest or not. And while
many ofthem were honest, hardworking, and knowledgeable,many otherswere
in the brokerage business only because they were
someone’sbrother-in-law. Their idea of research was to pass on to their
cus-tomers the latest tips generated by the ever-churning Wall Street
rumor mill.</p>
<p>Merrill changed all that. He gave his customers’men (they were</p>
<p>later called registeredrepresentatives) rigorous training in
thebasics of the brokerage business and paid them, in the beginning,a
straight salary rather than on commission.Merrill also adver-tised
widely beginning in 1948, touting his salesmen’s training and expertise.
And he realized that one of the biggest obstacles to new</p>
<p>customers was the ignorance of the average man in the ways ofWall
Street, in the sheer mechanics of buying and selling securi-ties. So in
these advertisements, he would also provide a basiccourse in exactly how
to invest in stocks and bonds and what the risks and potential rewards
were.</p>
<p>Further, he used advertising to advance his vision of what Wall</p>
<p>Street could and should be: a safe place to invest, staffed
withhonest,competent financial experts. Nearly a century earlier,William
Worthington Fowler had written, “The moralist andphilosopher look upon
[Wall Street] as a gambling den-a cage ofunclean birds, an abomination
where men drive a horrible trade,fattening and battening on the
substance of their friends andneighbors–or perhaps as a kind of modern
Coliseum where glad-iatorial combats are joined, and bulls, bears, and
other ferociousbeasts gore and tear each other for the public
amusements.”!Fowler’s ruleless Wall Street was long dead and gone by the
1940s,but the image he had helped to create lingered on in the
Americanfolk memory because Wall Street had never made any attempt to
change it. Merrill did make the attempt and succeeded.</p>
<p>When Harry Truman condemned “the money changers” in oneof his
campaign speeches in the 1948 campaign, Merrill respondedin an ad:</p>
<p>One campaign tactic did get us a little riled. That was when the</p>
<p>moth-eaten bogey of a Wall Street tycoon was trotted out….Mr.Truman
knows as well as anybody that there isn’t any Wall Street.That’s just
legend. Wall Street is Montgomery Street in San Fran-cisco.Seventeenth
Street in Denver.Marietta Street in Atlanta.Federal Street in
Boston.Main Street in Waco, Texas. And it’s anyspot in Independence,
Missouri, where thrifty people go to invest</p>
<p>heir money, to buy and sell securities.’</p>
<p>The new way of doing business was quickly a success, and by</p>
<p>he end of the 1940s Merrill Lynch was the largest brokeragehouse on
Wall Street, with a gross income of $45.7 million. By1960 it was
grossing $136 million and was almost four times thesize of the
second-biggest house on Wall Street,Bache &amp; Co.,and about as big as
the next four firms combined.That year Merrill</p>
<p>“WALL STREET Is…MAIN STREET”</p>
<p>Lynch had 540,000 brokerage accounts and was already known as“the
thundering herd.”</p>
<p>Merrill’s success, of course, forced other Wall Street firms to</p>
<p>adopt his practices, and the day of the small, boutique firm in
theold style began to end as brokerage firms of national scope
quicklyspread. The brokerage business of today is, in large measure,
thecreation of Charles E.Merrill, whose importance as a Wall Street
broker is every bit the equal of J.P. Morgan’s as a banker.</p>
<p>Another Wall Streeter who helped expand the customer base of</p>
<p>he brokerage business was Benjamin Graham. Graham was bornBenjamin
Grossbaum in London in 1894 (the family name waschanged in 1917 when
America’s entrance into World War I madeGerman-sounding names highly
unpopular).Graham’s parentswere importers of china and bric-a-brac who
had immigrated toLondon from Russian Poland,where his grandfather had
beengrand rabbi of Warsaw.When Benjamin was a year old, the
familymigrated to New York and continued in the china importing
busi-</p>
<p>ness.</p>
<p>Graham’s father died when he was only nine years old, and his</p>
<p>mother struggled to raise her children without him.Grahamproved an
extraordinarily good student, attending the Boys’ HighSchool in
Brooklyn–one of New York’s premier high schools-and then Columbia
University. Math was always his best subject,but he also learned to read
no fewer than six languages, including Latin and Greek.</p>
<p>Although offered a teaching job at Columbia,he was enthralled</p>
<p>by the numbers abounding on Wall Street.He was drawn espe-cially to
the statistics issued by the government and the annualreports of
companies whose securities were traded on Wall Street.He quickly
realized that they were gold mines of useful informationfor picking
investments. That this seems almost more than obvioustoday is, in fact,
a monument to Benjamin Graham himself,whopioneered the field named only
in the 1930s: securities analysis.Annual reports, of course, had been
around since the 1890s.But because bankers had precipitated their
creation,these reportstended not to be very forthcoming with information
that was ofuse to investors. Instead they emphasized what was of most
importance to bankers, creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Graham soon made a name for himself as someone who could</p>
<p>spot value in the numbers. In 1916, the Guggenheim interestsdecided
to liquidate a company called Guggenheim Exploration,then selling for
$68.88 a share.Graham noticed that much of theassets of the corporation
were in the form of shares of other pub-licly traded companies, and that
even with the most conservativevaluation of its fixed assets, the net
asset value of each share ofGuggenheim Exploration was at least $76.23,
indicating a virtu-ally guaranteed profit of over 10percent.Graham
lacked themoney to invest himself but he handled the matter for
others,tak-ing a 20 percent cut of the profits.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the early 1920s, Graham spotted that the market</p>
<p>value of Du Pont stock was no more than the market value of
theGeneral Motors stock the Du Pont company owned. (Du Pont wasa major
shareholder in General Motors until antitrust actionforced the company
to divest itself of GM stock in the 1950s.)Since Du Pont owned vast
other assets besides the GM stock, themarket had to be either valuing Du
Pont too low or GM stock too high. But which was it?</p>
<p>Graham didn’t need to know. He simply loaded up on Du Pont</p>
<p>while selling an equivalent amount of GM short and waited forthe
market to recognize the discrepancy.When it did, Du Pontrose
substantially while GM held steady, allowing Graham to close his short
at no loss, while making a bundle on Du Pont.</p>
<p>Both of these investments fully illustrate Graham’s technique:</p>
<p>look for undervalued companies, invest, and wait for the market
tocatch on. He especially emphasized the primacy of working capi-tal and
cash in valuing a company and only then fixed assets suchas plant and
equipment. He advised being wary of “intangibles”such as goodwill. To
Graham, the most important calculation wasnet current assets, the value
of cash and those assets easily con-verted to cash, minus all current
liabilities. If this number washigh, then the security had a “margin of
safety” that limited anydownside risk, while providing an upside
potential. The only otherthing needed, of course, was patience, a virtue
in short supply onWall Street where, all too often, the measure of
eternity is the end of the current quarter.</p>
<p>Graham’s reputation as a stock-picking wizard spread quickly, and in
1926 he opened his own investment firm with $450,000</p>
<p>under his management.Just three years later he was managing$2.5
million.Graham consistently beat the Dow Jones in theseyears, which is a
good deal more than can be said for many moneymanagers then and now,
and</p>
<p>Bernard Baruch offered him a part-nership in 1928,which he turned
down. Of course,makingmoney in a bull market is easy; conserving it in a
bear market isanother matter altogether.In1929 the Dow, thanks to its
run-upearly in the year, was down only 15 percent, but Graham’s
funddeclined 20 percent. The next year, thinking the bear market
wasover, Graham pursued an aggressive investment strategy in whatturned
out to be the biggest mistake of his career. The Dow lost 29percent in
1930, but Graham’s fund was down a staggering 50 per-cent. But the next
year, while the Dow fell by 48 percent,Graham trimmed his losses to only
16 percent.</p>
<p>The market finally hit bottom the following year, and in the</p>
<p>oversold conditions typical of the end of a bear market,Grahamfound
countless promising companies that met his criteria forinvestment. By
the end of the decade he had earned back all themoney he had lost in the
postcrash years.Looking for additionalincome, Graham began teaching a
course at Columbia with thedescription“Investment theories subjected to
practical markettests. Origin and detection of discrepancies between
price andvalue.”’ The course soon became legendary and was often taken
by Wall Street professionals as well as by Columbia students.</p>
<p>In 1934 Graham,with coauthor David L.Dodd,published</p>
<p>Security Analysis, a college-level textbook.In 1949 he followed
itwith The Intelligent Investor, intended for its namesake.Pioneersin
the field, both books have been in print since the day they
werepublished, in numerous editions, selling hundreds of thousands
ofcopies each, a remarkable feat in a field where hundreds of booksare
now published every year, most of them with a shelf lifeshorter than the
latest murder mystery. The reason for this successis easy enough to
understand. As Warren Buffett, a pupil and thenemployee of Graham’s,
explained, “No one has ever become poor reading Graham.”</p>
<p>Charles Merrill and his imitators soon adopted Graham’s secu-rity
analysis as a selling tool and established large research depart-257</p>
<p>ments-quite unknown until the 1940s–to turn out stock
rec-ommendations and market letters. The New York Society of Secu-rity
Analysts had been founded in the 1930s with only twentymembers. By 1962
it had grown to around twenty-seven hundred members.</p>
<p>Although more and more people began to invest in Wall Street in the
postwar era, they still numbered fewer than those who hadowned stocks in
1929 at the height of the bubble. But far more peo-ple owned stock
indirectly, thanks to two new developments.Pen-sion funds, designed to
supplement Social Security, came into beinglargely in the 1930s and
1940s as bigger companies became union-ized and unions bargained for
their creation.Charles E. Wilson,president of General Motors (and later
famous for something henever said: “What is good for General Motors is
good for the coun-try”), was one of the first to push the idea. The
management expertPeter Drucker told him that if the money in such funds
was investedin the stock market, in a few years the workers would be the
ownersof American business. “Exactly what they should be,” replied
Wil-son, whose father had been a strong supporter of Eugene V.
Debs.*</p>
<p>By 1960 this prophecy was on its way to becoming true as pen-sion
funds and unions with assets totaling billions were becomingmajor
players on Wall Street. The Teamsters that year held stockworth $23.5
million; the United Mine Workers Union had $16.4million invested in Wall
Street.In 1961,when the federal budgetamounted to less than $100
billion, all noninsured pension fundsheld $17.4 billion in listed
stocks. And by that time pension fundswere investing at the rate of
around $1 billion a year in stocks andanother $2 billion in bonds. In
addition, as millions of Americanfamilies became able to afford the
luxury of life insurance, its pur-veyors, insurance companies, were
increasingly major investors on the Street.</p>
<p>Mutual funds, too, were becoming more and more significant.</p>
<p>Closed-end funds (in which there are a fixed number of shares
thatmust be bought and sold in the market like other securities) hadbeen
around for years, but the first true mutual fund (where shareswere
bought and redeemed from the fund itself at net asset value) appeared
only in 1924 with the creation of the Massachusetts Investment Trust.
Although the mutual funds weathered the crash better than the closed-end
funds, they remained relatively unim-portant on the Street.Brokers, who
earned commissions buyingand selling closed-end funds, naturally pushed
them rather than the mutuals.</p>
<p>But by 1940 the mutuals, which catered to the small investor by</p>
<p>allowing him to invest sums as small as $10, had around $500 mil-lion
in assets, an amount nearly as large as the assets of closed-endfunds.
By 1950 they had $2.5 billion invested in them, and a decade later the
amount was almost $17 billion and climbing quickly.</p>
<p>As new money and new players impacted the Street,the long shadow of
1929 at last</p>
<p>began to fade. One of Wall Street’s oldestadages–sell on trumpets,
buy on drums-once again provedprophetic.The trumpets that had heralded
the victory in WorldWar II had not sparked a real rally. But as the
drumbeats of the1953-54 recession started to be heard, the market
unexpectedlytook off. The Dow stood at only 264.04 on September
30,1953.Afew days earlier, U.S.News and World Report had written
that”stocks today, on the average, sell for about eleven percent less
thaneight months ago. Investors, seeing prices fall in the midst of
great prosperity,are mystified.”</p>
<p>But in January1954, after President Eisenhower promised a</p>
<p>balanced budget (which he didn’t manage to actually deliver),
themarket at last began to move strongly upward. The gross
nationalproduct that year dipped from $365.4 billion to $363.1
billion,while the Dow Jones rose125 points. It reached a new
post-depression high on February 13,when it closed at 294.03, itshighest
since April 1930. By June it was at 330. By the first weekin December,
it finally smashed through the 1929 record of 381.17 that had stood for
twenty-five long years.</p>
<p>This turned out to be the signal that the market had been wait-ing
for, and the Eisenhower bull market took off with a roar. Stockprices
far outstripped dividends, which rose only about 35 percentin the decade
of the 1950s. Indeed stock prices often outstrippedcorporate earnings as
well. General Motors rose from a high of32%in 1954 to one of 55% in
1960, but its earnings rose only from $3.02 a share to $3.35.</p>
<p>Besides the attenuation of fears generated by the 1929 crash,two
other forces drove the new bull market. The first was simplesupply and
demand. The money pouring into pension and mutualfunds and insurance
companies had to be invested somewhere.And the supply of securities did
not rise as quickly as the demandfor them. The number of listed issues
on the New York StockExchange actually fell between 1953 and
1959,from1,532 to1,507. The total number of shares rose only from 3.2
billion to 5.8 billion, while stock prices considerably more than
doubled.</p>
<p>The second reason was that the market was, in many ways, onlycatching
up with economic reality. With a few minor interrup-tions, the market
had been lagging behind the rapidly expandingpostwar American economy.
As one economic historian put it,The Eisenhower bull market was solidly
based on Truman pros-</p>
<p>perity.”</p>
<p>But a bull market it certainly was. People who had nothing to do</p>
<p>with the Street began following it. Radio and television
personalitiesoffered stock tips. Walter Winchell was perhaps the best
known ofthese, and his touted stocks would usually leap momentarily
before returning to the obscurity from which he had plucked them.</p>
<p>And volume, the sine qua non of all bull markets, increased</p>
<p>sharply. The total volume in 1954, 573 million shares, was
thegreatest since 1931, and the average daily volume topped 2 millionfor
the first time since the bottom of the Great Depression in1933.By 1959,
annual volume surpassed 1 billion shares for the first time.</p>
<p>For the rest of the decade and beyond, the Dow kept rising.But</p>
<p>he Dow, while then as now the most frequently noted barometerof the
stock market, actually understated the bull market of the1950s and
1960s.Complaints about the Dow have been com-monplace almost since the
day it was born. For one thing, it is”price-weighted” rather than
“market-weighted.” This means thatthe high-priced stocks in the average
count for more than the low-priced ones, regardless of their market
capitalization (the price oftheir shares times the total number of
shares outstanding).Theaverage is calculated this way because, in
1898,Charles Downeeded to be able to make the calculations quickly, with
paper and pencil. Another cause for complaint is that only thirty stocks
are in</p>
<p>“WALL STREET Is…MAIN STREET”</p>
<p>he average, while tens of thousands of stocks are traded every dayon
Wall Street.</p>
<p>And these thirty stocks have changed over the years.General</p>
<p>Electric, as noted earlier, is the only stock that was in the
originalDow that is in it today. Some companies were removed becausethey
collapsed into bankruptcy or merged with other companies.Some were
removed because the keepers of the flame at DowJones thought others
would represent the American economy bet-ter. This sort of changeover
has had no small effect on the Dow and on the history of the stock
market, especially in the postwar era,In 1939, for instance, IBM, then a
manufacturer of business equipment and tabulating machines, was removed
from the Dow tomake room for AT&amp;T, which, except for its Western
Electric sub-sidiary, wasn’t an industrial company at all. But in the
next fortyyears, until IBM was readmitted to the Dow in
1979,AT&amp;Tsstock price merely doubled, an unimpressive performance to
say theleast. Meanwhile,IBM became one of the legends of Wall
Street,splitting its stock no less than twenty-nine times in those forty
years while its price increased a staggering 22,000 percent.</p>
<p>Thus, had the powers-that-were at Dow Jones simply left well</p>
<p>enough alone, the stock market would have recovered its 1929high,
crossed a thousand, and begun its climb into the strato-sphere much
sooner than it officially did. And the actual history ofthe stock market
would have been altered as well, for the playersin the market would have
reacted differently to the very different readings Charles Dow’s
barometer would have provided them.</p>
<p>While Wall Street’s reforms of the1930s, Charles Merrill’s new-style
brokerage, and the Eisenhower bull market had given theStreet an
entirely new image, crooks were still to be found. Theyalways will be.
One of the more memorable of these was AnthonyDe Angelis,known as Tino,
whose larceny led to a major change on the Street.</p>
<p>De Angelis was a speculator in the commodities markets, espe-cially
those in cotton and soybean oils and in the meal that was aby-product of
this oil production.In 1962 he tried to corner themarket in these oils,
weaving a complicated web of speculation todo so. He bought vast
quantities of oil on both the spot and futures markets and stored this
oil in a tank farm he owned in Bayonne,261</p>
<p>New Jersey, just across New York Bay from lower Manhattan.To</p>
<p>help finance his speculations he sold warehouse receipts for thisoil,
mostly to a subsidiary of American Express called the Ameri-can Express
Field Warehousing Company.</p>
<p>American Express, in turn, sold the warehouse receipts,implic-itly
guaranteeing them. At some point American Express sentinspectors to De
Angelis’s tank farm to see that everything was inorder. It wasn’t. The
tanks were mostly empty, for De Angelis had sold not just the warehouse
receipts for the oil, but the oil itself.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, November 19,1963, De Angelis’s Crude Veg-etable Oil
Refining Company filed for bankruptcy. But that wasonly the beginning.
De Angelis had used two major brokeragehouses, Williston and Beane,and
Ira Haupt and Company,to han-dle his speculations in salad-oil futures,
and both were now inmortal peril. The next morning the New York Stock
Exchange sus-pended both firms from trading until their condition could
be ascertained.</p>
<p>In the 1920s the failure of a brokerage firm was largely the con-cern
of its partners and its relative handful of customers.But IraHaupt had
nearly twenty-one thousand customers, who had $450million in securities
and $5.5 million in cash on deposit at the firm.Many of the securities
were in “street name,” meaning that whileowned by the customers, they
were registered in the name of thefirm to facilitate trading or to act
as collateral for margin accounts.In bankruptcy, securities that are in
the customers’ names are rel-atively quickly returned to the owners. But
those in street name can be tied up for months and even years.</p>
<p>Williston and Beane had another nine thousand customers,with similar
amounts at risk. With the suspension, all these assetswere suddenly
unavailable to their customers. The solvency ofAmerican Express, a major
bank as well as a travel company, was also at risk.</p>
<p>Customers at other brokerage houses began demanding their</p>
<p>securities and cash deposits, and something resembling an
old-fashioned bank run began. Although neither the New York
StockExchange nor its member firms were obligated to bail out the
cus-tomers of the two firms, they were compelled to act out of
enlight-ened self-interest, for other firms could be rendered
temporarily insolvent if too many of their customers withdrew their
securities and cash. And if Wall Street didn’t do something,the
Securitiesand Exchange Commission most certainly would, further
curtail-</p>
<p>ing the independence of the Street.</p>
<p>On Friday morning,Merrill Lynch and Walston and Company,</p>
<p>another brokerage house, announced that they had offered Willis-ton
and Beane</p>
<p>a loan of $500,000 to allow it to meet the exchange’scapital
requirements and reopen. Merrill Lynch also said it was pre-pared to
take the firm over if need be, which, in fact, it would
laterdo.Williston and Beane was able to reopen about noon on
Friday,November 22.Ira Haupt,however, remained in serious jeopardy.Keith
Funston,the president of the exchange, called a confer-ence of bankers
to consider what to do about Ira Haupt.Butbefore they could meet, news
of President Kennedy’s assassina-tion in Dallas crossed the wires and
Wall Street plunged into a fargreater panic than anything promised by
the salad-oil scandal.TheDow Jones plummeted 24 points in only half an
hour on volume of2.6 million shares before the market could be closed,
shortly after two o’clock.</p>
<p>While the nation mourned its dead president,Keith Funston</p>
<p>worked to arrange an orderly liquidation of Ira Haupt and Company.On
Monday, November 25, an agreement was reached.Theexchange would assess
its members $12 million to make Ira Haupt’scustomers whole, and the
banks who were creditors of Haupt’swould defer $24 million owed them.
Then the firm would be liq-uidated, its assets used to pay back the
exchange and the banks.</p>
<p>Anything that was left over would then go to the firm’s partners.</p>
<p>The next morning, Tuesday, the exchange reopened for the first</p>
<p>ime since Friday afternoon. The news of the exchange’s action-the
first time in its history it had assumed responsibility for amember
firm’s failure–and the apparent orderly transition ofpower in Washington
combined to cause the greatest one-dayincrease in the Dow in
history,32.03 points.(American Express aswell acted with responsibility.
It could have allowed its subsidiaryto go into receivership and leave
those who had bought the ware-house receipts from it holding the bag.But
American Express made good its subsidiary’s obligations.)</p>
<p>A year later the exchange announced the establishment of a
spe-263</p>
<p>cial fund of $10 million (plus a $15-million line of credit) to
han-dle any future similar events. The new fund was a major change inthe
way that Wall Street did business and a recognition that WallStreet had
collective interests that transcended individual-firminterests. In that
way it was strikingly similar to the reforms of thelate 1860s, when the
newly merged New York Stock Exchange andOpen Board of Brokers had curbed
the excesses of the era ofunbridled speculation, and the 1890s, when the
investment bankshad imposed annual reports and independent accounting on
cor-porate management. Adam Smith’s invisible hand had once again moved
the Street in the right direction.</p>
<p>On February 28,1964, the Dow closed over 800 for the first</p>
<p>ime, and there seemed to be no end to the great bull market thathad
begun more than a decade earlier. The Dow would close theyear at 874.13,
a 14.6 percent gain for the year. Seats were sellingfor well over
$200,000, and volume was higher than it had beensince 1929.The exchange
announced the introduction of a newticker, one capable of pumping out
nine hundred characters aminute and handling10-million-share days. It
would be the lastmajor advance in a technology that had done more to
advance thereach of Wall Street than any other in the previous hundred
years.A new technology, the digital computer, already in the back
officesof every bank, insurance company, and large brokerage house,would
soon do to the ticker what the telephone had done to the telegraph.</p>
<p>In the latter part of the 1960s, however, the bull market stalled
out, below the once nearly mythic 1,000 mark on the Dow. Theaverage
reached 1,000 intraday for the first time in 1966, andwould reach it
intraday four more times, before finally closingabove 1,000 for the
first time in 1972, fully six years later.Butwhile the market rise
stalled, the volume did not.It averaged6.2 million shares in 1965 and
7.5 million in 1966.In 1967 theslowest day of the year saw a volume of
5.9 million shares.Thatwas 695,000 more shares traded than on the
busiest day asrecently as 1960.In 1968, the daily volume record that had
beenset on October 29, 1929,finally fell after nearly forty
years.Itshould have been a cause for celebration.After all,volume is
mother’s milk to brokers.</p>
<p>But it was not, for by the late sixties Wall Street was drowning
inpaper.Fails–trades that are recorded differently by buyer andseller so
that delivery cannot be effected until the matter is straight-ened
out–were rising alarmingly:In December 1968, no less than$4.1 billion in
securities simply could not be accounted for at all.No one knew it at
the time, of course, but it was the beginningof the worst period on Wall
Street since Herbert Hoover was in the White House.</p>
