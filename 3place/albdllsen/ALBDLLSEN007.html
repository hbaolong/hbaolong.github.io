<h4 id="chapter-5-a-despicable-mess">Chapter 5 A Despicable Mess</h4>
<p>So far as Syria is concerned, it is France and not Turkey that is the
enemy.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE TO HIS FAMILY, FEBRUARY 1915</p>
<p>Soon after taking up his post at the Savoy Hotel, Lawrence
commandeered the largest wall in the office and covered it with a
massive sectioned map of the Ottoman world. In his idle moments, he
would stand against the opposite wall and gaze upon it for as long as
time permitted, taking in all its vastness.</p>
<p>By January 1915, he was awaiting the Turkish attack on the Suez Canal
with a certain impatience. One reason was that he had little doubt of
its outcome. To reach the canal, the Turks first had to cross 120 miles
of the inhospitable Sinai Peninsula. From his knowledge of that expanse,
and especially of its limited water sources, Lawrence was convinced the
attacking force would, by necessity, be quite small—surely not the
100,000 soldiers some alarmists in the British military hierarchy were
suggesting—and thus easily repelled.</p>
<p>But the chief reason for his impatience was that he was already
contemplating the next chapter in the Near East war, the one to come
once the Turkish assault had been turned back. It would then be time for
the British to go on the offensive, and gazing upon his maps at the
Savoy, Lawrence was seeking out those places where an invading force
might strike at the Ottoman Empire to most devastating effect.</p>
<p>One truly odd feature of that map had undoubtedly long since occurred
to him: despite its enormous size and tenuous political cohesion, from
the standpoint of geography that empire was astoundingly well
protected.</p>
<p>The political and spiritual core of the Ottoman world was of course
the ancient city of Constantinople, along with the mountainous region of
Anatolia, the ancestral heartland of the Turks, that lay to its east.
This concentration inevitably conjured a tantalizing prospect to British
war planners, the chance to “decapitate” their enemy: if that city and
that region could be seized, there was little doubt that all else would
quickly collapse.</p>
<p>Except that any possible path to doing so presented enormous
obstacles. With both of Turkey’s European neighbors, Greece and
Bulgaria, still neutral in the war, there was little maneuvering room to
try an overland approach on Constantinople from the west. In theory,
Britain’s Russian allies could attempt an eastern advance from their
position at the far end of Anatolia, but already being bled white by the
Germans on the Eastern Front, the Russians were likely to exhaust their
available manpower and matériel before getting very far in the
mountainous terrain. As for a southern approach, that meant either a
ground force trudging up through the Anatolian heartland where local
resistance would be fierce—and, again, the mountains—or a naval flotilla
running the gauntlet of Turkish forts lining the three-mile-wide
Dardanelles strait. There was simply no easy way.</p>
<p>But the alternative, to start at some point on the Ottoman Empire’s
periphery, looked even worse. British Indian forces had seized the
oilfields of southern Iraq in the first days of the war, but an overland
march from there meant a seven-hundred-mile slog through river
swamplands and desert before the Anatolian frontier was even reached.
Likewise, an advance from Egypt meant first crossing the desolate Sinai
Peninsula, then crashing up against Turkish forces massed in the narrow
chokepoint of southern Palestine.</p>
<p>But amid this whole great expanse, there did exist one exquisitely
vulnerable point in the Ottoman Empire’s wall of natural defenses. It
was the Gulf of Alexandretta, at that spot in northwest Syria where the
long north-south coastline of the eastern Mediterranean shore bumps up
against the far more rugged coastline of Anatolia. Not only was
Alexandretta possessed of the best deep natural harbor in the eastern
Mediterranean, a critical asset for amphibious operations, but the
relatively flat landscape just to its east afforded ample room for
ground troops to maneuver for a push farther inland.</p>
<p>But these were military considerations, ones that a number of senior
British officers in Egypt had cottoned to even before Lawrence’s
arrival. What Lawrence uniquely saw, both from his familiarity with the
region—Jerablus lay just one hundred miles east of Alexandretta—and his
firsthand view of Ottoman society, was the political.</p>
<p>One of the great hidden dangers for any empire going to war is that
within its borders are often large communities of people who want
absolutely nothing to do with it. And the longer a war and its
deprivations continue, the more resentful these communities become, and
the more susceptible to the promises and propaganda of one’s enemies.
Most of the dueling empires of Europe were grappling with this internal
danger as their war stretched on, but whatever problems the Europeans
faced in this regard—and in some cases they were considerable—paled to
insignificance next to those facing the Young Turks in Constantinople.
Quite simply, given the extremely polyglot nature of their realm, most
any course of action they might take that would win the support of one
segment of the population was all but guaranteed to alienate another.
This quandary had been illustrated by the mixed results of the call to
jihad in November. While that call had momentarily excited the Muslim
youth, it had terrified the empire’s non-Muslim populations. At the same
time, many conservative Muslim Arabs, already mistrustful of the Young
Turks’ perceived favoritism toward ethnic Turks, viewed it as a cynical
attempt by an increasingly secular regime to play the religion card.</p>
<p>But if the Ottoman Empire was a mosaic, it was also one of distinct
patterns, where various “colors” predominated or diminished across its
expanse. And if one studied this mosaic from a slight remove, there was
one spot on this great expanse where many of these patterns came to a
confluence, creating a kind of ethnic and religious ground zero:
Alexandretta.</p>
<p>Already, for reasons of distance and the relatively scant resources
being allotted to it, Lawrence was convinced that a conventional war
against Turkey wouldn’t work. Instead, the British needed to pursue a
so-called irregular strategy. That meant taking advantage of the
internal fissures of their enemy’s society, forging alliances with its
malcontents. The Alexandretta Basin was the demarcation line between the
Turkish world of Anatolia to the north and the great Arab world to the
south—and as Lawrence well knew from his years at Jerablus, the Arabs of
northern Syria had grown to deeply resent their Turkish overseers.
Alexandretta also stood at the edge of the heartland of the Armenians, a
people who had suffered periodic massacres at the hands of their Turkish
neighbors; surely no people had more reason to rebel against
Constantinople than they. In Lawrence’s view, quite aside from its
purely military advantages, a British landing at Alexandretta was almost
certain to spark uprisings of both Syrians and Armenians against the
Turks, uprisings that would naturally complement the British effort.</p>
<p>But Lawrence also had firsthand information that made the idea even
more enticing. The principal highway linking Anatolia to the south
passed through the Alexandretta Basin, and as Lawrence knew from his
time in the region, that highway was in terrible condition. In addition,
the Hejaz Railway that linked Constantinople to its Arab realms passed
through the basin—or, to put it more accurately, partially linked,
because what Lawrence also knew, courtesy of his journey through the
region six months earlier at the behest of Stewart Newcombe, was that
two crucial spans of that railway in the Taurus and Amanus Mountains
north of Alexandretta were nowhere near completion. This meant that the
Turks would have no way of responding quickly if an invasion force took
control of the basin, and in the slowness of their response, all points
to the south, cut off from resupply or reinforcement, might quickly
fall. With just a comparative handful of soldiers in Alexandretta,
then—Lawrence estimated a mere two or three thousand would be needed—the
British had the potential of not only splitting the Ottoman Empire in
two, but of taking one-third of its population and over half of its land
area out of the war in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Lawrence wasn’t alone in identifying Alexandretta’s extraordinary
vulnerability; the Turks were keenly aware of it too—so keenly, in fact,
that it had already caused them to submit to one of the more humiliating
episodes of World War I.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1914, a lone British warship, HMS Doris, had appeared
off Alexandretta and, in a brazen game of bluff, issued an ultimatum to
the local Turkish commander: release all foreign prisoners in the town,
as well as surrender all ammunition and railway rolling stock, or face
bombardment. In desperation, for they had no guns to resist such an
attack, the Turks had threatened to kill one British prisoner for every
one of their citizens killed in the bombardment. That threat, in blatant
violation of the Geneva and Hague war conventions, had sparked outrage
within the diplomatic community and been quickly countermanded by the
Young Turk leadership in Constantinople. Instead, a bizarre compromise
was reached: in return for the British not shelling the town, the Turks
agreed to destroy the two train engines that were sitting in
Alexandretta station. Except, the embarrassed Turks were soon forced to
admit, they had neither the explosives nor the expertise to uphold their
end of the deal, so on the morning of December 22, a demolitions expert
from the Doris was given safe passage to come ashore and blow the trains
up. Understandably, the British government’s attention to the Doris
affair largely centered on the death-threat aspect, but to Lawrence the
incident laid bare just how panicked the Turks were of what could be
done to them in Alexandretta.</p>
<p>Although a mere second lieutenant relegated to collating maps, by
virtue of his attachment to the military intelligence unit Lawrence was
in the unique position of having his ideas disseminated to the highest
levels of the British war-planning structure. It is surely no
coincidence that while an Alexandretta landing had been discussed
before, the scheme took on new urgency shortly after his arrival in
Cairo. Judging by its telltale idiosyncratic approach to grammar,
Lawrence was almost certainly the author of a crucial January 5, 1915,
military intelligence memorandum on the subject: “We have been informed
from two good sources that the Germans in command in Syria dread nothing
so much as a landing by us in the north of Syria—they say themselves
that this would be followed by a general defection of their Arab troops.
There is no doubt that this fear is well founded, and that a general
Arab revolt, directed by the Pan-Arab military league, would be the
immediate result of our occupation of Alexandretta.”</p>
<p>The lobbying had an effect. On January 15, 1915, just one month after
his arrival in Cairo, Lawrence sent an update to his old mentor in
Oxford, David Hogarth. Because the letter had to clear military censors,
he adopted a deliberately vague tone: “Our particular job goes well. We
all pulled together hard for a month to twist ‘them’ from what we
thought was a wrong line they were taking—and we seem to have succeeded
completely, so that we today have got all we want for the moment, and
therefore feel absolutely bored.”</p>
<p>The “them” he alluded to were senior British war planners in Cairo
and London, while the “job” was an amphibious landing at Alexandretta.
The only holdup now, it seemed to Lawrence, was for the long-awaited
Turkish assault on the Suez Canal to be put safely in the past.</p>
<p>SO GREAT WAS his men’s morale that for a brief time even Djemal Pasha
was stirred by the thought that it just might work out after all.
“Everyone was absolutely convinced that certainly the Canal would be
crossed,” he recalled, “that we should dig ourselves in securely on the
further bank, and that the Egyptian patriots would then rise and attack
the English in the rear.”</p>
<p>One source of this soaring optimism within the ranks of the Ottoman
Fourth Army at the end of January 1915 was the extraordinary fortitude
they had shown in crossing the Sinai, a shining example of what was
possible when Turkish doggedness was joined to German organization.
Making that 120-mile crossing had been months in the planning and
involved almost superhuman logistical arrangements. Overseen by German
officers, engineering units had fanned out across the desert beforehand,
tapping wells for the oncoming troops, building rainwater reservoirs,
and laying in depots of ammunition. Great teams of oxen had hauled the
disassembled pontoon bridges needed to ford the Suez Canal, as well as
the army’s heavy artillery, while some twelve thousand camels had been
gathered up from as far away as central Arabia to ferry supplies. In
early January, the army of thirteen thousand men set out along three
different paths through the desert, and despite the deprivations of that
march—each man’s daily food ration consisted of just a half pound of
biscuits and a handful of olives—by the end of the month the attack
force was encamped just a few miles east of the canal, ready to strike.
Certainly the British in Egypt knew an attack was imminent—their spotter
planes had photographed and occasionally shot at some of the Turkish
formations—but they seemed to have no idea how large the force might be
or where along the hundred-mile length of the canal it would come. It
was this that had put Djemal’s troops in such good spirits.</p>
<p>“I used to talk to the troops every night about the victory in
store,” he wrote, “and what a glorious victory it would be. I wanted to
keep the sacred flame alive in the whole force.… If, by some
unanticipated stroke of good fortune, this enterprise … had brought us
success, we should naturally have regarded it as a good omen for the
final liberation of Islam and the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
<p>One man who little shared in these high hopes was Major Curt Prüfer.
Along with a small contingent of other German junior officers, he had
endured the hard rigors of that desert crossing, and attributed all its
success to the meticulous planning of the chief German military advisor
to Djemal, a lieutenant colonel with the colorful name of Friedrich
Kress von Kressenstein. Still, planning had its limits, and even if
Prüfer wasn’t a professional soldier—just like T. E. Lawrence, he had
received his officer’s commission with no actual military training—he
appreciated that the changed face of modern war almost surely meant
problems for the coming offensive. In particular, in the age of aerial
reconnaissance, then just in its infancy, the British undoubtedly had a
far better idea of their enemy’s strength and intentions than the Turks
imagined.</p>
<p>This was confirmed to Prüfer by his own reconnaissance missions to
the canal. The plan of attack called for the Turkish army’s flanks to
make diversionary feints at the north and south ends of the waterway,
while the main force of some sixty-five hundred men stormed across near
its midpoint, just above the Great Bitter Lake. When Prüfer joined a
forward scouting party that crept close to the canal on the morning of
January 25, he observed just two British dredgers and a handful of small
lighter boats in the lake. Three days later, however, the British
presence had grown to several transport ships and two cruisers, a number
that expanded to some twenty ships by January 30. In the meantime,
Prüfer had experienced a close call when a British warplane dropped two
bombs on the main headquarters encampment.</p>
<p>“I confess that the hammering of the bombs, the powerful explosions
and the black billowing smoke, frightened me,” he noted in his diary,
“although I did my best to hide it. In the camp, everyone ran
pell-mell.”</p>
<p>To Prüfer, it all pointed to a coming disaster. “The enemy cruisers
in the lake control the situation,” he wrote upon returning from the
January 30 scouting mission. “We will be destroyed before we have
actually come into the vicinity of the channel.” That night, he ate his
“hangman’s meal,” asparagus and French toast.</p>
<p>The assault finally came in the early-morning hours of February 3,
1915. Taking advantage of a brief sandstorm that screened their actions
from view, Turkish engineers hastily assembled their ten pontoon bridges
at the water’s edge as the foot soldiers massed behind, ready to charge
across. At a crucial moment, however, a British searchlight picked up
the activity; in a barrage of rifle and artillery fire, seven of the
pontoon bridges were quickly destroyed. That may have been a blessing in
disguise for the Fourth Army, for it limited the slaughter. As it was,
the approximately six hundred Turkish soldiers who had managed to reach
the far shore before their escape routes were cut off were all either
soon killed or compelled to surrender.</p>
<p>Prüfer had been given the quixotic task of leading forward a long
wagon train hauling sandbags; the plan called for the sandbags to be
used both to block the canal and to create a bridge to the far shore.
Instead, he spent most of the day scrambling from one point of chaos on
the front lines to the next as British naval shells exploded all
around.</p>
<p>By nightfall, Djemal and his senior German advisors concluded that
the situation was hopeless, and a general retreat back across the Sinai
desert began. To most everyone’s surprise, the British made no attempt
to pursue the fleeing army, enabling its withdrawal to be as orderly and
disciplined as had been its advance.</p>
<p>Despite his own bleak assessment on the eve of battle, the setback on
the canal seemed to cast Curt Prüfer into despondency. Nursing a slight
arm wound—he’d apparently been hit by shrapnel during the assault—he
holed up in Hafir el Andscha, an oasis town at the eastern edge of the
Sinai, to file dispatches to Max von Oppenheim and Hans von Wangenheim,
the German ambassador to Turkey. He was blunt, even derisive, over the
campaign’s failure to trigger an Egyptian uprising.</p>
<p>“Despite all our agitation,” he wrote Oppenheim, “despite the
thousands of [jihadist] pamphlets, we did not have any deserters.… The
Egyptians are even cowardly in desperation, and lack any genuine love of
fatherland.”</p>
<p>But his disappointment clearly had deeper roots. Ever since teaming
up with Max von Oppenheim, the former Oriental scholar had fervently
embraced the notion of a pan-Islamic jihad against Germany’s imperial
enemies. Not just the battle but the entire Sinai campaign gave the lie
to that. From the very outset, tensions were evident between the Turkish
and Arab components of the assault force, and these had only worsened
with time. Many of the Arab units fled as soon as the shooting began, or
never deployed in the first place, while some went over to the enemy.
Prüfer heaped particular scorn on the Bedouin nomad warriors, many of
whom he had personally recruited to act as scouts and who similarly
melted away on the decisive day. Indeed, just about the only unifying
element detectable among this fractious lot was antipathy for their
German advisors; even many Turkish officers had adopted a policy of
“passive resistance” to any direction offered by the Germans throughout
the campaign.</p>
<p>“The holy war,” Prüfer informed his old mentor from Hafir el Andscha,
“is a tragicomedy.”</p>
<p>Djemal Pasha had a rather more upbeat assessment. While the assault
obviously hadn’t led to the Egyptian uprising he had hoped for, the
action would cause the British to keep more troops in reserve in Egypt,
making fewer available to fight elsewhere. Moreover, by his calling off
the engagement when he did, his army was still largely intact. At the
same time, as they made their respective ways back across the Sinai,
Djemal and Prüfer undoubtedly shared a mounting sense of unease. Given
the tit-for-tat nature of the war, a British retaliatory offensive would
come soon. The only question was where, and from their own recent
difficult journeys across Syria, both knew the likeliest spot: the
Alexandretta Basin.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the broken railways and “canal” roads of that
chokepoint that were cause for worry. In the nationwide scramble for
reliable frontline troops, the Turks had been forced to leave the
safeguarding of the Alexandretta region to two second-rate divisions
composed almost exclusively of Syrian Arabs. Resentful of their Turkish
overseers at the best of times—and these weren’t the best of times in
the Ottoman world—it was highly probable that these Arab units would
quickly collapse at the first sign of an Allied landing, perhaps even
switch sides.</p>
<p>In fact, Djemal Pasha’s anxiety over Alexandretta had already led him
to commit a singularly reckless act. Desperate to mask the city’s abject
vulnerability, it was he who had issued the threat to execute British
prisoners back in December when HMS Doris stood offshore. Now, in the
wake of Suez, the Syrian governor was sure the British would turn to
Turkey’s Achilles’ heel once more, and this time there would be no
negotiating, no way to stop them.</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THERE have been occasions when a vastly superior
military force has managed, against all odds, to snatch defeat from all
but certain victory. The phenomenon usually has root in one of three
causes: arrogance, such a blinding belief in one’s own military or
cultural superiority as to fail to take the enemy seriously; political
interference; or tunnel vision, that curious tendency among war planners
and generals to believe a flawed approach might be rectified simply by
pouring more men and firepower into the fray. In early 1915, the British
military would navigate its way to a fiasco of such colossal proportions
as to require all three of these factors to work in concert.</p>
<p>With the brushing back of the Turkish assault on the Suez on February
3, Lawrence and other members of the intelligence unit in Cairo assumed
that plans for a landing at Alexandretta would immediately get under
way. Instead, the war strategists in London had already begun focusing
on a different spot on the Ottoman coastline: the Dardanelles strait
below Constantinople.</p>
<p>One of the earth’s more peculiar natural formations, the Dardanelles
is a narrow, fjordlike waterway flanked by the Turkish Asian mainland on
its eastern bank and the mountainous Gallipoli peninsula on its western.
After a twisting thirty-mile-long course between the mountains, the
gorge opens up at its northern confluence to the inland Sea of Marmara,
at the far end of which lies Constantinople, or modern-day Istanbul. For
obvious reasons, the southern entrance to the Dardanelles, letting onto
the Mediterranean, has always been regarded as the maritime gateway to
that city, and since ancient times every civilization that has
controlled the region has maintained fortifications there. The Ottoman
forts that dotted the high slopes above the strait in early 1915 had
been erected on the ruins of Byzantine forts, which in turn had been
built on the ruins of Greek and Roman ones.</p>
<p>“Forcing the Narrows” had been an alluring notion for British war
planners ever since Turkey came into the war, and for none more so than
the first lord of the admiralty, Winston Churchill. As he repeatedly
pointed out to the British cabinet—often to the point of tiresomeness,
as was his style—with a defenseless Constantinople lying just to the
north of that strait, here lay the chance to swiftly decapitate their
Turkish adversaries and take them out of the war. Further arguing for a
Dardanelles breakthrough was an appeal for aid from Russia, hard pressed
by German and Austro-Hungarian forces in the north. With Russia’s
northern ports either iced in or patrolled by marauding German U-boats,
the only possible maritime route for such aid, Churchill argued, was
from the south.</p>
<p>As consensus for a Dardanelles naval operation grew in London, those
in Cairo advocating an Alexandretta landing found themselves
increasingly outmaneuvered; with the Royal Navy focused on the former,
they were told, it would be spread too thin to support an operation in
the latter. On its face, this contention was absurd. Even the most
pessimistic War Office assessment had concluded that Alexandretta could
be seized by about 20,000 troops—far more than the two to three thousand
envisioned by Lawrence, but still a pittance compared with the numbers
idly staring across no-man’s-land on the Western Front. The real issue
was institutional myopia. Since the Dardanelles had now become the first
priority in the Near East, any action at Alexandretta fell under the
classification of a diversion, and among senior British war planners,
with their nineteenth-century notions of massing all available force at
a single point, diversion was shorthand for distraction.</p>
<p>Joined to this was stone-cold arrogance. Turkey was a third-rate
power, its soldiers ill-fed, ill-trained, poorly armed, and mutinous. In
just the past five years, they had been beaten by the Italians, the
Bulgarians, the Greeks, the Serbs, and the Montenegrins. Most recently,
they had been swatted away from the Suez Canal and slaughtered by the
Russians at the battle of Sarikamish in eastern Turkey. “Taking the
Turkish Army as a whole,” one British officer had reported to his
superiors in November 1914, “I should say it was [a] militia only
moderately trained, and composed as a rule of tough but slow-witted
peasants as liable to panic before the unexpected as most uneducated
men.” Just what chance did this rabble have against the might of the
British Empire? Ergo, why nip at their heels at Alexandretta when they
could be beheaded at Constantinople?</p>
<p>But there was an altogether different issue at play as well, one that
had nothing to do with military strategies or hubris and everything to
do with politics. Since the start of the war, the French had laid claim
to Syria, a spoils-of-war prize that it would take possession of once
the conflict ended. Even though the Alexandretta enclave fell just
outside the generally recognized borders of greater Syria, all the
British talk of the Syrian uprising that was sure to follow an
Alexandretta landing—talk, ironically enough, that Lawrence himself had
done much to generate in his reports to London—made the French extremely
edgy. Put simply, if there was to be an Allied move into the Syrian
region, the French wanted to be in on it from the outset in order to
take control of the situation. That was understandable as far as the
argument went, perhaps, but then came the kicker: since France, hard
pressed on the Western Front, had no troops to spare for such an
enterprise, it meant that the entire region, including Alexandretta,
should be militarily off-limits even to its allies.</p>
<p>Whether justified or not, in Lawrence’s mind it was this French
objection, far more than British War Office shortsightedness, that
scuttled the Alexandretta plan. In mid-February, as word of the French
position circulated among the stunned Savoy Hotel intelligence staff, he
wrote a short letter to his parents in which he bitterly noted, “So far
as Syria is concerned, it is France and not Turkey that is the
enemy.”</p>
<p>Initially, however, it appeared that Lawrence’s indignation might be
misplaced, and the Dardanelles gambit a success. On February 19, a joint
British and French flotilla appeared off the southern entrance to the
strait and with their long-range guns proceeded to shell the Turkish
fortresses there at will. With the Turks able to muster only token
return fire, most of their outer forts were soon pounded to rubble,
leading the British fleet commander to confidently predict that by
methodically working its way up the strait and destroying whatever
Turkish fortifications remained, his armada might reach Constantinople
within two weeks’ time. That city’s residents clearly agreed with him.
As the Allied fleet sailed off to resupply for the big push,
Constantinople’s imminent fall seemed such a foregone conclusion that
the nation’s gold reserves were rushed to a safe haven in the Turkish
interior, and many senior government officials quietly hatched personal
contingency plans to flee.</p>
<p>One who didn’t share this view was T. E. Lawrence. To the contrary,
holding out hope that until the Dardanelles operation got under way in
earnest there might still be a chance to overrule the French, he used
the lull after the February 19 bombardments to continue pushing for an
Alexandretta landing, but to little avail. With the senior British
military command now deaf to his arguments, he finally reached out to
the one person he knew who was well connected to the British political
hierarchy, David Hogarth.</p>
<p>Although Lawrence had always assumed an informal, collegial tone with
his mentor, his letter to Hogarth on March 18 was of a very different
order: beseeching, even demanding. After outlining the crucial
importance of taking Alexandretta—“the key of the whole place, as you
know”—and warning of the danger should it fall into the hands of any
other power, he all but gave Hogarth a set of marching orders to combat
the various forces lined up against the plan: “Can you get someone to
suggest to Winston [Churchill] that there is a petrol spring on the
beach (very favourably advised on by many engineers, but concessions
always refused by the Turks), huge iron deposits near Durt Yol 10 miles
to the north and coal also.… Then go to the F.O. [Foreign Office] if
possible. Point out that in [the] Baghdad Convention, France gave up
Alexandretta to [the] Germans, and agreed that it formed no part of
Syria. Swear that it doesn’t form part of Syria—and you know it speaks
Turkish.… By occupying Alexandretta with 10,000 men we are
impregnable.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Hogarth actually had the clout to execute such
instructions, it was already too late. On the very day Lawrence sent his
letter, March 18, the Allied fleet returned to the mouth of the
Dardanelles to resume their bombardment campaign. This time, matters
didn’t go at all as planned.</p>
<p>For the first three hours, the Allied armada pounded away at the
coastal forts with much the same ease as in February. The trouble
started when the first line of ships was commanded to fall back to make
room for the second. During the February bombardment, the Turks had
taken note of an odd habit of the Allied fleet, that when reversing
course they almost invariably turned their ships to starboard; on the
chance that this tradition would continue, they had recently laid a
single string of mines in an inlet the Allies would traverse on a
starboard turn. Sure enough, at about 2 p.m. the retiring Allied first
line steered directly into the minefield. In quick succession, three
warships were sunk, and three more heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Although the term “mission creep,” with all its negative
connotations, didn’t exist in 1915, it probably should have. In
analyzing the March 18 minefield fiasco, British war planners came to
the reasonable conclusion that the Dardanelles couldn’t be cleared by
sea power alone. What they failed to conclude was that the campaign
should be abandoned in favor of something different. To the contrary,
the Allies were now going to double down, with the naval effort at the
strait to be augmented by a ground offensive.</p>
<p>It would be some time before anyone realized it, but that decision
was to be one of the most fateful of World War I, ultimately
extinguishing any hope that the conflict in the Middle East—and by
extension, that in Europe—might be brought to an early end. In the
interim, the regime in Constantinople, which just days earlier had been
flirting with abandoning the capital, was given a new lease on life as
the Allies again paused operations in order to cobble their ground force
together.</p>
<p>IN THE MIDWINTER of 1915, the Standard Oil Company of New York
finally decided what to do with William Yale. Releasing him from Cairo,
that modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah so assaultive to his Yankee
sensibilities, he was ordered to return to Constantinople.</p>
<p>With greater cunning than perhaps any other international
corporation, Socony had looked upon the unfolding tragedy of World War I
and been determined to play it to their advantage. In fact, in the very
first days of the war it had come up with a plan whereby it might supply
the petroleum needs of both warring European blocs by reflagging its
tankers to the registry of neutral nations. While that scheme had been
exposed, Yale discovered that Socony had now devised an ingenious new
system to smuggle oil to Turkey through neutral Bulgaria. But this was
minor compared with what Standard was planning next, and it was to
achieve that greater plan that Yale had been brought back to Turkey.</p>
<p>What the bosses at 26 Broadway had come to realize was that so long
as the Europe-wide war continued—and, just as crucially, so long as the
United States kept out of it—they had the vast territories of the
Ottoman Empire practically to themselves. With their British, French,
and Russian competitors boxed out until the war ended, they now had a
golden opportunity to grab up as many oil concessions in the Near East
as they desired—and since they were the only major company still in
operation in the region, they could do so at rock-bottom prices. The
scheme traded on Turkey’s desperate need for oil, a vital commodity if
it was to have any hope of competing militarily. The oil coming through
Socony’s Bulgarian smuggling operation was a pittance compared with what
was needed, and to meet this need Standard held out a possible solution:
Palestine.</p>
<p>In various geological studies going back to the late 1800s, data
suggested that central Palestine might well be the site of one of the
world’s great untapped oil reservoirs. The mapping team that William
Yale had been a part of in 1913–14 had examined only a tiny portion of
that area, some forty-five thousand acres, limited as it was by the
boundaries of the concessionary zones. Standard wanted to massively
increase its Palestine holdings, and it now saw a way to make that
happen.</p>
<p>Just prior to Yale’s return, Socony officials in Constantinople had
told the Ottoman government that after careful consideration, they had
regretfully concluded that the area covered by their seven concessions
in Kornub was simply too small to be financially viable to exploit. If
such a conclusion seemed odd coming so soon after Socony had embarked on
a massive effort to develop those concessions, a naturally more pressing
question for an oil-starved regime in the midst of a war was, just how
many more acres did Standard feel they needed? The answer: a half
million more, or, put in more tangible terms, pretty much the entire
breadth of central Judea from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean, an area
covering about one-tenth of the current state of Israel.</p>
<p>Except there was a key detail in all this that Socony saw no reason
to trouble the Turks with. It had no intention of actually drilling for
oil, let alone refining it, until after the war was over. Its sole goal
was to use the “golden hour” that the war afforded to lock up those
500,000 acres for the future, a future that, provided the right pressure
was brought to bear on the right diplomats and politicians, wouldn’t
depend in any way on which side eventually won.</p>
<p>As the Socony employee with the most experience in Palestine, William
Yale was to be the point man for getting control of that land. The first
job at hand, though, was to change Turkey’s mining laws; these were
archaic and complex and an impediment to the kind of land grab Standard
was hoping to achieve. To this end, the Constantinople Socony office set
to work compiling a comprehensive set of new mining-law recommendations
for the Turkish parliament—an undertaking eased by their having put the
secretary of the Turkish senate on their payroll—and also placed Yale on
the drafting committee. In just this way, the twenty-seven-year-old
Yale, less than eighteen months removed from his roustabout duties in an
Oklahoma oilfield, became instrumental in rewriting the commercial laws
of a foreign empire.</p>
<p>THE GERMAN HOSPICE is a magnificent building of yellow stone and
slate that sits on the ridgeline of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.
Today its austere lines are softened by the cypress and pine trees that
surround it, but when it was constructed in the early 1900s, under the
orders and specifications of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, its bare
grounds and prominent position on the ridge gave it more than a passing
resemblance to a Bavarian castle.</p>
<p>Built to accommodate German pilgrims and clergy visiting the Holy
Land, the hospice has the feel of a particularly pleasant medieval
monastery, rough-stone stairways connecting its different floors, open
internal passageways giving onto views of its cloistered gardens. On the
ground floor is a great chapel made of stone, its fusion of stained
glass windows and Moorish-style archways reminiscent of the Great
Cathedral in Córdoba. So grand is the hospice that Djemal Pasha chose to
make it his Jerusalem headquarters during World War I, the city where he
and his German liaison officer, Curt Prüfer, returned after their
ill-fated Suez sojourn in February 1915.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, the governor quickly became known for exhibiting a
degree of irritability in the administration of his office. His new
personal secretary, a twenty-one-year-old reserve officer named Falih
Rifki, caught a glimpse of this on the first day he showed up for work
at the hospice in the winter of 1915. Ushered into Djemal’s inner
sanctum, Rifki watched as the governor briskly signed his way through a
high stack of papers placed before him and then taken away by three
attending officers, oblivious to the twenty or so other men who stood in
one corner of the room, pale and trembling with fear. When Djemal at
last finished with his paperwork and turned to the clustered men, elders
from the Palestinian town of Nablus, it was to ask if they understood
the gravity of their unspecified crimes. The Nablus elders, apparently
not appreciating that the question was meant to be rhetorical, began to
protest their innocence and plead for mercy.</p>
<p>“Silence!” Djemal thundered. “Do you know what the punishment is for
these crimes? Execution! Execution!” He let that news sink in for a bit,
before continuing in a calmer tone, “But you may thank God for the
sublime mercy of the Ottoman state. For the moment I shall content
myself with exiling you and your families to Anatolia.”</p>
<p>After the men had offered their profuse thanks and been hustled out,
Djemal turned to Rifki with a shrug. “What can one do? That’s how we get
things done here.”</p>
<p>The episode rather exemplified Djemal Pasha’s managerial style, a man
for whom the term “mercurial” might have been coined. Forever
oscillating between raging severity and gentle magnanimity, often within
the same conversation, he kept everyone around him permanently off
balance, incapable of predicting his likely response to a situation.
Howard Bliss, the president of the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut,
recalled a meeting between Djemal and a favor-seeking Briton at which
the governor bluntly refused every request made of him, until a sealed
envelope was opportunely delivered by an aide. Reading the contents,
Djemal broke into a broad smile.</p>
<p>“I now can grant all your requests,” he announced. “I have just
received a decoration from the Czar of Bulgaria, and at such times I
always grant the first favors presented.”</p>
<p>One effect of this style, of course, was that issues were never truly
resolved; knowing that most any harsh edict might be countermanded or,
conversely, a granted favor soon rescinded, petitioners learned to
beseech Djemal for consideration when he was reported to be in a good
mood—or, trusting in the law of averages, to simply beseech him
repeatedly.</p>
<p>In his defense, though, it’s not as if the Syrian governor didn’t
have a lot of things to be irritable about. Indeed, by the middle of
March 1915 he was buffeted by such an array of crises as might cause the
most cheerful person to feel a bit put-upon. Under the circumstances,
the first of these crises, manifested on the morning of March 22,
bordered on the perverse: locusts.</p>
<p>The Spanish consul in Jerusalem, a dapper young man named Antonio de
la Cierva, Conde de Ballobar, happened to be working in his office that
morning when he noticed the sky suddenly darken dramatically, as if
there were occurring a solar eclipse. “Upon peeking out from the balcony
I saw that an immense cloud had completely obscured the light of the
sun.” As Ballobar watched, the cloud descended, revealed itself to be
millions upon millions of locusts. “The ground, the balconies, the
roofs, the entire city and then the countryside, everything was covered
by these wretched little animals.”</p>
<p>Just as quickly as it had appeared, the horde moved on, headed east
toward Jericho, but in subsequent days, reports of the locust plague
started coming in from across the breadth of central Palestine. They
told of entire orchards and fields stripped bare of every leaf and
seedling within hours, of farm animals and briefly unattended infants
being blinded, the insects feeding on the liquid in their eyes.</p>
<p>The Holy Land had experienced locust plagues in the past, but nothing
in modern memory compared to this. Nor could it have come at a worse
moment. Joined to the pressures of the war effort—tens of thousands of
Syrian farmers had been drafted, the requisitioning of farm animals and
machinery had been wanton—the pestilence was sure to make an already
troubled spring planting season infinitely worse, and cause massive food
shortages and price increases. Indeed, Consul Ballobar noted, within
hours of the locust swarm touching down in Jerusalem, wheat prices in
the city’s bazaars had spiked.</p>
<p>True to his self-image as a reformer, Djemal Pasha didn’t form a
committee or appoint some toady to deal with the problem, the typical
Ottoman response to a crisis. Instead, he immediately summoned Syria’s
most celebrated agricultural scientist, the thirty-nine-year-old Jewish
émigré Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>The meeting between the two fiercely headstrong men took place on
March 27 and, per Djemal’s preference, was conducted in French. It got
off to a rocky start. Along with outlining the modern techniques that
could be used to combat the infestation, Aaronsohn took the opportunity
to bluntly criticize the army’s wholesale requisitions that had left the
region on the brink of ruin even before the locusts appeared. According
to the story Aaronsohn would later tell, the governor finally
interrupted his tirade with a simple question: “What if I were to have
you hanged?”</p>
<p>In a clever retort, alluding to both his considerable girth and to
his network of influential friends abroad, the agronomist replied, “Your
Excellency, the weight of my body would break the gallows with a noise
loud enough to be heard in America.”</p>
<p>Djemal apparently liked that answer. Before the ending of their
meeting, he had appointed Aaronsohn inspector in chief of a new locust
eradication program, and granted him near-dictatorial powers to carry it
out. If any petty officials got in Aaronsohn’s way, the governor let it
be known, they would have to answer to him.</p>
<p>But if the locust plague could be delegated to an expert, that was
not the case with Djemal’s other concerns that March.</p>
<p>For some time he had been sitting on information that suggested the
empire’s “Arab problem” might be far more serious than anyone in
Constantinople appreciated, that in Syria they might be sitting on
something of a volcano.</p>
<p>Shortly after Turkey joined the war in November, a unit of Turkish
counterintelligence officers had broken into the shuttered French
consulate in Beirut, and there they had found a passel of documents in a
concealed wall safe. Those papers laid bare a long-standing secret
relationship between the French consul and a number of Arab leaders in
Beirut and Damascus opposed to the Young Turk government. Not just
opposed; many of the proposals these men had put to the French
consul—for Syrian independence, for a French protectorate in
Lebanon—were nothing short of traitorous.</p>
<p>But administering a corrective to the querulous Nablus elders had
been one thing; moving against the Beirut and Damascus consulate
plotters was a good deal trickier. Many were well known throughout the
Arab world, and their execution or exile might provoke the very Arab
rebellion Turkey sought to avoid. It might also raise alarm in the
greater Arab Muslim world, including in the “captive” lands of Egypt and
French North Africa, just when Constantinople was trying to stir these
communities to the cause of pan-Islamic jihad. Consequently, Djemal had
seen no choice but to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Tucking the Beirut
dossier away in his Damascus office, he had endeavored to keep the
malcontents close by feigning normalcy and reverting to the old Ottoman
standby of handing out sinecures and honorary positions. That tactic
might ultimately win the plotters to his side, or conversely reveal how
extensive their conspiratorial circles actually were, but it was still
worrisome to have these traitors at large at the very moment that an
Allied invasion of Syria had suddenly grown more likely.</p>
<p>But in Syria, every problem had its counterproblem. Whereas the
Beirut dissidents consisted almost exclusively of so-called
progressives, Arab urban liberals infused with European ideas of
nationalism and self-determination, in late March Djemal also faced a
crisis with Arab conservatives, those spurred to outrage by the Young
Turks’ modernist—and, to their eyes, secularist—reforms. This
conservative crisis was about to quite literally show up at the
governor’s door in the form of a soft-spoken thirty-one-year-old man
named Sheikh Faisal ibn Hussein.</p>
<p>Faisal was the third of four sons of Emir Hussein, a tribal leader in
the immense Hejaz region of western Arabia. Of much greater import,
Faisal’s father was the sherif, or religious leader, of the Muslim holy
cities of Mecca and Medina, the most recent scion of the Hashemite clan
that had served as the guardians of the Islamic holy land since the
tenth century.</p>
<p>Relations between the Young Turks and Emir Hussein had been strained
from the very outset, and time had done nothing to improve matters.
Almost medieval in his conservatism, over the years Hussein had viewed
the stream of liberalist edicts emanating from Constantinople with
ever-deepening antipathy; his discontent ranged from the Young Turks’
emancipation of women and promotion of minority rights, to its chipping
away at the civic authority of religious leaders, even to its efforts to
curb slavery, still a common practice in the Hejaz. Tellingly, the most
tangible focus of Emir Hussein’s rancor was the proposed extension of
the Hejaz Railway from Medina to Mecca. Far from viewing the extension
as a sign of progress, a way to ease the travel of Muslim pilgrims
making the hajj to the holy city, Hussein saw it as a Trojan horse for
Constantinople to exert greater control over the region, and
specifically over him. The result had been an endless series of clashes
between the Constantinople-appointed Hejaz civilian governors and the
emir and his sons.</p>
<p>The tensions had only grown worse—and the consequences obviously far
graver—since Turkey came into the war. Given that he was one of the most
respected religious figures in the Muslim world, Hussein’s noncommittal
response to the call to jihad in November was quickly noted by all, and
was viewed as a major reason for its tepid effect thus far. Similarly,
appeals for national unity in the war effort had done nothing to bring
about a rapprochement in the long-standing feud between Ali, Hussein’s
eldest son, and the current governor of Medina, a feud that at times had
come close to open combat. Then there had been the emir’s feeble
response to Djemal’s request for volunteers to join in the Suez assault.
Instead of the thousands of tribal fighters the regime had counted on,
Abdullah, Hussein’s second son, had shown up in Syria with a mere
handful.</p>
<p>Yet despite all this provocation, Hussein and his sons had to be
handled with even greater delicacy than the Beirut malcontents. If from
a narrow military standpoint the Hejaz lacked the strategic importance
of Syria—it consisted of a few small cities surrounded by vast deserts
at the farthest fringe of the empire—the Hashemite emir’s singular
ability to bestow or deny his religious blessing on Constantinople’s
actions gave him extraordinary power. Thus a kind of standoff ensued.
Obviously, the Young Turks either wanted Hussein to fall in line or to
be rid of him, but to move against him in too crude a fashion was to
invite a ferocious conservative backlash. For his part, Hussein had to
know that there was a limit to the Young Turks’ patience, that pushing
them too far was to invite in the soldiers.</p>
<p>That standoff had recently experienced a perilous rupture. In
January, Hussein’s eldest son, Ali, claimed to have uncovered a plot by
the governor of Medina to overthrow Hussein and replace him with a more
pliant religious figure. This was the reason for Faisal’s impending
arrival in Syria. Emir Hussein was sending him out of the deserts of
Arabia to confront the Constantinople regime, both to express his
outrage at the overthrow plot and to demand that the provincial governor
be removed.</p>
<p>But here, at last, was something approximating good news for Djemal
Pasha, for if there was anyone within the troublesome Hussein family who
he felt might be the voice of reason, it was Faisal. Like his older
brothers, Faisal had been raised and educated within the sultan’s inner
court in Constantinople, but it appeared this civilizing influence had
taken special hold in Hussein’s unassuming third son. In Faisal there
was a caution, even a timidity, that might be exploited with gentle
words and charm—and though the unlucky Nablus elders hauled into his
office might have gone away with a differing opinion, charm was
something of a Djemal specialty. When Faisal and his retinue rolled into
town, the governor intended to greet him with all the pomp and fanfare
of a visiting dignitary.</p>
<p>LESS THAN A mile away from the German Hospice, at the German military
headquarters in downtown Jerusalem, Curt Prüfer also took a keen
interest in the imminent arrival of Faisal ibn Hussein. He had a rather
harder-edged view, however, of how to win the Hussein family to the
Turco-German cause. Back in October 1914, even before Djemal Pasha’s
arrival in Syria, Prüfer had dispatched his own spies to the Hejaz to
get a sense of where Emir Hussein’s true loyalties lay. His conclusion,
as he’d reported to Max von Oppenheim in early November, was that the
emir in Mecca was essentially on the payroll of British Egypt and thus
“English through and through.”</p>
<p>Beyond his obvious political and religious differences with the Young
Turks, the problem with Hussein extended to geography. One of the most
isolated and impoverished regions of the Ottoman Empire, the Hejaz had
an economy that was almost wholly dependent on the annual hajj, or
pilgrimage, by the Muslim faithful to Mecca, the bulk of whom came from
either India or Egypt. The arid Hejaz also relied on imported grain to
feed its people, and much of that came across the Red Sea from Egypt or
British Sudan in the form of government-subsidized religious offerings.
With the British navy’s undisputed control of the Red Sea, it would be a
simple matter to cut off both the pilgrim traffic and food supplies to
the Hejaz, an action that would quickly take the region to utter ruin.
This was the sword that hung over his head, Hussein had intimated to
Constantinople, and the underlying reason why he had to tread so
carefully before the regime’s demands.</p>
<p>But to Curt Prüfer it was all a rather outrageous bluff. Put simply,
the British would never risk incurring the wrath of the Muslim world by
starving out, let alone invading, the Islamic holy land; Germany should
be so lucky. At the same time, Hussein, as the guardian of Mecca and
Medina, wouldn’t dare go over to the British, for that same Muslim wrath
would then be directed at him. Instead, the wily old emir in Mecca was
playing both sides, keeping the British at bay—and their food subsidies
and pilgrim traffic intact—through advertising his differences with
Constantinople, and keeping Constantinople at bay through touting the
contrived British threat.</p>
<p>The problem was, the Turks would not challenge Hussein nor allow
their allies to do so. Since arriving in the region, Prüfer and the
other German intelligence agents had been explicitly forbidden from
involving themselves in Hejazi affairs in any way. Even during Faisal’s
upcoming visit, Djemal intended to screen the young sheikh from his
German advisors as much as possible. Instead, the Syrian governor would
undoubtedly pursue the same course the Young Turks had adopted with the
Hussein family for the past six years—solicitousness and flattery
blended with veiled threats—and to the same negligible effect.</p>
<p>What made all this especially maddening to Prüfer was that Hussein
was one of the linchpins in bringing the pan-Islamic jihad to full
flower. Without the Hashemite leader’s blessing, that fatwa remained a
concoction of the Young Turk regime; with his blessing, fires might be
ignited throughout the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p>In his November report to Oppenheim, Prüfer had concluded that the
emir was “luckily powerless and in our hands.” The challenge now was to
convince everyone else—Djemal, the Young Turks in Constantinople,
Hussein himself—that this was true.</p>
<p>THERE IS LITTLE indication that Lawrence was following events in the
Arabian Peninsula, or was even aware of them, during his first few
months with the intelligence unit in Cairo—understandable given his
almost obsessive focus on Syria. That changed when he made the
acquaintance of Ronald Storrs, the British Oriental secretary to
Egypt.</p>
<p>With his pencil-thin mustache and fondness for white linen suits,
Storrs cut a dandyish figure among the predominantly uniformed British
population of wartime Cairo, a Cambridge-educated aesthete with an
encyclopedic knowledge of opera, Renaissance art, and classical
literature. Shipping out to Egypt as a young man, he had passed through
a number of positions in the British administration there before winning
appointment as Oriental secretary in 1909 at the age of
twenty-eight.</p>
<p>It was a position he was born for. Along with being a decorous
presence at the official receptions and galas of which the British
community in Cairo was especially fond, Storrs acted as the right-hand
man of the resident British consul general to Egypt, a behind-the-scenes
monitor of the nation’s myriad political intrigues. His star had risen
considerably when Lord Kitchener assumed that post in 1911. Quickly
coming to regard Storrs as his most trusted lieutenant—the Oriental
secretary had been instrumental in torpedoing Curt Prüfer’s appointment
to the khedival library directorship, for example—Kitchener had
maintained their relationship even after his appointment to war
secretary in August 1914. Since he fully intended to return to his
Egyptian post once the war was over, Kitchener had left his protégé
behind in Cairo to serve as his eyes and ears.</p>
<p>But there was rather more to it than that. In Kitchener’s service,
Ronald Storrs was the crucial conduit in a game of political intrigue so
sensitive it was known to only a handful of men in Cairo, London, and
Mecca, the possessor of perhaps the most dangerous secret in the Middle
East. By befriending T. E. Lawrence and bringing him in on that secret,
Storrs would set the young intelligence officer on the course that was
to bring him fame and glory.</p>
<p>At least initially, that friendship was based on the supremely
ordinary, a mutual love of classical literature. As the rather fusty
Storrs related of Lawrence in his memoir, “We had no literary
differences, except that he preferred Homer to Dante and disliked my
preference for Theocritus before Aristophanes.”</p>
<p>At some point in the winter of 1915, their discussions turned to more
current topics, specifically to the covert mission that Storrs was
conducting for Lord Kitchener.</p>
<p>The story had begun a year earlier, in February 1914, when Abdullah
ibn Hussein, the thirty-two-year-old second son of Emir Hussein of
Mecca, came calling in Cairo. While the emir’s disenchantment with the
Constantinople regime was becoming fairly common knowledge by that
point, Abdullah pushed matters into a whole new realm; granted a brief
meeting with Kitchener, he attempted to sound out the consul general on
what British reaction would be to an outright Arab revolt in the
Hejaz.</p>
<p>Kitchener took pains to sidestep the query. After all, Britain and
Turkey were still at peace then, and it simply wouldn’t do for the
former to encourage revolt in the latter. When Abdullah returned to
Cairo two months later hoping for a second meeting, Kitchener foisted
him off on his Oriental secretary.</p>
<p>Whatever limited subtlety Abdullah had managed with Kitchener, it was
absent from his meeting with Storrs. “I found myself being asked
categorically whether Britain would present the Grand Sharif [Hussein]
with a dozen, or even a half dozen machine guns,” Storrs recalled. “When
I enquired what could possibly be their purpose, he replied (like all
rearmers) for defence; and, pressed further, added that the defence
would be against attack from the Turks. I needed no special instructions
to inform him that we could never entertain the idea of supplying arms
to be used against a friendly power.”</p>
<p>But that second meeting with Abdullah had been in April 1914, and by
the following September, matters had changed a great deal. As he waited
to see if Turkey would come into the war, now–War Secretary Kitchener
had reason to recall his earlier conversation with Hussein’s son and to
appreciate that he might have a unique opportunity awaiting him in
Arabia. Rather than work through senior officials in the British
military or civilian administrations in Egypt, Kitchener sent an
encrypted cable to his old Cairo office: “Tell Storrs to send secret and
carefully chosen messenger from me to the Sharif Abdullah to ascertain
whether, should present German influence in Constantinople coerce
[Turkey into] … war against Great Britain, he and his father and Arabs
of the Hejaz would be with us or against us.”</p>
<p>Hussein’s reply, which arrived just as Turkey joined the war, was
tantalizing. While stating that he would endeavor to stay neutral,
Hussein hinted that with sufficient external support and concrete
promises from Britain to stay out of internal Arabian affairs, he might
lead his “immediate followers into revolt.”</p>
<p>Seizing on that prospect, Kitchener swiftly sent another message that
dramatically upped the ante. Should the Arabs join with Britain, rather
than merely stay neutral, Kitchener wrote, “Great Britain will guarantee
the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifate against all
external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till
now we have defended and befriended Islam in the person of the Turks
[sic]; henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arab.”</p>
<p>But then Hussein seemed to equivocate somewhat. In his next letter,
received by Storrs in December, the emir repeated his intention to
“avoid any action detrimental to the British,” but also indicated that
any outright break with Turkey would have to wait until sometime in the
indefinite future. And there the matter rested. In the months since
Hussein had sent that last message, there had been no word out of
Mecca.</p>
<p>To Lawrence, the details of this secret correspondence with Hussein
came as something of a revelation. Since arriving in Cairo, he had
devoted great energy to gauging the possibility of an Arab revolt in
Syria, a revolt that, almost by definition, would be reliant on
so-called progressives: businessmen and intellectuals disaffected by the
corruption of the Constantinople regime, minorities yearning for
equality, Arab officers and conscripts frustrated by the military’s
Turkish chauvinism. Of conservative Arabia he knew virtually
nothing.</p>
<p>Yet from a political standpoint, Lawrence quickly appreciated the
Hejazi potential. An alliance with Hussein would inoculate the British
against the charge that it was fomenting rebellion as a means of taking
over the Middle East; as guardian of the holy cities, it would be quite
unthinkable to most Muslims that Emir Hussein had entered a partnership
with land-grabbing infidels. To the contrary, a revolt starting in the
Hejaz and under his leadership would carry the imprimatur of religious
sanction, neatly nullifying the Islam-versus-Crusaders propaganda being
promoted by the Turks and Max von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>But trying to assess where things stood in the absence of any new
communication from Hussein was a perplexing process. On the one hand, he
did appear to be living up to his promise of neutrality, as evidenced by
his continuing noncommittal stance on the call to jihad. On the other
hand, he had recently sent his third son, Faisal, to meet with Djemal
Pasha in Syria, and to then proceed to Constantinople for more meetings
with the Young Turk leadership. Since Faisal was generally considered to
be the most moderate and sober-minded of Hussein’s sons, the obvious
conclusion was that Hussein was inching his way back toward a
rapprochement with Constantinople and that the brief, tantalizing
prospect of an Arab revolt in the Hejaz had slipped from British
hands.</p>
<p>For his part, Lawrence soon had far more pressing concerns than
trying to read the tea leaves of Hejazi politics. By early April 1915,
all attention in British Egypt had turned to the upcoming naval and
ground offensive against the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>DURING THE FIRST weeks of April, a vast flotilla of ships began to
assemble along the northern coast of Egypt, while in the tent cities
that dotted the shoreline, tens of thousands of soldiers were kept busy
hauling supplies and practicing combat drills. They were members of the
newly formed Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (Med-Ex for short) soon
to be on their way to strike at the head and heart of the Turkish enemy.
Despite the tedium of their wait, the mood of the troops was exuberant,
keen.</p>
<p>With T. E. Lawrence, the sentiment was foreboding. The trepidation he
had felt from the outset of the Dardanelles operation only deepened
after he and other members of the Cairo intelligence unit were sent up
to the staging area to brief its commanders on what they might expect at
the other end. “The Med-Ex came out, beastly ill-prepared,” Lawrence
wrote David Hogarth on April 20, “with no knowledge of where it was
going, or what it would meet, or what it was going to do.” Most shocking
of all to Lawrence, to plot their ground offensive, the Med-Ex senior
staff had arrived in Egypt with exactly two copies of an obsolete
quarter-inch-to-the-mile map of the Dardanelles region.</p>
<p>But when it came to committing folly, British war planners were just
warming up. The principal landing zones for Med-Ex, it had been decided,
would be on the Gallipoli peninsula, that thin ribbon of rugged
mountains that forms the Dardanelles’ western shore. Rarely more than
six or seven miles across, the peninsula runs northward for some fifty
miles before finally broadening out onto the European mainland. In
selecting where to go ashore, the British could have chosen any number
of spots along Gallipoli’s length where a ground force, once gaining the
ridgeline and climbing down to the opposite shore—a distance of less
than three miles in places—would have split the Ottoman army in two and
trapped any enemy forces positioned below that line. Of course, the best
option might have been to sidestep the peninsula completely and put in
at the Gulf of Saros at its northern end. An invasion force coming
ashore in that broad bay would not only maroon all the Turkish troops
garrisoned on Gallipoli, but would then have a virtually unimpeded path
through easy countryside to Constantinople, just 100 miles away. This
was certainly the greatest fear of General Liman von Sanders, the German
commander recently appointed by the Turkish government to oversee the
Dardanelles defense; in anticipation of a landing at Saros, he had
placed his headquarters and fully a third of his army there.</p>
<p>The one possibility that Sanders tended to discount entirely was a
landing at Gallipoli’s southern tip, simply because the most basic rules
of military logic—even mere common sense—argued against it. Not only
would a landing force there be vulnerable to defenders dug in on the
heights above them, but completely exposed to whatever long-range
Turkish artillery remained operable in their nearby fortresses. And even
if such a force managed to scale the heights and seize those forts, the
Turkish defenders could then begin a slow withdrawal up the peninsula,
throwing up new trenchlines as they went, neatly replicating the static
trench warfare that had so paralyzed the armies on the Western Front.
Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a worse landing site most
anywhere on the three-thousand-mile-long Mediterranean coast of the
Ottoman Empire—yet it was precisely here that Med-Ex was going
ashore.</p>
<p>Along with condescension for the enemy, always a perilous mind-set
for an army, that decision was apparently born of sheer bureaucratic
obduracy. Since the Dardanelles campaign had been conceived as a naval
operation, the success or failure of the expanded mission would continue
to be judged through the narrow lens of its original objective—clearing
the straits—leaving its planners quite blind to the idea of trying a
different approach that might ultimately achieve the same end.
Incredibly, it seems the Gallipoli strategists had less rejected
alternative landing sites than never seriously considered them.</p>
<p>In late April, the Med-Ex soldiers on the Egyptian coast began piling
into the troopships that would take them across the eastern
Mediterranean to Gallipoli. Lawrence, looking back over his failed
efforts of the previous months, not just Alexandretta but a range of
other schemes that he and the Cairo intelligence unit had concocted only
to see shelved, could scarcely conceal his anger in another letter to
Hogarth:</p>
<p>“Arabian affairs have gone all to pot. I’ve never seen a more
despicable mess made of a show. It makes one howl with fury, for we had
a ripping chance there.” He ended on a somewhat forlorn note: “Push on
A[lexandretta] therefore, if you can; it seems to me the only thing left
for us.”</p>
<p>When he wrote that letter, on April 26, Lawrence did not know how bad
the mess was about to become. Just the day before, Med-Ex had gone
ashore at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>AT ABOUT 6:15 on the morning of April 25, SS River Clyde, a converted
collier out of Liverpool, closed on a small, gently arcing
beach—code-named V Beach—at Cape Helles, the southern tip of the
Gallipoli peninsula. Crammed belowdecks were some two thousand British
soldiers. Coming in on the gentle seas alongside the Clyde were five or
six launches, each towing several open cutters, likewise crammed to
their gunwales with more soldiers. At about one hundred yards out, the
cutter skippers cast off their towlines and distributed oars so that
their crews might row the rest of the way to shore. From that shore came
no sign of life at all. It appeared, just as hoped, that the landing at
Cape Helles had caught the Turks completely off guard.</p>
<p>A damned good thing, too, for the slapdash preparations made for
those going ashore at V Beach—and the notion of sending men onto an
enemy beach in unarmored and motorless wooden boats wasn’t the worst of
it—suggested trouble if they met any resistance. In an Alexandria
shipyard, workers had started in on a camouflage paint job of the River
Clyde but had run out of time; as a result, as the collier approached V
Beach that morning, its muted battleship gray was offset by enormous
splotches of tan primer, making it stand out against the sea as if
illuminated. Then there was the small matter of the Clyde being unable
to actually reach the beach. The plan instead was to run her aground
offshore and then to maneuver several fishing boats into the gap,
lashing them together to create a makeshift bridge from ship to shore.
At that point, the disembarking soldiers would emerge from four portals
cut into the Clyde’s bow, pass along two gangways to the fishing boats,
then clamber over those until finally they reached the beach. It’s hard
to imagine that such blithe preparations would have attended a landing
against Stone Age Pacific Islanders, let alone against a modern army,
but such was the contempt with which British war planners held the
Turks.</p>
<p>As the cutters neared the beach, the only sounds floating over the
quiet bay were of boat engines and the dipping of oars, of men talking
and laughing—perhaps a bit louder than normal out of relief at their
uneventful landing. It was when the lead boats were just yards off the
beach that the Turkish machine gunners, secreted in strategic vantage
points along the shoreline, opened up.</p>
<p>The men in the open cutters never had a chance. One after another,
these boats were shot to pieces or capsized, the gear-laden soldiers
within them drowning in the surf or picked off after becoming entangled
in the barbed wire that been strung below the water’s surface. Most of
the very few who made it onto the beach alive were soon cut down by
raking machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>Those coming off the Clyde fared little better. Time and again, work
crews emerged from the protected steel hull to try to lash the ersatz
pontoon bridge together, only to be shot down almost immediately or to
similarly drown in the surf. When finally a bridge of sorts was
established, the soldiers emerging onto the gangways were easy targets;
of the first company of two hundred men to go out the portals, only
eleven reached shore. Many of the early casualties on the gangways
actually died of suffocation, pinned beneath the growing heaps of dead
and wounded of those coming behind. Whoever did manage to make the beach
huddled for safety behind a six-foot-high sand escarpment at its
landward edge, scant protection against machine-gun bullets. By late
afternoon, there were so many dead men in the water that, as a British
captain on the scene observed, “the sea near the shore was a red blood
colour, which could be seen hundreds of yards away.”</p>
<p>By the end of that first day, the advance landing forces at Gallipoli
had already suffered nearly four thousand casualties, or considerably
more than the total number of men Lawrence had projected would be needed
to secure Alexandretta. So bewildered was General von Sanders by his
enemy’s idiocy that for the next day he remained convinced the southern
landing was a mere feint and that the main invasion force was still
coming elsewhere. This left it to a local Ottoman divisional commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal, acting on his own accord, to
repeatedly hurl his men against the invaders clinging to their tiny
beachheads in an attempt to throw them back into the sea.</p>
<p>The first-day objective of those landing on Cape Helles had been to
secure a small village some four miles inland, and then to advance on
the Turkish forts just above. Over the next seven months, the British
would never reach that village, but would suffer nearly a quarter of a
million casualties trying. As for the Ottoman commander, Mustafa Kemal,
the world would soon hear more about him; in 1922, he would emerge as
the savior of the reconstituted Turkish republic and become better known
by his honorific, Kemal Ataturk.</p>
<p>BUT IT WASN’T just the estimated half million soldiers killed or
wounded on either side of the trenchline who would fall victim to the
consequences of Gallipoli. On the very day the British came ashore,
April 25, the Constantinople regime ordered the roundup of some two
hundred Armenian intellectuals and business leaders whom it accused of
being potential fifth columnists for the invaders. It was the beginning
of a brutal “cleansing operation” against the Ottoman Empire’s Christian
minority—a genocide in the view of many—that would result in the deaths
of as many as a million Armenians and Assyrians over the next year.</p>
<p>It would be some time before Lawrence and other British officers
involved in the Middle Eastern theater came to appreciate that there had
been yet another casualty at Gallipoli: the chance for a sweeping Arab
revolt against the Turks, one that conceivably could have stretched from
the Hejaz to northern Syria and clear over to Iraq. The details of this
missed opportunity wouldn’t be fully known for well over a year, not
until Lawrence came face-to-face with Emir Hussein’s soft-spoken third
son, Faisal, and learned there had been a good deal more to his journey
north in the spring of 1915 than met the eye.</p>
<p>In January 1915, at almost the same time that he learned of the
Medina governor’s plot to overthrow him, Emir Hussein had been visited
in Mecca by a Syrian man named Fawzi al-Bakri. A long-standing and
trusted member of the emir’s retinue, on that visit al-Bakri had
revealed that he was also a high-ranking member of al-Fatat, a secret
society of Arab nationalists headquartered in his hometown of Damascus
with cells throughout Syria and Iraq. Having learned of Hussein’s secret
correspondence with the British, the al-Fatat leadership had sent
al-Bakri to Mecca with a proposal: a joint revolt against Constantinople
by al-Fatat in Syria and the emir’s forces in Hejaz, to be supported by
the British and with Hussein serving as its spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Rather than give a definitive reply to this proposal, the cautious
Hussein had instead sent Faisal north on a dual mission: to gauge the
family’s current standing in Constantinople, but also to assess the true
prospects for an alliance with al-Fatat.</p>
<p>Arriving in Damascus in late March, Faisal politely declined Djemal
Pasha’s invitation to stay at the governor’s mansion, explaining that he
had already accepted the hospitality of a prominent Damascene family:
the al-Bakris. In that home, shielded by high walls, Faisal held a long
series of talks with the al-Fatat conspirators, and it was the delicate
negotiations at those talks that largely explained why his stay in
Damascus, originally intended to be brief, extended to some three
weeks.</p>
<p>Journeying on to Constantinople, the young sheikh deftly worked the
other side of the street. In meetings with the other two members of the
Young Turk triumvirate, Enver and Talaat, as well as the newly arrived
Max von Oppenheim, Faisal repeatedly expressed his family’s fealty to
the Ottoman cause, going so far as to sign an accord with Enver that
appeared to finally put to rest many of the issues standing between
Constantinople and his father. In mid-May, and to the accompaniment of
an elaborate farewell ceremony organized by a grateful regime, he
boarded a train at Haidar Pasha station for the return to Syria.</p>
<p>But that journey was into a world transformed. Just weeks after the
landings in Gallipoli, already tens of thousands of Armenians were being
banished from their homes and sent into internal exile, and the view out
Faisal’s train window was onto an unending horror show of starving women
and children—and suspiciously few men—being herded along to God knows
where at bayonet point. From the standpoint of the proposed Arab revolt,
more grim news awaited him in Damascus. From his al-Fatat confederates,
Faisal learned that many of the Arab-dominated military units in the
region—units the conspirators had counted on for support when the revolt
came—were already being dispatched to the Gallipoli killing fields,
replaced by regime-loyal Turkish regiments.</p>
<p>Despite the radically changed atmosphere, perhaps because of it, the
al-Fatat plotters had urged on Faisal a document to take to his father,
and through him to the British in Egypt. Soon to become known as the
Damascus Protocol, it consisted of a list of conditions whereby, with
British assistance, al-Fatat might still be able to launch their revolt.
As Faisal set out for his return to Mecca, the sole copy of the protocol
was hidden in the boot of his most trusted bodyguard.</p>
<p>In preparing for Faisal’s arrival in Syria back in March, Djemal
Pasha had regarded the emir’s third son as his last best hope to quell
Hussein’s restive heart. In fact, the Syrian governor was quite right in
this estimation, if for all the wrong reasons. At a Hussein family
conclave held at their summer palace in June, it would be Abdullah and
Ali who would lobby their father for immediate rebellion against
Constantinople, while Faisal, recent witness to all that Gallipoli had
wrought—the Armenians dying en masse along the Anatolian roadways, the
dispersal of the Arab units from northern Syria—would urge caution.</p>
<p>The knowledge of all this lay in the future for T. E. Lawrence. In
the days and weeks after the Gallipoli landings, as he read through the
cascade of grim battle reports coming over the wire at the Savoy Hotel
in Cairo, it may have been just as well that he remained ignorant of the
Damascus Protocol and of the would-be British allies waiting in Syria
and the Hejaz. An absolute precondition for their revolt, the al-Fatat
conspirators and Hussein would belatedly inform Cairo, a prerequisite
upon which all their actions depended, was a British landing at
Alexandretta.</p>
