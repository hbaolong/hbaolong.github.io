<h4 id="chapter-13-aqaba">Chapter 13: Aqaba</h4>
<p>1 “Never doubt Great Britain’s”: As related by Wilson to Clayton, May
24, 1917; PRO-FO 882/16, f. 113.</p>
<p>2 “His Sherifial Majesty”: Wingate to Wilson, July 20, 1917; PRO-FO
882/7, f. 35.</p>
<p>3 Now it required: Lawrence’s account of his journey to and capture
of Aqaba is drawn from Seven Pillars, book 4, chapters 39–44,
pp. 227–312.</p>
<p>4 After a tense three-hour: Sykes to Wingate, May 23, 1917; MSP-41b,
p. 3; slightly different version in PRO-FO 371/3054, f. 329.</p>
<p>5 “Monsieur Picot received”: Sykes to Wingate, May 23, 1917; MSP-41b,
p. 5; slightly different version in PRO-FO 371/3054, f. 330.</p>
<p>6 Even those senior officials: Tanenbaum, France and the Arab Middle
East, 1914–1920, pp. 17–18.</p>
<p>7 “Although Sykes and Picot”: Wilson to Clayton, May 25, 1917; PRO-FO
882/16, p. 5.</p>
<p>8 “[Hussein] stated to Faisal”: Newcombe, “Note” on Sykes-Picot
meeting with King Hussein, May 20, 1917; GLLD 9/9.</p>
<p>9 The only way Hussein: Despite Sykes’s repeated assertions to the
contrary, there is ample evidence that he didn’t disclose the terms of
the Sykes-Picot Agreement to King Hussein at their May 1917 meetings.
Well into 1918, Cyril Wilson and other British officers in conference
with Hussein consistently reported that the king had no knowledge of the
partitions of the Arab “nation” called for in that agreement, but
instead continued to believe that the far more generous framework
specified in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence remained in effect. To
cite only the example discussed here, it’s exceedingly hard to imagine
that Hussein would have agreed to the Baghdad-Lebanon formulation had he
known beforehand of the proposed dispensation of Baghdad province as
specified in Sykes-Picot. As Tanenbaum (France and the Arab Middle East,
p. 17) points out: “It did not make sense for a leader of a rebellion to
ask an outside power to annex the territory for which he was fighting
and hoped to rule.”</p>
<p>10 In their back-and-forth: McMahon to Hussein, October 24, 1915, as
cited by Antonius, The Arab Awakening, p. 420.</p>
<p>11 “for a short time”: Report by Political Intelligence Department,
Foreign Office, “Memorandum on British Commitments to King Husein
[sic],” December 1918; PRO-FO 882/13, p. 7, f. 225.</p>
<p>12 “he knows that Sir Mark”: “Note by Sheikh Fuad El Khatib taken
down by Lt Col Newcombe,” undated but May 1917, p. 3; PRO-FO 882/16,
f. 133.</p>
<p>13 “If we are not going to see”: Wilson to Clayton, May 24, 1917;
PRO-FO 882/16, f. 111.</p>
<p>14 “we are deeply grateful”: Faisal Hussein, “To All Our Brethren—The
Syrian Arabs,” trans. May 28, 1917; SADD Wingate Papers, 145/7/89.</p>
<p>15 “I do not attach very”: Clayton to Sykes, July 30, 1917; SADD
Clayton Papers, 693/12/30.</p>
<p>16 “short statement of fact”: Wilson to Symes, June 20, 1917; PRO-FO
882/16, f. 127. Many historians contend that it was King Hussein and
Faisal, not Mark Sykes, who dissembled about the substance of their
meetings in May 1917. In The Question of Palestine, Isaiah Friedman
wholeheartedly accepts Sykes’s version, asserting (p. 206) that at their
preliminary, early May meeting, “Feisal’s misgivings were set at rest by
Sykes’s explanation of the Anglo-French Agreement … The interview with
Hussein on 5 May went off equally well.” Sykes’s only fault, in
Friedman’s view, was a failure to make a personal record of his and
Picot’s subsequent talks with Hussein. “For this omission,” he writes,
“Sykes had to pay the penalty when a year later, to his surprise,
Hussein feigned ignorance of the Anglo-French Agreement and pretended to
have learned of it first from Djemal Pasha’s Damascus speech …”</p>
<p>Not only Hussein’s protestations, but Sykes’s own actions, belie this
contention. On May 12, 1917, just one week after his first meeting with
Hussein, Sykes attended a high-level strategy meeting at Reginald
Wingate’s Cairo office. At that meeting, Sykes described in detail the
agreement he and Picot had reached with the Cairo-based Syrian
“delegates” nearly three weeks earlier, but made no mention of the
vastly more important accord he had supposedly reached with Hussein just
days prior. One reason may have been that this May 12 conference was
attended by Colonel Cyril Wilson, the official British liaison to
Hussein, and a person uniquely positioned to refute such an
assertion.</p>
<p>As for the subsequent meetings Sykes and Picot held with Hussein,
it’s difficult to discern any possible motive for two career military
officers, Stewart Newcombe and Cyril Wilson, whose missions in the Hejaz
would have been made markedly easier if Sykes’s account of those
meetings were true, to so vehemently refute it.</p>
<p>17 “The whole question”: Symes to Wilson, June 26, 1917; PRO-FO
882/16, f. 129–30.</p>
<p>18 As for Faisal: Wilson to Clayton, May 20, 1917; SADD Wingate
Papers, 145/7/36.</p>
<p>19 “They saw in me”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, pp. 25–26.</p>
<p>20 “Can’t stand another day”: Lawrence as quoted by Wilson, Lawrence,
p. 410 n. 40.</p>
<p>21 “Clayton. I’ve decided”: Ibid., p. 410 n. 41.</p>
<p>22 Lawrence’s northern: Lawrence, Seven Pillars (Oxford), chapter
51.</p>
<p>23 “Very old, livid”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 546.</p>
<p>24 “I saw that with my answer”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars (Oxford),
chapter 51.</p>
<p>25 “In other words”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 26.</p>
<p>26 In debriefings: In his debriefing of July 6, 1917, in London,
Samuel Edelman, the U.S. consul in Damascus, reported a 25 percent
desertion rate among Anatolian Turkish soldiers brought to Syria, a rate
surely surpassed by less loyal elements of the empire; PRO-FO
371/3050.</p>
<p>27 The more perceptive: See PRO-FO 371/3050, File 47710.</p>
<p>28 The spare diary: Prüfer, Diary, May 21–July 18, 1917; HO.</p>
<p>29 As he reported to: Prüfer to Mittwoch, April 12, 1917; NARA T149,
Roll 365, Frame 399.</p>
<p>30 “the High Command has”: Engle, The Nili Spies, p. 129.</p>
<p>31 Now, in mid-June 1917: The account of William Yale’s 1917 return
to the United States is drawn from Yale, It Takes So Long, chapter
7.</p>
<p>32 The situation was even worse: Yale, “Palestine–Syria Situation,”
to U.S. State Department, June 27, 1917; NARA 763.72/13450.</p>
<p>33 “the disposition of”: Yale to Secretary of State Lansing, June 30,
1917; YU Box 2/ Folder 48.</p>
<p>34 “no guns, no base”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 306. For an
account of the battle at Aba el Lissan, see also Lawrence, “The
Occupation of Akaba,” undated; PRO-FO 882/7, f. 63–68.</p>
<p>35 Their reports noted: See field reports of Herbert Garland, May
1917; PRO-FO 686/6.</p>
<p>36 “It is somewhat difficult”: Dawnay, “Notes on Faisal’s Proposed
Advance Northward,” May 29, 1917; PRO-WO 158/606, f. 43A.</p>
<p>37 By the time Clayton penned: Clayton to Director of Military
Intelligence (London), July 5, 1917; PRO-FO 882/7, f. 1.</p>
<p>38 “The enemy had never”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 310.</p>
