Secrets</h4>
<p>You know, men do nearly all die laughing, because they know death is
very terrible, and a thing to be forgotten till after it has come.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, IN A LETTER TO HIS MOTHER, 1916</p>
<p>Finding the demands of his mapping-room duties at the Savoy at least
temporarily eased by the departure of the Med-Ex army, in April 1915
Lawrence took over the task of editing an intelligence digest, a
compendium of reports from around the region to be distributed to the
upper echelons of the British military command. He described the
undertaking with his trademark sarcasm to a friend in England:</p>
<p>“We edit a daily newspaper, absolutely uncensored, for the
edification of twenty-eight generals; the circulation increases
automatically as they invent new generals. This paper is my only joy.
One can give the Turkish point of view (in imaginary conversations with
prisoners) of the proceedings of admirals and generals one dislikes, and
I rub it in in my capacity as editor-in-chief. There is also a weekly
letter to ‘Mother’ [the London War Office] in which one japes on a
grander scale yet.”</p>
<p>It was, of course, precisely this flippant attitude, one Lawrence
seemed determined to flaunt both in his correspondence and in person,
that so incensed his military superiors. But his defiance of soldierly
protocol also underscored a deeper truth: Lawrence was fundamentally not
of them, and was becoming less so all the time.</p>
<p>In just four months in the war theater, he had watched as Britain’s
best hope for an early victory over the Turks was shelved for no better
reason than politics and institutional inertia; in its place, the “great
thinkers” had come up with Gallipoli. From what the Oxford scholar had
seen, military culture was a world of hidebound careerists looking for a
knighthood or their next medal, and of underlings loath to question the
powerful, with countless thousands dying as a result.</p>
<p>What’s more, by dint of his position in the Cairo military
intelligence unit, Lawrence was uniquely positioned to know the truth
behind the lies and propaganda on an ongoing basis. Every day he saw the
raw battlefield reports coming into the Savoy Hotel from the various war
theaters, and these told a tale of staggering incompetence and
callousness: of soldiers ordered to stay in formation as they advanced
over open ground toward enemy machine-gun nests; of hundreds dying to
capture and lose and capture again a single village, a single hillock.
Certainly a select group of other junior-ranked men had access to this
information too—generals’ aides and officers in similar military
intelligence units in the various war theaters—but most of these were
aspirants to the system, willing cogs in the vast, dumb meat-grinding
machinery that none dared acknowledge as such.</p>
<p>THE GERMAN MILITARY mission in Jerusalem was housed in the Hospice
for Russian Pilgrims, in the pleasant and orderly neighborhood just
north of the Old City known as the Russian Compound. It was there that
Curt Prüfer could often be found through the late winter of 1915, poring
over intelligence cables and calculating his next move.</p>
<p>With a bit of distance from the event, the disillusionment he’d felt
for the concept of holy war in the immediate aftermath of the Suez
assault had eased somewhat. He recognized that with the Turkish forces
getting no farther than the canal’s banks, the idea remained an
essentially untested one. He also recognized that despite that first
setback, British Egypt could not be left alone, that so long as it
existed, it posed the primary threat to the German-Turkish alliance in
the Middle East. So a new assault was necessary, this time supported by
far greater firepower, including German artillery and aircraft, as well
as far better military intelligence, an apparatus that could provide
details on what the British on the far side of the canal were planning,
where their troops were deployed.</p>
<p>The problem was, Prüfer’s own extensive intelligence network inside
Egypt had also fallen victim to the Suez assault. In the first days of
the war, he’d been able to use his Egyptian contacts to compile a
comprehensive view of the enemy’s preparations; in one memorable
November 1914 report, he’d written of British defenseworks in the future
tense—that is, of enemy installations still in the construction or
planning stage. All that had been shut down in the run‑up to Suez. As
Prüfer reported to his superiors in late February, his own “bitter,
practical experience” at the canal showed that most of the Bedouin and
Egyptians he’d hastily recruited as replacement spies had been
worthless, prone to “leaving honor and patriotism high and dry in the
face of the temptations of the circling British agents who are not at
all stingy with [gold] sovereigns.” Germany might conceivably follow the
British example and buy its way to a new informant network inside Egypt,
Prüfer pointed out, but that would leave it dependent on whatever
unverifiable intelligence these paid agents passed on, “functioning with
these people” rather than actually managing them. In pondering this
dilemma, the intelligence officer hit upon a rather shrewd idea: Jewish
spies.</p>
<p>That idea’s genesis may have stemmed from the company Prüfer was
keeping at the time. Her name was Minna Weizmann, a dynamic and very
pretty Jewish émigré in her mid-twenties from the town of Motal in White
Russia (modern-day Belarus). From a prominent and highly educated
family, Weizmann had embraced socialism from an early age, and had
seized her chance to escape the hated czarist regime while at medical
school in Berlin; in 1913, she’d immigrated to Palestine, becoming one
of the few women physicians in Syria. It had been in Jerusalem in early
1914 that she and Curt Prüfer, recently resigned from the German embassy
in Cairo, first met.</p>
<p>Although details of their relationship are sketchy, fragmentary
evidence suggests the union was a special one for both. A rumor finding
its way into German intelligence reports held that on the eve of
Prüfer’s departure for the Suez offensive in January, Weizmann had spent
the night in his Jerusalem hotel room, behavior so scandalous for the
time as to be ruinous for any woman not a prostitute. For his part,
there are indications that Weizmann was a good deal more than just
another amorous conquest for the ever-roving Prüfer; his wartime diaries
contain several references to “my dear Fanny,” Weizmann’s nickname,
signs of an affection rather absent in the few mentions of his American
wife, Frances Pinkham, who is usually referred to merely as “Fr.”</p>
<p>But if the bond with Minna Weizmann was true love, it was a love Curt
Prüfer was willing to put to a higher purpose.</p>
<p>When Turkey came into the war, there were tens of thousands of
Russian Jews scattered across Syrian Palestine who, like Minna Weizmann,
still retained Russian citizenship. Constantinople had quickly given
these now “belligerent nationals” a stark choice: become Ottoman
citizens or face deportation or internal exile. In response, thousands
of the émigrés had surrendered their Russian passports in favor of
Ottoman ones, while thousands more had crowded into packed ships at
Jaffa harbor in search of a new home. In March 1915, this exodus from
Palestine was continuing—warships from the neutral United States were
now complementing merchant vessels—and where most of these refugees were
ending up was in British Egypt. As Prüfer pointed out in a proposal he
sent to both Djemal Pasha and Max von Oppenheim, establishing a
successful spy network in Egypt required “people who can be introduced
into the country without suspicion, and have the necessary astuteness
and sang-froid. We can find a number of such people amongst the Jewish
population in this country.”</p>
<p>Giving this spy ring its reliability, in Prüfer’s estimation, would
be the Russian Jews’ abiding hatred of the anti-Semitic czarist regime.
Operating on the premise that the friend of one’s enemy is the enemy, he
reasoned there might be many members of this community in Palestine who
would jump at the chance to work against czarist Russian interests by
striking at her ally in the region, British Egypt. Best of all, as
Russian passport holders, these spies could simply join the ongoing
refugee boatlift to Egypt without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>But if it was already a feat to insert intelligence operatives into
an enemy country in wartime, that still left the question of how to get
them or their information out. Here Prüfer’s scheme was truly clever. In
March 1915, Italy remained a neutral nation (it would join the Triple
Entente that May), and there was regular ship traffic between Italian
ports and Egypt. Rather than try to communicate with or return to
Turkey, Prüfer’s spies would transit to Italy and pass their information
on to the German embassy in Rome. At that point, they could either make
for Turkey overland or, if their cover remained intact, return to Egypt
for another round of intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>Warming to his topic, Prüfer further directed that the operatives
should be divided into two cells, one composed of men, the other of
women. Both cells “will try to steal relevant [British] documents or
make copies of them. They will also try to get friendly with people who
might be able to supply such information.” Lest there be any confusion
over what “friendly” meant, Prüfer spelled it out. “Above all, the women
agents—who must be young and not without charms—should try to get into
relationships with influential people who may, in a moment of weakness
borne of intimacy, let escape information that could be useful to
us.”</p>
<p>His proposal received an enthusiastic response from Oppenheim, as
well as from Ambassador von Wangenheim in Constantinople, and in early
April Prüfer began his recruitment drive. In short order, he’d managed
to procure the services of two Jewish émigrés, Isaac Cohn and Moses
Rothschild, who were leaving Palestine for Egypt. While Rothschild made
contact with a German spy nest at Shepheard’s Hotel, the favored lodging
and watering hole of the British high command in Cairo, Cohn undertook
an extensive tour of the British coastal defenses in Alexandria and
along the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>The spymaster clearly took his new enterprise very seriously and as a
true patriot was ready to let whatever affections he felt for Minna
Weizmann be trumped by those he held for the kaiser. In early May 1915,
Weizmann made the crossing to Egypt as the newest member of Prüfer’s spy
ring. She probably needed little in the way of persuading; as both a Jew
and a socialist, she might as well have been wearing a czarist
bull’s-eye on her back, and here was the chance for both adventure and
revenge.</p>
<p>Initially, Weizmann did very well in her new vocation, her hospital
work and the novelty of being a female physician giving her entrée to
the upper echelons of British Cairo society. Her luck didn’t hold,
however. Under the cover of accompanying a badly wounded French soldier
home, she managed to reach Italy, but there was observed meeting with
the German ambassador in Rome. Unmasked, she was hauled back to Egypt,
where she faced a decidedly grim future: internment in a British
prisoner-of-war camp at the very least, and possibly execution. Instead,
Weizmann’s considerable charms combined with old-fashioned chivalry
produced a far more pleasant outcome. As related by a Swiss woman who
crossed paths with Minna that August and heard her story, “she was so
beloved in Cairo and Alexandria, and held in such respect that people
gave her unwavering denial [of being a spy] credence.” Ironically, even
the czar’s consul in Cairo vouched for Minna’s innocence and arranged
for her safe passage back to Russia. It was while staying at a hotel in
Romania, in transit to the homeland she had escaped from two years
earlier, that Weizmann desperately reached out to the Swiss woman.</p>
<p>“She revealed everything to me,” Hilla Steinbach-Schuh explained to a
German official, “and fervently begged me to inform the German embassy
in Constantinople of her deportation, especially that Herr Prüfer should
be advised of this.”</p>
<p>But the remarkably tender treatment shown Minna Weizmann—she would
not only survive the war, but eventually return to Palestine to work for
the medical service of the Zionist women’s organization, Hadassah—may
have also stemmed from her lineage. Her older brother was Chaim
Weizmann, a renowned chemist who had immigrated to Great Britain in 1904
and who in 1915 was already working closely with the British munitions
industry to improve their war-making capability; Chaim would go on to
become the first president of the state of Israel, while Minna’s nephew
Ezer would serve as its seventh. That lineage may also explain why Minna
has been largely excised from the history books, and even from the
Weizmann family’s memory (Chaim made not a single reference to his
sister in his memoirs); for “the first family of Israel” to count among
its members someone who not only spied for Germany but whose spymaster
lover went on to become a senior Nazi diplomat is surely one of those
awkward family stories best left untold.</p>
<p>Even before learning of Minna Weizmann’s fate, however, Curt Prüfer
had seen his fledgling Egyptian spy ring largely shut down, a result of
Italy’s joining the Triple Entente in May and the consequent severing of
the German embassy “ratline.” Still, Prüfer’s bold initiative had
greatly impressed his superiors in both the military and intelligence
spheres. As Lieutenant Colonel Kress von Kressenstein, the commander of
German forces in Palestine, informed Berlin, “Curt Prüfer is
indispensable as the leader of the intelligence service.”</p>
<p>ON MAY 9, 1915, T. E. Lawrence’s younger brother, twenty-two-year-
old Frank, stationed in the Arras sector of the Western Front, was doing
repair work on a forward trench in preparation for an assault when he
was struck by three shrapnel fragments from a German artillery shell.
Whether it was true or not, for soldiers routinely dissemble about such
things, Frank’s commanding officer reported in his condolence letter to
the Lawrence parents that their son had died instantly.</p>
<p>The news shattered Sarah Lawrence. By most accounts, Frank had been
her favorite child, and since being shipped off to France in February he
had written her long, discursive letters filled with descriptions of the
foibles of military life and his everyday existence at the front.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence learned of Frank’s death in a telegram from his
parents in mid-May. For whatever reason, he waited to respond until he
had received more information from his father through the mail. It
wasn’t until June 4 that he finally scribbled out a hasty note to his
parents on a telegram form:</p>
<p>I haven’t written since I got your wire as I was waiting for details.
Today I got Father’s two letters. They are very comfortable reading, and
I hope that when I die there will be nothing more to regret. The only
thing I feel a little is that there was no need, surely, to go into
mourning for him? I cannot see any cause at all. In any case, to die for
one’s country is a sort of privilege. Mother and you will find it more
painful and harder to live for it than he did to die, but I think that
at this time, it is one’s duty to show no signs that would distress
others, and to appear bereaved is surely under this condemnation.</p>
<p>So please, keep a brave face to the world. We cannot all go fighting,
but we can do that, which is in the same kind. N[ed].</p>
<p>Perhaps the note’s most interesting aspect, beyond its startling
coldness, was Lawrence’s invocation of a kind of puerile patriotism that
he had long derided. In any event, Sarah Lawrence was hardly in the mood
to adhere to this stiff advice from her son. Shortly after, she wrote
Ned another letter, in which she evidently (evidently because this
letter has never been found) upbraided him for not expressing his love
for her in her hour of grief. If Sarah Lawrence hoped this would stir a
softening in her second son, she was to be disappointed:</p>
<p>Poor Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I got your letter this morning, and it has grieved me very much. You
will never never understand any of us after we are grown up a little.
Don’t you ever feel that we love you without our telling you so? I feel
such a contemptible worm for having to write this way about things. If
you only knew that if one thinks deeply about anything, one would rather
die than say anything about it. You know, men do nearly all die
laughing, because they know death is very terrible, and a thing to be
forgotten till after it has come.</p>
<p>There, put that aside, and bear a brave face to the world about
Frank. In a time of such fearful stress in our country it is one’s duty
to watch very carefully lest one of the weaker ones be offended; and you
know, we were always the stronger, and if they see you broken down they
will all grow fearful about their ones at the front.</p>
<p>Lawrence next wrote his parents about a week later; he made no
reference to Frank—indeed, he rarely mentioned him by name in any
subsequent correspondence—and instead spent the bulk of the brief note
describing the weather just then in Cairo.</p>
<p>DJEMAL PASHA WAS in a much-improved mood by early June 1915. He had
good reason to be. When the Allied forces had come ashore at Gallipoli
on April 25, it largely mooted the possibility of a landing somewhere in
Syria. Better yet, with both sides pouring more men and matériel into
that narrow strip of battlefield, the Syrian governor had been provided
with the means to be rid of the more troublesome military units in his
zone. In response to Constantinople’s urgent call for reinforcements,
Djemal had immediately begun dispatching his Arab-dominated regiments in
northern Syria to Gallipoli, replacing them with newly mustered Turkish
formations from the Anatolian interior—utterly green soldiers, perhaps,
but at least their loyalty could be relied upon. And of course, the
removal of the potentially mutinous Arab troops meant that the schemes
of the French consulate plotters, and whatever other separatist-minded
Arab traitors might be skulking about, were now far less dangerous.</p>
<p>There had also been good news in regard to the troublesome Hussein
family in the Hejaz. Building on the lavish treatment he had bestowed
upon Faisal in Jerusalem and Damascus, Djemal had sent word to
Constantinople that the charm offensive should continue once the young
sheikh reached the Ottoman capital. That directive had been followed; in
early May, the offending Medina civilian governor was transferred,
allowing Faisal and Enver Pasha to fashion an accord that suggested a
full rapprochement between the Young Turks and the irksome Hussein in
Mecca. That was certainly the estimation of Max von Oppenheim, who had
two long meetings with Faisal in Constantinople, and of Djemal himself
when Faisal returned to Syria in late May. In an emotional address
before Djemal’s senior military staff at the German Hospice, Hussein’s
son had professed his undying loyalty to both the empire and the cause
of pan-Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>There had even been some progress with the locust plague. Certainly
the ravages of that infestation would be sorely felt in the autumn
harvest, but through the energetic efforts of the Jewish scientist Aaron
Aaronsohn and his modern trenching techniques, it appeared that
full-scale catastrophe had been averted.</p>
<p>Yet amid this brighter outlook, a new crisis had engulfed the
empire—or rather, an old one had erupted anew.</p>
<p>Within the Ottoman court, the Christian Armenians of Anatolia had
long been regarded as potential fifth columnists for Christian
invaders—and especially for its Russian archenemies—and for just as long
the Armenians had suffered periodic massacres at the hands of their
Turkish and Kurdish Muslim neighbors. The most recent bout of slaughter,
in the 1890s, had led to the deaths of at least fifty thousand Armenians
in a matter of days.</p>
<p>This historical animus had been rekindled by the regime’s call to
jihad against the “Christian enemies” in November 1914. The
Armenians—ethnically and linguistically apart, as well as numerous
enough to pose a plausible threat—were uniquely vulnerable to a spark
that might set off a new wave of anti-Armenian fury. That spark had come
with a Russian offensive into eastern Anatolia, when the Armenians
became the perfect scapegoats for explaining away Turkish setbacks on
the battlefield. Thus the stage was set: in the rhetoric of the
Constantinople regime, and in the minds of many of its Turkish and
Kurdish subjects, the some two million Armenians of Anatolia were now
the enemy within.</p>
<p>On April 24, on the eve of the Allied landings at Gallipoli, Interior
Minister Talaat had ordered the arrest of hundreds of Armenian civic
leaders in Constantinople, and simultaneously instructed the governors
of those provinces with a substantial Armenian population to immediately
close down on all Armenian “revolutionary and political organizations”
and arrest their leaders. This directive, carrying the suggestion that a
credible Armenian secessionist movement actually existed, had terrible
consequences; in the eyes of many government officials in the
hinterlands, all Armenians were the enemy. Within days of Talaat’s
directive, tens of thousands of ordinary Armenian civilians were being
pulled from their homes, to be force-marched to some unspecified
“relocation zone” elsewhere, or in many cases simply butchered where
they stood.</p>
<p>Given the porousness of Turkey’s frontiers, as well as the presence
of Western mission schools throughout the empire, reports had soon
started coming into Constantinople telling of massacres of Armenians
across the breadth of Anatolia, of corpses lining the routes of their
forced marches into the countryside. As the horror stories multiplied,
on May 24, the foreign ministers of the Triple Entente issued a
proclamation vowing that the Young Turk leadership would be held
responsible for “these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and
civilization.”</p>
<p>Constantinople’s response was one of defiance; three days after the
Entente proclamation, the Turkish cabinet approved the “Provisional Law
of Relocation.” Without specifically citing the Armenians, the law
stated that the army was now “authorized and compelled to crush in the
most severe way” any sign of resistance or aggression among the
population. To do so, it had the power “to transfer and relocate the
populations of villages and towns, either individually or collectively,
in response to military needs, or in response to any signs of treachery
or betrayal.” As for where this potentially vast sea of internal
deportees might be sent, Talaat and Enver had already selected a spot:
gathered up from across Anatolia, most would be herded down to the
barren reaches of northern Syria. The insanity inherent in this scheme,
of uprooting a vast population and casting it into a land already
devastated by the deprivations of war, would play out to obscene result:
by best estimate, some 800,000 of the Armenian deportees were to
perish—starved, shot, or beaten to death—en route.</p>
<p>The consensus among historians is that Djemal Pasha stood very much
apart from his Young Turk coleaders in his response to the expulsions.
In June, the first survivors of the death marches began to trickle into
the north Syrian city of Aleppo, a way station toward their intended
destination, the “relocation zone” of Deir al-Zour some one hundred
miles to the east. Visiting Aleppo, Djemal Pasha was horrified by what
he saw. Reiterating a March decree that commanded his army to protect
the Armenians, he lobbied Constantinople to impose the order on military
units where it really mattered, in Anatolia. That plea was ignored.</p>
<p>Getting no satisfaction from Constantinople, Djemal allowed thousands
of Armenians to remain in Aleppo rather than continue their death march,
and despite the deepening hunger and food shortages spreading through
Syria, he ordered an increase of government food aid to the refugees.
Testament to his love of order and regulations, he issued a rash of new
edicts directing that the army regulate and maintain the food supply for
the Armenians, that cars and horses be procured for their
transportation, even that each refugee be given a financial allowance.
But implicit in the stacks of documents that the Syrian governor signed
in his office each day was the notion that his regime actually had the
wherewithal to carry out these initiatives, never mind that all
evidence—evidence that started just outside Djemal’s office windows and
stretched to the farthest corners of his realm—argued otherwise. It was
as if he fancied himself the administrator of a canton of peacetime
Switzerland, rather than of a poor and highly fractured region the size
of Italy that was being ravaged by war, hunger, and disease. In the face
of the Armenian crisis, as with so many other problems that came his
way, Djemal responded with a mixture of bluster, threats, and pleas, and
when none of that worked, he simply averted his gaze. By September, with
the crisis worsening, he issued a new edict, making it a criminal
offense to photograph the Armenians.</p>
<p>SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED to Aaron Aaronsohn in the Palestinian
village of Katra, when an elderly Arab man approached him with the words
“zatna mamnounin”—“we are grateful to you.” As the agronomist noted in
his diary that evening, “the Arabs did not speak that way to Jews only
twenty years ago. The job I undertake is a hard one indeed, but to
compel the natives to declare, even if they are false in their hearts,
zatna mamnounin to the Jews, for them to realize they are helpless in
such calamities if we don’t help them out, that is already
worthwhile.”</p>
<p>As the head of Djemal’s locust eradication program, Aaronsohn
traveled the length of the Syrian plague zone that spring of 1915,
giving public lectures and holding field workshops on how best to combat
the pestilence. At his urging, Djemal Pasha decreed that every man,
woman, and child was to collect six rotels, about forty pounds, of
locust eggs for destruction or face an exorbitant fine.</p>
<p>But even for a man of unflagging energy, there were times when the
enormity of the task cast Aaronsohn into despair. Despite all the
eradication efforts, the swarms continued to expand—at least one was
credibly measured at one mile wide and seven miles long—as did the scope
of their destruction. Ever more of lowland Judea, normally a verdant
green at that time of year, became a study in brown: mile after mile of
orchards stripped bare of both fruit and leaf, fields so devoid of
vegetation they appeared set in winter fallow.</p>
<p>As crises everywhere have a tendency to do, the locust plague also
laid bare the inequalities and deficiencies of Syrian society. Despite
the extraordinary powers given him by Djemal, the response Aaronsohn
typically encountered among local bureaucrats and military officers he
tried to enlist to the eradication effort fell somewhere between
uninterest and defiance. In Jaffa, he had been compelled to shame the
kaimmakam, or local governor, into attending his public lecture, only to
watch the man pointedly leave the auditorium halfway through. The old
man in the village of Katra notwithstanding, the far more common
response in Arab villages was resignation; to them, the locusts were
djesh Allah, or “God’s army,” and it was futile, perhaps even
sacrilegious, to resist it. Also laid bare was officialdom’s resentment
of the Jewish colonists, which was always simmering just beneath the
surface. Ottoman tax officials were punctilious in handing out fines for
insufficient egg collection in Jewish villages, while those same
shortfalls—and in many cases complete inactivity—in Arab villages were
ignored. In a particularly outrageous case, Aaronsohn reported, shortly
after all the plowhorses in the Jewish settlement of Petah Tikvah had
been taken away under the war requisitions statute, their owners were
fined under the locust eradication statute for failing to plow their
fields. Time and again, he threatened to resign from his
inspector-general position in disgust, only to receive new assurances
from Djemal that the problems and inequities would be addressed, that a
new day of harmony and collective effort was just around the corner.</p>
<p>At least part of Aaronsohn’s discontent, however, was rooted in the
deeply personal, a change that had come over him during his travels
through Palestine. For the first time, he had begun to question the
Ottoman Empire’s ability to survive—or, perhaps more accurately, the
ability of the Jewish community to survive in her thrall. It went far
beyond the petty harassments and corruption he had witnessed. At most
every Jewish settlement he’d visited, he had been approached by
frightened residents who told of growing tension with their Arab
neighbors, of overt threats from local officials brandishing
weapons.</p>
<p>The warning signs didn’t attach solely to the Jews. In April,
Aaronsohn had dispatched his brother Alex to Lebanon, both to see if the
locusts had reached there and to check on their youngest sister, Rivka,
who had been hustled off to Beirut during those tense days when the
Turkish army was searching for Zichron’s arms cache. Under the terms of
the Capitulations, Christian-dominated Lebanon had always enjoyed a
great measure of freedom from Constantinople, and had become a proud and
prosperous Francophile enclave in Syria; as Alex reported back, even
though Lebanon had escaped the locusts, it was now a sad and broken
place, with Turkish soldiers everywhere and even the normally haughty
Beirutis living in dread of what might come next. By early June came the
most alarming reports yet, dark rumors about the massacre of Armenians
in Anatolia. It was just around this time that Aaronsohn’s brooding led
him to two interlocking conclusions: the Jews in Palestine had to break
with the Ottoman Empire. To achieve that break, they had to actively
work for its downfall.</p>
<p>The agronomist was undoubtedly helped in reaching this conclusion by
his assistant at Athlit, Absalom Feinberg, a twenty-six-year-old
firebrand who was engaged to Aaronsohn’s sister Rivka. In his home
village of Hadera, a Jewish colony just ten miles south of Zichron,
Feinberg had formed a local chapter of the Gideonites, the paramilitary
organization that both protected Jewish settlements and launched
reprisal raids against their perceived Arab enemies. It was an activity
well suited to his political outlook, for to Feinberg the Arab-Jewish
struggle in Palestine was a contest between “culture and savagery,” and
there was little doubt which role the Arabs fulfilled. “I have lived
among them all my life,” he would write, “and it would be difficult to
sway me from my opinion that there is no more cowardly, hypocritical,
and false race than this one.”</p>
<p>But if there was one “race” Feinberg detested even more than the
Arab, it was the Turk, and ever since arriving at Athlit he had preached
to Aaron Aaronsohn the gospel of revolt, on the need for the Jews of
Palestine to rise up and throw off the Turkish yoke.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn, fourteen years Feinberg’s senior, may have laughed off his
assistant’s fiery oratory as the passion of youth, but a turning point
of sorts had been reached that previous January when Feinberg and twelve
other Hadera residents were arrested on the spurious charge of spying
for the British. Managing to escape, Feinberg had made straight for
Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>To win the release of the Hadera men, the agronomist contemplated
taking the path he had trod so often before—working his network of
contacts in the Ottoman bureaucracy, dispensing bribes where needed—but
this time Feinberg would have none of it. “Our worst enemy is the Turk,”
he told Aaronsohn. “Now that the hour of his downfall has struck, can we
stand by and do nothing? The Turks are right to suspect us. They know
the ruin they are planning for us. Anyone without a rabbit’s heart would
be proud to spy against them if it would help to bring the English.”</p>
<p>Certainly, Feinberg’s views hadn’t softened during the long days and
weeks he had spent with Aaronsohn on the locust eradication campaign.
Instead, by that June, it was the agronomist who had been converted.</p>
<p>As for how to work against the Turks—which by extension meant helping
the British—the answer was fairly obvious. Over the course of the locust
eradication effort, Aaronsohn and his various assistants had covered the
length of Palestine, and the scientist now had a stack of reports on his
desk detailing local conditions and resources for much of the region.
The lists of available resources had quite naturally included the size
and location of army camps, supply depots, and gasoline storage
facilities, all vital information for a large-scale civic campaign but
also for an enemy army. More specifically, these reports and Aaronsohn’s
own travels confirmed that the Turkish army was concentrated in just a
few towns and cities in Palestine, that virtually the entire coastline
had been left undefended save for a few motley crews of local gendarmes
and rural militia. The British clearly didn’t know this or they might
have stormed ashore long ago, and this was the most crucial intelligence
that Aaronsohn could provide them, a detailed, mile-by-mile report on
the opposition to be faced—or more accurately, not to be faced—along the
length of Palestine’s coast.</p>
<p>As to the question of getting word to the British that a spy ring was
waiting to be at their service in Palestine, the answer was even more
obvious. In Beirut and Haifa, American warships were continuing to
evacuate “neutrals” who wanted to leave the Ottoman Empire, and both
port cities boasted thriving black markets in forged documents. While
nothing in Syria was easy anymore, getting a messenger on board one of
the Egypt-bound evacuation ships was little more than a matter of money
and luck.</p>
<p>For Aaronsohn, it was also clear who this messenger should be. Twice
in the opening days of the war, his brother Alex had run afoul of the
Ottoman authorities, and he was now locked in a dangerous feud with a
local functionary. Furthermore, Alex spoke flawless English, courtesy of
a three-year residence in New York. So it was that in mid-July 1915 Alex
Aaronsohn boarded USS Des Moines in Beirut’s harbor. Joining him was his
“wife,” Rivka Aaronsohn. Once past the American warship’s first port of
call, the Greek island of Rhodes, the couple would continue on to Egypt,
where Alex would make straight for the British military intelligence
office in Cairo.</p>
<p>THE TRIP DOWN had been a delight: two weeks on a first-class train
surrounded by beautiful scenery, broken here and there by stopovers in
exquisitely picturesque Anatolian towns. Best of all, William Yale had
fallen into the company of Abdul Rahman Pasha al-Yusuf, a member of the
Turkish parliament and one of the wealthiest noblemen of Damascus, and
been accorded lavish hospitality as the pasha’s temporary “adopted son.”
In fact, just about the only disagreeable moments on the entire journey
had been the bedbugs at the hotel in Eskisehir and the sight of the
starving Armenian refugees massed along the rail siding in Tarsus. “It
was a sad sight to see the poor people,” Yale blandly recalled,
“uprooted from their homes, going to an unknown destination, the shadow
of a great tragedy looming over them.” If the American oilman felt any
moral uneasiness about his or his company’s role in collaborating with
the regime that was orchestrating this tragedy, he kept it to himself;
William Yale had a delicate task to perform.</p>
<p>After just a few days in the Syrian capital, he took reluctant leave
of the pasha to continue on to Jerusalem, where his first order of
business was to arrange a meeting with Djemal Pasha. With a haste rather
out of character for the Ottoman government, he soon received a summons
to the German Hospice on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>As his horse-drawn carriage climbed the steep cobblestoned road up
the mount on the appointed day, Yale found himself growing increasingly
nervous. “I practiced the salaams and salutations I had learned on the
trip from Constantinople,” he wrote, “and wondered whether they were the
proper ones to use for such a powerful person as Djemal.”</p>
<p>Yale’s anxiety was more than just a case of starstruck jitters. He
had come to Jerusalem to secure concessionary rights to a half million
acres of Palestine for Standard Oil, and as he well knew, the success or
failure of that enterprise rested on his meeting with the Syrian
governor. He wasn’t at all sure how it might go.</p>
<p>Passing through the wrought-iron gates of the German Hospice, Yale’s
horse carriage drew to a stop before the main entrance of the
magnificent building, where liveried sentries stepped forward to help
him down. With his papers and maps, the American oilman was ushered into
the ornate main hall, then down a long stone corridor to the anteroom of
Djemal’s inner sanctum.</p>
<p>As Yale waited there, he fell into conversation with one of the
governor’s young aides, a naval attaché who spoke English. Welcoming
this distraction from his anxiety, Yale became so engrossed in their
talk that he took little notice of those coming and going from the room,
including the short uniformed man with the close-cropped black beard who
eventually emerged from a side door. It wasn’t until this man strode
briskly up to the receptionist’s desk, hopped up on one corner of it,
and fixed him with an intent stare that Yale realized it was Djemal
Pasha.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Yale,” he said in elegant French, “get your maps and
papers out and show me what you want.”</p>
<p>Djemal’s informality had the effect of instantly dissolving Yale’s
nervousness—but also of filling him with a sudden regret. At the last
minute, he had decided that asking for the entire half million acres
that Standard wanted in Palestine was simply too audacious a request to
make at this first meeting with the governor, so Yale had brought only
half his maps to the German Hospice. These he quickly spread upon the
receptionist desk and pointed out a broad swath of central Judea. Djemal
looked on, but judging by the impatient nodding of his head, he wasn’t
keen on hearing a lot of details. After just a few moments he
straightened and gave another curt nod. “Tell me what you need and I’ll
issue the necessary orders at once.”</p>
<p>It was only at that instant, Yale would later contend, that he
grasped the gulf of understanding that stood between him and the Syrian
governor. If there was oil in Palestine, Djemal Pasha naturally wanted
it found and quickly tapped so that his transport trucks could move and
his armies could fight their war. But Standard had no intention of doing
that. Instead, Yale had come to Palestine merely to buy up concessions
and put dibs on the region for Standard in the postwar era.</p>
<p>“As I look back on it now,” Yale recounted some twenty years later,
“I regret that I didn’t tell him the truth.”</p>
<p>But he didn’t. Instead, with Djemal Pasha’s support, Yale quickly
obtained the necessary official papers and organized a field expedition.
In short order, and with Turkish soldiers and local officials ensuring
the full compliance of tribal sheikhs, he had nailed down the mineral
concessionary rights to some quarter million acres of central Palestine.
His Socony superiors back in Constantinople were understandably thrilled
with the news, but apparently so was the Turkish leadership. First,
Standard had helped them skirt the British naval blockade by smuggling
oil in from Bulgaria, and now Standard was taking the further step—or so
the Turks thought—of helping them develop their own oil resources. In
late July, the regime resolved to show their gratitude to their friends
in Socony’s Constantinople office in the time-honored tradition of
empires everywhere: the bestowing of medals.</p>
<p>For more fainthearted men, the idea of accepting medals from the
Ottoman regime at that particular juncture might have given pause. The
expatriate community in Constantinople was by then awash in reports of
what was being done to the Armenians, fresh accounts almost daily of the
inhabitants of yet another village being slaughtered, of hundreds or
thousands more being starved or beaten to death during their marches
into exile. But the men of Socony hadn’t attained their positions by
mixing morality with business, or by pandering to whatever humanitarian
concern was currently in vogue. On July 28, the three senior officers of
its Constantinople branch—William Bemis, Oscar Gunkel, and Lucien I.
Thomas—were ushered into Dolmabahçe Palace for an audience with the
sultan. At that ceremony, the Socony officials were awarded the Order of
the Osmanieh, one of the highest civilian awards given by the Ottoman
Empire, for their “numerous humanitarian services.”</p>
<p>IN MID-JULY 1915, T. E. Lawrence sat down to answer a letter he had
recently received from his closest sibling, his younger brother Will. At
that time, Will was undergoing training at the Cambridge Barracks in
Portsmouth to serve as an aerial observer for the Royal Flying
Corps.</p>
<p>Given Lawrence’s almost pathological reticence to express intimacy,
it must have been especially difficult for him to turn to what had been
the thrust of Will’s letter to him: the death in May of their younger
brother, Frank. “Frank’s death was, as you say, a shock because it was
so unexpected,” he wrote. “I don’t think one can regret it overmuch,
because it is a very good way to take, after all. The hugeness of this
war has made one change one’s perspective, I think, and I for one can
hardly see details at all.”</p>
<p>In closing, though, Lawrence struck a softer, almost plaintive tone.
“I wonder when it will all end and peace follow? All the relief I get
[is] in The Greek Anthology, Heredia, Morris and a few others. Do
you?”</p>
<p>In July 1915, the war was not yet even a quarter done; there were
still more than three years of slaughter and ruin ahead. But the seeds
for Lawrence’s own dramatic role in that conflict were just then being
sown. Those seeds were born of two seemingly disparate events: the
arrival in Cairo of a strange letter secreted out of Mecca, and the
crossing of an enigmatic twenty-four-year-old man over the torn and
shell-pitted no-man’s-land of Gallipoli.</p>
<p>BY THE MIDSUMMER of 1915 on Gallipoli, so many men were dying in such
a confined space—in some spots, the opposing trenchlines were less than
thirty yards apart—that informal truces began to be called in order to
gather up the dead. The arrangements were usually worked out by local
commanders, so that at a specified time grave-digging parties from both
sides would step out into no-man’s-land and begin their ghastly
work.</p>
<p>This certainly appeared to be the intent of the Ottoman lieutenant
who, on the morning of August 20, climbed from his army’s forward trench
and, under the cover of a white flag, started across no-man’s-land.
Instead, upon reaching the British line, the young officer announced to
his startled hosts that he wished to surrender.</p>
<p>Following standard procedure, the man was bound and blindfolded and
passed down through the Med-Ex trenchworks to regimental headquarters.
If standard procedure had continued to be followed, he would have been
interrogated there by an intelligence officer, then sent on to the
central prisoner-of-war stockade before eventual transfer to a POW camp
in Cyprus or Egypt. But there was nothing at all standard about this
prisoner. His name was Mohammed al-Faroki, and despite his unassuming
appearance—he was just twenty-four and very slight—the story he told was
so remarkable that successive British officers felt their superiors
needed to hear it.</p>
<p>He claimed to be a member of a secret military society called al-Ahd
(the Awakening), comprised largely of Arab officers like himself, that
had been waiting in vain for months for the right conditions to stage a
revolt against their Turkish overseers. Rumors of shadowy fifth-column
networks inside the Ottoman Empire had become rather commonplace by that
summer, but what was different about Faroki was that he supplied a list
of his alleged al-Ahd coconspirators, most of them high-ranking
officers, complete with details on which units they commanded and where
they were currently deployed.</p>
<p>Testament to the importance given the lieutenant’s claims, on August
25, General Ian Hamilton, the overall commander of the Gallipoli
campaign, fired off a report to War Secretary Kitchener himself.
Deciding that the intelligence unit in Cairo was best equipped to judge
the truthfulness of the lieutenant’s story, London ordered Faroki put on
board a warship bound for Egypt.</p>
<p>At least initially, neither Gilbert Clayton, the overall commander of
the British military intelligence unit in Cairo, nor any of his
subordinates knew quite what to make of the young man brought to their
Savoy Hotel offices on September 10. Their attention was piqued,
however, when Faroki suggested the British had squandered a profound
military opportunity by not going ashore at Alexandretta in the spring
of 1915.</p>
<p>According to Faroki, not only had Alexandretta been guarded primarily
by Arab-conscript units at the time, with many of their commanders
committed al-Ahd members, but these units had even carefully sabotaged
the city’s defensive fortifications in anticipation of an imminent
British landing force. Those efforts had come to naught, obviously, when
the British instead launched their disastrous Gallipoli campaign. That
wasn’t the worst of it, however. Once Gallipoli started, Djemal Pasha
had swiftly sent the Arab units in Alexandretta to the battlefront; as a
result, Faroki explained, many of the would-be conspirators of al-Ahd
now lay dead on the Gallipoli hillsides, killed by the very “enemy” they
had hoped to join.</p>
<p>Up to this point, much of Faroki’s story was easy enough to verify.
The founder of al-Ahd, a man named Abdul Aziz al-Masri, was living in
exile in Cairo, and he was brought in to vouch for Faroki’s bona fides.
As for his claim that Alexandretta had been guarded by troops anxious to
mutiny, this was precisely what Lawrence had ascertained from his
interviews with Ottoman prisoners and had stressed in his lobbying for a
landing there. But Faroki had more to tell. A lot more.</p>
<p>For some time, he claimed, he had served as a kind of liaison between
al-Ahd and another Arab secret society, al-Fatat, in Damascus. From this
linking, al-Ahd had learned of the covert negotiations between al-Fatat
and Emir Hussein in Mecca toward staging a joint uprising against the
Turks. In the process, al-Ahd had also learned of the secret
correspondence between Emir Hussein and the British in Cairo. The upshot
of all this was that, if armed and supported by Britain, both Arab
secret societies, the civilian al-Fatat and the military al-Ahd, were
now prepared to join Emir Hussein in revolt against the Turks.</p>
<p>Such a partnership would come with a price, though: British
recognition of an independent Arab nation encompassing virtually the
entire Arab world, from Iraq in the east to Syria in the west and
extending down to the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The precise
parameters of this Arab nation were open to some limited negotiation—the
would-be rebels recognized Britain’s colonial claim to Aden and its
commercial interests in southern Iraq—but the one absolute precondition
was that the French were not to have a controlling presence anywhere. If
all that was agreed to, Faroki explained, then the British could have
their revolution in the heart of the Ottoman world.</p>
<p>It was here that the young lieutenant’s story began to strain
credulity. Obviously, Faroki had learned of the secret correspondence
between Emir Hussein and Ronald Storrs from somewhere, but apparently no
one in the Cairo military intelligence unit had even heard of al-Fatat.
As for Faroki’s assertion that this cell spoke for a vast network of
anti-Ottoman conspirators in Syria, Lawrence, given his long familiarity
with the Syrian political scene, was probably in the best position to
gauge that claim’s veracity, but nothing he had gleaned either before or
during the war suggested that such an extensive network existed. Even if
it did, anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of Arab society was likely
to find the notion of the progressive military and intellectual castes
of Syria and Iraq joining in alliance with the archconservative Emir
Hussein in Mecca a bit far-fetched.</p>
<p>Except for one thing. Just weeks before Faroki came across at
Gallipoli, Hussein had ended an eight-month silence and finally sent a
new message to Ronald Storrs. Absent from this letter was Hussein’s
earlier ambivalence, as well as his sense of proportion. Now he
purported to speak for “the whole of the Arab nation,” and his demands
for cooperation with the British had ballooned beyond mere
noninterference in the Hejaz, to British recognition of independence for
practically the entire Arab world.</p>
<p>So grandiose did Storrs find Hussein’s demands—he acidly commented
that they were “far more than he has the right, the hope, or the power
to expect”—that he and Henry McMahon, the new British high commissioner
for Egypt, decided that the best response was to simply ignore them
altogether. This had been done in McMahon’s reply to Hussein, sent
shortly before Faroki’s appearance.</p>
<p>Everything changed, though, when the specifics of Hussein’s July
letter were matched up against Faroki’s September statements, for what
was immediately apparent was that their stipulations and territorial
demands almost precisely matched. Viewed in this light, Hussein’s vague
reference to “the whole of the Arab nation” took on a very different
meaning, perhaps not delusions of grandeur by the Hejazi emir but rather
an allusion to his secret partnership with the al-Fatat and al-Ahd
conspirators. It suddenly occurred to British officials in Cairo that
they might have seriously underestimated Hussein, that far more than
potentially triggering an insurrection in a remote corner of the Ottoman
Empire, the enigmatic old man in Mecca just might hold the key to the
entire Middle Eastern theater of the war.</p>
<p>But there was still more. With his customary opaqueness, Hussein had
introduced the specter of a ticking clock in his last missive, saying
that Britain had thirty days from the receipt of his letter to accept or
reject his terms, beyond which the Arabs “reserve to themselves complete
freedom of action.” Storrs and McMahon had paid little attention to this
veiled threat at the time, but as Mohammed al-Faroki now informed them,
this ultimatum was the result of a tantalizing offer recently made to
Hussein by Djemal Pasha: full Arab independence in the postwar era,
provided the Arabs lent wholehearted support to the Turkish-German war
effort in the meantime.</p>
<p>The choice before the British, then, could not have appeared more
stark: come to an agreement with Hussein and his coconspirators that
might paralyze the Ottoman Empire from within, or, conversely, watch
Hussein and the Arabs make their peace with Constantinople, a peace that
would undoubtedly result in a reinvigorated call to jihad against the
Allies, and just might be the spark to finally set the Muslim
populations of their colonies aflame. With Prime Minister Asquith and
his cabinet kept fully apprised, British diplomats in London and Cairo
scrambled to send off a new and far more respectful message to the emir
in Mecca. Thus began one of history’s most controversial exchanges of
secret messages, the so-called McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, the
ramifications of which would soon embroil the British government—as well
as its future agent in Arabia, T. E. Lawrence—in a complex web of
misunderstandings, conflicting promises, and deceit.</p>
<p>In the short term, the revelations of Mohammed al-Faroki enabled
Lawrence to return to the goal that had consumed him ever since arriving
in Cairo nine months earlier: a British landing at Alexandretta.</p>
<p>FROM THE ATHLIT promontory on clear days, Aaron Aaronsohn and Absalom
Feinberg could easily make out the British and French warships that
trolled the Palestinian coastline, imposing their blockade. It would be
off one of these warships, they’d assumed, that they would eventually
receive a message from Alex in Cairo—perhaps delivered by Alex himself.
As the days and weeks passed, however, their confidence in this
wavered.</p>
<p>After nearly a month with no word, Aaronsohn and Feinberg settled on
a risky backup plan. If the wait lasted much longer, Feinberg would take
one of the small fishing boats that plied the coast, head straight out
for one of the blockade ships, and try to talk his way on board. In
mid-August, though, word came that the blockade was being tightened, the
Allied warships now given license to destroy on sight any vessel they
deemed suspicious; since this criterion surely attached to a strange
vessel trying to make an approach, it rendered the backup plan less a
risky venture than a suicidal one. Then came more bad news. In late
August, it was announced (erroneously, it would turn out) that the
refugee boatlift was coming to an end, that USS Des Moines would be
making just one more call at Haifa harbor on August 30. When that
American warship sailed over the horizon, the conspirators believed, so
too would their last best chance to make contact with the British.</p>
<p>To Feinberg’s urging that he go out on the ship, Aaronsohn stoutly
refused. Instead, it was Feinberg, in disguise and carrying a forged
Russian passport, who talked his way aboard the Des Moines. A week
later, he found himself on the docks of Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>Feinberg had just one contact in Egypt, but it turned out to be a
good one: a young Christian Arab originally from Haifa who was now
working as a courier for the British naval intelligence headquarters at
Port Said. In Port Said, Feinberg tracked down his old friend, who
quickly arranged a meeting with one of the unit’s intelligence officers.
That officer happened to be T. E. Lawrence’s old partner at Carchemish
as well as on the Zin expedition, Leonard Woolley.</p>
<p>What Feinberg didn’t know—could not have known—was that Alex
Aaronsohn had in fact made contact with British intelligence in Egypt.
After a series of rebuffs, he’d finally gained an audience with a senior
member of the military intelligence staff in Cairo on August 18. That
officer had been T. E. Lawrence’s other partner on the Zin expedition,
Captain Stewart Newcombe. But that meeting had not gone at all well.
Newcombe had taken a wary view of Alex Aaronsohn from the start, and
that wariness only deepened when the earnest twenty-six-year-old began
detailing the Jewish spy network supposedly standing by in Palestine to
aid the British. It had been just two months since Minna Weizmann, Curt
Prüfer’s protégée, was unmasked as a spy, and British intelligence
agents in Egypt were now alerted to the German scheme of employing
Jewish refugees from Palestine as conduits. But perhaps what most
aroused Newcombe’s suspicion was that Alex Aaronsohn appeared to want
nothing tangible in return for his services. As a senior intelligence
officer, Newcombe was constantly besieged by self-proclaimed spies who,
in return for their “valuable information,” wanted money or weapons or
help with legal problems; it simply didn’t gibe that Alex Aaronsohn was
offering up this purported treasure trove of information out of the
goodness of his heart. As a result, and in what was surely one of the
greatest miscalculations of his intelligence career, Newcombe had not
only rebuffed Aaronsohn’s offer, but ordered him from the country. Of
course, Alex had no way of communicating any of this to his brother
anxiously waiting back in Palestine; on September 3, just three days
before Absalom Feinberg arrived in Alexandria, Alex and his sister Rivka
had gone out of that same harbor on a ship bound for New York.</p>
<p>But Feinberg was to have much better luck with Leonard Woolley.
Implicitly trusting the intense young man who had been brought before
him, Woolley devised a system whereby a British spy ship might
periodically troll past the research station in Athlit. Through a
prearranged series of codes, the conspirators would signal out to the
spy ship when there was information to be collected, and under the cover
of darkness, either a small boat or a swimmer would be sent ashore to
retrieve it.</p>
<p>There was only one way to both establish the coding system and test
the efficacy of this plan: by sneaking Feinberg back into Palestine
aboard one of the spy ships. After concluding his arrangements with
Woolley, Feinberg waited for the right conditions—a calm sea, a moonless
night—for his voyage home.</p>
<p>ONE PERSON WHO knew nothing of Newcombe’s and Woolley’s dealings with
the would-be spies from Palestine that late summer was their former Zin
expedition partner, T. E. Lawrence. This was partly due to the
compartmentalization policy adhered to by British intelligence in Egypt,
and partly to Lawrence’s intense focus on one issue: a British landing
at Alexandretta. By mid-October, the last pieces of that plan appeared
to be falling into place, and the letter he penned to his parents
strived for that delicate balance between excitement and sufficient
obliqueness to get past the military censors:</p>
<p>“There is going to be a rather busy winter in the Levant,” he wrote.
“I am pleased on the whole with things. They have gone against us so far
that our Government has become more reasonable, and the final settlement
out here, though it will take long, will I think, be very satisfactory.
We have to thank our [past] failures for that.”</p>
<p>For Lawrence, the most excruciating aspect of Faroki’s story was his
description of the situation that had existed in Alexandretta in the
winter of 1915, carrying as it did the suggestion that a British landing
force might have practically strolled ashore there. Obviously,
circumstances were much changed now, the al-Ahd-dominated military units
long since moved elsewhere, but in the autumn of 1915, Lawrence and
other advocates of an Alexandretta landing could point to several new
factors that made their argument nearly as compelling.</p>
<p>Having sat out the first year of the war, Bulgaria had finally come
in on the side of the Central Powers in late September. This meant the
enemy now had an unbroken land route and rail line connecting Germany to
Turkey, allowing for the quick and easy transfer of troops and weaponry.
At the same time, British war planners, finally accepting Gallipoli for
the fiasco it had been all along, were quietly drawing up plans for a
withdrawal. Taken together, these two developments meant British Egypt
was likely to be targeted anew, and by a much-better-equipped enemy. To
hamper such an offensive, taking control of the Alexandretta Basin would
not merely disrupt the enemy’s main supply line, but sever it—and if
that action did in fact spark a regional Arab uprising, the Turks would
have a whole new set of problems to deal with.</p>
<p>Another new factor argued for Alexandretta, one for which the
mercurial personality of Djemal Pasha could be thanked. In tacit
opposition to his co-pashas in Constantinople, Djemal had given refuge
to at least eighty thousand Armenian survivors of the Anatolian killing
fields, and had organized many of the Armenian men into labor
battalions. These refugees and labor battalions were concentrated in the
Alexandretta region—some eight thousand had been put to work on the
railroad tunnels being cut through the Amanus and Taurus Mountains—and
even if they might be grateful to the pasha who had at least temporarily
saved their lives, this Armenian population would most certainly regard
arriving British soldiers as liberators and rush to their side.
Attending that, of course, would be the public relations coup—an aspect
of war Lawrence was always sensitive to—of Britain freeing untold
thousands of Christian Armenians from servitude or death.</p>
<p>Through the strenuous lobbying of Lawrence and other members of the
Cairo military intelligence staff, by late October the two most
important British officials in Egypt—High Commissioner Henry McMahon and
Major General John Maxwell, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force—had been won over to the revived Alexandretta scheme. Better yet,
these two men were about to hold a summit meeting with a visiting Lord
Kitchener to decide the future course of the war in the eastern
Mediterranean. The stars were finally aligning, so much so that Lawrence
felt confident the seemingly impregnable walls of military idiocy were
about to be breached.</p>
<p>“Things are boiling over this weekend,” Lawrence wrote to a friend on
November 4, on the eve of the Kitchener summit meeting, “and we have
never been so busy before! This is a good omen, and a thing to make one
very content.”</p>
<p>The meeting between Kitchener, McMahon, and Maxwell took place on a
ship off the Aegean island of Mudros on November 10 and 11. After an
initial reluctance, the war secretary, too, came to embrace the
Alexandretta plan, and fired off a cable to the prime minister urging
its immediate approval.</p>
<p>But in London the idea had a more mixed reception. Amid the
continuing carnage on the Western Front, the British high command was
already struggling to find enough new men to throw into that meat
grinder, and the notion of siphoning off matériel and soldiers—the
revised Alexandretta plan now called for as many as 100,000 troops—was a
difficult sell. Additionally, the misadventure at Gallipoli was hardly
an advertisement for the wisdom of new amphibious landings on the
Ottoman Front. In a flurry of cables passed between Kitchener’s ship and
various ministries in London, a debate ensued.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment, a French liaison officer attached to
Kitchener’s shipboard retinue decided the matter, firing off a cable to
Paris alerting his government to the British deliberations.</p>
<p>Having been under the impression that they had killed off the
Alexandretta scheme back in the winter of 1915, the French government
now felt compelled to do so in more explicit form. On November 13, the
French military attaché in London handed a letter to General William
Robertson, the chief of the British Imperial General Staff and overall
commander of the British army. After reasserting France’s economic and
political interests in Syria, the letter stated that “French public
opinion could not be indifferent to anything that would be attempted in
a country that they consider already as being intended to become a part
of the future [French-controlled] Syria; and they would require of the
French Government that not only could no military operation be
undertaken in this particular country before it has been concerted
between the Allies, but even that, should such an action be taken, the
greater part of the task should be entrusted to the French troops and
the Generals commanding them.”</p>
<p>Its obtuse diplomatic language aside, the letter essentially repeated
France’s earlier objections to an Alexandretta landing: since France
intended to take over Syria after the war, French forces needed to be in
the vanguard of any military operation in the area, and since no French
troops could currently be spared for such a mission, that precluded any
mission being conducted at all. What was shocking this time around,
though, was that the French would actually commit such a squalid
argument to paper. British historian Basil Liddell Hart wrote of the
French directive that “this must surely be one of the most astounding
documents ever presented to an Ally when engaged in a life and death
struggle. For it imposed what was really a veto on the best opportunity
of cutting the common enemy’s life-line and of protecting our own.” By
acquiescing to such an outrage, Liddell Hart contended, the British
General Staff were essentially “accessories to the crime,” that crime
being that the British in Egypt had now been given no alternative but to
await another assault on the Suez Canal, and to then launch their own
attack against the very strongest point of the Turkish line—the narrow
front of southern Palestine—an approach that was to ultimately cost them
fifty thousand more casualties.</p>
<p>To the disbelief of Lawrence and others on the intelligence staff in
Cairo, the Alexandretta plan was quashed anew, never to seriously be
raised again.</p>
<p>Back in February 1915, when the plan had first been scuttled,
Lawrence had bitterly suggested to his family that France was the true
enemy in Syria. In the wake of the second scuttling in November 1915 was
born an enmity that would cause him to view all future French actions in
the region with utter distrust.</p>
<p>SOON AFTER THE death of her son Frank, Sarah Lawrence had chided her
second son, “Ned,” for something that clearly remained a sore point: his
failure to visit Frank at his military boot camp in late 1914, prior to
Ned’s departure for Egypt. T. E. Lawrence had responded to his mother’s
criticism with a logic so matter-of-fact as to border on the perverse.
“I didn’t go say goodbye to Frank,” he explained, “because he would
rather I didn’t, and I knew there was little chance of my seeing him
again; in which case, we were better without a parting.”</p>
<p>Lawrence had responded very differently in March 1915 when he learned
that the ship transporting his brother Will back to England from India
was passing through the Suez Canal. Not having seen Will since his visit
to Carchemish in 1913, Lawrence had briefly put aside his work at the
Savoy Hotel, mounted his Triumph motorcycle, and raced the eighty miles
out to Port Suez to meet his brother’s ship when it docked.</p>
<p>Just before he got there, however, a skirmish broke out somewhere
along the canal, delaying Will’s ship. Instead of a face-to-face
meeting, all the brothers were able to arrange was a brief ship-to-shore
telephone conversation. That same evening, Lawrence remounted his
motorcycle and returned to his work in Cairo.</p>
<p>In volunteering to serve as an aerial spotter for the Royal Flying
Corps, Will had chosen a position that came with one of the shortest
life expectancies for any soldier in World War I. On October 23, 1915,
Will was killed when his plane was shot down over France, his body never
recovered. He was twenty-six years old, and had been at the front for
less than a week.</p>
<p>The effect of losing two brothers in just five months seemed to draw
Lawrence even deeper into his emotional shell. For the next several
months, his letters home grew steadily more infrequent and terse.
Indeed, while he had quickly dropped nearly all mention of Frank in
writing to his parents, there is no record of his even acknowledging
Will’s death at the time, save for one oblique allusion. It was in a
short note he sent home that December:</p>
<p>I’m writing just a few words this morning, because it has surprised
me by being Christmas day. I’m afraid that for you it will be no very
happy day; however you have still Bob and Arnie left at home, which is
far more than many people can have. Look forward all the time.
Everything here is as usual, only we had a shower of rain yesterday, and
it has been cool lately.</p>
