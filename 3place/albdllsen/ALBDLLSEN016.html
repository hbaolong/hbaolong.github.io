<h4 id="chapter-14-hubris">Chapter 14 Hubris</h4>
<p>Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the Arabs do it
tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to
help them, not to win it for them. Actually also, under the very odd
conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as perhaps
you think it is.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, ADVICE TO BRITISH OFFICERS, IN TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES,
AUGUST 1917</p>
<p>On the morning of July 10, 1917, Gilbert Clayton was seeing to one of
his drearier tasks, composing the weekly status report on the Arabian
war theater for the military intelligence director in London. As he had
done many times in recent months with only the slightest variation, he
prefaced the memo with the comment that “nothing has occurred of great
importance in the Hejaz since I last wrote,” before providing a quick
rundown of battle plans yet to be acted upon, small successes that
should have been greater, opportunities squandered.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report went out the door to the telegraph office, a
tiny figure in a dirty Arab robe wandered into Clayton’s office. Taking
his visitor for a local favor seeker, or perhaps an enterprising beggar
boy, the distracted general was in the process of shooing him out the
door when he noticed the familiar lopsided grin, the piercing light blue
eyes. It was T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Sitting his emaciated subordinate down, Clayton urgently pressed for
details on all that had transpired in the two months since Lawrence had
set off into the Arabian interior and vanished from view. The general
then dashed off an excited postscript to his weekly status report:
“Since writing the above and just as I send it to the mail, Captain
Lawrence has arrived after a journey through enemy country which is
little short of marvelous.” There followed a brief synopsis of the
capture of Aqaba, as well as of Lawrence’s intelligence-gathering
mission across Syria. “I have not yet been able to discuss his journey
with Lawrence as he has only just arrived and is somewhat exhausted by
1,300 miles on a camel in the last 30 days.… I think, however, that you
would be interested in the above brief sketch of a very remarkable
performance, calling for a display of courage, resource and endurance
which is conspicuous even in these days when gallant deeds are of daily
occurrence.”</p>
<p>Ironically, some of Lawrence’s greatest travails in reaching Cairo
had come in trying to navigate the British lines. The previous
afternoon, he and his small band of escorts had reached the eastern bank
of the Suez Canal, having made the 150-mile trek from Aqaba in an
astounding forty-nine hours, only to find the British guardposts there
abandoned (due to a cholera outbreak, Lawrence would later learn).
Finding an operable field telephone, he repeatedly called over to the
army’s ferry transport office on the opposite shore to request a boat,
only to be just as repeatedly hung up on. At last he reached a logistics
officer who knew him from Wejh, and a launch was sent.</p>
<p>In that first moment of safety, two months to the day since he had
set out from Wejh, Lawrence’s strength finally gave out, and it was all
he could do to drag himself to the Port Suez officers’ billet at the
Sinai Hotel. “After conquering its first hostile impression of me and my
dress,” he wrote, “[the hotel] produced the hot baths and the cold
drinks (six of them) and the dinner and bed of my dreams.”</p>
<p>His ordeal continued into the next day. Barefoot and still clad in
his ragged Arab robes, Lawrence was repeatedly stopped and questioned by
military police during his train journey to Cairo. His luck turned on
the train platform at Ismailia when he caught the notice of a senior
British naval officer who recognized him from his Red Sea crossings. It
was a fortunate meeting; the military high command in Cairo was quickly
alerted to what had happened in Aqaba, and by that afternoon the first
supplies and reinforcements were being rushed to the rebel-held
port.</p>
<p>On the Ismailia platform, Lawrence also learned of a major
development that had occurred in his absence. Following his defeat at
the Second Battle of Gaza, Archibald Murray had been removed from
command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. His replacement, a cavalry
general named Edmund Allenby, had arrived in Cairo less than two weeks
earlier. Initially, Lawrence greeted this news with dismay. It had taken
months of painstaking ministrations by himself and Clayton and everyone
else at the Arab Bureau to even partially win over the prickly Murray to
the idea of supporting the Arab Revolt. Now they would have to start
over from scratch, and Lawrence envisioned many more months lost in the
education of Edmund Allenby.</p>
<p>But upon reaching Cairo, Lawrence was to discover something else.
Already, word of his exploits was spreading through the British military
command, and to electrifying effect. Coming on the heels of the defeat
at Gaza, the stasis in the Hejaz, and the ceaselessly grim news from
Europe—another Allied offensive on the Western Front had failed, the
French army was mutinying, the Russian government was collapsing—here
was some genuinely cheering news, a sterling example of British daring
and pluck. Even beyond the fantastic manner in which it had been
achieved, Aqaba’s capture meant the Arab war effort had abruptly
leapfrogged 250 miles to the north and made the task of carrying that
effort into Syria dramatically simpler.</p>
<p>Curiously, though, it was Lawrence’s subsidiary feat, his long and
perilous journey through the Syrian heartland, that seemed to most
capture the imagination and accolades of his countrymen. Part of it was
surely the romantic image it conjured, one with many antecedents in
British military lore: the lone adventurer (never mind that Lawrence had
actually been accompanied by two scouts) sneaking behind enemy lines in
disguise and with a bounty on his head, his clandestine meetings with
would-be conspirators, the threat of betrayal and tortured death
stalking his every turn. Certainly it was this aspect that most inspired
Reginald Wingate in recommending Lawrence be awarded the Victoria Cross,
Britain’s highest military decoration. As Wingate pointed out, what
“considerably enhanced the gallantry” of Lawrence’s exploit was that it
had been conducted amid “a highly venal population” even with a £5,000
Turkish reward on his head.</p>
<p>Lawrence, as noted, minimized the importance of that trek. Indeed,
the few details he ever provided on it were in an obliquely worded
four-page report he wrote immediately upon his arrival in Cairo. Ever
the strategist, however, he evidently realized that in the official
reaction to his Syrian adventure, he had been handed a powerful
instrument to further his goals. He deftly wielded that instrument when
brought before the new EEF commander, General Edmund Allenby.</p>
<p>Given the elaborate decorum that existed within the British military
of 1917, it’s hard to imagine a more incongruous meeting than the one
that took place at the Cairo General Headquarters on the afternoon of
July 12. Nicknamed “Bloody Bull” for his explosive temper, Edmund
Allenby was a towering man with the physique of a boxer gone slightly to
seed, an intimidating presence even when not clad in his general’s dress
uniform. On the opposite side of his desk sat the wraithlike Captain T.
E. Lawrence, perhaps 135 pounds when healthy but now reduced to less
than a hundred by the rigors of his desert exploits, dressed in a white
Arab robe and turban and, by his own account (though it seems
improbable), shoeless; Lawrence’s uniform had been destroyed by moths
during his long absence from Cairo, so he would claim, and he had yet to
find time to replace it.</p>
<p>Lawrence surely knew something of Allenby’s war record, including
that it was a somewhat checkered one. During the British withdrawal at
the battle of Mons in August 1914, Allenby had ordered his cavalry
regiment to stand their ground before a much larger advancing German
force, thereby enabling the rest of the beleaguered army to make an
orderly retreat. Coincidentally, it was during that same battle that
Archibald Murray, then the chief of the Imperial General Staff and
monitoring the British retreat from a central command post, had fainted
away from the tension. Much more recently, however, Allenby’s star had
been eclipsed at the battle of Arras, where he was criticized for being
slow to take advantage of breaches in the German line to drive his men
forward—a relative point, perhaps, in an engagement that saw the British
advance less than two miles at the cost of 150,000 casualties.</p>
<p>As with Murray, then, Allenby’s transfer to Egypt was meant as a
demotion, but where this had induced a kind of crippling caution in
Murray, Lawrence sensed it might spur something very different in
Allenby. In the general’s office that afternoon, he proceeded to paint a
wondrously ambitious portrait of what the Arab rebels now stood poised
to achieve. So long as Aqaba was quickly bolstered as the chief staging
point, he explained, the Arabs could at last take their fight into the
Syrian heartland. And not in any small way; in Lawrence’s telling, there
was now the opportunity to set the whole region aflame.</p>
<p>To complement the threadbare report on his Syrian spying mission,
Lawrence had made a little hand-drawn map to illustrate his plan to the
general. It depicted no fewer than seven prospective Arab forces
attacking the Turks across the length of Syria, as far west as the
Lebanon coast and as far north as the cities of Homs and Hama, one
hundred miles above Damascus. While he cautioned in his cover note that
“there is little hope of things working out just as planned,” if even
some aspects of Lawrence’s blueprint came to fruition, the bulk of
Turkish forces deployed across northern and eastern Syria would find
themselves stranded, unable to advance or even to easily retreat.</p>
<p>There was a catch, though. For this grand Arab uprising to succeed,
Lawrence told Allenby, it required a simultaneous British army
breakthrough in southern Palestine. Once that had been achieved, the two
forces could move north in lethal tandem, the Arab irregulars shutting
down the Hejaz Railway and marooning the Turks in their garrison towns
in eastern Syria, while the British army, their inland flank protected
by the Arabs’ actions, advanced up the western coastal shelf. In
Lawrence’s plotting, even the quick capture of Damascus and Jerusalem
were within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>But there was another small catch. The fighters who would serve as
the crucial linchpin to this Arab strike force, the Bedouin of eastern
Syria, traditionally trekked farther east in autumn in search of better
forage for their camels, effectively leaving the war theater. To make
use of these essential warriors, Lawrence explained, action would have
to commence no later than mid-September, or in about two months’
time.</p>
<p>It’s not altogether clear how much of this extravagant vision
Lawrence himself actually believed. Even if flushed by his recent
triumph at Aqaba, he was surely still too much the pragmatist to imagine
that all the inertia and tribal squabbling that forever shadowed the
Arab Revolt would somehow now melt away. He’d also undoubtedly had
enough experience with the British military to know that haste was not
its strong suit. Most likely, in putting forward his grandiose scheme he
saw the chance to win over the new British commander in chief—unschooled
in the sluggish pace with which events moved in the region, eager to
redeem his soldier’s reputation in the wake of Arras—to his own vision
of a joint Arab-British liberation of Syria. It was a vision Allenby
would have to embrace or reject quickly, of course, since Lawrence had
also set a ticking clock.</p>
<p>But if there was an element of bluff in all this, who could possibly
catch him out? T. E. Lawrence was now a celebrity in Cairo, the magical
manager of Arab tribes, as well as the only British officer to have
personally taken the pulse of their potential fifth columnists inside
Syria. Even if he knew those prospective collaborators were nowhere near
ready to rise up in two months, it’s not as if anyone else knew.
Instead, so long as the almost inevitable delay tripped up the British
timetable, his secret knowledge of Arab unpreparedness would remain
safe, and in the meantime he would have forged an alliance—and a mutual
dependency—that couldn’t be broken.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence all but admitted to this game: “Allenby
could not make out how much [of me] was genuine performer and how much
charlatan. The problem was working behind his eyes, and I left him
unhelped to solve it.”</p>
<p>And it was a performance that succeeded brilliantly. At the end of
their meeting, the general raised his chin and announced, “Well, I will
do for you what I can.”</p>
<p>If he kept it low-key with Lawrence, Allenby let his enthusiasm be
known to his superiors, including General William Robertson, chief of
the Imperial General Staff and the overall coordinator of the British
war effort. “The advantages offered by Arab co-operation on lines
proposed by Captain Lawrence,” he cabled Robertson on July 19, “are, in
my opinion, of such importance that no effort should be spared to reap
full benefit therefrom.… If successfully carried out, such a movement,
in conjunction with [British] offensive operations in Palestine, may
cause a collapse of the Turkish campaigns in the Hejaz and in Syria and
produce far-reaching results, both political as well as military.” So
vital did Allenby view the scheme that he passed on Lawrence’s concern
of losing the eastern Bedouin to their autumn grazing grounds should
there be a delay. “I therefore ought to be prepared to undertake such
operations as may be possible with the force at my disposal by the
middle of September.”</p>
<p>Even Robertson, a committed “Westerner” loath to entertain ambitious
plans in the East, was quickly sold on the idea; at the culmination of a
flurry of cables between Cairo and London that July, he promised to
immediately send Allenby as many as fifty thousand more troops for his
upcoming Palestine offensive. It all marked an astounding turnaround in
fortunes for the Arab Revolt. Just two months earlier, the rebels had
been regarded as little more than a sideshow nuisance by Archibald
Murray; now they were setting the timetable for the next British
offensive in Palestine.</p>
<p>But the newly strengthened Arab-British alliance also signaled a
change on the political front, one that General Allenby may not have
appreciated or cared about, but that T. E. Lawrence most certainly did.
Until recently, British planners had been pondering strategies to
minimize the Arab rebels’ role in Syria out of deference to their French
allies. Now, by signing on to Allenby’s plan—which really meant
Lawrence’s plan—the British military was setting on a course that
completely ignored French concerns, and would eventually cast the whole
framework of Sykes-Picot in doubt.</p>
<p>That was all a bit in the future, however, and in the interim, praise
for Lawrence’s exploits continued to come in from all quarters. Though
he was found to be ineligible to receive the Victoria Cross (one of its
stipulations is that the heroic deed must be observed by a fellow
Briton), he was soon promoted to major, as well as named a Companion of
the Order of the Bath, one of the highest levels in the British
chivalric system available to junior military officers.</p>
<p>Amid his newfound celebrity, in early August Lawrence was asked to
jot down his insights on working with Arabs for those British officers
being sent for duty in the Hejaz, to share his secrets of success in a
realm where so many others had come to crushing despair. The result was
a short treatise he entitled Twenty-Seven Articles. Some of his
recommendations were commonsense, while others must have seemed rather
exotic to his pupils. “A slave brought up in the Hejaz is the best
servant,” he advised, “but there are rules against British subjects
owning them, so they will have to be lent to you. In any case, take with
you an Ageyli [tribesman] or two when you go up country. They are the
most efficient couriers in Arabia, and understand camels.”</p>
<p>Above all, Lawrence counseled his readers to shuck their English
ways, to so totally immerse themselves in the local environment as to
know its “families, clans and tribes, friends and enemies, wells, hills
and roads.”</p>
<p>Within the parochial British military culture of 1917, Twenty-Seven
Articles had the force of revelation—and indeed, the tract continues to
have profound influence today. Amid the American military “surge” in
Iraq in 2006, the U.S. commander in chief, General David Petraeus,
ordered his senior officers to read Twenty-Seven Articles so that they
might gain clues on winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.
Presumably skipped over was Lawrence’s opening admonition that his
advice applied strictly to Bedouin—about 2 percent of the Iraqi
population—and that interacting with Arab townspeople “require[s]
totally different treatment.”</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN AND Captain Ian Smith had never been close. From
their first meeting, Smith, the EMSIB (Eastern Mediterranean Special
Intelligence Bureau) liaison to the spy ships operating out of Port
Said, had made little attempt to hide his low regard for the Jewish spy
ring in Palestine. From that inauspicious beginning, Smith—“always an
idiot” in the agronomist’s estimation—had seemed to go out of his way to
slight Aaronsohn and his confederates in ways large and small, as if it
were the British who were doing a great favor to the Jewish spies rather
than the reverse.</p>
<p>No amount of past insults, however, quite prepared Aaronsohn for
those of July 1. Evidently irritated that Aaronsohn had complained of
his shabby treatment to an officer in the Arab Bureau, Smith acidly told
the NILI ringleader that his spies in Palestine “are no good. The work
can be done much better by others.”</p>
<p>Making the episode especially galling was that it came at a time when
the British were piling on NILI’s workload at every turn—and in ways
that went far beyond intelligence gathering. In the wake of the
sacking-of-Jaffa story in May, an international relief effort had gone
up to raise funds for its Jewish victims. To the obvious question of how
such funds might reach the needy within Palestine, someone in the
British hierarchy hit on the just as obvious answer: the NILI network.
And so long as the NILI operatives were distributing relief funds across
Palestine, why not propaganda materials as well? And how about in their
spare time, they also carry out sabotage attacks? At the beginning of
June, plans had been drawn up to smuggle explosives ashore at Athlit so
that a NILI team might blow up a crucial railroad bridge in the Jordan
valley; toward that goal, Aaronsohn’s chief lieutenant in Egypt, Liova
Schneersohn, was now undergoing demolition training at a British army
testing ground on the Cairo outskirts.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn had reluctantly agreed to each of these new demands put on
his organization, seeing it as the price to be paid for British favor,
but it made the insult from Ian Smith simply too much to bear. As he
informed his allies in the Arab Bureau the day after that confrontation,
since EMSIB apparently now had other and better operatives in Palestine,
“I no longer had the right to endanger my people in continuing the
work.” Therefore, he was shutting down NILI.</p>
<p>Because it wasn’t as if Aaronsohn lacked other reasons to feel
grossly underappreciated that summer. At the core was the continuing
mystery of just what his status was in Cairo, of where he and his
organization fit into the larger scheme of things. In his meetings with
Mark Sykes in April and May, Aaronsohn had learned that the British
politician was working closely with two leaders of the English Zionist
Federation, Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolow, in London. In fact, during
his time in Cairo, Sykes had urged Weizmann to come out to Egypt to
spearhead the Zionist effort there but, in lieu of that, to appoint
Aaronsohn as his local “representative.” Aaronsohn had gone along with
the plan out of deference to Sykes, even though he was quite at odds
with the milder brand of Zionism of Weizmann and Sokolow—but then he had
received absolutely no communication from either man since. So vague had
his status remained, and so futile his own efforts to receive guidance
from the Zionist Federation that, just days before his run-in with
Smith, he had asked Gilbert Clayton to take the matter up with Mark
Sykes. Even this, though, had yielded nothing.</p>
<p>Thus out of the loop, Aaronsohn also remained quite unaware that his
cherished Zionist cause was actually making great strides in London—and
largely through the efforts of the tireless if uncommunicative Chaim
Weizmann.</p>
<p>The campaign to prod the British government into a public declaration
in support of a Jewish homeland had recently undergone a major overhaul.
At one time, Weizmann had stressed the effect that such a declaration
would have on American Zionists, causing them to add their influential
voice to those calling for an end to American neutrality and
intervention on the side of the Entente; obviously, that argument had
lost much of its luster with the United States’ entry into the war. Also
headed toward oblivion that summer was the parallel contention that such
a declaration would spur Russian Jews to rally to the prowar government
of Alexander Kerensky; with the chaos in Russia deepening by the day,
Kerensky’s problems were now far beyond the point where Jewish support
might make much difference. In early June, though, Weizmann had found a
potent new argument courtesy of the Central Powers.</p>
<p>As Weizmann explained in a June 12 meeting with Robert Cecil, the
British assistant secretary of state for foreign affairs, for many
months he had been hearing rumors that the German government was trying
to enlist leaders of the German Jewish community to act as
intermediaries for a prospective peace deal. Weizmann had long dismissed
these rumors, but recently they had gained great credence; in fact, he
told Cecil, he had heard that German Jewish leaders were now actively
considering such a role, provided the kaiser’s regime met their demand
for a Jewish state in Palestine. This the German government was
evidently contemplating, judging by the recent and unprecedented spate
of articles in the German press in support of a Jewish homeland.</p>
<p>To the degree that any of this was substantially true, the message
was plain—that if the British didn’t play the Jewish-homeland card soon,
the Germans surely would—and Robert Cecil was a quick pupil. The day
after his meeting with Weizmann, he sent a confidential memorandum to
his superior, Lord Charles Hardinge. “There can be no doubt that a
complete change of front on the part of the German Government has taken
place,” Cecil wrote, “and that orders have been given to treat Zionism
as an important political factor in the policy of the Central Empires.”
The purpose of that change, in his estimation, was to influence the
opinion of international Jewry “and to utilize it in the interests of
German propaganda against the Entente.”</p>
<p>In hopes of averting this potentially calamitous outcome, Cecil
explained, his recent visitor had put forward a helpful suggestion.
“Dr. Weizmann concluded by urging very strongly that it was desirable
from every point of view that His Majesty’s Government should give an
open expression of their sympathy with, and support of, Zionist aims,
and should publicly recognize the justice of Jewish claims on
Palestine.”</p>
<p>With alarm bells over a possible German-sponsored Jewish state
reverberating through the British Foreign Office that June, this was a
suggestion that an increasing number of senior British officials were
ready to heed.</p>
<p>If all this remained unknown to Aaron Aaronsohn, it was also unknown
to those Arab Bureau officials who scrambled to put out the fire sparked
by Captain Smith’s comments of July 1. Instead, they were just trying to
save Britain’s most important spy network in Palestine from shutting
down.</p>
<p>As part of a renewed effort to show Aaronsohn respect, Smith was
forced to apologize for his comments, and the agronomist was soon given
an audience with the new EEF commander in chief, Edmund Allenby. Their
meeting took place on the morning of July 17, just five days after
Allenby’s discussions with T. E. Lawrence. In a leisurely conversation,
Aaronsohn filled in the general on a variety of topics regarding
Palestine, everything from its agricultural conditions to the fighting
abilities of its Turkish garrison, and even provided character sketches
of Djemal Pasha—“very much inclined to plot, and clever at it”—and the
German commander in Syria. “The [commander in chief] listened with
interest,” Aaronsohn noted, “and questioned me intelligently, ‘to the
point.’ He made an excellent impression on me.”</p>
<p>In the afterglow of that meeting with Allenby, Aaronsohn may have
felt he had at long last “arrived” with the British in Cairo. Then
again, he’d felt that at various other times over the preceding seven
months. The problem was, with the British forever striving to keep all
options open, reluctant to ever give anyone either a positive or
negative straight answer, there really was no such thing as having
“arrived,” the hearty embrace avoided for the cautious pat on the back.
This was compounded in Aaronsohn’s case by the new machinations in
London over a possible declaration of support for a Jewish homeland, a
generalized anxiety within much of the British government over where
that might lead. As a result, the goal was to keep Aaronsohn happy but
in limbo, to maintain that fine balance between encouraging his efforts
and remaining circumspect as to their ultimate reward.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the British could rely on a man with considerable skill
at such things, Reginald Wingate. “I gather,” Wingate wrote a senior
Foreign Office diplomat on July 23 upon learning of the government’s
latest tentative overture to the British Zionists, “that the matter is
by no means decided, and that you wish me to keep Aaronsohn satisfied
without telling him anything very definite. This has been done.”</p>
<p>ON JULY 16, the captain of the British troopship HMS Dufferin was
told to stand by at Port Suez in order to transport an important
official down the Red Sea coast to Jeddah. The next morning, the ship’s
crew caught first sight of their distinguished guest when
twenty-eight-year-old T. E. Lawrence sauntered up the gangway. It was a
long way from the day, eight months earlier, when Lawrence had walked up
another naval ship’s gangway in Yenbo harbor only to be soundly rebuked
for his unkempt uniform and insolent manner.</p>
<p>One measure of how greatly his stock had risen in the wake of Aqaba
was the mission he was undertaking to Jeddah. In his discussions with
Generals Allenby and Clayton, Lawrence had emphatically—and perhaps
quite exaggeratedly—told of the abiding esteem with which the Syrians
held Faisal ibn Hussein; they saw him as the Arabs’ overall military
commander, he had explained, and it was under his banner that they would
rise in revolt. As with most everything else Lawrence stated in Cairo
that July, his superiors had little way of either confirming or refuting
this assertion, it simply becoming part of the narrative of what lay in
store once the battle for Syria was joined.</p>
<p>From this, Lawrence saw the opening to go one better: to fully
coordinate the joint Arab-British offensive in Syria—and, not
coincidentally, to permanently weld the fortunes of the Arab cause to
those of the British army—why not place Faisal and his forces directly
under Allenby’s military command? Lawrence had gained quick approval of
this idea in Cairo, but there remained a huge potential roadblock: King
Hussein. With his reputation for irascibility, along with his jealous
efforts to control the rebel movement, it seemed highly likely the
Hejazi king would reject the suggestion out of hand. Then again, he
might just listen to Faisal’s most trusted British advisor and the “hero
of Aqaba.” In short order, Lawrence found himself aboard the Dufferin
bound for a meeting with Hussein.</p>
<p>But the mission to Jeddah was only the most visible sign of the young
captain’s new and profound influence over British policy in the region.
Behind the scenes, Lawrence had already laid the groundwork for a
dramatic restructuring of the British military presence in Arabia, one
tailored to his specifications. As he rather immodestly explained in
Seven Pillars, he had put the argument to Gilbert Clayton thus: “Aqaba
had been taken on my plan by my effort. There was much more I felt
inclined to do—and capable of doing—if he thought I had earned the right
to be my own master.”</p>
<p>During their week together in Cairo, Clayton had agreed to most of
his subordinate’s suggestions. With the war in the Hejaz essentially
over—though the Turks still controlled Medina, they had now lost all
offensive capability—the long and futile campaign to block the Hejaz
Railway at El Ula could be brought to a merciful end. For the same
reason, the main rebel base at Wejh was now to be virtually shuttered,
with both its Arab forces and British logistics officers brought up to
Aqaba. Assuming the role of de facto general, Lawrence plotted out the
future deployments of those Arab armies to remain in the Hejaz, and
worked up a list of the British army personnel to be retained,
reassigned, or let go. Clayton had drawn the line, however, on
Lawrence’s bold proposal that he be given overall command at Aqaba,
pointing out that having a junior officer order about his superiors just
wasn’t the British way. Instead, they jointly settled on one of Cyril
Wilson’s deputies, Major Pierce Joyce, for the Aqaba post, an easygoing
and unambitious officer unlikely to get in Lawrence’s way.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, more exemplified Lawrence’s changed status than his
reunion with Colonel Wilson in Jeddah. After Lawrence’s first visit to
Arabia eight months earlier, Wilson had angrily commented to Clayton
that the arrogant junior officer “wants kicking, and kicking hard,” and
had tried to prevent his return to Arabia on even a temporary basis. By
July 1917, however, the colonel had come to see Lawrence, now in the
process of being promoted to major, as both an ally and probably the
most important British field officer operating in the Hejaz.</p>
<p>Just prior to Lawrence’s arrival in Jeddah, Wilson had received a
memorandum from Clayton outlining the sweeping personnel changes being
contemplated for the region, pointedly noting that he had come to these
ideas in consultation with Captain Lawrence. This detail made one
feature of the memorandum all the more striking: pushed aside was
Stewart Newcombe, still the officially designated head of the British
military mission to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>Far more than to anyone else, it was to Stewart Newcombe that
Lawrence owed his position in the Middle East. But in Lawrence’s
cold-eyed view, war was war, and whatever sense of gratitude he felt for
his mentor couldn’t stand in the way of its conduct. Newcombe had
endured a contentious tenure in the Hejaz, never quite adjusting to the
Arabs’ mysterious approach to war-making, and in myriad reports had
complained bitterly of their lack of discipline and reliability. As
Lawrence explained to Cyril Wilson upon his arrival in Jeddah, it had
been decided that Newcombe would now be taken off the front and
relegated to a rearguard role, effectively demoted. A surprised Wilson
quickly acquiesced.</p>
<p>That same evening, Lawrence and Wilson met with King Hussein. It was
Lawrence’s first audience with the king, and he found him both charming
and personable. That assessment may have been helped by Hussein’s quick
acceptance of the proposal to place Faisal and his army under Allenby’s
direct command.</p>
<p>A very different matter arose the following morning when Hussein
summoned Lawrence to his Jeddah palace for a private meeting. With
uncharacteristic bluntness, the king brought the conversation to a topic
that had become something of a personal obsession: his meetings back in
May with Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>While the controversy over what had or had not been agreed to at
those meetings continued to find small echo in certain branches of the
British government, its import had been diminished by the pace and
urgency of other events. Surely adding to its waning effect was the
polite tone adopted by dissident eyewitnesses like Cyril Wilson, with
his couched language alluding to “possible misunderstandings.” It was
not at all the tone Lawrence would adopt, and what had taken Wilson many
discursive pages to relate, he did in less than one: “The main points,”
he cabled Clayton after his second meeting with Hussein, “are that he
had altogether refused to permit any French annexation of Beirut and the
Lebanon.… He is extremely pleased to have trapped M. Picot into the
admission that France will be satisfied in Syria with the [same]
position Great Britain desires in Iraq.… In conclusion the Sherif
remarked on the shortness and informality of conversations, the absence
of written documents and the fact that the only change in the situation
caused by the meeting was the French renunciation of the ideas of
annexation, permanent occupation, or suzerainty of any part of
Syria.”</p>
<p>Whether due to its brevity or the new celebrity of its author, within
days that report was finding its way onto the desks of the seniormost
officials of the British government. It had the effect of instantly
resurrecting the debate over Britain’s web of conflicting promises in
the Middle East—as well as Mark Sykes’s singular role in spinning that
web.</p>
<p>But Lawrence’s mission to Arabia was not quite done. While he was
still in Jeddah, word came from Cairo that according to a reliable
informant, Lawrence’s chief partner in the Aqaba campaign, Auda Abu
Tayi, was now secretly negotiating with the Turks to switch sides.
Lawrence’s immediate reaction was defensive—he suggested that perhaps it
was actually a ruse on Auda’s part to lull the Turks into inaction—but
he evidently had less confidence in that theory than he let on. Within
hours, he was on board a ship bound for Aqaba and a face-to-face
confrontation with Auda.</p>
<p>Trekking inland on a fast camel, Lawrence found the Howeitat
chieftain along with his two chief lieutenants, both also named by the
informant as prospective traitors, in a tent outside the village of
Guweira. For many hours they passed as reunited friends, until Lawrence
invited Auda and one of the other conspirators to join him for a walk.
Once they were alone, he challenged the two men with what he had been
told. “They were anxious to know how I had learnt of their secret
dealings,” Lawrence recounted, “and how much more I knew. We were on a
slippery ledge.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a ledge that conceivably could have been fatal for Lawrence.
Instead, drawing on his extraordinary skill in knowing how to converse
with Arabs in even these minefield circumstances, he put on an elaborate
performance—sympathy, flattery, and ridicule all fused into one—to first
disarm and then win the men back to the rebel side. Once returned to
Aqaba, Lawrence cabled Cairo that the business with Auda amounted to
little more than a misunderstanding, that all was now “absolutely
satisfactory.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence later admitted, he frequently shaved the facts in what he
passed on to Cairo about the Arab Revolt and its leaders, but suggested
it was really to everyone’s benefit. “Since [British] Egypt kept us
alive by stinting herself, we must reduce impolitic truth to keep her
confident and ourselves a legend. The crowd wanted book-heroes.”</p>
<p>And like any good performer, Lawrence gave the crowd what they
wanted.</p>
<p>ONCE THE MATTER of his Welsh ancestry got sorted out, William Yale
and the British ambassador to the United States settled down to
business.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Yale had rather low expectations of what Cecil
Spring-Rice might be able to provide him by way of job prospects. After
all, the British already had an extensive intelligence apparatus devoted
to the Middle East. But William Yale was canny enough to realize he had
something to offer that very few others did: an oil connection. Over the
previous four years, he had canvassed vast stretches of Palestine
looking for potential oil deposits for Standard Oil of New York. Through
office memoranda, he also knew where else across the Ottoman Empire his
company had sought or obtained concessions. In the postwar world, who
was to know if the occupying power in these regions would recognize the
Socony concessions? Certainly if that occupying power had already
publicly stated that future oil exploration and extraction was to be
regarded as a matter of national security—a power like Great Britain,
for instance—it seemed entirely possible it might toss out Socony’s
claims in favor of development by one of its own national syndicates. If
so, having someone on board who had seen the preexisting maps and
geological surveys could save a lot of time and trouble.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, Ambassador Spring-Rice was sufficiently
intrigued by his young visitor to ask that Yale drop off at the embassy
a copy of his report on conditions in Syria. This Yale did the very next
day, along with a two-page addendum noting the location of all principal
German military installations in Jerusalem, with those locations further
pinpointed on a map.</p>
<p>If Yale’s Syria report had failed to interest American officials, the
British reaction was quite different. The ambassador thought enough of
it to rush a copy directly to Foreign Secretary Balfour, which drew an
equally swift response from London; provided William Yale could obtain a
draft waiver from the U.S. War Department, the secret cable instructed,
Spring-Rice was to offer the twenty-nine-year-old oilman a lieutenant’s
commission in the British army, “with view to subsequent employment as
intelligence officer to Egypt. His information is sure to be of value.
Please take necessary action and wire result.”</p>
<p>The required War Department waiver should have been little more than
a formality now that the United States and Great Britain were wartime
allies. But it was not, it turned out, such a formality in William
Yale’s case. That’s because after languishing apparently unread at the
State Department for over a month, his Syria report had finally landed
on the desk of someone intrigued by its contents. That person was a man
named Leland Harrison, the special assistant to the secretary of state,
but that title didn’t begin to convey the actual power he wielded.</p>
<p>The thirty-four-year-old Harrison enjoyed a similar Yankee blueblood
background to Yale’s. After being educated at Eton and Harvard, he’d
joined the U.S. diplomatic corps and held a succession of posts at some
of the most important American overseas missions. His swift rise had
been cemented when Secretary of State Robert Lansing brought him to
Washington in 1915, where Harrison quickly gained a reputation as
Lansing’s most trusted lieutenant.</p>
<p>Both fierce Anglophiles, Lansing and Harrison had shared a deepening
disenchantment with Woodrow Wilson’s commitment to American neutrality
in the war. Another source of Lansing’s favor for Harrison was
undoubtedly his subordinate’s profound sense of discretion. One State
Department staffer would say of Leland Harrison that “he was positively
the most mysterious and secret man I have ever known.… He was almost a
human sphinx, and when he did talk, his voice was so low that I had to
strain my ears to catch the words.”</p>
<p>Where this became significant was that prior to American entry in the
war, Lansing had acted as the leader of a virtual shadow government
within the Wilson administration, a secretive cabal that quietly
maneuvered for intervention on the side of the Entente. Just how
secretive was indicated by Lansing’s creation of something called the
Bureau of Secret Intelligence in 1916. In hopes of uncovering evidence
of German treachery that would make the argument for intervention
irresistible, the bureau’s special agents spied on diplomats and
businessmen from the Central Powers residing in the United States, an
activity that obviously undercut Wilson’s public vow of impartiality and
would have infuriated other branches of government had they been told.
But they weren’t told. Instead, Lansing had used State Department
discretionary funds to create the bureau, enabling it to operate without
the approval or even the knowledge of Congress or most of the rest of
Wilson’s cabinet. Pulling Leland Harrison from the Latin American
division, Lansing had placed his young protégé in charge of this
“extra-legal” new office, tasked to overseeing “the collection and
examination of all information of a secret nature.”</p>
<p>While this element of conspiracy within the State Department had been
somewhat mooted by American entry into the war, it provided Harrison
with a precedent when, upon reading William Yale’s Syria report, it
occurred to him that it might be very useful for the United States to
have its own source of intelligence in the Middle East. The snag was
that such an enterprise fell out of the purview of the existing domestic
intelligence agencies and, with the United States not at war with
Turkey, beyond the scope of the army intelligence division as well. The
solution was to bring Yale in under the umbrella of the Bureau of Secret
Intelligence; to that end, he was summoned to the State Department in
early August.</p>
<p>At that meeting, Harrison put forward a remarkable proposition: Yale
would return to the Middle East as a “special agent” for the State
Department. At a salary of ,000 a year plus expenses, his mission would
be to monitor and report on whatever was happening that might be of
interest to the American government—or, perhaps more accurately, of
interest to Leland Harrison. From his base in Cairo, Yale would send
weekly dispatches through the American embassy’s diplomatic pouch to
Washington, where they would be routed exclusively to Harrison’s
attention. Unsurprisingly, Yale quickly accepted the offer. On August
14, and under Secretary Lansing’s signature, he was named the State
Department’s special agent for the Middle East.</p>
<p>After a brief trip home to see his family in Alder Creek, on August
29 Yale boarded USS New York in New York harbor for another
transatlantic crossing. En route to Cairo, he was to stop off in London
and Paris to take a sounding of those British and French officials most
directly involved with Middle Eastern affairs. As Harrison cabled to the
American ambassador in London, “[Yale] is to keep us informed of the
Near Eastern situation and, should the occasion arise, may be sent on
trips for special investigation work. He is favorably known to the
British authorities, who offered him a commission. Please do what you
can to put him in touch with the right authorities.”</p>
<p>In the second decade of the twenty-first century, it is difficult to
fully grasp the utter provincialism of the United States as it entered
World War I in 1917. Not only was its standing army one-twentieth the
size of Germany’s, but it was dwarfed in size by even some of Europe’s
smallest actors, including Romania, Bulgaria, and Portugal. In 1917, the
entire Washington headquarters staff of the State Department fit into
one wing of a six-story building adjacent to the White House, a
structure it shared with the command staff of both the Departments of
Navy and Army.</p>
<p>Those examples notwithstanding, perhaps more remarkable is this: for
most of the remainder of the war, the American intelligence mission in
the Middle East—a mission that would include the analysis of battlefield
strategies and regional political currents, the interviewing of future
heads of state, and the gathering of secrets against governments both
friendly and hostile—would be conducted by a single twenty-nine-year-old
man with no military, diplomatic, or intelligence training. To these
deficiencies, William Yale could actually think of a few more: “I lacked
a historical knowledge of the background of the problems I was studying.
I had no philosophy of history, no method of interpretation, and very
little understanding of the fundamental nature and function of the
[regional] economic and social system.”</p>
<p>Not that any of this caused him undue anxiety. An exemplar of the
American can-do spirit, William Yale also held to the belief, quite
common among his countrymen, that ignorance and lack of experience could
actually bestow an advantage, might serve as the wellspring for
“originality and boldness.” If so, he promised to be a formidable force
in the Middle East.</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN AND T. E. Lawrence had first crossed paths on
February 1, 1917. That encounter made little impression on either man,
save a quick note in Aaronsohn’s diary that he’d found Captain “Laurens”
knowledgeable but conceited. Their next meeting, on August 12 of that
year, was one both would remember for a long time. In the interim, each
had become a personality to reckon with in Cairo, Lawrence for his
exploits in Arabia, Aaronsohn for his contribution to the British war
effort through his NILI spy ring. Of course, both had also gained
reputations for being outspoken in their views on the future of the
Middle East. Their talk at the Arab Bureau offices quickly degenerated
into mutual hostility.</p>
<p>Lawrence may have been alerted to the tone their conversation would
take by an incendiary paper Aaronsohn had penned a few weeks earlier. By
August 1917, with the specter of official British support for a Jewish
homeland in Palestine inching closer to reality, even the more radical
leaders of international Zionism had adopted the soothing language of
conciliation: whatever the future political framework in Palestine, they
stressed, the Jews would live in peaceful coexistence with their Arab
and Christian neighbors, the fight against Turkish oppression a cause
they all shared.</p>
<p>No such placating words were forthcoming from Aaron Aaronsohn. In his
position paper, soon to be excerpted in the Arab Bulletin, the
agronomist inveighed against the “squalid, superstitious, ignorant”
Palestinian serfs known as the fellaheen, freely acknowledged that at
times they had been forcibly removed from the land by Jewish
settlers—and would be again if he had his way. As to the accusation that
Jews kept themselves apart from their Arab neighbors, Aaronsohn not only
confirmed the charge, but wrote, “We are glad of it. From national,
cultural, educational, technical and mere hygienic points of view, this
policy has had to be strictly adhered to; otherwise the whole Jewish
Renaissance movement would fail.” As a cautionary tale, he pointed to
the alleged educational shortcomings in the assimilationist Jewish
settlement of Rosh Pinah, which he attributed to the “unavoidably
degrading effect that continued contact with the uneducated fellaheen
had on the Jewish youth.”</p>
<p>Surely most upsetting to the mainstream Zionist leaders and their
British supporters, however, were his comments on the Arab Revolt. In
paving the way for official support for a Jewish homeland, and in
anticipation of Arab resistance to the idea, British officials from Mark
Sykes on down had been energetically coaxing the Zionists to voice their
solidarity with the Arab cause. Chaim Weizmann had led this chorus from
London, but in Cairo, no one had given Aaronsohn the playsheet.</p>
<p>“[The Palestinian Jews] have no interest, and still less confidence,
in the Arab Revolt,” he wrote. “They are not in a position to take up
arms against the Turk, and they would hesitate to join the Arabs, even
if they were in a position to do it. So far as we know the Arabs, the
man among them who will withstand a bribe is still to be born.… In order
to help to defeat the Turk, [the Jews] will readily join the British
forces, but it is doubtful whether they will ever trust the Arabs.”</p>
<p>Hardly words to delight T. E. Lawrence, the self-appointed defender
of that revolt in the West, but at their meeting, Aaronsohn seemed
almost to go out of his way to provoke Lawrence further. The ultimate
future of Palestine, he explained, was not a British protectorate in
which a Jewish minority would be protected, but a de facto Jewish
nation. This would be achieved both politically and economically, with
Zionists simply buying up all the land between Gaza and Haifa and
forcing the fellaheen from the land. Lawrence’s response was equally
blunt. The Jews in Palestine had two choices, he told the agronomist:
either coexist with the Arab majority or see their throats cut.</p>
<p>“It was an interview without any evidence of friendliness,” Aaronsohn
noted in his diary with considerable understatement. “Lawrence had too
much success at too early an age. He has a very high estimation of
himself. He is lecturing me on our colonies, on the spirit of the
people, on the feelings of the Arabs, and we would do well in being
assimilated by them, etc. While listening to him I could almost imagine
that I was attending the lecture of a Prussian scientific anti-Semite
expressing himself in English.… He is openly against us. He must be of
missionary stock.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence was only the latest addition to the roster of people
irritating Aaron Aaronsohn just then. Despite the peacemaking efforts of
various British officers, a three-month-old feud with the anti-Zionist
Jewish Committee in Alexandria raged unabated, and the agronomist was
still being virtually ignored by Chaim Weizmann’s Zionist Federation in
London. So infuriated was Aaronsohn at the lack of respect being shown
him from London that just days after his encounter with Lawrence, he
wrote two long letters to Weizmann complaining of his treatment and,
once again, threatening to disband NILI. When he repeated this threat to
Reginald Wingate, it sparked another worried cable to the Foreign
Office.</p>
<p>“It might help matters if Mr. Aaronsohn were to receive without delay
the support for which he has asked,” Wingate wrote Secretary Balfour on
August 20. “An additional reason for not alienating him, and one which
may perhaps appeal to you, is that the military authorities attach
importance to retaining the use of the organization which he has created
in Palestine. He is in a position to destroy this organization, and
there is little doubt that, in his present frame of mind, he will be
tempted to do so unless some concession is made to his views. How far
his difference with the Zionists in England is due to questions of
principle and how far to wounded susceptibilities I am unable to
tell.”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, while riding his bicycle through the streets of
Cairo one evening, Aaronsohn came up with a new idea: if the British
Zionists wouldn’t clarify matters with him, then he would go to Britain
and force them to. When he put this plan to his British handlers, they
readily concurred, no doubt relieved at the prospect of placing some
distance between the NILI network and its potentially destructive
creator. On September 13, Aaronsohn left Egypt bound for Marseilles.</p>
<p>But consumed by his myriad squabbles, as well as his need for
recognition, it seems to have only fitfully occurred to the scientist
that he was engaging in extremely risky behavior for someone who headed
a clandestine spy ring. He also appeared to have quite forgotten the
cover story designed to keep his family and coconspirators in Palestine
safe, that as far as Ottoman authorities knew, he’d been lifted off a
boat en route to the United States and was presumably cooling his heels
in a British internment camp. Instead, Aaronsohn’s name had now appeared
in an array of official reports circulating between Cairo, London, and
Paris. Worse, through both his dealings with British officials in Cairo
and his continuing spat with the Jewish Committee in Alexandria, an
ever-growing circle of people in Egypt were aware of NILI’s existence.
Even if none of these would deliberately harm the spy ring, how much
longer before word of it finally reached Berlin or Constantinople?</p>
<p>Certainly, Aaron Aaronsohn’s own family hadn’t helped matters. During
his New York exile, his younger brother Alex had written of his escape
from Turkey in an article for the Atlantic Monthly magazine; by August
1917, that article had been converted into a book, With the Turks in
Palestine, which was now available in Cairo bookstores. Among Jewish
settlements in Palestine, it was now an open secret that some sort of
intelligence network was operating out of Athlit—and Sarah Aaronsohn’s
very conspicuous travels in the region gave many a good idea of exactly
who was involved. Indeed, in July a delegation of Palestinian Jewish
leaders had called on Sarah to demand she immediately stop her
“activities,” an ultimatum she had angrily spurned.</p>
<p>But if only because they were supposed to be professionals at such
things, by far the greatest blame for the situation attached to those
British officials tasked to manage the spy ring. Their cavalier manner
bordered on the criminal. It was they who had come up with the idea of
using the NILI network to distribute both British propaganda materials
and relief funds for Jewish refugees, and while Aaronsohn had ultimately
vetoed the first proposal, he had relented on the latter. As a result,
when the first installment of aid went ashore at Athlit in mid-July in
the form of gold sovereign coins, NILI operatives were no longer just
exporters of intelligence but now importers of contraband gold, doubling
their risk of detection. Most astounding of all, the British had
repeatedly violated the most basic rule of running spies, which is to
make sure one cell has no contact with another. By August 1917, the
once-small fleet of spy ships operating out of Port Said had been
steadily whittled down to the point where a single vessel, the Managem,
was now conducting all missions. Out of necessity, this meant the
Managem was transporting operatives of Britain’s different intelligence
networks in Palestine on the same voyages, neatly ensuring that if one
spy was caught or defected, he or she was in a position to unmask
everyone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it all spoke to the same personality flaw that had
plagued the British in their war against the Turks from the outset, one
shared in this instance by the Aaronsohns: hubris, contempt for one’s
enemy. And just as had occurred so many times since 1914, they would all
soon have reason to regret it. On September 13, the same day Aaronsohn
set sail for Europe, Turkish authorities in Palestine caught their first
NILI spy.</p>
<p>IT WAS THE SORT of store-clerk work Lawrence enjoyed the least. By
late August, the process of converting Aqaba from a sleepy fishing port
into the forward staging ground for the Arab Revolt was well under way,
with a daily stream of British ships disgorging mountains of supplies.
Those ships also brought in thousands of fighters—Muslim recruits from
Egypt, Arab warriors from Faisal’s old base at Wejh—where they were
joined by a surge of new tribal recruits coming in from the surrounding
mountains. Since his return from Cairo on August 17, Lawrence’s days in
Aqaba had been spent dealing with the inevitable logistical foul-ups,
and in trying to help bring some degree of order to the place. But
perhaps such mundane duties helped distract from the larger problems at
hand, for already the heady optimism and accelerated plans sparked by
Aqaba’s capture six weeks earlier had become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>As might have been foreseen, General Allenby’s ambitious goal of
launching his Palestine offensive by mid-September had been pushed back
due to a host of delays in getting his army fully reequipped; planners
in Cairo were now talking of a launch date no earlier than late October.
Which maybe was just as well from Lawrence’s perspective, since the
Arabs were woefully unprepared too.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lawrence was living the old proverb of success
having a thousand fathers. Exacerbated by its proximity to Cairo, Aqaba
was now plagued by that most noxious of bureaucratic envoys, the
advisor, each determined to prove his worth by coming up with his own
list of dubious recommendations. In late August, a newly arrived
intelligence officer, taken aback by the lack of professionalism among
the Arab troops, urged on Cairo the immediate dispatch of the Imperial
Camel Corps, an elite British camel cavalry force. Lawrence was forced
to take time from his other duties to undermine the plan. “One squabble
between a [Camel Corps] trooper and an Arab,” he wrote Clayton on August
27, “or an incident with Bedouin women, would bring on general
hostilities.” Politic enough to concede some of the intelligence
officer’s other points, he closed on a dismissive note. “I don’t think
that any [report] of the Arab situation will be of much use to you
unless its author can see for himself the difference between a national
rising and a [military] campaign.”</p>
<p>Coincidentally, when Clayton received that note, he was already
considering doing a little field research of his own. On September 1, he
arrived in Aqaba from Cairo, marking his first visit to the war front
that had consumed his energies for over a year.</p>
<p>As always, it seemed the general had something of a hidden agenda to
his visit. Over a month earlier, he’d received a curious letter from
Mark Sykes in London. Clayton had seen no reason to share its contents
with Lawrence during his subordinate’s recent stay in Cairo—the two had
been in daily contact at the Arab Bureau throughout the second week of
August—but for reasons known only to him, he had brought the letter to
Aqaba for that purpose.</p>
<p>When Sykes had returned to London from his Middle East sojourn that
summer, it had been to a radically altered political landscape. As
Entente leaders were learning to their shock and dismay, President
Woodrow Wilson’s talk about making “the world safe for democracy” had
been more than just sanctimonious rhetoric; the price for American
intervention in the war was to be self-determination for oppressed
peoples, and the annulment of the maze of secret pacts between
governments—in effect, the beginning of the end of the imperial era. It
was a measure of just how desperate Great Britain and France had
become—between them, they had suffered some five million casualties in
three years of war—that formerly voraciously acquisitive politicians in
both capitals were now scrambling to learn the strange vocabulary of
“non-annexation” and “autonomy.”</p>
<p>Few were more adroit at executing this about-face than Mark Sykes.
With astonishing speed, the politician had refashioned himself an
enlightened postimperial statesman, a champion of self-determination.
The best course in the Middle East, Sykes now argued, was for both
Britain and France to renounce any imperialist claims whatsoever, since
it was clear, as he informed Gilbert Clayton in his letter of July 22,
that “colonialism is madness.” In its place, what he envisioned was a
kind of political finishing school administered by the Western powers, a
period in which the benighted races of the Middle East might be
instructed in Western values and systems and then sent on their merry
way. Lest anyone find all this jarring coming from the coauthor of the
most infamous imperial pact in modern history, Sykes had a handy
solution; as he advised the War Cabinet in mid-July, henceforth all
references to the Sykes-Picot Agreement should be discarded in favor of
“the Anglo-French-Arab Agreement.”</p>
<p>Not everyone was impressed by Sykes’s new incarnation. Over time, a
growing consensus in the Foreign Office leadership held that Britain had
cut a very bad deal in Sykes-Picot, and blame had naturally affixed to
its poorly supervised coauthor; as War Cabinet member George Curzon
commented, “[Sykes] appears to think that the way to get rid of
suspicion is always to recognize what the other party claims and to give
up, when asked, our claims.” Confidence in Sykes was further eroded by
the continuing controversy over his and Picot’s purported accord with
King Hussein in May, and by his leadership role in promulgating the
sacking-of-Jaffa story, now viewed by many as a backdoor scheme to prod
the government into fully supporting the Zionist camp. Matters came to a
head in early July when Arthur Nicolson, the under secretary of state
for foreign affairs, had sought to unravel for the War Cabinet precisely
what other commitments the government had made in the Middle East over
the previous two years, and how those might square with its promises to
King Hussein. All but calling Sykes a liar—“it is a little difficult to
be sure that the papers in the Department represent the whole of what
actually passed”—Nicolson urged that “the opinion of Sir Mark Sykes
should be invited before the matter is pursued further, as he alone will
be able to state with authority how far any evasion or modification of
our engagements to [Hussein] are likely to be resented by Arab
opinion.”</p>
<p>In the face of such criticism, Sykes assumed a petulant, defensive
crouch. Curiously, he also focused on a particular junior British army
officer as a source of his troubles: Captain T. E. Lawrence. In a
self-pitying note to Secretary Balfour’s secretary on July 20, Sykes
presented his two years of toil on Middle Eastern affairs as an exercise
in thankless self-sacrifice. “Hitherto the work has been fairly
successful, but I have had to contend, as you know, with many
difficulties: the prejudices of the past both British and French, the
mutual suspicions and susceptibilities of out-of-date minds, the
anti-British policy of Brémond, the anti-French attitude of
Lawrence.”</p>
<p>But perhaps this focus wasn’t so curious after all. Only a handful of
people grasped the full tapestry of contradictions and half-truths Sykes
had woven in the Middle East, but most of these—men like Gilbert Clayton
and Reginald Wingate—were too much servants of the system to ever fully
confront him; if things did blow up, they would keep their grumbling to
a minimum and look for ways to muddle through. But then there was
Lawrence, the non–club member who wouldn’t hesitate in shaming Sykes if
given the platform—and in the wake of his triumph at Aqaba, he
increasingly had that platform.</p>
<p>In addition, Lawrence now had the ability to seriously damage the
diplomatic framework Sykes had spent two years building. Imperfect
though it was, it protected British interests in the region while giving
a little bit of something to most everyone else. Now, with Lawrence’s de
facto military alliance with Allenby joined to his long-standing
determination to wrest Syria from France, and quite suddenly the little
captain was elevated from nuisance to formidable threat. It was
apparently in hopes of neutralizing that threat, through both flattery
and thinly veiled condescension, that Sykes devoted a portion of his
July 22 letter to Clayton. It was that same letter Clayton brought with
him to Aqaba to show Lawrence.</p>
<p>“Lawrence’s move is splendid and I want him knighted,” Sykes had
written in reference to Aqaba’s capture. “Tell him [that] now that he is
a great man he must behave as such and be broad in his views. Ten years’
tutelage under the Entente and the Arabs will be a nation. Complete
independence [now] means Persia, poverty and chaos. Let him consider
this, as he hopes for the people he is fighting for.”</p>
<p>Combined with all he knew of Sykes’s past machinations, and coming so
close on the heels of his confrontation with Aaronsohn in Cairo,
Lawrence could not stomach the letter’s patronizing tone. Perhaps also
it touched a chord of ego; if not a “great man,” Lawrence was now most
certainly his own, and he wasn’t about to be dictated to by Mark Sykes.
In a scathing seven-page letter to the politician, couched as an earnest
request for guidance, he methodically held up each of Sykes’s schemes to
scrutiny before exposing their gaping holes: “What have you promised the
Zionists, and what is their programme? I saw Aaronsohn in Cairo, and he
said at once the Jews intended to acquire the land-rights of all
Palestine from Gaza to Haifa, and have practical autonomy within. Is
this acquisition to be by fair purchase or by forced sale and
expropriation? … Do the Jews propose the complete expulsion of the Arab
peasantry, or their reduction to a day-labourer class?”</p>
<p>He then turned to the matter of French “help” to the Arabs in
developing Syria, the canard that Sykes had tried to foist on Hussein at
Jeddah. “The Arabs can put their revolt through without French help, and
therefore are disinclined to pay a price only to be made known to them
in the future.… The Sherif will succeed, given time and a continuance of
our help, [and] he will take by his own efforts (don’t assume virtue for
the mules and cartridges we supply him; the hands and heads are his) the
sphere we allotted to our foreign-advised ‘independent Syria,’ and will
expect to keep it without imposed foreign advisors. As he takes this
sphere of his, he will also take parts of the other spheres not properly
allotted to an Arab state [under Sykes-Picot]. His title to them will be
a fairly strong one—that of conquest by means of the local
inhabitants—and what are the two Powers going to do about it?”</p>
<p>At the letter’s close, Lawrence assumed a slightly more conciliatory
tone, recognizing the realpolitik reality that “we may have to sell our
small friends in pay for our big friends,” but pointed out that,
contrary to Sykes’s perpetually sunny pronouncements, “we are in rather
a hole. Please tell me what, in your opinion, are the actual measures by
which we will find a way out?”</p>
<p>The letter was perhaps the most searing indictment ever penned of
Sykes’s actions in the Middle East, but it was one the politician would
never see. On September 7, with Clayton having returned to Cairo from
his Aqaba visit, Lawrence routed the letter through his office for
onward transmission to London; upon reading its contents, however,
Clayton thought better of it. As he explained in a note to Lawrence, he
didn’t wish to provide Sykes with anything that “may raise him to
activity,” especially now that the increasingly discredited Sykes-Picot
Agreement seemed headed for oblivion. “It is in fact dead,” Clayton
wrote, “and if we wait quietly, this fact will soon be realized. It was
never a very workable instrument and it is now almost a lifeless
monument.”</p>
<p>In this appraisal, Gilbert Clayton couldn’t have been more wrong, but
Lawrence wasn’t in a position to argue the point. In what was becoming
something of a pattern between them, by the time Clayton sent his note,
Lawrence had already set off for the interior and a new strike against
the Turks.</p>
<p>WILLIAM YALE FIRST sensed something amiss when, checking into
London’s Savoy Hotel on September 7, he noticed the abundance of
“painted ladies” circulating through its lobby. As he sadly noted in his
diary the following day, it appeared the once-grand old hotel had become
“to all intents and purposes a house of assignation.”</p>
<p>The puritanical Yale had little time to dwell on the squalidness of
his surroundings, however, for he was to stay very busy in London.
Through Leland Harrison’s helpful cable to the American ambassador, the
new special agent gained quick entrée to many of the top British
officials involved in Middle Eastern affairs. Amid these meetings, Yale
was flattered to discover that his Syria report had been hailed as one
of the most incisive documents to emerge from that vital corner of enemy
territory, circulated and studied at some of the highest levels of the
British political and military leadership; he was happy to meet with
debriefers from various intelligence units, and to provide them with
whatever further details he could.</p>
<p>Rather soon, though, Yale’s attention turned away from trying to gain
a broad view of the Middle Eastern situation—from his own experience in
the region, he knew that any truly useful insights were likely to be
found in Cairo—and toward a particular aspect of it: the British
government’s growing flirtation with the Jewish Zionist community.</p>
<p>His curiosity was piqued by a peculiar story circulating in British
newspapers that told of an unnamed Jewish chemist who had supposedly
given the government “certain secrets” pertaining to the manufacture of
explosives. “This Jewish chemist,” Yale wrote in his diary on September
12, “who, when asked what reward he desired, replied that personally he
wished nothing, but that he was a Jew and that he wished that in a Peace
Conference the Allies would give special consideration to the question
of the Jews in Palestine.” According to the newspaper accounts, the
British government had secretly promised the scientist to do so.</p>
<p>Even if Yale didn’t yet have the name of the chemist—it was Chaim
Weizmann, of course—what he found intriguing was that the government had
made no public attempt to deny or diminish the account, which strongly
suggested it was true. Over his next week in London, the new American
intelligence operative sounded out an array of officials on just what
British policy might be in regard to the Jews in Palestine, only to
receive an array of conflicting responses.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for this, Yale concluded, was that there seemed
little agreement among British Jews over just what arrangement they
hoped for. Some of those in the Zionist community argued for nothing
less than a Jewish nation in Palestine, others merely for a guarantee of
increased immigration, while some anti-Zionist leaders fiercely
denounced the movement as a dangerous new tool for Jewish
marginalization, a handy weapon for anti-Semites to question the loyalty
of Jews to the nations of their birth. In trying to sort through the
controversy, it seemed plain to Yale that the British government was
contemplating some sort of overture in connection with the Jews and
Palestine, but that precisely what that would be had not yet been
decided.</p>
<p>After two weeks, Yale felt he had gleaned all he could in London, and
was anxious to get on to Cairo. First, though, there was someone he very
much wanted to talk with in Paris, a Zionist leader whose name had come
up often in recent days, and who had just arrived in France from Egypt:
Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>IT IS AN enduring myth about the battle for Arabia: the fantasy of
the “clean war,” of Arab warriors, stirred after centuries of crushing
subjugation, rallying to the cry of freedom; of those same warriors
bravely charging down sand dunes to fall upon their hapless and cruel
oppressors.</p>
<p>Contrary to the charge of his detractors, T. E. Lawrence actually
played a minimal role in creating this myth. Far more it stemmed from
the need of a shattered postwar public to find even a trace of grandeur
in a war so utterly grotesque. There was not a lot of material to work
with from the Western Front, where countless thousands had simply
vanished in puffs, atomized by artillery, or been entombed forever
beneath its mud. By contrast, Arabia was all berobed warriors and
charging camels and flapping banners, a touch of medieval pageantry amid
the inglorious slaughter. That image and the need for it dimmed under
the weight of a second, even more horrific world war, but then David
Lean’s 1962 film resurrected it for a new generation.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s greatest contribution to the literature of war was that,
despite his open advocacy for the Arab cause, fidelity to the truth
compelled him to try to convey what it was really like. As he made clear
in Seven Pillars, while many Arabs joined the fight out of a sincere
desire to be rid of the Turks, sincerity was helped along by British
gold and the prospect of bountiful loot. On the battlefield, the rebels’
enemies were not just Turks but fellow Arabs, warriors from tribes that
had missed out on the British gold or taken that of the Turks, clans
with whom they had blood feuds or who were freelancers out scouting for
loot themselves.</p>
<p>Nor did that battlefield bear much resemblance to the scenery of
popular imagination. Instead of the picturesque expanses of sand dunes
often associated with the region, much of the Arabian and Syrian deserts
consist of dreary gravel plains and barren stone mountains, similar in
many respects to the less picturesque corners of Utah or Arizona. In
traversing this terrain, Lawrence and his Arab allies survived on a diet
of mutton, camel meat, and bread in good times, raw flour in the less
good. These meals were chased down with water often drawn from brackish
springs or algae-covered ponds, or from wells contaminated by the Turks
with rotting animal corpses. Seeking out shade to escape the withering
heat of midday often meant encountering that strange and cruel
phenomenon common to deserts the world over, great swarms of biting
black flies.</p>
<p>But of all the components to the myth, perhaps the most erroneous is
the notion of a “clean war.” On this most severe of landscapes, the
badly wounded on both sides were often left behind to die, the lucky
ones dispatched with a bullet to the head. Subsisting on whatever was
left over once their captors had their fill, prisoners died in droves
from hunger and thirst—when the victors bothered to take prisoners at
all. And in contrast to the clearly delineated death zones of the
Western Front, this was a battlefield on which combatants and civilians
were intermingled, where the completely innocent could suddenly find
themselves caught amid the bullets and knives.</p>
<p>It was early on the afternoon of September 19 when the ten-car train
rounded the bend from the south. Lawrence waited until the train’s
second engine had started over the short bridge, and then he detonated
his fifty-pound gelignite mine. Instantly, a plume of black smoke shot a
hundred feet into the air and billowed out to either side at least as
far. Once the report of the explosion and the screech of ripping metal
died away, there came a brief, eerie silence. Then the killing began in
earnest.</p>
<p>To complement the Arab warriors he intended to recruit along the way,
Lawrence had brought along from Aqaba two fellow Western officers—a
Briton he nicknamed “Stokes” for the Stokes trench mortar he carried, an
Australian nicknamed “Lewis” for the two Lewis machine guns in his
care—and they had pre-positioned themselves and their weapons on a rocky
ledge just three hundred yards from the bridge. As the smoke cleared, it
was revealed that only the train’s engines and lead carriage had fallen
into the culvert below the collapsed bridge, the remaining seven
carriages sitting upright and immobile on the tracks. Rows of Turkish
soldiers sat on the roofs of these carriages, and they were now mowed
down by the Lewis machine guns, “swept off the top like bales of
cotton.”</p>
<p>Starting to recover from their shock, a number of Turks scrambled for
the relative shelter of the culvert under the bridge. The first mortar
that Stokes fired at them went a little wide. After he adjusted the
weapon’s elevating screw, his second shell dropped directly in their
midst. The sudden carnage there, Lawrence noted in his official report,
caused the survivors to panic and race “towards some rough country 200
yards N.E. of the line. On their way there the Lewis gun[s] killed all
but about twenty of them.”</p>
<p>With Turkish resistance rapidly collapsing, the Arab fighters—just
over one hundred men—dashed forward to begin their looting. Anxious to
check on the damage to the engines, Lawrence scrambled down from his
perch to join them.</p>
<p>Reaching the train, he discovered it had been carrying a mixed cargo,
that along with the soldiers, several of its carriages were filled with
civilians. Some of these were the families of Turkish officers returning
to Damascus, others simple refugees. “To one side stood thirty or forty
hysterical women,” Lawrence recounted in Seven Pillars, “unveiled,
tearing their clothes and hair, shrieking themselves distracted. The
Arabs, without regard to them, went on wrecking [their] household goods,
looting their absolute fill.” Spotting Lawrence, the women fell on him
to beg for mercy. They were soon joined by their husbands, who “seized
my feet in a very agony of terror of instant death. A Turk so broken
down was a nasty spectacle; I kicked them off as well as I could with
bare feet, and finally broke free.”</p>
<p>On his way to the train engines, Lawrence checked on the one carriage
that had tumbled into the ravine. He found it had been a medical car,
the wounded and ill laid out on stretchers for the journey, but all were
now bunched in a bloody tangled heap at the bottom of the upended wagon.
“One of those yet alive deliriously cried out the word ‘typhus.’ So I
wedged shut the door and left them there, alone.”</p>
<p>He was only slightly more helpful to a group of Austrian military
advisors who had been on the train, and “who appealed to me quietly in
Turkish for quarter.” Intent on finishing up his demolition work,
Lawrence left them under an Arab guard; moments later, the Austrians
were killed, “all but two or three,” as the result of some dispute.</p>
<p>In his official report on the engagement below Mudowarra, Lawrence
estimated the number of Turkish dead at about seventy, at a cost of one
Arab fighter. He lamented that amid the pandemonium, he’d had to rush
his vandalism to the first train engine, and feared it was still capable
of repair. “The conditions were not helpful to good work.” He made no
mention of dead civilians in the report, although considering the
fusillade of bullets fired into the unarmored train in the first few
minutes of the battle, their number must have been considerable.
Similarly, he offered no explanation for the discrepancy between the
ninety Turkish soldiers taken prisoner and the sixty-eight ultimately
delivered to Aqaba.</p>
<p>For most who experience it, combat triggers a contradictory duel of
emotions: horror at its gruesomeness, exhilaration at its unmitigated
thrill. Reconciling these dueling reactions is probably more difficult
for the soldier than for the civilian given the element of braggadocio
that exists within his fraternity, and he is likely to be more candid
about the complexity of his feelings—to the degree that candor is even
possible—with a nonsoldier.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Aqaba from Mudowarra, Lawrence wrote to a military
colleague, Walter Stirling. In the letter, he recounted the train attack
in gleeful detail, noting the “beautiful shots” of the Stokes gun that
had killed twelve Turks on the spot, and how his own share of the loot
was “a superfine red Baluch prayer-rug.” He continued, “I hope this
sounds the fun it is. The only pity is the sweat to work [the Arabs] up,
and the wild scramble while it lasts. It’s the most amateurish,
Buffalo-Billy sort of performance, and the only people who do it well
are the Bedouin.”</p>
<p>The day before, September 24, a seemingly very different Lawrence had
written to his old friend Edward Leeds at the Ashmolean Museum in
Oxford: “I hope when the nightmare ends that I will wake up and become
alive again. This killing and killing of Turks is horrible. When you
charge in at the finish and find them all over the place in bits, and
still alive many of them, and you know that you have done hundreds in
the same way before, and must do hundreds more if you can.”</p>
<p>If Lawrence was already having difficulty reconciling this psychic
divide, it was about to get worse.</p>
