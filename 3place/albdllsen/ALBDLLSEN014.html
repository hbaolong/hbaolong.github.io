<h4 id="chapter-12-an-audacious-scheme">Chapter 12 An Audacious
Scheme</h4>
<p>So far as all ranks of the troops engaged were concerned, it was a
brilliant victory, and had the early part of the day been normal,
victory would have been secured.</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL CHARLES DOBELL, ON THE BRITISH DEFEAT AT GAZA,
MARCH 28, 1917</p>
<p>With the ramshackle outskirts of Wejh just coming into view in the
predawn light, Lawrence ordered his small camel train to a halt. He
hadn’t bathed since leaving Abdullah’s camp four days earlier, and out
of a sense of propriety he wished to change out of his filthy,
dust-caked robes before presenting himself to Faisal.</p>
<p>It was April 14, 1917. Lawrence had been gone from Wejh for just a
little over a month, but he was returning to a world transformed.
Indeed, the changes that had occurred in that thirty-five-day span, both
on the global and Middle Eastern stages, were of such a magnitude he
probably had difficulty absorbing them all at once.</p>
<p>In mid-March, just days after he had set off for Abdullah’s camp, the
three-hundred-year Romanov dynasty in Russia had come to an abrupt end.
Faced with paralyzing industrial strikes by workers demanding an end to
the war, and a semimutinous army that refused to move against those
workers, Czar Nicholas II had been forced to abdicate. The provisional
government that had replaced the czar vowed to keep Russia in the
Entente, but with the chaos worsening, there was growing doubt in other
European capitals about just how long Petrograd might stand to that
commitment. In fact, though no one yet realized it, the seed of the new
Russian government’s destruction had already been sown through one of
the most successful subversion operations in world history. On April 1,
the German secret police had quietly gathered up a group of leftist
Russian exiles, men just as opposed to the new moderate regime as they
had been to the czar, and arranged their passage home. Among the
returning malcontents was a Marxist named Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, soon
to become better known by his nom de cadre, Lenin.</p>
<p>But as unsettling as developments in Russia were to the British and
French leadership, they proved a boon in another sphere. President
Woodrow Wilson’s loathing of the retrograde czarist regime had played a
key role in his refusal to bring the United States into the war on the
side of the Entente. With the new moderate government in Petrograd,
Russia was suddenly “a fit partner for a League of Honor” in the
American president’s view. In concert with Germany’s renewed U-boat war
in the Atlantic, and the exposure of an outrageous German scheme to lure
Mexico into attacking the United States, it had provided Wilson with the
political cover to finally declare war on Germany at the beginning of
April. Given the staggering logistics involved in building the tiny
American peacetime army into a major fighting force, and then
transporting it across the Atlantic, it would be a long time before the
American “doughboys” might significantly contribute to the Western Front
battlefields—most war planners estimated at least a year—but the news
came as a tremendous relief in France and Great Britain, both sliding
ever closer to financial collapse as the war ground on.</p>
<p>There had also been a momentous event in the Middle East. On March
26, the same day that Lawrence set out to attack the railway garrison at
Aba el Naam, General Archibald Murray had at last thrown his army
against the Turkish trenchworks at Gaza. In a confused and fitful battle
that had continued into the following day, the British had repeatedly
appeared on the verge of a decisive victory, only to find new ways to
fritter away their advantage, finally calling off their assault as
Turkish reinforcements drew near. The result was quite different from
the “great success” that Aaron Aaronsohn had noted in his diary, or the
“brilliant victory” that Murray’s on-the-ground commander reported in
his initial communiqué. Instead, and despite outnumbering the Turkish
garrison by at least three to one, the attacking British had suffered
over four thousand casualties while inflicting less than half that
number on their enemy and leaving them in control of the battlefield.
The outcome amply justified the taunting Turkish leaflet dropped on
British lines in the aftermath: “You beat us at communiqués, but we beat
you at Gaza.” By the time of Lawrence’s return to Wejh on April 14,
General Murray was gearing up his forces in southern Palestine for
another try.</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, though, that day was most memorable for yet
another event: his first encounter with Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Since his first visit to the Hejaz, Lawrence had heard of the
legendary exploits of Auda Abu Tayi, a leader of the fierce Howeitat
tribe of northwestern Arabia. For even longer, Faisal had been waging a
charm offensive to bring the chieftain in on the side of the rebel
cause, sending emissaries with notes and presents and promises,
entertaining a parade of Auda’s tribal lieutenants. Now, with the
capture of Wejh placing the rebels at the outer proximity of Howeitat
territory, Auda had finally come down to the coast to meet Faisal in
person. At some point during Faisal’s and Lawrence’s reunion meeting
that day, Auda was invited to join them.</p>
<p>Whether wholly accurate or not, Lawrence was given to penning very
incisive and closely observed first impressions of people—and few made a
bigger first impression on him than Auda Abu Tayi. “He must be nearly
fifty now (he admits forty),” Lawrence noted in a wartime dispatch, “and
his black beard is tinged with white, but he is still tall and straight,
loosely built, spare and powerful, and as active as a much younger man.
His lined and haggard face is pure Bedouin: broad low forehead, high
sharp hooked nose, brown-green eyes, slanting outward, large mouth.”</p>
<p>Beyond Auda’s arresting physical appearance lay his charisma and
peerless reputation as a desert warrior. “He has married twenty-eight
times, has been wounded thirteen times, and in his battles has seen all
his tribesmen hurt and most of his relations killed. He has only
reported his ‘kill’ since 1900, and they now stand at seventy-five
Arabs; Turks are not counted by Auda when they are dead. Under his
handling, the [Howeitat] have become the finest fighting force in
Western Arabia.… He sees life as a saga and all events in it are
significant and all personages heroic. His mind is packed (and generally
overflows) with stories of old raids and epic poems of fights.”</p>
<p>Although left unsaid, it would seem one reason Lawrence was so taken
with Auda Abu Tayi was the stark contrast he drew to Faisal ibn Hussein.
While Lawrence still had a profound appreciation for Faisal as the
political guide of the Arab Revolt, the man who could gain and keep the
fractious clans and tribes to the banner of the greater cause, it had
become increasingly clear that King Hussein’s third son was not a
natural warrior. To the contrary, and in opposition to the image
Lawrence had first presented to his army superiors, Faisal appeared to
quite abhor violence and to go out of his way to avoid participating in
it personally, “a man who can’t stand the racket,” as Cyril Wilson once
drily observed.</p>
<p>This had been evident most recently amid the intensified campaign
against the Hejaz Railway. To spur the Arab fighters to action, Lawrence
had joined other British officers in urging Faisal to decamp from Wejh
and make for the main rebel staging ground at Wadi Ais. Faisal had
brushed aside these entreaties, alternately pleading a shortage of
camels and the need to remain on the coast to personally meet with the
various tribal delegations coming in to join the revolt, stances that
led some British officers to quietly conclude the man was a bit of a
coward. That assessment was neither fair nor true—certainly it had taken
enormous courage to pull off the tightrope act that Faisal had performed
for so many months between Djemal Pasha and the Arab nationalists in
Damascus—but it was a very different type of courage than the unalloyed
thirst for battle of a man like Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Further diminishing Faisal in Lawrence’s eyes was a propensity for
vacillation. Perhaps it came with being a conciliator and patient
listener, but the emir—Faisal and his brothers had advanced to that
title upon their father declaring himself king in October—had the
disconcerting habit of falling away from seemingly firmly held positions
under the urgings and opinions of whoever next caught his ear; as
Lawrence would later remark, “Faisal always listened to his momentary
adviser, despite his own better judgment.”</p>
<p>As a recent example, back in February Lawrence had divulged to Faisal
precisely why signing on to an Allied-managed attack on Aqaba posed a
potential trap for the Arabs—and had put himself at great risk in doing
so. Thus educated, Faisal had scotched all talk of a precipitous move on
the port. After a brief absence from Wejh in early March, however,
Lawrence had returned to discover Faisal once again fallen under the
sway of his tribal allies, and back to advocating an immediate assault.
It required another round of persuasion on Lawrence’s part to talk
Faisal down.</p>
<p>In fact, it seemed that yet another about-face had spurred Faisal’s
plaintive note to Lawrence in Wadi Ais pleading for his immediate
return. In late March, rumors had reached Wejh that the French were
about to launch an amphibious landing on the Syrian coast—some rumors
held they were already ashore—raising the specter of Syria being stolen
away in a French fait accompli. Faisal’s apprehensions had been further
stoked by a visit from Édouard Brémond on April 1, and a new press by
the colonel to attach French “liaison” officers to the Arab forces in
Wejh. Faisal had again rebuffed Brémond, but his visit had fueled the
Arab leader’s anxiety to make for Syria via Aqaba as soon as possible.
As a result, one of Lawrence’s first tasks upon reaching Wejh on April
14 was to ascertain that the French rumors were untrue, and to calm
Faisal down once more. Along with being tiresome, this suggestibility in
the emir was dangerous; Lawrence might refocus him now, but what would
happen the next time an Aqaba-urging chieftain or the mischievous
Colonel Brémond came calling?</p>
<p>There was an obvious answer, of course: to immediately make for
Aqaba—and with control of that port, for points farther north—by
implementing the daring inland-approach scheme Lawrence had begun to map
out in his mind. Moreover, among the Arab chieftains gathered in Wejh
that day was just the sort of fearless, single-minded fighter who might
bring that scheme to fruition: Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Except a new complication now presented itself, one directly tied to
Faisal’s changeability. Back at the beginning of March, amid Faisal’s
renewed anxiety to move on Aqaba, a British officer in Wejh had thought
to apprise Gilbert Clayton of the news. Clayton had sent a top-secret
directive in reply, one addressed to Lawrence and only two other British
officers in Arabia. That directive hadn’t reached Wejh by the time
Lawrence had left for Abdullah’s camp, but it was among the
correspondence awaiting his return on April 14.</p>
<p>“The move to Aqaba on the part of Faisal,” Clayton had written, “is
not at present desirable.” While claiming his main concern was that
Faisal not be distracted from operations against the Hejaz Railway,
Clayton hinted at the true reason in the letter’s close. “It is
questionable whether, in the present circumstances, the presence of an
Arab force at Aqaba would be desirable, as it would unsettle tribes
which are better left quiet until the time is more ripe.”</p>
<p>Both from his own relationship with Gilbert Clayton, the consummate
strategist, and from what he had gleaned in the corridors of the
intelligence bureau in Cairo, Lawrence quickly grasped the subtext of
the general’s words. He’d been exactly right in his warnings to Faisal
in February—the British wanted Aqaba for themselves—but to accomplish
that, they didn’t wish to merely put the Arabs in a box; they now didn’t
want the Arabs there at all. (In fact, Clayton would soon make this
point explicit in a note to Reginald Wingate: “The occupation of Aqaba
by Arab troops might well result in the Arabs claiming that place
hereafter, and it is by no means improbable that after the war Aqaba may
be of considerable importance to the future defence scheme of Egypt. It
is thus essential that Aqaba should remain in British hands after the
war.”)</p>
<p>On April 14, Lawrence could try to deny the thrust of Clayton’s March
8 directive any way he wished—that with the passage of five weeks, it
was now out of date; that merely stating what was or was not “desirable”
didn’t rise to the level of an explicit order—but he surely understood
the peculiarly oblique nature of British military-speak well enough to
know that going ahead with his Aqaba plan now would be seen as a clear
contravention of his superior’s wishes. Then again, this was a man who
just two months earlier had revealed to Faisal the details of a
diplomatic pact so secret that only a handful of people in the upper
reaches of the British government knew of its existence.</p>
<p>At some point during that remarkable day of April 14—and most likely
when the three of them were alone in Faisal’s tent—Lawrence put his
Aqaba proposal to Faisal and Auda. In Auda’s quick and hearty agreement
to the proposal was confirmation of what Lawrence had sensed in the
chieftain from the outset. “After a moment I knew,” he wrote, “from the
force and directness of the man, that we would attain our end. He had
come down to us like a knight-errant, chafing at our delay in Wejh,
anxious only to be acquiring merit for Arab freedom in his own lands. If
his performance was one-half his desire, we should be prosperous and
fortunate.”</p>
<p>ON APRIL 18, 1917, just four days after Lawrence’s return to Wejh, a
French destroyer slipped from an Italian port and headed southeast into
the Mediterranean. On board were the two midlevel government
functionaries who, a year previously, had secretly carved the future
Middle East into British and French spheres of control and lent their
names to the process: Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot. Their
destination was Alexandria, Egypt, and their mission was to bring
political order to the region’s rapidly changing military situation.</p>
<p>Or at least so the situation had appeared when the idea of their
journey had first been broached several months earlier. Despite a record
of dismal stalemate on virtually every battlefront since the start of
the war, neither the British or French government had broken itself of
the habit of squabbling over the spoils of victory long before victory
had been achieved. In early 1917, with General Archibald Murray gearing
up for his march into Palestine, their wrangling had inevitably turned
to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Intent on defending their imperial claim to Syria, France had
launched a two-pronged initiative. The first had been to scrounge up its
scant military units in the region for the purpose of attaching them to
Murray’s army. When this overture, couched as an act of Entente
solidarity, was initially turned down by the British on the pretext that
operational planning was too far advanced to allow for their
integration, it had triggered furious French charges of betrayal.
British commanders on the ground were forced to relent, but not at all
happily. “Of course it is impossible to decline to have these French
troops,” Murray’s deputy, General Lynden-Bell, confided to a member of
the Arab Bureau in mid-March, “but you can imagine what a terrible
nuisance they will be to us.”</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, Paris had also insisted that a French
political officer accompany Murray’s army as it advanced into Palestine,
a further nuisance, of course, but one that London found just as
difficult to refuse. When in January France had announced that this
political officer was to be Georges-Picot, Britain suddenly found the
need to have a political officer of its own to accompany him—and who
better than Picot’s old negotiating partner, Mark Sykes?</p>
<p>But this new mission put the MP for Hull in a somewhat tricky spot.
During his discussions with Picot over where to draw their lines of
Middle Eastern control, Sykes had never felt the need to inform the
Frenchman—or any other Frenchman, for that matter—as to how those lines
might conflict with commitments already made to King Hussein. Nowhere
was this conflict more glaring than in Syria, a land the British had now
essentially “sold twice,” recognizing its independence in the
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, recognizing its domination by France in
the Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>This was not an immediate problem so long as Picot remained in
France, Hussein’s rebel armies remained in the Hejaz, and the Turks
still ruled Syria, but now, with Archibald Murray’s imminent march into
Palestine and both Sykes and Picot slated to be in his train, those
delicate walls of separation were about to crumble. As he anticipated
his trip to Egypt, Mark Sykes could only have foreseen unpleasantness
ahead.</p>
<p>But then a rather ingenious solution had come to him. What if,
instead of to King Hussein, he brought Georges-Picot before a group of
Syrian exiles with no knowledge of the promises made to the Arabs? In
their ignorance, these Syrians might be grateful to accept whatever
crumbs of limited self-rule the British and French were willing to throw
their way, and that gratitude might in turn lead the French to soften
their imperialist demands. On February 22, Sykes had written to Reginald
Wingate, the British high commissioner to Egypt, asking for his help in
organizing just such a delegation of Syrian exiles in Cairo, men with
whom he and Picot could discuss the future status of their homeland.
Should it be necessary to include a delegate from the Hejaz on the
committee, Sykes suggested it be “a venerable and amenable person who
will not want to ride or take much exercise.” In a remarkable act of
brio, Sykes also thought to enclose with this letter a series of quick
sketches he had worked up toward the design of a new rebel flag.
(Curiously, it may have been in flag design where Mark Sykes’s true
talents lay. King Hussein would eventually adopt one of Sykes’s designs
as his own.)</p>
<p>Startled by Sykes’s cynical request, Wingate sent a cable to the
Foreign Office pointing out that since it was to King Hussein that
Britain had made its commitments, surely it should be Hussein who chose
the delegation to meet with Sykes and Picot. Sykes quickly shot down
that idea, suggesting to Wingate that “it does not appear necessary to
give King Hussein the impression that the future of Syria is to be
considered de novo [anew].” In any event, Sykes hinted, the high
commissioner was making more of all this than need be. “What we really
want are a few men of good standing, representatives of the Arab
National Party, to represent the Syrian Moslem point of view, sign
manifestos and approve any local arrangements that may be made.”</p>
<p>As a result of these building pressures, it must have come as
something of a guilty relief to Mark Sykes when, just as final
preparations were being made for his and Picot’s trip to Egypt, news
came of Murray’s March 26 setback at Gaza. Surely Murray’s next push
would succeed—it was hard to imagine Turkey’s absurd streak of good luck
lasting much longer against British might—but in the meantime, the delay
would give Sykes time to navigate the complex minefield awaiting him in
Cairo.</p>
<p>This minefield was not limited to the Syrian question. Over the past
few months, Mark Sykes had been quietly working on another scheme that,
if all worked out, would neatly outmaneuver his traveling partner,
François Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>Under the original terms of Sykes-Picot, Palestine was to be
separated from the rest of Syria and placed under the “international
administration” of the three principal Entente powers, Britain, France,
and Russia. Within months of coauthoring that arrangement, however,
Sykes had seen the opportunity to go a good deal better. By playing to
the various Palestinian constituencies—and most especially to Jewish
Zionists, with their deep distrust of France and utter hatred for
czarist Russia—it might be possible for Britain to scuttle the joint
administration idea as unworkable, and to place Palestine under a solely
British protectorate. Sykes had been harshly rebuked when he’d floated
this idea past the Foreign Office leadership in the spring of
1916—Secretary Grey had instructed him to “obliterate” the thought from
his memory—but now, a year later, the notion had flowered anew in
Sykes’s fertile mind.</p>
<p>One reason was that Secretary Grey was now a thing of the past,
forced out of office with the rest of the Asquith government in December
1916. With its “Western” focus, the Asquith regime had always been wary
of diplomatic schemes that might inflame relations with the
ever-sensitive French, but that was a lesser concern with the new
“Eastern”-tilting administration of David Lloyd George and his foreign
minister, Arthur Balfour. Anxious for a breakthrough in the war
somewhere—anywhere—they had brought a new emphasis to Eastern
operations, and if success there meant stepping on French toes, it was a
small price to pay.</p>
<p>Sykes had benefited from another important change in the new
government. A chief complaint against the Asquith administration had
been its lack of clear and constant direction in the war, and in
response Lloyd George had created a so-called War Cabinet, a cabal of
just five senior statesmen with sweeping powers to oversee most all
aspects of the British military effort. Surely a sign of the new
administration’s appetite for creative solutions had been the promotion
of Mark Sykes to the position of assistant secretary to the War Cabinet,
placed in charge of Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Just as crucial had been Sykes’s discussions with Aaron Aaronsohn in
October and November. Following those conversations, and reanimated to
the potential of using Zionism as a pro-British vehicle in Palestine,
Sykes had quietly held a series of meetings with British Zionist leaders
through the early winter of 1917. These discussions had culminated in an
extraordinary conference with a group of leading British “Jewish
gentlemen” at a London townhouse on the morning of February 7, 1917;
what made this gathering extraordinary was Sykes’s opening announcement
that he was there without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or
the War Cabinet, and therefore their discussions had to remain secret.
Among the eight men in attendance were Lord Walter Rothschild, former
home secretary Herbert Samuel, and a man soon to figure very prominently
in Sykes’s Palestine schemes, the incoming president of the English
Zionist Federation, Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>A forty-three-year-old émigré from czarist Russia, the dynamic,
goateed Weizmann was an erstwhile chemistry lecturer at the University
of Manchester who over the previous decade had emerged as one of the
most articulate and persuasive voices of British Zionism. A prominent
figure at international Zionist conferences, he was also intent on
converting rhetoric to action; in 1908, he had helped create the
Palestine Land Development Company, chartered to buy up agricultural
land in Palestine for Jewish settlement. What had most brought Weizmann
to the attention of British officials, however, was his work in
chemistry. Shortly before his meeting with Sykes, he had developed a
revolutionary process to create synthetic acetone, a key component in
explosives, and in making his discovery available to the British
munitions industry he had won the government’s undying gratitude. (This
surely negated any taint that might have attached to his also being the
older brother of Minna Weizmann, the erstwhile lover of Curt Prüfer, who
had been arrested as a German spy in Egypt in 1915.) Serendipitously,
during his tenure at Manchester, Weizmann had also won the sympathies of
his local member of Parliament to the Zionist cause; that MP was Arthur
Balfour, the new British foreign secretary.</p>
<p>At that February 7 gathering, the British Jewish leaders had
emphatically stated precisely what Mark Sykes hoped to hear: that there
was simply no way the international Zionist movement in general, nor the
Zionist settlers in Palestine in particular, would accept a joint
Entente administration in Palestine. To the contrary, all demanded sole
British control of the region, or, as one of the attendees put it, “a
Jewish State in Palestine under the British Crown.” In response, Sykes
announced his readiness to present the Zionist viewpoint to the War
Cabinet. He also suggested that the assembled dignitaries begin lobbying
their religious brethren elsewhere to that goal, even “offering to make
War Office telegraph facilities available to them so they could
communicate secretly with leading Zionists in Paris, Petrograd, Rome and
Washington D.C.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the politician from Hull couldn’t quite part with
his penchants for blithe optimism and the dissembling statement. As far
as Arab sensibilities were concerned, Sykes opined at the February 7
meeting, he could see no objection on their part to increased Jewish
settlement in Palestine—an interesting assertion considering that, even
at this late date, no Arab was aware the Entente powers had any designs
on Palestine at all. (He obviously could not have known Lawrence was
just then telling Faisal about the Sykes-Picot accord.) His suspicions
undoubtedly aroused by Sykes’s queries on the desirability of a joint
administration, Lord Rothschild had then bluntly asked what promises had
been made to the French in the region. To this, Sykes made the
astonishing reply that “the French have no particular position in
Palestine and are not entitled to anything there.” These were just two
more faulty assertions—the first perhaps an exercise in wishful
thinking, the second an outright lie—to join all the others Mark Sykes
had promulgated in recent months, an ever-growing corpus of half-truths
and conflicting schemes that even he would soon begin having difficulty
keeping straight.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he was clever enough to realize that all was very
fluid, that a precipitating event or a changed set of circumstances on
the ground might upend everything once again, rendering some of his
entanglements moot and giving rise to new opportunities to achieve his
goals—as variable as those goals might be. What’s more, as he sailed to
Egypt that April, Sykes was about to be reunited with a man who
understood the need for bold action: Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>The agronomist from Athlit was a very different type of Zionist from
those Sykes had quietly plotted with in London. Those men were
sober-minded and cautious, their approach gentlemanly, whereas Aaronsohn
was brash and impatient, a man hardened by his having actually lived the
Zionist “dream” in Palestine. In comparison with some of those London
confreres, he also had a much grander vision of what should happen in
Palestine: not just an expanded Jewish presence under British
protection, but an eventual outright Jewish state, one that would extend
from the shores of the Mediterranean to east of the Jordan River and
nearly to the gates of Damascus. Aaron Aaronsohn was a radical, but as
Mark Sykes well knew, it was often the radical who catalyzed change.</p>
<p>What he couldn’t have guessed just then was that he and Aaronsohn
were about to be handed a bountiful gift from someone on the opposite
side of the battlefield, Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>TO THE ANNOYANCE of defense-minded military commanders throughout
history, civilians have a tendency to stay put in their homes until an
enemy invading force is just over the horizon. Then, once the arrows or
bullets or missiles begin to fly, these civilians bundle up their
families and as many possessions as time allows and take to the roads in
whatever conveyance is available to them. Predictably, the most common
result of this rushed exodus is severe traffic congestion—and often
complete paralysis—on all paths leading away from the battlefront,
making it extremely difficult for the defending force to bring
reinforcements to the scene. To guard against this, armies have
routinely forced civilians out of a likely battle zone well ahead of
time—and at bayonet point if required. Due to the stasis of the battle
lines, such forced evacuations had rarely been necessary on the Western
Front through the first two and a half years of World War I, but they
had been a common feature in the east, and most especially on the
Ottoman Front.</p>
<p>It was a policy that came quite easily to the Ottomans, and for
reasons that went beyond simple military expediency. Many times over the
centuries, the sultans in Constantinople, mindful of both their
comparative military weakness and the polyglot nature of their empire,
had adopted a kind of scorched-earth policy in the face of external
threat, uprooting entire populations that might tacitly or overtly
collaborate with invaders. Time permitting, also removed from an
invader’s path were livestock, farm equipment, and food stores, most
anything that might provide the enemy sustenance, and that which
couldn’t be taken away was burned, smashed, or poisoned.</p>
<p>For all their reformist ideas in other spheres, the Young Turks had
seen little reason to revisit this tradition when they came to power in
1908; more likely, they’d simply been overwhelmed by the pace of events.
During the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, entire civilian populations were
forcibly ejected by most all the combatant armies, less for reasons of
military convenience than in pursuit of a policy that a century later
would become known as ethnic cleansing. That massive if largely
forgotten human tragedy—hundreds of thousands of Turks, Bulgars,
Macedonians, and Greeks were permanently expelled from their ancestral
homes—set the precedent for the far more brutal and deadly expulsion of
Anatolia’s Armenian population beginning in the spring of 1915. Despite
that ghastly recent example and his own efforts to ameliorate it, when
Djemal Pasha found his own Syrian realm under threat in early 1917, it
was to the policy of expulsion that he turned.</p>
<p>At first there was nothing controversial about it. In late February,
with the British invaders massing below Gaza and clearly about to
strike, he had ordered the evacuation of that town’s population, perhaps
twenty thousand civilians in all. It was a move the Syrian governor had
every reason to congratulate himself on; when the British attack came in
late March, the cleared roads to the north and east of Gaza had allowed
the Turks to rush in reinforcements and carry the day.</p>
<p>In that battle’s aftermath, Djemal and his German commanders studied
the map of the larger southern Palestine region; surely the British were
going to try again, and just as surely they would be more artful than to
attack over the same ground twice. In trying to anticipate where that
next strike might come, Djemal’s concerns centered on the coastal town
of Jaffa, some forty miles to the north.</p>
<p>Throughout March, rumors reaching Djemal’s headquarters had held that
the British might bypass the Turkish trenches in Gaza by making an
amphibious landing to the north. Not only did the smooth beaches and
gentle surf of Jaffa provide a nearly ideal site for such a landing, but
so did the town’s mixed population; among its forty thousand residents
were some ten thousand Jews and perhaps four thousand Christians,
minorities that were becoming increasingly disenchanted under Ottoman
rule. While those initial concerns had been mooted by the failed British
frontal assault at Gaza on March 26, they came rushing back in its
aftermath, so much so that on March 28, Djemal ordered Jaffa’s
evacuation. After initially giving residents less than a week to
organize their departures, Djemal relented to protests by Jewish
leaders—Passover, one of the most sacred of Jewish holidays, was about
to begin—and extended the deadline another eight days.</p>
<p>Despite the Ottoman government’s proclivity for sunny proclamations
at such times—there was usually much talk of extra trains being laid on
to transport the uprooted to safety, of the pleasant temporary quarters
being readied to ensure the refugees’ continuing comfort—these
evacuations were invariably messy, wretched affairs. For the criminally
minded, they provided an opportunity to loot the homes of their departed
neighbors, or to waylay exhausted and overburdened travelers on the
road. Given the corruption endemic to all levels of Ottoman government,
they also tended to be highly selective; those blessed with the right
connections or the funds to bribe the right officials might be allowed
to stay behind or only move to a town’s outskirts, while others were
being herded days or even weeks away. Perhaps inevitably, these abuses
were likely to be most prevalent in a “mixed” town like Jaffa, a chance
for the ethnic and religious animosities that always lurked below the
surface of Ottoman society to be given full play.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was initially nothing about the evacuation of
Jaffa to suggest it would be anything more than one of those little
forgotten footnotes of war, another point of misery for a civilian
population long grown accustomed to it. But in issuing his edict, Djemal
Pasha unwittingly set in motion one of the most consequential
disinformation campaigns of World War I. The first link in that chain of
events occurred on the night of April 17, when a twenty-seven-year-old
woman was helped aboard a British spy ship trolling off the coast of
Palestine.</p>
<p>IT WAS A poignant reunion. Aaron Aaronsohn hadn’t seen his younger
sister Sarah in nearly a year, but there she was in Port Said, pale and
weak but alive, having just come off the Managem from Athlit. Rushing
her to his rooms at the Continental Hotel in central Cairo, Aaronsohn
summoned a doctor, who diagnosed anemia and proffered iron tablets.
Despite her exhausted state, Aaronsohn then began pumping his sister for
news from Palestine.</p>
<p>To say that Sarah Aaronsohn was an independent spirit would have been
a gross understatement. As a young woman growing up in Zichron Yaakov,
she had fairly scandalized its more conservative residents with her
insistence on riding horseback and participating in hunts in the
surrounding foothills with the men. Like her male siblings, she was
extremely well educated, had traveled—in her case, throughout central
Europe—and possessed of a worldly sophistication quite out of keeping
with a woman coming of age in the hardscrabble Jewish colonies in
Palestine. Even if she had bowed to tradition by quickly marrying after
the engagement of her younger sister, Rivka, to Absalom Feinberg—it was
considered close to scandalous for an older sister not to marry
first—she’d been modern enough to walk out on her unhappy marriage in
Constantinople and not look back.</p>
<p>Perhaps most shocking for a woman in the early 1900s, Sarah Aaronsohn
had made no attempt to hide either her intelligence or her natural
leadership skills. While these qualities spurred resentment in some,
others were totally enamored, and over the years the attractive
Aaronsohn sister had gathered about her an ardent coterie of male
suitors. She was not shy about trading on that attraction for her own
higher purposes. Upon the death of Absalom Feinberg in the Sinai desert
in January 1917, Sarah had assumed leadership of the NILI spy ring in
Palestine, and among the operatives scattered across the region, a
network she had helped expand to nearly two dozen, were several men
clearly in love with her.</p>
<p>That element aside, Sarah Aaronsohn seemed uniquely suited to the
perilous role into which she’d been thrust and, judging by the results,
performed it more ably than either of NILI’s original leaders—her
temperamental brother; the impetuous Feinberg—might have done. As a
woman, she was largely immune from the suspicions that attached to
Palestine’s westernized Jews in the eyes of Ottoman officials, and she
had used that immunity to make extended reconnaissance trips through the
countryside, just an innocent “lady’s outing” should she ever be
stopped. Once contact with the British had been established, she turned
Athlit into her command post, sorting the bits of intelligence coming in
from all over Palestine and ensuring it was organized in time for the
next scheduled delivery to the spy ship offshore. One measure of her
steeliness was her ability to keep the death of Absalom Feinberg, the
man with whom she had shared a chaste love, a secret from the rest of
the NILI ring. So as to maintain organizational morale, she held to the
fiction concocted by her brother in Cairo that Feinberg had gone off to
Europe to train as an Entente pilot.</p>
<p>Now, in mid-April 1917, Sarah Aaronsohn had come to Egypt with a
disturbing story to tell. Three weeks earlier, she told her brother,
Djemal Pasha had ordered Jaffa’s evacuation. While this edict applied to
the entire population of the town, it was hardly a surprise that the
burden had fallen especially heavy on its Jewish residents; with
transport scarce, they were forced to leave most of their possessions
behind, while simultaneously suffering abuse and depredations by their
long-resentful Muslim neighbors. According to Sarah, at least two Jewish
men had been lynched on the Jaffa outskirts.</p>
<p>For Aaron Aaronsohn, the news was deeply alarming. Mindful as he was
of the fate of the Armenians, the Jaffa expulsions suggested that
something similar might now befall the Jews. He immediately set out to
alert his associates in British intelligence of the potential
humanitarian crisis looming in southern Palestine.</p>
<p>His timing couldn’t have been worse. On the very day of Sarah
Aaronsohn’s arrival in Cairo, April 19, Archibald Murray had thrown his
army against the Turkish trenches at Gaza a second time. Proving Djemal
Pasha wrong, Murray chose to attack over precisely the same ground as in
the first assault, although opting for an even more artless, human-wave
approach. Just about the only British refinements since the First Battle
of Gaza were the use of tanks and poison gas against the enemy, but even
these couldn’t alter the outcome; in the six thousand casualties the
British suffered at the hands of the vastly outnumbered but victorious
Turks was a debacle so sweeping as to be apparent to all.</p>
<p>Few could have been more dumbfounded than Aaron Aaronsohn. Back on
March 12, prior to Murray’s first attack, British planners had sought
out his counsel based on his intimate knowledge of the topography of
southern Palestine. The agronomist had been aghast that the British
proposed to make their main thrust through an area south of the town
known as Wadi Ghazzal, a stretch of flat ground broken by meandering
streams, which then rose up to a gridwork of nearly impenetrable
cactus-fenced animal pens. “I said I considered the ground very much to
our disadvantage,” Aaronsohn had written at the time, “and would give a
great chance to the Turkish snipers. Wadis there are numerous and
difficult to cross.” Despite this admonition, in both Gaza assaults the
British had made for the streams and cactus fences of Wadi Ghazzal like
homing pigeons.</p>
<p>Of more immediate concern to Aaronsohn, with the latest Gaza disaster
dominating the concerns of British Cairo, it was impossible to get
anyone to pay attention to what might be happening to the Jewish
population of Jaffa. Over the course of that next week, the scientist
desperately approached most any British official he could think of, but
got nowhere. Then his luck suddenly changed. It did so on April 27, when
he was finally able to obtain an audience with Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>Since their arrival in Cairo five days earlier, most of Sykes’s and
Picot’s time had been taken up in conferences with the “delegation” of
Syrian exiles that Sykes had preselected to represent Arab interests in
the region. Much of the urgency of these talks had dissipated with the
grim news out of Gaza, but after several days of negotiations, Sykes
felt confident that he’d managed to bridge the vast gulf between
France’s imperial designs in Syria and Britain’s pledge to Syrian
independence. A great aid in this bridging process was the fact that the
three Syrian delegates were totally unaware a gulf existed.</p>
<p>“Main difficulty,” Sykes explained in a cable to the director of
military intelligence back in London, “was to manoeuvre the delegates,
without showing them a map or letting them know that there was an actual
geographical or detailed agreement [already in place], into asking for
what we are ready to give them.”</p>
<p>With the “Syrian Question” thus nicely resolving itself, at least
temporarily, Sykes was able to carve out time for other things. High on
that list was meeting with Aaron Aaronsohn, who had been beseeching
Sykes’s retinue for an appointment for days. Their reunion took place in
a conference room of the Savoy Hotel on the morning of April 27.</p>
<p>“At last!” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary. “We immediately broached
intimate subjects. He told me that since he was talking with a Jewish
patriot, he would entrust me with very secret matters—some of which were
not even known to the Foreign Office.”</p>
<p>Sykes filled him in on his clandestine meeting with the British
Zionist leaders at the London townhouse on February 7, as well as
expounded on a new formula for Middle East peace he’d recently devised,
a scheme that called for a grand alliance of the Jews, the Arabs, and
the remnants of the Armenians. With such an alliance, Sykes confidently
explained, the Arabs could be made compliant—they had to know that
without Jewish and British support, their independence bid would
fail—but would also gain the clout to defy the French. At the same time,
such a pact would freeze out the grasping Italians, marginalize the
Russians, create a pro-British buffer state in protection of Egypt and
India, all while paying lip service to the anticolonial demands of
Britain’s newest ally, the United States. How the Arabophobic Aaronsohn
responded to this dizzying graph-paper concoction—its complexity only
surpassed by its absurdity—isn’t known. Most likely, he simply listened
in respectful silence; after all, he had pressing matters of his own to
take up with Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>If other British officials had been too distracted to pay attention
to the predicament of Jaffa’s Jewish population, not so the War
Cabinet’s new assistant secretary. Instead, it appears Sykes instantly
grasped the potential propaganda bonanza Aaronsohn’s news provided, a
way to propel those still noncommittal elements of international Jewry
toward the Zionist-British cause. He quickly dispatched Aaronsohn to
work up a memo on the Jaffa situation, and to meet with him again the
next morning.</p>
<p>In writing on the plight of the Armenians five months earlier,
Aaronsohn had paid grudging respect to Djemal Pasha, pointing out that
despite his personality flaws and failures as an administrator, the
Syrian governor had been resolute in trying to stop the Armenian
massacres and in alleviating the suffering of the survivors. The
agronomist had also at times benefited from Djemal’s changeable and
oddly courteous nature, his personal appeals to him winning the release
of Absalom Feinberg after his arrest as a potential spy, as well as the
modification of an array of edicts injurious to Jewish settlers. As he
sat down to write his account for Mark Sykes on the afternoon of April
27, however, Aaronsohn appreciated that here was a golden opportunity to
advance the Zionist cause, and to fully capitalize on that opportunity
meant creative license would have to be taken. The primary victim of
that creativity was to be Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>Reconvening with Mark Sykes at 9:15 the next morning, Aaronsohn
handed over his memorandum on Jaffa. In quick order, Sykes fired off a
top-secret cable to the Foreign Office asking them to get hold of Chaim
Weizmann at the English Zionist Federation and deliver the following
message: “Aaron Aaronsohn asks me to inform you that Televiv [the Jewish
enclave of Jaffa] has been sacked. 10,000 Palestinian Jews are now
without home or food. Whole yeshuv [settlement] is threatened with
destruction. Jemal [Pasha] has publicly stated that Armenian policy will
now be applied to Jews. Pray inform [Jewish] centers without naming
Aaron Aaronsohn or source of information.”</p>
<p>The first to heed the call was the Jewish Chronicle, Britain’s
preeminent Zionist newspaper. On May 4, under subheadlines entitled
“Grave Reports—Terrible Outrages—Threats of Wholesale Massacre,” readers
were informed, “It is with profound sorrow and concern that the Jewish
Chronicle learns, from an absolutely reliable source, the very gravest
news of the Jews in Palestine.… Tel Aviv, the beautiful Garden City
suburb of Jaffa, has been sacked and lies a mere heap of ruins, while
similar wanton destruction has in all probability taken place in other
specifically Jewish parts of Palestine.”</p>
<p>Taking up the fiction about statements made by the Syrian governor,
the Chronicle continued, “But even worse is threatened. For the Turkish
Governor, Djemal Pasha, has proclaimed his intention of the authorities
[sic] to wipe out mercilessly the Jewish population of Palestine, his
public statement being that the Armenian policy of massacre is to be
applied to the Jews. If this dire and dastardly threat is carried into
effect, it will mean not alone that thousands of Jews … will be put to
the sword in cold blood, but that in addition the whole of the work of
Palestinian re-settlement will be utterly destroyed.”</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the grim news out of Palestine reverberated
through Jewish communities in Britain, the United States, and
continental Europe, and drew anguished appeals to their governments that
some kind of action be taken. In the case of the British Foreign Office
leadership, however, just what could be done was not at all clear. “I
regret,” one senior diplomat commented on the same day the Chronicle
story appeared, “that no action by us seems in any way feasible.”</p>
<p>But at least one British official saw in the Jaffa story the chance
to take matters to an entirely new level, not just to sway international
Jewish opinion but to bring pressure to bear on his own government. This
was William Ormsby-Gore, the Conservative member of Parliament who had
been so impressed by Aaron Aaronsohn during his time in Cairo at the
Arab Bureau; in May 1917, Ormsby-Gore was back in London and working
with Mark Sykes on the War Cabinet’s Middle Eastern affairs desk. While
Sykes had left Cairo for a brief trip to Arabia on April 30, thus
falling out of easy communication, he found Ormsby-Gore’s cable awaiting
his return to Egypt on May 9.</p>
<p>“I think we ought to use pogroms in Palestine as propaganda,”
Ormsby-Gore wrote. “Any spicy tales of atrocity would be eagerly
welcomed by the propaganda people here, and Aaron Aaronsohn could send
some lurid stories to the Jewish papers.”</p>
<p>Sykes received no argument from Aaronsohn. The two had another long
meeting on May 11, at which, the scientist reported, they “discussed the
question of American Jews and of the propaganda we could do there [sic]
now in recruiting for the Palestine front. Sir Mark offered to forward
any telegrams or letters which I might care to send.”</p>
<p>Perhaps mindful of his own growing reputation for exaggeration, Sykes
had the foresight to send Aaronsohn’s new and expanded missive out under
the signature of High Commissioner Reginald Wingate. “During Passover,”
Wingate’s cable to London that same day read, “the entire Jewish
population of Jaffa expelled towards north. Homes, property ransacked,
population in flight robbed with connivance of Turkish Authorities. Jews
resisting [were] pillaged, hanged. Thousands wandering helplessly on
roads, starving.” And now there was a frightening new development in the
telling, an extending of the evacuations to the much larger Jewish
population in Jerusalem. “Masses of young Jerusalem Jews deported,
northward, destination unknown. Forcible evacuation of [Jerusalem
Jewish] colony imminent.”</p>
<p>Under Wingate’s signature, circulation of this cable wasn’t limited
to the Foreign Office leadership; instead, it landed on the desks of the
king, the prime minister, and the entire War Cabinet. At the same time,
Aaronsohn gave Sykes a list of some fifty Zionist leaders throughout the
world to be immediately notified. Now the Jaffa story went the 1917
version of viral. “Cruelties to Jews Deported in Jaffa,” screamed a
headline in the New York Times, “Djemal Pasha Blamed,” while the
American government, so recently enlisted to the war effort, joined an
international chorus in denouncing this latest outrage by the
Constantinople regime. Nowhere was that chorus louder than in Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The Turks and their German allies might be forgiven for being slow to
respond to this onslaught of condemnation; after all, the Jaffa
evacuation had occurred in early April, and it was now mid-May. After
initially refusing to dignify the charges with a response, Djemal Pasha
finally flatly denied the accusations, pointing out that the entire
population of Jaffa had been evacuated, not just its Jews, and that the
process—unpleasant though it undoubtedly was for those affected—had been
completed in an orderly and peaceful fashion; in fact, the governor had
granted Jaffa’s Jewish population special considerations during the
operation denied others. As for the claims of Jews being “deported” from
Jerusalem, the Syrian governor countered, there had been no evacuations
there at all. These assertions were seconded by the regimes in
Constantinople and Berlin, and even by a collection of Jewish leaders in
Palestine, including Jerusalem’s chief rabbi.</p>
<p>But it was too little too late. In the minds of much of the
international public, the “pogrom” in Jaffa was already an established
fact, the latest Central Powers atrocity to join the “rape of Belgium”
and the massacres of the Armenians. It also alerted the Zionists and
their British government allies to the tremendous tool they’d been
handed. Coming so closely after the fall of the hated czar and the
admission of the United States into the war, the Jaffa story helped
accelerate a tectonic shift taking place among international Jewry, the
growing conviction that their future lay with the Entente.</p>
<p>Of more immediate impact, it played to the argument of the more
radical Zionists that any accommodation or compromise with Turkey was no
longer possible. In early June, with the Jaffa story still raging, Aaron
Aaronsohn penned cables to some of the most prominent leaders in the
American Jewish community, men who continued to be cautious about
wholeheartedly embracing the Zionist cause and who in some cases still
imagined the future of Jewish settlement in Palestine as best served by
Ottoman rule. To lend further authority to Aaronsohn’s message—among its
recipients was a sitting Supreme Court justice, Louis Brandeis, as well
as a future one, Felix Frankfurter—Mark Sykes arranged for the cables to
be routed through the British embassy in Washington for delivery.
Typical was the cable received by Judge Mayer Sulzberger in
Philadelphia:</p>
<p>“Turkish atrocities on Jewish populations in Palestine reported on
reliable information,” Aaronsohn wrote. “It is high time to abandon our
previous forgiving attitude towards Turks.… Now that Turks have
committed those crimes, Jewish attitude and American public opinion must
undergo complete change. Only efficient way to quick release of Jewish
populations from Turkish clutches is to attack latter thoroughly in the
field and everywhere.… We must present a united front, and concentrate
Jewish influence on wresting Palestine from Turkish hands.”</p>
<p>In that same month of June, a rather different version of the Jaffa
story began to emerge. In response to Entente appeals, Spain, Sweden,
and the Vatican, all neutral entities in the conflict, sent envoys to
investigate what had happened there. Both the Spanish and Vatican envoys
quickly concluded that the reports of Jewish massacres and persecutions
were without foundation, while their Swedish counterpart went even
further. “In many ways,” he wrote, “the Jewish community of Jaffa had
fared far better—and certainly no worse—than the resident Moslem
population in the evacuation.” Shortly afterward, the U.S. consulate in
Jerusalem also reported that the accounts of violence against the Jaffa
Jews were “grossly exaggerated.” Even Aaron Aaronsohn was ultimately
forced to concede that the two Jewish men allegedly “lynched” in Jaffa
had actually been arrested on charges of looting, and evidently not hung
after all.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter, of course. In war, truth is whatever people can be
led to believe, and Djemal Pasha had just handed his enemies a “truth”
that would change Middle Eastern history. The fiction of what happened
in Jaffa in 1917—a fiction repeated as fact by most historians writing
on the period since—would now become the ur-myth for the contention that
the Jewish community in Palestine could never be safe under Muslim rule,
that to survive it needed a state of its own.</p>
<p>ON APRIL 21, a British navy patrol boat put in to Wejh harbor with a
cargo of intense interest to Captain T. E. Lawrence: eleven Turkish
prisoners of war. Until the previous morning, the men had been part of
the Turkish garrison defending Aqaba.</p>
<p>Acting on rumors that a German minelaying operation was under way in
the vicinity of Aqaba, three British patrol boats had closed on the port
just before dawn on April 20 and put ashore a landing party, catching
the tiny garrison off guard. The brief ensuing gun battle left two
Turkish soldiers dead, eleven captured, and the rest—some fifty or sixty
by best estimate—taken to the hills. Since six of the prisoners were
Syrian draftees and expressed a desire to join with the rebel forces of
Faisal ibn Hussein, one of the British patrol boats had brought them
down to Wejh for questioning.</p>
<p>Over the course of that day, Lawrence interrogated each of the
Syrians in turn. From them he learned that while the Aqaba garrison
fluctuated in size, it rarely consisted of more than one hundred
soldiers. Of even greater import considering the scheme he was hatching,
the total number of Turkish soldiers billeted in the blockhouses along
the sixty-mile Wadi Itm trail between Aqaba and Maan was at most just
two hundred more. It meant that Lawrence’s plan just might work; if he
could raise an Arab force at the eastern terminus of that trail and
launch a lightning advance over the mountains, he could sweep the
isolated Turkish garrisons before him and fall on Aqaba practically
unopposed.</p>
<p>But just because Lawrence saw the opportunity before him, it didn’t
necessarily follow that anyone else in the British military would. Still
in effect was Gilbert Clayton’s March 8 directive that the Arabs not
move on Aqaba. Instead, all attention was to remain focused on attacking
the Hejaz Railway to block the Turkish garrison’s withdrawal from Medina
(it would still be some weeks before the British realized the Turks had
no intention of leaving Medina), an imperative that allowed for no side
adventures.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way to avoid having one’s ideas shot down is to
never explicitly voice them. Rather than take his proposal up with
Clayton directly, Lawrence chose to engage the two other British
officers then based in Wejh in a generalized discourse about the
insights into guerrilla warfare he had gained during his convalescence
in Wadi Ais. In particular, he would later claim, he expounded on the
foolishness of trying to take Medina from the Turks, and the
unfeasibility of trying to organize the Arabs into a blocking force on
the Hejaz Railway. Instead, he suggested, they needed to spread the
Turks thin by expanding the war front as much as possible. Among other
things, that meant going north with “a highly mobile, highly equipped
striking force of the smallest size, and use it successively at
distributed points of the Turkish line.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence’s listeners in Wejh, both career military men, it may
have all sounded intriguing, but also like little more than a
distraction to the mission at hand. This was a reaction that Lawrence
was rather counting on. “Everyone was too busy with his own work to give
me specific authority to launch out on mine,” he would recount. “All I
gained was a hearing, and a qualified admission that my
counter-offensive [idea] might be a useful diversion.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how his fellow officers might have lent Lawrence
“specific authority” for his scheme, since it’s clear from their own
field reports that he never indicated that this diversionary force might
make for Aqaba. Lawrence adopted an even more oblique manner in his
approach to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah, informing his superior that Auda Abu
Tayi would soon be taking a raiding party toward Maan, and that Lawrence
was considering accompanying the party to ensure their actions
complemented Britain’s current military objectives. Wilson concurred,
reporting to Clayton on May 1 that “Auda is to travel north, probably
accompanied by Lawrence, with their first aim to disrupt the railway
around Maan.” Omitted was any mention of what their second aim might
be.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, a book rife with self-justifications, Lawrence
would offer a truly breathtaking one to explain his decision to strike
out on his own: “The element I would withdraw from the railway scheme
was only my single self and, in the circumstances, this amount was
negligible, since I felt so strongly against it that my help there would
have been half-hearted. So I decided to go my own way, with or without
orders.”</p>
<p>In other words, as Lawrence no longer saw the point in trying to shut
down the railway, it was really best for all concerned that he go find
something else to do. Small wonder why so many of his military superiors
found the Oxford scholar infuriating.</p>
<p>Underlying this, though, was an even grander psychological
rationalization for the action Lawrence was contemplating. In his mind,
upholding the promises made to the Arabs truly would serve Great
Britain’s long-term interests, not just as a point of honor but as a way
to minimize the influence of other European powers—allies today,
perhaps, but surely competitors again tomorrow—throughout the region. A
vital first step in this campaign was to allow the Arabs to take their
revolution into Syria, and thus steal that land away from France. The
core problem, in Lawrence’s estimation, was that Great Britain had yet
to grasp what was best for her, and he simply didn’t have time to
explain.</p>
<p>BEFORE SETTING OUT for Aqaba, Lawrence was to have one more fateful
meeting in Wejh. It came on the morning of May 7, when a British
destroyer briefly put into the harbor. On board was Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>The two had first met during Sykes’s fact-finding mission to Egypt in
1915, and despite their vast differences in personality—Sykes gregarious
and charming, Lawrence taciturn and painfully shy—had reportedly gotten
along quite well. That didn’t last long. As with most everyone else in
the Cairo military intelligence office, Lawrence’s opinion of the
diplomat had rapidly soured once details of the Sykes-Picot Agreement
became known to them in the spring of 1916. Certainly, Sykes’s
continuing fondness for firing off fatuous memos proposing neat
solutions to the region’s problems—proposals often in direct opposition
to those he had advocated weeks or even days earlier—had done nothing to
rehabilitate his image in Lawrence’s eyes in the year since. In his
view, Sykes fairly epitomized that vexing feature of Edwardian England,
the aristocratic gadfly, a man who could gain a hearing for his reckless
ideas by virtue of his pedigree and the breezy confidence with which he
voiced them.</p>
<p>In their meeting on May 7, however, Lawrence was to discover
something else about the man; for want of a more decorous term, Mark
Sykes was also a liar.</p>
<p>Indeed, that the two were meeting in Wejh at all that day was a
by-product of Sykes having been caught out in his latest round of
trickery. The diplomat was just returning from an audience with King
Hussein, an encounter Sykes had wished to avoid but which had been
forced on him by the resident agent in Jeddah, Colonel Cyril Wilson.</p>
<p>For all his stiff-necked priggishness, the swagger-stick-toting
Wilson had gradually emerged as the voice of conscience for British
policy in the Middle East. In the long debate of late 1916 over whether
a British brigade should be deployed in the Hejaz, Wilson had initially
been among its fiercest advocates, and had been tasked by his superior,
Reginald Wingate, to compel King Hussein to that view. Over the course
of numerous meetings with Hussein, however, it had gradually occurred to
the resident agent that perhaps the old man in Mecca knew his subjects
and the politics of western Arabia better than the Allied advisors newly
arrived to the scene. Ultimately, when Wingate had once again ordered
his underling to lean on Hussein over the matter, Wilson, heretofore
regarded as something of a Wingate yes-man, had essentially refused to
do so and been instrumental in seeing the proposal finally shelved.</p>
<p>Wilson had had a far more visceral reaction upon learning of Sykes’s
scheme to avoid Hussein in favor of his sham negotiations with the
Syrian “delegates” in Cairo. In late March he had sent a long and
anguished letter to Clayton enumerating both the problems inevitably to
come from this act of deception and the benefits to be derived by being
honest with Hussein. “We now have a chance, which is not likely to occur
again, of winning the gratitude of millions of Moslems of the [British]
Empire,” he wrote. “For Heaven’s sake, let us be straight with the old
man; I am convinced it will pay us in the end.”</p>
<p>While that appeal had been in vain, it seemed the good colonel in
Jeddah was quite capable of backroom maneuvers of his own. At his next
meeting with Hussein, he urged the king to formally request a meeting
with Mark Sykes. When Wilson forwarded that request to Reginald Wingate,
another man who, despite his interventionist impulses, held to the
British tradition of fair play, it quickly became an invitation Sykes
couldn’t refuse. On April 30, with his and Picot’s conferences with the
Syrian “delegates” in Cairo concluded, Sykes had boarded the British
destroyer in Port Suez and set off for Jeddah.</p>
<p>Even for a supremely self-confident man, it must have been a
stressful voyage. It was one thing to bamboozle a few preselected
functionaries in Cairo with no knowledge of the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence; it would surely be quite another to fool one of its
actual authors. But then, Sykes had other cards to play. Chief among
them was his ability to control the flow of information. Just as he had
arranged to have a first meeting with the Syrians in Cairo without Picot
present, so now he would be meeting alone with Hussein. As a result,
should any future dispute arise over what had or had not been discussed,
it would be the word of a highly respected British envoy against that of
a mercurial desert chieftain long known for forgetfulness and willful
misinterpretation.</p>
<p>It might have all worked out just fine—at least for the time being,
which was all Mark Sykes could reasonably hope for—if he hadn’t decided
to stop off in Wejh en route to confer with Faisal. By chance, Lawrence
was away on a brief reconnaissance trip when Sykes called on May 2, but
he got a full report from Faisal on what had transpired upon his return
to Wejh two days later. By then, Sykes was already on his way to Jeddah
and his meeting with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Judging by the report he sent to Reginald Wingate on the evening of
May 5, Sykes’s foray into shuttle diplomacy could scarcely have gone
better: “On 2nd May, I saw Sherif Faisal at Wejh and explained to him
the principle of the Anglo-French agreement in regard to an Arab
confederation; after much argument he accepted the principle and seemed
satisfied.” That success had presaged one even more remarkable, for that
very afternoon Sykes had met with King Hussein. “In accordance with my
instructions, I explained the principle of the [Anglo-French] agreement
as regards an Arab confederation or State.… I impressed upon the King
the importance of Franco-Arab friendship and I at least got him to admit
that it was essential to Arab development in Syria, but this after a
very lengthy argument.”</p>
<p>A close reader of that May 5 report might have been disquieted by the
peculiar symmetry of these two meetings—forthrightness by Sykes in
outlining French-British designs in the region, followed by Arab
argument, followed ultimately by Arab acceptance—while the truly cynical
might have concluded that, with his emphasis on the quarreling involved,
Sykes was already laying in his defense should there be future
disagreement with Faisal and Hussein over what had been said or agreed
to. In the interim, though, the trip was a triumph of diplomacy, a
crucial first step toward resolving the nettlesome issues that stood
between Britain and France and their Arab allies.</p>
<p>“Please tell Monsieur Picot,” Sykes ended his May 5 cable to Wingate,
“that I am satisfied with my interview with Faisal and the King, as they
both now stand at the same point as was reached at our last joint
meeting with the 3 Syrian delegates in Cairo.”</p>
<p>What Mark Sykes didn’t know, of course, was that in Faisal ibn
Hussein he had been speaking with a man quite aware of the Sykes-Picot
Agreement—courtesy of T. E. Lawrence—and in no way did Sykes’s vague and
generalized discussion of that pact on May 2 match up with what the Arab
leader already knew. Nevertheless, whether hewing to the Arab
negotiating tradition of not tipping one’s hand until absolutely
necessary, or worried that Lawrence would be exposed as his source,
Faisal had not confronted the diplomat over his obfuscations at the
time.</p>
<p>Not that he was in any better position to do so when Sykes stopped
back by on May 7. Faisal’s knowledge of the true framework of
Sykes-Picot, as opposed to the bastardized version Sykes had chosen to
tell him, was the great and dangerous secret that he and Lawrence
shared, and to reveal it now could only invite disaster: for Faisal,
estrangement and perhaps abandonment by his British benefactors; for
Lawrence, immediate transfer and probable court-martial.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lawrence did have sanctioned knowledge of
Sykes-Picot, which meant he on his own could confront Sykes over the
sanitized version told to Faisal—and, presumably, to Hussein. All
indications are that Lawrence provoked just such a confrontation.
Neither man was to make record of their meeting in Wejh, but it appears
to have been a highly contentious one. From that day on, Lawrence’s
attitude toward Sykes would be hostile. For his part, Sykes would miss
few chances to try to denigrate or marginalize Lawrence in any way he
could.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, it seems that encounter with Sykes in Wejh
came to simultaneously haunt Lawrence and to provide a certain kind of
relief. He stood vindicated in not trusting in the honor of his
government, and in imparting to Faisal its secret plan to betray the
Arab cause. To whatever degree his conscience had been bothered by that
decision, in the slippery schemes of Mark Sykes it was now cleansed.</p>
<p>At the same time, he appreciated that in his countryman was a
particularly formidable rival. By comparison, Édouard Brémond was easy,
his various schemes made predictable by his singular pursuit of French
hegemony. Mark Sykes, by contrast, was a man ruled by whim, who didn’t
feel bound by—perhaps at times didn’t even remember—the myriad promises
that tripped so easily from his lips. He was able to stay ahead of it
all by a talent for deceit, but since he was in a position of power,
pulling the levers from Jeddah to London and all points in between, at
the end of the day there would probably be no final appeal to British
ideals of honor or justice, all would be sacrificed to convenience. The
only recourse for the Arabs, then, was to try to change the facts on the
ground, to strike a blow that might upend the plans of the
dealmakers.</p>
<p>It was with such thoughts that, two days later, Lawrence set out on
the long and dangerous trek toward Aqaba. For what would soon become one
of the most audacious and celebrated military exploits of World War I,
his accompanying “army” consisted of fewer than forty-five Arab
warriors.</p>
