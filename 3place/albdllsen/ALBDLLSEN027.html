<h4 id="chapter-7-treachery">Chapter 7: Treachery</h4>
<p>1 “It seems to me”: Macdonogh to Nicolson, January 7, 1916; PRO-FO
882/16.</p>
<p>2 “and partly because”: Lawrence to Leeds, November 16, 1915, in
Brown, The Letters of T. E. Lawrence, pp. 78–79.</p>
<p>3 A few smaller points: The precise nature of the agreement reached
between Emir Hussein and the British government in the so-called
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence remains one of the most contentious
points of Middle Eastern history. Through countless books on the
subject, historians of all stripes have managed to squeeze from these
brief letters an interpretation neatly suited to their thesis or
political bias.</p>
<p>For many, a chief starting point has been to emphasize the often
awkward grammatical structure of the letters—an archaic floridness on
the part of Emir Hussein, a carefully calculated obtuseness on the part
of Henry McMahon—to suggest that radically divergent interpretations can
be drawn, and that no deliberate deception was committed by the British.
Indeed, by focusing on McMahon’s carefully inserted modifiers, a number
of historians, most notably Isaiah Friedman, Elie Kedourie, and David
Fromkin, have put forward the assertion that the British didn’t actually
promise Hussein anything at all. Without such a promise, so this line of
argument goes, Britain was at perfect liberty to enter into its
subsequent compact on the Middle East with its European allies through
the so-called Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>This argument, however, falters under the weight of both common sense
and contemporary evidence. For any impartial observer supplied with a
map of the region and the few minutes necessary to read the full
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, it becomes manifestly obvious just what
Emir Hussein believed he was agreeing to. What’s more, the actions of
the British government at the time make clear that it too believed
promises had been made to Hussein, and that those promises were undercut
by Sykes-Picot. That is evidenced by their zealous efforts to keep the
Sykes-Picot Agreement a secret from Hussein for nearly two years, a
conspiracy of silence that undoubtedly would have continued if the
agreement’s existence hadn’t been revealed by Russia’s Bolshevik
government.</p>
<p>4 That estimate was initially: Sykes to Cox, undated but late
November 1915; PRO-FO 882/2.</p>
<p>5 It was not a pretty: Sykes to General E. C. Callwell, Director of
Military Operations, War Office, August 2, 1915; PRO-FO 882/13,
f. 367–71.</p>
<p>6 “the imaginative advocate”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 58.</p>
<p>7 “aptitude for treason”: Prüfer to Djemal Pasha, December 5, 1915;
PAAA, Roll 21138, Der Weltkrieg no. 11g, Band 16.</p>
<p>8 “At the slightest indiscretion”: Metternich to Bethmann-Hollweg,
December 23, 1915; PAAA, Roll 21138, Der Weltkrieg no. 11g, Band 16.</p>
<p>9 Sarah fainted away: Aaronsohn, “Addendum to ‘Report of an
inhabitant of Athlit, Mount Carmel, Syria,’” undated but November 1916;
PRO-FO 371/2783.</p>
<p>10 The one precondition: Engle, The Nili Spies, pp. 62–64; Florence,
Lawrence and Aaronsohn, p. 205. Engle, Florence, and other Aaronsohn
biographers have rendered this incident in rather more dire terms,
alleging that Feinberg was tortured in Beersheva and faced imminent
threat of execution in Jerusalem. Aaronsohn’s diary for the period would
seem to contradict this, however, considering that he noted learning of
Feinberg’s detention from a telegram Feinberg himself sent from
Beersheva on December 29. Further, Aaronsohn’s subsequent diary entries
indicate little sense of urgency in resolving Feinberg’s predicament,
nor does the fact that Aaronsohn waited for two weeks after learning of
it to make his appeal to Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>11 It wasn’t until a reply: Chamberlain to Hardinge, October 22,
1915; PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 254.</p>
<p>12 In other words: The French “escape clause” in McMahon’s October 24
letter to Hussein was carefully constructed at the senior levels of the
British government, as evidenced by correspondence between McMahon and
the Foreign Office in PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 204–8.</p>
<p>13 That the French: Tanenbaum, France and the Arab Middle East,
p. 8.</p>
<p>14 British officials expressed: “Results of second meeting of
Committee to discuss Arab question and Syria,” November 23, 1915; PRO-FO
882/2, f. 156–60.</p>
<p>15 Rather than be part: Sykes and Picot joint memorandum, “Arab
Question,” January 5, 1916; PRO-FO 371/2767. Of all the controversies
that continue to surround the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, perhaps
the most specious is the assertion that the territory of Palestine was
specifically excluded from the proposed independent Arab nation, and
that Hussein was fully aware of this. The chief proponent of this
assertion has been Isaiah Friedman in his frequently cited books The
Question of Palestine and Palestine: A Twice-Promised Land?, with his
claims echoed by Fromkin in A Peace to End All Peace.</p>
<p>The foundation for this assertion rests with one of the
“modifications” McMahon proposed in his crucial letter of October 24,
1915, to Hussein, in which he wrote that the “portions of Syria lying to
the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be
said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded
[for an independent Arab nation].” With that as a starting point,
Friedman goes on to list the many opportunities Hussein had after
October 24 to raise an objection to the exclusion of Palestine, but
consistently failed to do so. As he writes in The Question of Palestine
(p. 90), “On receipt of McMahon’s letter of 24 October, Hussein argued
that Mesopotamia and the vilayets of Beirut and Aleppo ‘are Arab and
should therefore be under Muslim Government,’ though significantly he
refrained from placing Palestine in the same category. Again on 1
January 1916 he reminded the High Commissioner that after the conclusion
of the war he would claim ‘Beirut and its coastal regions’ but made no
mention of the sanjak of Jerusalem.” From such omissions on Hussein’s
part, Friedman concludes, Hussein had clearly tacitly ceded control of
Palestine in his dialogue with McMahon.</p>
<p>Except the first problem with this thesis is that no portion of
Palestine lies “to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and
Aleppo.” Instead, that designation corresponds roughly—roughly because
it’s unclear exactly what McMahon meant by “districts”—to modern-day
Lebanon and the coastal areas of modern-day Syria; Palestine/Israel lies
well to the south. An even larger problem is that, over the course of
his correspondence with Hussein, McMahon carefully specified each region
that he was seeking “modifications” for, and at no time did he ever
mention Palestine. As for why Hussein himself never raised the issue of
Palestine with McMahon, Friedman and other proponents of this thesis
seem determined to avoid the most obvious explanation: since Palestine
fell outside of the exclusion zone McMahon had described, and since
McMahon had never included it in his “modifications,” there was simply
nothing to discuss?</p>
<p>16 As T. E. Lawrence: Lawrence to Liddell Hart, notes from interview,
undated; UT, Folder 1, File 1.</p>
<p>17 “if properly handled”: Lawrence, “The Politics of Mecca,”
forwarded by McMahon to Grey, February 7, 1916; PRO-FO 371/2771,
f. 151–56.</p>
<p>18 “essentially a trivial”: As quoted in Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia,
p. 249.</p>
<p>19 “with all the narrow minded”: Ibid.</p>
<p>20 “and if it prevailed”: Lawrence, “The Politics of Mecca,” p. 1;
PRO-FO 371/2771, f. 152.</p>
<p>21 the 36th Indian Infantry Brigade: Millar, Death of an Army,
pp. 204–5.</p>
<p>22 army of twelve thousand: There is a considerable disparity in
historical sources over the size of the Kut garrison, with numbers
ranging between nine and twelve thousand. This disparity is explained by
the inclusion or omission of so-called camp followers the estimates—the
number of actual soldiers was closer to the lower estimate—but since the
camp followers would share in their grim fate, it seems appropriate to
include them.</p>
<p>23 Perhaps in recognition of his uneven achievements: For details on
the battle of Dujaila, and Aylmer’s actions, see PRO-WO 158/668,
f. 75–127.</p>
<p>24 “My dear Cox”: McMahon to Cox, March 20, 1916, as quoted by
Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia, p. 259.</p>
<p>25 after the war: A. W. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence by his Friends (1937
edition), p. 301.</p>
<p>26 “undesirable and inconvenient”: Lake to Secretary of State
(India), March 30, 1916; PRO-FO 371/2768, f. 36.</p>
<p>27 “My general information”: Robertson to Lake, March 16, 1916;
PRO-WO 158/669, no. 197.</p>
<p>28 It had all the trappings: William Yale’s account of life in
wartime Jerusalem is largely drawn from Yale, It Takes So Long, chapters
4 and 5.</p>
<p>29 despite “his harmless appearance”: Ballobar, Jerusalem in World
War I, p. 75.</p>
<p>30 “[Djemal] says”: Edelman to Socony, Constantinople, March 29,
1916; NARA RG 84, Entry 350, Volume 30, Decimal 300—general.</p>
<p>31 “I studied his face”: Yale, It Takes So Long, chapter 5,
pp. 7–8.</p>
<p>32 “At a dance”: Herbert, Mons, Kut and Anzac, p. 232.</p>
<p>33 “Townshend’s guns”: Herbert diary, as quoted by Wilson, Lawrence,
p. 272. In the published version (Herbert: Mons, Kut and Anzac, p. 228),
the sentence was changed to “We have got very little to bargain with as
far as the Turks are concerned, practically only the exchange of
prisoners.”</p>
<p>34 “Perhaps one of our [Turkish] men”: Herbert, Mons, Kut and Anzac,
p. 234.</p>
<p>35 “they gave us a most excellent dinner”: Lawrence, The Home
Letters, p. 324.</p>
<p>36 With most put to work: While postwar British governments were
meticulous in tabulating the number of British soldiers at Kut who had
died in captivity—1755 out of 2592, according to Crowley (Kut 1916,
p. 253)—they were far less with their Indian counterparts, or even in
repatriating those who had survived. According to Millar (Death of an
Army, p. 284), Indian survivors of Kut continued to show up in their
native villages, having somehow managed their own passage home, as late
as 1924.</p>
<p>37 In a testament to the element: Nash, Chitral Charlie,
pp. 274–79.</p>
<p>38 “Effendim”: Djemal Pasha, Memories of a Turkish Statesman,
p. 216.</p>
<p>39 “I should also draw”: Ibid., pp. 216–17.</p>
<p>40 “By brute force”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 59.</p>
<p>41 “British generals”: Ibid., p. 386.</p>
<p>42 “We pay for”: Ibid., p. 25.</p>
<p>43 So thoroughly did the censors: This is to be found in the Wingate
Papers at Durham University, in File W/137/7.</p>
<p>44 It was the signal: Baker, King Husain and the Kingdom of Hejaz,
pp. 98–99. Baker gives the revolt start date as June 10.</p>
