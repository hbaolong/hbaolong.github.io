<h4 id="chapter-2-a-very-unusual-type">Chapter 2 A Very Unusual
Type</h4>
<p>Can you make room on your excavations next winter for a young Oxford
graduate, T. Lawrence, who has been with me at Carchemish? He is a very
unusual type, and a man whom I feel quite sure you would approve of and
like.… I may add that he is extremely indifferent to what he eats or how
he lives.</p>
<p>DAVID HOGARTH TO EGYPTOLOGIST FLINDERS PETRIE, 1911</p>
<p>I think it time I dedicated a letter to you,” Thomas Edward Lawrence
wrote his father on August 20, 1906, “although it does not make the
least difference in style, since all my letters are equally bare of
personal information. The buildings I try to describe will last longer
than we will, so it is only fitting that they should have the greater
space.”</p>
<p>True to his word, Lawrence spent the rest of that letter imparting
absolutely no information about himself, not even bothering to mention
how he had spent his eighteenth birthday four days earlier. Instead, he
used the space to describe in minute detail the structural peculiarities
of a fourteenth-century castle he had just visited.</p>
<p>Lawrence, on recess from the Oxford High School for Boys, was
spending that summer bicycling through northwestern France. The bicycle
had only recently become widely available to the European general
public, a result of design innovations and mass production, and it had
sparked something of a craze among the British middle class for cycling
tours of the European countryside. Lawrence’s trip was on a wholly
different scale, however: a nearly thousand-mile trek that took him to
most every notable castle and cathedral in the Normandy region.</p>
<p>The notes he took of these places formed the basis of Lawrence’s
letters to his family back in Oxford. While he often prefaced them with
brief expressions of concern for his mother’s purportedly frail health,
the chief characteristic of most of his correspondence was its utter
impersonality, the same disquisitional tone as adopted in that to his
father.</p>
<p>In some respects, this element of emotional constriction was probably
not unusual for a member of a British middle-class family at the end of
the Victorian age. It may have been heightened in the Lawrence household
by its male preponderance—a family of five boys and no girls—but this
was a segment of society that prized self-control and understatement,
where children were expected to be studious and respectful, and where a
parent’s greatest gift to those children was not an indulgent affection
but rather a sober religious grounding and a good education. It was also
a segment of society that held to a simple and comfortable worldview.
While radical political ideas were starting to find flower among the
working class, the British middle class still adhered to a social
hierarchy based less on attained wealth than on ancestry and accent, a
caste system that rigidly dictated nearly every aspect of social life—in
some respects, even more rigidly than a half century before. If
stultifying, this stratification also meant that everyone knew his
place, the station in life to which he might reasonably aspire. To the
degree possible, social and economic advancement was obtained through
the “godly virtues” of modesty, self-reliance, diligence, and
thrift.</p>
<p>Perhaps the least questioned tenet of the time was the notion that
the British Empire now stood at the very apex of modern civilization,
and that it was the special burden of this empire to spread its
enlightenment—whether through commerce, the Bible, the gun, or some
combination of all three—to the world’s less fortunate cultures and
races. While this conviction extended to all segments of British
society, it had special resonance for the middle class, since it was
from precisely this social stratum that the chief custodians of
empire—its midlevel military field officers and colonial
administrators—were drawn. This, too, undoubtedly contributed to an
emotional distance in such families; from the time of their children’s
birth, parents had to steel themselves to the likelihood that some of
their offspring, especially the males, might ship out to a remote
outpost of empire, not to be seen again for decades, if ever.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the British middle-class
generation coming of age in the early 1900s was marked by a certain
blitheness, so much so that in recalling their growing up many years
later, one of Lawrence’s brothers could write without a hint of irony,
“We had a very happy childhood, which was never marred by a single
quarrel between any of us.”</p>
<p>But in at least one respect, there was something altogether unusual
about the Lawrence family on Oxford’s Polstead Road, and it undoubtedly
added to the emotional austerity in that household. Quite unbeknownst to
the neighbors and to most of their own children, Thomas and Sarah
Lawrence were harboring a scandalous secret: they were essentially
living as fugitives. The key to that secret began with the family
surname, which wasn’t really Lawrence.</p>
<p>Thomas Lawrence’s real name was Thomas Robert Tighe Chapman, and in
his prior incarnation he had been a prominent member of the Anglo-Irish
landed aristocracy. After being educated at Eton, the future baronet had
returned to Ireland and, in the early 1870s, took up the pleasant role
of gentleman farmer of his family’s estate in County Westmeath. He
married a woman from another wealthy Anglo-Irish family, with whom he
soon had four daughters.</p>
<p>But Chapman’s gilded existence began to unravel when he started an
affair with the governess to his young daughters, a twenty-four-year-old
Scottish woman named Sarah Junner. By the time Chapman’s wife learned of
the affair in early 1888, Sarah already had one child with Thomas—an
infant son secreted in a rented apartment in Dublin—and a second was on
the way. Refused a divorce by his wife, the aristocrat was forced to
choose between his two families.</p>
<p>Given the laws and moral strictures of the Victorian era, the
consequences of that choice could hardly have been more profound. If he
opted to stay with Sarah Junner, Thomas Chapman would not only be
stripped of most of his family inheritance, but his four daughters would
have great difficulty ever marrying due to the taint of family scandal.
Worse was what would lie in store for his and Sarah’s offspring. As
illegitimates, they would be effectively barred from many of the better
schools and higher professions that, had they been legally born to the
Chapman name, would be their birthright. Certainly, the most prudent
course was for Thomas to bundle Sarah back to her native Scotland with a
supporting stipend for herself and her children, a rather common
arrangement of the day when servant girls got “into trouble” with their
masters. Instead, Chapman chose to stay with Sarah.</p>
<p>After renouncing his claim to the family fortune in favor of his
younger brother, Thomas left Ireland with Sarah in mid-1888 for the
anonymity of a small village in northern Wales called Tremadoc. There,
the couple assumed the alias of Sarah’s mother’s maiden name, Lawrence,
and in August of that year Sarah gave birth to their second child, a son
they named Thomas Edward.</p>
<p>But Wales brought the couple no peace of mind. Getting by on a modest
annuity from the Chapman family estate but living in constant fear that
they might one day encounter someone who knew them from their former
lives, the Lawrences began a furtive, peripatetic existence: Tremadoc
was soon given up for an even more remote village in northern Scotland,
then it was on to the Isle of Man, followed by a couple of years in a
small French town, followed by two more years in a secluded hunting
lodge on the south coast of England. Compounding the isolation in these
places—in each, the Lawrences rented homes on village outskirts or
surrounded by high stone walls—Thomas severed ties to nearly all his
former friends, while Sarah rarely left the security and anonymity of
the family home.</p>
<p>“You can imagine how your mother and I have suffered all these
years,” Thomas Lawrence would confide in a posthumous letter to his
sons, “not knowing what day we might be recognized by some one and our
sad history published far and wide.”</p>
<p>In light of this driving fear, the Lawrences’ decision to move to
Oxford in 1896 must have been a downright harrowing one. For the first
time, the couple would not only be living in the center of a large town
but, given Thomas’s aristocratic and educational background, in a place
where it was very likely they would cross paths with someone from their
past. But against this was the opportunity for their sons—now grown to
four in number, with a fifth on the way—to receive a good education,
maybe even to ultimately win admission to Oxford University, and so the
Lawrences took the gamble. The price for this heightened exposure,
however, was a family drawn even tighter into itself, the boys’ lives
circumscribed in comparison to those of their classmates, but for
reasons those boys couldn’t begin to fathom. All except Thomas Edward,
that is. With the move to Oxford, the eight-year-old was now settling
into the sixth home of his young life, and at some point during his
first years at Polstead Road he partially unraveled the family secret.
He kept the information to himself, however, never confronting his
parents nor confiding in any of his brothers.</p>
<p>At the Oxford High School for Boys, Lawrence was known as an
exceptionally bright but quiet student, one for whom team sports held no
appeal and who, if not engaged in a solitary pursuit, preferred the
company of his brothers or just a very small group of close friends. His
bookish side—he had been a voracious reader even as a young child—was
offset by a love of bicycle riding and a fondness for practical jokes.
But there was something else as well. By early adolescence, “Ned,” as he
was known to family and friends, had developed the habit of constantly
testing the limits of his endurance, whether in how far or fast he could
bicycle or how long he could go without food or sleep or water. This
wasn’t the usual stuff of boyhood self-testing, but protracted ordeals
that, through a kind of iron will, Ned could sustain to the point of
collapse. So pronounced was this tendency that even his headmaster in
the fourth form (equivalent to American eighth grade) took notice: “He
was unlike the boys of his time,” Henry Hall wrote in a remembrance of
Lawrence, “for even in his schooldays he had a strong leaning toward the
Stoics, an apparent indifference towards pleasure or pain.”</p>
<p>Some of this may have stemmed from an increasingly severe home
environment. As the Lawrence boys grew older, Sarah, the disciplinarian
of the family, became both more religious and more given to physical
punishment. These were not mere spankings, but rather protracted
whippings with belts and switches, and in the remembrance of the
Lawrence boys, Ned was by far her most frequent target. It established a
disturbing pattern between mother and son. That Ned made a point of
never crying or asking for leniency during these whippings—to the
contrary, he seemed to derive satisfaction from his ability to display
no emotion whatsoever—often had the effect of making the punishments
worse, so much so that on several occasions the normally cowed Thomas
Lawrence intervened to put a stop to them.</p>
<p>At around the age of fifteen, Ned abruptly stopped growing. With his
brothers all eventually surpassing him in height, he became acutely
aware of his shortness—variously pegged at between five foot three and
five foot five—and this seemed to deepen an already pronounced shyness.
About the same time, he developed a fascination with the tales of
medieval knights, and with archaeology. He began taking long bicycle
trips to churches in the English countryside, where he would conduct
brass rubbings of memorial plaques. With his best friend of the time, he
scoured the construction sites of new buildings going up in Oxford in
search of old relics, and came upon a good number of them. These finds,
mostly glass and pottery shards from the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, soon led Ned to the Ashmolean Museum in central Oxford.</p>
<p>With the distinction of being the oldest public museum in Britain,
and with an emphasis on charting the confluence of Eastern and Western
cultures, the Ashmolean was to play a transformative role in Lawrence’s
life. Encouraged by its curators to whom he brought his construction
site finds, the teenager soon became a familiar figure around the
museum, dropping in after school, helping with odd chores on the
weekends. For Lawrence, the Ashmolean became a window onto the world
that lay beyond Oxford, its artifacts giving physicality to all the
places and civilizations he constantly read about. Testament to his
fascination with the past, as well as his already fierce streak of
self-sufficiency, was that extended bicycle tour of the castles and
cathedrals of Normandy in the summer of 1906.</p>
<p>Earning high marks at high school, in the autumn of 1907 Lawrence was
admitted to Jesus College of Oxford University, there to specialize in
history. With an abiding interest in both military history and the
Middle Ages, he fashioned a thesis focusing on the architecture of
medieval castles and fortifications. To that end, for the summer of 1908
recess, he plotted a journey that dwarfed his earlier excursion to
Normandy, an elaborate twenty-four-hundred-mile bicycle trek that would
take him to nearly every significant such structure across the breadth
of France. Staying in cheap pensions, or camping in the rough, he
routinely pedaled more than a hundred miles a day as he went from one
ancient castle or battlement to the next. At each, he took photographs,
made sketches, and wrote up exhaustive notes before getting back on his
bicycle and pedaling on.</p>
<p>Initially, his letters back to Polstead Road assumed the same dry,
even tedious tone of those from his earlier travels. But then something
changed. It happened on August 2, 1908, when Lawrence reached the
village of Aigues-Mortes and he saw the Mediterranean Sea for the first
time. In the letter home describing that day, Lawrence displayed an
exuberance and sense of wonder that was quite out of character.</p>
<p>“I bathed today in the sea,” he wrote, “the great sea, the greatest
in the world; you can imagine my feelings.… I felt that at last I had
reached the way to the South, and all the glorious East—Greece,
Carthage, Egypt, Tyre, Syria, Italy, Spain, Sicily, Crete—they were all
there, and all within reach of me.… Oh I must get down here—farther
out—again! Really this getting to the sea has almost overturned my
mental balance; I would accept a passage for Greece tomorrow.”</p>
<p>It was almost as if he were describing a religious epiphany. In a
way, he was.</p>
<p>When Lawrence returned to Oxford and his studies that autumn, he
began to hatch a new—and infinitely more ambitious—journey, one that
would take him to the furthermost region of those he had contemplated
that day in Aigues-Mortes. Among the first to hear of this new scheme
was a man named David Hogarth.</p>
<p>A noted archaeologist who had worked and traveled extensively in the
Near East, Hogarth had only recently taken up the position of director,
or keeper, of the Ashmolean Museum. From the Ashmolean’s assistant
curators he had undoubtedly heard mention of T. E. Lawrence—that the shy
Oxford student had been a fixture around the museum since his early
teens, that he showed a keen curiosity in archaeological work—but this
did not at all prepare Hogarth for the diminutive figure ushered into
his office one day in January 1909.</p>
<p>After his tour of the castles in France, Lawrence had now radically
expanded the idea for his senior thesis at Oxford. Put simply, there
just wasn’t much new to be said or discovered by examining European
medieval fortifications in isolation, whereas one of the enduring
mysteries in the study of military architecture was the degree to which
innovations in medieval battlements were of Western or Eastern origin:
had the Christian Crusaders learned from their Muslim enemies while
invading the Holy Land, or had the Muslims copied from the Crusaders? As
Lawrence explained to Hogarth, what he proposed was a comprehensive
survey of the Crusader castles of the Syrian Near East—and, in typical
Lawrence fashion, not merely a visit to some of the more notable ones,
but a tour of practically all of them. Lawrence planned to make this
trek during the next Oxford summer recess, and alone.</p>
<p>Hogarth, already thrown by Lawrence’s modest stature—he was now
twenty but could easily pass for fifteen—was aghast at the plan. The
expedition Lawrence proposed meant a journey of well over a thousand
miles across deserts and rugged mountain ranges, where whatever roads
and trails existed had only deteriorated since Roman times. What’s more,
summer was the absolute worst time to travel in Syria, a season when
temperatures routinely reached 120 degrees in the interior. As Hogarth
recounted the conversation to a Lawrence biographer, when he tried to
diplomatically raise these issues, he was met with a steely resolve.</p>
<p>“I’m going,” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“Well, have you got the money?” Hogarth asked. “You’ll want a guide
and servants to carry your tent and baggage.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to walk.”</p>
<p>The scheme was becoming more preposterous all the time. “Europeans
don’t walk in Syria,” Hogarth explained. “It isn’t safe or
pleasant.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Lawrence said, “I do.”</p>
<p>Startled by the young man’s brusque determination, Hogarth implored
him to at least seek the counsel of a true expert. This was Charles
Montagu Doughty, an explorer who had traversed much of the region
Lawrence proposed to visit, and whose book Travels in Arabia Deserta was
considered the definitive travelogue of the time. When contacted,
Doughty was even more dismissive of the plan than Hogarth.</p>
<p>“In July and August the heat is very severe by day and night,” he
wrote Lawrence, “even at the altitude of Damascus (over 2,000 feet). It
is a land of squalor, where a European can find little refreshment. Long
daily marches on foot a prudent man who knows the country would, I
think, consider out of the question. The populations only know their own
wretched life and look upon any European wandering in their country with
at best a veiled ill will.”</p>
<p>In case he hadn’t sufficiently made his point, Doughty continued,
“The distances to be traversed are very great. You would have nothing to
draw upon but the slight margin of strength which you bring with you
from Europe. Insufficient food, rest and sleep would soon begin to
tell.”</p>
<p>Such counsel might have dissuaded most people, but not Lawrence. For
a young man already driven to test the very limits of his endurance,
Doughty’s letter read like a dare.</p>
<p>HE CERTAINLY LOOKED the part. With his bull shoulders, calloused
hands, and Teddy Roosevelt handlebar mustache, William Yale, the new
engineering level-man hired on to work the Culebra Cut in the summer of
1908, blended right in with the tens of thousands of other workers who
had descended upon the jungles of Central America. They had come to take
part in the most ambitious construction project in the history of
mankind, the building of the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Few of his coworkers might have guessed that in fact William Yale had
no engineering background at all; instead, he had obtained the position
of level-man, and the premium salary it garnered, through the efforts of
a well-connected college friend. Surely even fewer might have guessed
that the twenty-one-year-old—by all accounts a tireless and
uncomplaining worker—was operating in an environment utterly alien to
him, that as a scion of one of America’s wealthiest and most illustrious
families he had until very recently lived a life of privilege
extraordinary even by the excessive standards of the day. To the
American archetype of the self-made man, William Yale represented the
dark and polar opposite, one born to tremendous advantage but who had
lost it all in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Dating their arrival in America to the mid-1600s, the Yales of New
England were a quintessential Yankee blueblood family, one that for 250
years had built an ever greater fortune through shipping, manufacturing,
and exploiting all the riches the New World had to offer. True to their
Presbyterian ethos, the Yales were also a family that believed in good
works and education; in 1701, Elihu Yale, William’s great-great-uncle,
helped found the university in New Haven that still bears the family
name.</p>
<p>Born in 1887, William certainly appeared destined to live in the
familial tradition. The third son of William Henry Yale, an
industrialist and Wall Street speculator, he grew up on a four-acre
estate in Spuyten Duyvil, the bluff at the southwestern tip of the Bronx
in New York City. With its commanding views of both Manhattan and the
Hudson River, Spuyten Duyvil had long been favored by New York’s moneyed
class seeking to escape the noise and grime of the city, and the Yale
estate was among the grandest. Through early childhood, William and his
siblings, four brothers and two sisters, were educated by private tutors
at the family mansion, took dance and social etiquette classes at
Dodsworth’s, Manhattan’s preeminent dancing academy, and spent summers
at the family’s vast forested estate in the Black River valley of
upstate New York. Like his two older brothers before him, for high
school William was shipped off to the prestigious Lawrenceville School
outside Princeton.</p>
<p>But even from an early age, the Yale boys probably had broader
horizons than most other male offspring of the New York pampered set.
This was due to their father. Beyond being an ardent political supporter
of Teddy Roosevelt—the Yales fit squarely into the progressive
Republican mold—William Henry Yale also subscribed to Roosevelt’s
notions of the ideal American man and of the dangers of
“over-civilization,” code for effeminacy. The true man, in this
worldview, was a rugged individualist, physically fit as well as
intellectually cultured, as equally at home leading men into battle or
shooting big game on the prairie as chatting with the ladies in the
salon. To this end, William Henry frequently took his sons on extended
trips into the American wilderness and ensured that they were just as
adept at hunting, fishing, and trapping as in displaying the proper
manners at a Spuyten Duyvil garden party.</p>
<p>The “Roosevelt Man” paradigm seemed to take especially firm root in
his namesake third son. During his summer break from Lawrenceville in
1902, fourteen-year-old William traveled with his father to Cuba to see
the sights of the island, recently “liberated” from Spain, as well as to
visit the family’s newly acquired copper mines. Rather than immediately
entering Yale University after high school—and there was never any
question of which university all Yale boys would attend—William took a
year off, and spent part of that time accompanying a wealthy friend and
his family on a grand tour of the American West aboard their private
railcar.</p>
<p>But much like T. E. Lawrence, when William Yale contemplated
adulthood, he already regarded the conventional path so clearly
delineated for him with an element of dread. “The routine life I had
seen other young men take up seemed tasteless and meaningless,” he would
later write. “The thought of doing over and over again the same thing
day after day, year after year was maddening to me. How others lived in
the same town they grew up, married girls they had known all their
lives, lived in the houses their families owned, went down, day in and
day out, to their father’s businesses, I could not understand.”</p>
<p>Then the dilemma was settled for him. In October 1907, a panic on
Wall Street sparked a nationwide run on banks and nearly halved the
value of the New York Stock Exchange in a matter of days. Among the
hardest hit by the panic was the heavily leveraged William Henry Yale,
whose enormous fortune was virtually wiped out. When William came home
that Christmas, having just started his freshman year at Yale, his
father delivered almost unimaginable news: the nineteen-year-old student
would now have to work to help cover his educational expenses; he was
essentially on his own.</p>
<p>William’s reaction to this news was mixed: shock, understandably, at
the abrupt end to his privileged existence, but a shock leavened by a
sense of liberation. Here was the chance to pursue the adventurous life
he dreamed of. That summer, he took a leave from the university and
shipped out to Panama.</p>
<p>That six-month sojourn in Central America proved a transformative
experience. Instead of heirs and socialites, Yale’s companions now were
a motley and licentious crew of international adventurers and
construction vagabonds, rough-cut men who taught the fallen aristocrat
how to work and how to drink; by Yale’s own account, it was only his
mother’s puritanical indoctrination that enabled him to withstand the
determined appeals of the female professionals at the Navajo Bar in
Panama City and escape with his chastity intact.</p>
<p>But if Panama opened a door, it was still a daunting one to step
through. Upon returning to New Haven and completing his degree, William
Yale found himself in a quandary. “The bottom had dropped out of my
world. To ever get to where I could marry and live the life I was
brought up to expect seemed utterly hopeless. I hadn’t the foggiest idea
how to make money.… What to do now? I was penniless, in debt, and knew
nothing of the world, and at heart was intimidated by it.”</p>
<p>He would eventually find an answer to that question. It would take
the form of a notice soliciting applicants to the “foreign service
school” of the Standard Oil Company of New York.</p>
<p>ANYONE WHO HAPPENED to be crossing the searingly hot plain west of
Aleppo in northern Syria in early September 1909 would have encountered
a perplexing sight: a young, painfully thin Englishman, a rucksack slung
over his shoulders, tromping along while close on his heels trailed a
squadron of Turkish cavalry.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, T. E. Lawrence had arrived in the remote foothill
town of Sahyun, there to quietly survey yet another Crusader castle, and
the local Ottoman provincial governor, or kaimmakam, had been so amazed
at the sight of the young traveler that he insisted on treating Lawrence
as a visiting dignitary. That meant staying in the governor’s home and
being lavishly waited upon, and it had also meant a personal bodyguard
of cavalrymen when Lawrence set out for the five-day hike to Aleppo.</p>
<p>“It is rather amusing to contemplate a pedestrian guarded carefully
by a troop of light horse [cavalry],” he wrote his family in describing
the incident. “Of course everybody thinks I am mad to walk, and the
escort offered me a mount on the average [of] once a half-hour; they
couldn’t understand my prejudice against anything with four legs.”</p>
<p>Lawrence’s walking tour of Syria that summer was comprised of two
journeys. The first began in the coastal city of Beirut and consisted of
a three-week jaunt south through the mountains of Lebanon to northern
Palestine. After returning to Beirut and resting for a few days, he
embarked on a far more elaborate and punishing trek north.</p>
<p>It was an adventure that changed his life. Everywhere the locals
greeted him with both astonishment and overwhelming generosity. In
village after village, residents would insist he eat with them, or stay
the night as their guest, and despite their crushing poverty, very few
would ever accept payment. “This is a glorious country for wandering
in,” he wrote his father in mid-August, “for hospitality is something
more than a name.”</p>
<p>His letters home conveyed a newfound happiness. In one letter to his
mother at the end of August, he sounded like the modern college student
who fancies that his travels have left him fundamentally transformed: “I
will have such difficulty in becoming English again.”</p>
<p>The difference in Lawrence’s case was that this was to actually prove
true.</p>
<p>Once back in Oxford for his senior year, Lawrence toiled on his
thesis in the pleasant cottage his father had built for him in the
garden of the Polstead Road home. The result carried the accurate if not
exactly beckoning title The Influence of the Crusades on European
Military Architecture—to the End of the XIIth Century.</p>
<p>The Oxford history department examiners were impressed enough by his
original research—then, as now, most theses tended to be compendiums of
others’ work—that Lawrence was awarded first-class honors, the highest
scholastic ranking and one of only ten such awards given by the history
school that year. The distinction greatly enhanced his chances of
pursuing an academic career, his newfound goal, and this was further
helped along when the university arranged a stipend for him to conduct
postgraduate work. Perhaps stemming from his teenaged archaeological
finds in the Oxford construction sites, Lawrence had long had a special
attraction to pottery, and it was to this he turned in his postgraduate
research. To be sure, studying “Medieval Lead-Glazed Pottery from the
11th to the 16th Centuries” sounded a lot less exciting than tramping
about Syria, but it was a first step toward the life he envisioned for
himself.</p>
<p>But it was not to be. In the autumn of 1910, just days after arriving
in France to begin his pottery research, Lawrence learned that David
Hogarth was about to leave for northern Syria, there to oversee the
inauguration of an archaeological dig for the British Museum at the
ancient ruins of Carchemish. Abandoning France, Lawrence hurried back to
Oxford to try to convince Hogarth to take him along.</p>
<p>HE WAS A small, sickly child born into a pitiless family. Even before
reaching adolescence, Curt Prüfer, the only son of a Berlin
schoolteacher, had suffered through a litany of ailments that included
tuberculosis, kidney disease, and diphtheria. It was a failed treatment
for this last affliction that left him with his soft, feathery
voice.</p>
<p>The boy’s frail health apparently did little to pull at the
heartstrings of his parents, Carl and Agnes Prüfer. The father
constantly criticized Curt for his purported laziness, while his mother
rarely showed him affection or even attention. The emotional isolation
didn’t end there. According to Prüfer biographer Donald McKale, Curt had
no childhood friends, and his sole bond of attachment throughout growing
up was to his one sibling, a sister several years his senior. Tellingly,
considering the schoolyard taunts he undoubtedly suffered due to his
voice, the adult Curt Prüfer’s favorite insult, one he would direct at
entire nationalities and even his own married son, was the label of
homosexual.</p>
<p>But in contrast to the spiritual poverty of his home life, Prüfer had
been born into a fantastically exciting and tumultuous period in German
history. In 1871, just ten years before his birth, Otto von Bismarck had
capitalized on Prussia’s crushing victory over France in the
Franco-Prussian War to tear up the centuries-old patchwork of German
principalities and duchies and forge the modern German nation.</p>
<p>Under a state-directed corporatist structure, Germany swiftly went
from a primarily agrarian economy to being one of the most
industrialized nations on earth, linked from one end to the other by a
modern network of railroads, canals, and carriageways. A series of
workers’-rights legislations, as well as the world’s first national
social welfare system, sent fractures through what had been one of the
most rigidly class-stratified societies in Europe. Those fractures were
widened further by the state’s massive expansion of higher education.
Once almost solely the province of the very elite, university was now
accessible to the middle class, so much so that by the turn of the
century they comprised half of all college graduates.</p>
<p>Equally dramatic was the new image and prowess of Germany abroad.
From a dizzying mélange of squabbling fiefdoms—a mélange that Europe’s
established imperial powers had adroitly played off against one another
for centuries—Germany was suddenly becoming an empire in its own right.
Despite being a latecomer in the European “scramble for Africa,” by the
mid-1880s it had established colonies in western, southern, and eastern
Africa; in a fit of grandiosity, it even planted its flag in the South
Pacific island of Samoa, almost precisely the farthest spot from Germany
on the planet.</p>
<p>But if Bismarck created the modern German state, it was another man
who would truly catapult it onto the global stage, and fire the passions
of young Germans like Curt Prüfer in the process. In 1888, Wilhelm II,
the twenty-nine-year-old eldest grandchild of Queen Victoria of England,
ascended to the German throne. With a fondness for military uniforms and
bellicose language, as well as an undying resentment of the other
European royal families, the young kaiser was determined to make his
nation not just a regional power but a world one. This aggressiveness
was of limited concern in other European capitals so long as the true
levers of German authority lay in the steady hands of Chancellor
Bismarck—within the incestuous orbit of European royalty, Wilhelm had
long been pegged as an emotionally unstable but controllable hothead—but
of considerably greater concern when Wilhelm forced Bismarck from office
in 1890 and assumed autocratic powers. Absent the calming influence of
the Iron Chancellor, and surrounding himself with palace sycophants and
the Prussian military elite, Wilhelm nursed himself—and his subjects—on
a particularly toxic nationalist mythology rooted in both a sense of
victimization and superiority: that throughout history, Germany had been
denied its rightful “place in the sun” through the treachery of others,
that this colossal injustice was now to be remedied, through force of
arms if necessary.</p>
<p>For a boy like Curt Prüfer coming of age at this juncture, it could
almost be said that the new Germany created him. By the time he entered
secondary school in 1896, a new national curriculum had been introduced,
one that broke with the European classicist model in favor of one
preaching nationalist pride and the primacy of the state and the
emperor. It found a fervent disciple in the lonely, sickly boy from
Berlin. Soundly rejecting his father’s neosocialist liberalism, Curt
also rebelled against his parents’ narrow petit-bourgeois horizons, in
particular their desire that he follow in Carl Prüfer’s footsteps and
become a schoolteacher. Instead, this German “New Man”—exceptionally
bright and driven despite his father’s harsh estimation—imagined a
wholly different life for himself, and where he saw that life taking him
was east.</p>
<p>Part of that attraction may have stemmed from the political currents
of the day. Among all the jockeying European powers at the close of the
nineteenth century, there was a growing tendency to regard diplomacy as
a zero-sum game—any accord between one’s competitors translated as a
direct loss or threat to oneself—but nowhere was this tendency more
pronounced than in Wilhelm’s paranoia-tinged Germany. Throughout the
1890s, with growing signs of amity between France, Great Britain, and
Russia, an amity spurred in no small part by alarm over Germany’s rapid
militarization, talk of “encirclement” increasingly came into vogue in
Berlin. To escape this encirclement by its imperial rivals—France and
Great Britain to one side, Russia to the other—a boxed-in Germany needed
to look beyond for economic and political expansion, and the region
holding the greatest promise was the Ottoman and Muslim East. This
notion was greatly strengthened in 1898 when the kaiser made a
triumphant tour of the Ottoman world and was royally feted wherever he
went. For patriotic young Germans, the Near East was suddenly a
beckoning frontier.</p>
<p>But for Curt Prüfer, probably the greater attraction derived from the
exotic. At various times throughout the nineteenth century,
archaeological discoveries in the Near East had spawned intense
fascination among the European public, and probably nowhere had this
been more true than in Germany. Dating back to Karl Lepsius’s
expeditions to the Egyptian pyramids in the 1840s and continuing through
Heinrich Schliemann’s excavations of Troy and Mycenae in the 1870s,
German archaeologists had been at the forefront of exploration in the
region, and responsible for many of the greatest finds. By the 1880s,
with German scientists excavating burial tombs in the Luxor region of
Upper Egypt, and Adolf Erman breaking the codes of pharaonic
hieroglyphics at the University of Berlin, a new wave of popular
interest had ushered in the so-called golden age of Egyptology. The
craze captivated the young Prüfer much the way the dawning of the Space
Age would enthrall a later generation. Even as a very young boy, he
devoured the tales of adventure and discovery coming out of the Near
East, and dreamed of the circumstances that might take him there.</p>
<p>That may have remained the stuff of childhood fantasy if not for Curt
Prüfer’s possession of a singular talent, a somewhat curious one in
light of his speech difficulties. He was a prodigy when it came to
mastering foreign languages, one of those rare people who could go from
utter unfamiliarity to near fluency in a matter of months. He had
thoroughly mastered French and English in secondary school, but as a
young man he set his sights much further afield.</p>
<p>In partial acquiescence to his parents’ conventional aspirations, in
1901 the twenty-year-old Prüfer enrolled in the University of Berlin to
study law. At the same time, he took seminars in Oriental languages and
quickly developed a proficiency in Turkish and Arabic, two of the more
difficult languages on earth. Two years later, he dispensed with his
legal studies altogether and, under the pretext that a drier climate
might improve his frail health, moved to southern Italy to study
Italian.</p>
<p>But Italy was not the East, and in that same summer of 1903, Prüfer
set sail for Cairo. It was to be the first of three extended trips he
would make over the next three years, partially supporting himself by
writing travel articles for German cultural magazines as he worked
toward a doctorate in Oriental studies.</p>
<p>Perhaps spurred by his own commoner background, the area of study
Prüfer chose was a very unusual one for a European scholar of the time:
an indigenous theatrical art form known as shadow plays that catered
exclusively to the Egyptian working class. In his dissertation, he
described visiting one of the coffeehouses where these plays were
performed in the Was’a slum of Cairo.</p>
<p>“The galleries and benches on the main floor of this establishment
are packed with people, mostly from the lowest strata of society. Here,
donkey drivers, porters and pushcart vendors sit in a dense throng,
peacefully smoking their hashish pipes. Members of the upper classes do
not dare to enter the Was’a milieu for fear of damaging their good
reputations.”</p>
<p>The same held true for Cairo’s expatriate community, of course,
affording the young German scholar a glimpse into everyday Egyptian life
virtually unique among Europeans. The time he spent in places like Was’a
also enabled Prüfer to thoroughly master colloquial Arabic, a very
different language from that spoken by the genteel class, and a skill
that would stand him in very good stead in the years ahead.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1906, Prüfer stood at a kind of crossroads. With
his doctorate from the University of Erlangen in hand, he might easily
have landed a teaching position in Germany—and, in what would have been
a nice little turn of revenge, at a far more prestigious level than his
primary schoolteacher father had attained—but he was anxious to return
to the East. In rather quick succession, two strokes of luck were to
make that possible.</p>
<p>That winter, he met Frances Ethel Pinkham, an American woman studying
music in Berlin. A graduate of Wellesley College from a wealthy family
in Lynn, Massachusetts, the thirty-eight-year-old Pinkham was, by the
standards of the day, already well into spinsterhood when she met the
solicitous and charming Oriental scholar thirteen years her junior.
Following a brief romance, and over the fierce objections of Pinkham’s
parents, the couple married that April. Prüfer convinced his bride that
they should move to Egypt so that he could further his studies and,
hopefully, find suitable employment. While Pinkham’s parents back in
Lynn were no doubt aghast at the idea, in Cairo an opportunity for
adventure and advancement soon presented itself to their new
son-in-law.</p>
<p>During his previous stays in Cairo, Prüfer had frequently socialized
with personnel from the German embassy, and these diplomats had been
very impressed by his command of both classic and colloquial Arabic. In
early 1907, with the embassy’s current dragoman, or interpreter, slated
for retirement, Prüfer was asked if he might be interested in the post.
It’s hard to imagine he pondered the offer for more than an instant.
That February, Prüfer became the newest staff member of the German
diplomatic legation to Egypt.</p>
<p>But something else awaited the unprepossessing twenty-six-year-old at
the German embassy: a mentor, one of the most colorful—and in the eyes
of the British, one of the most dangerous—personalities ever to stalk
the Middle East.</p>
<p>THE RUINS OF Carchemish are situated on a rocky bluff over a bend of
the Euphrates River, flush on the border between modern-day Turkey and
Syria. Around it are rolling plains gradually giving over to grassy
foothills. Overlooking an important ford of the Euphrates, the bluff has
been inhabited for at least five thousand years, but achieved its
greatest prominence at about 1100 BC during the Late Bronze Age. At that
time, Carchemish was a principal city of the Hittite civilization,
centered in the Anatolia region just to the north, and was well known to
both the Egyptian pharaohs and the authors of the Old Testament; the
Bible contains several references to the city, including a battle waged
there between the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh Necho II in
the sixth century BC. This small corner of the Ottoman Empire was the
place where T. E. Lawrence came to feel a deeper sense of belonging than
anywhere else during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Having wheedled his way onto David Hogarth’s archaeological
expedition, Lawrence first reached Carchemish in February 1911. As the
junior assistant on the excavation, his official duties were to
photograph and sketch the dig as it progressed, as well as to keep a
catalog of its various finds. His job quickly expanded far beyond this.
As one of just two westerners permanently on-site to oversee a crew of
some two hundred local workmen (Hogarth, although the overall
administrator, would visit Carchemish only intermittently), Lawrence
soon came to be something akin to a construction foreman. In this role
he discovered, perhaps as much to his surprise as anyone else’s, that he
was a natural leader of men.</p>
<p>To be sure, this was partly due to his status as a European. Under a
system dating back to the 1500s known as the Capitulations, the European
powers had steadily wrung a series of ever more humiliating concessions
from the sultans in Constantinople under the pretext of protecting the
Ottoman Empire’s Christian minorities. By the beginning of the twentieth
century, European citizens were effectively exempt from Ottoman law.
“Really, this country, for the foreigner, is too glorious for words,”
Lawrence wrote to his family in the summer of 1912. “One is the baron of
the feudal system.”</p>
<p>But it was not merely this that made Lawrence a leader. He seemed to
possess an instant affinity for the East, and in that affinity an almost
instinctive appreciation for how its culture worked. By now quite fluent
in Arabic, in Carchemish he labored ceaselessly to deepen that
knowledge. He did so by quizzing the men in his work crews, by visiting
them in their homes, by taking painstaking notes on all he learned. From
their folkloric tales, to their views on politics, to charting out the
complicated clan structure that determined regional allegiances,
Lawrence gradually came to know this small corner of northern Syria and
its people better than probably any other European of the time.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing more endearing than attention. To the
extent that the workmen at Carchemish, drawn from the nearby town of
Jerablus, had ever had prior dealings with a westerner, it had
undoubtedly been of the most cursory and servile kind. They’d surely
never met one who bothered to learn the names of their children and
relatives and ancestors, who gladly accepted invitations into their
modest homes, who showed genuine respect for their rituals and
customs.</p>
<p>There was another aspect to Lawrence that impressed the locals as
well. He seemed to have none of the softness or frailty they associated
with Europeans; rather, he could work in the blazing heat for hours
without pause, could walk or ride for days without complaint, soldiered
through bouts of dysentery and malaria with the composed resignation of
a local. To the Arabs of Jerablus, most everything about Lawrence spoke
of a toughness, a stamina and an austerity, that made him seem less like
a European and more like themselves. In Arab tradition, they rewarded
that sense of kinship with a fierce and abiding loyalty. This cut both
ways, for the longer he stayed in Syria and the more he was accepted by
the locals, the less Lawrence came to think and act like a Briton.</p>
<p>More profoundly, his time in Syria caused him to fundamentally
rethink his views on the “civilizing influence” of the West. This change
found personification in the close relationship he developed with a
young man from Jerablus named Dahoum. Starting out as a mere
thirteen-year- old donkey boy at the Carchemish excavation site, the
bright and extraordinarily handsome Dahoum was soon elevated by Lawrence
to be a kind of personal assistant, and the two became inseparable,
leading to whispered rumors that they might be lovers. Whatever the
truth of those rumors, it was in the figure of Dahoum that Lawrence
began to develop a new if rather romanticized notion of the essential
nobility of the Arab race, admiring their asceticism as “the gospel of
bareness,” free from the taint of Western indulgence.</p>
<p>Writing his parents in 1911 from Jerablus, in a letter where he first
introduced Dahoum as “an interesting character” whom he wished to help,
he evinced views quite at odds with a British colonial sensibility:
“Fortunately there is no foreign influence as yet in the district. If
only you had seen the ruination caused by the French influence, and to a
lesser degree by the American, you would never wish it extended. The
perfectly hopeless vulgarity of the half-Europeanized Arab is appalling.
Better a thousand times the Arab untouched. The foreigners come out here
always to teach, whereas they had much better learn.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t a preoccupation one normally associated with an
archaeologist. Even David Hogarth, despite his great affection for his
protégé, was never convinced that Lawrence truly had the heart or
temperament of a scholar. He had little of the meticulous doggedness of
a man like Leonard Woolley, who in 1912 became the lead scientist at
Carchemish. Instead, Lawrence’s chief fascination seemed to be with the
land and the people that surrounded him; it was there where his passion
lay.</p>
<p>This passion also gave Lawrence a unique perspective on one of the
more momentous developments of the early twentieth century: the
protracted death throes of the Ottoman Empire. Most other Western
eyewitnesses to that spectacle resided in the cities of the Middle East.
Lawrence was one of the few who watched it play out in the countryside,
where the great majority of Ottoman subjects still lived.</p>
<p>That death had been a very long time foretold. The Ottoman Empire had
endured for nearly five centuries largely by allowing ethnic and
religious minorities extraordinary freedom to govern themselves, so long
as they paid their taxes and pledged ultimate allegiance to the sultans
in Constantinople. This system had begun to crumble in the nineteenth
century, buffeted by both the rise of nationalism and dramatic advances
in communications and commerce. With astonishing speed, the world was
becoming a smaller place, the industrializing nations of Europe were
becoming exponentially more powerful, and an empire built on what
essentially amounted to benign neglect of its component parts was an
anachronism. By the 1850s, the Ottoman Empire was already “the sick man
of Europe,” its final collapse eagerly anticipated by the ascendant
Western powers.</p>
<p>Through nimble alliance-making, the Ottomans had consistently managed
to dodge that demise, even as their Western competitors nibbled at the
empire’s edges. In the 1870s, czarist Russia crushed an Ottoman army in
the Balkans to win the independence of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro.
In 1881, France grabbed Tunisia. The following year, Great Britain used
the pretext of a nascent nationalist movement to snatch away Egypt.</p>
<p>Cruelly, the event that seemed to offer the Ottoman Empire its best
hope for a renaissance merely accelerated the disintegration. In 1908, a
reformist coup by a group of young military officers under the banner of
the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP)—soon to become better known as
the Young Turks—forced the despotic sultan to reinstate the
parliamentary constitution he had abrogated thirty years earlier.
Emboldened by their success, the Young Turks quickly launched a
breathtakingly ambitious campaign designed to drag the empire into the
twentieth century, including calls for the emancipation of women and the
granting of full rights of citizenship to ethnic and religious
minorities.</p>
<p>But if the CUP officers, most drawn from the European part of the
empire and steeped in European liberalism, had expected the Western
powers to embrace their cause, they were in for a rude surprise. Taking
advantage of the political confusion in Constantinople, Austria-Hungary
swiftly annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina. In other European capitals,
including London, the Young Turks were regarded with the deepest
suspicion, even derided as “crypto-Jews” bent on taking possession of
the empire as part of some sinister plot by international Jewry. Within
the Ottoman Empire, a virulent conservative backlash against the
progressives quickly plunged the new parliamentary government into an
era of political infighting and paralysis.</p>
<p>By 1911, the Young Turks had begun to solidify their hold on power,
and had come up with three main rallying points in hopes of keeping
their fractious empire together: modernization, the defense of Islam,
and a call for a rejoining of the greater Turkic-speaking world, or
Turanism. All of which sounded good, except that these three planks
stood in direct opposition to one another.</p>
<p>The very progressivism of many of the Young Turks’ social decrees may
have played well with secularists and the empire’s Jewish and Christian
minorities, but they simultaneously enraged huge numbers of Muslim
traditionalists. Similarly, while their increasingly jingoistic Turanist
rhetoric surely excited the ethnic Turk populace, it just as surely
alienated the non-Turkish populations—Arabs, Slavs, Armenians,
Greeks—who now constituted a majority within the empire. As for wrapping
themselves in the mantle of Islam’s defenders, that might conceivably
win over Turkish, Kurdish, and Arab Muslims, but it didn’t do much for
everyone else—including, for that matter, the sizable minority of Arabs
who were Christians. In effect, by trying to find something to appeal to
every segment of their polyglot society, the Young Turks were giving all
of them something to hate and fear.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, a young man increasingly attuned to the political and
social currents swirling around him, an inescapable conclusion began to
form: little by little, the Ottoman Empire was coming apart at the
seams. During his tenure at Jerablus, that process of disintegration
accelerated, and what had been an intermittent nibbling at the Ottoman
realm by the European powers was to become a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>IN EARLY 1907, as Germany began to assert its assumed prerogatives as
an imperial power, Curt Prüfer took up his post as embassy dragoman in
Cairo.</p>
<p>On paper, the dragoman was merely the embassy interpreter, tasked to
assist the ambassador at his diplomatic meetings, as well as to
translate whatever documents the legation might address to the local
government, or vice versa. In reality, an ambitious dragoman could
become a virtual power unto himself. Then, as now, ambassadors were
often a clueless and temporary bunch, products of a palace sinecure
system and prone to be far more adept on the dance floor than at the
negotiating table. Dragomen, on the other hand, represented
continuity—many remained in their positions for decades—and through
their translating work had intimate knowledge of most everything going
on in every subsection of the embassy. Further, because they existed in
a gray area between an embassy’s diplomatic and consular branches, they
could quietly pursue questionable activities, such as meeting with a
regime’s enemies, which might provoke an outcry if conducted by their
superiors. This was crucial, for while nearly all the competing European
imperial powers at the dawn of the twentieth century viewed their
overseas legations as handy instruments for intelligence gathering,
influence peddling, and general mischief making, the Germans were in a
class by themselves. In keeping with Wilhelm II’s pugnacious approach to
foreign policy, German legations were forever being caught out in some
ungentlemanly transgression—stealing government and industrial secrets,
operating spy rings—that left their purportedly more high-minded British
and French counterparts spluttering with indignation. At the center of
many of these various scandals were the embassy dragomen.</p>
<p>In Egypt Prüfer had landed in one of the most important playgrounds
for this muscular German approach to diplomacy, a place where Berlin saw
the opportunity to both curry favor with the Ottoman leadership in
Constantinople and chip away at the hegemony of their British rivals.
That’s because in 1882, under the pretext of defending the ruling clique
from an independence-minded nationalist leader, Britain had invaded
Egypt and effectively taken control of the country that had been under
titular Ottoman rule for nearly four hundred years. The British hadn’t
stopped there. In May 1906, just nine months before Prüfer’s arrival at
the German embassy, they had exploited a minor diplomatic dispute in the
Sinai, the vast peninsula standing to the east of the Suez Canal, to
wrest that from the Ottomans as well. That episode had further fueled
Egyptian discontent with British rule—as well as Constantinople’s
bitterness toward its former friend—and the Germans operating in Cairo
saw nothing to lose and everything to gain by keeping that enmity at a
low boil.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest asset Prüfer had to draw on in the Egyptian
capital was his immediate supervisor at the embassy, a larger-than-life
character named Count Max von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years the dragoman’s senior, Oppenheim was a gregarious,
snappily attired bon vivant with a handlebar mustache and a fondness for
both the ladies and the racetrack, and a member in good standing at
Berlin’s Union Club, the exclusive haunt of Germany’s political and
economic elite. Oppenheim joined the German diplomatic service in 1883.
In short order, he had decamped for Syria, beginning a love affair with
the Near East that would last for the next sixty years. An amateur
archaeologist and ethnologist, he conducted archaeological expeditions
in the countryside, enterprises that he personally financed from his
banking family’s fortune. In Oppenheim’s case, the hobby eventually paid
off; in 1899, he discovered one of the most important lost settlements
of the Neolithic period, Tell Halaf, in northern Syria. (It is
presumably on the strength of that discovery that Oppenheim bears the
odd distinction of having a Montblanc pen named after him, joining such
luminaries as Charlemagne, Copernicus, and Alexander the Great in the
company’s “patron of the arts” line.) The adventurer finally set up a
semipermanent base of operations in Cairo in 1896, when he was given a
vaguely defined attaché position in the consular section of the German
embassy.</p>
<p>There were several controversial aspects to the count—no one was
quite sure of the title’s pedigree beyond its appearance on Oppenheim’s
business card—that set him apart from his diplomatic colleagues in the
Egyptian capital. One was his propensity for “going native.” This was
most evident in his habit of gadding about clad in Arab robes, as well
as his choosing to live in a “native” quarter of the city, but it also
extended to his amorous arrangements. According to Sean McMeekin in The
Berlin-Baghdad Express, “Every autumn, after his return from Berlin,
Oppenheim’s head servant Soliman would procure him a new slave girl (he
called them his Zeitfrauen, or temporary concubines), who would become
mistress of the harem until the following year, and who was herself
served by two female attendants.”</p>
<p>But the count was a man of catholic enthusiasms, and in addition to
archaeology and horse racing and slave girls, there was one that
Germany’s imperial rivals in the Near East found particularly irksome:
Max von Oppenheim wanted to rearrange the regional political chessboard
through stoking the fires of Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>He had begun formulating the idea shortly after taking up his
consular position in Cairo. In Oppenheim’s estimation, the great
Achilles’ heels of Germany’s principal European competitors—Great
Britain, France, and Russia—were the Muslim populations to be found
within their imperial borders, populations that deeply resented being
under the thumb of Christian colonial powers. As the only major European
power never to have attempted colonization in the Muslim world,
Oppenheim propounded, Germany was uniquely positioned to turn this
situation to its advantage—especially if it could forge an alliance with
the Ottoman Empire. If it came to a Europe-wide war, Oppenheim posited
in a flurry of reports to the German foreign ministry, and the Ottoman
authorities in Constantinople could be persuaded to call for a holy war
against the Christian occupiers of their former lands, what would happen
in British-ruled Egypt, or French Tunisia, or the Russian Caucasus?</p>
<p>One person who was itching to find out was Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Forwarded some of Oppenheim’s “war by revolution” treatises, the German
emperor quickly became a committed proponent of the jihad notion. Wilhem
saw to it that Oppenheim, “my feared spy,” was promoted at the Cairo
embassy, assuming the somewhat ironic title of chief legal counsel.</p>
<p>Until the blessed day of pan-Islamic jihad came, there was plenty of
work to be done in British Egypt. Through the early 1900s, Oppenheim
spent much of his time—and not a little of his personal fortune—quietly
wooing a broad cross section of the Egyptian elite opposed to British
rule: tribal sheikhs, urban intellectuals, nationalists, and religious
figures. While he had already won the kaiser to his jihadist ideas, in
1907 Oppenheim gained another adherent in the form of his new
subordinate, Curt Prüfer. Enough with scholarly articles and Egyptian
shadow plays; under the tutelage of his charismatic supervisor, Prüfer
now saw the opportunity to spread gasoline over the region, put a match
to it, and see what happened.</p>
<p>With his accent and command of Arabic far superior to Oppenheim’s,
the new dragoman became the key liaison between the embassy and the
Egyptian capital’s assorted malcontents. In particular, Prüfer carefully
cultivated a friendship with the khedive (roughly equivalent to viceroy)
of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi II, the local Ottoman head of state, whom the
British had maintained on the throne even as they stripped him of all
authority. Understandably, this arrangement had never sat well with the
khedive, a resentment Prüfer did his best to nurture. The two German
agents provocateurs didn’t limit their ministrations to the Cairene
mewling class. In early 1909, Prüfer and Oppenheim set out on a
wide-ranging tour of the Egyptian and Syrian hinterlands, where,
disguised in Bedouin garb, they endeavored to promote the twin causes of
pan-Islam and anticolonialism among the tribesmen.</p>
<p>But one doesn’t get Montblanc pens named after them by sticking to a
routine, and in late 1910, Count von Oppenheim made a surprising
announcement: he was leaving his legal counsel post at the embassy to
return to his first true love of archaeology. Specifically, the count
had decided it was high time to begin his excavations at Tell Halaf, the
Neolithic ruins he had discovered in northern Syria, and which had now
sat undisturbed for over a decade.</p>
<p>The understandable relief with which British authorities in Cairo
greeted this news—they had been trying for years to find some pretext to
have Oppenheim deported—was leavened by a healthy dose of skepticism,
especially when a quick glance at a map revealed that Tell Halaf lay
precisely alongside the proposed path of the Baghdad Railway. This was a
massive public works project underwritten by the Ottoman government that
was designed to link Constantinople to its easternmost—and reportedly,
oil-rich—territory of Iraq (or Mesopotamia, as it was still commonly
referred to in the West). Over the virulent objections of Britain and
France, in 1905 the Ottomans had awarded the construction project, and
the generous concessionary rights that went with it, to Germany.</p>
<p>But even if rid of “the kaiser’s spy,” the British in Egypt couldn’t
let their guard down. In his place, Count Max von Oppenheim had left
behind in Cairo a very dedicated and resourceful protégé.</p>
<p>THE HEADQUARTERS FOR the Carchemish dig was a small compound about a
half mile from the ruins, a former licorice company storehouse on the
outskirts of the village of Jerablus. It was here that T. E. Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley lived, as well as entertained the small groups of
Western travelers who found their way to the excavation site with
growing frequency. Over the course of their three years there, the two
men continually added new rooms and storage sheds to the original
structure, until the Jerablus “station” made for both a comfortable and
expansive home. It was a place Lawrence came to regard as his sanctuary.
As he wrote to his family in the summer of 1912, after having made a
trip of just a few days to the Syrian coast, “I seem to have been months
away from Jerablus, and am longing for its peace.”</p>
<p>But in the Near East, the very notion of peace was rapidly becoming
an anachronism as the crumbling of the Ottoman Empire gained momentum.
In 1911, the Italians invaded Libya, setting off a bloody war that
eventually led to an Ottoman defeat. Overlapping that conflict came the
First Balkan War, in which the Ottomans lost most of their remaining
European possessions, immediately followed by the Second Balkan War. The
grim news had a cascading effect. By 1913, when the Young Turks staged a
second coup to take over the reins of government outright, small-scale
rebellions and separatist movements had sprung up across the breadth of
what remained of the empire, with even local chieftains and clan leaders
sensing that the moment had come to finally throw off the Ottoman
yoke.</p>
<p>In this, the once-idyllic environs of northern Syria were in no way
immune. Given the ethnic composition of the region—the population was
overwhelmingly Arab or Kurd, with the presence of ethnic Turks largely
limited to local representatives of the Ottoman power structure, its
mayors and police and tax collectors—Lawrence had developed a rather
simplistic moralist view of its inhabitants: love for the noble Arab;
wary respect for the blustering Kurd; hatred for the cruel Turk. As a
result, he was quite pleased when the local Kurdish tribes threatened an
insurrection in 1912, and by the increasingly open defiance that he saw
playing out in the streets of Jerablus by the once-cowed Arabs toward
their Turkish overlords. The Ottoman thrall over the population—in
Lawrence’s view, a thrall based on fear and corruption and the sheer
soul-grinding machinery of an inept bureaucracy—was rapidly slipping,
and it was very hard to see how they might ever restore it. That
estimation delighted him.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the roiling within the Ottoman Empire that was
being felt in northern Syria. There was also the spreading intrigue of
the European imperial powers, all of them maneuvering everywhere in
search of some advantage against their rivals. In particular, the
arrival on the scene of the infamous Count Max von Oppenheim seemed a
clear indication that the region was now part of the ever-expanding
European chessboard. Having ostensibly returned to Syria to begin
excavations at Tell Halaf, some one hundred miles to the east of
Carchemish, Oppenheim dropped by the Jerablus station for a visit one
afternoon in July 1912.</p>
<p>“He was such a horrible person,” Lawrence wrote his youngest brother,
“I hardly was polite—but was interesting instead [sic]. He said [the
Carchemish ruins] were the most interesting and important discoveries he
had ever seen barring his own.”</p>
<p>Before long, Lawrence and Woolley began hearing rumors of the count’s
supposedly shoddy work at the Tell Halaf site, stories of great
cartloads of treasures being illegally hauled away, bound for Berlin.
They also couldn’t help notice that after years of lackadaisical
progress on the Baghdad Railway—and in the Ottoman world,
“lackadaisical” joined to “progress” tended to evoke geological
comparisons—the pace of work suddenly accelerated once Oppenheim
appeared. So accelerated, in fact, that by late 1912 the German
engineers and their advance crews had set to work on one of the most
technically complicated segments of the rail line, a trestle bridge over
the fast-flowing Euphrates River. By remarkable coincidence, the site
for that bridge was directly alongside the village of Jerablus.</p>
<p>Throughout 1913 and well into 1914, the two groups of Western workers
who improbably found themselves in this same remote corner of northern
Syria had an alternately amicable and contentious relationship. The
German railwaymen in Jerablus assisted the British archaeologists by
hauling away the discarded stone from their excavations for use in their
railroad embankments. In turn, the Germans frequently sought out the
Britons—and, with his fluent Arabic, especially Lawrence—to mediate in
their perpetually tense relations with local workers. A chief source of
that tension was the difficulty the Germans had in finding good help,
their best workers routinely jumping ship for the higher wages and more
respectful supervision of Lawrence and Woolley.</p>
<p>Very soon, these two groups would be on opposite sides of a world
war, and a different railroad—the Hejaz line, running from Damascus
seven hundred miles south to the city of Medina—would become the most
vital transportation link in the Middle Eastern theater of that
conflict. The knowledge Lawrence gained from watching the railway
construction in Jerablus was undoubtedly of great assistance to him
when, in a few years’ time, he would make blowing up the Hejaz Railway a
personal pastime.</p>
<p>AT MIDMORNING ON September 15, 1913, twenty-six-year-old William Yale
was part of a three-man crew “pulling rods”—detaching and stacking drill
sections, just about the most miserable job to be had in an oilfield—in
the Kiefer field of northern Oklahoma when a courier on horseback
approached. Minutes later, the Kiefer straw boss called Yale over to
hand him a telegram. It was from the corporate headquarters of the
Standard Oil Company of New York, and it was succinct: “Report to New
York immediately.”</p>
<p>After graduating from his eponymous university in 1910, Yale had
struggled to find his calling until, in 1912, he came across a notice
soliciting applicants for the “foreign service school” of the Standard
Oil Company of New York. On a whim, he applied.</p>
<p>Operating out of Standard’s corporate headquarters at 26 Broadway in
New York, the “school” consisted of a four-month intensive lecture and
seminar program, designed to educate its applicants in all aspects of
the petroleum industry, as well as to instill in them the “Standard man”
ideal. Just what that ideal might consist of was difficult to say, for
by 1912 Standard Oil was the most infamous corporation in the history of
international commerce, its name synonymous with capitalist greed run
amok.</p>
<p>Through cutthroat tactics devised by its principal shareholder, John
D. Rockefeller, Standard had so thoroughly dominated the U.S. petroleum
industry over the previous four decades that by the early 1900s it
controlled nearly 90 percent of the nation’s oil production. For nearly
as long, it had operated a complex web of front companies and shell
corporations that had defeated the efforts of every “trust buster”
lawman trying to break its stranglehold. Finally, in 1911, just the year
before Yale’s job application, the U.S. Supreme Court declared Standard
to be an illegal monopoly and decreed it be broken up into thirty-four
separate companies.</p>
<p>Whether this divestiture truly ended the Standard monopoly is still
the subject of debate, but it did have the effect of forcing its
component parts to specialize, either to focus on supplying regional
domestic markets or on building international exports. Among the most
aggressive in this latter sphere was the new Standard Oil Company of New
York—often referred to by its acronym, Socony—the second largest of the
thirty-four “baby Standards.”</p>
<p>While other baby Standards turned inward, Socony looked at the great
world beyond and saw a plethora of burgeoning markets thirsting for
petroleum. It was to coordinate and standardize its marketing approaches
in these far-flung spots that the company had launched its foreign
service school. William Yale, an enthusiastic pupil, would call the
program’s teaching methods “far more effective and efficient” than
anything he’d encountered at either prep school or university.</p>
<p>And the Socony administrators clearly liked what they saw in William
Yale. At the conclusion of his coursework, he was selected to stay on
and dispatched to take a firsthand look at oil production in the United
States in preparation for future work abroad. Through the autumn of
1912, Yale shuttled to a variety of Standard oilfields in the Midwest,
tasked only to write up weekly reports on what he observed and send them
back to Socony headquarters.</p>
<p>But the endless tour of oilfields had soon become monotonous to the
restless Yale. In early 1913, he wrote to his New York supervisors
asking to be given a field job, arguing that if he was to learn any more
about the oil business it would have to be by doing rather than
observing. That letter undoubtedly further endeared him to 26 Broadway;
the notion that a college man—an Ivy League graduate, no less—would
request to toil as a laborer indicated just the sort of employee
Standard was looking for. Yale was soon sent to the new Cushing field in
western Oklahoma to work as a roustabout.</p>
<p>For a time, he reveled in the hard labor. Living in the middle of
nowhere for weeks on end, Yale worked a succession of Oklahoma fields,
where he cleared drill sites, laid piping, hauled machinery, and
constructed derricks. He had been doing this for several months when the
cable arrived from New York.</p>
<p>Just three days removed from the Kiefer field, Yale walked into the
lobby of the Socony corporate headquarters at 26 Broadway in lower
Manhattan. There, he was taken up to the thirteenth-floor office suite
of Standard’s vice president, William Bemis. Yale found two other men
already waiting in the suite, hats in hand, and all three maintained a
respectful silence as the officious Bemis fired off directives to his
scurrying staff.</p>
<p>“My mind was in a dream world,” Yale recounted, “as I listened to him
dictating instructions to his secretary about shipments of kerosene oil
to Shanghai, about contracts for asphalt to pave the streets of a city
in India, and contracts with the Greek government for fuel oil to supply
the Greek navy at Piraeus.”</p>
<p>When finally Bemis turned his attention to the three waiting men, it
was to inform them that they had been selected for a special overseas
assignment, that in just two days’ time they would board SS Imperator in
New York harbor for its voyage to Calais, France. From there, they would
travel overland across the length of Europe to Constantinople, where
they would receive further instructions from the manager of Standard’s
branch office. Before dismissing them, Bemis stressed to the three men
that they were embarking on a highly confidential mission. As such, they
were to tell no one of their ultimate destination or of their
affiliation with Standard Oil. Instead, they were to pass themselves off
as wealthy “playboys” en route to a Grand Tour of the Holy Land, a
charade lent credence by their deluxe travel accommodations: the
Imperator was the newest and most luxurious passenger ship plying the
Atlantic crossing, their rail passage to Constantinople was to be aboard
the fabled Orient Express, and they would be traveling first-class the
entire way.</p>
<p>But upholding the playboy ruse was easier said than done for Yale’s
two companions. J. C. Hill, the leader of the team, was a
rough-around-the-edges crew boss from the steel mills of Pennsylvania.
Rudolf McGovern was a dour and socially awkward geologist in his late
twenties. Even if these two could manage to put on airs suggesting that
they came from money—and that seemed doubtful—they hardly seemed prime
candidates for a pilgrimage to biblical sites. Perhaps wisely, their
answer to the playboy directive was to interact with the ship’s other
first-class passengers as little as possible.</p>
<p>William Yale had no such difficulties. To the contrary, the voyage
was like a disorienting return to his former life. Among the Imperator’s
first-class passengers were a great many young people, the offspring of
America’s industrial magnates and landed aristocracy, setting off on
their requisite Grand Tour of Europe, the sort of tame adventure that
until a few years earlier would have been his lot.</p>
<p>Yale would recall one peculiar detail of that journey. The Imperator
(German for emperor) was the new flagship of the Hamburg-America Line,
and at every dinnertime its German officers rose to offer a toast to
“der Tag” (the day). Unschooled in the nuances of German, Yale assumed
that the gesture was in quaint celebration of the day just lived; it
would be some time before he understood it was actually a kind of code,
a toast in giddy anticipation of the coming world war, then less than a
year away.</p>
<p>ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1913, the same day that William Yale received his
cable at the Kiefer oilfield ordering him to New York, T. E. Lawrence
was at the train station in Aleppo, sixty miles to the west of
Carchemish, awaiting the arrival of his brother Will.</p>
<p>Of his four brothers, Lawrence had always been closest to Will, the
middle child and just two years his junior. Upon learning that his
brother was leaving England to take up a teaching position in India, he
had implored Will to stop off in Syria en route.</p>
<p>Despite their closeness, the visit must have been the source of some
anxiety for Lawrence, who had long since been consigned to the role of
family bohemian; it was easy to imagine that his brother might be quite
shocked by the primitiveness of his surroundings and to report back as
much to Oxford. Lawrence needn’t have worried. After the two spent some
ten days together at Jerablus, Lawrence saw Will off at the local train
station for the return to Aleppo, a moment Will recounted in a letter to
their parents:</p>
<p>“You must not think of Ned as leading an uncivilized existence. When
I saw him last as the train left the station, he was wearing white
flannels, socks and red slippers, with a white Magdalen blazer, and was
talking to the governor of Biredjik in lordly fashion.”</p>
<p>That parting at Jerablus was to be the last time the brothers would
ever see each other.</p>
