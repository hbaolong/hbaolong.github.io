<p>16 Even Gilbert Clayton: Clayton “Appreciation” of Aqaba landing,
January 1917; SADD Clayton Papers, 694/5/17–21.</p>
<p>17 Yet at some point: In his authorized biography Lawrence of Arabia,
Jeremy Wilson makes an extremely convincing case that Lawrence probably
imparted details of Sykes-Picot to Faisal within the first few days of
his return to Wejh in February 1917. Given Wilson’s meticulous research
in coming to this conclusion, it’s curious why he then concludes that
Lawrence’s motive in doing so was to “deal with the French question once
and for all.”</p>
<p>As evidenced by the Rabegh episode, French military overtures in the
Middle East were wholly dependent on the support—or lack thereof—of
their more powerful ally in the region, Great Britain. Besides, at the
time of Lawrence’s return to Wejh in early February 1917, Faisal’s deep
distrust of Colonel Brémond was already well established. Consequently,
the notion that Lawrence disclosed Sykes-Picot to Faisal out of concern
over French intrigues or influence is puzzling. Instead, the most
logical explanation is that Lawrence meant to thwart the one power that
truly had the capacity to betray the Arabs: Great Britain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, successive sympathetic Lawrence biographers have
accepted this anti-French motive in explaining Lawrence’s disclosure.
Taking matters a step further, Wilson even asserts that Lawrence made
this disclosure because “in the long run it would surely serve Britain’s
interests best.” Perhaps in Lawrence’s conception of Britain’s
interests, but most certainly not that of the British government at the
time.</p>

<p>36 “General Clayton listened”: Aaronsohn, Diary, April 3, 1917;
ZY.</p>
<p>37 At sunset on March 28: T. E. Lawrence’s account of his journey to
Abdullah’s camp, the attack on Aba el Naam, and his ruminations on
guerrilla warfare are drawn from Lawrence, Seven Pillars, book 3,
chapters 32–36, pp. 183–215.</p>
<p>38 “graciously permitted”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 216.</p>
<p>39 “The Turk was harmless”: Ibid., p. 225.</p>
<p>40 With the Turks put on: In the absence of evidence pinpointing when
Lawrence came up with the Aqaba-by-land scheme, most biographers have
concluded he did so in early February 1917, and that he shared the idea
with Faisal at that time as a way to dissuade him from the Aqaba-by-sea
plan urged by Brémond and others. On closer examination, this conclusion
seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s idea for taking Aqaba was such a radical departure from
anything previously considered, and if successful would so dramatically
alter the political chessboard in Arabia, that implementing it surely
would have become his overriding goal once he’d conceived of it. If that
had occurred in February, it’s hard to imagine why he would have then
removed himself from Faisal’s camp for the thirty-seven days he spent
going to and from Abdullah’s camp in Wadi Ais.</p>
<p>Similarly, had Faisal known of an inland plan in February, it’s
hardly credible that he would have then thrown aside Lawrence’s counsel
and resumed his support for a British-assisted coastal attack on Aqaba,
as he did in early March, and again in early April. Although Lawrence
may have offered Faisal vague palliatives in February over how Aqaba
might best be taken to secure the Arabs’ move north, it almost certainly
wasn’t until the two men were reunited in Wejh in mid-April that the
inland plan took tangible form.</p>
<p>41 “I was very sorry”: Faisal to Lawrence, undated but notated “about
the end of March,” 1917; PRO-FO 882/6, f. 18A.</p>
