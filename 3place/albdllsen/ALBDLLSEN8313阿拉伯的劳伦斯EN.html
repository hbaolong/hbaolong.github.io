<h4 id="authors-note">Author’s Note</h4>
<p>In war, language itself often becomes a weapon, and that was
certainly true in the Middle Eastern theater of World War I. For
example, while the Allied powers tended to use “the Ottoman Empire” and
“Turkey” interchangeably, they displayed a marked preference for the
latter designation as the war went on, undoubtedly to help fortify the
notion that the non-Turkish populations of the Ottoman Empire were
somehow “captive peoples” in need of liberation. Similarly, while
early-war Allied documents often noted that Palestine and Lebanon were
provinces of Ottoman Syria, that distinction tended to disappear as the
British and French made plans to seize those territories in the postwar
era. On a more subtle level, all the Western powers, including the
Ottoman Empire’s/Turkey’s chief ally in the war, Germany, continued to
refer to the city of “Constantinople” (its name under a Christian empire
overthrown by the Muslim Ottomans in 1453) rather than the locally
preferred “Istanbul.”</p>
<p>As many Middle East historians rightly point out, the use of these
Western-preferred labels—Turkey rather than the Ottoman Empire,
Constantinople instead of Istanbul—is indicative of a Eurocentric
perspective that, in its most pernicious form, serves to validate the
European (read imperialist) view of history.</p>
<p>This poses a dilemma for historians focusing on the Western role in
that war theater—as I do in this book—since the bulk of their research
will naturally be drawn from Western sources. In such a situation, it
would seem a writer must choose between clarity and political
sensitivity; since I feel many readers would find it confusing if, for
example, I consistently referred to “Istanbul” when virtually all cited
material refers to “Constantinople,” I have opted for clarity.</p>
<p>I was aided in this decision, however, by the fact that these
language distinctions were not nearly so clear-cut at the time as some
contemporary Middle East historians contend. Even the wartime leadership
of the Ottoman Empire/Turkey frequently referred to the city of
“Constantinople,” and also tended to use “Ottoman” and “Turkey”
synonymously (see the epigraph from Djemal Pasha in Chapter One). To
dwell on all this too long is only to invite more complications. As
Ottoman historian Mustafa Aksakal readily concedes in The Ottoman Road
to War (pp. x–xi), “it seems anachronistic to speak of an ‘Ottoman
government’ and an ‘Ottoman cabinet’ in 1914 when the major players had
explicitly repudiated ‘Ottomanism’ and were set on constructing a
government by and for the Turks . . .”</p>
<p>In sum, like the principals in this book, I’ve used “Ottoman Empire”
and “Turkey” somewhat interchangeably, guided mostly by what sounds
right in a particular context, while for simplicity, I refer exclusively
to “Constantinople.”</p>
<p>On a different language-related matter, Arabic names can be
transliterated in a wide variety of ways. For purposes of consistency, I
have adopted the spellings that appear most often in quoted material,
and have standardized those spellings within quoted material. In most
cases, this adheres to Egyptian Arabic pronunciation. For example, a man
named Mohammed al-Faroki, whose surname appeared in different documents
of the time also as Faruqi, Farogi, Farookee, Faroukhi, etc., will
appear as Faroki throughout. The most notable case in point is that of
T. E. Lawrence’s chief Arab ally, Faisal ibn Hussein, usually referred
to as Feisal by Lawrence, but as Faisal by most others, including
historians. To avoid confusion, I’ve changed all spellings to the
latter.</p>
<p>Also, the use of English punctuation has changed quite dramatically
over the past century, and Lawrence in particular had an extremely
idiosyncratic—some might say antagonistic—approach to it in his writing.
In quotations where I believed the original punctuation might obscure
meaning for modern readers, I have adopted the modern norm. These
changes apply only to punctuation; no words have been added or deleted
from quotations except where indicated by brackets or ellipses.</p>
<p>Finally, two versions of Seven Pillars of Wisdom were published in T.
E. Lawrence’s lifetime. The first, a handprinted edition of only eight
copies, was produced in 1922 and is commonly referred to as the “Oxford
Text,” while a revised edition of approximately two hundred copies was
produced in 1926; it is this latter version that is most commonly read
today. Since Lawrence made clear that he regarded the Oxford Text as a
rough draft, I have quoted almost exclusively from the 1926 version. In
those few instances where I’ve quoted from the Oxford Text, the endnote
citation is marked “(Oxford).”</p>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>On the morning of October 30, 1918, Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence
received a summons to Buckingham Palace. The king had requested his
presence.</p>
<p>The collective mood in London that day was euphoric. For the past
four years and three months, Great Britain and much of the rest of the
world had been consumed by the bloodiest conflict in recorded history,
one that had claimed the lives of some sixteen million people across
three continents. Now, with a speed that scarcely could have been
imagined mere weeks earlier, it was all coming to an end. On that same
day, one of Great Britain’s three principal foes, the Ottoman Empire,
was accepting peace terms, and the remaining two, Germany and
Austria-Hungary, would shortly follow suit. Colonel Lawrence’s
contribution to that war effort had been in its Middle Eastern theater,
and he too was caught quite off guard by its rapid close. At the
beginning of that month, he had still been in the field assisting in the
capture of Damascus, an event that heralded the collapse of the Ottoman
army. Back in England for less than a week, he was already consulting
with those senior British statesmen and generals tasked with mapping out
the postwar borders of the Middle East, a once-fanciful endeavor that
had now become quite urgent. Lawrence was apparently under the
impression that his audience with King George V that morning was to
discuss those ongoing deliberations.</p>
<p>He was mistaken. Once at the palace, the thirty-year-old colonel was
ushered into a ballroom where, flanked by a half dozen dignitaries and a
coterie of costumed courtiers, the king and queen soon entered. A low
cushioned stool had been placed just before the king’s raised dais,
while to the monarch’s immediate right, the lord chamberlain held a
velvet pillow on which an array of medals rested. After introductions
were made, George V fixed his guest with a smile: “I have some presents
for you.”</p>
<p>As a student of British history, Colonel Lawrence knew precisely what
was about to occur. The pedestal was an investiture stool, upon which he
was to kneel as the king performed the elaborate, centuries-old
ceremony—the conferring of a sash and the medals on the pillow, the
tapping with a sword and the intoning of an oath—that would make him a
Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.</p>
<p>It was a moment T. E. Lawrence had long dreamed of. As a boy, he was
obsessed with medieval history and the tales of King Arthur’s court, and
his greatest ambition, he once wrote, was to be knighted by the age of
thirty. On that morning, his youthful aspiration was about to be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>A couple of details added to the honor. Over the past four years,
King George had given out so many commendations and medals to his
nation’s soldiers that even knighthoods were now generally bestowed en
masse; in the autumn of 1918, a private investiture like Lawrence’s was
practically unheard of. Also unusual was the presence of Queen Mary. She
normally eschewed these sorts of ceremonies, but she had been so stirred
by the accounts of T. E. Lawrence’s wartime deeds as to make an
exception in his case.</p>
<p>Except Lawrence didn’t kneel. Instead, just as the ceremony got under
way, he quietly informed the king that he was refusing the honor.</p>
<p>There followed a moment of confusion. Over the nine-hundred-year
history of the monarchy, the refusal of knighthood was such an
extraordinary event that there was no protocol for how to handle it.
Eventually, King George returned to the lord chamberlain’s pillow the
medal he had been awkwardly holding, and under the baleful gaze of a
furious Queen Mary, Colonel Lawrence turned and walked away.</p>
<p>TODAY, MORE THAN seven decades after his death, and nearly a century
since the exploits that made him famous, Thomas Edward
Lawrence—“Lawrence of Arabia,” as he is better known—remains one of the
most enigmatic and controversial figures of the twentieth century.
Despite scores of biographies, countless scholarly studies, and at least
three movies, including one considered a masterpiece, historians have
never quite decided what to make of the young, bashful Oxford scholar
who rode into battle at the head of an Arab army and changed
history.</p>
<p>One reason for the contentiousness over his memory has to do with the
terrain he traversed. Lawrence was both eyewitness to and participant in
some of the most pivotal events leading to the creation of the modern
Middle East, and this is a corner of the earth where even the simplest
assertion is dissected and parsed and argued over. In the unending
debates over the roots of that region’s myriad fault lines, Lawrence has
been alternately extolled and pilloried, sanctified, demonized, even
diminished to a footnote, as political goals require.</p>
<p>Then there was Lawrence’s own personality. A supremely private and
hidden man, he seemed intent on baffling all those who would try to know
him. A natural leader of men, or a charlatan? A man without fear, or
both a moral and physical coward? Long before any of his biographers, it
was Lawrence who first attached these contradictory characteristics—and
many others—to himself. Joined to this was a mischievous streak, a
storyteller’s delight in twitting those who believed in and insisted on
“facts.” The episode at Buckingham Palace is a case in point. In
subsequent years, Lawrence offered several accounts of what had
transpired in the ballroom, each at slight variance with the others and
at even greater variance to the recollections of eyewitnesses. Earlier
than most, Lawrence seemed to embrace the modern concept that history
was malleable, that truth was what people were willing to believe.</p>
<p>Among writers on Lawrence, these contradictions have often spurred
descents into minutiae, arcane squabbles between those seeking to
tarnish his reputation and those seeking to defend it. Did he truly make
a particular desert crossing in forty-nine hours, as he claimed, or
might it have taken a day longer? Did he really play such a signal role
in Battle X, or does more credit belong to British officer Y or to Arab
chieftain Z? Only slightly less tedious are those polemicists wishing to
pigeonhole him for ideological ends. Lawrence, the great defender of the
Jewish people or the raging anti-Semite? The enlightened progressive
striving for Arab independence or the crypto-imperialist? Lawrence left
behind such a large body of writing, and his views altered so
dramatically over the course of his life, that it’s possible with
careful cherry-picking to both confirm and refute most every accolade
and accusation made of him.</p>
<p>Beyond being tiresome, the cardinal sin of these debates is that they
obscure the most beguiling riddle of Lawrence’s story: How did he do it?
How did a painfully shy Oxford archaeologist without a single day of
military training become the battlefield commander of a foreign
revolutionary army, the political master strategist who foretold so many
of the Middle Eastern calamities to come?</p>
<p>The short answer might seem somewhat anticlimactic: Lawrence was able
to become “Lawrence of Arabia” because no one was paying much
attention.</p>
<p>Amid the vast slaughter occurring across the breadth of Europe in
World War I, the Middle Eastern theater of that war was of markedly
secondary importance. Within that theater, the Arab Revolt to which
Lawrence became affiliated was, to use his own words, “a sideshow of a
sideshow.” In terms of lives and money and matériel expended, in terms
of the thousands of hours spent in weighty consultation between generals
and kings and prime ministers, the imperial plotters of Europe were
infinitely more concerned over the future status of Belgium, for
example, than with what might happen in the impoverished and distant
regions of the Middle East. Consequently, in the view of British war
planners, if a young army officer left largely to his own devices could
sufficiently organize the fractious Arab tribes to harass their Turkish
enemy, all to the good. Of course, it wouldn’t be very long before both
the Arab Revolt and the Middle East became vastly more important to the
rest of the world, but this was a possibility barely considered—indeed,
it could hardly have been imagined—at the time.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the whole story either. That’s because the low regard
with which British war strategists viewed events in the Middle East
found reflection in the other great warring powers. As a result, these
powers, too, relegated their military efforts in the region to whatever
could be spared from the more important battlefields elsewhere,
consigning the task of intelligence gathering and fomenting rebellion
and forging alliances to men with résumés just as modest and unlikely as
Lawrence’s.</p>
<p>As with Lawrence, these other competitors in the field tended to be
young, wholly untrained for the missions they were given, and largely
unsupervised. And just as with their more famous British counterpart, to
capitalize on their extraordinary freedom of action, these men drew upon
a very particular set of personality traits—cleverness, bravery, a
talent for treachery—to both forge their own destiny and alter the
course of history.</p>
<p>Among them was a fallen American aristocrat in his twenties who, as
the only American field intelligence officer in the Middle East during
World War I, would strongly influence his nation’s postwar policy in the
region, even as he remained on the payroll of Standard Oil of New York.
There was the young German scholar who, donning the camouflage of Arab
robes, would seek to foment an Islamic jihad against the Western
colonial powers, and who would carry his “war by revolution” ideas into
the Nazi era. Along with them was a Jewish scientist who, under the
cover of working for the Ottoman government, would establish an
elaborate anti-Ottoman spy ring and play a crucial role in creating a
Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>If little remembered today, these men shared something else with
their British counterpart. Like Lawrence, they were not the senior
generals who charted battlefield campaigns in the Middle East, nor the
elder statesmen who drew lines on maps in the war’s aftermath. Instead,
their roles were perhaps even more profound: it was they who created the
conditions on the ground that brought those campaigns to fruition, who
made those postwar policies and boundaries possible. History is always a
collaborative effort, and in the case of World War I an effort that
involved literally millions of players, but to a surprising degree, the
subterranean and complex game these four men played, their hidden
loyalties and personal duels, helped create the modern Middle East and,
by inevitable extension, the world we live in today.</p>
<p>Yet within this small galaxy of personalities there remain at least
two compelling reasons why T. E. Lawrence and his story should reside
firmly at its center.</p>
<p>The modern Middle East was largely created by the British. It was
they who carried the Allied war effort in the region during World War I
and who, at its close, principally fashioned its peace. It was a peace
presaged by the nickname given the region by covetous Allied leaders in
wartime: “the Great Loot.” As one of Britain’s most important and
influential agents in that arena, Lawrence was intimately connected to
all, good and bad, that was to come.</p>
<p>Second, and as the episode at Buckingham Palace attests, this was an
experience that left him utterly changed, unrecognizable in certain
respects even to himself. Victory carries a moral burden the vanquished
never know, and as an architect of momentous events, Lawrence would be
uniquely haunted by what he saw and did during the Great Loot.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-1-playboys-in-the-holy-land">Chapter 1 Playboys in the
Holy Land</h4>
<p>I consider this new crisis that has emerged to be a blessing. I
believe that it is the Turks’ ultimate duty either to live like an
honorable nation or to exit the stage of history gloriously.</p>
<p>DJEMAL PASHA, GOVERNOR OF SYRIA, ON TURKEY’S ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I,
NOVEMBER 2, 1914</p>
<p>The storm began as a mild weather disturbance, one fairly common for
that time of year. For several days in early January 1914, a hot dry
breeze had come off the Sahara Desert to pass over the winter-cooled
waters of the eastern Mediterranean. By the morning of the ninth, this
convergence had spawned a strong southwesterly wind, one that grew in
intensity as it made landfall over southern Palestine. By the time it
approached Beersheva, a small village on the edge of the Zin Desert some
twenty-five miles inland, this wind threatened to trigger a khamsin, or
sandstorm.</p>
<p>For the inexperienced, being caught out in the desert during a
khamsin can be unsettling. While it shares some of the properties of a
severe thunderstorm—the same drop in barometric pressure beforehand, the
same prelude of buffeting wind—the fact that sand is falling rather than
water means visibility can rapidly drop to just a few feet, and the
constant raking of sand against the body, coating the nose and mouth and
collecting in every crevice of clothing, can induce a feeling of
suffocation. In the grip of this sensation, the mind can easily seize
upon the worst idea—to journey on, to attempt to fight one’s way out of
the storm. Men routinely become lost and die acting on this impulse.</p>
<p>But the three young British men waiting in Beersheva that afternoon
were not inexperienced. They had lingered an extra day in the village— a
lonely outpost of perhaps eight hundred inhabitants best known as a
watering hole for passing camel caravans—in expectation of the arrival
of an expedition party led by two Americans. By dusk, however, there was
still no sign of the Americans, and what had earlier appeared no more
threatening than a dull brown haze in the west had now formed up into a
mile-high wall of approaching sand. Shortly after dark, the khamsin
rolled in.</p>
<p>Throughout that night, the storm raged. In the small house the
British men shared, sand spattered against the shuttered windows like
driven rain, and all their efforts to seal the place couldn’t prevent
them and everything else inside from becoming coated in a fine layer of
desert dust. By dawn, the winds had abated somewhat, enough that the
risen sun appeared as a pale silvery orb in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>The khamsin finally died off in early afternoon, allowing the
residents of Beersheva to emerge from their homes and tents and move
about. It was then that the Britons received some news of the Americans.
Apparently caught out by the impending storm, they had drawn camp the
previous evening in the desert just a few miles east of town. The three
men saddled their camels and made for the American camp.</p>
<p>Considering the surrounding desolation, the opulence they found there
made for a rather bizarre spectacle. Along with a couple of horse-drawn
carts hauling silage for the party’s herd of pack animals were several
more to carry its larger “field furniture.” Now that the khamsin had
passed, the native orderlies were busily breaking camp, including
dismantling the two very fine and spacious Bell tents—undoubtedly
purchased from one of the better expedition outfitters in London or New
York—that were the habitations of the two young Americans leading the
expedition. These men, both in their midtwenties and clad in Western
field suits and bowler hats, were named William Yale and Rudolf
McGovern. As they explained to their British visitors, they were in
southern Palestine as part of a Grand Tour of the Holy Land, an
adventure that when the sandstorm hit had become a bit more than they
bargained for.</p>
<p>But there was something about the Americans that didn’t quite add up.
Although they were well dressed and obviously traveling in high style,
there was little about the men—McGovern small and reserved, Yale
barrel-chested with a boxer’s rough-hewn face—that suggested them as
either natural traveling companions or likely candidates for a
pilgrimage tour of biblical sites. Then there was their demeanor.
Encountering other foreigners in this lonely corner of Syria was such a
novelty that it tended to induce a kind of instant camaraderie, but
there was none of this with Yale and McGovern. To the contrary, the
Americans appeared flustered, even perturbed, by the arrival of the
Britons, and it seemed that only the dictates of desert hospitality
compelled Yale—clearly the dominant personality of the two—to invite
their guests into the main dining tent and to dispatch one of their camp
followers to prepare tea.</p>
<p>But if the Americans seemed peculiar, William Yale had precisely the
same reaction to his British visitors. The oldest—and the leader of the
group, in Yale’s estimation—was a dark-haired, hawk-faced man in his
midthirties clad in a well-worn British army uniform. His companions
were in civilian dress and quite a bit younger, one in his midtwenties
perhaps, while the third appeared to be a mere teenager. Most puzzling
to Yale, the two older men barely spoke. Instead, it was the “teenager”
who commandeered the conversation in the tent and chattered like a
magpie. He was very slight and slender, with a heavy-featured face that
Yale found almost repellent, but his most arresting feature was his
eyes; they were light blue and piercingly intense.</p>
<p>The young visitor explained that he and his companions were in the
region to conduct an archaeological survey of biblical-era ruins for a
British organization called the Palestine Exploration Fund. He then
proceeded to regale his American hosts with stories of his own
adventures in the Near East, stories so voluble and engaging that it
took Yale quite some time to realize they masked a kind of
interrogation.</p>
<p>“His chatter was sprinkled with a stream of questions—seemingly quite
innocent questions—about us and our plans. He assumed that we were
tourists traveling in grand style to see the famous ruins of the Sinai
and Palestine. It was not until after our visitors had left that we
realized that this seemingly inexperienced, youthful enthusiast had most
successfully pumped us dry.”</p>
<p>It would be some time before he knew it, but William Yale had just
had his first encounter with Thomas Edward Lawrence, soon to become
better known as Lawrence of Arabia. It would also be some time before he
learned that Lawrence had only feigned interest in the Americans’ Holy
Land tour in order to toy with them, that he had known all along their
story was false.</p>
<p>In reality, William Yale and Rudolf McGovern were agents of the
Standard Oil Company of New York, and they were in Palestine on a secret
mission in search of oil. Under orders from Standard headquarters, they
had spent the previous three months posing as wealthy young men of
leisure—“playboys,” in the parlance of the day—on the Holy Land tourist
circuit. While upholding that cover story, they had quietly slipped off
to excavate along the Dead Sea and to take geological soundings in the
Judean foothills.</p>
<p>But if the playboy tale had held the ring of plausibility during
their earlier wanderings—at least Judea had ruins and the Dead Sea
figured prominently in the Bible—it became rather suspect once they
veered off for the forlorn outpost of Beersheva. It was downright
laughable when considering Yale and McGovern’s ultimate destination: a
desolate massif of stone rising up out of the desert some twenty miles
southeast of Beersheva known as Kornub.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not the khamsin but the growing improbability of
their cover story that had kept the Americans out of Beersheva the night
before. As they had approached the village, the oilmen had been alerted
to the presence of the three Britons. Anxious to avoid a meeting and the
awkward questions likely to arise, they had chosen to pitch camp in the
desert instead, with the intention of slipping into Beersheva at first
light, quickly gathering up supplies for their onward journey, and
stealing away before being detected. The slow-moving khamsin had
obviously put an end to that plan, and as he’d waited out the storm that
morning, Yale had feared it was only a matter of time before the
foreigners in Beersheva learned of their desert campsite and put in an
appearance—an apprehension confirmed when the three men rode up.</p>
<p>But what Yale also couldn’t have known was that his efforts at
concealment were quite pointless, that this seemingly impromptu meeting
in the desert was anything but. The previous day, Lawrence and his
colleagues on the archaeological expedition had received a cable from
the British consulate in Jerusalem alerting them to the presence of the
American oilmen in the area, and they had lingered in Beersheva for the
express purpose of intercepting Yale and McGovern and learning what they
were up to.</p>
<p>If this seemed an odd mission for an archaeological survey team to
undertake, there was rather more to that story, too. Although it was
technically true that Lawrence and Leonard Woolley—the other civilian in
the tent, and a respected archaeologist—were in southern Palestine in
search of biblical ruins, that project was merely a fig leaf for a far
more sensitive one, an elaborate covert operation being run by the
British military. Ottoman government officials certainly knew of the
Palestine Exploration Fund survey in the Zin Desert—they had approved
it, after all—but they knew nothing of the five British military survey
teams operating under the PEF banner who at that very moment were
scattered across the desert quietly mapping the Ottoman Empire’s
southwestern frontier. Overseeing that covert operation was the
uniformed third visitor to the American camp, Captain Stewart Francis
Newcombe of the Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>What had taken place outside Beersheva, then, was a rather complex
game of bluff, one in which one side had rummaged about for the truth
behind the other’s fiction, even as it sought to uphold its own
framework of fiction.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE AND YALE weren’t the only young foreigners with suspect
agendas wandering about the Holy Land that mid-January. Just fifty miles
to the north of Beersheva, in the city of Jerusalem, a
thirty-three-year-old German scholar named Curt Prüfer was also plotting
his future.</p>
<p>In Prüfer’s physical appearance were few clues to suggest him as an
intriguing figure. Quite to the contrary. The German stood just five
foot eight, with narrow, sloping shoulders, and his thin thatch of
brownish blond hair framed a bland, thin face most noteworthy for its
lack of distinguishing characteristics, the sort of face that naturally
blends into a crowd. Adding to this air of innocuousness was Prüfer’s
voice. He spoke in a permanent soft, feathery whisper, as if he’d spent
his entire life in a library, although this condition was actually the
result of a botched throat operation in childhood that had scarred his
vocal cords. To many who met the young German scholar, his modest frame
together with that voice conveyed an aura of effeminacy, an estimation
likely to be fortified should they happen to learn the subject of the
dissertation that had earned him his doctorate: a learned study on the
Egyptian dramatic form known as shadow plays. In mid-January 1914,
Prüfer was waiting in Jerusalem for the arrival of a friend, a Bavarian
landscape painter of middling repute, with whom he’d made plans to
conduct an extended tour of the Upper Nile aboard a luxury dhow.</p>
<p>But just as with the men gathered in the tent outside Beersheva,
there was an altogether different side to Dr. Curt Prüfer. For the
previous several years, he had served as the Oriental secretary to the
German embassy in Cairo, a position ideally suited to both his
appearance and demeanor. Removed from the policymaking deliberations of
the senior diplomatic staff, the Oriental secretary was tasked to
quietly keep tabs on the social and political undercurrents of the
country, to maintain a low profile and report back. In that capacity,
Prüfer’s life in Cairo had been a never-ending social whirl, a perpetual
roster of meetings and teas and dinners with Egypt’s most prominent
journalists, businessmen, and politicians.</p>
<p>His social circle had included more controversial figures, too. With
Germany vying with its rival, Great Britain, for influence in the
region, Prüfer had surreptitiously cultivated alliances with a wide
array of Egyptian dissidents seeking to end British control of their
homeland: nationalists, royalists, religious zealots. Fluent in Arabic
as well as a half dozen other languages, in 1911 the German Oriental
secretary had traveled across Egypt and Syria disguised as a Bedouin to
foment anti-British sentiment among the tribes. The following year, he
had attempted to recruit Egyptian mujahideen to join their Arab brethren
in Libya against an invading Italian army.</p>
<p>In these varied efforts, Curt Prüfer had eventually fallen foul of
the first rule of his position: to stay in the background. Alerted to
his agent provocateur activities, the British secret police in Egypt had
quietly compiled a lengthy dossier on the Oriental secretary, and bided
their time on when to use it. When finally they did, Prüfer was
effectively persona non grata. After enduring the ignominy for as long
as he could, he had tendered his resignation from the German diplomatic
service in late 1913. It was this that had brought him to Jerusalem that
January. Once his friend, the artist Richard von Below, arrived from
Germany, the two would depart for Egypt and their luxury cruise up the
Nile. That journey was scheduled to last some five months, and while von
Below painted, Prüfer intended to busy himself composing travelogue
articles for magazines back in Germany, along with updating entries for
the famous German travel guide, Baedeker’s. It was to mark something of
a return to Prüfer’s academic roots, his extended foray into the messy
arena of international politics consigned to the past.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Maybe his spying activities were just put on hiatus,
for on his upcoming cruise, Curt Prüfer would be traveling along the
very lifeline of British-ruled Egypt, would be given the opportunity to
glimpse firsthand its defensive fortifications and port facilities, to
quietly take the pulse of Egyptian public opinion. And while it might
appear that the exposed and disgraced former Oriental secretary was
sailing into an unsettled future that January of 1914, he now held at
least one conviction that gave his life a strong sense of direction: it
was the British who had destroyed his diplomatic career; it was the
British upon whom he would take his revenge.</p>
<p>Toward achieving this, he could draw on another rather surprising
aspect of his personality. His aura of innocuousness notwithstanding,
Curt Prüfer was a consummate charmer, and had a reputation as a
notorious seducer of women. In Cairo, whatever affections he felt for
his wife, a doughty American woman thirteen years his senior, had been
shared between a string of mistresses. Since arriving in Jerusalem, he
had taken up with a young and beautiful Russian Jewish émigré doctor
named Minna Weizmann, better known to her friends and family as Fanny.
In just a little over a year’s time, as Germany’s counterintelligence
chief in wartime Syria, Prüfer would come up with the idea of recruiting
Jewish émigrés to infiltrate British-held Egypt and spy for the
Fatherland. Among the first spies Prüfer would send into enemy territory
would be his lover, Fanny Weizmann.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>JUST SEVENTY MILES to the north of Jerusalem that January, there was
another man about to embark on a double life. His name was Aaron
Aaronsohn. A thirty-eight-year-old Jewish émigré from Romania, Aaronsohn
was already recognized as one of the preeminent agricultural scientists,
or agronomists, in the Middle East, a reputation cemented by his 1906
discovery of the genetic forebear to wheat. With funding from American
Jewish philanthropists, in 1909 he had established the Jewish
Agricultural Experiment Station outside the village of Athlit, and for
the past five years had tirelessly experimented with all manner of
plants and trees in hopes of returning the arid Palestinian region of
Syria to the verdant garden it had once been.</p>
<p>This ambition had a political component. A committed Zionist, as
early as 1911 Aaronsohn had begun to articulate a scheme whereby a vast
swath of Palestine might be wrested away from the Ottoman Empire and
reconstituted as a Jewish homeland. Other Zionists had expressed this
vision before, of course, but it was Aaronsohn, with his encyclopedic
knowledge of the region’s flora and soil conditions and aquifers, who
first appreciated how it might practically be accomplished, how the
Jewish diaspora might return to its ancestral homeland and prosper by
making the desert bloom.</p>
<p>In the near future, Aaronsohn would perceive the chance to bring this
dream closer to fruition, and he would seize it. Under the cover of
advising the local government on agricultural matters, he would
establish an extensive spy ring across the breadth of Palestine, and
provide the Ottomans’ British enemies with some of their most invaluable
battlefield intelligence. The agronomist would then go on to play a
signal role in promoting the cause of a Jewish homeland in the capitals
of Europe. Somewhat ironically, his chief confederate in that endeavor
would be the older brother of Curt Prüfer’s lover-spy, Fanny Weizmann,
and the future first president of Israel: Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>THE LURE OF the East: whether to conquer or explore or exploit, it
has exerted its pull on the West for a thousand years. That lure brought
wave after wave of Christian Crusaders to the Near East over a
three-hundred-year span in the Middle Ages. More recently, it brought a
conquering French general with pharaonic fantasies named Napoleon
Bonaparte to Egypt in the 1790s, Europe’s greatest archaeologists in the
1830s, and hordes of Western oil barons, wildcatters, and con men to the
shores of the Caspian Sea in the 1870s. For a similar variety of
reasons, in the early years of the twentieth century it brought together
four young men of adventure: Thomas Edward Lawrence, William Yale, Curt
Prüfer, and Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>At the time, the regions these men traveled were still a part of the
Ottoman Empire, one of the greatest imperial powers the world had ever
known. From its birthplace in a tiny corner of the mountainous region of
Anatolia in modern-day Turkey, that empire had steadily expanded until
by the early 1600s it encompassed an area rivaling that of the Roman
imperium at its height: from the gates of Vienna in the north to the
southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, from the shores of the western
Mediterranean clear across to the port of Basra in modern-day Iraq.</p>
<p>But that had been then. By the second decade of the twentieth
century, the Ottoman Empire had long been in a state of seemingly
terminal decline. The proverbial “sick man of Europe,” its epitaph had
begun to be written as far back as the 1850s, and in the intervening
years no fewer than five of the imperial powers of Europe had taken
turns snatching away great swaths of its territory. That the Ottomans
had managed to avoid complete destruction thus far was due both to their
skill at playing off those competing European powers and to no small
measure of improbable good luck. In 1914, however, all that was about to
change. By guessing wrong—very wrong—in the calamitous war just then
descending, the Ottomans would not only bring on their own doom but
unleash forces of such massive disintegration that the world is still
dealing with the repercussions a century later.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-2-a-very-unusual-type">Chapter 2 A Very Unusual
Type</h4>
<p>Can you make room on your excavations next winter for a young Oxford
graduate, T. Lawrence, who has been with me at Carchemish? He is a very
unusual type, and a man whom I feel quite sure you would approve of and
like.… I may add that he is extremely indifferent to what he eats or how
he lives.</p>
<p>DAVID HOGARTH TO EGYPTOLOGIST FLINDERS PETRIE, 1911</p>
<p>I think it time I dedicated a letter to you,” Thomas Edward Lawrence
wrote his father on August 20, 1906, “although it does not make the
least difference in style, since all my letters are equally bare of
personal information. The buildings I try to describe will last longer
than we will, so it is only fitting that they should have the greater
space.”</p>
<p>True to his word, Lawrence spent the rest of that letter imparting
absolutely no information about himself, not even bothering to mention
how he had spent his eighteenth birthday four days earlier. Instead, he
used the space to describe in minute detail the structural peculiarities
of a fourteenth-century castle he had just visited.</p>
<p>Lawrence, on recess from the Oxford High School for Boys, was
spending that summer bicycling through northwestern France. The bicycle
had only recently become widely available to the European general
public, a result of design innovations and mass production, and it had
sparked something of a craze among the British middle class for cycling
tours of the European countryside. Lawrence’s trip was on a wholly
different scale, however: a nearly thousand-mile trek that took him to
most every notable castle and cathedral in the Normandy region.</p>
<p>The notes he took of these places formed the basis of Lawrence’s
letters to his family back in Oxford. While he often prefaced them with
brief expressions of concern for his mother’s purportedly frail health,
the chief characteristic of most of his correspondence was its utter
impersonality, the same disquisitional tone as adopted in that to his
father.</p>
<p>In some respects, this element of emotional constriction was probably
not unusual for a member of a British middle-class family at the end of
the Victorian age. It may have been heightened in the Lawrence household
by its male preponderance—a family of five boys and no girls—but this
was a segment of society that prized self-control and understatement,
where children were expected to be studious and respectful, and where a
parent’s greatest gift to those children was not an indulgent affection
but rather a sober religious grounding and a good education. It was also
a segment of society that held to a simple and comfortable worldview.
While radical political ideas were starting to find flower among the
working class, the British middle class still adhered to a social
hierarchy based less on attained wealth than on ancestry and accent, a
caste system that rigidly dictated nearly every aspect of social life—in
some respects, even more rigidly than a half century before. If
stultifying, this stratification also meant that everyone knew his
place, the station in life to which he might reasonably aspire. To the
degree possible, social and economic advancement was obtained through
the “godly virtues” of modesty, self-reliance, diligence, and
thrift.</p>
<p>Perhaps the least questioned tenet of the time was the notion that
the British Empire now stood at the very apex of modern civilization,
and that it was the special burden of this empire to spread its
enlightenment—whether through commerce, the Bible, the gun, or some
combination of all three—to the world’s less fortunate cultures and
races. While this conviction extended to all segments of British
society, it had special resonance for the middle class, since it was
from precisely this social stratum that the chief custodians of
empire—its midlevel military field officers and colonial
administrators—were drawn. This, too, undoubtedly contributed to an
emotional distance in such families; from the time of their children’s
birth, parents had to steel themselves to the likelihood that some of
their offspring, especially the males, might ship out to a remote
outpost of empire, not to be seen again for decades, if ever.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising, then, that the British middle-class
generation coming of age in the early 1900s was marked by a certain
blitheness, so much so that in recalling their growing up many years
later, one of Lawrence’s brothers could write without a hint of irony,
“We had a very happy childhood, which was never marred by a single
quarrel between any of us.”</p>
<p>But in at least one respect, there was something altogether unusual
about the Lawrence family on Oxford’s Polstead Road, and it undoubtedly
added to the emotional austerity in that household. Quite unbeknownst to
the neighbors and to most of their own children, Thomas and Sarah
Lawrence were harboring a scandalous secret: they were essentially
living as fugitives. The key to that secret began with the family
surname, which wasn’t really Lawrence.</p>
<p>Thomas Lawrence’s real name was Thomas Robert Tighe Chapman, and in
his prior incarnation he had been a prominent member of the Anglo-Irish
landed aristocracy. After being educated at Eton, the future baronet had
returned to Ireland and, in the early 1870s, took up the pleasant role
of gentleman farmer of his family’s estate in County Westmeath. He
married a woman from another wealthy Anglo-Irish family, with whom he
soon had four daughters.</p>
<p>But Chapman’s gilded existence began to unravel when he started an
affair with the governess to his young daughters, a twenty-four-year-old
Scottish woman named Sarah Junner. By the time Chapman’s wife learned of
the affair in early 1888, Sarah already had one child with Thomas—an
infant son secreted in a rented apartment in Dublin—and a second was on
the way. Refused a divorce by his wife, the aristocrat was forced to
choose between his two families.</p>
<p>Given the laws and moral strictures of the Victorian era, the
consequences of that choice could hardly have been more profound. If he
opted to stay with Sarah Junner, Thomas Chapman would not only be
stripped of most of his family inheritance, but his four daughters would
have great difficulty ever marrying due to the taint of family scandal.
Worse was what would lie in store for his and Sarah’s offspring. As
illegitimates, they would be effectively barred from many of the better
schools and higher professions that, had they been legally born to the
Chapman name, would be their birthright. Certainly, the most prudent
course was for Thomas to bundle Sarah back to her native Scotland with a
supporting stipend for herself and her children, a rather common
arrangement of the day when servant girls got “into trouble” with their
masters. Instead, Chapman chose to stay with Sarah.</p>
<p>After renouncing his claim to the family fortune in favor of his
younger brother, Thomas left Ireland with Sarah in mid-1888 for the
anonymity of a small village in northern Wales called Tremadoc. There,
the couple assumed the alias of Sarah’s mother’s maiden name, Lawrence,
and in August of that year Sarah gave birth to their second child, a son
they named Thomas Edward.</p>
<p>But Wales brought the couple no peace of mind. Getting by on a modest
annuity from the Chapman family estate but living in constant fear that
they might one day encounter someone who knew them from their former
lives, the Lawrences began a furtive, peripatetic existence: Tremadoc
was soon given up for an even more remote village in northern Scotland,
then it was on to the Isle of Man, followed by a couple of years in a
small French town, followed by two more years in a secluded hunting
lodge on the south coast of England. Compounding the isolation in these
places—in each, the Lawrences rented homes on village outskirts or
surrounded by high stone walls—Thomas severed ties to nearly all his
former friends, while Sarah rarely left the security and anonymity of
the family home.</p>
<p>“You can imagine how your mother and I have suffered all these
years,” Thomas Lawrence would confide in a posthumous letter to his
sons, “not knowing what day we might be recognized by some one and our
sad history published far and wide.”</p>
<p>In light of this driving fear, the Lawrences’ decision to move to
Oxford in 1896 must have been a downright harrowing one. For the first
time, the couple would not only be living in the center of a large town
but, given Thomas’s aristocratic and educational background, in a place
where it was very likely they would cross paths with someone from their
past. But against this was the opportunity for their sons—now grown to
four in number, with a fifth on the way—to receive a good education,
maybe even to ultimately win admission to Oxford University, and so the
Lawrences took the gamble. The price for this heightened exposure,
however, was a family drawn even tighter into itself, the boys’ lives
circumscribed in comparison to those of their classmates, but for
reasons those boys couldn’t begin to fathom. All except Thomas Edward,
that is. With the move to Oxford, the eight-year-old was now settling
into the sixth home of his young life, and at some point during his
first years at Polstead Road he partially unraveled the family secret.
He kept the information to himself, however, never confronting his
parents nor confiding in any of his brothers.</p>
<p>At the Oxford High School for Boys, Lawrence was known as an
exceptionally bright but quiet student, one for whom team sports held no
appeal and who, if not engaged in a solitary pursuit, preferred the
company of his brothers or just a very small group of close friends. His
bookish side—he had been a voracious reader even as a young child—was
offset by a love of bicycle riding and a fondness for practical jokes.
But there was something else as well. By early adolescence, “Ned,” as he
was known to family and friends, had developed the habit of constantly
testing the limits of his endurance, whether in how far or fast he could
bicycle or how long he could go without food or sleep or water. This
wasn’t the usual stuff of boyhood self-testing, but protracted ordeals
that, through a kind of iron will, Ned could sustain to the point of
collapse. So pronounced was this tendency that even his headmaster in
the fourth form (equivalent to American eighth grade) took notice: “He
was unlike the boys of his time,” Henry Hall wrote in a remembrance of
Lawrence, “for even in his schooldays he had a strong leaning toward the
Stoics, an apparent indifference towards pleasure or pain.”</p>
<p>Some of this may have stemmed from an increasingly severe home
environment. As the Lawrence boys grew older, Sarah, the disciplinarian
of the family, became both more religious and more given to physical
punishment. These were not mere spankings, but rather protracted
whippings with belts and switches, and in the remembrance of the
Lawrence boys, Ned was by far her most frequent target. It established a
disturbing pattern between mother and son. That Ned made a point of
never crying or asking for leniency during these whippings—to the
contrary, he seemed to derive satisfaction from his ability to display
no emotion whatsoever—often had the effect of making the punishments
worse, so much so that on several occasions the normally cowed Thomas
Lawrence intervened to put a stop to them.</p>
<p>At around the age of fifteen, Ned abruptly stopped growing. With his
brothers all eventually surpassing him in height, he became acutely
aware of his shortness—variously pegged at between five foot three and
five foot five—and this seemed to deepen an already pronounced shyness.
About the same time, he developed a fascination with the tales of
medieval knights, and with archaeology. He began taking long bicycle
trips to churches in the English countryside, where he would conduct
brass rubbings of memorial plaques. With his best friend of the time, he
scoured the construction sites of new buildings going up in Oxford in
search of old relics, and came upon a good number of them. These finds,
mostly glass and pottery shards from the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, soon led Ned to the Ashmolean Museum in central Oxford.</p>
<p>With the distinction of being the oldest public museum in Britain,
and with an emphasis on charting the confluence of Eastern and Western
cultures, the Ashmolean was to play a transformative role in Lawrence’s
life. Encouraged by its curators to whom he brought his construction
site finds, the teenager soon became a familiar figure around the
museum, dropping in after school, helping with odd chores on the
weekends. For Lawrence, the Ashmolean became a window onto the world
that lay beyond Oxford, its artifacts giving physicality to all the
places and civilizations he constantly read about. Testament to his
fascination with the past, as well as his already fierce streak of
self-sufficiency, was that extended bicycle tour of the castles and
cathedrals of Normandy in the summer of 1906.</p>
<p>Earning high marks at high school, in the autumn of 1907 Lawrence was
admitted to Jesus College of Oxford University, there to specialize in
history. With an abiding interest in both military history and the
Middle Ages, he fashioned a thesis focusing on the architecture of
medieval castles and fortifications. To that end, for the summer of 1908
recess, he plotted a journey that dwarfed his earlier excursion to
Normandy, an elaborate twenty-four-hundred-mile bicycle trek that would
take him to nearly every significant such structure across the breadth
of France. Staying in cheap pensions, or camping in the rough, he
routinely pedaled more than a hundred miles a day as he went from one
ancient castle or battlement to the next. At each, he took photographs,
made sketches, and wrote up exhaustive notes before getting back on his
bicycle and pedaling on.</p>
<p>Initially, his letters back to Polstead Road assumed the same dry,
even tedious tone of those from his earlier travels. But then something
changed. It happened on August 2, 1908, when Lawrence reached the
village of Aigues-Mortes and he saw the Mediterranean Sea for the first
time. In the letter home describing that day, Lawrence displayed an
exuberance and sense of wonder that was quite out of character.</p>
<p>“I bathed today in the sea,” he wrote, “the great sea, the greatest
in the world; you can imagine my feelings.… I felt that at last I had
reached the way to the South, and all the glorious East—Greece,
Carthage, Egypt, Tyre, Syria, Italy, Spain, Sicily, Crete—they were all
there, and all within reach of me.… Oh I must get down here—farther
out—again! Really this getting to the sea has almost overturned my
mental balance; I would accept a passage for Greece tomorrow.”</p>
<p>It was almost as if he were describing a religious epiphany. In a
way, he was.</p>
<p>When Lawrence returned to Oxford and his studies that autumn, he
began to hatch a new—and infinitely more ambitious—journey, one that
would take him to the furthermost region of those he had contemplated
that day in Aigues-Mortes. Among the first to hear of this new scheme
was a man named David Hogarth.</p>
<p>A noted archaeologist who had worked and traveled extensively in the
Near East, Hogarth had only recently taken up the position of director,
or keeper, of the Ashmolean Museum. From the Ashmolean’s assistant
curators he had undoubtedly heard mention of T. E. Lawrence—that the shy
Oxford student had been a fixture around the museum since his early
teens, that he showed a keen curiosity in archaeological work—but this
did not at all prepare Hogarth for the diminutive figure ushered into
his office one day in January 1909.</p>
<p>After his tour of the castles in France, Lawrence had now radically
expanded the idea for his senior thesis at Oxford. Put simply, there
just wasn’t much new to be said or discovered by examining European
medieval fortifications in isolation, whereas one of the enduring
mysteries in the study of military architecture was the degree to which
innovations in medieval battlements were of Western or Eastern origin:
had the Christian Crusaders learned from their Muslim enemies while
invading the Holy Land, or had the Muslims copied from the Crusaders? As
Lawrence explained to Hogarth, what he proposed was a comprehensive
survey of the Crusader castles of the Syrian Near East—and, in typical
Lawrence fashion, not merely a visit to some of the more notable ones,
but a tour of practically all of them. Lawrence planned to make this
trek during the next Oxford summer recess, and alone.</p>
<p>Hogarth, already thrown by Lawrence’s modest stature—he was now
twenty but could easily pass for fifteen—was aghast at the plan. The
expedition Lawrence proposed meant a journey of well over a thousand
miles across deserts and rugged mountain ranges, where whatever roads
and trails existed had only deteriorated since Roman times. What’s more,
summer was the absolute worst time to travel in Syria, a season when
temperatures routinely reached 120 degrees in the interior. As Hogarth
recounted the conversation to a Lawrence biographer, when he tried to
diplomatically raise these issues, he was met with a steely resolve.</p>
<p>“I’m going,” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>“Well, have you got the money?” Hogarth asked. “You’ll want a guide
and servants to carry your tent and baggage.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to walk.”</p>
<p>The scheme was becoming more preposterous all the time. “Europeans
don’t walk in Syria,” Hogarth explained. “It isn’t safe or
pleasant.”</p>
<p>“Well,” Lawrence said, “I do.”</p>
<p>Startled by the young man’s brusque determination, Hogarth implored
him to at least seek the counsel of a true expert. This was Charles
Montagu Doughty, an explorer who had traversed much of the region
Lawrence proposed to visit, and whose book Travels in Arabia Deserta was
considered the definitive travelogue of the time. When contacted,
Doughty was even more dismissive of the plan than Hogarth.</p>
<p>“In July and August the heat is very severe by day and night,” he
wrote Lawrence, “even at the altitude of Damascus (over 2,000 feet). It
is a land of squalor, where a European can find little refreshment. Long
daily marches on foot a prudent man who knows the country would, I
think, consider out of the question. The populations only know their own
wretched life and look upon any European wandering in their country with
at best a veiled ill will.”</p>
<p>In case he hadn’t sufficiently made his point, Doughty continued,
“The distances to be traversed are very great. You would have nothing to
draw upon but the slight margin of strength which you bring with you
from Europe. Insufficient food, rest and sleep would soon begin to
tell.”</p>
<p>Such counsel might have dissuaded most people, but not Lawrence. For
a young man already driven to test the very limits of his endurance,
Doughty’s letter read like a dare.</p>
<p>HE CERTAINLY LOOKED the part. With his bull shoulders, calloused
hands, and Teddy Roosevelt handlebar mustache, William Yale, the new
engineering level-man hired on to work the Culebra Cut in the summer of
1908, blended right in with the tens of thousands of other workers who
had descended upon the jungles of Central America. They had come to take
part in the most ambitious construction project in the history of
mankind, the building of the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Few of his coworkers might have guessed that in fact William Yale had
no engineering background at all; instead, he had obtained the position
of level-man, and the premium salary it garnered, through the efforts of
a well-connected college friend. Surely even fewer might have guessed
that the twenty-one-year-old—by all accounts a tireless and
uncomplaining worker—was operating in an environment utterly alien to
him, that as a scion of one of America’s wealthiest and most illustrious
families he had until very recently lived a life of privilege
extraordinary even by the excessive standards of the day. To the
American archetype of the self-made man, William Yale represented the
dark and polar opposite, one born to tremendous advantage but who had
lost it all in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Dating their arrival in America to the mid-1600s, the Yales of New
England were a quintessential Yankee blueblood family, one that for 250
years had built an ever greater fortune through shipping, manufacturing,
and exploiting all the riches the New World had to offer. True to their
Presbyterian ethos, the Yales were also a family that believed in good
works and education; in 1701, Elihu Yale, William’s great-great-uncle,
helped found the university in New Haven that still bears the family
name.</p>
<p>Born in 1887, William certainly appeared destined to live in the
familial tradition. The third son of William Henry Yale, an
industrialist and Wall Street speculator, he grew up on a four-acre
estate in Spuyten Duyvil, the bluff at the southwestern tip of the Bronx
in New York City. With its commanding views of both Manhattan and the
Hudson River, Spuyten Duyvil had long been favored by New York’s moneyed
class seeking to escape the noise and grime of the city, and the Yale
estate was among the grandest. Through early childhood, William and his
siblings, four brothers and two sisters, were educated by private tutors
at the family mansion, took dance and social etiquette classes at
Dodsworth’s, Manhattan’s preeminent dancing academy, and spent summers
at the family’s vast forested estate in the Black River valley of
upstate New York. Like his two older brothers before him, for high
school William was shipped off to the prestigious Lawrenceville School
outside Princeton.</p>
<p>But even from an early age, the Yale boys probably had broader
horizons than most other male offspring of the New York pampered set.
This was due to their father. Beyond being an ardent political supporter
of Teddy Roosevelt—the Yales fit squarely into the progressive
Republican mold—William Henry Yale also subscribed to Roosevelt’s
notions of the ideal American man and of the dangers of
“over-civilization,” code for effeminacy. The true man, in this
worldview, was a rugged individualist, physically fit as well as
intellectually cultured, as equally at home leading men into battle or
shooting big game on the prairie as chatting with the ladies in the
salon. To this end, William Henry frequently took his sons on extended
trips into the American wilderness and ensured that they were just as
adept at hunting, fishing, and trapping as in displaying the proper
manners at a Spuyten Duyvil garden party.</p>
<p>The “Roosevelt Man” paradigm seemed to take especially firm root in
his namesake third son. During his summer break from Lawrenceville in
1902, fourteen-year-old William traveled with his father to Cuba to see
the sights of the island, recently “liberated” from Spain, as well as to
visit the family’s newly acquired copper mines. Rather than immediately
entering Yale University after high school—and there was never any
question of which university all Yale boys would attend—William took a
year off, and spent part of that time accompanying a wealthy friend and
his family on a grand tour of the American West aboard their private
railcar.</p>
<p>But much like T. E. Lawrence, when William Yale contemplated
adulthood, he already regarded the conventional path so clearly
delineated for him with an element of dread. “The routine life I had
seen other young men take up seemed tasteless and meaningless,” he would
later write. “The thought of doing over and over again the same thing
day after day, year after year was maddening to me. How others lived in
the same town they grew up, married girls they had known all their
lives, lived in the houses their families owned, went down, day in and
day out, to their father’s businesses, I could not understand.”</p>
<p>Then the dilemma was settled for him. In October 1907, a panic on
Wall Street sparked a nationwide run on banks and nearly halved the
value of the New York Stock Exchange in a matter of days. Among the
hardest hit by the panic was the heavily leveraged William Henry Yale,
whose enormous fortune was virtually wiped out. When William came home
that Christmas, having just started his freshman year at Yale, his
father delivered almost unimaginable news: the nineteen-year-old student
would now have to work to help cover his educational expenses; he was
essentially on his own.</p>
<p>William’s reaction to this news was mixed: shock, understandably, at
the abrupt end to his privileged existence, but a shock leavened by a
sense of liberation. Here was the chance to pursue the adventurous life
he dreamed of. That summer, he took a leave from the university and
shipped out to Panama.</p>
<p>That six-month sojourn in Central America proved a transformative
experience. Instead of heirs and socialites, Yale’s companions now were
a motley and licentious crew of international adventurers and
construction vagabonds, rough-cut men who taught the fallen aristocrat
how to work and how to drink; by Yale’s own account, it was only his
mother’s puritanical indoctrination that enabled him to withstand the
determined appeals of the female professionals at the Navajo Bar in
Panama City and escape with his chastity intact.</p>
<p>But if Panama opened a door, it was still a daunting one to step
through. Upon returning to New Haven and completing his degree, William
Yale found himself in a quandary. “The bottom had dropped out of my
world. To ever get to where I could marry and live the life I was
brought up to expect seemed utterly hopeless. I hadn’t the foggiest idea
how to make money.… What to do now? I was penniless, in debt, and knew
nothing of the world, and at heart was intimidated by it.”</p>
<p>He would eventually find an answer to that question. It would take
the form of a notice soliciting applicants to the “foreign service
school” of the Standard Oil Company of New York.</p>
<p>ANYONE WHO HAPPENED to be crossing the searingly hot plain west of
Aleppo in northern Syria in early September 1909 would have encountered
a perplexing sight: a young, painfully thin Englishman, a rucksack slung
over his shoulders, tromping along while close on his heels trailed a
squadron of Turkish cavalry.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, T. E. Lawrence had arrived in the remote foothill
town of Sahyun, there to quietly survey yet another Crusader castle, and
the local Ottoman provincial governor, or kaimmakam, had been so amazed
at the sight of the young traveler that he insisted on treating Lawrence
as a visiting dignitary. That meant staying in the governor’s home and
being lavishly waited upon, and it had also meant a personal bodyguard
of cavalrymen when Lawrence set out for the five-day hike to Aleppo.</p>
<p>“It is rather amusing to contemplate a pedestrian guarded carefully
by a troop of light horse [cavalry],” he wrote his family in describing
the incident. “Of course everybody thinks I am mad to walk, and the
escort offered me a mount on the average [of] once a half-hour; they
couldn’t understand my prejudice against anything with four legs.”</p>
<p>Lawrence’s walking tour of Syria that summer was comprised of two
journeys. The first began in the coastal city of Beirut and consisted of
a three-week jaunt south through the mountains of Lebanon to northern
Palestine. After returning to Beirut and resting for a few days, he
embarked on a far more elaborate and punishing trek north.</p>
<p>It was an adventure that changed his life. Everywhere the locals
greeted him with both astonishment and overwhelming generosity. In
village after village, residents would insist he eat with them, or stay
the night as their guest, and despite their crushing poverty, very few
would ever accept payment. “This is a glorious country for wandering
in,” he wrote his father in mid-August, “for hospitality is something
more than a name.”</p>
<p>His letters home conveyed a newfound happiness. In one letter to his
mother at the end of August, he sounded like the modern college student
who fancies that his travels have left him fundamentally transformed: “I
will have such difficulty in becoming English again.”</p>
<p>The difference in Lawrence’s case was that this was to actually prove
true.</p>
<p>Once back in Oxford for his senior year, Lawrence toiled on his
thesis in the pleasant cottage his father had built for him in the
garden of the Polstead Road home. The result carried the accurate if not
exactly beckoning title The Influence of the Crusades on European
Military Architecture—to the End of the XIIth Century.</p>
<p>The Oxford history department examiners were impressed enough by his
original research—then, as now, most theses tended to be compendiums of
others’ work—that Lawrence was awarded first-class honors, the highest
scholastic ranking and one of only ten such awards given by the history
school that year. The distinction greatly enhanced his chances of
pursuing an academic career, his newfound goal, and this was further
helped along when the university arranged a stipend for him to conduct
postgraduate work. Perhaps stemming from his teenaged archaeological
finds in the Oxford construction sites, Lawrence had long had a special
attraction to pottery, and it was to this he turned in his postgraduate
research. To be sure, studying “Medieval Lead-Glazed Pottery from the
11th to the 16th Centuries” sounded a lot less exciting than tramping
about Syria, but it was a first step toward the life he envisioned for
himself.</p>
<p>But it was not to be. In the autumn of 1910, just days after arriving
in France to begin his pottery research, Lawrence learned that David
Hogarth was about to leave for northern Syria, there to oversee the
inauguration of an archaeological dig for the British Museum at the
ancient ruins of Carchemish. Abandoning France, Lawrence hurried back to
Oxford to try to convince Hogarth to take him along.</p>
<p>HE WAS A small, sickly child born into a pitiless family. Even before
reaching adolescence, Curt Prüfer, the only son of a Berlin
schoolteacher, had suffered through a litany of ailments that included
tuberculosis, kidney disease, and diphtheria. It was a failed treatment
for this last affliction that left him with his soft, feathery
voice.</p>
<p>The boy’s frail health apparently did little to pull at the
heartstrings of his parents, Carl and Agnes Prüfer. The father
constantly criticized Curt for his purported laziness, while his mother
rarely showed him affection or even attention. The emotional isolation
didn’t end there. According to Prüfer biographer Donald McKale, Curt had
no childhood friends, and his sole bond of attachment throughout growing
up was to his one sibling, a sister several years his senior. Tellingly,
considering the schoolyard taunts he undoubtedly suffered due to his
voice, the adult Curt Prüfer’s favorite insult, one he would direct at
entire nationalities and even his own married son, was the label of
homosexual.</p>
<p>But in contrast to the spiritual poverty of his home life, Prüfer had
been born into a fantastically exciting and tumultuous period in German
history. In 1871, just ten years before his birth, Otto von Bismarck had
capitalized on Prussia’s crushing victory over France in the
Franco-Prussian War to tear up the centuries-old patchwork of German
principalities and duchies and forge the modern German nation.</p>
<p>Under a state-directed corporatist structure, Germany swiftly went
from a primarily agrarian economy to being one of the most
industrialized nations on earth, linked from one end to the other by a
modern network of railroads, canals, and carriageways. A series of
workers’-rights legislations, as well as the world’s first national
social welfare system, sent fractures through what had been one of the
most rigidly class-stratified societies in Europe. Those fractures were
widened further by the state’s massive expansion of higher education.
Once almost solely the province of the very elite, university was now
accessible to the middle class, so much so that by the turn of the
century they comprised half of all college graduates.</p>
<p>Equally dramatic was the new image and prowess of Germany abroad.
From a dizzying mélange of squabbling fiefdoms—a mélange that Europe’s
established imperial powers had adroitly played off against one another
for centuries—Germany was suddenly becoming an empire in its own right.
Despite being a latecomer in the European “scramble for Africa,” by the
mid-1880s it had established colonies in western, southern, and eastern
Africa; in a fit of grandiosity, it even planted its flag in the South
Pacific island of Samoa, almost precisely the farthest spot from Germany
on the planet.</p>
<p>But if Bismarck created the modern German state, it was another man
who would truly catapult it onto the global stage, and fire the passions
of young Germans like Curt Prüfer in the process. In 1888, Wilhelm II,
the twenty-nine-year-old eldest grandchild of Queen Victoria of England,
ascended to the German throne. With a fondness for military uniforms and
bellicose language, as well as an undying resentment of the other
European royal families, the young kaiser was determined to make his
nation not just a regional power but a world one. This aggressiveness
was of limited concern in other European capitals so long as the true
levers of German authority lay in the steady hands of Chancellor
Bismarck—within the incestuous orbit of European royalty, Wilhelm had
long been pegged as an emotionally unstable but controllable hothead—but
of considerably greater concern when Wilhelm forced Bismarck from office
in 1890 and assumed autocratic powers. Absent the calming influence of
the Iron Chancellor, and surrounding himself with palace sycophants and
the Prussian military elite, Wilhelm nursed himself—and his subjects—on
a particularly toxic nationalist mythology rooted in both a sense of
victimization and superiority: that throughout history, Germany had been
denied its rightful “place in the sun” through the treachery of others,
that this colossal injustice was now to be remedied, through force of
arms if necessary.</p>
<p>For a boy like Curt Prüfer coming of age at this juncture, it could
almost be said that the new Germany created him. By the time he entered
secondary school in 1896, a new national curriculum had been introduced,
one that broke with the European classicist model in favor of one
preaching nationalist pride and the primacy of the state and the
emperor. It found a fervent disciple in the lonely, sickly boy from
Berlin. Soundly rejecting his father’s neosocialist liberalism, Curt
also rebelled against his parents’ narrow petit-bourgeois horizons, in
particular their desire that he follow in Carl Prüfer’s footsteps and
become a schoolteacher. Instead, this German “New Man”—exceptionally
bright and driven despite his father’s harsh estimation—imagined a
wholly different life for himself, and where he saw that life taking him
was east.</p>
<p>Part of that attraction may have stemmed from the political currents
of the day. Among all the jockeying European powers at the close of the
nineteenth century, there was a growing tendency to regard diplomacy as
a zero-sum game—any accord between one’s competitors translated as a
direct loss or threat to oneself—but nowhere was this tendency more
pronounced than in Wilhelm’s paranoia-tinged Germany. Throughout the
1890s, with growing signs of amity between France, Great Britain, and
Russia, an amity spurred in no small part by alarm over Germany’s rapid
militarization, talk of “encirclement” increasingly came into vogue in
Berlin. To escape this encirclement by its imperial rivals—France and
Great Britain to one side, Russia to the other—a boxed-in Germany needed
to look beyond for economic and political expansion, and the region
holding the greatest promise was the Ottoman and Muslim East. This
notion was greatly strengthened in 1898 when the kaiser made a
triumphant tour of the Ottoman world and was royally feted wherever he
went. For patriotic young Germans, the Near East was suddenly a
beckoning frontier.</p>
<p>But for Curt Prüfer, probably the greater attraction derived from the
exotic. At various times throughout the nineteenth century,
archaeological discoveries in the Near East had spawned intense
fascination among the European public, and probably nowhere had this
been more true than in Germany. Dating back to Karl Lepsius’s
expeditions to the Egyptian pyramids in the 1840s and continuing through
Heinrich Schliemann’s excavations of Troy and Mycenae in the 1870s,
German archaeologists had been at the forefront of exploration in the
region, and responsible for many of the greatest finds. By the 1880s,
with German scientists excavating burial tombs in the Luxor region of
Upper Egypt, and Adolf Erman breaking the codes of pharaonic
hieroglyphics at the University of Berlin, a new wave of popular
interest had ushered in the so-called golden age of Egyptology. The
craze captivated the young Prüfer much the way the dawning of the Space
Age would enthrall a later generation. Even as a very young boy, he
devoured the tales of adventure and discovery coming out of the Near
East, and dreamed of the circumstances that might take him there.</p>
<p>That may have remained the stuff of childhood fantasy if not for Curt
Prüfer’s possession of a singular talent, a somewhat curious one in
light of his speech difficulties. He was a prodigy when it came to
mastering foreign languages, one of those rare people who could go from
utter unfamiliarity to near fluency in a matter of months. He had
thoroughly mastered French and English in secondary school, but as a
young man he set his sights much further afield.</p>
<p>In partial acquiescence to his parents’ conventional aspirations, in
1901 the twenty-year-old Prüfer enrolled in the University of Berlin to
study law. At the same time, he took seminars in Oriental languages and
quickly developed a proficiency in Turkish and Arabic, two of the more
difficult languages on earth. Two years later, he dispensed with his
legal studies altogether and, under the pretext that a drier climate
might improve his frail health, moved to southern Italy to study
Italian.</p>
<p>But Italy was not the East, and in that same summer of 1903, Prüfer
set sail for Cairo. It was to be the first of three extended trips he
would make over the next three years, partially supporting himself by
writing travel articles for German cultural magazines as he worked
toward a doctorate in Oriental studies.</p>
<p>Perhaps spurred by his own commoner background, the area of study
Prüfer chose was a very unusual one for a European scholar of the time:
an indigenous theatrical art form known as shadow plays that catered
exclusively to the Egyptian working class. In his dissertation, he
described visiting one of the coffeehouses where these plays were
performed in the Was’a slum of Cairo.</p>
<p>“The galleries and benches on the main floor of this establishment
are packed with people, mostly from the lowest strata of society. Here,
donkey drivers, porters and pushcart vendors sit in a dense throng,
peacefully smoking their hashish pipes. Members of the upper classes do
not dare to enter the Was’a milieu for fear of damaging their good
reputations.”</p>
<p>The same held true for Cairo’s expatriate community, of course,
affording the young German scholar a glimpse into everyday Egyptian life
virtually unique among Europeans. The time he spent in places like Was’a
also enabled Prüfer to thoroughly master colloquial Arabic, a very
different language from that spoken by the genteel class, and a skill
that would stand him in very good stead in the years ahead.</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1906, Prüfer stood at a kind of crossroads. With
his doctorate from the University of Erlangen in hand, he might easily
have landed a teaching position in Germany—and, in what would have been
a nice little turn of revenge, at a far more prestigious level than his
primary schoolteacher father had attained—but he was anxious to return
to the East. In rather quick succession, two strokes of luck were to
make that possible.</p>
<p>That winter, he met Frances Ethel Pinkham, an American woman studying
music in Berlin. A graduate of Wellesley College from a wealthy family
in Lynn, Massachusetts, the thirty-eight-year-old Pinkham was, by the
standards of the day, already well into spinsterhood when she met the
solicitous and charming Oriental scholar thirteen years her junior.
Following a brief romance, and over the fierce objections of Pinkham’s
parents, the couple married that April. Prüfer convinced his bride that
they should move to Egypt so that he could further his studies and,
hopefully, find suitable employment. While Pinkham’s parents back in
Lynn were no doubt aghast at the idea, in Cairo an opportunity for
adventure and advancement soon presented itself to their new
son-in-law.</p>
<p>During his previous stays in Cairo, Prüfer had frequently socialized
with personnel from the German embassy, and these diplomats had been
very impressed by his command of both classic and colloquial Arabic. In
early 1907, with the embassy’s current dragoman, or interpreter, slated
for retirement, Prüfer was asked if he might be interested in the post.
It’s hard to imagine he pondered the offer for more than an instant.
That February, Prüfer became the newest staff member of the German
diplomatic legation to Egypt.</p>
<p>But something else awaited the unprepossessing twenty-six-year-old at
the German embassy: a mentor, one of the most colorful—and in the eyes
of the British, one of the most dangerous—personalities ever to stalk
the Middle East.</p>
<p>THE RUINS OF Carchemish are situated on a rocky bluff over a bend of
the Euphrates River, flush on the border between modern-day Turkey and
Syria. Around it are rolling plains gradually giving over to grassy
foothills. Overlooking an important ford of the Euphrates, the bluff has
been inhabited for at least five thousand years, but achieved its
greatest prominence at about 1100 BC during the Late Bronze Age. At that
time, Carchemish was a principal city of the Hittite civilization,
centered in the Anatolia region just to the north, and was well known to
both the Egyptian pharaohs and the authors of the Old Testament; the
Bible contains several references to the city, including a battle waged
there between the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar and Pharaoh Necho II in
the sixth century BC. This small corner of the Ottoman Empire was the
place where T. E. Lawrence came to feel a deeper sense of belonging than
anywhere else during his lifetime.</p>
<p>Having wheedled his way onto David Hogarth’s archaeological
expedition, Lawrence first reached Carchemish in February 1911. As the
junior assistant on the excavation, his official duties were to
photograph and sketch the dig as it progressed, as well as to keep a
catalog of its various finds. His job quickly expanded far beyond this.
As one of just two westerners permanently on-site to oversee a crew of
some two hundred local workmen (Hogarth, although the overall
administrator, would visit Carchemish only intermittently), Lawrence
soon came to be something akin to a construction foreman. In this role
he discovered, perhaps as much to his surprise as anyone else’s, that he
was a natural leader of men.</p>
<p>To be sure, this was partly due to his status as a European. Under a
system dating back to the 1500s known as the Capitulations, the European
powers had steadily wrung a series of ever more humiliating concessions
from the sultans in Constantinople under the pretext of protecting the
Ottoman Empire’s Christian minorities. By the beginning of the twentieth
century, European citizens were effectively exempt from Ottoman law.
“Really, this country, for the foreigner, is too glorious for words,”
Lawrence wrote to his family in the summer of 1912. “One is the baron of
the feudal system.”</p>
<p>But it was not merely this that made Lawrence a leader. He seemed to
possess an instant affinity for the East, and in that affinity an almost
instinctive appreciation for how its culture worked. By now quite fluent
in Arabic, in Carchemish he labored ceaselessly to deepen that
knowledge. He did so by quizzing the men in his work crews, by visiting
them in their homes, by taking painstaking notes on all he learned. From
their folkloric tales, to their views on politics, to charting out the
complicated clan structure that determined regional allegiances,
Lawrence gradually came to know this small corner of northern Syria and
its people better than probably any other European of the time.</p>
<p>Of course, there is nothing more endearing than attention. To the
extent that the workmen at Carchemish, drawn from the nearby town of
Jerablus, had ever had prior dealings with a westerner, it had
undoubtedly been of the most cursory and servile kind. They’d surely
never met one who bothered to learn the names of their children and
relatives and ancestors, who gladly accepted invitations into their
modest homes, who showed genuine respect for their rituals and
customs.</p>
<p>There was another aspect to Lawrence that impressed the locals as
well. He seemed to have none of the softness or frailty they associated
with Europeans; rather, he could work in the blazing heat for hours
without pause, could walk or ride for days without complaint, soldiered
through bouts of dysentery and malaria with the composed resignation of
a local. To the Arabs of Jerablus, most everything about Lawrence spoke
of a toughness, a stamina and an austerity, that made him seem less like
a European and more like themselves. In Arab tradition, they rewarded
that sense of kinship with a fierce and abiding loyalty. This cut both
ways, for the longer he stayed in Syria and the more he was accepted by
the locals, the less Lawrence came to think and act like a Briton.</p>
<p>More profoundly, his time in Syria caused him to fundamentally
rethink his views on the “civilizing influence” of the West. This change
found personification in the close relationship he developed with a
young man from Jerablus named Dahoum. Starting out as a mere
thirteen-year- old donkey boy at the Carchemish excavation site, the
bright and extraordinarily handsome Dahoum was soon elevated by Lawrence
to be a kind of personal assistant, and the two became inseparable,
leading to whispered rumors that they might be lovers. Whatever the
truth of those rumors, it was in the figure of Dahoum that Lawrence
began to develop a new if rather romanticized notion of the essential
nobility of the Arab race, admiring their asceticism as “the gospel of
bareness,” free from the taint of Western indulgence.</p>
<p>Writing his parents in 1911 from Jerablus, in a letter where he first
introduced Dahoum as “an interesting character” whom he wished to help,
he evinced views quite at odds with a British colonial sensibility:
“Fortunately there is no foreign influence as yet in the district. If
only you had seen the ruination caused by the French influence, and to a
lesser degree by the American, you would never wish it extended. The
perfectly hopeless vulgarity of the half-Europeanized Arab is appalling.
Better a thousand times the Arab untouched. The foreigners come out here
always to teach, whereas they had much better learn.”</p>
<p>This wasn’t a preoccupation one normally associated with an
archaeologist. Even David Hogarth, despite his great affection for his
protégé, was never convinced that Lawrence truly had the heart or
temperament of a scholar. He had little of the meticulous doggedness of
a man like Leonard Woolley, who in 1912 became the lead scientist at
Carchemish. Instead, Lawrence’s chief fascination seemed to be with the
land and the people that surrounded him; it was there where his passion
lay.</p>
<p>This passion also gave Lawrence a unique perspective on one of the
more momentous developments of the early twentieth century: the
protracted death throes of the Ottoman Empire. Most other Western
eyewitnesses to that spectacle resided in the cities of the Middle East.
Lawrence was one of the few who watched it play out in the countryside,
where the great majority of Ottoman subjects still lived.</p>
<p>That death had been a very long time foretold. The Ottoman Empire had
endured for nearly five centuries largely by allowing ethnic and
religious minorities extraordinary freedom to govern themselves, so long
as they paid their taxes and pledged ultimate allegiance to the sultans
in Constantinople. This system had begun to crumble in the nineteenth
century, buffeted by both the rise of nationalism and dramatic advances
in communications and commerce. With astonishing speed, the world was
becoming a smaller place, the industrializing nations of Europe were
becoming exponentially more powerful, and an empire built on what
essentially amounted to benign neglect of its component parts was an
anachronism. By the 1850s, the Ottoman Empire was already “the sick man
of Europe,” its final collapse eagerly anticipated by the ascendant
Western powers.</p>
<p>Through nimble alliance-making, the Ottomans had consistently managed
to dodge that demise, even as their Western competitors nibbled at the
empire’s edges. In the 1870s, czarist Russia crushed an Ottoman army in
the Balkans to win the independence of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro.
In 1881, France grabbed Tunisia. The following year, Great Britain used
the pretext of a nascent nationalist movement to snatch away Egypt.</p>
<p>Cruelly, the event that seemed to offer the Ottoman Empire its best
hope for a renaissance merely accelerated the disintegration. In 1908, a
reformist coup by a group of young military officers under the banner of
the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP)—soon to become better known as
the Young Turks—forced the despotic sultan to reinstate the
parliamentary constitution he had abrogated thirty years earlier.
Emboldened by their success, the Young Turks quickly launched a
breathtakingly ambitious campaign designed to drag the empire into the
twentieth century, including calls for the emancipation of women and the
granting of full rights of citizenship to ethnic and religious
minorities.</p>
<p>But if the CUP officers, most drawn from the European part of the
empire and steeped in European liberalism, had expected the Western
powers to embrace their cause, they were in for a rude surprise. Taking
advantage of the political confusion in Constantinople, Austria-Hungary
swiftly annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina. In other European capitals,
including London, the Young Turks were regarded with the deepest
suspicion, even derided as “crypto-Jews” bent on taking possession of
the empire as part of some sinister plot by international Jewry. Within
the Ottoman Empire, a virulent conservative backlash against the
progressives quickly plunged the new parliamentary government into an
era of political infighting and paralysis.</p>
<p>By 1911, the Young Turks had begun to solidify their hold on power,
and had come up with three main rallying points in hopes of keeping
their fractious empire together: modernization, the defense of Islam,
and a call for a rejoining of the greater Turkic-speaking world, or
Turanism. All of which sounded good, except that these three planks
stood in direct opposition to one another.</p>
<p>The very progressivism of many of the Young Turks’ social decrees may
have played well with secularists and the empire’s Jewish and Christian
minorities, but they simultaneously enraged huge numbers of Muslim
traditionalists. Similarly, while their increasingly jingoistic Turanist
rhetoric surely excited the ethnic Turk populace, it just as surely
alienated the non-Turkish populations—Arabs, Slavs, Armenians,
Greeks—who now constituted a majority within the empire. As for wrapping
themselves in the mantle of Islam’s defenders, that might conceivably
win over Turkish, Kurdish, and Arab Muslims, but it didn’t do much for
everyone else—including, for that matter, the sizable minority of Arabs
who were Christians. In effect, by trying to find something to appeal to
every segment of their polyglot society, the Young Turks were giving all
of them something to hate and fear.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, a young man increasingly attuned to the political and
social currents swirling around him, an inescapable conclusion began to
form: little by little, the Ottoman Empire was coming apart at the
seams. During his tenure at Jerablus, that process of disintegration
accelerated, and what had been an intermittent nibbling at the Ottoman
realm by the European powers was to become a feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>IN EARLY 1907, as Germany began to assert its assumed prerogatives as
an imperial power, Curt Prüfer took up his post as embassy dragoman in
Cairo.</p>
<p>On paper, the dragoman was merely the embassy interpreter, tasked to
assist the ambassador at his diplomatic meetings, as well as to
translate whatever documents the legation might address to the local
government, or vice versa. In reality, an ambitious dragoman could
become a virtual power unto himself. Then, as now, ambassadors were
often a clueless and temporary bunch, products of a palace sinecure
system and prone to be far more adept on the dance floor than at the
negotiating table. Dragomen, on the other hand, represented
continuity—many remained in their positions for decades—and through
their translating work had intimate knowledge of most everything going
on in every subsection of the embassy. Further, because they existed in
a gray area between an embassy’s diplomatic and consular branches, they
could quietly pursue questionable activities, such as meeting with a
regime’s enemies, which might provoke an outcry if conducted by their
superiors. This was crucial, for while nearly all the competing European
imperial powers at the dawn of the twentieth century viewed their
overseas legations as handy instruments for intelligence gathering,
influence peddling, and general mischief making, the Germans were in a
class by themselves. In keeping with Wilhelm II’s pugnacious approach to
foreign policy, German legations were forever being caught out in some
ungentlemanly transgression—stealing government and industrial secrets,
operating spy rings—that left their purportedly more high-minded British
and French counterparts spluttering with indignation. At the center of
many of these various scandals were the embassy dragomen.</p>
<p>In Egypt Prüfer had landed in one of the most important playgrounds
for this muscular German approach to diplomacy, a place where Berlin saw
the opportunity to both curry favor with the Ottoman leadership in
Constantinople and chip away at the hegemony of their British rivals.
That’s because in 1882, under the pretext of defending the ruling clique
from an independence-minded nationalist leader, Britain had invaded
Egypt and effectively taken control of the country that had been under
titular Ottoman rule for nearly four hundred years. The British hadn’t
stopped there. In May 1906, just nine months before Prüfer’s arrival at
the German embassy, they had exploited a minor diplomatic dispute in the
Sinai, the vast peninsula standing to the east of the Suez Canal, to
wrest that from the Ottomans as well. That episode had further fueled
Egyptian discontent with British rule—as well as Constantinople’s
bitterness toward its former friend—and the Germans operating in Cairo
saw nothing to lose and everything to gain by keeping that enmity at a
low boil.</p>
<p>But perhaps the greatest asset Prüfer had to draw on in the Egyptian
capital was his immediate supervisor at the embassy, a larger-than-life
character named Count Max von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years the dragoman’s senior, Oppenheim was a gregarious,
snappily attired bon vivant with a handlebar mustache and a fondness for
both the ladies and the racetrack, and a member in good standing at
Berlin’s Union Club, the exclusive haunt of Germany’s political and
economic elite. Oppenheim joined the German diplomatic service in 1883.
In short order, he had decamped for Syria, beginning a love affair with
the Near East that would last for the next sixty years. An amateur
archaeologist and ethnologist, he conducted archaeological expeditions
in the countryside, enterprises that he personally financed from his
banking family’s fortune. In Oppenheim’s case, the hobby eventually paid
off; in 1899, he discovered one of the most important lost settlements
of the Neolithic period, Tell Halaf, in northern Syria. (It is
presumably on the strength of that discovery that Oppenheim bears the
odd distinction of having a Montblanc pen named after him, joining such
luminaries as Charlemagne, Copernicus, and Alexander the Great in the
company’s “patron of the arts” line.) The adventurer finally set up a
semipermanent base of operations in Cairo in 1896, when he was given a
vaguely defined attaché position in the consular section of the German
embassy.</p>
<p>There were several controversial aspects to the count—no one was
quite sure of the title’s pedigree beyond its appearance on Oppenheim’s
business card—that set him apart from his diplomatic colleagues in the
Egyptian capital. One was his propensity for “going native.” This was
most evident in his habit of gadding about clad in Arab robes, as well
as his choosing to live in a “native” quarter of the city, but it also
extended to his amorous arrangements. According to Sean McMeekin in The
Berlin-Baghdad Express, “Every autumn, after his return from Berlin,
Oppenheim’s head servant Soliman would procure him a new slave girl (he
called them his Zeitfrauen, or temporary concubines), who would become
mistress of the harem until the following year, and who was herself
served by two female attendants.”</p>
<p>But the count was a man of catholic enthusiasms, and in addition to
archaeology and horse racing and slave girls, there was one that
Germany’s imperial rivals in the Near East found particularly irksome:
Max von Oppenheim wanted to rearrange the regional political chessboard
through stoking the fires of Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>He had begun formulating the idea shortly after taking up his
consular position in Cairo. In Oppenheim’s estimation, the great
Achilles’ heels of Germany’s principal European competitors—Great
Britain, France, and Russia—were the Muslim populations to be found
within their imperial borders, populations that deeply resented being
under the thumb of Christian colonial powers. As the only major European
power never to have attempted colonization in the Muslim world,
Oppenheim propounded, Germany was uniquely positioned to turn this
situation to its advantage—especially if it could forge an alliance with
the Ottoman Empire. If it came to a Europe-wide war, Oppenheim posited
in a flurry of reports to the German foreign ministry, and the Ottoman
authorities in Constantinople could be persuaded to call for a holy war
against the Christian occupiers of their former lands, what would happen
in British-ruled Egypt, or French Tunisia, or the Russian Caucasus?</p>
<p>One person who was itching to find out was Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Forwarded some of Oppenheim’s “war by revolution” treatises, the German
emperor quickly became a committed proponent of the jihad notion. Wilhem
saw to it that Oppenheim, “my feared spy,” was promoted at the Cairo
embassy, assuming the somewhat ironic title of chief legal counsel.</p>
<p>Until the blessed day of pan-Islamic jihad came, there was plenty of
work to be done in British Egypt. Through the early 1900s, Oppenheim
spent much of his time—and not a little of his personal fortune—quietly
wooing a broad cross section of the Egyptian elite opposed to British
rule: tribal sheikhs, urban intellectuals, nationalists, and religious
figures. While he had already won the kaiser to his jihadist ideas, in
1907 Oppenheim gained another adherent in the form of his new
subordinate, Curt Prüfer. Enough with scholarly articles and Egyptian
shadow plays; under the tutelage of his charismatic supervisor, Prüfer
now saw the opportunity to spread gasoline over the region, put a match
to it, and see what happened.</p>
<p>With his accent and command of Arabic far superior to Oppenheim’s,
the new dragoman became the key liaison between the embassy and the
Egyptian capital’s assorted malcontents. In particular, Prüfer carefully
cultivated a friendship with the khedive (roughly equivalent to viceroy)
of Egypt, Abbas Hilmi II, the local Ottoman head of state, whom the
British had maintained on the throne even as they stripped him of all
authority. Understandably, this arrangement had never sat well with the
khedive, a resentment Prüfer did his best to nurture. The two German
agents provocateurs didn’t limit their ministrations to the Cairene
mewling class. In early 1909, Prüfer and Oppenheim set out on a
wide-ranging tour of the Egyptian and Syrian hinterlands, where,
disguised in Bedouin garb, they endeavored to promote the twin causes of
pan-Islam and anticolonialism among the tribesmen.</p>
<p>But one doesn’t get Montblanc pens named after them by sticking to a
routine, and in late 1910, Count von Oppenheim made a surprising
announcement: he was leaving his legal counsel post at the embassy to
return to his first true love of archaeology. Specifically, the count
had decided it was high time to begin his excavations at Tell Halaf, the
Neolithic ruins he had discovered in northern Syria, and which had now
sat undisturbed for over a decade.</p>
<p>The understandable relief with which British authorities in Cairo
greeted this news—they had been trying for years to find some pretext to
have Oppenheim deported—was leavened by a healthy dose of skepticism,
especially when a quick glance at a map revealed that Tell Halaf lay
precisely alongside the proposed path of the Baghdad Railway. This was a
massive public works project underwritten by the Ottoman government that
was designed to link Constantinople to its easternmost—and reportedly,
oil-rich—territory of Iraq (or Mesopotamia, as it was still commonly
referred to in the West). Over the virulent objections of Britain and
France, in 1905 the Ottomans had awarded the construction project, and
the generous concessionary rights that went with it, to Germany.</p>
<p>But even if rid of “the kaiser’s spy,” the British in Egypt couldn’t
let their guard down. In his place, Count Max von Oppenheim had left
behind in Cairo a very dedicated and resourceful protégé.</p>
<p>THE HEADQUARTERS FOR the Carchemish dig was a small compound about a
half mile from the ruins, a former licorice company storehouse on the
outskirts of the village of Jerablus. It was here that T. E. Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley lived, as well as entertained the small groups of
Western travelers who found their way to the excavation site with
growing frequency. Over the course of their three years there, the two
men continually added new rooms and storage sheds to the original
structure, until the Jerablus “station” made for both a comfortable and
expansive home. It was a place Lawrence came to regard as his sanctuary.
As he wrote to his family in the summer of 1912, after having made a
trip of just a few days to the Syrian coast, “I seem to have been months
away from Jerablus, and am longing for its peace.”</p>
<p>But in the Near East, the very notion of peace was rapidly becoming
an anachronism as the crumbling of the Ottoman Empire gained momentum.
In 1911, the Italians invaded Libya, setting off a bloody war that
eventually led to an Ottoman defeat. Overlapping that conflict came the
First Balkan War, in which the Ottomans lost most of their remaining
European possessions, immediately followed by the Second Balkan War. The
grim news had a cascading effect. By 1913, when the Young Turks staged a
second coup to take over the reins of government outright, small-scale
rebellions and separatist movements had sprung up across the breadth of
what remained of the empire, with even local chieftains and clan leaders
sensing that the moment had come to finally throw off the Ottoman
yoke.</p>
<p>In this, the once-idyllic environs of northern Syria were in no way
immune. Given the ethnic composition of the region—the population was
overwhelmingly Arab or Kurd, with the presence of ethnic Turks largely
limited to local representatives of the Ottoman power structure, its
mayors and police and tax collectors—Lawrence had developed a rather
simplistic moralist view of its inhabitants: love for the noble Arab;
wary respect for the blustering Kurd; hatred for the cruel Turk. As a
result, he was quite pleased when the local Kurdish tribes threatened an
insurrection in 1912, and by the increasingly open defiance that he saw
playing out in the streets of Jerablus by the once-cowed Arabs toward
their Turkish overlords. The Ottoman thrall over the population—in
Lawrence’s view, a thrall based on fear and corruption and the sheer
soul-grinding machinery of an inept bureaucracy—was rapidly slipping,
and it was very hard to see how they might ever restore it. That
estimation delighted him.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the roiling within the Ottoman Empire that was
being felt in northern Syria. There was also the spreading intrigue of
the European imperial powers, all of them maneuvering everywhere in
search of some advantage against their rivals. In particular, the
arrival on the scene of the infamous Count Max von Oppenheim seemed a
clear indication that the region was now part of the ever-expanding
European chessboard. Having ostensibly returned to Syria to begin
excavations at Tell Halaf, some one hundred miles to the east of
Carchemish, Oppenheim dropped by the Jerablus station for a visit one
afternoon in July 1912.</p>
<p>“He was such a horrible person,” Lawrence wrote his youngest brother,
“I hardly was polite—but was interesting instead [sic]. He said [the
Carchemish ruins] were the most interesting and important discoveries he
had ever seen barring his own.”</p>
<p>Before long, Lawrence and Woolley began hearing rumors of the count’s
supposedly shoddy work at the Tell Halaf site, stories of great
cartloads of treasures being illegally hauled away, bound for Berlin.
They also couldn’t help notice that after years of lackadaisical
progress on the Baghdad Railway—and in the Ottoman world,
“lackadaisical” joined to “progress” tended to evoke geological
comparisons—the pace of work suddenly accelerated once Oppenheim
appeared. So accelerated, in fact, that by late 1912 the German
engineers and their advance crews had set to work on one of the most
technically complicated segments of the rail line, a trestle bridge over
the fast-flowing Euphrates River. By remarkable coincidence, the site
for that bridge was directly alongside the village of Jerablus.</p>
<p>Throughout 1913 and well into 1914, the two groups of Western workers
who improbably found themselves in this same remote corner of northern
Syria had an alternately amicable and contentious relationship. The
German railwaymen in Jerablus assisted the British archaeologists by
hauling away the discarded stone from their excavations for use in their
railroad embankments. In turn, the Germans frequently sought out the
Britons—and, with his fluent Arabic, especially Lawrence—to mediate in
their perpetually tense relations with local workers. A chief source of
that tension was the difficulty the Germans had in finding good help,
their best workers routinely jumping ship for the higher wages and more
respectful supervision of Lawrence and Woolley.</p>
<p>Very soon, these two groups would be on opposite sides of a world
war, and a different railroad—the Hejaz line, running from Damascus
seven hundred miles south to the city of Medina—would become the most
vital transportation link in the Middle Eastern theater of that
conflict. The knowledge Lawrence gained from watching the railway
construction in Jerablus was undoubtedly of great assistance to him
when, in a few years’ time, he would make blowing up the Hejaz Railway a
personal pastime.</p>
<p>AT MIDMORNING ON September 15, 1913, twenty-six-year-old William Yale
was part of a three-man crew “pulling rods”—detaching and stacking drill
sections, just about the most miserable job to be had in an oilfield—in
the Kiefer field of northern Oklahoma when a courier on horseback
approached. Minutes later, the Kiefer straw boss called Yale over to
hand him a telegram. It was from the corporate headquarters of the
Standard Oil Company of New York, and it was succinct: “Report to New
York immediately.”</p>
<p>After graduating from his eponymous university in 1910, Yale had
struggled to find his calling until, in 1912, he came across a notice
soliciting applicants for the “foreign service school” of the Standard
Oil Company of New York. On a whim, he applied.</p>
<p>Operating out of Standard’s corporate headquarters at 26 Broadway in
New York, the “school” consisted of a four-month intensive lecture and
seminar program, designed to educate its applicants in all aspects of
the petroleum industry, as well as to instill in them the “Standard man”
ideal. Just what that ideal might consist of was difficult to say, for
by 1912 Standard Oil was the most infamous corporation in the history of
international commerce, its name synonymous with capitalist greed run
amok.</p>
<p>Through cutthroat tactics devised by its principal shareholder, John
D. Rockefeller, Standard had so thoroughly dominated the U.S. petroleum
industry over the previous four decades that by the early 1900s it
controlled nearly 90 percent of the nation’s oil production. For nearly
as long, it had operated a complex web of front companies and shell
corporations that had defeated the efforts of every “trust buster”
lawman trying to break its stranglehold. Finally, in 1911, just the year
before Yale’s job application, the U.S. Supreme Court declared Standard
to be an illegal monopoly and decreed it be broken up into thirty-four
separate companies.</p>
<p>Whether this divestiture truly ended the Standard monopoly is still
the subject of debate, but it did have the effect of forcing its
component parts to specialize, either to focus on supplying regional
domestic markets or on building international exports. Among the most
aggressive in this latter sphere was the new Standard Oil Company of New
York—often referred to by its acronym, Socony—the second largest of the
thirty-four “baby Standards.”</p>
<p>While other baby Standards turned inward, Socony looked at the great
world beyond and saw a plethora of burgeoning markets thirsting for
petroleum. It was to coordinate and standardize its marketing approaches
in these far-flung spots that the company had launched its foreign
service school. William Yale, an enthusiastic pupil, would call the
program’s teaching methods “far more effective and efficient” than
anything he’d encountered at either prep school or university.</p>
<p>And the Socony administrators clearly liked what they saw in William
Yale. At the conclusion of his coursework, he was selected to stay on
and dispatched to take a firsthand look at oil production in the United
States in preparation for future work abroad. Through the autumn of
1912, Yale shuttled to a variety of Standard oilfields in the Midwest,
tasked only to write up weekly reports on what he observed and send them
back to Socony headquarters.</p>
<p>But the endless tour of oilfields had soon become monotonous to the
restless Yale. In early 1913, he wrote to his New York supervisors
asking to be given a field job, arguing that if he was to learn any more
about the oil business it would have to be by doing rather than
observing. That letter undoubtedly further endeared him to 26 Broadway;
the notion that a college man—an Ivy League graduate, no less—would
request to toil as a laborer indicated just the sort of employee
Standard was looking for. Yale was soon sent to the new Cushing field in
western Oklahoma to work as a roustabout.</p>
<p>For a time, he reveled in the hard labor. Living in the middle of
nowhere for weeks on end, Yale worked a succession of Oklahoma fields,
where he cleared drill sites, laid piping, hauled machinery, and
constructed derricks. He had been doing this for several months when the
cable arrived from New York.</p>
<p>Just three days removed from the Kiefer field, Yale walked into the
lobby of the Socony corporate headquarters at 26 Broadway in lower
Manhattan. There, he was taken up to the thirteenth-floor office suite
of Standard’s vice president, William Bemis. Yale found two other men
already waiting in the suite, hats in hand, and all three maintained a
respectful silence as the officious Bemis fired off directives to his
scurrying staff.</p>
<p>“My mind was in a dream world,” Yale recounted, “as I listened to him
dictating instructions to his secretary about shipments of kerosene oil
to Shanghai, about contracts for asphalt to pave the streets of a city
in India, and contracts with the Greek government for fuel oil to supply
the Greek navy at Piraeus.”</p>
<p>When finally Bemis turned his attention to the three waiting men, it
was to inform them that they had been selected for a special overseas
assignment, that in just two days’ time they would board SS Imperator in
New York harbor for its voyage to Calais, France. From there, they would
travel overland across the length of Europe to Constantinople, where
they would receive further instructions from the manager of Standard’s
branch office. Before dismissing them, Bemis stressed to the three men
that they were embarking on a highly confidential mission. As such, they
were to tell no one of their ultimate destination or of their
affiliation with Standard Oil. Instead, they were to pass themselves off
as wealthy “playboys” en route to a Grand Tour of the Holy Land, a
charade lent credence by their deluxe travel accommodations: the
Imperator was the newest and most luxurious passenger ship plying the
Atlantic crossing, their rail passage to Constantinople was to be aboard
the fabled Orient Express, and they would be traveling first-class the
entire way.</p>
<p>But upholding the playboy ruse was easier said than done for Yale’s
two companions. J. C. Hill, the leader of the team, was a
rough-around-the-edges crew boss from the steel mills of Pennsylvania.
Rudolf McGovern was a dour and socially awkward geologist in his late
twenties. Even if these two could manage to put on airs suggesting that
they came from money—and that seemed doubtful—they hardly seemed prime
candidates for a pilgrimage to biblical sites. Perhaps wisely, their
answer to the playboy directive was to interact with the ship’s other
first-class passengers as little as possible.</p>
<p>William Yale had no such difficulties. To the contrary, the voyage
was like a disorienting return to his former life. Among the Imperator’s
first-class passengers were a great many young people, the offspring of
America’s industrial magnates and landed aristocracy, setting off on
their requisite Grand Tour of Europe, the sort of tame adventure that
until a few years earlier would have been his lot.</p>
<p>Yale would recall one peculiar detail of that journey. The Imperator
(German for emperor) was the new flagship of the Hamburg-America Line,
and at every dinnertime its German officers rose to offer a toast to
“der Tag” (the day). Unschooled in the nuances of German, Yale assumed
that the gesture was in quaint celebration of the day just lived; it
would be some time before he understood it was actually a kind of code,
a toast in giddy anticipation of the coming world war, then less than a
year away.</p>
<p>ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1913, the same day that William Yale received his
cable at the Kiefer oilfield ordering him to New York, T. E. Lawrence
was at the train station in Aleppo, sixty miles to the west of
Carchemish, awaiting the arrival of his brother Will.</p>
<p>Of his four brothers, Lawrence had always been closest to Will, the
middle child and just two years his junior. Upon learning that his
brother was leaving England to take up a teaching position in India, he
had implored Will to stop off in Syria en route.</p>
<p>Despite their closeness, the visit must have been the source of some
anxiety for Lawrence, who had long since been consigned to the role of
family bohemian; it was easy to imagine that his brother might be quite
shocked by the primitiveness of his surroundings and to report back as
much to Oxford. Lawrence needn’t have worried. After the two spent some
ten days together at Jerablus, Lawrence saw Will off at the local train
station for the return to Aleppo, a moment Will recounted in a letter to
their parents:</p>
<p>“You must not think of Ned as leading an uncivilized existence. When
I saw him last as the train left the station, he was wearing white
flannels, socks and red slippers, with a white Magdalen blazer, and was
talking to the governor of Biredjik in lordly fashion.”</p>
<p>That parting at Jerablus was to be the last time the brothers would
ever see each other.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-3-another-and-another-nice-thing">Chapter 3 Another and
Another Nice Thing</h4>
<p>Always my soul hungered for less than it had.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM</p>
<p>How do you put a collar on a leopard? Very carefully, according to
the old joke, but in the autumn of 1913, T. E. Lawrence and Leonard
Woolley were in need of a practical answer to that question. They had
recently been given a young leopard as a gift by a government official
in Aleppo, and had found that so long as he remained chained in the
courtyard of the Jerablus compound, he made for a very effective
watchdog. The problem, though, was that leopards grow very quickly, and
it was now just a matter of time before he tore through the flimsy
collar he had been delivered in.</p>
<p>The archaeologists’ first idea was to throw a large slatted box over
the cat, then reach through the slats to effect the collar exchange, but
since the leopard was “not very sweet tempered” to begin with, according
to Lawrence, this confinement only put him in a fouler mood. Their
solution was a rather clever one. Slightly enlarging an opening in the
box, they kept stuffing in burlap sacks until eventually the leopard was
wedged so tightly that he couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“Then we took the top off the box, collared him, and let him loose
again,” Lawrence wrote to his family. “He will make a most splendid
carpet some day.”</p>
<p>Along with learning how to recollar a leopard, it was in that autumn
1913 digging season at Carchemish, Lawrence’s fifth, that he and Woolley
would make a spectacular find—the site’s main temple. It was an
archaeologist’s dream, the discovery of a lifetime, and it helped fuel
in Lawrence a sense that he had found his true calling, and perhaps his
true home. The spacious main living room of the Jerablus compound was
now a cozy space adorned with artwork on the walls and carpets and
animal hides on the floor, a library with books in seven languages, and
an enormous fireplace constantly stoked with hot-burning olivewood. He
revealed his feelings in a letter to a close friend from his Oxford days
that autumn.</p>
<p>“I have got to like this place very much,” he wrote, “and the people
here—five or six of them—and the whole manner of living pleases me.…
Carchemish will not be finished for another four or five years and I’m
afraid that, after that, I’ll probably go after another and another nice
thing.”</p>
<p>But heartbreakingly, funding from the British Museum—always extremely
tight and always conditionally doled out from one season or year to the
next—had been effectively exhausted. Unless an unforeseen new funding
source suddenly appeared, the next digging season, spring 1914, was
slated to be the last. This knowledge hung over Lawrence and Woolley,
and it overshadowed their excitement over that season’s discoveries with
a deepening sense of despair. It was only when they began closing down
the site in preparation for their off-season break that a new
possibility presented itself.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, a British
Museum director explained, a group of Royal Engineers was about to
embark on an archaeological survey of the so-called Wilderness of Zin of
southernmost Palestine; might Lawrence and Woolley be interested in
joining them during their upcoming break?</p>
<p>For Lawrence and Woolley, it presented a choice between spending two
months of leisure in England, or trekking through one of the world’s
most inhospitable corners. But the lure of exploration really made this
no choice at all; both men immediately signed on.</p>
<p>LATE ONE NIGHT in early October 1913, William Yale lay in his tent in
the mountains of Anatolia, struck by a sense of wonder at how quickly a
life could change. Just three weeks earlier he had been living in a
two-room shanty and pulling rods in an Oklahoma oilfield, and now he was
traveling through one of the most ruggedly beautiful landscapes on
earth, a land only a handful of Americans had ever seen.</p>
<p>Adding to his sense of awe was that in all the time he’d spent in
Oklahoma daydreaming about where Standard Oil might send him, he had
scarcely considered the Near East. Instead, on that day he walked into
the Socony headquarters in New York, he had assumed he was being
dispatched as a sales representative to China.</p>
<p>Yale’s misconception was understandable. In 1913, Socony was
primarily an exporter of petroleum products, and China was by far its
largest market. In comparison, the company’s exports to the Ottoman
Empire, primarily kerosene to fuel its embryonic industrial facilities,
were minuscule. To put into perspective how minuscule, while Standard’s
kerosene represented the second biggest American export to the Ottoman
Empire, the largest was Singer sewing machines.</p>
<p>But as the Standard vice president, William Bemis, had explained to
the three men brought to his office that morning, they weren’t being
sent to the Near East to rustle up new purchasing clients, but rather to
find and develop new sources of oil.</p>
<p>It was simple economics. By the end of 1913, the exponentially
growing demand for oil and petroleum products around the globe meant
that demand would soon outstrip supply. In the United States alone, the
number of combustion-engine vehicles on the road had increased
twentyfold in less than a decade, from some seventy-five thousand in
1905 to well over 1.5 million in 1913—and already a number of the oldest
American oilfields were starting to run dry.</p>
<p>Oil was rapidly becoming a crucial military asset as well. In 1912,
just a year before Yale’s summoning to New York, the first lord of the
admiralty of Great Britain, Winston Churchill, had made international
headlines with his plan to convert the entire Royal Navy from coal to
oil. As might be expected, this proposed modernization of the world’s
most powerful fleet was already causing the navies of other nations,
including Germany, to scramble to follow suit.</p>
<p>As a consequence, both American and European oil companies were now
rushing to find and exploit new fields wherever they might exist. One
especially promising region was the Near East. In the 1870s, huge oil
and gas deposits had been discovered around Baku on the Caspian Sea, and
this had been followed by another large strike in the Persian Gulf in
1908. Those fields were quickly dominated by European consortiums, and
the race was on to tap and lay claim to the next big find.</p>
<p>To that end, the Socony branch office in Constantinople had quietly
obtained a six-month option from a consortium of three Jerusalem-based
businessmen who held vast exploration concessionary rights in three
different regions of the Ottoman Empire. It was to perform preliminary
fieldwork in these concessionary zones that Yale, McGovern, and Hill had
been dispatched from New York. As for the elaborate secrecy surrounding
their mission, there were two reasons: to throw any potential
competitors off the scent, naturally, but also to keep the Standard name
in the background for as long as possible. Its recent breakup
notwithstanding, the Standard brand was still regarded with such abiding
distrust in the Near East, as in many other parts of the world, that the
easiest way to besmirch the reputation of a business rival was to accuse
it of being a Standard Oil front.</p>
<p>But despite its stealth approach, there were indications that
Standard Oil of New York was not quite the smoothly run, rapacious
machine its progenitor had been. Indeed, one such indication was the
composition of the team it had sent to explore the Ottoman concessions.
J. C. Hill, the chief, was a Pittsburgh steel man with no experience in
the oil industry. Rudolf McGovern was a college-trained geologist, but
had never actually set foot in an oilfield. And while William Yale
certainly knew his way around an oilfield, he had absolutely no
knowledge of geology.</p>
<p>Certainly J. C. Hill had an unusual approach to exploration, one that
might best be described as fatalistic. Arriving in Constantinople in
early October, the team had set out for the first concessionary zone, a
broad stretch of mountainous terrain in central Anatolia, just south of
the Black Sea. Accompanied by a small team of local guides, the three
Americans spent a couple of weeks roaming the high plateau on horseback,
but each time McGovern pointed to a distant spot he deemed worthy of
closer inspection, Hill thought better of it. A critical moment came
when the group learned there was a boat heading back to Constantinople
in thirty hours’ time, and that there wouldn’t be another for at least
two weeks; they made the boat with just minutes to spare.</p>
<p>Their pace slowed considerably once they reached the second
exploration zone, the Dead Sea valley in Palestine, in November 1913.
Essentially a continuation of the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, from
a geological standpoint the region held a good deal more promise than
Anatolia. For several weeks, the team traveled the western shore of the
Dead Sea, picking their way through shale screes and the surrounding
limestone cliffs. Time and again, they found tantalizing clues to the
presence of oil—lumps of pure asphalt floating in the sea, surface
limestone so impregnated with petroleum that it gave off the odor of
gasoline—but nothing to confirm that a commercially viable reservoir
might lie beneath.</p>
<p>Then again, it was hard to say much with any definitiveness since
Hill, employing the exploratory style he had honed in Anatolia, soon
began to veto nearly every spot that McGovern recommended for closer
investigation. At times it seemed to Yale that they weren’t so much
looking for oil as trying to hide from it.</p>
<p>Matters finally came to a head in early January when Hill announced
that their work there was done and ordered the breaking of camp for the
return journey to Jerusalem. Yale, fueled by three months of
frustration, could hold his tongue no longer. He confronted Hill, and
the two ended up in a heated argument.</p>
<p>Whether that argument had some effect or it was mere coincidence, on
the very next day, as the group climbed into the Judean foothills for
the return to Jerusalem, Hill suddenly drew up his horse to gaze at a
mountainous outcrop some thirty miles to the south. It was a strange
geological formation, an irregular massif rising from the surrounding
desert plain. Examined through binoculars, there appeared to be pools of
something collected at the mountain base, something shimmering and
iridescent.</p>
<p>“There.” J. C. Hill pointed off to the mountains of Kornub. “That is
where we will find oil.”</p>
<p>Events moved very quickly after that. Hurrying his bedraggled caravan
back to Jerusalem, Hill immediately cabled Socony headquarters with news
of his “find.” By return telegram, he was ordered to gather up the two
primary concession holders of the Palestine tracts, Jerusalem
businessmen Ismail Hakki Bey and Suleiman Nassif, and personally deliver
them to the Socony office in Cairo as soon as possible. In Hill’s
absence, Yale and Rudolf McGovern were to go on to Kornub and conduct
tests to determine just how immense this new strike might be.</p>
<p>Hastily hiring guides and camp orderlies for the expedition, Yale and
McGovern decamped from Jerusalem around January 6, only to meet T. E.
Lawrence and his companions outside Beersheva a few days later.
Following that humiliating encounter, the Socony party continued south
until they at last reached the desolate peaks of Kornub. What they were
to discover there would have momentous consequences.</p>
<p>ON MARCH 15, 1913, Aaron Aaronsohn was invited to a luncheon at an
exclusive club in Washington, D.C. The guest of honor was former
president Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Maybe it was out of respect that Aaronsohn’s hosts, two prominent
American Jewish leaders named Julian Mack and Felix Frankfurter, sat
their guest beside the former president, or maybe it was born of a sense
of mischief; both Aaronsohn and Roosevelt, still referred to as “the
Colonel” by his intimates, had hard-earned reputations for being nonstop
talkers, and their table companions may have thought it amusing to see
who would win out. To the amazement of Mack and Frankfurter, it was
President Roosevelt who barely got a word in; instead he listened to
Aaronsohn with rapt attention. Aaronsohn clearly appreciated the
uniqueness of his achievement; he wrote in his diary that night that
“from now on, my reputation will be the man who made the Colonel shut up
for 101 minutes.”</p>
<p>Much like the former president, Aaron Aaronsohn came on like a force
of nature. A towering man given to portliness, he was both brilliant and
arrogant, passionate and combative, one of those people who seem to
believe they are always the most interesting person in a room. In the
case of the thirty-seven-year-old Aaronsohn, he was usually right.</p>
<p>By March 1913, he had also emerged as one of the most persuasive
spokesmen for a cause that had recently gained currency in certain
Jewish circles: Zionism. Calling for a return of the Jewish diaspora to
their ancestral homeland of Eretz (Greater) Israel, the Zionist movement
had gained some adherents among international Jewry over the previous
two decades, but more frequently had been met with skepticism, even
hostility. What made Aaronsohn so influential was that his Zionist
arguments were not based on political or religious abstractions, but on
the purely practical, almost the mundane: agriculture. Already
recognized as one of the most accomplished agronomists in the Middle
East, Aaronsohn had spent thirty-one of his thirty-seven years in
Palestine, and he was now conducting a wide range of scientific
experiments—on plants and trees and soils—that might restore the region
to the verdant land it had been in ancient times. All high-minded
Zionist principles aside, he frequently pointed out, the first
prerequisite for the Jews’ return to Israel was to have something to
eat; Aaronsohn knew how to feed them.</p>
<p>He hadn’t come to any of this easily. The eldest child of a Jewish
grain merchant, Aaronsohn was born in 1876 in a small town in central
Romania. He was just two when the Russo-Turkish War led to Romania’s
independence from the Ottoman Empire. For the nation’s large Jewish
population, what had been a tolerably bad existence under a Muslim
autocracy quickly became an intolerably bad one under a Christian
democracy. Effectively barred from obtaining citizenship, which also
meant being barred from most schools and professions, the Jews began a
mass exodus out of Romania. In 1882, when Aaron was six, his parents
joined the flight. Rather than make for the émigrés’ preferred
destination of the United States, however, the Aaronsohns joined some
250 other Romanian Jews in sailing for the Palestine region of Ottoman
Syria.</p>
<p>The group settled on a barren tract of rocky hillside near the port
city of Haifa, an outpost they named Samarin. There they quickly
discovered that the “land flowing with milk and honey” described in the
Book of Exodus had changed a very great deal in the interim. The few
Samarin settlers who knew how to farm—most had been small merchants back
in Romania—were soon defeated by the arid landscape and poor soil.
Within the year, the émigrés were so destitute they were forced to pawn
their sacred Torah scrolls.</p>
<p>Salvation came in the form of the enormously wealthy French Jewish
financier Baron Edmond de Rothschild. An early supporter and benefactor
of Jewish immigration to Palestine, Rothschild had already established
or bailed out a number of Jewish colonies in the region, and in 1884 he
did the same with Samarin, renaming it Zichron Yaakov (Jacob’s
Memorial), in honor of his deceased father. As the community soon
discovered, though, Rothschild’s patronage came at a very steep price.
In agreeing to lend financial support, his first condition had been
“that he alone shall be the colony’s sole lord and that all things in
its domain be under his rule”—and he hadn’t been kidding. The residents
of Zichron Yaakov were told what crops they could grow, how they should
dress, even who had earned the right to marry, and Rothschild’s resident
agents made sure the rules were enforced.</p>
<p>But for the young and extraordinarily bright Aaron Aaronsohn, this
feudalistic system had its benefits. In 1893, at the age of sixteen, he
was chosen by Rothschild’s agents to be educated in France, all expenses
paid, and for the next two years he studied agronomy and botany at the
Grignon Institute outside Paris, one of the most prestigious
agricultural academies in Europe. When he returned to Palestine, it was
not to take up the life of a Rothschild serf in Zichron Yaakov but to
serve as an agricultural “instructor” at another of the baron’s
settlements. The arrangement didn’t last long. Within a year, Aaronsohn,
just nineteen but already headstrong and impatient, broke with the baron
and his agents and struck out on his own.</p>
<p>Finding work as an agricultural advisor to large absentee landowners,
he also began meticulously studying and cataloging the flora and geology
of Palestine. In this endeavor, his intense curiosity and indefatigable
energy soon became legendary. By his midtwenties, already fluent in a
half dozen languages, Aaronsohn began publishing articles in European
agronomy journals. No one in the tightly knit and highly credentialed
fraternity of European agronomists had ever heard of their colleague in
Palestine, and the frequency and eclectic range of Aaronsohn’s
work—learned studies on everything from sesame oil extraction to silk
production—led some to wonder whether the name was a pseudonym for a
collective of scientists.</p>
<p>His true breakthrough came in 1906 with his discovery of wild emmer
wheat, a progenitor of cultivated wheat long thought extinct, growing on
the slopes of Mount Hermon. At a time when the world’s population was
still over 80 percent agrarian, the find made international headlines
and won the young, virtually self-taught Jewish scientist the
recognition of his peers around the globe. Three years later, he
accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
conduct a wide-ranging tour of the American West. There he was treated
as something of a celebrity, offered college professorships, his highly
anticipated lectures attended by overflowing audiences. But Aaronsohn’s
time in the United States—his stay extended to nearly eight months—also
exposed him to the currents of modern Jewish political thought, and
especially to some of the foremost leaders of the American Zionist
movement.</p>
<p>While the notion of a return to Israel had been a cornerstone of
Jewish faith for millennia—for nearly two thousand years, Jewish Yom
Kippur and Passover services have ended with the recitation, “next year
in Jerusalem”—it was a Hungarian writer, Theodor Herzl, who transformed
it into a modern political idea. In the face of institutionalized
anti-Semitism in even the most “enlightened” nations of Europe, and the
periodic massacre of Jews in places like czarist Russia, Herzl had
argued in his 1896 book The Jewish State that international Jewry could
only ever be truly safe and free by establishing their own homeland in
the ancient land of Israel. The following year, Herzl presided over the
first meeting of the World Zionist Congress in Switzerland, an event
that electrified Jewish audiences around the world.</p>
<p>It also provoked a furious backlash. In both Europe and the United
States, many Jewish leaders—perhaps most—saw Zionism as a dangerous
instrument that would isolate Jews from the nations of their birth, and
provide fuel to the long-repeated accusation of Jews harboring a divided
loyalty; some even suspected Zionism to be an anti-Semitic plot. For the
anti-Zionists, the answer to the “Jewish Question” was not Israel but
assimilation, full political and economic participation in the nations
of their births, a goal finally coming within reach in much of Europe
through the spread of democracy.</p>
<p>The “assimilationists” also appeared to have a powerful practical
argument in their favor. Already by the early 1900s, some sixty thousand
Jews lived in the Holy Land, and the great majority of them were either
desperately poor or subsisting on subscriptions raised by their
religious brethren abroad. Considering this, how could the wastelands of
Palestine possibly sustain any significant percentage of the some ten
million Jews then scattered about the globe?</p>
<p>It was in retort to this question that Aaron Aaronsohn—not just an
agronomist, but an amateur archaeologist and an avid reader of
history—could pose a compelling one of his own. What had sustained the
Romans and the Babylonians and the Assyrians? From both archaeological
excavations and old histories, it was clear that Palestine had once
supported populations much greater than the estimated 700,000
inhabitants of the early 1900s, and it wasn’t as if the water sources or
soil beds that sustained those civilizations had simply vanished.
Rather, they had been lost to time, and were waiting to be rediscovered,
retapped. Aaronsohn also had a persuasive modern example to point to.
During his travels in the American West, he had made a special study of
California, a place with very similar climate and soil conditions to
Palestine. With water diverted from the Sierra Nevada, California’s
Central Valley was already becoming the agricultural breadbasket of
America and bringing in a flood of new settlers. The very same,
Aaronsohn argued, could be achieved in Palestine, and with his unrivaled
knowledge of the region, he was the man to do it.</p>
<p>In the face of such optimism, not to say arrogance, an expanding
circle of wealthy American Jews warmed to Aaronsohn’s vision of a
restored Israel. Before he left the United States in the autumn of 1909,
a consortium of these businessmen and philanthropists had raised some
0,000 toward the creation of the Jewish Agricultural Experiment Station
in Palestine, a modern research center that Aaronsohn would oversee and
that he vowed would become the preeminent such scientific facility in
all the Middle East.</p>
<p>For his new venture, Aaronsohn set up operations on a bluff
overlooking the Mediterranean some eight miles north of Zichron Yaakov,
a place named Athlit. Over the next several years, he laid in fields of
experimental seedbeds and orchards, built a complex of greenhouses and
laboratories. He also saw to the construction of a large two-story
building, housing for the facility’s library and permanent workers, with
a commanding view of the sea just one mile away. With a lack of
sufficiently educated locals, Aaronsohn drew most of those permanent
workers from among his own family—at various times all five of his
siblings would be employed at Athlit—and it was they who oversaw its
day-to-day operations, including supervising the field workers drawn
from nearby Arab villages. “Before long,” biographer Ronald Florence
noted, “the experimental plots at the research center were producing
more wheat, barley and oats per dunam [about one thousand square meters]
than long-established farms on much better soils.”</p>
<p>In light of his growing role as a recruiter for Zionism, it’s
somewhat curious that Aaronsohn appeared to have spent very little time
thinking through its social or political ramifications. He could put
more Jews on the ground in Palestine, of that he was certain, but what
it meant or what form their governance might take was all rather
vague.</p>
<p>But this same vagueness extended to the Zionist movement itself.
Among “social” and religious Zionists, the goal was quite modest:
increased Jewish immigration to Palestine for those who wished to go,
with no upsetting of the existing local political framework. Indeed,
many of the businessmen who had donated to Aaronsohn’s research station
considered themselves anti-Zionists, somehow imagining their involvement
as apolitical, akin to helping rebuild a synagogue.</p>
<p>Even among those who embraced the idea of a “Jewish state,” there was
very little agreement on its definition. In 1901, Theodor Herzl had met
with the Ottoman sultan in hopes of actually purchasing Palestine. When
that overture went nowhere, most successive Zionist leaders had
advocated an incremental approach, of Jewish financiers gradually buying
up land in Palestine for settlement, while simultaneously negotiating
with Constantinople—negotiations that might take the form of bribes or
the paying off of a portion of the Ottomans’ crushing foreign debt—to
ensure Ottoman acceptance and protection of the new settlers. Whether
such a scheme could ever lead to the kind of demographic shift allowing
for Jewish majority rule was highly doubtful, however, given that
Palestine’s existing non-Jewish population outnumbered Jews by ten to
one. By the time of Aaronsohn’s luncheon with Teddy Roosevelt in 1913,
however, a new, more promising prospect had presented itself. With the
Ottoman Empire being torn at from all sides, its final collapse suddenly
appeared imminent. If that fall did come and a European power took
control of Palestine, the Zionists might be able to establish themselves
under their protection. Both the most likely and most desirable such
patron, in Aaronsohn’s estimation, was Great Britain.</p>
<p>STEWART NEWCOMBE WAS a legendary figure in the Near East, although
not in a uniformly positive way. At the age of thirty-five, the Boer War
veteran had already surveyed and mapped vast tracts of Egypt and the
Sudan for the British government, and had gained the reputation of being
an indefatigable explorer, capable of the work of ten ordinary men. That
was part of the problem. Due to his habit of driving others as hard as
he drove himself, the Arabs who worked with him in the coming war would
say of Captain Stewart Newcombe that “he was like fire, burning both his
friends and enemies.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then, Newcombe had been in a rather black mood as he
left his camp in the Zin Desert on the morning of January 8 and made for
Beersheva, a day’s camel ride away. He was going there to meet up with
the two eminent archaeologists, lately working on a dig in northern
Syria, who had been assigned to his mission in southern Palestine.
Although he fully appreciated the need for the archaeologists—they were
the political cover that would allow his five military mapping teams to
do their clandestine work—this operation was designed to be a
fast-moving one over an unspeakably harsh landscape, and tending to the
needs of two Oxford scholars was the last thing Newcombe needed. He had
earlier sent ten camels to meet their boat in Gaza to transport their
gear—archaeologists always had lots of gear—and he was coming out of the
desert with more to handle the inevitable overflow.</p>
<p>A very pleasant surprise awaited him in Beersheva. “I expected to
meet two somewhat elderly people; [instead] I found C. L. Woolley and T.
E. Lawrence, who looked about twenty-four years of age and eighteen
respectively.… My letters to them arranging for their reception had
clearly been too polite. Undue deference ceased forthwith.”</p>
<p>Far from needing a small camel caravan to haul their equipment, when
Lawrence and Woolley had come off the boat in Gaza, accompanied by
Lawrence’s young assistant Dahoum, all their possessions had fit neatly
onto the back of one small donkey. That had now been expanded somewhat
by the purchase of camping and photographic supplies, but clearly the
two young archaeologists appreciated the need for traveling light on the
brutal terrain they were about to enter.</p>
<p>That evening, Newcombe spelled out to the men from Syria both what
they were expected to do and the sub rosa purpose of the expedition. On
this latter aspect, Lawrence had already pretty well figured things out.
“We are obviously only meant as red herrings,” he had written his
parents en route to Palestine, “to give an archaeological colour to a
political job.”</p>
<p>That political job arose from a problem that Great Britain had
largely brought upon itself. As the European power most dependent on
control of the seas, Britain had been the driving force behind the
construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt in the 1870s, seeing the linking
of the Mediterranean to the Red Sea as a vital military and commercial
shortcut in keeping its far-flung empire knitted together. So vital did
it deem the canal that Britain had been willing to sacrifice its
long-standing good relations with the Ottoman Empire in order to take
possession of it outright, a feat accomplished by its 1882 invasion of
Egypt under the pretext of quelling local unrest. That had delivered up
the west bank of the Suez Canal, Egypt’s de facto frontier, but it left
the now hostile Ottomans still hovering on its east bank in the Sinai
Peninsula. This problem was soon resolved; in 1906, Britain had
capitalized on a minor diplomatic dispute to grab that territory also.
The end result was something of a trade-off. The British now had their
canal, along with the 120-mile-wide buffer zone of the Sinai Peninsula
separating Egypt from the heavily settled Palestine region of southwest
Syria. On the flip side, they had won the undying resentment of the
Ottomans.</p>
<p>That was a small price to pay in 1882 and 1906, perhaps, but a rather
different story by the beginning of 1914. With Europe stumbling ever
closer toward a continent-wide war, the British were suddenly quite
concerned by the sorry state of British-Ottoman relations, and by
ominous signs that Constantinople was sliding into the orbit of
Britain’s avowed enemy, Germany. If the war everyone expected did come,
the Suez Canal would be the crucial passageway for bringing British
territorial troops from India and Australia to Europe; of course, if
Turkey joined with Germany in that war, they would undoubtedly target
the canal for this same reason. Britain’s problems wouldn’t end there.
In the event that the enemy succeeded in crossing the canal and getting
into Egypt itself, it was very likely to spark an anti-British
insurrection by a population that thoroughly despised them, tying up
British soldiers who would be needed for the fight in Europe.</p>
<p>In contemplating this scenario the British belatedly came to
appreciate the downside to their Sinai buffer zone, one inherent to the
very concept of buffer zones: how to know what lies on the other side?
The British had a very good idea of what lay at the Sinai’s northeastern
tip—the populous and long-cultivated region of the Palestine coast—but
they knew virtually nothing of the desert frontier that ran southeast
from that coast to the Gulf of Aqaba, one hundred miles away. Were there
roads there, water wells that might sustain an invasion force?</p>
<p>The person most preoccupied with finding out was Egypt’s de facto
ruler, the British agent and consul general, Horatio Herbert Kitchener.
By 1914, Lord Kitchener was Britain’s preeminent living war hero—he had
crushed a native revolt in the Sudan during the Mahdi War in 1898, then
led British forces to victory in the Boer War in 1902—but by one of
those peculiar happenstances of history, as a young man Kitchener had
been a geographical surveyor, and his crowning achievement was the
mapping of Palestine. The one corner of Palestine that Kitchener and his
cosurveyors had skipped over was the desolate wastelands of
Zin—essentially the triangle-shaped lower half of modern-day Israel—the
survey sponsors figuring there was simply no political or economic
reason to include it. But it was precisely this unmapped triangle that
now lay on the other side of the Sinai buffer zone.</p>
<p>Considering the enmity that had developed between the two empires,
Kitchener had shown remarkable chutzpah in 1913 when “offering” the
Ottomans the services of the British Royal Engineers to conduct a survey
of Zin; unsurprisingly, Constantinople quickly turned the offer down. By
happy coincidence, however, Zin also figured prominently in the biblical
Book of Exodus, the region that Moses and the Israelites passed through
at the end of their forty-year flight out of Egypt. This provided a
handy theological and historical explanation for why a Christian nation
might want to explore the region, and when the British tried this tack
on Constantinople—repackaging their earlier offer so that it was now to
be an archaeological survey of biblical sites under the auspices of the
respected Palestine Exploration Fund—the ploy actually worked. It was
this ruse that had brought Lawrence and Woolley to Beersheva, and that
gave Newcombe the necessary cover for his military mapping teams.</p>
<p>Very quickly, whatever initial reservations Newcombe may have
harbored at being saddled with the two archaeologists were erased. In
Lawrence especially, he seemed to find a kindred spirit, a man so
indifferent to creature comforts and possessed of such astounding
endurance that it bordered on the masochistic.</p>
<p>He also detected a curious quirk in Lawrence’s personality, a
tendency to rise out of his core shyness in response to those who would
obfuscate or stand in his way. An early example of this was his verbal
torturing of the poor American oilmen in Beersheva. Most shy people tend
to become more so when faced with a potentially confrontational
situation, but with Lawrence and the Americans it had been precisely the
opposite, the young archaeologist turning the encounter into a game of
cat-and-mouse, with himself playing the cat. It indicated a streak of
gamesmanship in Lawrence, a quality that would stand him in good stead
as he faced off with the petty Ottoman officials who, Newcombe was sure,
would try to obstruct their every move.</p>
<p>But in fact, far more than the Ottomans, it was the “Wilderness” of
Zin itself that posed the greatest challenges to Lawrence and Woolley.
Operating independently of the military survey teams, although
frequently checked in on by Newcombe, they maintained a relentless pace
over the bleak terrain, driving their camels and small team of camp
orderlies to the point of ruin. At least these locals were accustomed to
the region; coming from the more temperate climes of northern Syria,
Lawrence and Woolley suffered terribly in the parched and sunbaked
land.</p>
<p>These discomforts might have been partially offset if they’d found
what they came to look for. They didn’t. Instead, other than a few ruins
dating from the Byzantine period or later, they found very few
structures at all in the region—and certainly nothing suggesting an
Exodus-era settlement.</p>
<p>But then there had always been something of a built-in fallacy to the
Zin project, one the Ottomans might have deduced if they’d pondered
matters a bit longer. In a landscape so inhospitable that even the hardy
Bedouin nomads abandoned it in summer, why would Moses and the
Israelites—forty years wandering in the desert and presumably eager to
finally get somewhere nice—have lingered in this hellhole any longer
than necessary? This was a point Lawrence touched on in a somewhat arch
letter to his parents: “The Palestine Fund, of course, wants to find
sites illustrating the Exodus, which is supposed to have passed this
way. But of course a people 40 years out of Egypt could hardly leave
much trace of themselves in their later camping grounds.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of November 12, 1913, Curt Prüfer made a most painful
decision. For a brief time it had appeared that he might finally attain
the respect and status he had always sought—as a scholar, as a sterling
example of the new Germany—but then it had all turned to ash. Actually,
it was worse than that, for in the bitter struggle waged over his
candidacy to a prestigious position in the Egyptian power structure,
Prüfer’s British enemies had not only made sure he was denied the post,
but professionally destroyed him in the process. On that morning, Prüfer
sat at his desk in the German embassy and composed a terse letter of
resignation from the foreign ministry, the institution that had been his
home for the previous seven years. A few days later, the now former
embassy official left for Jerusalem, there to await the arrival of his
artist friend Richard von Below for their extended journey up the
Nile.</p>
<p>In one of the more curious features of the European imperialist era,
the dueling European powers often employed an intricate
division-of-spoils system in their colonial realms with their imperial
rivals, a way both to secure acceptance of their claims to hegemony and
reduce those rivals’ incentive for stirring local unrest.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of scholarly prestige, few foreigner-allotted
positions in Cairo were more coveted than that of director of the
khedival library. Since the signing of a bilateral accord in 1906, that
post was reserved for a German. In late 1911, with the sitting German
director slated for retirement, the German embassy put forward the name
of Dr. Curt Prüfer as his replacement.</p>
<p>Its innocuous-sounding title notwithstanding, the post was a very
sensitive one. In Ottoman times, the khedive had been the designated
Egyptian head of state, and for the British to maintain the fiction that
they had somehow been acting as a guarantor of Ottoman rule by their
1882 invasion, they had kept the khedive on as a figurehead. Since 1892,
this had been Abbas Hilmi II. While Abbas was understandably never a big
supporter of British rule to begin with, his dissatisfaction had
dramatically deepened with Lord Kitchener’s arrival on the scene in
1911. As the new British agent to Egypt, Kitchener had quickly grown so
tired of Abbas—or as he preferred to call him, “this wicked little
khedive”—that he’d begun stripping him of even his purely ceremonial
duties. In response, Abbas had increasingly taken to using the offices
of his “library” to stay in quiet contact with a host of Egyptian
dissidents opposed to British rule.</p>
<p>Of course, what was bad for Britain was good for Germany, and by
their control of the library directorship the Germans enjoyed the
perfect cover to cultivate and maintain their own contacts with the
anti-British Egyptian community. This was precisely what the outgoing
German director had done, and in late 1911 the British had every
expectation that Dr. Curt Prüfer, now promoted from dragoman to Oriental
secretary at the German embassy, would uphold the tradition.</p>
<p>Certainly, Prüfer had done little to endear himself to the British
authorities in Cairo, having continued with the pan-Islamic
destabilizing efforts of his mentor, Max von Oppenheim. Most alarming to
the Cairo authorities, Prüfer had long maintained a close relationship
with a host of anti-British Egyptian figures, as well as with the
disgruntled khedive himself. Indeed, on several occasions, Egyptian
secret police had tracked the good doctor to clandestine meetings with
some of British Egypt’s most committed and dangerous enemies.</p>
<p>Consequently, placing such a man in the khedival library seemed a bit
like putting an arsonist in a fireworks factory; shortly after Prüfer’s
name was put forward, the British diplomatically informed the Germans
that his candidacy was “unsuitable.” The Germans pressed their case,
with the German ambassador in Cairo taking his spirited defense of
Prüfer’s nomination directly to Kitchener. At the end of October 1911
the German ambassador to Great Britain, Count Paul Metternich, took the
matter all the way up to British foreign secretary Edward Grey.</p>
<p>But the more the Germans pushed on the Prüfer issue, the more
suspicious the British became. In early 1912, Kitchener informed the
German embassy that the issue had been referred to the Egyptian
government’s Ministry of Education, where Prüfer’s candidacy had been
rejected anew. It was an utterly transparent maneuver—the so-called
Egyptian government would do exactly Britain’s bidding—but it did
finally bring an end to the matter. For Prüfer, it was a professionally
devastating turn of events. Not only had he been publicly humiliated in
losing the directorship, but with the intelligence reports of his
intrigues now well known throughout the British government, he was
effectively prevented from advancing further at the German embassy in
Cairo.</p>
<p>But that was the least of it. However much the elitist structure of
German society had been reformed in other spheres, those changes had not
permeated into the diplomatic branch of the foreign ministry; in 1912,
as in 1812, that branch was the province of the German aristocracy, its
counts and princelings and noblemen. Indeed, no better example existed
of the near impossibility of an outsider being admitted to this
exclusive club than the long and futile struggle of Prüfer’s mentor,
Count von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>Although highly educated and clearly brilliant, Oppenheim possessed
one fatal flaw in the eyes of the German diplomatic branch—he was of
Jewish ancestry—and that had been enough to defeat his many efforts over
some two decades to win a transfer from the far less prestigious
consular branch. He probably came closest in 1898, when his request was
accompanied by a raft of supporting letters from gentile German
aristocrats, friends of his from the Union Club in Berlin, except that
Oppenheim had the misfortune of submitting his petition at the same time
as another Jew. In the entire history of the German diplomatic service
there had been only one Jewish member, a Rothschild, and the notion that
there might suddenly be two more cast alarm.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely persuaded,” a senior foreign ministry official wrote
in response to the situation, “that what we have here is not a question
of one Jew, but of his numerous coreligionists who will press through
the breach which he makes.… If [even] one is let in, a cry of
lamentation will ensue if others are refused.” On such concerns, both
applications were promptly denied.</p>
<p>On paper, the chances of Curt Prüfer—a lower-middle-class commoner
with a doctorate from a middling university—passing into the foreign
ministry’s higher ranks looked nearly as bleak as Oppenheim’s, but his
Oriental secretary appointment had afforded a glimmer of hope; this was
the one consular branch position where an elevation into the diplomatic
branch occasionally occurred. Obviously, the odds of that happening
would have been vastly improved had Prüfer assumed the library
directorship. Conversely, having fought for that posting and lost, his
odds now were exactly nil.</p>
<p>Through 1912 and most of 1913, Prüfer struggled on, but he found it
impossible to escape the cloak of ignominy that had been cast over him.
With the Egyptian secret police now watching his every move, even his
adventurist activities as Oriental secretary were greatly curtailed. It
was for this—and perhaps also a simple desire to try something
completely new with his life—that he finally tendered his resignation
and went off to join Richard von Below. What he went away with was an
abiding hatred for the British, the “natural enemy” of Germany, now also
the people who had destroyed his career.</p>
<p>On a broader level, though, the controversy that surrounded Prüfer
over the library directorship neatly illustrated a particularly ominous
feature of the early 1910s. While it already strained credulity that
Lord Kitchener, the uncrowned sovereign of twelve million people in one
of Britain’s most important vassal states, had been compelled to
personally engage in that controversy, how had it ever escalated to the
point where the British foreign secretary and his closest advisors were
enjoined? Did these men really have nothing better to do with their time
than compose and debate lengthy memoranda over the job placement of a
low-level German embassy official in Cairo?</p>
<p>In the answer to that question lies one of the keys to how World War
I happened. By the early 1910s, with all the European powers perpetually
jockeying for advantage, all of them constantly manufacturing crises in
hopes of winning some small claim against their rivals, a unique kind of
“fog of war” was setting in, one composed of a thousand petty slights
and disputes and misunderstandings. It wasn’t just the British foreign
secretary whose time was taken up dealing with such things, but the
foreign ministers—and in many cases, the prime ministers and presidents
and kings—of all the powers, and often over struggles even less
significant than that which entangled Curt Prüfer. Amid this din of
complaint and trivial offense, how to know what really mattered, how to
identify the true crisis when it came along?</p>
<p>THE GULF OF Aqaba is a narrow, hundred-mile-long inlet of the Red Sea
that separates the craggy desert mountains of Arabia to one side from a
similar set of mountains on the Sinai Peninsula to the other. At the
northernmost end of the Aqaba inlet is the Jordanian town of the same
name.</p>
<p>In 1914, Aqaba was nothing more than a tiny fishing village, its
thousand or so inhabitants settled into a collection of crude huts
sprinkled about the shoreline. Yet it was Aqaba, more than any other
spot in the roughly four thousand square miles that he and his Royal
Engineers were mapping, that obsessed Captain Stewart Newcombe.</p>
<p>In trying to anticipate the path an invasion force might take from
Ottoman Palestine to reach the Suez Canal, certainly the most logical
route was across the very top of the Sinai Peninsula, close to the
Mediterranean. This was an established land crossing going back
millennia, and its water sources, if meager, had been tapped and welled
for just as long. Inland, the harsh Zin Desert seemed to afford few real
possibilities, an assessment gradually being confirmed by Newcombe’s
men. By early February 1914, they had surveyed much of the border
region’s interior, and while finding a few Bedouin trails and wells, had
uncovered nothing capable of sustaining an invasion force of any
size.</p>
<p>But in all this, Aqaba, lying at the very southern end of the
Sinai-Palestine demarcation line, represented a wild card. With its
outlet on the Red Sea, troops could be ferried into the village and then
marched west. For well over a decade, persistent rumors had the Turks
secretly building a railroad spur linking Aqaba to the Arabian interior,
complementing the mountain trail already in existence. Rumors aside, it
was known that at least two “roads” originated somewhere in the Quweira
mountains above Aqaba, trails long used by local Bedouin to launch raids
into the Sinai. Taken all together, it meant the Turks might have the
potential of launching an invasion force across the Sinai from the very
southern end of the buffer zone, even while British attention was
focused at the more obvious northern end.</p>
<p>Understandably, then, Stewart Newcombe viewed getting into Aqaba as
the most crucial aspect of his entire mission to Zin. In mid-February
1914, he turned his attention to how he might do it and who should
accompany him.</p>
<p>History is often the tale of small moments—chance encounters or
casual decisions or sheer coincidence—that seem of little consequence at
the time, but somehow fuse with other small moments to produce something
momentous, the proverbial flapping of a butterfly’s wings that triggers
a hurricane. Such was the case with Captain Newcombe’s choosing a
companion for the journey to Aqaba.</p>
<p>Theoretically, he could have pulled any one of the Royal Engineers
off his five surveying parties, but as much as their technical expertise
might come in handy, he was expecting a cold reception in the village,
and the sight of two British officers rolling in would be unlikely to
improve it. He also could have chosen Leonard Woolley, whose somewhat
fusty manner would lend credence to this being a foray of purely
scientific interest. But instead he chose Lawrence. One reason was that
he genuinely enjoyed his company, but another was Lawrence’s peculiar
skill at polite belligerence that Newcombe had observed in a variety of
forms since the early days of the expedition, a skill likely to be
called upon in Aqaba.</p>
<p>Joined by Dahoum, Newcombe and Lawrence showed up in Aqaba in
mid-February, and, just as Newcombe had expected, their welcome was a
decidedly icy one. The municipal governor, professing to have no
knowledge of their project, immediately forbade them from doing any
mapping or photographing or archaeological work in the region. But just
as Newcombe had also expected, these strictures only spurred Lawrence to
greater initiative. “I photographed what I could,” Lawrence would
recount in a letter to a friend, Edward Leeds, “I archaeologised
everywhere.”</p>
<p>Of special interest to Lawrence—and this interest may have mainly
derived from the opportunity to flagrantly disregard the governor’s
orders—were the ruins of a fortress on a small island just a few hundred
yards off the Aqaba shore. He secretly arranged for a boatman to take
him to the island, only to have the man promptly arrested by the
governor’s police. Undeterred, Lawrence crafted a crude inflatable raft
and, together with Dahoum, paddled out to the island.</p>
<p>It was an easy enough passage going out, but rather a different story
on the return. With both the current and wind against them, it took
Lawrence and Dahoum hours to make the shore, at which point the local
police, long since alerted, took them into custody. The furious governor
placed the pair under armed escort for their journey out of Aqaba.
Unfortunately for the men detailed to this mission, the unwanted
entourage simply provided Lawrence with an amusing new challenge.</p>
<p>“I learnt that their orders were not to let me out of their sight,”
he wrote his family a week later from a town fifty miles to the north,
“and I took them two days afoot over such hills and wadis as did [them
in]. I have been camped here for two days, and they are still struggling
in from all over the compass.”</p>
<p>As a bonus, during this forced march Lawrence had stumbled across the
two “great cross-roads” that the Bedouin raiding parties used for their
forays into the Sinai.</p>
<p>All of this would prove profoundly useful to Lawrence. In just a
little over three years’ time, he would use the knowledge gained from
his escapades in Aqaba to conquer that strategic village in a manner
that no one else could conceive of, a feat of arms still considered one
of the most daring military exploits of modern times.</p>
<p>UPON PARTING WAYS with J. C. Hill in Jerusalem in early January,
William Yale and Rudolf McGovern set out for the Kornub massif. Reaching
it a few days after their humiliating encounter with Lawrence in
Beersheva, they immediately had reason to recall a very basic law of
chemical properties: namely, that it is not just oil mixed with water
that gives off an iridescent sheen. In the right concentrations, a wide
variety of minerals can, including iron, and it was precisely
this—stagnant water rich in iron tailings—that Hill had observed through
his binoculars from thirty miles away.</p>
<p>Crestfallen but determined to make the most of their arduous trip,
Yale and McGovern spent several days collecting rock samples and
drilling boreholes. From this, they determined there was oil in
Kornub—McGovern was fairly certain of that—but whether it existed in
anything near commercially viable quantities seemed unlikely. The two
then returned to Jerusalem, there to relay the sobering news to Socony
headquarters.</p>
<p>Curiously, and for reasons Yale and McGovern couldn’t begin to fathom
at the time, 26 Broadway didn’t seem to share their sense of
disappointment. The two were told to lie low in Jerusalem, which they
did until mid-March, and were then dispatched for more fruitless
exploration of the last of the three prospective concessionary zones, in
the hill region of Thrace just to the west of Constantinople. Tucked
away in the backwaters of the Ottoman Empire, Yale remained unaware that
news of the Kornub “strike” had triggered a complex diplomatic
tug-of-war, one that was playing out across four continents and
involving ambassadors, ministers of state, and some half dozen
international corporations.</p>
<p>When the British had pinpointed the location of Socony’s interests in
Palestine, courtesy of Lawrence’s interrogation of Yale outside
Beersheva, alarm had spread throughout the government. With access to
oil now considered a matter of national security in light of the Royal
Navy’s ongoing oil-conversion program, taking control of any new fields
was not merely an economic concern but a political one. There followed a
complicated series of maneuvers in which the British authorities tried
to sabotage the Kornub deal and arrange for a British oil company to
obtain the concessions. In this cause they relied on information from
one of the Palestinian concession holders, Suleiman Nassif, who deftly
played each side against the other to his own benefit. It was at this
juncture that McGovern’s disheartening report on Kornub finally reached
New York, but by then it was too late. Caught up in the spirit of
competition, Socony not only disregarded McGovern’s findings but
ultimately paid a far higher price for the Kornub concessions than
intended.</p>
<p>None of this was known to Yale and McGovern until they returned to
Constantinople from Thrace in late April. There they were met by their
old boss, J. C. Hill, who informed them that, having just secured the
Kornub concessions for a period of twenty-five years, Socony was now
gearing up for a massive exploration project in the region, one that
would entail building roads, erecting worker camps in the desert,
bringing in trucks and drilling equipment and heavy machinery.
Furthermore, Socony was sending the three of them to Egypt, there to
oversee the purchasing and to coordinate the delivery of all the
matériel needed. That this was an area of expertise in which they had no
knowledge was deemed unimportant; by the late spring of 2014, Yale,
McGovern, and Hill were in Egypt contemplating a daunting stack of
purchasing manuals in Socony’s Alexandria office.</p>
<p>But in this new task, the three men could draw on a powerful guiding
principle: they were Standard men, and above all else, William Yale was
increasingly coming to realize, that meant taking charge, making
decisions. Within a few days of sifting through those purchasing
manuals, and without ever seeking the counsel of someone who might know
what they were doing, they had ordered up some 50,000 worth of drilling
equipment (about 0 million in today’s equivalent) for the inauguration
of Socony’s new operation in the Kornub. That equipment, purchased from
a variety of vendors throughout the United States, would take several
months to arrive in Palestine—actual drilling was scheduled to begin on
November 1—but in the meantime, an enormous amount of work was to be
done.</p>
<p>The first step was to cut a road from Hebron down through the Judean
foothills, and then across some twenty miles of virtually trackless
desert to Kornub. This aspect of the project would prove immensely
important in the near future. Yale was put in charge of this, and he
contracted the best road builder in Palestine to do it. Even so, there
were glitches. A near riot developed in Hebron when the road surveyors
took to marking the walls of houses in their path with crosses in white
paint, a symbol the devoutly Muslim residents interpreted as marking
them for conversion to Christianity. On another occasion, Bedouin
riflemen attacked one of the construction crews out in the foothills;
the assault was finally repelled by Socony’s own private militia.</p>
<p>But as Yale was well aware, the biggest hurdles awaited at either end
of that road. All the drilling equipment being brought over from the
United States would need to come in at the Mediterranean port of
Jaffa—except there were no cranes in Jaffa capable of unloading such
heavy machinery. Then there was the niggling little detail to be worked
out at the other end of the line. One thing that makes a desert a desert
is, of course, a lack of water, and while McGovern had managed to locate
a few small wells in the Kornub area, the supply seemed barely
sufficient for the twenty-man work crew that would be living there, let
alone provide the huge amounts needed for the highly water-dependent
drilling process. As with so many other parts of the project, however,
this issue failed to set off alarm bells within Socony, and if a problem
isn’t acknowledged, does it really need a solution?</p>
<p>As work got under way, Yale was held by an ever-deepening sense of
foreboding. “Secretly,” he wrote, “I dreaded the mess, which seemed an
inevitable outcome of the systemless way the Chief [J. C. Hill] handled
matters.”</p>
<p>UPON HIS RETURN to Syria from his Zin adventure in early March,
Lawrence found a letter waiting for him from David Hogarth. It contained
wonderful news. Impressed by word of the previous season’s discoveries,
the British philanthropist who was the primary sponsor of the Carchemish
project had finally set aside enough funds to keep the excavations going
for an extended period—two more years at least, and possibly for as long
as it took for the site to be thoroughly explored. With this cheerful
news, Lawrence planned to quickly finish the Wilderness of Zin report
for the Palestine Exploration Fund during his upcoming break in England,
and then hurry back to Carchemish for an early beginning to the next
digging season.</p>
<p>For his return to England, Lawrence planned to first detour to
Baghdad and then pass down the Tigris River to the Indian Ocean,
figuring the much longer sea voyage this would entail would give him
more time to work on the Zin report. Instead, just as that season’s dig
was closing down in early June, a letter from Stewart Newcombe changed
his plan.</p>
<p>Newcombe, his work in southern Palestine finished, had visited
Carchemish in May en route to England. But of course Carchemish was not
really en route to anywhere, and Newcombe’s true motive for the detour
had been to continue overland to Constantinople in order to spy on the
progress being made by the Turks and Germans on the Baghdad Railway—and
in particular on their tunneling projects in the Taurus and Amanus
Mountains. He had succeeded in making the journey, but had been so
closely watched as to be unable to study the tunneling work in any
detail. In his June letter, Newcombe asked if Lawrence and Woolley might
follow the same path on their return to England and glean what they
could. Rather taking to their new roles as military intelligence
sleuths, the archaeologists readily agreed.</p>
<p>That journey proved to be another extraordinarily fortuitous
happenstance, but one that would ultimately play out very differently
from Lawrence’s trip to Aqaba. In the Taurus and Amanus Mountains he
would identify a crucial—and potentially devastating—Achilles’ heel of
the Ottoman Empire, one that, despite his most strenuous efforts during
the coming war, would never be exploited.</p>
<p>BACK IN HIS garden cottage at 2 Polstead Road in Oxford, Lawrence sat
down to write a long letter to a friend, James Elroy Flecker, on the
last Monday of June 1914. The bulk of the letter was taken up with a
picaresque description of a melee that had occurred between the German
railway engineers and their workers in Jerablus in May. But what is most
interesting about the letter is what it doesn’t mention. On the day that
Lawrence wrote it—Monday, June 29—the front page of almost every
newspaper in Britain told of the previous day’s assassination of the
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, together
with his wife, in the streets of Sarajevo by Serbian
revolutionaries.</p>
<p>The news out of Sarajevo seemed to make just as little impression on
Curt Prüfer and William Yale. His long Nile cruise with Richard von
Below over, by the end of June 1914, Prüfer was living in Munich, eking
out a modest living giving public lectures on Oriental languages; in his
diary, he made no mention of the Balkan assassinations. As for William
Yale, hard at work on the road project below Hebron, it appears he
didn’t even hear of them until some weeks later.</p>
<p>All of which was actually quite understandable; the public had become
thoroughly inured to the endless saber-rattling of the European imperial
powers, the “crises” that seemed to boil up and fall away every few
months, and there was no reason to think this one would play out any
differently. But Sarajevo was the crisis that counted, because those who
wanted war made it count. A very slow-burning fuse had been lit, one
that would take over a month to burn through, but when it did, in the
first days of August 1914, it would trigger a continent-wide war that
would ultimately carry everyone down into the abyss together.</p>
<p>In his letter to Flecker on June 29, Lawrence wrote that he expected
to be in England for another two or three weeks, and “thereafter
Eastward” to Carchemish. But Lawrence’s days as an archaeologist were
over.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-4-to-the-last-million">Chapter 4 To the Last
Million</h4>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to report that conditions are going from bad to
worse here.</p>
<p>U.S. CONSUL GENERAL IN BEIRUT, STANLEY HOLLIS, TO SECRETARY OF STATE,
NOVEMBER 9, 1914</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 7, 1914, Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener,
Britain’s newly appointed secretary of state for war, was called to his
first cabinet meeting with Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and other
senior ministers.</p>
<p>Kitchener’s selection for the War Office had come about almost by
chance. On a brief visit back to England from his post as British agent
to Egypt, he was just boarding a ship to leave when war was declared.
Asquith, figuring that appointing Britain’s most famous military hero to
lead that effort might have a salutary effect on public morale, had
skipped over a long line of prospective candidates in giving the
position to Kitchener.</p>
<p>At the time, boosting public morale seemed among the least of the
prime minister’s concerns. In Britain, as elsewhere across Europe, war
euphoria had gripped the populace, with great crowds gathering in public
squares to cheer the news. Most predictions were that this war would be
a very quick one, and in villages and cities across the continent,
reserve soldiers, anxious to escape the drudgery of factory and farm,
despaired at not being called up before this grand adventure passed them
by. The situation was slightly different in Britain, one of the few
European nations without mandatory conscription, but within days of the
war declaration the British government was already contemplating a halt
in recruitment, adjudging that it already had more volunteers signed up
than it could ever possibly need.</p>
<p>But in that summer of 1914, most everyone was overlooking a crucial
detail: that the weapons of war had changed so radically over the
previous forty years as to render the established notions of its conduct
obsolete. It was rather simple stuff, easy to miss—the machine gun; the
long-range artillery shell; barbed wire—but because of this oversight,
Europe was about to tumble into an altogether different conflict from
what most imagined.</p>
<p>One reason Europe’s imperial powers missed the warning signs was that
these new instruments of war had previously been employed almost
exclusively against those who didn’t have them—specifically, those
non-Europeans who attempted to resist their imperial reach. In such
situations, the new weapons had allowed for a lopsided slaughter not
seen since the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and more than any other
single factor had accounted for the dramatic expansion of Europe’s
colonial empires into Asia and Africa in the latter part of the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>It is perversely appropriate, then, that among the few people who did
appreciate this new face of war and the problems it would pose was the
man who had officiated over more of these one-sided battlefield
slaughters than probably anyone else alive: Lord Kitchener. At the
battle of Omdurman in the Sudan in 1898, Kitchener had trained his Maxim
machine guns on horsemen charging with spears; at a cost of forty-seven
British army dead, he had killed ten thousand of the enemy in a single
morning. But what would happen when the other side had Maxims too?
Kitchener had a pretty good idea. At that cabinet meeting on August 7,
where some other ministers imagined a conflict lasting months or even
weeks, the newly appointed war secretary predicted years. “It will not
end,” he told his colleagues, “until we have plumbed our manpower to the
last million.”</p>
<p>Naturally, these were words few wanted to hear, let alone pay heed
to. And so as if imagining that nothing had really changed since the
last great bout of European wars in Napoleonic times, the Scottish
Highlanders gathered up their bagpipes and kilts, the French cuirassiers
and Austrian lancers donned their armor breastplates and plumed helmets
and, to the accompaniment of buglers and drums, marched gaily off to
battle, not realizing until too late that their Europe was now to become
an abattoir, a slaughtering pen into which, over the next four years,
some ten million soldiers, along with an estimated six million
civilians, would be hurried forward to their deaths.</p>
<p>One would need to return to the Dark Ages or the depredations of
Genghis Khan to find a war as devastating. By point of comparison, over
the previous century, during which it had expanded its empire to five
continents, the British Empire had been involved in some forty different
conflicts around the globe—colonial insurrections mostly, but including
the Crimean and Boer wars—and had lost some forty thousand soldiers in
the process. Over the next four years, it would lose over twenty times
that number. In the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, France
had suffered an estimated 270,000 battlefield casualties; in the present
war, it was to surpass that number in the first three weeks. In this
conflict, Germany would see 13 percent of its military-age male
population killed, Serbia 15 percent of its total population, while in
just a two-year span, 1913 to 1915, the life expectancy of a French male
would drop from fifty years to twenty-seven. So inured would the
architects of the carnage become to such statistics that at the launch
of his 1916 Somme offensive, British general Douglas Haig could look
over the first day’s casualty rolls—with fifty-eight thousand Allied
soldiers dead or wounded, it remains the bloodiest single day in the
history of the English-speaking world—and judge that the numbers “cannot
be considered severe.”</p>
<p>The effect of all this on the collective European psyche would be
utterly profound. Initial euphoria would give way to shock, shock to
horror, and then, as the killing dragged on with no end in sight, horror
to a kind of benumbed despair.</p>
<p>In the process, though, the European public would come to question
some of the most basic assumptions about their societies. Among the
things they would realize was that, stripped of all its high-minded
justifications and rhetoric, at its core this war had many of the
trappings of an extended family feud, a chance for Europe’s kings and
emperors—many of them related by blood—to act out old grievances and
personal slights atop the heaped bodies of their loyal subjects. In
turn, Europe’s imperial structure had fostered a culture of decrepit
military elites—aristocrats and aging war heroes and palace
sycophants—whose sheer incompetence on the battlefield, as well as
callousness toward those dying for them, was matched only by that of
their rivals. Indeed, in looking at the conduct of the war and the
almost preternatural idiocy displayed by all the competing powers,
perhaps its most remarkable feature is that anyone finally won at
all.</p>
<p>In the end, the European public would look back on their war
celebrations of August 1914 as if from a different age entirely, a death
dance performed by gullible primitives. It would also give rise to an
exquisite irony. In this titanic struggle waged for empire—protecting
it, expanding it, chipping away at others’—four of the six great
imperial powers of Europe would disappear completely, while the two
survivors, Britain and France, would be so shattered as to never fully
recover. Into the breach would come two dueling totalitarian
ideologies—communism and fascism—as well as a new imperial power—the
United States—that, given the bad name its predecessors had attached to
the label, would forever protest its innocence of being one.</p>
<p>But in August 1914 all this was in the future. For now, Europe was
gripped by a kind of giddy relief that the years of posturing were over,
that der Tag had finally arrived.</p>
<p>In this, the Lawrence family of Oxford was in no way immune. Within
days of the war’s declaration, Frank Lawrence, the second youngest and
most military-minded of the five Lawrence boys, was given his commission
as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Gloucester Battalion. In India, Will
Lawrence swiftly made plans to return to England in order to enlist,
while Bob, the eldest, signed on with the Royal Army Medical Corps. By
month’s end, that left just fourteen-year-old Arnold and
twenty-six-year-old “Ned” at home.</p>
<p>For T. E. Lawrence, this home stay was imposed by forces beyond his
control. Although the Ottoman Empire had not joined in the August rush
to war, expectations in London were that it soon might—and probably on
the side of the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. If that
came to pass, the mapping expedition of southern Palestine that Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley had recently participated in could be of great
military importance. Under orders from Kitchener himself, the two young
archaeologists were told to forgo any thought of enlisting until they
had completed their report. So as others his age trooped off to boot
camp that August, Lawrence shuttled between his Polstead Road cottage
and the archives of the Ashmolean Museum, feverishly putting the final
touches on The Wilderness of Zin.</p>
<p>If Lawrence was mindful of the report’s significance, his comparative
lassitude infected him with a growing sense of desperation. In early
September, he and Woolley contacted Stewart Newcombe, their supervisor
on the Palestine expedition and now a ranking officer in military
intelligence, seeking his help in landing positions there. Newcombe
advised patience. Should Turkey enter the war on Germany’s side, he
explained, their services as Near East experts would be urgently needed,
and arranging their appointment would only be hampered if in the
meantime they threw themselves into the maw of the military
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>That advice didn’t sit at all well with Lawrence. Surely adding to
his gloom was that in those opening days the war did seem headed for the
early conclusion that most predicted—except with the wrong side
winning.</p>
<p>In provoking the conflict, German strategy had been predicated on an
extremely bold, even reckless scheme. The plan was to only lightly
defend its eastern frontier and cede ground against Russia’s advancing
armies, while launching a massive offensive against the French and
British armies to the west in hopes of knocking those countries out of
the war before they could fully mobilize. With that front thus closed
down, the Germans could then turn their full attention to the
Russians.</p>
<p>By the beginning of September, it appeared as if the Germans might
succeed beyond their wildest dreams. On the Western Front, their armies
had swept through neutral Belgium and then turned south, scattering the
disorganized French and British forces before them. They now stood on
the banks of the Marne River, just thirty miles from Paris. The surprise
had come on the Eastern Front, where rather than simply employing
defensive stalling tactics as planned, a vastly outnumbered German army
had leapt to the attack; it had already annihilated one blundering
Russian invasion force, and was about to destroy another. “Home by
Christmas” suddenly seemed a conservative slogan, and for the soldiers
of the Triple Entente—Great Britain, France, and Russia—a haunting
one.</p>
<p>But then in the second week of September the tide abruptly turned. In
the engagement that would become known as the “miracle of the Marne,”
the British and French checked the German advance and began slowly to
push them back through the French countryside. This war was not going to
be the “short, cleansing thunderstorm” the German chancellor had so
confidently predicted; instead, after six weeks of combat, as many as
half a million men were already dead, and stalemate was setting in.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, to be holed up in the leafy confines of Oxford at such
a time, poring over a half-inch-to-the-mile map of an empty desert a
thousand miles from the nearest battlefield, must have felt a terribly
painful academic exercise. What’s more, he surely reasoned, the reversal
of fortunes in France meant his purgatory was likely to continue; if the
Turks hadn’t come into the war when it appeared Germany was running the
table, why do so now when the Germans were retreating?</p>
<p>“I am writing a learned work on Moses and his wanderings,” he acidly
wrote to a friend in Lebanon on September 18. “I have a horrible fear
that the Turks do not intend to go to war.”</p>
<p>IF LAWRENCE HADN’T appreciated the warning signs in the run‑up to
war, William Yale, overseeing the construction of the Standard Oil road
in southern Palestine, missed them completely. In fact, just as a
telegram delivered to an Oklahoma oilfield had presaged his being
dispatched to the Near East, so a second telegram to his remote
construction camp in the Palestinian desert nearly a year later informed
him of the war’s outbreak.</p>
<p>With all work on the road project brought to an immediate stop, Yale
hurried back to Jerusalem that August. He found a city in tumult. Among
the sizable expatriate community of Europeans and Americans, most
families were already packing up for the journey home. Leaving ahead of
them in answer to their governments’ general mobilization calls were the
French and German men of fighting age (the British wouldn’t initiate a
draft until early 1916).</p>
<p>“We went down to the railroad station to see them off,” Yale
remembered. “Like young collegians on their way to a football game they
shouted, cheered, and sang. As the train for Jaffa pulled out of the
yards, the Germans in one car sang enthusiastically Deutschland über
alles, while the Frenchmen in another car sang just as lustily, La
Marseillaise. The friends of yesterday were off on their great
adventure.”</p>
<p>In contrast to the frenzied activity around him, the American oilman
suddenly found he had little to do. With the United States staying out
of the war, Socony headquarters ordered Yale to remain in Palestine,
figuring he could at least watch over the company’s soon-to-arrive oil
drilling equipment until they decided on their next move. But even this
caretaker task was soon mooted. Invoking a state-of-emergency decree,
the Ottoman government requisitioned the incoming fleet of Standard Oil
trucks as soon as they were unloaded at the Jaffa docks. Shortly
afterward, the British navy stopped the freighter bringing most of
Socony’s piping and drilling machinery to Palestine and diverted all of
it to an impoundment lot in Egypt.</p>
<p>With the community of foreigners in Jerusalem now reduced to a
handful, Yale passed his time that late summer by playing tennis and
canasta, and engaging in long, obsessive discussions with his fellow
expatriates about what might come next in world events. A special focus
of these discussions was trying to read the tea leaves of regional
politics, sifting for clues as to whether or not the Young Turks in
Constantinople would take their country into the fray. For a young man
given to action, this imposed quietude was maddening, and Yale grew
increasingly anxious for something to do.</p>
<p>But the old admonishment to be careful what you wish for soon found
application when Yale was asked to play minder to a dozen unruly
American oil workers. The men, most from Texas or Oklahoma, had been
part of the intended work crew at the Kornub drilling site, and had been
aboard the same freighter that the British diverted to Egypt. With time
on their hands and money in their pockets, the oil workers proceeded to
cut such a scandalous swath through the streets of Cairo—no mean feat in
that libertine city—that the local Socony office had sent telegrams to
headquarters urging that they be returned to the United States. Instead,
26 Broadway decided to forward the men to Yale, perhaps hoping that a
stint in the Holy Land might serve to reacquaint them with their
Christian virtues.</p>
<p>If so, that hope was misplaced. If anything, the opportunity to tread
the land of Jesus seemed to spur the oilmen to even more outrageous
public behavior. In observing this, as well as their office’s rapidly
dwindling cash reserves—the war in Europe had brought a temporary halt
to international money transfers—Yale and his supervisor decided that a
neat solution to both problems lay in withholding the men’s pay and
instead placing them on five-dollar-a-week allowances. Sensitive to the
workers’ disappointment with this arrangement, on allowance day Yale
took to disbursing the money with one hand while holding a loaded
six-shooter in the other.</p>
<p>But his troublesome charges also served a very useful function. In
constant contact with Jerusalem’s most unsavory residents, the oilmen
were like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine, the first recipients
of every dark rumor floating through the city—and with the spreading war
in Europe, those rumors were turning exceedingly dark. It was precisely
at tense times like these that the rich mosaic of the Ottoman world—a
mosaic composed of a myriad of religious and tribal and ethnic
groups—could quite easily become a grim counterimage of itself, a place
where the various communities drew protectively inward, and where
ancient feuds and suspicions and jealousies exploded into violence. Not
surprisingly, this danger was greatest in the most “mixed” corners of
the empire, and with its mélange of Arab and Turk and Armenian, of
Muslim and Jew and Christian, all living cheek by jowl, there was no
more cosmopolitan city in the Near East than Jerusalem.</p>
<p>By the end of August, stories were floating in from the countryside
of Muslim vigilante armies forming, of Jews and Armenians being
attacked, and while most of these tales proved false, they fed the
ever-thickening air of tension. In the Old City, shopkeepers were
raising prices and hoarding their wares, ever more convinced that
Constantinople would soon enter the war. What was still not at all
clear, though, was which side it might join, and another fault line
formed between those hoping for the Triple Entente of Britain, France,
and Russia and those desiring the Central Powers of Germany and
Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>On September 8, the sense of menace took more personal form for Yale
and the other foreigners remaining in the city. Taking advantage of the
chaos in Europe, the Young Turk government announced an end to the
Capitulations, the humiliating concessions extracted by Western powers
over the previous four centuries that largely exempted foreigners from
Ottoman law. Yale noticed the effect immediately. Previously obsequious
local officials became haughty, demanding. On Jerusalem’s narrow
sidewalks, residents no longer automatically stepped to the street at
the approach of a Western “white man.” On one occasion, when Yale and a
couple of other foreign residents were visiting the Mount of Olives, a
group of young boys pelted them with stones. To Yale, Jerusalem more and
more felt like a pile of tinder in search of a match.</p>
<p>FOR OTHERS IN Palestine, the revoking of the Capitulations took on
far more ominous import than a little stone-throwing. Left particularly
vulnerable were the tens of thousands of Jewish émigrés who had come
into the region over the previous thirty years.</p>
<p>Most had come in two successive waves. The first, of which the
Aaronsohn family had been a part, had been an exodus out of central and
southeastern Europe in the 1880s. This was followed by a second aliyah
(literally “ascent” in Hebrew) in the early 1900s, mainly composed of
Russian Jews escaping a new round of czarist political persecution and
state-sanctioned pogroms. Although culturally these groups were very
different—most of the first-wave émigrés tended to be religious and
socially conservative, while many in the second were secular
socialists—what they shared was that under the terms of the
Capitulations many remained citizens of their birthplace.</p>
<p>That arrangement had historically worked to the benefit of both the
émigrés and the Western powers. With it, the Jews had recourse to the
protection of their former homelands, just as those foreign governments
were given legal pretext to meddle in Ottoman affairs under the guise of
tending to their transplanted citizens. While this bizarre system gave
rise to a number of paradoxes, surely none was more grotesque than the
spectacle of czarist Russia stoutly defending the rights and well-being
of its Jewish citizens in Palestine, while systematically brutalizing
that same religious minority inside Russia. With the revoking of the
Capitulations, all this was coming to an end. Additionally, if Turkey
did finally join the war, at least one portion of this Jewish community
was likely headed for an unpleasant future; with thousands of the
first-wave émigrés still holding Austro-Hungarian passports, and
thousands from the second holding Russian ones, one group or the other
was going to end up being classified as “belligerent nationals.” As had
already happened to countless innocent civilians across the breadth of
Europe, the losers in this lottery could then be subject to deportation
or internment.</p>
<p>In all this, most of the residents of Zichron Yaakov, including the
Aaronsohn family, actually benefited from a different paradox. These
Romanian Jews had come to Palestine after being effectively barred from
citizenship in an independent Romania. By default, they thus remained
citizens of Romania’s preindependence master, namely the Ottoman Empire.
Unlike other Jews in Palestine, then, Aaron Aaronsohn and other Zichron
residents could look upon the revocation of the Capitulations with a
measure of equanimity, perhaps even a touch of schadenfreude.</p>
<p>That sentiment was extremely short-lived, however, for the very next
day, September 9, Constantinople announced a general mobilization of its
armed forces. Under the curious rationale that this was necessary to
“preserve Ottoman neutrality,” the mobilization called for male citizens
between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five to show up for military
conscription. Worse, this edict extended to most all
citizens—traditionally, Jews and a number of Christian sects had been
exempt—and the regime was further rescinding the age-old system whereby
the affluent could escape service by payment of a special bedel, or
tax.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn was sufficiently acquainted with the Ottoman way of
governance to know that this last clause meant nothing of the sort—it
simply meant that obtaining an exemption now would entail paying more
bribes to more officials—but the mobilization deeply worried the
agronomist on a broader level. As recent events in Europe illustrated,
an army called up almost always meant an army going to war; once the
machinery and bureaucracy of war had been set in motion and popular
hysteria properly ginned up, there was simply no easy way to shut it all
down again. Ever since the outbreak of the European conflict, Aaronsohn
had heard a rash of conflicting rumors from his friends in the Ottoman
military and political hierarchy over what Constantinople might do, and
this cloudiness was exacerbated by the vague picture to be gleaned of
what was occurring in Europe. In the face of such uncertainty,
Aaronsohn, like most of the Jewish residents of Palestine, simply clung
to the hope that reason might yet prevail and the war be avoided.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears his apprehensions had less to do with which
side Turkey might join than with the act of joining itself. Part of this
may have stemmed from a common denominator in European wars going back
to the Crusades—no matter who won or lost, the one fairly reliable
constant was that Jews somewhere were going to suffer—but it was also
born of a particular feature of Ottoman war-making. In the event of
conflict, both military and civilian authorities would suddenly have
license to embark on a wholesale requisitioning spree—“pillaging” might
be a more apt term—as they grabbed up whatever they deemed necessary for
the war effort. While this campaign was sure to affect Arab and Jewish
villages alike, it would naturally be more zealous in those modern or
prosperous places that had more to offer—places like Zichron Yaakov and
Athlit, for example. Already by mid-September 1914, the Aaronsohn family
and their neighbors in Zichron began hiding away whatever they had of
value, braced for the ruinous arrival of the requisition officer.</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of September 4, 1914, Curt Prüfer was in a room of
the Hotel Germania in Constantinople meeting with a burly, blond-haired
German man in his thirties named Robert Mors. Until recently, Mors had
been a policeman in the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria, and their
main topic of conversation that afternoon was how they might destroy the
British administration in Egypt through a campaign of bombings,
assassinations, and Islamic insurrection. The two men even bandied about
ideas on how best to blow up the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Their meeting was remarkable on both a personal and political level.
Just a month earlier, Prüfer had been scratching out a modest living
delivering lectures on Oriental languages in Munich; now he was a key
operative in an intelligence mission so secretive that its existence was
known to probably fewer than three dozen people in the world. That’s
because the ultimate purpose of this mission was to bring the
still-neutral Ottoman Empire into the war, and among those with no
inkling of Prüfer’s activities in Constantinople could be included
virtually the entire Young Turk political leadership. Credit for this
peculiar set of circumstances belonged to Prüfer’s old mentor, Max von
Oppenheim, and to one of the stranger diplomatic accords ever put to
paper.</p>
<p>As the war clouds had thickened over Europe during that long summer
of 1914, a clear majority of the thirty or so senior members of the
Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the junta that controlled the
empire, wanted to stay clear of the coming European firestorm. A small
faction, however, had energetically sought to form an alliance with the
Triple Entente, while another, led by thirty-two-year-old war minister
Enver Pasha, tried to do the same with the Central Powers. Enver won
out. In a case of exquisitely poor timing, he had signed a mutual
defense treaty with Germany on the afternoon of August 2, just hours
before Germany declared war on Russia and the conflict began.</p>
<p>Except, as it turned out, Enver Pasha had conducted these
negotiations without ever consulting most of his CUP colleagues; indeed,
at the time of the accord’s signing, only three or four of Enver’s
closest confederates were aware of it. Even more astounding, Enver
continued to withhold this information from the rest of the Turkish
government throughout the first weeks of the war. As the young war
minister told his impatient German allies, he needed more time to lay
the groundwork before dropping this little surprise on his ministerial
colleagues. To that end, a precipitating event, something that might
turn both the nation and the rest of the Young Turk leadership away from
the prevailing neutralist sentiment, could prove very handy.</p>
<p>Enver had come to the right people for, as neutral Belgium had
recently learned, precipitating events was something of a German
specialty. To help out his secret Turkish ally, Kaiser Wilhelm II could
think of no better guide than Max von Oppenheim and his preachings on
pan-Islamic revolt. If Islamic insurrection could be fostered in the
various Muslim territories controlled by the British—and most especially
in that land Britain had stolen from Constantinople, Egypt—surely it
would be obvious to both the leadership and populace of the Ottoman
Empire that they needed to come into the war.</p>
<p>But if the ultimate goal was to bring Turkey in, at least some in the
German high command that autumn saw an upside to it remaining neutral
just a bit longer. So long as it did, the Ottoman Empire could serve as
the ideal launch pad for German destabilization efforts, a kind of
Trojan horse from which to carry out attacks on the surrounding British
colonies with very little risk of repercussion. That neutrality could
also serve as a convenient shield while Germany laid the groundwork for
the most important military operation to be conducted in the region, an
assault on the Suez Canal. In mid-August, the kaiser signed a secret
directive calling for the creation of the Nachrichtenstelle für den
Orient (Intelligence Bureau for the East), to be based in Constantinople
and to serve as the central clearinghouse for Germany’s subversion
campaigns in the Near East. The director of that bureau was to be Max
von Oppenheim. Among Oppenheim’s first acts upon assuming the post was
to put out an offer of employment to his former protégé, Curt
Prüfer.</p>
<p>Oppenheim’s confidence in his apprentice was certainly deserved. No
sooner had he checked into the Hotel Germania on the evening of
September 3 than Prüfer set to work. Early the next morning, he met with
one of Enver Pasha’s chief lieutenants, a young Turkish staff officer
named Omar Fawzi Bey, and together they worked up a whole list of
prospective projects to strike at British Egypt: hiring Bedouin
tribesmen to attack isolated British garrisons along the Suez Canal;
sneaking so-called komitadji units of underground fighters into the
country to foment Islamic insurrection; launching a terror campaign of
targeted assassinations and indiscriminate bombings. Even if he remained
dubious of some of the more novel schemes put forward by Fawzi Bey and
his confederates—one involved scuttling a cement-laden freighter at the
narrowest point of the Suez Canal—Prüfer appreciated the enthusiasm and
creative thinking that went into them.</p>
<p>When not plotting with Fawzi Bey or Sheikh Shawish, an Egyptian
firebrand hated and feared by the British, Prüfer was in regular
conference with the four or five other Nachrichtenstelle operatives who
had already arrived in the Turkish capital. At these meetings, often
also attended by the three or four German embassy officials clued to
Oppenheim’s scheme, ambitious plans were laid for sabotage and
subversion campaigns throughout the Muslim world: in Egypt, in Russian
Central Asia, in Afghanistan, even as far away as India.</p>
<p>It was at the conclusion of one such meeting on the afternoon of
September 7 that Prüfer was brought before the man who had made it all
possible, Minister of War Enver Pasha. Small, extravagantly uniformed,
and extraordinarily handsome—“the handsomest man in the Turkish army,”
the New York Times gushed—Enver had piercing dark eyes and a dramatic
mustache, upturned and waxed in the Prussian style. That was not
coincidence. As the military liaison to Germany in the early 1910s, he
had quickly assumed the manner and style of its military elite, and now
fancied himself more Prussian than the Prussians. Although Curt Prüfer
was never much given to psychoanalysis, the few words he scribbled into
his diary that night in describing the thirty-two-year-old Enver—by four
months Prüfer’s junior—offer one of the more incisive portraits of the
man who was to practically single-handedly destroy the Ottoman Empire:
“A man of stone. A face immovable, well-formed, beautiful in the
feminine sense. Groomed to the point of foppishness. Along with a streak
of shocking hardness. ‘We can be more cruel than the British.’ The man
wants something, but the something does not come.”</p>
<p>But of all the meetings he attended and the schemes he heard in those
first few days in Constantinople, Prüfer was most intrigued by the
unique situation facing Robert Mors, the cashiered Alexandria policeman.
Mors had happened to be out of Egypt when the war began and, not
surprisingly in light of his German citizenship, been summarily
dismissed from his post by the British authorities. But in one of those
quaint touches of “gentlemen’s war” that still typified World War I in
its early days, the British were granting Mors safe passage back to
Alexandria in order to collect his stranded family. To Prüfer, this made
Mors the ideal conduit for launching his subversion campaign. Given his
status as a privileged European, Mors was also far more likely than a
local to be able to secrete contraband articles among his personal
possessions—and here Prüfer was thinking of bomb-making components—and
smuggle them into the country. To impress the former policeman on the
importance of his mission, Prüfer arranged an audience with Enver Pasha
the day before Mors was to sail for Alexandria with bombing detonators
hidden in his luggage. The Turkish war minister warmly thanked Mors for
his service.</p>
<p>Even though the British quickly suspected some sort of pact had been
struck between Enver and the German high command, they remained utterly
in the dark as to the specifics. Their apprehensions grew, however, once
Prüfer and Oppenheim’s other intelligence bureau operatives began
showing up in Constantinople. “Even without [Turkey joining the] war,”
British ambassador Louis Mallet cabled to London on September 15,
“German machinations are so various here that I should not be surprised
if they managed to engineer some scheme against the Canal, either by
means of a so-called neutral ship from [the] Syrian coast, or by agents
on land.”</p>
<p>Against this were the constant assurances the British ambassador was
given by Ottoman government officials. From the sultan and prime
minister on down, Mallet heard the steady refrain that Turkey had no
militarist intentions and only wished to stay out of the European
conflict. While certainly some of these protesting senior officials were
dissembling, others were not; incredibly, many still had no inkling of
Enver’s August 2 accord with Germany.</p>
<p>Mallet took his suspicions directly to Enver on October 5. Along with
his other talents, however, Enver was a skilled liar. Not only did he
deny any sinister intent behind the troop movements in Palestine but,
according to Mallet, “laughed at [the] idea of individual Germans
undertaking irresponsible enterprises against [the] Canal or
elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Except the Turkish war minister was about to get caught out. A few
days prior to Mallet’s meeting with Enver, Robert Mors had been arrested
at Alexandria harbor with his bombing detonators. Facing possible
execution under Egypt’s martial law statutes, he soon told his
interrogators all he knew of the German-Turkish plots against Egypt, as
well as of his best-wishes audience with Enver Pasha on the eve of his
voyage. Mors was especially expansive when it came to his relationship
with Omar Fawzi Bey and Curt Prüfer. For Prüfer, the most damning part
came when the foiled smuggler readily admitted that the detonators in
his luggage had been intended for use with bombs being manufactured in
Egypt. When asked how he knew that, Mors replied, “Because once I found
Sheikh Shawish sitting with Dr. Prüfer in the latter’s room at the Hotel
Germania. They were copying in Arabic a recipe for making bombs.… [It]
contained directions, a list of the component chemicals, and a sketch of
a bomb in the right-hand bottom corner.”</p>
<p>The British in Cairo showed considerable forbearance in the Mors
incident, presumably in hopes that the more moderate elements in the
Constantinople regime might yet rein in the adventurist Enver and keep
Turkey out of the war. At his hastily held court-martial, Mors was
sentenced to life in prison, while all mention of his meeting with the
Turkish war minister was withheld from the public record. Cairo
authorities were less forgiving of the man who had once lived in their
midst. For his central role in the Mors affair, Curt Prüfer was to soon
have a British bounty on his head.</p>
<p>THE OLD War Office Building at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue and
Whitehall in central London is an imposing neo-baroque structure, a
five-story monolith of white Portland stone with thirty-foot-high
cupolas at each of its corners. Inside, it has the feel of a
particularly elegant gentlemen’s club, with marble staircases linking
its floors, great crystal chandeliers, and mosaic-tiled hallways. In the
more select of its nearly one thousand rooms, the walls are oak-paneled
with niches cut out for marble fireplaces. In autumn 1914, this building
was headquarters to Great Britain’s Imperial General Staff, those
seniormost officers tasked with overseeing their nation’s war effort. It
was also to this building that T. E. Lawrence, at last done with his
Wilderness of Zin report, was dispatched in mid-October to take up his
new position as a civilian cartographer in the General Staff’s
Geographical Section.</p>
<p>By then, “Section” was rapidly becoming a misnomer, for within a week
of Lawrence’s arrival, the last of the office’s military cartographers
was shipped off to the battlefront in France, leaving just him and his
immediate supervisor behind. Thus Lawrence quickly found himself doing
the work of a half dozen men: organizing the various war-theater maps,
adding new details as reports came in from the front, briefing senior
commanders on those maps’ salient features.</p>
<p>One might imagine that for a young man—Lawrence had just turned
twenty-six—to be suddenly thrust into the very nerve center of his
nation’s military command, to be in daily conference with generals and
admirals, would be a heady experience. But one would imagine wrong. To
the contrary, Lawrence seemed to take a decidedly jaundiced view of his
new surroundings, its denizens fresh grist for his mordant wit.</p>
<p>Part of his disdain may have stemmed from how much military culture
resembled that of the English public school system of which he was a
product: the endless bowing and scraping to authority; the rigidly
defined hierarchical structure as denoted by the special ties worn by
upperclassmen and prefects in the schools, by the number of hash marks
and pips on coatsleeves in the military; the special privileges bestowed
or denied as a result. As Lawrence quipped to a friend shortly after
arriving at the War Office, it appeared that the truly grand staircases
of the building were reserved for the exclusive use of field marshals
and “charwomen,” or cleaning ladies.</p>
<p>His lack of awe probably also derived from the overall caliber of the
building’s occupants. With most active-service military officers now in
France, the General Staff had been filled out with men brought up from
the reserves or mustered out of retirement, and even to Lawrence’s
untrained eye it was clear many hadn’t a clue of what they were supposed
to be doing. As in any institution, this sense of inadequacy was often
masked by an aura of extreme self-importance: at the War Office, freshly
minted colonels and generals were forever striding briskly down
hallways, memos in hand, or calling urgent staff meetings, or sending
one of the Boy Scout messenger boys up to the Geographical Section for
the latest map of Battlefield X, to be supplied ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>One by-product of this climate of puffery, however, was that it led
directly to Lawrence’s being inducted into the military, the
circumstances of which provided him with one of his favorite later
anecdotes.</p>
<p>Shortly after starting at the General Staff, he was ushered into the
august presence of General Henry Rawlinson. Rawlinson was about to leave
London to take up command of British forces in Belgium, and Lawrence had
been summoned to brief him on the newly updated Belgian field maps.
Except, according to Lawrence, Rawlinson went apoplectic at the sight of
his civilian dress, and bellowed, “I want to talk to an officer!” Since
the Geographical Section now consisted of just two men, Lawrence was
immediately bundled off to the Army and Navy Store, there to get himself
fitted out as a second lieutenant, while the paperwork for his
“commission” was hastily drawn up. The uniform wouldn’t truly solve the
problem, however; in the years ahead, Lawrence’s disregard for military
protocol, manifested both in a usually unkempt appearance and a relaxed
manner that bordered on the insolent, would drive his superior officers
to distraction time and again.</p>
<p>But if he was now in the military, however haphazardly, Lawrence’s
work at the War Office was bringing him no closer to the arena of
action. Since he fell below the minimum height standard of the British
army, he needed a situation where his expertise might outweigh his
physical shortcomings, and the only possible scenario meeting that
criterion was, once again, if Turkey came into the war.</p>
<p>This seemed more unlikely than ever. With the war settling into
paralysis—on the Western Front both sides were now frantically throwing
up trenchworks—where was the incentive for anyone else to wade into the
morass? “Turkey seems at last to have made up its mind to lie down and
be at peace with all the world,” Lawrence lamented to Winifred Fontana,
the wife of the British consul in Aleppo, on October 19. “I’m sorry,
because I wanted to root them out of Syria, and now their blight will be
more enduring than ever.”</p>
<p>But just two weeks later, his fears were put to rest. On November 2,
with Enver Pasha’s faction having finally won out, Turkey came into the
war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, more good news soon followed. In the wake of Turkey’s
declaration, Stewart Newcombe was recalled from the French theater to
head up a new military intelligence unit in Cairo, the city slated as
headquarters for Britain’s war effort in the Near Eastern theater. It
was to be a very small unit, just a handful of men with extensive
knowledge of the region, and Newcombe immediately tapped both Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley to join it.</p>
<p>“Now it’s Cairo,” Lawrence wrote Winifred Fontana again in early
December, clearly in a much-improved mood. “All goes well except among
the Turks.”</p>
<p>IT WAS A land denuded. Although Aaron Aaronsohn had been prepared for
the onslaught of the requisition squads following the Ottomans’ entry
into the war, their depredations went beyond even his worst imaginings.
Across Syria, crops, farm vehicles, and draft animals were seized and
hauled away in the name of wartime exigency, their hapless owners
indemnified with hastily scribbled receipts that all knew would never be
redeemed. And just as the agronomist had feared, the pillaging appeared
particularly uninhibited in the Jewish colonies. At Zichron Yaakov,
according to biographer Ronald Florence, “Aaron Aaronsohn watched
Turkish soldiers systematically take clothing (including women’s
lingerie and baby clothes), carts, wagons, water buffaloes, agricultural
implements, tools, firearms, medical instruments (including those for
obstetrics), microscopes, and the fence posts and barbed wire needed to
protect the fields.” Eventually, most of Zichron’s irrigation piping
would go as well, leaving its fields and orchards to wilt from lack of
water. Aaronsohn was only able to avoid a similar despoiling of the
agricultural research station at Athlit through the determined
intercession of local Ottoman officials and the posting of armed
guards.</p>
<p>The agronomist might have resigned himself to the idea that these
plunderings were part of the inevitable sacrifices to be made in wartime
if they actually served the war effort; instead, they were gutting Syria
from within, doing the enemy’s work for them. In his travels over the
coming months, he would see great stacks of confiscated wheat rotting in
government storage yards, an uncovered mound of three thousand sacks of
sugar in the city of Nablus left to dissolve in the winter rains, “to
the delight of the street boys.” To repair a bridge in Beersheva,
Aaronsohn later reported, engineers had put in a request for twenty-four
barrels of cement. Instead, the zealous requisition squads had gathered
up four hundred barrels, all of which “were destroyed by rain before
being used, with the result that the bridge remained without
repairs.”</p>
<p>While it could be argued that the Jewish colonies suffered
disproportionately in these seizures simply because they had more and
better matériel to take, the actions of the Constantinople regime
certainly added to their misfortunes. Within days of Turkey joining
Germany and Austria-Hungary in the conflict, the caliph, the supreme
religious authority in the Sunni Muslim world, issued a fatwa that this
was now a holy war, that in protection of the faith it was the sacred
duty of every Muslim to join the jihad against Islam’s foreign,
Christian enemies. Although this call to jihad lost some of its luster
among those who noticed that the Ottomans had just joined an alliance
with two Christian and imperial powers, it did have the intended effect
of inflaming the Muslim masses; in towns and cities across the empire,
young Muslim men took to the streets and military induction centers to
declare their willingness to fight and die for the cause. Of course,
this fatwa had the simultaneous effect of alarming the empire’s
Christian and Jewish populations, compelling the governor of Syria to
issue a hasty explanation that the jihad only applied to its foreign
enemies.</p>
<p>If that clarification mollified many in the Christian community,
which comprised nearly 30 percent of the empire’s inhabitants, its
calming effect was far more limited in the Jewish community. Part of
their continuing fear surely derived from their small numbers—“small”
having an unfortunate tendency to translate as “vulnerable” in
wartime—but it also stemmed from the contentious position the Jewish
colonists occupied in the social fabric of Palestine.</p>
<p>Some of those problems the colonists had brought on themselves. In
Zichron Yaakov, as in most other “first-wave” Jewish settlements, the
émigrés had gradually built their way to prosperity through adopting
Palestine’s long-established fellaheen system, employing landless or
tenant Arab peasants to perform much of the manual labor. By contrast,
many of the socialist-minded Russian émigrés of the second aliyah
denounced this arrangement as exploitive and feudalistic; in pursuit of
creating “the new Jewish man,” they propounded, all work should be done
by Jews themselves. For the unfortunate fellaheen, it wasn’t hard to see
the downside to both these approaches, one perpetuating the plantation
system that had kept their families impoverished and disenfranchised for
generations, the other denying them employment ostensibly for their own
good—or, as Aaron Aaronsohn would caustically put it, “generously
forbidding them to work at all.”</p>
<p>Exacerbating the friction was that in the eyes of many of their
Muslim Arab neighbors, the Jews were a dhimmi, or inferior people. Even
for those Palestinians whose lives were unaffected by the Jewish influx,
perhaps actually improved by it, the image of Jews living better than
themselves—to say nothing of the further level of privilege many enjoyed
courtesy of the Capitulations—added another layer of bitterness.
Beginning with the first aliyah, there had been sporadic attacks on
Jewish colonies by local villagers, and the occasional murder of a
colonist caught out alone on the road.</p>
<p>But the colonists hadn’t accepted this situation passively. In the
early 1900s, several Jewish paramilitary forces, most notably the
Gideonites and Bar Giora, were formed on settlements particularly hard
hit by marauders, and they began contracting their protection services
out to other colonies. It didn’t take a clairvoyant to see where this
would lead; before long, the Gideonites and Bar Giora were conducting
punitive raids against Arab villages they deemed as hostile or
responsible for prior attacks, ensuring new rounds of retaliatory
attacks by the Arabs.</p>
<p>Taken together, then, by the autumn of 1914 the Jewish colonists in
Palestine understandably felt nervous. Between the jihad fatwa and the
requisition seizures and the revoking of the Capitulations, the most
pressing question was just how much the local Ottoman officials—many not
partial to the Jews at the best of times—would come to their aid if
matters turned truly nasty.</p>
<p>In Zichron Yaakov, an answer to this question soon began to form, and
it was not a comforting one. Aaron Aaronsohn’s younger brother Alex had
been caught up in the army’s conscription sweeps of September, and when
he finally managed to finagle a medical release and return home two
months later it was with disturbing news: after the call to jihad, Alex
and all the other Jews and Christians in his conscription unit had been
stripped of their weapons and consigned to labor battalions. Then, in
late November, came a new edict demanding that privately owned firearms
be handed in to the authorities, resulting in another army requisition
squad descending on Zichron Yaakov. When the residents professed to have
no weapons—they had taken the precaution of burying them in a nearby
field—the Turkish commander grabbed up four men, including the luckless
Alex Aaronsohn, and hauled them off to Nablus to be beaten until they
remembered otherwise. It wasn’t until the same commander allegedly
threatened to turn his attentions to the young women of Zichron that the
weapons were finally surrendered, and Alex and the others released.</p>
<p>For many of the Jewish émigrés across Palestine, it was all beginning
to feel like a prelude to the pogroms they thought they had left behind
in Europe, especially when in early December the Young Turk who governed
Palestine, Djemal Pasha, announced that the citizens of “belligerent
nations” must either take Ottoman citizenship or face deportation. This
naturally most directly affected the Russian Jewish minority, and within
days, some eight hundred Russian Jews were rounded up in Jaffa for
expulsion. The docks of that city were soon crowded with other Jews
trying to get out on any ship that would take them, and to any safe
haven that might accept them.</p>
<p>A number of Zichron Yaakov residents joined in this exodus, but the
Aaronsohn family was not among them. Even though the family patriarch,
sixty-six-year-old Ephraim, was still alive, it was really his eldest
son who now decided important matters in the family, and for Aaron
Aaronsohn there was no decision to be made. Palestine was their home.
Moreover, it was the site of all his scientific work, and of the dream
that sustained him. “I am always watched,” he wrote one of his American
benefactors in mid-January, “and well-intentioned friends are strongly
advising me to leave the country as soon as I have the opportunity. But
I have no intention to run away—yet.” Still, Aaronsohn’s faith in the
state had been deeply shaken. “As a staunch supporter of the Turks from
olden days, I feel sorry and ashamed for all I have heard and seen in
these last weeks.”</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of December 15, 1914, a French steamer six days out of
Marseilles approached the low, hazy horizon of northern Egypt. Among
those on board was T. E. Lawrence, come to take up his new position with
the military intelligence unit of the British Egyptian Expeditionary
Force in Cairo. Accompanying him was the man who would be his immediate
supervisor in that post, Captain Stewart Newcombe.</p>
<p>Cairo in 1914 was a city of less than one million, a place of wide
boulevards and beautiful parks, of elegant riverfront promenades along
the Nile. At that time, the Great Pyramids of Giza were some ten miles
beyond the city’s reach, their hard-stone crowns visible from the
rooftop of most any tall building downtown.</p>
<p>But even more than its physical appearance, what made 1914 Cairo such
a beguiling place was its status as one of the world’s greatest
crossroads, its layer upon layer of history going back over a
millennium. The Old City remained a labyrinthine maze of alleyways and
tiny shops, old palaces and mosques tucked into its back streets, and
even if the occupying British had managed to erect a European veneer
here and there in their thirty years of rule, the Egyptian capital
remained a deeply exotic and mysterious place, unknowable in the way of
all truly grand cities.</p>
<p>This was certainly part of what had entranced Lawrence upon his first
visit to Cairo three years earlier. But if the city was physically
little changed from 1911, in other ways 1914 Cairo was virtually
unrecognizable. Since the outbreak of war in Europe, it had become a
transit point for hundreds of thousands of territorial troops from
India, Australia, and New Zealand passing through the Suez Canal on
their way to the Western Front. As happens with RandandandandR stops in
most every war, these soldiers had quickly turned much of Cairo into a
vast red-light district, places where most anything and anyone could be
purchased for the right price.</p>
<p>That situation, scandalous to conservative Cairenes, had only grown
worse in the days since Turkey joined the war. With a Turkish assault on
the Suez Canal now all but certain—indeed, the governor of Syria, Djemal
Pasha, had publicly vowed as much at the end of November—tens of
thousands of British and territorial troops were now being held back in
Egypt to meet the threat. This was rapidly turning Cairo into a military
encampment in its own right, its downtown streets awash with strutting
officers and columns of marching foot soldiers. If the Cairenes had
never been thrilled about the presence of their British imperial
overseers at the best of times—and they hadn’t—they regarded them now
with a seething and growing antipathy.</p>
<p>To provide office space and lodging for the officers tasked to manage
this burgeoning military force, the British quickly took over most of
the city’s finer hotels. One of these was the Savoy, an eclectic blend
of British Victorian and Indian Moghul architectures near the east bank
of the Nile. Upon their arrival, the staff of Stewart Newcombe’s new
military intelligence unit set up shop in three large rooms on an upper
floor of the Savoy, while taking bedrooms at the Grand Continental Hotel
immediately adjacent.</p>
<p>Initially the unit consisted of just five men, and was more likely to
be taken for some kind of Oxbridge peer-review panel than a group
dedicated to the black arts of intelligence and counterespionage. Along
with the two Oxford-educated archaeologists, Lawrence and Woolley, were
two young aristocrats, George Lloyd and Aubrey Herbert, both sitting
members of Parliament. Soon after arriving in Cairo, Lawrence wrote to
his old friend Edward Leeds at the Ashmolean Museum to describe their
various functions: “Woolley looks after personnel, is sweet to callers
in many tongues, and keeps lists of persons useful or objectionable. One
[George] Lloyd, who is an M.P. of sorts and otherwise not bad, looks
after Mesopotamia, and Aubrey Herbert, who is a quaint person, looks
after Turkish politics. Between them in their spare time they locate the
Turkish army, which is a job calling for magnifiers.” As for his own
duties, Lawrence wrote, “I am bottle-washer and office boy
pencil-sharpener and pen wiper.”</p>
<p>In truth, Lawrence was far more than that. Because he had briefly
worked in the Geographical Section of the London War Office, he was put
in charge of the unit’s mapping room. As all braced for the coming Suez
attack, this was an assignment that kept him working from early morning
to late at night.</p>
<p>If he was finally a bit closer to the action, one thing that hadn’t
changed was Lawrence’s gift for irritating his military superiors.
Within weeks of his arrival a number of senior officers began grumbling
about the slight young man in the Savoy mapping room, both his cheeky
manner and unkempt appearance. But Lawrence’s talent for annoying was
not limited to his appearance and speech; he was also a very skilled
writer. As the intelligence unit’s acknowledged “Syria hand,” in early
1915 he set to work on a long report describing the topography, culture,
and ethnic divisions of that broad swath of the Ottoman Empire. Not for
Lawrence the tentative, modifier-laden language that, then as now,
tended to lard such background reports; instead, in “Syria: The Raw
Material” he laid out his opinion of its various cities and peoples in
refreshingly blunt—at times comically arrogant—prose. Typical was his
withering appraisal of Jerusalem: “Jerusalem is a dirty town which all
Semitic religions have made holy.… In it the united forces of the past
are so strong that the city fails to have a present; its people, with
the rarest exceptions, are characterless as hotel servants, living on
the crowd of visitors passing through.”</p>
<p>The remarkable utility of that first sentence—its ability in a mere
twelve words to denigrate one of the world’s most fabled cities, three
major religions, and to offend the Christian sensibilities of every
high-ranking British diplomat or general who might read it—was surely
the source of considerable pride to Lawrence.</p>
<p>WILLIAM YALE INDULGED in portentous language as he described the mood
aboard the refugee-packed freighter that carried him from Beirut to
Alexandria in mid-November 1914. Having just escaped the dreadful
wartime pall that had descended over Ottoman Palestine, he wrote that
“to everyone on board ship, Egypt was a place of refuge where there was
nothing to fear. It never occurred to me then that a different kind of
terror would soon engulf the land of the Pharaohs.”</p>
<p>Rather than pillaging soldiers or religion-crazed vigilantes,
however, the terror to which Yale referred took the form of tens of
thousands of transiting Australian soldiers who, having been released
after weeks spent on board crammed transport ships from their homeland,
were rapidly transforming ancient Cairo into a raucous whiskey-soaked
bordello. Even his experience with the boisterous American roustabouts
in Jerusalem couldn’t prepare Yale, ever the puritanical Yankee at
heart, for the scenes he saw constantly playing out in the city’s
streets: the fights, the pawings of passing women, the soldiers blacked
out in gutters from drink. In his estimation, such outrageous
carryings-on could only tarnish British prestige in the eyes of the
locals, “for the Egyptians, like many others in the Near East, looked
upon the British as a coldly superior race. These hot-blooded, lusty,
undisciplined Australians of 1914 … were a revelation.”</p>
<p>From his perch in Jerusalem, Yale had been eyewitness to the Ottoman
Empire’s long, slow tumble into the war. On November 3, as word of the
Turkish war declaration spread, crowds of Muslim men had begun gathering
in the Old City, their numbers constantly swelled by others pouring in
from the outlying villages. That evening, Yale and other Western
expatriates watched from an upper balcony of the Grand New Hotel as an
unending stream of young men passed through the Old City’s Jaffa Gate on
their way to Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem’s holiest Muslim shrine, beating
their chests and chanting their readiness to die for the faith.</p>
<p>“[It] sent shivers up and down our spines,” he would recall.
“Consciously or unconsciously, we sensed in every fiber of our being,
that these men were stirred with that same religious fervor with which,
some 800 years before on this self-same street, their ancestors had
matched forces with our Crusading forebears.”</p>
<p>It had also helped convince Yale and his supervisor, A. G. Dana, that
it was time to get out. Three days later they were at Jaffa harbor
negotiating their way on board a refugee-laden freighter. By a
circuitous route aboard other overladen ships, they finally reached
Egypt, and the new terror of carousing Australian soldiers, on November
17.</p>
<p>Their arrival was noted by an alert British intelligence officer. On
the Alexandria dock, Yale was escorted to an office to be debriefed on
all he had seen or heard in Palestine in recent days. To his
questioner’s pleasant surprise, it seemed the American oilman had been
very observant during his flight from Syria, and was able to provide
estimates of Turkish troop strengths in a number of towns and cities in
southern Palestine. He also confirmed that German officers were
everywhere in the region and that along with truck convoys of war
matériel and battalions of marching Turkish soldiers, the Germans
appeared to be heading south.</p>
<p>In Cairo, Yale was forced to wait while his bosses back at 26
Broadway decided what to do with him and the other Socony employees
scattered across the Middle East. From the standpoint of Standard’s
Kornub project, the Ottoman entry into the war only made a bad situation
worse. With the British and French navies now imposing a blockade of
their new enemy’s coastline—and in the Ottoman era this meant the entire
eastern Mediterranean shoreline, from Palestine to the southeastern
corner of Europe—there certainly would be no early opportunity to
develop that concession. The fundamental question facing Socony, then,
was whether to retreat from the Middle East for the time being and bring
their people home, or to keep them in place in hopes of some
hard-to-foresee improvement in the near future.</p>
<p>Yale was still waiting for the answer when, one day in late December,
there came a knock on the door of his room at the National Hotel. He
didn’t immediately recognize his visitor—the man was young and in a
British army uniform, two characteristics that described much of Cairo
just then—but there was something in the gaze of his piercing blue eyes
that stirred a memory.</p>
<p>“Hello, Yale,” the visitor said with an amused, lopsided grin. “You
don’t remember me, do you? I’m Lawrence of British Intelligence. We met
at Beersheva last January.”</p>
<p>Yale remembered then, and no doubt also remembered the delight with
which the cocky young archaeologist had set out to demolish his
“playboy” cover story.</p>
<p>As quickly became evident, this meeting, too, was to be an
interrogation of sorts. Even before entering the war, Constantinople had
been moving troops down into Palestine in obvious preparation for an
attack on the Suez Canal, and that pace was now accelerating. Lawrence,
having himself arrived in Egypt just days earlier, had thought to scan
the registry logs of incoming foreigners and had come upon Yale’s name.
He now wanted to learn everything there was to know about the road that
Standard Oil had been building below Hebron: its precise route, its
composition and drainage, whether it could be used by the Turks to bring
heavy weaponry south.</p>
<p>“When he secured all the information I had,” Yale recalled, “he began
talking about the situation in Palestine. I soon discovered that,
although I had just arrived from there, this officer knew far more than
I did. It was then that I began to learn of the efficiency of the
British Intelligence Service and to understand something of the ability
of young Lawrence.”</p>
<p>That evening, Lawrence wrote up his findings for his superiors at
military intelligence. It made for rather unpleasant reading. While the
Hebron-Beersheva road was not finished, Socony had completed work on the
most difficult stretch, the descent through the Judean hills to the edge
of the desert. Perhaps drawing on his engineering experience at the
Panama Canal, William Yale had made sure the road was cut with a gradual
enough gradient to allow for heavy-truck traffic—one so gradual, in
fact, that the roadbed could easily be converted to a railroad. Until
then, British war planners had assumed that any significant
Turkish-German advance toward the Suez from southern Palestine would be
largely confined to the established narrow pathway close to the
Mediterranean shoreline. With their Hebron road, Standard Oil and
William Yale had inadvertently provided the Turks with the capability of
expanding their field of operations by some thirty miles.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of November 21, 1914, less than three weeks after
Turkey entered World War I, Ahmed Djemal Pasha, one of the “Three
Pashas” triumvirate that now ruled the Ottoman Empire, left
Constantinople to take up his new dual positions as commander of the
Fourth Army and governor of Syria. His true authority was far greater
than the titles suggested: supreme military and political ruler of all
Ottoman lands south of Anatolia and west of Iraq, an area that comprised
over half of the empire’s remaining total landmass. As befitting that
authority, his first order of business was to lead the Turkish army to
the Suez Canal and strike at the heart of British Egypt.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, Djemal Pasha would come to thoroughly
dominate life in Syria, his actions credited with causing much of what
was to come. In his dual capacities as a military and political leader,
he would also come into regular contact with—and at varying times employ
the services of—three very different men: Aaron Aaronsohn, Curt Prüfer,
and William Yale.</p>
<p>In some respects, the short, powerfully built Djemal seemed an
unlikely choice for such a position. Born in 1872 to a low-level Ottoman
officer, he had sought a career in the military as a matter of course,
and risen unremarkably through the ranks before throwing his lot in with
the reformist-minded conspirators of the Committee of Union and Progress
in the early 1900s. A fairly obscure figure until the 1913 coup that
enabled the CUP to rule by fiat, Ahmed Djemal was then appointed
military governor of Constantinople. Less than a year later, with the
emergence of the so-called Three Pashas triumvirate, the
forty-two-year-old officer became one of the three public faces of the
shadowy committee that controlled the empire.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one reason for Djemal’s elevation was his personal
magnetism. As Henry Morgenthau, the American ambassador to Turkey, would
recall, “Whenever he shook your hand, gripping you with a vise-like
grasp and looking at you with those roving, penetrating eyes, the man’s
personal force became impressive.” This does not imply that Morgenthau
at all cared for Djemal, instead seeing in his charisma a malevolent
force best rendered in overheated, racialist-tinged prose. “His eyes
were black and piercing, their sharpness, the rapidity and keenness with
which they darted from one object to another, taking in apparently
everything with a few lightning-like glances, signalized cunning,
remorselessness, and selfishness to an extreme degree. Even his laugh,
which disclosed all his white teeth, was unpleasant and
animal-like.”</p>
<p>A more nuanced view was offered by another American who had extensive
dealings with Djemal during the war. Howard Bliss, the president of the
Syrian Protestant College in Beirut, would recall observing the governor
at an afternoon tea party in wartime Beirut, a social event to which
even the expatriate citizens of Turkey’s foes had been invited. Djemal
was “gay, debonair, interested, wandering about with his hands in his
pockets, or lounging on the arm of a big chair, the other arm of which
was occupied by a charming European lady.” Noting the governor’s love of
children and overt displays of affection toward his wife—“unusual among
Orientals”—Bliss saw in Djemal a man caught between an overwhelming
vanity and a core kindness, “a character teeming with conflicting
elements: cruelty and clemency, firmness and caprice, ideality [sic] and
hedonism, self-seeking and patriotism.”</p>
<p>These conflicting personality traits mirrored Djemal’s political
views. Indeed, he seemed to embody the internal contradictions that lay
at the heart of the Young Turk movement, caught as it was between West
and East, modernity and tradition, between awed admiration of the
European powers and bitter resentment. A devout Muslim who embraced the
jihadist credo of pan-Islam, Djemal had also been one of the most vocal
Young Turk leaders in advocating that the empire’s ethnic and religious
minorities be given full civil rights. An aesthete who loved European
music and literature, and who enjoyed nothing more than practicing his
French in the expatriate salons of Constantinople, he also exhorted his
countrymen to purge their nation of corrupting Western influence.
Dreaming of a Turkish and Islamic renaissance that would return the
Ottoman Empire to its ancient splendor, he was at heart a technocrat,
intent on pulling his nation into modernity through the building of
roads and railways and schools.</p>
<p>“He had the ambition of creating a Syria which he could exhibit with
pride to an admiring Europe,” Bliss wrote. “I think it would not be
unfair to call him a personal patriot. He was inordinately vain. He
wanted a reformed Turkey, but he wanted pre-eminently to be known as the
Chief Reformer.”</p>
<p>To try to achieve that, Djemal would rely on the skills he had honed
in his fitful rise through the treacherous political currents of the
CUP, the ability to turn in the blink of an eye from graciousness to
ferocity, an adroitness with both the peace offering and the dagger. As
those who lived in the lands encompassed by his new southern posting
were soon to discover, Djemal Pasha could be wonderfully solicitous in
trying to keep potential enemies on his side, but if flattery and
sinecures and promises didn’t appear to do the trick, he was perfectly
willing to go with the old standbys of exile and execution.</p>
<p>As his train pulled out of Constantinople’s Haidar Pasha station, the
challenges of reforming Syria were soon to be put in stark relief—the
initial hurdle Djemal faced was just getting there. The first part of
that long journey went smoothly enough, a pleasant two-day train ride
through central Anatolia, but the troubles started when they reached the
depot town of Mustafa Bey, at the northern edge of the Gulf of
Alexandretta. There, embarrassed officials informed Djemal that the
onward track to the city of Alexandretta (modern-day Iskenderun) had
recently washed out in a number of places. The pasha switched to an
automobile, but only briefly; after mere yards on the main “highway” to
Alexandretta, the car was mired up to its wheel wells in mud. A
four-hour horseback ride finally brought Djemal to the seaside town of
Dort Yol. There, a tiny two-man tramcar was found that, certain
optimists believed, might be light enough to navigate the damaged
coastal rail line and finally deliver the pasha and his chief of staff
to Alexandretta, ten miles farther along.</p>
<p>“Never shall I forget this journey by trolley on the slippery track,”
Djemal wrote. “More than once we went in danger of our lives as in
pouring rain we passed along the coast, which was watched by enemy
ships.… We reached Alexandretta after a journey during which the trolley
passed over rails which, in some places, hung suspended over a void for
fifteen to twenty metres, and in others were under water.”</p>
<p>But more bad news awaited the pasha. The road onward to Aleppo, the
only link between Alexandretta and the interior of northern Syria, was
now impassable—although “impassable” was perhaps an understatement.
Repairs had been started on the road some time earlier, but had
progressed no further than removing all its crowning stones. Those
stones now lay in high stacks along either side, leaving the road to
form, in Djemal’s words, “a perfect canal.” As he would exclaim in his
memoir, “And here is the only road which keeps my army in touch with the
home country!”</p>
<p>By the time Djemal finally reached his headquarters in Damascus on
December 6, more than two weeks after his departure from Constantinople,
he’d come to a fairly obvious conclusion: the Suez attack should be
postponed until some of the very basic issues of supply lines and
infrastructure were dealt with. He made the mistake, though, of sharing
this thought with the young German intelligence officer who had been
awaiting his arrival in Damascus and had been assigned to serve as
Djemal’s liaison to the German high command: Major Curt Prüfer.</p>
<p>To Prüfer, there could be no question of delaying the Suez offensive.
As he wrote to Max Oppenheim after learning of Djemal’s hesitation,
support for the jihad among the Syrians was tepid to begin with, and in
the event of a postponement, “undoubtedly the carefully manufactured
enthusiasm would disappear and the old indifference, if not hostility,
takes its place.” What’s more, such a delay would provoke “the total
discouragement of the Egyptians, who are cowards anyway.”</p>
<p>It was a rather curious stance for Prüfer to take, since most of his
letter to Oppenheim consisted of reasons why an attack on the canal was
almost sure to fail, his contention that “the means are not sufficient
to the task.” But Prüfer may have had a darker motive in urging it
forward. In Constantinople, he had been eyewitness to the protracted
struggle to bring Turkey into the war, and as he surely knew from
intelligence reports reaching him in Damascus, there were still those in
the CUP leadership maneuvering to back out of the German alliance and
sue for peace with the Entente. An assault on the Suez would end all
that. From that point on, Turkey would be joined at the hip to Germany,
and it would win or die along with it.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Djemal received a terse cable from Constantinople:
the Suez attack was to go forward without delay.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-5-a-despicable-mess">Chapter 5 A Despicable Mess</h4>
<p>So far as Syria is concerned, it is France and not Turkey that is the
enemy.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE TO HIS FAMILY, FEBRUARY 1915</p>
<p>Soon after taking up his post at the Savoy Hotel, Lawrence
commandeered the largest wall in the office and covered it with a
massive sectioned map of the Ottoman world. In his idle moments, he
would stand against the opposite wall and gaze upon it for as long as
time permitted, taking in all its vastness.</p>
<p>By January 1915, he was awaiting the Turkish attack on the Suez Canal
with a certain impatience. One reason was that he had little doubt of
its outcome. To reach the canal, the Turks first had to cross 120 miles
of the inhospitable Sinai Peninsula. From his knowledge of that expanse,
and especially of its limited water sources, Lawrence was convinced the
attacking force would, by necessity, be quite small—surely not the
100,000 soldiers some alarmists in the British military hierarchy were
suggesting—and thus easily repelled.</p>
<p>But the chief reason for his impatience was that he was already
contemplating the next chapter in the Near East war, the one to come
once the Turkish assault had been turned back. It would then be time for
the British to go on the offensive, and gazing upon his maps at the
Savoy, Lawrence was seeking out those places where an invading force
might strike at the Ottoman Empire to most devastating effect.</p>
<p>One truly odd feature of that map had undoubtedly long since occurred
to him: despite its enormous size and tenuous political cohesion, from
the standpoint of geography that empire was astoundingly well
protected.</p>
<p>The political and spiritual core of the Ottoman world was of course
the ancient city of Constantinople, along with the mountainous region of
Anatolia, the ancestral heartland of the Turks, that lay to its east.
This concentration inevitably conjured a tantalizing prospect to British
war planners, the chance to “decapitate” their enemy: if that city and
that region could be seized, there was little doubt that all else would
quickly collapse.</p>
<p>Except that any possible path to doing so presented enormous
obstacles. With both of Turkey’s European neighbors, Greece and
Bulgaria, still neutral in the war, there was little maneuvering room to
try an overland approach on Constantinople from the west. In theory,
Britain’s Russian allies could attempt an eastern advance from their
position at the far end of Anatolia, but already being bled white by the
Germans on the Eastern Front, the Russians were likely to exhaust their
available manpower and matériel before getting very far in the
mountainous terrain. As for a southern approach, that meant either a
ground force trudging up through the Anatolian heartland where local
resistance would be fierce—and, again, the mountains—or a naval flotilla
running the gauntlet of Turkish forts lining the three-mile-wide
Dardanelles strait. There was simply no easy way.</p>
<p>But the alternative, to start at some point on the Ottoman Empire’s
periphery, looked even worse. British Indian forces had seized the
oilfields of southern Iraq in the first days of the war, but an overland
march from there meant a seven-hundred-mile slog through river
swamplands and desert before the Anatolian frontier was even reached.
Likewise, an advance from Egypt meant first crossing the desolate Sinai
Peninsula, then crashing up against Turkish forces massed in the narrow
chokepoint of southern Palestine.</p>
<p>But amid this whole great expanse, there did exist one exquisitely
vulnerable point in the Ottoman Empire’s wall of natural defenses. It
was the Gulf of Alexandretta, at that spot in northwest Syria where the
long north-south coastline of the eastern Mediterranean shore bumps up
against the far more rugged coastline of Anatolia. Not only was
Alexandretta possessed of the best deep natural harbor in the eastern
Mediterranean, a critical asset for amphibious operations, but the
relatively flat landscape just to its east afforded ample room for
ground troops to maneuver for a push farther inland.</p>
<p>But these were military considerations, ones that a number of senior
British officers in Egypt had cottoned to even before Lawrence’s
arrival. What Lawrence uniquely saw, both from his familiarity with the
region—Jerablus lay just one hundred miles east of Alexandretta—and his
firsthand view of Ottoman society, was the political.</p>
<p>One of the great hidden dangers for any empire going to war is that
within its borders are often large communities of people who want
absolutely nothing to do with it. And the longer a war and its
deprivations continue, the more resentful these communities become, and
the more susceptible to the promises and propaganda of one’s enemies.
Most of the dueling empires of Europe were grappling with this internal
danger as their war stretched on, but whatever problems the Europeans
faced in this regard—and in some cases they were considerable—paled to
insignificance next to those facing the Young Turks in Constantinople.
Quite simply, given the extremely polyglot nature of their realm, most
any course of action they might take that would win the support of one
segment of the population was all but guaranteed to alienate another.
This quandary had been illustrated by the mixed results of the call to
jihad in November. While that call had momentarily excited the Muslim
youth, it had terrified the empire’s non-Muslim populations. At the same
time, many conservative Muslim Arabs, already mistrustful of the Young
Turks’ perceived favoritism toward ethnic Turks, viewed it as a cynical
attempt by an increasingly secular regime to play the religion card.</p>
<p>But if the Ottoman Empire was a mosaic, it was also one of distinct
patterns, where various “colors” predominated or diminished across its
expanse. And if one studied this mosaic from a slight remove, there was
one spot on this great expanse where many of these patterns came to a
confluence, creating a kind of ethnic and religious ground zero:
Alexandretta.</p>
<p>Already, for reasons of distance and the relatively scant resources
being allotted to it, Lawrence was convinced that a conventional war
against Turkey wouldn’t work. Instead, the British needed to pursue a
so-called irregular strategy. That meant taking advantage of the
internal fissures of their enemy’s society, forging alliances with its
malcontents. The Alexandretta Basin was the demarcation line between the
Turkish world of Anatolia to the north and the great Arab world to the
south—and as Lawrence well knew from his years at Jerablus, the Arabs of
northern Syria had grown to deeply resent their Turkish overseers.
Alexandretta also stood at the edge of the heartland of the Armenians, a
people who had suffered periodic massacres at the hands of their Turkish
neighbors; surely no people had more reason to rebel against
Constantinople than they. In Lawrence’s view, quite aside from its
purely military advantages, a British landing at Alexandretta was almost
certain to spark uprisings of both Syrians and Armenians against the
Turks, uprisings that would naturally complement the British effort.</p>
<p>But Lawrence also had firsthand information that made the idea even
more enticing. The principal highway linking Anatolia to the south
passed through the Alexandretta Basin, and as Lawrence knew from his
time in the region, that highway was in terrible condition. In addition,
the Hejaz Railway that linked Constantinople to its Arab realms passed
through the basin—or, to put it more accurately, partially linked,
because what Lawrence also knew, courtesy of his journey through the
region six months earlier at the behest of Stewart Newcombe, was that
two crucial spans of that railway in the Taurus and Amanus Mountains
north of Alexandretta were nowhere near completion. This meant that the
Turks would have no way of responding quickly if an invasion force took
control of the basin, and in the slowness of their response, all points
to the south, cut off from resupply or reinforcement, might quickly
fall. With just a comparative handful of soldiers in Alexandretta,
then—Lawrence estimated a mere two or three thousand would be needed—the
British had the potential of not only splitting the Ottoman Empire in
two, but of taking one-third of its population and over half of its land
area out of the war in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Lawrence wasn’t alone in identifying Alexandretta’s extraordinary
vulnerability; the Turks were keenly aware of it too—so keenly, in fact,
that it had already caused them to submit to one of the more humiliating
episodes of World War I.</p>
<p>On December 20, 1914, a lone British warship, HMS Doris, had appeared
off Alexandretta and, in a brazen game of bluff, issued an ultimatum to
the local Turkish commander: release all foreign prisoners in the town,
as well as surrender all ammunition and railway rolling stock, or face
bombardment. In desperation, for they had no guns to resist such an
attack, the Turks had threatened to kill one British prisoner for every
one of their citizens killed in the bombardment. That threat, in blatant
violation of the Geneva and Hague war conventions, had sparked outrage
within the diplomatic community and been quickly countermanded by the
Young Turk leadership in Constantinople. Instead, a bizarre compromise
was reached: in return for the British not shelling the town, the Turks
agreed to destroy the two train engines that were sitting in
Alexandretta station. Except, the embarrassed Turks were soon forced to
admit, they had neither the explosives nor the expertise to uphold their
end of the deal, so on the morning of December 22, a demolitions expert
from the Doris was given safe passage to come ashore and blow the trains
up. Understandably, the British government’s attention to the Doris
affair largely centered on the death-threat aspect, but to Lawrence the
incident laid bare just how panicked the Turks were of what could be
done to them in Alexandretta.</p>
<p>Although a mere second lieutenant relegated to collating maps, by
virtue of his attachment to the military intelligence unit Lawrence was
in the unique position of having his ideas disseminated to the highest
levels of the British war-planning structure. It is surely no
coincidence that while an Alexandretta landing had been discussed
before, the scheme took on new urgency shortly after his arrival in
Cairo. Judging by its telltale idiosyncratic approach to grammar,
Lawrence was almost certainly the author of a crucial January 5, 1915,
military intelligence memorandum on the subject: “We have been informed
from two good sources that the Germans in command in Syria dread nothing
so much as a landing by us in the north of Syria—they say themselves
that this would be followed by a general defection of their Arab troops.
There is no doubt that this fear is well founded, and that a general
Arab revolt, directed by the Pan-Arab military league, would be the
immediate result of our occupation of Alexandretta.”</p>
<p>The lobbying had an effect. On January 15, 1915, just one month after
his arrival in Cairo, Lawrence sent an update to his old mentor in
Oxford, David Hogarth. Because the letter had to clear military censors,
he adopted a deliberately vague tone: “Our particular job goes well. We
all pulled together hard for a month to twist ‘them’ from what we
thought was a wrong line they were taking—and we seem to have succeeded
completely, so that we today have got all we want for the moment, and
therefore feel absolutely bored.”</p>
<p>The “them” he alluded to were senior British war planners in Cairo
and London, while the “job” was an amphibious landing at Alexandretta.
The only holdup now, it seemed to Lawrence, was for the long-awaited
Turkish assault on the Suez Canal to be put safely in the past.</p>
<p>SO GREAT WAS his men’s morale that for a brief time even Djemal Pasha
was stirred by the thought that it just might work out after all.
“Everyone was absolutely convinced that certainly the Canal would be
crossed,” he recalled, “that we should dig ourselves in securely on the
further bank, and that the Egyptian patriots would then rise and attack
the English in the rear.”</p>
<p>One source of this soaring optimism within the ranks of the Ottoman
Fourth Army at the end of January 1915 was the extraordinary fortitude
they had shown in crossing the Sinai, a shining example of what was
possible when Turkish doggedness was joined to German organization.
Making that 120-mile crossing had been months in the planning and
involved almost superhuman logistical arrangements. Overseen by German
officers, engineering units had fanned out across the desert beforehand,
tapping wells for the oncoming troops, building rainwater reservoirs,
and laying in depots of ammunition. Great teams of oxen had hauled the
disassembled pontoon bridges needed to ford the Suez Canal, as well as
the army’s heavy artillery, while some twelve thousand camels had been
gathered up from as far away as central Arabia to ferry supplies. In
early January, the army of thirteen thousand men set out along three
different paths through the desert, and despite the deprivations of that
march—each man’s daily food ration consisted of just a half pound of
biscuits and a handful of olives—by the end of the month the attack
force was encamped just a few miles east of the canal, ready to strike.
Certainly the British in Egypt knew an attack was imminent—their spotter
planes had photographed and occasionally shot at some of the Turkish
formations—but they seemed to have no idea how large the force might be
or where along the hundred-mile length of the canal it would come. It
was this that had put Djemal’s troops in such good spirits.</p>
<p>“I used to talk to the troops every night about the victory in
store,” he wrote, “and what a glorious victory it would be. I wanted to
keep the sacred flame alive in the whole force.… If, by some
unanticipated stroke of good fortune, this enterprise … had brought us
success, we should naturally have regarded it as a good omen for the
final liberation of Islam and the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
<p>One man who little shared in these high hopes was Major Curt Prüfer.
Along with a small contingent of other German junior officers, he had
endured the hard rigors of that desert crossing, and attributed all its
success to the meticulous planning of the chief German military advisor
to Djemal, a lieutenant colonel with the colorful name of Friedrich
Kress von Kressenstein. Still, planning had its limits, and even if
Prüfer wasn’t a professional soldier—just like T. E. Lawrence, he had
received his officer’s commission with no actual military training—he
appreciated that the changed face of modern war almost surely meant
problems for the coming offensive. In particular, in the age of aerial
reconnaissance, then just in its infancy, the British undoubtedly had a
far better idea of their enemy’s strength and intentions than the Turks
imagined.</p>
<p>This was confirmed to Prüfer by his own reconnaissance missions to
the canal. The plan of attack called for the Turkish army’s flanks to
make diversionary feints at the north and south ends of the waterway,
while the main force of some sixty-five hundred men stormed across near
its midpoint, just above the Great Bitter Lake. When Prüfer joined a
forward scouting party that crept close to the canal on the morning of
January 25, he observed just two British dredgers and a handful of small
lighter boats in the lake. Three days later, however, the British
presence had grown to several transport ships and two cruisers, a number
that expanded to some twenty ships by January 30. In the meantime,
Prüfer had experienced a close call when a British warplane dropped two
bombs on the main headquarters encampment.</p>
<p>“I confess that the hammering of the bombs, the powerful explosions
and the black billowing smoke, frightened me,” he noted in his diary,
“although I did my best to hide it. In the camp, everyone ran
pell-mell.”</p>
<p>To Prüfer, it all pointed to a coming disaster. “The enemy cruisers
in the lake control the situation,” he wrote upon returning from the
January 30 scouting mission. “We will be destroyed before we have
actually come into the vicinity of the channel.” That night, he ate his
“hangman’s meal,” asparagus and French toast.</p>
<p>The assault finally came in the early-morning hours of February 3,
1915. Taking advantage of a brief sandstorm that screened their actions
from view, Turkish engineers hastily assembled their ten pontoon bridges
at the water’s edge as the foot soldiers massed behind, ready to charge
across. At a crucial moment, however, a British searchlight picked up
the activity; in a barrage of rifle and artillery fire, seven of the
pontoon bridges were quickly destroyed. That may have been a blessing in
disguise for the Fourth Army, for it limited the slaughter. As it was,
the approximately six hundred Turkish soldiers who had managed to reach
the far shore before their escape routes were cut off were all either
soon killed or compelled to surrender.</p>
<p>Prüfer had been given the quixotic task of leading forward a long
wagon train hauling sandbags; the plan called for the sandbags to be
used both to block the canal and to create a bridge to the far shore.
Instead, he spent most of the day scrambling from one point of chaos on
the front lines to the next as British naval shells exploded all
around.</p>
<p>By nightfall, Djemal and his senior German advisors concluded that
the situation was hopeless, and a general retreat back across the Sinai
desert began. To most everyone’s surprise, the British made no attempt
to pursue the fleeing army, enabling its withdrawal to be as orderly and
disciplined as had been its advance.</p>
<p>Despite his own bleak assessment on the eve of battle, the setback on
the canal seemed to cast Curt Prüfer into despondency. Nursing a slight
arm wound—he’d apparently been hit by shrapnel during the assault—he
holed up in Hafir el Andscha, an oasis town at the eastern edge of the
Sinai, to file dispatches to Max von Oppenheim and Hans von Wangenheim,
the German ambassador to Turkey. He was blunt, even derisive, over the
campaign’s failure to trigger an Egyptian uprising.</p>
<p>“Despite all our agitation,” he wrote Oppenheim, “despite the
thousands of [jihadist] pamphlets, we did not have any deserters.… The
Egyptians are even cowardly in desperation, and lack any genuine love of
fatherland.”</p>
<p>But his disappointment clearly had deeper roots. Ever since teaming
up with Max von Oppenheim, the former Oriental scholar had fervently
embraced the notion of a pan-Islamic jihad against Germany’s imperial
enemies. Not just the battle but the entire Sinai campaign gave the lie
to that. From the very outset, tensions were evident between the Turkish
and Arab components of the assault force, and these had only worsened
with time. Many of the Arab units fled as soon as the shooting began, or
never deployed in the first place, while some went over to the enemy.
Prüfer heaped particular scorn on the Bedouin nomad warriors, many of
whom he had personally recruited to act as scouts and who similarly
melted away on the decisive day. Indeed, just about the only unifying
element detectable among this fractious lot was antipathy for their
German advisors; even many Turkish officers had adopted a policy of
“passive resistance” to any direction offered by the Germans throughout
the campaign.</p>
<p>“The holy war,” Prüfer informed his old mentor from Hafir el Andscha,
“is a tragicomedy.”</p>
<p>Djemal Pasha had a rather more upbeat assessment. While the assault
obviously hadn’t led to the Egyptian uprising he had hoped for, the
action would cause the British to keep more troops in reserve in Egypt,
making fewer available to fight elsewhere. Moreover, by his calling off
the engagement when he did, his army was still largely intact. At the
same time, as they made their respective ways back across the Sinai,
Djemal and Prüfer undoubtedly shared a mounting sense of unease. Given
the tit-for-tat nature of the war, a British retaliatory offensive would
come soon. The only question was where, and from their own recent
difficult journeys across Syria, both knew the likeliest spot: the
Alexandretta Basin.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the broken railways and “canal” roads of that
chokepoint that were cause for worry. In the nationwide scramble for
reliable frontline troops, the Turks had been forced to leave the
safeguarding of the Alexandretta region to two second-rate divisions
composed almost exclusively of Syrian Arabs. Resentful of their Turkish
overseers at the best of times—and these weren’t the best of times in
the Ottoman world—it was highly probable that these Arab units would
quickly collapse at the first sign of an Allied landing, perhaps even
switch sides.</p>
<p>In fact, Djemal Pasha’s anxiety over Alexandretta had already led him
to commit a singularly reckless act. Desperate to mask the city’s abject
vulnerability, it was he who had issued the threat to execute British
prisoners back in December when HMS Doris stood offshore. Now, in the
wake of Suez, the Syrian governor was sure the British would turn to
Turkey’s Achilles’ heel once more, and this time there would be no
negotiating, no way to stop them.</p>
<p>THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THERE have been occasions when a vastly superior
military force has managed, against all odds, to snatch defeat from all
but certain victory. The phenomenon usually has root in one of three
causes: arrogance, such a blinding belief in one’s own military or
cultural superiority as to fail to take the enemy seriously; political
interference; or tunnel vision, that curious tendency among war planners
and generals to believe a flawed approach might be rectified simply by
pouring more men and firepower into the fray. In early 1915, the British
military would navigate its way to a fiasco of such colossal proportions
as to require all three of these factors to work in concert.</p>
<p>With the brushing back of the Turkish assault on the Suez on February
3, Lawrence and other members of the intelligence unit in Cairo assumed
that plans for a landing at Alexandretta would immediately get under
way. Instead, the war strategists in London had already begun focusing
on a different spot on the Ottoman coastline: the Dardanelles strait
below Constantinople.</p>
<p>One of the earth’s more peculiar natural formations, the Dardanelles
is a narrow, fjordlike waterway flanked by the Turkish Asian mainland on
its eastern bank and the mountainous Gallipoli peninsula on its western.
After a twisting thirty-mile-long course between the mountains, the
gorge opens up at its northern confluence to the inland Sea of Marmara,
at the far end of which lies Constantinople, or modern-day Istanbul. For
obvious reasons, the southern entrance to the Dardanelles, letting onto
the Mediterranean, has always been regarded as the maritime gateway to
that city, and since ancient times every civilization that has
controlled the region has maintained fortifications there. The Ottoman
forts that dotted the high slopes above the strait in early 1915 had
been erected on the ruins of Byzantine forts, which in turn had been
built on the ruins of Greek and Roman ones.</p>
<p>“Forcing the Narrows” had been an alluring notion for British war
planners ever since Turkey came into the war, and for none more so than
the first lord of the admiralty, Winston Churchill. As he repeatedly
pointed out to the British cabinet—often to the point of tiresomeness,
as was his style—with a defenseless Constantinople lying just to the
north of that strait, here lay the chance to swiftly decapitate their
Turkish adversaries and take them out of the war. Further arguing for a
Dardanelles breakthrough was an appeal for aid from Russia, hard pressed
by German and Austro-Hungarian forces in the north. With Russia’s
northern ports either iced in or patrolled by marauding German U-boats,
the only possible maritime route for such aid, Churchill argued, was
from the south.</p>
<p>As consensus for a Dardanelles naval operation grew in London, those
in Cairo advocating an Alexandretta landing found themselves
increasingly outmaneuvered; with the Royal Navy focused on the former,
they were told, it would be spread too thin to support an operation in
the latter. On its face, this contention was absurd. Even the most
pessimistic War Office assessment had concluded that Alexandretta could
be seized by about 20,000 troops—far more than the two to three thousand
envisioned by Lawrence, but still a pittance compared with the numbers
idly staring across no-man’s-land on the Western Front. The real issue
was institutional myopia. Since the Dardanelles had now become the first
priority in the Near East, any action at Alexandretta fell under the
classification of a diversion, and among senior British war planners,
with their nineteenth-century notions of massing all available force at
a single point, diversion was shorthand for distraction.</p>
<p>Joined to this was stone-cold arrogance. Turkey was a third-rate
power, its soldiers ill-fed, ill-trained, poorly armed, and mutinous. In
just the past five years, they had been beaten by the Italians, the
Bulgarians, the Greeks, the Serbs, and the Montenegrins. Most recently,
they had been swatted away from the Suez Canal and slaughtered by the
Russians at the battle of Sarikamish in eastern Turkey. “Taking the
Turkish Army as a whole,” one British officer had reported to his
superiors in November 1914, “I should say it was [a] militia only
moderately trained, and composed as a rule of tough but slow-witted
peasants as liable to panic before the unexpected as most uneducated
men.” Just what chance did this rabble have against the might of the
British Empire? Ergo, why nip at their heels at Alexandretta when they
could be beheaded at Constantinople?</p>
<p>But there was an altogether different issue at play as well, one that
had nothing to do with military strategies or hubris and everything to
do with politics. Since the start of the war, the French had laid claim
to Syria, a spoils-of-war prize that it would take possession of once
the conflict ended. Even though the Alexandretta enclave fell just
outside the generally recognized borders of greater Syria, all the
British talk of the Syrian uprising that was sure to follow an
Alexandretta landing—talk, ironically enough, that Lawrence himself had
done much to generate in his reports to London—made the French extremely
edgy. Put simply, if there was to be an Allied move into the Syrian
region, the French wanted to be in on it from the outset in order to
take control of the situation. That was understandable as far as the
argument went, perhaps, but then came the kicker: since France, hard
pressed on the Western Front, had no troops to spare for such an
enterprise, it meant that the entire region, including Alexandretta,
should be militarily off-limits even to its allies.</p>
<p>Whether justified or not, in Lawrence’s mind it was this French
objection, far more than British War Office shortsightedness, that
scuttled the Alexandretta plan. In mid-February, as word of the French
position circulated among the stunned Savoy Hotel intelligence staff, he
wrote a short letter to his parents in which he bitterly noted, “So far
as Syria is concerned, it is France and not Turkey that is the
enemy.”</p>
<p>Initially, however, it appeared that Lawrence’s indignation might be
misplaced, and the Dardanelles gambit a success. On February 19, a joint
British and French flotilla appeared off the southern entrance to the
strait and with their long-range guns proceeded to shell the Turkish
fortresses there at will. With the Turks able to muster only token
return fire, most of their outer forts were soon pounded to rubble,
leading the British fleet commander to confidently predict that by
methodically working its way up the strait and destroying whatever
Turkish fortifications remained, his armada might reach Constantinople
within two weeks’ time. That city’s residents clearly agreed with him.
As the Allied fleet sailed off to resupply for the big push,
Constantinople’s imminent fall seemed such a foregone conclusion that
the nation’s gold reserves were rushed to a safe haven in the Turkish
interior, and many senior government officials quietly hatched personal
contingency plans to flee.</p>
<p>One who didn’t share this view was T. E. Lawrence. To the contrary,
holding out hope that until the Dardanelles operation got under way in
earnest there might still be a chance to overrule the French, he used
the lull after the February 19 bombardments to continue pushing for an
Alexandretta landing, but to little avail. With the senior British
military command now deaf to his arguments, he finally reached out to
the one person he knew who was well connected to the British political
hierarchy, David Hogarth.</p>
<p>Although Lawrence had always assumed an informal, collegial tone with
his mentor, his letter to Hogarth on March 18 was of a very different
order: beseeching, even demanding. After outlining the crucial
importance of taking Alexandretta—“the key of the whole place, as you
know”—and warning of the danger should it fall into the hands of any
other power, he all but gave Hogarth a set of marching orders to combat
the various forces lined up against the plan: “Can you get someone to
suggest to Winston [Churchill] that there is a petrol spring on the
beach (very favourably advised on by many engineers, but concessions
always refused by the Turks), huge iron deposits near Durt Yol 10 miles
to the north and coal also.… Then go to the F.O. [Foreign Office] if
possible. Point out that in [the] Baghdad Convention, France gave up
Alexandretta to [the] Germans, and agreed that it formed no part of
Syria. Swear that it doesn’t form part of Syria—and you know it speaks
Turkish.… By occupying Alexandretta with 10,000 men we are
impregnable.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Hogarth actually had the clout to execute such
instructions, it was already too late. On the very day Lawrence sent his
letter, March 18, the Allied fleet returned to the mouth of the
Dardanelles to resume their bombardment campaign. This time, matters
didn’t go at all as planned.</p>
<p>For the first three hours, the Allied armada pounded away at the
coastal forts with much the same ease as in February. The trouble
started when the first line of ships was commanded to fall back to make
room for the second. During the February bombardment, the Turks had
taken note of an odd habit of the Allied fleet, that when reversing
course they almost invariably turned their ships to starboard; on the
chance that this tradition would continue, they had recently laid a
single string of mines in an inlet the Allies would traverse on a
starboard turn. Sure enough, at about 2 p.m. the retiring Allied first
line steered directly into the minefield. In quick succession, three
warships were sunk, and three more heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Although the term “mission creep,” with all its negative
connotations, didn’t exist in 1915, it probably should have. In
analyzing the March 18 minefield fiasco, British war planners came to
the reasonable conclusion that the Dardanelles couldn’t be cleared by
sea power alone. What they failed to conclude was that the campaign
should be abandoned in favor of something different. To the contrary,
the Allies were now going to double down, with the naval effort at the
strait to be augmented by a ground offensive.</p>
<p>It would be some time before anyone realized it, but that decision
was to be one of the most fateful of World War I, ultimately
extinguishing any hope that the conflict in the Middle East—and by
extension, that in Europe—might be brought to an early end. In the
interim, the regime in Constantinople, which just days earlier had been
flirting with abandoning the capital, was given a new lease on life as
the Allies again paused operations in order to cobble their ground force
together.</p>
<p>IN THE MIDWINTER of 1915, the Standard Oil Company of New York
finally decided what to do with William Yale. Releasing him from Cairo,
that modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah so assaultive to his Yankee
sensibilities, he was ordered to return to Constantinople.</p>
<p>With greater cunning than perhaps any other international
corporation, Socony had looked upon the unfolding tragedy of World War I
and been determined to play it to their advantage. In fact, in the very
first days of the war it had come up with a plan whereby it might supply
the petroleum needs of both warring European blocs by reflagging its
tankers to the registry of neutral nations. While that scheme had been
exposed, Yale discovered that Socony had now devised an ingenious new
system to smuggle oil to Turkey through neutral Bulgaria. But this was
minor compared with what Standard was planning next, and it was to
achieve that greater plan that Yale had been brought back to Turkey.</p>
<p>What the bosses at 26 Broadway had come to realize was that so long
as the Europe-wide war continued—and, just as crucially, so long as the
United States kept out of it—they had the vast territories of the
Ottoman Empire practically to themselves. With their British, French,
and Russian competitors boxed out until the war ended, they now had a
golden opportunity to grab up as many oil concessions in the Near East
as they desired—and since they were the only major company still in
operation in the region, they could do so at rock-bottom prices. The
scheme traded on Turkey’s desperate need for oil, a vital commodity if
it was to have any hope of competing militarily. The oil coming through
Socony’s Bulgarian smuggling operation was a pittance compared with what
was needed, and to meet this need Standard held out a possible solution:
Palestine.</p>
<p>In various geological studies going back to the late 1800s, data
suggested that central Palestine might well be the site of one of the
world’s great untapped oil reservoirs. The mapping team that William
Yale had been a part of in 1913–14 had examined only a tiny portion of
that area, some forty-five thousand acres, limited as it was by the
boundaries of the concessionary zones. Standard wanted to massively
increase its Palestine holdings, and it now saw a way to make that
happen.</p>
<p>Just prior to Yale’s return, Socony officials in Constantinople had
told the Ottoman government that after careful consideration, they had
regretfully concluded that the area covered by their seven concessions
in Kornub was simply too small to be financially viable to exploit. If
such a conclusion seemed odd coming so soon after Socony had embarked on
a massive effort to develop those concessions, a naturally more pressing
question for an oil-starved regime in the midst of a war was, just how
many more acres did Standard feel they needed? The answer: a half
million more, or, put in more tangible terms, pretty much the entire
breadth of central Judea from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean, an area
covering about one-tenth of the current state of Israel.</p>
<p>Except there was a key detail in all this that Socony saw no reason
to trouble the Turks with. It had no intention of actually drilling for
oil, let alone refining it, until after the war was over. Its sole goal
was to use the “golden hour” that the war afforded to lock up those
500,000 acres for the future, a future that, provided the right pressure
was brought to bear on the right diplomats and politicians, wouldn’t
depend in any way on which side eventually won.</p>
<p>As the Socony employee with the most experience in Palestine, William
Yale was to be the point man for getting control of that land. The first
job at hand, though, was to change Turkey’s mining laws; these were
archaic and complex and an impediment to the kind of land grab Standard
was hoping to achieve. To this end, the Constantinople Socony office set
to work compiling a comprehensive set of new mining-law recommendations
for the Turkish parliament—an undertaking eased by their having put the
secretary of the Turkish senate on their payroll—and also placed Yale on
the drafting committee. In just this way, the twenty-seven-year-old
Yale, less than eighteen months removed from his roustabout duties in an
Oklahoma oilfield, became instrumental in rewriting the commercial laws
of a foreign empire.</p>
<p>THE GERMAN HOSPICE is a magnificent building of yellow stone and
slate that sits on the ridgeline of the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem.
Today its austere lines are softened by the cypress and pine trees that
surround it, but when it was constructed in the early 1900s, under the
orders and specifications of Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, its bare
grounds and prominent position on the ridge gave it more than a passing
resemblance to a Bavarian castle.</p>
<p>Built to accommodate German pilgrims and clergy visiting the Holy
Land, the hospice has the feel of a particularly pleasant medieval
monastery, rough-stone stairways connecting its different floors, open
internal passageways giving onto views of its cloistered gardens. On the
ground floor is a great chapel made of stone, its fusion of stained
glass windows and Moorish-style archways reminiscent of the Great
Cathedral in Córdoba. So grand is the hospice that Djemal Pasha chose to
make it his Jerusalem headquarters during World War I, the city where he
and his German liaison officer, Curt Prüfer, returned after their
ill-fated Suez sojourn in February 1915.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, the governor quickly became known for exhibiting a
degree of irritability in the administration of his office. His new
personal secretary, a twenty-one-year-old reserve officer named Falih
Rifki, caught a glimpse of this on the first day he showed up for work
at the hospice in the winter of 1915. Ushered into Djemal’s inner
sanctum, Rifki watched as the governor briskly signed his way through a
high stack of papers placed before him and then taken away by three
attending officers, oblivious to the twenty or so other men who stood in
one corner of the room, pale and trembling with fear. When Djemal at
last finished with his paperwork and turned to the clustered men, elders
from the Palestinian town of Nablus, it was to ask if they understood
the gravity of their unspecified crimes. The Nablus elders, apparently
not appreciating that the question was meant to be rhetorical, began to
protest their innocence and plead for mercy.</p>
<p>“Silence!” Djemal thundered. “Do you know what the punishment is for
these crimes? Execution! Execution!” He let that news sink in for a bit,
before continuing in a calmer tone, “But you may thank God for the
sublime mercy of the Ottoman state. For the moment I shall content
myself with exiling you and your families to Anatolia.”</p>
<p>After the men had offered their profuse thanks and been hustled out,
Djemal turned to Rifki with a shrug. “What can one do? That’s how we get
things done here.”</p>
<p>The episode rather exemplified Djemal Pasha’s managerial style, a man
for whom the term “mercurial” might have been coined. Forever
oscillating between raging severity and gentle magnanimity, often within
the same conversation, he kept everyone around him permanently off
balance, incapable of predicting his likely response to a situation.
Howard Bliss, the president of the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut,
recalled a meeting between Djemal and a favor-seeking Briton at which
the governor bluntly refused every request made of him, until a sealed
envelope was opportunely delivered by an aide. Reading the contents,
Djemal broke into a broad smile.</p>
<p>“I now can grant all your requests,” he announced. “I have just
received a decoration from the Czar of Bulgaria, and at such times I
always grant the first favors presented.”</p>
<p>One effect of this style, of course, was that issues were never truly
resolved; knowing that most any harsh edict might be countermanded or,
conversely, a granted favor soon rescinded, petitioners learned to
beseech Djemal for consideration when he was reported to be in a good
mood—or, trusting in the law of averages, to simply beseech him
repeatedly.</p>
<p>In his defense, though, it’s not as if the Syrian governor didn’t
have a lot of things to be irritable about. Indeed, by the middle of
March 1915 he was buffeted by such an array of crises as might cause the
most cheerful person to feel a bit put-upon. Under the circumstances,
the first of these crises, manifested on the morning of March 22,
bordered on the perverse: locusts.</p>
<p>The Spanish consul in Jerusalem, a dapper young man named Antonio de
la Cierva, Conde de Ballobar, happened to be working in his office that
morning when he noticed the sky suddenly darken dramatically, as if
there were occurring a solar eclipse. “Upon peeking out from the balcony
I saw that an immense cloud had completely obscured the light of the
sun.” As Ballobar watched, the cloud descended, revealed itself to be
millions upon millions of locusts. “The ground, the balconies, the
roofs, the entire city and then the countryside, everything was covered
by these wretched little animals.”</p>
<p>Just as quickly as it had appeared, the horde moved on, headed east
toward Jericho, but in subsequent days, reports of the locust plague
started coming in from across the breadth of central Palestine. They
told of entire orchards and fields stripped bare of every leaf and
seedling within hours, of farm animals and briefly unattended infants
being blinded, the insects feeding on the liquid in their eyes.</p>
<p>The Holy Land had experienced locust plagues in the past, but nothing
in modern memory compared to this. Nor could it have come at a worse
moment. Joined to the pressures of the war effort—tens of thousands of
Syrian farmers had been drafted, the requisitioning of farm animals and
machinery had been wanton—the pestilence was sure to make an already
troubled spring planting season infinitely worse, and cause massive food
shortages and price increases. Indeed, Consul Ballobar noted, within
hours of the locust swarm touching down in Jerusalem, wheat prices in
the city’s bazaars had spiked.</p>
<p>True to his self-image as a reformer, Djemal Pasha didn’t form a
committee or appoint some toady to deal with the problem, the typical
Ottoman response to a crisis. Instead, he immediately summoned Syria’s
most celebrated agricultural scientist, the thirty-nine-year-old Jewish
émigré Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>The meeting between the two fiercely headstrong men took place on
March 27 and, per Djemal’s preference, was conducted in French. It got
off to a rocky start. Along with outlining the modern techniques that
could be used to combat the infestation, Aaronsohn took the opportunity
to bluntly criticize the army’s wholesale requisitions that had left the
region on the brink of ruin even before the locusts appeared. According
to the story Aaronsohn would later tell, the governor finally
interrupted his tirade with a simple question: “What if I were to have
you hanged?”</p>
<p>In a clever retort, alluding to both his considerable girth and to
his network of influential friends abroad, the agronomist replied, “Your
Excellency, the weight of my body would break the gallows with a noise
loud enough to be heard in America.”</p>
<p>Djemal apparently liked that answer. Before the ending of their
meeting, he had appointed Aaronsohn inspector in chief of a new locust
eradication program, and granted him near-dictatorial powers to carry it
out. If any petty officials got in Aaronsohn’s way, the governor let it
be known, they would have to answer to him.</p>
<p>But if the locust plague could be delegated to an expert, that was
not the case with Djemal’s other concerns that March.</p>
<p>For some time he had been sitting on information that suggested the
empire’s “Arab problem” might be far more serious than anyone in
Constantinople appreciated, that in Syria they might be sitting on
something of a volcano.</p>
<p>Shortly after Turkey joined the war in November, a unit of Turkish
counterintelligence officers had broken into the shuttered French
consulate in Beirut, and there they had found a passel of documents in a
concealed wall safe. Those papers laid bare a long-standing secret
relationship between the French consul and a number of Arab leaders in
Beirut and Damascus opposed to the Young Turk government. Not just
opposed; many of the proposals these men had put to the French
consul—for Syrian independence, for a French protectorate in
Lebanon—were nothing short of traitorous.</p>
<p>But administering a corrective to the querulous Nablus elders had
been one thing; moving against the Beirut and Damascus consulate
plotters was a good deal trickier. Many were well known throughout the
Arab world, and their execution or exile might provoke the very Arab
rebellion Turkey sought to avoid. It might also raise alarm in the
greater Arab Muslim world, including in the “captive” lands of Egypt and
French North Africa, just when Constantinople was trying to stir these
communities to the cause of pan-Islamic jihad. Consequently, Djemal had
seen no choice but to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Tucking the Beirut
dossier away in his Damascus office, he had endeavored to keep the
malcontents close by feigning normalcy and reverting to the old Ottoman
standby of handing out sinecures and honorary positions. That tactic
might ultimately win the plotters to his side, or conversely reveal how
extensive their conspiratorial circles actually were, but it was still
worrisome to have these traitors at large at the very moment that an
Allied invasion of Syria had suddenly grown more likely.</p>
<p>But in Syria, every problem had its counterproblem. Whereas the
Beirut dissidents consisted almost exclusively of so-called
progressives, Arab urban liberals infused with European ideas of
nationalism and self-determination, in late March Djemal also faced a
crisis with Arab conservatives, those spurred to outrage by the Young
Turks’ modernist—and, to their eyes, secularist—reforms. This
conservative crisis was about to quite literally show up at the
governor’s door in the form of a soft-spoken thirty-one-year-old man
named Sheikh Faisal ibn Hussein.</p>
<p>Faisal was the third of four sons of Emir Hussein, a tribal leader in
the immense Hejaz region of western Arabia. Of much greater import,
Faisal’s father was the sherif, or religious leader, of the Muslim holy
cities of Mecca and Medina, the most recent scion of the Hashemite clan
that had served as the guardians of the Islamic holy land since the
tenth century.</p>
<p>Relations between the Young Turks and Emir Hussein had been strained
from the very outset, and time had done nothing to improve matters.
Almost medieval in his conservatism, over the years Hussein had viewed
the stream of liberalist edicts emanating from Constantinople with
ever-deepening antipathy; his discontent ranged from the Young Turks’
emancipation of women and promotion of minority rights, to its chipping
away at the civic authority of religious leaders, even to its efforts to
curb slavery, still a common practice in the Hejaz. Tellingly, the most
tangible focus of Emir Hussein’s rancor was the proposed extension of
the Hejaz Railway from Medina to Mecca. Far from viewing the extension
as a sign of progress, a way to ease the travel of Muslim pilgrims
making the hajj to the holy city, Hussein saw it as a Trojan horse for
Constantinople to exert greater control over the region, and
specifically over him. The result had been an endless series of clashes
between the Constantinople-appointed Hejaz civilian governors and the
emir and his sons.</p>
<p>The tensions had only grown worse—and the consequences obviously far
graver—since Turkey came into the war. Given that he was one of the most
respected religious figures in the Muslim world, Hussein’s noncommittal
response to the call to jihad in November was quickly noted by all, and
was viewed as a major reason for its tepid effect thus far. Similarly,
appeals for national unity in the war effort had done nothing to bring
about a rapprochement in the long-standing feud between Ali, Hussein’s
eldest son, and the current governor of Medina, a feud that at times had
come close to open combat. Then there had been the emir’s feeble
response to Djemal’s request for volunteers to join in the Suez assault.
Instead of the thousands of tribal fighters the regime had counted on,
Abdullah, Hussein’s second son, had shown up in Syria with a mere
handful.</p>
<p>Yet despite all this provocation, Hussein and his sons had to be
handled with even greater delicacy than the Beirut malcontents. If from
a narrow military standpoint the Hejaz lacked the strategic importance
of Syria—it consisted of a few small cities surrounded by vast deserts
at the farthest fringe of the empire—the Hashemite emir’s singular
ability to bestow or deny his religious blessing on Constantinople’s
actions gave him extraordinary power. Thus a kind of standoff ensued.
Obviously, the Young Turks either wanted Hussein to fall in line or to
be rid of him, but to move against him in too crude a fashion was to
invite a ferocious conservative backlash. For his part, Hussein had to
know that there was a limit to the Young Turks’ patience, that pushing
them too far was to invite in the soldiers.</p>
<p>That standoff had recently experienced a perilous rupture. In
January, Hussein’s eldest son, Ali, claimed to have uncovered a plot by
the governor of Medina to overthrow Hussein and replace him with a more
pliant religious figure. This was the reason for Faisal’s impending
arrival in Syria. Emir Hussein was sending him out of the deserts of
Arabia to confront the Constantinople regime, both to express his
outrage at the overthrow plot and to demand that the provincial governor
be removed.</p>
<p>But here, at last, was something approximating good news for Djemal
Pasha, for if there was anyone within the troublesome Hussein family who
he felt might be the voice of reason, it was Faisal. Like his older
brothers, Faisal had been raised and educated within the sultan’s inner
court in Constantinople, but it appeared this civilizing influence had
taken special hold in Hussein’s unassuming third son. In Faisal there
was a caution, even a timidity, that might be exploited with gentle
words and charm—and though the unlucky Nablus elders hauled into his
office might have gone away with a differing opinion, charm was
something of a Djemal specialty. When Faisal and his retinue rolled into
town, the governor intended to greet him with all the pomp and fanfare
of a visiting dignitary.</p>
<p>LESS THAN A mile away from the German Hospice, at the German military
headquarters in downtown Jerusalem, Curt Prüfer also took a keen
interest in the imminent arrival of Faisal ibn Hussein. He had a rather
harder-edged view, however, of how to win the Hussein family to the
Turco-German cause. Back in October 1914, even before Djemal Pasha’s
arrival in Syria, Prüfer had dispatched his own spies to the Hejaz to
get a sense of where Emir Hussein’s true loyalties lay. His conclusion,
as he’d reported to Max von Oppenheim in early November, was that the
emir in Mecca was essentially on the payroll of British Egypt and thus
“English through and through.”</p>
<p>Beyond his obvious political and religious differences with the Young
Turks, the problem with Hussein extended to geography. One of the most
isolated and impoverished regions of the Ottoman Empire, the Hejaz had
an economy that was almost wholly dependent on the annual hajj, or
pilgrimage, by the Muslim faithful to Mecca, the bulk of whom came from
either India or Egypt. The arid Hejaz also relied on imported grain to
feed its people, and much of that came across the Red Sea from Egypt or
British Sudan in the form of government-subsidized religious offerings.
With the British navy’s undisputed control of the Red Sea, it would be a
simple matter to cut off both the pilgrim traffic and food supplies to
the Hejaz, an action that would quickly take the region to utter ruin.
This was the sword that hung over his head, Hussein had intimated to
Constantinople, and the underlying reason why he had to tread so
carefully before the regime’s demands.</p>
<p>But to Curt Prüfer it was all a rather outrageous bluff. Put simply,
the British would never risk incurring the wrath of the Muslim world by
starving out, let alone invading, the Islamic holy land; Germany should
be so lucky. At the same time, Hussein, as the guardian of Mecca and
Medina, wouldn’t dare go over to the British, for that same Muslim wrath
would then be directed at him. Instead, the wily old emir in Mecca was
playing both sides, keeping the British at bay—and their food subsidies
and pilgrim traffic intact—through advertising his differences with
Constantinople, and keeping Constantinople at bay through touting the
contrived British threat.</p>
<p>The problem was, the Turks would not challenge Hussein nor allow
their allies to do so. Since arriving in the region, Prüfer and the
other German intelligence agents had been explicitly forbidden from
involving themselves in Hejazi affairs in any way. Even during Faisal’s
upcoming visit, Djemal intended to screen the young sheikh from his
German advisors as much as possible. Instead, the Syrian governor would
undoubtedly pursue the same course the Young Turks had adopted with the
Hussein family for the past six years—solicitousness and flattery
blended with veiled threats—and to the same negligible effect.</p>
<p>What made all this especially maddening to Prüfer was that Hussein
was one of the linchpins in bringing the pan-Islamic jihad to full
flower. Without the Hashemite leader’s blessing, that fatwa remained a
concoction of the Young Turk regime; with his blessing, fires might be
ignited throughout the Middle East and beyond.</p>
<p>In his November report to Oppenheim, Prüfer had concluded that the
emir was “luckily powerless and in our hands.” The challenge now was to
convince everyone else—Djemal, the Young Turks in Constantinople,
Hussein himself—that this was true.</p>
<p>THERE IS LITTLE indication that Lawrence was following events in the
Arabian Peninsula, or was even aware of them, during his first few
months with the intelligence unit in Cairo—understandable given his
almost obsessive focus on Syria. That changed when he made the
acquaintance of Ronald Storrs, the British Oriental secretary to
Egypt.</p>
<p>With his pencil-thin mustache and fondness for white linen suits,
Storrs cut a dandyish figure among the predominantly uniformed British
population of wartime Cairo, a Cambridge-educated aesthete with an
encyclopedic knowledge of opera, Renaissance art, and classical
literature. Shipping out to Egypt as a young man, he had passed through
a number of positions in the British administration there before winning
appointment as Oriental secretary in 1909 at the age of
twenty-eight.</p>
<p>It was a position he was born for. Along with being a decorous
presence at the official receptions and galas of which the British
community in Cairo was especially fond, Storrs acted as the right-hand
man of the resident British consul general to Egypt, a behind-the-scenes
monitor of the nation’s myriad political intrigues. His star had risen
considerably when Lord Kitchener assumed that post in 1911. Quickly
coming to regard Storrs as his most trusted lieutenant—the Oriental
secretary had been instrumental in torpedoing Curt Prüfer’s appointment
to the khedival library directorship, for example—Kitchener had
maintained their relationship even after his appointment to war
secretary in August 1914. Since he fully intended to return to his
Egyptian post once the war was over, Kitchener had left his protégé
behind in Cairo to serve as his eyes and ears.</p>
<p>But there was rather more to it than that. In Kitchener’s service,
Ronald Storrs was the crucial conduit in a game of political intrigue so
sensitive it was known to only a handful of men in Cairo, London, and
Mecca, the possessor of perhaps the most dangerous secret in the Middle
East. By befriending T. E. Lawrence and bringing him in on that secret,
Storrs would set the young intelligence officer on the course that was
to bring him fame and glory.</p>
<p>At least initially, that friendship was based on the supremely
ordinary, a mutual love of classical literature. As the rather fusty
Storrs related of Lawrence in his memoir, “We had no literary
differences, except that he preferred Homer to Dante and disliked my
preference for Theocritus before Aristophanes.”</p>
<p>At some point in the winter of 1915, their discussions turned to more
current topics, specifically to the covert mission that Storrs was
conducting for Lord Kitchener.</p>
<p>The story had begun a year earlier, in February 1914, when Abdullah
ibn Hussein, the thirty-two-year-old second son of Emir Hussein of
Mecca, came calling in Cairo. While the emir’s disenchantment with the
Constantinople regime was becoming fairly common knowledge by that
point, Abdullah pushed matters into a whole new realm; granted a brief
meeting with Kitchener, he attempted to sound out the consul general on
what British reaction would be to an outright Arab revolt in the
Hejaz.</p>
<p>Kitchener took pains to sidestep the query. After all, Britain and
Turkey were still at peace then, and it simply wouldn’t do for the
former to encourage revolt in the latter. When Abdullah returned to
Cairo two months later hoping for a second meeting, Kitchener foisted
him off on his Oriental secretary.</p>
<p>Whatever limited subtlety Abdullah had managed with Kitchener, it was
absent from his meeting with Storrs. “I found myself being asked
categorically whether Britain would present the Grand Sharif [Hussein]
with a dozen, or even a half dozen machine guns,” Storrs recalled. “When
I enquired what could possibly be their purpose, he replied (like all
rearmers) for defence; and, pressed further, added that the defence
would be against attack from the Turks. I needed no special instructions
to inform him that we could never entertain the idea of supplying arms
to be used against a friendly power.”</p>
<p>But that second meeting with Abdullah had been in April 1914, and by
the following September, matters had changed a great deal. As he waited
to see if Turkey would come into the war, now–War Secretary Kitchener
had reason to recall his earlier conversation with Hussein’s son and to
appreciate that he might have a unique opportunity awaiting him in
Arabia. Rather than work through senior officials in the British
military or civilian administrations in Egypt, Kitchener sent an
encrypted cable to his old Cairo office: “Tell Storrs to send secret and
carefully chosen messenger from me to the Sharif Abdullah to ascertain
whether, should present German influence in Constantinople coerce
[Turkey into] … war against Great Britain, he and his father and Arabs
of the Hejaz would be with us or against us.”</p>
<p>Hussein’s reply, which arrived just as Turkey joined the war, was
tantalizing. While stating that he would endeavor to stay neutral,
Hussein hinted that with sufficient external support and concrete
promises from Britain to stay out of internal Arabian affairs, he might
lead his “immediate followers into revolt.”</p>
<p>Seizing on that prospect, Kitchener swiftly sent another message that
dramatically upped the ante. Should the Arabs join with Britain, rather
than merely stay neutral, Kitchener wrote, “Great Britain will guarantee
the independence, rights and privileges of the Sherifate against all
external foreign aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans. Till
now we have defended and befriended Islam in the person of the Turks
[sic]; henceforward it shall be in that of the noble Arab.”</p>
<p>But then Hussein seemed to equivocate somewhat. In his next letter,
received by Storrs in December, the emir repeated his intention to
“avoid any action detrimental to the British,” but also indicated that
any outright break with Turkey would have to wait until sometime in the
indefinite future. And there the matter rested. In the months since
Hussein had sent that last message, there had been no word out of
Mecca.</p>
<p>To Lawrence, the details of this secret correspondence with Hussein
came as something of a revelation. Since arriving in Cairo, he had
devoted great energy to gauging the possibility of an Arab revolt in
Syria, a revolt that, almost by definition, would be reliant on
so-called progressives: businessmen and intellectuals disaffected by the
corruption of the Constantinople regime, minorities yearning for
equality, Arab officers and conscripts frustrated by the military’s
Turkish chauvinism. Of conservative Arabia he knew virtually
nothing.</p>
<p>Yet from a political standpoint, Lawrence quickly appreciated the
Hejazi potential. An alliance with Hussein would inoculate the British
against the charge that it was fomenting rebellion as a means of taking
over the Middle East; as guardian of the holy cities, it would be quite
unthinkable to most Muslims that Emir Hussein had entered a partnership
with land-grabbing infidels. To the contrary, a revolt starting in the
Hejaz and under his leadership would carry the imprimatur of religious
sanction, neatly nullifying the Islam-versus-Crusaders propaganda being
promoted by the Turks and Max von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>But trying to assess where things stood in the absence of any new
communication from Hussein was a perplexing process. On the one hand, he
did appear to be living up to his promise of neutrality, as evidenced by
his continuing noncommittal stance on the call to jihad. On the other
hand, he had recently sent his third son, Faisal, to meet with Djemal
Pasha in Syria, and to then proceed to Constantinople for more meetings
with the Young Turk leadership. Since Faisal was generally considered to
be the most moderate and sober-minded of Hussein’s sons, the obvious
conclusion was that Hussein was inching his way back toward a
rapprochement with Constantinople and that the brief, tantalizing
prospect of an Arab revolt in the Hejaz had slipped from British
hands.</p>
<p>For his part, Lawrence soon had far more pressing concerns than
trying to read the tea leaves of Hejazi politics. By early April 1915,
all attention in British Egypt had turned to the upcoming naval and
ground offensive against the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>DURING THE FIRST weeks of April, a vast flotilla of ships began to
assemble along the northern coast of Egypt, while in the tent cities
that dotted the shoreline, tens of thousands of soldiers were kept busy
hauling supplies and practicing combat drills. They were members of the
newly formed Mediterranean Expeditionary Force (Med-Ex for short) soon
to be on their way to strike at the head and heart of the Turkish enemy.
Despite the tedium of their wait, the mood of the troops was exuberant,
keen.</p>
<p>With T. E. Lawrence, the sentiment was foreboding. The trepidation he
had felt from the outset of the Dardanelles operation only deepened
after he and other members of the Cairo intelligence unit were sent up
to the staging area to brief its commanders on what they might expect at
the other end. “The Med-Ex came out, beastly ill-prepared,” Lawrence
wrote David Hogarth on April 20, “with no knowledge of where it was
going, or what it would meet, or what it was going to do.” Most shocking
of all to Lawrence, to plot their ground offensive, the Med-Ex senior
staff had arrived in Egypt with exactly two copies of an obsolete
quarter-inch-to-the-mile map of the Dardanelles region.</p>
<p>But when it came to committing folly, British war planners were just
warming up. The principal landing zones for Med-Ex, it had been decided,
would be on the Gallipoli peninsula, that thin ribbon of rugged
mountains that forms the Dardanelles’ western shore. Rarely more than
six or seven miles across, the peninsula runs northward for some fifty
miles before finally broadening out onto the European mainland. In
selecting where to go ashore, the British could have chosen any number
of spots along Gallipoli’s length where a ground force, once gaining the
ridgeline and climbing down to the opposite shore—a distance of less
than three miles in places—would have split the Ottoman army in two and
trapped any enemy forces positioned below that line. Of course, the best
option might have been to sidestep the peninsula completely and put in
at the Gulf of Saros at its northern end. An invasion force coming
ashore in that broad bay would not only maroon all the Turkish troops
garrisoned on Gallipoli, but would then have a virtually unimpeded path
through easy countryside to Constantinople, just 100 miles away. This
was certainly the greatest fear of General Liman von Sanders, the German
commander recently appointed by the Turkish government to oversee the
Dardanelles defense; in anticipation of a landing at Saros, he had
placed his headquarters and fully a third of his army there.</p>
<p>The one possibility that Sanders tended to discount entirely was a
landing at Gallipoli’s southern tip, simply because the most basic rules
of military logic—even mere common sense—argued against it. Not only
would a landing force there be vulnerable to defenders dug in on the
heights above them, but completely exposed to whatever long-range
Turkish artillery remained operable in their nearby fortresses. And even
if such a force managed to scale the heights and seize those forts, the
Turkish defenders could then begin a slow withdrawal up the peninsula,
throwing up new trenchlines as they went, neatly replicating the static
trench warfare that had so paralyzed the armies on the Western Front.
Indeed, one would be hard pressed to find a worse landing site most
anywhere on the three-thousand-mile-long Mediterranean coast of the
Ottoman Empire—yet it was precisely here that Med-Ex was going
ashore.</p>
<p>Along with condescension for the enemy, always a perilous mind-set
for an army, that decision was apparently born of sheer bureaucratic
obduracy. Since the Dardanelles campaign had been conceived as a naval
operation, the success or failure of the expanded mission would continue
to be judged through the narrow lens of its original objective—clearing
the straits—leaving its planners quite blind to the idea of trying a
different approach that might ultimately achieve the same end.
Incredibly, it seems the Gallipoli strategists had less rejected
alternative landing sites than never seriously considered them.</p>
<p>In late April, the Med-Ex soldiers on the Egyptian coast began piling
into the troopships that would take them across the eastern
Mediterranean to Gallipoli. Lawrence, looking back over his failed
efforts of the previous months, not just Alexandretta but a range of
other schemes that he and the Cairo intelligence unit had concocted only
to see shelved, could scarcely conceal his anger in another letter to
Hogarth:</p>
<p>“Arabian affairs have gone all to pot. I’ve never seen a more
despicable mess made of a show. It makes one howl with fury, for we had
a ripping chance there.” He ended on a somewhat forlorn note: “Push on
A[lexandretta] therefore, if you can; it seems to me the only thing left
for us.”</p>
<p>When he wrote that letter, on April 26, Lawrence did not know how bad
the mess was about to become. Just the day before, Med-Ex had gone
ashore at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>AT ABOUT 6:15 on the morning of April 25, SS River Clyde, a converted
collier out of Liverpool, closed on a small, gently arcing
beach—code-named V Beach—at Cape Helles, the southern tip of the
Gallipoli peninsula. Crammed belowdecks were some two thousand British
soldiers. Coming in on the gentle seas alongside the Clyde were five or
six launches, each towing several open cutters, likewise crammed to
their gunwales with more soldiers. At about one hundred yards out, the
cutter skippers cast off their towlines and distributed oars so that
their crews might row the rest of the way to shore. From that shore came
no sign of life at all. It appeared, just as hoped, that the landing at
Cape Helles had caught the Turks completely off guard.</p>
<p>A damned good thing, too, for the slapdash preparations made for
those going ashore at V Beach—and the notion of sending men onto an
enemy beach in unarmored and motorless wooden boats wasn’t the worst of
it—suggested trouble if they met any resistance. In an Alexandria
shipyard, workers had started in on a camouflage paint job of the River
Clyde but had run out of time; as a result, as the collier approached V
Beach that morning, its muted battleship gray was offset by enormous
splotches of tan primer, making it stand out against the sea as if
illuminated. Then there was the small matter of the Clyde being unable
to actually reach the beach. The plan instead was to run her aground
offshore and then to maneuver several fishing boats into the gap,
lashing them together to create a makeshift bridge from ship to shore.
At that point, the disembarking soldiers would emerge from four portals
cut into the Clyde’s bow, pass along two gangways to the fishing boats,
then clamber over those until finally they reached the beach. It’s hard
to imagine that such blithe preparations would have attended a landing
against Stone Age Pacific Islanders, let alone against a modern army,
but such was the contempt with which British war planners held the
Turks.</p>
<p>As the cutters neared the beach, the only sounds floating over the
quiet bay were of boat engines and the dipping of oars, of men talking
and laughing—perhaps a bit louder than normal out of relief at their
uneventful landing. It was when the lead boats were just yards off the
beach that the Turkish machine gunners, secreted in strategic vantage
points along the shoreline, opened up.</p>
<p>The men in the open cutters never had a chance. One after another,
these boats were shot to pieces or capsized, the gear-laden soldiers
within them drowning in the surf or picked off after becoming entangled
in the barbed wire that been strung below the water’s surface. Most of
the very few who made it onto the beach alive were soon cut down by
raking machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>Those coming off the Clyde fared little better. Time and again, work
crews emerged from the protected steel hull to try to lash the ersatz
pontoon bridge together, only to be shot down almost immediately or to
similarly drown in the surf. When finally a bridge of sorts was
established, the soldiers emerging onto the gangways were easy targets;
of the first company of two hundred men to go out the portals, only
eleven reached shore. Many of the early casualties on the gangways
actually died of suffocation, pinned beneath the growing heaps of dead
and wounded of those coming behind. Whoever did manage to make the beach
huddled for safety behind a six-foot-high sand escarpment at its
landward edge, scant protection against machine-gun bullets. By late
afternoon, there were so many dead men in the water that, as a British
captain on the scene observed, “the sea near the shore was a red blood
colour, which could be seen hundreds of yards away.”</p>
<p>By the end of that first day, the advance landing forces at Gallipoli
had already suffered nearly four thousand casualties, or considerably
more than the total number of men Lawrence had projected would be needed
to secure Alexandretta. So bewildered was General von Sanders by his
enemy’s idiocy that for the next day he remained convinced the southern
landing was a mere feint and that the main invasion force was still
coming elsewhere. This left it to a local Ottoman divisional commander,
Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal, acting on his own accord, to
repeatedly hurl his men against the invaders clinging to their tiny
beachheads in an attempt to throw them back into the sea.</p>
<p>The first-day objective of those landing on Cape Helles had been to
secure a small village some four miles inland, and then to advance on
the Turkish forts just above. Over the next seven months, the British
would never reach that village, but would suffer nearly a quarter of a
million casualties trying. As for the Ottoman commander, Mustafa Kemal,
the world would soon hear more about him; in 1922, he would emerge as
the savior of the reconstituted Turkish republic and become better known
by his honorific, Kemal Ataturk.</p>
<p>BUT IT WASN’T just the estimated half million soldiers killed or
wounded on either side of the trenchline who would fall victim to the
consequences of Gallipoli. On the very day the British came ashore,
April 25, the Constantinople regime ordered the roundup of some two
hundred Armenian intellectuals and business leaders whom it accused of
being potential fifth columnists for the invaders. It was the beginning
of a brutal “cleansing operation” against the Ottoman Empire’s Christian
minority—a genocide in the view of many—that would result in the deaths
of as many as a million Armenians and Assyrians over the next year.</p>
<p>It would be some time before Lawrence and other British officers
involved in the Middle Eastern theater came to appreciate that there had
been yet another casualty at Gallipoli: the chance for a sweeping Arab
revolt against the Turks, one that conceivably could have stretched from
the Hejaz to northern Syria and clear over to Iraq. The details of this
missed opportunity wouldn’t be fully known for well over a year, not
until Lawrence came face-to-face with Emir Hussein’s soft-spoken third
son, Faisal, and learned there had been a good deal more to his journey
north in the spring of 1915 than met the eye.</p>
<p>In January 1915, at almost the same time that he learned of the
Medina governor’s plot to overthrow him, Emir Hussein had been visited
in Mecca by a Syrian man named Fawzi al-Bakri. A long-standing and
trusted member of the emir’s retinue, on that visit al-Bakri had
revealed that he was also a high-ranking member of al-Fatat, a secret
society of Arab nationalists headquartered in his hometown of Damascus
with cells throughout Syria and Iraq. Having learned of Hussein’s secret
correspondence with the British, the al-Fatat leadership had sent
al-Bakri to Mecca with a proposal: a joint revolt against Constantinople
by al-Fatat in Syria and the emir’s forces in Hejaz, to be supported by
the British and with Hussein serving as its spiritual leader.</p>
<p>Rather than give a definitive reply to this proposal, the cautious
Hussein had instead sent Faisal north on a dual mission: to gauge the
family’s current standing in Constantinople, but also to assess the true
prospects for an alliance with al-Fatat.</p>
<p>Arriving in Damascus in late March, Faisal politely declined Djemal
Pasha’s invitation to stay at the governor’s mansion, explaining that he
had already accepted the hospitality of a prominent Damascene family:
the al-Bakris. In that home, shielded by high walls, Faisal held a long
series of talks with the al-Fatat conspirators, and it was the delicate
negotiations at those talks that largely explained why his stay in
Damascus, originally intended to be brief, extended to some three
weeks.</p>
<p>Journeying on to Constantinople, the young sheikh deftly worked the
other side of the street. In meetings with the other two members of the
Young Turk triumvirate, Enver and Talaat, as well as the newly arrived
Max von Oppenheim, Faisal repeatedly expressed his family’s fealty to
the Ottoman cause, going so far as to sign an accord with Enver that
appeared to finally put to rest many of the issues standing between
Constantinople and his father. In mid-May, and to the accompaniment of
an elaborate farewell ceremony organized by a grateful regime, he
boarded a train at Haidar Pasha station for the return to Syria.</p>
<p>But that journey was into a world transformed. Just weeks after the
landings in Gallipoli, already tens of thousands of Armenians were being
banished from their homes and sent into internal exile, and the view out
Faisal’s train window was onto an unending horror show of starving women
and children—and suspiciously few men—being herded along to God knows
where at bayonet point. From the standpoint of the proposed Arab revolt,
more grim news awaited him in Damascus. From his al-Fatat confederates,
Faisal learned that many of the Arab-dominated military units in the
region—units the conspirators had counted on for support when the revolt
came—were already being dispatched to the Gallipoli killing fields,
replaced by regime-loyal Turkish regiments.</p>
<p>Despite the radically changed atmosphere, perhaps because of it, the
al-Fatat plotters had urged on Faisal a document to take to his father,
and through him to the British in Egypt. Soon to become known as the
Damascus Protocol, it consisted of a list of conditions whereby, with
British assistance, al-Fatat might still be able to launch their revolt.
As Faisal set out for his return to Mecca, the sole copy of the protocol
was hidden in the boot of his most trusted bodyguard.</p>
<p>In preparing for Faisal’s arrival in Syria back in March, Djemal
Pasha had regarded the emir’s third son as his last best hope to quell
Hussein’s restive heart. In fact, the Syrian governor was quite right in
this estimation, if for all the wrong reasons. At a Hussein family
conclave held at their summer palace in June, it would be Abdullah and
Ali who would lobby their father for immediate rebellion against
Constantinople, while Faisal, recent witness to all that Gallipoli had
wrought—the Armenians dying en masse along the Anatolian roadways, the
dispersal of the Arab units from northern Syria—would urge caution.</p>
<p>The knowledge of all this lay in the future for T. E. Lawrence. In
the days and weeks after the Gallipoli landings, as he read through the
cascade of grim battle reports coming over the wire at the Savoy Hotel
in Cairo, it may have been just as well that he remained ignorant of the
Damascus Protocol and of the would-be British allies waiting in Syria
and the Hejaz. An absolute precondition for their revolt, the al-Fatat
conspirators and Hussein would belatedly inform Cairo, a prerequisite
upon which all their actions depended, was a British landing at
Alexandretta.</p>

Secrets</h4>
<p>You know, men do nearly all die laughing, because they know death is
very terrible, and a thing to be forgotten till after it has come.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, IN A LETTER TO HIS MOTHER, 1916</p>
<p>Finding the demands of his mapping-room duties at the Savoy at least
temporarily eased by the departure of the Med-Ex army, in April 1915
Lawrence took over the task of editing an intelligence digest, a
compendium of reports from around the region to be distributed to the
upper echelons of the British military command. He described the
undertaking with his trademark sarcasm to a friend in England:</p>
<p>“We edit a daily newspaper, absolutely uncensored, for the
edification of twenty-eight generals; the circulation increases
automatically as they invent new generals. This paper is my only joy.
One can give the Turkish point of view (in imaginary conversations with
prisoners) of the proceedings of admirals and generals one dislikes, and
I rub it in in my capacity as editor-in-chief. There is also a weekly
letter to ‘Mother’ [the London War Office] in which one japes on a
grander scale yet.”</p>
<p>It was, of course, precisely this flippant attitude, one Lawrence
seemed determined to flaunt both in his correspondence and in person,
that so incensed his military superiors. But his defiance of soldierly
protocol also underscored a deeper truth: Lawrence was fundamentally not
of them, and was becoming less so all the time.</p>
<p>In just four months in the war theater, he had watched as Britain’s
best hope for an early victory over the Turks was shelved for no better
reason than politics and institutional inertia; in its place, the “great
thinkers” had come up with Gallipoli. From what the Oxford scholar had
seen, military culture was a world of hidebound careerists looking for a
knighthood or their next medal, and of underlings loath to question the
powerful, with countless thousands dying as a result.</p>
<p>What’s more, by dint of his position in the Cairo military
intelligence unit, Lawrence was uniquely positioned to know the truth
behind the lies and propaganda on an ongoing basis. Every day he saw the
raw battlefield reports coming into the Savoy Hotel from the various war
theaters, and these told a tale of staggering incompetence and
callousness: of soldiers ordered to stay in formation as they advanced
over open ground toward enemy machine-gun nests; of hundreds dying to
capture and lose and capture again a single village, a single hillock.
Certainly a select group of other junior-ranked men had access to this
information too—generals’ aides and officers in similar military
intelligence units in the various war theaters—but most of these were
aspirants to the system, willing cogs in the vast, dumb meat-grinding
machinery that none dared acknowledge as such.</p>
<p>THE GERMAN MILITARY mission in Jerusalem was housed in the Hospice
for Russian Pilgrims, in the pleasant and orderly neighborhood just
north of the Old City known as the Russian Compound. It was there that
Curt Prüfer could often be found through the late winter of 1915, poring
over intelligence cables and calculating his next move.</p>
<p>With a bit of distance from the event, the disillusionment he’d felt
for the concept of holy war in the immediate aftermath of the Suez
assault had eased somewhat. He recognized that with the Turkish forces
getting no farther than the canal’s banks, the idea remained an
essentially untested one. He also recognized that despite that first
setback, British Egypt could not be left alone, that so long as it
existed, it posed the primary threat to the German-Turkish alliance in
the Middle East. So a new assault was necessary, this time supported by
far greater firepower, including German artillery and aircraft, as well
as far better military intelligence, an apparatus that could provide
details on what the British on the far side of the canal were planning,
where their troops were deployed.</p>
<p>The problem was, Prüfer’s own extensive intelligence network inside
Egypt had also fallen victim to the Suez assault. In the first days of
the war, he’d been able to use his Egyptian contacts to compile a
comprehensive view of the enemy’s preparations; in one memorable
November 1914 report, he’d written of British defenseworks in the future
tense—that is, of enemy installations still in the construction or
planning stage. All that had been shut down in the run‑up to Suez. As
Prüfer reported to his superiors in late February, his own “bitter,
practical experience” at the canal showed that most of the Bedouin and
Egyptians he’d hastily recruited as replacement spies had been
worthless, prone to “leaving honor and patriotism high and dry in the
face of the temptations of the circling British agents who are not at
all stingy with [gold] sovereigns.” Germany might conceivably follow the
British example and buy its way to a new informant network inside Egypt,
Prüfer pointed out, but that would leave it dependent on whatever
unverifiable intelligence these paid agents passed on, “functioning with
these people” rather than actually managing them. In pondering this
dilemma, the intelligence officer hit upon a rather shrewd idea: Jewish
spies.</p>
<p>That idea’s genesis may have stemmed from the company Prüfer was
keeping at the time. Her name was Minna Weizmann, a dynamic and very
pretty Jewish émigré in her mid-twenties from the town of Motal in White
Russia (modern-day Belarus). From a prominent and highly educated
family, Weizmann had embraced socialism from an early age, and had
seized her chance to escape the hated czarist regime while at medical
school in Berlin; in 1913, she’d immigrated to Palestine, becoming one
of the few women physicians in Syria. It had been in Jerusalem in early
1914 that she and Curt Prüfer, recently resigned from the German embassy
in Cairo, first met.</p>
<p>Although details of their relationship are sketchy, fragmentary
evidence suggests the union was a special one for both. A rumor finding
its way into German intelligence reports held that on the eve of
Prüfer’s departure for the Suez offensive in January, Weizmann had spent
the night in his Jerusalem hotel room, behavior so scandalous for the
time as to be ruinous for any woman not a prostitute. For his part,
there are indications that Weizmann was a good deal more than just
another amorous conquest for the ever-roving Prüfer; his wartime diaries
contain several references to “my dear Fanny,” Weizmann’s nickname,
signs of an affection rather absent in the few mentions of his American
wife, Frances Pinkham, who is usually referred to merely as “Fr.”</p>
<p>But if the bond with Minna Weizmann was true love, it was a love Curt
Prüfer was willing to put to a higher purpose.</p>
<p>When Turkey came into the war, there were tens of thousands of
Russian Jews scattered across Syrian Palestine who, like Minna Weizmann,
still retained Russian citizenship. Constantinople had quickly given
these now “belligerent nationals” a stark choice: become Ottoman
citizens or face deportation or internal exile. In response, thousands
of the émigrés had surrendered their Russian passports in favor of
Ottoman ones, while thousands more had crowded into packed ships at
Jaffa harbor in search of a new home. In March 1915, this exodus from
Palestine was continuing—warships from the neutral United States were
now complementing merchant vessels—and where most of these refugees were
ending up was in British Egypt. As Prüfer pointed out in a proposal he
sent to both Djemal Pasha and Max von Oppenheim, establishing a
successful spy network in Egypt required “people who can be introduced
into the country without suspicion, and have the necessary astuteness
and sang-froid. We can find a number of such people amongst the Jewish
population in this country.”</p>
<p>Giving this spy ring its reliability, in Prüfer’s estimation, would
be the Russian Jews’ abiding hatred of the anti-Semitic czarist regime.
Operating on the premise that the friend of one’s enemy is the enemy, he
reasoned there might be many members of this community in Palestine who
would jump at the chance to work against czarist Russian interests by
striking at her ally in the region, British Egypt. Best of all, as
Russian passport holders, these spies could simply join the ongoing
refugee boatlift to Egypt without arousing suspicion.</p>
<p>But if it was already a feat to insert intelligence operatives into
an enemy country in wartime, that still left the question of how to get
them or their information out. Here Prüfer’s scheme was truly clever. In
March 1915, Italy remained a neutral nation (it would join the Triple
Entente that May), and there was regular ship traffic between Italian
ports and Egypt. Rather than try to communicate with or return to
Turkey, Prüfer’s spies would transit to Italy and pass their information
on to the German embassy in Rome. At that point, they could either make
for Turkey overland or, if their cover remained intact, return to Egypt
for another round of intelligence gathering.</p>
<p>Warming to his topic, Prüfer further directed that the operatives
should be divided into two cells, one composed of men, the other of
women. Both cells “will try to steal relevant [British] documents or
make copies of them. They will also try to get friendly with people who
might be able to supply such information.” Lest there be any confusion
over what “friendly” meant, Prüfer spelled it out. “Above all, the women
agents—who must be young and not without charms—should try to get into
relationships with influential people who may, in a moment of weakness
borne of intimacy, let escape information that could be useful to
us.”</p>
<p>His proposal received an enthusiastic response from Oppenheim, as
well as from Ambassador von Wangenheim in Constantinople, and in early
April Prüfer began his recruitment drive. In short order, he’d managed
to procure the services of two Jewish émigrés, Isaac Cohn and Moses
Rothschild, who were leaving Palestine for Egypt. While Rothschild made
contact with a German spy nest at Shepheard’s Hotel, the favored lodging
and watering hole of the British high command in Cairo, Cohn undertook
an extensive tour of the British coastal defenses in Alexandria and
along the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>The spymaster clearly took his new enterprise very seriously and as a
true patriot was ready to let whatever affections he felt for Minna
Weizmann be trumped by those he held for the kaiser. In early May 1915,
Weizmann made the crossing to Egypt as the newest member of Prüfer’s spy
ring. She probably needed little in the way of persuading; as both a Jew
and a socialist, she might as well have been wearing a czarist
bull’s-eye on her back, and here was the chance for both adventure and
revenge.</p>
<p>Initially, Weizmann did very well in her new vocation, her hospital
work and the novelty of being a female physician giving her entrée to
the upper echelons of British Cairo society. Her luck didn’t hold,
however. Under the cover of accompanying a badly wounded French soldier
home, she managed to reach Italy, but there was observed meeting with
the German ambassador in Rome. Unmasked, she was hauled back to Egypt,
where she faced a decidedly grim future: internment in a British
prisoner-of-war camp at the very least, and possibly execution. Instead,
Weizmann’s considerable charms combined with old-fashioned chivalry
produced a far more pleasant outcome. As related by a Swiss woman who
crossed paths with Minna that August and heard her story, “she was so
beloved in Cairo and Alexandria, and held in such respect that people
gave her unwavering denial [of being a spy] credence.” Ironically, even
the czar’s consul in Cairo vouched for Minna’s innocence and arranged
for her safe passage back to Russia. It was while staying at a hotel in
Romania, in transit to the homeland she had escaped from two years
earlier, that Weizmann desperately reached out to the Swiss woman.</p>
<p>“She revealed everything to me,” Hilla Steinbach-Schuh explained to a
German official, “and fervently begged me to inform the German embassy
in Constantinople of her deportation, especially that Herr Prüfer should
be advised of this.”</p>
<p>But the remarkably tender treatment shown Minna Weizmann—she would
not only survive the war, but eventually return to Palestine to work for
the medical service of the Zionist women’s organization, Hadassah—may
have also stemmed from her lineage. Her older brother was Chaim
Weizmann, a renowned chemist who had immigrated to Great Britain in 1904
and who in 1915 was already working closely with the British munitions
industry to improve their war-making capability; Chaim would go on to
become the first president of the state of Israel, while Minna’s nephew
Ezer would serve as its seventh. That lineage may also explain why Minna
has been largely excised from the history books, and even from the
Weizmann family’s memory (Chaim made not a single reference to his
sister in his memoirs); for “the first family of Israel” to count among
its members someone who not only spied for Germany but whose spymaster
lover went on to become a senior Nazi diplomat is surely one of those
awkward family stories best left untold.</p>
<p>Even before learning of Minna Weizmann’s fate, however, Curt Prüfer
had seen his fledgling Egyptian spy ring largely shut down, a result of
Italy’s joining the Triple Entente in May and the consequent severing of
the German embassy “ratline.” Still, Prüfer’s bold initiative had
greatly impressed his superiors in both the military and intelligence
spheres. As Lieutenant Colonel Kress von Kressenstein, the commander of
German forces in Palestine, informed Berlin, “Curt Prüfer is
indispensable as the leader of the intelligence service.”</p>
<p>ON MAY 9, 1915, T. E. Lawrence’s younger brother, twenty-two-year-
old Frank, stationed in the Arras sector of the Western Front, was doing
repair work on a forward trench in preparation for an assault when he
was struck by three shrapnel fragments from a German artillery shell.
Whether it was true or not, for soldiers routinely dissemble about such
things, Frank’s commanding officer reported in his condolence letter to
the Lawrence parents that their son had died instantly.</p>
<p>The news shattered Sarah Lawrence. By most accounts, Frank had been
her favorite child, and since being shipped off to France in February he
had written her long, discursive letters filled with descriptions of the
foibles of military life and his everyday existence at the front.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence learned of Frank’s death in a telegram from his
parents in mid-May. For whatever reason, he waited to respond until he
had received more information from his father through the mail. It
wasn’t until June 4 that he finally scribbled out a hasty note to his
parents on a telegram form:</p>
<p>I haven’t written since I got your wire as I was waiting for details.
Today I got Father’s two letters. They are very comfortable reading, and
I hope that when I die there will be nothing more to regret. The only
thing I feel a little is that there was no need, surely, to go into
mourning for him? I cannot see any cause at all. In any case, to die for
one’s country is a sort of privilege. Mother and you will find it more
painful and harder to live for it than he did to die, but I think that
at this time, it is one’s duty to show no signs that would distress
others, and to appear bereaved is surely under this condemnation.</p>
<p>So please, keep a brave face to the world. We cannot all go fighting,
but we can do that, which is in the same kind. N[ed].</p>
<p>Perhaps the note’s most interesting aspect, beyond its startling
coldness, was Lawrence’s invocation of a kind of puerile patriotism that
he had long derided. In any event, Sarah Lawrence was hardly in the mood
to adhere to this stiff advice from her son. Shortly after, she wrote
Ned another letter, in which she evidently (evidently because this
letter has never been found) upbraided him for not expressing his love
for her in her hour of grief. If Sarah Lawrence hoped this would stir a
softening in her second son, she was to be disappointed:</p>
<p>Poor Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I got your letter this morning, and it has grieved me very much. You
will never never understand any of us after we are grown up a little.
Don’t you ever feel that we love you without our telling you so? I feel
such a contemptible worm for having to write this way about things. If
you only knew that if one thinks deeply about anything, one would rather
die than say anything about it. You know, men do nearly all die
laughing, because they know death is very terrible, and a thing to be
forgotten till after it has come.</p>
<p>There, put that aside, and bear a brave face to the world about
Frank. In a time of such fearful stress in our country it is one’s duty
to watch very carefully lest one of the weaker ones be offended; and you
know, we were always the stronger, and if they see you broken down they
will all grow fearful about their ones at the front.</p>
<p>Lawrence next wrote his parents about a week later; he made no
reference to Frank—indeed, he rarely mentioned him by name in any
subsequent correspondence—and instead spent the bulk of the brief note
describing the weather just then in Cairo.</p>
<p>DJEMAL PASHA WAS in a much-improved mood by early June 1915. He had
good reason to be. When the Allied forces had come ashore at Gallipoli
on April 25, it largely mooted the possibility of a landing somewhere in
Syria. Better yet, with both sides pouring more men and matériel into
that narrow strip of battlefield, the Syrian governor had been provided
with the means to be rid of the more troublesome military units in his
zone. In response to Constantinople’s urgent call for reinforcements,
Djemal had immediately begun dispatching his Arab-dominated regiments in
northern Syria to Gallipoli, replacing them with newly mustered Turkish
formations from the Anatolian interior—utterly green soldiers, perhaps,
but at least their loyalty could be relied upon. And of course, the
removal of the potentially mutinous Arab troops meant that the schemes
of the French consulate plotters, and whatever other separatist-minded
Arab traitors might be skulking about, were now far less dangerous.</p>
<p>There had also been good news in regard to the troublesome Hussein
family in the Hejaz. Building on the lavish treatment he had bestowed
upon Faisal in Jerusalem and Damascus, Djemal had sent word to
Constantinople that the charm offensive should continue once the young
sheikh reached the Ottoman capital. That directive had been followed; in
early May, the offending Medina civilian governor was transferred,
allowing Faisal and Enver Pasha to fashion an accord that suggested a
full rapprochement between the Young Turks and the irksome Hussein in
Mecca. That was certainly the estimation of Max von Oppenheim, who had
two long meetings with Faisal in Constantinople, and of Djemal himself
when Faisal returned to Syria in late May. In an emotional address
before Djemal’s senior military staff at the German Hospice, Hussein’s
son had professed his undying loyalty to both the empire and the cause
of pan-Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>There had even been some progress with the locust plague. Certainly
the ravages of that infestation would be sorely felt in the autumn
harvest, but through the energetic efforts of the Jewish scientist Aaron
Aaronsohn and his modern trenching techniques, it appeared that
full-scale catastrophe had been averted.</p>
<p>Yet amid this brighter outlook, a new crisis had engulfed the
empire—or rather, an old one had erupted anew.</p>
<p>Within the Ottoman court, the Christian Armenians of Anatolia had
long been regarded as potential fifth columnists for Christian
invaders—and especially for its Russian archenemies—and for just as long
the Armenians had suffered periodic massacres at the hands of their
Turkish and Kurdish Muslim neighbors. The most recent bout of slaughter,
in the 1890s, had led to the deaths of at least fifty thousand Armenians
in a matter of days.</p>
<p>This historical animus had been rekindled by the regime’s call to
jihad against the “Christian enemies” in November 1914. The
Armenians—ethnically and linguistically apart, as well as numerous
enough to pose a plausible threat—were uniquely vulnerable to a spark
that might set off a new wave of anti-Armenian fury. That spark had come
with a Russian offensive into eastern Anatolia, when the Armenians
became the perfect scapegoats for explaining away Turkish setbacks on
the battlefield. Thus the stage was set: in the rhetoric of the
Constantinople regime, and in the minds of many of its Turkish and
Kurdish subjects, the some two million Armenians of Anatolia were now
the enemy within.</p>
<p>On April 24, on the eve of the Allied landings at Gallipoli, Interior
Minister Talaat had ordered the arrest of hundreds of Armenian civic
leaders in Constantinople, and simultaneously instructed the governors
of those provinces with a substantial Armenian population to immediately
close down on all Armenian “revolutionary and political organizations”
and arrest their leaders. This directive, carrying the suggestion that a
credible Armenian secessionist movement actually existed, had terrible
consequences; in the eyes of many government officials in the
hinterlands, all Armenians were the enemy. Within days of Talaat’s
directive, tens of thousands of ordinary Armenian civilians were being
pulled from their homes, to be force-marched to some unspecified
“relocation zone” elsewhere, or in many cases simply butchered where
they stood.</p>
<p>Given the porousness of Turkey’s frontiers, as well as the presence
of Western mission schools throughout the empire, reports had soon
started coming into Constantinople telling of massacres of Armenians
across the breadth of Anatolia, of corpses lining the routes of their
forced marches into the countryside. As the horror stories multiplied,
on May 24, the foreign ministers of the Triple Entente issued a
proclamation vowing that the Young Turk leadership would be held
responsible for “these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and
civilization.”</p>
<p>Constantinople’s response was one of defiance; three days after the
Entente proclamation, the Turkish cabinet approved the “Provisional Law
of Relocation.” Without specifically citing the Armenians, the law
stated that the army was now “authorized and compelled to crush in the
most severe way” any sign of resistance or aggression among the
population. To do so, it had the power “to transfer and relocate the
populations of villages and towns, either individually or collectively,
in response to military needs, or in response to any signs of treachery
or betrayal.” As for where this potentially vast sea of internal
deportees might be sent, Talaat and Enver had already selected a spot:
gathered up from across Anatolia, most would be herded down to the
barren reaches of northern Syria. The insanity inherent in this scheme,
of uprooting a vast population and casting it into a land already
devastated by the deprivations of war, would play out to obscene result:
by best estimate, some 800,000 of the Armenian deportees were to
perish—starved, shot, or beaten to death—en route.</p>
<p>The consensus among historians is that Djemal Pasha stood very much
apart from his Young Turk coleaders in his response to the expulsions.
In June, the first survivors of the death marches began to trickle into
the north Syrian city of Aleppo, a way station toward their intended
destination, the “relocation zone” of Deir al-Zour some one hundred
miles to the east. Visiting Aleppo, Djemal Pasha was horrified by what
he saw. Reiterating a March decree that commanded his army to protect
the Armenians, he lobbied Constantinople to impose the order on military
units where it really mattered, in Anatolia. That plea was ignored.</p>
<p>Getting no satisfaction from Constantinople, Djemal allowed thousands
of Armenians to remain in Aleppo rather than continue their death march,
and despite the deepening hunger and food shortages spreading through
Syria, he ordered an increase of government food aid to the refugees.
Testament to his love of order and regulations, he issued a rash of new
edicts directing that the army regulate and maintain the food supply for
the Armenians, that cars and horses be procured for their
transportation, even that each refugee be given a financial allowance.
But implicit in the stacks of documents that the Syrian governor signed
in his office each day was the notion that his regime actually had the
wherewithal to carry out these initiatives, never mind that all
evidence—evidence that started just outside Djemal’s office windows and
stretched to the farthest corners of his realm—argued otherwise. It was
as if he fancied himself the administrator of a canton of peacetime
Switzerland, rather than of a poor and highly fractured region the size
of Italy that was being ravaged by war, hunger, and disease. In the face
of the Armenian crisis, as with so many other problems that came his
way, Djemal responded with a mixture of bluster, threats, and pleas, and
when none of that worked, he simply averted his gaze. By September, with
the crisis worsening, he issued a new edict, making it a criminal
offense to photograph the Armenians.</p>
<p>SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED to Aaron Aaronsohn in the Palestinian
village of Katra, when an elderly Arab man approached him with the words
“zatna mamnounin”—“we are grateful to you.” As the agronomist noted in
his diary that evening, “the Arabs did not speak that way to Jews only
twenty years ago. The job I undertake is a hard one indeed, but to
compel the natives to declare, even if they are false in their hearts,
zatna mamnounin to the Jews, for them to realize they are helpless in
such calamities if we don’t help them out, that is already
worthwhile.”</p>
<p>As the head of Djemal’s locust eradication program, Aaronsohn
traveled the length of the Syrian plague zone that spring of 1915,
giving public lectures and holding field workshops on how best to combat
the pestilence. At his urging, Djemal Pasha decreed that every man,
woman, and child was to collect six rotels, about forty pounds, of
locust eggs for destruction or face an exorbitant fine.</p>
<p>But even for a man of unflagging energy, there were times when the
enormity of the task cast Aaronsohn into despair. Despite all the
eradication efforts, the swarms continued to expand—at least one was
credibly measured at one mile wide and seven miles long—as did the scope
of their destruction. Ever more of lowland Judea, normally a verdant
green at that time of year, became a study in brown: mile after mile of
orchards stripped bare of both fruit and leaf, fields so devoid of
vegetation they appeared set in winter fallow.</p>
<p>As crises everywhere have a tendency to do, the locust plague also
laid bare the inequalities and deficiencies of Syrian society. Despite
the extraordinary powers given him by Djemal, the response Aaronsohn
typically encountered among local bureaucrats and military officers he
tried to enlist to the eradication effort fell somewhere between
uninterest and defiance. In Jaffa, he had been compelled to shame the
kaimmakam, or local governor, into attending his public lecture, only to
watch the man pointedly leave the auditorium halfway through. The old
man in the village of Katra notwithstanding, the far more common
response in Arab villages was resignation; to them, the locusts were
djesh Allah, or “God’s army,” and it was futile, perhaps even
sacrilegious, to resist it. Also laid bare was officialdom’s resentment
of the Jewish colonists, which was always simmering just beneath the
surface. Ottoman tax officials were punctilious in handing out fines for
insufficient egg collection in Jewish villages, while those same
shortfalls—and in many cases complete inactivity—in Arab villages were
ignored. In a particularly outrageous case, Aaronsohn reported, shortly
after all the plowhorses in the Jewish settlement of Petah Tikvah had
been taken away under the war requisitions statute, their owners were
fined under the locust eradication statute for failing to plow their
fields. Time and again, he threatened to resign from his
inspector-general position in disgust, only to receive new assurances
from Djemal that the problems and inequities would be addressed, that a
new day of harmony and collective effort was just around the corner.</p>
<p>At least part of Aaronsohn’s discontent, however, was rooted in the
deeply personal, a change that had come over him during his travels
through Palestine. For the first time, he had begun to question the
Ottoman Empire’s ability to survive—or, perhaps more accurately, the
ability of the Jewish community to survive in her thrall. It went far
beyond the petty harassments and corruption he had witnessed. At most
every Jewish settlement he’d visited, he had been approached by
frightened residents who told of growing tension with their Arab
neighbors, of overt threats from local officials brandishing
weapons.</p>
<p>The warning signs didn’t attach solely to the Jews. In April,
Aaronsohn had dispatched his brother Alex to Lebanon, both to see if the
locusts had reached there and to check on their youngest sister, Rivka,
who had been hustled off to Beirut during those tense days when the
Turkish army was searching for Zichron’s arms cache. Under the terms of
the Capitulations, Christian-dominated Lebanon had always enjoyed a
great measure of freedom from Constantinople, and had become a proud and
prosperous Francophile enclave in Syria; as Alex reported back, even
though Lebanon had escaped the locusts, it was now a sad and broken
place, with Turkish soldiers everywhere and even the normally haughty
Beirutis living in dread of what might come next. By early June came the
most alarming reports yet, dark rumors about the massacre of Armenians
in Anatolia. It was just around this time that Aaronsohn’s brooding led
him to two interlocking conclusions: the Jews in Palestine had to break
with the Ottoman Empire. To achieve that break, they had to actively
work for its downfall.</p>
<p>The agronomist was undoubtedly helped in reaching this conclusion by
his assistant at Athlit, Absalom Feinberg, a twenty-six-year-old
firebrand who was engaged to Aaronsohn’s sister Rivka. In his home
village of Hadera, a Jewish colony just ten miles south of Zichron,
Feinberg had formed a local chapter of the Gideonites, the paramilitary
organization that both protected Jewish settlements and launched
reprisal raids against their perceived Arab enemies. It was an activity
well suited to his political outlook, for to Feinberg the Arab-Jewish
struggle in Palestine was a contest between “culture and savagery,” and
there was little doubt which role the Arabs fulfilled. “I have lived
among them all my life,” he would write, “and it would be difficult to
sway me from my opinion that there is no more cowardly, hypocritical,
and false race than this one.”</p>
<p>But if there was one “race” Feinberg detested even more than the
Arab, it was the Turk, and ever since arriving at Athlit he had preached
to Aaron Aaronsohn the gospel of revolt, on the need for the Jews of
Palestine to rise up and throw off the Turkish yoke.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn, fourteen years Feinberg’s senior, may have laughed off his
assistant’s fiery oratory as the passion of youth, but a turning point
of sorts had been reached that previous January when Feinberg and twelve
other Hadera residents were arrested on the spurious charge of spying
for the British. Managing to escape, Feinberg had made straight for
Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>To win the release of the Hadera men, the agronomist contemplated
taking the path he had trod so often before—working his network of
contacts in the Ottoman bureaucracy, dispensing bribes where needed—but
this time Feinberg would have none of it. “Our worst enemy is the Turk,”
he told Aaronsohn. “Now that the hour of his downfall has struck, can we
stand by and do nothing? The Turks are right to suspect us. They know
the ruin they are planning for us. Anyone without a rabbit’s heart would
be proud to spy against them if it would help to bring the English.”</p>
<p>Certainly, Feinberg’s views hadn’t softened during the long days and
weeks he had spent with Aaronsohn on the locust eradication campaign.
Instead, by that June, it was the agronomist who had been converted.</p>
<p>As for how to work against the Turks—which by extension meant helping
the British—the answer was fairly obvious. Over the course of the locust
eradication effort, Aaronsohn and his various assistants had covered the
length of Palestine, and the scientist now had a stack of reports on his
desk detailing local conditions and resources for much of the region.
The lists of available resources had quite naturally included the size
and location of army camps, supply depots, and gasoline storage
facilities, all vital information for a large-scale civic campaign but
also for an enemy army. More specifically, these reports and Aaronsohn’s
own travels confirmed that the Turkish army was concentrated in just a
few towns and cities in Palestine, that virtually the entire coastline
had been left undefended save for a few motley crews of local gendarmes
and rural militia. The British clearly didn’t know this or they might
have stormed ashore long ago, and this was the most crucial intelligence
that Aaronsohn could provide them, a detailed, mile-by-mile report on
the opposition to be faced—or more accurately, not to be faced—along the
length of Palestine’s coast.</p>
<p>As to the question of getting word to the British that a spy ring was
waiting to be at their service in Palestine, the answer was even more
obvious. In Beirut and Haifa, American warships were continuing to
evacuate “neutrals” who wanted to leave the Ottoman Empire, and both
port cities boasted thriving black markets in forged documents. While
nothing in Syria was easy anymore, getting a messenger on board one of
the Egypt-bound evacuation ships was little more than a matter of money
and luck.</p>
<p>For Aaronsohn, it was also clear who this messenger should be. Twice
in the opening days of the war, his brother Alex had run afoul of the
Ottoman authorities, and he was now locked in a dangerous feud with a
local functionary. Furthermore, Alex spoke flawless English, courtesy of
a three-year residence in New York. So it was that in mid-July 1915 Alex
Aaronsohn boarded USS Des Moines in Beirut’s harbor. Joining him was his
“wife,” Rivka Aaronsohn. Once past the American warship’s first port of
call, the Greek island of Rhodes, the couple would continue on to Egypt,
where Alex would make straight for the British military intelligence
office in Cairo.</p>
<p>THE TRIP DOWN had been a delight: two weeks on a first-class train
surrounded by beautiful scenery, broken here and there by stopovers in
exquisitely picturesque Anatolian towns. Best of all, William Yale had
fallen into the company of Abdul Rahman Pasha al-Yusuf, a member of the
Turkish parliament and one of the wealthiest noblemen of Damascus, and
been accorded lavish hospitality as the pasha’s temporary “adopted son.”
In fact, just about the only disagreeable moments on the entire journey
had been the bedbugs at the hotel in Eskisehir and the sight of the
starving Armenian refugees massed along the rail siding in Tarsus. “It
was a sad sight to see the poor people,” Yale blandly recalled,
“uprooted from their homes, going to an unknown destination, the shadow
of a great tragedy looming over them.” If the American oilman felt any
moral uneasiness about his or his company’s role in collaborating with
the regime that was orchestrating this tragedy, he kept it to himself;
William Yale had a delicate task to perform.</p>
<p>After just a few days in the Syrian capital, he took reluctant leave
of the pasha to continue on to Jerusalem, where his first order of
business was to arrange a meeting with Djemal Pasha. With a haste rather
out of character for the Ottoman government, he soon received a summons
to the German Hospice on the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>As his horse-drawn carriage climbed the steep cobblestoned road up
the mount on the appointed day, Yale found himself growing increasingly
nervous. “I practiced the salaams and salutations I had learned on the
trip from Constantinople,” he wrote, “and wondered whether they were the
proper ones to use for such a powerful person as Djemal.”</p>
<p>Yale’s anxiety was more than just a case of starstruck jitters. He
had come to Jerusalem to secure concessionary rights to a half million
acres of Palestine for Standard Oil, and as he well knew, the success or
failure of that enterprise rested on his meeting with the Syrian
governor. He wasn’t at all sure how it might go.</p>
<p>Passing through the wrought-iron gates of the German Hospice, Yale’s
horse carriage drew to a stop before the main entrance of the
magnificent building, where liveried sentries stepped forward to help
him down. With his papers and maps, the American oilman was ushered into
the ornate main hall, then down a long stone corridor to the anteroom of
Djemal’s inner sanctum.</p>
<p>As Yale waited there, he fell into conversation with one of the
governor’s young aides, a naval attaché who spoke English. Welcoming
this distraction from his anxiety, Yale became so engrossed in their
talk that he took little notice of those coming and going from the room,
including the short uniformed man with the close-cropped black beard who
eventually emerged from a side door. It wasn’t until this man strode
briskly up to the receptionist’s desk, hopped up on one corner of it,
and fixed him with an intent stare that Yale realized it was Djemal
Pasha.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Yale,” he said in elegant French, “get your maps and
papers out and show me what you want.”</p>
<p>Djemal’s informality had the effect of instantly dissolving Yale’s
nervousness—but also of filling him with a sudden regret. At the last
minute, he had decided that asking for the entire half million acres
that Standard wanted in Palestine was simply too audacious a request to
make at this first meeting with the governor, so Yale had brought only
half his maps to the German Hospice. These he quickly spread upon the
receptionist desk and pointed out a broad swath of central Judea. Djemal
looked on, but judging by the impatient nodding of his head, he wasn’t
keen on hearing a lot of details. After just a few moments he
straightened and gave another curt nod. “Tell me what you need and I’ll
issue the necessary orders at once.”</p>
<p>It was only at that instant, Yale would later contend, that he
grasped the gulf of understanding that stood between him and the Syrian
governor. If there was oil in Palestine, Djemal Pasha naturally wanted
it found and quickly tapped so that his transport trucks could move and
his armies could fight their war. But Standard had no intention of doing
that. Instead, Yale had come to Palestine merely to buy up concessions
and put dibs on the region for Standard in the postwar era.</p>
<p>“As I look back on it now,” Yale recounted some twenty years later,
“I regret that I didn’t tell him the truth.”</p>
<p>But he didn’t. Instead, with Djemal Pasha’s support, Yale quickly
obtained the necessary official papers and organized a field expedition.
In short order, and with Turkish soldiers and local officials ensuring
the full compliance of tribal sheikhs, he had nailed down the mineral
concessionary rights to some quarter million acres of central Palestine.
His Socony superiors back in Constantinople were understandably thrilled
with the news, but apparently so was the Turkish leadership. First,
Standard had helped them skirt the British naval blockade by smuggling
oil in from Bulgaria, and now Standard was taking the further step—or so
the Turks thought—of helping them develop their own oil resources. In
late July, the regime resolved to show their gratitude to their friends
in Socony’s Constantinople office in the time-honored tradition of
empires everywhere: the bestowing of medals.</p>
<p>For more fainthearted men, the idea of accepting medals from the
Ottoman regime at that particular juncture might have given pause. The
expatriate community in Constantinople was by then awash in reports of
what was being done to the Armenians, fresh accounts almost daily of the
inhabitants of yet another village being slaughtered, of hundreds or
thousands more being starved or beaten to death during their marches
into exile. But the men of Socony hadn’t attained their positions by
mixing morality with business, or by pandering to whatever humanitarian
concern was currently in vogue. On July 28, the three senior officers of
its Constantinople branch—William Bemis, Oscar Gunkel, and Lucien I.
Thomas—were ushered into Dolmabahçe Palace for an audience with the
sultan. At that ceremony, the Socony officials were awarded the Order of
the Osmanieh, one of the highest civilian awards given by the Ottoman
Empire, for their “numerous humanitarian services.”</p>
<p>IN MID-JULY 1915, T. E. Lawrence sat down to answer a letter he had
recently received from his closest sibling, his younger brother Will. At
that time, Will was undergoing training at the Cambridge Barracks in
Portsmouth to serve as an aerial observer for the Royal Flying
Corps.</p>
<p>Given Lawrence’s almost pathological reticence to express intimacy,
it must have been especially difficult for him to turn to what had been
the thrust of Will’s letter to him: the death in May of their younger
brother, Frank. “Frank’s death was, as you say, a shock because it was
so unexpected,” he wrote. “I don’t think one can regret it overmuch,
because it is a very good way to take, after all. The hugeness of this
war has made one change one’s perspective, I think, and I for one can
hardly see details at all.”</p>
<p>In closing, though, Lawrence struck a softer, almost plaintive tone.
“I wonder when it will all end and peace follow? All the relief I get
[is] in The Greek Anthology, Heredia, Morris and a few others. Do
you?”</p>
<p>In July 1915, the war was not yet even a quarter done; there were
still more than three years of slaughter and ruin ahead. But the seeds
for Lawrence’s own dramatic role in that conflict were just then being
sown. Those seeds were born of two seemingly disparate events: the
arrival in Cairo of a strange letter secreted out of Mecca, and the
crossing of an enigmatic twenty-four-year-old man over the torn and
shell-pitted no-man’s-land of Gallipoli.</p>
<p>BY THE MIDSUMMER of 1915 on Gallipoli, so many men were dying in such
a confined space—in some spots, the opposing trenchlines were less than
thirty yards apart—that informal truces began to be called in order to
gather up the dead. The arrangements were usually worked out by local
commanders, so that at a specified time grave-digging parties from both
sides would step out into no-man’s-land and begin their ghastly
work.</p>
<p>This certainly appeared to be the intent of the Ottoman lieutenant
who, on the morning of August 20, climbed from his army’s forward trench
and, under the cover of a white flag, started across no-man’s-land.
Instead, upon reaching the British line, the young officer announced to
his startled hosts that he wished to surrender.</p>
<p>Following standard procedure, the man was bound and blindfolded and
passed down through the Med-Ex trenchworks to regimental headquarters.
If standard procedure had continued to be followed, he would have been
interrogated there by an intelligence officer, then sent on to the
central prisoner-of-war stockade before eventual transfer to a POW camp
in Cyprus or Egypt. But there was nothing at all standard about this
prisoner. His name was Mohammed al-Faroki, and despite his unassuming
appearance—he was just twenty-four and very slight—the story he told was
so remarkable that successive British officers felt their superiors
needed to hear it.</p>
<p>He claimed to be a member of a secret military society called al-Ahd
(the Awakening), comprised largely of Arab officers like himself, that
had been waiting in vain for months for the right conditions to stage a
revolt against their Turkish overseers. Rumors of shadowy fifth-column
networks inside the Ottoman Empire had become rather commonplace by that
summer, but what was different about Faroki was that he supplied a list
of his alleged al-Ahd coconspirators, most of them high-ranking
officers, complete with details on which units they commanded and where
they were currently deployed.</p>
<p>Testament to the importance given the lieutenant’s claims, on August
25, General Ian Hamilton, the overall commander of the Gallipoli
campaign, fired off a report to War Secretary Kitchener himself.
Deciding that the intelligence unit in Cairo was best equipped to judge
the truthfulness of the lieutenant’s story, London ordered Faroki put on
board a warship bound for Egypt.</p>
<p>At least initially, neither Gilbert Clayton, the overall commander of
the British military intelligence unit in Cairo, nor any of his
subordinates knew quite what to make of the young man brought to their
Savoy Hotel offices on September 10. Their attention was piqued,
however, when Faroki suggested the British had squandered a profound
military opportunity by not going ashore at Alexandretta in the spring
of 1915.</p>
<p>According to Faroki, not only had Alexandretta been guarded primarily
by Arab-conscript units at the time, with many of their commanders
committed al-Ahd members, but these units had even carefully sabotaged
the city’s defensive fortifications in anticipation of an imminent
British landing force. Those efforts had come to naught, obviously, when
the British instead launched their disastrous Gallipoli campaign. That
wasn’t the worst of it, however. Once Gallipoli started, Djemal Pasha
had swiftly sent the Arab units in Alexandretta to the battlefront; as a
result, Faroki explained, many of the would-be conspirators of al-Ahd
now lay dead on the Gallipoli hillsides, killed by the very “enemy” they
had hoped to join.</p>
<p>Up to this point, much of Faroki’s story was easy enough to verify.
The founder of al-Ahd, a man named Abdul Aziz al-Masri, was living in
exile in Cairo, and he was brought in to vouch for Faroki’s bona fides.
As for his claim that Alexandretta had been guarded by troops anxious to
mutiny, this was precisely what Lawrence had ascertained from his
interviews with Ottoman prisoners and had stressed in his lobbying for a
landing there. But Faroki had more to tell. A lot more.</p>
<p>For some time, he claimed, he had served as a kind of liaison between
al-Ahd and another Arab secret society, al-Fatat, in Damascus. From this
linking, al-Ahd had learned of the covert negotiations between al-Fatat
and Emir Hussein in Mecca toward staging a joint uprising against the
Turks. In the process, al-Ahd had also learned of the secret
correspondence between Emir Hussein and the British in Cairo. The upshot
of all this was that, if armed and supported by Britain, both Arab
secret societies, the civilian al-Fatat and the military al-Ahd, were
now prepared to join Emir Hussein in revolt against the Turks.</p>
<p>Such a partnership would come with a price, though: British
recognition of an independent Arab nation encompassing virtually the
entire Arab world, from Iraq in the east to Syria in the west and
extending down to the tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The precise
parameters of this Arab nation were open to some limited negotiation—the
would-be rebels recognized Britain’s colonial claim to Aden and its
commercial interests in southern Iraq—but the one absolute precondition
was that the French were not to have a controlling presence anywhere. If
all that was agreed to, Faroki explained, then the British could have
their revolution in the heart of the Ottoman world.</p>
<p>It was here that the young lieutenant’s story began to strain
credulity. Obviously, Faroki had learned of the secret correspondence
between Emir Hussein and Ronald Storrs from somewhere, but apparently no
one in the Cairo military intelligence unit had even heard of al-Fatat.
As for Faroki’s assertion that this cell spoke for a vast network of
anti-Ottoman conspirators in Syria, Lawrence, given his long familiarity
with the Syrian political scene, was probably in the best position to
gauge that claim’s veracity, but nothing he had gleaned either before or
during the war suggested that such an extensive network existed. Even if
it did, anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of Arab society was likely
to find the notion of the progressive military and intellectual castes
of Syria and Iraq joining in alliance with the archconservative Emir
Hussein in Mecca a bit far-fetched.</p>
<p>Except for one thing. Just weeks before Faroki came across at
Gallipoli, Hussein had ended an eight-month silence and finally sent a
new message to Ronald Storrs. Absent from this letter was Hussein’s
earlier ambivalence, as well as his sense of proportion. Now he
purported to speak for “the whole of the Arab nation,” and his demands
for cooperation with the British had ballooned beyond mere
noninterference in the Hejaz, to British recognition of independence for
practically the entire Arab world.</p>
<p>So grandiose did Storrs find Hussein’s demands—he acidly commented
that they were “far more than he has the right, the hope, or the power
to expect”—that he and Henry McMahon, the new British high commissioner
for Egypt, decided that the best response was to simply ignore them
altogether. This had been done in McMahon’s reply to Hussein, sent
shortly before Faroki’s appearance.</p>
<p>Everything changed, though, when the specifics of Hussein’s July
letter were matched up against Faroki’s September statements, for what
was immediately apparent was that their stipulations and territorial
demands almost precisely matched. Viewed in this light, Hussein’s vague
reference to “the whole of the Arab nation” took on a very different
meaning, perhaps not delusions of grandeur by the Hejazi emir but rather
an allusion to his secret partnership with the al-Fatat and al-Ahd
conspirators. It suddenly occurred to British officials in Cairo that
they might have seriously underestimated Hussein, that far more than
potentially triggering an insurrection in a remote corner of the Ottoman
Empire, the enigmatic old man in Mecca just might hold the key to the
entire Middle Eastern theater of the war.</p>
<p>But there was still more. With his customary opaqueness, Hussein had
introduced the specter of a ticking clock in his last missive, saying
that Britain had thirty days from the receipt of his letter to accept or
reject his terms, beyond which the Arabs “reserve to themselves complete
freedom of action.” Storrs and McMahon had paid little attention to this
veiled threat at the time, but as Mohammed al-Faroki now informed them,
this ultimatum was the result of a tantalizing offer recently made to
Hussein by Djemal Pasha: full Arab independence in the postwar era,
provided the Arabs lent wholehearted support to the Turkish-German war
effort in the meantime.</p>
<p>The choice before the British, then, could not have appeared more
stark: come to an agreement with Hussein and his coconspirators that
might paralyze the Ottoman Empire from within, or, conversely, watch
Hussein and the Arabs make their peace with Constantinople, a peace that
would undoubtedly result in a reinvigorated call to jihad against the
Allies, and just might be the spark to finally set the Muslim
populations of their colonies aflame. With Prime Minister Asquith and
his cabinet kept fully apprised, British diplomats in London and Cairo
scrambled to send off a new and far more respectful message to the emir
in Mecca. Thus began one of history’s most controversial exchanges of
secret messages, the so-called McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, the
ramifications of which would soon embroil the British government—as well
as its future agent in Arabia, T. E. Lawrence—in a complex web of
misunderstandings, conflicting promises, and deceit.</p>
<p>In the short term, the revelations of Mohammed al-Faroki enabled
Lawrence to return to the goal that had consumed him ever since arriving
in Cairo nine months earlier: a British landing at Alexandretta.</p>
<p>FROM THE ATHLIT promontory on clear days, Aaron Aaronsohn and Absalom
Feinberg could easily make out the British and French warships that
trolled the Palestinian coastline, imposing their blockade. It would be
off one of these warships, they’d assumed, that they would eventually
receive a message from Alex in Cairo—perhaps delivered by Alex himself.
As the days and weeks passed, however, their confidence in this
wavered.</p>
<p>After nearly a month with no word, Aaronsohn and Feinberg settled on
a risky backup plan. If the wait lasted much longer, Feinberg would take
one of the small fishing boats that plied the coast, head straight out
for one of the blockade ships, and try to talk his way on board. In
mid-August, though, word came that the blockade was being tightened, the
Allied warships now given license to destroy on sight any vessel they
deemed suspicious; since this criterion surely attached to a strange
vessel trying to make an approach, it rendered the backup plan less a
risky venture than a suicidal one. Then came more bad news. In late
August, it was announced (erroneously, it would turn out) that the
refugee boatlift was coming to an end, that USS Des Moines would be
making just one more call at Haifa harbor on August 30. When that
American warship sailed over the horizon, the conspirators believed, so
too would their last best chance to make contact with the British.</p>
<p>To Feinberg’s urging that he go out on the ship, Aaronsohn stoutly
refused. Instead, it was Feinberg, in disguise and carrying a forged
Russian passport, who talked his way aboard the Des Moines. A week
later, he found himself on the docks of Alexandria, Egypt.</p>
<p>Feinberg had just one contact in Egypt, but it turned out to be a
good one: a young Christian Arab originally from Haifa who was now
working as a courier for the British naval intelligence headquarters at
Port Said. In Port Said, Feinberg tracked down his old friend, who
quickly arranged a meeting with one of the unit’s intelligence officers.
That officer happened to be T. E. Lawrence’s old partner at Carchemish
as well as on the Zin expedition, Leonard Woolley.</p>
<p>What Feinberg didn’t know—could not have known—was that Alex
Aaronsohn had in fact made contact with British intelligence in Egypt.
After a series of rebuffs, he’d finally gained an audience with a senior
member of the military intelligence staff in Cairo on August 18. That
officer had been T. E. Lawrence’s other partner on the Zin expedition,
Captain Stewart Newcombe. But that meeting had not gone at all well.
Newcombe had taken a wary view of Alex Aaronsohn from the start, and
that wariness only deepened when the earnest twenty-six-year-old began
detailing the Jewish spy network supposedly standing by in Palestine to
aid the British. It had been just two months since Minna Weizmann, Curt
Prüfer’s protégée, was unmasked as a spy, and British intelligence
agents in Egypt were now alerted to the German scheme of employing
Jewish refugees from Palestine as conduits. But perhaps what most
aroused Newcombe’s suspicion was that Alex Aaronsohn appeared to want
nothing tangible in return for his services. As a senior intelligence
officer, Newcombe was constantly besieged by self-proclaimed spies who,
in return for their “valuable information,” wanted money or weapons or
help with legal problems; it simply didn’t gibe that Alex Aaronsohn was
offering up this purported treasure trove of information out of the
goodness of his heart. As a result, and in what was surely one of the
greatest miscalculations of his intelligence career, Newcombe had not
only rebuffed Aaronsohn’s offer, but ordered him from the country. Of
course, Alex had no way of communicating any of this to his brother
anxiously waiting back in Palestine; on September 3, just three days
before Absalom Feinberg arrived in Alexandria, Alex and his sister Rivka
had gone out of that same harbor on a ship bound for New York.</p>
<p>But Feinberg was to have much better luck with Leonard Woolley.
Implicitly trusting the intense young man who had been brought before
him, Woolley devised a system whereby a British spy ship might
periodically troll past the research station in Athlit. Through a
prearranged series of codes, the conspirators would signal out to the
spy ship when there was information to be collected, and under the cover
of darkness, either a small boat or a swimmer would be sent ashore to
retrieve it.</p>
<p>There was only one way to both establish the coding system and test
the efficacy of this plan: by sneaking Feinberg back into Palestine
aboard one of the spy ships. After concluding his arrangements with
Woolley, Feinberg waited for the right conditions—a calm sea, a moonless
night—for his voyage home.</p>
<p>ONE PERSON WHO knew nothing of Newcombe’s and Woolley’s dealings with
the would-be spies from Palestine that late summer was their former Zin
expedition partner, T. E. Lawrence. This was partly due to the
compartmentalization policy adhered to by British intelligence in Egypt,
and partly to Lawrence’s intense focus on one issue: a British landing
at Alexandretta. By mid-October, the last pieces of that plan appeared
to be falling into place, and the letter he penned to his parents
strived for that delicate balance between excitement and sufficient
obliqueness to get past the military censors:</p>
<p>“There is going to be a rather busy winter in the Levant,” he wrote.
“I am pleased on the whole with things. They have gone against us so far
that our Government has become more reasonable, and the final settlement
out here, though it will take long, will I think, be very satisfactory.
We have to thank our [past] failures for that.”</p>
<p>For Lawrence, the most excruciating aspect of Faroki’s story was his
description of the situation that had existed in Alexandretta in the
winter of 1915, carrying as it did the suggestion that a British landing
force might have practically strolled ashore there. Obviously,
circumstances were much changed now, the al-Ahd-dominated military units
long since moved elsewhere, but in the autumn of 1915, Lawrence and
other advocates of an Alexandretta landing could point to several new
factors that made their argument nearly as compelling.</p>
<p>Having sat out the first year of the war, Bulgaria had finally come
in on the side of the Central Powers in late September. This meant the
enemy now had an unbroken land route and rail line connecting Germany to
Turkey, allowing for the quick and easy transfer of troops and weaponry.
At the same time, British war planners, finally accepting Gallipoli for
the fiasco it had been all along, were quietly drawing up plans for a
withdrawal. Taken together, these two developments meant British Egypt
was likely to be targeted anew, and by a much-better-equipped enemy. To
hamper such an offensive, taking control of the Alexandretta Basin would
not merely disrupt the enemy’s main supply line, but sever it—and if
that action did in fact spark a regional Arab uprising, the Turks would
have a whole new set of problems to deal with.</p>
<p>Another new factor argued for Alexandretta, one for which the
mercurial personality of Djemal Pasha could be thanked. In tacit
opposition to his co-pashas in Constantinople, Djemal had given refuge
to at least eighty thousand Armenian survivors of the Anatolian killing
fields, and had organized many of the Armenian men into labor
battalions. These refugees and labor battalions were concentrated in the
Alexandretta region—some eight thousand had been put to work on the
railroad tunnels being cut through the Amanus and Taurus Mountains—and
even if they might be grateful to the pasha who had at least temporarily
saved their lives, this Armenian population would most certainly regard
arriving British soldiers as liberators and rush to their side.
Attending that, of course, would be the public relations coup—an aspect
of war Lawrence was always sensitive to—of Britain freeing untold
thousands of Christian Armenians from servitude or death.</p>
<p>Through the strenuous lobbying of Lawrence and other members of the
Cairo military intelligence staff, by late October the two most
important British officials in Egypt—High Commissioner Henry McMahon and
Major General John Maxwell, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force—had been won over to the revived Alexandretta scheme. Better yet,
these two men were about to hold a summit meeting with a visiting Lord
Kitchener to decide the future course of the war in the eastern
Mediterranean. The stars were finally aligning, so much so that Lawrence
felt confident the seemingly impregnable walls of military idiocy were
about to be breached.</p>
<p>“Things are boiling over this weekend,” Lawrence wrote to a friend on
November 4, on the eve of the Kitchener summit meeting, “and we have
never been so busy before! This is a good omen, and a thing to make one
very content.”</p>
<p>The meeting between Kitchener, McMahon, and Maxwell took place on a
ship off the Aegean island of Mudros on November 10 and 11. After an
initial reluctance, the war secretary, too, came to embrace the
Alexandretta plan, and fired off a cable to the prime minister urging
its immediate approval.</p>
<p>But in London the idea had a more mixed reception. Amid the
continuing carnage on the Western Front, the British high command was
already struggling to find enough new men to throw into that meat
grinder, and the notion of siphoning off matériel and soldiers—the
revised Alexandretta plan now called for as many as 100,000 troops—was a
difficult sell. Additionally, the misadventure at Gallipoli was hardly
an advertisement for the wisdom of new amphibious landings on the
Ottoman Front. In a flurry of cables passed between Kitchener’s ship and
various ministries in London, a debate ensued.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment, a French liaison officer attached to
Kitchener’s shipboard retinue decided the matter, firing off a cable to
Paris alerting his government to the British deliberations.</p>
<p>Having been under the impression that they had killed off the
Alexandretta scheme back in the winter of 1915, the French government
now felt compelled to do so in more explicit form. On November 13, the
French military attaché in London handed a letter to General William
Robertson, the chief of the British Imperial General Staff and overall
commander of the British army. After reasserting France’s economic and
political interests in Syria, the letter stated that “French public
opinion could not be indifferent to anything that would be attempted in
a country that they consider already as being intended to become a part
of the future [French-controlled] Syria; and they would require of the
French Government that not only could no military operation be
undertaken in this particular country before it has been concerted
between the Allies, but even that, should such an action be taken, the
greater part of the task should be entrusted to the French troops and
the Generals commanding them.”</p>
<p>Its obtuse diplomatic language aside, the letter essentially repeated
France’s earlier objections to an Alexandretta landing: since France
intended to take over Syria after the war, French forces needed to be in
the vanguard of any military operation in the area, and since no French
troops could currently be spared for such a mission, that precluded any
mission being conducted at all. What was shocking this time around,
though, was that the French would actually commit such a squalid
argument to paper. British historian Basil Liddell Hart wrote of the
French directive that “this must surely be one of the most astounding
documents ever presented to an Ally when engaged in a life and death
struggle. For it imposed what was really a veto on the best opportunity
of cutting the common enemy’s life-line and of protecting our own.” By
acquiescing to such an outrage, Liddell Hart contended, the British
General Staff were essentially “accessories to the crime,” that crime
being that the British in Egypt had now been given no alternative but to
await another assault on the Suez Canal, and to then launch their own
attack against the very strongest point of the Turkish line—the narrow
front of southern Palestine—an approach that was to ultimately cost them
fifty thousand more casualties.</p>
<p>To the disbelief of Lawrence and others on the intelligence staff in
Cairo, the Alexandretta plan was quashed anew, never to seriously be
raised again.</p>
<p>Back in February 1915, when the plan had first been scuttled,
Lawrence had bitterly suggested to his family that France was the true
enemy in Syria. In the wake of the second scuttling in November 1915 was
born an enmity that would cause him to view all future French actions in
the region with utter distrust.</p>
<p>SOON AFTER THE death of her son Frank, Sarah Lawrence had chided her
second son, “Ned,” for something that clearly remained a sore point: his
failure to visit Frank at his military boot camp in late 1914, prior to
Ned’s departure for Egypt. T. E. Lawrence had responded to his mother’s
criticism with a logic so matter-of-fact as to border on the perverse.
“I didn’t go say goodbye to Frank,” he explained, “because he would
rather I didn’t, and I knew there was little chance of my seeing him
again; in which case, we were better without a parting.”</p>
<p>Lawrence had responded very differently in March 1915 when he learned
that the ship transporting his brother Will back to England from India
was passing through the Suez Canal. Not having seen Will since his visit
to Carchemish in 1913, Lawrence had briefly put aside his work at the
Savoy Hotel, mounted his Triumph motorcycle, and raced the eighty miles
out to Port Suez to meet his brother’s ship when it docked.</p>
<p>Just before he got there, however, a skirmish broke out somewhere
along the canal, delaying Will’s ship. Instead of a face-to-face
meeting, all the brothers were able to arrange was a brief ship-to-shore
telephone conversation. That same evening, Lawrence remounted his
motorcycle and returned to his work in Cairo.</p>
<p>In volunteering to serve as an aerial spotter for the Royal Flying
Corps, Will had chosen a position that came with one of the shortest
life expectancies for any soldier in World War I. On October 23, 1915,
Will was killed when his plane was shot down over France, his body never
recovered. He was twenty-six years old, and had been at the front for
less than a week.</p>
<p>The effect of losing two brothers in just five months seemed to draw
Lawrence even deeper into his emotional shell. For the next several
months, his letters home grew steadily more infrequent and terse.
Indeed, while he had quickly dropped nearly all mention of Frank in
writing to his parents, there is no record of his even acknowledging
Will’s death at the time, save for one oblique allusion. It was in a
short note he sent home that December:</p>
<p>I’m writing just a few words this morning, because it has surprised
me by being Christmas day. I’m afraid that for you it will be no very
happy day; however you have still Bob and Arnie left at home, which is
far more than many people can have. Look forward all the time.
Everything here is as usual, only we had a shower of rain yesterday, and
it has been cool lately.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-7-treachery">Chapter 7 Treachery</h4>
<p>It seems to me that we are rather in the position of the hunters who
divided up the skin of the bear before they had killed it. I personally
cannot foresee the situation in which we may find ourselves at the end
of the war, and I therefore think that any discussion at the present
time of how we are going to cut up the Turkish Empire is chiefly of
academic interest.</p>
<p>BRITISH GENERAL GEORGE MACDONOGH, DIRECTOR OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE,
JANUARY 7, 1916</p>
<p>On November 16, 1915, T. E. Lawrence penned a note to an old friend,
Edward Leeds, one of the Ashmolean curators back in Oxford. It had been
just three weeks since the death of his brother Will, and Lawrence was
in a forlorn mood. After apologizing for his long silence, he told Leeds
it was partly due to the demands of his job, “and partly because I’m
rather low because first one and now another of my brothers has been
killed. Of course, I’ve been away a lot from them, and so it doesn’t
come on one like a shock at all, but I rather dread Oxford and what it
may be like if one comes back. Also they were both younger than I am,
and it doesn’t seem right, somehow, that I should go on living
peacefully in Cairo.”</p>
<p>If war is an inherently confounding experience, Lawrence could be
forgiven that November for finding his particularly so. In the eleven
months since he had arrived in Cairo, he had been largely confined to a
suite of offices in the Savoy Hotel, a world away from the Western Front
killing fields that had taken the lives of his brothers. Even more
bewildering, he had expended his greatest energies not on battling the
enemy, but engaged in “paper-combat” against the parochial interests of
Britain’s military bureaucracy and those of its closest ally,
France.</p>
<p>The uselessness of those struggles was plain to see on the great map
of the Ottoman Empire tacked to the wall of the Savoy offices. In
November 1915, after a year of war in that theater and the deaths of
hundreds of thousands, the map remained virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>In Gallipoli, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force still clung to
their blood-soaked beachheads, but even those tiny toeholds in Turkey
were soon to disappear; in a cruel irony, the Allied withdrawal from
Gallipoli, just then about to get under way, was to be the only
well-executed phase of the entire campaign. In Anatolia, the suffering
of the Armenians continued unabated, and was now being joined by that of
the would-be Arab secessionists in Syria, their leadership decimated by
Djemal Pasha’s secret police. A landing in Alexandretta that might have
aided both groups now seemed a dead issue, even if for reasons no one in
Cairo could quite discern (it would still be some weeks before the
London War Office got around to informing Egypt of the French
government’s formal spiking of the plan). In its stead, there was now
growing talk of a conventional frontal assault against the entrenched
Turkish forces at the far end of the Sinai in Palestine. Should that
offensive be successful—and the example of Gallipoli offered scant
reason to think it would—the British army would then be consigned to a
long, slow grind north toward the Turkish heartland. Just about the only
bright spot anywhere on that map was in Iraq. There, a British Indian
army had steadily advanced up the Tigris River over the past seven
months, and by mid-November stood at the gates of Baghdad. Even if that
city at the Ottoman periphery were taken, however, it was hard to see
its material effect on Constantinople, a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>Almost by default, then, Lawrence had increasingly looked to Arabia
as the one place left that afforded a ray of hope, where the
unconventional war he was convinced was needed to defeat the Turks might
be waged. This hope had been given new vigor just days earlier. In the
wake of Mohammed al-Faroki’s revelations, the British high commissioner
in Egypt, Henry McMahon, had rushed off a new letter to Emir Hussein
acceding to nearly all his territorial demands for an independent Arab
nation in payment for a British-allied Arab revolt. On November 5, an
equally accommodating reply had come in to Cairo from Hussein. A few
smaller points still needed to be worked out, but there was now a broad
agreement in place for an Arab uprising against Turkey.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence could possibly have imagined that this truly
resolved matters. To the contrary, a perverse mind-set had settled in
among the warring European powers by that autumn of 1915, one that
suggested the situation in the Middle East was about to become far more
complicated and contentious.</p>
<p>To understand this mind-set, one had to appreciate the paralysis that
held over the larger map of the war. On the Western Front, the
four-hundred-mile-long strip of no-man’s-land separating the French and
British armies from those of the Germans had barely moved in a year.
While much less static, a different kind of stalemate had set in on the
Eastern Front. There, after being mauled by German forces on its
northwestern frontier in the first days of the war, Russia had taken
revenge on the hapless Austro-Hungarian armies on its southwestern, only
to be mauled anew when Germany came to Austria-Hungary’s rescue. It
established a deadly pattern—Russian success against Austria-Hungary
negated by German success against Russia—that would continue into 1917.
For sheer mindless futility, though, it was hard to compete with the
newly opened Southern Front in northeastern Italy. Having belatedly
joined the war on the side of the Entente, by November 1915 Italy had
already flung its army four times against a vastly outnumbered
Austro-Hungarian force commanding the heights of a rugged mountain
valley, only to be slaughtered each time; before war’s end, there would
be twelve battles in the Isonzo valley, resulting in some 600,000
Italian casualties.</p>
<p>Of course, stasis is a two-way street, and if this broader map
yielded no good news for the Entente, the same held true for the Central
Powers.</p>
<p>Given this stunning lack of progress earned at such horrific cost, it
might seem reasonable to imagine that the thoughts of the various
warring nations would now turn toward peace, to trying to find some way
out of the mess. Instead, precisely the opposite was happening.</p>
<p>It’s a question that has faced peoples and nations at war since the
beginning of time, and usually produced a terrible answer: in
contemplating all the lives already lost, the treasure squandered, how
to ever admit it was for nothing? Since such an admission is
unthinkable, and the status quo untenable, the only option left is to
escalate. Thus among the warring states in Europe at the end of 1915 it
was no longer a matter of satisfying what had brought them into the
conflict in the first place—and in many cases, those reasons had been
shockingly trivial—but to expand beyond them, the acceptable terms for
peace not lowered, but raised. This conflict was no longer about playing
for small advantage against one’s imperial rivals, but about hobbling
them forever, ensuring that they might never again have the capability
to wage such a devastating and pointless war.</p>
<p>But defeating one’s enemies is only half the game; for a war to be
truly justifiable one has to materially gain. In modern European custom,
that need had been sated by the payment of war reparations into the
victor’s coffers, the grabbing of a disputed province here or there, but
that seemed rather picayune in view of this conflict’s cost. Instead,
all the slaughter was to be justified by a new golden age of empire, the
victors far richer, far grander than before. Naturally, this simply
propelled the cycle to its logical, murderous conclusion. When
contemplating all to be conferred upon the eventual winners, and all to
be taken from the losers, how to possibly quit now? No, what was
required was greater commitment—more soldiers, more money, more loss—to
be redeemed when victory finally came with more territory, more wealth,
more power.</p>
<p>While the Central Powers had their own imperial wish list in the
event of victory, one that also grew more grandiose as time went on, for
the Entente powers of Great Britain, France, and Russia there really was
only one place that offered the prospect of redemption on the scale
required: the fractured and varied lands of the Ottoman Empire. Indeed,
by the autumn of 1915 that empire was now often referred to by cynics in
the Entente capitals simply as “the Great Loot.”</p>
<p>For all three powers, the war in the Middle East was now to become
about satisfying the imperial cravings—desiderata, as it was politely
known—they had long harbored. The czars of Russia had been angling to
grab Constantinople for at least two hundred years. Similarly, France
had enjoyed a special status as protector of the Ottoman Empire’s
Catholic population in Syria since the sixteenth century; if that empire
was to be dismantled, then that region should rightly go to her. For its
part, Britain had long been obsessed with protecting the land approaches
to India, its “jewel in the crown,” from encroachment by its imperial
rivals— paradoxically, Russia and France foremost among them. Then there
was the religion factor. All three of the principal Entente powers were
devoutly Christian nations in 1915, and even after six hundred years it
still grated many that the Christian Holy Land lay in Muslim hands. In
carving up the Ottoman Empire there was finally the chance to replay the
Crusades to a happier ending.</p>
<p>What probably most propelled these old desires into the realm of
possibility were the secret negotiations between Britain and Emir
Hussein. As those negotiations became less secret among the Allies, and
the prospect of an Arab revolt more real, it produced not so much a
piquing of imperial appetites as a mighty collective slavering.</p>
<p>By late November, France, tipped to Britain’s dealings with Hussein
and anxious to stake its claim, would hastily compile its own ambitious
set of desiderata for the region. French demands would soon be joined by
those of Russia. Confronted by the gluttonous wishes of its principal
allies—allies today perhaps, but probably rivals again tomorrow—Britain
would suddenly decide that it too was in an acquisitive mood, and never
mind the promises it had so recently made to Hussein. Maneuvering for
their own spot at the feeding trough would ultimately come Italy and
even neutral Greece. All of this would quickly make military
considerations in the Middle East subordinate to political ones, and
move the decision-making process away from military officers in the
field to diplomats and politicians huddled in staterooms. If the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the former had been their ineptitude,
at least their intent had been clear; with the rise of the statesmen,
and with different power blocs jockeying for advantage, all was about to
become shrouded in treachery and byzantine maneuver.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the man who was to play a singular role in generating
that intrigue arrived in Cairo on November 17, 1915, just the day after
Lawrence had complained to Edward Leeds of his peaceful life there. His
name was Mark Sykes—or, more formally, Sir Tatton Benvenuto Mark Sykes,
6th Baronet of Sledmere.</p>
<p>Few people in history have so heedlessly caused so much tragedy. At
the age of thirty-six, the handsome if slightly doughy Sykes epitomized
that remarkable subclass of British aristocrats of the late imperial age
known as the “Amateurs.” Despite its somewhat derogatory modern
connotation, the term derives from the Latin “for the love of,” and in
this context denoted a select group of wealthy and usually titled young
men whose breeding, education, and freedom from careerist pressures—it
was considered terribly déclassé for such men to hold down bona fide
jobs—allowed them to dabble over a broad range of interests and find all
doors flung open to them. Raised on a thirty-thousand-acre ancestral
estate as the only child of a Yorkshire aristocrat, Sykes, like so many
of his fellow Amateurs, seemed intent on living the lives of ten
“ordinary” men. Educated at Cambridge, he had traveled extensively
throughout the Ottoman Empire, authored four books, been a soldier in
the Boer War, served as parliamentary secretary to the chief
administrator of Ireland and honorary attaché to the British embassy in
Constantinople—and those were just the highlights up to the age of
twenty-five. In the succeeding eleven years before his arrival in Cairo
that autumn, he had married and had sired five children—a sixth would
soon be on the way—won a reputation as an accomplished caricaturist,
invented an early version of the overhead projector and, since 1912,
served as the Conservative member of Parliament for Hull Central.</p>
<p>Sykes’s appearance in Cairo was a result of the most recent addition
to his résumé. The previous spring, Lord Kitchener had appointed him as
an advisor to the de Bunsen Committee, an interdepartmental government
board designed to guide the British cabinet on Middle Eastern affairs.
Unsurprisingly, Sykes had quickly emerged as the dominant member of that
committee, and in July 1915 set out on an extended fact-finding mission
to the region with the intention of imparting his firsthand impressions
to the cabinet upon his return.</p>
<p>Lawrence and Sykes first met that August, during Sykes’s stopover in
Cairo on the outgoing leg of his fact-finding mission. Like most
everyone else, Lawrence took a quick liking to the charming and
personable MP. He and others in the Cairo intelligence staff were also
gratified to finally find someone in the senior branches of the British
government who appeared to appreciate their ideas for unconventional
warfare. That estimate was initially fortified upon Sykes’s return to
Egypt in November; he had spent the previous two months meeting with
officials in British India, a group vehemently opposed to the
war-by-proxy plots emanating out of British Egypt, and the returned
Sykes made no secret that his sympathies lay with the Egyptian
approach.</p>
<p>Yet for all his astounding achievements, Mark Sykes exemplified
another characteristic common among the British ruling class of the
Edwardian age, a breezy arrogance that held that most of the world’s
messy problems were capable of neat solution, that the British had the
answers to many of them, and that it was their special burden—no less
tiresome for being God-given—to enlighten the rest of humanity to that
fact. Sykes’s special skill in this regard was a talent for bold and
refreshingly concise writing, the ability to break down complex issues
into neat bulleted-point formulas that provided the illusion of almost
mathematical simplicity. He was a master of the PowerPoint presentation
nearly a century before it existed.</p>
<p>One example—there were to be many more in the years just ahead—was an
analysis he composed during his August stopover in Cairo that purported
to chart the various intellectual elements at work in the Middle East.
After first dividing those elements between the “Ancients” and the
“Moderns,” Sykes offered up subcategories. Thus, Class I of the Ancients
were the orthodox (“hard, unyielding, bigoted and fanatical”), while
Class I of the Moderns (“the highest type”) denoted “a person of good
family who has entirely absorbed a Western education,” not to be
confused with the Class II Moderns, who were “the poor, incompetent, or
criminal who have received an inferior European education and whose
minds by circumstances or temperament or both are driven into more
sinister channels than the first class.” Not content to end there, Sykes
proceeded to apply his formula to various regions of the Middle East,
offering his British readers an easy-to-follow guide to their nation’s
standing in each. It was not a pretty picture in a place like Egypt,
frankly: from the Class I, II, and III Ancients, absolute hostility,
benevolent apathy, and mild approval, respectively, joined to
constitutional opposition and unforgiving enmity among the Class I and
II Moderns.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t the first time such silly racialist formulas had
been put to paper, but it spoke volumes to the British leadership’s own
smugness—as well, no doubt, to their perpetually harried states in
grappling with a conflict that spanned the globe—that such drivel, well
organized and confidently stated, took on the flavor of wisdom. Upon
Sykes’s return to London and a bravura performance before the de Bunsen
Committee, the British government would essentially hand off to the
thirty-six-year-old Amateur one of the thorniest—and from a historical
standpoint, most profoundly important—assignments of World War I:
sorting out the competing territorial claims of Great Britain and her
allies in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Only belatedly would British leaders recognize another aspect of
Sykes’s character, one that might have given them pause had they spotted
it earlier. Perhaps to be expected given his frenetic pace and catholic
range of interests, Mark Sykes had a very hard time keeping his facts,
even his own beliefs, straight. Impressed by the last person he had
spoken with, or the last idea that had popped into his fecund mind, he
was forever contradicting positions or policies he had advocated
earlier—often mere days earlier.</p>
<p>Lawrence began to get a glimmer of this in the time he spent around
Sykes during that November stopover. There was something altogether
disquieting about the cavalier way the young MP disregarded inconvenient
evidence that didn’t fit his currently held view, often only to seize on
that same evidence when his opinion changed. As Lawrence would later
write in Seven Pillars, Sykes was “the imaginative advocate of
unconvincing world movements … a bundle of prejudices, intuitions,
half-sciences. His ideas were of the outside, and he lacked patience to
test his materials before choosing his style of building. He would take
an aspect of the truth, detach it from its circumstances, inflate it,
twist and model it.”</p>
<p>But there was yet another side to Sykes’s personality that boded ill
for the crucial role he was about to assume. It seems the man was
something of a sneak. Whether due to a need to prove he was always the
cleverest person in the room, or a con man’s desire to get one over
simply for the sport of it, the young Amateur would make an art form out
of bending the truth to suit his needs, of playing one side against
another by withholding or manipulating crucial information. The result
would be a most peculiar place in history for Mark Sykes: it’s hard to
think of any figure who, with no true malice intended and neither a
nation nor an army at his disposal, was to wreak more havoc on the
twentieth century than the personable and brilliant young aristocrat
from Yorkshire, havoc that a small group of his countrymen, including T.
E. Lawrence, would try very hard to set right.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to suggest that Sykes uniquely possessed these traits.
Indeed, when it came to duplicity, the Amateur had a lot of very
accomplished competitors in the Middle East just then.</p>
<p>AT THE SAME time that Sykes was holding court in Cairo, an enigmatic
robed figure was circulating through the bazaars and teahouses of a
number of towns in western Syria. He was an exceedingly soft-spoken man
in his midthirties, well-off and cultured, judging by the quality of his
dress and classic Arabic diction. Because of his pale complexion and
blue eyes, most who encountered him probably took the traveler for a
Circassian, that ancient mountain people originally from the Black Sea
region, many of whom have almost Nordic features. This was a
misconception Curt Prüfer likely made no effort to correct. He was
conducting this clandestine mission at the behest of Djemal Pasha. Its
purpose was to find out where the real sympathies of the people of Syria
lay.</p>
<p>By that autumn, the need for an unbiased assessment of Syrian public
opinion was becoming acute both for the governor and his German
advisors. With the Allied misadventure in Gallipoli showing signs of
winding down, there was once again the threat of an enemy landing
somewhere on the Syrian coast. If the Allies put ashore in Lebanon, how
would the Lebanese Christians and the Druze religious minority respond?
And what of the Jews, centered just below in Palestine? With the
persecution of the Armenians in Anatolia continuing unabated, surely
many in Syria’s Jewish community were worried they might be next. Above
all, what of the Arabs? Djemal Pasha had already begun to move against
the Arab conspirators unmasked in the French consulate documents, and
Emir Hussein in Mecca was a continuing source of concern, but what of
the great masses of Arabs elsewhere?</p>
<p>For five weeks, and assuming a variety of personas and disguises,
Prüfer wandered Syria. Along the way he talked with Jewish colonists,
Arab shopkeepers, and Christian landowners, with westernized aristocrats
and Bedouin sheikhs and fellaheen. By early December 1915, the German
spy felt he’d sufficiently taken the nation’s pulse to report his
findings to Djemal and the German embassy in Constantinople.</p>
<p>In brief, he had found the greatest discontent among the Christians,
nearly all of whom, he believed, secretly sympathized with the Entente
powers. But Prüfer saw little real danger here, both because of the
Syrian Christians’ comparatively small numbers and because their
“aptitude for treason” was surpassed by a “cowardice that prevents them
from trying to realize their dreams.”</p>
<p>Of somewhat greater concern, in his estimation, was the Jewish
population, and specifically of that subgroup among them known as the
Zionists. While “official Zionism says it only wants to create in
Palestine a center for Jewish language and civilization, and is not at
all interested in politics,” Prüfer wrote, this was clearly not true.
Rather, their ultimate aim was to create an autonomous Jewish state in
Palestine, a goal far more likely to be achieved by an Entente victory
than a Central Powers one. Still, and for much the same reasons as with
the Christians, Prüfer saw little cause for alarm: “Being by nature
cowardly and without initiative, the Jews will not dare to commit
subversive acts unless an armed enemy force was already in the
country.”</p>
<p>Most heartening was what the German spy had discerned in the Arab
Muslim community, by far the largest of the three. Partly due to the
“fair and severe” measures Djemal had already conducted against those
Arab leaders suspected of secessionist leanings, Prüfer found the Arab
independence movement in a greatly weakened state. “Among the middle
classes, reformism has barely any supporters,” he wrote, “and among the
small landowners, merchants and workers, who constitute the bulk of the
population, the government and its cause seems to be popular.” Even if
an Arab uprising was somehow launched, Prüfer suggested in his usual
trenchant way, it would receive little mass support “due to the
frivolousness of the population.”</p>
<p>This generally rosy assessment came with a major caveat, however; if
the British did put ashore in Syria, latent sympathies would come to the
fore. In that eventuality, the invaders could certainly find willing
local collaborators. Prüfer provided Djemal with a long list of the
names of “unreliables,” mostly prominent Christian and Muslim Arab
businessmen, as well as “all Zionist party chiefs,” who should be
immediately sent into internal exile in the case of an Allied
landing.</p>
<p>This last suggestion triggered alarm within the German embassy. Just
that August, Djemal had made use of the documents seized from the French
consulate in Beirut to execute eleven prominent Arab leaders in one of
the city’s main squares. That event had stirred outrage in the Arab
world, and Germany certainly didn’t need one of its own intelligence
officers providing the Syrian governor with more names for his hit list.
In forwarding the report to the foreign ministry in Berlin, the German
ambassador in Constantinople noted that he’d given Prüfer the following
warning: “At the slightest indiscretion, the population could raise the
charge that we are causing rigorous measures, like expulsions. In the
future, please couch your suggestions to Djemal of this nature with
cautious restraint.”</p>
<p>That admonition may have come too late. With Prüfer’s report already
in hand, the Syrian governor seemed to conclude that his flexible
approach to problem-solving—alternating between the rose and the dagger
without readily discernible pattern—was the best way to outwit his
growing list of enemies. On December 18, he had ordered a much larger
roundup of those implicated in the French consulate files, a dragnet
ultimately ensnaring some sixty members of the Arab intelligentsia of
Beirut and Damascus.</p>
<p>Perhaps those arrests put Djemal in a happier mood, for he showed far
greater magnanimity when another man of increasingly questionable
loyalty, Aaron Aaronsohn, came calling at his Damascus office in
January.</p>
<p>THE SPY SHIP NEVER came.</p>
<p>On the moonless night of November 8, 1915, Absalom Feinberg had
finally been slipped back ashore at Athlit from a British spy ship, and
had immediately given an ecstatic Aaron Aaronsohn the good news: he’d
made contact, the British eagerly awaited whatever intelligence they
could pass on, and arrangements were now in place to make that
happen.</p>
<p>With the spy ship scheduled to return in two weeks, the two men
immediately set out on long-range reconnaissance missions to update
their information, Aaronsohn heading north, Feinberg to the south. Under
the guise of conducting scientific surveys for the agricultural research
station, they surreptitiously noted the location of new Turkish army
camps and supply depots and trenchworks, tracked the movements of trains
and troop formations, meticulously jotted down in tiny script in their
notebooks most anything they thought might be useful to the British.</p>
<p>But when they returned to Athlit and waited on the appointed night,
the spy ship didn’t come, nor on the next night, or the one after. As
their wait dragged into early December, Aaronsohn and Feinberg grew
increasingly puzzled, and then anxious; obviously, something somewhere
had gone wrong, but the longer their wait extended, the more likely
their nocturnal activities would come to the attention of the Turkish
militia’s night patrols. On the other hand, if they relaxed their vigil
and missed the boat’s appearance, the British might conclude that the
conspirators had backed out or been caught and simply give up.</p>
<p>Despairing of the spy ship ever showing, by December 8, the impetuous
Feinberg had come up with a new plan: he would reestablish contact by
somehow maneuvering his way past the Turkish armies massed in southern
Palestine, then cross over the Sinai no-man’s-land to the British lines
at the far end. If stopped by a Turkish patrol, he would claim to be
doing fieldwork on locusts. That alibi had the benefit of credence. Just
days earlier, a great new swarm of locusts had appeared over Judea, the
first since the previous spring, and Aaronsohn had determined they were
coming from Egypt over the Sinai land bridge. It still seemed a terribly
risky venture, but, consumed by his own anxieties over reaching the
British, Aaronsohn relented; Feinberg set out for the south that very
night.</p>
<p>Soon after there came anxiety of a very different sort. In
Constantinople, Aaronsohn’s younger sister Sarah had for some time been
looking for a way to escape her unhappy marriage and return to her
family in Palestine. In mid-November, with her husband away on an
extended business trip, she found her opening upon hearing that a Jewish
relief official would soon be departing Constantinople for a tour of the
Jewish colonies. Pleading to be taken along, on November 26, the
twenty-five-year-old Sarah boarded a train at Haidar Pasha station and
set off on the long journey home.</p>
<p>Dark rumors had abounded for months of what was happening to the
Armenians in the Anatolian countryside, but the combination of poor
communications and rigorous censorship had enabled the Ottoman regime to
conceal the extent of the brutality from the general population to a
fairly remarkable degree. This didn’t apply, of course, to anyone whose
travels took them through the killing fields. By the time Sarah
Aaronsohn was reunited with her brother in Palestine on December 16, she
was in a state of shock over what she had witnessed during her journey.
The agronomist would later recount that “she saw the bodies of hundreds
of Armenian men, women and children lying on both sides of the railway.
Sometimes Turkish women were seen searching the corpses for anything
that might be of value; at other times dogs were observed feeding on the
bodies. There were hundreds of bleached skeletons.” In the grisliest
incident, Sarah claimed she had watched as her train was besieged by
thousands of starving Armenians at one remote station; in the stampede,
dozens fell beneath the wheels of the train, much to the delight of its
conductor. Sarah fainted away at the spectacle, only to be remonstrated
by two Turkish officers when she came to for her evident lack of
patriotism.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn had long heard the Armenian horror stories on his own
travels, but had tended to discount them as part of the eternal Syrian
rumor mill. To have them confirmed by his sister—and to learn the
slaughter was ongoing—made it all hideously real. It also led the
agronomist inexorably to a grim question: who next? If the Young Turks
could perpetrate this atrocity against the nation’s two million
Armenians, how much easier to do the same to its eighty thousand
Jews?</p>
<p>Then came more bad news. In the Sinai, Absalom Feinberg had been
stopped by a Turkish army patrol not at all impressed by his locust
fieldwork cover story. Instead, they had hauled him back to Beersheva
under suspicion of being a spy. In early January, he was transferred to
the prison in Jerusalem to await possible trial; if found guilty of the
worst potential charge against him, that of treason, Feinberg would
undoubtedly have a quick appointment with the gibbet-gallows.</p>
<p>It was out of concern for his coconspirator’s life that brought Aaron
Aaronsohn to Djemal Pasha’s Damascus office on the afternoon of January
12. Sensing that appeals for mercy or protestations of innocence may not
work in this case, the agronomist turned to the same instrument that had
failed Feinberg: locusts. To combat the new infestation, he told Djemal,
he would return to his post as inspector general of the locust
eradication program, the position he had finally left in disgust over
government interference eight months before. The one precondition,
however, was that Aaronsohn have the services of his most valuable and
important assistant, a young man named Absalom Feinberg recently caught
up in some misunderstanding in the Sinai.</p>
<p>On Djemal’s order, Feinberg was swiftly released from his Jerusalem
jail. Any euphoria the two would-be spies may have felt was undoubtedly
tempered, however: their long and fruitless campaign to reach the
British remained stalled.</p>
<p>NO ONE GRASPED the whole picture. Given the chaos of war and the
difficulty of communications, different branches of the British
government negotiated with different wartime allies—or with parties they
hoped to turn into allies—with no one realizing until too late that the
agreements thus forged might conflict with one another. It was not a
matter of duplicity, but rather a regrettable instance of the right hand
not knowing what the left was doing.</p>
<p>This is one commonly held view of historians looking at the tangle of
secret agreements that the British entered into regarding the Middle
East in 1915 and 1916. A second, minority view holds that there was
really no tangle at all, and entire books, enough to fill a great
groaning bookshelf, have been devoted to teasing out the carefully
chosen modifiers and conditionals placed within these various agreements
to absolve their crafters of any charge of bad faith.</p>
<p>In truth, the first view is a fiction, and the second merely squalid,
akin to arguing that a promise wasn’t a promise because one’s fingers
were crossed. To the degree that the British right hand didn’t know what
the left was doing, it was because a select group of men at the highest
reaches of its government went to great lengths to ensure it. To that
end, they created a labyrinth of information firewalls—deceptions, in a
less charitable assessment—to make sure that crucial knowledge was
withheld from Britain’s wartime allies and even from many of her own
seniormost diplomats and military commanders.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, one of the first entities to come in for this
treatment was the British Empire’s own “jewel in the crown,” British
India.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, the British Empire had
devolved into a unique kind of colonial solar system, a galaxy in which
its principal satellites operated with increasing autonomy from the
central “star” of Britain. Nowhere was this truer than in India, where
the British administration in Simla (as the British government of India
was commonly referred to, even though Simla was only its summer capital)
pursued its own domestic agenda and, to a remarkable degree, even its
own foreign policy.</p>
<p>But if British India maintained an aloof relationship with London, it
had a downright frosty one with British Egypt, especially after it was
informed of the negotiations between Cairo and Emir Hussein in 1915.
Ever since the creation of the Indian Raj in 1858, the Arabian Peninsula
had been recognized as falling within India’s sphere of influence, and
its administrators were loath to accept either the intrusions or
opinions of Egypt, that Johnny-come-lately to the scene. More to the
point, the largest Muslim population in the world, some eighty million
souls, was to be found in India, a number that dwarfed the Muslim
population of the Ottoman Empire by a factor of four. As Simla officials
pointed out to London, it seemed a very dangerous game to encourage
native revolt with promises of autonomy or independence in one part of
the Muslim world while ruthlessly quashing any hint of Muslim rebellion
born of those same desires in another—as British India had been doing
for decades.</p>
<p>For that reason, when Cairo’s negotiations with Emir Hussein reached
a critical phase in the autumn of 1915, Simla had launched a fierce
counterattack in London, denouncing the secret talks at every turn—so
fierce, in fact, that by late October, when officials in London and
Cairo were scrambling to fashion a suitable response to Hussein’s
extravagant demands, Lord Kitchener’s solution was to simply cut India
out of the conversation. It wasn’t until a reply had already been sent
acceding to most all of Hussein’s demands that the viceroy of India was
first told of the startling development and given the feeble excuse
that, in the press of events, there just hadn’t been time to consult
him.</p>
<p>With India thus frozen out of the equation, Emir Hussein had cut a
very good deal for himself—or so he thought. In his crucial October 24
letter, the British high commissioner to Egypt, Henry McMahon, declared
that, subject to certain modifications, “Great Britain is prepared to
recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions
within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.” While the two men
continued to haggle over those proposed modifications in subsequent
letters—the most contentious were British demands for “special
administrative arrangements” in the oil-rich Iraqi districts of Baghdad
and Basra, and for the exclusion of the northwestern corner of
Syria—Emir Hussein had every reason to believe that a great independent
Arab nation had been promised, one encompassing nearly the entire
Arabian Peninsula and stretching east to the frontier with Persia, north
to the Anatolian heartland of Turkey, and west to the Mediterranean Sea
and the border of Egypt.</p>
<p>But Hussein might have wanted to pay closer attention to a
conditional clause McMahon had unobtrusively inserted into his letter,
the caveat that these pledges only applied “wherein Great Britain is
free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France.” In
other words, if the French had a problem with some aspect of the deal,
their resistance might override British acceptance.</p>
<p>That the French were likely to have such a problem, the British knew
only too well. The previous summer, the French ambassador to Great
Britain had spelled out to Foreign Secretary Grey precisely what
territory his nation intended to grab in the Middle East. This included
all of greater Syria, or the most valuable lands now promised to
Hussein.</p>
<p>How to get around such a dilemma? By simply not telling the French of
the deal struck with Hussein. Instead, in late November, French
diplomats were invited to London to discuss their desiderata for the
Near East. With remarkable disingenuousness, British officials expressed
surprise when the French reiterated that they wanted pretty much the
whole thing: Lebanon, Palestine, the Syrian interior, Iraq. Thus the
stage was set for one of the strangest—and with the advantage of
hindsight, most destructive—diplomatic accords ever penned: the
Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>In just a few days of meetings in early January 1916, two midlevel
diplomats, Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot—by coincidence, the
same man who as French consul in Beirut had carried on a secret
correspondence with Arab dissidents and had left those documents behind
to be discovered by Djemal Pasha’s secret police—cobbled together a
future map of the Middle East that bore absolutely no relation to the
one envisioned by Emir Hussein. Instead, French imperial avarice fueled
British imperial competition, so that the truly independent Arab nation
was now to be largely limited to the desert wastelands of Arabia, with
the French taking direct control of greater Syria, and the British
taking outright all of Iraq. In addition, two great swatches of the
interior, essentially everything north and inland of Hussein’s kingdom
of the Hejaz, would be indirectly controlled, quasi-independent but with
Britain and France holding “priority of right of enterprise.” It was in
these so-called Zone A and B enclaves where the negotiators’ cynicism
was most naked; since neither Sykes nor Picot believed the Arabs were
truly capable of governing themselves, they could pledge independence
for these enclaves secure in the knowledge that they would end up as
British and French vassal states. In their spare time, the two diplomats
even came up with a new designation for Palestine. Rather than be part
of the future Arab nation—its technical default status since McMahon had
never mentioned Palestine in any of his proposed modifications with
Hussein—it was now to fall under the joint administration of France,
Great Britain, and Russia.</p>
<p>In Picot’s defense, he couldn’t have known how much his territorial
demands conflicted with those of Emir Hussein. That’s because his
British counterpart never chose to tell him. As incredible as it might
seem, during those crucial days of early January 1916 when much of the
future map of the Middle East was being drawn, there was just one person
in the world who knew the full details of both the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence and the emerging Sykes-Picot compact, and who might have
grasped the extent to which Arab, French, and British goals in the
region had now been set on a collision course: Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>But if Sykes did grasp this, he wasn’t saying. To the contrary, his
accord with Picot meant new firewalls now had to be erected, to keep in
the dark not only Emir Hussein but also all those British officials in
Egypt who were aware of the agreement with him and still ascribed to the
old-fashioned notion that a nation should abide by its promises. Just as
British India had been frozen out in the autumn of 1915, so now British
Egypt would be frozen out in the spring of 1916 as the Sykes-Picot
Agreement was debated in Entente capitals. To Cairo’s repeated queries
on the status of the Anglo-French negotiations, Sykes and other London
officials only allowed that they were ongoing, and that certainly Egypt
would be closely consulted before any final agreement was reached.
Instead, it would be May 1916 before anyone in Cairo saw a copy of
Sykes-Picot, and by then it was a fait accompli, a secret pact agreed to
by the cabinets of Britain, France, and Russia. As T. E. Lawrence would
recall, the reaction among the stunned Cairo military intelligence staff
upon finally reading the agreement had been a collective urge to
vomit.</p>
<p>But for Lawrence in the winter of 1916, all of this lay in the
future. Behind his desk at the Savoy Hotel, he continued his
“bottle-washing” and mapmaking and “paper-combat.”</p>
<p>In this last sphere, his efforts had taken on a tinge of the absurd.
At least in the past, his bureaucratic battles had been waged against
the perfidious French; now they were being fought against the continuing
intrigues of his own countrymen in British India. Apparently operating
on the premise that until Emir Hussein actually launched his revolt the
pact made with him might be scuttled, Simla was engaged in a relentless
effort in London to that end, warning of both Hussein’s unsuitability
and of the disaster to come if a unified Arab nation was encouraged to
form (a fear that obviously would have been eased had Simla known about
Sykes-Picot, which they didn’t). What made this ongoing campaign
somewhat curious in Lawrence’s view was that by the winter of 1916,
India seemed to have rather enough problems in its own immediate sphere
to worry about.</p>
<p>At least back in the autumn, Simla had been in a position to argue
that it was they, and not British Egypt, who’d actually achieved
something against the Ottoman Empire. Building on the ease with which
they’d seized the petroleum fields of southern Iraq, in April 1915 the
commander of the Indian Expeditionary Force (IEF) had sent a force of
twenty thousand men up the Tigris River. Disdaining to form alliances
with any of the local Arab tribes, let alone prattle on about autonomy
or independence, General Charles Townshend had led his army to success
after success in time-honored British military tradition—sallying forth
to thrash whoever might stand in their way—so that by October his force
stood at the gates of Baghdad. In light of this, Simla’s straight-ahead
approach to war-making appeared to have much to recommend it over the
exotic and incendiary hearts-and-minds notions wafting out of Cairo.</p>
<p>But a great deal had changed in the interim. Rather than a triumphant
entry into Baghdad, Townshend’s army had been fought to a bloody
stalemate on the city’s outskirts in late November. Far advanced from
his supply lines and with no prospect of quick reinforcement, Townshend
had then made a strategic withdrawal one hundred miles down the Tigris
to the riverfront town of Kut. By February 1916, the garrison in Kut was
reportedly under a deepening siege—British India seemed in no hurry to
provide a lot of details—even as a relief column battled its way up the
Tigris to come to its aid.</p>
<p>Still, Simla’s whisper campaign against Cairo and its embrace of
Hussein had continued. In late January, Lawrence wrote a long report,
“Politics of Mecca,” designed to allay concerns back in London—concerns
feverishly stoked by India—of what a unified Arab nation under Hussein’s
leadership might mean to Britain’s long-term interests in the region.
Perhaps tailoring his message to what the British leadership wanted to
hear, Lawrence opined that the notion of such a monolith was
far-fetched, that “if properly handled [the Arabs] would remain in a
state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities
incapable of cohesion.”</p>
<p>The following month, India appeared to try the opposite tack of
belittling Hussein. They did so by inserting into the Intelligence
Bulletin for the Middle East, a highly classified digest of information
restricted to top-ranking military and civilian officials, an interview
with a man named Abdul Aziz ibn-Saud. A tribal chieftain from the
northeastern corner of Arabia, ibn-Saud called Hussein “essentially a
trivial and unstable character,” and made it clear that neither he nor
most other Arabian tribal chieftains would ever accede to his
leadership. Even if Hussein took the risky step of declaring himself
caliph, the supreme religious-political figure in the Islamic world,
ibn-Saud argued, it “would not make any difference to his status among
other Chiefs and there would be no question of their accepting any
control from him, any more than they do now.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence, that interview represented a new, and potentially very
dangerous, escalation in the competition between Cairo and Simla. That’s
because Abdul Aziz ibn-Saud was not just another tribal malcontent bent
on retaining his autonomy, but Hussein’s most formidable rival in all of
Arabia. Having embraced an extremely austere form of fundamentalist
Islam known as Wahhabism, over the previous fifteen years ibn-Saud had
led his desert warriors into battle against one recalcitrant Arab tribe
after another with a kind of evangelical zeal. The discipline of the
Wahhabists was legendary; in that time, ibn-Saud’s reach had expanded
from a small string of oasis villages in the Riyadh region to cover a
vast expanse of northeastern Arabia. Meanwhile, Ibn-Saud was also
British India’s man in Arabia, with a close relationship going back to
before the war.</p>
<p>It was bad enough, in Lawrence’s estimation, that Simla was using the
Intelligence Bulletin to promote a man with views so antithetical to
British values, but the gambit also underscored a situation almost
laughably absurd had it not been so perilous: in their battle for
primacy over Arabian policy, two different branches of the British crown
were backing two sworn rivals. Surely that was less a recipe for a
successful Arab revolt than for civil war—which of course may have been
Simla’s true goal all along.</p>
<p>In his riposte to the ibn-Saud interview, similarly disseminated to
the upper reaches of the British government, Lawrence argued that
despite posing as Islamic reformists “with all the narrow minded bigotry
of the puritan,” ibn-Saud and his Wahhabists were hardly representative
of Islam. Instead, as he warned in “The Politics of Mecca,” the
Wahhabist sect was composed of marginal medievalists, “and if it
prevailed, we would have in place of the tolerant, rather comfortable
Islam of Mecca and Damascus, the fanaticism of Nejd … intensified and
swollen by success.”</p>
<p>As with many of Lawrence’s other predictions, his warning about
ibn-Saud and the Wahhabists was ultimately to prove true. In 1923, ibn-
Saud would conquer much of the Arabian Peninsula and, to honor his clan,
give it the name Saudi Arabia. For the next ninety years, the vast and
profligate Saudi royal family would survive by essentially buying off
the doctrinaire Wahhabists who had brought them to power, financially
subsidizing their activities so long as their disciples directed their
jihadist efforts abroad. The most famous product of this arrangement was
to be a man named Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Far more immediately, however, Lawrence was to see his war-of-words
campaign against British India sidelined by more pressing matters. That
March, he was selected for a mission so clandestine, and so assaultive
to British notions of honor, that its true nature would be largely
expunged from the history books. In a nice touch of irony, it was a
mission made necessary by a catastrophe of British India’s creation, a
series of events that reached an ugly denouement in the early morning
hours of March 8, 1916.</p>
<p>AT ABOUT 6:30 on that morning, Lieutenant General Fenton Aylmer, the
future 13th Baronet of Donadea, received some startling news. In his
army’s nighttime march on the town of Dujaila in central Iraq, the 36th
Indian Infantry Brigade had become disoriented in the dark. Rather than
stop at their preassigned forward position to wait out the dawn
artillery bombardment of the enemy, segments of the brigade had
continued on across the barren Dujaila plain and directly into the
Turks’ forward line. More specifically, they had stumbled squarely up
the approaches to “the Citadel,” a forty-foot-high earthen fortress that
commanded the surrounding flatlands and formed the strongpoint of the
Turkish defenseworks.</p>
<p>It sounded like a blueprint for slaughter, but it hadn’t quite played
out that way. The runner who appeared at Aylmer’s headquarters that
morning reported that, by all appearances, the fortress was either
deserted or manned by a tiny skeleton guard; the 36th Indian Infantry
Brigade was at the gates of the Citadel, and it was theirs for the
taking.</p>
<p>It was the pivotal moment in Aylmer’s long and bloody campaign to
relieve General Townshend’s army in Kut, now just eight miles farther up
the Tigris River. With the astounding report out of the Citadel, here
was not only the chance to win the battle of Dujaila before it had
properly begun, but to begin to atone for the colossal missteps that had
characterized Aylmer’s advance over the previous two months.</p>
<p>By March 1916, the various armies of Europe had devised a simple rote
method for attacking their entrenched foes: a sustained artillery
bombardment of the enemy’s forward defenses, one that might last a few
hours or several days depending on the scale of the planned assault,
followed by an infantry rush across no-man’s-land. The problems with
these tactics were manifest at every step. Most such bombardments caused
relatively few casualties, since the defenders simply retreated to back
trenches—or, in the more sophisticated trenchworks of the Western Front,
into heavily protected underground bunkers—to await their conclusion.
Naturally, these preliminary barrages also alerted the defenders both
that an assault was coming and its precise location.</p>
<p>Once the shelling ceased, the attacking infantry units climbed out of
their forward staging trenches to begin their advance across
no-man’s-land. Unfortunately for them, the end of the artillery barrage
also cued the defenders that the ground assault was now under way,
enabling them to quickly return to their own forward trenches and mow
down the exposed attackers as they approached. In just this way, by
early 1916, men had died by the hundreds of thousands in trenchworks
across the breadth of Europe.</p>
<p>Despite the failure of these tactics across a wide spectrum of
Europe’s varied topography, Lieutenant General Aylmer had apparently
seen no means to improve upon them on the flat and featureless landscape
of central Iraq. It also seemed to escape him that it was these same
ruinous tactics, employed by General Townshend in his effort to take
Baghdad, that were necessitating his rescue mission in the first place.
In the two months since he had set off for Kut with some twenty thousand
British and Indian troops, Aylmer had three times hurled his men in
frontal assaults over bare ground against the entrenched Turks. Each
time, the British Indian army had eventually carried the field, if only
through sheer numerical dominance—they outnumbered the Turks by at least
two to one—and only at astounding cost; in the first two weeks, the
relief force had suffered some ten thousand casualties, or half its
strength.</p>
<p>This was no cause for undue alarm among senior commanders downstream,
apparently, for they soon began shuttling some fifteen thousand more men
up to Aylmer for a second push. By early March, this replenished force
had advanced upriver until it came to the Turkish trenchline in Dujaila,
the last obstacle standing between the rescuers and Kut just beyond.
Having learned at least a little from his earlier battles, Aylmer had
decided on a night march to the very edge of the Turks’ artillery range
in Dujaila, a quick sunrise bombardment, and then a dash for the Citadel
that dominated the pancake-flat plain. It was shortly before dawn, while
his guns were being silently unlimbered into place for the coming
barrage, that he learned of the 36th Indian’s remarkable news.</p>
<p>But Fenton Aylmer was clearly not a man who liked surprises, even
good ones. After hastily conferring with his senior commanders, it was
decided that the preemptive capture of the Turkish stronghold posed too
great a departure from the battle plans already worked out to be
adequately supported. The 36th Indian was ordered away from the Citadel
and back to the main British line; from there, they could recross the
plain and seize the fortress once the opening artillery bombardment had
been completed.</p>
<p>When finally the British bombardment commenced—not at dawn as
planned, but at 8 a.m.—all element of surprise had been lost, the
Dujaila Citadel hurriedly manned by Turkish troops ferried over from
across the river. It was another hour before the British frontal assault
began. Very quickly, another four thousand imperial troops had fallen in
no-man’s-land, without a single one reaching the Citadel.</p>
<p>That engagement at Dujaila represented the last best chance the
British had to save their besieged army in Kut. Over the previous two
months, they had suffered fourteen thousand casualties trying to rescue
an army of twelve thousand—and they weren’t quite done yet. For his
efforts, Fenton Aylmer was quietly relieved of command three days after
Dujaila and shuffled off to a back-base job. Perhaps in recognition of
his uneven achievements in Iraq, as well as his attempted cover‑up of
the Citadel fiasco—his official battle report would make no mention of
the 36th Indian’s report—his knighthood would be delayed until 1922.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Dujaila debacle, and in light of the dire
situation facing Townshend’s army at Kut—reports indicated the garrison
would run out of food by mid-April—Lord Kitchener set to hatching a
desperate scheme. In its pursuit, on the morning of March 22, 1916, the
passenger ship Royal George slipped from its berth at Port Suez and
turned south into the Red Sea, embarking on a fourteen-day journey
around the Arabian Peninsula to southern Iraq. On board was T. E.
Lawrence. He carried with him a letter of introduction from High
Commissioner Henry McMahon to Sir Percy Cox, British India’s chief
political officer in Iraq.</p>
<p>“My dear Cox,” the letter read, “I send these few lines to introduce
Captain Lawrence who is starting today for Mesopotamia under orders from
the W.O. [War Office] to give his services in regards to Arab matters.
He is one of the best of our very able intelligence staff here and has a
thorough knowledge of the Arab question in all its bearings. I feel sure
that you will find him of great use. We are very sorry to lose so
valuable a man from our staff here.</p>
<p>“I hope things are going well on your side. We are anxiously awaiting
news of Townshend’s relief but have heard nothing for ages.”</p>
<p>The purpose of Lawrence’s mission was actually twofold, one overt,
the other very much veiled. In view of the ongoing crisis at Kut,
Kitchener and his allies in the Egyptian intelligence staff hoped the
British Indian commanders in Iraq might finally see the wisdom of trying
to work with the indigenous Arab tribes that should have been their
natural allies all along. The plan was to start sending out a group of
Iraqi Arab officers who had defected from the Turks and were now working
for the British in Egypt, so that they might forge alliances with local
Iraqi tribal leaders, as well as peel away disgruntled Arab units of the
Ottoman army.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine how any of this could be done in time to save
Townshend, however, and this gave rise to the second purpose of
Lawrence’s mission. Under orders from Kitchener himself, an attempt was
to be made to bribe the Turkish commander of the Kut siege into letting
Townshend’s army go in return for one million English pounds’ worth of
gold.</p>
<p>If Lawrence resented being the bearer of this shameful instruction,
almost without precedent in British military history, he never let on.
Then again, he’d very recently been given two reminders of the puffery
and hypocrisy of military culture.</p>
<p>A year and a half earlier, he had been magically elevated from
civilian to second lieutenant because a general visiting the General
Staff map room demanded to be briefed by an officer. Now Lawrence’s
superiors in Cairo had abruptly rushed through his temporary promotion
to captain, effective his first day at sea, presumably to spare the very
senior military commanders he would be meeting in Iraq from the
indignity of conferring with a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>A rather more baffling episode had occurred just four days before
he’d boarded the Royal George. On March 18, the small French military
legation in Cairo had been temporarily recalled to France and, in
long-standing military tradition among the European powers, the occasion
was marked by the liberal disbursement of medals and honorifics. Quite
inexplicably, considering his consistent efforts to thwart French
ambitions in the region, the outgoing legation had selected Lawrence for
the Légion d’Honneur, one of France’s highest awards. Compounding their
error, the following year they awarded him the Croix de Guerre avec
palme.</p>
<p>Over the course of his wartime service, Lawrence was awarded a number
of medals and ribbons, but with his profound disdain for such things, he
either threw them away or never bothered to collect them. He made an
exception in the case of the Croix de Guerre; after the war, according
to his brother, he found amusement in placing the medal around the neck
of a friend’s dog and parading it through the streets of Oxford.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of April 5, the Royal George slipped into the bay of
the dreary, low-slung port city of Basra, and a Royal Navy launch was
sent out to collect its most important passenger, the newly minted
Captain T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>As Lawrence soon discovered in Basra, the overt objective of his
mission to Iraq, to coax British Indian commanders into launching a
hearts-and-minds campaign among the local tribes, had already been
mooted. In a series of cables to London while he had been in transit,
the new commander in chief of the Indian Army Expeditionary Force in
Iraq, General Percy Lake, had already dismissed the scheme as
“undesirable and inconvenient.”</p>
<p>But as Lawrence conferred with that leadership during his first days
in Basra, it was clear that another, more insidious element had doomed
his political mission, a toxic fusion of racism and British notions of
military superiority. Despite the fresh example of the disaster at
Gallipoli—maybe even because of it—many senior British commanders simply
couldn’t accept that they might lose to the “rabble” of the Ottoman army
yet again. This attitude wasn’t isolated to the narrow-minded generals
of British India, but extended all the way to the supreme commander of
British forces, General William Robertson, back in London. Upon hearing
of the generous surrender terms offered to Townshend by Khalil Pasha,
the Turkish commander at Kut, after the defeat of Aylmer’s relief
column, Robertson had responded, “My general information is to the
effect that the difficulties of the Turks are serious. I regard Khalil
Bey’s overtures as a confirmation of this and as an indication that,
given determined action on our part, success is assured.”</p>
<p>In other words, in the upside-down worldview that this war against
its military and cultural inferiors had induced in the British high
command, an offer of honorable surrender was only evidence of the
enemy’s weakness, and that two relief efforts had ended in abject
failure meant a third was sure to succeed.</p>
<p>By the time Lawrence was shuttled up the Tigris River to join the
frontline headquarters staff on April 15, this third relief effort was
well under way. After the fiasco at Dujaila, there had been a wholesale
shakeup of that staff, with Aylmer replaced by a certain Major General
George Gorringe. Unfortunately, the changes hadn’t extended to the
tactical playbook. Displaying the same fondness for frontal assaults
against an entrenched enemy as his predecessor, Gorringe neatly
replicated the record of Aylmer’s first relief effort—ten thousand dead
and wounded, no breakthrough—in almost precisely the same two-week
span.</p>
<p>That final failure ended the uncomfortable existence Lawrence had
endured ever since reaching the Snakefly, the British headquarters ship
docked in the Tigris River below Kut. As word had spread among the
officers on board of the clandestine purpose of his mission—to try to
ransom out the Kut garrison—the young captain from Egypt had been
pointedly shunned by most everyone. But now, having suffered some
twenty-three thousand casualties across nine separate engagements
without ever reaching Kut, and with that trapped garrison rapidly
nearing starvation, the generals in charge belatedly accepted that
Kitchener’s scheme was the only option left.</p>
<p>But even at this eleventh hour, there would be time for an element of
farce. Since neither General Townshend nor the commanders hoping to
rescue him wished to have such an ignominious endeavor attached to their
reputations, through the last days of April, Townshend and General Lake
waged a duel of cablegrams, each arguing that the other should carry out
the negotiations. Instead, it would ultimately fall on three junior
officers—Colonel Edward Beach, Captain Aubrey Herbert, and Captain T. E.
Lawrence—to make one last attempt to save the dying men of Kut.</p>
<p>IT HAD ALL the trappings of a Victorian parlor-room melodrama: the
dashing and excessively handsome young nobleman, a requisite coterie of
flirtatious but chaste women, the cold-blooded archvillain, even the
innocent abroad, that out-of-his-depth character who, after various
twists and turns, would provide the story with its moral conclusion.
Where the small expatriate community of wartime Jerusalem differed from
any theatrical counterparts was in the consequences to be paid for
ending up on the wrong side of the narrative: imprisonment, exile, even
execution. What was also different, of course, was the world that lay
beyond those parlor-room windows, not the pleasant English countryside
or a tony London street, but a city consumed by death, its streets and
alleyways littered with those succumbed to starvation or typhus, its
public squares frequently featuring men hanging from gibbet-gallows.</p>
<p>For William Yale, it was an exceedingly strange, fishbowl existence.
With very little to do in the way of work, most every afternoon he met
up to play bridge with an eclectic group of friends—a Greek doctor, an
Armenian doctor, a retired Turkish colonel, and the Greek bishop of
Jerusalem—that diversion giving over in the evenings to larger
gatherings in the salons of various middle-aged expatriate women. At
these soirees, dominated by dancing and the playing of parlor games, a
peculiar sexual dynamic took place. Since there were few single
expatriate women remaining in Jerusalem—and any attention paid to one
could be quickly interpreted as an interest to marry—the single men
flirted, openly and competitively, with the married women in attendance,
often in plain view and with the acquiescence of their husbands. It was
all quite harmless and innocent.</p>
<p>But there was nothing truly harmless in wartime Jerusalem, as Yale
discovered when he became the favorite of Madame Alexis Frey, an
attractive middle-aged French widow who enjoyed the status of grande
dame of the city’s salon scene. Yale’s standing with Frey so rankled one
of his competitors, a middle-aged Christian Arab who headed the Turkish
Tobacco Régie, or monopoly, in Syria, that the man took Yale aside one
day to make a proposal. “How about we divide the ladies of Jerusalem up
between the two of us,” the businessman said. “For myself, I will
reserve Madame Frey, and you can have all the rest.”</p>
<p>Yale initially dismissed the proposition as a joke, but thought
differently when he next went to the Régie office to purchase his
monthly ration of cigarettes, only to be told by the clerks they’d been
instructed to not sell to him. That posed a problem since, true to its
definition, the Régie was the only place tobacco could be obtained in
wartime Jerusalem. Shortly afterward, Yale was informed by the Jerusalem
chief of police that his challenger from the Régie was plotting
intrigues against him.</p>
<p>“I began to realize that I was up against a jealous, unscrupulous
person who would go to great lengths to rid himself of a rival,” Yale
recalled. “As my business demanded that my position should be such that
I be on friendly terms with the Turkish officials and authorities, I saw
I was playing a dangerous game. I decided to let Madame Frey settle the
issue, so I told her to send Monsieur X packing or our affair was
over.”</p>
<p>When Madame Frey explained that that was quite impossible given the
Régie man’s prominence, the American oilman withdrew from the Frey salon
in a huff. Yale’s manservant, a grizzled old Kurd named Mustapha
Kharpoutli, came up with an alternative solution. “Oh Master,” he
counseled Yale, “I know where ‘the pig’ goes every evening, so give the
order and I will finish with him.” As Kharpoutli explained, the Régie
man left a particular woman’s house every night at midnight. “It’s on a
lonely street. I will kill him tonight if you tell me to.”</p>
<p>Yale declined that offer, and shortly after his friends engineered a
brief rapprochement with Alexis Frey. It was a risky business, for the
city’s thicket of martial law edicts afforded almost endless
possibilities for a rival to exact revenge; during Frey’s next
curfew-violating salon, her home was raided and half the attendees
hauled off to jail, presumably after a tip-off from the jealous Régie
man.</p>
<p>The episode served to remind Yale that his life now was like a game
of musical chairs, one with extremely high stakes. The ultimate arbiter
of that game, of course, was Djemal Pasha. On his word, most anyone
could be cast into prison or summarily banished to some distant village
in the Syrian wastelands—if often only to be just as swiftly released or
restored according to Djemal’s whim.</p>
<p>To stay in Djemal’s good graces, or to soften the punishment when
that failed, the foreign community in Jerusalem most often looked to two
men. One was the dashing consul from neutral Spain, Antonio de la
Cierva, Conde de Ballobar, who, having assumed the consular duties of
most all the European “belligerent” nations, was extraordinarily well
informed and influential. William Yale’s relationship with the Conde de
Ballobar was a tricky one: a good ally to have if matters went awry, but
also his most formidable competition when it came to fishing in
Jerusalem’s sparse pool of attractive and available women.</p>
<p>For day-to-day protection, Yale was much more likely to turn to
another pillar of Jerusalem society, a charming middle-aged aristocrat
named Ismail Hakki Bey al-Husseini, one of the three Jerusalem
businessmen from whom Socony had obtained the original Kornub
concessions back in the spring of 1914. Yale had developed a friendship
with Ismail Bey during his extended stay in Palestine prior to the war’s
outbreak. That had quickly resumed upon Yale’s return in 1915, and by
the spring of 1916 the oilman considered Ismail Bey his closest friend
in the Middle East. Of course, it probably didn’t hurt that the
Husseinis were one of the most powerful and well-respected families in
all of southern Syria, Ismail Bey being a particularly prominent
member.</p>
<p>But if the expatriate community had its protectors, it also had its
predators. Of these, none was more dreaded than a young German officer
who flitted in and out of the city with some regularity, Curt Prüfer. As
Count de Ballobar noted of Prüfer, despite “his harmless appearance [he]
is nothing less than a secret agent of the German government,” and “in
possession of an extraordinary talent.” What made Prüfer such a figure
of menace, quite beyond the creepiness factor of his whispery voice, was
that he seemed to be the one German whom Djemal Pasha trusted
implicitly. Run afoul of Curt Prüfer, and even the determined entreaties
of Count de Ballobar or Ismail Hakki Bey might prove useless. Even the
entreaties of Djemal Pasha, in fact. One afternoon, Yale happened to be
visiting an expatriate couple he was friendly with when their front door
was kicked in by Prüfer and two accompanying policemen. While the couple
had claimed to be Swiss, it was an open secret within the foreign
community—and to Djemal Pasha—that they were actually French, a detail
Prüfer had apparently just uncovered. When he demanded the couple be
cast into internal exile, an unhappy Djemal had no choice but to sign
the expulsion order.</p>
<p>Prüfer’s authority became especially worrisome to William Yale in the
winter of 1916 when he discovered that he and the German intelligence
agent were locked in a three-way competition—the third was the
ubiquitous Ballobar—for the same woman, a beautiful Jewish-American girl
living in Jerusalem. Concerned that her American suitor might soon be
arrested, the girl finally confided to Yale that Prüfer frequently
interrogated her about him and his activities. “Clearly I was under
suspicion.”</p>
<p>Surviving in wartime Syria required not only a finely honed
selfishness, but a hardening of the heart. In this, Yale, the consummate
survivor, was not at all immune. Every day for months on end, he had to
step over the bodies of the dead and dying as he traversed Jerusalem.
Every week he heard stories of those who had fallen from favor being
disappeared, either figuratively in the form of banishment or quite
literally in the form of the gibbet-gallows. To protect himself and his
interests in such a place, he became increasingly cold-blooded, too, so
much so that he would eventually turn on his closest friend. To his
later embarrassment, this didn’t stem from matters of personal safety;
William Yale did it for oil.</p>
<p>Prior to his first meeting with Djemal Pasha in the spring of 1915,
Yale had decided to divide Socony’s petition for concessionary rights in
Palestine into two separate requests, figuring that to ask for the
entire half million acres desired at one fell swoop was to invite a
backlash. The problem was that, having long since sewn up the
concessionary rights to the first quarter million acres and done nothing
with them, by the spring of 1916 the oilman had still not mustered the
gall to ask after the second.</p>
<p>What he needed was some kind of opening to alter the playing field,
but just what that might be was hard to imagine—especially since Djemal
had clearly cottoned to Socony’s game. At the beginning of 1916, the
Constantinople office had labored mightily to obtain concessionary
rights to several large tracts around Damascus, going so far as to make
the American consul in that city, Samuel Edelman, their point man in the
effort. In late March, however, after Edelman took the matter up with
“the supreme factor in these regions”—an obvious reference to Djemal—he
cabled back to Socony with some bad news. “[Djemal] says that while
recently in Constantinople, the Minister of Mines said to him [that]
Standard Oil was not working for the benefit or interest of Turkey, but
to shut off competition. So long as this suspicion hangs over you, [it]
will not be possible to obtain further concessions.”</p>
<p>Shortly after that rebuff, however, an opening suddenly presented
itself when Yale was once again summoned to Djemal’s headquarters at the
German Hospice. As the governor explained, he had recently received
reports from military officers in the field of a large pool of oil
collected at the base of a mountain in the southern desert. Since this
oil was already on the surface, Djemal pointed out, it should be an easy
matter to start collecting and refining it at once. As a personal favor,
he wanted Yale to go and investigate the site, a small chain of
mountains below Beersheva known as Kornub.</p>
<p>Yale instantly realized this “find” was the very same one that J. C.
Hill had spotted from a Judean hillside two years earlier, and which he
and Rudolf McGovern had ascertained to be iron tailings. But this seemed
a detail not worth mentioning to Djemal Pasha. Instead, Yale said he
would be happy to investigate the Kornub site, so long as the governor
could see his way to approving a few more concessionary tracts. When he
left the German Hospice that day, the Standard representative had the
pasha’s consent to another quarter million acres of Palestine.</p>
<p>But while preparing for this next concession-procurement expedition
Yale suddenly encountered a problem with his best friend, Ismail Hakki
Bey. During the first great concession-buying expedition of the previous
summer, Ismail Bey had succumbed to Yale’s entreaties to accompany him
on the vague assurance that Socony would compensate him for his
services; even though the businessman had no proprietary interest in
those concessions, he had relented. To be sure, that collaboration was
rooted in more than mere friendship for both men. While Ismail Bey’s
cultured company was a welcome addition to the scrofulous assortment of
soldiers and government functionaries who formed the rest of Yale’s
retinue, the American also looked to his well-connected friend to smooth
out any difficulties that might arise with stubborn landowners or
extortionate local officials. From Ismail Bey’s perspective, with Socony
clearly planning a massive exploration project in Palestine at some
point in the future, it only made good business sense to attach to the
undertaking however he could.</p>
<p>But when approached by Yale in the late spring of 1916 for his help
with the next round of concession-buying, Ismail Bey balked. In the Arab
way of doing business, one’s word was inviolate. Ismail Bey had now seen
enough of the American way to know that Yale’s assurances of
compensation were quite meaningless; what he needed was a written
contract. Confronted by this request, Yale explained that as a mere
purchasing agent for Socony, he hadn’t the authority to pen such a
guarantee, but that if Ismail Bey “wished to know my personal opinion,
it was that he had better have confidence in the Company.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t good enough for Ismail Bey; he informed his friend that
without such a written guarantee, he couldn’t help him.</p>
<p>This placed Yale in a most difficult spot. Over the course of their
two-and-a-half-year friendship, he’d come to know all of Ismail Bey’s
seven children, and had frequently dined in his Jerusalem home. As in
any true friendship, the two had also shared confidences: on Yale’s
part, of the British nurse he had met in Jerusalem before the war and
hoped one day to marry; on Ismail Bey’s part, of his low opinion of the
Ottoman government in general, and his resentment of Djemal Pasha in
particular. Compounding Yale’s difficulty was the very prominence of the
Husseini name in Syria. Since Ismail Bey had relatives scattered in high
government positions throughout the region, a rift between them might
not be a matter of simply parting ways; if the businessman chose to
stand in his way, the same doors that had previously been flung open for
Socony could now be slammed shut.</p>
<p>As Yale recounted in his memoir, “I looked at him and said, ’Well,
Ismail Bey, much as I will dislike doing it, if you do not agree to
cooperate with me, I shall go at once to Djemal Pasha and tell him that
you are blocking me, that you are pro-British and are tied up with
British interests.”</p>
<p>It marked a dramatic transformation in William Yale. In 1911, while
working for a wealthy Bostonian industrialist, Yale had refused the
pleas of his own bankrupted and desperate father for an introduction to
his employer, feeling that trading on his position to arrange such a
meeting would be improper. Just five years later, Yale was threatening
his best friend with probable death—and not an easy death, but likely
one that would only come after protracted torture and after his wives
and children had been cast into a destitute exile—over a business
deal.</p>
<p>But it worked. “I studied his face anxiously as I awaited his
response,” Yale would recall. “Rather abruptly he replied, ‘I’ll assist
you; I’ll trust the Company.’ And he did work loyally with me as long as
I represented the Company in Palestine.”</p>
<p>KHALIL PASHA’S HEADQUARTERS encampment consisted of a single round
tent set some four miles back from the front lines at Kut. It was
midafternoon before the three British officers, having at last completed
their grueling blindfolded journey from no-man’s-land, were ushered
inside.</p>
<p>Khalil was a trim man in his midthirties with piercing brown eyes and
the handlebar mustache favored by Turkish officers—by all Turkish males,
in fact—and despite the desolation of his surroundings, he still
retained something of the dapper manner he had perfected in the salons
of Constantinople. Aubrey Herbert, during his prewar days as an honorary
consul in the Ottoman capital, had come to know Khalil quite well, and
once he and his companions had settled in the tent he tried to break the
ice with some opening pleasantries. “Where was it that I met Your
Excellency last?” Herbert asked in French.</p>
<p>Khalil apparently had a good memory. “At a dance at the British
embassy,” he replied, also in French. From there, though, the
conversation took a far more somber turn.</p>
<p>It was April 29, and the three British officers had set out for this
meeting early that morning, climbing over the forward parapet of a
British trenchline and into no-man’s-land under the cover of a white
flag. Before them stretched six hundred yards of waist-high meadow
grass, at the far end of which rose the earthen berm of the Turks’
trenchworks. Walking to a spot roughly equidistant between the two
lines, they stopped and waited for several hours for some response from
the Turkish side, buffeted both by the steadily rising heat and by the
swarms of blowflies feeding on the rotting corpses that lay all about
them. At last, the three men were taken over to the Turkish line, where
they were blindfolded and put on horses to take them to Khalil’s
headquarters. Having badly hurt his knee in a fall a few days earlier,
Lawrence quickly found that he couldn’t ride; taken off his horse but
still in blindfold, he was led by the hand by a Turkish soldier,
stumbling and limping the four miles to Khalil’s tent.</p>
<p>In stepping out into no-man’s-land that morning, all three men were
acutely aware of the humiliating nature of the task they’d been given.
So dishonorable was this bribery attempt that Edward Beach would never
publicly reveal the mission’s true purpose, Lawrence would only write of
it in the most euphemistic fashion, while Aubrey Herbert couldn’t even
bring himself to commit the words to the anonymity of his private diary;
writing in his journal the previous evening, he noted that the only
items they had to bargain with were “Townshend’s guns, exchange of
Turkish prisoners, and another thing.” Even this ambiguity was
ultimately too revealing; when Herbert’s diary was published after the
war, that clause was excised altogether.</p>
<p>But as the three officers soon learned in Khalil Pasha’s tent, they
actually had even less to bargain with than that. Unbeknownst to them
when they’d set out, early that morning an increasingly unhinged
Townshend had abruptly agreed to an unconditional surrender. Following
military protocol, he then destroyed his remaining pieces of artillery.
This act infuriated Khalil Pasha—he had desperately wanted to get his
hands on those guns—and it left Beach, Herbert, and Lawrence with little
to offer the Turkish commander beyond the gold ransom.</p>
<p>This the British officers couched in terms of a kind of humanitarian
assistance package for the civilian residents of Kut. Surely, they
suggested, those innocents had suffered just as badly as the trapped
British soldiers through the five-month siege, and some form of
financial recompense seemed in order. Khalil Pasha saw through the
artifice at once and airily brushed the proposal away.</p>
<p>The negotiating party fared a bit better in asking for a transfer of
wounded soldiers. With the Kut garrison now surrendered, the Turkish
commander agreed to let British steamers come up with food supplies and
take out the worst wounded. This concession encouraged Colonel Beach,
the senior negotiator, to try his last card: an exchange of able-bodied
prisoners, the survivors in Kut in return for the Ottoman prisoners the
British had taken since first coming ashore in Iraq.</p>
<p>With an arch expression, Khalil offered an alternative arrangement, a
one-for-one exchange of British soldiers for Turkish ones, a separate
exchange for Indian soldiers and Arabs. The British officers weren’t
quite sure what to make of this offer, but when Herbert remarked that
many Arab troops in the enemy army had fought valiantly and Khalil would
be lucky to have them back, the Turkish commander’s manner abruptly
changed. Holding up a list of the POWs held by the British, Khalil
pointed out the preponderance of Arab names. “Perhaps one of our
[Turkish] men in ten is weak or cowardly,” he said, “but it’s only one
in a hundred of the Arabs who are brave.… You can send them back to me
if you like, but I have already condemned them to death. I shall like to
have them to hang.”</p>
<p>Realizing they were being toyed with, the British officers dropped
the matter. A short time later, Khalil Pasha gave an affected yawn and
announced that he was tired, that he still had many other matters to
attend. So ended the last chance to rescue the garrison in Kut. From
Khalil’s headquarters, Lawrence, Herbert, and Beach were escorted back
to the front line but, as darkness had now fallen, were invited to stay
the night inside a Turkish encampment. As Lawrence pointedly wrote in
his diary, “they gave us a most excellent dinner in Turkish style.”</p>
<p>The following morning, the three officers were led down to the
riverbank. In the daylight, they saw one body after another floating by
on the Tigris’s swift current. They were Ottoman soldiers, succumbed to
cholera or typhus or battle wounds, and so indifferent were their
commanders that their bodies had been tossed into the river rather than
buried.</p>
<p>That same day, Townshend formally surrendered his forces at Kut. Both
his army and the relief columns that were slaughtered trying to rescue
it had been composed largely of Indian soldiers, and to whatever degree
racism had contributed to their expendable treatment by their British
commanders, those men were now to suffer even worse at the hands of the
Turks. With most put to work essentially as slave labor on the Baghdad
Railway, of the ten thousand Indian soldiers and camp-followers who went
into captivity at Kut, as few as one-third would live to see the war’s
end.</p>
<p>A happier fate was in store for General Townshend. Taken to
Constantinople, he spent the remainder of the war in a pleasant villa on
an island in the Bosporus, where he was given use of a Turkish naval
yacht and frequently attended diplomatic receptions at the Ottoman
court. Joining him in Constantinople were his three prized Yorkshire
terriers, pets that, despite the near-starvation conditions in Kut, had
weathered the ordeal quite nicely. In a testament to the element of
collegiality that persisted among the imperial ruling classes even in
wartime, a number of Turkish government officials sent Townshend
congratulatory notes on the occasion of his knighthood by King George V
in October 1916.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON A MORNING in early April, a courier on horseback appeared at the
al-Bakri farmstead outside Damascus summoning Faisal Hussein to Djemal
Pasha’s offices in the city. This was hardly out of the ordinary. Faisal
had returned to the Syrian capital at Djemal’s request three months
earlier and had frequent dealings with the governor. When Faisal arrived
at Djemal’s office that morning, however, he found him in a strangely
cool, controlled mood.</p>
<p>After coffee had been served and pleasantries exchanged, Djemal slid
a piece of paper across his desk. It was a telegram from Enver Pasha in
Constantinople, and it concerned a letter the generalissimo had just
received from Faisal’s father in Mecca. It was less a letter than an
ultimatum: if the Young Turks wished to retain his friendship, Hussein
warned, they needed to recognize him as the hereditary ruler of the
Hejaz, and to end the ongoing trial of the five dozen Arab nationalist
leaders in Lebanon.</p>
<p>It placed Faisal in a very dangerous spot. Upon his return to
Damascus in January, he had quickly discovered that the odds for a
successful Arab revolt in Syria had radically diminished since his
earlier visit. Many of the would-be political leaders of such a revolt
had been banished or gone into hiding as a result of Djemal’s purges,
while the military component had been decimated at Gallipoli. While
Faisal had alerted his father to this changed situation, judging by his
petulant telegram, Hussein didn’t grasp just how dire matters stood.</p>
<p>“Effendim,” Djemal recounted Faisal as saying, “you’ve no idea what a
grief this is to me. This telegram is certainly the result of some great
misunderstanding. I can positively assure you that my father means
nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Instead, Faisal attributed the “misunderstanding” to his father’s
difficulty with the Turkish language; obviously, some scribe had
mistranslated his father’s Arabic text and mangled it into something far
different than intended. In Djemal’s office that morning, Faisal offered
to cable his father and, by explaining that his words had been
misconstrued, undoubtedly obtain his immediate renunciation of the
offending letter.</p>
<p>But as tiresome as Djemal Pasha was finding the machinations of
Hussein and his sons, he also rather enjoyed watching Faisal squirm.
Dismissing the young sheikh from his office, he instead composed his own
letter to Emir Hussein. After explaining why he couldn’t possibly
release the Damascus defendants—“a government which pardoned traitors
would be accused of weakness”—Djemal further suggested that with the
nation in a war where its very survival was at stake, this perhaps
wasn’t the best time for Hussein to pursue the business of making his
title hereditary. He then took the gloves off: “I should also draw your
attention to the following aspect of the matter. Let us assume the
Government complied with your demand solely because they wanted to keep
you from being troublesome in the difficult times through which we are
passing. If the war came to a victorious conclusion, who could prevent
the Government from dealing with you with the greatest severity once it
is over?”</p>
<p>However imperfect his knowledge of the Turkish language, Emir Hussein
surely understood the threat in those words. And just in case there was
still any uncertainty, Djemal soon turned his attention to the Lebanon
show-trial defendants. On May 5, and despite Faisal’s continued pleas
for clemency, he signed execution orders for twenty-one of those found
guilty. Early the next morning, the condemned were led into public
squares in Damascus and Beirut and hanged.</p>
<p>In concert with another event, those executions finally brought the
long, tortured dance between the Young Turks and the Hashemite ruler in
Arabia to an end. Just weeks earlier, Djemal Pasha had dispatched a new
force of some thirty-five hundred crack troops to Medina. He had assured
Hussein that the unit was en route to Yemen, at the southwestern corner
of the Arabian Peninsula, but Hussein wasn’t convinced, suspecting they
were really coming for him. In the wake of the May 6 executions, Hussein
decided the time for dithering was over, and sent word to Faisal to get
out of Damascus.</p>
<p>At about the same time that Faisal was preparing to do so, Djemal
Pasha received another supplicant, Aaron Aaronsohn. In the four months
since he had returned to his post as head of the locust eradication
program, the agronomist had been a fairly frequent visitor to the
governor’s Damascus office during his travels through the region. He’d
been happy to be able to report to Djemal that the second wave of
locusts hadn’t spawned, and so posed no threat in the future; even by
late March, their numbers had begun to dwindle. What he hadn’t shared
with the Syrian governor, of course, was that he’d used the cover of his
scientific fieldwork to establish an extensive network of prospective
Jewish spies across Palestine.</p>
<p>Putting that network together had been exceedingly delicate work for
Aaronsohn. Within the Jewish yeshuv, or community, was one faction that
actively supported the Central Powers, another that secretly supported
the Entente, while the vast majority simply wanted to stay out of the
whole mess and hope for the best. What united almost everyone, however,
was staunch opposition to any action that might bring more adverse
Ottoman attention; even for those quietly praying for the British to
come, they would lend their assistance once they were ashore, but to do
anything beforehand was just too dangerous for everyone. Only by very
gingerly sounding out their friends and acquaintances had Aaronsohn and
Feinberg managed to recruit some dozen like-minded members of the
community willing to spy for Great Britain preemptively.</p>
<p>That remained a theoretical enterprise, however. Over the course of
that winter, there had been several sightings of the British spy ships
off the coast of Athlit, and the British had even sent messages ashore,
but through an improbable string of bad luck, contact had never been
made. For Aaron Aaronsohn, it was a maddening predicament. Three times
they’d tried to connect with the British, and three times it had gone
wrong, with the last try nearly resulting in Feinberg’s death. Then, in
the early spring of 1916, he came up with a new idea.</p>
<p>From his travels, Aaronsohn had learned that the Turkish army
suffered from a massive shortage of lubricating oil; indeed, he could
scarcely have not learned it since the earsplitting screech of oilless
axles had become a kind of perpetual background music in Syria. Reading
through a scientific journal one day, the agronomist came upon an
article about a team of European scientists who had devised a method of
converting sesame seed oil into lubricating oil. If there was one thing
the Ottoman Empire had no shortage of it was sesame seeds, and it was
with this proposal—to learn the extraction method from scientists in
Germany and apply it to the Turkish war effort—that Aaronsohn came to
Djemal’s Damascus office one day in May.</p>
<p>Travel anywhere in the Ottoman Empire now required a vesika, or
permit, and one of the few people who could approve the sort of journey
Aaronsohn was proposing was Djemal Pasha himself. The governor was
undoubtedly very suspicious. He didn’t really trust Aaronsohn—or pretty
much any Jew, for that matter—and there had recently been that strange
business of his assistant caught wandering in the Sinai. To let such a
man out of his clutches, even for a visit to an allied nation, was to
take a great chance.</p>
<p>Against this, though, was Djemal’s desperate need for lubricating oil
for his army, a need the Standard Oil Company of New York seemed in no
hurry to fulfill despite the staggering concessions he’d given them in
Syria. In his usual brusque way, the governor quickly granted
Aaronsohn’s vesika for passage to Constantinople; once there, the
scientist would need to clear more bureaucratic hurdles before
continuing on to Berlin. But, of course, Aaronsohn had no intention of
stopping at Berlin. Instead, he hoped to slip across the German frontier
into a neutral country and there make contact with British intelligence;
he just hadn’t figured out that part of the plan yet.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>LAWRENCE SET OUT for the return to Cairo from Iraq aboard a British
troopship on May 11. In the past year, he had lost two brothers to this
conflict that seemed to have no end, and if by mid-1916 the bankruptcy
of the British war effort was everywhere evident, nowhere was it more so
than here on its eastern flank. In just thirteen months, Britain had
suffered some 350,000 casualties at the hands of “the sick man of
Europe,” had failed—and failed totally—where a ragtag collection of
Balkan militias and armed peasants had repeatedly succeeded just three
years earlier. As if that weren’t enough, he was just then returning
from an experience that, on both a personal and historical level, laid
bare that bankruptcy like no other: a futile bid to save the lives of
twelve thousand starving and defeated men, a shameful act of groveling
in which he’d been forced to take part because the generals who had cast
those men to their doom felt it beneath their dignity to do so.</p>
<p>Lawrence would come away from his Iraqi sojourn with two abiding
thoughts. One was of the self-defeating arrogance with which the British
Indian army had blundered into the country: “By brute force they marched
into Basra. The enemy troops in Irak [sic] were nearly all Arabs in the
unenviable predicament of having to fight on behalf of their [Turkish]
secular oppressors against a [British] people long envisaged as
liberators, but who obstinately refused to play the part.” Their already
keen sense of superiority swollen by Basra’s easy capture, the British
Indian commanders had been contemptuous of local support, even of the
need for a defendable supply line, and had instead heedlessly marched
their men up the Tigris to ruin. It may have been with the Iraq debacle
in mind that Lawrence would later remark, “British generals often gave
away in stupidity what they had gained in ignorance.”</p>
<p>On a more philosophical level, what Lawrence took from Kut was a
deepening antipathy for the imperialist cause. As he would write in
Seven Pillars, “We pay for these things too much in honour and in
innocent lives. I went up the Tigris with one hundred Devon
Territorials, young, clean, delightful fellows, full of the power of
happiness and of making women and children glad. By them one saw vividly
how great it was to be their kin, and English. And we were casting them
by the thousands into the fire to the worst of deaths, not to win the
war but that the corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia might be ours.…
All our subject provinces to me were not worth one dead Englishman.”</p>
<p>Still, Lawrence was determined that it should not have all been in
vain. During his fourteen-day journey back to Egypt, he composed a long
report on all he had been witness to in Iraq, a scathing critique of
everything from the British Indian army’s docking and warehousing
systems, to the inadequacy of its seniormost generals, to the mindless
stupidity of their battlefield strategies. But this, too, was to be an
effort wasted. After reading Lawrence’s incendiary report and learning
it was to be passed on to General Archibald Murray, the overall
commander of British forces in Egypt, senior officers in the Cairo
military intelligence unit decided it was far too indelicate for the
general’s sensibilities; shortly before the report was to be sent to
Murray, they carefully scissored out all of Lawrence’s most inflammatory
passages, thus ensuring that even now the grim lessons of Kut would stay
unlearned. So thoroughly did the censors do their job that it is
believed only one copy of Lawrence’s original Iraq report survived
intact.</p>
<p>FOR ANYONE SEEKING to justify the web of conflicting agreements that
Great Britain had spun for itself in the Middle East by the spring of
1916, there were actually several strong arguments close at hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious is succinctly conveyed in the old maxim that
all is fair in love and war. By May 1916, the war had already killed
millions of young men across Europe, and the future appeared to promise
only more of the same; if double dealing and unsupportable promises
might inch that conflict toward some kind of conclusion, who could
reasonably argue against it?</p>
<p>There was also a matter of semantics, of how one defined
“independence.” While today the word’s meaning seems obvious and
universal, that was not at all the case in 1916. For many Europeans,
steeped in the condescension of the late imperial age, independence
didn’t mean letting native peoples actually govern themselves, but
something far more paternalistic: a new round of “the white man’s
burden,” the tutoring—and, of course, the exploiting—of native peoples
until they might sufficiently grasp the ways of modern civilization to
stand on their own at some indeterminate point in the future. For those
holding such a view—and this probably included not only a majority of
the senior statesmen of Great Britain but of every other nation in
Europe—the distance between “independence” on the one hand, and
“mandates” or “zones of control” or “suzerainty” on the other, didn’t
appear to be the chasm of contradiction that others saw.</p>
<p>There was also a simple, cynical argument to be made: that the tangle
of competing promises didn’t much matter because it was probably all
going to end up as an academic exercise anyway. Even the most
starry-eyed imperialist had to recognize there was something faintly
ludicrous about Britain and France sitting around and divvying up the
postwar Middle East at a time when, if not outright losing that war,
they certainly weren’t winning it. As for Emir Hussein, he had been
talking about an insurrection against Constantinople since even before
the war, and there was still precious little sign of it happening. In
the unlikely event that both the Arab revolt did come off, and the
Entente did manage to win the war, the complications would be the best
sort of problem to have, one that could be dealt with down the road.</p>
<p>By popular account, on the morning of June 5, 1916, Emir Hussein
climbed to a tower of his palace in Mecca and fired an old musket in the
direction of the city’s Turkish fort. It was the signal to rebellion,
and by the end of that day Hussein’s followers had launched attacks
against a number of Turkish strongpoints across the length of the
Hejaz.</p>
<p>By an odd twist of fate, the westerner who had done more than any
other to bring that revolt to fruition would never learn of it. Shortly
before 5:00 p.m. on that same day, a Royal Navy battleship cruiser, HMS
Hampshire, left its port in northern Scotland to transport War Secretary
Horatio Kitchener to Russia. Less than three hours later, the Hampshire
struck a German mine and quickly sank in high seas. Nearly every man on
board perished, including Kitchener.</p>
<p>Just two weeks earlier, Lawrence had returned from his failed mission
to Iraq to resume his desk job at the Savoy Hotel. His future looked
much like his past: paper-shuffling, mapmaking, writing up strategies
and reports that would never be acted on. Instead, with the news out of
Mecca, he would soon have the war of his dreams, one that would catapult
him into prominence, and then into legend.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-8-the-battle-joined">Chapter 8 The Battle Joined</h4>
<p>The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular troops—and we are
on the side of the dervishes.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, NOVEMBER 3, 1916</p>
<p>To break the tedium of the hot, slow voyage down the Red Sea, the
officers of HMS Lama organized an impromptu pistol-shooting competition
on the afternoon of October 15, 1916, their second day out from Port
Suez. Taking advantage of a calm sea, they lined bottles along one of
the converted merchant steamer’s rails, then gathered by the far rail to
take turns attempting to blast them to pieces.</p>
<p>The activity was not particularly pleasing to the Lama’s most
important passenger, the Oriental secretary to Egypt, Ronald Storrs. He
had hoped for a nap in the torpor following lunch, but found it
impossible amid all the gunfire, especially once the ship officers
advanced to experimenting with a captured Turkish black-powder rifle. “A
detonation about equal to that of an 18-pounder cannon,” Storrs noted in
his diary. “Conceived the idea, for my return, of holding up any
northbound vessel and boarding her.”</p>
<p>One of the standouts in the shooting competition was Storrs’s
traveling companion, T. E. Lawrence, who had taken up target practice as
a hobby during his days at Carchemish and become an expert marksman.
Excepting Lawrence’s fondness for gunplay, Storrs was quite pleased to
have his friend along on this trip. On his two earlier passages down the
Red Sea to Jeddah, the Oriental secretary had despaired at the lack of
interesting company. Already on this one, the “supercerebral” Lawrence
had given him a painstaking tutorial on the Playfair Cipher, an
ingenious cryptographic system as simple to construct as it was hard to
decode, and, as was their habit back in Cairo, the two had spent much of
the rest of the time discussing classical literature and art.</p>
<p>As with Storrs’s earlier trips to Jeddah, this October voyage was a
result of the Arab Revolt, now a little more than four months old.
Having served as a principal conduit between the British government and
Emir Hussein in the laborious negotiations leading up to that event, the
Oriental secretary had been a natural choice to continue in the role
once the battle was joined. By October 1916, however, the Arab Revolt
was fast reaching a crisis point, and it was an open question just how
much longer it might remain a concern to Ronald Storrs or anyone
else.</p>
<p>Testament to its tenuous slapdash nature was the manner in which the
outside world had learned of it in the first place. That had coincided
with Storrs’s first voyage to Arabia in June.</p>
<p>From coded messages secreted out of Mecca, the launch date for the
long-delayed uprising had finally been set for June 16, and so Storrs
had gone across to Jeddah from the Sudan on June 1 to meet up with
Abdullah, the emir’s second son and—should it actually come off—the
rebellion’s chief field commander. Except Abdullah was nowhere to be
found. After dispatching an envoy to Mecca with a request that Abdullah
come to the coast as soon as possible, Storrs had spent the next four
days trolling the Arabian shoreline aboard a British warship looking for
some sign of either Turkish or Arab military activity. The dreary port
towns had appeared even more soporific than usual.</p>
<p>On June 5, the envoy had finally returned from Mecca with a message
from Abdullah. “To the most honoured and respected Mr. Storrs,” the
letter began. “I deeply regret I am unable to meet you personally, but
an urgent need has called me and taken me, so my brother will come to
you with all the news.” That brother was twenty-year-old Zeid, the
youngest of Hussein’s four sons, and Storrs was directed to go to
Samima, a tiny coastal village south of Jeddah, where Zeid would make
his appearance the following morning. Whatever exasperation Storrs felt
over these complications was tempered by a peculiar development:
according to the envoy, the date for the revolt’s launch had been moved
up from June 16 to June 10. The Oriental secretary had long come to
accept that timetables rarely held in the Arab world, but he could
hardly recall an occasion when one had been moved forward.</p>
<p>Yet when finally he made contact with Zeid on the following morning,
the revised launch date now a mere four days away, there was little hint
of urgency. Instead, the cryptic young man had ushered Storrs into his
field tent erected on the beach, where he engaged in extended
pleasantries and chitchat while a retainer prepared coffee. Once the
coffee was served, Zeid handed Storrs an “execrably written” letter from
his father, detailing his plans for the coming revolt, as well as a
request for £70,000 worth of gold to help bankroll the rebel forces.
When Storrs pressed Hussein’s son on precisely how they intended to
defeat the enemy, it became evident that tactical considerations
remained at the rudimentary stage. “We will summon the Turks to
surrender,” Zeid replied, “and shoot them if they refuse.”</p>
<p>The Oriental secretary had barely been able to hide his impatience.
The British had been funneling gold and rifles to Hussein for many
months now, and Storrs had heard these grand plans—plans unblemished by
any attempt at actual execution—for nearly as long; as he and other
British agents had informed Hussein many times, no more funds would be
released until the revolt began. It was when Storrs reiterated this
message on the Samima beach that Zeid finally got around to dropping an
interesting bit of news: “I am then happy to be able to announce to you
that it began yesterday at Medina.”</p>
<p>Hustling Zeid and his chief lieutenant back to the waiting warship,
Storrs settled the two men at a hastily prepared breakfast table on the
afterbridge, where he and the two military intelligence officers who had
accompanied him from Cairo pumped the young sheikh for details. After
alerting Cairo to the news, and quickly composing notes of
congratulation to Hussein and Abdullah, Storrs gathered up whatever
items were close at hand that might provide immediate encouragement to
the rebel leaders: £10,000 worth of gold from the ship’s safe; five
cartons of cigarettes for Faisal and Abdullah, the two smokers in the
family; the promise of a Maxim machine gun, to be delivered in one
week’s time. Lending all this momentous activity a homey touch was the
wanderings of a small desert gazelle, bought in some Red Sea bazaar as a
ship’s mascot, that alternated between pronging the visitors with his
horns in a bid for attention and feeding on whatever cigarettes were
left lying about.</p>
<p>It had taken some time for clear battle lines to be drawn in the
Hejaz. Capitalizing on the element of surprise of the first few days,
Hussein’s rebels quickly overpowered the tiny Turkish force in Mecca
and, with the help of a British naval bombardment, the all-important
port of Jeddah. In Taif, Hussein’s “summer capital” in the mountains
below Mecca, Abdullah’s fighters took possession of the town while
isolating the Turkish garrison of some three hundred troops in their
well-defended fort. Matters didn’t go nearly so well in Medina, the
Hejaz’s largest city. There, the rebels, emboldened by reports of the
quick success in Mecca, had charged into the teeth of a vastly larger
and entrenched Turkish garrison, some ten thousand soldiers, and been
slaughtered by machine-gun and artillery fire. A month into the revolt,
an uneasy stasis had set in, Hussein’s forces firmly in control of Mecca
and Jeddah and several of the smaller southern coastal towns, the Turks
just as firmly in control of the railhead city of Medina, 150 miles to
the north of Mecca, as well as the coastal towns on the Red Sea’s upper
reaches.</p>
<p>From a political standpoint, news of the Arab Revolt had been
joyously received in Cairo and London. Coming on the heels of the
fiascoes at Gallipoli and Kut, here at long last was some good news out
of the Middle East. Most crucially, by virtue of his violent break with
Constantinople, Hussein—both custodian of Islam’s holiest shrines and
one of the Arab world’s most respected leaders—had fairly laid to rest
any lingering fear that the Turks and Germans might finally galvanize
their pan-Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>From a military standpoint, however, the British response was a good
deal more equivocal. Obviously, if the Arab rebels succeeded in tying
down large numbers of Turkish troops in the Arabian Peninsula, that
would help protect the British army’s right flank in an offensive into
Palestine, an operation now in the planning stages in Cairo. On the
other hand, by failing to spark a broader Arab uprising—in Syria and
elsewhere, the Hejaz revolt had been met with a resounding
silence—Hussein’s forces were left extremely vulnerable to a Turkish
counterattack and, given their spotty conduct thus far, unlikely to
prosper in such a contest. In that case, troops and matériel from the
British expeditionary army in Egypt might have to be siphoned off to aid
the rebels at the very moment that the commander of that army, General
Archibald Murray, was jealous to hold every available resource for his
prospective push into Palestine.</p>
<p>And that scenario was to invite a much greater risk, one that might
swiftly turn the Arab Revolt applauded by Britain’s more politically
minded war planners into the stuff of their worst nightmares. That’s
because it was not just the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that, by
Koranic dictate, were off-limits to non-Islamic “infidels”; to only a
slightly lesser degree this held true for the entire Hejaz. A hint of
this had attended Ronald Storrs’s first voyage to Arabia in June, when
Zeid had refused to allow Storrs’s two military intelligence colleagues
to accompany him ashore; instead, the Oriental secretary had been
compelled to come alone. In the following months, Hussein had concocted
a bit of scriptural wiggle room to permit a very small group of British
logistics officers to man a supply operation in the coastal town of
Rabegh, but strictly restricted their presence to the shoreline. To
allow them to venture farther inland, let alone to bring in whole units
of rescuing British Christian soldiers in the event of a major rebel
setback, would be to play directly into the hands of Turkish
propagandists and risk the immolation of all concerned: Hussein no
longer regarded as merely a traitor to the Ottoman Empire but to Islam
as well; Britain’s imperialist, Crusader intentions laid bare before an
enraged Muslim world.</p>
<p>In the face of this dilemma, Britain had tried to work at the
margins, bringing weaponry and gold to the Hejaz rebels through Rabegh,
while ferrying over whatever Muslim troops could readily be
spared—primarily Egyptians, along with a few Syrian and Iraqi
defectors—to provide training and a small on-the-ground presence. That
clearly wasn’t enough, though, and as the summer of 1916 wore on, with
the rebels’ disorganization becoming more apparent and the signs of a
Turkish counteroffensive more imminent, the debate in Cairo and London
between those seeking a broader involvement and those urging continued
caution took on a deepening urgency. Matters were not at all helped by
Emir Hussein. Indeed, well into the autumn he had carried on a version
of this debate all by himself depending on the latest news from the
battlefront, alternately rejecting plans to bring in non-Muslim troops
and pleading that any available troops be sent immediately, periodically
shifting to the middle ground of asking Cairo to keep such troops on
standby for possible intervention down the road.</p>
<p>By October, however, the time for such dithering had come to an end.
The Turkish garrison in Medina was now stronger than at the revolt’s
outset, having been reinforced by rail, and had recently pummeled a
rebel attack force led by Faisal, Hussein’s third son. With Faisal’s
warriors now withdrawn into the mountains, there were clear signs that
the Turks were preparing to march out of Medina with the goal of both
splitting the rebel armies in two and wresting back control of Mecca. In
response to the crisis, and to the increasingly anxious appeals of his
sons from their various battlefronts, Hussein had finally acceded to the
deployment of British troops to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>It was this development that was bringing Ronald Storrs to Jeddah for
the third time. In answer to Hussein’s request, and over the grumblings
of General Murray in Cairo, the British War Committee in London had just
agreed to send a brigade of British troops to the Hejaz—anywhere between
three and five thousand soldiers—along with a fleet of airplanes. For
the Oriental secretary, the opportunity to be the bearer of good news,
together with the companionship of T. E. Lawrence, at least partially
compensated for the growing distaste he felt for these tedious voyages
and for the town of Jeddah itself.</p>
<p>Lawrence had been quite aware of the intense debate that the Arab
Revolt had spawned in the upper reaches of the British war machine over
the previous months. That awareness came both from his perch within the
Cairo intelligence apparatus—the revolt had begun less than two weeks
after his return from Iraq—and from his friendship with Storrs. Still,
with his area of expertise centered squarely on Syria, he’d remained
very much on the outside of these deliberations. In fact, by the time he
joined Storrs on the Lama that October, his chief contribution to the
Hejaz effort could hardly have been more prosaic: postage stamps.</p>
<p>In thinking of how to counteract Turkey’s blanket silence on the Arab
Revolt in its early days, Storrs had struck upon the idea of issuing
“Republic of Hejaz” postage stamps, a cheap and effective way to prove
to the outside world that a break had occurred. When he’d asked Emir
Hussein for a suitably Islamic design, however, the resulting sketch
bore an eerie resemblance to an English lighthouse. Storrs had then
enlisted the help of his most learned Arabist friend, Lawrence, and the
two spent a leisurely afternoon wandering the Arab Museum in Cairo
selecting suitable motifs. Since, as Storrs related, “it was quickly
apparent that Lawrence already possessed or had immediately assimilated
a complete working technique of philatelic and three-colour
reproduction,” the Oriental secretary placed his friend in charge of
getting the stamps made.</p>
<p>The postage stamp project coincided with a particularly trying time
for Lawrence. Ever since coming to Cairo, he and the other eccentrics in
Stewart Newcombe’s tiny political intelligence unit at the Savoy had
been officially attached to the resident Egyptian army, an arrangement
Lawrence was quite happy with since the alternative was to fall under
the umbrella of the ponderous and fiercely hierarchical structure of
General Murray’s Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), the “regular” army
tasked to take the war to the Turks. However, as part of a bureaucratic
reorganization that summer—one of a half dozen wartime reorganizations
of the British administration in Cairo that sowed chaos each
time—Lawrence had been transferred into an intelligence unit wholly
under EEF control. Worse, the reassignment placed Lawrence under the
direction of a commanding officer he had little respect for, and
required he leave Cairo for the sleepy Suez Canal port town of Ismailia.
Lawrence had swiftly requested a transfer back to “the Intrusives” (the
name the Savoy Hotel unit had chosen for itself in recognition of their
repute within the military bureaucracy), but been just as swiftly
denied. “I interpreted this,” Lawrence wrote, “not without some friendly
evidence, as a method of keeping me away from the Arab affair.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence was nothing if not resourceful, and he had next thought
to put one of his more pronounced personality traits to good use: the
ability to annoy. With his new colleagues in Ismailia, he noted, “I took
every opportunity to run into them their comparative ignorance and
inefficiency in the department of intelligence (not difficult!) and
irritated them yet further by literary airs, correcting Shavian split
infinitives and tautologies in their reports.”</p>
<p>The strategy worked. In late September 1916, upon learning of Ronald
Storrs’s upcoming voyage to Jeddah, Lawrence requested a ten-day leave
from his new post, which his aggravated superiors were only too happy to
grant. In just this way, and in no official capacity save entourage to
Ronald Storrs, Lawrence set sail for Arabia for the first time.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn on October 16, the Lama entered the wide bay of
Jeddah harbor and made for the port on its sheltered far shore. In the
early sun, Lawrence observed only light and shadow among the buildings
of that town, while beyond it was “the dazzle of league after league of
featureless sand.” As the steamer approached its berth, he was to
experience that phenomenon common to most who approach Arabia from the
water, that moment when the sea-cooled air abruptly collides with that
blowing off the land. As Lawrence would write, it was at that instant
when “the heat of Arabia came out like a drawn sword and struck us
speechless.”</p>
<p>IT WAS AN awkward meeting papered over with British politeness.
Coming off the Lama in midmorning, Storrs and Lawrence made the short
walk through Jeddah’s narrow streets to the handsome three-story
building that housed the British consulate, there to be greeted by the
resident British agent, Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Wilson. Wilson led his
visitors into a cool and pleasingly shuttered reception room—it was not
yet ten o’clock, but the whitewashed buildings of Jeddah already
radiated a blinding glare—and ordered up refreshments.</p>
<p>Ronald Storrs had long acquaintance with the slender, mustachioed
Wilson, a career army officer previously attached to the British
administration in the Sudan, but time had done nothing to improve his
opinion of the man. He found Wilson dull and irritable, with a hint of
the hysteric—“totally unsuited for anything beyond provincial
administration,” he’d once written—and thus completely out of his depth
in the important position he’d assumed in July, that of British
representative to Emir Hussein’s Hejaz “government.” In fact, the chief
reason Storrs hadn’t raised his objections to Wilson more forcefully
back in Cairo was out of mortal fear that should the man be sacked,
Storrs himself might be sent to Jeddah as his replacement.</p>
<p>For his part, Wilson seemed to resent these visits by the Oriental
secretary, the automatic deference shown him by Emir Hussein and his
emissaries while he, the officer on the ground, saw to all the
frustrating and thankless spadework of British policy.</p>
<p>There was also a bit of history between Wilson and Lawrence. Some
months earlier in Cairo, the lieutenant colonel had spotted Lawrence
wearing an Arab headdress while in uniform, and soundly rebuked him for
the offense. There was little indication the intelligence officer had
taken the criticisms of his appearance to heart in the interim, however,
judging by the sweat-stained uniform with which Lawrence had arrived at
the consulate door.</p>
<p>Still, all those in the reception room being British, none of this
friction was voiced or even acknowledged. Instead, Storrs and Wilson
feigned collegiality as they discussed the current situation in the
Hejaz and that day’s schedule. In adherence to Arab custom, the first
order of business was for them to pay a courtesy call on Sheikh
Abdullah, encamped some four miles out of town, as prelude to a more
substantive meeting to be held that evening at the consulate. Leaving
Lawrence to his own devices, the two senior men set out on horseback for
Abdullah’s camp in late morning.</p>
<p>When the trio reconvened at the mission building in early afternoon,
however, it was to unpleasant news. A cable had arrived from Cairo
announcing that, upon further reflection, the War Committee had chosen
to recall both the brigade of British troops and the fleet of airplanes
slated for imminent arrival in Rabegh. To add insult to injury, the
£10,000 of gold that Storrs had brought with him on the Lama for
disbursement to Abdullah was to be at least temporarily withheld. After
their morning visit to Abdullah, during which Storrs and Wilson were the
recipients of lavish Arab hospitality, they quite dreaded the sheikh’s
impending visit to the consulate.</p>
<p>Accompanied by his elaborately costumed court retainers and slaves,
Abdullah arrived shortly after five o’clock. Lawrence’s first impression
was of a particularly jolly man—perhaps heightened just then by
Abdullah’s recent success in the city of Taif, where the long-resistant
Turkish garrison had at last surrendered—with a touch of the voluptuary;
though he was not yet thirty-five, the sheikh’s face was already taking
on the rounded form of one who enjoyed his pleasures and indulged his
appetites. His jollity didn’t last long. Dispensing with the elaborate
pleasantries that normally accompanied such meetings, no sooner had
Abdullah and his chief lieutenants settled in the consulate reception
room than Wilson began reading aloud from the Cairo cable as Storrs
translated into Arabic. Abdullah listened with a hard-to-read
stoicism.</p>
<p>Once the reading was finished, Abdullah began to plead his case to
Storrs, a turn in the conversation the Oriental secretary tried to
forestall by explaining he had absolutely no authority in military
matters. It was more than a little disingenuous coming from the man who
had penned the secret overture to Hussein back in 1914, and for the
first time, the Britons in the room were witness to a flash of
Abdullah’s temper. “Pardon me,” he interrupted, “it was your letter and
your messages that began this thing with us, and you know it from the
beginning, and from before the beginning.”</p>
<p>Duly chastened, Storrs and his two countrymen mutely listened as
their visitor delivered a long soliloquy on the current grim state of
affairs in the Hejaz and the signal role Great Britain had played in
bringing it about. “He gave a fairly accurate historical summary of the
negotiations,” Storrs ruefully noted in his diary, “quoting several
times [His Majesty’s Government’s] promise that we would do everything
possible to help the Arabs.”</p>
<p>The conversation lasted for a couple of hours, Abdullah outlining all
his current difficulties, Storrs and Wilson promising to do all in their
limited power to get this latest decision reversed. Toward the meeting’s
conclusion, the sheikh turned to the task he clearly wished to avoid:
calling his father to break the news. The consulate telephone was
brought out and a call put through to Emir Hussein’s private line, Mecca
1.</p>
<p>To Storrs’s surprise, the emir seemed to take the disappointment
rather in stride, stating once again his full confidence in his British
partners and his faith that all would work out in the end. When at last
Abdullah departed from the mission building that evening, with plans
made for his return the next morning, he left his British hosts, as
Storrs would relate, “in a state of admiration for him and disgust with
ourselves.”</p>
<p>One person who had spoken very little through that long, tense
meeting—indeed, he may not have spoken at all—was T. E. Lawrence. Part
of the reason was obvious: he had no official capacity in being there,
and for him to offer an unsolicited opinion at such a delicate encounter
would have been a shocking breach of protocol. At the same time, this
remove allowed Lawrence to spend the time closely studying Abdullah—or
as he himself described it, “playing for effect, watching, criticizing
him.”</p>
<p>If Emir Hussein was the undisputed spiritual leader of the Arab
Revolt, Abdullah was its undisputed field marshal; so manifest was this
point that among the British military officers and diplomats involved in
the Hejaz affair, it had barely even come up for discussion. Abdullah
was his father’s most trusted son, the emissary he had sent to Cairo in
1914 to sound out the British over his secessionist plans, the military
commander who had seen to the capture of Taif, the family representative
who sat down and negotiated with their British advisors.</p>
<p>Yet even at this first meeting, Lawrence had his doubts. Despite the
somberness of the conversation at the consulate, he suspected in
Abdullah “a constant cheerfulness,” the mien of an astute politician but
not necessarily a sincere one, a man of overwhelming ambition. But there
was more to it than that. In poring over the intelligence reports coming
out of the Hejaz over the previous four months, Lawrence had tried to
analyze why the revolt had settled into dismal stasis after such a
promising start. He had concluded that, at its core, what the rebellion
lacked was true leadership, “not intellect, nor judgment, nor political
wisdom, but the flame of enthusiasm that would set the desert on fire.”
What it needed was a prophet, and as that meeting at the consulate had
extended, “I became more and more sure that Abdullah was too balanced,
too cool, too humourous to be a prophet—especially the armed prophet
who, if history be true, succeeded in revolutions.”</p>
<p>All of which, had Lawrence voiced these thoughts to his senior
colleagues, might have drawn an obvious response: who cares what you
think? But Lawrence didn’t voice them. Instead, it seems clear that
already by the evening of October 16, not yet in Arabia a half day, he
had taken it upon himself to calculate a new course for the Arab Revolt,
one that would cast him in a central role. That role, as he described it
in a moment of profound self-certainty—or breath-catching arrogance,
depending on one’s perspective—was “to find the yet unknown
master-spirit of the affair, and measure his capacity to carry the
revolt to the goal I had conceived for it.” For any of that to happen,
though, would require stealth on Lawrence’s part, an ability to keep his
own counsel and to quietly look for those openings that might allow him
to pursue his agenda. Over the course of that meeting with Abdullah,
Lawrence had found his first opening, one he would try to exploit as
early as the following morning.</p>
<p>But that long day of October 16, 1916, was not yet over. Before it
was, Lawrence was to encounter another personality whose presence loomed
large over the Hejaz, one who, by negative example, would soon further
clarify the mission Lawrence was creating for himself.</p>
<p>TOWARD THE END of the dinner at the French mission house in Jeddah,
Colonel Édouard Brémond raised his champagne glass in toast to his
British guests. “I have just heard,” he announced, “that my only male
relation up till now not killed or wounded in the war has been seriously
injured. It is thus my duty and my pride to drink to the Alliance, and
to say how much pleasure it gives me to be associated with
Englishmen.”</p>
<p>That poignant moment on the night of October 16 left a deep
impression on Ronald Storrs. “The un-French absence of panache in his
delivery was very striking. I drank to his cousin’s recovery and the
success of the French Mission.”</p>
<p>Now settled into a somewhat portly middle age, the forty-seven-year-
old Brémond was the exemplar of the French imperial soldier, guided by
an unwavering belief in both his nation’s greatness and the
righteousness of its mission civilisatrice, or “civilizing mission,” to
spread Gallic enlightenment and culture to the world’s disadvantaged.
For most of his military career, he had served in France’s North African
possessions, Algeria and then Morocco, and from his experiences battling
rebellious tribes had gained the reputation of being an expert in
irregular warfare. Promotion came steadily if unspectacularly:
supervisor of the Moroccan ports police, deputy head of the French
military mission to Morocco, administrator of the city of Rabat.</p>
<p>In the run‑up to World War I, Brémond had been recalled to France and
rushed to the front. As with so many of the French officer class in that
horrific first month of the war, Brémond’s tenure there was pitifully
brief, ending when he was shot through the chest while leading his men
into battle on the Belgian frontier. After recuperating from his wounds,
he was given command of an infantry regiment, the 64th, where for the
next two years he watched his military comrades, as well as his male
relatives, fall one by one to the Western Front slaughter. A release of
sorts presented itself in the summer of 1916 with the outbreak of the
Arab Revolt. In deciding to send a small military mission to the region,
the French Defense Ministry had looked to Brémond—“a practicing light in
native warfare, a success in French Africa”—and seen the perfect man to
lead it.</p>
<p>In fact, the colonel was the ideal candidate for reasons that went
beyond his long experience in the Muslim world. As with so many of its
actions in the Middle Eastern theater of the war, there was a hidden
agenda to the French mission to the Hejaz, one that required both
cunning and deviousness to execute. By good luck, these traits were very
well honed in Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Arabs to revolt had of course been a British
operation from the outset, and one that had made the French leadership,
with their imperial designs on Syria and Lebanon, very nervous when
they’d caught wind of it. Their concerns had been eased by the signing
of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement, codifying their Middle Eastern
claims, but had come rushing back when the Arab Revolt became a reality.
All talk of the Entente Cordiale aside, the French simply didn’t trust
their British allies to stand by their promises in the region, and with
the revolt in the Hejaz, they had now unleashed a revolutionary force
that might not be containable even if the British so desired. French
anxiety had only deepened when their proposal to send a token military
force to the region, a way to protect their future claim and monitor
events on the ground, was politely but firmly rebuffed by the British;
the situation in the Hejaz was so fluid and delicate, London had argued,
that the introduction of another foreign military presence just then
could only complicate matters.</p>
<p>So the French pursued a Trojan horse approach instead. The
two-hundred-man military unit that sailed out of Marseilles harbor under
Colonel Brémond’s command in August 1916 was officially titled the
French military mission to Egypt. The British couldn’t very well bar
such a mission from its closest ally, even if it begged the question of
just what the French soldiers intended to do in Egypt. To this, Colonel
Brémond had a ready answer: to facilitate the passage of Muslim pilgrims
from French territories, primarily Morocco and Algeria, seeking to make
the hajj to Mecca. The British couldn’t very well object to this either,
since their army and navy were already providing escort for thousands of
Egyptians and Indian Muslims making their own pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>It had been the last step in this little scheme that even the British
had to grudgingly admire for its audacity. Accompanying a group of
Moroccan pilgrims to Jeddah in mid-September, Brémond had disembarked,
seen to the rental of a suitably impressive building, and announced the
arrival of the French military mission to the Hejaz. In short order, he
fired off a cable to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the
establishment of a permanent diplomatic mission to Hussein’s
administration. When that request was approved, the French military and
diplomatic presence in Arabia was technically equal to that of the
British, a fait accompli that London found quite impossible to
counteract; after all, Paris could argue, here was the opportunity for
the two great allies to jointly plan for the region’s future on a basis
of equality, a course sure to only broaden their eternal bonds of
friendship. This was the situation facing Storrs and Lawrence when they
arrived in Jeddah in mid-October.</p>
<p>But Brémond’s cunning was not limited to the shell game he had
executed in establishing his Hejaz mission; it extended to the goal of
the mission itself. As he expounded during that dinner at the French
consulate on October 16, his overt role in the Hejaz was to show French
support for the Arab Revolt, and to ascertain how France might be able
to assist it. His covert role, however, was to try to limit the scope of
that revolt, to keep it and its aspirations for an Arab nation well away
from those Arab lands that France coveted in the postwar era. As for how
that might be done, Brémond had a neat, if supremely cynical, plan.</p>
<p>Above all else, he explained to his British guests that night, the
Arabs must not be allowed to take Medina. So long as the Turkish
garrison there held out, and so long as the Arabs concentrated their
blood and treasure on seizing it, the rebellion would remain safely
bottled up in the Hejaz. Should Medina fall, he warned, then the Arabs
would naturally turn their attention to the north, to liberating from
the Turkish yoke their Arab brethren in Palestine and Syria and Iraq, a
campaign that would inevitably conflict with British and French imperial
designs in the region.</p>
<p>It was cold-blooded perhaps, but a strategy quite brilliant in its
simplicity: while trying to help a foreign rebellion succeed was always
an iffy proposition, arranging for it to not succeed was infinitely
easier.</p>
<p>Yet at that dinner at the French consulate, Colonel Brémond was
laboring under at least two great misconceptions. The first was that
this element of connivance—of lending support to the Arab Revolt as a
means to hobble it—was actually necessary. If Brémond had known of the
Sykes-Picot Agreement, with its promise of a French Syria and Lebanon,
he might have been far more sanguine over the future course of the Arab
Revolt. But Sykes-Picot was known to only a very small handful of French
government officials, and this group did not include those midlevel
military and foreign ministry bureaucrats tasked to defend France’s
claims in the Middle East. Incredibly, this information had also been
withheld from the man sent to Arabia to serve as the frontline guardian
of those claims.</p>
<p>Brémond’s second misconception was in assuming that, as he held forth
to his British guests that evening, he was among friends—or at least,
like-minded imperialists. He was not, and he most especially was not of
the young British captain who sat at the dining table and barely spoke.
As Brémond was soon to discover, in T. E. Lawrence he had a very
formidable opponent. What’s more, advantage had just passed to Lawrence.
At the French consulate, Brémond had laid his hand bare; Lawrence had
revealed nothing.</p>

‘phalanx’ in the sentence?</a></h5>
<p>PRECEDED BY A phalanx of slaves, Abdullah rode on a white mare into
the courtyard of the British consulate at about ten o’clock the
following morning. He was more somber than the day before, and once
settled into the consulate reception room, he explained why. He had just
received a cable from his brother Faisal at his mountain encampment
north of Rabegh reporting that two Turkish warplanes had bombed his camp
the previous afternoon; while inflicting little damage, they had sown
terror among the tribesmen, most of whom had never seen such machines
before. The news was especially pointed, considering the attack came on
the same day the British had canceled plans to send their own fleet of
airplanes to Arabia.</p>
<p>This drew a response from Lawrence, who suggested that this Turkish
show of force shouldn’t be cause for much alarm. “Very few Turkish
airplanes last more than four or five days,” he breezily explained.</p>
<p>It was probably with this comment that Abdullah truly took notice of
Lawrence—a mere background presence the previous day—for the first time.
He soon had reason to take even greater notice when the conversation
turned to a discussion on the location of various Turkish forces around
the Middle East. “As Syrian, Circassian, Anatolian, Mesopotamian names
came up,” Ronald Storrs recalled, “Lawrence at once stated exactly which
[Turkish] unit was in each position, until Abdullah turned to me in
amazement: ‘Is this man God, to know everything?’”</p>
<p>In his memoirs, Storrs attributed his friend’s remarkable performance
that morning to happy coincidence stemming from Lawrence’s labors in the
Cairo mapmaking room. Perhaps, or perhaps Lawrence was merely bluffing.
Either way, the effect was the same, and it provided Lawrence with the
platform to roll out his scheme.</p>
<p>The chief difficulty the British faced in assisting the Arab Revolt,
he explained to Abdullah, was a lack of reliable information on what was
actually taking place on the ground. What was needed was an objective
observer, one who could gain the ear of senior British war planners, to
provide a comprehensive report on the situation, both on the problems
that seemed to be plaguing the supply pipeline in the port town of
Rabegh and on the logistical needs of Faisal’s forces in the mountains
to the north. Since time was clearly of the essence, Lawrence put
himself forth as the man who might carry out this mission.</p>
<p>It was an innocuous enough proposal, and one Abdullah immediately
agreed to, suggesting that once Lawrence was in Rabegh, he would arrange
for Faisal to come down from the mountains to meet with him. To this,
Lawrence politely demurred. He needed to appraise the situation inland
for himself, which meant he needed to go to Faisal, not the other way
around. Given the stricture against non-Muslims traveling to the
interior, it was a bold request. Even Cyril Wilson, who had met Faisal
twice and whom Emir Hussein greatly respected, had only been permitted
to step down at port towns and wait for Faisal’s appearance.</p>
<p>With Storrs joining in the lobbying effort, Abdullah was gradually
won over to the idea—no doubt the current tenuousness of the Arab
position had a loosening effect—but the ultimate decision rested with
the more formidable Hussein. As Abdullah expected, his father was
extremely ambivalent to the plan when he was called on the Mecca trunk
line, spurring Storrs to take command of the telephone receiver.</p>
<p>“Storrs in full blast was a delight to listen to in the mere matter
of Arabic speech,” Lawrence would recall, “and also a lesson to every
Englishman alive of how to deal with suspicious or unwilling Orientals.
It was nearly impossible to resist him for more than a few minutes, and
in this case [he] also had his way.”</p>
<p>But it was a qualified victory. The most Hussein would allow was for
Lawrence to put in at Rabegh, and there to meet with his eldest son,
Ali; if Ali “thought fit,” he would then arrange Lawrence’s onward
journey to meet Faisal. It was not at all hard to see how this was going
to end up. Ali had a reputation for caution, and for the cautious, the
default answer is always no. Storrs and Lawrence resolved to push the
matter when Abdullah returned to the British consulate for dinner that
evening.</p>
<p>At that dinner, Storrs and Lawrence urged Abdullah to write formal
letters of introduction to Ali and Faisal, figuring this would greatly
enhance the odds of Lawrence being given permission to travel inland.
This Abdullah was initially very reluctant to do, but, gaining his
father’s approval over the telephone line, Lawrence recounted, Abdullah
finally penned “direct written instructions to Ali to mount me as well
and as quickly as possible, and convey me, by sure hand, to Faisal’s
camp.”</p>
<p>Early on the morning of October 19, HMS Lama put into Rabegh harbor.
For the rest of his life, an image would stick in Ronald Storrs’s mind
of Lawrence standing on the pier and waving goodbye as Storrs’s ship
turned and made for Egypt. Lawrence’s Arabian adventure had begun.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE’S HUNCH ABOUT Ali proved absolutely correct; the eldest
Hussein son was staggered when he was handed the letter from Abdullah
dictating their father’s permission for the young British army captain
to travel inland. However, with the fealty with which all the Hussein
sons showed their father, Ali saw no choice but to acquiesce, and he set
about arranging Lawrence’s journey.</p>
<p>Situated at the edge of a broad desert plain, the nondescript little
port of Rabegh seemed an unlikely spot to hold anyone’s attention for
very long, let alone to be the strategic linchpin in the war for control
of the Arabian Peninsula. Yet, situated midway between Mecca and Medina,
Rabegh was a crucial way station on the “pilgrims’ road”—little more
than a camel track marked by stone cairns—that linked those two holy
cities, which meant it stood squarely in the path of any Turkish army
moving south to retake Mecca. Rabegh was also the chief transshipment
point for British supplies and weaponry coming down from Egypt to be
distributed to the rebels fighting inland—or not distributed, merely
vanishing somewhere en route, as more often seemed to be the case.</p>
<p>If Rabegh was not the most appealing place, the two and a half days
Lawrence spent there did provide him with the chance to meet two more of
Emir Hussein’s sons, and to submit them to the same sort of character
study he had performed on Abdullah in Jeddah.</p>
<p>By coincidence, Zeid, the youngest, had recently arrived to help Ali
sort out the supply-line problems. A half brother to Hussein’s other
three sons, Zeid was a handsome youth of twenty, who had inherited the
pale complexion and softer features of his Turkish mother. Although he
was clearly quite intelligent, both his youth and non-Arab appearance
would have made him an unlikely rebel commander even if he possessed
leadership traits, which he did not. “Is fond of riding about and
playing tricks,” Lawrence noted. “Humorous in outlook, and perhaps a
little better balanced, because less intense, than his brothers.
Shy.”</p>
<p>Despite the strained circumstances of their first meeting, Lawrence
took a quick liking to Ali. “His manner was dignified and admirable, but
direct,” he wrote, “and he struck me as a pleasant gentleman,
conscientious.” But there was a forlorn, tired air to Hussein’s eldest
son, his skin sallow, his mouth “sad and drooping,” that made him seem
far older than his thirty-seven years. Without apparent ambition for
himself, Lawrence observed, Ali also seemed to fall under the sway of
whatever more dynamic personality happened to be nearby, hardly the
hallmark of a natural leader. Still, Lawrence much preferred Ali to
Abdullah, noting that “if Faisal should turn out to be no prophet, the
revolt would make shift well enough with Ali for its head.” Perhaps, but
it was a make-do assessment that considerably raised the stakes for
Lawrence’s meeting with Faisal.</p>
<p>He set out for that meeting on the night of October 21. Indicative of
Ali’s abiding concern over the journey—part of the hundred-mile trek
would be through areas controlled by tribes hostile to the revolt—were
the elaborate precautions he’d taken, keeping news of Lawrence’s
departure and destination secret from even his closest household slaves.
To serve as Lawrence’s guides, he had chosen two of his most trusted
lieutenants, a father and son who, by the unwritten law of the Arabian
tribes, were expected to lay down their lives to protect their charge.
Ali further directed the three men to avoid all settlements along the
route and to travel at night as much as possible, even that Lawrence
wear a headdress over his army uniform so as to cast a sufficiently
Arab-looking silhouette in the moonlight.</p>
<p>The potential for danger notwithstanding, very soon after setting out
Lawrence’s preoccupation turned to the more mundane, the grinding
physical discomfort of riding a camel again after two years sitting
behind a desk at the Savoy Hotel. Since its pronounced and narrow spine
lies just below the skin, riding a camel is a wholly different
experience from riding a horse, more akin to sitting atop a swaying
metal rod. Even the best Bedouin saddle—little more than a
wood-and-leather frame covered in blankets—can only slightly dull the
pain for the green rider. Most such riders can rarely withstand the
suffering for more than two or three hours without a break, but Lawrence
was to have no such luxury on this journey; instead, what lay before him
was an ordeal of some thirty hours in the saddle broken only by two
short breaks. He spurred himself on by summoning the extraordinary
endurance he had shown in the past—on his bicycle tours of France, on
his twelve-hundred-mile hike through Syria—and by holding the thought
that at the other end awaited the last of the Hussein brothers, the man
who might prove to be his “prophet” of war.</p>
<p>Despite his discomfort—or maybe as a way to distract from it—Lawrence
made a careful study of the terrain they were crossing, jotting down
notes in his small army-issue notebook as he rode. He was traversing a
land only a handful of outsiders had ever glimpsed, one steeped in a
desert culture little changed in millennia, but with just enough
similarities to the Syria he knew so well as to be thoroughly
disorienting. In Syria he had made a hobby of sorting out the
complicated clan and tribal structures, the complex rules that governed
their interaction, but in Arabia all those rules were far more layered,
far more rigidly upheld.</p>
<p>“Each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged
owner,” he wrote, “and [who] would quickly assert the right of his
family or clan to it against aggression. Even the wells and trees had
their masters, who allowed men to make firewood of the one and drink of
the other freely, as much as was required for their need, but who would
instantly check anyone trying to turn the property to account.… The
desert was held in a crazed communism by which Nature and the elements
were for the free use of every known friendly person for his own
purposes and no more.”</p>
<p>In Syria, the price for transgression was most often ostracism,
perhaps the handing over of a sheep in fine; in the sere and harsh
landscape of Arabia, it was death.</p>
<p>But if still the amateur anthropologist, Lawrence was also taking
note of the topography of the Hejaz through the eyes of a military man:
where sources of water might be found, the trails an army might navigate
to best advantage. In this way, he happened upon a glaring hole in his
own army’s contingency plans.</p>
<p>In preparing for the defense of Rabegh—which by definition also meant
the defense of Mecca—British officers advising the rebels had mapped out
the Turks’ most likely approaches, ones predicated on the existence of
trails and the supply of water, and overseen the building of outlying
guardposts accordingly. Yet on his journey to Faisal’s camp, Lawrence
came upon two seasonal watercourses that didn’t appear on any British
maps, and that would allow an attacking army to either fall on Rabegh
from an unforeseen direction or to sidestep the port town completely on
its way to Mecca. How had the British advisors, who had now been in
Rabegh for three months, remained ignorant of these watercourses, and
why had the local Arabs, who surely knew of them, not raised the alarm?
Quite simply, because quarantined as they were on the shoreline, the
British hadn’t been aware enough of their surroundings to formulate the
question, and without the question, the Arabs hadn’t been aware enough
of British concerns to offer the information. To Lawrence, it
underscored both the difficulty in trying to marry two such very
different cultures for the purpose of making war, and the potential for
disaster in Hussein’s stricture against nonbelievers traveling inland;
no matter how many British troops were brought over, so long as they
were isolated on the coast, in their ability to gauge danger they might
as well be in blindfolds.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon of October 23, Lawrence’s party rounded a wall
of high stone cliffs to suddenly find themselves in the verdant valley
of Wadi Safra, the refuge for Faisal’s rebel army that had so recently
been humbled outside Medina. As they ascended toward the headwaters,
Lawrence began to see small encampments of armed men scattered among the
hillside villages, camps that steadily grew in size and proliferation
until they seemed to fill most every level stretch of land.</p>
<p>At last the party entered Hamra, a village of about one hundred
homes, and drew up before a long, low house where a sword-wielding slave
stood guard. Dismounting from his camel, Lawrence was admitted into the
inner courtyard to see the profile of a man standing in the far doorway.
“[He] looked very tall and pillar-like,” he wrote, “very slender, in his
long white silk robes and his brown headcloth bound with a brilliant
scarlet and gold cord. His eyelids were drooped, and his black beard and
colorless face were like a mask against the strange, still watchfulness
of his body.”</p>
<p>It was Faisal ibn Hussein. As Lawrence would later write in Seven
Pillars of Wisdom, “I felt at first glance that this was the man I had
come to Arabia to seek, the leader who would bring the Arab Revolt to
full glory.”</p>
<p>MAYBE, BUT IN actual fact, their initial meeting did not go well.
Ushered into the home, Lawrence joined Faisal and a dozen or so other
men, chieftains of various tribes that had joined the revolt, in a dimly
lit room covered with carpets. As did his brothers, Faisal possessed a
courtly graciousness, and he thanked Lawrence for making the long and
difficult journey to visit him. This preamble soon gave way, though, to
a more somber discussion of his recent string of military setbacks at
the hands of the Turks.</p>
<p>Of Hussein’s sons, Faisal and his followers had borne the greatest
amount of fighting since the start of the revolt, and had done so while
receiving the least in the way of supplies and funds. Most recently, he
explained to his visitor, his men had been on the verge of a great
victory at Bir Abbas, on Medina’s outskirts. Instead, for lack of
artillery to counteract that brought to bear by the Turks, his army had
foundered and then been scattered. The remnants of that army—many had
peeled away and returned to their homes—were now encamped there with him
in the mountain safeness of Hamra, awaiting the Turks’ next move. That
was how things stood. Properly supplied and armed, Faisal contended, his
men were capable of anything, but if the current situation persisted,
where they had to beg the British for every ounce of matériel—most of
which never reached the front lines anyway—then the future course of the
uprising was already written. When the Turks came out of their
stronghold in Medina and marched for the coast, a march that now seemed
imminent, it would leave Faisal with the choice of either being stranded
in the mountains or beating a retreat back toward Mecca. The first
option would mean slow annihilation, the second rapid disintegration,
for just as had occurred after Bir Abbas, many of his followers would
refuse to flee so far away from their tribal areas—they would just go
home.</p>
<p>Even as he listened, Lawrence intently studied Faisal, looking for
clues to both his personality and the nature of the hold he had over the
other men crowded into the room. “He was a man of moods,” he noted,
“flickering between glory and despair, and just now dead tired. He
looked years older than thirty-one, and his dark, appealing eyes, set a
little sloping in his face, were bloodshot, and his hollow cheeks deeply
lined and puckered with reflection.… In appearance he was tall, graceful
and vigorous, with the most beautiful gait, and a royal dignity of head
and shoulders. Of course he knew it, and a great part of his public
expression was by sign and gesture.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was also Faisal’s exhaustion that caused him to speak far
more bluntly than his brothers had of the element of distrust that lay
at the core of the Arabs’ relationship with Britain, a distrust
reflected in everything from Hussein’s tortuous two-year negotiation
with Storrs and McMahon to the restricting of British advisors to the
coast. Since history clearly showed the British didn’t help others out
of the goodness of their heart, Faisal asked, just what was it they
wanted of the Hejaz?</p>
<p>As many other British officers had done with other members of
Hussein’s Hashemite clan, in the dimly lit home in Hamra, Lawrence
patiently reassured Faisal that the British had absolutely no
territorial interests in the Hejaz. That assurance lost some of its
luster, Faisal pointed out, when it was recalled that the British had
said precisely the same thing about the Sudan before grabbing it.</p>
<p>Their somewhat prickly conversation extended through dinner, then
started up again at 6:30 the next morning when Faisal showed up at
Lawrence’s tent. In these talks, Lawrence found Hussein’s third son to
be “most unreasonable,” and yet there was something about the passion
with which he spoke, the hard determination behind it, that Lawrence
found profoundly compelling. It was a passion he’d found lacking in both
Abdullah or Ali, and it fueled his conviction that in Faisal he had
found his leader.</p>
<p>That conviction was strengthened when Lawrence spent several hours
that day wandering among the rebel encampments, falling into
conversation with whoever crossed his path. One of the first things that
struck him was the range of tribes they represented. In the
ever-fractious world of Arabia, rare was the man who could unite even
the various tribes and clans in his immediate area, but here in Wadi
Safra were thousands of men representing nearly every tribal group
across the breadth of the western Hejaz, some a full two weeks’ journey
away from their homelands. Even more remarkable, this was an army that
had been put to flight by the Turks just a week earlier, and yet their
morale and confidence in ultimate victory seemed utterly unshaken. The
man who had molded that unity and spurred that confidence was
Faisal.</p>
<p>That evening, having been in Wadi Safra for only slightly more than
twenty-four hours, Lawrence stopped by Faisal’s headquarters to say
goodbye. Their parting conversation was more relaxed than those of
earlier, with Faisal thanking Lawrence for coming and Lawrence holding
out the vague hope that perhaps his trip would prove of some benefit.
With that, he mounted a new camel and, with a squad of fourteen warriors
as bodyguards, made for the nearest rebel-held Red Sea port, the town of
Yenbo, where a British ship might collect him for his return to Egypt.
He was anxious to get there, for he was now firmly convinced that in
Faisal ibn Hussein the revolt had found its prophet. “It was all and
more than we had hoped for,” he wrote, “much more than our halting
course deserved. The aim of my trip was fulfilled.”</p>
<h4 id="chapter-9-the-man-who-would-be-kingmaker">Chapter 9 The Man Who
Would Be Kingmaker</h4>
<p>[Faisal] is hot tempered, proud and impatient, sometimes unreasonable
and runs off easily at tangents. Possesses far more personal magnetism
and life than his brothers, but less prudence. Obviously very clever,
perhaps not over scrupulous … Had he been brought up the wrong way might
have become a barrack yard officer. A popular idol, and ambitious; full
of dreams, and the capacity to realize them.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE ON FAISAL IBN HUSSEIN, OCTOBER 30, 1916</p>
<p>Doggedness and good luck had made Lawrence’s visit to the Hejaz an
extraordinarily successful one. In a mere ten days, he had met all four
of Emir Hussein’s sons, as well as the principal Allied envoys in
Jeddah. He had also seen firsthand the British efforts at establishing a
supply line for the rebels at Rabegh, and been the first outsider to
journey inland for a look at the actual battlefront. Now, as he rode
into Yenbo on the morning of October 26, 1916, he was anxious to get
back to Cairo to report on his findings.</p>
<p>In that dusty little port town, however, his fortunes suddenly
flagged. A British warship had been scheduled to make a Yenbo port of
call, but the appointed day came and went with no sign of it. With no
choice but to wait—for a total of five days, it would turn out—Lawrence
took up quarters in a modest three-story house overlooking the tiny
waterfront, the home of Faisal’s local liaison officer, and there set to
work writing up the impressions of his journey. In his usual crabbed
hand, and with only a blue fountain pen and some scrap paper by way of
supplies, over the next five days he would put some seventeen thousand
words to paper.</p>
<p>It was also in that house in Yenbo where the dueling legends of T. E.
Lawrence were to be born. To his lionizers, Lawrence’s acute grasp of
the situation on the ground in Arabia, combined with his brilliance at
conveying that understanding into words, was about to make him a man
born to the hour, a prime example of the phenomenon in which a
particular kind of genius is finally joined to the circumstances he has
spent his entire life working toward. To his detractors, what was about
to happen could be largely, even wholly, attributed to random chance,
that the myriad small events which were to transpire over the next three
weeks and so improbably turn to Lawrence’s advantage—the strange
coincidences, the timing and mistiming of messages, the byzantine
maneuverings by generals and statesmen—were beyond any prediction. If
all these factors were tossed into some giant cosmic hopper, so this
narrative goes, it never would have played out in quite the same
sequence again.</p>
<p>The specifics of Lawrence’s résumé that October would actually appear
to provide fodder for the latter version of the legend. At Yenbo, he was
a twenty-eight-year-old army captain without a single day of military
training; at that time, policy in Arabia was being debated at the
highest levels of the British military and political leadership. True,
he was the first British officer to glimpse the rebel fighters in the
field, but that glimpse had lasted all of twenty-six hours and
essentially consisted of watching them lounge about a valley encampment,
hardly the basis for an authoritative analysis. Nor were most of his
observations truly unique; among the handful of British military
officers who had preceded him to the Hejaz, nearly all had noted the
completely ad hoc nature of the Arab “army,” its lack of anything
approaching conventional military discipline, even its abject terror of
enemy artillery and airplanes.</p>
<p>But of course, Lawrence hadn’t merely his brief sojourn to Faisal’s
camp to draw on, but the years he had spent immersing himself in Arab
culture in Carchemish. From this he’d gained a profound appreciation for
how clan and tribal alliances worked, how that structure might play out
on the battlefield, and how unusual it was to find a leader capable of
forging a coalition of tribes for anything more than a very short-term
goal. In addition, starting as a young boy and continuing through his
years at Oxford, Lawrence had obsessively focused on one very particular
field of scholarship—medieval military history—and warfare in
early-twentieth-century Arabia bore striking similarities to that in
fourteenth-century Europe. These similarities extended from how a
fighting force was recruited, to its leadership structure—trade out
sheikhs and emirs for lords and thanes and princes—to how that fighting
force maneuvered in the field. In 1916 Hejaz, much like 1356 France, an
army on the move was wholly dependent on satisfying its most elemental
needs—water, the availability of draft animals, forage—and this dictated
where it went, whom it fought, and when. Lawrence, with a knowledge of
medieval military strategies surpassed by but a small handful of people
alive, found many of the features of the Arabian battlefield instantly
recognizable, and certainly far more familiar than to a professionally
trained officer steeped in Napoleonic or even current Western Front
precepts.</p>
<p>With this cultural and scholarly grounding, Lawrence immediately saw
the utter futility of trying to transform the Arab rebel fighting force
into something it was not, and never would be—namely, a conventional
European-style army. The only way forward, he argued in the reports he
penned in Yenbo, was for the British to accept the Arab way of war, and
to adapt their strategies and expectations accordingly.</p>
<p>But even this was not terribly controversial or original as far as it
went—after all, even the most hidebound military officer recognizes the
need to adjust to the men and matériel at his disposal—but from his
brief time in the Hejaz, Lawrence had come to two specific conclusions
that were much more so.</p>
<p>In light of the woeful lack of military success since the early days
of the Arab Revolt, there was a growing consensus in both London and
Cairo that a sizable British force would have to be dispatched to the
Hejaz to bolster the rebel forces; the most common figure bandied about
was a brigade, or at least three thousand soldiers. In October, Emir
Hussein continued to vacillate about this idea, worried that such an
“infidel” presence in the Muslim holy land would undermine his standing
with the tribes currently joined to him. From his own travels, and
especially from the wariness he had encountered in Faisal’s camp,
Lawrence concluded that Hussein’s apprehensions were absolutely valid;
while a small group of European advisors and trainers setting up shop on
the coastline would be “joyously welcomed,” he wrote, any larger force
was likely to be resented and play into Turkish propaganda about
Christian Crusaders. By arguing for this minimal presence, Lawrence was
placing himself against the majority opinion of the British military
command staff, including that held by the two British officers who’d
spent the most time in the Hejaz, Lt. Colonel Cyril Wilson and his
deputy, Alfred Parker.</p>
<p>Even more potentially contentious was Lawrence’s notion that the true
“prophet” of the revolt was the soft-spoken and austere Faisal. Going
back to even before the war, British officials had regarded the
gregarious and dynamic Abdullah as their chief ally in the Hejaz, the
son in closest counsel to the mercurial Hussein, and nothing since the
revolt’s outbreak had changed that view. To the contrary, it was to
Abdullah that those officials continued to turn in hopes of divining
what the old man might be thinking, and in charting the next stage in
the fighting. By contrast, prior to Lawrence, the only British officials
to have met Faisal were Wilson and Parker, and then to rather thin
conclusion; if liking Faisal on a personal level, Wilson had sensed in
the emir’s third son “a man who can’t stand the racket” of
combat—essentially, a coward—an estimation he had conveyed to the
British leadership. When it came to promoting Faisal as the revolt’s
real leader, Lawrence constituted a minority of precisely one.</p>
<p>And so, against the very long odds on both these points, just how did
Lawrence eventually win out? A case of genius not to be denied, or sheer
dumb luck?</p>
<p>What the purveyors of both dueling legends tend to overlook is that,
already at Yenbo, Lawrence had a formidable, if rather unglamorous,
weapon in his arsenal. From his position at the inner circle of the
military intelligence apparatus in Cairo, he possessed an intimate grasp
of the British military and political power structure deciding policy in
Arabia. But “structure” is far too charitable a word. In fact, it was a
bureaucratic quagmire, a maze of overlapping ministries and competing
agendas and feuding personalities. From his reading at the Savoy
Hotel—and virtually nothing was so classified as to be beyond his
purview—Lawrence knew who all the principal players were in this morass,
the opinions they held, and, perhaps most important, who their rivals
were. Along with writing up his reports, the five-day wait in Yenbo gave
him time to contemplate the mind-numbingly complex political chessboard
that lay before him, and to devise a strategy whereby he might play off
the competing factions and see his ideas win out.</p>
<p>He would be assisted in this by something else often overlooked: the
nature of communications at the time. In some spheres, this was
fantastically advanced from just decades earlier, in others still quite
primitive. In 1916, the mimeograph machine could make hundreds, even
thousands of copies of an important document; for most everything else,
there was the century-old technology of carbon paper. Via the wireless
telegraph, a message could be sent from London to Buenos Aires in a
matter of minutes, while delivering that same message to someone just
ten miles away in a place like Arabia required the dispatch of a courier
on foot or horseback. Lawrence would prove very adept at using both the
advances and deficiencies in communications to his advantage, repeatedly
breaching protocol to get messages to his allies quickly, conveniently
failing to receive undesired orders—“garbled transmission” was a
favorite excuse—until it was too late and the matter decided. Joined to
a certain ruthless streak, it all enabled T. E. Lawrence to emerge as a
kind of exemplar of the bureaucratic infighter, with a prowess that even
the most devious palace intriguer or tenure-track college professor
might envy.</p>
<p>Over the next three weeks, Lawrence would be employed as point
man—hatchet man might be a more apt term—by a variety of British
officials seeking to promote their agendas over those of their rivals.
In that role, the twenty-eight-year-old captain would adroitly work all
sides of the street, allowing him to administer a brutal blow to French
designs in the region, undermine an immensely powerful British official,
and help catalyze a fundamental shift in British policy in Arabia. In
the process, he would also alter the course of the Arab Revolt, and his
own role within it.</p>
<p>It was an ascendancy that got off to a shaky start, however. On
October 31, HMS Suva, under the command of a career naval officer named
William “Ginger” Boyle, so nicknamed for his red hair, put in to Yenbo
to finally free Lawrence from his enforced Arabian interlude.</p>
<p>“I had heard of a Captain Lawrence being on the coast,” Boyle would
recall in his memoirs. “I had assumed he was one of the military
officers sent over and was a little astonished when a small, untidily
dressed and most unmilitary figure strolled up to me on board … hands in
pockets and so without a salute.” Noticing that Lawrence had three
captain stars on one shoulder strap but inexplicably none on the other,
the no-nonsense Boyle refused even to acknowledge his passenger and
instead pointed him over to his first lieutenant; the ship captain was
gratified when the lieutenant roundly upbraided Lawrence for his lack of
manners.</p>
<p>In his own recollection of that meeting, Lawrence conceded his
failure to make a good first impression on Ginger Boyle but was more
inclined to attribute the problem to genetics. “Red-haired men,” he
pointed out, “are seldom patient.”</p>
<p>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, Édouard Brémond had taken little notice of the quiet
British army captain who attended his dinner at the French mission on
October 16. There was little reason he should have. The French colonel’s
principal guests that evening had been his British counterpart in
Jeddah, Cyril Wilson, and the visiting Oriental secretary for Egypt,
Ronald Storrs, a gregarious and witty table companion. By contrast,
Captain Lawrence had been so slight in stature and so youthful in face
that, in his ill-fitting uniform, he might easily have been mistaken for
an adolescent playing at soldier. Brémond had ample reason to revisit
that assessment when Lawrence returned to the French mission dining hall
at the beginning of November. At that dinner, the unassuming young
officer of three weeks before was loquacious, even commandeering of the
conversation, and Brémond was aghast at what he was saying.</p>
<p>When HMS Suva had turned into Yenbo bay on October 31, Lawrence had
assumed he would soon be on his way back to Cairo. Instead, Cyril
Wilson’s deputy in the Hejaz, Colonel Alfred Parker, had come up on the
Suva to hear firsthand what Lawrence had found at Faisal’s camp.
Impressed by his insights, Parker had suggested that Lawrence first make
for Khartoum in order to confer with Reginald Wingate, the
governor-general of the Sudan and one of the most important British
officials involved in Arabian affairs. As a result, the Suva had carried
Lawrence two hundred miles back down the coast to Jeddah, where a second
ship was readied to take him on the short hop across the Red Sea to the
Sudan. Testament to the sudden interest in his mission, this second
ship, HMS Euryalus, was the flagship of the Red Sea fleet and under the
personal direction of the fleet commander, Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss.</p>
<p>Hearing of all this, Colonel Brémond was also keen to learn what the
young army captain had observed in Faisal’s camp and, perhaps even more,
just what he intended to tell Reginald Wingate. This had prompted his
invitation to Lawrence and Wemyss to be his dinner guests in Jeddah. At
that gathering, it soon became clear that most every opinion Captain
Lawrence had formed ran directly counter to what the French colonel was
trying to achieve in Arabia.</p>
<p>Since setting up shop in Jeddah in early September, Brémond had
lobbied for a greatly expanded Allied military presence in the Hejaz.
Certainly part of his argument had root in his very low opinion of the
fighting capability of Hussein’s rebels. Time and again, he had proposed
that the two hundred French technical advisors who were under his
command and currently sitting idle in Egypt be brought down to Rabegh,
where they might start transforming the Arabs into a credible fighting
force. Of course, such a small force would be completely vulnerable in
the event of a Turkish attack on that port town, Brémond argued, so he
further proposed that a sizable contingent of British soldiers—at least
a brigade, perhaps two—be brought from Egypt to secure the area and
provide protection. If the French colonel had his way, the Western
military presence in the Hejaz would be expanded from a tiny handful of
men—himself, Wilson, and Parker, the few British logistics officers
scattered along the shoreline—to anywhere between three thousand and ten
thousand.</p>
<p>Left unspoken in this proposition was how it neatly dovetailed with
France’s—or at least Colonel Brémond’s—hidden agenda. With a large force
of Allied troops on the ground, it would be that much easier to monitor
and control events, and to prevent the Arab Revolt from spreading north
into Syria. Even better, with an absolutely minimal French investment,
its two hundred soldiers alongside Britain’s thousands, France would
achieve a physical military presence in the Middle East, and further
stake its claim to being a joint and equal partner with Britain in the
region.</p>
<p>Even without grasping Brémond’s ulterior motives, the commander of
the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Cairo, General Archibald Murray, had
given the idea a frosty reception. Tasked to launch an offensive into
southern Palestine on the far side of the Sinai Peninsula, and with his
army already being periodically poached by Western Front commanders
looking for fresh bodies to fling against the Germans in France, Murray
was adamantly opposed to parting with any more of his men for the
“sideshow” in Arabia.</p>
<p>Brémond had enjoyed much better luck in his approach to Reginald
Wingate. Indeed, the Sudan governor-general was a perfect British foil
for the Frenchman, a fervent believer in the importance of the Arab
rebellion, but just as fervently convinced that the rebels could never
carry the day on their own. Along with Brémond’s counsel, Wingate’s
conviction on this point was constantly reinforced by the two political
officers he had sent to Arabia, Wilson and Parker, both of whom believed
the revolt would soon collapse if foreign troops didn’t come in. Of
course, it was easy enough for Wingate to lobby for such a move, since
he didn’t have the soldiers to send; instead, they would have to be
taken off Murray in Egypt. The way Brémond figured it, with Wingate as
an ally it was simply a matter of waiting for the next Arab setback, at
which point they could join forces and, sidestepping Murray, appeal
directly to London for a military deployment.</p>
<p>Brémond didn’t have to wait long. In fact, an opportunity had
presented itself in those same few days that Lawrence was stranded in
Yenbo. In late October, news had come in of a large Turkish force
closing on Rabegh. The report had sown panic among the Arab forces in
the foothills above that vital port town, triggering a stampede toward
the coast. Seeing their opening, Wingate and Brémond had moved quickly.
Wingate fired off a cable to London urging that an Anglo-French force be
readied to land at Rabegh. Following Wingate’s lead, Brémond had a note
passed to the British Foreign Office announcing that while he was fully
prepared to speed his idled soldiers and artillery guns to Rabegh’s
relief, it would be “highly imprudent” to do so “unless they could be
protected by a sufficient escort to secure their not falling into enemy
hands.” As for just what size “escort” the French colonel was looking
for, Wingate provided his government with the specifics: a minimum of
six battalions, or some six thousand British soldiers.</p>
<p>Faced with such an urgent appeal, the British War Committee came
close to approving the proposal, and probably would have if not for the
strenuous objections of General Murray, the man on the hook for
supplying those six thousand troops. On November 2, the War Committee
had declined to order any deployments out of Egypt, but instead
suggested that Brémond and Wingate rustle up whatever soldiers they
could under their commands and rush them to Rabegh—a suggestion that
obviously led the coescalationists right back to square one.</p>
<p>If disappointed by London’s decision, Brémond was surely heartened by
a new bit of information that came in that same day. As Alfred Parker in
Rabegh reported, there was no Turkish force closing on that town, and
there never had been; rather, the entire crisis had been sparked by an
erroneous rumor. The embarrassing episode, Parker acidly noted, “proves
that Rabegh force could not stand for a moment if threatened.… I
consider best solution would be British Govt. [War Committee] to
reconsider their decision and land brigade at Rabegh.”</p>
<p>That was music to Brémond’s ears, and he could be confident that a
new chance to lobby the War Committee would soon present itself; after
all, if the rebels had been put to flight by a rumor, what was going to
happen when the Turks launched a bona fide attack?</p>
<p>It was at this precise juncture, however, that T. E. Lawrence
reappeared in Jeddah.</p>
<p>As Lawrence expounded over dinner at the French mission, from the
time he had spent with Ali in Rabegh and Faisal in Hamra, he was now
convinced that any Allied military presence in Arabia should be an
absolutely minimal one; Hussein’s rebels would gladly receive weapons
and military training from Christian “infidel” advisors, whether they
were French or British, but anything more expansive was sure to fuel
fears of a European takeover and cause the revolt’s destruction from
within.</p>
<p>This was an analysis upon which reasonable men could disagree—and
Brémond did disagree, strenuously—but what truly stunned him was
Lawrence’s further contention that, quite aside from the religious
issue, such a force was altogether unnecessary. In his view, the
strength of the Arab fighters was as a defensive force, and commanding
as they did the narrow gorges and defiles that stood between Medina and
the coast, their position was all but impregnable to any conceivable
approach a Turkish army might make. So long as the Arabs held those
heights—and it was hard to see how they might ever be dislodged given
that the terrain was completely unsuited to the Turks’ advantage in
artillery and airplanes—Rabegh was perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Brémond was too polite a host to point out that this assertion was
being made by a man who had observed the rebels in the field for all of
one day, but he surely asked how this view squared with the recent rebel
stampede above Rabegh; apparently the Arabs didn’t share in the belief
of their positions’ impregnability if they were willing to abandon them
on a rumor. It was perhaps in reply to this line of questioning that
Lawrence made a further assertion: it had been Ali’s men who had
panicked at Rabegh, not Faisal’s, and it was Faisal who was the true
leader of the revolt.</p>
<p>Even more than Lawrence’s other opinions, it was this declaration
that flabbergasted Brémond. The colonel had yet to meet Faisal, but
nothing he’d heard suggested Hussein’s third son as either a natural or
decisive leader; instead, as Brémond would shortly report to Paris,
“[Faisal] talks a lot but says nothing. He acts little and does
nothing.”</p>
<p>But from a French perspective, the thought of promoting Faisal’s
leadership was also alarming. By all accounts, he was far more
distrusting of the European allies than his older brothers. There was
also the matter of his long dalliance with the pro-independence Arab
conspirators in Syria. Even if Djemal Pasha had hunted down many of
those conspirators, no doubt parts of the network still existed, and for
a France eager to keep the Arab Revolt well away from Syria, there could
be no prospect more worrisome than the ascent of Faisal.</p>
<p>Brémond might have been tempted to write Lawrence off as a
particularly irksome dinner guest, his bold assertions those of a naïf
infused with a sense of self-importance, save for a couple of details.
One was his manner. He stated his views with utter and unshakable
confidence, a confidence bordering on the impertinent when it came to
military protocol; no matter the seniority or rank of those who
disagreed with him, the army captain with the icy blue eyes refused to
back down. Another was the effect he’d had on Admiral Wemyss. Whatever
the admiral’s views on a deployment to Arabia had been previously, it
was clear he was much impressed by Lawrence, and now held very similar
opinions; in fact, Wemyss was planning to accompany Lawrence to Khartoum
so that they might make their case to Wingate jointly. Not surprisingly,
it made Édouard Brémond extremely apprehensive of what might happen once
these two came into contact with the man who up until then had been his
closest British ally.</p>
<p>After that dinner in Jeddah, Colonel Brémond disparagingly remarked
that Lawrence had become a “vassal” of Faisal. As he got to know
Lawrence better in the months ahead, however, Brémond would conclude
he’d had it the wrong way around, that the unassuming little British
captain had a selfish, even sinister, motive in promoting Faisal. If a
British brigade was put ashore in Arabia, a proper military command
structure would be established, one that would leave no role for an
inexperienced desk officer like Captain Lawrence. Absent that
intervention, it would be up to Hussein’s sons to carry the day, and in
the soft and hesitant figure of Faisal, Brémond deduced, Lawrence had
found a man he might bend to his will, allowing him to become the unseen
kingmaker of Arabia.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON THE SAME day that Lawrence set out for Faisal’s camp in the
mountains, October 22, a most curious drama had unfolded in northern
Scotland. It began when a Scandinavian-American Line passenger ship, the
Oskar II, put in at the coal refueling station in the Orkney Islands
town of Kirkwall.</p>
<p>Although the Oskar II was transiting between two neutral
countries—she was out of Denmark and bound for New York City—the Orkneys
were an extremely sensitive area for the British military, the site of
their main wartime naval base in the harbor known as Scapa Flow. Always
on the lookout for spies or saboteurs, a team of British police
inspectors boarded the Swedish-registered ship for a routine check of
the passports and luggage of its passengers. On that day, they found
someone of great interest. He was a stout forty-one-year-old Ottoman
citizen who had recently crossed into neutral Denmark from Germany.</p>
<p>Detaining the man on deck in plain view of other passengers, the
inspectors made a thorough search of his cabin; as they subsequently
informed the Oskar II captain in the presence of gawking passengers,
they found it “full of German stuff.” Taken off the ship in a police
launch, the man was held that night under guard at a Kirkwall hotel,
then transferred the next day to the Scottish mainland. Brought to
London, by the morning of October 25 he was undergoing questioning by
Basil Thomson, the head of Scotland Yard’s Criminal Investigation
Department, and the official in charge of tracking subversives and spies
in wartime Britain.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the Oskar II reached New York City that the British
detention of Aaron Aaronsohn became publicly known. It immediately
caused a stir in certain circles, especially within the American Zionist
community and among those agricultural scientists who had come to know
Aaronsohn during his extended prewar visits to the United States. For
members of both these groups, it seemed utterly inconceivable that the
Jewish agronomist might be an agent for the Central Powers, the
accusation implicit in his detention at Kirkwall. On the other hand,
there was the disquieting fact that he had chosen to remain in
Ottoman-ruled Palestine at the war’s outbreak, even as many other Jewish
émigrés had fled to neutral nations or British-ruled Egypt. Then there
was the highly suspicious nature of his journey across war-torn central
Europe to reach Denmark. Certainly that trip could not have been made
without the approval of high officials in both the Turkish and German
governments.</p>
<p>At least one of Aaronsohn’s fellow passengers on the Oskar II
fervently believed in his innocence. A German Jewish socialite named
Olga Bernhardt, she had become very friendly with the agronomist during
the voyage from Copenhagen, and she sought to publicize his plight once
she reached America. That effort badly backfired when, apparently
alerted by Bernhardt, the New York Evening Post instead characterized
Aaronsohn’s detention as that of a dangerous Turkish spy. With that, any
campaign within the American scientific or Jewish communities to win his
release quickly fizzled.</p>
<p>Which actually suited Aaron Aaronsohn just fine. That’s because his
“arrest” at Kirkwall had been an elaborate charade. He was a spy, or at
least he very much wanted to be, but for the other side in the conflict,
and his removal from the Oskar II with its theatric touches—placing him
under guard in public view, the semipublic announcement of what had been
found in his luggage—was tailored to throw German and Turkish
counterintelligence agents off the scent and protect his spy ring back
in Palestine. This couldn’t have been achieved by Aaronsohn simply
falling from view. Instead, he needed the Germans and Turks to “know”
that his intention had been to go to America, that the British had
grabbed their “dangerous Turkish spy” off the decks of the Oskar II
quite by chance. To this end, the portrait rendered of him by the
Evening Post was just a bonus. As Aaronsohn noted in his diary that
night in his Kirkwall hotel room, “The game is in play.”</p>
<p>It was very much a marathon game. It had been well over three months
since Aaronsohn had left Palestine with Djemal Pasha’s vesika, or travel
permit, in hand. First, there had been a monthlong delay in
Constantinople as he negotiated the bureaucratic maze to obtain the
documentation needed for his further passage to Vienna. From the
Austrian capital, it had been a simple matter to continue on to Berlin,
but then came another monthlong delay as he tried to figure out the
crossing into neutral Denmark. The scientist had finally achieved that
in mid-September, but then more hurdles: first, making contact with
British counterintelligence agents, then convincing them his incredible
story was true.</p>
<p>The British spy handlers in Denmark may not have been thoroughly
assured on this last point, but after some hesitation, they decided it
would be Scotland Yard’s problem to sort out. In mid-October, they
arranged to put Aaronsohn on board the Oskar II, sailing from Copenhagen
harbor on the nineteenth, while further arranging his detention in
Kirkwall in three days’ time. Thus the British were finally about to
“bring in from the cold” a would-be spy who had spent over a year
desperately trying to get their attention.</p>
<p>As he waited for the Oskar II to sail, Aaronsohn was acutely aware
that he was about to cross a point of no return, that whatever happened
next, his former life as a simple scientist in Palestine was gone
forever. In Copenhagen, he wrote several coded letters that, through
intermediaries, he hoped would reach his coconspirators back in Athlit;
in them, he wrote with happy anticipation about his imminent departure
for New York—for the benefit of German and Turkish counterintelligence
agents—but used certain words and phrases to indicate that his real
destination was Britain.</p>
<p>He also wrote a very long letter to Judge Julian Mack, one of the
American benefactors of the Athlit research station, in which he laid
bare his reasons for the dangerous path he was now taking. In what was
part confession—indeed, this was how Aaronsohn would later describe
it—and part manifesto, he wrote out an anguished narrative of what had
occurred in Palestine over the previous two years, how it had inexorably
brought him to the point where he was prepared to betray the nation that
had given his family refuge. “Would I have left the country and openly
taken service on the English side,” he wrote, “it would already have
been bad enough. My character, my standing would be impaired. But I did
worse. I stood where I was, I organized a whole movement, I became
connected with the Intelligence Office, as people who are afraid of
words call it. I do not like mincing words. Put it clearly, and I became
a Spy.”</p>
<p>Aaronsohn intended the letter to be shown to other American Jewish
benefactors of the research station, many of whom did not consider
themselves Zionists and were sure to be shocked by its contents. This
may have been the reason for its oratorical, even somewhat histrionic
tone as the scientist explained what he and his confederates felt they
were fighting for: “Nobody can say we were doing it for the sake of vile
money.… We are not doing it for honours either.… We do not do it for
vengeance; we do it because we hope we are serving our Jewish cause.… We
considered it our duty to do our share, and we are still foolish enough
to believe in right and justice and recognition of the Cause we are
serving.”</p>
<p>That was all well and good, but a loftiness unlikely to fully satisfy
Basil Thomson. As the head of Scotland Yard’s Criminal Investigation
Department, Thomson had interviewed hundreds of would-be spies by the
close of 1916, and interrogated many more who had proven to be German
moles. Certainly neither the résumé nor the recent travels of the man
brought into his office on October 25 were the stuff to inspire
confidence.</p>
<p>Yet the longer Aaron Aaronsohn talked, the more Thomson was persuaded
that here was the genuine article, a man anxious to help the British war
effort—albeit for his own motives—and possessed of the skills and acumen
to do so. It was not just Aaronsohn’s meticulously observed details of
the Turkish war machine—a bit out of date now, perhaps, but Aaronsohn
claimed to have a network in place to constantly update them—but his
seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of most every aspect of the region. For
the detective, the decisive moment came when the topic turned to the
British army’s current slow-motion advance across the Sinai Peninsula in
prelude to their offensive into Palestine.</p>
<p>One key reason for that army’s glacial pace over the arid wasteland
was the need to haul water all the way from Egypt. That had meant laying
a pipeline, which had also necessitated the building of a railroad.
According to Aaronsohn, Thomson recounted in his memoir, it all could
have been avoided. “There is water right there in the desert, three
hundred feet down,” he said. “All you have to do is drill for it.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?” Thomson would recall asking.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn shrugged. “The rocks indicate it. And [first-century
Jewish-Roman chronicler] Flavius Josephus corroborates it. He wrote that
he could walk for a whole day south from Caesarea and never leave
flourishing gardens.… Where there were gardens, there must have been
water. Where is that water now?”</p>
<p>“And what can you do?” Thomson asked.</p>
<p>“If I were with the British army, I could show the engineers where to
drill. I guarantee that they would find enough water for the army
without having to bring a single drop from Cairo.”</p>
<p>Impressed, Thomson decided to pass Aaronsohn on to the central
headquarters of the British military, the Imperial General Staff on
Whitehall Street. There, a young major, Walter Gribbon, was detailed to
further debrief the agronomist, a first step toward determining just
what should be done with him. On October 28, three days after arriving
in London, Aaronsohn wrote his brother Alexander and sister Rivka in New
York. Along with great relief at finally reaching England—“for the past
few nights I have slept in peace, untroubled by nightmares”—he admitted
to a pang of regret:</p>
<p>“Here, I had the good fortune to meet eager ears and open minds. I
have reason to believe that had our [British] friends been better
informed sooner, they would have acted in consequence. Had I come
earlier I should have probably served our cause better, spared our
country some suffering, and rendered more efficient service to our
friends.”</p>
<p>When he wrote those words, Aaronsohn didn’t know the half of it. On
the previous day, as he was again being debriefed by Walter Gribbon, a
friendly, slightly chubby man in his midthirties had come into the
office to briefly sit in on the proceedings. During a break in Gribbon’s
questioning, the visitor inquired after Aaronsohn’s views on Zionism, of
where exactly he placed himself amid the galaxy of Jewish political
thought. The visitor had listened intently and, before leaving, handed
Aaronsohn a calling card, asking if he might be so good as to drop by
the indicated address at 9:30 a.m. in three days’ time. Aaronsohn
readily agreed. The address on the calling card was 30 Broadway Gate,
the London residence of the MP from Hull Central, Sir Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>BY NOVEMBER 15, 1916, Brigadier General Gilbert Clayton faced a
conundrum as old as the superior-subordinate relationship: how to
sabotage the plans of his boss without revealing his own hand in the
endeavor. Adding to Clayton’s difficulties on that day was that to come
up with a feasible scheme, he urgently needed to speak with one of his
own subordinates, Captain T. E. Lawrence. Unfortunately, Lawrence was
quite unreachable, in transit somewhere along the thousand-mile stretch
of desert and Nile River towns that lay between Khartoum and Cairo.</p>
<p>The problem was that, once again, Reginald Wingate was lobbying
London for a large-scale military intervention in Arabia, and this time
suggesting that both Lawrence and Sheikh Faisal were in favor of it.
Until Lawrence resurfaced, there was no way of knowing what he might
have said to Wingate, and thus no easy way to thwart the plan.</p>
<p>In whatever course he chose, however, Gilbert Clayton did have a
distinct built-in advantage. That’s because within the maze of
overlapping bureaucracies the British had created in wartime Egypt, no
one was precisely sure where Clayton’s job duties began and where they
ended. That uncertainty had stood the unassuming spymaster with the
pencil-thin mustache in very good stead in past crises, and it was about
to do so again.</p>
<p>At the war’s outset, Clayton had been the chief British intelligence
officer in Cairo, a post that made him the overall supervisor of
Lawrence and the other Intrusives who set up shop at the Savoy Hotel in
late 1914. In turn, Clayton had answered to the chief British civil
authority in Egypt, High Commissioner Henry McMahon. Keeping matters
simple, all ultimately answered to the Foreign Office in London.</p>
<p>That neat chain of command had turned both murky and contentious when
Egypt became the chief staging ground for British military operations
against the Ottoman Empire, operations that fell under the aegis of the
War Office. In the inevitable turf war between the resident
administration and the incoming generals of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force, those military intelligence units answerable to the War
Office—Cairo was suddenly awash in them—saw little reason to tolerate a
competing one answerable to the Foreign Office. Tensions had only grown
worse when Clayton’s Intrusives were given a clearer mandate in early
1916 and institutionalized as the Arab Bureau. For months afterward,
General Archibald Murray, the commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force—or EEF—tried unsuccessfully to wrest control of Clayton’s outfit
from McMahon, before finally settling for a quasi-supervisory role.</p>
<p>But the battle for primacy in Cairo was actually a three-way fight,
and just to keep things lively, this third contender was a thousand
miles away in Khartoum. Reginald Wingate, the governor-general of the
Sudan, was also the sirdar, or commander in chief, of the Egyptian army,
a wholly different military force than Murray’s EEF. As might be
predicted, none of these three men—McMahon, Murray, Wingate—liked each
other very much, and joined to their intrigues against one another were
the competing bureaucracies of London and British India, each with its
own set of interests and allies and adversaries in the Egyptian capital.
On top of this was the official indigenous Egyptian government that,
though it was quite toothless, various British officials periodically
felt the need to pretend to consult in order to maintain the appearance
that the wishes of the actual inhabitants of Egypt somehow mattered.</p>
<p>Amid this impenetrable tangle, though, one name had a way of popping
up with surprising regularity: Gilbert Clayton. By the autumn of 1916,
the spymaster was simultaneously the head of the Arab Bureau (answerable
to McMahon), the “Cairo Agent of the Sirdar” (Wingate), and the chief
liaison officer between EEF (Murray) and the British Egyptian civilian
administration (McMahon). In his spare time, he also directed an
internal spying network that kept watch on both local dissident leaders
and representatives of the indigenous Egyptian government, a task
simplified by the fact that the two were often one and the same. As
Lawrence would later write of Clayton, “It was not easy to descry his
influence. He was like water, or permeating oil, creeping silently and
insistently through everything. It was not possible to say where Clayton
was and was not, and how much really belonged to him.”</p>
<p>Paradoxically, considering the sabotage mission he was contemplating
that November, of the various competitors, Gilbert Clayton was
personally closest to Wingate. A trim man in his midfifties with a fine
white mustache, Wingate was a legend in East Africa, having fought
alongside Kitchener in the Mahdi War of the late 1890s, and then staying
on to rule over British Sudan for the next seventeen years. For five of
those years, Clayton had served as Wingate’s personal secretary in
Khartoum, and he’d been deeply impressed by the man’s political acumen.
The sirdar had also been one of the first British leaders in the region
to appreciate the importance of the Arab Revolt in the summer of 1916,
and had been tireless in promoting their cause to London.</p>
<p>The recurrent sticking point, however, was that nearly all of
Wingate’s information on Arabia came either from the two Sudan hands he
had sent there, Cyril Wilson and Alfred Parker, or from Colonel Édouard
Brémond. From these three, the sirdar had heard a steady litany of the
rebels’ incompetence, an unending drumbeat on the need for a large
Allied force. This was a course that virtually everyone in the Arab
Bureau strongly opposed, and it had been partly in hopes of bringing a
new perspective to the matter that Clayton had arranged to send T. E.
Lawrence on his fact-finding mission to the Hejaz in October. As Clayton
had expected, the visit had convinced Lawrence that escalation would be
folly—which was also why he had approved Lawrence’s detour to Khartoum
in order to brief Wingate directly.</p>
<p>At first, that stratagem appeared to pay off. Lawrence had arrived in
Khartoum on November 7, just days after Wingate’s first intervention
request had been vetoed by the War Committee, and whatever Lawrence said
to the sirdar seemed to greatly mollify him. Obviously impressed by
Lawrence’s knowledge of the Arab world, and by his account of the
defensive capabilities of Faisal’s troops, Wingate cabled Clayton that
same day outlining a radically scaled-back plan: to urge Brémond to send
his technical advisors on to the Hejaz but without the thousands of
British troops as protection, and to give Faisal’s men the “moral and
material support (aeroplanes, guns and machine guns) necessary to enable
them to continue their defensive [sic] in hills.”</p>
<p>But if Clayton thought that settled the matter, he was soon set
right. The next day, November 8, the French government had pressed the
War Committee to reconsider its decision, stressing that while Brémond
was anxious to send his advisors to Rabegh, “they cannot provide the
kind of field force that British infantry would form. Sending these
French units to Rabegh on their own would mean unnecessarily risking
their sacrifice, thereby handing to the Turks the guns and machine guns
intended for the Sherif’s army.”</p>
<p>In his own cable shortly afterward, Wingate had thrown his support to
the Brémond/French argument anew, even if tempered somewhat by
Lawrence’s influence. Since it was possible that Faisal might on his own
block a Turkish advance toward Rabegh, as Lawrence maintained, Wingate
suggested that a British brigade be readied for deployment but only sent
ashore “at the last moment.” The sirdar further intimated that this was
a course of action approved by the one British officer who had actually
been to the war front, Captain Lawrence.</p>
<p>To Clayton, reading this cable in Cairo, it made little sense.
Lawrence had surely been around the military long enough to know that a
force readied for deployment would be deployed, bringing about the very
situation—the implosion of the Arab Revolt—that he had warned against.
How had Lawrence possibly acquiesced to this? It was a question with no
immediate answer. Lawrence had left Khartoum on November 11, and would
be incommunicado until he reached Cairo. In the meantime, the War
Committee, under intense French pressure, was pondering its next
move.</p>
<p>No record exists of what was said when Clayton finally sat Lawrence
down in the Arab Bureau offices on November 16, and neither man was to
detail that meeting in their later writing. From anecdotal evidence, it
appears Lawrence either maintained that Wingate had somehow
misunderstood him, or, if admitting to having agreed to Wingate’s plan,
claimed he thought he was responding to a purely hypothetical
scenario.</p>
<p>But if Lawrence did equivocate about his meetings with Wingate, there
is another possible explanation. On November 6, the day before he had
arrived in Khartoum, it was announced that Henry McMahon was being
dismissed as Egyptian high commissioner, to be replaced by Reginald
Wingate. That news put Lawrence in a nasty squeeze in Khartoum; he was
not only sitting across from the biggest proescalationist in the British
power structure, but the man about to become his overall boss. With this
in mind, the most likely scenario is that Lawrence agreed with Wingate’s
proposal to his face in Khartoum, in hopes that he could help in its
scuttling once he got back to the more amenable climes of Cairo.</p>
<p>Certainly that was what he now set out to do. At the end of his
meeting with Clayton on November 16, Lawrence returned to his office and
quickly wrote up a new memorandum on the situation in the Hejaz, one so
blunt and shorn of niceties that it left no room for misinterpretation.
In terms of length, there is probably no document that more profoundly
influenced the British war effort in Arabia than the four-page
memorandum he handed to Gilbert Clayton the next day.</p>
<p>In that memo, Lawrence held up and then knocked down virtually every
possible argument for a large Allied military presence in Arabia—and he
did so by turning the escalationists’ own arguments against them. While
it was true that the Arabs couldn’t defend Rabegh if the Turks broke
through Faisal’s mountain defenses, he pointed out, neither could an
Allied force held somewhere in reserve as Wingate proposed. That’s
because, once through the mountains, the Turks would reach the port town
in a mere four days, hardly time for even a fully readied force standing
by in Egypt to be brought down and deployed.</p>
<p>This, then, left the argument of deploying now, while Faisal’s men
still held the mountains, but the issue there was deep-rooted Arab
distrust. “They are our very good friends while we respect their
independence,” Lawrence wrote. “They are deeply grateful for the help we
have given them, but they fear lest we may make it a claim upon them
afterwards. We have appropriated too many Moslem countries for them to
have any real trust in our disinterestedness and they are terribly
afraid of an English occupation of Hejaz. If the British with or without
the Sherif’s approval landed at Rabegh an armed force strong enough to …
organize a position there, they would, I am convinced, say ‘we are
betrayed’ and scatter to their tents.”</p>
<p>This was, of course, the same basic argument other antiescalationists
had been making all along, but Lawrence was able to give it a wholly new
twist by virtue of his firsthand look at the region. As he’d discovered
in his trek to Faisal’s camp, there were other water sources in the
mountains above Rabegh that, until then, no one had known about. If Arab
resistance in those mountains collapsed—a collapse that, again, was sure
to accompany an Allied escalation—the Turks could draw on those water
sources to sidestep Rabegh altogether and continue on toward Mecca
unimpeded. In this scenario, the port town would be transformed from
vitally strategic to utterly superfluous.</p>
<p>But Lawrence wasn’t done yet. Recognizing that Colonel Brémond and
his French superiors were the prime movers behind the escalation
push—and were likely to continue that push no matter what the War
Committee decided during this latest go-around—he set out to demolish
their rationale for needing a British protection force for their
technical unit in Rabegh. If the Turks did break through the mountains
to advance on Rabegh, he pointed out, the Allies would still have four
days’ notice before they got there. In that scenario, the Royal Navy
would have more than enough time to evacuate two hundred French military
advisors, but probably not enough time to also evacuate thousands of
British troops and all their valuable war matériel. Remarkably, this
rather glaring hole in the French argument doesn’t seem to have been
noticed by anyone previously.</p>
<p>Except, Lawrence maintained, the French plan had never been about
defending Rabegh anyway. Rather, it was about safeguarding their
imperialist designs in the Middle East by seeking to destroy the Arab
Revolt from within: “They say, ‘Above all things the Arabs must not take
Medina. This can be assured if an allied force landed at Rabegh. The
tribal contingents will go home, and we will be the sole bulwark of the
Sherif in Mecca. At the end of the war we give him Medina as his
reward.’ This is of course a definite policy, agreeable to their larger
schemes,” but the result, Lawrence contended, would be to leave, “the
Franco-British force a disconsolate monument on the dusty beach at
Rabegh.”</p>
<p>It was an astounding accusation to make against Britain’s closest
ally, built as it was on an extrapolation—and a rather sweeping
mischaracterization—of what Colonel Brémond had told Lawrence in Jeddah.
But perhaps it was not so astounding to a British military leadership
grown increasingly resentful and suspicious of their French allies. On
the Western Front, the British were now doing a majority of the
fighting—and dying—as a shattered and depleted French army tried to
rebuild itself. Over the past five months, in a campaign meant to
relieve pressure on the battered French garrison in Verdun, British
general Douglas Haig had repeatedly and futilely hurled his army against
the German trenchworks along the river Somme; the 400,000 British dead
and wounded at the Somme were double that suffered by the French. On the
more local front, surely any British commander privy to the manner in
which the French had repeatedly blocked the Alexandretta plan, as well
as their continuing ambivalence over the coming British offensive in
Palestine—an ambivalence born of fears that success would take the
British into regions the French were claiming for themselves in the
postwar world—were prepared to accept most any charge of Gallic perfidy
at face value. Of course, Lawrence’s accusation was also guaranteed to
play well to the imperialist segment of the British government, eager to
somehow keep France out of the Middle East altogether.</p>
<p>The effect of Lawrence’s memo, then, was to transform the question of
an Allied troop deployment to Arabia from its military context and
propel it into the political. To wit, those in the British power
structure favoring escalation might actually be unwitting dupes of a
cleverly constructed French trap, one designed to both sabotage the Arab
Revolt and, by the diversion of British troops to Arabia, hobble the
offensive in Palestine. By the autumn of 1916, it was hard to conceive
of any accusation more injurious to a British officer’s reputation than
that of useful fool to the French, but however obliquely, this was
essentially the charge Lawrence was laying before Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>But what to do with such an incendiary document? This was the new
dilemma facing Gilbert Clayton on the morning of November 17. As
Lawrence was attached to the Arab Bureau, standard procedure called for
Clayton to first forward the memo to the bureau’s overseer, Henry
McMahon. That, however, would have been preaching to the choir, and as
McMahon was already on his way out as high commissioner, anything he
might do with the document could have only muted effect. Conversely,
Clayton had the option of sending it to Reginald Wingate in hopes that
the sirdar might finally see the error of his escalationist ways and
change course—except Lawrence had been so derisive of the standby-force
plan that the man who had authored it was bound to get his back up.</p>
<p>When it comes to political infighting, though, sometimes one’s
bitterest enemy can be turned into a temporary ally. Ever since arriving
in Cairo, General Archibald Murray had set out to control or neuter
Gilbert Clayton and his Arab Bureau in any way he could. In a fit of
pique after failing to have the bureau put under his command, Murray had
gone so far as to order his own intelligence units not to cooperate with
Clayton’s outfit. Of more immediate interest to Clayton on November 17,
however, was Murray’s implacable opposition to sending troops to Arabia.
He’d made his feelings on the topic clear at an interagency conference
in September.</p>
<p>“There is no good telling me that you only want this and that,” he’d
railed at Wingate’s deputy, Cyril Wilson. “From the experience of war,
and experience of recent campaigns, it is absolutely clear that you
start and you grow. You start with a brigade, that brigade wants some
artillery, then aeroplanes and camels. Then comes a request that the
force be moved to another point about ten miles [away], which it is
absolutely essential to hold. So the campaign grows.”</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it apparently occurred to Clayton that
Archibald Murray might be just the man who’d know what to do with
Lawrence’s memo.</p>
<p>For the EEF commander, that four-page report must have arrived like a
rare gift. Here was not only a précis that dismantled the intervention
argument on its merits, but, as an added windfall, hinted darkly that it
was all a French plot. He ordered that its author be immediately brought
to his office.</p>
<p>Archibald Murray was a famously nervous man. During a pivotal moment
in the opening days of the war, he had fainted away from the unrelenting
tension, an episode that spurred shocked whispers throughout the British
high command and probably contributed to Murray’s demotion from army
chief of staff, the number two position in the military hierarchy, in
1915. His transfer to Egypt hadn’t seemed to improve matters, as
Lawrence discovered when, answering Murray’s summons to headquarters
that day, he was intercepted by Murray’s deputy, General Lynden-Bell. As
Lawrence recounted, “I was astonished when, as I came in, [Bell] jumped
to his feet, leaped forward, and gripped me by the shoulder, hissing,
‘Now you’re not to frighten him; don’t you forget what I say!’” The task
before Lawrence, Bell instructed, was to give Murray “a reassuring
picture of affairs, and yet not a rosy picture, since they could not
afford excursions either way.”</p>
<p>Lawrence seems to have managed this delicate balancing act when
finally set before Murray. And despite Murray’s reputation for
jumpiness, it soon became clear that when it came to bureaucratic
knifework, he had a pretty steady hand himself. Shortly after Lawrence
left his office, he fired off a cable to Wingate: “I have just seen
Lawrence on his return from visiting Faisal, and his opinion, in which I
understand you and Faisal concur, is so strongly against the dispatch of
white troops to Arabia that I venture to suggest for your consideration
that the CIGS [Chief of Imperial General Staff William Robertson] should
at once be informed.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this request for Wingate’s “consideration” was intended as
rhetorical flourish, for Murray had actually sent Lawrence’s memo to
Robertson fifteen minutes earlier. As for Wingate concurring with
Lawrence’s views, that would be a hard matter for Wingate to judge since
Murray didn’t bother sending him a copy of the memo.</p>
<p>In London, Lawrence’s report played to great effect, and was quickly
circulated through the upper reaches of both the Foreign and War
Offices. As usually happens in such cases, those who agreed with the
report burnished the résumé of its author to lend authority to his
assertions. On November 19, General Robertson, himself no fan of
intervention in Arabia, forwarded the memo to the cabinet while
describing its author as a man “said to have an intimate knowledge of
the Turks and the Arabs.”</p>
<p>To those in the cabinet unfamiliar with the intricacies of Arabian
policy, perhaps the memorandum’s most persuasive aspect was its
anti-French tilt. Interestingly, one official who tried to counter that
effect was Mark Sykes. “Captain Lawrence’s statement in regard to the
French attitude to the Arabs,” he complained to the Foreign Office, “and
his reference to their larger schemes of policy, must be the result of
some misunderstanding, either by Captain Lawrence of the French, or by
the French officers of their own Government’s intentions, as it seems in
no way to fit in with anything said or thought here or in Paris.”</p>
<p>His was a lonely voice, however, and little match for the
antiescalation/anti-French officials who now had their own “expert” in
the field to tout. Henry McMahon joined his efforts to that campaign in
a cable to Charles Hardinge, the permanent under secretary at the
Foreign Office. Noting that he’d always feared that an Allied
intervention in Arabia would corrode Arab morale, McMahon wrote that
Lawrence, “whom I knew to be a very shrewd observer, has confirmed my
opinion on this point. He has moreover told me, as doubtless you will
hear from the Sirdar [Wingate], that the French hold the same view, and
it is with this very object that they are magnifying the dangers of the
present situation and advocating action at Rabegh. Colonel Brémond even
went so far in a moment of confidence as to tell Lawrence that the
French object was to thus disintegrate Arab effort.… It is as well to
remember this in any proposals that the French may now or hereafter make
in regard to our joint assistance to the Sherif.”</p>
<p>Amid the tumult, Lawrence even saw his stock rise among those regular
army staff officers in Cairo who had previously held both him and the
Arab Bureau in contempt. “They began to be polite to me,” he wrote, “and
to say that I was observant, with a pungent style, and character.”</p>
<p>In the face of such an onslaught, the War Committee quietly shelved
the Rabegh proposal anew, but not before a rather humorous last act. It
wasn’t until November 21, four days after Lawrence’s memo reached
London, that Reginald Wingate finally saw the analysis with which he
supposedly fully concurred. After his angry cable demanding to know why
he’d been kept out of the loop, the War Committee mildly rebuked Murray
for failing to first solicit Wingate’s opinion, suggesting that “there
is apparently lack of co-ordination in [this] matter.”</p>
<p>Murray begged to differ. “I have always taken special care to keep
Sirdar fully informed of all I am doing,” he cabled London back, “and as
far as I know we are working in the closest touch. You may rely on me in
this matter. As regards Lawrence’s report. As Lawrence had just come to
me after spending several days with the Sirdar I naturally understood he
was fully in possession of Lawrence’s news. In fact Lawrence informed me
to this effect.”</p>
<p>A PERSONALITY TIC of Aaron Aaronsohn’s was to keep constant track of
the exercise he got in a day—the time spent bicycling, or the miles
walked—and to note it in his diary. It may have been born of his long
and only intermittently successful campaign to keep his weight down, but
the long walks he took during his stay in London served an additional
purpose: a way to distract himself from the maddening inertia of the
British government. As he noted in his diary for November 11, 1916, a
day in which he had covered some twelve miles, “If I brooded continually
over the situation, it would be enough to drive me mad. What slowness in
decisions! It will soon be two months since I have left Berlin, and
after all nothing of consequence has been done to discover [sic] the
Athlit people.”</p>
<p>Certainly the scientist had done his part. In the nearly three weeks
he’d been in London, he had compiled two long reports for his British
hosts, one chronicling the plight of the Armenians in Syria, the other
on conditions inside Palestine. This second report, running to forty-six
pages, provided the British with probably their most comprehensive look
inside any corner of the Ottoman Empire since the war had begun. Along
with a thorough rundown of the political and economic situation of the
region, Aaronsohn detailed the health and medical crises facing it, the
condition of its roads and railways, and meticulously listed the
location and size of most every Turkish garrison guarding the Syrian
coast. He even noted how many gendarmes currently policed Beirut, and
what weapons they carried.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Aaronsohn continued to be shuttled from office to
office, ministry to ministry, repeatedly asked to tell his whole story
over from the beginning. From no quarter, it seemed, was any effort
being made toward returning him to the war theater, let alone trying to
establish contact with his spy network back in Palestine.</p>
<p>Part of the issue was surely simple bureaucratic ineptitude, but
perhaps joined to this was a kind of collective disbelief on British
officials’ part at what they’d been handed. Then as now, intelligence
agents were accustomed to getting small slivers of information from a
wide variety of sources and trying to fit those slivers together to form
a portrait; it was very unusual, even suspicious, to be handed all of it
in one fell swoop. Contributing to this was an element of blithe
anti-Semitism that permeated the British government at the time—as it
did most European governments—which provided as a starting point that a
Jew wasn’t to be completely trusted until he proved himself worthy. In
the arena of espionage, that created a paradox hard to rise out of. In
an eleven-page analysis of Aaronsohn’s Palestine report, an intelligence
officer with the War Trade Intelligence Department conceded that the
information was “very correct” wherever it could be verified, but also
noted the informant was a Zionist and “of the Romanian type of Jew.”
That description apparently validated the agent’s conclusion: “Of course
we do not know the object of his visit to this country, but he might be
just as observant of things here as he has been in Turkey and a purveyor
of information of the conditions in England if he should get back to
Turkey.”</p>
<p>Naturally, all this was quite invisible to Aaronsohn. Instead, as the
interminable delay in London dragged on, the scientist increasingly
fretted that perhaps the problem stemmed from the conversation he’d had
at 30 Broadway Gate on October 30.</p>
<p>Answering that invitation to call on Mark Sykes, Aaronsohn had
appeared at the London townhouse promptly at 9:30. Repairing to the
exquisitely furnished study, the two men had soon been joined by a
third. This was Gerald FitzMaurice, the former dragoman to the British
embassy in Constantinople and now one of Sykes’s key allies in the
British power structure. While Aaronsohn provided few details of what
the three discussed during their ninety-minute conversation—“we talk of
Zionism,” he noted in his diary—he’d initially thought it had gone very
well. Weeks later, though, with his London stay reaching the one-month
mark, he fell to second-guessing. “I was probably too open with them,”
he wrote on November 24, “and they took it as a ruse. Or they are
distracted or turning a blind eye. Or maybe they saw it as naivete on my
part.”</p>
<p>In fact, Aaronsohn’s apprehensions couldn’t have been more misplaced.
Even if he kept it fairly discreet, Mark Sykes could be counted among a
small but influential group of British statesmen who had begun turning
their thoughts to the creation of a Jewish enclave in Palestine. What’s
more, in Aaron Aaronsohn he saw a man who might play a signal role in
bringing that idea to fruition.</p>
<p>Part of Sykes’s motive was rooted in religiosity. A devout Catholic,
he regarded a return of the ancient tribe of Israel to the Holy Land as
a way to correct a nearly two-thousand-year-old wrong. That view had
taken on new passion and urgency with the massacres of the Armenians. To
Sykes, in that ongoing atrocity, the Ottoman Empire had proven it could
never again be trusted to protect its religious minority populations. At
war’s end, the Christian and Jewish Holy Land of Palestine would be
taken from it, and the failure of the Crusades made right.</p>
<p>But it was not just religiosity; Sykes also saw a potentially huge
political advantage in this. The Jews were an influential but deeply
factionalized presence throughout the Western world, with most either
staying neutral or siding with the Central Powers so far in the war. A
chief cause was the inclusion of the notoriously anti-Semitic czarist
Russia in the Entente; even many British Jews could barely bring
themselves to support an alliance that included the despised regime in
Petrograd. By the Entente’s coming out in strong support of a Jewish
homeland in Palestine, Sykes believed, it would inevitably turn the
opinion of international Jewry toward its side. In turn, the advocacy of
American Jews—a small but powerful constituency—might finally provide
the spur for bringing the United States into the war.</p>
<p>This idea had already been promoted by a British statesman far more
powerful than Mark Sykes. In March 1915, the home secretary, Herbert
Samuel, had put to the cabinet that Palestine be made a British
protectorate at war’s end, and Jewish emigration actively encouraged
toward the eventual creation of a majority-Jewish enclave. That
resolution had been quickly and quietly shot down by the cabinet—the
potential ramifications of such a momentous course of action were too
far-reaching to countenance—but the notion had lingered on. When put in
charge of hashing out an agreement with Georges-Picot on a framework for
the postwar Middle East, Mark Sykes had taken it up again.</p>
<p>Immediately a potential obstacle presented itself. In his
correspondence with Emir Hussein, Henry McMahon had specifically listed
all those territories to be excluded from Arab sovereignty or subject to
later negotiation, but nowhere had he mentioned—let alone made a claim
for—Palestine. A strict reading of that correspondence, therefore, could
only lead to the conclusion that Palestine was to be part of the
independent Arab nation. That was not such a big obstacle as far as Mark
Sykes was concerned; since he and Georges-Picot were ignoring most other
promises made to Hussein as they carved the Middle East into imperial
spheres, what was the harm in adding Palestine to the mix? In the draft
version of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, that Syrian province had been
penciled in to fall under the “international administration” of Britain,
France, and Russia.</p>
<p>But even this arrangement wouldn’t bring about the British-protected
Jewish state that Sykes envisioned, nor could it possibly be a
harmonious one. As he conceded in a March 1916 cable to George Buchanan,
the British ambassador to Russia, “Arab Christians and Moslems alike
would fight in the matter to the last man against Jewish Dominion in
Palestine.” At the same time, the Jews were stoutly opposed to an
international administration there, while the French and Russians would
most certainly oppose a solely British one. To break the logjam, Sykes
informed Buchanan, he’d bandied about a new idea with Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>A peculiar signature of Sykes’s “solutions” was a kind of
quasi-scientific notion that fantastic intricacy might lead to ultimate
simplicity, as if the world were a motor vehicle in which, once its
myriad moving parts were properly aligned, all would hum along nicely.
So it was with his new idea for Palestine. Invoking Herbert Samuel’s
cabinet resolution of a year before, he proposed that Palestine be put
under a British protectorate; that Emir Hussein appoint one of his sons
as the sultan of an independent Palestine; that Britain and France
jointly act as the sultanate’s guarantor; while simultaneously a
“privileged chartered company” be established for the purpose of buying
up land for Jewish colonization. “I regret complicated problem requires
complex settlement,” Sykes concluded to Buchanan, “but under above
France gets a position in Palestine, Russian demands are satisfied,
Arabs have a Prince, Zionists get constitutional position and have
British protection, which I understand they desire.”</p>
<p>But lest the champagne be uncorked too soon, Sykes’s neat formula
elided some inconvenient realities. First, Samuel’s proposal of the
previous year had been rejected out of hand by the cabinet. Second,
Sykes had floated his plan without clearing it with any of his
superiors—and floated it to the chief French negotiator deciding the
future composition of the Middle East, no less. The day after Sykes’s
cable to Buchanan had reached his desk, Foreign Secretary Edward Grey
wrote a withering rebuke, ordering Sykes to “obliterate from his memory
that the Samuel’s Cabinet memorandum made any mention of a British
Protectorate.… I told Mr. Samuel at the time that a British Protectorate
was quite out of the question and Sir M. Sykes should never mention the
subject without making this clear.”</p>
<p>That slapdown may have led to greater discretion on Sykes’s part, but
it certainly didn’t cool his ardor for thinking creatively when it came
to Palestine. Through the spring and summer of 1916, he held a series of
private discussions with Moses Gaster, a leader of the British Zionist
movement, to keep the ideas percolating. It was when he met Aaron
Aaronsohn, however, that his passions returned to full flourish.
According to Sykes’s biographer, Roger Adelson, “If Rabbi Gaster a few
months before had provided Sykes with the grace-note of Zionism in
Europe, here was Aaronsohn who had actually played the trumpet in
Palestine. Sykes liked the sound of it.”</p>
<p>Zionist historian Isaiah Friedman was more specific: “How deeply Sir
Mark Sykes was impressed by Aaronsohn can be gathered from the confident
and close relations which later developed between them.” Citing other
British wartime officials who would soon be heavily influenced by
Aaronsohn’s views, Friedman argued that “it would be reasonable to
suppose that it was he who was the decisive influence in Sykes’s
conversion to Zionism.”</p>
<p>Indeed, even if he second-guessed it as his days in London dragged
on, Aaronsohn’s diary entry on the Broadway Gate meeting alluded to the
alliance that was already taking form. “FitzMaurice is in favour of the
‘fait accompli’ in Palestine,” he jotted, meaning a Jewish homeland,
“[but] the Allies are not yet in agreement.… [Sykes] hopes we will
succeed in altering the English viewpoint, ‘but it requires work.’”</p>
<p>Where Aaronsohn would contribute to that work was in Cairo. On
November 24, the same day that he worried in his diary over the
impression he might have made on Sykes, the scientist began packing for
the ship that would take him to Egypt. There he would join forces with
British military intelligence and try to reactivate his long-dormant spy
ring. In Egypt Aaronsohn would also eventually reunite with Mark Sykes.
Together, they would concoct a scheme that was to help dramatically
reshape the British government’s view on the creation of a
British-protected Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>DESPITE THE FUROR his November 17 memo had spawned, with Lawrence’s
brief sojourn to the Hejaz at an end, there were no plans to send him
back. To the contrary, Gilbert Clayton intended to put his literary
skills and fluency in Arabic to use in a new desk job in Cairo, heading
up the Arab Bureau’s fledgling propaganda department. That Lawrence was
to escape this mundane fate was due to the intercession of a most
unlikely patron: Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>Shortly after learning he would be taking over from McMahon in Cairo,
and thus in direct charge of the Hejaz operation, Wingate had petitioned
for an expanded roster of advisors and intelligence officers to serve in
Arabia; of most pressing concern was to attach a liaison officer to
Faisal in the mountains above Rabegh. The logical choice to head up this
British military mission, all agreed, was Lawrence’s titular supervisor
at the Arab Bureau, Stewart Newcombe. But with Newcombe on assignment in
Europe until sometime in December, Wingate urged that someone else be
sent as his temporary stand-in, and he quite naturally thought of the
impressive young captain who had just visited him in Khartoum. On
November 12, the day after Lawrence left the Sudanese capital, Wingate
cabled Clayton in Cairo suggesting that Lawrence be sent back to Yenbo
to manage things until Newcombe arrived. Clayton, thinking of the
propaganda department he wanted Lawrence to head, tried to deflect the
request, but Wingate wouldn’t take no for an answer.</p>
<p>“Pending Newcombe’s arrival,” he reiterated on November 14, “I wish
Lawrence to proceed to Yenbo by first possible opportunity. It is
vitally important to have an officer of his exceptional knowledge of
Arabs in close touch with Faisal [at this] critical juncture.” He then
reassured Clayton this was to be only a temporary measure, and that
Lawrence would be returned to Cairo once Newcombe came on the scene.
Under such pressure, Clayton had no choice but to relent.</p>
<p>Of course, all this occurred before Lawrence wrote his incendiary
memorandum taking direct aim at Wingate’s plans in Arabia. By the time
Wingate saw that memo, his lavish praise of Lawrence was already a
matter of record, as was his insistence that Lawrence return to Yenbo.
Even if Wingate wished to punish the young captain for his temerity,
there was now no graceful way to do it.</p>
<p>But excelling at bureaucratic infighting is not simply about coming
out on top. True mastery comes with the ability to so cover one’s tracks
as to appear utterly blameless, and this was a game Clayton and Lawrence
played with consummate skill. Before the month of November was over,
Colonel Brémond would receive a stern telegram from the commander in
chief of the French armed forces, Marshal Joseph Joffre. After obliquely
referring to an “agreement” worked out with the British—the Sykes-Picot
pact—Joffre rebuked Brémond for ever suggesting that France wished to
prevent an Arab capture of Medina. “The already known state of mind of
the British and the Sherif could lead to the belief that we are trying
to renege on the arrangements made and could have serious consequences
for the development of our plans in the Levant. It is important,
therefore, that your attitude does not lend itself to such an
interpretation.”</p>
<p>The sandbagging of Reginald Wingate was even more impressive,
however. On November 23, as the tempest over Lawrence’s memorandum
continued to rage, Clayton sent a “private” cable to Wingate in Khartoum
suggesting that all blame for the controversy rested with Murray.
Perhaps calculating that the bad blood between the sirdar and the EEF
commander meant the particulars would never get sorted out, Clayton went
so far as to suggest that it was Murray who had compelled Lawrence to
write the offending report.</p>
<p>Evidently, Wingate had a pronounced naïve streak: “I have no doubt
that Lawrence has done all this in perfectly good faith,” he wrote Cyril
Wilson on the same day he received Clayton’s cable, “but he appears to
me to be a visionary and his amateur soldiering has evidently given him
an exaggerated idea of the soundness of his views on purely military
matters.” Clearly alluding to Murray, he went on, “I am principally
annoyed in all this matter, not so much on account of the apparent want
of straightness on the part of certain people who should be above that
sort of thing, but on account of the huge loss of time when I am working
at very high pressure.”</p>
<p>Either Wingate never did figure out the extent to which he had been
played by Clayton and Lawrence, or he was an unusually forgiving man; in
just eight months, he would spearhead the effort to award Lawrence the
Victoria Cross, Britain’s highest military honor, for valor in the
field.</p>
<p>But not everyone was so quick to ascribe the best of intentions to
the upstart army captain. One who took a far more jaundiced view was
Cyril Wilson, the British official who had most closely observed
Lawrence in Arabia, and would serve as Lawrence’s direct superior
officer upon his return. Wilson argued strongly against that return on
even a temporary basis, and when presented with a fait accompli let
Gilbert Clayton know his feelings. “Lawrence wants kicking,” he wrote
the Arab Bureau head, “and kicking hard at that; then he would improve.
At present I look upon him as a bumptious young ass who spoils his
undoubted knowledge of Syrian Arabs etc. by making himself out to be the
only authority on war, engineering, running [His Majesty’s] ships and
everything else. He put every single person’s back up I’ve met, from the
Admiral down to the most junior fellow on the Red Sea.”</p>
<p>Of all the deceptions put to paper about the events of that November,
however, surely the most brazen was one Lawrence penned about himself.
It concerned that day toward the end of the month when he was summoned
to Clayton’s office and told he was being sent back to Arabia as a
temporary liaison officer to Faisal ibn Hussein. According to Lawrence’s
account in Seven Pillars, “I urged my complete unfitness for the
job.”</p>

Void</h4>
<p>The situation is so interesting that I think I will fail to come
back.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, IN ARABIA, TO CAIRO HEADQUARTERS, DECEMBER 27,
1916</p>
<p>From the crest of the hill, the night-wrapped valley of Nakhl Mubarak
yielded a startling sight. As Lawrence would recount, glimpsed through
the fronds of the date-palm plantations was “the flame-lit smoke of many
fires,” while the valley echoed with the braying of thousands of excited
camels, gunshots, and the calls of men lost in the darkness.</p>
<p>Accompanied by four tribal escorts, Lawrence had set out from the
port of Yenbo earlier that evening, December 2, 1916. Their destination
was Faisal’s camp in the mountainous enclave of Kheif Hussein, some
forty-five miles inland. With good camels beneath them and riding
steadily, the group had anticipated making the camp just around
daybreak. Instead, a mere five hours into their ride and just
twenty-five miles from the coast, they came upon this puzzling scene in
Nakhl Mubarak; no one in Lawrence’s party had any idea who these masses
of armed men in the valley below might be.</p>
<p>Dismounting, the group quietly descended from the ridgeline until
they came to a deserted home at the valley’s edge. After corralling the
camels and secreting his British charge within the home, the lead escort
slipped a cartridge into his carbine and set out alone on foot to
investigate. He shortly returned with shocking news: the men were
Faisal’s army. Remounting their camels, the group proceeded into the
heart of the valley, the scene more bewildering to Lawrence by the
minute. “There were hundreds of fires of thorn-wood, and round them were
Arabs making coffee or eating, or sleeping muffled like dead men in
their cloaks, packed together closely in the confusion of camels.”</p>
<p>They found Faisal at the center of the encampment, sitting before his
tent with several aides and a scribe. With illumination provided by
slaves holding lanterns, he was alternately dictating orders and
listening to battlefield reports being read aloud to him, the picture of
placidity. It was some time before he dismissed his retinue so that he
might explain the situation to his British guest. That situation wasn’t
good; it was little short of disastrous, in fact.</p>
<p>During Lawrence’s first visit in October, Faisal had outlined an
elaborate plan to take his war campaign north, a way to reduce the
Turkish threat to Rabegh and Mecca by giving the enemy something new to
worry about. That scheme depended on Faisal working in close concert
with the fighting units of his three brothers. While Abdullah harassed
the Turkish forces around Medina, Faisal would move the bulk of his army
northwest through the mountains to Kheif Hussein before closing on the
Turkish-held port of Wejh, some two hundred miles above Yenbo.
Simultaneously, Zeid would come up to protect the approaches to Yenbo,
while Ali brought his army out of Rabegh to guard a crucial intersection
on the pilgrims’ road to Mecca.</p>
<p>Lawrence had thought the plan too complicated by half, reliant as it
was on a level of coordination among the four brothers nearly impossible
to achieve across the great expanse of western Arabia. He’d conveyed his
doubts to Gilbert Clayton in his reports at the time, but apparently had
been less persuasive with Faisal; in mid-November, Faisal had put the
scheme into effect.</p>
<p>For a short while all had gone accordingly, with Faisal taking most
of his forces north to Kheif Hussein. At his back, however,
twenty-year-old Zeid inexplicably left one of the mountain paths leading
to Yenbo completely unguarded, and it was this path that a Turkish
mounted patrol found. Suddenly finding the Turks between them and their
escape route to the coast, Zeid’s charges had promptly scattered in
disarray. That had only been stage one of the fiasco, however. When they
learned of Zeid’s collapse, and fearful that they too might soon be
stranded in the mountains, Faisal’s followers had succumbed to a similar
panicked stampede from Kheif Hussein. Faisal and his lieutenants had
finally halted the flight there in Nakhl Mubarak, but even this, he
confided to Lawrence that night, probably wouldn’t hold; with the
advancing Turks now to the east and south, it seemed just a matter of
time before his entire force—what was left of it—fell all the way back
to Yenbo port itself.</p>
<p>Operating on practically no sleep, Lawrence spent the next
forty-eight hours alternately conferring with Faisal and circulating
among the fighters in Nakhl Mubarak, trying to better gauge the
magnitude of the crisis. He then raced back to Yenbo to raise the alarm.
When he sat down to send an urgent message to Clayton on the morning of
December 5, he was in a state of both exhaustion and despondency. “I had
better preface by saying that I rode all Saturday night, had alarms and
excursions all Sunday night, and rode again all last night, so my total
of sleep is only three hours in the last three nights and I feel rather
pessimistic. All the same, things are bad.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence well knew, the Arab rout in the mountains was much more
than just a military setback. Uniting the northern tribes to his
leadership had required months of painstaking and delicate work on
Faisal’s part, and that was now rapidly coming apart. In his report to
Clayton, Lawrence enumerated those tribes that had already abandoned
Faisal—or appeared ready to—and warned how those defections not only
threatened to leave the road open to a Turkish capture of Mecca, but to
a collapse of the Arab Revolt itself. The crucial point, Lawrence wrote,
was that Faisal was now “a tribal leader, not a leader of tribes,” and
it would take a long time to repair the damage. In this, too, there was
a parallel to the Crusader armies of the Middle Ages that Lawrence had
studied; the extreme fragility of alliances between disparate and
largely autonomous groups meant unity was always one small setback away
from unraveling.</p>
<p>But it was also a personal fiasco for Lawrence. In his October
reports, he had readily conceded the difficulty of ever organizing the
Arab fighters into a conventional fighting force—he’d figured that a
single company of Turkish soldiers, properly entrenched in open country,
could defeat them—but had been both eloquent and persuasive in
emphasizing their potency as a defensive force. “Their real sphere is
guerrilla warfare.… Their initiative, great knowledge of the country,
and mobility, make them formidable in the hills.” Not just formidable;
in Lawrence’s estimation, in such a role they would be all but
impregnable. “From what I have seen of the hills between Bir Abbas and
Bir Ibn Hassani,” he had written, “I do not see how, short of treachery
on the part of the hill tribe[s], the Turks can risk forcing their way
through.” To the contrary, with the hills “a very paradise for snipers,”
he was confident that a mere one or two hundred men could successfully
hold any possible line of Turkish approach toward the coast.</p>
<p>This conviction was one of the cornerstones of Lawrence’s argument
against sending Allied troops into Arabia, and he had maintained it even
after troubling evidence to the contrary. At the beginning of November,
after rumors of a Turkish advance had sent Ali’s men fleeing from the
hills above Rabegh, Lawrence had intimated to Édouard Brémond that
matters would have turned out differently if Faisal had been in charge.
As events now made clear, in this estimation he had been absolutely one
hundred percent wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was embarrassment over how badly he had misjudged the
situation, or perhaps even in his exhaustion Lawrence remained the
ever-vigilant bureaucratic strategist, but before sending off his
pessimistic cable to Clayton, he thought to scribble a postscript. If
reprinted in the Arab Bulletin, his cable would soon be read by all
those in the British leadership who had been won to his nonintervention
argument, so he jotted, “don’t use any of above in Bulletin or
elsewhere; it is not just—because I am done up.”</p>
<p>In response to the deepening crisis, British naval ships began
massing off Yenbo; if the worst did come to pass and Faisal’s men were
put to siege in that town, the ships might at least lay down artillery
fire on the surrounding open plain to slow the Turkish advance. True to
Faisal’s prediction, on the morning of December 9, the vanguard of his
spent force began drifting into the port with the news that they’d been
flushed from Nakhl Mubarak by another Turkish push; by the time the last
stragglers came in, the some five thousand warriors Lawrence had seen
under Fai- sal’s banner just one week earlier had been reduced to fewer
than two thousand. While a handful of the missing three thousand had
fallen in battle, the vast majority had simply abandoned the fight and
gone home to their villages.</p>
<p>So dispiriting was the atmosphere that even Lawrence now had second
thoughts about his most stoutly held belief. Writing to Clayton again on
December 11, he announced that “Faisal has now swung around to the
belief in a British force [being deployed] at Rabegh. I have wired this
to you, and I see myself that his arguments have force. If Zeid had not
been so slack, this would never have got to this pass.” He added a
bitter afterthought: “The Arabs, outside their hills, are
worthless.”</p>
<p>On that same day, Lawrence painted an even more dire picture to Cyril
Wilson. Without British troops in Rabegh, he wrote, Faisal was now of
the opinion that the whole revolution might collapse within three weeks’
time.</p>
<p>TO THE PUZZLEMENT of many residents, on the morning of May 31, 1916,
a German warplane had appeared in the skies over Jerusalem and proceeded
to execute a series of tight circles just to the west of the walled Old
City. Finally, a small weighted object was thrown from the plane that
landed in the street directly in front of the Hotel Fast, the favored
watering hole of German officers in Jerusalem. Upon closer inspection,
the packet was found to be a bundled German flag with a note inside from
Curt Prüfer. He was returning to the city that evening, the note
explained, and he wanted his cook to prepare a “good dinner” for him. It
was the sort of flamboyant act that Prüfer probably never would have
performed in his prior incarnation as a spy chief, but it was very much
in keeping with the colorful antics of his new comrades in arms, the
spotters and machine gunners and flying “aces” of the German
Fliegertruppen, or Flying Corps.</p>
<p>In preparation for a renewed Turco-German offensive against the Suez
Canal, in the early spring of 1916 a new German air squadron had been
brought down and based in Beersheva, at the eastern end of the Sinai
Peninsula. Tiring of his propaganda and surveillance duties in Syria and
eager to play an active role in the coming attack, Prüfer had petitioned
to be made an aerial spotter for Field Aviation Detachment 300.</p>
<p>The request was a somewhat puzzling one, given that Prüfer had
remained dubious about the wisdom of a second attempt on the Suez since
having participated in the first. As far back as August 1915, in a
detailed report to the German ambassador in Constantinople, he’d argued
that for such an offensive to have even a minimal chance of success, it
could not at all resemble Djemal’s haphazard “reconnaissance in force”
of the previous February, but would require a massive investment of
manpower and resources: road- and railway-building crews, crack Turkish
troops, German aircraft and officers and artillery. Of course, he
pointed out, the very scale of that investment meant a multiplying of
the logistical hurdles in keeping such a force supplied and fed and
watered across the Sinai sands. Simultaneously, it rendered the notion
of somehow catching the British by surprise “unthinkable.” “With all
their war machines,” he wrote, “you’d have to conduct a siege and bash
their defenses with artillery before you could march into Egypt, after
which you would need to maintain a line of supply from Palestine and
Syria.”</p>
<p>But even if all this could be accomplished, Prüfer had pointed out,
capturing the canal just might not ultimately be very significant. After
all, with the British navy in complete command of the seas, it wasn’t as
if the Suez would suddenly become useful to the Germans or Turks. As for
the argument that cinching off this maritime shortcut would disrupt the
flow of British territorial troops to Europe by forcing them to take the
long way around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, this was certainly true, but
the two- to three-week delay that would cause hardly rose above the
level of inconvenience. To the German intelligence agent, the plans for
a second Suez operation had seemed to underscore the old maxim that war
can kill all things except bad ideas.</p>
<p>Against this, though, a powerful, personal lure had worked on him:
Detachment 300, the “glamour” of air war. In contrast to the hideous
reality of life and death in the trenches, an aura of romance had
instantly attached to this newest form of warfare, with the pilot aces
of all sides transformed into newsreel heroes and matinee idols. Prüfer,
never much of a man’s man, clearly reveled in being in the company of
such Übermenschen at Beersheva, and the months he spent with Detachment
300 were undoubtedly among the happiest of his life, a carefree time of
late-night drinking sessions, or flying off to Jerusalem or Jaffa at a
moment’s notice to attend diplomatic receptions or social dances. There
seemed to be an almost starstruck quality to it; in contrast to the
scant details Prüfer normally jotted in his wartime diary—when he
bothered to keep it at all—he made careful note of the names of most all
the Detachment 300 pilots for posterity. In the dropping of his note in
front of the Hotel Fast to order up a meal, the soft-spoken former
scholar was emulating the pranks of his new, larger-than-life
comrades—and undoubtedly deriving considerable pride over his excellent
aim.</p>
<p>Very shortly after that lark, however, had come news of the Arab
Revolt in the Hejaz. Apparently forgetting his own oft-repeated
assertion that the Arabs were too cowardly to ever rebel, Prüfer’s first
response had been a certain smugness, remarking in his diary, “I rightly
warned them about the Sherif [Hussein].” As the revolt spread, however,
and one Turkish garrison after another in Arabia came under siege, he
remembered his old mentor, Max von Oppenheim, and the tremendous efforts
the propaganda chief had made to forestall this day from coming. “The
situation in Arabia goes badly for the Turks,” he noted in early July.
“Poor Oppenheim!”</p>
<p>But Prüfer had soon turned his attention back to more immediate
concerns, as preparations got under way for the new Suez offensive. As
an aerial spotter, he quite literally had a bird’s-eye view when the
Turkish vanguard launched its attack against the British railhead at
Romani, some twenty-five miles east of the canal, on the morning of
August 4, 1916. While that vantage point afforded him the opportunity to
hurl a few bombs down on the enemy—bombs that in those early days of air
combat were little more than large hand grenades—it also allowed him to
grasp the full magnitude of the Turco-German defeat as it unfolded over
the next two days.</p>
<p>Hoping to catch the British in a flanking move, the attacking force
was instead caught out in the open and enveloped. By the afternoon of
August 5, the Turkish army was in headlong retreat, having suffered some
six thousand casualties, about one-third its total strength, and a toll
that undoubtedly would have been higher if the British hadn’t slowed
their pursuit out of sheer exhaustion in the 120-degree heat.</p>
<p>The rout at Romani ended forever the Turco-German dream of
“liberating” Egypt. It also ended Prüfer’s four-month idyll with
Detachment 300, for it forced him to finally acknowledge something he’d
tried very hard to ignore: he was desperately ill. There had been terse
little clues to it in his diary for some time—“I am unwell,” he had
noted back in mid-May—but now, his face sunken and his weight down to
little more than a hundred pounds, even his handwriting betrayed him;
gone was his emphatic, jerky script, replaced by a trembling, barely
legible scrawl. Diagnosed as suffering from both cholera and
tuberculosis, he was placed on medical leave and shuttled back to
Germany in early October. After several weeks’ recuperation in a Berlin
hospital, he began helping out in the mapping division of the Reserve
General Staff on Wilhelmstrasse.</p>
<p>In that capacity, the arc of Curt Prüfer’s wartime experience
completed a curious reverse symmetry with that of one of his adversaries
in the field, British army captain T. E. Lawrence. During the first two
years of the war, Lawrence had spent most of his time deskbound in the
mapping room of the Arab Bureau in Cairo, while Curt Prüfer seemed to be
everywhere: launching sabotage and spying missions against British
Egypt, participating in two major offensives, unmasking potential
enemies of the Ottoman and German cause throughout Syria. By the end of
1916, it was now Lawrence who was in the field as Prüfer whiled away his
days in a mapping room in Berlin.</p>
<p>And a most prosaic existence it was. By January 1917, with his
medical leave in Germany extended, Prüfer found himself battling with
the local food rationing office in Berlin over his bread allotment. As
he complained in cables to both his former colleagues in Constantinople
and senior officials at the foreign ministry, without written
confirmation of his leave extension, the Bread Commission was refusing
to issue him the required ration card, and he beseeched their help in
sorting out the problem as soon as possible. It was a very long way from
dropping dinner orders out of airplanes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was the strong likelihood that it was with such
mundane concerns that Curt Prüfer’s wartime career would end. With his
congenitally frail health, the Orientalist had only been inducted into
the German military back in 1914 through the intercession of Max von
Oppenheim, and his health was obviously far more ravaged now. Once
again, though, the self-proclaimed baron from Cologne would come to his
protégé’s aid, offering Prüfer an escape route from his semi-invalid
duties in Berlin.</p>
<p>Having thus far failed to ignite a pan-Islamic jihad in the Middle
East that would play to Germany’s political and military benefit,
Oppenheim, according to Prüfer biographer Donald McKale, was now
expanding his ambitions into the economic sphere. What he envisioned, in
the wake of the coming Central Powers victory, was a vast German
economic consortium that might dominate commerce and resource
development throughout the region for decades to come. In the count’s
scheme, the vehicle for this domination was to be a unique partnership
between the German government and the nation’s private industrial
conglomerates, the two working hand in glove for both personal and
national interest. A man with a deep, perhaps exaggerated appreciation
for the power of the printed word, Oppenheim worked up an alluring
packet of brochures and prospectuses to dazzle German businessmen with
visions of the wealth that could soon be theirs in the far-off lands of
the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>As Oppenheim explained to would-be investors, nothing more
exemplified the symbiotic relationship between public and private that
he envisioned for the East than the role soon to be assumed by his young
protégé, Curt Prüfer, in Constantinople. As the new head of the German
intelligence bureau there, Prüfer would also serve as the primary
conduit for investors trying to navigate Turkey’s bureaucratic shoals.
German industrialists could hardly ask for a better friend; here was a
man who not only knew the region and Young Turk power structure
intimately, but had a proven record of getting things done by whatever
creative means necessary.</p>
<p>Just as with his notion of anticolonial Islamic jihad, Max von
Oppenheim’s economic scheme would prove a bit ahead of its time,
presaging as it did the so-called national corporatism model first
successfully harnessed by Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the
1920s, and then to even more spectacular effect a decade later by
Mussolini’s protégé, Adolf Hitler. For Curt Prüfer in 1917, however, it
simply meant a return to the field. In late February, he bid goodbye to
his mapping-room colleagues in Berlin and set out for the Middle East
once more.</p>
<p>FOR COLONEL ÉDOUARD BRÉMOND, watching Captain T. E. Lawrence come off
the deck of HMS Suva in Jeddah harbor on December 12 must have been a
particularly gladdening sight, something very much like revenge. Even if
he’d yet to put together that Lawrence was the prime mover behind the
rebuke he had received from the French War Ministry weeks earlier,
Brémond most certainly now recognized him as a troublemaker, the man who
more than any other British field officer had poisoned the well for
sending Allied troops to Arabia. But now a rather different figure stood
before the French colonel, one shorn of his arrogance and supreme
self-assurance. Lawrence was just coming in from Yenbo, where he had
witnessed firsthand the pell-mell retreat of Faisal’s forces before the
advancing Turks, and the experience seemed to have stripped the irksome
little captain of his romantic notions of the brave Arab warrior.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the belief that they were finally on the same page, or
perhaps Brémond couldn’t resist the temptation to stick the knife in a
little, but on the Jeddah dock he informed Lawrence that he was just
then on his way to meet with Reginald Wingate in Khartoum. In light of
the unfolding crisis on the Arabian coast, he intended to once again
press for the dispatch of an Anglo-French force to Rabegh.</p>
<p>Lawrence had no doubt Brémond would find a receptive audience. Sure
enough, on December 14, and with Colonel Brémond at his side, Wingate
fired off another secret cable to the Foreign Office and General Murray
in Cairo urging that a brigade be sent as soon as possible. “I can see
no alternative or practical means of assisting Arabs, and of saving
Sherif’s movement from collapse,” Wingate wrote. “Sherif has cancelled
his original application to us to dispatch European troops, but is [now]
genuinely alarmed at situation and, in Colonel Brémond’s opinion, with a
little pressure would again ask for them.” The immediate question before
them, Wingate argued, “is whether we shall make a last attempt to save
Sherif and his Arabs in spite of themselves.”</p>
<p>Except, unbeknownst to most everyone at that moment, the immediate
crisis in western Arabia had actually already passed. On the night of
December 11, just hours after Lawrence left Yenbo on the Suva, a large
Turkish force had approached the town, only to hesitate upon seeing the
British ships in the harbor, their searchlights illuminating the
surrounding countryside as if in daylight. Apparently the Arabs’ mortal
fear of artillery was shared by the Turks, for this force soon turned
back from Yenbo; within days, aerial reconnaissance showed it had
retreated into the mountains, perhaps was even on its way back to
Medina. While this development didn’t necessarily mean an end of the
Turkish threat to the coastal towns, it did create breathing space—and
breathing space wasn’t at all helpful to the two escalationists in
Khartoum. In coming weeks, Wingate and Brémond would find several more
occasions to press for intervention, but they had lost their last best
chance with the Turkish withdrawal outside Yenbo.</p>
<p>Within several days of that threat passing, a somewhat chastened
Lawrence was back in Yenbo, trying to figure out with Faisal what might
come next. They were aided in their planning by a rather momentous
development in London. Just weeks earlier, the coalition government of
Herbert Asquith had fallen, and been replaced by a new coalition
government led by David Lloyd George. The new prime minister was
determined to break with the “Westerner” mind-set that had prevailed in
London since the beginning of the war, which held that ultimate victory
could only be achieved on the Western Front. That mind-set had led to
the deaths of some 400,000 British soldiers by the end of 1916, with no
end or breakthrough in sight. Instead, Lloyd George wanted to pursue an
“Easterner” policy, to try to “knock out the props” of the enemy war
machine by striking at its weakest spots. At least by comparison to the
seemingly impregnable wall of the Western Front, that meant the Balkans
and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Shortly after Lawrence’s return to Yenbo, this new focus became
evident in an increased British presence on the Hejazi coast—not the
thousands of regulars hoped for by Wingate and Brémond, but rather an
assortment of instructors and advisors tasked to transform the
undisciplined Arab rebel bands into a credible fighting force. The most
interesting of these expanded operations took place in Yenbo, the
northernmost rebel-held port and now deemed relatively safe from Turkish
attack. With the Hejaz Railway, the Turks’ lifeline to their garrison in
Medina, situated a mere ninety miles inland, the British envisioned
using Yenbo as the staging ground for a committed campaign of sabotage
attacks on the railroad, and to this end they brought in a colorful
figure named Herbert Garland. A tall, rangy Scotsman, Garland had been a
chemist before the war and by tinkering in the training grounds in Cairo
had become a self-taught expert in blowing things up. In the few forays
the Arabs had conducted against the Hejaz Railway prior to his arrival,
they had simply torn up the tracks with picks and shovels, a very simple
business to mend, and Garland now set about teaching them the fine art
of placing an explosive charge beneath a rail in such a way as to mangle
it beyond repair. In the doldrum rebuilding days at Yenbo of early
January 1917, one of Major Garland’s most attentive students was T. E.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>But despite his dealings with Garland and the several other British
advisors now setting up shop in the port town, there was something that
set Lawrence quite apart from his countrymen. Part of it was obvious:
his dress.</p>
<p>During Lawrence’s visit to the Arab encampment in Nakhl Mubarak in
early December, Faisal had suggested he dispense with his British army
uniform in favor of Arab dress; that way, the British liaison officer
could circulate through the camp and call upon Faisal at his leisure
without drawing undue attention. Lawrence had taken to this suggestion
with alacrity, donning the white robes and gold sashing normally
reserved for a senior sheikh. He had changed out of those robes during
his brief run down the coast to Jeddah, but had immediately put them on
again upon his return to Yenbo.</p>
<p>Yet he stood apart for far more than just his attire. Taking his
temporary posting as Faisal’s liaison very much to heart, Lawrence
largely eschewed the British tent settlement at the water’s edge to
spend most of his time at the sprawling Arab encampment several miles
inland. There, and with far more tolerance than most other British
officers might reasonably muster, he set about adapting to the peculiar
lassitude with which Faisal ran his “army.”</p>
<p>The typical day started with a dawn wake‑up call by an imam, then a
leisurely breakfast where Faisal conferred with his senior aides and
various tribal leaders. This was followed by a long morning stretch
during which any man in the encampment could come to petition Faisal
over some concern or grievance; as Lawrence quickly noted, few of these
audiences had any direct connection to the war effort. This open-house
session only ended with the serving of lunch, often a two-hour affair
attended by more aides and tribal leaders, after which Faisal might
spend a couple of hours dictating messages to his scribes. That work
done, it was more chitchat until an evening meal consumed at an even
more languorous pace than the previous one. After that, more dictations
by Faisal, more conversations with elders, the reading of reports from
various scouting parties, an unhurried, undirected process that might
stretch well past midnight—even right up to the imam’s dawn call that
signaled it was all about to start over again.</p>
<p>For a famously impatient and ascetic man like T. E. Lawrence, it must
have been a kind of agony. In normal times, he was so indifferent to
food and meals that his preference was to eat standing up and to finish
in less than five minutes. Probably even more trying for a man who
abhorred physical contact—he avoided even the shaking of hands if he
could do so without offense—was the easy affection on constant display
in the Arab camp, the endless embraces and kissing of cheeks, the casual
holding of hands.</p>
<p>But Lawrence also recognized that this was the Arab way of war and
peace. Faisal was not just a wartime leader, but a Hejazi chieftain, and
the long, seemingly purposeless conversations were the glue that kept
his fractious coalition together. In this culture, Faisal was not a
general who issued orders—at least not to men not of his tribe—but a
consensus builder compelled to cajole, counsel, and listen. Certainly,
none of this was going to change to accommodate the Arabs’ British
advisors. To the contrary, Lawrence understood, it was he and his
countrymen who had to adapt if they hoped to be accepted and effective.
It was a pretty simple truism, but one that many of his colleagues,
steeped in British notions of both military and cultural hierarchy, had
a very hard time with.</p>
<p>Animating Lawrence’s determination to adapt was the figure of Faisal
ibn Hussein himself. Even in the darkest days of the revolt, when he had
visited the Arabs’ temporary refuge at Nakhl Mubarak, Lawrence had been
struck by Faisal’s unshaken ambition, a quality that had tempered his
own pessimism over the situation. As he had reported to Gilbert Clayton
on December 5, “I heard [Faisal] address the head of one battalion last
night before sending them out to an advanced position over the Turkish
camp at Bir Said. He did not say much, no noise about it, but it was all
exactly right and the people rushed over one another with joy to kiss
his headrope when he finished. He has had a nasty knock in Zeid’s
retreat, and he realized perfectly well that it was the ruin of all his
six months’ work up here in the hills tying tribe to tribe and fixing
each in its proper area. Yet he took it all in public as a joke,
chaffing people on the way they had run away, jeering at them like
children, but without in the least hurting their feelings, and making
the others feel that nothing much had happened that could not be put
right. He is magnificent, for to me privately he was most horribly cut
up.”</p>
<p>Faisal had displayed that same spirit in Yenbo. On December 20, when
it was clear the Turks were falling back toward Medina, he had beseeched
his brother Ali to come north out of Rabegh with his army of some seven
thousand, while Faisal took his own forces back up into the mountains;
the hope was to catch the withdrawing Turks in a pincer movement. Alas,
Ali proved no better a warrior leader than brother Zeid. Within days,
his army had panicked and turned back for Rabegh on yet another
erroneous rumor of a Turkish force ahead, and a disappointed Faisal saw
no option but to return with his own men to Yenbo.</p>
<p>To most other British officers who observed the incident, it was
another example of the ineptitude of the Arab forces, that at least
twice now they had fled the field on the mere rumor of a Turkish
presence. Lawrence saw things quite differently. Fresh from their recent
rout in the mountains, the prudent course would have been for Faisal to
keep his men under the protection of the British naval guns at Yenbo
while they regrouped; instead, he had tried to leap to the offensive the
moment an opportunity presented itself. It spoke of a determination in
Faisal sorely lacking in his brothers.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, with both Rabegh and Yenbo now looking at least
temporarily secure, Faisal returned to the idea of taking his campaign
north and seizing the port town of Wejh. With Wejh in rebel hands, not
only would the British supply line from Egypt be brought two hundred
miles closer, but the easier terrain would allow for more frequent raids
inland against the Hejaz Railway. Over long discussions with Lawrence,
the two came up with a stripped-down version of Faisal’s earlier plan,
one that relied far less heavily on support from his now proven
unreliable brothers.</p>
<p>But planning that advance must have been a bittersweet exercise for
Lawrence. As he well knew, his time in Arabia was rapidly drawing to a
close. Despite a series of delays in Europe, Stewart Newcombe would soon
be on his way to take up his permanent position with Faisal, and
Lawrence bundled back to his desk job at the Arab Bureau.</p>
<p>It was a fate he had tried to forestall through a campaign of quiet
subversion ever since returning to the Hejaz. A chief target of that
campaign had been his temporary field supervisor, Lieutenant Colonel
Cyril Wilson. Quite aware of Wilson’s fierce opposition to even his
temporary posting in Arabia, Lawrence had sought to sidestep the
resident agent in Jeddah by playing directly to the higher powers in
Cairo. That scheme had started with his very first cable back to Gilbert
Clayton on December 5. “One of the things not fixed when I came down
here,” Lawrence wrote, “was my [supervisory] chief, and my manner of
reporting. It is probably through Colonel Wilson, but as there is a post
going to Egypt tonight I am sending this direct.”</p>
<p>In fact, it had been made perfectly clear to Lawrence that Wilson was
his chief in the field, so his confusion on this point was more than a
little disingenuous. It established a precedent, however, one that
Lawrence soon reemployed when Wilson tried to clip his wings by
appointing him to the lowly post of supply officer in Yenbo. In
protesting this assignment to Clayton—“I regard myself as primarily an
Intelligence Officer, or liaison with Faisal”—Lawrence also thought to
explain that he was sending his latest reports to Cairo, rather than
routing them through Wilson, because “if they are to be any good at all
they should reach you within a reasonable period of dispatch—and to send
them to Jeddah is only [the] waste of a week or ten days.” That
rationale would have lost some of its persuasiveness had it been known
that Lawrence was actually on a ship en route to Jeddah when he wrote
it.</p>
<p>As December wore on, his campaign became only more overt. Not for
Lawrence any beseeching pleas for reconsideration; instead, he assumed
the posture that his continuing on in Arabia was a foregone conclusion.
“If I am to stay here,” he wrote Clayton’s deputy at the end of the
month, once again sidestepping Wilson, “I will need all sorts of things.
Have you any news of Newcombe? The situation is so interesting that I
think I will fail to come back. I want to rub off my British habits and
go off with Faisal for a bit.” As if that desire was somehow already a
part of his government’s planning, Lawrence then laid out his
intentions. “When I have someone to take over here from me, I’ll go off.
Wadi Ais is the unknown area of N. Hejaz, and I want to drop up and see
it, [and] anything behind Rudhwa will be worth while.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>IT WAS LESS a failed regime, perhaps, than a fantastically deluded
one. Across the breadth of Syria by the close of 1916, an estimated
half-million people had already died of starvation or disease, and
conditions appeared slated to only grow worse in the new year. On the
military front, Turkish forces had been thrown back from the Suez Canal
anew, the garrison in Medina was one of the last holdouts against the
Arab rebels in the Hejaz, and the British were once again marching up
the Tigris toward Baghdad. Yet in his governor’s mansions in Jerusalem
and Damascus, Djemal Pasha continued to pore over blueprints for new
canalworks and roadways, continued to attend ribbon-cutting ceremonies
for the inauguration of schools and hospitals. It was as if he clung
more tenaciously to his self-image as a progressive reformer because of
the cascade of ruin all around him rather than in spite of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason was that the Syrian governor was becoming ever
more divorced from the power elites in Constantinople. In the Ottoman
capital, the criticisms of Djemal had reached new heights with the
outbreak of the Arab Revolt, but in what was now an established pattern,
those criticisms ran the gamut from his having been too harsh—a common
view, one embraced by most historians, was that his executions of the
Arab nationalist leaders had provoked the rebellion—to his being far too
lenient. To this latter charge, Djemal’s penchant for glibness didn’t
help his cause; when Julius Loytved-Hardegg, the German consul in
Damascus, asked whatever had possessed him to allow Faisal ibn Hussein
to leave for Arabia on the eve of the revolt, Djemal replied that he’d
done it to test Faisal’s true colors. As Loytved-Hardegg acerbically
noted in his report of the meeting, “the present time doesn’t seem
especially appropriate” for such a test.</p>
<p>Also irritating to Constantinople was Djemal’s curious streak of
courtliness toward Europeans in general, and the French in particular,
as evidenced by his continuing to allow many of these “belligerent
nationals” to stay on in Syria without restriction. A notable exception
to his Europhilia was the European nation to which his government was
militarily allied; Djemal loathed most everything about Germany and its
culture, and could be quite expansive in enumerating its deficiencies to
anyone within earshot.</p>
<p>As the war ground on, however, and Frenchmen became a rarer commodity
in Syria—thanks in no small part to the ferreting-out skills of German
agents like Curt Prüfer—the governor seemed to transfer his affections
to a different expatriate community, the Americans. To the cloistered
faithful of the American Colony, a conservative religious sect that had
established itself in Jerusalem in the 1890s, Djemal was a frequent and
welcome guest; surviving photographs show Colony children crawling over
Djemal’s lap, much to his evident delight. Similarly, Howard Bliss, the
president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the American
University of Beirut), was so grateful for Djemal’s support of the
institution, ensuring that it received subsidized food shipments in the
midst of the Lebanon famine, that in late January 1917 he invited the
governor to be the university’s commencement speaker.</p>
<p>At that time, the U.S. consul in Damascus, Samuel Edelman, was having
his own rather odd experience with Djemal, one that began with his
answering a summons to the governor’s Damascus office on January 20. For
some months, Edelman had been trying to arrange the safe passage from
Syria of some five hundred American citizens eager to escape the
worsening conditions, but his efforts had been stymied by Ottoman
authorities. Certainly not helping matters was the recent reelection of
Woodrow Wilson as president. Despite the campaign slogan that had helped
carry him to reelection—“He kept us out of the war”—there were growing
signs that Wilson intended to bring the United States in on the side of
the Allies, and Constantinople was understandably loath to release
hundreds of foreigners with firsthand knowledge of the situation in
Syria, and whose government might soon join the enemy camp. In his
meeting with Edelman on January 20, Djemal offered a novel solution. As
the nonplussed consul cabled to his embassy in Constantinople, Djemal
would now agree to let the five hundred Americans leave so long as they
gave their word of honor “not to discuss Ottoman affairs until the end
of war.” Not surprisingly, American diplomats swiftly agreed to these
patently unenforceable terms and set about arranging the departure of
their citizens from Syria.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t as if Djemal was compliant to the entreaties of all
Americans. One who didn’t get his way in one particular incident was the
Standard Oil representative in Syria, William Yale.</p>
<p>Despite the steadily worsening conditions in Jerusalem, the American
oilman had proven himself supremely adaptable to his surroundings. With
the Turkish currency collapsed in value and speculators subject to
hanging, Yale had embarked on a complicated black-market scheme that
involved the buying and reselling of gold and paper scrip in different
towns across Palestine that, after expenses, netted him a tidy 10
percent profit. On one occasion, when the governor of Jerusalem had
balked at renewing Socony’s concessionary permits, Yale had blackmailed
the man by threatening to denounce him to the Young Turk leadership in
Constantinople, as well as to inform the governor’s wife of his illicit
love affair.</p>
<p>Yale’s special appeal to Djemal Pasha came in the autumn of 1916, and
it arose when a trusted—or perhaps bribed—censor at the telegraph office
in Jerusalem came to Yale and his business partner, Ismail Hakki Bey,
with disturbing news. According to the censor, Djemal had just received
an anonymous letter accusing Ismail Bey of belonging to a revolutionary
group with ties to the Arab Revolt leader, Faisal Hussein. Further, the
letter stated that “a young American was financing the group,” a clear
reference to Yale.</p>
<p>Since such an accusation, if believed, was tantamount to a death
sentence, the two men rushed to Djemal’s office at the German Hospice
and demanded to see the letter. To their profound shock, they recognized
the handwriting as that of Selim Ayoub, one of the other two Jerusalem
businessmen involved in the Kornub oil concessions. “Ismail Bey and I
were so angry at the man’s underhanded, unscrupulous action,” Yale
recalled, “we demanded that he and his whole family be exiled.”</p>
<p>In his memoir, Yale professed to have been on “intimate, friendly
terms” with Ayoub and his family, and he surely knew what such a
banishment would mean to the man’s wife and children: utter destitution
in the best of circumstances, slow death from disease or starvation in
the worst. Yale also seemed to have rather forgotten that he’d
threatened Ismail Bey with a very similar charge the year before. In any
event, Djemal refused to give the aggrieved oilmen full satisfaction;
while agreeing to send Selim Ayoub into exile, he decreed that the rest
of the Ayoub family could remain in Jerusalem. With twenty years’
distance on the event, Yale would note in his memoirs, “I am glad that
Djemal acted less cruelly than the rest of us.”</p>
<p>THE MARCH ON Wejh began at an oasis village northeast of Yenbo, and
in wondrously exotic fashion. To Lawrence, the scene was both splendid
and barbaric, as if the medieval histories he had devoured as a child
had suddenly come to life. “Faisal in front, in white,” he wrote.
“[Chieftain] Sharraf on his right, in red headcloth and henna-dyed tunic
and cloak, myself on his left in white and red. Behind us 3 banners of
purple silk with gold spikes, behind them 3 drummers playing a march,
and behind them a wild bouncing mass of 1,200 camels of the bodyguard,
all packed as closely as they could move, the men in every variety of
colored clothes and the camels nearly as brilliant in their
trappings—and the whole crowd singing at the tops of their voices a war
song in honor of Faisal and his family! It looked like a river of
camels, for we filled up the wadi to the tops of its banks, and poured
along in a quarter-of-a-mile long stream.”</p>
<p>For Lawrence, this entrancing spectacle was to be very short-lived.
Despite all his maneuverings of the past month, earlier that morning a
cable had arrived in Yenbo announcing that Stewart Newcombe was finally
on his way from Egypt; Lawrence was instructed to wait in Yenbo for his
replacement’s arrival, at which point his posting in Arabia would come
to an end. As a result, after accompanying the grand cavalcade north for
a mere hour or so, Lawrence had no choice but to bid Faisal farewell and
return to the coast.</p>
<p>But there was to be no handover of authority in Yenbo. Instead, with
Newcombe encountering another last-minute delay in Cairo, it was decided
the two officers would meet up in the small rebel-held port of Um Lejj,
halfway along the coast to Wejh, where they could intercept Faisal’s
army as it moved north. Accordingly, on January 14, Lawrence hopped on
HMS Suva and made the short run up to Um Lejj and a reunion with Faisal.
With the rebel force pausing there to reprovision, it was a fleeting
reminder to Lawrence of both the adventure he’d had over the previous
six weeks and of all he was about to miss. “I wish I had not to go back
to Egypt,” he wistfully wrote his family from Um Lejj on January 16.
“Anyway, I have had a change.”</p>
<p>Except there was still no word of Newcombe. By the seventeenth, and
with the rebel march scheduled to resume the next morning, Lawrence
quietly entertained the hope that perhaps his superior still might not
make it in time, in which case he would have “no choice” but to
accompany Faisal on to Wejh. By that evening, and with still no sign of
Newcombe, Lawrence’s hopes seemed realized; leaving a note for Newcombe
in Um Lejj—“So I miss you by a day!”—he raced out to the desert to
rejoin Faisal.</p>
<p>In fact, it was by considerably less than a day. No sooner had the
Arab army broken camp that morning, Lawrence happily ensconced alongside
Faisal, than two horsemen appeared coming from Um Lejj at a full gallop.
One of them was Newcombe, finally arrived to take up his position as
head of the British military mission to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>By instruction, Lawrence was to now return to Um Lejj and board the
next ship for Cairo. On the spur of the moment, however, Stewart
Newcombe decided on a different plan. This handover was far too rushed,
and while he’d no doubt stumble his way to a familiarity with Faisal and
his chief lieutenants during the continuing trek to Wejh, that process
might be greatly eased if his stand-in of the past six weeks remained on
hand to make the introductions. When Newcombe suggested this alternative
to Lawrence, he encountered no resistance.</p>
<p>DURING HIS LONG and dreary days of waiting in London, Aaron Aaronsohn
had fixed his gaze on Cairo, the place where he imagined British inertia
might finally be overcome. It wasn’t quite working out that way. “A
hundred times daily I curse the moment when we decided to work with
them,” he raged in his diary on January 5, 1917. “Better for us to
stagnate with the Turks and keep our illusions about the Allies than to
approach them and see this hopeless incompetency. If the Boches
[Germans] are finally beaten by these kakers they will have reason to
doubt God and Justice.”</p>
<p>Aaronsohn had arrived in Port Said in mid-December with the intention
of immediately proceeding to Cairo to present his letters of
introduction to Gilbert Clayton at the Arab Bureau. Instead, the British
authorities meeting his ship had been more impressed by his dubious
legal status—he was still a citizen of the Ottoman Empire—and had
quarantined him in Alexandria. Shortly afterward, a young captain from
the Eastern Mediterranean Special Intelligence Bureau (EMSIB), William
Edmonds, showed up with the news that he was to serve as Aaronsohn’s
liaison.</p>
<p>The agronomist’s initial high opinion of Edmonds—“not only very
intelligent but very shrewd as well”—rapidly diminished when it became
clear the intelligence agent’s function was more to mollify Aaronsohn
with the appearance of progress than to actually liaise him to anyone of
substance. An indication of where Aaronsohn stood in the larger scheme
of things was revealed when he inquired into the possibility of being
reimbursed for some of the expenses he’d incurred in reaching London and
then coming on to Egypt, a cost he estimated at about £1,500. Edmonds
blanched at the figure; with the miserliness with which British
officialdom was already infamous, he pointed out that no expenses could
be reimbursed without proper receipts, and instead proposed placing
Aaronsohn on a stipend of £1 a day, a sum that didn’t even cover his
Alexandria hotel bill. The proud scientist immediately refused.</p>
<p>“Until now,” he vented in his diary that night, “I have encountered
nothing but distrust and reticence, smallness and pettiness. I must try
and control my nerves so that I can establish another connection with
Absa,” he wrote, referring to Absalom Feinberg, the deputy he had left
behind in Athlit. “Then, he can continue the work if he wants to. So far
as I am concerned, I have had enough of it. I am not going to continue
working under such conditions.”</p>
<p>Driving Aaronsohn’s pique was that he’d heard nothing of what might
be happening in Palestine for the past eight months. His whole purpose
in coming to Egypt had been to finally link the British with his spy
network in Athlit, and instead he was wasting his time quibbling about
receipts and meeting with low-level functionaries.</p>
<p>What the scientist didn’t appreciate was that he still wasn’t fully
trusted. Just as with the intelligence analyst back in London who’d
concluded that Aaronsohn’s information was so accurate it might indicate
he was really a Turkish spy, so that analyst’s counterparts in Cairo
were grappling with the conundrum that this suspicion posed: how to link
up with Aaronsohn’s spy network, should it actually exist, while
simultaneously blocking him from making contact with his Turkish
counterintelligence handlers, if that was his true game? Aaronsohn may
have unwittingly added to these doubts by repeatedly asking to talk with
the intelligence officer that Absalom Feinberg had made contact with in
1915, Leonard Woolley. His British handlers were very slow to inform
Aaronsohn that Woolley was now a Turkish captive, his ship having been
torpedoed in the Gulf of Alexandretta over the summer, and Aaronsohn’s
constant invoking of Woolley’s name in the absence of that information
surely raised more eyebrows.</p>
<p>Shortly before Christmas, the British thought they’d come up with a
clever way around their dilemma. Edmonds informed Aaronsohn that, at
long last, a spy ship was being dispatched to make contact with Athlit;
might Aaronsohn care to send along a personal message? The agronomist
saw through the ploy at once and flew into one of his trademark tempers.
Unless he went on the boat personally, he told Edmonds, he’d simply end
all relations then and there; far better that than allowing the British
to send in “some blunderer” who might get all his people killed.</p>
<p>In the face of this ultimatum, a compromise was reached: Aaronsohn
could go along on the boat, but would not be allowed ashore. In his
stead, couriers would be sent in on a launch under the cover of darkness
carrying instructions from him, as well as some of his small personal
items that his confederates might recognize, thus convincing them the
instructions were genuine. Allowing sufficient time for contact to be
made, the launch would then go back in to retrieve the couriers off the
beach. Time would be short, however, since the spy ship obviously needed
to be well over the horizon and gone from sight before sunrise.</p>
<p>As at most every other stage of this star-crossed venture, now
entering its seventeenth month, there was to be a snag. With Aaronsohn
on board, the spy ship, a small converted trawler named the Goeland,
slipped out of Port Said on Christmas Eve, and reached the coast off
Athlit by the following afternoon. Aaronsohn made out someone waving a
black cloth from the second-floor balcony of the research station, an
identification that might have been more definitive had anyone on the
ship’s crew thought to bring along a decent pair of binoculars. Waiting
for the cover of nightfall to make contact, the Goeland then headed out
to the open sea, only to sail directly into a strong squall, a typical
occurrence in the eastern Mediterranean at that time of year.
Consequently, it was nearly 2 a.m. before the seas had calmed enough to
allow it to return to Athlit and release the launch with the two
couriers on board, one carrying Aaronsohn’s instructions to his
conspirators, the other his monogrammed penknife and special magnifying
glass. No sooner had the launch disappeared into the darkness than the
storm kicked back up.</p>
<p>Within the hour, the launch returned with troubling news. With the
surf too rough to make a beach landing, the couriers had been instructed
to swim the last little distance to shore. And with dawn fast
approaching—already they could see a bivouac fire to the north,
presumably that of a Turkish shore patrol—there was now no time to go
back in to collect them; the couriers would have to fend for themselves.
Throttling up its engines, the Goeland headed out to open waters once
more. For Aaronsohn, it was one more maddening experience to join all
the others; he had at last glimpsed Athlit again, but had no way of
knowing for certain if successful contact had been made.</p>
<p>His mood improved when in early January he was finally permitted to
leave Alexandria for Cairo. Taking a room at the Continental Hotel, he
made the rounds of the different officials in the Arab Bureau, and at
last began finding a receptive audience. Chief among these was another
aristocratic Amateur and member of Parliament, a thirty-one-year-old
Oxford graduate recently arrived in Cairo named William Ormsby-Gore. If
not quite up to Mark Sykes’s overachiever status, Ormsby-Gore was also a
great dabbler over an eclectic array of interests, including the notion
of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine—a cause with special
resonance since he had recently converted to Judaism. In the months
ahead, he and Sykes would emerge as two of the most important figures in
the British power structure pushing for the creation of such a Jewish
homeland, and one of their primary vehicles in furthering that cause
would be Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, Ormsby-Gore sought to bolster the
agronomist’s flagging spirits however he could. Under his urging,
another spy ship was sent to make contact with Athlit in mid-January;
alas, this mission, too, ran into bad weather, and was aborted even
before the Palestine coast had been reached. Ormsby-Gore also passed
Aaronsohn along to two other members of the Arab Bureau, Philip Graves
and Major Windham Deedes, who shared the MP’s belief in the enormous
benefits that might be derived by activating the scientist’s
intelligence network. These sympathizers managed to insert a portion of
an Aaronsohn report on the Jewish colonies in Palestine into the Arab
Bulletin, including the pointed comment that the Zionists’ greatest
desire was “for autonomy through the benevolence of a friendly
protecting power,” marking one of the very few times a non-British
correspondent gained a hearing in the intelligence compendium. Still, it
reflected how far the agronomist remained from the inner circle of power
in Cairo that he could imagine Windham Deedes as being “in charge of the
Intelligence Service,” as he noted in his diary, rather than cued to his
true status as a mere midlevel analyst.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, then, Aaronsohn finally began making some headway,
but as he well knew, “slowly” was his enemy. That became manifestly
clear on January 25. As he was returning to his room at the Continental
Hotel that afternoon, he spotted his erstwhile liaison, Captain Edmonds,
lounging near the staircase; he noted that the young officer seemed
“mysterious in attitude.”</p>
<p>“You are the very man I am looking for,” Edmonds said. “You must go
immediately to Port Said. One of your men came across the desert.” It
was shocking news to Aaronsohn, but, true to form, Edmonds refused to
provide any details other than the man’s name: Joseph Lishansky.</p>
<p>“Is he wounded I wonder?” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary before rushing
off to Port Said. “Why do they send me to him instead of sending him
here? These gentlemen are so uselessly and so unfortunately
mysterious!”</p>
<p>As he discovered in Port Said, his apprehensions were exactly
right—Lishansky was wounded—but the story got much worse from there.
Having despaired of ever hearing from Aaronsohn, and with the situation
in Palestine growing ever more bleak, in mid-December Lishansky and
Absalom Feinberg had decided to make another attempt to reach Egypt
overland; in a cruel twist of fate, they had set off from Athlit just
days before the Goeland couriers had come ashore with Aaronsohn’s
instructions. After a harrowing journey across the Sinai no-man’s-land,
the two men had been nearly to the British lines when they were spotted
by a band of Bedouin raiders. In the ensuing gunfight, Lishansky escaped
with relatively minor wounds, but Feinberg had been shot in the back and
was presumably dead.</p>
<p>The news shattered Aaronsohn; Feinberg was not only his deputy at
Athlit, but his closest friend. “So Absa, the brave, was shot by vile,
rapacious Bedouins,” he lamented in his diary; “he fell dying into the
hands of those whom he despised most.”</p>
<p>There was little time for grieving, however, for Aaronsohn instantly
appreciated the new problem Feinberg’s apparent death raised: if the
Turks found and identified his body, they would surely set to tearing
Athlit apart and rounding up his associates. Rushing back to Cairo,
Aaronsohn went in frantic search of his newfound friends in the Arab
Bureau, and found Windham Deedes.</p>
<p>The frustrations of nearly two years came out in a torrent. Amid
tears, he blamed Feinberg’s death on the incompetence and cynicism of
the British war machine, and warned that his death was a mere harbinger
of the many to come if the Turks uncovered his spy ring—as now seemed
highly likely. “I spoke with fire and sorrow,” Aaronsohn noted in his
diary. “[Deedes] listened to me kindly.… He assured me that in future
there would be no more humiliation and distrust and that everything
would go well.”</p>
<p>True to Deedes’s word, a spy ship was immediately readied to make
another run to Athlit. This time, Aaronsohn distinctly saw signals from
the research station’s balcony, and a launch was cast off to take his
messages ashore. In an eerie reprise of the earlier voyage, however,
another storm descended at just that moment, compelling the launch to
stay offshore and a lone courier to swim the last stretch to the beach.
After a tense hour’s wait, the swimmer reappeared on the shore with two
men from Athlit, but by now the storm was raging; unable to swim out to
the launch, this courier, too, was left behind.</p>
<p>More bad news soon followed. Guided by Lishansky’s description of the
attack, a Bedouin tracker was sent out into the Sinai in search of
Absalom Feinberg. He found nothing. “So our brave Knight is dead!”
Aaronsohn wrote in his diary. “Without even confessing it to myself, I
had entertained a wild hope that he had survived. But now, we can do
nothing except to complete the work for which he gave his life.”</p>
<p>But this, too, was hardly a consoling thought to Aaron Aaronsohn.
With Absalom Feinberg now dead and his brother Alex in America, the full
burden and peril of operating the spy ring would fall squarely on the
only person left in Palestine whom the scientist implicitly trusted: his
twenty-seven-year-old sister Sarah.</p>
<p>IN SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, Lawrence described the Arab army that
left Um Lejj for the march on Wejh on January 18 in exalted terms.
Coming just a little over a month since the debacle above Yenbo, Faisal
now stood at the head of a force of some ten thousand warriors drawn
from a half-dozen different tribes and many more clans. Lawrence
underscored the importance of that moment by invoking the words of a
young sheikh of the Beidawi tribe, Abd el Karim, as he gazed over the
sea of tent encampments:</p>
<p>“He called me out to look, and swept his arm round, saying
half-sadly, ‘We are no longer Arabs but a People.’ He was half-proud
too, for the advance on Wejh was their biggest effort, the first time in
memory that the manhood of a tribe, with transport, arms and food for
[covering] two hundred miles, had left its district and marched into
another’s territory without the hope of plunder or the stimulus of blood
feud.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, but born of such high purpose, it must have been rather
anticlimactic when Faisal’s forces cleared the dunes south of Wejh a
week later to find the port town already a shattered, smoking ruin. It
was an embarrassing sight for Faisal ibn Hussein, and only slightly less
so for that British member of his entourage who had become his greatest
supporter.</p>
<p>By the timetable worked out with senior British officers at Um Lejj,
Faisal’s men were supposed to have reached Wejh fully two days earlier.
At that point, a coordinated land-and-sea operation was to be launched,
with Faisal’s forces closing from the landward side while the British
naval flotilla waiting offshore would ferry ashore the some 550 Arab
fighters they had transported up from Yenbo.</p>
<p>But as the British armada maneuvered into position leading up to
H-Hour on January 23, Faisal’s army had been nowhere to be seen. That
night, the commander of the British fleet, Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss,
decided that, for “sanitary reasons” alone, he simply had to put the
Arab warriors on his ships ashore. Following a brief bombardment on the
morning of January 24, the shipborne Arab fighters had been ferried into
Wejh under the command of two British officers.</p>
<p>The ensuing battle was a chaotic and fitful affair, one that lasted
most of that day and left some twenty of the Arab fighters dead. No
doubt contributing to its slow pace—the Turkish garrison of two hundred
was outnumbered nearly three to one and demoralized—was the Arab habit
of breaking off their attacks to loot and ransack whatever new buildings
they occupied. One of the British officers in charge of the ground
operation, Captain Norman Bray, was shocked by the rebels’ behavior,
noting in his battle report that the result of their freebooting ways
was a town “ransacked from roof to floor.” This was the scene that
Faisal and Lawrence rode into the following day.</p>
<p>For his part, Lawrence struggled mightily to put the very best gloss
on matters, offering in his own report a number of unconvincing
explanations to account for their delay in reaching Wejh. Lawrence’s
reflexively contrarian response to criticisms of the Arabs by his
British comrades was nothing new. Back on the night of December 11, when
Turkish forces had approached the outskirts of Yenbo, a British pilot
had unsparingly described the panic that gripped Faisal’s forces within
the town. His account stood in marked contrast to Lawrence’s own version
of events. “The garrison was called out about 10 PM by means of criers
sent round the streets,” he reported. “The men all turned out without
visible excitement, and proceeded to their posts round the town wall
without making a noise, or firing a shot.”</p>
<p>The easiest explanation for this divergence of accounts was that the
pilot had actually been in Yenbo at the time, whereas Lawrence had not;
earlier that same day, he had left Yenbo by ship, a detail left obscure
in his report.</p>
<p>This variance in viewpoints also extended to the figure of Faisal ibn
Hussein. In his December report, that same British pilot had reported
that Faisal “is easily frightened and lives in constant dread of a
Turkish advance, though he seems to conceal that fear from his army.”
Another British officer, Major Charles Vickery, caustically commented
after observing Faisal’s force in Wejh that “it is not known how far
other Sherifial leaders interest themselves in the training of their
troops, but certainly Sherif Faisal ignores it.” Most appalling to
British officers had been Faisal’s decision to take up quarters on a
British warship in Yenbo harbor during those dark December days when a
Turkish attack seemed imminent, leaving his men onshore to fend for
themselves.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, stood at great odds to Lawrence’s own
analysis; as he’d said of Faisal even during the grim interlude in Nakhl
Mubarak, “he is magnificent.” It also revealed something quite
remarkable: after just three months in the field, Lawrence was not only
the chief booster of Faisal and the Arabs, but their most determined
apologist.</p>
<p>Among those who noticed this was Faisal himself. Knowing that
Lawrence was now scheduled to return to Cairo—and probably having seen
enough of the hard-nosed Newcombe during the march up from Um Lejj to
realize theirs would be a less congenial relationship—Faisal sent off a
secret cable to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah on the same day that he reached
Wejh. As Wilson relayed to Gilbert Clayton in Cairo, Faisal “is most
anxious that Lawrence should not return to Cairo, as he has given such
very great assistance.”</p>
<p>Confronted by this direct request from Faisal, Clayton found it quite
impossible to find a way to refuse. Within days, the paperwork was
readied to make Lawrence’s posting to the Hejaz permanent. At last,
Lawrence was to be free: free of his desk at the Savoy Hotel, free,
ultimately, to remake the war in Arabia to his own image.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-11-a-mist-of-deceits">Chapter 11 A Mist of Deceits</h4>
<p>A man might clearly destroy himself, but it was repugnant that the
innocence and the ideals of the Arabs should enlist in my sordid service
for me to destroy. We needed to win the war, and their inspiration had
proved the best tool out here. The effort should have been its own
reward—might yet be for the deceived—but we, the masters, had promised
them results in our false contract, and that was bargaining with
life.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM</p>
<p>With the taking of Wejh, the setbacks and embarrassments that had
plagued the Arab rebel cause in recent months were being consigned to
history. Lawrence made every effort to hasten the process of
forgetfulness along.</p>
<p>After that town’s capture in late January 1917, he was briefly
brought back to Cairo in preparation for his return to Arabia on a
permanent basis. In the Egyptian capital, he kept up a wearying pace.
Along with catching up on his long-neglected reports and making
additions to The Handbook of the Hejaz, a primer the Arab Bureau was
compiling to help familiarize British officers being dispatched there,
Lawrence shuttled between the offices of the British military leadership
to provide them with firsthand accounts of what was occurring across the
Red Sea. With all, he presented a very optimistic view of where matters
stood—he even managed to concoct plausible-sounding excuses for Faisal’s
late arrival to Wejh—and insisted there was a newfound fortitude and
enthusiasm for battle among the western Arabian tribes. His assessment
stood in marked contrast to those of other British officers present at
Wejh, but success has a way of choosing winners in such
disagreements.</p>
<p>“The circle of Arab well-wishers was now strangely increased,”
Lawrence archly recalled. “In the army, our shares rose as we showed
profits. [General] Lynden-Bell stood firmly our friend and swore that
method was coming out of the Arab madness. Sir Archibald Murray realized
with a sudden shock that more Turkish troops were fighting the Arabs
than were fighting him, and began to remember how he had always favored
the Arab revolt.”</p>
<p>Perhaps none were so pleased as Lawrence’s superior, General Gilbert
Clayton. To be sure, Faisal’s insistence that Lawrence stay on as his
permanent liaison necessitated a bit of bureaucratic
reconfiguring—Clayton needed to ensure that neither Cyril Wilson in
Jeddah nor Stewart Newcombe, the recently arrived head of the British
military mission, felt infringed upon—but these were trivial matters
when set against the achievement: after all the distrust that had marked
Arab-British relations over the previous two years, suspicions that had
remained despite the ministrations of generals and senior diplomats, the
chief Arab field commander now regarded a lowly British officer as his
most indispensable advisor.</p>
<p>So hectic was Lawrence’s pace in Cairo that he apparently took little
notice of a visitor to the Arab Bureau offices on the morning of
February 1, 1917. It had been just a few days since Aaron Aaronsohn
learned of the death of his chief spying partner, Absalom Feinberg, in
the Sinai desert, and he was now being treated with a kind of contrite
respect within the British military intelligence apparatus; he’d come to
the Savoy Hotel that morning to lend his advice to a British officer
compiling a dossier on the Palestine political situation. While Lawrence
made no record of their brief conversation, Aaronsohn was sufficiently
struck by it to make note in his diary that night. “At the Arab Bureau
there was a young 2nd lieutenant (Laurens),” he wrote, “an
archaeologist—very well informed on Palestine questions—but rather
conceited.”</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason Lawrence forgot about his first encounter with
Aaronsohn—they would meet again, and to far greater consequence—was that
just two days later a chain of events began that would fundamentally
transform his mission in the Middle East. It started on the morning of
February 3, with a visit to the Savoy Hotel by his nemesis, Colonel
Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>CUNNING AND RESOURCEFULNESS are characteristics that generally well
serve a military officer. If judged by those traits alone, Édouard
Brémond should not have been a mere colonel in the French armed forces,
but a field marshal.</p>
<p>As he’d shown repeatedly during his time in Arabia, if Brémond found
one approach to a desired goal blocked, he immediately set out in search
of another. And if that first goal was made unattainable or redundant,
he simply recalibrated his sights to something else. What made this
agility even more impressive was that, as both political and military
point man for French policy in Arabia, Édouard Brémond was juggling two
largely contradictory agendas at once: to ensure that France enjoyed
equal standing with her ally, Great Britain, in all matters related to
the war effort there, but also to try to limit that war effort from
within.</p>
<p>His long and ultimately fruitless campaign to put an Allied force
ashore in Rabegh had been only the most overt of these efforts. During
the same period, he had been urging on Hussein the establishment of a
French-Ottoman bank in Jeddah, an institution that might lend financial
credits to the Hejaz government at very attractive rates. British
officers examining Brémond’s bank proposal had quickly judged it to be
an economic trap—with no means to pay back the loans, the Hussein regime
would soon become beholden to its French creditors—and scuttled the
plan. Then there was the colonel’s perennial lobbying to have French
officers attached as advisors to the various Arab rebel formations;
while he achieved some success with Abdullah and Ali—a half dozen French
specialists had been dispatched to their camps in December—he’d had
little with Faisal, who remained deeply wary of Gallic intentions.</p>
<p>With the advance on Wejh, Brémond had seen a new opportunity. Once
that Red Sea port was captured from the Turks, the entire focus of the
Arabian conflict would shift north some two hundred miles. That would
render the Turkish threat to Jeddah and Mecca essentially moot—and with
it any argument for an Allied force in Rabegh—but it would offer up an
even more enticing target: the Turks’ last principal outpost on the Red
Sea, the small port of Aqaba.</p>
<p>Observed on a map, Aqaba’s extraordinary strategic importance was
plain to anyone. Situated at the end of a hundred-mile long ribbon of
water that forms the southeastern boundary of the Sinai Peninsula, the
port was ideally situated to serve both as a staging ground for attacks
into the population centers of southern Palestine, a mere hundred miles
to the north, and for launching raids on the Hejaz Railway, the lifeline
of the Turkish garrison in Medina, just sixty miles to the east. In
fact, Brémond had broached the idea of an assault on Aqaba with his
British military counterparts shortly after his arrival in Cairo in the
summer of 1916. The notion had found considerable favor among the
British, but with the Arab Revolt still struggling very far to the south
at that time, had been deemed premature.</p>
<p>By late January 1917, it was premature no more. Not only did the
Arabs now control the Red Sea coast as far north as Wejh, but General
Murray’s ponderous advance across the Sinai Peninsula in prelude to his
Palestine offensive was nearly complete. Lying in the gap between these
two forces was Aqaba. Its control by the Allies would secure Murray’s
right flank, ensuring that no Turkish counteroffensive could be launched
from that direction, and it would bring the Arab rebels much closer to
their British army suppliers in Egypt.</p>
<p>Of course, the plan might also finally bring about the fulfillment of
Brémond’s not-so-secret agenda: keeping the Arab Revolt bottled up in
the Hejaz. Far away from the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina,
King Hussein (he had declared himself such in late October) could hardly
object to a sizable British and French presence in Aqaba. And with that
presence, the principal Allies could dictate to their Arab junior
partners just where they might go and what they might do; any Arab
dissent on that point and the pipeline of Allied weapons and gold upon
which they depended could simply be cut off. Better yet, all of this
could be accomplished under the guise of helping the rebel cause by
moving their forward base to a place where they could more easily carry
out their railway attacks.</p>
<p>In mid-January, even before Wejh had been taken, Brémond began
discussing this idea with his superiors in Paris, and found enthusiastic
support. While Paris would pursue the matter at the departmental level
in London, the French liaison in Cairo and Brémond in Jeddah were
commanded to lobby for the Aqaba scheme among the regional British
leadership. Brémond knew just where to turn. In addition to touting the
plan to British officers in the Hejaz, he put it before his most
reliable ally in the Cairo power structure, Reginald Wingate, newly
ensconced as British high commissioner to Egypt. Wingate liked the idea
so much that he immediately took it to General Archibald Murray.</p>
<p>By the usual standards of British politeness and understatement,
Murray’s response was withering. “In reply to your letter referring to
Brémond’s proposal,” he wrote Wingate on January 22, “my opinion, from
the purely military point of view, is that the [previous] objections to
landing a force at Rabegh apply with equal if not greater force to a
landing at Aqaba.” Therein followed Murray’s usual litany of fears about
mission creep, before he turned to demolishing Wingate’s contention that
control of Aqaba would enable the Allies to strike inland at the Hejaz
Railway. “The country in the neighborhood of Aqaba is extremely rough
and rocky,” the general explained, and any push inland would be over a
terrain only certain rare breeds of camels could traverse. “To sum up,
therefore,” Murray wrote, “the French proposal to land troops at Aqaba
offers, from a military point of view, so few advantages and such
serious disadvantages, that I can only suppose that it has been put
forward without due consideration and I do not propose to entertain
it.”</p>
<p>Along with testiness, another feature of Archibald Murray’s
leadership style was a tendency to needlessly compartmentalize
information. As he well knew when writing to Wingate, the chief
impediment to an eastern advance from Aqaba was not simply “rough and
rocky” terrain but that terrain’s near impassability. A few months
earlier he had detailed a junior officer in the Arab Bureau office to
analyze a series of aerial reconnaissance photos taken of the Aqaba
region. In his report, that officer had pointed out that the port was
nestled in the very shadows of a massive range of rugged mountains that
rose steadily for thirty miles inland before descending over an equally
inhospitable landscape to the interior desert where the Hejaz Railway
lay. The only way through that wall of rock was a narrow gorge known as
the Wadi Itm, along which the Turks had built a network of fortified
blockhouses and trenchworks, leaving any military force foolhardy enough
to attempt a crossing exposed to constant ambush and sniper fire. The
issue, then, was not taking Aqaba—that was the easy part—but in ever
being able to move off its beach. A heedless move here was to invite a
miniature replay of the Gallipoli debacle—or a full-scale reprise,
depending on how determined military commanders became to compound their
initial error.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, however, Murray chose not to share this salient
information with Wingate, nor evidently with the growing chorus of other
British officers advocating an Aqaba landing. In the absence of that
information, Murray’s scornful reply to the proposal appeared to be just
another manifestation of his timidity and bad temper. That was certainly
the view Colonel Brémond came away with upon hearing the news through
the diplomatic filter of Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>“You can confidentially inform Brémond,” Wingate cabled his
underlings in Jeddah on January 24, “that we have already given fullest
consideration here to [the] proposal to land troops at Aqaba, but in
view of our present military commitments in Sinai and elsewhere it must
be discarded. We fully recognize the advantages of this scheme, but the
troops and transport necessary to undertake a successful expedition
against the railway [from Aqaba] are not available.”</p>
<p>To Édouard Brémond, a man who’d previously been able to play Wingate
to great effect, all this apparently sounded less like an emphatic “no”
than a coquettish “maybe.” Days later, the French colonel boarded a
naval frigate in Jeddah harbor for the run up the coast to Wejh to put
his proposal directly to the one man whose desires just might override
Murray’s: Faisal ibn Hussein.</p>
<p>The two men met on the afternoon of January 30, with the more fluent
Arabic-speaking Stewart Newcombe acting as interpreter. Brémond informed
Faisal that he was on his way to Egypt to inspect his men at Port Suez,
before continuing on to Cairo. There, he intended to lobby the British
high command to send a brigade to seize Aqaba, a force to be
complemented by two French-Senegalese battalions that were sitting idle
in the French port of Djibouti, at the southern mouth of the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>Although Faisal had also set his sights on Aqaba, he refused to
endorse Brémond’s plan; as Newcombe would report, “Faisal afterwards
told me that he would like British troops to help him, but did not want
any help from the French or to have anything to do with them.” On the
heels of that meeting in Wejh, Brémond immediately proceeded to Port
Suez and then to Cairo, where he sought out a most unlikely listener.
“[Brémond] called to felicitate me on the capture of Wejh,” Lawrence
recounted in Seven Pillars, “saying that it confirmed his belief in my
military talent and encouraged him to expect my help in an extension of
our success.” That “extension,” of course, was the colonel’s scheme for
an Allied landing at Aqaba.</p>
<p>Whatever possessed Brémond to tip his hand to Lawrence? The simplest
explanation—that he saw the Aqaba plan as so beneficial to all concerned
that even the obstreperous Lawrence might embrace it—is also the least
likely. By now, Brémond was fully aware of Lawrence’s abiding distrust
both of him and of French intentions in the Middle East, a distrust so
deep that he was likely to oppose any French proposal on the basis of
its origin alone. Indeed, by Lawrence’s own account, he instantly heard
in Brémond’s Aqaba plan an echo of his hidden motive in the Rabegh
scheme, a way for the Allies to assume de facto control over the Arab
Revolt and keep it out of Syria.</p>
<p>But what Brémond surely didn’t appreciate was that the man sitting
across from him that morning at the Savoy probably knew the Aqaba region
as well as any European alive. Not only had Lawrence negotiated that
landscape during his 1914 Wilderness of Zin expedition, but it was he
who had studied the Aqaba aerial maps at the behest of General Murray,
to deeply pessimistic results. Brémond may have envisioned Aqaba being a
grand cul-de-sac for the Arabs, but in Lawrence’s estimation, it would
be for any British and French troops sent there, too.</p>
<p>When Lawrence tried to explain this to Brémond, however, the
Frenchman remained utterly sanguine. In fact, he let drop that once his
lobbying efforts in Cairo were done, he intended to return to Wejh to
prod Faisal further on the matter.</p>
<p>There may have rested the colonel’s true motive in seeking Lawrence
out that morning. The little Oxford upstart had been the most
eloquent—and, as bad luck would have it, influential—of Brémond’s
British opponents during the Rabegh episode, and the Frenchman surely
didn’t want Lawrence on hand in Cairo to pour water on any pro-Aqaba
fires he might light among the British high command. By further letting
slip that he would soon return to Wejh for another meeting with Faisal,
Brémond may have been hoping that Lawrence would immediately make haste
for Arabia, thereby removing himself from the arena where decisions were
actually made.</p>
<p>If this was Brémond’s goal, it worked perfectly. “Now I had not
warned Faisal that Brémond was a crook,” Lawrence recounted. “Newcombe
was there [in Wejh], with his friendly desire to get moves on.… It
seemed best for me to hurry down and put my side on their guard against
the [Aqaba] notion.”</p>
<p>Within hours of his meeting with Brémond, Lawrence left Cairo for
Port Suez, there to board the first ship for Wejh.</p>
<p>IT WAS A small but telling sign of the changes that war had brought.
In June 1915, when William Yale had taken his first carriage ride to the
Mount of Olives to meet Djemal Pasha, the horses had trotted up the
steep cobblestoned road with ease. Now, in February 1917, that same
journey was torturously slow, the emaciated horses in their harnesses so
weakened from two years of food shortages that it appeared they might
die in the effort. “It seemed we would never reach the German Hospice,”
Yale recalled. The oilman persevered, though, for it was absolutely
vital that he reach the Syrian governor.</p>
<p>By that winter of 1917, Yale could feel the walls closing in on him
in Jerusalem. Part of it had to do with his nationality. Over the past
two and a half years of war, the grudging respect with which the United
States had initially been regarded by nearly all the combatants, its
annoying stance of neutrality offset by its efforts at peacemaking, had
steadily eroded to something approaching disgust. In Britain and France,
it took the form of a despair that the American government might ever
recognize how its own welfare dictated that it side with the
“democracies” against the “dictatorships.” In the Central Power nations,
it took the form of a growing bitterness at an American foreign policy
that, for all Woodrow Wilson’s pious talk of being a neutral arbitrator,
clearly favored the Entente. And for all concerned was a deepening anger
that under the cloak of defending the sacred tenet of “free trade,” the
United States continued to finance and do business with both sides in
the conflict, growing ever richer while Europe bled.</p>
<p>By early 1917, however, with Woodrow Wilson’s reelection campaign
safely behind him, there were growing signs that the status quo might
soon end, with the United States entering the war on the side of the
Entente. Should that happen, those Americans still residing in Central
Power nations could expect to come in for some unpleasant treatment, and
probably none more so than William Yale. With his bare-knuckled approach
to commerce—bribery, threats, and blackmail had been his
stock-in-trade—the oilman had made a lot of enemies during his time in
Palestine, business rivals and aggrieved local government officials who
might quite enjoy seeing the long-protected American “neutral”
reclassified as a “belligerent” and hauled off to an internment
camp.</p>
<p>Yet as the menacing signs had built that winter, a personal sense of
duty had prevented Yale from asking the Standard Oil office in
Constantinople for permission to leave Jerusalem. Instead, he and his
trusty bodyguard, Mustapha Kharpoutli, made contingency plans to try a
dash for British Egypt should the Americans come into the war, even as
both knew the odds of success in such an enterprise were virtually
nil.</p>
<p>Then, on February 1, Germany had announced a resumption of its
unrestricted U-boat campaign against all merchant vessels supplying its
European enemies, a move that would inevitably target American ships and
seemed almost designed to provoke an American war declaration. That
didn’t immediately materialize, but just days later, after Wilson took
the interim step of breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany, Yale
received the cable he’d been desperately awaiting: the Standard office
in Constantinople ordered him to leave Palestine and make his way to the
Ottoman capital. In great relief, the American swiftly packed up his
office papers and personal belongings, eleven suitcases and footlockers
in all, in preparation for the long train ride north.</p>
<p>It was then that Yale discovered he was caught in something of a
riddle. As with everyone else in wartime Syria, he needed a travel
permit, or vesika, in order to leave Jerusalem. Since he was a
foreigner, however, his permit had to be personally authorized by Djemal
Pasha, and Djemal now rarely left Damascus. For agonizing days, Yale
tried to think of some way out of this conundrum, until finally he
received a tip that Djemal was coming to Jerusalem on a brief
fact-finding mission. It was this that spurred his anxious trip up the
Mount of Olives that February morning.</p>
<p>But even as he waited in the main hallway of the German Hospice for
the chance to buttonhole the Syrian governor, William Yale found his
trademark self-confidence deserting him. “America was on the verge of
war with Germany,” he recalled, “and there was nothing I could do to be
of use to Djemal Pasha. To make matters worse, I had [earlier] been
accused of being a member of a revolutionary Arab group. Certainly I
could not expect Djemal Pasha to feel kindly towards me.”</p>
<p>Perhaps another factor weighing on Yale was the singularly
unproductive role he had performed at the behest of his employers while
in Jerusalem. Despite being given concession over a vast swath of Judea
by Djemal Pasha, Standard Oil had failed to produce a single drop of
Palestinian oil for the Turkish military machine.</p>
<p>As Yale waited in the hospice foyer, Djemal at last emerged from a
far doorway and, surrounded by a coterie of high-ranking German and
Turkish military officers, strode briskly down the corridor toward him.
But the oilman froze, didn’t even try to get the governor’s attention as
he swept past. Appalled by his own timidity, Yale simply stared after
the receding entourage until someone called to him, “Mr. Yale, what on
earth are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Turning, Yale saw that his questioner was a man named Zaki Bey, the
former military governor of Jerusalem. A courtly and cultured figure, in
the early days of the war, Zaki Bey had endeavored to shield Jerusalem’s
foreign community from the harsher edicts of both the Constantinople
regime—he had reportedly warned the Greek Orthodox patriarch to hide his
church’s valuables ahead of a government seizure warrant—and the
resident German intelligence corps. For his conciliatory actions, Zaki
Bey had ultimately been forced from office by the Germans, but had
somehow remained a member in good standing of Djemal Pasha’s inner
circle. Just as important, given the circumstances of the moment, Zaki
Bey was a member in good standing of William Yale’s biweekly bridge
club. After hearing of the American’s predicament, the former governor
tore off the last page of a government document, hastily scribbled out a
travel authorization on the back, and sped down the corridor in pursuit
of Djemal. Shortly afterward, he returned, the signed vesika in
hand.</p>
<p>“As the horses jogged wearily down the Mount of Olives,” Yale wrote,
“I hummed with joy. After two long years of exile during which time I
had seen the increasing misery of war entangle those about me, I now
held in my hand a paper which would start me on my way home.”</p>
<p>Of course, what the future held once he reached that home was an open
question. If the Americans did finally enter the war, Standard Oil’s
operation in the Middle East would be shut down for a long time to come.
Thus idled, Yale would probably be let go or shunted back to the lowly
work he’d performed in the American oilfields. In contemplating this
uncertainty, the oilman apparently decided that whatever debt of
gratitude he might owe to Djemal Pasha for allowing his escape from
Palestine, it was a debt best kept to acceptable limits. During the long
train ride back to Constantinople, a grinding, stop-and-start ordeal of
nearly three weeks, Yale took very careful note of all that he observed
out its windows: German and Turkish troop movements, the status of
railway construction projects, the location of military encampments and
ammunition storehouses. Depending on what the future brought, that
information might be of great use to someone—and it might also be very
useful to William Yale.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE’S WORST FEARS had been misplaced, as he discovered when he
reached Wejh on February 6 and rushed into hurried conference with
Faisal. It was certainly true that the Arab leader was keen to move on
Aqaba, but he was just as keen that the French play no role in it; if
anything, his meeting with Colonel Brémond a week earlier had served to
only deepen Faisal’s distrust of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lawrence was perhaps secretly grateful to Brémond
for having raised the Aqaba issue, for it had alerted him to the great
struggle inevitably to come over that town’s fate. In fact, that
struggle was already under way, and the French colonel’s gambit was but
one small part of it.</p>
<p>Wejh was now the forward base camp of the Arab Revolt, and almost
every day new tribal delegations were coming in to meet with Faisal and
sign on to the revolutionary cause. Most of these tribes were from the
desert and mountain expanses to the east and north, the revolutionary
frontier opened by Wejh’s capture, and these new recruits naturally
wanted to take action in their own backyard. That meant rolling up the
Red Sea coast toward Aqaba. Simultaneously, Faisal was coming under
intense pressure from his Arab military advisors—primarily Syrian
officers who had been captured or had deserted the Ottoman cause—to
carry the fight farther north into their homeland. Both the shortest and
easiest path to do so lay through Aqaba.</p>
<p>To these clamorings could be added those of the British officers now
operating in the Hejaz, beginning with the head of the military mission,
Stewart Newcombe. For the British field officers, Aqaba’s seizure would
mean a much shorter communication and supply line to Egypt, as well as
control of the entire northern Arabian coastline. Even Gilbert Clayton
back in Cairo urged in a January memo that the brigade once slated for
Rabegh be put ashore at Aqaba. In the face of this chorus, Lawrence
surely realized that his protestations on the town’s physical obstacles
would ultimately be drowned out. Indeed, if the examples of Kut and
Gallipoli and a score of battlefields on the Western Front were any
guide, the very impracticality of an Aqaba landing would draw British
war planners to it like moths to the flame.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s contrarian view was unlikely to be much better received by
the Arabs. As with all revolutionary movements, the animating force
behind the Arab Revolt was passion, and that was a sentiment fueled by
daring and boldness, quite antithetical to pleadings for caution or
restraint. Besides, if Aqaba were excluded, the Arabs’ only other viable
path into Syria was the inland route along the Hejaz Railway, a perilous
option so long as the Turkish garrison in Medina stood at their backs.
That option also meant relying on a very long and tenuous supply line to
the coast, a line that would become more tenuous the farther north the
Arabs pushed—although this concern possibly lay more in the theoretical
realm than the practical; given the Arabs’ current rate of progress in
the inland theater of operations, it might not be the current generation
of fighters that reached Damascus, but their grandchildren.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, Lawrence could strenuously counsel Faisal
against going to Aqaba, could even expound on the trap he believed
Édouard Brémond was setting for him there, but it was unlikely to serve
as anything more than a temporary brake. But due to his unique position
in the British intelligence apparatus—privy to the innermost strategic
and political planning being done in Cairo, but also operating in the
field where those plans were to be implemented—Lawrence perceived
something else as well.</p>
<p>In 1917, the European powers still held to the imperial mind-set that
one’s claim to primacy in a place was directly linked to the expenditure
of blood and treasure in taking it, that legitimacy was established by
quite literally planting one’s flag in the soil. This ultimately was why
the French, with precious few troops to spare for operations in the
Middle East, had scuttled the British plans to go ashore in the Gulf of
Alexandretta in 1915, why they remained so uneasy about Murray’s
upcoming offensive into Palestine, and why, conversely, they wanted
every available French soldier in the region to partake in any storming
of Aqaba. It was only their physical presence, so they believed, that
ensured their imperial claims would be honored.</p>
<p>This was not a peculiarly Gallic outlook, but one that very much
infected the British as well. In all the talk of taking Aqaba, what most
everyone envisioned, including Faisal, was basically a replay of the
Wejh operation: an amphibious landing of Arab troops aboard British
vessels, an advance against the Turkish garrison heavily supported by
British naval guns, a new influx of British supplies and matériel once
the town had fallen. Except Aqaba, in contrast to Wejh, was a town of
enormous strategic importance to the British, and one that lay far
outside the Islamic “holy land” zone that had caused them to tread so
gingerly in the environs of Mecca. Having expended British blood and
treasure to seize it, the British military planners’ temptation to claim
Aqaba as their own—and simultaneously to relegate the Arabs to a
subservient role—would prove all but irresistible. When that happened,
the Arabs would be caught by the throat. For the first time, the two
principal Entente allies, Britain and France, would have a sizable joint
military force in the Middle East, and if forced to choose between
French and Arab wishes, there could be little question which side
British leaders in Cairo—or if not Cairo, London—would come down on. The
most likely result would be the marooning of the Arabs in Aqaba, either
explicitly or tacitly blocked from continuing north.</p>
<p>In short, then, Édouard Brémond was the least of Faisal’s problems.
As the Rabegh episode had shown, Lawrence could handily outmaneuver
Brémond by playing the anti-French card when Gallic interests clashed
with those of the British, but it would be a very different game in a
situation where British and French interests dovetailed. In essence,
Faisal was well primed to spot French perfidy, but what about British
perfidy?</p>
<p>As for why Lawrence might perceive all of this while others didn’t,
and why he was so ready to doubt the fidelity of his own government, the
answer was simple: the Sykes-Picot Agreement. So long as that pact
stood, British betrayal of the Arab cause in deference to its French
ally was virtually preordained, most all the pledges contained in the
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence to be nullified. Indeed, because of that
pact, the British government might have their own strong motive for
putting the Arabs in a box at Aqaba; by denying them the opportunity to
actively participate in the liberation of Syria and other Arab lands,
the British could then renege on their promises to the Arabs with a much
clearer conscience.</p>
<p>But in trying to explain all this to Faisal—to impress upon him the
need to turn away from the trap in Aqaba and make for Syria by the
inland route; to not trust in the French, but not in the British
either—Lawrence had only one potential instrument at his disposal: once
again, Sykes-Picot.</p>
<p>In the British army of 1917—as indeed, in any wartime army at any
point in history—the divulging of a secret treaty to a third party was
considered a consummate act of treason, one sure to win the offender a
long prison sentence if not an appointment with a firing squad. Yet at
some point during those early days of February in Wejh, Lawrence took
Faisal aside and did precisely that, revealing to him both the existence
and the salient details of Sykes-Picot.</p>
<p>That Lawrence appreciated the enormity of what he had done is clear
from the subsequent efforts he made to cover his tracks. In his own
writings, as well as in queries put to him by various biographers, he
remained resolutely vague about when he first learned of Sykes-Picot and
how much he knew of its specifics, implying that he hadn’t been in a
position to actually tell Faisal very much. In fact, Sykes-Picot is not
at all a complex document—it runs a mere three pages—and Lawrence almost
certainly had a complete familiarity with it no later than June 1916,
when it was circulated through the intelligence offices in Cairo.
Similarly, in Seven Pillars he fashioned a false chronology whereby his
hasty return to Wejh after meeting with Brémond in Cairo was born of the
need to warn Faisal of the Frenchman’s plan—“[Brémond] ended his talk
ominously by saying that, anyhow, he was going down to put the [Aqaba]
scheme to Faisal in Wejh”—an assertion that only worked by failing to
mention that Brémond had already put the scheme to Faisal four days
earlier. Lawrence’s purpose for this omission, presumably, was to
establish the idea, if it ever did come to light that he had divulged
Sykes-Picot to Faisal at this juncture, that he had only done so to
sabotage the conniving French. For British readers and officials alike
in postwar Britain, this anti-French twist would make for a far more
pleasing explanation than the alternative, his action less a treasonous
offense than a perfectly understandable, even admirable, one.</p>
<p>It was all a construct that Lawrence’s biographers—at least those in
the lionizing camp—have been more than willing to accept. Yet in doing
so they have glided past one of the most important and fascinating
riddles of T. E. Lawrence’s life. How was it that a man less than four
months in Arabia had come to so identify with the Arab cause that he was
willing to betray the secrets of his own nation to assist it, to in
effect transfer his allegiance from his homeland to a people he still
barely knew?</p>
<p>Surely part of it was rooted in a peculiarly British sense of honor.
To probably a greater degree than in any of the other warring nations in
Europe, the British ruling class in 1917 still fiercely held to the
notion that their word was their bond. Among the handful of British
diplomats and military men aware of their government’s secret policy in
the Middle East—that the Arabs were being encouraged to fight and die on
the strength of promises that had already been traded away—were many who
regarded that policy as utterly shameful, an affront to British dignity.
Lawrence may have felt this more viscerally by virtue of being where the
fighting and dying was taking place, but he was hardly alone in his
disgust.</p>
<p>Another part of it may have stemmed from the rekindling of boyhood
fantasies. As Lawrence would write, “I had dreamed, at the City School
in Oxford, of hustling into form, while I lived, the new Asia which time
was inexorably bringing upon us.” Here in Arabia was suddenly the chance
to be the knight-errant of his childhood readings, the liberator of an
enslaved and broken people, and with this came a sense of purpose far
stronger than any appeal to petty nationalism or to an empire that every
day was further proving its unworthiness and obsolescence.</p>
<p>Whatever the combination of motives—and Lawrence may not have fully
grasped them himself—the effect of his revelation to Faisal was both
immediate and dramatic. The Arab leader now understood that despite
their promises, the British were not going to simply cede Syria; if the
Arabs wanted it, they would have to fight for it. Within days of
Lawrence’s return to Wejh, other British officers were noting with
puzzlement how Faisal had suddenly cooled on the idea of an Aqaba
operation; instead, his sole focus was on carrying his rebellion to
points farther north, into the Syrian heartland itself.</p>
<p>It was the same news Édouard Brémond heard on his next visit to Wejh
on February 18. With Lawrence sitting in, Faisal informed the French
colonel that he was now firmly opposed to an Aqaba landing, and instead
intended to redouble his efforts inland. He once again turned down
Brémond’s offer of French advisors, explaining that he had no need for
them, and even offered an arch apology for the ever-broadening scale of
his military plans; he would happily concentrate his efforts on Medina,
he told Brémond, if only he had the same French artillery “to reply to
the guns which the French had supplied to the Turks.” Outflanked once
again, Lawrence gleefully noted, Brémond had little choice but “to
retire from the battle in good order.”</p>
<p>In subsequent weeks, the various British officers stationed in Wejh
continually tried to rein in Faisal’s suddenly lofty plans, to get him
to focus on the immediate matters at hand. To little avail. As one of
those officers, Major Pierce Joyce, would write on April 1, “I am still
of the opinion that Sherif Faisal’s whole attention is directed towards
the North.… I have endeavored to confine Faisal to local ambitions and
military operations, but from somewhere he has developed very wide
ideas.”</p>
<p>As for where Faisal might have developed those ideas, senior British
officers remained baffled. Certainly, they didn’t suspect Captain
Lawrence. In an early March report to Cairo, Cyril Wilson’s deputy in
Jeddah singled Lawrence out for praise, calling him of “inestimable
value.”</p>
<p>FOR DJEMAL PASHA, the options were narrowing. Since the beginning of
the year, the signs that the British would soon launch their
long-awaited offensive in southern Palestine had grown increasingly
obvious. By February, Turkish units had steadily ceded ground all the
way to the outskirts of the town of Gaza, and still the British were
closing; German aerial spotters reported a veritable sea of tent
encampments and supply depots strung along the new, British-laid railway
clear back to El Arish, forty miles away. While estimates of the British
attack force varied, the one certainty was that it vastly outnumbered
the some twenty thousand Turkish defenders standing to meet it.</p>
<p>It was a disparity that Djemal despaired of closing, for everywhere
across the empire, the Ottoman army was stretched to the breaking point:
actively engaged on two fronts in Europe, squared off against the
Russians in eastern Anatolia, and now falling back before a second
British Indian invasion force in Iraq. Even if any troops could be
spared from these other fronts—and the reality was, they couldn’t—it
seemed all but impossible that they might reach Palestine in time to
meet the British attack. With no other choice, then, Djemal had
reluctantly turned his gaze to the ten thousand troops still holding
Medina.</p>
<p>Any thought of abandoning that Arabian city was an extraordinarily
painful one, which is probably why the governor had put it off until the
eleventh hour. Not only did Medina anchor the southern terminus of the
Hejaz Railway, but Turkish control was absolute, never seriously
threatened by the disorganized and outgunned Arab rebels who
sporadically sniped about its edges; as such, it stood as a bulwark
against the schemes of Emir Hussein to spread his revolt north. To give
up Medina, Islam’s second holiest city, would also be to hand the rebels
and their British paymasters a tremendous psychological victory, the
mantle of religious primacy in the eyes of the greater Muslim world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Turkish troops in Medina were some of the
finest to be found in the Ottoman Empire, and led by one of its ablest
generals, Fakhri Pasha; their presence on the Palestine front could make
the difference between victory and defeat. And so, under the urging of
Enver Pasha and the German military high command in Constantinople, in
late February Djemal sent down word that Medina was to be given up, its
garrison to begin the long trek back up the Hejaz Railway to Syria and
hurried into the trenchlines in Gaza.</p>
<p>That order drew an immediate and ferocious response from a man named
Ali Haidar. In the wake of Hussein’s revolt the previous summer,
Constantinople had handpicked Haidar as the new “legitimate” mufti of
Mecca and bundled him south to assume his position of supreme religious
authority. Haidar had ventured no farther than Medina, of course, but
there he had established a kind of “puppet papacy” in rivalry to
Hussein’s regime in Mecca. If rejected by most Hejazi Arabs, Haidar’s
claim to being the true guardian of Islam’s holiest shrines had given
sufficient pause to the international Muslim community to blunt
Hussein’s appeal. All that would be lost if Medina was abandoned. “The
news horrified me,” Haidar wrote in his memoir. “Hastily I sent a
strongly-worded telegram to Djemal in which I said the very idea of
deserting the Holy Tomb was utterly shameful, and that it should be
protected to the last man, if necessary.”</p>
<p>The mufti clearly knew his audience, for just days after issuing his
Medina withdrawal order, Djemal abruptly rescinded it; the city would
stay in Turkish hands, and the outnumbered troops bracing for the
British attack in Palestine would have to manage as best they could on
their own.</p>
<p>But in one of those odd little wrinkles of history, the brief and
quickly resolved Turkish debate over the future of Medina was about to
have far-reaching consequences. That’s because British military
cryptographers intercepted and decoded Djemal Pasha’s cable ordering the
garrison’s withdrawal, but failed to intercept his subsequent
cancellation order. As a result, the Arab rebels and their British
advisors would devote their energies of the next several months
responding to an event that wasn’t going to happen. It was also in these
circumstances that T. E. Lawrence would eventually have his greatest
epiphany about the Arab Revolt and how it should be fought.</p>
<p>AS INSTRUCTED, LAWRENCE was waiting at the dock when the Nur el Bahr,
an Egyptian patrol boat, put into Wejh on the morning of March 8. There
he took delivery from a British army courier of two rather extraordinary
documents.</p>
<p>The first was a transcript of Djemal Pasha’s cable ordering the
abandonment of Medina. As soon as could be organized, Djemal had
instructed, the Turkish garrison was to begin moving up the Hejaz
Railway, taking all artillery and other war matériel with them, and to
form a new defensive line in the Syrian city of Maan, five hundred miles
to the north. From there, whatever troops could be spared were to be
rushed to the redoubt of Gaza in southern Palestine.</p>
<p>The second was a directive from Gilbert Clayton in Cairo. With
General Murray’s Palestine offensive now just weeks away, it was vital
that no reinforcements reach the Turkish defenders in Gaza, which meant
every effort should be made to halt the Medina garrison’s departure.
With the technical support of their British advisors, the Arab rebels
were to dramatically expand their attacks on the Hejaz Railway,
rendering as much damage to it as possible, and to make a blocking stand
against the withdrawing Turkish units if necessary. With his usual
propensity for discretion, Clayton suggested that neither Faisal nor the
other Arab commanders need be informed of the reason for this
escalation.</p>
<p>That directive placed Lawrence in another difficult spot. On the one
hand, focusing on the railway played very much into his personal effort
to get Faisal to concentrate on inland operations and to turn away from
the attractive trap of Aqaba. On the other, taking Medina had been a
primary objective of the Arab Revolt from the outset, and an Ottoman
withdrawal from that city would be nearly as great a psychological
victory to the rebels as an Ottoman surrender. Now the Arabs were being
asked not only to forgo the prize they had fought so long for but to
commit men to battle to prevent its delivery.</p>
<p>This, of course, was the motive behind Clayton’s call for secrecy,
but it raised at least two morally troublesome issues. If the Arabs were
persuaded to occupy a stretch of the railway between Medina and Maan as
a blocking force without being told why, then they also wouldn’t know
that they stood squarely in the path of the redeploying Medina
garrison—and there could be few illusions about the outcome of the
lightly armed Arab tribesmen crashing up against one of Turkey’s
best-equipped armies in the open desert. There was also the point that
the Arabs were now being asked to fight—and, inevitably, to take
casualties—in the Hejaz so as to lighten the burden and death toll of
British troops in Gaza. Certainly, that came with the territory of
membership in a military alliance, but just as certainly, in Lawrence’s
estimation, the British owed it to their Arab allies to tell them
why.</p>
<p>Since he had technically committed treason just weeks earlier with
his divulging of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, this edict was much easier
for Lawrence to disobey. “In spite of General Clayton’s orders,” he
wrote Cyril Wilson that evening, “I told [Faisal] something of the
situation. It would have been impossible for me to have done anything
myself on the necessary scale.” As he would later recount in Seven
Pillars, Faisal “rose, as ever, to a proposition of honour, and agreed
instantly to do his best.”</p>
<p>The immediate task was to get word of the new directive to
Abdullah—with his followers massed near the Hejaz Railway at Wadi Ais,
it would be they who would carry or lose the day—but given the past
lassitude of Hussein’s second son, Lawrence was convinced that both
delivering that critical message and seeing it carried out had to be
done by a British officer. With Stewart Newcombe and the handful of
other British officers who knew the Hejaz interior already out on
scouting or demolition missions, that left him. In the same hurried note
he scribbled out for Cyril Wilson that evening, Lawrence explained that
his plans were quite ad hoc given how little time he had to prepare:</p>
<p>“I think the weak point of the Turk [evacuation] plans lies in the
trains of water and food. If we can cut the line on such a scale that
they cannot repair it, or smash their locomotives, the force will come
to a standstill.… If only we can hold them up for ten days. I’m afraid
it will be touch and go. I am taking some Garland mines with me, if I
can find instantaneous fuse, and if there is time, I will set them as
near Medina as possible: it is partly for this reason that I am going up
myself.”</p>
<p>Under the cover of darkness on the night of March 10, Lawrence set
out with an escort of just fourteen fighters for the grinding five-day
trek to Abdullah’s camp.</p>
<p>It was a brutal journey from the outset. Lawrence was already in the
grip of a severe bout of dysentery, and by noon of the following day was
also afflicted with boils that covered his back. It was all he could do
to stay in his camel’s saddle as the small party plodded through one of
the more desolate landscapes to be found in western Arabia. By the next
day, March 12, his condition had worsened still, the dysentery twice
causing him to faint “when the more difficult parts of the climb had
asked too much of my strength.”</p>
<p>Preoccupied by his own torments, Lawrence apparently failed to notice
the growing friction among his small entourage, which was drawn from a
fragile assortment of previously feuding tribes. What had been
good-natured ribbing between them at the journey’s outset had steadily
escalated to the exchange of insults and veiled threats, a simmering
stew of tension. Matters came to a head that same evening.</p>
<p>Taking shelter for the night in a mountain close known as Wadi Kitan,
Lawrence fell into exhausted rest among the rocks. That ended with the
report of a gunshot echoing through the canyon. Roused by one of his
escorts, Lawrence was led over the rocks to view the body of a member of
the traveling party, an Ageyl tribesman named Salem, dead with a bullet
through the temple. With the skin around the entry wound burnt, it was
clear the killing had been done at close range, which meant by another
member of the group. Very quickly, the finger of suspicion fell upon a
Moroccan named Hamed. During an ad hoc trial, Hamed ultimately
confessed, and Salem’s Ageyl brethren demanded blood for blood.</p>
<p>Over the preceding months, Lawrence had watched in fascinated
admiration as Faisal had acted as peacemaker in scores of tribal feuds,
disputes running the gamut of questions over foraging rights to
decades-old—even centuries-old—blood vendettas. It was a role Faisal
would continue to fulfill throughout the war. “An account of profit and
loss would be struck between the parties,” Lawrence later recalled,
“with Faisal modulating and interceding between them, and often paying
the balance, or contributing towards it from his own funds, to hurry on
the pact. During two years Faisal so labored daily, putting together and
arranging in their natural order the innumerable tiny pieces which made
up Arabian society [that] there was no blood feud left active in any of
the districts through which he had passed.”</p>
<p>What made the system work was a collective faith in the mediator’s
impartiality, but it was an arrangement that came with a harsh side:
when necessary, the peacemaker also had to act as the dispenser of
justice.</p>
<p>The horror of what lay before him in Wadi Kitan seemed to slowly dawn
on Lawrence. If the Ageyl insisted on Hamed’s death, then it had to be
so; this was the law of the desert. But while his execution by Salem’s
Ageyl kinsmen might ensure short-term peace on the journey to Abdullah’s
camp, once word of it reached the larger rebel community it was sure to
spark a blood vendetta between the Ageyl, a very important and numerous
tribe, and the many Moroccans who had joined the revolt. The only real
solution, then, was for an impartial third party to carry out Hamed’s
execution, and in Wadi Kitan that night there was only one person who
was “a stranger and kinless.” As Lawrence would recall in Seven Pillars,
“I made [Hamed] enter a narrow gully of the spur, a dank twilight place
overgrown with weeds. Its sandy bed had been pitted by trickles of water
down the cliffs in the late rain.… I stood in the entrance and gave him
a few moments’ delay, which he spent crying on the ground. Then I made
him rise and shot him through the chest.”</p>
<p>But the first bullet failed to kill the man. Instead, Hamed fell to
the ground shrieking and thrashing, the blood spreading over his clothes
in spurts. Lawrence fired again, but was so shaky he only struck Hamed’s
wrist. “He went on calling out, less loudly, now lying with his feet
towards me, and I leant forward and shot him for the last time in the
thick of his neck under the jaw. His body shivered a little.”</p>
<p>It was the first man Lawrence had ever killed. Stumbling his way back
up to his perch among the rocks, he immediately lay down and fell into
exhausted sleep. By dawn, he was so ill that the others had to hoist him
into his saddle to continue the journey.</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN HAD arrived—or at least he was sufficiently
susceptible to kind words and respectful audiences to imagine so.</p>
<p>By the middle of March 1917, the man who had so long wandered the
bureaucratic wilderness of Cairo was finally being recognized by the
British intelligence community as one of their most important assets,
the conduit for a fount of information beginning to come in from
enemy-held Palestine. With tremendous satisfaction, the agronomist could
note the steadily expanding number of British officers who had once
given him short shrift, whether due to his temperament or his outsider
status or his Jewishness—perhaps in some cases a combination of all
three—but now sought his counsel, extending invitations for him to join
their dinner table.</p>
<p>This breakthrough had begun in earnest in mid-February, when he had
gone on board the spy ship Managem for yet another attempt to reach
Athlit. This time, the weather had cooperated, and they had picked up
one of Aaronsohn’s confederates, a man named Liova Schneersohn. Best of
all, the spy ring had been alerted to the British effort to make contact
by the couriers left ashore on previous runs, and Schneersohn brought on
board with him a trove of recent intelligence reports in a waterproof
satchel.</p>
<p>“We left at once,” the agronomist noted in his diary of February 20,
“happy.”</p>
<p>With that run, the link to the Athlit spy ring was finally firmly
established, and in the weeks and months ahead, couriers on board the
British coastal runners would collect a steady supply of reports on
conditions inside Palestine. The British could only be amazed at the
wealth of intelligence they received—as well as rueful at not having
availed themselves of the opportunity first presented a year and a half
earlier. With the Jewish spy ring gradually expanded to some two dozen
operatives throughout Palestine, and many of them holding prominent
positions in the local government, the Athlit ring detailed everything
from the location of Turkish military supply depots, to the precise
number of railway troop cars passing through the crucial junction town
of Afuleh; in this last effort, they were helped by an enterprising
agent who thought to open a refreshment stand alongside the train
station. For their part, the Jewish conspirators finally gave their ring
a code name, NILI, the Hebrew acronym for a passage from the Book of
Samuel, Nezah Israel Lo Ieshaker, or “the Eternal One of Israel does not
lie or relent.” That was all a bit too exotic for the British, who
continued to officially refer to Aaronsohn’s spy ring simply as
“Organization A.”</p>
<p>Given the fast-approaching timetable for Murray’s offensive in
Palestine, just as welcomed was the detailed analysis of the region that
Aaronsohn provided the British. A nineteen-page paper on the Palestinian
economy authored by William Ormsby-Gore in February drew heavily on the
agronomist’s earlier reports; Reginald Wingate was so impressed, he sent
a copy on to the new foreign secretary in London, Arthur Balfour.
Aaronsohn was also enlisted to make additions and corrections to The
Military Handbook for South Syria, a primer British officers would carry
with them as they advanced beyond Gaza. When that primer began
circulating in mid-March, its breadth of information was quickly noted,
as well as its source. As Aaronsohn wrote in his diary on March 20, a
military acquaintance had “congratulated me on my contribution to the
Handbook, saying that everybody was talking about it at headquarters. It
must be so, as [his official liaison, William Edmonds] told me today
they were receiving reports from everywhere saying how delighted
everybody was with my work.”</p>
<p>Naturally, Aaronsohn was also pursuing his own agenda in all this.
Part of that agenda was very overt—certainly, he’d never hidden the fact
that his overriding motive for joining with the British was out of
concern for the future of the Jewish settlers in Palestine—but some of
it was a good deal subtler. In The Military Handbook for South Syria,
for example, Aaronsohn included a detailed description of most all the
Jewish settlements in Palestine, along with their adjacent Arab
villages. In the quick character sketches he provided of the leaders in
these communities was an element of score-settling, his allies
invariably described as “intelligent” and “trustworthy,” his enemies as
just the opposite. Thus Aaronsohn’s chief Arab nemesis in Athlit was
marked down as an “extortionate parasite” and “fanatical Moslem,” while
a Jewish banker in Tiberias with whom he’d crossed swords was skewered
for his “Oriental standard of honesty.” The effect was to both
preemptively steer the British toward his Zionist allies and to lend the
Jewish settlers in Palestine a prominence far beyond the tiny fraction
of the population they actually composed. Perhaps most crucially,
Aaronsohn painted a very rosy picture of the reception General Murray
was likely to receive once he’d broken through at Gaza and advanced into
the Palestine heartland. “The attitude of the Jews all the world over
towards the British regime is easy to be guessed,” he wrote in late
February. “Palestine under the British flag will draw steadily Jewish
idealism, Jewish intelligence, Jewish capital and Jewish masses.”</p>
<p>The agronomist surely knew that very little of this assertion was
necessarily true. Among international Jewry, Zionism remained a deeply
divisive issue, and within Palestine the vast majority of Jews continued
to be either loyal to the Ottoman regime or resolutely apolitical. That
didn’t matter; Aaronsohn’s audience was British military and political
leaders, and extremely rare is the war-planning staff that can resist a
tale which has its own soldiers being greeted as liberating heroes.</p>
<p>So greatly had Aaronsohn’s star risen that on March 26 he was granted
a prize that had eluded him since arriving in Egypt: an audience with
General Gilbert Clayton. This meeting went so well it was followed by a
far lengthier one a week later. In the interim, General Murray had at
last launched his Palestine offensive, and first reports told of a
smashing success—“a great victory over the Turks,” Aaronsohn noted in
his diary on March 29. On April 3, Clayton called the agronomist back to
his office to hear his thoughts on how the British might drive home
their advantage in the next stage of battle.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn was rarely bashful about sharing his opinions, and he
wasn’t that day with Gilbert Clayton. After asserting that at no time in
history had Jerusalem been captured from the south or west, he advocated
that the British army continue a northern sweep along the coastal plain,
and then hook back to fall upon the city from the north. In contrast to
other armchair generals, of course, Aaronsohn could draw upon his
encyclopedic knowledge of the land—its trails and terrain and water
sources—to lend weight to his advocacy. As he noted in his diary that
night, “General Clayton listened to me with much interest. I left him
dreaming over the map after an invitation to come back and see him every
time I had such good suggestions to make.” In the same entry, the
scientist allowed himself a moment of exultation. “I have succeeded in
making the right party understand that it is useless to beat around the
bush. Palestine is a ripe fruit. A good shaking‑up and it will fall in
our hands.”</p>
<p>Left unclear was just who this “our” might consist of: the Allies,
the British, or the Zionists alone.</p>
<p>AT SUNSET ON March 28, Lawrence and his vanguard of rebel fighters
climbed to the top of a rocky crag to peer over its edge. In the flat
valley below, perhaps three miles away, lay Aba el Naam, a principal
station and watering depot for the Hejaz Railway. In the failing light,
Lawrence watched the Turkish army garrison—some four hundred soldiers,
by best estimate—go through their evening drills.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Turks made frequent nighttime patrols around
the perimeters of their railway garrisons to compensate for their sense
of isolation. This was unpleasant news to Lawrence; his vanguard
consisted of a mere thirty men, and they needed to rest after their
three-day journey from Wadi Ais. A solution came to him. At nightfall,
several men were dispatched to sneak close to the station and fire a few
random shots in its direction. As Lawrence recounted, “The enemy,
thinking it a prelude to attack, stood- to in their trenches all night,
while we were comfortably sleeping.”</p>
<p>It was a sleep Lawrence probably required more than his companions,
for he was still recovering from the dysentery and fever that had held
him in its grip for weeks. He also needed to have both his wits and
strength about him for the assault he was planning on Aba el Naam.</p>
<p>After the ghastly events in Wadi Kitan, he had forced himself on,
increasingly ill, until finally they made Abdullah’s camp at Wadi Ais on
the morning of March 15. There, after a brief conference with Abdullah
in which he explained the need to immediately move against the railway,
Lawrence excused himself to take a brief rest. Instead, he lay in his
tent, racked with malaria, for the next ten days.</p>
<p>Adding to Lawrence’s torment during those long days had been his
knowledge of what was happening—or rather, not happening—during his
incapacitation. Given Abdullah’s reputation for indolence, Lawrence had
figured all along that if any determined action were to be taken against
the railroad, he would need to lead it himself—and this calculation
proved prescient. In the infrequent moments when he was able to rally
enough to venture outside his tent, Lawrence observed that Abdullah’s
camp had retained its climate of frivolity and relaxation just as
before, that nothing like a military mobilization was taking place.</p>
<p>What’s more, it became clear that Lawrence wasn’t particularly
welcome in Wadi Ais. Among Abdullah’s inner coterie was a barely
concealed distrust, even an animosity, toward the visiting British
officer that their chief did little to dispel. For his part, Lawrence’s
once rather favorable opinion of Abdullah, tepid though it had been,
steadily hardened into a contemptuous dislike: “His casual attractive
fits of arbitrariness now seemed feeble tyranny disguised as whims,” he
wrote, “his friendliness became caprice, his good humor [a] love of
pleasure.… Even his simplicity appeared false upon experience, and
inherited religious prejudice was allowed rule over the keenness of his
mind because it was less trouble to him than uncharted thought.”</p>
<p>On March 25, at last sufficiently recovered from his illness to
function, Lawrence strode into Abdullah’s tent to announce he would lead
an attack against the railway himself. That announcement was warmly
received, for Abdullah “graciously permitted anything not calling
directly upon his own energies.” By approaching some of the sheikhs in
Wadi Ais whom Lawrence perceived as actual warriors, he quickly won
commitments for a tribally mixed assault party of some eight hundred men
to fall upon the isolated train depot at Aba el Naam. The next morning,
he set off ahead with his small vanguard to assess the site and work up
a battle plan.</p>
<p>All during the day of March 29, Lawrence and his advance team moved
into attack positions in the hills around the station, while closely
watching the Turkish soldiers go about their routine: forming up for
roll call, falling out for meals, performing desultory drills, still
oblivious to the trap being set for them. Best yet, from Lawrence’s
perspective, was the train that chugged into view that morning and came
to a halt at Aba el Naam; destroying a Turkish train would be a great
bonus to the operation, and he fervently hoped it did not push off again
before the main assault party arrived.</p>
<p>That force began to drift in that evening, but to Lawrence’s dismay,
it was not the eight hundred fighters he had been promised, but more on
the order of three hundred. It forced him to quickly recalibrate what
might be accomplished in the morning.</p>
<p>Throughout that night, Lawrence made his preparations. Small groups
of fighters were dispatched to secrete themselves in the heights
surrounding the station; once the assault got under way, the Turks would
find themselves caught in an amphitheater of gunfire. One demolition
team was sent to place a mine on the railway north of Aba el Naam, while
he personally placed the one to the south, the first time he would put
Herbert Garland’s mine-laying tutorials to the personal test. It was
also here where he set his sole machine gun, in a concealed gully a mere
four hundred yards from the track. With Medina forty miles to the south,
Lawrence figured this would be the direction the Turkish garrison would
take in retreat—or conversely, the direction from which any
reinforcements might come—and the machine gun with its three-man crew
would turn the open ground into a slaughter yard. So exhaustive and
time-consuming were his preparations that when finally the attack was
launched shortly before dawn, Lawrence had to be shaken out of a fitful
slumber to observe it.</p>
<p>It started very well. The Arabs’ two mountain guns, or pack
howitzers, had been tucked into hillside crevices with commanding views
of the depot, and they opened up with devastating effect. Within
moments, two of the station’s stone buildings had taken direct hits, the
depot’s water tank had been punctured, and a train wagon parked on a
siding set aflame. Simultaneously, the Turks scrambling for their
trenches were discovering there was little protection to be found; with
bullets coming in from three sides, they were just as likely to be shot
in the back as in the front.</p>
<p>Amid the chaos, the train that had come into Aba el Naam the day
before began to move off, attempting an escape south. As Lawrence
watched in satisfaction, it tripped the mine he’d set, producing a puff
of sand and scattered steel—but then, nothing. For what must have seemed
an eternity, he waited for the machine-gun team hidden in the gully to
open up, but all remained silent. Instead, the Turkish train engineers
were able to dismount in perfect safety, slowly joist the engine’s
damaged front wheels back on the track, then gather steam for a limping
journey on to Medina.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Lawrence called off the assault. Turkish
reinforcements would surely soon be on their way, and those soldiers
below who had survived the initial melee were now protected by the cloak
of thick black smoke that enveloped the station from the burning wagon.
The only alternative to withdrawal, Lawrence reasoned, was a frontal
assault against the Turkish trenches, an option likely to be as
murderously futile at Aba el Naam as it had been on a thousand other
battlefields.</p>
<p>Measured in terms of casualties—the way military men usually gauge
such things—the engagement had been a great success. At the cost of a
single fighter wounded, the Arabs had killed or wounded some seventy
Turkish soldiers, taken another thirty prisoner, and undoubtedly
disrupted traffic on the Hejaz Railway for some days to come. For
Lawrence, though, it was a hollow victory, diminished by the knowledge
of what might have been. If the machine-gun crew in the gulley had acted
as planned, the hobbled train would have been shot to pieces rather than
allowed to escape; as Lawrence soon learned, the crew had simply
abandoned their position once the fighting around the depot started,
either because they wanted to witness it or because they felt exposed
being so far removed from the main rebel force. Similarly, if he’d had
the eight hundred fighters promised back in Wadi Ais rather than the
three hundred who had shown up, the outnumbered garrison in Aba el Naam
could have been annihilated. Denied the unqualified victory he’d hoped
for, Lawrence would only say about the battle that “we did not wholly
fail.”</p>
<p>Surely deepening his disappointment was what the experience said of
the Arab Revolt going forward. In urging Faisal to make for Syria by
concentrating his attacks inland, Lawrence had vaguely talked of
overrunning the isolated Turkish garrisons along the railway as they
went. But what were the real prospects of that happening given the
example of Aba el Naam? If the Arabs couldn’t sufficiently organize to
defeat four hundred backline guardpost soldiers in a skirmish where they
had commanded the heights and enjoyed complete surprise, what would
happen when they were confronted by the several-thousand-man garrisons
that awaited in the larger rail towns in southern Syria—let alone the
ten thousand frontline troops who stood at their backs in Medina?</p>
<p>Yet, in a different way, the engagement at Aba el Naam proved
something of a seminal event for Lawrence, as it lent proof to an
idea—perhaps more accurately, a constellation of ideas—he had begun to
formulate. By his own account, that process had started during those
long days of illness spent lying in his tent at Wadi Ais.</p>
<p>At its core was the question of what the Arab rebels were truly
capable of in the face of the Turkish army. Virtually to a man, the
British advisors sent to the Hejaz since the beginning of the revolt
were derisive of the Arabs’ fighting abilities. Indeed, Lawrence had
shared something of that opinion with his observation that a single
company of entrenched Turkish soldiers could put the entire rebel army
to flight.</p>
<p>The problem with this view, Lawrence was coming to realize, was not
just that it held the Arabs to European standards of warfare—standards
totally unsuited to the Arabian terrain—but that it rather blinded those
advisors to see the tremendous advantage that terrain might offer. In a
word, space. Some j257,000 square miles of open space.</p>
<p>“And how would the Turks defend all that?” Lawrence asked. “No doubt
by a trenchline across the bottom if we came like an army with banners,
but suppose we were (as we might be) an influence, an idea, a thing
intangible, invulnerable, without front or back, drifting about like a
gas? … Most wars were wars of contact, both forces striving into touch
to avoid tactical surprise. Ours should be a war of detachment. We were
to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a vast unknown desert, not
disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”</p>
<p>If alien to many in the hidebound British military structure of the
day, none of this was truly revolutionary, but rather the classic
strategy-by-default of weaker military forces throughout history. After
all, if one is outmanned or outgunned, charging straight at the enemy
only ensures getting to the cemetery or surrender table that much
quicker. What was unique was how Lawrence saw its application to the
Arabian war.</p>
<p>Ever since his arrival, the overriding goal of both the Arab rebels
and their British advisors had been capturing Medina, the event that
would rid Arabia of four centuries of Turkish rule and allow the theater
of operations to move north. The current campaign to prevent the Turks’
withdrawal from Medina had thrown a new complication into the mix, but
the end goal hadn’t changed; for Briton and Arab alike, seeing the
Ottoman flag come down from Islam’s second holiest city was the prize
that would open the road to others. What Lawrence now saw was that
Medina should not be taken, either by force or by surrender: “The Turk
was harmless there. In prison in Egypt he would cost us food and guards.
We wanted him to stay at Medina, and every other distant place, in the
largest numbers.”</p>
<p>The proper strategy going forward, in Lawrence’s new estimation, was
to keep the Turks settled into Medina almost indefinitely. To do that,
it didn’t mean shutting down the Hejaz Railway altogether, as the
British were hoping to do, but rather allowing that supply line to
operate at just enough capacity to keep the Turkish garrison on life
support. Sustained enough to survive, but too weak to withdraw or go on
the offensive, that garrison would then essentially become
prisoners—even better than prisoners because the burden of sustaining
them would continue to fall on the enemy.</p>
<p>This concept didn’t apply only to Medina. Once that garrison was
rendered impotent, Lawrence foresaw, the Arabs could take their
rebellion into Syria and pursue the same strategy there: ceding the
larger garrison towns to the Turks while they roamed the countryside
striking at soft spots of their choosing, constantly disrupting the
enemy supply lines until the Turkish presence was limited to an atoll of
armed islands amid an Arab-liberated sea.</p>
<p>Once this idea of the Arab force “drifting about like a gas” came to
him, it was probably inevitable that Lawrence’s thoughts turned to that
place on the map that had been a gnawing concern for over two months:
Aqaba.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about Aqaba from the Arab perspective was that while
it presented a trap should they go into it as junior partners of the
British and French, the port was still vital for them if they hoped to
push into Syria. If somehow the mountain range that lay between Aqaba
and the Hejaz Railway could be wrested from the Turks, the Arabs would
then enjoy a mere sixty-mile-long supply line for their operations in
southern Syria, rather than the three-hundred-mile line from Wejh. But
how to clear those mountains, and how to do it without being beholden to
the British and French?</p>
<p>In pondering this dilemma earlier, Lawrence had settled on a rather
obvious and conventional solution, pointing out that as the Arab forces
moved north along the rail line, clearing the towns of Turks as they
went, the Turkish garrison in the side spur of Aqaba would eventually be
cut off; an Arab side force could then be sent over the mountains from
the inland side to capture it. Now, however, with the “drifting like
gas” concept to mind, he began formulating a far more audacious scheme.
Taking Aqaba didn’t have to wait until the Turks’ inland garrison towns
were taken, nor did it have to wait until the Arabs advanced north en
masse. Instead, Lawrence believed that a very small and mobile force of
Arab fighters might pass undetected all the way to the vicinity of Maan,
the inland terminus of the road to Aqaba, and there conduct a series of
seemingly random diversionary raids. With the Turks put on high alert by
these attacks—which meant standing to in their defensive positions—and
unsure where they might come next, the Arab force could then cross the
mountains and fall on Aqaba from the landward side before anyone in the
Turkish military leadership had time to react.</p>
<p>It was with these ideas in mind—still embryonic, certainly the
staggering logistical issues involved not yet worked out—that Lawrence
returned to Abdullah’s camp from his railway raiding forays in early
April. There he found a plaintive note from Faisal awaiting him.</p>
<p>“I was very sorry to hear that you were ill,” Faisal wrote in awkward
French. “I hope that you are already better and that you would like to
come back to us in a short time, as soon as possible. Your presence with
me is very indispensable, in view of urgency of questions and the pace
of affairs.” He closed in a somewhat whiny tone. “It was not at all your
promise to stay there so long. So I hope that you will return here as
soon as you receive this letter.”</p>
<p>As quickly as he could manage, Lawrence set out for Wejh.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-12-an-audacious-scheme">Chapter 12 An Audacious
Scheme</h4>
<p>So far as all ranks of the troops engaged were concerned, it was a
brilliant victory, and had the early part of the day been normal,
victory would have been secured.</p>
<p>LIEUTENANT GENERAL CHARLES DOBELL, ON THE BRITISH DEFEAT AT GAZA,
MARCH 28, 1917</p>
<p>With the ramshackle outskirts of Wejh just coming into view in the
predawn light, Lawrence ordered his small camel train to a halt. He
hadn’t bathed since leaving Abdullah’s camp four days earlier, and out
of a sense of propriety he wished to change out of his filthy,
dust-caked robes before presenting himself to Faisal.</p>
<p>It was April 14, 1917. Lawrence had been gone from Wejh for just a
little over a month, but he was returning to a world transformed.
Indeed, the changes that had occurred in that thirty-five-day span, both
on the global and Middle Eastern stages, were of such a magnitude he
probably had difficulty absorbing them all at once.</p>
<p>In mid-March, just days after he had set off for Abdullah’s camp, the
three-hundred-year Romanov dynasty in Russia had come to an abrupt end.
Faced with paralyzing industrial strikes by workers demanding an end to
the war, and a semimutinous army that refused to move against those
workers, Czar Nicholas II had been forced to abdicate. The provisional
government that had replaced the czar vowed to keep Russia in the
Entente, but with the chaos worsening, there was growing doubt in other
European capitals about just how long Petrograd might stand to that
commitment. In fact, though no one yet realized it, the seed of the new
Russian government’s destruction had already been sown through one of
the most successful subversion operations in world history. On April 1,
the German secret police had quietly gathered up a group of leftist
Russian exiles, men just as opposed to the new moderate regime as they
had been to the czar, and arranged their passage home. Among the
returning malcontents was a Marxist named Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, soon
to become better known by his nom de cadre, Lenin.</p>
<p>But as unsettling as developments in Russia were to the British and
French leadership, they proved a boon in another sphere. President
Woodrow Wilson’s loathing of the retrograde czarist regime had played a
key role in his refusal to bring the United States into the war on the
side of the Entente. With the new moderate government in Petrograd,
Russia was suddenly “a fit partner for a League of Honor” in the
American president’s view. In concert with Germany’s renewed U-boat war
in the Atlantic, and the exposure of an outrageous German scheme to lure
Mexico into attacking the United States, it had provided Wilson with the
political cover to finally declare war on Germany at the beginning of
April. Given the staggering logistics involved in building the tiny
American peacetime army into a major fighting force, and then
transporting it across the Atlantic, it would be a long time before the
American “doughboys” might significantly contribute to the Western Front
battlefields—most war planners estimated at least a year—but the news
came as a tremendous relief in France and Great Britain, both sliding
ever closer to financial collapse as the war ground on.</p>
<p>There had also been a momentous event in the Middle East. On March
26, the same day that Lawrence set out to attack the railway garrison at
Aba el Naam, General Archibald Murray had at last thrown his army
against the Turkish trenchworks at Gaza. In a confused and fitful battle
that had continued into the following day, the British had repeatedly
appeared on the verge of a decisive victory, only to find new ways to
fritter away their advantage, finally calling off their assault as
Turkish reinforcements drew near. The result was quite different from
the “great success” that Aaron Aaronsohn had noted in his diary, or the
“brilliant victory” that Murray’s on-the-ground commander reported in
his initial communiqué. Instead, and despite outnumbering the Turkish
garrison by at least three to one, the attacking British had suffered
over four thousand casualties while inflicting less than half that
number on their enemy and leaving them in control of the battlefield.
The outcome amply justified the taunting Turkish leaflet dropped on
British lines in the aftermath: “You beat us at communiqués, but we beat
you at Gaza.” By the time of Lawrence’s return to Wejh on April 14,
General Murray was gearing up his forces in southern Palestine for
another try.</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, though, that day was most memorable for yet
another event: his first encounter with Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Since his first visit to the Hejaz, Lawrence had heard of the
legendary exploits of Auda Abu Tayi, a leader of the fierce Howeitat
tribe of northwestern Arabia. For even longer, Faisal had been waging a
charm offensive to bring the chieftain in on the side of the rebel
cause, sending emissaries with notes and presents and promises,
entertaining a parade of Auda’s tribal lieutenants. Now, with the
capture of Wejh placing the rebels at the outer proximity of Howeitat
territory, Auda had finally come down to the coast to meet Faisal in
person. At some point during Faisal’s and Lawrence’s reunion meeting
that day, Auda was invited to join them.</p>
<p>Whether wholly accurate or not, Lawrence was given to penning very
incisive and closely observed first impressions of people—and few made a
bigger first impression on him than Auda Abu Tayi. “He must be nearly
fifty now (he admits forty),” Lawrence noted in a wartime dispatch, “and
his black beard is tinged with white, but he is still tall and straight,
loosely built, spare and powerful, and as active as a much younger man.
His lined and haggard face is pure Bedouin: broad low forehead, high
sharp hooked nose, brown-green eyes, slanting outward, large mouth.”</p>
<p>Beyond Auda’s arresting physical appearance lay his charisma and
peerless reputation as a desert warrior. “He has married twenty-eight
times, has been wounded thirteen times, and in his battles has seen all
his tribesmen hurt and most of his relations killed. He has only
reported his ‘kill’ since 1900, and they now stand at seventy-five
Arabs; Turks are not counted by Auda when they are dead. Under his
handling, the [Howeitat] have become the finest fighting force in
Western Arabia.… He sees life as a saga and all events in it are
significant and all personages heroic. His mind is packed (and generally
overflows) with stories of old raids and epic poems of fights.”</p>
<p>Although left unsaid, it would seem one reason Lawrence was so taken
with Auda Abu Tayi was the stark contrast he drew to Faisal ibn Hussein.
While Lawrence still had a profound appreciation for Faisal as the
political guide of the Arab Revolt, the man who could gain and keep the
fractious clans and tribes to the banner of the greater cause, it had
become increasingly clear that King Hussein’s third son was not a
natural warrior. To the contrary, and in opposition to the image
Lawrence had first presented to his army superiors, Faisal appeared to
quite abhor violence and to go out of his way to avoid participating in
it personally, “a man who can’t stand the racket,” as Cyril Wilson once
drily observed.</p>
<p>This had been evident most recently amid the intensified campaign
against the Hejaz Railway. To spur the Arab fighters to action, Lawrence
had joined other British officers in urging Faisal to decamp from Wejh
and make for the main rebel staging ground at Wadi Ais. Faisal had
brushed aside these entreaties, alternately pleading a shortage of
camels and the need to remain on the coast to personally meet with the
various tribal delegations coming in to join the revolt, stances that
led some British officers to quietly conclude the man was a bit of a
coward. That assessment was neither fair nor true—certainly it had taken
enormous courage to pull off the tightrope act that Faisal had performed
for so many months between Djemal Pasha and the Arab nationalists in
Damascus—but it was a very different type of courage than the unalloyed
thirst for battle of a man like Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Further diminishing Faisal in Lawrence’s eyes was a propensity for
vacillation. Perhaps it came with being a conciliator and patient
listener, but the emir—Faisal and his brothers had advanced to that
title upon their father declaring himself king in October—had the
disconcerting habit of falling away from seemingly firmly held positions
under the urgings and opinions of whoever next caught his ear; as
Lawrence would later remark, “Faisal always listened to his momentary
adviser, despite his own better judgment.”</p>
<p>As a recent example, back in February Lawrence had divulged to Faisal
precisely why signing on to an Allied-managed attack on Aqaba posed a
potential trap for the Arabs—and had put himself at great risk in doing
so. Thus educated, Faisal had scotched all talk of a precipitous move on
the port. After a brief absence from Wejh in early March, however,
Lawrence had returned to discover Faisal once again fallen under the
sway of his tribal allies, and back to advocating an immediate assault.
It required another round of persuasion on Lawrence’s part to talk
Faisal down.</p>
<p>In fact, it seemed that yet another about-face had spurred Faisal’s
plaintive note to Lawrence in Wadi Ais pleading for his immediate
return. In late March, rumors had reached Wejh that the French were
about to launch an amphibious landing on the Syrian coast—some rumors
held they were already ashore—raising the specter of Syria being stolen
away in a French fait accompli. Faisal’s apprehensions had been further
stoked by a visit from Édouard Brémond on April 1, and a new press by
the colonel to attach French “liaison” officers to the Arab forces in
Wejh. Faisal had again rebuffed Brémond, but his visit had fueled the
Arab leader’s anxiety to make for Syria via Aqaba as soon as possible.
As a result, one of Lawrence’s first tasks upon reaching Wejh on April
14 was to ascertain that the French rumors were untrue, and to calm
Faisal down once more. Along with being tiresome, this suggestibility in
the emir was dangerous; Lawrence might refocus him now, but what would
happen the next time an Aqaba-urging chieftain or the mischievous
Colonel Brémond came calling?</p>
<p>There was an obvious answer, of course: to immediately make for
Aqaba—and with control of that port, for points farther north—by
implementing the daring inland-approach scheme Lawrence had begun to map
out in his mind. Moreover, among the Arab chieftains gathered in Wejh
that day was just the sort of fearless, single-minded fighter who might
bring that scheme to fruition: Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>Except a new complication now presented itself, one directly tied to
Faisal’s changeability. Back at the beginning of March, amid Faisal’s
renewed anxiety to move on Aqaba, a British officer in Wejh had thought
to apprise Gilbert Clayton of the news. Clayton had sent a top-secret
directive in reply, one addressed to Lawrence and only two other British
officers in Arabia. That directive hadn’t reached Wejh by the time
Lawrence had left for Abdullah’s camp, but it was among the
correspondence awaiting his return on April 14.</p>
<p>“The move to Aqaba on the part of Faisal,” Clayton had written, “is
not at present desirable.” While claiming his main concern was that
Faisal not be distracted from operations against the Hejaz Railway,
Clayton hinted at the true reason in the letter’s close. “It is
questionable whether, in the present circumstances, the presence of an
Arab force at Aqaba would be desirable, as it would unsettle tribes
which are better left quiet until the time is more ripe.”</p>
<p>Both from his own relationship with Gilbert Clayton, the consummate
strategist, and from what he had gleaned in the corridors of the
intelligence bureau in Cairo, Lawrence quickly grasped the subtext of
the general’s words. He’d been exactly right in his warnings to Faisal
in February—the British wanted Aqaba for themselves—but to accomplish
that, they didn’t wish to merely put the Arabs in a box; they now didn’t
want the Arabs there at all. (In fact, Clayton would soon make this
point explicit in a note to Reginald Wingate: “The occupation of Aqaba
by Arab troops might well result in the Arabs claiming that place
hereafter, and it is by no means improbable that after the war Aqaba may
be of considerable importance to the future defence scheme of Egypt. It
is thus essential that Aqaba should remain in British hands after the
war.”)</p>
<p>On April 14, Lawrence could try to deny the thrust of Clayton’s March
8 directive any way he wished—that with the passage of five weeks, it
was now out of date; that merely stating what was or was not “desirable”
didn’t rise to the level of an explicit order—but he surely understood
the peculiarly oblique nature of British military-speak well enough to
know that going ahead with his Aqaba plan now would be seen as a clear
contravention of his superior’s wishes. Then again, this was a man who
just two months earlier had revealed to Faisal the details of a
diplomatic pact so secret that only a handful of people in the upper
reaches of the British government knew of its existence.</p>
<p>At some point during that remarkable day of April 14—and most likely
when the three of them were alone in Faisal’s tent—Lawrence put his
Aqaba proposal to Faisal and Auda. In Auda’s quick and hearty agreement
to the proposal was confirmation of what Lawrence had sensed in the
chieftain from the outset. “After a moment I knew,” he wrote, “from the
force and directness of the man, that we would attain our end. He had
come down to us like a knight-errant, chafing at our delay in Wejh,
anxious only to be acquiring merit for Arab freedom in his own lands. If
his performance was one-half his desire, we should be prosperous and
fortunate.”</p>
<p>ON APRIL 18, 1917, just four days after Lawrence’s return to Wejh, a
French destroyer slipped from an Italian port and headed southeast into
the Mediterranean. On board were the two midlevel government
functionaries who, a year previously, had secretly carved the future
Middle East into British and French spheres of control and lent their
names to the process: Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot. Their
destination was Alexandria, Egypt, and their mission was to bring
political order to the region’s rapidly changing military situation.</p>
<p>Or at least so the situation had appeared when the idea of their
journey had first been broached several months earlier. Despite a record
of dismal stalemate on virtually every battlefront since the start of
the war, neither the British or French government had broken itself of
the habit of squabbling over the spoils of victory long before victory
had been achieved. In early 1917, with General Archibald Murray gearing
up for his march into Palestine, their wrangling had inevitably turned
to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Intent on defending their imperial claim to Syria, France had
launched a two-pronged initiative. The first had been to scrounge up its
scant military units in the region for the purpose of attaching them to
Murray’s army. When this overture, couched as an act of Entente
solidarity, was initially turned down by the British on the pretext that
operational planning was too far advanced to allow for their
integration, it had triggered furious French charges of betrayal.
British commanders on the ground were forced to relent, but not at all
happily. “Of course it is impossible to decline to have these French
troops,” Murray’s deputy, General Lynden-Bell, confided to a member of
the Arab Bureau in mid-March, “but you can imagine what a terrible
nuisance they will be to us.”</p>
<p>On the diplomatic front, Paris had also insisted that a French
political officer accompany Murray’s army as it advanced into Palestine,
a further nuisance, of course, but one that London found just as
difficult to refuse. When in January France had announced that this
political officer was to be Georges-Picot, Britain suddenly found the
need to have a political officer of its own to accompany him—and who
better than Picot’s old negotiating partner, Mark Sykes?</p>
<p>But this new mission put the MP for Hull in a somewhat tricky spot.
During his discussions with Picot over where to draw their lines of
Middle Eastern control, Sykes had never felt the need to inform the
Frenchman—or any other Frenchman, for that matter—as to how those lines
might conflict with commitments already made to King Hussein. Nowhere
was this conflict more glaring than in Syria, a land the British had now
essentially “sold twice,” recognizing its independence in the
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, recognizing its domination by France in
the Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>This was not an immediate problem so long as Picot remained in
France, Hussein’s rebel armies remained in the Hejaz, and the Turks
still ruled Syria, but now, with Archibald Murray’s imminent march into
Palestine and both Sykes and Picot slated to be in his train, those
delicate walls of separation were about to crumble. As he anticipated
his trip to Egypt, Mark Sykes could only have foreseen unpleasantness
ahead.</p>
<p>But then a rather ingenious solution had come to him. What if,
instead of to King Hussein, he brought Georges-Picot before a group of
Syrian exiles with no knowledge of the promises made to the Arabs? In
their ignorance, these Syrians might be grateful to accept whatever
crumbs of limited self-rule the British and French were willing to throw
their way, and that gratitude might in turn lead the French to soften
their imperialist demands. On February 22, Sykes had written to Reginald
Wingate, the British high commissioner to Egypt, asking for his help in
organizing just such a delegation of Syrian exiles in Cairo, men with
whom he and Picot could discuss the future status of their homeland.
Should it be necessary to include a delegate from the Hejaz on the
committee, Sykes suggested it be “a venerable and amenable person who
will not want to ride or take much exercise.” In a remarkable act of
brio, Sykes also thought to enclose with this letter a series of quick
sketches he had worked up toward the design of a new rebel flag.
(Curiously, it may have been in flag design where Mark Sykes’s true
talents lay. King Hussein would eventually adopt one of Sykes’s designs
as his own.)</p>
<p>Startled by Sykes’s cynical request, Wingate sent a cable to the
Foreign Office pointing out that since it was to King Hussein that
Britain had made its commitments, surely it should be Hussein who chose
the delegation to meet with Sykes and Picot. Sykes quickly shot down
that idea, suggesting to Wingate that “it does not appear necessary to
give King Hussein the impression that the future of Syria is to be
considered de novo [anew].” In any event, Sykes hinted, the high
commissioner was making more of all this than need be. “What we really
want are a few men of good standing, representatives of the Arab
National Party, to represent the Syrian Moslem point of view, sign
manifestos and approve any local arrangements that may be made.”</p>
<p>As a result of these building pressures, it must have come as
something of a guilty relief to Mark Sykes when, just as final
preparations were being made for his and Picot’s trip to Egypt, news
came of Murray’s March 26 setback at Gaza. Surely Murray’s next push
would succeed—it was hard to imagine Turkey’s absurd streak of good luck
lasting much longer against British might—but in the meantime, the delay
would give Sykes time to navigate the complex minefield awaiting him in
Cairo.</p>
<p>This minefield was not limited to the Syrian question. Over the past
few months, Mark Sykes had been quietly working on another scheme that,
if all worked out, would neatly outmaneuver his traveling partner,
François Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>Under the original terms of Sykes-Picot, Palestine was to be
separated from the rest of Syria and placed under the “international
administration” of the three principal Entente powers, Britain, France,
and Russia. Within months of coauthoring that arrangement, however,
Sykes had seen the opportunity to go a good deal better. By playing to
the various Palestinian constituencies—and most especially to Jewish
Zionists, with their deep distrust of France and utter hatred for
czarist Russia—it might be possible for Britain to scuttle the joint
administration idea as unworkable, and to place Palestine under a solely
British protectorate. Sykes had been harshly rebuked when he’d floated
this idea past the Foreign Office leadership in the spring of
1916—Secretary Grey had instructed him to “obliterate” the thought from
his memory—but now, a year later, the notion had flowered anew in
Sykes’s fertile mind.</p>
<p>One reason was that Secretary Grey was now a thing of the past,
forced out of office with the rest of the Asquith government in December
1916. With its “Western” focus, the Asquith regime had always been wary
of diplomatic schemes that might inflame relations with the
ever-sensitive French, but that was a lesser concern with the new
“Eastern”-tilting administration of David Lloyd George and his foreign
minister, Arthur Balfour. Anxious for a breakthrough in the war
somewhere—anywhere—they had brought a new emphasis to Eastern
operations, and if success there meant stepping on French toes, it was a
small price to pay.</p>
<p>Sykes had benefited from another important change in the new
government. A chief complaint against the Asquith administration had
been its lack of clear and constant direction in the war, and in
response Lloyd George had created a so-called War Cabinet, a cabal of
just five senior statesmen with sweeping powers to oversee most all
aspects of the British military effort. Surely a sign of the new
administration’s appetite for creative solutions had been the promotion
of Mark Sykes to the position of assistant secretary to the War Cabinet,
placed in charge of Middle Eastern affairs.</p>
<p>Just as crucial had been Sykes’s discussions with Aaron Aaronsohn in
October and November. Following those conversations, and reanimated to
the potential of using Zionism as a pro-British vehicle in Palestine,
Sykes had quietly held a series of meetings with British Zionist leaders
through the early winter of 1917. These discussions had culminated in an
extraordinary conference with a group of leading British “Jewish
gentlemen” at a London townhouse on the morning of February 7, 1917;
what made this gathering extraordinary was Sykes’s opening announcement
that he was there without the knowledge of either the Foreign Office or
the War Cabinet, and therefore their discussions had to remain secret.
Among the eight men in attendance were Lord Walter Rothschild, former
home secretary Herbert Samuel, and a man soon to figure very prominently
in Sykes’s Palestine schemes, the incoming president of the English
Zionist Federation, Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>A forty-three-year-old émigré from czarist Russia, the dynamic,
goateed Weizmann was an erstwhile chemistry lecturer at the University
of Manchester who over the previous decade had emerged as one of the
most articulate and persuasive voices of British Zionism. A prominent
figure at international Zionist conferences, he was also intent on
converting rhetoric to action; in 1908, he had helped create the
Palestine Land Development Company, chartered to buy up agricultural
land in Palestine for Jewish settlement. What had most brought Weizmann
to the attention of British officials, however, was his work in
chemistry. Shortly before his meeting with Sykes, he had developed a
revolutionary process to create synthetic acetone, a key component in
explosives, and in making his discovery available to the British
munitions industry he had won the government’s undying gratitude. (This
surely negated any taint that might have attached to his also being the
older brother of Minna Weizmann, the erstwhile lover of Curt Prüfer, who
had been arrested as a German spy in Egypt in 1915.) Serendipitously,
during his tenure at Manchester, Weizmann had also won the sympathies of
his local member of Parliament to the Zionist cause; that MP was Arthur
Balfour, the new British foreign secretary.</p>
<p>At that February 7 gathering, the British Jewish leaders had
emphatically stated precisely what Mark Sykes hoped to hear: that there
was simply no way the international Zionist movement in general, nor the
Zionist settlers in Palestine in particular, would accept a joint
Entente administration in Palestine. To the contrary, all demanded sole
British control of the region, or, as one of the attendees put it, “a
Jewish State in Palestine under the British Crown.” In response, Sykes
announced his readiness to present the Zionist viewpoint to the War
Cabinet. He also suggested that the assembled dignitaries begin lobbying
their religious brethren elsewhere to that goal, even “offering to make
War Office telegraph facilities available to them so they could
communicate secretly with leading Zionists in Paris, Petrograd, Rome and
Washington D.C.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the politician from Hull couldn’t quite part with
his penchants for blithe optimism and the dissembling statement. As far
as Arab sensibilities were concerned, Sykes opined at the February 7
meeting, he could see no objection on their part to increased Jewish
settlement in Palestine—an interesting assertion considering that, even
at this late date, no Arab was aware the Entente powers had any designs
on Palestine at all. (He obviously could not have known Lawrence was
just then telling Faisal about the Sykes-Picot accord.) His suspicions
undoubtedly aroused by Sykes’s queries on the desirability of a joint
administration, Lord Rothschild had then bluntly asked what promises had
been made to the French in the region. To this, Sykes made the
astonishing reply that “the French have no particular position in
Palestine and are not entitled to anything there.” These were just two
more faulty assertions—the first perhaps an exercise in wishful
thinking, the second an outright lie—to join all the others Mark Sykes
had promulgated in recent months, an ever-growing corpus of half-truths
and conflicting schemes that even he would soon begin having difficulty
keeping straight.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he was clever enough to realize that all was very
fluid, that a precipitating event or a changed set of circumstances on
the ground might upend everything once again, rendering some of his
entanglements moot and giving rise to new opportunities to achieve his
goals—as variable as those goals might be. What’s more, as he sailed to
Egypt that April, Sykes was about to be reunited with a man who
understood the need for bold action: Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>The agronomist from Athlit was a very different type of Zionist from
those Sykes had quietly plotted with in London. Those men were
sober-minded and cautious, their approach gentlemanly, whereas Aaronsohn
was brash and impatient, a man hardened by his having actually lived the
Zionist “dream” in Palestine. In comparison with some of those London
confreres, he also had a much grander vision of what should happen in
Palestine: not just an expanded Jewish presence under British
protection, but an eventual outright Jewish state, one that would extend
from the shores of the Mediterranean to east of the Jordan River and
nearly to the gates of Damascus. Aaron Aaronsohn was a radical, but as
Mark Sykes well knew, it was often the radical who catalyzed change.</p>
<p>What he couldn’t have guessed just then was that he and Aaronsohn
were about to be handed a bountiful gift from someone on the opposite
side of the battlefield, Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>TO THE ANNOYANCE of defense-minded military commanders throughout
history, civilians have a tendency to stay put in their homes until an
enemy invading force is just over the horizon. Then, once the arrows or
bullets or missiles begin to fly, these civilians bundle up their
families and as many possessions as time allows and take to the roads in
whatever conveyance is available to them. Predictably, the most common
result of this rushed exodus is severe traffic congestion—and often
complete paralysis—on all paths leading away from the battlefront,
making it extremely difficult for the defending force to bring
reinforcements to the scene. To guard against this, armies have
routinely forced civilians out of a likely battle zone well ahead of
time—and at bayonet point if required. Due to the stasis of the battle
lines, such forced evacuations had rarely been necessary on the Western
Front through the first two and a half years of World War I, but they
had been a common feature in the east, and most especially on the
Ottoman Front.</p>
<p>It was a policy that came quite easily to the Ottomans, and for
reasons that went beyond simple military expediency. Many times over the
centuries, the sultans in Constantinople, mindful of both their
comparative military weakness and the polyglot nature of their empire,
had adopted a kind of scorched-earth policy in the face of external
threat, uprooting entire populations that might tacitly or overtly
collaborate with invaders. Time permitting, also removed from an
invader’s path were livestock, farm equipment, and food stores, most
anything that might provide the enemy sustenance, and that which
couldn’t be taken away was burned, smashed, or poisoned.</p>
<p>For all their reformist ideas in other spheres, the Young Turks had
seen little reason to revisit this tradition when they came to power in
1908; more likely, they’d simply been overwhelmed by the pace of events.
During the Balkan Wars of 1912–13, entire civilian populations were
forcibly ejected by most all the combatant armies, less for reasons of
military convenience than in pursuit of a policy that a century later
would become known as ethnic cleansing. That massive if largely
forgotten human tragedy—hundreds of thousands of Turks, Bulgars,
Macedonians, and Greeks were permanently expelled from their ancestral
homes—set the precedent for the far more brutal and deadly expulsion of
Anatolia’s Armenian population beginning in the spring of 1915. Despite
that ghastly recent example and his own efforts to ameliorate it, when
Djemal Pasha found his own Syrian realm under threat in early 1917, it
was to the policy of expulsion that he turned.</p>
<p>At first there was nothing controversial about it. In late February,
with the British invaders massing below Gaza and clearly about to
strike, he had ordered the evacuation of that town’s population, perhaps
twenty thousand civilians in all. It was a move the Syrian governor had
every reason to congratulate himself on; when the British attack came in
late March, the cleared roads to the north and east of Gaza had allowed
the Turks to rush in reinforcements and carry the day.</p>
<p>In that battle’s aftermath, Djemal and his German commanders studied
the map of the larger southern Palestine region; surely the British were
going to try again, and just as surely they would be more artful than to
attack over the same ground twice. In trying to anticipate where that
next strike might come, Djemal’s concerns centered on the coastal town
of Jaffa, some forty miles to the north.</p>
<p>Throughout March, rumors reaching Djemal’s headquarters had held that
the British might bypass the Turkish trenches in Gaza by making an
amphibious landing to the north. Not only did the smooth beaches and
gentle surf of Jaffa provide a nearly ideal site for such a landing, but
so did the town’s mixed population; among its forty thousand residents
were some ten thousand Jews and perhaps four thousand Christians,
minorities that were becoming increasingly disenchanted under Ottoman
rule. While those initial concerns had been mooted by the failed British
frontal assault at Gaza on March 26, they came rushing back in its
aftermath, so much so that on March 28, Djemal ordered Jaffa’s
evacuation. After initially giving residents less than a week to
organize their departures, Djemal relented to protests by Jewish
leaders—Passover, one of the most sacred of Jewish holidays, was about
to begin—and extended the deadline another eight days.</p>
<p>Despite the Ottoman government’s proclivity for sunny proclamations
at such times—there was usually much talk of extra trains being laid on
to transport the uprooted to safety, of the pleasant temporary quarters
being readied to ensure the refugees’ continuing comfort—these
evacuations were invariably messy, wretched affairs. For the criminally
minded, they provided an opportunity to loot the homes of their departed
neighbors, or to waylay exhausted and overburdened travelers on the
road. Given the corruption endemic to all levels of Ottoman government,
they also tended to be highly selective; those blessed with the right
connections or the funds to bribe the right officials might be allowed
to stay behind or only move to a town’s outskirts, while others were
being herded days or even weeks away. Perhaps inevitably, these abuses
were likely to be most prevalent in a “mixed” town like Jaffa, a chance
for the ethnic and religious animosities that always lurked below the
surface of Ottoman society to be given full play.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was initially nothing about the evacuation of
Jaffa to suggest it would be anything more than one of those little
forgotten footnotes of war, another point of misery for a civilian
population long grown accustomed to it. But in issuing his edict, Djemal
Pasha unwittingly set in motion one of the most consequential
disinformation campaigns of World War I. The first link in that chain of
events occurred on the night of April 17, when a twenty-seven-year-old
woman was helped aboard a British spy ship trolling off the coast of
Palestine.</p>
<p>IT WAS A poignant reunion. Aaron Aaronsohn hadn’t seen his younger
sister Sarah in nearly a year, but there she was in Port Said, pale and
weak but alive, having just come off the Managem from Athlit. Rushing
her to his rooms at the Continental Hotel in central Cairo, Aaronsohn
summoned a doctor, who diagnosed anemia and proffered iron tablets.
Despite her exhausted state, Aaronsohn then began pumping his sister for
news from Palestine.</p>
<p>To say that Sarah Aaronsohn was an independent spirit would have been
a gross understatement. As a young woman growing up in Zichron Yaakov,
she had fairly scandalized its more conservative residents with her
insistence on riding horseback and participating in hunts in the
surrounding foothills with the men. Like her male siblings, she was
extremely well educated, had traveled—in her case, throughout central
Europe—and possessed of a worldly sophistication quite out of keeping
with a woman coming of age in the hardscrabble Jewish colonies in
Palestine. Even if she had bowed to tradition by quickly marrying after
the engagement of her younger sister, Rivka, to Absalom Feinberg—it was
considered close to scandalous for an older sister not to marry
first—she’d been modern enough to walk out on her unhappy marriage in
Constantinople and not look back.</p>
<p>Perhaps most shocking for a woman in the early 1900s, Sarah Aaronsohn
had made no attempt to hide either her intelligence or her natural
leadership skills. While these qualities spurred resentment in some,
others were totally enamored, and over the years the attractive
Aaronsohn sister had gathered about her an ardent coterie of male
suitors. She was not shy about trading on that attraction for her own
higher purposes. Upon the death of Absalom Feinberg in the Sinai desert
in January 1917, Sarah had assumed leadership of the NILI spy ring in
Palestine, and among the operatives scattered across the region, a
network she had helped expand to nearly two dozen, were several men
clearly in love with her.</p>
<p>That element aside, Sarah Aaronsohn seemed uniquely suited to the
perilous role into which she’d been thrust and, judging by the results,
performed it more ably than either of NILI’s original leaders—her
temperamental brother; the impetuous Feinberg—might have done. As a
woman, she was largely immune from the suspicions that attached to
Palestine’s westernized Jews in the eyes of Ottoman officials, and she
had used that immunity to make extended reconnaissance trips through the
countryside, just an innocent “lady’s outing” should she ever be
stopped. Once contact with the British had been established, she turned
Athlit into her command post, sorting the bits of intelligence coming in
from all over Palestine and ensuring it was organized in time for the
next scheduled delivery to the spy ship offshore. One measure of her
steeliness was her ability to keep the death of Absalom Feinberg, the
man with whom she had shared a chaste love, a secret from the rest of
the NILI ring. So as to maintain organizational morale, she held to the
fiction concocted by her brother in Cairo that Feinberg had gone off to
Europe to train as an Entente pilot.</p>
<p>Now, in mid-April 1917, Sarah Aaronsohn had come to Egypt with a
disturbing story to tell. Three weeks earlier, she told her brother,
Djemal Pasha had ordered Jaffa’s evacuation. While this edict applied to
the entire population of the town, it was hardly a surprise that the
burden had fallen especially heavy on its Jewish residents; with
transport scarce, they were forced to leave most of their possessions
behind, while simultaneously suffering abuse and depredations by their
long-resentful Muslim neighbors. According to Sarah, at least two Jewish
men had been lynched on the Jaffa outskirts.</p>
<p>For Aaron Aaronsohn, the news was deeply alarming. Mindful as he was
of the fate of the Armenians, the Jaffa expulsions suggested that
something similar might now befall the Jews. He immediately set out to
alert his associates in British intelligence of the potential
humanitarian crisis looming in southern Palestine.</p>
<p>His timing couldn’t have been worse. On the very day of Sarah
Aaronsohn’s arrival in Cairo, April 19, Archibald Murray had thrown his
army against the Turkish trenches at Gaza a second time. Proving Djemal
Pasha wrong, Murray chose to attack over precisely the same ground as in
the first assault, although opting for an even more artless, human-wave
approach. Just about the only British refinements since the First Battle
of Gaza were the use of tanks and poison gas against the enemy, but even
these couldn’t alter the outcome; in the six thousand casualties the
British suffered at the hands of the vastly outnumbered but victorious
Turks was a debacle so sweeping as to be apparent to all.</p>
<p>Few could have been more dumbfounded than Aaron Aaronsohn. Back on
March 12, prior to Murray’s first attack, British planners had sought
out his counsel based on his intimate knowledge of the topography of
southern Palestine. The agronomist had been aghast that the British
proposed to make their main thrust through an area south of the town
known as Wadi Ghazzal, a stretch of flat ground broken by meandering
streams, which then rose up to a gridwork of nearly impenetrable
cactus-fenced animal pens. “I said I considered the ground very much to
our disadvantage,” Aaronsohn had written at the time, “and would give a
great chance to the Turkish snipers. Wadis there are numerous and
difficult to cross.” Despite this admonition, in both Gaza assaults the
British had made for the streams and cactus fences of Wadi Ghazzal like
homing pigeons.</p>
<p>Of more immediate concern to Aaronsohn, with the latest Gaza disaster
dominating the concerns of British Cairo, it was impossible to get
anyone to pay attention to what might be happening to the Jewish
population of Jaffa. Over the course of that next week, the scientist
desperately approached most any British official he could think of, but
got nowhere. Then his luck suddenly changed. It did so on April 27, when
he was finally able to obtain an audience with Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>Since their arrival in Cairo five days earlier, most of Sykes’s and
Picot’s time had been taken up in conferences with the “delegation” of
Syrian exiles that Sykes had preselected to represent Arab interests in
the region. Much of the urgency of these talks had dissipated with the
grim news out of Gaza, but after several days of negotiations, Sykes
felt confident that he’d managed to bridge the vast gulf between
France’s imperial designs in Syria and Britain’s pledge to Syrian
independence. A great aid in this bridging process was the fact that the
three Syrian delegates were totally unaware a gulf existed.</p>
<p>“Main difficulty,” Sykes explained in a cable to the director of
military intelligence back in London, “was to manoeuvre the delegates,
without showing them a map or letting them know that there was an actual
geographical or detailed agreement [already in place], into asking for
what we are ready to give them.”</p>
<p>With the “Syrian Question” thus nicely resolving itself, at least
temporarily, Sykes was able to carve out time for other things. High on
that list was meeting with Aaron Aaronsohn, who had been beseeching
Sykes’s retinue for an appointment for days. Their reunion took place in
a conference room of the Savoy Hotel on the morning of April 27.</p>
<p>“At last!” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary. “We immediately broached
intimate subjects. He told me that since he was talking with a Jewish
patriot, he would entrust me with very secret matters—some of which were
not even known to the Foreign Office.”</p>
<p>Sykes filled him in on his clandestine meeting with the British
Zionist leaders at the London townhouse on February 7, as well as
expounded on a new formula for Middle East peace he’d recently devised,
a scheme that called for a grand alliance of the Jews, the Arabs, and
the remnants of the Armenians. With such an alliance, Sykes confidently
explained, the Arabs could be made compliant—they had to know that
without Jewish and British support, their independence bid would
fail—but would also gain the clout to defy the French. At the same time,
such a pact would freeze out the grasping Italians, marginalize the
Russians, create a pro-British buffer state in protection of Egypt and
India, all while paying lip service to the anticolonial demands of
Britain’s newest ally, the United States. How the Arabophobic Aaronsohn
responded to this dizzying graph-paper concoction—its complexity only
surpassed by its absurdity—isn’t known. Most likely, he simply listened
in respectful silence; after all, he had pressing matters of his own to
take up with Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>If other British officials had been too distracted to pay attention
to the predicament of Jaffa’s Jewish population, not so the War
Cabinet’s new assistant secretary. Instead, it appears Sykes instantly
grasped the potential propaganda bonanza Aaronsohn’s news provided, a
way to propel those still noncommittal elements of international Jewry
toward the Zionist-British cause. He quickly dispatched Aaronsohn to
work up a memo on the Jaffa situation, and to meet with him again the
next morning.</p>
<p>In writing on the plight of the Armenians five months earlier,
Aaronsohn had paid grudging respect to Djemal Pasha, pointing out that
despite his personality flaws and failures as an administrator, the
Syrian governor had been resolute in trying to stop the Armenian
massacres and in alleviating the suffering of the survivors. The
agronomist had also at times benefited from Djemal’s changeable and
oddly courteous nature, his personal appeals to him winning the release
of Absalom Feinberg after his arrest as a potential spy, as well as the
modification of an array of edicts injurious to Jewish settlers. As he
sat down to write his account for Mark Sykes on the afternoon of April
27, however, Aaronsohn appreciated that here was a golden opportunity to
advance the Zionist cause, and to fully capitalize on that opportunity
meant creative license would have to be taken. The primary victim of
that creativity was to be Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>Reconvening with Mark Sykes at 9:15 the next morning, Aaronsohn
handed over his memorandum on Jaffa. In quick order, Sykes fired off a
top-secret cable to the Foreign Office asking them to get hold of Chaim
Weizmann at the English Zionist Federation and deliver the following
message: “Aaron Aaronsohn asks me to inform you that Televiv [the Jewish
enclave of Jaffa] has been sacked. 10,000 Palestinian Jews are now
without home or food. Whole yeshuv [settlement] is threatened with
destruction. Jemal [Pasha] has publicly stated that Armenian policy will
now be applied to Jews. Pray inform [Jewish] centers without naming
Aaron Aaronsohn or source of information.”</p>
<p>The first to heed the call was the Jewish Chronicle, Britain’s
preeminent Zionist newspaper. On May 4, under subheadlines entitled
“Grave Reports—Terrible Outrages—Threats of Wholesale Massacre,” readers
were informed, “It is with profound sorrow and concern that the Jewish
Chronicle learns, from an absolutely reliable source, the very gravest
news of the Jews in Palestine.… Tel Aviv, the beautiful Garden City
suburb of Jaffa, has been sacked and lies a mere heap of ruins, while
similar wanton destruction has in all probability taken place in other
specifically Jewish parts of Palestine.”</p>
<p>Taking up the fiction about statements made by the Syrian governor,
the Chronicle continued, “But even worse is threatened. For the Turkish
Governor, Djemal Pasha, has proclaimed his intention of the authorities
[sic] to wipe out mercilessly the Jewish population of Palestine, his
public statement being that the Armenian policy of massacre is to be
applied to the Jews. If this dire and dastardly threat is carried into
effect, it will mean not alone that thousands of Jews … will be put to
the sword in cold blood, but that in addition the whole of the work of
Palestinian re-settlement will be utterly destroyed.”</p>
<p>Over the next few days, the grim news out of Palestine reverberated
through Jewish communities in Britain, the United States, and
continental Europe, and drew anguished appeals to their governments that
some kind of action be taken. In the case of the British Foreign Office
leadership, however, just what could be done was not at all clear. “I
regret,” one senior diplomat commented on the same day the Chronicle
story appeared, “that no action by us seems in any way feasible.”</p>
<p>But at least one British official saw in the Jaffa story the chance
to take matters to an entirely new level, not just to sway international
Jewish opinion but to bring pressure to bear on his own government. This
was William Ormsby-Gore, the Conservative member of Parliament who had
been so impressed by Aaron Aaronsohn during his time in Cairo at the
Arab Bureau; in May 1917, Ormsby-Gore was back in London and working
with Mark Sykes on the War Cabinet’s Middle Eastern affairs desk. While
Sykes had left Cairo for a brief trip to Arabia on April 30, thus
falling out of easy communication, he found Ormsby-Gore’s cable awaiting
his return to Egypt on May 9.</p>
<p>“I think we ought to use pogroms in Palestine as propaganda,”
Ormsby-Gore wrote. “Any spicy tales of atrocity would be eagerly
welcomed by the propaganda people here, and Aaron Aaronsohn could send
some lurid stories to the Jewish papers.”</p>
<p>Sykes received no argument from Aaronsohn. The two had another long
meeting on May 11, at which, the scientist reported, they “discussed the
question of American Jews and of the propaganda we could do there [sic]
now in recruiting for the Palestine front. Sir Mark offered to forward
any telegrams or letters which I might care to send.”</p>
<p>Perhaps mindful of his own growing reputation for exaggeration, Sykes
had the foresight to send Aaronsohn’s new and expanded missive out under
the signature of High Commissioner Reginald Wingate. “During Passover,”
Wingate’s cable to London that same day read, “the entire Jewish
population of Jaffa expelled towards north. Homes, property ransacked,
population in flight robbed with connivance of Turkish Authorities. Jews
resisting [were] pillaged, hanged. Thousands wandering helplessly on
roads, starving.” And now there was a frightening new development in the
telling, an extending of the evacuations to the much larger Jewish
population in Jerusalem. “Masses of young Jerusalem Jews deported,
northward, destination unknown. Forcible evacuation of [Jerusalem
Jewish] colony imminent.”</p>
<p>Under Wingate’s signature, circulation of this cable wasn’t limited
to the Foreign Office leadership; instead, it landed on the desks of the
king, the prime minister, and the entire War Cabinet. At the same time,
Aaronsohn gave Sykes a list of some fifty Zionist leaders throughout the
world to be immediately notified. Now the Jaffa story went the 1917
version of viral. “Cruelties to Jews Deported in Jaffa,” screamed a
headline in the New York Times, “Djemal Pasha Blamed,” while the
American government, so recently enlisted to the war effort, joined an
international chorus in denouncing this latest outrage by the
Constantinople regime. Nowhere was that chorus louder than in Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The Turks and their German allies might be forgiven for being slow to
respond to this onslaught of condemnation; after all, the Jaffa
evacuation had occurred in early April, and it was now mid-May. After
initially refusing to dignify the charges with a response, Djemal Pasha
finally flatly denied the accusations, pointing out that the entire
population of Jaffa had been evacuated, not just its Jews, and that the
process—unpleasant though it undoubtedly was for those affected—had been
completed in an orderly and peaceful fashion; in fact, the governor had
granted Jaffa’s Jewish population special considerations during the
operation denied others. As for the claims of Jews being “deported” from
Jerusalem, the Syrian governor countered, there had been no evacuations
there at all. These assertions were seconded by the regimes in
Constantinople and Berlin, and even by a collection of Jewish leaders in
Palestine, including Jerusalem’s chief rabbi.</p>
<p>But it was too little too late. In the minds of much of the
international public, the “pogrom” in Jaffa was already an established
fact, the latest Central Powers atrocity to join the “rape of Belgium”
and the massacres of the Armenians. It also alerted the Zionists and
their British government allies to the tremendous tool they’d been
handed. Coming so closely after the fall of the hated czar and the
admission of the United States into the war, the Jaffa story helped
accelerate a tectonic shift taking place among international Jewry, the
growing conviction that their future lay with the Entente.</p>
<p>Of more immediate impact, it played to the argument of the more
radical Zionists that any accommodation or compromise with Turkey was no
longer possible. In early June, with the Jaffa story still raging, Aaron
Aaronsohn penned cables to some of the most prominent leaders in the
American Jewish community, men who continued to be cautious about
wholeheartedly embracing the Zionist cause and who in some cases still
imagined the future of Jewish settlement in Palestine as best served by
Ottoman rule. To lend further authority to Aaronsohn’s message—among its
recipients was a sitting Supreme Court justice, Louis Brandeis, as well
as a future one, Felix Frankfurter—Mark Sykes arranged for the cables to
be routed through the British embassy in Washington for delivery.
Typical was the cable received by Judge Mayer Sulzberger in
Philadelphia:</p>
<p>“Turkish atrocities on Jewish populations in Palestine reported on
reliable information,” Aaronsohn wrote. “It is high time to abandon our
previous forgiving attitude towards Turks.… Now that Turks have
committed those crimes, Jewish attitude and American public opinion must
undergo complete change. Only efficient way to quick release of Jewish
populations from Turkish clutches is to attack latter thoroughly in the
field and everywhere.… We must present a united front, and concentrate
Jewish influence on wresting Palestine from Turkish hands.”</p>
<p>In that same month of June, a rather different version of the Jaffa
story began to emerge. In response to Entente appeals, Spain, Sweden,
and the Vatican, all neutral entities in the conflict, sent envoys to
investigate what had happened there. Both the Spanish and Vatican envoys
quickly concluded that the reports of Jewish massacres and persecutions
were without foundation, while their Swedish counterpart went even
further. “In many ways,” he wrote, “the Jewish community of Jaffa had
fared far better—and certainly no worse—than the resident Moslem
population in the evacuation.” Shortly afterward, the U.S. consulate in
Jerusalem also reported that the accounts of violence against the Jaffa
Jews were “grossly exaggerated.” Even Aaron Aaronsohn was ultimately
forced to concede that the two Jewish men allegedly “lynched” in Jaffa
had actually been arrested on charges of looting, and evidently not hung
after all.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter, of course. In war, truth is whatever people can be
led to believe, and Djemal Pasha had just handed his enemies a “truth”
that would change Middle Eastern history. The fiction of what happened
in Jaffa in 1917—a fiction repeated as fact by most historians writing
on the period since—would now become the ur-myth for the contention that
the Jewish community in Palestine could never be safe under Muslim rule,
that to survive it needed a state of its own.</p>
<p>ON APRIL 21, a British navy patrol boat put in to Wejh harbor with a
cargo of intense interest to Captain T. E. Lawrence: eleven Turkish
prisoners of war. Until the previous morning, the men had been part of
the Turkish garrison defending Aqaba.</p>
<p>Acting on rumors that a German minelaying operation was under way in
the vicinity of Aqaba, three British patrol boats had closed on the port
just before dawn on April 20 and put ashore a landing party, catching
the tiny garrison off guard. The brief ensuing gun battle left two
Turkish soldiers dead, eleven captured, and the rest—some fifty or sixty
by best estimate—taken to the hills. Since six of the prisoners were
Syrian draftees and expressed a desire to join with the rebel forces of
Faisal ibn Hussein, one of the British patrol boats had brought them
down to Wejh for questioning.</p>
<p>Over the course of that day, Lawrence interrogated each of the
Syrians in turn. From them he learned that while the Aqaba garrison
fluctuated in size, it rarely consisted of more than one hundred
soldiers. Of even greater import considering the scheme he was hatching,
the total number of Turkish soldiers billeted in the blockhouses along
the sixty-mile Wadi Itm trail between Aqaba and Maan was at most just
two hundred more. It meant that Lawrence’s plan just might work; if he
could raise an Arab force at the eastern terminus of that trail and
launch a lightning advance over the mountains, he could sweep the
isolated Turkish garrisons before him and fall on Aqaba practically
unopposed.</p>
<p>But just because Lawrence saw the opportunity before him, it didn’t
necessarily follow that anyone else in the British military would. Still
in effect was Gilbert Clayton’s March 8 directive that the Arabs not
move on Aqaba. Instead, all attention was to remain focused on attacking
the Hejaz Railway to block the Turkish garrison’s withdrawal from Medina
(it would still be some weeks before the British realized the Turks had
no intention of leaving Medina), an imperative that allowed for no side
adventures.</p>
<p>Of course, the best way to avoid having one’s ideas shot down is to
never explicitly voice them. Rather than take his proposal up with
Clayton directly, Lawrence chose to engage the two other British
officers then based in Wejh in a generalized discourse about the
insights into guerrilla warfare he had gained during his convalescence
in Wadi Ais. In particular, he would later claim, he expounded on the
foolishness of trying to take Medina from the Turks, and the
unfeasibility of trying to organize the Arabs into a blocking force on
the Hejaz Railway. Instead, he suggested, they needed to spread the
Turks thin by expanding the war front as much as possible. Among other
things, that meant going north with “a highly mobile, highly equipped
striking force of the smallest size, and use it successively at
distributed points of the Turkish line.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence’s listeners in Wejh, both career military men, it may
have all sounded intriguing, but also like little more than a
distraction to the mission at hand. This was a reaction that Lawrence
was rather counting on. “Everyone was too busy with his own work to give
me specific authority to launch out on mine,” he would recount. “All I
gained was a hearing, and a qualified admission that my
counter-offensive [idea] might be a useful diversion.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how his fellow officers might have lent Lawrence
“specific authority” for his scheme, since it’s clear from their own
field reports that he never indicated that this diversionary force might
make for Aqaba. Lawrence adopted an even more oblique manner in his
approach to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah, informing his superior that Auda Abu
Tayi would soon be taking a raiding party toward Maan, and that Lawrence
was considering accompanying the party to ensure their actions
complemented Britain’s current military objectives. Wilson concurred,
reporting to Clayton on May 1 that “Auda is to travel north, probably
accompanied by Lawrence, with their first aim to disrupt the railway
around Maan.” Omitted was any mention of what their second aim might
be.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, a book rife with self-justifications, Lawrence
would offer a truly breathtaking one to explain his decision to strike
out on his own: “The element I would withdraw from the railway scheme
was only my single self and, in the circumstances, this amount was
negligible, since I felt so strongly against it that my help there would
have been half-hearted. So I decided to go my own way, with or without
orders.”</p>
<p>In other words, as Lawrence no longer saw the point in trying to shut
down the railway, it was really best for all concerned that he go find
something else to do. Small wonder why so many of his military superiors
found the Oxford scholar infuriating.</p>
<p>Underlying this, though, was an even grander psychological
rationalization for the action Lawrence was contemplating. In his mind,
upholding the promises made to the Arabs truly would serve Great
Britain’s long-term interests, not just as a point of honor but as a way
to minimize the influence of other European powers—allies today,
perhaps, but surely competitors again tomorrow—throughout the region. A
vital first step in this campaign was to allow the Arabs to take their
revolution into Syria, and thus steal that land away from France. The
core problem, in Lawrence’s estimation, was that Great Britain had yet
to grasp what was best for her, and he simply didn’t have time to
explain.</p>
<p>BEFORE SETTING OUT for Aqaba, Lawrence was to have one more fateful
meeting in Wejh. It came on the morning of May 7, when a British
destroyer briefly put into the harbor. On board was Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>The two had first met during Sykes’s fact-finding mission to Egypt in
1915, and despite their vast differences in personality—Sykes gregarious
and charming, Lawrence taciturn and painfully shy—had reportedly gotten
along quite well. That didn’t last long. As with most everyone else in
the Cairo military intelligence office, Lawrence’s opinion of the
diplomat had rapidly soured once details of the Sykes-Picot Agreement
became known to them in the spring of 1916. Certainly, Sykes’s
continuing fondness for firing off fatuous memos proposing neat
solutions to the region’s problems—proposals often in direct opposition
to those he had advocated weeks or even days earlier—had done nothing to
rehabilitate his image in Lawrence’s eyes in the year since. In his
view, Sykes fairly epitomized that vexing feature of Edwardian England,
the aristocratic gadfly, a man who could gain a hearing for his reckless
ideas by virtue of his pedigree and the breezy confidence with which he
voiced them.</p>
<p>In their meeting on May 7, however, Lawrence was to discover
something else about the man; for want of a more decorous term, Mark
Sykes was also a liar.</p>
<p>Indeed, that the two were meeting in Wejh at all that day was a
by-product of Sykes having been caught out in his latest round of
trickery. The diplomat was just returning from an audience with King
Hussein, an encounter Sykes had wished to avoid but which had been
forced on him by the resident agent in Jeddah, Colonel Cyril Wilson.</p>
<p>For all his stiff-necked priggishness, the swagger-stick-toting
Wilson had gradually emerged as the voice of conscience for British
policy in the Middle East. In the long debate of late 1916 over whether
a British brigade should be deployed in the Hejaz, Wilson had initially
been among its fiercest advocates, and had been tasked by his superior,
Reginald Wingate, to compel King Hussein to that view. Over the course
of numerous meetings with Hussein, however, it had gradually occurred to
the resident agent that perhaps the old man in Mecca knew his subjects
and the politics of western Arabia better than the Allied advisors newly
arrived to the scene. Ultimately, when Wingate had once again ordered
his underling to lean on Hussein over the matter, Wilson, heretofore
regarded as something of a Wingate yes-man, had essentially refused to
do so and been instrumental in seeing the proposal finally shelved.</p>
<p>Wilson had had a far more visceral reaction upon learning of Sykes’s
scheme to avoid Hussein in favor of his sham negotiations with the
Syrian “delegates” in Cairo. In late March he had sent a long and
anguished letter to Clayton enumerating both the problems inevitably to
come from this act of deception and the benefits to be derived by being
honest with Hussein. “We now have a chance, which is not likely to occur
again, of winning the gratitude of millions of Moslems of the [British]
Empire,” he wrote. “For Heaven’s sake, let us be straight with the old
man; I am convinced it will pay us in the end.”</p>
<p>While that appeal had been in vain, it seemed the good colonel in
Jeddah was quite capable of backroom maneuvers of his own. At his next
meeting with Hussein, he urged the king to formally request a meeting
with Mark Sykes. When Wilson forwarded that request to Reginald Wingate,
another man who, despite his interventionist impulses, held to the
British tradition of fair play, it quickly became an invitation Sykes
couldn’t refuse. On April 30, with his and Picot’s conferences with the
Syrian “delegates” in Cairo concluded, Sykes had boarded the British
destroyer in Port Suez and set off for Jeddah.</p>
<p>Even for a supremely self-confident man, it must have been a
stressful voyage. It was one thing to bamboozle a few preselected
functionaries in Cairo with no knowledge of the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence; it would surely be quite another to fool one of its
actual authors. But then, Sykes had other cards to play. Chief among
them was his ability to control the flow of information. Just as he had
arranged to have a first meeting with the Syrians in Cairo without Picot
present, so now he would be meeting alone with Hussein. As a result,
should any future dispute arise over what had or had not been discussed,
it would be the word of a highly respected British envoy against that of
a mercurial desert chieftain long known for forgetfulness and willful
misinterpretation.</p>
<p>It might have all worked out just fine—at least for the time being,
which was all Mark Sykes could reasonably hope for—if he hadn’t decided
to stop off in Wejh en route to confer with Faisal. By chance, Lawrence
was away on a brief reconnaissance trip when Sykes called on May 2, but
he got a full report from Faisal on what had transpired upon his return
to Wejh two days later. By then, Sykes was already on his way to Jeddah
and his meeting with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Judging by the report he sent to Reginald Wingate on the evening of
May 5, Sykes’s foray into shuttle diplomacy could scarcely have gone
better: “On 2nd May, I saw Sherif Faisal at Wejh and explained to him
the principle of the Anglo-French agreement in regard to an Arab
confederation; after much argument he accepted the principle and seemed
satisfied.” That success had presaged one even more remarkable, for that
very afternoon Sykes had met with King Hussein. “In accordance with my
instructions, I explained the principle of the [Anglo-French] agreement
as regards an Arab confederation or State.… I impressed upon the King
the importance of Franco-Arab friendship and I at least got him to admit
that it was essential to Arab development in Syria, but this after a
very lengthy argument.”</p>
<p>A close reader of that May 5 report might have been disquieted by the
peculiar symmetry of these two meetings—forthrightness by Sykes in
outlining French-British designs in the region, followed by Arab
argument, followed ultimately by Arab acceptance—while the truly cynical
might have concluded that, with his emphasis on the quarreling involved,
Sykes was already laying in his defense should there be future
disagreement with Faisal and Hussein over what had been said or agreed
to. In the interim, though, the trip was a triumph of diplomacy, a
crucial first step toward resolving the nettlesome issues that stood
between Britain and France and their Arab allies.</p>
<p>“Please tell Monsieur Picot,” Sykes ended his May 5 cable to Wingate,
“that I am satisfied with my interview with Faisal and the King, as they
both now stand at the same point as was reached at our last joint
meeting with the 3 Syrian delegates in Cairo.”</p>
<p>What Mark Sykes didn’t know, of course, was that in Faisal ibn
Hussein he had been speaking with a man quite aware of the Sykes-Picot
Agreement—courtesy of T. E. Lawrence—and in no way did Sykes’s vague and
generalized discussion of that pact on May 2 match up with what the Arab
leader already knew. Nevertheless, whether hewing to the Arab
negotiating tradition of not tipping one’s hand until absolutely
necessary, or worried that Lawrence would be exposed as his source,
Faisal had not confronted the diplomat over his obfuscations at the
time.</p>
<p>Not that he was in any better position to do so when Sykes stopped
back by on May 7. Faisal’s knowledge of the true framework of
Sykes-Picot, as opposed to the bastardized version Sykes had chosen to
tell him, was the great and dangerous secret that he and Lawrence
shared, and to reveal it now could only invite disaster: for Faisal,
estrangement and perhaps abandonment by his British benefactors; for
Lawrence, immediate transfer and probable court-martial.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lawrence did have sanctioned knowledge of
Sykes-Picot, which meant he on his own could confront Sykes over the
sanitized version told to Faisal—and, presumably, to Hussein. All
indications are that Lawrence provoked just such a confrontation.
Neither man was to make record of their meeting in Wejh, but it appears
to have been a highly contentious one. From that day on, Lawrence’s
attitude toward Sykes would be hostile. For his part, Sykes would miss
few chances to try to denigrate or marginalize Lawrence in any way he
could.</p>
<p>On a more personal level, it seems that encounter with Sykes in Wejh
came to simultaneously haunt Lawrence and to provide a certain kind of
relief. He stood vindicated in not trusting in the honor of his
government, and in imparting to Faisal its secret plan to betray the
Arab cause. To whatever degree his conscience had been bothered by that
decision, in the slippery schemes of Mark Sykes it was now cleansed.</p>
<p>At the same time, he appreciated that in his countryman was a
particularly formidable rival. By comparison, Édouard Brémond was easy,
his various schemes made predictable by his singular pursuit of French
hegemony. Mark Sykes, by contrast, was a man ruled by whim, who didn’t
feel bound by—perhaps at times didn’t even remember—the myriad promises
that tripped so easily from his lips. He was able to stay ahead of it
all by a talent for deceit, but since he was in a position of power,
pulling the levers from Jeddah to London and all points in between, at
the end of the day there would probably be no final appeal to British
ideals of honor or justice, all would be sacrificed to convenience. The
only recourse for the Arabs, then, was to try to change the facts on the
ground, to strike a blow that might upend the plans of the
dealmakers.</p>
<p>It was with such thoughts that, two days later, Lawrence set out on
the long and dangerous trek toward Aqaba. For what would soon become one
of the most audacious and celebrated military exploits of World War I,
his accompanying “army” consisted of fewer than forty-five Arab
warriors.</p>

<p>KING HUSSEIN TO HIS SON FAISAL, MAY 1917</p>
<p>His Sherifial Majesty [King Hussein] evidently suffers from the
defects of character and ignorance of system common to Oriental
potentates.… The task of guiding an Oriental ruler or government in the
way they should go is no light one—as I know to my cost—and you have my
fullest sympathy. It must be heartbreaking work at times.</p>
<p>REGINALD WINGATE TO CYRIL WILSON, JULY 20, 1917</p>
<p>It was a moment when the awful burden of leadership fell upon
Lawrence as if a great weight, reminiscent of what had occurred in Wadi
Kitan two months earlier. Then, the mantle of authority had required him
to execute a man. Now it required him to try to save one, but quite
possibly to lose his own life in the effort.</p>
<p>It was midmorning on May 24, his party’s fifth day in El Houl. Arabic
for “the Terror,” El Houl is a vast trackless and waterless expanse in
northern Arabia empty of even the smallest signs of life, and Lawrence
had dreaded that leg of their journey to Syria ever since leaving Wejh.
Reality had been worse than the imagining. Within hours of entering El
Houl, the forty-five-man caravan had been buffeted by a ferocious
headwind, “a half-gale,” in Lawrence’s estimation, “so dry that our
shriveled lips cracked open, and the skin of our faces chapped.” The
wind, and the burning, blinding sand it kicked up, continued almost
without pause for the next four days.</p>
<p>To endure in such situations, humans tend to retreat into a kind of
closed-off mental state, their entire focus honed to simply trying to
reach the end. Such was the case with Lawrence and Auda’s party in El
Houl, so much so that on the morning of May 24, no one seemed to take
note of the riderless camel padding alongside the others. Perhaps they
assumed she was one of the baggage camels that traditionally lagged
behind, or that her rider had switched to another camel and was to be
found elsewhere along their extended line. Most likely, in their
semihibernative states they simply couldn’t be roused to care. When
finally Lawrence investigated the mysterious camel, he discovered it was
the mount of Gasim.</p>
<p>“A fanged and yellow-faced outlaw,” Gasim was a native of the Syrian
city of Maan, and Lawrence had brought him along on the trek in hopes
that he might make contact with other Arab nationalists in his hometown.
Of course, this also made Gasim an outsider among the traveling Howeitat
and Ageyl tribesmen and, in the harsh code of the desert, just as
friendless in a crisis as the condemned Hamed had been at Wadi Kitan. As
Lawrence recounted, Gasim’s status now “shifted the difficulty to my
shoulders.”</p>
<p>Perhaps indicative of the stress El Houl had put on his own reasoning
skills, Lawrence made a most foolhardy decision, not only to go back
alone in search of Gasim, but not even to tell the others he was doing
so. Within a very short distance, he discovered, all trace of their path
had vanished, the camels’ tracks in the sand swept away by the scouring
wind, and then the caravan itself receded until it was lost in the murk.
To somehow find Gasim and then return to the caravan, Lawrence could
only rely on the compass readings he’d periodically noted in his diary
and trust he hadn’t erred.</p>
<p>It was fifteen days since they had set out. In Bedouin tradition, a
number of tribal chiefs, including Faisal, had accompanied them the
first few miles out of Wejh by way of farewell, and then the forty-five
or so travelers had headed off into the northeastern darkness, the last
anyone in the Hejaz would hear of them for over two months.</p>
<p>They traveled light. Along with a few rifles and 20,000 gold
sovereigns—to be disbursed among Syrian tribal leaders they hoped to win
to the rebel cause—each man carried in his saddlebags some forty-five
pounds of flour. That and water would be their staples until they
reached their initial staging ground, the Wadi Sirhan depression on the
Syrian frontier, in an estimated three weeks’ time.</p>
<p>Despite being struck by a new round of fever and boils, Lawrence
would recall the first days of that journey in almost idyllic terms, the
beginning of a great adventure. It was also during this time that there
occurred one of the more intriguing side stories to his time in Arabia,
the account of how he came to obtain his two camp orderlies, given the
names Daud and Farraj in Seven Pillars (their actual names were Ali and
Othman).</p>
<p>It occurred during a day of idleness when, as Lawrence rested his
weary boil-covered body in the shadow of a rock escarpment, a young boy
rushed up beseeching his help. Having fled from a nearby Ageyl
encampment, Daud offered that his best friend, Farraj, was about to be
severely beaten by the camp commander for accidentally burning down a
tent; a word from Lawrence, the boy suggested, might stay the
punishment. That theory was discredited when Lawrence took the matter up
with the passing Ageyl camp commander, Saad, a few moments later.
Explaining that the two boys were constantly getting into trouble and
that an example had to be made, Saad instead offered a Solomon-like
solution in deference to Lawrence’s appeal: Daud could halve his
friend’s punishment by submitting to the other half himself. “Daud
leaped at the chance,” Lawrence wrote, “kissed my hand and Saad’s and
ran off up the valley.”</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence would strongly suggest that the
Farraj-Daud relationship was a sexual one, describing it as “an instance
of the eastern boy-and-boy affection which the segregation of women made
inevitable.” In the process, Lawrence was to add to speculations—still a
point of heated debate in some circles nearly a century later—about his
own sexuality. Much of that speculation stems from his description of
the “two bent figures, with pain in their eyes, but crooked smiles upon
their lips,” who showed up at his camp the next morning and begged to be
taken on as his servants:</p>
<p>“These were Daud the hasty and his love-fellow, Farraj, a beautiful,
soft-framed, girlish creature, with innocent smooth face and swimming
eyes.” After first trying to turn the boys away, explaining he had no
need of servants, Lawrence finally relented, “mainly because they looked
so young and clean.” From that day on, the mischievous antics of Daud
and Farraj would provide lighthearted relief to Lawrence’s travels.</p>
<p>But already in these early days of the journey, the party faced a
worrisome problem. Virtually all their camels, both the baggage and
mounted ones, suffered from the virulent mange endemic to Wejh, and
without even the rudimentary unguents to control it—butter was a
traditional desert remedy—many were quickly going lame or mad from it.
The epidemic may have contributed to the deaths of two of the baggage
camels that, during a climb through a particularly narrow defile, lost
their footing and plunged to the rocks below. None of this bode well as
they came to the edge of El Houl.</p>
<p>“In all Faisal’s stud of riding-camels,” Lawrence noted, “there was
not one healthy. In our little expedition every camel was weakening
daily. [Auda’s chief lieutenant] Nasir was full of anxiety lest many
break down in the forced march before us and leave their riders stranded
in the desert.”</p>
<p>The torturous nature of the passage across El Houl was reflected in
the small pocket diary Lawrence carried. Instead of the voluminous notes
he normally kept on his travels, the few short fragments he managed
there grew steadily more disjointed, almost nonsensical. And then, on
the fifth day, Gasim disappeared.</p>
<p>In deciding to turn back for the lost man, Lawrence surely knew that
Gasim was probably already dead; for anyone caught out in El Houl
without shelter or water at that time of year, life expectancy could be
measured in terms of hours. He surely also knew that if he’d made the
slightest miscalculation in his compass readings, he too would soon
expire. Still, he persevered—and finally, he was lucky. After an hour
and a half of riding, he spotted a small black object in the far
distance, an object that, as he approached, took the form of a
staggering and delirious Gasim. Hoisting the man onto the back of his
own camel, Lawrence turned and raced to find the others.</p>
<p>In David Lean’s epic film, the rescue of Gasim would be immortalized
in a ten-minute scene, culminating in Lawrence finally rejoining his
comrades to their relieved and raucous cheers, his noble act cementing
his image as a true “son of the desert.” The reality was quite
different. By the code of this brutal landscape, Gasim had brought his
death upon himself by having failed to secure his camel when he stopped
to relieve himself, and, rather than praised, Lawrence was berated by
some of his comrades for having risked his life for one clearly so
worthless. Furthermore, the caravan commander now administered another
beating to Daud and Farraj for letting Lawrence go back alone.</p>
<p>ON MAY 26, 1917, two days after Lawrence’s rescue of Gasim, King
George V and his War Cabinet received some gladdening news. It came in
the form of a top-secret cable from Reginald Wingate in Cairo, a report
on Mark Sykes’s latest triumphant visit to Arabia.</p>
<p>Following on Sykes’s earlier solo visit, he and his French diplomatic
counterpart, François Georges-Picot, had recently met with King Hussein
in Jeddah in hopes of thrashing out a settlement between the Arabs and
the French over the future status of Syria. Since their desires were
almost diametrically opposed—Hussein still insisting that postwar Syria
be part of a greater independent Arab nation, the French just as
insistent that it come under French control—there had been little
expectation of success. The first day’s session confirmed this
prognosis. After a tense three-hour confrontation on May 19, Picot and
Hussein had parted ways even more intransigent than before.</p>
<p>It came as a shock, therefore, when the following morning Hussein had
his interpreter read aloud to the European envoys a bold proposal: the
king was now ready to accept the same future French role in the
“Moslem-Syrian littoral”—presumably meaning the coastal, Lebanon portion
of Syria—as the British were to assume in the Iraqi province of Baghdad.
Since a victorious British army had recently placed Baghdad under
military occupation, and the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement called
for keeping the province under direct British control indefinitely, this
Baghdad-Lebanon equation of Hussein’s had the effect of suddenly ceding
to the French most everything they were asking for in Lebanon. As Sykes
reported to Wingate with what could only have been gross understatement,
“Monsieur Picot received this very well and relations became
cordial.”</p>
<p>It was a remarkable achievement. Against all odds, Sykes had managed
to make a crucial first cut through the great Gordian knot created by
Britain’s conflicting pacts and promises in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Yet for those familiar with Sykes’s modus operandi there was
something about this breakthrough that should have given pause. In
contrast to his usual prolixity on all manner of topics, his full report
on the Jeddah meetings, the most important diplomatic discussions
between the Allies and King Hussein to date, ran a mere four pages, with
Hussein’s startling Lebanon concession dealt with in a single sentence.
Additionally, neither Sykes nor Picot had pressed Hussein to commit his
offer to paper, nor had they managed to obtain a copy of the pledge the
king’s interpreter had read aloud. Even those senior officials in the
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs who had been fervently wishing for
just such a resolution quickly began to suspect there was something
altogether too neat about the deal struck in Jeddah.</p>
<p>Those concerns took tangible form when Stewart Newcombe arrived in
Cairo on May 27 and walked into Gilbert Clayton’s office. Both he and
Cyril Wilson had been present for at least some of the proceedings in
Jeddah, and had written up their own accounts of what had taken place.
Newcombe also brought the written account of Fuad al-Kutab, Hussein’s
interpreter and the man who had actually presented the proposal. While
they differed in specifics, all three indicated it had actually been
Mark Sykes, not Hussein, who had first come up with the Lebanon-Baghdad
formula. More troubling, the king appeared to have come away with a
radically different idea from the Allied envoys of what that formula
meant.</p>
<p>The most exercised over the matter was Cyril Wilson. “Although Sykes
and Picot were very pleased at this happy result,” he wrote, “and the
Sherif had made the [Lebanon-Baghdad] proposition himself, I did not
feel happy in my own my mind, and it struck me as possible that the
Sherif, one of the most courteous of men, absolutely loyal to me and
with complete faith in Great Britain, was verbally agreeing to a thing
which he never would agree to if he knew our interpretation of what the
Iraq situation is to be.”</p>
<p>In his distressed—and rather repetitive—twelve-page letter to
Clayton, Wilson detailed how he had repeatedly pressed Sykes to clarify
exactly what Hussein intended by the offer, only to have his concerns
brushed aside. Instead, Wilson reported, the entire affair had been
marked by a breezy refusal on Sykes’s part to get into particulars.</p>
<p>If less emotional, Newcombe’s protest was in many ways more striking.
His time in the Hejaz had been a difficult one, he had little faith in
the Arab rebels as a viable fighting force, and yet the episode in
Jeddah had left him perturbed. Central to his apprehensions was a
conversation he’d had with Hussein’s son Faisal, who had also been in
Jeddah during the envoys’ visit. In making his startling offer, Newcombe
reported, “[Hussein] stated to Faisal very vehemently that he was
perfectly willing to do this because Sir Mark Sykes, representing the
British government, had told him to, and that as Sir Mark Sykes had
advised him to leave everything in [his] hands, he felt glad to do so,
having absolute trust in the British government.”</p>
<p>From Newcombe’s vantage point as a British officer, this assurance by
Sykes, conjoined to Hussein’s obviously limited awareness of what he was
agreeing to, meant the British government now had a moral obligation to
see the Arab Revolt through to the end. “Otherwise we are hoodwinking
the Sherif and his people, and playing a very false game in which
[British] officers attached to the Sherif’s army are inevitably
committed, and which I know causes anxiety in several officers’ minds in
case we let them down.”</p>
<p>For all their unease, however, Wilson and Newcombe were either too
diplomatic to call Sykes out directly, or too credulous to piece the
whole scheme together. In actual fact, what had occurred in Jeddah was
not a potential misunderstanding, but an intricate and very cleverly
executed deception on Mark Sykes’s part.</p>
<p>The cornerstone for that deception had been laid three weeks earlier,
during Sykes’s first visit to Arabia. In his similarly spare report of
that trip, Sykes asserted that he had fully explained the Sykes-Picot
Agreement to Hussein and Faisal, and won their grudging acceptance.
While that wasn’t at all Faisal’s assessment of their meeting, the
British envoy could be confident that British officialdom would surely
take his word—a sitting member of Parliament and a baronet no less—over
that of an erratic Arab tribal chieftain and his warrior son. Of course,
there was at least one other person who knew that Sykes had lied about
his candor during that first trip, and whom British officialdom just
might listen to. This was T. E. Lawrence, but to Sykes’s good fortune,
Lawrence had now fallen from view, embarked on his northern trek, and he
remained totally incommunicado during Sykes’s crucial return visit to
Jeddah with Picot.</p>
<p>It seems Sykes was inspired to his master deception by pondering the
very issue that had made such a mess of the initial Picot-Hussein
meeting on May 19: Picot’s insistence that France enjoy the same role in
coastal Syria as the British were to assume in Baghdad. At the time,
Sykes had been deeply irritated by this linkage—he wanted to keep French
and British desiderata in the Middle East quite separate—and he had left
the discussions in a dispirited mood. However, once back on HMS
Northbrook, the British warship that had brought the envoys to Jeddah
and upon which they were staying, an obvious solution to his dilemma
apparently occurred to Sykes.</p>
<p>The reason Hussein was resisting the Lebanon-Baghdad linkage was
simply because he didn’t want any French presence anywhere, not because
he somehow knew Baghdad was slated to fall under permanent British
control. The only way Hussein could have known that was if Sykes had
told him of that clause in Sykes-Picot, and Sykes most certainly had
not.</p>
<p>Instead, the last word Hussein had on British intentions in Baghdad
was the vague accord he had reached with High Commissioner Henry McMahon
back in late 1915. In their back-and-forth correspondence, McMahon had
argued that, in light of Britain’s economic interests in Iraq, the
provinces of Basra and Baghdad would require “special administrative
arrangements” within the future Arab nation, implying some measure of
British control. In response, Hussein had offered to leave those
provinces under British administration “for a short time,” provided that
“a suitable sum [was] paid as compensation to the Arab kingdom for the
period of occupation.” From all this, Sykes surmised, Hussein still held
to the belief that any British presence in Iraq was to be along the
lines of a short-term leasing arrangement, but that those provinces’
ultimate inclusion in the greater independent Arab nation was secure.
Indeed, on several recent occasions, Hussein had enigmatically assured
his closest confidants, including both Faisal and Fuad al-Kutab, that he
had an ironclad British promise about Iraq’s future “in his pocket,”
even as he refused to show them the actual letters from McMahon.</p>
<p>To Sykes, it opened up a tantalizing prospect. Between Hussein’s
ignorance of Sykes-Picot, and Picot’s ignorance of the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence, it might be possible to forge an agreement in which both
sides thought they were gaining the upper hand. The ultimate beauty
there was that with both sides believing they’d essentially tricked the
other, neither would want to risk scuttling the deal by getting into
specifics. On that same afternoon of May 19, Sykes sent an urgent
message ashore from the Northbrook asking that Fuad al-Kutab visit
him.</p>
<p>At that meeting, Sykes impressed on Fuad the need to limit Hussein’s
overtures on the following day to just two points. The first, little
more than a goodwill gesture, was for Hussein to announce that he would
withhold support from a group of Syrian exiles who were soon to embark
on an international lobbying campaign for Arab independence. The second,
and obviously vastly more important, was for Hussein to cede to the
Lebanon-Baghdad formula. To the nonplussed al-Kutab, Sykes was
reassuring, repeatedly telling the advisor to leave the matter in his
hands and he would see to everything.</p>
<p>Even so, Hussein was wary of agreeing to the plan. He finally
relented, al-Kutab related, because “he knows that Sir Mark Sykes can
fight for the Arabs better than he himself in political matters, and
knows that Sir Mark Sykes speaks with the authority of the British
government and will therefore be able to carry out his promises.”
Besides, Hussein reminded al-Kutab once more, he had “a letter from Sir
Henry McMahon which promises all I wish. This I know is alright, as the
British government will fulfill her word.”</p>
<p>The following morning, Fuad delivered Hussein’s proclamation as
directed. That afternoon, as the Northbrook sailed out of Jeddah harbor,
Georges-Picot could believe France had just been handed Lebanon, while
King Hussein could believe he had just maneuvered France into accepting
the future independence of all of Syria.</p>
<p>Even if not grasping the fraud that had been perpetrated, Wilson and
Newcombe were sufficiently appalled by Sykes’s cavalier approach to
demand a full accounting in their letters to Clayton. Wilson urged that
Sykes be compelled to put in writing what he believed had been agreed to
in Jeddah, and that Hussein be told precisely what British intentions
truly were. “If we are not going to see the Sherif through,” Wilson
wrote, “and we let him down badly after all his trust in us, the very
‘enviable’ post of Pilgrimage Officer at Jeddah will be vacant, because
I certainly could not remain.”</p>
<p>But when it came to political gamesmanship, the Arabs were not
necessarily rubes themselves. With his secret knowledge of the
Sykes-Picot Agreement, courtesy of Lawrence, Faisal was understandably
aghast at what his father had agreed to, and quickly sought to turn the
tables. On May 28, he issued a public proclamation to the Syrian people
calling them to arms in the cause of Arab independence, while heaping
praise on Great Britain for her aid in that mission. “Doubtless in doing
so,” Faisal wrote, “her sole object is to see in the world an
independent Arab government, established and administered by the Arabs,
without any modification of the boundaries of its country.” The French
came in for similar treatment. After thanking France for her past
contributions in Syria, Faisal noted that “we are deeply grateful to her
for having joined her Ally in recognizing our independence.”</p>
<p>Far from an accord, then, the real result of Sykes’s charade in
Jeddah was a deepening of the gulf between Arab and Allied aspirations
in the Middle East, a schism that was soon to have very ugly and lasting
repercussions. In the interim, British policymakers reverted to the
strategy they knew best: do nothing, see what comes next, and hope that
it all works out in the end. When asked about Faisal’s proclamation, so
at odds with the agreement ostensibly reached days earlier, Sykes
shrugged it off as a propaganda ploy meant for domestic Arab
consumption. When Clayton finally got around to taking Wilson’s and
Newcombe’s complaints to Sykes, it was with an escape clause built in.
“I do not attach very great importance to this,” he wrote of Hussein’s
apparent confusion, “as I think that events will be too strong for him
and that, in the end, he will have to fall in line, or fall out.”</p>
<p>One man who wouldn’t let things drop was the dogged Cyril Wilson. In
late June 1917, fully a month after he’d first sent his complaints to
Cairo and received no satisfaction, he wrote to Reginald Wingate’s
deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Symes, urging that Sykes be made to
write out a “short statement of fact” on exactly what had been agreed to
at Jeddah. As Wilson pointedly noted, “there cannot be any harm in
writing a fact [sic] which Sir Mark Sykes, I understand, states he
clearly explained to the Sherif.”</p>
<p>But paper trails had already caused enough problems in the Middle
East, and Symes saw no reason to add to them. “The whole question is at
present in a state of flux,” he answered Wilson, “and depends entirely
on various developments in the war. It is therefore quite impossible to
lay down anything in the least definite, and all we can do is to keep
the various factions in play so far as possible until the situation
becomes more clear. It is a difficult position, I know, but there it
is.”</p>
<p>On a pathetic note, perhaps the stoutest defender of British honor in
the wake of the Jeddah meetings was the man most victimized by them,
King Hussein. Upon learning of the overture made on the decks of the
Northbrook, Faisal got into a heated argument with his father, until
Hussein finally cut him off with a rebuke: “These words are from a
father to his son. Never doubt Great Britain’s word. She is wise and
trustworthy; have no fear.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>IT WAS SUPPOSED to be a refuge, but Lawrence saw it very differently:
a place of torment and pestilence, a nightmarish landscape to be escaped
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Running in a northwest-to-southeast diagonal through the borderlands
of Arabia and Syria (modern-day Jordan), the two-hundred-mile-long Wadi
Sirhan is more properly a geological depression, a
hundred-million-year-old narrow drainage valley for when this desolate
corner of the world had abundant water. In 1917, the wadi was where Auda
Abu Tayi arranged to have his Howeitat kinsmen assemble to meet the tiny
force he and Lawrence were bringing up from Wejh.</p>
<p>As Lawrence noted in Seven Pillars, with its ample water wells and
relative lushness, Wadi Sirhan should have seemed a veritable paradise
after their crossing of El Houl. Instead, at least two aspects made the
place barely tolerable. The first was its poisonous snakes. There were
horned vipers and puff adders and cobras, and they seemed to be
everywhere—tucked beneath rocks, draped on bushes, coiled at water’s
edge—and as a man with an almost phobic fear of snakes, Lawrence never
found a moment of true peace. Not that his fears were all that
irrational; within days of arriving in Wadi Sirhan, three of the men who
had made the passage from Wejh were dead from snakebites, and four
others nearly so. Neither did the local “remedy” inspire much
confidence, consisting as it did of binding a victim’s wound with
snakeskin plaster and then reciting Koranic verses over him until he
died.</p>
<p>Then there were the banquets. Wadi Sirhan constituted the lower
reaches of the domain of Nuri Shalaan, one of the most powerful tribal
chieftains of southern Syria, and Auda had immediately set off to meet
with Shalaan and gain his permission for the rebels’ presence there.
This left Lawrence to stand as one of the chief guests of honor at the
nightly feasts of rice and mutton put on by the gathered Howeitat clans.
As any westerner who has been their guest might attest, Bedouin
hospitality can be so overwhelming as to border on the oppressive, and
so it quickly became for Lawrence. Each night, different impoverished
families competed to play host to the travelers from Wejh, and in
Lawrence’s lavish description of these banquets, what starts out as
colorfully folkloric gradually veers toward the grotesque, especially
when he lingers on the image of swollen-bellied children gathered at the
periphery of the feasts, anxiously awaiting their chance to swoop in and
snatch up any leavings from the communal tray.</p>
<p>“The landscape was of a hopelessness and sadness deeper than all the
open deserts we had crossed,” Lawrence wrote. “Sand or flint or a desert
of bare rocks was exciting sometimes, and in certain lights had the
monstrous beauty of sterile desolation; but there was something
sinister, something actively evil in this snake-devoted Sirhan.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence’s torments went beyond reptiles and too much mutton. In
those quiet days of waiting, with more and more tribes coming in to
negotiate their alliance with the rebel emissaries, he became acutely
aware of the cloak of deception he wore.</p>
<p>It was a deception that operated on multiple levels. On the day they
had set out from Wejh, most of Lawrence’s companions knew only the
official reason for their journey: to rally the Syrian tribes and
prepare for Faisal’s advance north. Knowledge of the concrete objective,
the capture of Aqaba, was held by only a very small handful of men.
Indeed, it’s possible the full plan was known only to Lawrence, that
even Auda and Faisal hadn’t the complete picture.</p>
<p>His romantic reputation aside, Auda was essentially a desert raider
and, as such, primarily interested in plunder. Since there would be
precious little by way of loot in Aqaba, Lawrence may well have kept
matters vague at the outset, operating on the premise that at some point
during the expedition he could convince Auda that Aqaba’s capture would
serve his long-term interests better than whatever more obvious spoils
lay close to hand. As for Faisal, in the wake of Lawrence’s departure
from Wejh, he once again lobbied his British advisors for an early
advance on Aqaba. Perhaps this was a ruse on Faisal’s part, a way to
further mask Lawrence’s true destination from his colleagues, but it
seems equally likely that the Arab leader did so because he hadn’t been
apprised of precisely what that destination was. Of course, these were
mere tactical deceptions, made necessary by the exigencies of war, but
it meant the ultimate onus of leadership—not to mention of possible
failure and the catastrophe this would unleash on those around
him—rested on Lawrence’s shoulders alone.</p>
<p>What made all this infinitely more burdensome was the greater
deception that lay beyond: the planned betrayal of the Arabs at the
Allies’ hands. It seems Lawrence had only grasped the full scope of this
double cross at his meeting with Mark Sykes just before his departure
from Wejh, and it clearly weighed heavily on him on the journey north.
Of this, Lawrence obviously could confide even less in his traveling
companions, and his sense of guilt became overwhelming in the face of
the endless stream of tribal delegations coming into Wadi Sirhan to join
the fight for Arab independence.</p>
<p>“They saw in me a free agent of the British Government,” he wrote,
“and demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises. So I had
to join the conspiracy and, for what my word was worth, assured the men
of their reward.” It was a role that left Lawrence “continually and
bitterly ashamed,” for “it was evident from the beginning that if we won
the war, these promises would be dead paper, and had I been an honest
advisor of the Arabs, I would have advised them to go home and not risk
their lives fighting for such stuff.”</p>
<p>But of course Lawrence could do no such thing. As an alternative, he
chose to remove himself from the scene. “Can’t stand another day here,”
he jotted in his journal on June 5. “Will ride N[orth] and chuck
it.”</p>
<p>The choice of phrase, “chuck it,” was an interesting one, for what
Lawrence now proposed was a trek into the heart of Turkish-held Syria, a
journey so hazardous as to be practically suicidal. In Seven Pillars, he
would attempt to rationalize this decision by explaining that he wished
to venture into the north to “sound its opinions and learn enough to lay
definite plans. My general knowledge of Syria was fairly good, and some
parts I knew exactly, but I felt that one more sight of it would put
straight the ideas of strategic geography given me by the Crusades.”</p>
<p>Implicit in this quest was the hope, slender though it might be, that
if the Arab Revolt could be raised in the Syrian heartland, the
imperialist designs of France might yet be subverted. Pressing up
against this hope, though, was the far likelier outcome: that in revolt,
the Syrians would fight and die for a cause already lost.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s anguish at the situation was evident in the scribbled
message he wrote Gilbert Clayton in the margin of his notebook.
“Clayton. I’ve decided to go off alone to Damascus, hoping to get killed
on the way. For all sakes try and clear this show up before it goes any
further. We are calling them to fight for us on a lie, and I can’t stand
it.” Figuring the notebook would eventually find its way into British
hands should he die on his mission, Lawrence left the notebook in Wadi
Sirhan and set off for the north in the company of just two guides.</p>
<p>It was to be perhaps his most audacious exploit of the entire war, a
circuitous four-hundred-mile tour through enemy territory that carried
him to the border of Lebanon and to the very outskirts of Damascus. The
feat would win him a nomination for the Victoria Cross, Britain’s
highest military decoration, yet also endure as one of the most
mysterious and least-documented episodes in Lawrence’s life. This was
very deliberately so. The sole report he would eventually submit to his
superiors in Cairo recounting the odyssey would run to just four pages.
In Seven Pillars, a 650-page book studded with exhaustive disquisitions
on the flora and geological features of obscure desert basins,
Lawrence’s northern expedition is dispensed with in a few paragraphs and
derided “as barren of consequence as it was unworthy of motive.”</p>
<p>What is known about that journey is that, time and again, Lawrence
secretly met with prospective allies in the Arab Revolt—tribal leaders
and urban nationalists—only to be greeted with profound hesitation. It
was the classic conundrum of guerrilla warfare: Faisal’s rebels needed
local support to pave their way into Syria, but the locals couldn’t
reasonably be asked to rise up without the aid and armed support of the
rebels. In that riddle, and in how terribly wrong events could go if the
right balance wasn’t achieved, Lawrence felt the weight of his and
Britain’s deceit more keenly than ever.</p>
<p>From both a political and personally defining standpoint, Lawrence’s
most consequential encounter came toward the end of his journey, when he
stopped in Azraq, a desert oasis in southeastern Syria, to meet with
Emir Nuri Shalaan. Testament to Shalaan’s preeminence in the region, it
was to him that Auda Abu Tayi had sped weeks earlier seeking permission
to use Wadi Sirhan as a gathering point for his Howeitat tribesmen.
Since even before the Arab Revolt began, King Hussein had sent
emissaries to Shalaan in an attempt to win him and his vast Rualla tribe
to the cause, and for just as long the emir had nimbly danced along the
knife’s edge, hinting he might soon be ready to join the rebellion, only
to then nudge back toward the Ottoman side. It wasn’t just his authority
that made Shalaan an imposing figure, however; in Lawrence’s hand, the
chieftain appeared almost the spectral personification of death
itself:</p>
<p>“Very old, livid, and worn, with a gray sorrow and remorse upon him,
and a bitter smile the only mobility of his face. Upon his coarse
eyelashes the eyelids sagged down in tired folds, through which from the
overhead sun, a red light glittered into his eye sockets and made them
look like fiery pits in which the man was slowly burning.”</p>
<p>But perhaps this somewhat overwrought description stemmed from
something else about Nuri Shalaan. Despite his isolation in the desert,
it seemed the Rualla chieftain was well informed on the various promises
the British had made to Hussein and other Arab leaders in the Hejaz over
the previous two years. By way of taking Lawrence’s measure, Shalaan
brought out copies of these conflicting documents, laid them before his
visitor, and asked which ones he should believe. “I saw that with my
answer I would gain or lose him,” Lawrence recounted, “and in him the
outcome of the Arab movement.”</p>
<p>Lawrence counseled that Shalaan should trust in the most recent of
the British promises. It seemed to assuage the desert chieftain, but of
course simply brought a new measure of guilt to Lawrence’s burdened
conscience.</p>
<p>After that meeting with Shalaan, Lawrence returned to his companions
waiting in Wadi Sirhan with an iron resolve to compel Britain to uphold
her pledges to the Arabs. He would do so by personally leading the Arabs
onto an expanded Syrian battlefield, a campaign that would enable them
to lay claim to the lands they conquered and thus cheat the French of
their imperial designs. “In other words,” Lawrence wrote, “I presumed
(seeing no other leader with the will and power) that I would survive
the campaigns, and be able to defeat not merely the Turks on the
battlefield, but my own country and its allies in the
council-chamber.”</p>
<p>This was, he admitted, “an immodest presumption.”</p>
<p>LAWRENCE WASN’T THE only Western intelligence agent afoot in Syria
that June. In fact, at one point during his impetuous reconnaissance
trek to the north, he came within three miles of crossing paths with his
old nemesis, Curt Prüfer.</p>
<p>Since returning from Germany in March, Prüfer had rarely left the
comparative comfort of his desk job at the intelligence bureau
headquarters in Constantinople. The grand partnership of German
government and industry envisioned by Max von Oppenheim had largely
withered on the vine, with German businessmen understandably loath to
invest in a region grown more destitute and fractured by the day. Prüfer
had instead spent much of his time trying to arrange for the publication
of a new series of pro-German propaganda pamphlets, only to be beset
with niggling queries from Berlin over printing costs and bureaucratic
obstacles thrown up by obdurate Ottoman censors.</p>
<p>In mid-May, he decided to break from this tedious routine by
conducting an extended inspection tour of the German propaganda centers
and libraries that Oppenheim had established across Syria the year
before. These field trips were also what made Prüfer a good intelligence
agent, providing him with a firsthand view that often conflicted with
the sugarcoated communiqués and cables that crossed his desk. Even so,
on this outing he was in for a shock.</p>
<p>As often happens in war, by the spring of 1917 the outside world was
gaining a rather clearer picture of what was happening inside the
Ottoman Empire than the empire’s own inhabitants. Much of that insight
was coming from American consular officials who had begun vacating their
posts following the break in U.S.-Ottoman diplomatic relations in April.
In debriefings in Switzerland and Washington and London, these officials
told of a land where hundreds of thousands of civilians had succumbed to
disease or starvation, where vast territories were in a state of
near-open rebellion, and where army units suffered desertion rates of
25, 30, even 40 percent. The more perceptive of these recent evacuees
also reported on the growing friction between Turkish and German
military units, a mutual antipathy that had occasionally led to
violence, and of the general population’s utter apathy, their most
fervent desire simply for the war to end and life to become tolerable
again.</p>
<p>Certainly, Prüfer had received glimmers of all this while in
Constantinople. Even if downplayed, reports from the field told of food
shortages and epidemics, of flagging morale among both the Turkish
citizenry and soldiers. But none of that truly prepared Prüfer for the
ravages awaiting him when he boarded an interior-bound train at Haidar
Pasha station on May 21. Most telling from Prüfer’s standpoint were the
deprivations he personally had to endure on this journey. Gone were the
special train cars put on for his comfort and the official banquets held
in his honor. Instead, and despite being one of the most important
German officials in the Middle East, his travel now was aboard packed
and dilapidated trains that frequently broke down or were shunted to
sidings for hours, even days, for no apparent reason, the only
accommodation to be found in filthy and flea-infested hostels. The spare
diary he kept of that two-month odyssey, brief entries made in a
penciled scrawl, consisted of an almost unbroken litany of
complaint.</p>
<p>Adding to Prüfer’s misery, and rather epitomizing the ruin about him,
was an intermittent toothache that steadily worsened until his entire
jaw was inflamed. A dentist tentatively diagnosed scurvy, a disease now
rampant in Syria and caused by a simple vitamin C deficiency. Until two
years earlier Syria had been one of the great citrus-growing regions of
the world, but in the face of a chronic coal shortage most of its fruit
trees had been cut down to provide fuel for train engines.</p>
<p>Yet despite seeing all this with his own eyes, Curt Prüfer seemed
determined to miss its import. As he reported to senior diplomats in
Berlin, the reason his and Max Oppenheim’s shared dream of pan-Islamic
jihad had thus far failed to galvanize the Muslim masses was mostly just
a matter of poor communication. “Hysterical propaganda that focuses on
enemy atrocities are a waste of time,” he wrote. “The peoples of the
Turkish empire aren’t stupid, they know what is going on around
them.”</p>
<p>Even with his criticisms, however, Prüfer failed to detect the
fissures already cracked open all about him. He had frequently written
that the Syrian Arabs were too cowardly to rise up against the Turks,
and nothing he saw on this journey caused him to reassess that view. On
June 3, while Prüfer was in Damascus, T. E. Lawrence was in a village a
mere three miles away, plotting with an Arab nationalist leader on how
to bring the Arab Revolt into the Syrian capital. Prüfer had been even
more dismissive of the Jewish settlers in Palestine, calling them docile
and obedient. June 12 saw the German intelligence chief staying at a
crude little hotel in the Palestinian village of Zammarin, just one mile
from the Jewish settlement of Zichron Yaakov that was the hub of the
NILI spy network.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SARAH AARONSOHN’S VISIT to Cairo in mid-April had been planned as a
very brief one, a chance to meet with her brother and for the two of
them to coordinate NILI’s activities for the coming months. On the next
sailing of the Managem, Sarah and her chief NILI deputy, Joseph
Lishansky, were to be slipped back ashore at Athlit and the spying
campaign resumed. Instead, there had ensued such a string of bad
luck—two abortive sailings, a bout of malaria that landed Sarah in a
hospital for two weeks—that it seemed an open question whether she and
Lishansky would ever get home at all. By the end of May, the pair were
right back at their Egyptian starting point.</p>
<p>If Aaron Aaronsohn was understandably frustrated by these delays—he
had never intended Joseph Lishansky to leave Athlit in the first place,
and the spy network was surely foundering in both his and Sarah’s
absence—he was also experiencing a bit of a change of heart. A loner at
the best of times, he nevertheless enjoyed his sister’s companionship in
Cairo and was coming to rely on her levelheaded advice in his battles
with the British bureaucracy. He now decided it would be cruel to return
her to Athlit after all. “I do not see the necessity of it,” he confided
in his diary on May 31, “now that the most precious time is past.”</p>
<p>Convincing the iron-willed Sarah Aaronsohn of this, however, was an
altogether different matter. When her brother broached the idea, her
response was immediate and adamant: she was going back to Palestine no
matter what. The agronomist tried a different tack. During her stay in
Cairo, Sarah had become a familiar figure to many of the British
officers her brother associated with, an object of admiration for the
very dangerous work she was conducting. At the same time, some of these
officers, imbued with an old-fashioned code of chivalry, had hinted to
Aaron Aaronsohn that it was a tad unseemly for a woman to continue to
face such “manly” perils. This view was most persistently put forward by
Aaronsohn’s erstwhile handler, William Edmonds, and Aaronsohn arranged
for the EMSIB captain to raise it anew one evening while he and Sarah
sat in the lounge of the Continental Hotel.</p>
<p>“Madam,” Edmonds stiffly addressed Sarah, “the High Command has
authorized me to thank you very much for all that you have done for us.
They urge you not to return to Palestine. Egypt is open to you. You can
stay here as long as you wish. What you have done up to now is valuable,
and it is enough.”</p>
<p>While thanking the captain for the offer, Sarah Aaronsohn instantly
saw through the charade. Turning to her brother, she said, “If you know
me, give me the means to return. If you don’t provide them for me, I’ll
find my way back myself.”</p>
<p>On June 15, the spy ship Managem sailed once more. This time it
managed to reach Athlit, and both Sarah Aaronsohn and Joseph Lishansky
went ashore. When Aaron Aaronsohn got the word, it provoked a
complicated reaction, relief and regret intermixed. As events would
prove, this latter sentiment was quite justified; he would never see
either his sister or Lishansky again.</p>
<p>ON THEIR FAST racing camels, Auda and Lawrence set off ahead of the
others to inspect the water wells of Bair. Following behind was the
fighting force that had been painstakingly assembled in Wadi Sirhan over
the previous three weeks: some five hundred tribal fighters, mostly
Howeitat, ready to strike a blow against their Turkish overlords. All
had left Wadi Sirhan two days before, June 18, in the highest of
spirits.</p>
<p>As a consequence, what Auda and Lawrence discovered at Bair was
deeply dispiriting. All three of the oasis’s principal wells had
recently been dynamited by the Turks, reduced to heaps of broken stones
and still-smoldering timbers. By good luck, the charge they had placed
on a fourth well a short distance away had failed to detonate, affording
the rebel force just enough water to sustain themselves and their
camels, but the larger message was a grim one: the Turks were onto
them.</p>
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive, the desert is one of the more
difficult places to keep one’s presence a secret. Travelers are wedded
to moving between available sources of water, and on a landscape where
others are also constantly on the move, crossing a desert is rather akin
to traveling a highway possessed of very few side roads. Among the
tribes of southeastern Syria, a great many had heard of the rebel force
being mustered in Wadi Sirhan by that third week in June, and
inevitably, so had the Turks. By blowing the wells at Bair, the first
principal water source west of Wadi Sirhan, the Turks hoped to block
their enemy’s advance before it even got under way.</p>
<p>While that mission had failed just enough to allow the rebels and
their animals to stay alive in Bair, it cast grave doubt over the next
proposed leg of their march. Seventy miles to the southwest of Bair
stood the crossroads town of Maan, astride the Hejaz Railway and the
strategic hub of the entire region. Lawrence’s plan was to skirt below
the heavily garrisoned town and continue toward Aqaba, but this scheme
was dependent on finding water at Jefer, another series of desert wells
just twenty-five miles to the northeast of Maan. The problem was that
once the Turks in Maan figured out the rebels were heading for Aqaba—and
at this point even “the most civilian owl could not fail to see
that”—they could send a demolition team out to destroy the Jefer wells
long before the rebels got there.</p>
<p>The key, then, was to devise a screen, to confuse the Turks both as
to where the rebels currently were and where they might be headed. From
Bair, emissaries were sent to area tribes with word that the rebel force
was still organizing itself back in Wadi Sirhan; surely at least one of
these tribes would pass this “intelligence” on to the Turks to curry
favor. Simultaneously, small units of fighters were dispatched to
conduct pinprick attacks throughout the region.</p>
<p>Lawrence had laid some of the groundwork for this screen during his
earlier trip north. In early June, he had led a handful of local
recruits and blown up a small bridge of the Hejaz Railway north of
Damascus; that attack, occurring hundreds of miles from any previous
action by the rebels, had so alarmed Turkish authorities that they’d
briefly been convinced a local insurrection was about to get under way.
For the expanded screening operation out of Bair, Lawrence chose to lead
the most ambitious effort himself. On June 21, he and some one hundred
fighters struck out from the oasis and made for the railhead town of
Amman, 150 miles to the north.</p>
<p>It was to be a peculiar kind of exercise, and one that constantly put
Lawrence’s skills of persuasion to the test. Time and again, he had to
stay his Arab companions from the pitched battles they desperately
craved, reminding them this was meant to be a show of force, a game of
bluff in which a destroyed railway culvert sent just as powerful a
message to the enemy as a blown‑up train. This wasn’t at all the way the
Arab tribesmen thought battle should be joined, but as they were scant
in number and dependent on mobility, Lawrence was determined that they
avoid protracted firefights or anything else that might delay their
quick return to Bair. This imperative of speed, however, also had a
nasty side effect; simply put, this was a force with neither the time
nor the capacity to deal with prisoners.</p>
<p>While preparing the ambush on the Turkish garrison at Aba el Naam
three months earlier, Lawrence and his companions had been inadvertently
discovered by a wandering shepherd boy. Fearing the boy would alert the
Turks to their presence if released, but with the shepherd increasingly
distraught at being separated from his flock, the ambush party had
finally resorted to a somewhat comical solution: they tied the boy to a
tree for the duration of the battle, then cut him free as they fled. In
their hit-and-run operations around Amman, the raiders hadn’t the luxury
of such consideration.</p>
<p>On one occasion, they encountered a traveling Circassian merchant.
Unable to take him along as a prisoner but reluctant to let him go— most
Circassians were Turkish sympathizers—many in the raiding party argued
for his quick execution. By way of compromise, they instead stripped the
man naked and sliced the soles of his feet open with a dagger. “Odd as
was the performance,” Lawrence noted mildly, “it seemed effective and
more merciful than death. The cuts would make him travel to the railway
on hands and knees, a journey of an hour, and his nakedness would keep
him in the shadow of the rocks till the sun was low.” While the
Circassian’s ultimate fate is unknown, the merciful aspects of leaving a
naked and crippled man out in the Syrian desert in June might reasonably
be debated.</p>
<p>By the time the raiding party returned to Bair, Lawrence had every
reason to feel confident. In response to their disinformation effort,
the Turks had just dispatched a four-hundred-man cavalry unit to hunt
down the phantom rebel force in Wadi Sirhan. Over the previous week, the
Arabs had carried out a series of hit-and-run strikes across the length
of southern Syria with no discernible pattern. By now, the Turks surely
thought the next attack could come most anywhere, and were distracted
from the still-distant target of Aqaba. With such confidence, the rebel
force moved on the water wells of Jefer.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the Turks had destroyed the Jefer wells too, but with
only slightly more efficiency than they’d shown at Bair. One of the
wells was only partially collapsed, and a daylong repair effort restored
it to use. While that project was under way, Lawrence received the most
remarkable news of all.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, a flying column had been sent to rally the tribes
residing in the foothills to the southwest of Maan and in the direction
of Aqaba. Together, they had attacked the Turkish blockhouse at Fuweila,
occupying a high point astride the Maan-Aqaba road. Initially that
attack had accomplished little, the tribesmen easily driven off by the
entrenched soldiers, but then the Turks in Fuweila had launched a
reprisal raid. Falling on a nearby Howeitat settlement, they had cut the
throats of everyone they found: one old man and a dozen women and
children. Blind with rage, the Arab warriors had renewed their assault
on the Fuweila blockhouse, overrun it, and slaughtered every soldier
within. As a result, one of the chief Turkish strongpoints on the Aqaba
road was suddenly gone, the path over the mountains virtually clear.
Scrambling to action, the rebel force in Jefer raced for Fuweila.</p>
<p>Their excitement was to be short-lived. As they skirted below Maan on
the afternoon of July 1, word came that a relief force of some 550
Turkish soldiers had left Maan en route to Fuweila that morning. That
force was now somewhere on the road ahead of them.</p>
<p>It placed Lawrence in a deep quandary. With their greater mobility,
the Arabs might be able to get ahead of the relief column and continue
on toward Aqaba, but that would mean leaving a sizable Turkish force,
already on the march, close behind them on the Wadi Itm trail—in effect,
almost the precise scenario that Lawrence had persistently warned would
be the result of an amphibious landing. There really was only one
choice: to find the Turkish relief column and destroy it.</p>
<p>IT HAD BEEN nearly four years since William Yale sailed from New York
harbor aboard SS Imperator, a “playboy” embarked on a tour of the Holy
Land should any of his fellow passengers ask. Now, in mid-June 1917, he
was returning to a city in the grips of a patriotic frenzy. Across
Manhattan, buildings were festooned with enormous American flags,
windows were framed with red-white-and-blue bunting, and a fevered
excitement still carried on the air two months after President Wilson
had brought the country into the war.</p>
<p>One reason for the sustained excitement may have been that it was
still a long way off before war’s more disagreeable
aspects—specifically, dead and maimed soldiers—would begin to intrude on
the festivities. Since 1914, Wilson had deliberately kept the American
army near its paltry peacetime size as a roundabout way to defeat the
interventionists; after all, with a standing army of just over 120,000
soldiers, about one-twentieth the size of any of the major European
powers, what could the United States possibly contribute to the war
effort? Most estimates were that it would be up to a year before an
American army—now slated to grow to well over one million—might
contribute to the European battlefield in any significant way.</p>
<p>Further slowing matters was evidence that, beyond the flag-waving,
the American public was showing a marked hesitancy in signing on for the
fighting and dying. Wilson had been under the impression that his
high-blown rhetoric alone would serve to bring a flood of volunteers to
the army recruitment centers, but it seems most of his countrymen got
lost somewhere between his old boast that the United States was “too
proud to fight” and his new exhortation that “the world must be made
safe for democracy.” By mid-May 1917, fewer than 100,000 young men had
enlisted for this crusade, leading to the enactment of a draft law for
the first time since the American Civil War. Consequently, when Yale
stepped off his ship in New York harbor that June, one of his first
errands was to register with the local Selective Service board.</p>
<p>The oilman could have harbored few illusions about what lay in store
for him—as a twenty-nine-year-old single man with no dependents,
draftees didn’t come any more Class I than William Yale—and it was a
prospect that filled him with dread. Part of it was that, as opposed to
most of his countrymen, he had already seen the hideous face of modern
war—not the slaughter in the trenches in France, but the equally
grotesque spectacle of civilians dying en masse from starvation and
disease in Syria. He’d observed subtler facets of it during his long
slow journey across southern Europe to get home: the bread lines that
had stretched for blocks in Vienna, the looks of crushing resignation
among a company of French soldiers waiting on a train platform for
transport to the front. He also undoubtedly saw exactly where military
induction would take him. Perched as he was at the upper end of
conscription age (thirty in May 1917, raised to forty-five just three
months later), in combination with his college education and
aristocratic pedigree, he would almost surely be shunted into an
officer-training academy. Once there, given his business background and
technical expertise, he would just as surely be further shunted along to
the supply-and-logistics orbit of the quartermaster’s office. And since
the United States had only declared war on Germany, meaning practically
everyone was to be sent to the Western Front, Yale would most likely
spend his war “career” ticking off checklists at some supply depot well
behind the lines in rural France.</p>
<p>This was not at all the future that the ambitious oilman saw for
himself, and he was brash enough to believe that the four years he’d
just spent in the Ottoman Empire might make him an attractive candidate
for a more meaningful position somewhere in the governmental or military
hierarchy. After spending a mere weekend at the Yale family’s upstate
New York retreat, reuniting with the parents and siblings he hadn’t seen
since 1913, William Yale returned to New York City and hit the
hustings.</p>
<p>The result was demoralizing. Despite his calling on every business
and college acquaintance he could think of, few had any suggestions for
where an “Eastern hand” might fit into the larger scheme of things in a
nation at war. He called on Socony headquarters at 26 Broadway, figuring
that though their Middle Eastern operations were likely to remain
suspended for the conflict’s duration, they might find something else
overseas for an employee who had served them so loyally and in such
difficult circumstances. That plan fell through when, meeting with one
of the Socony directors, the pugnacious Yale lambasted the company’s
recent decision to stop paying the salaries of their native employees in
the Middle East, pointing out that this pittance for a corporation like
Socony was life-sustaining for those trapped in the war zone. Alas, Yale
discovered after being ordered from the office, his listener had been
the author of that directive.</p>
<p>Despairing of finding anything in New York, he went to Washington,
D.C., sustained by the thought that in the locus of power, surely
someone would appreciate what he had to offer. As his calling card, Yale
wrote up a detailed report on all he had seen and heard in Syria. “Three
years of war,” he wrote, “have reduced Palestine to a deplorable
condition, the villages depleted by military drafts, devastated by
cholera, typhus and recurrent fever, and typhoid has resulted in
reducing the population [by] probably over 25%.” The situation was even
worse in Lebanon, he reported, where, according to one of his Turkish
military informants, at least 30,000 civilians had already starved to
death, and unconfirmed rumors put the figure at over 100,000.</p>
<p>Of possibly greater interest to his prospective readers was the
oilman’s attention to military matters. Yale had clearly put his long
rail journey from Jerusalem to Constantinople to good use, listing a
number of critical bridges and embankments along the line that, if
bombed, would all but cripple the Turks’ ability to bring supplies or
reinforcements from Anatolia to Syria or Iraq. He also pinpointed the
location of an array of critical German military installations along the
route, including a wireless relay station in the Amanus Mountains made
conspicuous by the Swiss chalet-style German barracks alongside it. “I
saw also German aeroplanes and hospital units going south. One German
aeroplane division of twenty-three aeroplanes, I was informed by the
German captain in charge, was on its way to Beersheva.” He was even able
to report that between 150 and 200 German transport trucks were now
carrying supplies to Turkish forces in southern Palestine “over a new
military road which connects Jerusalem, Hebron and Beersheba,” while
tactfully omitting that this was the same road on which he had overseen
construction for Standard Oil in 1914.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Allied officials had started to glean something of
conditions inside the Ottoman Empire from debriefings of the evacuated
American consular officers, but these were nothing compared to William
Yale’s report. Even if three months out of date, it represented one of
the most detailed and reliable analyses of the situation in Syria to
emerge since the beginning of the war. On June 27, Yale strode into the
State, War and Navy Building (now the Old Executive Office Building)
next to the White House and dropped his report off at the offices of the
secretary of state himself, Robert Lansing. He followed up with a
personal letter to Lansing three days later.</p>
<p>After noting that “the disposition of Palestine will probably be one
of the big questions to be decided” in any postwar peace conference,
Yale suggested to the secretary that “if the United States of America is
to play her part in the solution of a problem so intricate and
important, her statesmen must have at their disposition reports of
unbiased men who had a first-hand knowledge of the country and its
people. It is for such service, whether it be in diplomatic or secret
service work, or relief work in Palestine, that I am prepared to resign
my present position with the Standard Oil Company of New York, and offer
my services to the Government of the United States.”</p>
<p>Perhaps his four years abroad left Yale blind to the complexity—to
some minds, the hypocrisy—of the new Wilson doctrine. Yes, the American
president fully intended to impose his notion of “a lasting peace” on
the warring world—that had been his price for entering the conflict—but,
reflective of his nation’s isolationist core, this was to be done while
involving the United States in as few long-term foreign entanglements as
possible. As a consequence, the very item Yale imagined to be his ace in
the hole, his expertise in enabling the United States to “play her part”
in the Middle East, was exactly the sort of thing the Wilson
administration hoped to avoid. Little surprise, then, that his overture
to Lansing was met with a resounding silence. The baffled oilman then
drew on an old Yale University contact to funnel his report to the head
of the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Department, only to meet the same
response.</p>
<p>Out of desperation, Yale played what must have seemed his very last
card. During his journey across Europe that spring, he had met with the
British military attaché to Switzerland and asked about the possibility
of joining on with British military intelligence. The attaché had not
been at all encouraging but, impressed by Yale’s breadth of knowledge on
the Middle East, suggested that if no other options presented themselves
once he returned home, Yale might call on the British ambassador to
Washington, Cecil Spring-Rice. With the military attaché’s note of
introduction in hand, Yale did so on the morning of July 9.</p>
<p>Serendipity had an odd way of intervening at crucial moments in
William Yale’s life, but never in quite so unlikely a way as on July 9.
In calling at the British embassy, Yale fully expected to be told the
ambassador was away or in a meeting, the same brush-off he’d received
from many other men far less busy or powerful over the previous month.
Instead, he was immediately ushered into Spring-Rice’s office.</p>
<p>“Where did you get your name?” the astonished ambassador asked by way
of greeting. “My first wife was a Yale, one of the last members of the
family in Wales!”</p>
<p>IT WAS LESS a battle than a massacre. As dawn of July 2 broke, the
Arab warriors circled through the hills surrounding the pass at Fuweila
in cautious search of the Turkish relief battalion. They found them in a
mountain close just below Fuweila known as Aba el Lissan, encamped and
still asleep along the banks of a stream. Incredibly, the Turkish
commander hadn’t taken the precaution of putting scouts on the
surrounding ridgelines, enabling the Arabs to quietly spread out among
the overhanging rocks and encircle their slumbering enemy. Once in
position, they began to snipe at the men trapped below.</p>
<p>It became a ferociously hot day, the hottest Lawrence could ever
remember in Arabia, and this greatly contributed to the desultory nature
of the fight. Despite the overwhelming advantage afforded by their
command of the heights, the Arab attackers found they could only lie
upon the rocks to shoot down at the enemy for a few moments at a time;
to linger any longer was to be burned through their thin robes, even to
have skin peeled from their bodies in swatches. Into the afternoon, the
erratic contest continued, the Turks below huddling in clefts along the
stream for protection, the Arabs above them hopping from one overlook to
the next in search of a clean shot.</p>
<p>By Lawrence’s account, it was a flippant comment on his part that
finally changed the battle’s tenor. Overcome by the heat, he had sought
refuge in the shade of a narrow gulley that also offered up a thin
rivulet of water. He was found there by Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>“Well, how is it with the Howeitat?” Auda teased, recalling
Lawrence’s past gibes at his tribesmen. “All talk and no work?”</p>
<p>Lawrence teased back, remarking that the Howeitat “shoot a lot and
hit a little.”</p>
<p>The remark seemed to enrage the chieftain. Flinging his headgear to
the ground, he charged back up the hill shouting for his men to
disengage and to take to their horses waiting below. Fearing his comment
had so offended Auda that the Howeitat were now leaving the fight,
Lawrence clambered up the slope to make amends. He found Auda standing
alone and glowering down at the enemy. “Get your camel if you want to
see the old man’s work,” Auda said.</p>
<p>Hurrying down to the protected hollow where the main camel-mounted
Arab force had waited all day to make their charge into Aba el Lissan,
Lawrence mounted his prized camel, Naama, and climbed to a nearby ridge.
He was just in time to see Auda and his fifty Howeitat horsemen charge
into the valley from an adjacent ridge at full gallop.</p>
<p>“As we watched,” Lawrence recalled in Seven Pillars, “two or three
[Howeitat] went down, but the rest thundered forward at marvelous speed,
and the Turkish infantry, huddled together under the cliff ready to cut
their desperate way out towards Maan in the first dusk, began to sway in
and out, and finally broke before the rush.”</p>
<p>The 350 camel troops were swiftly ordered forward as well. Among the
Turkish infantrymen, trapped and exhausted and now being charged by a
mounted enemy from two sides, any semblance of defense swiftly
collapsed. Suddenly, it was every man for himself, and in Aba el Lissan
that day, this simply meant death came quicker.</p>
<p>By his account, Lawrence missed much of it. Due both to Naama’s speed
and to his position at the fore of the camel charge, he had found
himself well out in front of his attacking comrades; Lawrence had
managed to get off just a few rounds with his pistol before Naama was
shot dead beneath him, sending him plummeting to a rough landing among
the rocks. When finally he gathered his wits about him, the battle was
already winding down. To his chagrin, he also discovered that Naama
hadn’t actually been killed by the Turks; judging by her fatal wound, a
point-blank shot to the back of the head, Lawrence had accidentally shot
her himself.</p>
<p>The carnage in Aba el Lissan was as vicious as it was one-sided. Just
two Arab fighters were killed in the attack, and a handful wounded. By
contrast, of the 550 Turkish soldiers trapped in the valley, perhaps 100
managed to make their escape in the direction of Maan, leaving some 160
captive and another 300 dead or dying. As Lawrence would allude in Seven
Pillars, some of these deaths were not the result of battle, but of the
Arabs’ thirst for vengeance for the killing of the Howeitat civilians
several days before.</p>
<p>There now came another test of Lawrence’s leadership. From his
interrogation of one of the prisoners, he learned that Maan itself was
very lightly garrisoned—and considerably more so now given the fate of
the Aba el Lissan relief column. As word of this spread among the Arab
fighters, a clamor went up for the force to double back and fall upon
the railhead town; Maan offered up a golden opportunity for plunder,
while the sad little port town of Aqaba offered nothing.</p>
<p>It was an absolutely pivotal moment, and Lawrence could feel the
objective that had borne him these past two months slipping away. Even
if the Arab fighters managed to take Maan, it would be a purely
temporary victory; the Turks would counterattack in force, and that
would see the path to Aqaba, now virtually clear, shut down forever.
What’s more, it would effectively mean the end of the fighting force he
and Auda and the other tribal chieftains had so patiently cobbled
together. By July 2, they had “no guns, no base nearer than Wejh, no
communications, no money even, for our gold was exhausted, and we were
issuing our own notes, promises to pay ‘when Aqaba is taken’ for daily
expenses.” Aqaba now had to be taken as a matter of survival.</p>
<p>With Auda’s help, Lawrence at last managed to turn the warriors away
from the easy promise of Maan. Both to put more distance between their
men and that temptation and out of fear of attack by Turks or marauding
rival tribes, they resolved to set out for Aqaba that same night. But
this decision raised another, troubling issue: what to do with the enemy
wounded? It was agreed that those able to walk would join their fellow
prisoners and, watched over by a rearguard detail, be herded along in
the direction of Aqaba. As for the twenty or so Turks too badly wounded
to travel, they were to be left behind, placed beside the stream so that
at least their imminent deaths might not come from thirst.</p>
<p>While the Arab warriors began breaking camp for the onward night
march, Lawrence set off alone down the valley to where the day’s
slaughter had taken place. He hoped to gather enough coats or blankets
off the Turkish corpses to make those being left by the streambank a bit
more comfortable in their last hours, but he found that scavenging
parties had already discovered the dead and stripped them naked. The
scene, and Lawrence’s reaction to it, was to lead to one of the eeriest
passages in his autobiography:</p>
<p>The dead men looked wonderfully beautiful. The night was shining
gently down, softening them into new ivory. Turks were white-skinned on
their clothed parts, much whiter than the Arabs, and these soldiers had
been very young. Close round them lapped the dark wormwood, now heavy
with dew, in which the ends of the moonbeams sparkled like sea-spray.
The corpses seemed flung so pitifully on the ground, huddled anyhow in
low heaps. Surely if straightened they would be comfortable at last. So
I put them all in order, one by one, very wearied myself, and longing to
be of these quiet ones, not of the restless, noisy, aching mob up the
valley, quarrelling over their plunder, boasting of their speed and
strength to endure God knew how many toils and pains of this sort.</p>
<p>At last turning away from the dead, Lawrence rejoined the warriors
for the march on to Aqaba, now just forty miles away over the
mountains.</p>
<p>IN LAWRENCE’S TWO-MONTH absence, the Anglo-Arab military campaign in
the Hejaz continued in its usual fitful rhythm. Through May and June,
British demolition parties, usually accompanied by bands of Arab
warriors, made their periodic forays inland to do damage to the Hejaz
Railway. Their reports noted the occasional success—a blown bridge here,
a wrecked train there—but even more frequently complained of the
unreliability and lack of discipline among their Arab confederates.
Higher up the chain of command, British commanders remained exercised
about galvanizing the rebels to finally carry out their blocking
operation in the El Ula region northwest of Medina, but the sense of
imperative for the scheme was gradually withering under the evidence
that the Turks had no intention of leaving Medina. Faisal, now enjoying
the title of Commander of Arab Forces, had instead set his sights on his
march into Syria. Among those British officers privy to Faisal’s
fantastically ambitious blueprint for that advance—this from a man who
had barely budged from Wejh in four months—enthusiasm tended to be
restrained. “It is somewhat difficult to examine in any detail Sherif
Faisal’s plan,” one such officer reported at the end of May, “which is
characterized throughout by a remarkable freedom from conventional
restrictions in regard to time, space, arrangements for supply, or the
disposition and possible action of the enemy.”</p>
<p>Looking over the reports from the field, Gilbert Clayton in Cairo
filed a weekly status report on the Hejaz situation to the director of
military intelligence in London. Throughout May and June, these
memoranda were usually prefaced by the comment that very little had
changed since the previous one. But if all remained static in the
Hejaz—“satisfactory” was the word Clayton preferred—by late June, his
spies inside Syria were reporting a rather dramatic uptick in rebel
activity. By the time Clayton penned his report of July 5, these reports
were coming in from all across southern Syria: “active hostility” by the
Howeitat tribe near Maan; an attack on the Turkish garrison at Fuweila;
a raid on a Turkish camel-grazing party near Shobek; a sabotage
operation on the rail line outside Bir el Shedia.</p>
<p>“It is not known what are the present whereabouts of Captain
Lawrence, who left for the Maan area or Jebel Druze area some time ago,”
Clayton noted in that same report, “but lately an Arab rumor came into
Wejh to the effect that he and the small party with him had blown up a
large iron bridge south of Maan. These activities in the Maan area are
probably the outcome of Captain Lawrence’s arrival in that
neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Gilbert Clayton had it only partly right. What he couldn’t have known
was that Lawrence and his Arab confederates were actually responsible
for nearly all the actions in southern Syria he reported on that day,
just as they had been for most of the other attacks across the breadth
of Syria, some of them over three hundred miles behind enemy lines, that
had taken place over the previous month. He also couldn’t have known
that on July 5, Lawrence was not in the neighborhood of Maan, but rather
sixty miles to the southwest, negotiating the surrender of the Turkish
garrison in Aqaba.</p>
<p>After the massacre at Aba el Lissan, Lawrence and the Arab warriors
had raced toward the sea. As they crested the mountains and descended
the Wadi Itm toward Aqaba, the fighters passed one empty Turkish
blockhouse and trenchline after another, final proof of the brilliance
of Lawrence’s contrarian scheme. “The enemy had never imagined attack
from the interior,” he noted, “and of all their great works, not one
trench or post faced inland.”</p>
<p>In contrast to its dramatic rendering in David Lean’s movie, the fall
of Aqaba was somewhat anticlimactic. After a tense two-day standoff,
with both sides running desperately short of food, the Turkish commander
finally accepted that his situation was hopeless and surrendered the
port on July 6 with barely a shot fired. With the white flag raised, the
rebels raced into Aqaba on their camels and splashed into the sea in
celebration of their audacious victory.</p>
<p>But for Lawrence, the long ordeal was not quite over or the triumph
secure. There were now nearly twelve hundred men crowded into Aqaba,
some six hundred Arab fighters and an equal number of Turkish prisoners,
but desperately little food. He also knew that it would only be a matter
of time—and likely a short time—before the Turks in the Syrian interior
mustered a sufficient force to march over the mountains to retake Aqaba.
Such an advance might be slowed by manning the mountain guardhouses with
rebel units, but as Lawrence knew from past bad experience, relying on
Arab tribesmen to hold defensive positions, even formidable ones, was
never a safe bet. Just as vital as Aqaba’s fall, then, was to now get
word of it to the British so that supplies and reinforcements could be
rushed in.</p>
<p>The next day, and accompanied by just eight warriors, Lawrence set
out in the direction of Egypt, hoping to cross the 150 miles of desert
that lay between Aqaba and the British lines at the Suez before it was
too late.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-14-hubris">Chapter 14 Hubris</h4>
<p>Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the Arabs do it
tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to
help them, not to win it for them. Actually also, under the very odd
conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as perhaps
you think it is.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, ADVICE TO BRITISH OFFICERS, IN TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES,
AUGUST 1917</p>
<p>On the morning of July 10, 1917, Gilbert Clayton was seeing to one of
his drearier tasks, composing the weekly status report on the Arabian
war theater for the military intelligence director in London. As he had
done many times in recent months with only the slightest variation, he
prefaced the memo with the comment that “nothing has occurred of great
importance in the Hejaz since I last wrote,” before providing a quick
rundown of battle plans yet to be acted upon, small successes that
should have been greater, opportunities squandered.</p>
<p>Shortly after the report went out the door to the telegraph office, a
tiny figure in a dirty Arab robe wandered into Clayton’s office. Taking
his visitor for a local favor seeker, or perhaps an enterprising beggar
boy, the distracted general was in the process of shooing him out the
door when he noticed the familiar lopsided grin, the piercing light blue
eyes. It was T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Sitting his emaciated subordinate down, Clayton urgently pressed for
details on all that had transpired in the two months since Lawrence had
set off into the Arabian interior and vanished from view. The general
then dashed off an excited postscript to his weekly status report:
“Since writing the above and just as I send it to the mail, Captain
Lawrence has arrived after a journey through enemy country which is
little short of marvelous.” There followed a brief synopsis of the
capture of Aqaba, as well as of Lawrence’s intelligence-gathering
mission across Syria. “I have not yet been able to discuss his journey
with Lawrence as he has only just arrived and is somewhat exhausted by
1,300 miles on a camel in the last 30 days.… I think, however, that you
would be interested in the above brief sketch of a very remarkable
performance, calling for a display of courage, resource and endurance
which is conspicuous even in these days when gallant deeds are of daily
occurrence.”</p>
<p>Ironically, some of Lawrence’s greatest travails in reaching Cairo
had come in trying to navigate the British lines. The previous
afternoon, he and his small band of escorts had reached the eastern bank
of the Suez Canal, having made the 150-mile trek from Aqaba in an
astounding forty-nine hours, only to find the British guardposts there
abandoned (due to a cholera outbreak, Lawrence would later learn).
Finding an operable field telephone, he repeatedly called over to the
army’s ferry transport office on the opposite shore to request a boat,
only to be just as repeatedly hung up on. At last he reached a logistics
officer who knew him from Wejh, and a launch was sent.</p>
<p>In that first moment of safety, two months to the day since he had
set out from Wejh, Lawrence’s strength finally gave out, and it was all
he could do to drag himself to the Port Suez officers’ billet at the
Sinai Hotel. “After conquering its first hostile impression of me and my
dress,” he wrote, “[the hotel] produced the hot baths and the cold
drinks (six of them) and the dinner and bed of my dreams.”</p>
<p>His ordeal continued into the next day. Barefoot and still clad in
his ragged Arab robes, Lawrence was repeatedly stopped and questioned by
military police during his train journey to Cairo. His luck turned on
the train platform at Ismailia when he caught the notice of a senior
British naval officer who recognized him from his Red Sea crossings. It
was a fortunate meeting; the military high command in Cairo was quickly
alerted to what had happened in Aqaba, and by that afternoon the first
supplies and reinforcements were being rushed to the rebel-held
port.</p>
<p>On the Ismailia platform, Lawrence also learned of a major
development that had occurred in his absence. Following his defeat at
the Second Battle of Gaza, Archibald Murray had been removed from
command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. His replacement, a cavalry
general named Edmund Allenby, had arrived in Cairo less than two weeks
earlier. Initially, Lawrence greeted this news with dismay. It had taken
months of painstaking ministrations by himself and Clayton and everyone
else at the Arab Bureau to even partially win over the prickly Murray to
the idea of supporting the Arab Revolt. Now they would have to start
over from scratch, and Lawrence envisioned many more months lost in the
education of Edmund Allenby.</p>
<p>But upon reaching Cairo, Lawrence was to discover something else.
Already, word of his exploits was spreading through the British military
command, and to electrifying effect. Coming on the heels of the defeat
at Gaza, the stasis in the Hejaz, and the ceaselessly grim news from
Europe—another Allied offensive on the Western Front had failed, the
French army was mutinying, the Russian government was collapsing—here
was some genuinely cheering news, a sterling example of British daring
and pluck. Even beyond the fantastic manner in which it had been
achieved, Aqaba’s capture meant the Arab war effort had abruptly
leapfrogged 250 miles to the north and made the task of carrying that
effort into Syria dramatically simpler.</p>
<p>Curiously, though, it was Lawrence’s subsidiary feat, his long and
perilous journey through the Syrian heartland, that seemed to most
capture the imagination and accolades of his countrymen. Part of it was
surely the romantic image it conjured, one with many antecedents in
British military lore: the lone adventurer (never mind that Lawrence had
actually been accompanied by two scouts) sneaking behind enemy lines in
disguise and with a bounty on his head, his clandestine meetings with
would-be conspirators, the threat of betrayal and tortured death
stalking his every turn. Certainly it was this aspect that most inspired
Reginald Wingate in recommending Lawrence be awarded the Victoria Cross,
Britain’s highest military decoration. As Wingate pointed out, what
“considerably enhanced the gallantry” of Lawrence’s exploit was that it
had been conducted amid “a highly venal population” even with a £5,000
Turkish reward on his head.</p>
<p>Lawrence, as noted, minimized the importance of that trek. Indeed,
the few details he ever provided on it were in an obliquely worded
four-page report he wrote immediately upon his arrival in Cairo. Ever
the strategist, however, he evidently realized that in the official
reaction to his Syrian adventure, he had been handed a powerful
instrument to further his goals. He deftly wielded that instrument when
brought before the new EEF commander, General Edmund Allenby.</p>
<p>Given the elaborate decorum that existed within the British military
of 1917, it’s hard to imagine a more incongruous meeting than the one
that took place at the Cairo General Headquarters on the afternoon of
July 12. Nicknamed “Bloody Bull” for his explosive temper, Edmund
Allenby was a towering man with the physique of a boxer gone slightly to
seed, an intimidating presence even when not clad in his general’s dress
uniform. On the opposite side of his desk sat the wraithlike Captain T.
E. Lawrence, perhaps 135 pounds when healthy but now reduced to less
than a hundred by the rigors of his desert exploits, dressed in a white
Arab robe and turban and, by his own account (though it seems
improbable), shoeless; Lawrence’s uniform had been destroyed by moths
during his long absence from Cairo, so he would claim, and he had yet to
find time to replace it.</p>
<p>Lawrence surely knew something of Allenby’s war record, including
that it was a somewhat checkered one. During the British withdrawal at
the battle of Mons in August 1914, Allenby had ordered his cavalry
regiment to stand their ground before a much larger advancing German
force, thereby enabling the rest of the beleaguered army to make an
orderly retreat. Coincidentally, it was during that same battle that
Archibald Murray, then the chief of the Imperial General Staff and
monitoring the British retreat from a central command post, had fainted
away from the tension. Much more recently, however, Allenby’s star had
been eclipsed at the battle of Arras, where he was criticized for being
slow to take advantage of breaches in the German line to drive his men
forward—a relative point, perhaps, in an engagement that saw the British
advance less than two miles at the cost of 150,000 casualties.</p>
<p>As with Murray, then, Allenby’s transfer to Egypt was meant as a
demotion, but where this had induced a kind of crippling caution in
Murray, Lawrence sensed it might spur something very different in
Allenby. In the general’s office that afternoon, he proceeded to paint a
wondrously ambitious portrait of what the Arab rebels now stood poised
to achieve. So long as Aqaba was quickly bolstered as the chief staging
point, he explained, the Arabs could at last take their fight into the
Syrian heartland. And not in any small way; in Lawrence’s telling, there
was now the opportunity to set the whole region aflame.</p>
<p>To complement the threadbare report on his Syrian spying mission,
Lawrence had made a little hand-drawn map to illustrate his plan to the
general. It depicted no fewer than seven prospective Arab forces
attacking the Turks across the length of Syria, as far west as the
Lebanon coast and as far north as the cities of Homs and Hama, one
hundred miles above Damascus. While he cautioned in his cover note that
“there is little hope of things working out just as planned,” if even
some aspects of Lawrence’s blueprint came to fruition, the bulk of
Turkish forces deployed across northern and eastern Syria would find
themselves stranded, unable to advance or even to easily retreat.</p>
<p>There was a catch, though. For this grand Arab uprising to succeed,
Lawrence told Allenby, it required a simultaneous British army
breakthrough in southern Palestine. Once that had been achieved, the two
forces could move north in lethal tandem, the Arab irregulars shutting
down the Hejaz Railway and marooning the Turks in their garrison towns
in eastern Syria, while the British army, their inland flank protected
by the Arabs’ actions, advanced up the western coastal shelf. In
Lawrence’s plotting, even the quick capture of Damascus and Jerusalem
were within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>But there was another small catch. The fighters who would serve as
the crucial linchpin to this Arab strike force, the Bedouin of eastern
Syria, traditionally trekked farther east in autumn in search of better
forage for their camels, effectively leaving the war theater. To make
use of these essential warriors, Lawrence explained, action would have
to commence no later than mid-September, or in about two months’
time.</p>
<p>It’s not altogether clear how much of this extravagant vision
Lawrence himself actually believed. Even if flushed by his recent
triumph at Aqaba, he was surely still too much the pragmatist to imagine
that all the inertia and tribal squabbling that forever shadowed the
Arab Revolt would somehow now melt away. He’d also undoubtedly had
enough experience with the British military to know that haste was not
its strong suit. Most likely, in putting forward his grandiose scheme he
saw the chance to win over the new British commander in chief—unschooled
in the sluggish pace with which events moved in the region, eager to
redeem his soldier’s reputation in the wake of Arras—to his own vision
of a joint Arab-British liberation of Syria. It was a vision Allenby
would have to embrace or reject quickly, of course, since Lawrence had
also set a ticking clock.</p>
<p>But if there was an element of bluff in all this, who could possibly
catch him out? T. E. Lawrence was now a celebrity in Cairo, the magical
manager of Arab tribes, as well as the only British officer to have
personally taken the pulse of their potential fifth columnists inside
Syria. Even if he knew those prospective collaborators were nowhere near
ready to rise up in two months, it’s not as if anyone else knew.
Instead, so long as the almost inevitable delay tripped up the British
timetable, his secret knowledge of Arab unpreparedness would remain
safe, and in the meantime he would have forged an alliance—and a mutual
dependency—that couldn’t be broken.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence all but admitted to this game: “Allenby
could not make out how much [of me] was genuine performer and how much
charlatan. The problem was working behind his eyes, and I left him
unhelped to solve it.”</p>
<p>And it was a performance that succeeded brilliantly. At the end of
their meeting, the general raised his chin and announced, “Well, I will
do for you what I can.”</p>
<p>If he kept it low-key with Lawrence, Allenby let his enthusiasm be
known to his superiors, including General William Robertson, chief of
the Imperial General Staff and the overall coordinator of the British
war effort. “The advantages offered by Arab co-operation on lines
proposed by Captain Lawrence,” he cabled Robertson on July 19, “are, in
my opinion, of such importance that no effort should be spared to reap
full benefit therefrom.… If successfully carried out, such a movement,
in conjunction with [British] offensive operations in Palestine, may
cause a collapse of the Turkish campaigns in the Hejaz and in Syria and
produce far-reaching results, both political as well as military.” So
vital did Allenby view the scheme that he passed on Lawrence’s concern
of losing the eastern Bedouin to their autumn grazing grounds should
there be a delay. “I therefore ought to be prepared to undertake such
operations as may be possible with the force at my disposal by the
middle of September.”</p>
<p>Even Robertson, a committed “Westerner” loath to entertain ambitious
plans in the East, was quickly sold on the idea; at the culmination of a
flurry of cables between Cairo and London that July, he promised to
immediately send Allenby as many as fifty thousand more troops for his
upcoming Palestine offensive. It all marked an astounding turnaround in
fortunes for the Arab Revolt. Just two months earlier, the rebels had
been regarded as little more than a sideshow nuisance by Archibald
Murray; now they were setting the timetable for the next British
offensive in Palestine.</p>
<p>But the newly strengthened Arab-British alliance also signaled a
change on the political front, one that General Allenby may not have
appreciated or cared about, but that T. E. Lawrence most certainly did.
Until recently, British planners had been pondering strategies to
minimize the Arab rebels’ role in Syria out of deference to their French
allies. Now, by signing on to Allenby’s plan—which really meant
Lawrence’s plan—the British military was setting on a course that
completely ignored French concerns, and would eventually cast the whole
framework of Sykes-Picot in doubt.</p>
<p>That was all a bit in the future, however, and in the interim, praise
for Lawrence’s exploits continued to come in from all quarters. Though
he was found to be ineligible to receive the Victoria Cross (one of its
stipulations is that the heroic deed must be observed by a fellow
Briton), he was soon promoted to major, as well as named a Companion of
the Order of the Bath, one of the highest levels in the British
chivalric system available to junior military officers.</p>
<p>Amid his newfound celebrity, in early August Lawrence was asked to
jot down his insights on working with Arabs for those British officers
being sent for duty in the Hejaz, to share his secrets of success in a
realm where so many others had come to crushing despair. The result was
a short treatise he entitled Twenty-Seven Articles. Some of his
recommendations were commonsense, while others must have seemed rather
exotic to his pupils. “A slave brought up in the Hejaz is the best
servant,” he advised, “but there are rules against British subjects
owning them, so they will have to be lent to you. In any case, take with
you an Ageyli [tribesman] or two when you go up country. They are the
most efficient couriers in Arabia, and understand camels.”</p>
<p>Above all, Lawrence counseled his readers to shuck their English
ways, to so totally immerse themselves in the local environment as to
know its “families, clans and tribes, friends and enemies, wells, hills
and roads.”</p>
<p>Within the parochial British military culture of 1917, Twenty-Seven
Articles had the force of revelation—and indeed, the tract continues to
have profound influence today. Amid the American military “surge” in
Iraq in 2006, the U.S. commander in chief, General David Petraeus,
ordered his senior officers to read Twenty-Seven Articles so that they
might gain clues on winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people.
Presumably skipped over was Lawrence’s opening admonition that his
advice applied strictly to Bedouin—about 2 percent of the Iraqi
population—and that interacting with Arab townspeople “require[s]
totally different treatment.”</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN AND Captain Ian Smith had never been close. From
their first meeting, Smith, the EMSIB (Eastern Mediterranean Special
Intelligence Bureau) liaison to the spy ships operating out of Port
Said, had made little attempt to hide his low regard for the Jewish spy
ring in Palestine. From that inauspicious beginning, Smith—“always an
idiot” in the agronomist’s estimation—had seemed to go out of his way to
slight Aaronsohn and his confederates in ways large and small, as if it
were the British who were doing a great favor to the Jewish spies rather
than the reverse.</p>
<p>No amount of past insults, however, quite prepared Aaronsohn for
those of July 1. Evidently irritated that Aaronsohn had complained of
his shabby treatment to an officer in the Arab Bureau, Smith acidly told
the NILI ringleader that his spies in Palestine “are no good. The work
can be done much better by others.”</p>
<p>Making the episode especially galling was that it came at a time when
the British were piling on NILI’s workload at every turn—and in ways
that went far beyond intelligence gathering. In the wake of the
sacking-of-Jaffa story in May, an international relief effort had gone
up to raise funds for its Jewish victims. To the obvious question of how
such funds might reach the needy within Palestine, someone in the
British hierarchy hit on the just as obvious answer: the NILI network.
And so long as the NILI operatives were distributing relief funds across
Palestine, why not propaganda materials as well? And how about in their
spare time, they also carry out sabotage attacks? At the beginning of
June, plans had been drawn up to smuggle explosives ashore at Athlit so
that a NILI team might blow up a crucial railroad bridge in the Jordan
valley; toward that goal, Aaronsohn’s chief lieutenant in Egypt, Liova
Schneersohn, was now undergoing demolition training at a British army
testing ground on the Cairo outskirts.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn had reluctantly agreed to each of these new demands put on
his organization, seeing it as the price to be paid for British favor,
but it made the insult from Ian Smith simply too much to bear. As he
informed his allies in the Arab Bureau the day after that confrontation,
since EMSIB apparently now had other and better operatives in Palestine,
“I no longer had the right to endanger my people in continuing the
work.” Therefore, he was shutting down NILI.</p>
<p>Because it wasn’t as if Aaronsohn lacked other reasons to feel
grossly underappreciated that summer. At the core was the continuing
mystery of just what his status was in Cairo, of where he and his
organization fit into the larger scheme of things. In his meetings with
Mark Sykes in April and May, Aaronsohn had learned that the British
politician was working closely with two leaders of the English Zionist
Federation, Chaim Weizmann and Nahum Sokolow, in London. In fact, during
his time in Cairo, Sykes had urged Weizmann to come out to Egypt to
spearhead the Zionist effort there but, in lieu of that, to appoint
Aaronsohn as his local “representative.” Aaronsohn had gone along with
the plan out of deference to Sykes, even though he was quite at odds
with the milder brand of Zionism of Weizmann and Sokolow—but then he had
received absolutely no communication from either man since. So vague had
his status remained, and so futile his own efforts to receive guidance
from the Zionist Federation that, just days before his run-in with
Smith, he had asked Gilbert Clayton to take the matter up with Mark
Sykes. Even this, though, had yielded nothing.</p>
<p>Thus out of the loop, Aaronsohn also remained quite unaware that his
cherished Zionist cause was actually making great strides in London—and
largely through the efforts of the tireless if uncommunicative Chaim
Weizmann.</p>
<p>The campaign to prod the British government into a public declaration
in support of a Jewish homeland had recently undergone a major overhaul.
At one time, Weizmann had stressed the effect that such a declaration
would have on American Zionists, causing them to add their influential
voice to those calling for an end to American neutrality and
intervention on the side of the Entente; obviously, that argument had
lost much of its luster with the United States’ entry into the war. Also
headed toward oblivion that summer was the parallel contention that such
a declaration would spur Russian Jews to rally to the prowar government
of Alexander Kerensky; with the chaos in Russia deepening by the day,
Kerensky’s problems were now far beyond the point where Jewish support
might make much difference. In early June, though, Weizmann had found a
potent new argument courtesy of the Central Powers.</p>
<p>As Weizmann explained in a June 12 meeting with Robert Cecil, the
British assistant secretary of state for foreign affairs, for many
months he had been hearing rumors that the German government was trying
to enlist leaders of the German Jewish community to act as
intermediaries for a prospective peace deal. Weizmann had long dismissed
these rumors, but recently they had gained great credence; in fact, he
told Cecil, he had heard that German Jewish leaders were now actively
considering such a role, provided the kaiser’s regime met their demand
for a Jewish state in Palestine. This the German government was
evidently contemplating, judging by the recent and unprecedented spate
of articles in the German press in support of a Jewish homeland.</p>
<p>To the degree that any of this was substantially true, the message
was plain—that if the British didn’t play the Jewish-homeland card soon,
the Germans surely would—and Robert Cecil was a quick pupil. The day
after his meeting with Weizmann, he sent a confidential memorandum to
his superior, Lord Charles Hardinge. “There can be no doubt that a
complete change of front on the part of the German Government has taken
place,” Cecil wrote, “and that orders have been given to treat Zionism
as an important political factor in the policy of the Central Empires.”
The purpose of that change, in his estimation, was to influence the
opinion of international Jewry “and to utilize it in the interests of
German propaganda against the Entente.”</p>
<p>In hopes of averting this potentially calamitous outcome, Cecil
explained, his recent visitor had put forward a helpful suggestion.
“Dr. Weizmann concluded by urging very strongly that it was desirable
from every point of view that His Majesty’s Government should give an
open expression of their sympathy with, and support of, Zionist aims,
and should publicly recognize the justice of Jewish claims on
Palestine.”</p>
<p>With alarm bells over a possible German-sponsored Jewish state
reverberating through the British Foreign Office that June, this was a
suggestion that an increasing number of senior British officials were
ready to heed.</p>
<p>If all this remained unknown to Aaron Aaronsohn, it was also unknown
to those Arab Bureau officials who scrambled to put out the fire sparked
by Captain Smith’s comments of July 1. Instead, they were just trying to
save Britain’s most important spy network in Palestine from shutting
down.</p>
<p>As part of a renewed effort to show Aaronsohn respect, Smith was
forced to apologize for his comments, and the agronomist was soon given
an audience with the new EEF commander in chief, Edmund Allenby. Their
meeting took place on the morning of July 17, just five days after
Allenby’s discussions with T. E. Lawrence. In a leisurely conversation,
Aaronsohn filled in the general on a variety of topics regarding
Palestine, everything from its agricultural conditions to the fighting
abilities of its Turkish garrison, and even provided character sketches
of Djemal Pasha—“very much inclined to plot, and clever at it”—and the
German commander in Syria. “The [commander in chief] listened with
interest,” Aaronsohn noted, “and questioned me intelligently, ‘to the
point.’ He made an excellent impression on me.”</p>
<p>In the afterglow of that meeting with Allenby, Aaronsohn may have
felt he had at long last “arrived” with the British in Cairo. Then
again, he’d felt that at various other times over the preceding seven
months. The problem was, with the British forever striving to keep all
options open, reluctant to ever give anyone either a positive or
negative straight answer, there really was no such thing as having
“arrived,” the hearty embrace avoided for the cautious pat on the back.
This was compounded in Aaronsohn’s case by the new machinations in
London over a possible declaration of support for a Jewish homeland, a
generalized anxiety within much of the British government over where
that might lead. As a result, the goal was to keep Aaronsohn happy but
in limbo, to maintain that fine balance between encouraging his efforts
and remaining circumspect as to their ultimate reward.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the British could rely on a man with considerable skill
at such things, Reginald Wingate. “I gather,” Wingate wrote a senior
Foreign Office diplomat on July 23 upon learning of the government’s
latest tentative overture to the British Zionists, “that the matter is
by no means decided, and that you wish me to keep Aaronsohn satisfied
without telling him anything very definite. This has been done.”</p>
<p>ON JULY 16, the captain of the British troopship HMS Dufferin was
told to stand by at Port Suez in order to transport an important
official down the Red Sea coast to Jeddah. The next morning, the ship’s
crew caught first sight of their distinguished guest when
twenty-eight-year-old T. E. Lawrence sauntered up the gangway. It was a
long way from the day, eight months earlier, when Lawrence had walked up
another naval ship’s gangway in Yenbo harbor only to be soundly rebuked
for his unkempt uniform and insolent manner.</p>
<p>One measure of how greatly his stock had risen in the wake of Aqaba
was the mission he was undertaking to Jeddah. In his discussions with
Generals Allenby and Clayton, Lawrence had emphatically—and perhaps
quite exaggeratedly—told of the abiding esteem with which the Syrians
held Faisal ibn Hussein; they saw him as the Arabs’ overall military
commander, he had explained, and it was under his banner that they would
rise in revolt. As with most everything else Lawrence stated in Cairo
that July, his superiors had little way of either confirming or refuting
this assertion, it simply becoming part of the narrative of what lay in
store once the battle for Syria was joined.</p>
<p>From this, Lawrence saw the opening to go one better: to fully
coordinate the joint Arab-British offensive in Syria—and, not
coincidentally, to permanently weld the fortunes of the Arab cause to
those of the British army—why not place Faisal and his forces directly
under Allenby’s military command? Lawrence had gained quick approval of
this idea in Cairo, but there remained a huge potential roadblock: King
Hussein. With his reputation for irascibility, along with his jealous
efforts to control the rebel movement, it seemed highly likely the
Hejazi king would reject the suggestion out of hand. Then again, he
might just listen to Faisal’s most trusted British advisor and the “hero
of Aqaba.” In short order, Lawrence found himself aboard the Dufferin
bound for a meeting with Hussein.</p>
<p>But the mission to Jeddah was only the most visible sign of the young
captain’s new and profound influence over British policy in the region.
Behind the scenes, Lawrence had already laid the groundwork for a
dramatic restructuring of the British military presence in Arabia, one
tailored to his specifications. As he rather immodestly explained in
Seven Pillars, he had put the argument to Gilbert Clayton thus: “Aqaba
had been taken on my plan by my effort. There was much more I felt
inclined to do—and capable of doing—if he thought I had earned the right
to be my own master.”</p>
<p>During their week together in Cairo, Clayton had agreed to most of
his subordinate’s suggestions. With the war in the Hejaz essentially
over—though the Turks still controlled Medina, they had now lost all
offensive capability—the long and futile campaign to block the Hejaz
Railway at El Ula could be brought to a merciful end. For the same
reason, the main rebel base at Wejh was now to be virtually shuttered,
with both its Arab forces and British logistics officers brought up to
Aqaba. Assuming the role of de facto general, Lawrence plotted out the
future deployments of those Arab armies to remain in the Hejaz, and
worked up a list of the British army personnel to be retained,
reassigned, or let go. Clayton had drawn the line, however, on
Lawrence’s bold proposal that he be given overall command at Aqaba,
pointing out that having a junior officer order about his superiors just
wasn’t the British way. Instead, they jointly settled on one of Cyril
Wilson’s deputies, Major Pierce Joyce, for the Aqaba post, an easygoing
and unambitious officer unlikely to get in Lawrence’s way.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, more exemplified Lawrence’s changed status than his
reunion with Colonel Wilson in Jeddah. After Lawrence’s first visit to
Arabia eight months earlier, Wilson had angrily commented to Clayton
that the arrogant junior officer “wants kicking, and kicking hard,” and
had tried to prevent his return to Arabia on even a temporary basis. By
July 1917, however, the colonel had come to see Lawrence, now in the
process of being promoted to major, as both an ally and probably the
most important British field officer operating in the Hejaz.</p>
<p>Just prior to Lawrence’s arrival in Jeddah, Wilson had received a
memorandum from Clayton outlining the sweeping personnel changes being
contemplated for the region, pointedly noting that he had come to these
ideas in consultation with Captain Lawrence. This detail made one
feature of the memorandum all the more striking: pushed aside was
Stewart Newcombe, still the officially designated head of the British
military mission to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>Far more than to anyone else, it was to Stewart Newcombe that
Lawrence owed his position in the Middle East. But in Lawrence’s
cold-eyed view, war was war, and whatever sense of gratitude he felt for
his mentor couldn’t stand in the way of its conduct. Newcombe had
endured a contentious tenure in the Hejaz, never quite adjusting to the
Arabs’ mysterious approach to war-making, and in myriad reports had
complained bitterly of their lack of discipline and reliability. As
Lawrence explained to Cyril Wilson upon his arrival in Jeddah, it had
been decided that Newcombe would now be taken off the front and
relegated to a rearguard role, effectively demoted. A surprised Wilson
quickly acquiesced.</p>
<p>That same evening, Lawrence and Wilson met with King Hussein. It was
Lawrence’s first audience with the king, and he found him both charming
and personable. That assessment may have been helped by Hussein’s quick
acceptance of the proposal to place Faisal and his army under Allenby’s
direct command.</p>
<p>A very different matter arose the following morning when Hussein
summoned Lawrence to his Jeddah palace for a private meeting. With
uncharacteristic bluntness, the king brought the conversation to a topic
that had become something of a personal obsession: his meetings back in
May with Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>While the controversy over what had or had not been agreed to at
those meetings continued to find small echo in certain branches of the
British government, its import had been diminished by the pace and
urgency of other events. Surely adding to its waning effect was the
polite tone adopted by dissident eyewitnesses like Cyril Wilson, with
his couched language alluding to “possible misunderstandings.” It was
not at all the tone Lawrence would adopt, and what had taken Wilson many
discursive pages to relate, he did in less than one: “The main points,”
he cabled Clayton after his second meeting with Hussein, “are that he
had altogether refused to permit any French annexation of Beirut and the
Lebanon.… He is extremely pleased to have trapped M. Picot into the
admission that France will be satisfied in Syria with the [same]
position Great Britain desires in Iraq.… In conclusion the Sherif
remarked on the shortness and informality of conversations, the absence
of written documents and the fact that the only change in the situation
caused by the meeting was the French renunciation of the ideas of
annexation, permanent occupation, or suzerainty of any part of
Syria.”</p>
<p>Whether due to its brevity or the new celebrity of its author, within
days that report was finding its way onto the desks of the seniormost
officials of the British government. It had the effect of instantly
resurrecting the debate over Britain’s web of conflicting promises in
the Middle East—as well as Mark Sykes’s singular role in spinning that
web.</p>
<p>But Lawrence’s mission to Arabia was not quite done. While he was
still in Jeddah, word came from Cairo that according to a reliable
informant, Lawrence’s chief partner in the Aqaba campaign, Auda Abu
Tayi, was now secretly negotiating with the Turks to switch sides.
Lawrence’s immediate reaction was defensive—he suggested that perhaps it
was actually a ruse on Auda’s part to lull the Turks into inaction—but
he evidently had less confidence in that theory than he let on. Within
hours, he was on board a ship bound for Aqaba and a face-to-face
confrontation with Auda.</p>
<p>Trekking inland on a fast camel, Lawrence found the Howeitat
chieftain along with his two chief lieutenants, both also named by the
informant as prospective traitors, in a tent outside the village of
Guweira. For many hours they passed as reunited friends, until Lawrence
invited Auda and one of the other conspirators to join him for a walk.
Once they were alone, he challenged the two men with what he had been
told. “They were anxious to know how I had learnt of their secret
dealings,” Lawrence recounted, “and how much more I knew. We were on a
slippery ledge.”</p>
<p>Indeed, a ledge that conceivably could have been fatal for Lawrence.
Instead, drawing on his extraordinary skill in knowing how to converse
with Arabs in even these minefield circumstances, he put on an elaborate
performance—sympathy, flattery, and ridicule all fused into one—to first
disarm and then win the men back to the rebel side. Once returned to
Aqaba, Lawrence cabled Cairo that the business with Auda amounted to
little more than a misunderstanding, that all was now “absolutely
satisfactory.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence later admitted, he frequently shaved the facts in what he
passed on to Cairo about the Arab Revolt and its leaders, but suggested
it was really to everyone’s benefit. “Since [British] Egypt kept us
alive by stinting herself, we must reduce impolitic truth to keep her
confident and ourselves a legend. The crowd wanted book-heroes.”</p>
<p>And like any good performer, Lawrence gave the crowd what they
wanted.</p>
<p>ONCE THE MATTER of his Welsh ancestry got sorted out, William Yale
and the British ambassador to the United States settled down to
business.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Yale had rather low expectations of what Cecil
Spring-Rice might be able to provide him by way of job prospects. After
all, the British already had an extensive intelligence apparatus devoted
to the Middle East. But William Yale was canny enough to realize he had
something to offer that very few others did: an oil connection. Over the
previous four years, he had canvassed vast stretches of Palestine
looking for potential oil deposits for Standard Oil of New York. Through
office memoranda, he also knew where else across the Ottoman Empire his
company had sought or obtained concessions. In the postwar world, who
was to know if the occupying power in these regions would recognize the
Socony concessions? Certainly if that occupying power had already
publicly stated that future oil exploration and extraction was to be
regarded as a matter of national security—a power like Great Britain,
for instance—it seemed entirely possible it might toss out Socony’s
claims in favor of development by one of its own national syndicates. If
so, having someone on board who had seen the preexisting maps and
geological surveys could save a lot of time and trouble.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, Ambassador Spring-Rice was sufficiently
intrigued by his young visitor to ask that Yale drop off at the embassy
a copy of his report on conditions in Syria. This Yale did the very next
day, along with a two-page addendum noting the location of all principal
German military installations in Jerusalem, with those locations further
pinpointed on a map.</p>
<p>If Yale’s Syria report had failed to interest American officials, the
British reaction was quite different. The ambassador thought enough of
it to rush a copy directly to Foreign Secretary Balfour, which drew an
equally swift response from London; provided William Yale could obtain a
draft waiver from the U.S. War Department, the secret cable instructed,
Spring-Rice was to offer the twenty-nine-year-old oilman a lieutenant’s
commission in the British army, “with view to subsequent employment as
intelligence officer to Egypt. His information is sure to be of value.
Please take necessary action and wire result.”</p>
<p>The required War Department waiver should have been little more than
a formality now that the United States and Great Britain were wartime
allies. But it was not, it turned out, such a formality in William
Yale’s case. That’s because after languishing apparently unread at the
State Department for over a month, his Syria report had finally landed
on the desk of someone intrigued by its contents. That person was a man
named Leland Harrison, the special assistant to the secretary of state,
but that title didn’t begin to convey the actual power he wielded.</p>
<p>The thirty-four-year-old Harrison enjoyed a similar Yankee blueblood
background to Yale’s. After being educated at Eton and Harvard, he’d
joined the U.S. diplomatic corps and held a succession of posts at some
of the most important American overseas missions. His swift rise had
been cemented when Secretary of State Robert Lansing brought him to
Washington in 1915, where Harrison quickly gained a reputation as
Lansing’s most trusted lieutenant.</p>
<p>Both fierce Anglophiles, Lansing and Harrison had shared a deepening
disenchantment with Woodrow Wilson’s commitment to American neutrality
in the war. Another source of Lansing’s favor for Harrison was
undoubtedly his subordinate’s profound sense of discretion. One State
Department staffer would say of Leland Harrison that “he was positively
the most mysterious and secret man I have ever known.… He was almost a
human sphinx, and when he did talk, his voice was so low that I had to
strain my ears to catch the words.”</p>
<p>Where this became significant was that prior to American entry in the
war, Lansing had acted as the leader of a virtual shadow government
within the Wilson administration, a secretive cabal that quietly
maneuvered for intervention on the side of the Entente. Just how
secretive was indicated by Lansing’s creation of something called the
Bureau of Secret Intelligence in 1916. In hopes of uncovering evidence
of German treachery that would make the argument for intervention
irresistible, the bureau’s special agents spied on diplomats and
businessmen from the Central Powers residing in the United States, an
activity that obviously undercut Wilson’s public vow of impartiality and
would have infuriated other branches of government had they been told.
But they weren’t told. Instead, Lansing had used State Department
discretionary funds to create the bureau, enabling it to operate without
the approval or even the knowledge of Congress or most of the rest of
Wilson’s cabinet. Pulling Leland Harrison from the Latin American
division, Lansing had placed his young protégé in charge of this
“extra-legal” new office, tasked to overseeing “the collection and
examination of all information of a secret nature.”</p>
<p>While this element of conspiracy within the State Department had been
somewhat mooted by American entry into the war, it provided Harrison
with a precedent when, upon reading William Yale’s Syria report, it
occurred to him that it might be very useful for the United States to
have its own source of intelligence in the Middle East. The snag was
that such an enterprise fell out of the purview of the existing domestic
intelligence agencies and, with the United States not at war with
Turkey, beyond the scope of the army intelligence division as well. The
solution was to bring Yale in under the umbrella of the Bureau of Secret
Intelligence; to that end, he was summoned to the State Department in
early August.</p>
<p>At that meeting, Harrison put forward a remarkable proposition: Yale
would return to the Middle East as a “special agent” for the State
Department. At a salary of ,000 a year plus expenses, his mission would
be to monitor and report on whatever was happening that might be of
interest to the American government—or, perhaps more accurately, of
interest to Leland Harrison. From his base in Cairo, Yale would send
weekly dispatches through the American embassy’s diplomatic pouch to
Washington, where they would be routed exclusively to Harrison’s
attention. Unsurprisingly, Yale quickly accepted the offer. On August
14, and under Secretary Lansing’s signature, he was named the State
Department’s special agent for the Middle East.</p>
<p>After a brief trip home to see his family in Alder Creek, on August
29 Yale boarded USS New York in New York harbor for another
transatlantic crossing. En route to Cairo, he was to stop off in London
and Paris to take a sounding of those British and French officials most
directly involved with Middle Eastern affairs. As Harrison cabled to the
American ambassador in London, “[Yale] is to keep us informed of the
Near Eastern situation and, should the occasion arise, may be sent on
trips for special investigation work. He is favorably known to the
British authorities, who offered him a commission. Please do what you
can to put him in touch with the right authorities.”</p>
<p>In the second decade of the twenty-first century, it is difficult to
fully grasp the utter provincialism of the United States as it entered
World War I in 1917. Not only was its standing army one-twentieth the
size of Germany’s, but it was dwarfed in size by even some of Europe’s
smallest actors, including Romania, Bulgaria, and Portugal. In 1917, the
entire Washington headquarters staff of the State Department fit into
one wing of a six-story building adjacent to the White House, a
structure it shared with the command staff of both the Departments of
Navy and Army.</p>
<p>Those examples notwithstanding, perhaps more remarkable is this: for
most of the remainder of the war, the American intelligence mission in
the Middle East—a mission that would include the analysis of battlefield
strategies and regional political currents, the interviewing of future
heads of state, and the gathering of secrets against governments both
friendly and hostile—would be conducted by a single twenty-nine-year-old
man with no military, diplomatic, or intelligence training. To these
deficiencies, William Yale could actually think of a few more: “I lacked
a historical knowledge of the background of the problems I was studying.
I had no philosophy of history, no method of interpretation, and very
little understanding of the fundamental nature and function of the
[regional] economic and social system.”</p>
<p>Not that any of this caused him undue anxiety. An exemplar of the
American can-do spirit, William Yale also held to the belief, quite
common among his countrymen, that ignorance and lack of experience could
actually bestow an advantage, might serve as the wellspring for
“originality and boldness.” If so, he promised to be a formidable force
in the Middle East.</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN AND T. E. Lawrence had first crossed paths on
February 1, 1917. That encounter made little impression on either man,
save a quick note in Aaronsohn’s diary that he’d found Captain “Laurens”
knowledgeable but conceited. Their next meeting, on August 12 of that
year, was one both would remember for a long time. In the interim, each
had become a personality to reckon with in Cairo, Lawrence for his
exploits in Arabia, Aaronsohn for his contribution to the British war
effort through his NILI spy ring. Of course, both had also gained
reputations for being outspoken in their views on the future of the
Middle East. Their talk at the Arab Bureau offices quickly degenerated
into mutual hostility.</p>
<p>Lawrence may have been alerted to the tone their conversation would
take by an incendiary paper Aaronsohn had penned a few weeks earlier. By
August 1917, with the specter of official British support for a Jewish
homeland in Palestine inching closer to reality, even the more radical
leaders of international Zionism had adopted the soothing language of
conciliation: whatever the future political framework in Palestine, they
stressed, the Jews would live in peaceful coexistence with their Arab
and Christian neighbors, the fight against Turkish oppression a cause
they all shared.</p>
<p>No such placating words were forthcoming from Aaron Aaronsohn. In his
position paper, soon to be excerpted in the Arab Bulletin, the
agronomist inveighed against the “squalid, superstitious, ignorant”
Palestinian serfs known as the fellaheen, freely acknowledged that at
times they had been forcibly removed from the land by Jewish
settlers—and would be again if he had his way. As to the accusation that
Jews kept themselves apart from their Arab neighbors, Aaronsohn not only
confirmed the charge, but wrote, “We are glad of it. From national,
cultural, educational, technical and mere hygienic points of view, this
policy has had to be strictly adhered to; otherwise the whole Jewish
Renaissance movement would fail.” As a cautionary tale, he pointed to
the alleged educational shortcomings in the assimilationist Jewish
settlement of Rosh Pinah, which he attributed to the “unavoidably
degrading effect that continued contact with the uneducated fellaheen
had on the Jewish youth.”</p>
<p>Surely most upsetting to the mainstream Zionist leaders and their
British supporters, however, were his comments on the Arab Revolt. In
paving the way for official support for a Jewish homeland, and in
anticipation of Arab resistance to the idea, British officials from Mark
Sykes on down had been energetically coaxing the Zionists to voice their
solidarity with the Arab cause. Chaim Weizmann had led this chorus from
London, but in Cairo, no one had given Aaronsohn the playsheet.</p>
<p>“[The Palestinian Jews] have no interest, and still less confidence,
in the Arab Revolt,” he wrote. “They are not in a position to take up
arms against the Turk, and they would hesitate to join the Arabs, even
if they were in a position to do it. So far as we know the Arabs, the
man among them who will withstand a bribe is still to be born.… In order
to help to defeat the Turk, [the Jews] will readily join the British
forces, but it is doubtful whether they will ever trust the Arabs.”</p>
<p>Hardly words to delight T. E. Lawrence, the self-appointed defender
of that revolt in the West, but at their meeting, Aaronsohn seemed
almost to go out of his way to provoke Lawrence further. The ultimate
future of Palestine, he explained, was not a British protectorate in
which a Jewish minority would be protected, but a de facto Jewish
nation. This would be achieved both politically and economically, with
Zionists simply buying up all the land between Gaza and Haifa and
forcing the fellaheen from the land. Lawrence’s response was equally
blunt. The Jews in Palestine had two choices, he told the agronomist:
either coexist with the Arab majority or see their throats cut.</p>
<p>“It was an interview without any evidence of friendliness,” Aaronsohn
noted in his diary with considerable understatement. “Lawrence had too
much success at too early an age. He has a very high estimation of
himself. He is lecturing me on our colonies, on the spirit of the
people, on the feelings of the Arabs, and we would do well in being
assimilated by them, etc. While listening to him I could almost imagine
that I was attending the lecture of a Prussian scientific anti-Semite
expressing himself in English.… He is openly against us. He must be of
missionary stock.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence was only the latest addition to the roster of people
irritating Aaron Aaronsohn just then. Despite the peacemaking efforts of
various British officers, a three-month-old feud with the anti-Zionist
Jewish Committee in Alexandria raged unabated, and the agronomist was
still being virtually ignored by Chaim Weizmann’s Zionist Federation in
London. So infuriated was Aaronsohn at the lack of respect being shown
him from London that just days after his encounter with Lawrence, he
wrote two long letters to Weizmann complaining of his treatment and,
once again, threatening to disband NILI. When he repeated this threat to
Reginald Wingate, it sparked another worried cable to the Foreign
Office.</p>
<p>“It might help matters if Mr. Aaronsohn were to receive without delay
the support for which he has asked,” Wingate wrote Secretary Balfour on
August 20. “An additional reason for not alienating him, and one which
may perhaps appeal to you, is that the military authorities attach
importance to retaining the use of the organization which he has created
in Palestine. He is in a position to destroy this organization, and
there is little doubt that, in his present frame of mind, he will be
tempted to do so unless some concession is made to his views. How far
his difference with the Zionists in England is due to questions of
principle and how far to wounded susceptibilities I am unable to
tell.”</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, while riding his bicycle through the streets of
Cairo one evening, Aaronsohn came up with a new idea: if the British
Zionists wouldn’t clarify matters with him, then he would go to Britain
and force them to. When he put this plan to his British handlers, they
readily concurred, no doubt relieved at the prospect of placing some
distance between the NILI network and its potentially destructive
creator. On September 13, Aaronsohn left Egypt bound for Marseilles.</p>
<p>But consumed by his myriad squabbles, as well as his need for
recognition, it seems to have only fitfully occurred to the scientist
that he was engaging in extremely risky behavior for someone who headed
a clandestine spy ring. He also appeared to have quite forgotten the
cover story designed to keep his family and coconspirators in Palestine
safe, that as far as Ottoman authorities knew, he’d been lifted off a
boat en route to the United States and was presumably cooling his heels
in a British internment camp. Instead, Aaronsohn’s name had now appeared
in an array of official reports circulating between Cairo, London, and
Paris. Worse, through both his dealings with British officials in Cairo
and his continuing spat with the Jewish Committee in Alexandria, an
ever-growing circle of people in Egypt were aware of NILI’s existence.
Even if none of these would deliberately harm the spy ring, how much
longer before word of it finally reached Berlin or Constantinople?</p>
<p>Certainly, Aaron Aaronsohn’s own family hadn’t helped matters. During
his New York exile, his younger brother Alex had written of his escape
from Turkey in an article for the Atlantic Monthly magazine; by August
1917, that article had been converted into a book, With the Turks in
Palestine, which was now available in Cairo bookstores. Among Jewish
settlements in Palestine, it was now an open secret that some sort of
intelligence network was operating out of Athlit—and Sarah Aaronsohn’s
very conspicuous travels in the region gave many a good idea of exactly
who was involved. Indeed, in July a delegation of Palestinian Jewish
leaders had called on Sarah to demand she immediately stop her
“activities,” an ultimatum she had angrily spurned.</p>
<p>But if only because they were supposed to be professionals at such
things, by far the greatest blame for the situation attached to those
British officials tasked to manage the spy ring. Their cavalier manner
bordered on the criminal. It was they who had come up with the idea of
using the NILI network to distribute both British propaganda materials
and relief funds for Jewish refugees, and while Aaronsohn had ultimately
vetoed the first proposal, he had relented on the latter. As a result,
when the first installment of aid went ashore at Athlit in mid-July in
the form of gold sovereign coins, NILI operatives were no longer just
exporters of intelligence but now importers of contraband gold, doubling
their risk of detection. Most astounding of all, the British had
repeatedly violated the most basic rule of running spies, which is to
make sure one cell has no contact with another. By August 1917, the
once-small fleet of spy ships operating out of Port Said had been
steadily whittled down to the point where a single vessel, the Managem,
was now conducting all missions. Out of necessity, this meant the
Managem was transporting operatives of Britain’s different intelligence
networks in Palestine on the same voyages, neatly ensuring that if one
spy was caught or defected, he or she was in a position to unmask
everyone else.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it all spoke to the same personality flaw that had
plagued the British in their war against the Turks from the outset, one
shared in this instance by the Aaronsohns: hubris, contempt for one’s
enemy. And just as had occurred so many times since 1914, they would all
soon have reason to regret it. On September 13, the same day Aaronsohn
set sail for Europe, Turkish authorities in Palestine caught their first
NILI spy.</p>
<p>IT WAS THE SORT of store-clerk work Lawrence enjoyed the least. By
late August, the process of converting Aqaba from a sleepy fishing port
into the forward staging ground for the Arab Revolt was well under way,
with a daily stream of British ships disgorging mountains of supplies.
Those ships also brought in thousands of fighters—Muslim recruits from
Egypt, Arab warriors from Faisal’s old base at Wejh—where they were
joined by a surge of new tribal recruits coming in from the surrounding
mountains. Since his return from Cairo on August 17, Lawrence’s days in
Aqaba had been spent dealing with the inevitable logistical foul-ups,
and in trying to help bring some degree of order to the place. But
perhaps such mundane duties helped distract from the larger problems at
hand, for already the heady optimism and accelerated plans sparked by
Aqaba’s capture six weeks earlier had become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>As might have been foreseen, General Allenby’s ambitious goal of
launching his Palestine offensive by mid-September had been pushed back
due to a host of delays in getting his army fully reequipped; planners
in Cairo were now talking of a launch date no earlier than late October.
Which maybe was just as well from Lawrence’s perspective, since the
Arabs were woefully unprepared too.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lawrence was living the old proverb of success
having a thousand fathers. Exacerbated by its proximity to Cairo, Aqaba
was now plagued by that most noxious of bureaucratic envoys, the
advisor, each determined to prove his worth by coming up with his own
list of dubious recommendations. In late August, a newly arrived
intelligence officer, taken aback by the lack of professionalism among
the Arab troops, urged on Cairo the immediate dispatch of the Imperial
Camel Corps, an elite British camel cavalry force. Lawrence was forced
to take time from his other duties to undermine the plan. “One squabble
between a [Camel Corps] trooper and an Arab,” he wrote Clayton on August
27, “or an incident with Bedouin women, would bring on general
hostilities.” Politic enough to concede some of the intelligence
officer’s other points, he closed on a dismissive note. “I don’t think
that any [report] of the Arab situation will be of much use to you
unless its author can see for himself the difference between a national
rising and a [military] campaign.”</p>
<p>Coincidentally, when Clayton received that note, he was already
considering doing a little field research of his own. On September 1, he
arrived in Aqaba from Cairo, marking his first visit to the war front
that had consumed his energies for over a year.</p>
<p>As always, it seemed the general had something of a hidden agenda to
his visit. Over a month earlier, he’d received a curious letter from
Mark Sykes in London. Clayton had seen no reason to share its contents
with Lawrence during his subordinate’s recent stay in Cairo—the two had
been in daily contact at the Arab Bureau throughout the second week of
August—but for reasons known only to him, he had brought the letter to
Aqaba for that purpose.</p>
<p>When Sykes had returned to London from his Middle East sojourn that
summer, it had been to a radically altered political landscape. As
Entente leaders were learning to their shock and dismay, President
Woodrow Wilson’s talk about making “the world safe for democracy” had
been more than just sanctimonious rhetoric; the price for American
intervention in the war was to be self-determination for oppressed
peoples, and the annulment of the maze of secret pacts between
governments—in effect, the beginning of the end of the imperial era. It
was a measure of just how desperate Great Britain and France had
become—between them, they had suffered some five million casualties in
three years of war—that formerly voraciously acquisitive politicians in
both capitals were now scrambling to learn the strange vocabulary of
“non-annexation” and “autonomy.”</p>
<p>Few were more adroit at executing this about-face than Mark Sykes.
With astonishing speed, the politician had refashioned himself an
enlightened postimperial statesman, a champion of self-determination.
The best course in the Middle East, Sykes now argued, was for both
Britain and France to renounce any imperialist claims whatsoever, since
it was clear, as he informed Gilbert Clayton in his letter of July 22,
that “colonialism is madness.” In its place, what he envisioned was a
kind of political finishing school administered by the Western powers, a
period in which the benighted races of the Middle East might be
instructed in Western values and systems and then sent on their merry
way. Lest anyone find all this jarring coming from the coauthor of the
most infamous imperial pact in modern history, Sykes had a handy
solution; as he advised the War Cabinet in mid-July, henceforth all
references to the Sykes-Picot Agreement should be discarded in favor of
“the Anglo-French-Arab Agreement.”</p>
<p>Not everyone was impressed by Sykes’s new incarnation. Over time, a
growing consensus in the Foreign Office leadership held that Britain had
cut a very bad deal in Sykes-Picot, and blame had naturally affixed to
its poorly supervised coauthor; as War Cabinet member George Curzon
commented, “[Sykes] appears to think that the way to get rid of
suspicion is always to recognize what the other party claims and to give
up, when asked, our claims.” Confidence in Sykes was further eroded by
the continuing controversy over his and Picot’s purported accord with
King Hussein in May, and by his leadership role in promulgating the
sacking-of-Jaffa story, now viewed by many as a backdoor scheme to prod
the government into fully supporting the Zionist camp. Matters came to a
head in early July when Arthur Nicolson, the under secretary of state
for foreign affairs, had sought to unravel for the War Cabinet precisely
what other commitments the government had made in the Middle East over
the previous two years, and how those might square with its promises to
King Hussein. All but calling Sykes a liar—“it is a little difficult to
be sure that the papers in the Department represent the whole of what
actually passed”—Nicolson urged that “the opinion of Sir Mark Sykes
should be invited before the matter is pursued further, as he alone will
be able to state with authority how far any evasion or modification of
our engagements to [Hussein] are likely to be resented by Arab
opinion.”</p>
<p>In the face of such criticism, Sykes assumed a petulant, defensive
crouch. Curiously, he also focused on a particular junior British army
officer as a source of his troubles: Captain T. E. Lawrence. In a
self-pitying note to Secretary Balfour’s secretary on July 20, Sykes
presented his two years of toil on Middle Eastern affairs as an exercise
in thankless self-sacrifice. “Hitherto the work has been fairly
successful, but I have had to contend, as you know, with many
difficulties: the prejudices of the past both British and French, the
mutual suspicions and susceptibilities of out-of-date minds, the
anti-British policy of Brémond, the anti-French attitude of
Lawrence.”</p>
<p>But perhaps this focus wasn’t so curious after all. Only a handful of
people grasped the full tapestry of contradictions and half-truths Sykes
had woven in the Middle East, but most of these—men like Gilbert Clayton
and Reginald Wingate—were too much servants of the system to ever fully
confront him; if things did blow up, they would keep their grumbling to
a minimum and look for ways to muddle through. But then there was
Lawrence, the non–club member who wouldn’t hesitate in shaming Sykes if
given the platform—and in the wake of his triumph at Aqaba, he
increasingly had that platform.</p>
<p>In addition, Lawrence now had the ability to seriously damage the
diplomatic framework Sykes had spent two years building. Imperfect
though it was, it protected British interests in the region while giving
a little bit of something to most everyone else. Now, with Lawrence’s de
facto military alliance with Allenby joined to his long-standing
determination to wrest Syria from France, and quite suddenly the little
captain was elevated from nuisance to formidable threat. It was
apparently in hopes of neutralizing that threat, through both flattery
and thinly veiled condescension, that Sykes devoted a portion of his
July 22 letter to Clayton. It was that same letter Clayton brought with
him to Aqaba to show Lawrence.</p>
<p>“Lawrence’s move is splendid and I want him knighted,” Sykes had
written in reference to Aqaba’s capture. “Tell him [that] now that he is
a great man he must behave as such and be broad in his views. Ten years’
tutelage under the Entente and the Arabs will be a nation. Complete
independence [now] means Persia, poverty and chaos. Let him consider
this, as he hopes for the people he is fighting for.”</p>
<p>Combined with all he knew of Sykes’s past machinations, and coming so
close on the heels of his confrontation with Aaronsohn in Cairo,
Lawrence could not stomach the letter’s patronizing tone. Perhaps also
it touched a chord of ego; if not a “great man,” Lawrence was now most
certainly his own, and he wasn’t about to be dictated to by Mark Sykes.
In a scathing seven-page letter to the politician, couched as an earnest
request for guidance, he methodically held up each of Sykes’s schemes to
scrutiny before exposing their gaping holes: “What have you promised the
Zionists, and what is their programme? I saw Aaronsohn in Cairo, and he
said at once the Jews intended to acquire the land-rights of all
Palestine from Gaza to Haifa, and have practical autonomy within. Is
this acquisition to be by fair purchase or by forced sale and
expropriation? … Do the Jews propose the complete expulsion of the Arab
peasantry, or their reduction to a day-labourer class?”</p>
<p>He then turned to the matter of French “help” to the Arabs in
developing Syria, the canard that Sykes had tried to foist on Hussein at
Jeddah. “The Arabs can put their revolt through without French help, and
therefore are disinclined to pay a price only to be made known to them
in the future.… The Sherif will succeed, given time and a continuance of
our help, [and] he will take by his own efforts (don’t assume virtue for
the mules and cartridges we supply him; the hands and heads are his) the
sphere we allotted to our foreign-advised ‘independent Syria,’ and will
expect to keep it without imposed foreign advisors. As he takes this
sphere of his, he will also take parts of the other spheres not properly
allotted to an Arab state [under Sykes-Picot]. His title to them will be
a fairly strong one—that of conquest by means of the local
inhabitants—and what are the two Powers going to do about it?”</p>
<p>At the letter’s close, Lawrence assumed a slightly more conciliatory
tone, recognizing the realpolitik reality that “we may have to sell our
small friends in pay for our big friends,” but pointed out that,
contrary to Sykes’s perpetually sunny pronouncements, “we are in rather
a hole. Please tell me what, in your opinion, are the actual measures by
which we will find a way out?”</p>
<p>The letter was perhaps the most searing indictment ever penned of
Sykes’s actions in the Middle East, but it was one the politician would
never see. On September 7, with Clayton having returned to Cairo from
his Aqaba visit, Lawrence routed the letter through his office for
onward transmission to London; upon reading its contents, however,
Clayton thought better of it. As he explained in a note to Lawrence, he
didn’t wish to provide Sykes with anything that “may raise him to
activity,” especially now that the increasingly discredited Sykes-Picot
Agreement seemed headed for oblivion. “It is in fact dead,” Clayton
wrote, “and if we wait quietly, this fact will soon be realized. It was
never a very workable instrument and it is now almost a lifeless
monument.”</p>
<p>In this appraisal, Gilbert Clayton couldn’t have been more wrong, but
Lawrence wasn’t in a position to argue the point. In what was becoming
something of a pattern between them, by the time Clayton sent his note,
Lawrence had already set off for the interior and a new strike against
the Turks.</p>
<p>WILLIAM YALE FIRST sensed something amiss when, checking into
London’s Savoy Hotel on September 7, he noticed the abundance of
“painted ladies” circulating through its lobby. As he sadly noted in his
diary the following day, it appeared the once-grand old hotel had become
“to all intents and purposes a house of assignation.”</p>
<p>The puritanical Yale had little time to dwell on the squalidness of
his surroundings, however, for he was to stay very busy in London.
Through Leland Harrison’s helpful cable to the American ambassador, the
new special agent gained quick entrée to many of the top British
officials involved in Middle Eastern affairs. Amid these meetings, Yale
was flattered to discover that his Syria report had been hailed as one
of the most incisive documents to emerge from that vital corner of enemy
territory, circulated and studied at some of the highest levels of the
British political and military leadership; he was happy to meet with
debriefers from various intelligence units, and to provide them with
whatever further details he could.</p>
<p>Rather soon, though, Yale’s attention turned away from trying to gain
a broad view of the Middle Eastern situation—from his own experience in
the region, he knew that any truly useful insights were likely to be
found in Cairo—and toward a particular aspect of it: the British
government’s growing flirtation with the Jewish Zionist community.</p>
<p>His curiosity was piqued by a peculiar story circulating in British
newspapers that told of an unnamed Jewish chemist who had supposedly
given the government “certain secrets” pertaining to the manufacture of
explosives. “This Jewish chemist,” Yale wrote in his diary on September
12, “who, when asked what reward he desired, replied that personally he
wished nothing, but that he was a Jew and that he wished that in a Peace
Conference the Allies would give special consideration to the question
of the Jews in Palestine.” According to the newspaper accounts, the
British government had secretly promised the scientist to do so.</p>
<p>Even if Yale didn’t yet have the name of the chemist—it was Chaim
Weizmann, of course—what he found intriguing was that the government had
made no public attempt to deny or diminish the account, which strongly
suggested it was true. Over his next week in London, the new American
intelligence operative sounded out an array of officials on just what
British policy might be in regard to the Jews in Palestine, only to
receive an array of conflicting responses.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for this, Yale concluded, was that there seemed
little agreement among British Jews over just what arrangement they
hoped for. Some of those in the Zionist community argued for nothing
less than a Jewish nation in Palestine, others merely for a guarantee of
increased immigration, while some anti-Zionist leaders fiercely
denounced the movement as a dangerous new tool for Jewish
marginalization, a handy weapon for anti-Semites to question the loyalty
of Jews to the nations of their birth. In trying to sort through the
controversy, it seemed plain to Yale that the British government was
contemplating some sort of overture in connection with the Jews and
Palestine, but that precisely what that would be had not yet been
decided.</p>
<p>After two weeks, Yale felt he had gleaned all he could in London, and
was anxious to get on to Cairo. First, though, there was someone he very
much wanted to talk with in Paris, a Zionist leader whose name had come
up often in recent days, and who had just arrived in France from Egypt:
Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>IT IS AN enduring myth about the battle for Arabia: the fantasy of
the “clean war,” of Arab warriors, stirred after centuries of crushing
subjugation, rallying to the cry of freedom; of those same warriors
bravely charging down sand dunes to fall upon their hapless and cruel
oppressors.</p>
<p>Contrary to the charge of his detractors, T. E. Lawrence actually
played a minimal role in creating this myth. Far more it stemmed from
the need of a shattered postwar public to find even a trace of grandeur
in a war so utterly grotesque. There was not a lot of material to work
with from the Western Front, where countless thousands had simply
vanished in puffs, atomized by artillery, or been entombed forever
beneath its mud. By contrast, Arabia was all berobed warriors and
charging camels and flapping banners, a touch of medieval pageantry amid
the inglorious slaughter. That image and the need for it dimmed under
the weight of a second, even more horrific world war, but then David
Lean’s 1962 film resurrected it for a new generation.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s greatest contribution to the literature of war was that,
despite his open advocacy for the Arab cause, fidelity to the truth
compelled him to try to convey what it was really like. As he made clear
in Seven Pillars, while many Arabs joined the fight out of a sincere
desire to be rid of the Turks, sincerity was helped along by British
gold and the prospect of bountiful loot. On the battlefield, the rebels’
enemies were not just Turks but fellow Arabs, warriors from tribes that
had missed out on the British gold or taken that of the Turks, clans
with whom they had blood feuds or who were freelancers out scouting for
loot themselves.</p>
<p>Nor did that battlefield bear much resemblance to the scenery of
popular imagination. Instead of the picturesque expanses of sand dunes
often associated with the region, much of the Arabian and Syrian deserts
consist of dreary gravel plains and barren stone mountains, similar in
many respects to the less picturesque corners of Utah or Arizona. In
traversing this terrain, Lawrence and his Arab allies survived on a diet
of mutton, camel meat, and bread in good times, raw flour in the less
good. These meals were chased down with water often drawn from brackish
springs or algae-covered ponds, or from wells contaminated by the Turks
with rotting animal corpses. Seeking out shade to escape the withering
heat of midday often meant encountering that strange and cruel
phenomenon common to deserts the world over, great swarms of biting
black flies.</p>
<p>But of all the components to the myth, perhaps the most erroneous is
the notion of a “clean war.” On this most severe of landscapes, the
badly wounded on both sides were often left behind to die, the lucky
ones dispatched with a bullet to the head. Subsisting on whatever was
left over once their captors had their fill, prisoners died in droves
from hunger and thirst—when the victors bothered to take prisoners at
all. And in contrast to the clearly delineated death zones of the
Western Front, this was a battlefield on which combatants and civilians
were intermingled, where the completely innocent could suddenly find
themselves caught amid the bullets and knives.</p>
<p>It was early on the afternoon of September 19 when the ten-car train
rounded the bend from the south. Lawrence waited until the train’s
second engine had started over the short bridge, and then he detonated
his fifty-pound gelignite mine. Instantly, a plume of black smoke shot a
hundred feet into the air and billowed out to either side at least as
far. Once the report of the explosion and the screech of ripping metal
died away, there came a brief, eerie silence. Then the killing began in
earnest.</p>
<p>To complement the Arab warriors he intended to recruit along the way,
Lawrence had brought along from Aqaba two fellow Western officers—a
Briton he nicknamed “Stokes” for the Stokes trench mortar he carried, an
Australian nicknamed “Lewis” for the two Lewis machine guns in his
care—and they had pre-positioned themselves and their weapons on a rocky
ledge just three hundred yards from the bridge. As the smoke cleared, it
was revealed that only the train’s engines and lead carriage had fallen
into the culvert below the collapsed bridge, the remaining seven
carriages sitting upright and immobile on the tracks. Rows of Turkish
soldiers sat on the roofs of these carriages, and they were now mowed
down by the Lewis machine guns, “swept off the top like bales of
cotton.”</p>
<p>Starting to recover from their shock, a number of Turks scrambled for
the relative shelter of the culvert under the bridge. The first mortar
that Stokes fired at them went a little wide. After he adjusted the
weapon’s elevating screw, his second shell dropped directly in their
midst. The sudden carnage there, Lawrence noted in his official report,
caused the survivors to panic and race “towards some rough country 200
yards N.E. of the line. On their way there the Lewis gun[s] killed all
but about twenty of them.”</p>
<p>With Turkish resistance rapidly collapsing, the Arab fighters—just
over one hundred men—dashed forward to begin their looting. Anxious to
check on the damage to the engines, Lawrence scrambled down from his
perch to join them.</p>
<p>Reaching the train, he discovered it had been carrying a mixed cargo,
that along with the soldiers, several of its carriages were filled with
civilians. Some of these were the families of Turkish officers returning
to Damascus, others simple refugees. “To one side stood thirty or forty
hysterical women,” Lawrence recounted in Seven Pillars, “unveiled,
tearing their clothes and hair, shrieking themselves distracted. The
Arabs, without regard to them, went on wrecking [their] household goods,
looting their absolute fill.” Spotting Lawrence, the women fell on him
to beg for mercy. They were soon joined by their husbands, who “seized
my feet in a very agony of terror of instant death. A Turk so broken
down was a nasty spectacle; I kicked them off as well as I could with
bare feet, and finally broke free.”</p>
<p>On his way to the train engines, Lawrence checked on the one carriage
that had tumbled into the ravine. He found it had been a medical car,
the wounded and ill laid out on stretchers for the journey, but all were
now bunched in a bloody tangled heap at the bottom of the upended wagon.
“One of those yet alive deliriously cried out the word ‘typhus.’ So I
wedged shut the door and left them there, alone.”</p>
<p>He was only slightly more helpful to a group of Austrian military
advisors who had been on the train, and “who appealed to me quietly in
Turkish for quarter.” Intent on finishing up his demolition work,
Lawrence left them under an Arab guard; moments later, the Austrians
were killed, “all but two or three,” as the result of some dispute.</p>
<p>In his official report on the engagement below Mudowarra, Lawrence
estimated the number of Turkish dead at about seventy, at a cost of one
Arab fighter. He lamented that amid the pandemonium, he’d had to rush
his vandalism to the first train engine, and feared it was still capable
of repair. “The conditions were not helpful to good work.” He made no
mention of dead civilians in the report, although considering the
fusillade of bullets fired into the unarmored train in the first few
minutes of the battle, their number must have been considerable.
Similarly, he offered no explanation for the discrepancy between the
ninety Turkish soldiers taken prisoner and the sixty-eight ultimately
delivered to Aqaba.</p>
<p>For most who experience it, combat triggers a contradictory duel of
emotions: horror at its gruesomeness, exhilaration at its unmitigated
thrill. Reconciling these dueling reactions is probably more difficult
for the soldier than for the civilian given the element of braggadocio
that exists within his fraternity, and he is likely to be more candid
about the complexity of his feelings—to the degree that candor is even
possible—with a nonsoldier.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Aqaba from Mudowarra, Lawrence wrote to a military
colleague, Walter Stirling. In the letter, he recounted the train attack
in gleeful detail, noting the “beautiful shots” of the Stokes gun that
had killed twelve Turks on the spot, and how his own share of the loot
was “a superfine red Baluch prayer-rug.” He continued, “I hope this
sounds the fun it is. The only pity is the sweat to work [the Arabs] up,
and the wild scramble while it lasts. It’s the most amateurish,
Buffalo-Billy sort of performance, and the only people who do it well
are the Bedouin.”</p>
<p>The day before, September 24, a seemingly very different Lawrence had
written to his old friend Edward Leeds at the Ashmolean Museum in
Oxford: “I hope when the nightmare ends that I will wake up and become
alive again. This killing and killing of Turks is horrible. When you
charge in at the finish and find them all over the place in bits, and
still alive many of them, and you know that you have done hundreds in
the same way before, and must do hundreds more if you can.”</p>
<p>If Lawrence was already having difficulty reconciling this psychic
divide, it was about to get worse.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-15-to-the-flame">Chapter 15 To the Flame</h4>
<p>I only hope and trust TEL will get back safe. He is out and up

C[Cross]—if not—well, I don’t care to think about it!</p>
<p>DAVID HOGARTH TO HIS WIFE, NOVEMBER 11, 1917</p>
<p>They had met several times before in Palestine. Back then, Aaron
Aaronsohn had been an eminent scientist, a pioneer in the field of
agronomy, and William Yale the regional representative of the Standard
Oil Company of New York. Now, in late September 1917, both had added
considerably to their résumés, Aaronsohn a leader in the international
Zionist movement, Yale a special agent for the U.S. State Department.
But what Yale didn’t know about Aaron Aaronsohn—at least not yet—was
that he was also the mastermind of one of the most extensive spy rings
in the Middle East. And what Aaronsohn didn’t know about William Yale
was that, his vague job title aside, he too was essentially a spy. As
might be expected, all this lent their meeting in Paris on September 25
a certain circumspect quality.</p>
<p>Since arriving in the French capital four days earlier, Aaronsohn had
been trying to get a sense of where matters stood with the Zionist cause
before moving on to London. To that end, he’d first sought out his old
benefactor, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who he knew was playing a key
behind-the-scenes role in the ongoing discussions with the French and
British governments. He’d come away disappointed.</p>
<p>“He listened very interestedly all the time I spoke to him,”
Aaronsohn would inform his brother Alex in a letter, “and asked me
questions which I answered, but he would not let me touch on certain
subjects, did not wish to speak about them, so that it was impossible
for me to learn from him what I wished to know.… He feels, as we all do,
that if Great Britain would only rule over our land, we could obtain
great things, but as nothing certain is known [yet], he cannot allow
himself to speak.”</p>
<p>He’d had far better luck when Mark Sykes showed up in town. The two
had a long meeting on September 23, followed by another the next
morning. “He told me everything,” Aaronsohn told his brother, “and
showed me what a lot of enemies we have. Most of the opponents [are]
from among our own people, and that is dangerous to our
organization.”</p>
<p>Evidently, one reason Sykes had sought out Aaronsohn in Paris was to
play peacemaker. The British War Cabinet was once again taking up the
debate over supporting a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and it was vital
that the leading Zionists speak with one voice. That meant ending the
ongoing friction between Aaronsohn and Chaim Weizmann’s English Zionist
Federation; as Sykes explained, Aaronsohn’s angry letters to Weizmann of
mid-September had been “like a thorn in the latter’s eye.”</p>
<p>Which frankly suited Aaronsohn just fine. As he haughtily told his
brother, “Mark Sykes begs me to make peace with them and wants me to
promise not to quarrel. He says that I should listen to Weizmann and to
Sokolow. I told him that I was not going to London to quarrel, only to
tell them their mistakes and to show them the way to do things properly.
If they accept, well and good; if not I will go my own way.”</p>
<p>William Yale may have gleaned something of this rift within the
Zionist camp from his own interviews in London, but it likely was mere
background noise to the more overt struggle between the British Zionists
and anti-Zionists, and between the competing camps within the British
government. If in seeking out Aaronsohn in Paris, Yale hoped for
edification on all this, he didn’t get it. As he noted in his diary that
night—and would eventually report back to Leland Harrison in
Washington—Aaronsohn “does not wish to see Jewish autonomy or a Jewish
state at this time, saying that nothing would be more harm [sic] to the
Zionists than that. [Rather,] he wishes to see either English, American
or International government control of Palestine.” What’s more, Yale
could report, after seeing to his business in London, Aaronsohn intended
to continue on to the United States to call on his influential American
Jewish contacts to press the point. What made this rather baffling was
that while in London, Yale had met with one of Aaronsohn’s closest
allies, a businessman named Jack Mosseri. Even while extolling
Aaronsohn’s clear-eyed insights on the matter, Mosseri was advocating
the establishment of an outright Jewish government in Palestine, and the
adoption of Hebrew as its official language. Following his meetings in
Paris, Yale left for Cairo undoubtedly even more confused about where
things stood on the Zionist question than before.</p>
<p>But he also left with something else. Either oblivious to Yale’s job
responsibilities or just a peculiarly credulous sort, Aaronsohn had
entrusted his American visitor with a letter to be delivered to his
brother Alex, now back in Cairo. Other than the rudimentary safeguard of
being written in Hebrew, the letter was not encrypted in any way, and it
was in this highly indiscreet dispatch that Aaronsohn detailed his
meetings with Edmond de Rothschild and Mark Sykes and outlined all he
knew of the current status of British-Zionist negotiations in
London.</p>
<p>The spy chief hadn’t ended there, though. Along with listing by name
“our friends” in the British military hierarchy in Cairo who should be
kept abreast of developments, Aaronsohn instructed his younger brother
to put Georges-Picot, the French political agent who was on his way to
Egypt, under surveillance. “Pascal,” he wrote, referring to his chief
assistant in Cairo, “will tell you how we can watch his movements.”
Aaronsohn had even imparted some advice to his brother about William
Yale: “Get as pally as you can with him and watch him, for you will be
able to get information from him which you need, especially about
happenings in Egypt.”</p>
<p>All of this might have been of tremendous interest both to Yale and
to the agency he now represented. While the American government had been
apprised of Britain’s deliberations on the Jewish homeland question, no
one from President Wilson on down was aware of the contentiousness it
had spawned there—and they certainly didn’t know of the
behind-the-scenes role being played by Mark Sykes. But if Aaron
Aaronsohn was shockingly careless in handing such a document to William
Yale, he was also lucky. In his role as an intelligence agent, Yale
fully intended to open and translate the letter before passing it on to
Alex Aaronsohn, but, new to the spy game, he apparently didn’t
appreciate that these matters tended to be time-sensitive. By the time
he got around to having Aaronsohn’s letter translated and sent on to the
State Department, it would be mid-December. By then, most of the
explosive information he’d had in his possession for nearly three months
would be rendered moot.</p>
<p>WITH THE AIRPLANE still a rarity in the Middle East in 1917, the one
sent to collect Major Lawrence from Aqaba on the morning of October 12
was a clue to the importance being placed on his mission. Another was
the identity of those waiting for him at the military field headquarters
outside El Arish: Generals Allenby and Clayton, as well as Lawrence’s
old mentor from Oxford, David Hogarth, now the titular head of the Arab
Bureau. Lawrence had barely alit from the ninety-minute flight—in 1917,
a plane’s cruising speed was barely over one hundred miles per
hour—before learning why he’d been summoned.</p>
<p>At very long last, a date had been set for Allenby’s offensive
against the Turkish line: October 28, or just a little more than two
weeks away. It would take very different form from Archibald Murray’s
two failed attempts. In hopes of convincing the Turks that was not the
case, the British would conduct a preliminary three-day bombardment of
Gaza—the classic World War I prelude to a frontal assault—but then
strike at the far more lightly defended town of Beersheva, thirty miles
to the east. Once in possession of Beersheva and its vital water wells,
the British would then push north and west, severing Gaza’s supply lines
to the Palestine interior. If all went accordingly, the Turkish army
entrenched at Gaza would either be surrounded or forced to withdraw to
avoid being trapped. The question for Lawrence was how the Arab rebels
might assist in this great effort.</p>
<p>That was a question with no easy answer, because the very cleverness
of the Beersheva scheme derived from its modesty. In a corner of the
world where access to water was a general’s first tactical
consideration, one of the chief reasons for Murray’s unimaginative
frontal assaults at Gaza had been the need to quickly get his army to
the water sources that lay behind the Turkish lines. Of course, this
imperative had also made Murray’s efforts all-or-nothing propositions—no
lolling about on a desert battlefield in hopes of incremental gains—that
he had lost. By contrast, once in control of Beersheva’s water wells,
Allenby’s army had the luxury of closing on Gaza at a methodical pace;
operational plans called for an offensive stretched out over at least a
week. The downside—and this was where the modesty aspect played out—was
that the deliberateness of the British advance would also give the Turks
time to regroup. Allenby obviously hoped for more, but in all
probability a successful offensive meant gaining a toehold in
southwestern Palestine and little else; no race up the coastline, no
dash for Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Consequently, it was very difficult to see what role the Arabs might
play. If their contribution was to be in shutting down the Turkish
supply line into Palestine, the logical place for them to strike was the
rail junction town of Deraa in central Syria; from there, a railroad
spur ran west off the Hejaz Railway and served as the Turks’ principal
lifeline in and out of the battle zone. Furthermore, from his June
intelligence foray across Syria, Lawrence knew there were thousands of
tribesmen in the Deraa region ready to join the revolt. On the other
hand, any large-scale operation at Deraa would be to invite the
tribesmen’s slaughter if the British army advanced no farther than their
Palestinian toehold 120 miles to the southwest.</p>
<p>Nor was there much the Arab rebels massed in Aqaba could do.
Frankly—even though Lawrence was probably less than frank with his
questioners at El Arish on this score—the situation there was a mess.
For well over two months, the forces gathered there had been awaiting
word on when the British army would finally strike at southern
Palestine, the cue for their own foray into the Syrian heartland, and
this wait had led to a spiraling logistical nightmare. With thousands of
prospective warriors idling away in the port, an ever-greater amount of
supplies had needed to be shipped in from Egypt to equip and feed
them—as well as ever more British gold to keep them paid—which in turn
had drawn in even more recruits. The situation had grown so bad that by
early October, transport ships were being devoted to hauling in Egyptian
forage just to feed the camels and horses, the hills around Aqaba having
been stripped bare. As if matters weren’t grim enough, a recent cholera
outbreak had now brought the entire supply system to a virtual
standstill as quarantining procedures were introduced.</p>
<p>But probably even more deleterious was the effect this
holding-pattern existence was having on morale in Aqaba, for a sense of
gloom had now begun to permeate the rebel ranks. With no one was this
more evident than in Faisal himself. As the delay in pushing north
extended, he had sunk into a deepening depression, convinced that the
chance to wrest Syria for the Arab cause was slipping away. In his more
bitter moments, he even accused the British of imposing this inaction
deliberately, a maneuver to hand Syria to the French, and while the
harried Major Joyce bore the brunt of Faisal’s complaints, Lawrence had
frequently been compelled to lend his soothing influence in meetings
with the emir. To maintain the notion that some progress was being made,
and perhaps also to at least temporarily escape the unhappy town,
Lawrence had continued his raiding forays over the mountains—he’d just
returned from another train attack when the summons to El Arish came—but
it was all very pale stuff when set against the grand vision he had laid
out in Cairo three months earlier.</p>
<p>Yet for political reasons—and maybe personal ones too—Lawrence felt
it was vital that the Arabs contribute in some way to the upcoming
offensive. And so in El Arish he came up a new plan.</p>
<p>If not by an attack on Deraa itself, there was another place where
the railroad spur into Palestine could potentially be severed. It lay
fifteen miles to the west of Deraa, where the line passed over a number
of high bridges as it navigated the rugged Yarmuk gorge; if just one of
those bridges could be destroyed, the effect would be the same. The
further advantage to such an operation was that it could be conducted
very much along the lines of the “traditional” train attack, a
hit-and-run mission by a small and highly mobile Arab force.</p>
<p>There the similarities ended, however. The Yarmuk gorge was over two
hundred miles from Aqaba, and in a comparatively densely populated
region. On such a mission, any force coming from Aqaba would be
negotiating an alien landscape, constant prey to Turkish army patrols
and Turkish-allied local tribes. Those dangers would only multiply if
they actually succeeded in the mission. As they tried to make their
escape, the one certainty was that the raiders would be completely on
their own, far beyond the reach of either the British or fellow rebels
to come to their aid.</p>
<p>To these concerns, Lawrence offered a refinement: he would do it
himself. Just as he’d done in taking Aqaba, he would set out with a
small, handpicked force, one hopefully resourceful and unobtrusive
enough to avoid detection, and he would recruit whomever else he needed
along the way. After the operation, the local recruits could melt back
into their villages as those in Lawrence’s party scattered in search of
safe haven.</p>
<p>To most who heard it in El Arish, Lawrence’s idea seemed less a
battle plan than a suicide mission. Moreover, these were men to whom
Lawrence was not some faceless soldier, but a friend, a protégé, a young
man they admired. Weighing against this, though, were the exigencies of
war.</p>
<p>By mid-October 1917, the Entente war effort lay everywhere in
tatters. Over the previous summer, the French army had been riven by
mutinies, with entire regiments refusing to march into their trenchwork
slaughter pens; while that crisis had now abated, the army of France
remained a shaken, traumatized force. On the Eastern Front, the Germans
had smashed yet another Russian offensive, a last desperate gamble by
the dying Kerensky regime; before the end of that month of October, the
Bolsheviks would seize power and sue for peace with Germany. On the
Southern Front, the Italians had recently failed in their tenth and
eleventh offensives against the Austrians in the Isonzo valley, and were
about to experience a colossal collapse in the battle of Caporetto.
Since July 31, the British commander on the Western Front, Douglas Haig,
had been building on his reputation for callous butchery by persisting
with an offensive even more futile than his previous outing at the
Somme. By the time the battle of Passchendaele was finally called off in
early November, the seventy thousand British soldiers who had perished
in its mud fields would equate to one dead man for every two inches of
ground gained.</p>
<p>Amid all this, just how much value could be put on the life of one
more man—even of an “almost indispensable” one, as Gilbert Clayton had
described Lawrence a year earlier—if he might in some small way advance
the war effort? If Lawrence was brave or foolish or deluded enough to
chance Yarmuk, certainly no one at headquarters was going to try to talk
him out of it. Upon being briefed on the plan, General Allenby
instructed that it be carried out on the night of November 5, 6, or
7.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO POPULAR folklore, the agent of their destruction was a
pigeon.</p>
<p>Since the early days of the war, the British had employed carrier
pigeons to relay messages on the Western Front, and in the summer of
1917 someone in Cairo hit on the same idea as a way to maintain contact
with the NILI operatives in Palestine. On paper, the notion had a lot
going for it. It would help eliminate the need for the perilous and
trouble-prone spy-ship runs from Egypt—with almost eerie regularity,
these voyages had a way of coinciding with bad storms—as well as the
risk to operational security inherent in face-to-face contact between
spies and spy handlers. Carrier pigeons might also mean that crucial
intelligence would reach British lines much faster. Between the
difficulty in getting informants’ reports to Athlit, and then the wait
for the ship, the information Cairo received from NILI was often five or
six weeks out of date.</p>
<p>The pigeons had proved something of a dud, though. On a test run in
July, only one of the six birds released made it the one hundred miles
to the British headquarters in the Sinai. Nevertheless, on August 30,
Sarah Aaronsohn had turned to the method out of desperation. By then,
the Managem hadn’t put in at Athlit for nearly a month (little did Sarah
Aaronsohn know that, apparently, the main reason for this inactivity was
a British refusal to increase the pay of the man who made the swim from
ship to shore to £30 a month); anxious to reestablish contact, she
inserted her coded messages into tiny metal capsules, attached these to
the legs of several pigeons, and set the birds loose. For insurance, she
sent off two more pigeons four days later.</p>
<p>Sarah had always been leery of the system, and when she went down to
the sea for a swim on the morning of September 4, her doubts were
confirmed; perched atop a nearby water tank was one of the birds she’d
released the day before, the telltale capsule still attached to its leg.
Sure enough, rumors soon began circulating that a Turkish commander in
Jaffa had intercepted a message-carrying pigeon, and even though Turkish
authorities apparently couldn’t break the code or pinpoint the bird’s
origin, they were now convinced that a spy ring was operating somewhere
along the Palestine coast.</p>
<p>Then, in mid-September, came news of the arrest of Naaman Belkind in
the Sinai. NILI’s chief operative in southern Palestine, Belkind had
been caught trying to cross over to the British lines. Suspected of
being a spy, he was first tortured for information in Beersheva, then
transferred to Damascus to undergo more elaborate interrogation. With
Belkind’s capture, Sarah Aaronsohn and other NILI agents feared it was
only a matter of time before their network was exposed and the Turks
came for them. So did those other residents of Zichron Yaakov who’d long
been suspicious of the goings-on in town and in nearby Athlit. On
September 18, the settlement’s governing committee summoned Sarah
Aaronsohn to a meeting where she was confronted over her traife, or
“unclean,” work.</p>
<p>“Today we don’t want to hear any more explanations from you,” they
reportedly told her. “Only one word, the right answer: your promise to
stop this work, which has gone beyond all bounds.… If you want to work
at espionage, leave the territory and the lands of the Jews and go and
work in some distant land.”</p>
<p>It was amid this tightening peril that the Managem finally returned
on September 22. Apprised of the situation on land, British authorities
swiftly arranged for a British merchant ship docked in Cyprus, one large
enough to evacuate as many residents of Zichron Yaakov as wished to
leave, to make for Palestine. That ship appeared off the coast of the
Jewish colony on the night of September 25.</p>
<p>In the interim, however, Sarah Aaronsohn and her confederates
appeared to recover their resolve. Part of it may have stemmed from a
belief that Belkind wouldn’t break—after all, it had been nearly two
weeks since his capture and the Turks still hadn’t come for them—but
even more was concern of what would happen to the far-flung NILI agents
if those at its headquarters suddenly disappeared. As it was, only two
people, a mother and her young son, went out on the rescue ship. To the
suggestions of her lieutenants that she go out as well, Aaronsohn was
adamant: “I want to be the last, not the first, to leave.” Instead,
Sarah would wait for the next visit of the Managem, arranged for October
12, during which she would gauge the state of things.</p>
<p>But it seems the NILI operatives hadn’t considered another possible
explanation for the lassitude of Turkish authorities, a rather ironic
one under the circumstances. Both the Turks and their German allies
remained stung by the tremendous propaganda victory the Allies had
achieved with their talk of the Jewish “purge” in Jaffa back in May. The
Germans were also well aware that the British government was considering
calling for a Jewish homeland in Palestine as a way to win the
international Zionist community to its side; indeed, the Germans were
now rather desperately trying to come up with a counterformula to appeal
to the Zionists. As a result, and even as reports of a Jewish spy ring
in Palestine circulated in Constantinople and Berlin—because, in fact,
Naaman Belkind had talked—the Germans were sternly warning their Turkish
allies to be absolutely certain they had their culprits before making a
move. All well and good to round up a crowd of Arabs or Turks and put
them to the bastinado, but in the autumn of 1917, the Germans counseled,
the Jews in Palestine needed to be treated with a little more
finesse.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of September, the Turks were apparently handed the
last piece of the puzzle—and responsibility for this didn’t fall to an
errant pigeon or Naaman Belkind, but to the British spy runners
themselves. According to the postwar account of a Turkish intelligence
chief in Syria, it came when two Arab spies were caught on the
Palestinian coast. Under torture, the men offered that they had been put
ashore from a British spy ship, and that they’d traveled on that ship in
the company of Jewish spies. Those spies had been dropped off first, in
the vicinity of the agricultural research station at Athlit.</p>
<p>For greater protection, Sarah Aaronsohn and her chief lieutenant,
Joseph Lishansky, had recently moved into Zichron Yaakov, eight miles
down the road from Athlit. They were there when, late on the night of
October 2, the settlement was surrounded by Turkish soldiers. The
roundup began the following morning, the soldiers and secret police,
having already ransacked Athlit, working off a list of dozens of names.
Among the first to be detained was Sarah Aaronsohn, along with her
father, Ephraim, and brother Zvi. Managing a quick escape was the
“ringleader” the Turks most hoped to catch, Joseph Lishansky; with their
1917 chauvinism, it apparently never occurred to them that the true
ringleader might be a woman.</p>
<p>The paradox of having to take special care with members of the Jewish
community lest German wrath be incurred was to now take perverse form
and would turn the Turkish operation in Zichron Yaakov into a kind of
slow-motion horror show. On that first day of “questioning,” Sarah
Aaronsohn’s father and brother were severely beaten in front of her, the
soldiers demanding to be told Lishansky’s whereabouts, but she herself
wasn’t touched. Matters turned a good deal uglier the next morning.
Ephraim and Zvi Aaronsohn, along with a number of other detained men,
were led to the central square, where they were tied up and repeatedly
whipped in an attempt to get those still in hiding to surrender. Struck
by her icy defiance of the previous day, the Turks targeted Sarah for
especially brutal treatment. Tied to the gatepost of her family’s home
on Zichron’s main street, she was whipped and beaten with flexible
batons, or bastinados. Still, she would reveal nothing, reportedly even
taunting her torturers until she fell into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>One by one, those on the Turks’ wanted list who were hiding began
turning themselves in, tormented by the cries of their relatives. Or
they were betrayed by others, for as the terror extended, a kind of
group psychosis seized Zichron Yaakov. “For those who had long opposed
NILI’s activities,” wrote one historian, “it was a time to prove their
loyalty to the Turks and to settle old debts. As the Turks rounded up
more men for the bastinado, four hysterical viragos ran through the
streets, loudly rejoicing as each new victim was put under the Turkish
whips, even falling upon the arrested men with blows and shouted
abuse.”</p>
<p>With still no sign of Lishansky, the authorities raised the stakes
even higher. Summoning the settlement’s governing committee, the Turkish
commander threatened to lay waste to the village unless Lishansky was
handed over. To reinforce the point, he announced that the following
morning all those detained—some seventy in all—were to be transported to
the main police station in Nazareth for further “questioning.” Joining
them would be seventeen Zichron elders chosen at random, to be released
if Lishansky was surrendered, to share in the general unpleasantries if
not. By that afternoon, Zichron residents were taking the settlement
apart in search of Lishansky, while the governing committee posted a
reward for his capture.</p>
<p>The ordeal reached its grim denouement the next day, Friday, October
5. As the captives were being loaded for transport to Nazareth, a
bloodied and battered Sarah Aaronsohn asked permission to change into
clean clothes for the journey. Led to her family home, she was allowed
to step into a bathroom unattended, where she hastily wrote out a last
note of instructions to those NILI operatives who remained. Then she
withdrew a revolver she had secreted in a cubbyhole in anticipation of
just such a situation and shot herself in the mouth.</p>
<p>Even this did not end the torment of Sarah Aaronsohn. While the
bullet destroyed her mouth and severed her spinal cord, it missed her
brain. For four days, she lingered in agony, attended to by German
Catholic nuns, before finally expiring on the morning of October 9. By
Jewish tradition, she was buried that same day in the Zichron cemetery,
her death shroud a swatch of mosquito netting taken from her family
home. She was twenty-seven years old.</p>
<p>On the night of October 12, three days after Sarah’s death, the
Managem reappeared off the coast of Athlit as scheduled. On board was
Alex Aaronsohn, who was overseeing the Cairo office while Aaron was in
Europe. He carried a message that had been forwarded by his brother.</p>
<p>On October 1, Aaron Aaronsohn had arrived in London from Paris.
There, he had finally met Chaim Weizmann and quickly forged at least a
temporary rapprochement with the Zionist Federation leader. Central to
that rapprochement was Weizmann’s recognition of the vital role NILI was
playing in the Zionist cause, an appreciation he had expressed in a
telegram to be disseminated to the NILI operatives: “We are doing our
best to make sure that Palestine [will be] Jewish under British
protection. Your heroic stand encourages our strenuous efforts. Our
hopes are great. Be strong and of good courage until the redemption of
Israel.”</p>
<p>It was this message that Alex Aaronsohn carried ashore with him that
night at Athlit, but no one was there.</p>
<p>A CHANGE HAD come over Lawrence, a kind of quiet despondency. David
Hogarth, his old mentor, had noticed it at the El Arish headquarters in
mid-October. “He is not well,” Hogarth wrote an Arab Bureau colleague
afterward, “and talks rather hopelessly about the Arab future he once
believed in.”</p>
<p>Others had detected the change even earlier, including Lawrence
himself. “I’m not going to last out this game much longer,” he had
confided to his friend Edward Leeds after the train attack at Mudowarra
in September. “Nerves going and temper wearing thin, and one wants an
unlimited account of both.”</p>
<p>This new element of emotional fragility seemed to accelerate in the
days after his meetings in El Arish. One who would bear unique
eyewitness to it was a man named George Lloyd. Another of the
aristocratic “Amateurs” who had found themselves in the Middle East
during the war, Lloyd was a handsome, Cambridge-educated baronet and
Conservative member of Parliament who had been recruited to Stewart
Newcombe’s military intelligence unit in Cairo in late 1914. Lloyd had
soon chafed under Newcombe’s austere leadership and arranged a transfer,
but not before forming a friendship with a coworker nine years his
junior in the small office, T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>As with so many other British aristocrats during the war, Lloyd had
floated between job titles and assignments with rather dizzying
regularity—stints with military command staffs in the field interspersed
with the deskbound duties of parliamentary committees—but at least some
of those assignments periodically returned him to the Middle East. With
a background in banking, in the autumn of 1916, he had been brought down
to study the financial status of King Hussein’s regime in the wake of
the Arab Revolt. His comprehensive report on the Hejaz economy—it
essentially didn’t have one—had included a damning analysis of Édouard
Brémond’s scheme to create the Ottoman French bank, and been
instrumental in its scuttling.</p>
<p>By the autumn of 1917, however, Lloyd was marooned at a back-base
office shuffling paper and anxious to return to the field. At the end of
September he had written to Gilbert Clayton, listing those areas where
he thought he might be of some service. In particular, he remembered his
old colleague in the Cairo military intelligence office, who was now
something of a legend. “I think I could be still more useful in a
personal way to Lawrence,” Lloyd wrote. “He is overworked and must be
overstrained. If he is to remain in the field at his most responsible
job, I do think he must have true companionship and relief of some other
white man congenial to him. I could never in any way attempt to take the
lead in that job. I am not even remotely qualified. But in his curious
way, [Lawrence] has rather an addiction to me, and if he liked to have
me with him to accompany him on his ‘stunts,’ I believe my presence
might help to keep him going.”</p>
<p>Its racialist note aside, the request was a rather extraordinary one,
an aristocrat and sitting member of Parliament effectively asking to
play Sancho Panza to Lawrence’s Don Quixote. Clayton seized on the
offer, and arranged Lloyd’s immediate recall. He was waiting in Aqaba
when Lawrence returned from El Arish on October 15.</p>
<p>For several days, the two friends caught up with each other as
Lawrence laid plans for his imminent trek to Yarmuk. As Lloyd observed,
those plans had a decidedly ad hoc nature. Along with just a very tiny
cadre of Arab warriors, Lawrence would leave Aqaba with an Indian army
machine-gun unit and one British officer, a demolitions expert named
Lieutenant Wood, who was on semi-invalid status after having been shot
in the head on the Western Front. Avoiding populated areas on the long
trip north, Lawrence would then recruit his local operatives from among
the clans of eastern Syria, and join them to followers of Abd el Kader,
an Algerian exile who had been with the Arab Revolt since its inception
and whose kinsmen lived in the Yarmuk area. After the attack, the local
recruits would melt away, while those from Aqaba would scatter before
their inevitable Turkish pursuers. It was further arranged that Lloyd
would accompany Lawrence for at least the first few, safer days of the
journey.</p>
<p>On October 20, Lloyd sent Clayton a cable outlining these plans, as
well as his own first impressions of the situation in Aqaba. His breezy
tone abruptly shifted in a postscript he marked “Private”: “Lawrence is
quite fit, but much oppressed by the risk and magnitude of the job
before him. He opened his heart to me last night and told me that he
felt there was so much for him still to do in this world, places to dig,
peoples to help, that it seemed horrible to have it all cut off, as he
feels it will be, for he feels that, while he may do the [Yarmuk] job,
he has little or no chance of getting away himself. I tried to cheer him
up, but of course it is true.”</p>
<p>It was an unusually heartfelt message to be exchanged between two men
for the times, let alone included in a military cable, and it may have
been that George Lloyd hoped it would cause Clayton to cancel the
operation. If so, he was soon set right. Allowing that he too was “very
anxious” about his subordinate, Clayton replied that Lawrence’s burdened
mood was rather to be expected considering the mission before him. “He
has a lion’s heart, but even so, this strain must be very great,”
Clayton acknowledged. “Well, he is doing a great work and, as soon as
may be, we must pull him out and not risk him further—but the time is
not yet, as he is wanted just now.”</p>
<p>TO AS MUCH pomp and ceremony as a war-ravaged nation could manage,
the Young Turk regime put on a decorous reception for Abbas Hilmi II,
the erstwhile khedive of Egypt. Along with bunting and a ceremonial
guard, a host of dignitaries were on hand to greet the titular Ottoman
sovereign of Egypt as his train pulled into Constantinople’s Sirkeci
station one afternoon in late October. Among those in attendance was an
old friend and coconspirator of Abbas’s, Dr. Curt Prüfer. Picking up
where they had left off, the lives of the German spymaster and the
pretender to the Egyptian throne were about to become entwined in
intrigue once again.</p>
<p>When the Turks came into the war on the side of the Central Powers,
the British had deposed Abbas—the “wicked little khedive,” in
Kitchener’s memorable phrase—and cast him into a wandering exile, one
that had eventually landed him in Switzerland. But Abbas was a born
schemer, and in Switzerland he had a lot of time on his hands. Over the
next three years, he had tirelessly negotiated with both sides in the
conflict in hopes of regaining his throne in the postwar era, and it was
a measure of his catholic approach to plotting that each side was very
much aware of his dealings with the other. The Young Turk leadership in
Constantinople had never had much use for Abbas at the best of times,
and his artless carryings-on in Switzerland did little to endear them to
his cause; indeed, they had spurned his every advance.</p>
<p>By 1916, however, the Germans had taken a rather different view of
Abbas Hilmi. Whether born of a desire to stand by an old friend
or—rather more likely—operating under the delusion that Abbas actually
represented some constituency other than himself, the Germans had
steadily come to regard the deposed khedive as their future power broker
in Egypt once victory was achieved. After persistently encouraging Abbas
and the Constantinople regime to reconcile, their efforts had finally
come to fruition with Abbas’s arrival in the Ottoman capital that
October.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Prüfer and the ex-khedive saw a great deal
of each other, and together they formulated plans for the future of
Egypt, one in which Abbas would be restored to his former splendor with
the aid of his German friend. So close were the two men, and so
important did Berlin consider their future Egyptian stakeholder, that
Prüfer would soon virtually become Abbas’s personal handler. It was an
alliance that over the next year would take on the tinge of the bizarre,
the spectacle of two men constructing a castle-in-the-sky fantasy even
as the real world burned down around them.</p>
<p>THEY SET OUT on the evening of October 24, and very quickly George
Lloyd appreciated what so enthralled Lawrence with these journeys into
the desert interior, the sensation of passing into an otherworldly place
where time stood still. “The view up the pass was magnificent,” Lloyd
wrote in his diary from that night, “400 feet of jagged towering basalt
and granite rock on either side of us, and the moon shining in our
faces.” The Arab sheikh accompanying them, he noted, “rode ahead of us
with two or three Biasha slaves and looked like some modern Saladin out
to meet a crusade.”</p>
<p>For the first few days, the journey north was easy, and as they
wended their way through the spectacular landscape of the Wadi Rumm
mountains, the two friends talked Middle Eastern strategies and
concocted fanciful plans for a grand tour of Arabia after the war. “We
would defy Victorian sentiment and have a retinue of slaves,” Lloyd
recounted, “and would have one camel to carry books only, and we would
go to Jauf and Boreida and talk desert politics all day.” Lawrence felt
so at ease that he even talked a bit about his family and upbringing in
Oxford, the happy days he had spent in Carchemish. For Lloyd, long
accustomed to his friend’s taciturn nature, the fact that Lawrence
“talks very well” came as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>Already, though, disquieting elements were beginning to attach to the
trip. One took the form of Abd el Kader, the Algerian exile who promised
to lead Lawrence to his kinsmen in the Yarmuk region, but who frequently
clashed with other members of the traveling party. Another was the
personality of the British demolitions expert, Lieutenant Wood. After
getting lost in the darkness on his first night out, the lieutenant had
remained unhappy and aloof, rarely engaging with his countrymen except
to complain about the rigors of the journey. It increased Lloyd’s
apprehensions because, due to yet another foul‑up in the supply pipeline
from Egypt, Lawrence would have to perform some extremely risky
improvisations at the target site, and would need to rely on Wood to
step in should anything go wrong.</p>
<p>Back at El Arish, Lawrence had asked Clayton for a thousand yards of
a newly developed lightweight two-strand electric cable, to be used in
connecting the gelignite mine he would attach to the Yarmuk bridge to
its electric detonator; such a length would allow the demolition team to
be well away from the bridge when they blew it up, as well as provide a
reserve for any secondary acts of mayhem that might present themselves.
Instead, just five hundred yards of the old single-strand cable had been
delivered to Aqaba. Since this line needed to be doubled over, it placed
Lawrence a maximum of 250 yards away from the blast. Further, there was
a good chance he’d be trying to set his charge while being shot at.
Although Lawrence hoped he could go about attaching the explosives to
the under-girders of the bridge unnoticed by the Turkish guards above,
the standby plan was for others in the raiding party to distract the
Turks in a firefight from the surrounding hills. Should Lawrence become
a casualty in the process—a not unlikely prospect—Wood was expected to
take over the operation.</p>
<p>But all this supposed a sufficient raiding party could even be
raised, because what Lawrence was already discovering was a pronounced
reluctance among prospective recruits to sign on. Lloyd later wrote to
Clayton that “anyone who can hold up a train and enable the Arabs to
sack it commands temporarily their allegiance,” and this was one of the
keys to his friend’s success. “To them he is Lawrence, the arch looter,
the super-raider, the real leader of the right and only kind of ghazzu
[warfare], and he never forgets that this is a large part of his claim
to sovereignty over them.” With those Lawrence approached to join the
Yarmuk mission, however, interest very quickly died off once he
explained that his target was not a train but a bridge.</p>
<p>There was another matter, too. Among his fellow British officers,
Lawrence had gained the reputation of being a veritable “Indian scout,”
possessed of an uncanny ability to navigate his way through the desert.
As George Lloyd was discovering, this wasn’t exactly true. On two
separate occasions, they had become lost during night treks, and
Lawrence’s insistence during the second incident that they merely needed
to follow Orion to recover their way had instead led them directly
toward a Turkish encampment. All these factors considered, Lloyd wrote
Clayton, “I hope his chances are really much better than would appear at
first sight.”</p>
<p>Actually, they were potentially far worse than even Lloyd imagined.
Shortly before leaving Aqaba, Lawrence had been warned that Abd el Kader
was a traitor and now in the pay of the Turks. Lawrence hadn’t thought
to share that warning with Lloyd. Perhaps this was because the source
was Lawrence’s old antagonist in the Hejaz, Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>In fact, the French colonel had undergone a profound transformation
in recent months, especially in his view of the Arab Revolt. This may
have stemmed from his finally being informed of the Sykes-Picot pact
that ensured French control of Syria, or from a recognition that what he
couldn’t thwart he needed to embrace. Whatever the cause, by the autumn
of 1917, the imperialist Brémond had curbed his obstructionist approach
to British initiatives in the region and become energetic in trying to
get French weaponry and financial subsidies to the Arabs. Lawrence was
surely aware of this transformation in his old adversary, but, whether
still held by an abiding belief in French treachery or determined to
press on no matter the ever-mounting signs of peril, he had chosen to
ignore Brémond’s warning about Abd el Kader. If Brémond was wrong about
anything, however, it may have only been the vintage of the Algerian’s
betrayal; as far back as November 1914, Curt Prüfer had met Abd el Kader
and reported on his fidelity to the German-Turkish cause.</p>
<p>To ignore such a litany of bad omens suggested a kind of fatalistic
resignation on Lawrence’s part, as if he now saw himself on a mission
where his own life simply didn’t much matter. Lloyd saw indications of
this during their journey north. At some point, Lawrence expounded that
since the Arabs had never been privy to Sykes-Picot, they could hardly
be bound to it; instead, by seizing Syria, they might create their own
destiny. It was for this cause, Lawrence confided, that he was now
risking his life—or, as Lloyd jotted in his handwritten notes of that
remarkable conversation, “L not working for HMG [His Majesty’s
Government] but for Sherif [Hussein].”</p>
<p>On the evening of October 28, four days after leaving Aqaba, the two
friends sat down to discuss what came next. They were rapidly
approaching the true danger zone, the point of no return, and Lloyd’s
apprehensions over Lawrence’s “stunt” had only deepened. As he’d done
several times previously, Lloyd offered to stay on. Lawrence thanked
him, but explained that “he felt that any additional individual who was
not an expert at the actual demolition only added to his own risk.” He
then offered a more poignant reason for sending Lloyd back, a wish
rooted in the recognition that he might soon die: “He would like me to
go home to England,” Lloyd noted in his diary, “for he felt that there
was a risk that all his work would be ruined politically in Whitehall
and he thought I could save this.”</p>
<p>The next afternoon the two friends parted, Lloyd turning back toward
Aqaba, Lawrence continuing on for Yarmuk.</p>
<p>UPON FINALLY REACHING Cairo in late October 1917, William Yale
checked in with the American diplomat who was to act as his liaison.
This turned out to be a rather feckless young fellow named Charles
Knabenshue, who held the ambiguous title of chargé to the United States’
Diplomatic Agency. Given the all-pervasive British intelligence network
in Cairo, the two quickly concluded that Yale should present himself to
the British authorities more or less overtly; “otherwise,” Knabenshue
informed the State Department, “his independent activities would
certainly become known to them through their agents and thus excite
unfavorable suspicion.” Consequently, the two Americans asked for an
audience with the British high commissioner to Egypt, Reginald Wingate,
at his earliest convenience. Most convenient, it turned out, was the
very next day. Donning their best summer suits, Yale and Knabenshue set
out for the white stone mansion on the banks of the Nile that served as
the British Residency.</p>
<p>For Reginald Wingate, having another State Department official
wandering about Cairo presented something of a mixed prospect. On the
one hand, with the United States now joined to the Allied war effort,
British officials had an obligation to build the bonds of trust and
solidarity even in those arenas, like the Middle East, where the
Americans did not intend to militarily engage. Additionally, the high
commissioner had his own ulterior motive for playing nice with the
Americans. As he contemplated the deepening political morass into which
Great Britain was sliding in the region, its secret deals with the
French and the Arabs now about to be complemented by a pledge to the
Zionists, Wingate increasingly saw the United States as a potential
rescuer from the muddle. Indeed, just days before Yale’s arrival in
Cairo, Wingate had posited to a rather startled Knabenshue that perhaps
the Palestine deck of cards should be shuffled once again, that instead
of Arab or French or international or Zionist or even British control in
the postwar world, maybe the Americans would like to step in there and
have a go at things. Wingate could rely on Knabenshue to relay such
feelers to the State Department in a positive light—the diplomat was
married to an Englishwoman and was an ardent Anglophile—but maybe Yale
could serve as a useful seconding voice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if forced to deal with another State Department
official, Wingate and every other Briton in Cairo aware of the man’s
background undoubtedly wished that it not be William Yale. Part of it
stemmed from the antipathy with which British officials at all levels
regarded Yale’s former employer, Standard Oil of New York. Time and
again in the early days of the war, Socony tankers had been caught
trying to elude the British naval blockade to supply oil to the Germans,
a practice finally curtailed less through diplomatic appeals than by the
British seizure of Socony ships. But only curtailed; just that summer,
with the United States now officially at war with Germany, the Socony
representative in Brazil had been caught red-handed selling oil to
German front companies. In defending his actions, the man had blandly
explained that business was business, and that if he didn’t sell to the
enemy, his competitors surely would. That William Yale came out of such
a cold-blooded corporate culture did little to inspire British
confidence.</p>
<p>Nor, of course, did Yale’s specific service to that corporation. As
the British in Cairo were well aware, the former Socony representative
had just spent over two years living as a protected neutral in the heart
of enemy territory, and even if London might be grateful for the
intelligence Yale had passed on based on his tenure there, that
gratitude was far more muted at the actual war front. In particular,
British war planners in Cairo couldn’t quite forget that much of the
best highway in enemy-held Palestine, the Jerusalem-to-Beersheva road
that served as the Turks’ crucial supply lifeline to the Gaza front
where British forces had twice foundered, had actually been built by
Standard Oil back in 1914, nor that William Yale had been a supervisor
on that project.</p>
<p>All this taken together, Wingate found himself in a bit of a quandary
when, shortly after their first amicable meeting, Yale came back to him
with a bold request. From somewhere, the State Department agent had
learned of the existence of the Arab Bulletin, the weekly compendium of
raw and top-secret intelligence gathered by the Arab Bureau from across
the Middle East. So sensitive was the Bulletin that its distribution was
limited to fewer than thirty of the seniormost political and military
officials of the British Empire, along with just three representatives
of Allied governments. William Yale now wanted access to it as well.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Wingate acceded to the request, but only
after imposing a typically British precondition. Yale could peruse the
Bulletin for his own edification, but, on his word of honor, he was to
never directly quote from it in any of his dispatches to the State
Department.</p>
<p>No doubt such a gentlemanly arrangement worked just fine among the
refined diplomatic classes of Europe, but in hindsight, the high
commissioner might have wanted to more fully entertain his prejudices
about William Yale’s background; he had just given access to Britain’s
most time-sensitive secrets in the Middle East to a former employee of
one of the most predatory corporations in human history, and William
Yale didn’t so much intend to quote from the Bulletin as to mine from it
wholesale.</p>
<p>In his memoir, Yale justified that intent by a nice turn of circular
logic: “The information the British gave me was not given to me
personally, for I was but an agent of the United States government, and
if I performed the function I was employed for by the government, I must
transmit to the State Department what news I acquired.… The officials of
other governments must understand such to be the case, hence any
condition imposed by them has no validity. In consequence, I had no
hesitancy in quoting these statements in the Arab Bulletin which I
judged to be necessary.”</p>
<p>While conceding the possibility of a gap in such logic—after all, for
foreign officials to “understand” his situation, it rather depended on
their being informed of it—Yale had a handy excuse for this, too; if his
finely calibrated American moral compass had somehow been sent askew, it
was surely due to the fact that “I had been living and dealing with
European and Oriental officials for four years.”</p>
<p>But there was something else about the young American special agent
that Reginald Wingate didn’t apprehend. William Yale wasn’t actually a
former employee of Socony at all. Rather, he was officially “on leave”
from that corporation, a status that allowed him to continue to draw
half his prewar salary. And even if British officials in Cairo were to
ever grow suspicious of such a link, they were unlikely to uncover it,
since Yale had arranged for his Socony checks to be issued to his mother
and deposited in New York. In the months ahead, as he read through the
Arab Bulletin and whatever other classified British intelligence came
his way, Yale kept a careful lookout for any references to oil.</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of October 31, 1917, Aaron Aaronsohn and Chaim
Weizmann waited in an antechamber of the British cabinet’s conference
room in Whitehall. They had been invited there by Mark Sykes for the
honor of being the first to learn the result of the British leadership’s
latest deliberations on “the Zionist question.”</p>
<p>At long last, the doors to the inner sanctum swung open, and a
beaming Mark Sykes emerged. “Dr. Weizmann,” he announced, “it’s a
boy.”</p>
<p>The two Zionist leaders were then brought into the cabinet conference
room to meet Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Foreign Secretary Arthur
Balfour, and the other members of the government who had just then
approved the wording of a statement on the future status of Jewish
settlement in Palestine six months in the making. Testament to both that
tortuous process and to the deep reservations many senior British
officials still harbored on the issue was the curious manner in which
the statement would now be delivered: a scribbled, seemingly
off-the-cuff note of a mere three sentences from Secretary Balfour to
British financier Walter Rothschild.</p>
<p>“His Majesty’s Government view with favour,” the salient clause read,
“the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish
people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement
of this object.”</p>
<p>That handwritten note would soon become known as the Balfour
Declaration, and from it would grow a controversy that continues to
haunt the world to this day. For Aaron Aaronsohn, however, it was a
first step toward his dream of a reconstituted Israel, the cause for
which he and so many of his compatriots in Palestine had sacrificed so
much. Aaronsohn was yet to know the full extent of those sacrifices,
however. On that day of celebration at Whitehall, neither he nor anyone
else outside Palestine had learned of the ugly events that had occurred
at Zichron Yaakov three weeks earlier.</p>
<p>FOR GILBERT CLAYTON and David Hogarth and a handful of other British
officers in Egypt that early November, a nagging concern began to
intrude on their ebullient moods: where was Lawrence?</p>
<p>General Allenby’s offensive had gone off like clockwork. Catching the
Turkish forces around Beersheva off guard, the British cavalry had
stormed into that desert town on the morning of October 31 and then
pressed on. By November 7, the Turkish garrison at Gaza, their lines of
reinforcement cut and in imminent danger of being encircled, had
abandoned their trenchworks and begun a hasty withdrawal twenty miles up
the coast. Bad weather prevented the British from pressing their
advantage, but they had now finally pierced the first and strongest
defensive wall of Palestine.</p>
<p>Yet as the days passed and the afterglow of that victory began to
fade, those at El Arish who had been involved in the strategic planning
with Lawrence grew increasingly troubled by the enduring silence from
Yarmuk. As Gilbert Clayton confided to George Lloyd, now back in Aqaba,
on November 12, “I am very anxious for news of Lawrence.”</p>
<p>On that day, Lawrence and his raiding party were actually some eighty
miles to the east of Yarmuk, hoping to salvage at least some small
accomplishment from a mission where everything had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Reaching the desert fortress village of Azraq a few days after
parting with Lloyd, Lawrence had found the Serahin tribesmen he hoped to
enlist for Yarmuk reluctant to join; a chief reason was their deep
mistrust of Abd el Kader, whom they too suspected of being a traitor.
Swayed by an impassioned speech by Lawrence, the tribesmen finally
joined on to the mission, but then Abd el Kader had abruptly disappeared
en route to Yarmuk, last seen heading for a Turkish-held town. Still,
Lawrence refused to turn back.</p>
<p>Despite it all, he very nearly succeeded. Reaching the railroad
bridge at Tell al Shehab on the night of November 7, Lawrence and his
demolition team had been hauling the gelignite down into the gorge under
the very nose of a Turkish sentry when someone dropped a rifle against
the rocks. Alerted by the sound, the half dozen Turkish guards rolled
out of their guardhouse to begin firing wildly in all directions.
Possessed of the unpleasant knowledge that gelignite explodes if hit by
a bullet, Lawrence’s porters summarily tossed their loads into the
ravine and scrambled for safety. With little alternative, Lawrence
joined them.</p>
<p>Men in war are among the most superstitious of people, but even one
welded to pure rationality might have decided it was now time for the
Yarmuk raiding party to call things off, to count its blessings at
having survived for this long and make for safety. Instead, Lawrence
seemed gripped by an almost demonic determination to wring at least some
small shard of success from his mission. He decided to launch another
train attack.</p>
<p>To do so, though, meant raising the danger stakes yet again. With his
entourage running desperately short of food, he ordered some of its
members away. This included the Indian machine-gun crews, which meant
that even if the train attack came off, the raiders would have no heavy
weaponry to protect them. What’s more, due to the amount of electric
cable lost at the Yarmuk bridge, whoever triggered the detonation would
be positioned a mere fifty yards from the blast site. That person would
be Lawrence.</p>
<p>The site he chose was an isolated stretch of track outside the
village of Minifir on the main trunk line of the Hejaz Railway below
Amman. Crouched behind a small bush to conceal his detonator but in
plain view of the track, Lawrence first tried to blow up a long troop
transport train. To the great good fortune of himself and the sixty men
in his retinue hiding in nearby gulleys, the electric connection
failed—they surely would have been massacred by the overwhelming Turkish
force—and for agonizing minutes, Lawrence endured the puzzled stares of
the Turkish soldiers on the slowly passing train, occasionally waving to
them in forced friendliness.</p>
<p>Not that the odds of survival were much better with the somewhat
smaller troop train Lawrence succeeded in striking the next day.
Positioned so close to the explosion site, he was sent flying by the
blast’s concussion—a very lucky thing since a large chunk of the
destroyed train engine landed directly atop the detonator mechanism that
moments before had been between his knees. Dazed, Lawrence staggered to
his feet to see that his shirt was torn to shreds and blood dripped from
his left arm. As the dust and smoke cleared, he also saw just before him
“the scalded and smoking upper half of a man,” ripped in two by the
blast; that portion of his body had flown fifty yards through the
air.</p>
<p>“I duly felt that it was time to get away,” Lawrence recounted in
Seven Pillars, “but when I moved, I learnt that there was a great pain
in my right foot, because of which I could only limp along, with my head
swinging from the shock. Movement began to clear away this confusion, as
I hobbled toward the upper valley, whence the Arabs were now shooting
fast into the crowded coaches.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence stumbled toward safety, the Turkish soldiers on the train
took aim at him—albeit not very good aim; by his account, he was grazed
by at least five of their bullets, “some of them uncomfortably deep.” As
he went, still in a state of shock, he willed himself on by chanting an
odd refrain: “Oh, I wish this hadn’t happened.”</p>
<p>In the capture of Wejh ten months earlier, Lawrence had excoriated a
British officer who had led an assault party ashore, an action that
resulted in some twenty Arabs being killed, rather than simply waiting
for the stranded Turkish garrison to surrender. “To me,” he wrote of
that engagement, “an unnecessary action, or shot, or casualty, was not
only waste but sin.… Our rebels were not materials, like soldiers, but
friends of ours, trusting our leadership. We were not in command
nationally, but by invitation, and our men were volunteers—individuals,
local men, relatives—so that a death was a personal sorrow to many in
the army.”</p>
<p>At Minifir, Lawrence had picked a fight with a Turkish force of some
four hundred soldiers with a mere sixty followers; incredibly, some of
these didn’t even have weapons, and were reduced to throwing rocks at
the hobbled train. About twenty were quickly shot down, including at
least seven from among the group sent down to the tracks to rescue
Lawrence. Of the contradiction between his response to the British
officer’s actions at Wejh and his own at Minifir, Lawrence seemed to
remain quite oblivious—or perhaps, in the passage of those brutal ten
months, he simply no longer cared.</p>
<p>“Next day,” he wrote of Minifir’s aftermath, “we moved into Azrak,
having a great welcome and boasting—God forgive us—that we were
victors.”</p>

<p>WILLIAM YALE TO STATE DEPARTMENT, DECEMBER 17, 1917</p>
<p>For the traveler venturing east from the Jordanian capital of Amman,
there is little to relieve the eye. Within a few miles, the hilly
contours of Amman are left behind and the land settles into an
undulating plain of gravel and coarse sand. As a consequence, one’s
first thought upon coming to the high stone walls of the citadel of
Azraq, some fifty miles across that dreary desert, is apt to be
wonderment at its improbability. On this vast and empty landscape, how
to account for such a massive fortress, its thirty-foot walls crowned by
even higher watchtowers at its corners, ever having been built?</p>
<p>The answer is water, of course, an oasis that in ancient times
provided the only source of sustenance over a surrounding area of nearly
five thousand square miles. It was the Romans who first appreciated
Azraq’s strategic importance, erecting a small fort beside the oasis in
the second century AD, but it was Saladin’s Ayyubid empire a thousand
years later that created the impressive monolith that still stands. Even
today, the citadel dominates the town that shares its name, but in
November 1917, when Lawrence and his small band of raiders fled to Azraq
after their train attack at Minifir, that settlement consisted of a few
stone huts, and the fortress must have risen up from the plain before
them like an apparition.</p>
<p>Azraq was where Lawrence had met Nuri Shalaan, the emir of the Rualla
tribe, the previous June, and he had noted at the time that it made for
a perfect hideout. Along with water and shelter, the fortress provided a
commanding view of the desert in all directions. Consequently, Lawrence
had sent the Indian machine-gun crews there just prior to the Minifir
attack, so that by the time he and the rest of the raiding party arrived
on November 12, those guns were already mounted in the citadel’s
watchtowers, making the place all but invincible. So ideal was the
oasis, in fact, that Lawrence quickly decided to make it the forward
base for bringing the Arab Revolt to the Syrian heartland; within a day
of arriving, he sent a courier on the two-hundred-mile journey to Aqaba
with instructions for Faisal to begin bringing the vanguard of his army
north.</p>
<p>Setting up shop in Azraq served a more cunning purpose, too. The
settlement marked the northwestern boundary of Nuri Shalaan’s dominion.
Despite the repeated entreaties of Faisal, and Lawrence himself back in
June, Shalaan continued to straddle the centerline of the war, quietly
lending support to the Arab rebels one day, openly trading with the
Turks the next. In Azraq, the rebels would be placing themselves
squarely between the Rualla heartland and the Turkish-controlled Syrian
market towns. “He hesitated to declare himself only because of his
wealth in Syria,” Lawrence wrote of Shalaan, “and the possible hurt to
his tribesmen if they were deprived of their natural market. We, by
living in one of his main manors, would keep him ashamed to go in to the
enemy.”</p>
<p>In Azraq, Lawrence’s small retinue quickly became less a band of
warriors than a pickup construction crew as they set to work making the
citadel habitable for the much larger force soon to be on its way. They
repaired its tumbled stone walls and fallen roofs, even refurbished the
small mosque in its courtyard that had most recently been used as a
sheep pen. As word of the rebels’ presence spread through the district,
their labors were interrupted by visits from tribal delegations, visits
that invariably led to feasts and an atmosphere of general merriment.
Lawrence found a pleasant respite from it all by taking up residence in
the repaired watchroom of the southern tower.</p>
<p>Even for a book saturated with detail—some might say drowned by
it—there is something quite remarkable about Lawrence’s account of Azraq
in Seven Pillars. For five pages, and in some of the most heartfelt
writing of the entire memoir, he lingered over the idyll of his time
there, the happy camaraderie that existed between his group of followers
and their visitors, lyrically described the mysterious wolves or jackals
that howled outside the citadel’s walls at night but were never seen.
Even when the winter rains started, turning the fortress into a leaking,
clammy prison where the only recourse was to huddle for warmth beneath
sheepskins, misery took on a distinctly heraldic quality. “It was icy
cold as we hid there, motionless, from murky daylight until dark, our
minds seemed suspended within these massive walls, through whose every
shot-window the piercing mist streamed like a white pennant. Past and
future flowed over us like an uneddying river. We dreamed ourselves into
the spirit of the place; sieges and feasting, raids, murders,
love-singing in the night.”</p>
<p>Making all this rather more remarkable is that, at most, Lawrence
stayed just six days in Azraq on this November visit, and possibly as
few as three.</p>
<p>Perhaps the place took on its idyllic trappings in his mind because
of what he had just endured. For the preceding month, ever since coming
up with the plan to attack the Yarmuk bridge, Lawrence had lived in the
constant shadow of the knowledge that he might soon die. In Azraq, that
shadow had abruptly lifted.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was due to what lay immediately ahead. Just days after
reaching Azraq, Lawrence set off into the desert again in the company of
three men. Their destination was the crucial rail junction town of
Deraa, seventy miles to the northwest. There, Lawrence would endure the
most horrific—and among his various biographers of the past half
century, most fiercely debated—ordeal of his entire wartime
experience.</p>
<p>THE DOUBLE CROSS, for this was certainly how Aaron Aaronsohn viewed
it, was revealed on the afternoon of November 16, on the very eve of his
departure from London. It was then that he finally received Chaim
Weizmann’s letter of instruction concerning his mission to the United
States. The two had discussed that mission at such exhaustive length in
recent days that Aaronsohn almost didn’t bother to read the letter—but
he did.</p>
<p>Weizmann’s note instructed him, essentially, to shut up. “The
carrying out of these complicated duties,” he wrote, “makes it desirable
for you to avoid making public speeches and journalistic interviews, and
in order to prevent your being pressed to undertake such work we, in
accordance with your desire, formally request you to confine yourself to
the duties already specified.” In case the point could be missed,
Weizmann further ordered Aaronsohn to refrain from all “direct action,
either by speech or letter, except through the medium of Mr. Brandeis,”
the leader of American Zionists.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn was made furious by the letter, not least by Weizmann’s
contention that he himself had asked for such a muzzle. “The old man is
not a fool,” he angrily noted in his diary that night, “but I am not so
naïve either.… Verily, every day brings me another proof of Weizmann’s
hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>Since arriving in London six weeks earlier, Aaronsohn had spent a
good deal of time with the British Zionist leader. Their relationship
was a complicated one, rooted in both mutual respect and mutual
distrust, and they had developed a habit of getting along famously one
day, falling to bickering the next. Just prior to Weizmann’s demeaning
letter of instruction, there had been much more of the former, and for a
simple reason: in a matter of days, there had unfolded before their eyes
the most dramatic and consequential events in the history of
Zionism.</p>
<p>Chief among these was the Balfour Declaration, of course, but neatly
coinciding with that had been news of the British army’s rapid advance
in Palestine. After breaking through at Beersheva, Allenby’s forces had
continued to push north, scattering the disorganized Turks before them.
Although Aaronsohn didn’t know it yet, on that very day of November 16,
a British vanguard was marching unopposed into the coastal city of
Jaffa, fifty miles from their starting point, even as other units closed
on the foothills below Jerusalem. With astounding speed, what had seemed
a distant, even theoretical, dream for nineteen hundred years—the return
of the Jewish diaspora to their ancient homeland—was hurtling toward
reality.</p>
<p>Understandably, the combination of these events was having an
electrifying effect on the international Zionist community. From Jewish
enclaves around the world, messages of gratitude for the Balfour
Declaration had flooded into the British Foreign Office. That outpouring
seemed to instantly affirm the argument that Chaim Weizmann and his
allies in the British government had been pressing for months, that by
declaring support for a Jewish homeland and working to make it happen,
the Allies would find the world’s Zionist community rushing to its
side.</p>
<p>This reaction wasn’t universal, however, and the fervency of support
elsewhere made the muted reaction among American Zionists all the more
striking. By mid-November, few American newspapers had seen fit to even
mention the declaration—the New York Times dispensed with it in three
very short paragraphs—while many noted American Jewish leaders had yet
to publicly comment on it. Most conspicuous was the silence emanating
from the Wilson administration, a situation Weizmann and the British
government found particularly galling since the declaration had been
rewritten—and substantially delayed—specifically to gain the American
president’s approval.</p>
<p>As Woodrow Wilson’s closest advisor, Colonel Edward House, had
informed the British back in September when the proposal was first
explicitly put to the Americans, the president was prepared to go no
further than a vague statement of “sympathy” for the Anglo-Zionist plan,
and only this “provided it can be made without conveying any real
commitment” on his part. By subsequently watering down the declaration’s
original proposed language, the British had managed to bring Wilson
fully on board, but with a major caveat still attached; as House told
London in mid-October, the president “asks that no mention of his
approval shall be made when His Majesty’s Government makes [the] formula
public, as he has arranged that American Jews shall then ask him for his
approval, which he will give publicly here.”</p>
<p>Except that Wilson’s silence had contributed to the hesitation of
American Zionists on the matter, which in turn had enabled the president
to maintain his silence. It was in hopes of countering this standoff
that Aaron Aaronsohn, a familiar figure to many of those Zionists, was
being dispatched to the United States.</p>
<p>The goals of his mission had been worked out at a high-level meeting
at the British Foreign Office a few days earlier, one attended by both
Weizmann and Mark Sykes. It was a highly ambitious agenda. As the
officially designated liaison between the English Zionist Federation and
its American counterpart, Aaronsohn was to “help our United States
Organization to appreciate the actual significance of various political
and military developments” in the Middle East, as well as to promote the
“the rousing of Zionist enthusiasm, the stimulating of pro-Entente
propaganda,” and, in furtherance of Sykes’s fanciful notion of a
Jewish-Arab-Armenian consortium in the Middle East, “the consolidation
and alliance of the Zionist forces with those of the Arabs and
Armenians.” In addition, Aaronsohn was to act as the official channel of
communication between Weizmann and the leader of the American Zionist
community, U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis.</p>
<p>As daunting as this agenda was, Aaronsohn had accepted the assignment
wholeheartedly, and he’d let his Zionist contacts in the United States
know he was on his way. That simply added another layer of humiliation
to Weizmann’s letter of instruction on November 16.</p>
<p>But many people had tried to silence Aaron Aaronsohn over the years,
and to precious little success. Quickly coming to regard Weizmann’s
strictures as something of a dare, the next morning the agronomist
boarded a train at London’s Euston station for the run up to Liverpool
and the ship, SS St. Paul, that would take him to New York.</p>
<p>In Weizmann’s defense, it wasn’t merely a controlling nature that led
him to try to muzzle Aaronsohn. While appreciative of the scientist’s
extensive contacts in the American Zionist community, Weizmann had spent
enough time around Aaronsohn over the previous six weeks to grow
apprehensive of his hotheaded personality. That was especially worrisome
considering that there was actually something of a hidden agenda to his
mission to the United States.</p>
<p>In anticipation of full British control of Palestine in the near
future, as well as to allay the fears already being expressed by the
Muslim and Christian communities of Palestine over the Balfour
Declaration, Sykes and Weizmann had decided that a Zionist committee
should be dispatched to the region as soon as possible to take stock of
the situation. Sykes in particular was anxious that this committee
include an American delegation, figuring that its presence would be
viewed as tacit acceptance by President Wilson of both the Balfour
Declaration and future British control of Palestine. But a rather
daunting obstacle stood in the way. The United States had only declared
war on Germany, and Wilson had made it clear he had no intention of
becoming entangled in any affairs regarding the Ottoman Empire; thus it
was highly doubtful that his administration would sanction an American
delegation. This gave rise to Aaronsohn’s sub rosa mission to the United
States: to get American Zionist leaders to bring pressure on the Wilson
government, not only to openly endorse the Balfour Declaration, but to
reverse course and declare war on Turkey.</p>
<p>But when Aaronsohn arrived in the United States he received some
crushing news. At the Zionist Federation office in New York on December
1, he was handed a cable from his youngest brother, Sam, newly arrived
in Cairo. Nearly two full months after the event, Aaronsohn finally
learned of the destruction of his NILI spy ring by the Turks. His
brother’s cable also told of the death of their sister Sarah, their
father, Ephraim, and of the execution of Naaman Belkind.</p>
<p>“The sacrifice is accomplished,” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary that
night. “I knew that we still had to face the greatest misfortune, but it
is one thing to fear it, and another to know that all hope is lost. Poor
father, poor Sarati .… Her loss is the most cruel.”</p>
<p>The news surely added a new layer of resentment in his feelings for
Weizmann and the other Zionist leaders in Europe who sought to curb his
influence. For two years, Aaronsohn and those closest to him had risked
their lives for the Zionist cause—and many had now paid the ultimate
price—while those in London and Paris went about their meetings and
pamphleteering. That contrast was exquisitely underscored on December 2.
Just a day after Aaronsohn received the sad news from Athlit, members of
the English Zionist Federation gathered at London’s Albert Hall for a
gala celebration marking the one-month anniversary of the Balfour
Declaration.</p>
<p>IT’S UNLIKELY THAT any writer ever recounted his or her own torture
in more exacting, even loving, detail.</p>
<p>By Lawrence’s account, it began on the morning of November 20.
Several days earlier, he had left Azraq with his three escorts to survey
the countryside around the vital railway town of Deraa. He now wanted a
firsthand look at Deraa’s rail complex itself. The only way to do that
was brazenly, so that morning Lawrence and one of his escorts had ridden
to an isolated stretch of railway several miles north of town and
dismounted from their camels; on foot and in Arab dress, they had then
begun simply walking the rails into Deraa.</p>
<p>All was going well until, passing a Turkish army encampment, the pair
drew the notice of a suspicious sergeant. The officer collared Lawrence,
announcing that “the Bey [chief] wants you,” but for some reason allowed
his companion to continue on.</p>
<p>For the rest of that day, Lawrence was held in a guardroom awaiting
his audience with the bey and parrying suspicions that he was a Turkish
army deserter. He did so by claiming to be a Circassian, a mountain
people of the northern Caucasus who were exempt from conscription and
known for their fair complexions and light-colored eyes. In the evening,
guards came to take him to the bey’s rooms, a man Lawrence would
identify as “Nahi” in Seven Pillars, but whose actual name was Hajim
Muhittin, the Deraa district governor.</p>
<p>It became clear this meeting was intended to be of a sexual nature
when Hajim dismissed the guard detail and wrestled Lawrence onto his
bed. When he managed to wriggle free, the governor summoned the guards,
who pinioned Lawrence to the bed and began tearing away his clothes.
Hajim’s pawing began anew, until Lawrence kneed him in the groin.</p>
<p>With his naked victim again pinned to the bed by the guards, a
furious Hajim now fell on Lawrence in a frenzy of both ardor and rage,
kissing and spitting on him, biting into his neck until it drew blood,
finally lifting up a fold of skin on his chest to skewer him with a
bayonet. As Lawrence would recount, the bey then ordered the guards “to
take me out and teach me everything.”</p>
<p>What followed was an ordeal of horrific torture. Dragged into a
nearby room, Lawrence was stretched over a bench where two of the guards
“knelt on my ankles, bearing down on the back of my knees, while two
more twisted my wrists till they cracked, and then crushed them and my
neck against the wood.” A short whip was then retrieved, and the four
guards took turns lashing Lawrence on the back and buttocks scores, if
not hundreds, of times. “At last when I was completely broken they
seemed satisfied,” he recalled in Seven Pillars. “Somehow I found myself
off the bench, lying on my back on the dirty floor, where I snuggled
down, dazed, panting for breath, but vaguely comfortable.”</p>
<p>But his torment was not quite done and, in the telling, now took on a
hallucinatory quality. Viciously kicked in the ribs by the officer in
charge and ordered to stand, Lawrence instead smiled idly up at the man.
At this effrontery, the officer “flung up his arm and hacked the full
length of his whip into my groin. This doubled me half-over screaming,
or rather, trying impotently to scream, only shuddering through my open
mouth. One [of the guards] giggled with amusement. A voice cried,
‘Shame, you’ve killed him.’ Another slash followed. A roaring, and my
eyes went black.”</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, when Lawrence was finally dragged back to
Hajim’s quarters, “he now rejected me in haste, as a thing too torn and
bloody for his bed.” His ordeal at last over, Lawrence was hauled out to
the courtyard and dumped in a shed where an Armenian “dresser,” or male
nurse, was summoned to wash and bandage him. Then his torturers simply
walked away.</p>
<p>That they would do so was only the first in a remarkable—some would
say highly improbable—sequence of events that would ultimately deliver
Lawrence from his greatest tribulation. By his account, as dawn
approached, he summoned the strength to get to his feet and explore his
dreary surroundings. In the empty adjacent room, he found a “suit of
shoddy clothes” hanging from a door. Managing to dress himself, he then
climbed out a window to drop to the empty street outside. On unsteady
feet, he proceeded to walk through the just-wakening town until at last
he’d left it behind. Wheedling a ride from a passing camel-borne
merchant, he finally came to the outlying village where he’d arranged to
rendezvous with his Azraq companions. He found them there, their
previous anxiety over his capture replaced by amazement at his
escape.</p>
<p>“I told them a merry tale of bribery and trickery,” Lawrence
recounted, “which they promised to keep to themselves, laughing aloud at
the simplicity of the Turks.” That same afternoon, the group set out on
horseback for the seventy-mile return to Azraq.</p>
<p>So, in brief, was Lawrence’s account of that awful day—in brief,
because the story of his brutalization at Deraa would extend over five
lurid and excruciating-to-read pages in Seven Pillars. Yet there is
something in the sheer accumulation of such ghastly detail that serves
to cloud the narrative, to make vague what really happened. In
describing his wrists being twisted until they “cracked,” did Lawrence
mean they were broken? And was he actually raped? There are several
euphemistic clues to suggest so, but just as many to suggest the
opposite. Even more puzzling are those lingering descriptions of his
torture that take on a vaguely lascivious, voyeuristic quality. When he
was lanced with the bayonet, for example, Lawrence noted that “the blood
wavered down my side, and dripped to the front of my thigh. [Hajim]
looked pleased and dabbled it over my stomach with his finger-tips.”
Later, while being kicked in the ribs after his flogging, he would
recall that “a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through
me.”</p>
<p>Under the weight of such precise and overwhelming detail, many
Lawrence biographers—most, in fact—have concluded that the incident at
Deraa simply could not have happened as he described, even that it
didn’t occur at all. Put plainly, how could anyone subjected to the
cruelties Lawrence claimed to have endured at Deraa been capable of
escape? Even allowing for the fantastic string of good luck that brought
him to that point, how did a man whose wrists had been “cracked” shortly
before manage to climb out a window? Flogging so disrupts the central
nervous system that many victims have difficulty even standing for
several hours after receiving as few as thirty lashes; lashed
exponentially more, how was Lawrence able to walk several miles through
an enemy town unnoticed, then immediately set out on a seventy-mile
horseback ride?</p>
<p>The implausibilities grow in light of Lawrence’s subsequent actions.
Just two days after returning to Azraq, he embarked on an arduous
four-day camel ride to Aqaba. Once there, he made no mention of his
Deraa ordeal to his British comrades. Questioned years later, several
would recall that Lawrence had seemed preoccupied upon his return, one
going so far as to say he was “pale and obviously distraught,” but none
reported seeing any cuts or bruises on their colleague, or that he
displayed any obvious signs of physical discomfort. Indeed, upon seeing
his protégé less than three weeks after the Deraa incident, David
Hogarth would write to his wife that Lawrence looked “fitter and better
than when I last saw him.”</p>
<p>Casting further doubt on the Deraa story as rendered in Seven Pillars
is the radically different first version that Lawrence provided nineteen
months after the event. It was contained in a June 1919 letter to his
army friend, Colonel Walter Stirling, and Lawrence backed into the
account by way of listing the various betrayals of the Algerian
turncoat, Abd el Kader. Not only had the Algerian sabotaged his Yarmuk
bridge operation, Lawrence explained to Stirling, but he had been
recognized by Hajim Muhittin, the Deraa governor, “by virtue of Abd el
Kader’s description of me. (I learnt all about his treachery from
Hajim’s conversation, and from my guards.) Hajim was an ardent pederast
and took a fancy to me. So he kept me under guard till night, and then
tried to have me. I was unwilling, and prevailed after some difficulty.
Hajim sent me to the hospital and I escaped before dawn, being not as
hurt as he thought. He was so ashamed of the muddle he had made that he
hushed the whole thing up, and never reported my capture and escape. I
got back to Azrak very annoyed with Abd el Kader.”</p>
<p>When measured against that in Seven Pillars, this account has the
unique quality of being simultaneously both more and less plausible.
Absent the gothic cruelties described in the book, perhaps a Lawrence
“not as hurt as he thought” would have had the physical wherewithal to
escape. On the other hand, if Hajim had truly recognized him—this at a
time when there was a 20,000-Turkish-pound bounty on Lawrence’s head—it
seems utterly absurd that he would leave such a prize unguarded in a
hospital overnight. It’s also a bit hard to imagine that a chief topic
of conversation among Lawrence’s captors as they set to abusing him
would be of Abd el Kader’s role in unmasking him.</p>
<p>But despite all this, there are strong indications that something
happened in Deraa. Many of those who knew Lawrence best would report a
change in his personality, an even greater remoteness, dating from
around that time. It was also soon afterward that he began organizing
his personal bodyguard, a detail of some fifty or sixty elite warriors
who from then on would be in his almost constant company.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, Lawrence gave yet a third account of what had
occurred in Deraa, one that suggests his experience there was very
different—and in some respects, a great deal worse—from that which he
told Stirling or presented to the outside world. It came in a letter to
Charlotte Shaw, the wife of writer George Bernard Shaw, in 1924.</p>
<p>Lawrence became close friends with the Shaws after the war, with
Charlotte Shaw assuming a kind of mother-confessor role in his life, or,
as Lawrence put it, “the solitary woman who lets me feel at ease with
her in spite of it all.” Presumably in response to a question from
Charlotte Shaw, he wrote, “About that night. I shouldn’t tell you,
because decent men don’t talk about such things. I wanted to put it
plain in the book and wrestled for days with my self-respect, which
wouldn’t, hasn’t let me. For fear of being hurt, or rather to earn five
minutes respite from a pain which drove me mad, I gave away the only
possession we are born into the world with: our bodily integrity. It’s
an unforgivable matter, an irrevocable position, and it’s that which has
made me forswear decent living.… You may call this morbid, but think of
the offence and the intensity of brooding over it for these years.”</p>
<p>While rendered with his trademark obliqueness, this account suggests
an altogether different picture of Deraa: that Lawrence surrendered to
his attacker’s advances in order to avoid being tortured—or at least to
bring it to an end. If so, it not only might explain how he was able to
escape—the physical torture being minimal—but why he would tell his
Azraq companions “a merry tale” and swear them to secrecy, why he would
make no mention of the episode to his British comrades in Aqaba, and why
he would continue to dissemble about it forever after.</p>
<p>But if he escaped the worst of physical torture, it came at the price
of a complex constellation of psychological ones. As any victim of rape
or torture can attest, perhaps the most difficult aspect of the trauma
to reconcile is not the pain or even the fear of the experience, but a
profoundly felt, if utterly undeserved, sense of humiliation. Lawrence
was apparently both raped and tortured. While potentially devastating to
most anyone, in Lawrence’s case such a trial also cut to the very core
of his self-image. Since childhood, he had honed in himself the credo of
stoicism, the bedrock belief that he had the ability to endure most any
suffering or hardship, but now that faith had deserted him at his most
desperate and vulnerable moment. Possibly further added to
this—especially if the theory that Lawrence was a severely repressed
homosexual is given credence—was the element of sexual self-loathing the
ordeal likely inspired. Had he given in out of fear of pain or death, he
probably asked himself ever afterward, or because he was secretly drawn
to the act? Little wonder, then, that someone enduring such a trauma
might wish to adorn its memory with staggering violence, the kind of
violence that offers an absolution of guilt by making all questions of
will or resistance moot.</p>
<p>There is another compelling reason to believe something deeply
scarring occurred to Lawrence at Deraa, and something more along the
lines of what he described to Charlotte Shaw than what he told Walter
Stirling or wrote in Seven Pillars. In ten months, he would return to
that railway town in Syria, and there Lawrence would commit some of his
most brutal acts of the war, acts that would carry the very strong scent
of vengeance.</p>
<p>ON THE EVENING of December 4, 1917, the leading citizenry of Beirut
gathered for a banquet in honor of Djemal Pasha. “Every time I come to
Beirut,” Djemal began his speech, “I observe that the inhabitants are
very loyal. This has filled me with affection for them. I take this
opportunity of offering them my thanks for their kindness towards
me.”</p>
<p>It was a bold tack for the Syrian governor to take, since his
relationship with the city had actually always been a contentious one.
With Beirut long regarded as a crucible of Arab nationalism, Djemal had
exiled hundreds of its citizens on the suspicion of disloyalty, and the
surrounding Lebanon region had suffered disproportionately—many believed
quite deliberately—in the famines that had ravaged wartime Syria. Then
there was the matter of the twenty-five alleged anti-Turk conspirators,
unmasked in the documents purloined from the shuttered French consulate,
that Djemal had ordered hanged in the city’s Place des Canons in two
separate mass executions. By the time of his banquet in December 1917,
Place des Canons had already been dubbed Martyrs’ Square by Beirut’s
residents, a name it officially carries today.</p>
<p>Not that any of the assembled notables were likely to quibble over
Djemal’s generous words, considering that they had gathered that evening
by way of farewell. After three tumultuous years, the volatile military
man from the island of Lesbos was leaving his posts in Syria, and even
if his departure was officially described as temporary, everyone in the
banquet hall, including Djemal, knew this was a fiction.</p>
<p>As part of a reorganization recently engineered by Enver Pasha,
control of the Ottoman armies in Syria had been handed over to a new
German commander, General Erich von Falkenhayn. As a sop, Djemal had
been named commander in chief of Syria and Western Arabia—a
fine-sounding position, certainly, but more impressive if there’d been
an actual army to go with it. “A sort of commander-in-chief second
class,” observed Djemal’s private secretary, Falih Rifki. “The
artillery, the machine guns, the rifles and the swords were put under
the German’s orders, while Djemal Pasha’s share was that grand title to
put over his signature.… It was like the honorary rank of pasha which we
used to give to Bedouin sheikhs in the empty desert.”</p>
<p>If calculated to offend Djemal’s sense of honor, the move worked;
resigning his various positions, he had announced his intention to
return to Constantinople. To the degree that he blamed Enver for his
downfall, Djemal appeared to exact some small revenge in his Beirut
speech when he got around to mentioning the executions in the city’s
Place des Canons, a bit of unpleasantry that still clearly rankled some
of his listeners: “It is true that some time back I hanged certain
Arabs,” he offered. “I did not do this of my own accord, but at the
insistence of Enver Pasha.”</p>
<p>Djemal was leaving behind a record as contradictory as the man
himself. While his public vow to conquer Egypt had led to fiasco in the
Sinai, he could take some credit for his army’s two successful stands
against the British at Gaza. He had overseen an array of ambitious
modernization efforts across Syria—paved and widened city streets,
electrification, new parks and mosques and municipal buildings—even as
hundreds of thousands of his subjects, perhaps as many as a million, had
died from starvation and disease. He had tried to ameliorate the
suffering of the Armenians, at the same time that he gained a reputation
as a persecutor of the region’s Jews. And while his hard-line approach
had tamped down any rebellious ardor among Arab nationalists in Syria—in
none of its provinces had there been a significant uprising during his
tenure—his kinder, gentler approach toward King Hussein in the Hejaz had
badly backfired.</p>
<p>He was also getting out of Syria at a very good time. That autumn,
Falkenhayn had struggled to bring a new elite Turkish force, the
Yildirim Army Group, south for a preemptive assault on the British
massing in the Sinai, but he had been beaten to the punch by Allenby,
with the British smashing through the Turkish line at the end of
October. In the month since, and with transiting Yildirim units still
scattered over the breadth of Syria, the British had seized much of
southern Palestine, and now stood poised on the outskirts of Jerusalem
itself. In all of this, Djemal stood perfectly blameless.</p>
<p>But it also wasn’t as if either Djemal or the Turkish war effort in
Syria were finished just yet. Instead, and as had happened so many times
over the centuries when all seemed lost for the Ottoman Empire, it was
precisely at this darkest moment that a shocking turn of events had the
chance to change everything.</p>
<p>On November 7, the very day that the Turkish army had been abandoning
Gaza, Vladimir Lenin and his Bolsheviks had overthrown the Russian
government of Alexander Kerensky. The following morning, the Bolsheviks
released their Decree on Peace, announcing their intention to
immediately withdraw from the war. All along the front, Russian forces
stood down in a unilateral cease-fire. Just like that, the Ottoman
Empire had seen its most implacable foe of the past two centuries simply
fall away, one of the three enemy armies tearing at its frontiers
suddenly go silent.</p>
<p>More extraordinary news had soon followed. Rifling through the
overthrown government’s files, the Bolsheviks found a copy of the
still-secret Sykes-Picot Agreement. No document could have more
confirmed the Bolsheviks’ accusation that the slaughter visited on the
earth over the past three years had been in the service of imperial
aggrandizement, and in mid-November they published the compact for all
to see. Of course, that document also played to Djemal Pasha’s
long-standing accusation—that British and French talk of supporting Arab
independence was simply a ruse to grab Arab lands for their colonial
empires—and he used the occasion of his speech in Beirut to reiterate
that point to the entire Arab and Muslim world.</p>
<p>“The [Sykes-Picot] Agreement was a device for bringing about an Arab
revolt to suit the designs of the British who, needing tools and
catspaws to serve their own ends, encouraged certain Arabs to rebel by
giving them mendacious promises and hoodwinking them with false hopes,”
Djemal said. For a long time, he told his audience, he had puzzled over
why King Hussein had turned his back on his Muslim brethren; now the
answer was revealed. “Eventually, the unfortunate Sherif Hussein fell
into the trap laid for him by the British, allowed himself to be
ensnared by their cajoleries, and committed his offence against the
unity and the majesty of Islam.”</p>
<p>But with the Western imperialist scheme thus exposed, Djemal
suggested, there was still time to defeat it. Hussein could repent for
his past sins by renouncing his unholy alliance. Arabs everywhere, now
shown the true face of the conniving enemy, could unite to defeat them.
“I am going to Constantinople, but I shall soon be back,” Djemal vowed
at the end of his speech. “I beg the leading inhabitants of the town to
pay no attention to false rumors, and to be patient during the few
remaining days of the war, so that we may reach our goal.”</p>
<p>The following day, his Beirut speech, with its exposure of
Sykes-Picot, was carried on the front page of newspapers throughout
Syria and Turkey.</p>
<p>Djemal hadn’t limited his efforts to oration. Just prior to his
Beirut address, he had penned letters to Faisal ibn Hussein and to the
rebels’ chief military commander, and arranged for them to be delivered
to Aqaba through a confidential emissary. In his letter to Faisal,
Djemal rather magnanimously conceded that the Arab Revolt might be
justified if it brought about a truly independent Arab government in
which the “dignity and splendor of Islam” was secured. “But what sort of
independence can you conceive … after Palestine has become an
international country, as the allied governments have openly and
officially declared, [and] with Syria completely under French
domination, and with Iraq and the whole of Mesopotamia forming part and
parcel of British possessions? And how is such a government as this
going to undertake, with independence and majesty, the shaping of the
destinies of Islam? Perhaps you had not foreseen these results at the
outset, but I am hoping that the spectacle of the British conquering
Palestine will reveal to you this truth in all its nakedness.” The
letter was intended as more than a scold. “If you admit this truth,”
Djemal concluded, “there is nothing easier than to announce a general
amnesty for the Arab revolt, and reopen negotiations with a view to
solving the problem in favor of Islam.”</p>
<p>Djemal had been quite strategic in choosing the recipient of his
overture. As he knew from the time they’d spent together in Damascus,
Faisal was simultaneously probably the most devout and the most modern
of Hussein’s four sons. Djemal had also selected his words with great
care, returning again and again to two: “Islam” and “independence.” If
he’d done so in hopes of stirring doubt in Faisal, he’d selected
well.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>FOR HIS STATE visit to Jerusalem in 1899, Kaiser Wilhelm had arranged
for a special entryway to be carved from the city’s ancient walls.
Astride a black stallion and clad in a uniform studded with medals, the
German leader used this portal to enter the Old City, sacred ground to
the world’s Jews, Christians, and Muslims, like some latter-day
conquering Crusader.</p>
<p>The move had proven something of a public relations black eye for
Germany, and for their own celebratory entry into Jerusalem in December
1917, the British strived to keep things more low-key. Adhering to the
long-distance counsel of Mark Sykes, World War I Britain’s version of a
political stage manager, it was decided that General Allenby would enter
through one of the city’s traditional gates and on foot, and that no
British flags would be flown. The Allies had been handed a tremendous
propaganda victory with Jerusalem’s capture, Sykes pointed out, and
anything that smacked of British or Christian triumphalism was a sure
way to sabotage it.</p>
<p>Rather by chance, one of those participating in the historic
procession into the Old City on that morning of December 11 was T. E.
Lawrence. After his traumatic ordeal in Deraa, he had returned to Aqaba
and then been summoned to Allenby’s field headquarters in southern
Palestine. He had made the journey fully expecting to be upbraided,
perhaps even demoted, for his failure at Yarmuk, but instead found
Allenby pleasantly distracted by his continuing string of battlefield
victories. He was still at General Headquarters on December 9 when word
came that the Turks and Germans were pulling out of Jerusalem. Lent an
army uniform and the appropriate officer’s “pips,” he changed out of his
worn Arab robes and joined in the ceremonial entry masquerading as
General Clayton’s staff officer. Even for a man whose Christian faith
was now moribund, Lawrence found the import of that day overwhelming;
for the first time in over six hundred years, a European army had
returned to the cradle of Western religion, and the Middle East was
never going to be the same. “For me,” he later wrote, “[it] was the
supreme moment of the war.”</p>
<p>Lawrence undoubtedly felt overwhelmed for other reasons, too. It was
only when he had hobbled into Aqaba in late November, racked by illness
and still weakened by his ill-treatment at Deraa, that he had learned
the extent of Allenby’s victories in Palestine. It was also when he
first learned of the Balfour Declaration, and of the Russian revolution
that had brought the Bolsheviks to power. A bit closer to home, he had
also been apprised of the final fall from grace of his old nemesis,
Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>Senior British officials had been gunning for Brémond since the
previous spring; in fact, antipathy for him appeared to be one of the
few points on which Lawrence and Mark Sykes fully agreed. “I am
convinced that the sooner the French military mission is removed from
Hejaz, the better,” Sykes had written the Foreign Office back in May.
“The French officers are without exception anti-Arab, and only serve to
promote dissension and intrigue.” In Sykes’s opinion, that antagonistic
tone was set by the head of the French mission, in “the deliberately
perverse attitude and policy followed by Colonel Brémond.”</p>
<p>The force of Sykes’s condemnation may have actually served to keep
the French colonel around that much longer. Anxious not to appear
acquiescent to their ally, upon being informed of British displeasure
with Brémond, Paris had replied that, coincidentally enough, they were
already considering radically downscaling his Jeddah mission. Apparently
to create a face-saving “decent interval” that would allow for French
authorship of the idea, nothing was then done for the next six months.
Playing their own role in the charade, British officials busied
themselves in the meantime by debating just what honorific to bestow
upon their irritant. The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and
St. George, it was finally resolved, and Reginald Wingate had taken the
opportunity of that conferral to extend to Brémond his “warm compliments
and congratulations on the valuable work recently performed by the
French Detachment under your command in the Hejaz.”</p>
<p>But just because Édouard Brémond was now the holder of one of
Britain’s highest military commendations didn’t alter the fact that, at
the end of the day, he was still a Frenchman. As the dismissed colonel
set sail for France—to maintain the decorous façade, he was officially
taking a six-week leave—Wingate fired off a cable to a senior official
at the Foreign Office. “Brémond’s antecedents are known to you,” he
wrote, “and I think it very probable that main object of his journey is
political and to canvas opinion in Paris against entente policy of Picot
and Sykes. Latter should be warned.”</p>
<p>What Brémond’s departure didn’t mean was an end to French maneuvering
in the Middle East. Very much to the contrary. With Allenby’s success in
Palestine, what had previously been a hypothetical divvying up of Middle
Eastern spoils between the Entente powers had suddenly turned quite
real. And with tangible stakes in the game, the political intrigue was
about to grow far more intense.</p>
<p>Lawrence got a glimpse of this on December 11 when after the
ceremonial entry into Jerusalem, the senior British staff repaired to a
banquet hall for lunch. As the French political agent officially
attached to Allenby’s army, Georges-Picot enjoyed a place of honor
during the ceremony, and he evidently took that to mean the two-year-old
plan he and Mark Sykes had worked out for Jerusalem’s international
administration remained in effect. In the banquet hall, Picot approached
Allenby to announce, “And tomorrow, my dear general, I will take the
necessary steps to set up civil government in the town.”</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, the comment brought an awkward silence to the
hall. “Salad, chicken mayonnaise and foie gras sandwiches hung in our
wet mouths unmunched, while we turned to Allenby and gaped. Even he
seemed for the moment at a loss.” Only for a moment, though. Turning to
the French political agent, Allenby explained that, as Jerusalem fell
within the British military zone, the only true authority there was the
military commander in chief—namely, himself.</p>
<p>But if the changed military situation was drawing new pressures from
the French, that was only one small facet of the political troubles now
facing the British. Lawrence saw this firsthand when, after the
Jerusalem ceremony, he went on to Cairo. He found a city seething with
rage.</p>
<p>Mark Sykes, apparently thinking better of his earlier opinion that
the Arabs would have no objection to increased Jewish settlement in
Palestine, had endeavored to keep knowledge of the Balfour Declaration
in the Arab world to an absolute minimum. That effort had been an abject
failure, and as news of the declaration spread among the Egyptian
populace that November, dismay had quickly turned to anger. Even as
British authorities tried to placate those protests, there had then come
Djemal Pasha’s speech in Beirut exposing the terms of the Sykes-Picot
Agreement. With startling speed, and with potential consequences that
might reduce Allenby’s victories in Palestine to virtual insignificance,
the long British campaign to win and keep the Arab world to its side was
dealt a serious double blow.</p>
<p>As he observed the situation in Cairo, Lawrence foresaw dark days
ahead; if the Balfour and Sykes-Picot revelations were stirring the
normally quiescent and heavily policed Egyptian population to near
revolt, what effect would they have among the Arab rebels gathered in
Aqaba and their prospective allies across Syria? If secretly thankful
that he’d had the foresight to inform Faisal of Sykes-Picot nine months
earlier—if knowledge of that had only come now, so improvidently
combined with that of the Balfour Declaration, it was hard to imagine
Faisal ever trusting in Lawrence or any other Briton again—the news was
certain to fuel fury among those won over by the Arab leader. No matter
how committed they were to Faisal or the cause of Arab independence, it
had never been far from any of these men’s minds that the Hashemite
leaders of the revolt might be dupes, unwitting or otherwise, of their
British and French paymasters. This had been the contention of
Constantinople all along, of course, and that charge had now been given
both amplification and credence by Djemal Pasha’s disclosures in
Beirut.</p>
<p>In Cairo, Lawrence soon received confirmation of the box in which
Faisal was finding himself, and also learned of the potential escape
hatch being offered by Djemal.</p>
<p>After receiving Djemal’s peace-feeler letter of late November, Faisal
had forwarded a copy to his father. In mid-December, Hussein had in turn
passed it along to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah. Perhaps Hussein did so to
show that, even now, he fully trusted in the British, or perhaps it was
meant to convey a warning that in the face of British double dealing,
other options were available to him. Of course, he may have simply
figured the British would soon find out anyway, since Djemal had
mentioned his peace overtures to the Arab rebels in his Beirut
speech.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, Hussein’s proffer of Djemal’s letter set off
alarm bells in British Cairo. A few days prior, Clayton had warned Sykes
that with news of Sykes-Picot and the Balfour Declaration spreading
through the Arab world, it was surely only a matter of time before the
Turks approached the rebels with a counteroffer; Djemal’s letter was
proof that this time had already come. Fortunately, in Clayton’s view,
neither Faisal nor Hussein had responded to the overture—they had done
the proper thing and notified the British authorities—but who knew what
might happen when the next Turkish offer came?</p>
<p>Lawrence saw matters quite differently. In fact, in Djemal Pasha’s
letter, he saw a unique opening for the Arab cause.</p>
<p>As he’d confided to George Lloyd in October, Lawrence no longer
regarded himself as fighting for Great Britain, but for Arab
independence. Within the upper reaches of the British military and
political staff in Cairo, it was common knowledge that British
emissaries had for the past several months been meeting in Switzerland
with their Turkish counterparts toward forging a peace deal, and if
Great Britain felt no compunction against secretly negotiating with the
enemy, then why should the Arabs? To the contrary, by playing the
Turkish card, by possibly extracting specific terms of settlement from
them, the Arabs might then be able to turn around and wring concrete
concessions from the British and French. Ultimately, by playing their
cards adroitly, the Arabs might gain independence no matter who finally
won the war.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence chose to spell any of this out to his superiors in
Cairo. Instead, he suggested that it might be in Britain’s interests to
ascertain just what the Turks were willing to offer the Arabs, so that
the British could respond preemptively. Implausible as it might seem,
this suggestion found a receptive ear in Reginald Wingate. “I have
recommended King Hussein to send no official replies [to the Turks],”
Wingate cabled the War Cabinet, “but Major Lawrence will consult Faisal
as to whether any further confirmation of new Turkish policy could be
obtained by interchange of verbal [sic] messages between him and
Djemal.”</p>
<p>The War Cabinet swiftly moved to scotch this proposal, but not
swiftly enough; Lawrence, it turned out, had left Cairo on the same day,
Christmas Eve, that Wingate had sent his cable, so that by the time the
War Cabinet weighed in, he was already back in Aqaba with Faisal. Just
as he had done at other critical junctures, Lawrence would now
capitalize on the delay in receiving orders as an excuse to pursue his
own course. That course was to encourage Faisal to enter into a dialogue
with his Turkish enemies. Over the coming months, Faisal and Lawrence
would establish and maintain just such a dialogue with the chief Turkish
general operating on the south Syrian front.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence engaged in rather labored reasoning to
justify these dealings with the enemy, arguing that with the Ottoman
regime increasingly riven between Islamists like Djemal Pasha and
Turkish nationalists like the general, Faisal might drive a wedge
between them. “By suitably guarded phrases,” Lawrence wrote, “we could
throw the odium of the [Arab] Revolt on [Djemal’s] clerical party, and
then perhaps the militarists might fall out with them.” Ultimately, so
this reasoning went, such a falling-out would benefit both the Arabs and
the Turkish nationalists, the former to gain their independence, the
latter freed up to concentrate on preserving their homeland of
Anatolia.</p>
<p>Perhaps recognizing the thinness of this argument, Lawrence
subsequently tried to put distance to his own role in the affair. Thus,
the account in the 1922 so-called Oxford Text edition of Seven
Pillars—“Faisal, with my full assistance, sent back tendentious answers
to Djemal”—became Faisal acting quite on his own by 1926.</p>
<p>Three years later, Lawrence offered a much simpler—and more
jaded—rationale for his and Faisal’s actions. It came in reply to a
question about those wartime contacts put to him by none other than
William Yale. “All is fair in love, war, and alliances,” Lawrence wrote
Yale in 1929. “Poof!”</p>
<p>IT APPARENTLY WASN’T enough for Aaron Aaronsohn that he flagrantly
violate Chaim Weizmann’s gag order while in the United States. It was
also necessary that Weizmann be made fully aware of it, as Aaronsohn
proceeded to do in a lengthy report to the British Zionist leader on
December 13, 1917. Along with a series of meetings with officials in
Washington, he recounted, there had been his address to the City Club in
Boston, “to which all the Jewish notables of the city were invited.”
This was followed by his talk at the conservative and steadfastly
anti-Zionist Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, precisely the sort of
opposition bastion that Weizmann desired be avoided but where, according
to Aaronsohn, he had been warmly received. “I tried to be brief—I didn’t
speak for more than forty minutes—and all hostility in the audience
ceased.”</p>
<p>Surely adding to the warm reception Aaronsohn received in the United
States was the news of the British capture of Jerusalem on December 9.
Since the beginning of the war, few events had more electrified the
American public, Jews and Christians alike, and it was quickly leading
to a spirited national debate over the future dispensation of the Holy
Land. Nowhere was this debate more pronounced than within the Jewish
community, and the early hesitation of American Zionists to embrace the
Balfour Declaration was rapidly falling away.</p>
<p>However, Aaronsohn’s charm offensive was not nearly so successful
with the man Chaim Weizmann and his British supporters regarded as
crucial to their American effort, Louis Brandeis. He had several cordial
meetings in Washington with the Supreme Court justice, but Brandeis
remained decidedly cool to the idea of an American delegation joining
the Zionist Commission soon to be on its way to Palestine; this,
Brandeis pointed out, would lend the appearance of official American
support for Britain’s Palestinian endeavor—which, of course, was
precisely the British goal.</p>
<p>The second and more sensitive aim of the British Zionists—an American
declaration of war on the Turks—was made fairly plain in a letter from
Weizmann to Brandeis in mid-January. “It must be abundantly clear,”
Weizmann wrote, “that there is a complete coincidence of
American-British-Judean interests as against Prusso-Turkish interests.…
This is why I think that a Jewish Palestine must become a war aim for
America exactly in the same way as [German-occupied] Alsace Lorraine and
an independent Poland.”</p>
<p>With that, Brandeis had evidently heard enough. As far back as April
1917, Weizmann had enlisted Brandeis to secure Woodrow Wilson’s support
for the Jewish homeland idea, and the Supreme Court justice had pursued
that effort as far as his sense of ethics allowed. Now, not only was
Weizmann asking him to lean on the president to dramatically expand the
American war effort, but referring to the vague “national home for the
Jewish people” noted in the Balfour Declaration as “Jewish Palestine.”
Brandeis finally wrote Weizmann a terse cable stating that American
participation in the Zionist Commission was “now impossible.” It was the
beginning of a rift between two of the world’s most prominent Zionist
leaders that would never fully heal.</p>
<p>AT THE RIDGELINE, Lawrence drew up on his camel to survey the
shadowed town of Tafileh in the ravine below. It was a distinctly
uninviting place, and as he was soon to discover, home to a situation
quite unlike any he had encountered over his sixteen months in the
Arabian war theater.</p>
<p>It was the morning of January 20, 1918. Five days earlier, a mixed
force of Bedouin warriors and a five-hundred-man unit of the Arab Legion
that had been training in Aqaba had stormed into Tafileh, located in a
mountain valley in southern Syria, and chased out the town’s small
Turkish garrison. To the north lay the Arabs’ next objectives, the
larger settlements of Kerak and Madeba. Lawrence had come to assist in
the operations against those towns, and to then push on to the northern
shore of the Dead Sea; if all went to plan, it would be there, in the
vicinity of the ancient city of Jericho, that the Arab rebels would
finally forge a direct land link with General Allenby’s army in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>But as guerrilla fighters throughout history have discovered, it is
one thing to conduct hit-and-run raids against the enemy, and quite
another to take population centers and hold them to one’s side. While
modern insurgency and counterinsurgency experts have coined a term for
the process—“hearts and minds”—the bare truth is there are no hearts or
minds to be won. Instead, the essential focus of civilians caught in a
guerrilla war zone is simply to stay alive, and they will cast their lot
with whichever side best ensures that—until that side doesn’t anymore,
at which point the civilians will move to the other side. In this most
primal of contests, appeals to nationalism or ideology are next to
worthless; “allegiance” is won by providing security or instilling
terror, or through some combination of the two.</p>
<p>In the streets of “liberated” Tafileh, Lawrence encountered a perfect
illustration in miniature of this hearts-and-minds fallacy. There had
been no joyous celebrations among those townspeople at being freed from
the Turkish yoke or at the notion of a united Arab nation; rather,
Tafileh’s merchants and small farmers and shepherds saw themselves as
caught between two bad choices. They regarded the marauding Bedouin
warriors with equal parts fear and hatred, viewed them as little more
than camel-borne bandits. If less apprehensive of the disciplined Arab
Legion, they quite naturally saw this large force as a potentially
calamitous drain on their meager food supplies, and had quickly hidden
away whatever stores they could. Behind this was a collective fear of
what would happen if the Turks retook the valley, the reprisals likely
to follow, and as usually occurs in such situations, this had produced a
sharp divergence of opinion over where safety best lay.</p>
<p>“Affairs are in rather a curious state here,” Lawrence reported to
Gilbert Clayton on January 22. “The local people are divided into two
very bitterly opposed factions, and are therefore terrified of each
other and of us. There is shooting up and down the streets every night,
and general tension. We are taking steps about police, etc., which will
allay this state of nerves, and I hope produce enough supplies for us to
go on with.”</p>
<p>Working against that, though, was the hoarding carried out by the
villagers, a development already causing food shortages in the valley
and enormous price increases in whatever was available. This, in turn,
was fueling growing resentment among the populace, and growing anger
among the warriors. “I’m sorry not to be able to send you proper figures
of quantities of supplies here,” Lawrence concluded his January 22
report, “but have been very busy since I got here in trying to find out
who was for us, and where they were. The conflicts of ideas, local
feuds, and party interests are so wild (this being the moment of anarchy
the whole district has been longing for for years), that hardly anyone
could straighten them out in a hurry.”</p>
<p>But the situation was about to get much worse. The day after writing
to Clayton, Lawrence learned that a sizable Turkish force was on its way
to retake Tafileh.</p>
<p>By the time he reached Tafileh, Lawrence had been back in Arabia from
his Jerusalem-Cairo sojourn for a full month. He’d spent that time
taking stock of the Arab Revolt, conferring with Faisal in Aqaba,
preparing for what was to come next. Shortly after his return, he’d
joined in a foray against the Hejaz Railway aboard the newest British
weapon to be introduced to the Arabian front, the Rolls-Royce armored
car. While the two armored cars had inflicted only minor damage on the
Turkish outpost they targeted, it was immediately apparent to all that
this new weapon fundamentally changed the desert war. Now, with an
absolute minimal investment of men and matériel, the British could
thoroughly dominate the railway, attacking its isolated Turkish
garrisons and disrupting the line almost at will. With such dominance
there at last came acceptance in British military leadership of the
argument Lawrence had been trying to make for nearly a year: there
really was no good reason to push for the fall of Medina; better to
leave those thousands of marooned enemy soldiers precisely where they
were.</p>
<p>His preparations had also been personal. In the wake of his ordeal at
Deraa, Lawrence set about organizing his own private army, or bodyguard.
“I began to increase my people to a troop,” he wrote, “adding such
lawless men as I found, fellows whose dash had got them into trouble
elsewhere.” His recruitment of the “lawless” was quite deliberate and
clever. Troublemakers within their own tribes, perhaps even outcasts
altogether, these men would ultimately be loyal to Lawrence alone, a
consideration that also explained the inclusion of the two camp
miscreants, Farraj and Daud, in their number. It was a bond of personal
loyalty for which the bodyguard unit would pay dearly, however; by
Lawrence’s estimate, nearly sixty of them would be dead before war’s
end.</p>
<p>It was with this expanded retinue that, on January 10, Lawrence had
set off to join the ongoing operation at Tafileh. As he’d been informed
by General Allenby’s staff in Jerusalem, the British army in Palestine
probably wouldn’t be sufficiently rested and reequipped to embark on
their next push until mid-February. In light of that delay, Lawrence and
the war planners had come up with a fairly modest interim scheme for the
Arab rebels. Avoiding the string of major population centers of the
Syrian interior—still under Turkish control and a long way from the
reach of British forces in Palestine—the rebel army would instead clear
the ground in between, the Moab Plateau mountains just to the east of
the Dead Sea, then forge a link with the British near Jerusalem.
Capturing Tafileh had been the first objective in this campaign, and
next up were the larger towns of Kerak and Madeba, but all was suddenly
cast into doubt by the news that the Turks were marching on Tafileh.</p>
<p>If hewing to their past tactics, the Arabs would have taken this
opportunity to pack up and melt away. Lawrence was enough a student of
guerrilla insurgencies, however, to realize that the rules of warfare
had now abruptly changed. Just as in Tafileh, the residents of Kerak and
Madeba were sitting on the sidelines, waiting to cast their lot with the
winner. This meant that the fate of the three towns was inextricably
linked, that if Tafileh was abandoned, any chance in Kerak or Madeba was
lost too. In essence, the rebels had no choice but to stand and
fight.</p>
<p>That effort got off to a very shaky start. On the afternoon of
January 24, the vanguard of the Turkish force of some one thousand
soldiers sent down from Kerak entered the Tafileh valley from the Wadi
Hesa gorge a few miles north of town. In quick order, they pushed the
thin rebel picket line all the way back to the town’s outskirts.
Fortunately for the rebels, night fell before the Turks could fully
press their advantage; under the cover of darkness, the commander of the
Arab Legion hastily withdrew his forces all the way to the southern end
of the valley. “Everybody thought we were running away,” Lawrence would
report to Clayton. “I think we were.”</p>
<p>Before dawn, Lawrence ventured into the town and saw firsthand the
effect of the Legion’s withdrawal on the residents. “Everyone was
screaming with terror, goods were being bundled out of the houses into
the streets, which were packed with women and men. Mounted Arabs were
galloping up and down, firing wildly into the air, and the flashes of
the Turkish rifles were outlining the further cliffs of the Tafileh
gorge.”</p>
<p>Observing that a small picket force still held a bluff north of town,
Lawrence urgently sent word back to the Legion commander for
reinforcements and machine guns to be brought up, then hurried to the
bluff himself. As morning broke, the situation for the tiny force
there—perhaps thirty Arab warriors and an equal number of Tafileh
residents—turned “rather difficult.”</p>
<p>“The Turks were working through the pass and along the eastern
boundary ridge of the plain,” Lawrence reported, “and concentrating the
fire of about fifteen machine guns on the face and flank of the rather
obvious little mound we were holding. They were meanwhile correcting the
fusing of their shrapnel, which had been grazing the hilltop and
bursting over the plain, and were [now] beginning to sprinkle the sides
and top of the hill quite freely. Our people were short of ammunition,
and the loss of the position was obviously only a matter of
minutes.”</p>
<p>But the holding action on the bluff proved crucial. By the time the
position was abandoned, the main Arab force had hurried forward with
their machine and mountain guns to form a new line on a parallel ridge a
mile and a half behind. Amid this, there occurred one of those small,
seemingly insignificant deeds upon which battles are often decided.
During his own dash back to safety, Lawrence had shown the presence of
mind to count off his paces, and he calculated that the distance between
the abandoned bluff—the position the Turks would soon occupy—and the
Arabs’ new defensive line was right around thirty-one hundred yards. No
sooner had the main Turkish force settled upon the bluff and deployed
their own heavy weaponry than they were engulfed in a storm of mortar
fire from the Arabs’ mountain guns.</p>
<p>With the Turks pinned down in the center, Lawrence drew on his
knowledge of military history to conduct a classic pincer attack,
dispatching small units of fighters out in a wide arc to work their way
behind the unsuspecting enemy. Shortly after 3 p.m., the trap was
sprung, the Arab machine gunners on the flank pouring fire into the now
completely exposed Turks on the bluff. With their machine- and
mountain-gun crews quickly wiped out, the Turkish troops wavered and
then began a disorganized scramble for the safety of the Wadi Hesa
gorge. Except there was no safety to be found there either. With all
semblance of cohesion gone, throughout the evening and into the night,
the fleeing Turks were set upon by Arab cavalrymen and marauding
Bedouin, even mountain villagers bent on vengeance or loot. Of the
thousand Turkish soldiers who marched into Tafileh, Lawrence estimated
their losses at some five hundred dead and wounded, with another two
hundred captured, but even this may have been on the low side; he later
heard reports that no more than fifty made it back to Kerak, the rest
picked off one by one in the gorge. It had come at a cost of some
twenty-five Arabs killed, and perhaps three times as many wounded.</p>
<p>The rout at Tafileh was a classic Napoleonic-style trap, and one that
would shortly win Lawrence the Distinguished Service Order medal. Yet it
was an action he himself would describe as “villainous,” a pointless
exercise in one-upmanship. “We could have won by refusing battle, foxed
them by maneuvering our center as on twenty such occasions before and
since.” Instead, by engaging the enemy in a conventional battle, the
Arabs had lost one-sixth of their strength to casualties, making an
advance on Madeba or Kerak all but impossible for the near future. “This
evening,” he wrote, “there was no glory left, but the terror of the
broken flesh, which had been our own men, carried past us to their
homes.”</p>
<p>But at Tafileh, Lawrence would exhibit a new and unsettling trait:
hatred for the enemy, an element of fury at their stupidity for having
attacked him. Even if he might lament the fate of the “thousand poor
Turks” who had marched into Tafileh, it was bereft of the compassion
that had once marked him. Indeed, upon hearing of the Turks still being
massacred in the gorge long after the battle had been won, Lawrence did
nothing. “I should have been crying-sorry for the enemy,” he recounted
in Seven Pillars, “but after the angers and exertions of the battle, my
mind was too tired to care to go down into that awful place and spend
the night saving them.”</p>
<p>Six months earlier, in the wake of a similarly one-sided battle at
Aba el Lissan, Lawrence had ensured that the mortally wounded enemy be
placed along a streambank so that they might at least have water while
they died. At Tafileh, even those Turks lightly wounded were left out
unattended as a fierce snowstorm came in that night; by morning, all
were dead. “It was indefensible, as was the whole theory of war, but no
special reproach lay on us for it. We risked our lives in the blizzard …
to save our own fellows, and if our rule was not to lose Arabs to kill
even many Turks, still less might we lose them to save Turks.”</p>

<p>T. E. LAWRENCE ON HIS ROLE IN THE ARAB REVOLT, SEVEN PILLARS OF
WISDOM</p>
<p>Doggedness and a thirst for adventure had carried William Yale far
from his aristocratic origins. In 1908, those traits had taken him to
the steaming jungles of the Panama Canal Zone and, shortly after, to the
oilfields of Oklahoma and the backwaters of the Ottoman Empire. In the
autumn of 1917, they had brought him to Cairo, the locus of the Allied
war effort in the eastern Mediterranean, with the ambiguous title of
special agent to the United States Department of State. That assignment
also dropped him into a new kind of jungle, a maze of different
interests vying for power in the future Middle East.</p>
<p>“These interests crossed and recrossed each other,” Yale would write,
“creating a confused tangle of intrigues and policies which was almost
impossible to disentangle, and back of these policies and intrigues were
the interested groups in France and Great Britain: capitalistic,
religious, cultural. Added to these complications was the problem of
Zionism and Jewish desires.… No more fascinating and interesting task
could be given a man than that of attempting to understand and report
upon this most complex of problems.”</p>
<p>Smart enough to grasp his utter unpreparedness—he was literally the
only American field intelligence officer for the entire region—Yale
quickly scoured the English-language bookstores in Cairo for histories
of the Middle East. He cultivated relationships with an array of
Egyptian and émigré community leaders, and frequently dropped by the
Arab Bureau offices at the Savoy Hotel for informal chats with its
intelligence officers. In the time-honored tradition of both journalists
and spies everywhere, he diligently put in many hours at the favored
watering holes of diplomats and senior military officers; in Cairo in
1917, that most frequently meant the pleasantly appointed rooms of the
Turf Club on the Nile island of Gezira.</p>
<p>As Yale soon discovered, the fraternizing aspect of his mission
actually required minimal exertion. That’s because most every player in
the Cairo political swirl was only too eager to present his case to an
official of the United States, the newest and, if Woodrow Wilson had his
way, most influential member of the Allied military partnership. There
was one notable exception, however. “The French made no effort to
contact me,” Yale recalled. “The formality and exclusiveness of the[ir]
officials repulsed me, and a certain inherent timidity kept me from
making further advances.”</p>
<p>But if playing to his tenacious spirit, at least initially the Cairo
posting offered precious little in the way of adventure. Following
General Allenby’s capture of Jerusalem in December, Yale sought
permission from British authorities to visit the Palestine battlefront,
a request denied on the grounds that only accredited military liaison
officers were allowed. The real reason, Yale eventually deduced, was
British concern that granting access to an American would require they
do the same for their more meddlesome allies—the Italians and Greeks
were constantly asking—at a time when they had their hands full in
Palestine just trying to sandbag the French.</p>
<p>Adding to Yale’s frustration in this area was the peculiarly British
approach to avoiding confrontation, its officials quick to cede ground
when necessary, graciously inert when it wasn’t. The American special
agent had an early taste of this when, shortly after the fall of
Jerusalem, he learned that the British had imprisoned Zaki Bey, the
city’s former Ottoman military governor and the man who had been
instrumental in securing Yale’s escape from Palestine. In high dudgeon,
Yale stormed into the offices of the relevant British officials and told
them of the many favors Zaki Bey had performed for the expatriate
community in Jerusalem. He also mentioned that Zaki Bey was a close
friend of the former U.S. consul to Palestine, Otis Glazebrook, who in
turn was close friends with Woodrow Wilson. “I told them if Zaki Bey was
not released on parole, I would take the matter up with Washington and
have it brought to the President’s attention.”</p>
<p>In the face of such a naked threat, the officials of most powers
would have either meekly acquiesced or gotten their backs up, but the
British did one better. A few days later, Yale was given Zaki Bey’s
release papers and “kindly requested” to deliver them personally to the
prison where he was being held, thereby allowing for an emotional
reunion of the two friends at the prison gates. “When the British decide
to do anything,” Yale noted somewhat peevishly, “they do it ungrudgingly
and so gracefully that one feels under real obligation to them.”</p>
<p>Marooned in the Egyptian capital, the thirty-year-old Yale focused
his energies on trying to make sense of the multisided battle for
primacy in the region. One of these struggles was of fairly long
standing—the snarl of claims over the future dispensation of greater
Syria—but this had now been joined, courtesy of the Balfour Declaration,
by an equally acrimonious debate centered on Palestine.</p>
<p>Lending a certain air of unreality to these contests, as well as to
Yale’s earnest pondering of them, was that by the end of 1917 the Allied
war effort had never looked so bleak. In the western Russian city of
Brest-Litovsk, German and Russian Bolshevik negotiators were hammering
out the final details of Russia’s formal withdrawal from the war, and
already hundreds of thousands of German soldiers had been transferred
from the Eastern Front to the Western. For British and French commanders
nervously watching this buildup in France, it was a sure sign the
Germans were planning a massive spring offensive against their depleted
armies, one intended to deliver a knockout blow to the Allies before the
slowly arriving American armies could take to the field in a significant
way. The Russian collapse had even emboldened the Turks, with War
Minister Enver now scheming not only to recover that portion of
northeastern Turkey previously occupied by the czar’s armies, but also
to carry his advantage into the Turkic regions of the Caucasus conquered
by Russia in the nineteenth century. In light of all this, the constant
bickering in Cairo over the future spoils of war seemed more than a tad
premature.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Yale dutifully stayed to the task before him. In each
of his “Monday reports” to Leland Harrison at the State Department, he
strived to bring clarity to another facet of the Middle Eastern morass
by outlining the views of whatever officials or religious figures or
causists he had met with during the previous week, and by mining the
Arab Bulletin for pertinent background information. As might be
expected, though, instead of clarity, these voluminous reports with
their welter of opposing viewpoints tended to only render the situation
more incomprehensible—or at least so it would seem judging by the utter
silence emanating from Leland Harrison.</p>
<p>It appears this earnest search for insight also had the effect of
delaying the special agent’s discovery of the one simple truth to be
found amid the thicket: no one else knew what was really going on
either. Yale finally began to cotton to this in late December, after a
meeting between General Clayton and a group of Syrian exile leaders in
Cairo. To the Syrians’ deepening fears that the Balfour Declaration
meant a Jewish state was to be imposed in Palestine, Clayton stoutly
insisted this wasn’t so, that all the declaration’s “national home”
phrasing meant was that Jews would be allowed to emigrate, and to share
politically and economically in the region’s future to the same degree
as everyone else. This assurance from one of the highest-ranking British
officials in Egypt had a profoundly calming effect on the Syrian
delegation. “On the strength of what they were told by General Clayton,”
Yale reported to the State Department, “the Syrians are considering the
advisability of abandoning for the present their opposition to the Jews,
and talk even of cooperating with the Zionists.”</p>
<p>Except that immediately after that meeting, Yale fell into
conversation with Clayton’s chief deputy at the Arab Bureau, who readily
confessed that neither he nor the general had any idea what the
“national home” phrasing actually meant.</p>
<p>In seeking to unravel the Middle East, William Yale would be neither
the first nor the last observer to conclude that perhaps his most
accurate assessment had come at very first glance, before he had been
sullied by “knowledge.” As he had reported to Harrison in just his third
Monday report back in November, “the truth seems to be that Downing
Street has no definite policy and have given their agents no clear
program to work out.” As a result, those agents were adopting an
“attitude of more or less sympathy with all the varied interests,” or
simply telling everyone what they hoped to hear.</p>
<p>But finally, the struggling intelligence agent stumbled upon
something that seemed to clear away much of the obfuscation. It occurred
in late February 1918 when, reading through a back issue of the Arab
Bulletin, he came across an essay entitled “Syria: The Raw
Material.”</p>
<p>In just eight pages of terse and wonderfully opinionated prose, the
essayist had methodically delineated the myriad fissures that divided
and subdivided that country, fissures that extended beyond tribal and
ethnic and religious fault lines to even produce rivalries between
cities and towns. Completely shorn of wishful thinking, that dangerous
proclivity of bureaucratic essayists everywhere, the writer instead
painted a stark picture of the problems awaiting any outsider who might
attempt to impose their will there. Of particular interest to Yale, in
light of the debate then roiling Cairo, was how the writer “in a few
words suggests the bitterness which exists in southern Palestine against
the Zionists. This bitterness of feeling is shared alike by Moslems and
Christians, and recent developments tend only to aggravate the natural
hatred of the Palestinians for those Jews who come to Palestine
declaring the country to be theirs.”</p>
<p>What made this essay all the more remarkable was that it had appeared
in the Arab Bulletin in March 1917, fully eight months before the
Balfour Declaration, and, according to a prefatory note, had actually
been written two years prior to that. And something else caught William
Yale’s eye. Its author was already known to him. It was the same man who
had humiliated him at Beersheva in January 1914, and who had debriefed
him in Cairo at the war’s outbreak: British army major T. E.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>In fact, without apparently realizing it, Yale had already alerted
the State Department to T. E. Lawrence and his exploits. Back in
November 1917, while composing a report on the history of the Arab
Revolt, Yale had sufficiently picked up on stories circulating through
Cairo at the time to write of “a young British officer who, with the
Bedouins, organizes raids against the Hedjaz RR [railroad] and strives
to win the Bedouins over to the side of the Sherif and British.” In
February 1918, after stumbling upon Lawrence’s old report, the American
intelligence agent took the unprecedented step of asking Reginald
Wingate for permission to copy out the essay in its entirety for
transmission to the State Department. He also resolved to meet with
Lawrence the next time he passed through Cairo.</p>
<p>IN THE SAME week that William Yale was transmitting Lawrence’s old
Syria report to the State Department, Lawrence was endeavoring to have
himself removed from the Syrian war theater altogether. The cause was a
very costly error in judgment, blame for which could be placed squarely
at Lawrence’s door—or so he half hoped.</p>
<p>The seed had been planted a month earlier. On the eve of the battle
for Tafileh, Lawrence had sent Gilbert Clayton an urgent request for
£30,000 worth of gold (about million in its modern equivalent) for the
Arab force gathered on the Moab Plateau under the leadership of Faisal’s
younger brother Zeid. Without those funds, Lawrence warned, Zeid’s
followers would soon begin to melt away; with them, the rebels could
advance north against the mountain strongholds of Kerak and Madeba, then
sweep down to meet the vanguard of the British army in the Jordan
valley. In one determined drive, the rebels would finally establish a
direct land link to their British advisors and suppliers in Palestine,
while the eastern flank of General Allenby’s army would be secured
against Turkish attack.</p>
<p>Testament to both the importance of the Moab Plateau campaign and
Lawrence’s reputation for punctiliousness in financial matters—he rarely
exaggerated his needs—Clayton scrambled to gather up the gold in Egypt
and rush it to Aqaba. A few days after the Turkish assault on Tafileh
was repelled, Lawrence had personally come down to meet the gold caravan
at the rebels’ new forward base camp in Guweira, some thirty-five miles
northeast of Aqaba. Anxious to get back to the Tafileh front as soon as
possible, he had then taken as much of the gold as he and his two
escorts on fleet camels could manage—about £6,000 worth—and set off
ahead of the slower-moving caravan.</p>
<p>They rode directly into a winter blizzard, one that turned the
Tafileh-Guweira run from an easy day-and-a-half jaunt into a grinding
three-day ordeal. Driven by blind impatience, Lawrence abandoned his
slower-moving escorts after two days and, laden down with all their
gold, forged ahead alone. That proved to be a nearly fatal mistake when
he and his mount became stranded in a waist-deep snowdrift, one that
took hours of digging by hand to escape. Of course, the delays Lawrence
experienced on his prized camel were likely to be only worse for those
coming behind, putting even greater distance between him and the rest of
the gold caravan.</p>
<p>At last reaching Tafileh on February 11, Lawrence discovered to his
disgust that Zeid had done nothing in his absence to prepare for the
push north. Instead, as he wrote to Clayton the next day, Hussein’s
youngest son had “hummed and hawed, and threw away his chance.… These
Arabs are the most ghastly material to build into a design.”</p>
<p>In light of that withering assessment, Lawrence’s subsequent actions
were close to inexplicable. Eager to scout the terrain over which the
rebels would soon advance, he decided to personally conduct an extended
reconnaissance of the northern countryside even as the gold caravan
remained strung out along the Guweira-Tafileh path. What’s more, he
chose to take the only other Western officer in Tafileh, a young British
lieutenant named Alec Kirkbride, with him. In departing, he put the
twenty-one-year-old Zeid in charge of safeguarding the incoming gold,
with instructions to “spend what was necessary for current expenses
until my return.”</p>
<p>For six days, Lawrence and Kirkbride scouted the country to the north
and west, ranging as far as the eastern slopes of the Jordan valley
above Jericho. When they returned to Tafileh on February 18, Lawrence
was in high spirits. With the gold shipment now arrived, the campaign to
clear the Moab Plateau and link up with the British at the Dead Sea
appeared an easy prospect, one he estimated could be accomplished within
a month. When he began outlining this to Zeid, however, he detected a
peculiar discomfort in the young man’s demeanor.</p>
<p>“But that will need a lot of money,” Zeid finally interjected.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” Lawrence replied, “our funds in hand will cover it, and
more.”</p>
<p>It was then that King Hussein’s youngest son embarrassedly admitted
he had already spent all the money.</p>
<p>Lawrence initially thought Zeid was joking, but was soon set right.
As the Guweira gold caravan had drifted into Tafileh over the preceding
days, Zeid’s lieutenants and tribal allies, all owed back wages, had
fallen upon it as if on a cash cow. Even worse, most of the gold had
apparently been distributed to units that, for tribal reasons, wouldn’t
be participating in the push north, while those units Lawrence was
counting on as his vanguard were shortchanged. “I was aghast,” he
recounted, “for this meant the complete ruin of my plans and hopes, the
collapse of our effort to keep faith with Allenby.”</p>
<p>He also didn’t truly believe Zeid. As Lawrence soon learned, the last
caravan stragglers had reached Tafileh just the day before, barely
leaving time for the gold to be counted, let alone distributed. In a
rage, Lawrence stormed off to his tent. “All night I thought over what
could be done,” he wrote, “but found a blank, and when morning came
could only send word to Zeid that, if he would not return the money, I
must go away.”</p>
<p>Instead, Zeid only managed to produce a hastily scribbled “supposed”
accounting of where the gold had gone. True to his word, that afternoon
Lawrence saddled up his camel and, in the company of just four escorts,
set out for General Allenby’s headquarters in southern Palestine, one
hundred miles to the west. Once there, he intended to ask to be relieved
of his command, “to beg Allenby to find me some smaller part
elsewhere.”</p>
<p>If this was presented as an issue of personal honor, there was
clearly another impulse at work in Lawrence. In Zeid’s incompetence (or
dishonesty) the young British major suddenly saw the opportunity for a
kind of personal deliverance, a release from the onus of leadership that
weighed so heavily upon him.</p>
<p>This was not at all a new burden. Five months earlier, Lawrence had
confided to his friend Edward Leeds that his nerves were going and that
he “was not going to last out this game much longer”—and that had been
before his nearly suicidal mission to Yarmuk, his ghastly Deraa ordeal,
and the hideous slaughter at Tafileh. His growing exhaustion had even
registered in his most recent letter to Gilbert Clayton on the eve of
the missing gold episode. “I am getting shy of adventures,” he had
written his superior on February 12. “I’m in an extraordinary position
just now vis-à-vis the sherifs and the tribes, and sooner or later must
go bust. I do my best to keep in the background but cannot, and some day
everybody will combine and down me. It is impossible for a foreigner to
run another people of their own free will indefinitely, and my innings
has been a fairly long one.”</p>
<p>As he would later note in Seven Pillars, added to this were the
simple rigors and dangers of his duty. “For a year and a half I had been
in motion, riding a thousand miles each month upon camels, with added
nervous hours in crazy aeroplanes or rushing across country in powerful
cars. In my last five actions, I had been hit, and my body so dreaded
further pain that now I had to force myself under fire.”</p>
<p>There were precious few signs this torment might soon end; much the
opposite, in fact. When Lawrence had left Oxford for the war, his
brother Arnold had been a fourteen-year-old schoolboy. In recent months,
Lawrence had taken to counseling his brother on the skills he would
need—familiarity with Arabic, the ability to drive a range of motor
vehicles—if Arnold hoped to be assigned to the Middle East for his
upcoming military service.</p>
<p>But quite beyond these burdens was the psychic toll that came with
living a lie, “the rankling fraudulence which had to be my mind’s habit:
that pretense to lead the national uprising of another race, the daily
posturing in alien dress, preaching in alien speech,” upholding a
promise that Lawrence increasingly realized was almost sure to be
broken. In this, the slaughter at Tafileh had shorn him of the “last
gloss” of wishful thinking. “To be charged against my conceit were the
causeless and ineffectual deaths of those twenty Arabs and seven hundred
Turks in Wadi Hesa. My will had gone, and I feared longer to be
alone.”</p>
<p>Except none of it mattered. As Lawrence discovered upon reaching
Allenby’s headquarters at Ramleh on February 22, not only was
deliverance out of the question, but a new mission had already been
planned for him. Indeed, so vital was Lawrence to this new scheme that
for nearly a week an airplane had been making repeated sorties over
Tafileh valley, dropping flyers ordering that he immediately make for
headquarters. (The pilot, it would eventually be determined, had
leafleted the wrong valley.)</p>
<p>True to pattern, dramatic events had occurred on the world stage
during Lawrence’s latest absence. While bracing for the Germans’ coming
offensive on the Western Front, Allied planners had desperately scoured
their maps in search of some spot on the global battlefield where a
preemptive thrust might distract or dilute the German military colossus
building in France. In mid-February, General Allenby had been informed
that task was falling to him. As soon as possible, he was to launch an
all-out strike at the Syrian heartland, with Damascus as the ultimate
objective. The Arab rebels would be called upon to play a crucial role
in that strike, which was why headquarters had been so anxious to speak
with their chief liaison to the Arabs, Major Lawrence.</p>
<p>But then the stakes were raised even further. In the city of Brest-
Litovsk, German peace negotiators had presented their Russian counter
parts with terms so staggeringly punitive that it had caused the
Bolshevik delegation, led by Leon Trotsky, to pack up and go home. That
breakdown in talks may have been just what Berlin was looking for; on
February 18, just four days before Lawrence’s arrival at Ramleh, German
armies had begun steamrolling through western Russia, their advance
limited only by how much ground their troops could cover in a day. So
complete was the Russian collapse that on February 25 its leaders
swiftly acceded to German terms even more retributive than those it had
rejected a week earlier. For those Allied commanders nervously waiting
on the Western Front, it meant Germany was now free to shuttle even more
of its soldiers and weaponry to France, that the last small obstacle to
the approaching German offensive had been removed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the notion that Lawrence might be
permitted to stand down from his crucial post over a point of honor was
so risible that he apparently didn’t even broach the topic with Allenby.
“There was no escape for me,” he recounted. “I must take up again my
mantle of fraud in the East. With my certain contempt for half-measures,
I took it up quickly and wrapped myself in it completely.”</p>
<p>After a quick visit to Jerusalem to see his old friend Ronald Storrs,
the city’s newly appointed military governor, Lawrence continued on to
Cairo. There, on March 8, he wrote a short letter home.</p>
<p>For many months, he had been telling his family in Oxford that he
hoped to soon make use of the leave time he had accrued since 1914 to
arrange a visit home. That hope was now more distant than ever. “I’m to
go back [to the war front] till June at least,” he wrote. “One rather
expected that, I’m afraid.” He went on to dimissively tell of his latest
promotion and military citation, stemming from his leadership role in an
action that was already coming to haunt him, the massacre at Tafileh.
“They have now given me a DSO [Distinguished Service Order medal]. It’s
a pity all this good stuff is not sent to someone who could use it! Also
apparently I’m a colonel of sorts.”</p>
<p>During his brief stopover in Cairo, Lawrence also acceded to meet
with a young American intelligence officer who was eager to speak with
him.</p>
<p>“MAJOR LAWRENCE’S OPINIONS demand the most serious consideration,”
William Yale wrote Leland Harrison on March 11, “because of his intimate
knowledge of the Arabs and the importance of the work he is engaged in.…
Speaking Arabic fluently, traveling, living and working among the
Bedouins, he has a knowledge of the sentiments and feelings of the Arab
tribes that probably no other westerner has. His knowledge of the true
condition of affairs existing at the present time among the Arabs should
be more accurate than that of any other person.”</p>
<p>It marked the third time that Yale and Lawrence had crossed paths. In
their last encounter in the autumn of 1914, the newly minted British
intelligence officer had pumped Yale for details on Turkish troop
movements and supply lines in southern Palestine. Now it was William
Yale who was the inquiring intelligence agent, Lawrence on the receiving
end of a battery of questions related to the state of affairs in
Syria.</p>
<p>Long accustomed to the opacity of British officials, Yale was clearly
startled by Lawrence’s candor. It enabled the special agent to report
back to the State Department that “the British forces in Palestine would
soon commence an offensive from which excellent results are expected.”
Even more remarkable, Lawrence provided Yale with almost precise details
on the Arab rebels’ military objectives in that coming offensive, even
pinpointing the spot in the Syrian interior where he hoped to forge a
link between the Arabs and Allenby’s forces.</p>
<p>When the conversation turned to the political, Lawrence was just as
forthright. As Yale reported, “Lawrence states the Arabs have no faith
in the word of England and of France, and that they believe only such
territory as they are able to secure by [their own] force of arms will
belong to them.” In Lawrence’s judgment, the Arabs’ inherent distrust of
their Western allies had taken on new depth with the Balfour
Declaration. “He characterizes it as a dangerous policy and speaks of
the activities permitted the Zionist in Egypt and in Palestine as being
unwise and foolhardy.” Should the British go any further in their
support of the Zionists, Lawrence warned, it could quickly bring about
the ruin of the Arab nationalist movement—or at least its end in any way
beneficial to the Allies. With his long experience in the region, he
dismissed the sunny vision of a man like Mark Sykes and his imagining of
a Jewish nation gradually forming in the face of grudging Arab
acceptance; in one of Lawrence’s most prescient comments, he allowed
that “if a Jewish state is to be created in Palestine, it will have to
be done by force of arms and maintained by force of arms amid an
overwhelmingly hostile population.”</p>
<p>For a British military officer to so openly disparage the policies of
his own government simply wasn’t done in 1918, let alone to a foreign
intelligence agent, but it reflected just how powerful Lawrence had
become: he was his nation’s vital link to the Arab rebels in the field,
no one else could fulfill that role, and because of this, he could say
or do nearly anything he wished. Yet, just as at their first encounter
in Beersheva, it seemed Lawrence harbored something of a hidden agenda
at this meeting with Yale, an agenda masked by his disarming candor.
Without showing his guiding hand, he hoped to steer Yale—and through
him, the U.S. State Department—toward a policy of his choosing.</p>
<p>Lawrence was now keenly aware of just how little freedom of movement
the Arab rebels had, that by tethering their effort directly to that of
the British, the fate of both the Arab Revolt and Hussein’s Hashemite
dynasty had become hostage to the dictates and caprices of their vastly
more powerful ally. While this had always been true to a
degree—certainly the Sykes-Picot accord made plain the Arabs’ junior
status in the larger scheme of things—what was occurring in early 1918
was of an entirely different order of magnitude.</p>
<p>This was starkly illustrated by a visit Lawrence had made to Aqaba
just days before his meeting with Yale. The once-sleepy port village had
been so radically transformed over the previous few months as to be
unrecognizable, with vast tent cities dotting the narrow coastal shelf
beyond the ship-clogged harbor, towering stockpiles of supplies and war
matériel everywhere. Where the British presence had once consisted of a
handful of officers, there were now hundreds of Crown soldiers handling
logistics, training rebel recruits, tending to the myriad needs of an
encamped fighting force of thousands of warriors. Aqaba even had its own
resident air force now, a fleet of Royal Flying Corps airplanes that
periodically set off to bomb the Hejaz Railway and Turkish military
installations inland.</p>
<p>The change in circumstances had also been evident in the manner of
his visit. Sent to inform Faisal of Allenby’s plans for the upcoming
Syrian offensive, Lawrence hadn’t gone to Aqaba aboard one of the
slow-moving Red Sea transport ships, but as the passenger in an RFC
biplane commandeered by headquarters for the purpose. In his talks with
Faisal, long gone were the languorous discussions of tactics or politics
over tea in the prince’s tent; instead, their time together on this
visit had been less an exploration of what the rebels might do in the
coming offensive than a briefing by Lawrence on what they would do.
Then, after little more than twenty-four hours on the ground in Aqaba,
Lawrence had reboarded the requisitioned airplane and flown back to
Cairo.</p>
<p>It all illustrated one of the paradoxes of power, that what the Arab
Revolt had gained in importance in the eyes of its British overseers had
come with a corresponding loss of autonomy. The ultimate danger of that,
in Lawrence’s view, was that the British were now taking their tethered
Arab allies down a path that might well lead to their destruction.</p>
<p>From the outset, Hussein’s notion of a British-sponsored pan-Arab
revolt with himself as its leader had been built on very shaky ground,
viewed skeptically by both Arab conservatives and progressives. To
ibn-Saud, Hussein’s chief rival in Arabia and the leader of the
fundamentalist Wahhabist movement, the king’s alliance with the British
made him a toady of the Christian West (never mind that Saud was also on
the British payroll). At the same time, the more cosmopolitan Arabs of
Syria had felt little in common with the Bedouin “primitives” riding out
of the Hejaz. These were problems to deal with down the road, once the
war was over, but with the Balfour Declaration the road had rushed up to
meet Hussein.</p>
<p>Taken aback by the furious Arab reaction to that declaration, the
British had put great pressure on their principal Arab ally to come out
in its support. This Hussein had done, tepidly, but instead of calming
the Arab waters, the move had served to strengthen Arab opposition to
Hussein. In early January, David Hogarth, Lawrence’s old mentor and now
the “acting director” of the Arab Bureau—the title was little more than
an honorific, true authority lay elsewhere—had called upon Hussein in
hopes of finally clarifying the boundaries of a postwar Arab nation.
Instead, he had found a king who only wished to talk of the growing
threat he now faced from ibn-Saud and his Wahhabists. Simultaneously,
Arab nationalists in Egypt and Syria had adopted ibn-Saud’s toady
language in deriding Hussein’s accommodation with the Zionists. Just how
badly this British scheme had backfired was evident in an alarming
letter Reginald Wingate received from Hussein in early February. As
Wingate reported, “[Hussein] refers to the contingency of suicide as
[an] alternative to political bankruptcy.… The phraseology is vague, but
the Sherif of Mecca appears to be affected by apprehensions caused by
the Allies’ pro-Zionist declarations.”</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Lawrence became ensnared. In late
January, he had penned an essay for an even more restricted version of
the Arab Bulletin, one seen by only a handful of officials, in which
he’d strongly touted Faisal’s base of support in Syria, while
besmirching his opponents there as dupes of French or German propaganda.
While the article was a fairly transparent effort to boost Faisal’s
claim to authority in Syria, it also helped alert those British
officials grappling with the Arab fallout from Balfour that perhaps it
was Faisal, not Hussein, whom they should be looking to for help—and, of
course, wooing Faisal meant going through Lawrence. In early February,
just days after Lawrence’s article appeared, Gilbert Clayton informed
Mark Sykes that “I have urged Lawrence to impress on Faisal the
necessity of an entente with the Jews.”</p>
<p>The irony of being enlisted to sell Faisal on a policy with which he
himself vehemently disagreed was not lost on Lawrence, and he had only
halfheartedly agreed to do so. “As for the Jews,” he’d answered Clayton
from Tafileh, “when I see Faisal next I’ll talk to him, and the Arab
attitude shall be sympathetic—for the duration of the war at least.”
There was a limit to how far Lawrence would go, though; as he informed
Clayton, if some public declaration by Faisal was hoped for, that “is
rather beyond my province.”</p>
<p>But however much he opposed the policy, Lawrence was enough a
practitioner of realpolitik to realize he had little choice in the
matter; the Balfour Declaration was a fait accompli, the Arab rebels
were hardly in a position to renounce their alliance with the British
over it, so the chief goal now must be to limit its damage or to play it
for advantage elsewhere. In this latter category, the obvious candidate
was greater Syria. Lawrence could see a calculus whereby, in return for
the Arab rebels ceding to Balfour, a grateful Britain would then uphold
the rebels’ claim to the rest of Syria against the French. The problem
was, Lawrence had sufficiently lost faith in his own government to
realize that this was a very risky bet.</p>
<p>So what other cards to play? Certainly the most radical—and
perilous—was to negotiate with the Turks. In early February, Faisal had
received another secret peace feeler from General Mehmet Djemal, the new
commander of the Turkish Fourth Army. This missive had been a good deal
more specific and accommodating than Djemal Pasha’s previous letter, and
Faisal had sent an equally specific, if guarded, reply. While overtly
rebuffing the overture, he had also left the door open for a possible
settlement if the Turks withdrew their troops from Arabia and southern
Syria. This was not such a deal-breaking ultimatum as it might sound; by
February 1918, the Young Turks were already looking to concentrate their
military efforts on reclaiming those Turkic lands being vacated by the
defeated Russians, and might be quite happy to abandon the impoverished
and quarrelsome Arab regions to do so.</p>
<p>But before anything so drastic as cutting a deal with the Turks,
there was one more potential actor who could aid the Arab cause: the
Americans. This was almost certainly why Lawrence found the time to meet
with William Yale in Cairo.</p>
<p>Since bringing his country into the war in April 1917, President
Wilson had repeatedly stressed that the age of imperialism was over,
that his crusade for the world to “be made safe for democracy” also
meant self-determination and independence for oppressed peoples and
“small nations” everywhere. It had taken his European allies some time
to accept that the American president actually held to such a quaint
notion, but all doubt was dispelled with Wilson’s “Fourteen Points for
Peace” proclamation in January 1918.</p>
<p>Probably more than any other single document of the twentieth
century, Wilson’s Fourteen Points captivated a global audience. Amid the
abject and unending ruin of World War I, the American president had
outlined a semi-utopian vision of how the earth was to function in the
future, a radical sweeping away of the imperial structure that had held
sway for millennia, in favor of all peoples enjoying the right to
self-determination, a world in which patient negotiation at a “League of
Nations” might make war obsolete. So profound and revolutionary was this
document that it sent shock waves through all the imperial powers, the
war-shattered citizenry of Berlin and Vienna seeing it as a potential
pathway out of their misery just as much as their brethren in London and
Paris and Rome. Adding to its attraction was that in simple, unambiguous
language, Wilson had laid out a road map—his Fourteen Points—for how
this process would begin.</p>
<p>The twelfth point of that proclamation was taken up with the
dispensation of the Ottoman Empire. While the American president decreed
that the Turkish portion of that empire should remain its own sovereign
state, “the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should
be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested
opportunity of autonomous development.” To Lawrence, as to most other
objective readers, that didn’t sound at all like the Sykes-Picot
Agreement, nor, for that matter, like the externally imposed Balfour
Declaration.</p>
<p>In his conversation with William Yale, Lawrence emphasized the
enormous esteem in which Arabs of all stripes held the United States.
Indeed, so forcefully did Lawrence hit on this note that in his summing
up of their conversation for Leland Harrison, Yale noted that the main
points “upon which all evidence is agreed, are the distrust of the Arabs
in the good faith of England and of France; the opposition to Zionism;
and the complete confidence of the Arabs in the United States.”</p>
<p>Idle flattery had never been one of Lawrence’s strong suits, and this
surely wasn’t the motive behind his message to the American agent.
Rather, as Yale wrote, “he declares that later, if things should not
turn out as well as is expected, and if there should be an imminent
danger of the disaffection of the Arabs, a declaration by the United
States concerning the future of the Arabs and their country would prove
to be a ‘trump card’ to play against the Turko-German propaganda, and he
feels that such a declaration would have an enormous effect upon the
Arabs.”</p>
<p>Perhaps lulled by Lawrence’s candor on other matters, Yale appears to
have accepted this argument at face value—or at least not pondered it
too deeply. If he had, he might have realized that such an American
declaration would be a far less effective tool against “Turko-German
propaganda”—after all, the United States was at war with Germany, so her
motives would naturally be suspect—than against the acquisitive
aspirations of America’s allies, Britain and France. In essence, and
while obviously of far less treasonable consequence than negotiating
with Turkey, Lawrence was looking to a foreign government as the vehicle
by which to undermine the policies of his own.</p>
<p>To that end, the time Lawrence carved out of his hectic Cairo
schedule to meet with William Yale would seem well spent. In the months
just ahead, the State Department’s special agent would increasingly urge
his government to take a more active role in Middle Eastern affairs, and
to stand with the Arabs against those who would subordinate them.</p>
<p>DURING THE SAME week that Yale and Lawrence were meeting in Cairo, on
the evening of March 14, about a dozen men gathered in a stateroom of SS
Canberra as it lay to its mooring in the Italian port city of Taranto.
Nine were members of a group called the Zionist Commission, while two
more were British government liaisons, or “minders,” tasked to both
facilitate and monitor that group’s work. The meeting was intended as a
kind of last-minute strategy session, for in the morning the Canberra, a
converted Australian steamship, would sail for Egypt, the starting point
of the Zionist Commission’s historic mission to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Framing the task before them was William Ormsby-Gore, the British
Conservative member of Parliament who had become an ardent convert to
Zionism, and who now served alongside Mark Sykes on the British War
Cabinet’s Near East Committee. In the four months since the Balfour
Declaration’s release, Arab opposition had only grown more strident. The
primary goal of the commission, Ormsby-Gore explained, was to assure the
leaders of both the Christian and Muslim Arab communities that they had
nothing to fear from a Jewish “national home” in Palestine.</p>
<p>Chaim Weizmann, the head of the delegation sailing to Egypt, then
bluntly laid out his “one leading principle” for the mission, “which was
that until the end of the war, the Arabs were a military asset to the
British government. After the war, they might become a liability.” In
short, now wasn’t the time to be confrontational with those who opposed
them. Rather, the goal was to mollify and to calm, to bide their time
and look for advantage in the future.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was hardly Aaron Aaronsohn’s vision of their
mission—but then he was only tangentially a member of the commission at
all. Back in London, there had been such fierce opposition to his
inclusion by some other committee members that his official status was
now that of a mere adjunct “agricultural expert,” and that only on the
insistence of American Zionist leaders like Louis Brandeis.</p>
<p>Part of this resistance stemmed from the revelations about his NILI
spy ring. That had sparked fierce debate within both the Zionist
community and international Jewry as a whole, with many accusing the spy
mastermind of having endangered the very existence of the Palestine
yeshuv through his actions. Just as worrisome, though, was the
scientist’s reputation for argumentativeness, for it was hard to imagine
a more exquisitely delicate diplomatic mission than that being
undertaken by the passengers on the Canberra.</p>
<p>At the same time that they attempted to calm Arab fears of a Jewish
takeover, the commission needed to unite the deeply fractious Jewish
community in Palestine under the Zionist banner. The best, perhaps only,
way to do this was to convince them of the dramatic changes soon to be
coming to Palestine in the wake of the Balfour Declaration—in other
words, nearly the precise opposite of what they would be telling the
Arabs. In addition to these constituencies were the British military and
political officials in the region. Even those favorably disposed toward
the Balfour Declaration tended to view it as an extraordinary
complication, a new British commitment to compete with those already
made to the Arabs and the French.</p>
<p>In the Canberra stateroom, Weizmann laid out with a broad brush how
this complex initiative was to proceed. Obviously, the favor of British
officials would be won or lost depending on whether the Zionists made
their lives less or more difficult, so the first task was to mollify the
Arabs. To this end, it would be publicly and repeatedly stated by the
commission—and by “commission” in this context, Chaim Weizmann was
referring specifically to Chaim Weizmann—that the Zionists had no
intention of trying to install a Jewish state in Palestine at the end of
the war, nor did they intend to start buying up land. To the contrary,
the Zionists fully supported the British authorities’ recent moratorium
on land sales in Palestine, and were only looking for the opportunity
for those Jews who wished to do so to return to the land of their
forebears, to engage in its political and economic development hand in
hand with the region’s other religious or ethnic communities.</p>
<p>This was to be the overt message, at least. As Weizmann went on to
explain, Zionist organizations needed to actively encourage Jewish
immigration to Palestine on a large scale, and to stockpile funds for
the purchase of land once the sales moratorium was lifted. Certainly
there was no backing away from the ultimate goal—the creation of a
Jewish state—but nothing to gain by acknowledging it publicly.</p>
<p>At least initially, this complicated dance was performed to great
effect. After an ecstatic welcome by the Jewish community in
Alexandria—hundreds of schoolchildren lined the wharf to sing the Hebrew
song “Hatikvah” (“The Hope”)—the Zionist Commission continued on to an
even warmer reception in Cairo. To both British officials and members of
the Syrian exile community in Egypt, Weizmann stressed time and again
the benign intentions of the Zionist cause. As Kincaid Cornwallis,
Gilbert Clayton’s deputy at the Arab Bureau, reported on April 20, the
Zionist leader told a delegation of Arabs known as the Syrian Committee
that “it was his ambition to see Palestine governed by some stable
Government like that of Great Britain, that a Jewish Government would be
fatal to his plans and that it was simply his wish to provide a home for
the Jews in the Holy Land where they could live their own national life,
sharing equal rights with the other inhabitants.” Further, Weizmann
assured his Arab listeners that the status of Muslim holy places would
remain inviolate, spoke with great sympathy of the Arab Revolt against
the Turks, and even suggested it was he who had pressed on the British
the land-buying moratorium. “Suspicion still remains in the minds of
some,” Cornwallis concluded his report, “but it is tempered by the above
considerations, and there is little doubt that it will gradually
disappear if the Commission continues its present attitude of
conciliation.”</p>
<p>Among those with an intimate view of this charm offensive was U.S.
State Department special agent William Yale. One of the Syrian Committee
leaders whom Weizmann repeatedly met with in Cairo was a man named
Suleiman Bey Nassif, who also happened to be one of the troika of
Jerusalem businessmen who had held the oil concessions purchased by
Standard Oil in 1914. Yale had stayed in close touch with Nassif since
coming to Cairo, and from the exiled businessman he received a detailed
account of those meetings with Weizmann. “On the whole,” Yale reported
to the State Department, “these conferences were a success, the Syrian
leaders came away from them with the impression that the Zionists did
not wish to impose a Jewish government in Palestine, and that the Jews
were coming to Palestine under conditions and with ideas that they could
accept.”</p>
<p>But if the Syrians were convinced, Yale harbored doubts. For one
thing, he found it odd that the Zionist Commission would soon be
traveling on to Palestine, their way facilitated by the British
government, while Nassif and his fellow Syrian Committee members
remained barred from the region. Yale’s suspicions deepened further when
he had a chat with Louis Meyer, the sole American “observer” delegate to
the commission.</p>
<p>Perhaps Meyer was another of those who didn’t fully appreciate the
duties of a State Department special agent, or maybe he was simply
lulled by the prospect of talking to a fellow American, but he went
decidedly off script in his meeting with William Yale. As Yale would
recall, “Meyer told me very directly that just because Weizmann was
currently disavowing any intention of creating a Jewish state in
Palestine, that didn’t imply that he was bound to that disavowal for the
future. Instead, the ultimate goal is a Jewish nation under either
British or American protection.”</p>
<p>As he probed further, Yale ascertained that the plans for that Jewish
nation were in fact quite well advanced. Indeed, within the Zionist
Commission was an ongoing debate over what should become of Palestine’s
Arab population once nationhood had been achieved, with those arguing
that “cheap Arab labor” was essential “to the growth and success of
Zionism” pitted against those who foresaw the day when non-Jews would
have to be expelled. In the end, Meyer opined, it came down to numbers,
that “as in the [American] south the white population would never submit
to a domination by the negroes, so a Jewish minority in Palestine would
never submit to a domination by an Arab majority.”</p>
<p>To the American intelligence agent, the commission increasingly
appeared to be a kind of political Potemkin village, and he took at
least a small measure of delight when the façade it was presenting to
the world suffered its first small tear. As might have been predicted,
that tear came at the hands of Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>Day after day in Cairo, Aaronsohn suffered in silence through the
interminable meetings and speeches to which the commission was
subjected, his frustration piqued just as much by the long-winded and
quarrelsome Jewish delegations as those of the Arabs. One protracted
session with a group of Jewish religious notables, in which Weizmann had
been forced to patiently explain why Zionism was not antireligious, had
almost proved too much; as Aaronsohn railed in his diary, “once again,
pearls have been thrown down in front of the pigs of the community.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the agronomist reached his breaking point at the worst
possible time, during a meeting with Suleiman Nassif’s Syrian Committee.
When one of the Arabs suggested that Jewish settlers tended to be
clannish and exclusively traded with their own, to the detriment of
Arabs, a furious Aaronsohn rose to denounce the charge as a lie.
Weizmann swiftly tried to defuse the situation, offering that while such
a lamentable state of affairs might well have occurred in the past,
steps would be taken to ensure it didn’t in the future. But Aaronsohn’s
public outburst cast an understandable pall over the gathering. “It is
to be hoped,” Yale wryly reported to the State Department, “that
Dr. Weizmann will keep Mr. Aaronsohn in the background in all the
[future] dealings of the Commission with the Arabs.”</p>
<p>Weizmann obviously thought along similar lines. At the next
conference with the same Syrian Committee a few days later, Aaronsohn
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of April 2, Lawrence and a small entourage of
bodyguards set out from Guweira, bound for the Syrian interior. It was
the first time Lawrence had been on a camel in over a month, and the
journey quickly lifted his spirits. “The abstraction of the desert
landscape cleansed me,” he wrote, “and rendered my mind vacant with its
superfluous greatness, a greatness achieved not by the addition of
thought to its emptiness, but by its subtraction. In the weakness of
earth’s life was mirrored the strength of heaven, so vast, so beautiful,
so strong.”</p>
<p>Pastoral splendor aside, this trek had been made necessary by a
worrisome feature on the map of Syria, one that called into question
General Allenby’s proposed march on Damascus. While the British army
held a strong and orderly line across the breadth of central Palestine,
an approximately thirty-mile span extending from the Mediterranean shore
above Jaffa all the way to the Jordan River, everything east of the
Jordan still lay in Turkish hands. This meant that the farther the
British pushed north for Damascus, the more exposed they would become to
a Turkish counterattack on their ever-lengthening eastern flank. This
danger would have been vastly reduced had the Moab Plateau been seized,
but, following Zeid’s sabotaging of that effort, British war planners
had come up with a new scheme, a preliminary operation to pave the way
for the main thrust on Damascus.</p>
<p>In consultation with Lawrence at those headquarters meetings in late
February, it had been decided that the three-thousand-man Arab army
encamped in Aqaba would storm the critical railhead town of Maan, just
thirty miles northeast of the Arabs’ forward headquarters at Guweira.
Both to mask that attack and to prevent Turkish reinforcements from
being rushed to Maan, a British cavalry force would simultaneously sweep
across the top of the Dead Sea, some 120 miles above Maan, to destroy
critical stretches of the Hejaz Railway in the vicinity of the town of
Amman. Once Maan was firmly in Arab hands, all Turkish troops to the
south, including those still holding Medina, would be permanently
stranded. By then turning their attention to the north, the Arab army
and British auxiliary forces could quickly clear the railway of all the
small Turkish outposts below Amman. If all went according to plan, the
British and their Arab allies would then have a unified east-west battle
line across almost the entire length of greater Syria, allowing for the
push on Damascus to commence.</p>
<p>The role chosen for Lawrence in this roll‑up operation was relatively
limited, but one for which he was uniquely qualified. As other British
advisors oversaw the principal engagement, the assault on Maan, he was
to take a small group of rebels one hundred miles north to a valley
known as Atatir. There he would join with other tribal forces to conduct
“worrying” raids against the Turks around Amman in conjunction with the
British cavalry raid coming from the west. With that raid tentatively
scheduled for early April, Lawrence had set out from Guweira a few days
ahead of time to get into place.</p>
<p>By April 6, his party had reached the valley of Atatir. In Lawrence’s
rendering, the place was like an Eden in the first burst of spring, its
hills and streambanks a riot of young sawgrass and wildflowers.
“Everything was growing,” he wrote, “and daily the picture was fuller
and brighter till the desert became like a rank water-meadow. Playful
packs of winds came crossing and tumbling over one another, their wide,
brief gusts surging through the grass, to lay it momentarily in swathes
of dark and light satin, like young corn after the roller.”</p>
<p>If Lawrence’s high spirits and focus on the beauty surrounding him
seemed a bit incongruous for a man preparing to go into battle, another
detail made it even more so. Just before setting out for Atatir, he had
learned that two of the men he’d left to guard the Azraq citadel had
died from cold over the brutally harsh winter. One was Daud, one of the
pair of camp imps Lawrence had taken on as his personal attendants six
months earlier. The bearer of that news had been Daud’s inseparable
companion, Farraj.</p>
<p>“These two had been friends from childhood,” Lawrence noted in Seven
Pillars, “in eternal gaiety, working together, sleeping together,
sharing every scrape and profit with the openness and honesty of perfect
love. So I was not astonished to see Farraj look dark and hard of face,
leaden-eyed and old, when he came to tell me that his fellow was dead,
and from that day till his service ended, he made no more laughter for
us.… The others offered themselves to comfort him, but instead he
wandered restlessly, gray and silent, very much alone.” Despite his
grief, or perhaps because of it, Farraj had joined Lawrence on the trek
north.</p>
<p>In Atatir, Lawrence received word from the British army—but it was
not at all what he’d expected to hear. According to the plan worked out
at headquarters, the mixed cavalry and infantry force, some twelve
thousand men in all, was to charge up from the Jordan valley to seize
the town of Salt, in the hills some ten miles west of Amman. From there,
a raiding party would continue on to destroy the most vulnerable points
on the Hejaz Railway—two high-spanning bridges and a tunnel—outside
Amman. But with the enemy apparently tipped to their plans, the attack
force had been met in Salt by entrenched units of German and Turkish
soldiers, and what was envisioned as a jaunt had turned into a bloody
two-day battle. When at last Salt was secured and the raiding party made
for the railway at Amman, the enemy had been waiting there, too, forcing
the British to turn back without achieving any of their principal
objectives. But then the news grew even worse: having suffered some two
thousand casualties, the British had been forced out of Salt and were
now scrambling back across the Jordan with the Turks in close
pursuit.</p>
<p>“It was thought that Jerusalem would be recovered [by the Turks],”
Lawrence wrote of the ever more ominous reports he received in Atatir.
“I knew enough of my countrymen to reject that possibility, but clearly
things were very wrong.” Worse than the physical defeat, though, was the
psychological effect it was likely to have on the Arabs. “Allenby’s plan
had seemed modest, and that we [British] should so fall down before the
Arabs was deplorable. They had never trusted us to do the great things
which I had foretold.” With the rout at Salt, those doubts were sure to
be deepened.</p>
<p>With nothing left to do around Amman, Lawrence turned south with
fifteen of his bodyguards to join in the ongoing assault of Maan—but the
ill-starred nature of this venture wasn’t over yet. The next day, in the
desert outside the hamlet of Faraifra, an eight-man Turkish foot patrol
was spotted haplessly trudging along the railway ahead. After their
fruitless mission north, Lawrence’s men begged for permission to attack
the outnumbered and exposed patrol. “I thought it too trifling,” he
recalled, “but when they chafed, agreed.”</p>
<p>As the Turks scurried to take cover in a railway culvert, Lawrence
dispatched his men into flanking positions. Too late, he noticed Farraj;
completely on his own, the young camp attendant had spurred his camel
and was charging directly at the enemy. As Lawrence watched, Farraj
abruptly drew his mount up beside the railway culvert; there was a shot,
and then Farraj fell from view. “His camel stood unharmed by the bridge,
alone,” Lawrence wrote. “I could not believe that he had deliberately
ridden up to them in the open and halted, yet it looked like it.”</p>
<p>When finally Lawrence and the others reached the culvert, they found
one Turkish soldier dead and Farraj horribly wounded, shot through the
side. With efforts to stanch his bleeding to no avail, Farraj’s
companions attempted to lift him onto a camel, even as the young man
begged to be left to die. The matter was rather decided when an alarm
went up that a Turkish patrol of some fifty soldiers was approaching
along the rails.</p>
<p>Knowing the hideous end the Turks often perpetrated on enemy
captives, Lawrence and his bodyguards had a tacit understanding to
finish off any of their number too badly wounded to travel. With Farraj,
this coup de grâce task fell to Lawrence. “I knelt down beside him,
holding my pistol near the ground by his head so that he should not see
my purpose, but he must have guessed it, for he opened his eyes and
clutched me with his harsh, scaly hand, the tiny hand of these unripe
Nejd fellows. I waited a moment, and he said, ‘Daud will be angry with
you,’ the old smile coming back so strangely to this gray shrinking
face. I replied, ‘salute him from me.’ He returned the formal answer,
‘God will give you peace,’ and at last wearily closed his eyes.”</p>
<p>After shooting Farraj, Lawrence remounted his camel, and he and his
entourage fled as the first Turkish bullets came for them.</p>
<p>Before the day was over, there was to be one more illustration of the
mercilessness of this war, and of Lawrence’s growing imperviousness to
it. That night, as the party camped a few miles away from Faraifra, an
argument developed over who should inherit Farraj’s prize camel.
Lawrence settled the dispute by drawing his pistol once more and
shooting the animal in the head. At dinner that night, they ate rice and
the camel’s butchered carcass. “Afterwards,” Lawrence noted, “we
slept.”</p>
<p>BY MID-APRIL 1918, Djemal Pasha was probably feeling quite sanguine
about the future. Defying the rumors of his political demise of just a
few months earlier, he remained very much a force within the shadowy CUP
(Committee of Union and Progress) leadership, just as respected and
feared as before. There was also heartening news from the battlefield.
On March 21, Germany had launched its massive offensive in France,
smashing through the Allied armies before them to make the greatest
territorial gains of any Western Front army since the beginning of the
war. Indeed, the first wave of that offensive, code-named Michael, had
only stalled because the advancing German forces had outrun their supply
lines. By April 13, a second offensive, Georgette, was closing on the
French coast and the vital seaports there. Suddenly it appeared Germany
just might succeed in defeating Britain and France before the incoming
Americans could rescue them.</p>
<p>And if Germany was currently experiencing great success on the
Western Front battlefield, Turkey wasn’t doing so badly on the Eastern.
Having first reclaimed those northeastern provinces that had been
occupied by Russia, in early February Turkish troops had taken advantage
of the continuing power vacuum brought about by Russia’s defeat to smash
into Armenia. By mid-April, those troops were preparing for the next
phase of operations, a sweep all the way to the shores of the Caspian
Sea and the fantastically rich oilfields of Baku. Rather like Djemal
Pasha himself, the Ottoman Empire had become like a strange
ever-mutating organism, shorn of influence and authority in one place
only to regain it in another.</p>
<p>Looking to the south, it could be argued that earning the displeasure
of international Zionism had produced unexpected benefits for Turkey.
The Balfour Declaration had won the Zionists to the British, but it had
come at the price of an enraged Arab world. That had allowed Djemal and
other Ottoman leaders to make appeals to a number of disenchanted Muslim
and Christian leaders in Syria, and even to the chief traitor himself,
King Hussein in the Hejaz. By mid-April, there were signs that this last
and most important overture was starting to bear fruit. As Djemal had
learned through his intermediaries in Syria, Hussein’s son Faisal had
recently responded to a Turkish peace offer by setting out demands of
his own. The two sides were still quite far apart, but if there was any
lesson to be learned from the musical-chairs game that World War I had
become, it was that everything was fluid, that what had been lost
yesterday might be recovered tomorrow. All that really mattered was who
won out in the end, and by April 1918 there could be no doubt that the
advantage lay with the Central Powers.</p>
<p>This was certainly an assessment shared by Curt Prüfer, who was also
in Constantinople that spring. In curious fashion, Germany’s improved
situation was allowing him to return to the first great conspiracy he
had been involved with, one that had long looked dead but was now
suddenly given new life.</p>
<p>For the past six months, Abbas Hilmi II, the deposed khedive of
Egypt, had occupied apartments on an upper floor of the Pera Palace
hotel in the city. There, he had joined that peculiar class of
aristocracy to be found in most every European capital during World War
I, the princelings and marquises and nawabs placed on ice by their
imperial patrons on the off chance that they might prove useful at some
point in the future. During that time, the task of keeping the former
khedive entertained and feeling important had largely fallen to Curt
Prüfer. In contrast to his more sober-minded duties as director of the
German intelligence bureau, dealing with Abbas and his eclectic
entourage was often more akin to babysitting. According to Prüfer
biographer Donald McKale, “He kept Abbas Hilmi’s bickering advisers, who
denounced each other as ‘English spies,’ under surveillance, and
counseled the ex-Khedive on his difficulties with his son, his three
former wives, and a French mistress.”</p>
<p>It’s clear, though, that the German intelligence chief also saw Abbas
Hilmi as a useful sounding board. Abbas derided the secret negotiations
with Faisal Hussein as quite pointless; the Constantinople clique would
never actually cede what Faisal was demanding, and Faisal surely knew
it. A much better solution, the ex-khedive opined, was for himself to
become ruler of Egypt and then fashion a quasi-independent Arab nation
with Hussein and Faisal—one on very friendly terms with Turkey and
Germany, Hilmi undoubtedly hastened to add.</p>
<p>That had been so much idle talk in the autumn of 1917, but by early
1918 what had seemed far-fetched, even delusional, took on the patina of
possibility. By then, the first reliable reports of civic unrest in
Egypt were reaching the outside world, with the normally quiescent
population enraged by Britain’s draconian martial law rule, as well as
by the Balfour Declaration and Sykes-Picot Agreement. Then, of course,
had come the final collapse of Russia, the string of battlefield
successes by Germany and Turkey, the increasing signs that the Arab
rebels in Arabia and Syria might be looking for a way out of their
alliance with the duplicitous British. For all these reasons, by that
April, the idea that Abbas Hilmi II might somehow ascend to the Egyptian
throne didn’t seem so crazy after all—and if that happened, Curt
Prüfer’s patient ministrations at the Pera Palace might pay spectacular
dividends for Germany.</p>
<p>Abbas clearly sensed his stock rising, too, so much so that he
resurrected a long-cherished goal, one he had first put to Max von
Oppenheim three years earlier but which had been consistently denied
him. As he informed Curt Prüfer, before anything could be decided about
Egypt, he needed to meet with the kaiser. Somewhat nonplussed, Prüfer
said he would see what he could do.</p>
<p>WHEN LAWRENCE MET General Allenby for afternoon tea on May 15, both
men were at a low ebb.</p>
<p>After his fruitless trek to Atatir, Lawrence had hurried down to join
the Arab assault on the railhead town of Maan. By the time he got there
on April 13, operations were already under way.</p>
<p>The order of battle had called for the attackers to first strike at
Maan’s outlying guardhouses in hopes of luring the main Turkish garrison
out of its entrenched positions around the railway station. Initially
the operation had proceeded as planned, with one outer-ring Turkish post
after another falling to the rebels. On April 17, however, the Iraqi
commander of the Arab army, tiring of the extended waiting game,
overruled the counsel of his British advisors to order a frontal assault
on the train depot. The approach proved just as futile at Maan as it had
on a thousand other World War I battlefields. “There was nothing to do,”
Lawrence wrote, “but see our men volleyed out of the railway station
again. The road was littered with crumpled khaki figures.”</p>
<p>Lawrence had stayed on in the Maan area for several more days,
assisting other British officers in railway destruction operations to
the south, but the battle for the crucial railway town had already been
decided by that futile frontal attack. While British military
communiqués made much of the damage done to the Hejaz Railway below
Maan—with some sixty miles of track torn up, the Turkish garrison in
Medina was now stranded for good—it was a paltry achievement when
measured against the offensive’s objectives.</p>
<p>But even more dispiriting news had awaited Lawrence when he reached
Allenby’s headquarters in Ramleh on May 2. Over the previous six weeks,
Allied forces on the Western Front had only barely withstood two massive
German offensives. In anticipation of a third, Allenby had been ordered
to stand to the defense and to release tens of thousands of his best
frontline troops for service in France. It meant there was to be no push
on Damascus, that all the losses of the previous month—the failed
British cavalry raid on Salt, the disastrous frontal assault at Maan,
the death of Farraj in the desert—had been for naught. To top things
off, just prior to Lawrence’s arrival in Ramleh, the same British
cavalry commander who’d been thrown out of Salt the first time had
decided to have another go; by May 2, and after another fifteen hundred
casualties, the last stragglers of this fresh British defeat were
drifting back across the front lines.</p>
<p>All of which meant that by the time of Lawrence’s next visit to
headquarters and his tea with General Allenby on May 15, both men had
been forced to acknowledge that the prospects of a breakthrough on the
Syrian front were just as distant as ever—in fact, a good deal more
distant, for in the interval since Lawrence’s last trip to headquarters,
Allenby’s army had been poached a second time by the Western Front
generals. All told, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now slated to
lose some sixty thousand soldiers for service in France, about half of
its frontline strength, and while London had committed to covering those
losses with troops brought over from Iraq and India, it meant the Syrian
front would be dormant for many months to come.</p>
<p>But during that tea, and amid describing the massive reorganization
his army was currently undergoing, Allenby happened to mention the
Imperial Camel Corps. This was an elite unit that had been sitting idle
in the Sinai for the past six months, and the general now planned to
convert it into a conventional horse-mounted cavalry and discard its
camels.</p>
<p>From the very outset of the Syrian campaign, the greatest logistical
hurdle facing the Arab rebels had been a shortage of both transport and
riding camels, a problem that had only grown worse as the size and scope
of operations expanded. Because of that shortage, supply lines were
always stretched to the breaking point, proposed actions scaled back or
canceled outright for lack of mounts. What’s more, the frequent
camel-purchasing forays of Lawrence and other British officers had
depleted the available stock throughout the region, leading to
extortionate prices for the few decent animals left. Now, with the
proposed disbanding of the Imperial Camel Corps (ICC), some two thousand
of the finest riding mounts in the entire Middle East would suddenly
become available.</p>
<p>To Lawrence, it raised an obvious question: “What are you going to do
with their camels?” he asked Allenby.</p>
<p>Allenby laughed. “Ask Q.”</p>
<p>“Q” was the British quartermaster general, who explained that the
camels had been promised to an incoming Indian army division for use as
transport. The quartermaster general flatly rejected Lawrence’s appeals,
but Allenby was swayed by his argument that using these prize animals
for mere transport would be a colossal waste. At dinner that evening,
the commander in chief asked Lawrence how, if given the ICC mounts, he
proposed to use them.</p>
<p>Lawrence had, of course, anticipated the question. In addition, he
divined a silver lining to the British cavalry’s ill-fated second attack
on Salt. As a result of that failure, the Turks would now be convinced
that any future British attack would probably come at that same
spot—after all, repeatedly smashing up against the enemy’s strongest
points had become something of a British World War I tradition by
now—and align their troops accordingly. With the Turks concentrating
their forces in the Salt-Amman region, it would allow Lawrence,
utilizing the new ICC camels from his desert hideout in Azraq, to strike
behind the enemy’s lines and over a wide range of targets. These
included the most vital target in all of lower Syria: the railhead town
of Deraa, the junction of the principal lifeline of the Turkish forces
facing the British in Palestine. At the headquarters dinner table,
Lawrence gave Allenby his reply: “To put a thousand men into Deraa any
day you please.”</p>
<p>While those men might not be able to permanently hold Deraa, Lawrence
explained, they would certainly have time to blow up the crucial
railroad bridges in Yarmuk, leaving the Turkish forces in Palestine
virtually cut off from supply or reinforcement. At this, Allenby turned
to the quartermaster general and shook his head in mock sadness: “Q, you
lose.”</p>
<p>With the promise of the ICC camels, Lawrence rushed back to Faisal’s
headquarters. The news had an electrifying effect on the warrior
chieftains gathered there, for the “gift” of the two thousand
thoroughbreds meant the Arabs could finally take their revolt to the far
north in a substantive way. No longer would they be limited to sniping,
hit-and-run attacks; by putting enough mounted fighters in the field,
they could storm and hold population centers.</p>
<p>It also meant—and this had been a crucial aspect of Lawrence’s
thinking—that the Arabs might loosen the British tether. It would still
be some time before the ICC camels were delivered, and then they would
need to be acclimated to the harder forage of Syria, but within two or
three months’ time, the Arab rebels wouldn’t have to rely on the actions
of the British, now stalemated in Palestine. Instead, they could take
their war into the Syrian heartland independently, and with that
independence would come the chance to snatch Syria for themselves. It
was, Lawrence wrote, “a regal gift, the gift of unlimited mobility. The
Arabs could now win their war when and where they liked.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SINCE ARRIVING IN Cairo, Aaron Aaronsohn had fallen into a dark and
downcast mood. Part of it may have stemmed from his marginalized role
with the Zionist Commission, the unseemly manner with which he’d been
relegated to the sidelines, but his return to the region after a
seven-month absence also made fresh the tragedy that had befallen his
NILI organization. In Cairo, he was reunited with two of his brothers,
Alex and Sam, and from them he learned more details of their sister’s
ghastly end. Particularly enraging to the agronomist was how Sarah and
the other NILI members had been essentially handed over by their own
kind, the Zichron Yaakov Committee going so far as to post a bounty on
the head of the NILI fugitive Joseph Lishansky. Zichron still lay well
behind Turkish lines in the spring of 1918, but in contemplating his
return there, Aaronsohn noted in his diary that “if I should seek
revenge on all the cowards and scoundrels, there would be hardly a half
dozen people with whom I could shake hands.”</p>
<p>More than anger, though, the memory of Sarah, or Sarati, and his
fallen best friend, Absalom Feinberg, seemed to act as a kind of
haunting presence on the scientist, constantly intruding on his
thoughts. On one occasion, for example, he had been flabbergasted to see
William Ormsby-Gore put a telephone call through to Jerusalem. “To
telephone from Cairo to Jerusalem!” he marveled in his diary. “If only
Sarati and Absa could have lived to see that!”</p>
<p>This haunting only grew worse when the Zionist Commission left Egypt
for Palestine at the beginning of April. Aboard the night train taking
them past Gaza, a solitary Aaronsohn stood by a window to stare out at
the passing countryside. Ever the agronomist, he took note of the poor
state of the fields—“very little winter cereals, and of a poor
quality”—while observing that nothing appeared to have really changed in
his two-year absence. “Still,” he noted, “we travel by train—and we are
with the English! Absa, Absa, where are you? Sarati?”</p>
<p>But also to grow worse in Palestine was Aaronsohn’s pariah status. At
one banquet honoring the visiting commission, a group of local Jewish
elders refused to sit with the man who had “endangered the Yishuv”
through his spying activities. At several other meetings with Jewish
delegations, Aaronsohn was excoriated for the alleged strong-arm tactics
he had displayed in disbursing international relief funds in the early
days of the war. One of the few times any gratitude was shown him came
during a welcoming ceremony in the Jewish enclave of Tel Aviv in Jaffa,
the same community whose purported plight he had publicized following
Djemal Pasha’s evacuation order. As hundreds of young members of the
Maccabean Society, a Jewish civic organization, serenaded the visiting
commission members, Chaim Weizmann leaned to Aaronsohn’s side. “Well,
Aaron,” Weizmann said, “you have a great share in all this—and you paid
a big price.”</p>
<p>That moment was an anomaly, however. Weizmann’s mission to Palestine
was far too sensitive to allow for discord, whereas Aaronsohn was a man
loath to ever turn the other cheek. After a commission member took
Aaronsohn aside to urge that he bridge over a dispute he was having with
one Jewish settlement delegation, the scientist haughtily replied that
“to bridge it over would mean to establish social relations which are
repugnant to me. If my attitude is not prudent, fine.”</p>
<p>With Aaronsohn’s feuds extending even to other commission members,
Weizmann steadily pushed the agronomist further to the periphery. At
times, quite literally; in the group photographs taken of the commission
during their time in Palestine, Aaronsohn is usually seen standing off
to one side—when included in the portraits at all. By the end of April,
he had effectively parted ways to go off and work on a project of his
own.</p>
<p>Ironically, that venture was to produce perhaps the most tangible
result of the commission’s trip, for by late May, Aaronsohn had
completed a remarkable blueprint for agricultural development in
southern Palestine. In the papers and maps he passed to Windham Deedes
at the Arab Bureau was the proposal to quickly put some quarter million
acres of uncultivated and “Crown” (held by the Turkish government) land
under the plow to help ease the continuing wartime food shortages. Under
Aaronsohn’s scheme, the project would be placed under British military
control, but with the farming done by Jewish settlers and funding
provided by Zionist banks; the Zionist Commission pledged at least a
half million pounds. In its execution, all would benefit: food would be
provided to the destitute, so the Arabs would see the material advantage
of an increased Jewish presence in Palestine, and the prospect of a
decent life would entice more Jews to come.</p>
<p>Of course, once the period of military administration ended, perhaps
four or five years, title to the quarter million acres would pass to the
Zionists. But as Gilbert Clayton sunnily opined to the Foreign Office in
voicing his support for Aaronsohn’s plan, “a small favor granted to one
community can easily [be] counterbalanced by similar privileges afforded
to the others and thus, in the normal course of administration, gradual
progress can be made without causing friction and discontent.”</p>
<p>Even with the contribution of his land scheme, however, Aaronsohn
remained an outcast with the Zionist Commission—and what held for that
panel quite naturally extended to its British benefactors. At the end of
May, when General Allenby held a state dinner in Jerusalem for the
soon-departing commission, the only associate not invited was Aaron
Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>TO SKIRT ORDERS with which he disagreed, Lawrence frequently relied
on an old standby of Victorian literature: the message that goes missing
or isn’t delivered in time. This ruse had been denied him when it came
to the British effort to force an entente between the Arab rebel leaders
and the Zionists; in this sphere, Lawrence could only delay or impede at
the edges. Back in February 1918, when Gilbert Clayton had ordered
Lawrence to press Faisal on the matter, his subordinate had replied that
he hoped to arrange a Faisal visit to Jerusalem in the near future, and
“all the Jews there will report him friendly. That will probably do all
you need, without public commitment, which is rather beyond my
province.”</p>
<p>For an army major to tell a brigadier general what his needs were and
the limits he would go in supplying them was no more acceptable in 1918
than it is today, but Clayton apparently accepted Lawrence’s response
with equanimity; he surely calculated that even this partial compliance
to his order was better than nothing, since there was simply no one else
in the British command with Lawrence’s influence on Faisal.</p>
<p>Lawrence changed tactics somewhat when Clayton returned to the topic
in May. In light of the continuing suspicions that Chaim Weizmann and
his commission were encountering among the Arab population in Palestine,
Weizmann had proposed a meeting between him and Faisal. The British
leadership in Palestine had heartily embraced the idea and, on May 22,
Clayton sent a telegram to Lawrence in Aqaba seeking his counsel. “What
arrangements do you suggest?” the general asked. “I am of opinion you
should be present at interview.… Let us have your views on above points
at an early date, please.”</p>
<p>Lawrence certainly received the message—he was in Aqaba the following
day—but there is no record of his answering. On May 24, with the
timetable for Weizmann’s proposed visit now firmed up—he was scheduled
to sail for Aqaba in just five days—another secret cable was fired off,
this time from Allenby’s headquarters to the attention of the overall
Aqaba base commander. “Interview would take place at Arab headquarters
to which they would motor. Wire if this is convenient to Sherif Faisal
and Lawrence. It is important latter should be present at interview.
Urgent reply requested.”</p>
<p>Once again, Lawrence was most certainly informed of this cable, but
he still didn’t respond. Instead, on May 27, with Weizmann’s arrival in
Aqaba imminent, he found reason to depart on another reconnaissance
mission to the north, conveniently falling out of easy communication
until Weizmann had come and gone.</p>
<p>In his absence, the meeting between Faisal and the British Zionist
leader took place on the afternoon of June 4. It was an amicable and
pleasant enough encounter, with Weizmann ostentatiously donning an Arab
headdress for the occasion, even as Faisal avoided committing himself to
anything of much substance, arguing that ultimate authority lay with his
father in Mecca, and that matters in Syria remained far too unsettled to
start getting into specifics. Still, Weizmann was very satisfied by the
talk, as were British officials. As Clayton would report to the Foreign
Office after receiving a detailed report of the meeting, “In my opinion,
the interview has had excellent results in promoting mutual sympathy and
understanding between Weizmann and Faisal. Both are frank and open in
their dealings, and a personal interview such as has now taken place can
result in nothing but the good.”</p>
<p>That assessment was unlikely to be shared by Lawrence, who returned
to Aqaba from his reconnaissance mission on June 8, four days after the
Faisal-Weizmann meeting. To him, this British-imposed concord could only
provide more ammunition to Faisal’s—and by extension Hussein’s—rivals in
the Arab world.</p>
<p>But again, there was little to do about it. The British weren’t going
to walk back from Balfour. Any pressure the Americans might bring to
bear in pursuit of Wilson’s Fourteen Points plan wouldn’t come until a
peace conference, their influence on Middle Eastern affairs in the
meantime resting somewhere between nil and nonexistent. As for the Arabs
striking out on their own, the mounts of the Imperial Camel Corps had
yet to be delivered, and even when they were, it would be some time
before they had sufficiently acclimated to the Syrian landscape for
large-scale operations. Of course, there was one more possibility: a
rapprochement with the Turks. By coincidence, Faisal had received
another secret message from General Mehmet Djemal just two days before
Weizmann showed up in Aqaba.</p>
<p>In fact, Faisal’s flirtation with the Turkish general was not unknown
to senior British officials. Back in late March, a spy had given
Reginald Wingate a copy of Faisal’s note to Mehmet Djemal outlining his
terms for negotiations. “It is difficult to say how much importance
should be attached to this correspondence,” Wingate informed the Foreign
Office, “and it would be inadvisable to enquire directly from Emir
Faisal as to his motives.… [But] it confirms my suspicion that Sharif
leaders, depressed by general military situation and doubt of Allies’
policies in Palestine and Syria, are putting out feelers to ascertain
Turkish official opinion about future of Arab countries.”</p>
<p>To their credit, those Foreign Office officials apprised of this news
reacted with a refreshing lack of hypocrisy. After all, several pointed
out, Britain was unofficially negotiating with some half dozen Turkish
emissaries in Switzerland, so it would be a bit unseemly for them to
take umbrage at others doing so. Instead, and at Mark Sykes’s first
suggestion, they set themselves to the task of neutralizing the threat
in gentlemanly fashion: by bestowing Faisal with a medal. Over the next
several months, a host of senior British officials weighed in on the
debate over just what commendation might sufficiently impress the Arab
rebel leader to ensure his loyalty.</p>
<p>Curiously, one of Faisal’s strongest defenders had been Gilbert
Clayton, who hastened to inform the Foreign Office in early April that
the charge of treachery against Faisal appeared based on a
misunderstanding, that the thrust of his overture to Mehmet Djemal
seemed actually directed at an Arab-Turk reconciliation in the postwar
era. Nonetheless, Clayton had urged, London should avail herself of this
opportunity “to cement the Arab Alliance with Great Britain by all
possible means.” Those means included recognizing Faisal’s authority in
all territories east of the Jordan River, and compelling the French “to
give an authoritative statement” relinquishing her claims to greater
Syria. But perhaps Clayton’s generous view of Faisal’s actions wasn’t so
curious given his source; as Clayton noted to the Foreign Office, he had
been provided this interpretation—and perhaps his list of
recommendations, too—by Major T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The precise role Lawrence played in the secret negotiations between
Faisal and the Turks has never been made clear; much like the timing of
his disclosure to Faisal about Sykes-Picot, Lawrence seemed to
appreciate that he was on very delicate legal ground, and gave vague and
contradictory answers on the matter to his early biographers. What is
clear is that he saw in those negotiations a powerful potential weapon
to use against his government, a reminder that should the Arabs be
betrayed, they had somewhere else to go.</p>
<p>“At the present day,” Mehmet Djemal’s new letter of June 2 began,
“the Ottoman government, the mightiest representative of Islam, has
obtained supremacy over the greatest enemies of the Mohammedan religion.
I am persuaded that I am honoring the Prophet’s name by inviting His
most excellent and noble grandson [Faisal] to participate in the
protection of Islam for, by ensuring the supremacy of the Turkish army,
a safe and happy life will be obtained for all true believers.” The
general had closed by proposing a meeting with Faisal in four days’
time, during which “I feel sure that we shall be able to fulfill the
wishes of all Arabs.”</p>
<p>Faisal didn’t take up the offer of a face-to-face meeting, but did
send another reply. In that unsigned letter, he again proposed that all
Turkish troops below Amman be withdrawn, and further suggested that
Syria’s future relationship with Turkey be modeled along the lines of
the loose federation existing between Austria and Hungary. If that still
left matters a bit vague, Faisal’s other preconditions didn’t: all Arab
soldiers in the Turkish army were to be released for service in the Arab
army, and “if the Arab and Turkish Armies fight side by side against the
enemy, the Arab Army is to be under its own Commander.” This was no
longer talk of a mere rapprochement—and certainly not one in the postwar
era—but rather of an Arab-Turkish military alliance against the Allies.
By best evidence, Faisal sent his offer to Mehmet Djemal from Aqaba no
later than June 10. For the two days preceding, he had been joined in
Aqaba by T. E. Lawrence. It wasn’t until that same day of June 10 that
Lawrence boarded SS Arethusa in Aqaba harbor, bound for Cairo and more
consultations with the British military hierarchy.</p>
<p>The mark of a master strategist is his or her utter adaptability to
circumstance, the pursuit of advantage divorced from sentiment. Whether
or not Lawrence had a hand in writing Faisal’s latest note to Mehmet
Djemal, just days later he went into conference with the man he’d
managed to avoid meeting in Aqaba: Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>By all accounts, those talks were very cordial. Weizmann was
certainly keyed to the fact that it was upon this mid-ranking British
officer that the success or failure of his appeal to the Arab Revolt
leaders largely rested. And as one gamesman to another, Lawrence was
surely impressed by the Zionist leader’s agility in navigating the
political minefield of Palestine, the considerable success he’d had in
calming Arab concerns with one set of talking points while galvanizing
the Jewish population to Zionism with another. Perhaps not surprisingly,
the two master strategists soon found their way to common ground.</p>
<p>It was a common ground rooted in mutual dependence. To gain a
“national home” in Palestine, the Jews obviously needed the British to
win the war, which also meant they needed to support the Arab Revolt. In
his meeting with Faisal, Weizmann had offered to employ the
international Zionist movement in promotion of the cause of Arab
independence, and with Lawrence in Ramleh, Weizmann got more specific:
that promotion could also extend to funds and military training for the
Arabs to fight the Turks. For his part, Lawrence saw a potentially
pivotal role the Zionists might play in a postwar Syria. As he noted in
a secret June 16 report on his meeting with Weizmann, “as soon as Faisal
is in possession of [greater Syria], the [landowner] effendi class, the
educated class, the Christians and the foreign elements will turn
against him.… If the British and American Jews, securely established
under British colors in Palestine, chose this moment to offer to the
Arab State in Syria help … Sherif Faisal would be compelled to accept.”
With that help, Faisal could “dispense with” his domestic opposition.
Better yet, given the Zionists’ deep-rooted suspicions of the French,
Faisal would have a ready ally in neutralizing them as well.</p>
<p>That was all in the future, though. In the interim, Lawrence
counseled the Foreign Office, the Arabs should neither seek nor accept
Zionist aid, nor should Weizmann be given the meeting he urgently
sought, an audience with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s apparent conversion on the Zionist issue had a gladdening
effect on his superiors, even if there was a marked limit to that
conversion. Whether due to naiveté or studied wishful thinking, most
British officials in the region who had dealt with Chaim Weizmann over
the past three months had taken at face value his soothing vision of a
Jewish community in Palestine living in political and economic harmony
with the Arab majority. As one schemer sitting across the table from
another, however, Lawrence saw through this almost immediately. As he
noted in his June 16 report, “Dr. Weizmann hopes for a completely Jewish
Palestine in fifty years, and a Jewish Palestine, under a British
façade, for the moment.”</p>
<p>Lawrence would only be wrong about the timetable; it was to be just
thirty years until the British façade fell away and the state of Israel
created, with Chaim Weizmann installed as its first president.</p>
<p>AS HIS TIME in Cairo extended, William Yale chafed under two enduring
frustrations. The first was looking for any sign that his government was
actually paying attention to events in the Middle East. Every Monday
since late October 1917, he had been sending his long dispatches to
Leland Harrison at the State Department, and hearing nothing back save
for a handful of terse cables. Even his appeals for guidance—were his
reports boring his readers? did the secretary want him to pursue another
line of inquiry?—were met with silence.</p>
<p>Yale’s second frustration was more personal, his inability to gain
British permission to visit the war front. In their meeting of early
March, T. E. Lawrence had invited him to visit the Arab rebel base at
Aqaba, but Yale’s request to that end had vanished somewhere in the
British bureaucratic ether. With the Zionist Commission preparing to
embark on its fact-finding mission to Palestine, Yale had petitioned to
accompany it, only to be told by Gilbert Clayton that “there might be
some difficulty” with the plan. He had even broached the idea of
attaching himself to a delegation of the American Red Cross Commission;
alas, that nongovernmental organization hadn’t warmed to the prospect of
providing cover for an American intelligence agent. Really the only way
to Palestine, Reginald Wingate patiently explained to the American
embassy, was for Yale to be classified as a military liaison officer and
accredited to General Allenby’s staff—which, since Yale wasn’t in the
military and never had been, was a diplomatic way of keeping him right
where he was, sitting in Cairo.</p>
<p>Rather by default, then, Yale had focused his energies on what was
arguably the more important task before him: getting the Wilson
administration to realize what was at stake in the region. This was
easier said than done, for despite Wilson’s high-minded Fourteen Points
proclamation, from what Yale could determine, “our government had no
policy. It was fighting, ostensibly, for nebulous ideals, little
realizing that events are determined not at peace conferences, but by
actions during hostilities preceding the peacemaking process.… The ‘deus
ex machina’ of international affairs is not he who waits to act at some
dramatic crisis, but he who consistently acts in ways which are
constantly determining the course of events. President Wilson and his
advisors never seemed to realize this simple truism.”</p>
<p>The bitter paradox in this situation—and the source of Yale’s
frustration—was that by the late spring of 1918, most of the interested
parties in the Middle East were clamoring for the Americans to determine
events. As early as October 1917, Reginald Wingate had floated to an
American diplomat the proposition that the United States take over the
“mandate” of Palestinian rule in the postwar world, an idea that had
continued to gain currency at the British Foreign Office. If to rather
different ends, the hope of spurring American involvement had clearly
been the subtext of Lawrence’s emphasis during his meeting with Yale on
the Arabs’ high regard for the United States. Chaim Weizmann and the
Zionists made no secret that, barring a British mandate, they’d be quite
happy with an American one. Even the more imperialist-minded politicians
of Britain and France and Italy appeared increasingly willing to accept
a broad American role in the region since, barring their gaining of new
lands, the most desirable outcome was that their European “friends” not
gain any either.</p>
<p>To Yale, however, the truly decisive factor was the burgeoning
pro-American sentiment of the Arabs. While undoubtedly sparked by the
promises contained in Wilson’s Fourteen Points, this attitude was also a
fairly logical result of contemplating the morass of claims waiting to
envelop the region in the postwar era. Yale’s old friend Suleiman Bey
Nassif fairly typified these concerns. A moderate Arab Christian,
Nassif, even as he had reconciled to an expanded Jewish presence in
Syria, remained deeply suspicious of British intentions, leery of King
Hussein’s pan-Arab nation, and adamantly opposed to French designs. The
best, perhaps only way out of this mess, Nassif explained to Yale, was
for the Americans—nonimperialist, idealistic, far enough away to be
minimally irritating—to step into the breach.</p>
<p>Yale wholeheartedly agreed, but looking for the right button to push
with the Wilson administration was a grinding task; at one point, he
even tried for base economic self-interest, pointing out to Harrison
that “it is a well-known fact that certain American oil interests have
recently obtained from the Ottoman Government extensive properties in
Palestine,” one of the rare instances, presumably, when an intelligence
agent was moved to inform on his own prior activities.</p>
<p>Finally, in late April, after months of extolling America’s standing
in the region to the State Department, Yale decided to act. It came
after he met a man named Faris Nimr, a leader of the Syrian exile
community in Cairo and the editor in chief of the hugely influential
Egyptian newspaper al-Mokattam. As Yale explained to Leland Harrison,
ever since the United States had joined the war, Nimr and a small cabal
of like-minded Syrian exiles had looked to it as their homeland’s
potential savior. “Quietly these few men have been spreading the idea of
a sort of protectorate over Syria by the United States among the Syrians
in Egypt, endeavoring to do this as secretly as possible that neither
the British nor the French might become aware of it. This is an idea
that appeals to both Christian and to Moslem.… It is stated by these
ardent partisans of America that all the factions and all the parties
among the Syrians would not only unite on the question of aid from the
United States, but would rejoice if such were possible.”</p>
<p>While waiting for Harrison’s response to this message, Yale received
a bit of gladdening news from Washington on another matter. It had been
decided to send a second special agent out to the Middle East, and once
that man arrived in Egypt, it would be arranged for Yale to go on to
Palestine. The name of his Cairo replacement, William Brewster, was very
familiar to Yale; Brewster had been the Standard Oil representative in
Aleppo at the same time that Yale worked for them in Jerusalem. Thus,
while doubling the size of their intelligence network in the Middle
East, the American government had ensured it remained within the
Standard Oil recruiting pool.</p>
<p>With Brewster en route, Yale was hastily appointed a captain in
something called “the National Army”; perhaps not wishing to appear
churlish after their months of stonewalling, British authorities
declined to inquire just what this curious entity might be—the official
name of the American army en route to Europe was the American
Expeditionary Force—and instead congratulated the American agent on his
military appointment.</p>
<p>“As soon as Cairo tailors could make uniforms for me,” Yale
recounted, “I began to prepare myself to be a soldier among soldiers. I
had very little military training [actually none] and knew nothing about
military matters and etiquette. For days I walked the side streets of
Cairo in my new uniform, practicing saluting on passing British Tommies.
When they began to salute me automatically, with no smirks on their
faces, I knew I was on the way to being a soldier.”</p>
<p>It was all in preparation for an occasion the newly minted captain
rather dreaded, his formal presentation to General Allenby. In mid-July,
Yale and the new American consul to Egypt, Hampson Gary, took advantage
of a brief home visit by Allenby to make the journey up to his office in
Alexandria. “When we entered Allenby’s study,” Yale recalled, “I did not
know whether or not to salute the General. I wondered whether I should
stand at attention or sit down. The worry was needless, for General
Allenby paid as much attention to me as though I was not there.”</p>
<p>The climactic moment came when Allenby abruptly turned in Yale’s
direction and, in his practiced stentorian voice, boomed, “Well, Captain
Yale, what are you going to do at my headquarters?”</p>
<p>“I am going to continue my political work, General Allenby,” he
replied.</p>
<p>Wrong answer. “Captain Yale,” the general bellowed, “if the United
States government wishes to send a butcher to my headquarters, that’s
their privilege, [but] you will remember when you are attached to my
forces, you are a soldier!” Chastened, the American visitors soon beat a
retreat, with Yale convinced that “Allenby had classed me, a former
Standard Oil man, as one of those lower forms of life who engage in
trade.”</p>
<p>The next day, Yale boarded a troop train for Palestine and his new
billet at the British army headquarters at Bir-es-Salem, about ten miles
east of Jaffa. He found reserved for him there a small tent, a cot, a
writing table, and a canvas washbasin and bath. Also awaiting him was
that peculiar feature of the European military officer class of 1918,
the batman, or personal valet. Among British officers, the most coveted
batmen were Indian army soldiers drawn from units specifically trained
for the task, but possibly in retaliation for his importune reply to
Allenby, Yale’s was a grizzled old Scotsman.</p>
<p>Despite the rustic nature of his new surroundings, Yale was
undoubtedly pleased to be out of Cairo and away from a job that had
seemed increasingly futile. Shortly before leaving for the front, he had
finally heard back from the State Department in regard to the message he
had sent about Faris Nimr and his cell of pro-American Syrian
conspirators fully two months earlier. If not for prompt reply, his
message had been deemed important enough to go up to the desk of the
secretary of state himself. “Referring your report No. 28,” read
Secretary Lansing’s cable of July 9, “continue noncommittal attitude
relative American attitude towards Syria.”</p>
<p>THE NEWS CAME to Lawrence as a jolt, but an exceedingly pleasant one.
On June 18, he and Lieutenant Colonel Alan Dawnay, the new overall
coordinator of operations in northern Arabia, went to General
Headquarters to outline the plan for the Arabs’ independent advance into
Syria. They met there with General William Bartholomew, one of Allenby’s
chief deputies. Bartholomew listened to their presentation for a few
minutes before shaking his head with a smile; as he told his visitors,
they had come to Ramleh three days too late.</p>
<p>As Dawnay and Lawrence soon learned, what had transpired in Palestine
over the previous month was one of the very rare instances in World War
I when an army had been readied for combat operations ahead of schedule.
In recent weeks, a steady flood of British and Indian army troops had
arrived from Iraq and the subcontinent, taking the place of those
Allenby had been forced to send on to Europe, and tremendous effort had
been made in getting these troops into the line and swiftly integrated
with the rest of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. So successful had
this push been that at a senior staff meeting at headquarters on June
15, it was concluded the army would be “capable of a general and
sustained offensive” into the Syrian heartland as early as
September.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, it meant there was now no reason for the Arabs to risk
an unsupported advance into Syria. Instead, with Allenby’s timetable
closely matching that devised by Lawrence and Dawnay for the Arabs, the
rebels could simply dovetail their operations with those of the EEF. Of
course, timetables had a way of getting upended in the Middle East, so
Lawrence was greatly relieved when on a subsequent visit to headquarters
on July 11 he learned a firm launch date for the EEF offensive had been
chosen: September 19.</p>
<p>In the interim, a political development had made the prospect of re-
attaching the Arabs to the British effort even more attractive. In early
May, a group of seven Syrian exile leaders claiming to represent a broad
spectrum of Syrian society had written an open letter demanding to know
in clear and unequivocal language precisely what Great Britain and
France envisioned for their nation’s future. London and Paris had tried
to ignore the so-called Seven Syrians letter for as long as possible,
but this time international attention wouldn’t allow it; the matter had
finally been dropped into the laps of the two men most responsible for
the enduring controversy, Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot. After
much back-and-forth, in mid-June Sykes and Picot had answered the Seven
Syrians that in those lands “emancipated from Turkish control by the
action of the Arabs themselves during the present war,” Britain and
France would “recognize the complete and sovereign independence of the
Arabs inhabiting those areas and support them in their struggle for
freedom.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence, here, finally, was the reaffirming of the promise of
independence that he and the Arab rebels had been seeking for so long.
But the formulation also reaffirmed the caveat that Lawrence had always
suspected lay beneath the surface: Arab independence was only guaranteed
in those lands that the Arabs freed themselves. In light of this, the
rebels had every reason to join the coming British offensive. After his
consultations at headquarters on July 11, Lawrence hurried back to
Cairo, and then on to Aqaba, to start planning for the long-delayed Arab
advance north.</p>
<p>One of the first tasks before him in that regard was to finally bring
to an end Faisal’s long and perilous flirtation with the Turkish general
Mehmet Djemal. In late July, Lawrence passed along to David Hogarth a
copy of the peace offer letter that Faisal had sent to Djemal on June
10. The cover story Lawrence concocted to explain how he had come into
possession of such an explosive document—he claimed to have
surreptitiously obtained it from Faisal’s scribe—was absurd on its face,
but apparently had a sufficiently Arabian Nights flavor to pass muster
with his superiors.</p>
<p>Oddly, in London, the most immediate effect of this fresh revelation
of Faisal’s perfidy was to reactivate the debate, begun several months
earlier but gone a bit dormant, on exactly which high honorific should
be bestowed upon him. The episode pointed out a truly bizarre aspect of
early-twentieth-century Britain: amid the bloodiest war in human
history, and coinciding with a period so dark that the very survival of
the British Empire was at stake, more than a dozen of the most important
officials of that empire found the time in their schedules to voice
their opinions, often repeatedly, on which medal should be given to a
thirty-three-year-old desert prince. In doing so, all had ignored the
counsel of the one Briton who knew that prince best, T. E. Lawrence, and
his suggestion that Faisal wasn’t much interested in medals.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 7, 1918, Lawrence gathered with his
sixty-man bodyguard on the shore at Aqaba. His preceding weeks had been
a blur of frantic preparation, and there was still a tremendous amount
to be done before the Arabs would be ready to launch their September
attack into the Syrian heartland. For Lawrence, though, the back-base
grunt work of war—of organizing supply convoys, of plotting the movement
of men and weapons across maps—was at an end; that day, he and his men
were setting off for the interior, and would not return until the great
battle had been joined and decided.</p>
<p>Embarking on that journey undoubtedly also raised a haunting “what
if” in Lawrence’s mind. In October 1917, on the eve of the British
army’s first advance into Palestine, General Allenby had asked Lawrence
how the Arab rebels might contribute to the assault. Fearing a slaughter
of the rebels, Lawrence had kept the Arab contribution to a minimum,
instead proposing his ill-fated charge against the Yarmuk bridge. How
differently things might have turned out save for his hesitation at that
time. If the Arabs had gone all in, this last year of crushing stasis
might have been averted, the war already over; also averted, of course,
would have been Deraa, Tafileh, and the deaths of Daud and Farraj.</p>
<p>But now was the time to atone for all that. That morning in Aqaba he
told his bodyguards in their colorful robes to prepare for victory,
promised the Syrians among them that they would soon be home. “So for
the last time we mustered on the windy beach by the sea’s edge, the sun
on its brilliant waves glinting in rivalry with my flashing and changing
men.”</p>
<p>THE HEADQUARTERS OF the German army on the Western Front was a
network of pleasant châteaus and stately hotels in the small Belgian
resort town of Spa. It was there, on the morning of July 31, 1918, that
Curt Prüfer and Abbas Hilmi II were ushered into a conference room to
meet Kaiser Wilhelm II. As Prüfer recorded in his diary, Wilhelm gained
“the best impression” of the deposed khedive of Egypt, and was visibly
impressed by his grand plans for the reconquest of his homeland from the
British. At the end of the interview, the kaiser turned to Prüfer and
said, “I request that you see me next time in a free Egypt.”</p>
<p>But if the German emperor’s spirits had been buoyed by the visit, it
produced a more muted reaction in his two guests. The kaiser had aged
greatly during the war, and now seemed diminished, even slightly
befuddled. To Prüfer, attuned to the trappings and protocol of military
life, it was clear that the German emperor no longer commanded much of
anything, that for all his ostentatious medals and martial bearing he
was now almost as much a figurehead as Abbas Hilmi.</p>
<p>It was very different from what either man had expected when they’d
left Constantinople on July 23. In testament to the high hopes placed on
their mission, they had been seen off at the station by an official
Turkish government delegation that had included Interior Minister
Talaat. But then had come the long, slow journey through the heartland
of the Central Powers, images of deprivation and decline everywhere. To
both men, the land and its people looked utterly spent, the situation
far worse than just months earlier, and it belied the optimistic
pronouncements continuing to burble from the German high command and its
talk of the approaching final victory.</p>
<p>If not before, they had surely grasped the fiction of those
pronouncements once they reached Spa. On July 17, the last of the five
German offensives collectively known as the Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser’s
Battle, that had been launched on the Western Front since March had been
halted. Their number reduced by 700,000 more casualties, the remnants of
the German armies were now falling back toward the Hindenburg Line, a
fantastically elaborate wall of defensive fortifications that ran the
length of northern France and that the Germans had begun building in
1917. Not only was there to be no German “final victory,” but also no
foreseeable end to the war; from behind the Hindenburg, Germany might
hold out indefinitely, the battle grinding on without victors or
vanquished for a long time to come.</p>
<p>This was certainly the assessment of generals and war planners on the
other side of the front. Even with the flood of American soldiers
finally beginning to reach France, the most optimistic Allied
strategists were talking of a breakthrough in the summer of 1919, while
their more conservative colleagues foresaw the struggle continuing far
beyond; some analyses had the war going well into the mid-1920s.</p>
<p>Yet as with nearly every other assessment among the wise men of the
Entente, these estimates were to be proven wrong. After the deaths of
some sixteen million around the globe, the end was coming, and with a
speed few could comprehend. Improbably, that collapse would start in one
of the most remote and seemingly insignificant corners of the world
battlefield, the deserts of Syria.</p>

<p>We ordered “no prisoners,” and the men obeyed.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, OFFICIAL REPORT ON EVENTS IN TAFAS, OCTOBER 1918</p>
<p>It was September 12, 1918. The world war had now entered its fiftieth
month. In contemplating its various battlefronts on that day, Allied
military and political leaders were held in a certain thrall, their
growing conviction that the enemy was nearing collapse tempered by the
memory of how many times they had been wrong about this in the past. On
the Western Front, the Germans had now ceded the last of their gains in
the Spring Offensive to regroup behind the Hindenburg Line. The first
Allied test against that defensive wall, the most formidable network of
fortifications ever built, was to be a joint French-American operation
near the Meuse River, scheduled for the end of the month. On the
Southern Front, Italian commanders, at last chastened at having suffered
over 1.5 million casualties over three years of war for no gain, were
working up modest plans to move against an Austro-Hungarian army that
had stood on the far bank of the Piave River for nearly a year. In the
Balkans, a joint army of French, Serbs, Greeks, and Britons was
preparing to push against a Bulgarian army in Macedonia. With the fresh
memory of millions dead, the Allies viewed these proposed thrusts as of
the testing-the-waters ilk, a chance to make some incremental gains
before winter shut down offensive operations until the following spring,
perhaps for even longer. British prime minister Lloyd George had
recently floated a proposal to delay any all-out advance against Germany
until 1920, when the American army would be fully ashore in France and
Allied strength might be truly overwhelming.</p>
<p>In this climate, people went about their lives with a sense of
cautious optimism or quiet trepidation, depending on which side of the
battle lines they dwelt, a budding belief that the worst war in human
history was finally inching toward some kind of resolution, even if the
particulars and timetable for that resolution remained as indistinct as
ever.</p>
<p>On that September 12, Aaron Aaronsohn was on a passenger ship five
days out of Southampton, bound for New York. Having returned to England
from the Middle East in August, he had spent a frustrating few weeks
shuttling between Paris and London trying to win support for his
Palestinian land-buying scheme. That effort had been complicated by his
usual sparring with Chaim Weizmann and other British Zionist leaders,
and Weizmann and Mark Sykes had seen a way both to be temporarily rid of
the irksome agronomist and to put him to good use by proposing that he
embark on another rallying-the-troops mission to the American Jewish
community. Once Aaronsohn’s ship put into New York harbor, he had a full
roster of meetings and talks planned that might keep him busy in the
United States for months.</p>
<p>Curt Prüfer’s summer had steadily mutated from the strange to the
surreal. After arranging Abbas Hilmi’s audience with the kaiser at the
end of July, he had spent weeks shuttling the pretender to the Egyptian
throne around the German countryside, with official meetings and
banquets in the khedive’s honor interspersed with stays at the country
estates of princelings and countesses. In the mountain resort town of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in mid-August, the pair had met up with the
kaiser’s sister, Princess Viktoria von Schaumburg-Lippe, and her
eclectic retinue of hangers-on, and had spent ten days in rather
debauched merriment even as the news from the war front grew bleak.</p>
<p>“Growing intimacy with the princess and Gräfin Montgelas and Seline
von Schlotheim,” Prüfer noted in his diary on August 30, referring to
the kaiser’s sister and two courtesans in her entourage. “In the
evenings, boozing, dancing and flirting, hectic room parties and the
like.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t all just parlor games, though. In Abbas Hilmi, Prüfer was
in the company of one of the world’s most indefatigable schemers, and as
the outlook for the Central Powers dimmed, the German spy chief seemed
to latch onto the Egyptians’ grandiose plots with a kind of anxious
fervor. One involved trying to lure Abbas’s son and heir, Abdel Moneim,
out of Switzerland. As the ex-khedive explained, his son was a weak and
mentally unstable young man with sadistic inclinations—which went a long
way toward explaining his current flirtation with the British—but if
Prüfer could somehow lure Abdel Moneim to Germany, his father could then
arrange his marriage to the daughter of the new Ottoman sultan, thereby
cementing Abbas’s own claim to Egyptian rule. It was surely an
indication of just how divorced from the real world Prüfer was becoming
that all this struck him as both a fine and important idea, one to be
taken up at the highest levels of the foreign ministry.</p>
<p>But if the German spymaster increasingly lived in a deluded parallel
universe, it was one in which he had a great deal of company. Not only
did senior foreign ministry officials urge Prüfer to proceed with the
Abdel Moneim overture, but they beseeched him for help on another
matter. Alerted to the conciliatory letter Faisal Hussein had written
Turkish general Mehmet Djemal back in June, they now seized upon the
idea of brokering a peace deal with the Arab rebels as a last-minute
solution in the Middle East—a solution that perhaps would include their
dear friends in the Young Turk leadership, but perhaps not. Prodded by
the foreign ministry for possible intermediaries to carry Germany’s own
secret peacemaking initiative to Faisal, Prüfer passed along the name of
a contact helpfully provided by Abbas Hilmi.</p>
<p>If less colorful, William Yale’s late summer was also proving
frustrating. By September 12, he had spent more than a month in his tent
at the British General Headquarters at Bir-es-Salem, in the foothills
below Jerusalem. In that time, the State Department special agent—now
reconstituted as the American military attaché to the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force—had learned virtually nothing from the British
military command of Allenby’s much-rumored coming offensive. This had
not been for lack of effort; Yale had attended any number of
intelligence briefings at which British officials seemed in quiet
competition with each other to impart nothing of substance, and had
suffered through a host of tedious senior staff dinners even less
illuminating. His repeated requests to tour the British front lines were
put off with one excuse after another. He was finally given a partial
explanation for this by a certain Captain Hodgson, the British officer
detailed to serve as minder to the foreign attachés. “I’ll tell you,
Yale,” Hodgson revealed, “I was told to show you as little as possible,
as you were a Standard Oil man.”</p>
<p>Yet the British had also unwittingly handed Yale an opening.
Testament to the low regard with which they held the foreign military
attachés in general, and him in particular, they had isolated them in
the same corner of Bir-es-Salem as another distasteful group of camp
followers: the resident press corps. From this motley assortment of
British and Australian newspaper correspondents, far less restricted in
their movements than the attachés, Yale was able to glean at least
something of what was being planned, enough so that by September 12 he
knew “the big show” was soon to get under way. He didn’t know when, let
alone where, but in the growing sense of urgency that permeated General
Headquarters, in the shifting of troops and matériel that the
journalists reported seeing on their travels, were the unmistakable
signs that Allenby’s offensive was imminent.</p>
<p>But beyond their qualms over Yale’s Standard Oil connection, General
Headquarters actually had good reason for their climate of secrecy; what
they were planning in Palestine constituted a very intricate ruse. In
recent weeks, an array of British army units had been brought up from
Palestine’s coastal plain to take up positions around Jerusalem, their
new tent encampments sprawling over the Judean hillsides. Amid this re-
deployment, Allenby had moved his forward command headquarters to
Jerusalem. Simultaneously, local purchasing agents had been dispatched
to different tribes in the Amman region with orders to buy up enormous
amounts of forage, enough to feed the horses and camels of a large army,
come late September. To the watching Turks, the conclusion was
inescapable: the British offensive was coming soon, and its target was
to be the same Salt-Amman region where British attacks had failed twice
before. In fact, however, those new tent cities were empty, Allenby’s
move to Jerusalem had been a charade, and the forage-buying effort was a
red herring. Rather, the British plan was to strike at the very opposite
end of the line, to sweep north along the Palestinian coastal shelf and
then turn inland so as to envelop the Turks from three sides.</p>
<p>That was only one aspect of the ruse; another was playing out on the
other side of the Jordan River. For some time, a mixed force of several
thousand Allied fighters—Arab tribesmen, soldiers of the Arab Northern
Army, British and French advisors together with specialized artillery
and armored car units—had been making their way across the Syrian desert
to gather at the old citadel of Azraq. If detected by the Turks—and it
was hard to see how such a large force could go unnoticed
indefinitely—it would serve to further confirm that the Allied attack
was coming at Amman, just fifty miles to the west of Azraq. Instead, the
Azraq unit’s true target lay seventy miles to the northwest, the crucial
railway junction of Deraa. Moreover, this unit was to act as the pivotal
first shock troop for the entire offensive, their goal to shut down both
the Hejaz Railway and its spur line into Palestine on the eve of
Allenby’s attack in order to paralyze the Turkish army from behind. By
September 12, the last of these shock troops had arrived in Azraq, and
were met there by the two British lieutenant colonels in charge of
coordinating the operation: Pierce Joyce and T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>By that date, Lawrence had already been in Azraq for nearly a week,
and had taken stock of the diverse fighting force as it drifted in:
warriors from a dozen Arab tribes; the British and French transport and
artillery specialists; a detachment of Indian army cavalry; even a small
unit of Gurkhas, the famed Nepalese soldiers with their trademark curved
khukuri daggers. On that same morning of September 12, the final
component fell into place with the arrival in Azraq of the senior Arab
rebel leadership: Faisal Hussein foremost among them, but also Nuri
Shalaan and Auda Abu Tayi and a host of other tribal chiefs whom
Lawrence had helped bring to the cause of Arab independence over the
past two years. With the vanguard of the attack force set to begin
deploying the following morning, the plan was for these leaders to
gather at a conclave that afternoon, during which Lawrence and Joyce
would go over their various objectives.</p>
<p>Yet it was at precisely this juncture, on the eve of the campaign he
had worked so hard to bring about, that Lawrence was suddenly plunged
into a paralyzing gloom. Shortly after Hussein and the other Arab
leaders arrived, he slipped out of Azraq and made for a remote mountain
cleft called Ain el Essad, some eight miles away. As he recounted in
Seven Pillars, “[I] lay there all day in my old lair among the tamarisk,
where the wind in the dusty green branches played with such sounds as it
made in English trees. It told me I was tired to death of these
Arabs.”</p>
<p>There had in fact been warning signs for some time that Lawrence
might be headed for just such a collapse. Back in mid-July, only days
after receiving confirmation of Allenby’s offensive launch date—an event
that should have put him in an ebullient mood—Lawrence had written a
melancholy letter to his friend and confidant Vyvyan Richards. “I have
been so violently uprooted and plunged so deeply into a job too big for
me, that everything feels unreal,” he told Richards. “I have dropped
everything I ever did, and live only as a thief of opportunity,
snatching chances of the moment when and where I see them.… It’s a kind
of foreign stage on which one plays day and night, in fancy dress, in a
strange language, with the price of failure on one’s head if the part is
not well filled.”</p>
<p>He had gone on to describe his admiration of the Arabs, although he
now recognized that he was fundamentally apart from them, an eternal
stranger. He wrote of the words he carried in his mind—peace, silence,
rest—“like a lighted window in the dark,” but then questioned what good
a lighted window was anyway. As was often the case when Lawrence wrote
from the heart, he closed by denigrating what he had written, calling it
“an idiot letter” born of his contrarian nature. “[I] still remain
always unsatisfied. I hate being in front and I hate being back, and I
don’t like responsibility and I don’t obey orders. Altogether no good
just now. A long quiet, like a purge, and then a contemplation and
decision of future roads, that is what is to look forward to.”</p>
<p>But if his letter to Richards spoke to physical and spiritual
exhaustion, it was compounded by the guilt he felt in having “profitably
shammed” his Arab comrades for two years—and this guilt had recently
grown worse. In early August, while planning for the Azraq operation,
Lawrence had again met with Nuri Shalaan, the warlord of the powerful
Rualla tribe he had first tried to woo to the Sherifian cause a year
before by suggesting the chieftain believe the most recent promises
Great Britain had made to the Arabs. At their August meeting, Shalaan
had at last fully committed his tribe to the rebel side, although in the
disclosures since their previous meeting—the Balfour Declaration, the
Sykes-Picot Agreement—he surely knew his British suitor had been less
than forthright. If exactly why remains elusive, it is clear both from
Lawrence’s memoir and comments he made to his early biographers that the
deception he had perpetrated on Shalaan weighed more heavily on his
conscience than any other.</p>
<p>Then, right before setting out for Azraq, there had been an incident
that caused Lawrence to question the very purpose of his “crusade” for
the Arabs. In late August, just as the main Arab army was preparing to
leave the Aqaba region for the north, King Hussein had elected to pick a
bitter and rather public fight with Faisal, all but accusing him of
disloyalty. For nearly a week, the angry cables had passed between
father and son, during which the rebel advance ground to a halt, the
entire Syrian offensive cast into doubt as the clock ticked away.
Lawrence had finally patched together a rapprochement—intercepting one
of Hussein’s cables, he had scissored off its angry second half, only
passing along to Faisal the apologetic-sounding first half—but that all
his plans had been nearly sabotaged by the man he was ostensibly
fighting for left a bitterness that would never fully go away.</p>
<p>But it seems something else was also working on Lawrence that day in
Ain el Essad, a very recent and devastating personal blow. By all
evidence, it was during his stay in Azraq that he first learned of the
death of Dahoum, his young companion at Carchemish, the apparent victim
of a typhus epidemic that had swept northern Syria some time before. To
a profound degree—and to a depth Lawrence himself may not have fully
realized—he had come to personify the war in his own mind in the form of
Dahoum; it was for that young Syrian boy and his future that the Arabs
needed to be free. Now Dahoum was dead, and with him had gone so much of
what had animated Lawrence to the fight. Although he would never reveal
the identity of the mysterious “S.A.” to whom Seven Pillars is
dedicated—Dahoum’s real name was Salim Ali—the first stanzas of the
book’s prefatory poem strongly suggest both the timing of when Lawrence
learned of Dahoum’s death and the effect it had upon him:</p>
<p>I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands</p>
<p>And wrote my will across the sky in stars</p>
<p>To earn you Freedom, the seven pillared worthy house,</p>
<p>That your eyes might be shining for me when we came.</p>
<p>Death seemed my servant on the road, till we were near</p>
<p>And saw you waiting</p>
<p>When you smiled, and in sorrowful envy [death] outran me</p>
<p>And took you apart: into his quietness.</p>
<p>Despite his grief, Lawrence had given too much of himself, and asked
too much of the Arabs, to pull away at the climax of their long
campaign. He would write of his mood on September 12 that “today it came
to me with finality that my patience as regards the false position I had
been led into was finished. A week [more], two weeks, three, and I would
insist upon relief. My nerve had broken, and I would be lucky if the
ruin of it could be hidden so long.” With that, he rose from his “lair”
at Ain el Essad and made his way back to the gathered warriors at Azraq,
now just hours away from their first strikes against the enemy.</p>
<p>By coincidence, that same day, a top-secret report was being sent to
the U.S. military intelligence office in London, outlining the collapse
of morale among the Arab rebels fighting with the British. “It is
reported that the Syrians who are with Emir Faisal in the Aqaba region,”
the September 12 report stated, “are entirely disaffected and that there
are many dissensions.” One reason, apparently, was the rebels’ woeful
incompetence on the battlefield. “In spite of the support of the
British, the Arabs of Arabia have shown their incapacity to organize or
make war.… The entire Arab situation appears to be in a great
muddle.”</p>
<p>The report’s author was the military intelligence bureau’s chief
correspondent in the Middle East, attaché William Yale. With that
dispatch he was establishing a tradition of fundamentally misreading the
situation in the Middle East that his successors in the American
intelligence community would rigorously maintain for the next
ninety-five years.</p>
<p>IT HAD A certain boys’-lark quality to it, a not uncommon experience
in war when all the advantages and few of the risks reside with one’s
own side. Leaving Azraq on the morning of September 14, Lawrence spent
the better part of a week careening through the desert around Deraa in a
Rolls-Royce armored car, blowing up bridges and tearing up railway
tracks, dodging ineffective enemy air attacks, skirmishing with the
occasional unlucky Turkish foot patrol.</p>
<p>The ease with which he was able to do so could be largely credited to
the success of the ruse concocted at Allenby’s headquarters. With the
Turks massed around Amman in anticipation of the presumed attack there,
the Azraq strike force had nearly free rein to pursue its goals: the
severing of the Hejaz Railway to the north and south of Deraa, as well
as of the vital western spur leading into Palestine. The ultimate goal,
of course, was to accomplish all this before Allenby’s offensive got
under way on September 19.</p>
<p>As Lawrence discovered when he caught up to the main raiding party,
however, a first attempt on the southern railway link had gone awry
through simple bad luck. Now quite sold on the efficacy of mechanized
war in the desert, he decided to make a personal go of it, setting out
for the southern railroad with just two armored cars and two “tenders,”
or large sedans. He found his target on the morning of September 16 in
the form of a lightly defended bridge in the middle of nowhere, “a
pleasant little work, eighty feet long and fifteen feet high.” A
particular point of pride for Lawrence was the new technique he and his
colleagues used in setting their explosives, one that left the bridge
“scientifically shattered” but still standing; Turkish repair crews
would now have the time-consuming task of dismantling the wreckage
before they could start to rebuild.</p>
<p>That job complete, Lawrence rejoined the main Arab force as it fell
upon the railway north of Deraa the following morning. Encountering
little resistance, the thousand-odd warriors quickly took control of a
nearly ten-mile stretch of track, enabling the demolition teams to begin
placing their mines. The action had the effect of lifting Lawrence from
the dark mood that had stalked him in Azraq; his primary orders from
headquarters had been to isolate Deraa, and “I could hardly believe our
fortune, hardly believe that our word to Allenby was fulfilled so simply
and so soon.”</p>
<p>This left only the western spur leading into Palestine, and on that
same afternoon of September 17, an Arab force stormed a railway station
a few miles to the west of Deraa; in short order, they had ransacked the
terminal and put to the torch all that couldn’t be carried off. But
Lawrence had grander plans. Leading a small band farther west, he hoped
to blow up the Yarmuk gorge bridges that had eluded his destruction a
year before. Once again, though, he was to be thwarted, this time by the
presence of a train filled with German and Turkish troops coming up from
Palestine.</p>
<p>Still, as Lawrence turned back to rejoin the main rebel force the
next day, he had every reason to feel pleased with the “work” that had
been done: the main Turkish telegraph link to Palestine was now cut, all
three railway spans sufficiently damaged that repair would take days, if
not weeks. There was still more mayhem to be accomplished—on that same
afternoon of September 18, he would see to the blowing up of another
bridge, the seventy-ninth of his career—but the Azraq vanguard had
achieved most every objective asked of it in prelude to Allenby’s
offensive, now just hours away.</p>
<p>By prior arrangement, a Royal Flying Corps plane was scheduled to put
into Azraq on the morning of September 21, bringing reports of how the
offensive in Palestine was faring. Anxious for news, Lawrence raced back
to the desert fortress the day before. Nearing a state of complete
collapse—he’d barely slept since setting out from Azraq six days
earlier—he found an empty cot in the encampment’s field hospital and
fell into an exhausted slumber.</p>
<p>YALE’S FIRST CLUE came when he stepped into his assigned mess hall
for dinner on September 18: the journalists were gone. The next clue was
when he walked down to the motor pool compound: all the vehicles were
gone, too. A junior British officer bravely explained that they had all
been dispatched to various parts of the front in prelude to the coming
offensive; apparently, none had been detailed for Yale or the one other
military attaché remaining, an Italian major named de Sambouy.</p>
<p>“I was irritated and perplexed,” Yale wrote. “What should a military
attaché do? Ought I to demand transportation to the front, or should I
accept the lame excuse given us? Why shouldn’t Sambouy do something? He
was a regular army officer who had been in the war since 1915. I went to
bed annoyed with myself and the British.”</p>
<p>His sleep was to be interrupted. At 4:45 a.m. on the morning of
September 19, Yale was wrenched awake by “a terrific roar that seemed to
shake the whole world.” As one, nearly five hundred British artillery
guns had commenced shelling the Turkish line all along the Palestinian
front.</p>
<p>By the time he rose and dressed, Yale had resolved what to do.
Striding into a general’s office, he announced that he was on his way to
breakfast, and that if there wasn’t a car waiting for him when he
emerged, he would send a cable to Washington announcing that he was
being held captive by the British. His Italian counterpart was aghast at
his temerity, but when the pair emerged from the mess hall a short time
later, they found a Ford Model T awaiting them with a former London
cabdriver at the wheel.</p>
<p>They made that morning for a bluff overlooking the Plain of Sharon,
from which, they were told, they could view one section of the
battlefield. Finding a group of British officers already ensconced in
the ruins of an old Crusader castle, the two attachés joined them,
training their binoculars on the action two or three miles to the north.
It was Yale’s first experience observing combat, and he found it
decidedly underwhelming. “Infrequent bursts of [artillery] shells
[coming from] back of us on the plateau, white puffs of riflery on the
hills in front of us, the intermittent rat-tat-tat of machine guns and,
from time to time, lines of men who could scarcely be distinguished
against the gray blankness of the limestone hills. It was nowhere near
as thrilling as the sham battles I had watched as a boy at Van Cortland
Park. For us, the day was long and monotonous. No one seemed to know
what was happening; certainly, I had no idea of whether the British or
the Turks were winning.”</p>
<p>New to war, the American attaché couldn’t appreciate that he was
actually experiencing the very essence of the traditional battlefield,
that amid the engulfing chaos even senior field commanders usually had
only the vaguest sense of what was happening—and then often only on the
ground directly before them. But the ever-resourceful Yale saw a means
around this. Returning to General Headquarters that evening, he parlayed
his attaché status into gaining admittance to the main telegraph room.
There he discovered stacks of cables coming in from every corner of the
front, dispatches that when plotted on a map gave him a grasp of the
overall campaign available only to Allenby and his most senior advisors.
This knowledge stood him in very good stead the following day when,
having ventured to a new part of the front, Yale found himself briefing
a British brigadier general on what was occurring elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This helped me to feel less awkward amongst the military,” he
recalled, “and I even began to regain the confidence in myself which had
been badly shaken when first I was thrown in among professional
soldiers.”</p>
<p>For the first two days of the offensive, Yale had the luxury of
observing war from a comfortable remove, the combatants appearing as so
many scurrying ants in the distance. That ended on September 21, when he
and his Model T companions journeyed up a mountain road leading to the
town of Nablus in the Samaria foothills. The day before, a fleeing
Turkish formation had made for Nablus up that same road, and there they
had been found by the bombs and machine guns of swarming British
warplanes.</p>
<p>“The Turks had no way of fighting back,” Yale recounted. “There was
no shelter to run to, and no way of surrendering. The results were
tragic.… For a few miles, the road was lined with bloated corpses,
swelling to the bursting point under the hot rays of the sun.”</p>
<p>One image in particular stuck in Yale’s memory, a stretch of the road
where an old Roman aqueduct crossed the valley. Here, scores of Turkish
soldiers had hugged the stone walls of the aqueduct as protection
against the strafing British warplanes—only to fall victim when the
planes circled back to attack from the other direction. The dead men lay
in a neat single-file line along the entire length of the aqueduct,
looking “for all the world,” Yale would recall, “like a row of tin
soldiers toppled over.”</p>
<p>THE NEWS WAS staggering. When the RFC plane touched down at Azraq on
the morning of September 21, its pilot told of a British sweep up the
Palestinian coast that had simply steamrolled whatever scant Turkish
resistance stood in its path. A few weeks earlier, General Headquarters
had talked of an advance that might take them as far as the city of
Nablus, forty miles north of Jerusalem; now, in a matter of just two
days, the British vanguard was already far above Nablus, and thousands
of enemy soldiers had thrown down their weapons in surrender. The note
of triumph was evident in the letter General Allenby had sent to Azraq
for Faisal. “Already the Turkish Army in Syria has suffered a defeat
from which it can scarcely recover,” it read. “It rests upon us now, by
the redoubled energy of our [joint] attacks, to turn defeat into
destruction.”</p>
<p>More details were provided in a letter Alan Dawnay had sent to
Lieutenant Colonel Joyce. By the previous evening, the British cavalry
had already begun turning inland from their charge up the coast, leaving
the enemy units in Palestine in imminent danger of being encircled. “The
whole Turkish army is in the net,” Dawnay exulted, “and every bolt-hole
closed except, possibly, that east of the Jordan by way of the Yarmuk
valley. If the Arabs can close this, too—and close it in time—then not a
man or gun or wagon ought to escape. Some victory!”</p>
<p>As Lawrence plainly put it in Seven Pillars, “the face of our war was
changed.”</p>
<p>Also changed, naturally, were the prior battle plans drawn up for the
Azraq force, the pace of events now rendering them obsolete. That
afternoon, Lawrence boarded the RFC plane for its return to Palestine
and an urgent meeting with General Allenby’s staff.</p>
<p>As Lawrence learned at headquarters, and as Allenby had alluded in
his note to Faisal, the goal now was not to defeat the Turkish army—that
had already been achieved—but to destroy it completely. To that end,
even as the left flank of the British army continued its northern
advance, three other columns were to cut east across the Jordan River in
order to roll up the inland Syrian towns along the Hejaz Railway and,
ultimately, close on Damascus. The linchpin was, as always, Deraa, the
one spot where all the Turkish units fleeing east from Palestine and all
those still to the south might converge and perhaps sufficiently regroup
to make a stand. To forestall that, headquarters impressed on Lawrence,
there was one thing the Arabs must do—permanently sever the rail line
south of Deraa—and one thing they absolutely must not do: make a dash
for Damascus.</p>
<p>This latter point had already been stressed in Alan Dawnay’s letter
to Joyce in Azraq (with Joyce temporarily away, Lawrence had opened and
read it). “Use all your restraining influence,” Dawnay had ordered
Joyce, “and get Lawrence to do the same, to prevent Faisal from any act
of rashness in the north.… The situation is completely in our hands to
mold now, so Faisal need have no fear of being carted, provided he will
trust us and be patient. Only let him no on account move north without
first consulting General Allenby—that would be the fatal error.”</p>
<p>British concern was quite understandable. For nearly two years,
Lawrence had been counseling Faisal that the only sure way for the Arabs
to stake claim to Damascus was to get there first; this assertion had
appeared to be further confirmed by Mark Sykes’s recent open letter to
the “Seven Syrians.” As a result, the temptation for Faisal to drop the
Deraa operations and make a dash for Damascus might prove an
irresistible one. During Lawrence’s brief sojourn at headquarters,
Allenby’s senior advisors repeatedly emphasized that Arab loyalty at
this crucial juncture would be well compensated—apparently even implying
that Faisal would be allowed to establish a government in Damascus.</p>
<p>Armed with these assurances, and with the Arabs’ new orders of battle
in hand, Lawrence flew back to Azraq the next morning. Over the
following two days, a host of Arab bands, along with British armored car
units, descended on the Hejaz Railway below Deraa to render it damaged
beyond repair for the foreseeable future. Already, however, the worry
that the retreating Turkish armies might recover enough to make a stand
in Deraa seemed far-fetched; the enemy was now in full and panicked
rout, their soldiers so stunned by the speed of events that they could
think of little more than personal escape. Indeed, so rapid was the
Turkish disintegration that by September 25, Lawrence was able to report
to headquarters that there were probably only four thousand Turkish
soldiers left in all the inland garrison towns below Deraa, most of the
rest having passed through Deraa and kept on going in the direction of
Damascus.</p>
<p>But in keeping with the broadened goal of destroying the Turkish army
utterly, Lawrence saw an opportunity; if Deraa wasn’t to be a Turkish
rallying point, it could now be turned into a killing field. As he
tersely commented in his September 25 report in describing the enemy
units trying to reach Damascus, “I want to stop that.”</p>
<p>To do so, on the twenty-sixth he directed a number of the Arab
warriors to make for a small village in the foothills just twelve miles
northwest of Deraa called Sheikh Saad. From there, the rebels would
enjoy a commanding view of what was transpiring both in Deraa and on the
road to Damascus, and also be able to monitor any retreating Turkish
units coming up out of the Yarmuk gorge from Palestine.</p>
<p>Lawrence soon had reason to congratulate himself on the move. That
same afternoon, scouts spotted a small mixed German and Turkish force
coming up the Yarmuk road, “hopeless but carefree, marching at ease,
thinking themselves fifty miles from any war.” Walking heedlessly into a
hastily prepared Arab ambush, the unit was soon overwhelmed. As Lawrence
noted, “Sheikh Saad was paying soon, and well.”</p>
<p>That was just a foretaste. The next morning, and with a British army
now coming up the Yarmuk, the Turks remaining in and around Deraa
prepared to abandon their positions as well. Word reached Lawrence that
some four thousand enemy soldiers were about to set out from Deraa on
the main Damascus road, while another two thousand were pulling out of a
nearby town. This latter column was taking an overland shortcut that
would bring them through the village of Tafas, just six miles below
Sheikh Saad. As Lawrence drily commented in Seven Pillars, “The nearer
two thousand seemed more our size.”</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of September 23, the Mediterranean city of Haifa was
captured from the Turks by an Indian army cavalry unit. Arriving that
evening, William Yale arranged for lodging in a private home, then
decided to take a stroll through the city’s deserted old quarter.</p>
<p>At the start of World War I, most all the warring powers had
horse-mounted cavalry that still carried lances as part of their
complement of weaponry. By 1918, nearly all such cavalries had discarded
the lance as anachronistic in the age of the machine gun and warplane,
but not so the Indian army. That afternoon, they had employed it to
deadly effect in the narrow back streets of Haifa’s old quarter, running
down and impaling terrified Turkish soldiers as they tried to flee.
Everywhere Yale walked lay the dead.</p>
<p>“In the silent lonely streets,” he recalled, “under a brilliant moon,
the bodies of these Turkish soldiers seemed strangely out of place, for
the peace and calm of an Oriental night covered this part of the
city.”</p>
<p>But it takes remarkably little time for the average person to become
desensitized to the horror of war, and in this William Yale was to prove
no exception. The following day, only his sixth on the battlefield, he
and Major de Sambouy were driving down the Palestine coastal road when
they began passing column after column of Turkish prisoners being
marched off to internment camps. In their wake were scores of prisoners
who had collapsed, too exhausted or ill to go on. Of these men being
left behind to die in the sun, neither their comrades nor their Indian
captors took any notice, and neither did Yale or his traveling
companion. “It was not our affair and we had a long day’s journey ahead
of us,” he would write. “It never occurred to me that we were
heartlessly callous and unconcerned. We didn’t even think of stopping to
take an extra passenger or two.”</p>
<p>THEY CAME UPON the first survivors hiding in the tall grass of a
meadow just outside Tafas. Traumatized and speaking in hushed whispers,
the villagers told of the atrocities the Turkish soldiers had begun
perpetrating immediately upon entering Tafas just an hour before.
Continuing on, Lawrence and the Arab vanguard soon found evidence of
this; here and there, bodies lay amid the meadow grass, “embracing the
ground in the close way of corpses.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a little girl of three or four popped into view, her smock
drenched in blood from a gash by her neck. “The child ran a few steps,”
Lawrence recalled, “then stood and cried to us in a tone of astonishing
strength (all else being very silent), ‘Don’t hit me, Baba.’” A moment
later, the girl collapsed, presumably dead.</p>
<p>None of this prepared for the scene in Tafas’s streets. Everywhere
were bodies, many hideously mutilated, girls and women obviously raped
before their dispatch. In particular, Lawrence was to remember the sight
of a naked pregnant woman, bent over a low wall and grotesquely impaled
by a saw bayonet; around her lay some twenty others, “variously killed,
but set out in accord with an obscene taste.”</p>
<p>By bad coincidence, one of the tribal sheikhs who had accompanied
Lawrence during the previous two weeks and who now rode alongside him
was Talal el Hareidhin, the headman of Tafas. As Lawrence would recount
in his official report of the incident, at the sight of his ruined
village, Talal “gave a horrible cry, wrapped his headcloth about his
face, put spurs to his horse and, rocking in the saddle, galloped at
full speed into the midst of the retiring [Turkish] column and fell,
himself and his mare, riddled with machine gun bullets among their lance
points.”</p>
<p>In consultation with Auda Abu Tayi, who had also ridden into Tafas
that morning, Lawrence commanded his lieutenants that no prisoners
should be taken—or, as he put it more eloquently in Seven Pillars,
“ ‘the best of you brings me the most Turkish dead.’”</p>
<p>What ensued over that long day of September 27 was a merciless and
one-sided slaughter. Quite quickly, the attacking Arabs separated the
fleeing Turkish column of two thousand into three isolated sections,
then set to annihilating them one by one; any Turkish or German soldier
who fell out wounded or tried to surrender was swiftly cut down. Soon
the pursuing Arabs were joined by villagers along the way, eager to
strike against their oppressors of the past four years—and perhaps just
as eager to strip their bodies of valuables. Even by the standards of
massacre, this one took on an especially macabre edge. “There lay on us
a madness,” Lawrence recounted in Seven Pillars, “born of the horror of
Tafas or of its story, so that we killed and killed, even blowing in the
heads of the fallen and of the animals, as though their death and
running blood could slake the agony in our brains.”</p>
<p>It grew worse. By chance, one of the Arab reserve columns had missed
the “no quarter” order, and when a doubling-back Lawrence came upon this
unit just before nightfall, he found they had taken some 250 Turkish and
German soldiers captive. According to his Seven Pillars account,
Lawrence was “not unwilling” to let this group live, until he was led
over to a dying Arab warrior gruesomely pinioned to the ground by German
bayonets, “like a collected insect.” As Lawrence would state in his
official report, written just days after the incident, “then we turned
our Hotchkiss [machine gun] on the prisoners and made an end of them,
they saying nothing.”</p>
<p>All night and into the following days the slaughter went on, the
panicked and exhausted prey becoming divided into smaller and smaller
groups until they were quite defenseless against their attackers, a
fortunate few taken prisoner, many more summarily put to death. By the
time the last stragglers approached the outskirts of Damascus two days
later, the estimated six thousand Turkish and German soldiers who had
set out from the Deraa area on September 27 had been reduced to fewer
than two thousand.</p>
<p>Lawrence didn’t partake of this further massacre. Instead, late that
night, he turned back for his command post in Sheikh Saad and then, at
dawn, made for the town of his past torments: Deraa. By his account in
Seven Pillars, the time he spent there was rather anticlimactic,
especially when placed against the horrific events of Tafas. An Arab
force had swept into Deraa the previous afternoon and, after rounding up
those few Turkish soldiers who remained, spent the interim in the
time-honored tradition of looting and pillaging. In quick order,
Lawrence managed to stem the anarchy, placing armed guards over what
remained of the railyard and its worksheds and helping with the
appointment of a governor and police force. Indeed, by Lawrence’s
telling, the greatest challenge he faced in Deraa that day was heading
off the bellicose ambitions of General George Barrow, the commander of
the British army that had just finished its climb out of the Yarmuk
gorge.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Barrow comes off as a distinctly buffoonish figure,
one whose comeuppance began the moment Lawrence came out of Deraa on the
western road to greet him. To the general’s plan of imposing calm in the
town by posting pickets throughout, Lawrence “explained gently” that
calm had already been established by the newly appointed Arab governor.
When Barrow then insisted his men take possession of the Deraa railway
station, Lawrence assented, but with the rather haughty request that the
British not interfere with the railroad’s functioning, since the Arabs
had already cleared the line and were readying a train for travel.
“Barrow,” Lawrence wrote, “who had come in thinking of [the Arabs] as a
conquered people, though dazed at my calm assumption that he was my
guest, had no option but to follow the lead of such assurance.” With the
general thus sufficiently humbled, Lawrence recounted, “soon we got on
well.”</p>
<p>But this was not at all the way George Barrow would remember the
situation in Deraa that day. As he would relate in his own memoir, “The
whole place was indescribably filthy, defiled and littered with
smoldering cinders and the soiled leavings of loot. Turks, some dead and
some dying, lay about the railway station or sat propped against the
houses. Those still living gazed at us with eyes that begged for a
little of the mercy which it was hopeless for them to ask of the
Arabs.”</p>
<p>But this was trivial compared with what Barrow’s men found when they
entered the Turkish hospital train that had been stranded in Deraa
station, a scene he would describe, with considerable hyperbole, as “far
exceeding in its savagery anything that has been known in the conflicts
between nations during the past 120 years.” According to Barrow, “Arab
soldiers were going through the train, tearing off the clothing of the
groaning and stricken Turks, regardless of gaping wounds and broken
limbs, and cutting their victims’ throats.… It was a sight that no
average civilized human being could bear unmoved.” In Barrow’s telling,
when he angrily ordered Lawrence to remove the Arabs from the train, he
was met with a refusal and the explanation that this was the Arabs’
“idea of war.”</p>
<p>“It is not our idea of war,” Barrow countered, “and if you can’t
remove them, I will.” At this, Lawrence allegedly washed his hands of
the matter, telling the general he would take no responsibility for what
might happen next. Summoning his own men, Barrow cleared the ambulance
train and brought the killing to a stop.</p>
<p>Taken together, the events in Tafas and Deraa encapsulate the
difficulty in getting at the full truth of the “Lawrence myth”—or even
to isolate which facet of that myth is the most credible. In Lawrence’s
Seven Pillars description of Tafas, the skeptical reader might find some
moments just a little too cinematic to be fully believed—the stirring
war cry that the charging Talal delivered just before he was gunned
down, the accusing gaze the bayonet-pinioned Arab warrior cast toward
his German and Turkish tormentors with his dying breath—especially since
those moments are absent from Lawrence’s official report. There is also
his uncomfortably keen eye for the grisly detail, reminiscent of the
passage describing his torture in Deraa the year before, that edges
toward prurience and war pornography. To add a different wrinkle, after
the war, several of Lawrence’s British comrades in the September 1918
offensive would stoutly maintain that he never issued a “no quarter”
command, let alone ordered the execution of prisoners once taken, even
though Lawrence plainly stated as much in both his memoir and official
report.</p>
<p>The Deraa ambulance train story underscores this difficulty in
reverse. As shockingly candid as Lawrence was in describing his actions
at Tafas, in neither Seven Pillars nor in his official report did he
even mention the train incident—yet it’s hard to imagine George Barrow,
a very “proper” career military officer, simply making up such an
account. If the incident did in fact occur, the simplest explanation for
its omission is that Lawrence wished to avoid casting the Arab rebels in
a bad light—except that there are any number of other places in Seven
Pillars and his wartime reports where their conduct is shown in equally
bad light. And if, for whatever reason, Lawrence did consciously choose
to avoid telling the story, then why go out of his way in Seven Pillars
to disparage the reputation of the one man, Barrow, best positioned to
publicize it? Of course, to all this there may be a simpler, if more
disturbing, explanation: that amid the wanton slaughter of those last
days in September, Lawrence merely found the ambulance train incident
too trifling to mention.</p>
<p>Lawrence stayed on in Deraa in order to meet with Faisal, who came
over from Azraq the following day. By then, Allenby’s stricture against
the Arabs making for Damascus had been lifted in light of the Turkish
army’s total collapse—in fact, he had ordered all EEF units to stay out
of the Syrian capital so that their Arab allies might have the honor of
entering first—and Lawrence and Faisal discussed plans for establishing
a provisional government there. Then, in the very early morning hours of
September 30, Lawrence and his sometime driver of recent days, Major
Walter Stirling, set off north in the Rolls-Royce sedan they had dubbed
the “Blue Mist.” They drove through a landscape littered with the
corpses of men and animals, some of those who had perished in the Turks’
desperate flight. By that evening, they had reached a ridge overlooking
Damascus, a promontory already crowded with Arab and EEF units poised to
advance into the city at first light.</p>
<p>During that night of waiting, Stirling watched as Lawrence sank into
a mood of deep despondency. To the junior officer, it seemed quite
incomprehensible—“we were on the eve of our entry into Damascus,”
Stirling wrote, “and in sight of the final act which was to crown all
[Lawrence’s] efforts with success”—and he finally asked his companion
what was the matter. “Ever since we took Deraa,” Lawrence replied, “the
end has been inevitable. Now the zest has gone, and the interest.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT ridge outside Damascus, William Yale and the
Italian military attaché were also camped that night, wrapped in
blankets on the ground beside their Model T as they tried to catch a few
hours’ sleep. Shortly after midnight, they were ripped from their
slumber by a tremendous explosion; to the north, an enormous cloud of
smoke and flame rose above Damascus, the countryside for miles around
illuminated in its intense glow. “God Almighty,” Yale said, “the Turks
have blown up Damascus.” That first great explosion was followed by many
smaller ones throughout the night, geysers of flame and bursting shells
arcing across the sky.</p>
<p>At dawn, Yale saw that his fears were misplaced, that Damascus still
stood; the Turks and Germans had only been blowing up their ammunition
and fuel storage depots before they fled the city.</p>
<p>Quite by chance, Yale and de Sambouy had camped that night beside the
same band of journalists who had disappeared on them at General
Headquarters on the eve of the offensive, and for some time that morning
the reunited campmates discussed among themselves whether it might be
safe to venture down into Damascus. The matter was rather decided when
Yale, having briefly gone in search of water for coffee, returned to
discover that the journalists had ditched them once again. “Where a
correspondent goes,” he told de Sambouy, “an attaché can go.” Jumping in
the Model T, they made for the city.</p>
<p>They were plunged into a riotous celebration. In the streets, joyous
crowds of Damascenes sang and danced and beat on drums, and as Arab
warriors on horses and camels fired their rifles into the air, women on
overhead balconies showered them all with rose petals. The deeper the
attachés ventured toward the city center, the more delirious the scenes
became. “Pandemonium reigned,” Yale recalled. “I, who had lived nearly
three years in Palestine under the strain and in fear of the Turks,
could share the madness of the Arabs with the added exhilaration of
being one of the host of deliverers.… We were invited into people’s
homes and had wines and sweetmeats urged upon us. It was a wild hectic
day, the like of which a man is fortunate to experience but once in a
lifetime.”</p>
<p>Lawrence was also experiencing the madness of Damascus that day, if
to much weightier effect. Far earlier than the journalists or the
attachés, he and Stirling had set off for the city in the “Blue Mist,”
only to be detained for several hours by an Indian army guard suspicious
of their Arab headdresses. The delay nearly proved disastrous, for when
Lawrence finally reached Damascus city hall, the gathering point for the
Arab rebel leaders coming into the city, he discovered something of a
coup in progress.</p>
<p>As Faisal’s lieutenants at city hall had set to establishing a
provisional government that morning, they had been joined by two men who
claimed to have already done so the night before; what’s more, these
interlopers maintained, they were King Hussein’s rightful
representatives in Damascus. Lawrence knew the two men well: they were
Abd el Kader, the Algerian traitor who had nearly gotten him killed at
Yarmuk, and his brother, Mohammed Said. Within a few minutes, the
brothers and their followers left city hall, but in hindsight probably
wished they hadn’t. In their absence, Lawrence summarily dismissed their
claim to authority and appointed another man, Shukri Pasha el-Ayubi, as
the interim Damascus military governor.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s timing was impeccable for, just minutes later, General
Henry Chauvel, the Australian commander of the EEF’s Desert Mounted
Corps, showed up at city hall. As the first senior EEF commander to
enter Damascus, Chauvel was under instructions from Allenby to find the
wali, the Turkish-appointed governor, and ask him to temporarily
continue running the city. Instead, at city hall Chauvel was met by
Lawrence, who quickly led him to Shukri Pasha. “I understood that this
official was the Wali,” Chauvel subsequently reported to Allenby, “and I
issued him instructions through Lt. Col. Lawrence to carry on the civil
administration of the city, and informed him that I would find any
military guards and police that he required.” Quite completing this
sleight of hand, Chauvel then asked Lawrence “to assist in these
matters, because I had no Political Officer at the moment at my
disposal.”</p>
<p>What it meant was that in one deft move, Lawrence had established the
legitimacy of his personally chosen Arab “government” in the eyes of the
EEF military authorities. It also meant that for the next crucial few
days, he would be the de facto ruler of Damascus, able to draw on EEF
troops if needed, able to direct the Arabs through the “office” of the
military governor as required.</p>
<p>His first order of business was to neutralize the continuing threat
posed by Abd el Kader and Mohammed Said. Summoning the brothers to city
hall, he informed them that their government had been abolished, and
named a number of Faisal loyalists to positions of authority in its
place. After a tense confrontation that almost led to knifeplay,
Lawrence recounted, “Mohammed Said and Abd el Kader then went away,
breathing vengeance against me as a Christian.” Shortly afterward,
Lawrence had EEF troops called out to quell looting that was occurring
in several parts of the city.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, with some degree of calm restored and Faisal
loyalists now in control, Lawrence dropped by Chauvel’s office to allow
that perhaps there’d been some misunderstanding at their earlier
meeting, that Shukri Pasha was not in fact the Damascus wali, but rather
Lawrence’s own very recent appointee. But if this was couched as a
clarification, Lawrence was also presenting Chauvel with a dare; with
Damascus still a very tense place, the general could either accept the
current arrangement or come up with his own idea and risk the
consequences. Henry Chauvel already disliked Lawrence, but apparently
disliked the prospect of urban insurrection even more; that evening,
Lawrence was able to send his own cable off to Allenby’s headquarters
announcing that Chauvel “agrees with my carrying on with the town
administration until further instructions.”</p>
<p>This he proceeded to do for the next two days, and with a curious
marriage of munificence to severity. Even with looting persisting in
certain quarters, municipal work crews were set to restoring the city’s
electrical system and waterworks. Garbage was collected, a fire brigade
organized, food distributed to the destitute, at the same time that new
disturbances in the city center—purportedly the result of another power
bid by Abd el Kader and his brother—necessitated a firmer hand. “We
called out the Arab troops,” Lawrence blandly noted in his official
report, “put Hotchkiss [machine guns] round the central square, and
imposed peace in three hours after inflicting about twenty
casualties.”</p>
<p>Given their very different roles, it’s not surprising that the paths
of T. E. Lawrence and William Yale intersected just once during those
tumultuous days in Damascus. It’s also understandable, given the weight
of issues he was dealing with, that Lawrence would have no memory of
their meeting; Yale sought him out in order to complain about the
looting of some shops owned by American citizens. Yet the two would
ultimately be joined by a shared experience in Damascus. It was a place
of such unspeakable horror that both would be forever scarred by it, a
place known simply as “the Turkish hospital.”</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of October 2, an Australian officer approached William
Yale in the lobby of his Damascus hotel to ask if he had seen “the
Turkish hospital.” Not familiar with the site, Yale was given directions
to a compound near the railway station, and he and Major de Sambouy soon
made for it.</p>
<p>It was actually a Turkish army barracks fronted by a large parade
ground. Once past the two Australian sentries at the front gate, Yale
recalled, “we crossed the vacant parade ground without seeing a person,
climbed the steps and entered what was a charnel house.”</p>
<p>The Turks had converted the barracks into a makeshift military
hospital, but had abandoned it on September 29 amid their general exodus
from the city, leaving behind some eight hundred wounded or diseased
men. In the intervening three days, those men had been set upon by Arab
marauders who had stripped the place bare of food and medicine, even
tossing many of the invalids onto the floor in their search for
concealed valuables. Other than posting sentries at the front gate, the
Australian detachment that had pitched camp nearby had done nothing for
the desperate and dying patients, neglecting even to bring them
water.</p>
<p>“The floors were slimy with human offal,” Yale recounted, “hundreds
of men lay in small soiled hospital cots everywhere. The dead, the
wounded, the sick [were] lying side by side in their own filth, save for
the corpses on the floor and those who, writhing in agony, had fallen
off their cots.… Most of them suffered in silence; some moaned, others
cried to us pitifully, their tragic eyes filled with terror, following
us as we walked the length of the room.”</p>
<p>Somehow compounding the horror, in a small alcove above the main
floor Yale and de Sambouy found three nurse-orderlies mutely sitting
about a table drinking coffee. “My impression was that they were badly
frightened, hopeless beings who, faced with a horrible and impossible
situation, had lost all capacity to act. They sat drinking coffee in a
hell beyond the ken of one’s imagination.” Seeing enough, the attachés
fled the barracks building and set out in search of someone in
authority—although just what constituted authority that day in Damascus
was not completely clear.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence learned of the Turkish hospital that same afternoon,
and also made for it. He found a scene very much as Yale described,
although, in his more accomplished hand, the macabre details would be
far more graphically rendered: rats had gnawed “wet red galleries” into
the bodies of the dead, many of which “were already swollen twice or
thrice life-width, their fat heads laughing with black mouth.… Of others
the softer parts were fallen in. A few had burst open, and were
liquescent with decay.”</p>
<p>Venturing deep into the room, Lawrence charted a path between the
dead and dying, “holding my white skirts about me [so as] not to dip my
bare feet in their puddled running, when suddenly I heard a sigh.”
Turning, he met the gaze of a still-living man, who whispered, “Aman,
aman (pity).” That call was quickly joined by others, and then by a
“brown waver” as some of the men tried to raise beseeching hands—“a thin
fluttering like withered leaves”—before they fell back again. “No one of
them had strength to speak,” Lawrence recalled, “but there was something
which made me laugh at their whispering in unison, as if by
command.”</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, he immediately took command of the hideous
situation. Finding a group of Turkish doctors idly sitting in an
upstairs room, he ordered them down to the sick ward. Refused help from
the adjacent Australian encampment, he instead had Arab troops bring
food and water, then press-ganged a group of Turkish prisoners to dig a
mass grave for the dead. Even here, though, Lawrence couldn’t resist the
gruesome detail. “The trench was small for them,” he noted of the men
being buried, “but so fluid was the mass that each newcomer, when tipped
in, fell softly, just jellying out the edges of the pile a little with
his weight.”</p>
<p>In his own effort to address the tragedy at the Turkish hospital,
Yale eventually tracked down the recently arrived Gilbert Clayton. Over
the course of their dealings in Cairo, Yale had developed a keen
distaste for the brigadier general, finding him a cold and hard man, and
nothing in Clayton’s manner at their meeting on the night of October 2
changed that view. After hearing out the attaché’s impassioned plea for
something to be done, Clayton calmly said, “Yale, you’re not a military
man.” Seeing the rage building in Yale’s eyes, he then added, “You need
not be offended; I’m not a soldier either.”</p>
<p>So deeply did the Turkish hospital incident affect Lawrence and Yale
that it would dominate the one dialogue they were to have in the postwar
era, an exchange of letters in 1929. While Yale’s initiating letter has
been lost, he clearly pressed Lawrence for details on the subject,
considering that fully a third of Lawrence’s handwritten reply—some four
hundred words—was devoted to explaining his own actions at the hospital.
The episode would also figure prominently in both men’s memoirs and, in
the process, offer an intriguing glimpse into their very different
personalities.</p>
<p>For William Yale, the guilt he felt over the Turkish hospital was to
make for perhaps the most heartfelt and anguished passage in his
manuscript. “Nothing I did during the whole war period do I regret so
deeply and with such shame as my failure to use my position wisely and
calmly to alleviate the atrocious suffering of those eight hundred men.
May their curses be upon my head.” But self-recrimination was never one
of Yale’s strong suits, and after just two more sentences, he’d settled
on a new culprit to blame. “I lay this horror at the door of European
imperialism, to be added to the multitude of crimes already committed in
its name.”</p>
<p>As might be expected, Lawrence’s description in Seven Pillars, in
addition to being far more visceral, was also—perhaps unconsciously—far
more self-revelatory. By that account, Lawrence returned to the hospital
the next day to find conditions vastly improved as a result of his
efforts, only to be confronted by an irate Australian major. Clad in his
Arab robes, Lawrence didn’t bother to identify himself as a lieutenant
colonel, even when the junior officer demanded to know who was in charge
of the still-ghastly scene. When Lawrence acknowledged he was in charge,
the Australian major spat “bloody brute,” slapped Lawrence across the
face, and stormed off.</p>
<p>If that is a rather peculiar passage to appear on the penultimate
page of a 660-page book that has as its subtitle “A Triumph,” there is
also something about the moment that somehow rings a bit false; as with
some of the Tafas details, it feels just a little too neat, too much of
a stage-play coda. Yet, fictional or not, that major’s slap served a
great function, for it left Lawrence “more ashamed than angry, for in my
heart I felt he was right, and that anyone who pushed through to success
a rebellion of the weak against their masters must come out of it so
stained in estimation that, afterward, nothing in the world would make
him feel clean.”</p>
<p>For the remainder of his life, Lawrence was to feel stained by what
he had seen and done during the war, and in his struggle to ever “feel
clean” again, repeatedly looked to self-abnegation and violence against
himself—violence far worse than a major’s slap—as recompense for his
sins.</p>
<p>THE MEETING TOOK place in a second-floor stateroom of the finest
hotel in Damascus, the Victoria, on the afternoon of October 3. Just
eight men were present: on the British side, Generals Allenby and
Chauvel, together with their chiefs of staff; on the Arab side, Faisal
ibn Hussein, his chief of staff, Nuri Said, and Sherif Nasir of Medina.
Acting as intermediary and interpreter was T. E. Lawrence. Despite its
profound importance—in that stateroom much of the future history, and
tragedy, of the Middle East was to be set in motion—no official record
was kept.</p>
<p>General Allenby had arrived in the Syrian capital just hours earlier.
Never the most patient of men, he was in a particularly cantankerous
mood that day. With his offensive still ongoing—his vanguard was
continuing a relentless pursuit of the Turks as they fled north—he’d
been forced to take time away from his martial duties to sort out the
increasingly nettlesome political situation in Damascus. As a result,
when informed that Faisal, arriving on a three o’clock train from Deraa,
would be slow in reaching the Victoria on account of his planned
triumphal entry into the city on horseback, Allenby had thundered,
“Triumphal entry be damned,” and ordered Faisal to be brought to the
hotel at once.</p>
<p>Although the general may not have been fully aware of it—or more
likely was too distracted to care—the astounding initial success of his
Palestinian offensive had caused the French government to frantically
reassert their claims to Syria as codified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement;
on September 23, the British government had largely acquiesced to their
demands. The result was that two days later Allenby received a set of
instructions from the Foreign Office so obtuse as to be nearly
nonsensical. After stating that “the British Government adhere to their
declared policy with regard to Syria, namely that should it fall into
the sphere of interest of any European Power, that Power should be
France,” the September 25 instructions reminded Allenby that under the
terms of Sykes-Picot, “you will notice that France and Britain undertake
to uphold jointly the independence of any Arab State that may be set up
in Area (A)”—meaning Syria. From these two seemingly opposed clauses
arose an appropriately muddled proposed course of action, that “if
General Allenby advances to Damascus, it would be most desirable that,
in conformity with the Anglo-French Agreement of 1916 he should, if
possible, work through an Arab administration by means of a French
liaison.”</p>
<p>With London apparently deciding these instructions weren’t
sufficiently baffling, they were followed on October 1 by a second set
that rather settled the matter. Now Allenby was told that since “the
belligerent status of the Arabs fighting for the liberation of their
territories from Turkish rule” had been recognized by the Allied powers,
“the regions so liberated [by the Arabs] should properly be treated as
Allied territory enjoying the status of an independent State (or
confederation of States) of friendly Arabs.” A sudden burst of clarity,
perhaps, except this statement was followed by the curious rider that
should “the Arab authorities [in Syria] request the assistance or advice
of European functionaries, we are bound under the Anglo-French Agreement
to let these be French.” In essence, it appeared Sykes-Picot was being
invoked to annul and uphold the accord simultaneously, the intent
changing from one sentence to the next.</p>
<p>In first hearing of this hash at the Victoria Hotel, Lawrence
undoubtedly felt a note of alarm. It was his understanding that
Sykes-Picot was a dead letter, and had been for quite some time; for it
to return to the conversation now for any purpose was ominous. On the
positive side, Allenby’s instructions explicitly recognized the Arab
claim to Syrian independence, and since Faisal had no intention of
asking for European assistance or advice—that had been the whole point
of establishing an interim government—it surely meant the rider about a
French liaison officer was moot.</p>
<p>But matters were about to take a very ugly turn—or rather, a series
of ugly turns. As recounted by General Chauvel, Allenby announced that
Faisal actually didn’t have any choice in the matter, that France was to
be the “protecting power” of Syria. Additionally, even though Faisal, as
his father’s representative, “was to have the administration of
Syria”—albeit “under French guidance and financial backing”—that
administration didn’t extend to either Palestine or Lebanon, but “would
include the hinterland of Syria only.” “Hinterland” was truly the
operative word since, as Faisal was further informed, the boundaries of
Lebanon had now been demarcated as the entire Mediterranean coastline
from Palestine to the Gulf of Alexandretta, making Syria a landlocked
nation. As a final insult, Allenby told Faisal that he would be
immediately assigned a French liaison officer, “who would work for the
present with Lawrence, who would be expected to give him every
assistance.”</p>
<p>Both Faisal and Lawrence were stunned. As Chauvel recounted, Faisal
fiercely argued that it was his understanding “from the advisor whom
Allenby had sent him”—meaning Lawrence—that in return for ceding
Palestine, “the Arabs were to have the whole of Syria, including the
Lebanon.” Furthermore, he flatly refused to have a French liaison
officer attached to him, “or to recognize French guidance in any
way.”</p>
<p>At this tense impasse, Allenby turned to Lawrence. “But did you not
tell him that the French were to have the Protectorate over Syria?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Lawrence responded, according to Chauvel, “I know nothing
about it.”</p>
<p>“But you knew definitely that he, Faisal, was to have nothing to do
with the Lebanon?” Allenby persisted.</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Lawrence replied, “I did not.”</p>
<p>Allenby tried to defuse the situation by offering that these were
only temporary measures, that all would be resolved at the great postwar
peace conference being planned, but Faisal would have none of it; he
knew full well that temporary measures in such circumstances had a
tendency to become permanent ones. It left the British commander with
only military rank to fall back on. Allenby reminded Faisal that,
technically, both he and the Arab Northern Army remained under his
overall command; as a result, the rebel leader had no choice but to obey
orders.</p>
<p>After perhaps an hour, a shaken Faisal Hussein left the Victoria
Hotel, to be greeted, ironically, by an enormous crowd of supporters.
Lawrence did not accompany him. Instead, he stayed behind in the hotel
stateroom to make a request of General Allenby.</p>
<p>THE DAM HAD burst. Through the rest of October, the EEF and their
Arab allies pursued the remnants of the Turkish armies north, swiftly
overwhelming whatever rearguard resistance the enemy could offer. It
wasn’t until the end of the month that Turkish general Mustafa Kemal,
the future Kemal Ataturk, finally managed to establish a new defensive
line at the very edge of the Turkish Anatolian heartland. By then,
though, all of Syria was gone and the Constantinople regime was suing
for peace. That culminated in the Armistice of Mudros on October 31; at
just about the same time, the fallen Three Pashas—Djemal, Enver, and
Talaat—slipped aboard a German torpedo boat and made their escape across
the Black Sea.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the Turkish dam that had burst. In one of the more
peculiar chain reactions in history, given that their military efforts
had been largely autonomous, all the Central Powers had come to their
breaking points at precisely the same moment, and all now fell
together—Bulgaria at the end of September, and then Turkey and
Austro-Hungary in the span of a mere six days. As might be expected,
Germany held out the longest, but only by the matter of a week. With
their vaunted Hindenburg Line overrun in a half dozen places and their
soldiers surrendering en masse, in the early morning hours of November
11, German negotiators met with their Allied counterparts in a railroad
car in a French forest to sign papers of armistice, scheduled to take
effect at 11 a.m. that same day. In a fittingly obscene finale to this
most senseless of wars, a number of Western Front units continued to
fight right up until that eleventh hour was struck, with the result that
some four thousand more soldiers died on the last morning of the
war.</p>
<p>Curt Prüfer had observed much of this staggering cascade of events
from the vantage point of Switzerland, to which he had crossed in late
September. Even as all fell down around him, the German spymaster had
continued with his scheme to try to woo the wayward eldest son of Abbas
Hilmi back into the Central Powers’ fold, the keystone, in some
inscrutable way, toward forging a German-Turkish-Egyptian alliance that
might yet ride to triumph in the Middle East. A mentally unstable sadist
Abdel Moneim may well have been, but he still had enough wits about him
in October 1918 to realize that his German suitor’s scheme was
ludicrous. At the end of that month, an empty-handed Prüfer crossed back
over to Germany, just in time to witness the final fall of his beloved
Fatherland.</p>
<p>For a time, Aaron Aaronsohn had also been a distant observer of the
events of that autumn—in his case, from the even farther remove of the
United States. In mid-October, however, with the downfall of the Central
Powers clearly imminent, he hurried aboard a passenger ship in New York
for the return to England. Once Turkey and Germany capitulated,
Aaronsohn knew, all attention would turn to the international peace
conference being planned in Paris, and he was determined to make his
presence there known, to press for the promises given to the Zionists in
the Balfour Declaration.</p>
<p>By contrast, William Yale experienced the climax of the war
firsthand. Through October, he followed the victorious British army
north through Syria, and was in Aleppo when news of the German armistice
came. Afterward, he made his way back to Cairo, not at all sure what his
future held. Reluctant to go home, but with little to do in Egypt, he
fixated on trying to get himself attached in some capacity to the
American delegation at the upcoming Paris Peace Conference. “I
feverishly wrote report after report,” he recounted, “hoping that
through them I could persuade someone to order me to Paris. My reports
grew poorer and poorer.”</p>
<p>That decline in quality apparently did the trick, for in late
December Yale received a cable ordering him to the French capital. He
was to report there to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, to
serve as their “expert on Arabian affairs.” As Yale would write in a
moment of rare modesty, “the title flabbergasted me.”</p>
<p>Paradoxically, of the various spies and intelligence agents who had
parried with one another across the Middle East over the previous few
years, the one most completely removed from events at the war’s close
was T. E. Lawrence. He had ensured that on the afternoon of October 3,
in the second-floor stateroom of the Victoria Hotel in Damascus.</p>
<p>Once Faisal had left that room after his meeting with Allenby,
Lawrence had turned to the general and requested to be given leave.
Apparently, Allenby initially assumed it was a request for a few days’
rest—that was easy enough to arrange and certainly well deserved—but
Lawrence clarified that he wanted to leave altogether, to go home to
England. At first, Allenby flatly refused; the Syrian campaign was still
a very active one, it relied greatly on British officers whom the Arabs
trusted, and they trusted no one more than Lieutenant Colonel
Lawrence.</p>
<p>According to Henry Chauvel, Lawrence then raised the stakes
considerably by telling Allenby “that he would not work with a French
Liaison officer, and that he was due for leave and thought he had better
take it now and go off to England.” Whether in anger at Lawrence’s
insubordination or in respect at his sense of honor—the accounts of
Chauvel and Lawrence differ on this—Allenby finally relented. “Yes,” he
told Lawrence, “I think you had.”</p>
<p>Since late 1916, Lawrence had waged a quiet war against his own
government, and now he had lost. What would soon become clear, however,
was that he intended to continue that fight off the battlefield, in the
conference halls and meeting rooms of peacetime Paris. He may have asked
to leave Damascus out of exhaustion, but it was also to prepare for the
next round in the struggle for Arab independence.</p>
<p>The following afternoon, Lawrence was conducted out of Damascus. He
was leaving the city he had invoked as a battle cry for two years. One
hundred and fifty miles to the northeast of Damascus lay Jerablus, the
place where he had spent the happiest days of his life. To Damascus or
Jerablus, Lawrence would never return.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Blast the Lawrence side of things. He was a cad I’ve killed.</p>
<p>T. E. SHAW, ALIAS OF T. E. LAWRENCE, TO H. C. ARMSTRONG, OCTOBER 6,
1924</p>
<p>Everything T. E. Lawrence had fought for, schemed for, arguably
betrayed his country for, turned to ashes in a single five-minute
conversation between the prime ministers of Great Britain and France. In
London on the morning of December 1, 1918, David Lloyd George took aside
a visiting Georges Clemenceau and bluntly outlined just what Britain
wanted in the Middle East: Iraq and Palestine. In tacit exchange,
although Lloyd George would always deny it, France would have free rein
in Syria. It was a proposed “solution” to the spoils-of-war contest that
had strained British and French relations ever since they had cast their
covetous eyes toward the Middle East, and that had now taken on great
urgency; with the Great War finally over and the Paris Peace Conference
about to begin, it was vital that Britain and France present a unified
front against the American president, Woodrow Wilson, with his
high-minded talk of a “peace without victory” and the rights of
oppressed peoples to self-determination. Faced with this imminent
American threat, Clemenceau quickly acceded to Lloyd George’s
proposal.</p>
<p>In essence, the two imperial victors had not only affirmed the basic
structure of the Sykes-Picot Agreement but gone beyond it, giving
themselves more and the Arabs even less. But in the time-honored
tradition of European secret deals, it was to be a while before anyone
outside the British and French prime ministers’ closest circles would
have any knowledge of that extraordinary accord. Certainly T. E.
Lawrence had no intimation of it.</p>
<p>What followed in Paris was a yearlong shadow play that first raised
hopes of a new era in relations between nations, Woodrow Wilson’s
vaunted “new world order,” only to degenerate into backroom deals,
vengeful treaties, and arbitrary borders. Many books, foremost among
them Margaret MacMillan’s definitive Paris 1919, have been written about
the Paris Peace Conference and the immensely complicated maneuverings of
great powers and nationalist supplicants. As far as the Middle East was
concerned, the byzantine machinations meant, in the end, virtually
nothing. “The Great Loot,” the carving up of the carcass of the Ottoman
Empire, would now come to pass.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence did not try mightily to advance the Arab cause.
Acting as Faisal’s counselor during the Paris talks, he constantly
floated schemes to give them control of the lands they had fought so
fiercely for, while he also lobbied senior British statesmen and wrote
passionate editorials in the Arabs’ defense. But Lawrence’s usefulness
to the British government had ended. In an exquisite irony, at precisely
the same time he was becoming a household name in Britain—an estimated
one million Britons, including the king and queen, would flock to see
Lowell Thomas’s lecture show “With Allenby in Palestine, and Lawrence in
Arabia”—government officials were penning memos calling Lawrence “a
malign influence,” and “to a large extent responsible for our troubles
with the French over Syria.” Finally, he was simply stripped of his
credentials at Paris and barred from assisting Faisal in the talks.
Lawrence had lost the peace.</p>
<p>There was at least one extraordinary aspect of Lawrence’s diplomatic
efforts, however, that bears emphasis. Having long known that control of
the Palestine portion of Syria was lost to the Arabs, Lawrence and
Faisal sought an ally to affirm their nationalist aspirations for the
rest of it. They found such an ally in Chaim Weizmann. By the close of
1918, the Zionists had strong patrons in both the British and American
governments, but what made those governments nervous was the
continuing—in fact, growing—hostility of the Palestinian Arab population
to the Zionists’ goals. So what if Hashemite support for the Zionist
program in Palestine could be traded for Zionist support of an
independent Arab Syria? Over the course of that December, Lawrence,
Faisal, and Weizmann worked out the details for such a mutually
beneficial relationship, culminating in a joint proclamation on the eve
of the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<p>In that proclamation, Faisal and Weizmann announced their intention
to work together in Paris, and in recognition of each other’s claims.
Surely the most controversial of the nine articles of the
Faisal-Weizmann Agreement was the fourth: “All necessary measures shall
be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine
on a large scale.” To this document, Faisal—or more likely, Lawrence—had
inserted a key closing proviso. The agreement was only valid so long as
Syrian independence was achieved; barring that, it was null and
void.</p>
<p>Yet in their desperation to find a supporting partner at the peace
conference, Lawrence and Faisal had chosen to ignore several crucial
details. While the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement offered a fairly detailed
outline for the administration of Palestine, nowhere did it specify what
Palestine actually consisted of. Further, in reaching his accord with
Weizmann, Faisal had quite flagrantly turned his back on the doctrine of
self-determination for Palestine, placing him in a weakened—some would
say hypocritical—position in invoking that same doctrine for the rest of
Syria. Most troublesome, Chaim Weizmann had recently made public just
what he and other Zionists envisioned as the future status of Palestine.
“The establishment of a National Home for the Jewish people,” he had
announced in mid-November, “is understood to mean that the country of
Palestine should be placed under such political, economic and moral
conditions as will favor the increase of the Jewish population, so that
in accordance with the principle of democracy, it may ultimately develop
into a Jewish Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>By going into partnership with the Zionists under such circumstances,
Faisal had just handed his more conservative Arab and Muslim rivals a
powerful weapon to use against him. One who would soon wield that weapon
to devastating effect was King Hussein’s chief rival in Arabia,
ibn-Saud, and his fundamentalist Wahhabist followers.</p>
<p>IN THE LAST sentence of his memoir, William Yale referred to the
Paris Peace Conference as “the prologue of the 20th century tragedy.”
Yale served as an expert on Middle Eastern affairs to the American
delegation in Paris and, like Lawrence, put forth great efforts to
achieve a sustainable peace in the region. As with his British
counterpart, with whom he sometimes aligned himself, these efforts were
thwarted at every turn.</p>
<p>Yale placed much of the blame on his own government. To him, the
grand enterprise in Paris seemed a rather perfect reflection of Woodrow
Wilson’s peculiar blend of idealism and arrogance. In the American
president’s almost comic fondness for tidy enumerated lists—his
“Fourteen Points” had been followed by his “Four Principles,” his “Four
Ends,” and finally his “Five Particulars”—was the hint of a simplistic
mind-set, as if solving the world’s myriad messy problems was merely a
matter of isolating them into their component parts and applying
quasi-mathematical principles. Nowhere was this more problematic than
when it came to Wilson’s cherished and oft-cited notion of
“self-determination.” While the phrase certainly sounded good, in the
mashed-together cultures of Europe and the Middle East of the early
twentieth century, where faith and ethnicity and nationalism were all
exerting tremendous and often opposing pulls, just whose claim to
self-determination was to win out over others? London and Paris had
repeatedly warned Wilson on the dangers of opening up this Pandora’s
box, but there had never been any indication that the president was
listening.</p>
<p>To William Yale’s mind, all of this was actually symptomatic of
perhaps the greatest paradox underlying the American role at the Paris
Peace Conference: Woodrow Wilson’s grand vision of a new world order
rested on a bedrock of profound ignorance. That was made clear on the
very day Yale arrived in Paris and met with his new supervisor, William
Westermann, and the other members of the American delegation’s Middle
Eastern research section. Granted, the Middle East was a lesser American
concern at the peace conference since the United States hadn’t gone to
war with Turkey, but it still struck Yale that Westermann, a classics
professor from the University of Wisconsin, might have rounded up a
panel with at least some familiarity with the region. Instead, they
included a specialist in Latin American studies, an American Indian
historian, a scholar on the Crusades, and two Persian linguistics
professors.</p>
<p>The picture was completed when Yale was handed a briefing book on
Syria, a 107-page compendium of historic, economic, and political data
that was serving as the principal guide in formulating American policy
in the region. The Report on the Desires of the Syrians didn’t require a
lot of study on Yale’s part; almost all the citations in those sections
dealing with events since 1914 were drawn from a single source, a State
Department special agent in Cairo named William Yale.</p>
<p>Several times Yale saw opportunities for championing the cause of
Arab self-determination, but they always slipped away on the tide of
American inaction. At a meeting with Faisal in mid-February 1919, Yale
was taken aback when the Arab leader bluntly proposed an American
mandate in Syria, vastly preferring the supposedly disinterested
Americans to the French. By then, however, Yale had already been with
the American delegation in Paris long enough to realize that, virtuous
principles aside, the Wilson administration was more interested in
dictating solutions to the rest of the world than in assuming any
responsibility of its own. And there was another problem, one that may
not have been readily apparent to non-Americans. Its brief burst of
international involvement notwithstanding, the United States was already
showing signs of sliding back into an isolationist spirit, with Wilson
and his Republican opponents who dominated in Congress increasingly at
loggerheads. What it meant for all those in Paris looking to the United
States for leadership was that time was not on their side, that the
longer things dragged on, the less likely the Americans would have the
ability or even the interest to do much at all. Very quickly, for Yale
and others in the American Middle Eastern division, there came the
deeply dispiriting sense that matters were slipping away. “We fought
over boundary lines as if the destiny of the world depended upon it,”
Yale recalled of that time. “We fumed and fussed because Wilson and [his
chief advisor Edward] House seemed to pay no attention to what we were
doing. It all seemed strangely academic and futile to me.”</p>
<p>As the peace conference extended, the folly of Yale’s mission would
only grow increasingly absurd. In the late spring of 1919, he was
appointed to an American fact-finding committee, the King-Crane
Commission, which, in pursuit of Wilson’s self-determination principle,
was dispatched to determine the desires of the former denizens of the
Ottoman world, “to take a plebiscite,” in Yale’s skeptical view, “of a
vast sprawling empire of 30,000,000 inhabitants.” Unsurprisingly, after
a tour of two months, and scores of meetings in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon,
and Palestine, the message the commission had heard in each place was
unequivocal: the vast majority of people wanted either independence or
the Americans. In light of this, the commission came up with a sweeping
set of recommendations that placed the United States at the forefront of
administering a solution to the Middle Eastern puzzle. That solution,
however, did not at all resemble what had already been secretly agreed
to by the British and the French, nor what the Wilson administration was
willing to take on. At least here, the administration was prepared to
act with great dispatch; the King-Crane reports were swiftly locked away
in a safe, not to be seen or read by the outside world for the next
three years.</p>
<p>Returning to Europe from that mission in the fall of 1919, Yale would
make one last attempt to salvage the situation in Syria, enlisting
Lawrence’s support for what became known as the Yale Plan. With the plan
drawing support from senior British statesmen, it briefly appeared the
coming showdown between the Arabs and French in Syria might be averted.
But Yale was essentially acting in a freelance capacity, and once senior
American officials learned of it, his plan was quickly scuttled. On
November 1, 1919, British troops who had occupied Syria until a final
settlement was reached began to withdraw. On that same day, French
troops began moving in. Days later, Yale resigned from the American
peace delegation in disgust and sailed back to New York.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence lost hope at about the same time. As his mother would
relate to a biographer, her son slipped into a state of “extreme
depression and nervous exhaustion” that autumn, and during visits home
he “would sometimes sit the entire morning between breakfast and lunch
in the same position, without moving, and with the same expression on
his face.”</p>
<p>PART OF THE enduring fascination with T. E. Lawrence’s story is the
series of painful “what if?” questions it raises, a pondering over what
the world lost when he lost. What would have happened if, in 1918, the
Arabs had been able to create the greater Arab nation that many so
desperately sought, and which they believed had been promised them? How
different would the Middle East look today if the early Zionists in
postwar Palestine had been able to negotiate with a man like Faisal
Hussein, who had talked of “the racial kinship and ancient bonds” that
existed between Jew and Arab? And what of the Americans? Today, it
scarcely seems conceivable that there was a time when the Arab and
Muslim worlds were clamoring for American intervention in their lands;
what might have happened if the United States had risen to the
opportunity presented at the end of World War I?</p>
<p>In all probability, not quite the golden age some might imagine. As
Lawrence himself frequently stated, the notion of a true pan-Arab nation
was always something of a mirage, the differences between its radically
varied cultures far greater than what united them. Perhaps such a
fractious and vast nation could have endured for a time through sheer
lack of strong central control, much as under the Ottomans’ old system,
but advances in technology and communication would almost certainly have
soon brought these disparate cultures and peoples into conflict.
Similarly, there were never going to be truly harmonious relations
between the Jews and the Arabs in Palestine, given that Arab resistance
to an expanded Jewish presence long preceded the Balfour Declaration and
took little notice of Faisal’s moderation; indeed, the one postwar Arab
leader who would try to reach an accommodation with Israel, Faisal’s
brother Abdullah, would be assassinated by a Palestinian gunman for his
troubles. As for American occupying troops being hailed as liberators,
that surely would have been short-lived too, ending when those troops
were drawn into policing local conflicts they little understood, with
the inevitable choosing of sides this entails. Even if it somehow
managed to avoid those treacherous straits, the United States would
certainly have shed its image as “the one disinterested party” as it
steadily became an imperial power in its own right.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s hard to imagine that any of this could possibly
have produced a sadder history than what has actually transpired over
the past century, a catalog of war, religious strife, and brutal
dictatorships that has haunted not just the Middle East but the entire
world. That sad history began from almost the moment the negotiators in
Paris packed their bags and declared their mission complete, leaving in
their wake “a porcelain peace.”</p>
<p>Denied Lawrence’s assistance in the autumn of 1919, a desperate
Faisal was forced to accept the few crumbs of compromise the French were
willing to throw his way in Syria. When Faisal returned to Damascus,
however, he found himself denounced as a traitor for selling the nation
out to the European imperialists. Harnessing this popular rage, Faisal
renounced his deal with the French and in March 1920 staged something of
a palace coup by declaring himself king of Syria. That act, in
conjunction with the San Remo conference the following month at which
Great Britain and France formalized their partition of the
region—Britain taking Iraq and a “greater” Palestine that included a
broad swath east of the Jordan River, or Transjordan, France the rest of
Syria—set Faisal on a collision course with the French. That collision
came in July; after a brief and one-sided battle on the outskirts of
Damascus, the French ousted Faisal and cast him into exile. By the close
of 1920, the French at last had much of their Syrie intégrale (with the
exception of the British mandate in Palestine and Transjordan), but they
now faced a populace seething with rage. They also now confronted an
external threat; in the deserts of Transjordan, Faisal’s brother
Abdullah was massing his followers with the intention of marching on
Damascus.</p>
<p>But whatever problems the French had at the end of 1920 were dwarfed
by those of the British. In Palestine, tensions between Zionist
immigrants and the resident Arab population had escalated into
bloodshed. In Arabia, ibn-Saud was once again pushing to oust King
Hussein. The worst crisis point was in Iraq. The previous year, Lawrence
had predicted full-scale revolt against British rule there by March 1920
“if we don’t mend our ways,” but he had been off by two months; by the
time the May rebellion in Iraq was put down, some one thousand British
and nine thousand natives were dead. As Lawrence would explain in his
1929 letter to William Yale, at Paris, Great Britain and France had
taken the discredited Sykes-Picot Agreement and fashioned something even
worse; how much worse was evidenced by the myriad fires that had spread
across the region almost immediately.</p>
<p>To combat these crises, in December 1920 Lloyd George turned to a man
who had become something of a pariah in British ruling circles, former
first lord of the admiralty, Winston Churchill. One of Churchill’s first
acts upon assuming the position of Colonial Office secretary was to
enlist the help of another recent outcast, former lieutenant colonel T.
E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>At least initially, Lawrence had little interest in rejoining the
fray. Immersed in writing his memoirs, and undoubtedly still smarting
over his shabby treatment by Lloyd George’s government the previous
year, he told Churchill he was too busy and that he had left politics
behind. He only relented when the new colonial secretary assured him
that he would have a virtually free hand in helping fundamentally
reshape the British portion of the Middle Eastern chessboard at the
upcoming Cairo Conference. As a result, the Cairo deliberations were
little more than a formality, with Lawrence and Churchill having worked
out ahead of time, as Lawrence told a biographer, “not only [the]
questions the Conference would consider, but decisions they would
reach.”</p>
<p>Iraq was now to be consolidated and recognized as an Arab kingdom,
with Faisal placed on the throne. In Arabia, the British upheld
Hussein’s claim to rule in the Hejaz, while simultaneously upholding
ibn-Saud’s authority in the Arabian interior. Surely the most novel idea
to come out of Cairo was the plan designed to stay Abdullah from
attacking the French in Syria. At the close of the conference, Lawrence
journeyed to Abdullah’s base camp in Amman and convinced the truculent
Arab leader to first try to establish a government in the Transjordan
region of Britain’s Palestine mandate. To Lawrence’s great surprise—and
perhaps to Abdullah’s as well—this most indolent of Hussein’s four sons
actually proved to be a remarkably good administrator; in the near
future, Transjordan was to be officially detached from the rest of
Palestine and made an independent Arab kingdom—today’s Jordan—with
Abdullah as its ruler. By the time Lawrence returned to England in the
autumn of 1921, his one-year service to the Colonial Office nearly over,
he had quite literally become the unseen kingmaker of the Middle
East.</p>
<p>But if all this brought a measure of stability to the center of the
old Ottoman Empire map, it did little to improve matters to the north
and south. There, the situation remained uncertain and bloody for some
time to come.</p>
<p>In Anatolia, the former Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, the hero of
Gallipoli, had refused to accept the dismemberment of Turkey as outlined
by the Allies. Over a four-year period, he led his army of Turkish
nationalists into battle against all those who would claim a piece of
the Turkish heartland, before finally establishing the modern-day
borders of Turkey in 1923. France’s turn in this round robin of war came
in the autumn of 1921 when Kemal, soon to become better known as
Ataturk, turned his attention to the French troops occupying the Cilicia
region. Quickly routed, the French armies in Cilicia beat a hasty
retreat back into Syria under the leadership of their commander, the
unlucky Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>At the same time, a bewildering arc of war extended from the Caucasus
all the way to Afghanistan as various nationalist groups, Russian Reds
and Whites, and remnants of the Young Turks battled for primacy, forming
and reforming alliances with such dizzying regularity as to defy both
logic and comprehension. Among the prominent aspirants in this crucible
were both Enver and Djemal Pasha, and it was no more surprising than
anything else going on in the region that Djemal Pasha should turn up in
Kabul in the winter of 1921 as a military advisor to the king of
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And then, far to the south, it was King Hussein’s turn. With the
British having long since tired of his mercurial rule and refusal to
accept the political realities of the Middle East—in 1921, Lawrence had
spent a maddening two months in Jeddah futilely trying to get Hussein to
accept the Cairo Conference accords—he was all but defenseless when
ibn-Saud and his Wahhabist warriors finally closed on Mecca in late
1924. Hustled to the coast and then onto a British destroyer, Hussein
was first taken to exile in Cyprus, before finally joining his son
Abdullah in his new capital of Amman, Jordan. The deposed king, who had
once dreamt of a pan-Arab nation extending from Mecca to Baghdad, died
there in 1931 at the age of seventy-six.</p>
<p>From there, matters simply turned worse for the West. By the 1930s,
the British faced a quagmire in the Palestine mandate they had schemed
so hard to obtain, first a full-scale Arab revolt fueled by increasing
Jewish immigration into the region, joined after World War II by attacks
from Jewish guerrillas who saw the British occupiers as the last
roadblock toward the creation of Israel. In 1946, the war-exhausted
French were forced to give up their cherished Syrie intégrale, but not
before carving out a new nation, Lebanon, from its territory; within
three years, Syria’s pro-Western democratic government would be ousted
in a military coup, and the convoluted governing structure imposed by
the French in Lebanon would set the country on the path to civil war. In
1952, British control of Egypt ended when their puppet king was
overthrown by Gamal Abdel Nasser and his nationalist Free Officers
Movement, followed six years later by a military coup in Iraq by
like-minded junior officers that ended the pro-Western monarchy
established by Faisal. By the 1960s, with the era of European
imperialism drawing to its unceremonious close, the Middle East
resembled the shambles the colonial powers were leaving behind in other
parts of the globe, but with one crucial difference: because of oil, the
region had now become the most strategically vital corner on earth, and
the West couldn’t walk away from the mess it had helped create there
even if it wanted to. What has transpired there over the past half
century is, of course, familiar to all: four wars between the Arabs and
Israelis; a ten-year civil war in Lebanon and a twenty-year one in
Yemen; the slaughter of ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq; four
decades of state-sponsored terrorism; convulsions of religious
extremism; four major American military interventions and a host of
smaller ones; and for the Arab people, until very recently, a virtually
unbroken string of cruel and/or kleptocratic dictatorships stretching
from Tunisia to Iraq that left the great majority impoverished and
disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Certainly, blame for all this doesn’t rest solely with the terrible
decisions that were made at the end of World War I, but it was then that
one particularly toxic seed was planted. Ever since, Arab society has
tended to define itself less by what it aspires to become than by what
it is opposed to: colonialism, Zionism, Western imperialism in its many
forms. This culture of opposition has been manipulated—indeed,
feverishly nurtured—by generations of Arab dictators intent on
channeling their people’s anger away from their own misrule in favor of
the external threat, whether it is “the great Satan” or the
“illegitimate Zionist entity” or Western music playing on the streets of
Cairo. This is also why the so-called Arab Spring movement of today
represents such a potentially transformative moment in the history of
the Middle East. For the first time since 1918, the “Arab street” is
having a say in its own future, and however many roadblocks are thrown
in its way, an element of civic participation and personal freedom is
being spawned that likely can never be boxed back up. To the degree that
genuine democracy and self-determination does take hold—and in a region
that has been politically and intellectually stunted for so long, it’s
easy to only focus on the short-term chaos—the Arab world might finally
embark upon the path envisioned for it by Lawrence and a handful of
other dreamers a century ago.</p>
<p>MARK SYKES, the man whose name has become synonymous with the
disastrous policies the West pursued in the Middle East after World War
I, didn’t live to see their effect. Having swiftly gone from
indispensable fix-it man to scapegoat in the eyes of the British Foreign
Office for his coauthorship of the detested Sykes-Picot Agreement, in
the autumn of 1918 Sykes embarked on an extended tour of the postwar
Middle East. His diminished stature hadn’t engendered a bout of modesty,
however; as he informed the Foreign Office in proposing his trip, along
with calming Arab-Jewish tensions in Palestine, he intended to help
reorganize the Allied political and military infrastructure in Syria,
cajole the British Indian regime in Iraq into adopting a more
progressive, postimperial mien, and “assist in promoting good relations
between Arabs and French.”</p>
<p>For two months, Sykes and his small entourage crisscrossed the
region, each day filled with an exhausting schedule of events. But even
this most vainglorious of men must have seen that in the Middle East,
just as in London, his sway was vastly reduced. In Damascus, Sykes
called on Gilbert Clayton, once an attentive listener to his various
initiatives, only to encounter a pronounced mulishness. Unknown to
Sykes, Clayton had recently received advice from an official in London
on how to handle his visitor. “Don’t take Mark at his own valuation,”
the official had cautioned. “His shares are unsaleable here and he has
been sent out (at his own request) to get him away.”</p>
<p>Yet as humbling as this journey was, it seemed to spark in Sykes a
genuine reappraisal of his views on the Middle East. In January 1919, as
he wrote up an “appreciation” of his just-completed trip, he allowed
that both Britain and France had been quite wrong in their approach in
the region. In a line he could have lifted from Lawrence’s Twenty-Seven
Articles, he now suggested that “whoever takes over Syria ought to
realize that to have a purely native administration running things
badly, but with prospects of improvement, represents more real progress
than having a European staff doing things properly, but [with] the
natives learning nothing.” It was a remarkable evolution in thinking in
the man who three years earlier had coauthored what would turn out to be
the last great compact in the service of European imperialism.</p>
<p>But it was too late. By the time Sykes showed up at the Paris Peace
Conference in early February, his British colleagues were less
interested in any evolution of his thinking than in extricating
themselves from the agreement that bore his name. In the close quarters
of Paris, the scorn with which they regarded Sykes took on an element of
bullying. “I said something to him about the agreement,” Lloyd George
would recall in his memoirs, “and at once saw how I had cut him. I am
sorry. I wish I had said nothing. I blame myself. He did his best.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the prime minister’s contrition stemmed from what soon
followed. On the evening of February 10, Sykes took to bed early,
complaining of feeling run-down. By the next morning, he couldn’t stand.
Doctors quickly diagnosed Spanish influenza, and for the next five days
he lingered in great pain in his hotel room, tended to by his wife,
Edith, herself ill with the disease. Sykes finally succumbed on the
evening of February 16, one month short of his fortieth birthday.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN ALSO did not live to see his plans come into being.
He too was at Paris, and much as with the Zionist Commission in 1918,
had been led to believe that he would assume a leadership role in the
Zionist delegation to the peace conference, only to find himself
relegated to the sidelines at the last minute. As he thundered in his
diary on January 16, 1919, after learning that the senior Zionist
leadership was about to meet in London for a strategy session, “Chaim
[Weizmann] said to me incidentally, ‘you are coming to London also,
aren’t you?’ ‘For what?’ I replied. ‘To receive further insults? Many
thanks.’ I wrote that I was sick and tired of remaining in the false
position of a mistress who is loved in the privacy of one’s room, but
not recognized before the world.”</p>
<p>Just as he had threatened to do many times with the Zionist
Commission, Aaronsohn resolved to quit Paris altogether, and was only
stayed when the Zionist leadership that had so recently snubbed him
contritely beseeched his help in drawing the proposed boundary map for
Palestine. “I hate the way they work,” Aaronsohn jotted afterward in his
diary with a note of put-upon triumph. “Give important missions to
people and at the last minute realize nothing was done because they
didn’t let experts do it.” The map Aaronsohn drew up was a Zionist’s
dream, one that, if adopted, would have extended the borders of
Palestine to the outskirts of Damascus, not so much making Palestine an
enclave alongside a greater Syria than transforming Syria into a virtual
rump state of a greater Palestine.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 15, 1919, Aaronsohn was preparing to return to
Paris and the peace conference after a quick visit to London. At Kenley
airfield south of London, however, he discovered his flight had been
delayed due to thick ground fog. By 11:30, he was just about to give up
and return to London when, amid a partial clearing of the skies, the
pilot of a much smaller plane, a two-seater de Havilland making a mail
run to Paris, offered to give him a lift. At about 1 p.m., a French
fishing boat captain working the waters off the Calais coast heard a
plane flying low overhead, invisible in the thick fog, then the sound of
a crash. Searching through the mist, the fisherman found scattered mail
floating on the calm sea, but nothing else. Neither the body of the de
Havilland pilot nor of Aaron Aaronsohn was ever recovered. Since by
rabbinical law a funeral can’t be held without a body, on the evening of
May 17 Aaronsohn’s friends and colleagues gathered in Paris for an
“observance” of his life and contribution to the Zionist cause.</p>
<p>As for Aaronsohn’s colleague and sometime adversary in the Zionist
cause, Chaim Weizmann, he would not only live to see the creation of the
state of Israel, but serve as its first president until his death in
1952. He was joined in postwar Palestine by his rebellious younger
sister Minna. For her services to the Central Powers war effort, Minna
was included in a prisoner exchange between Germany and Russia in the
last days of World War I. Managing yet another escape, this time from
the chaos of postwar Germany, she returned to Jerusalem, where she
worked for the health service of the Zionist women’s organization,
Hadassah.</p>
<p>Djemal Pasha continued his adventurous life in the postwar era, if
only briefly. Having escaped from Constantinople along with his two
co-pashas, Talaat and Enver, aboard a German torpedo boat in the last
days of the war, Djemal wandered the battlegrounds of Central Asia,
falling in and out of alliances with a bewildering array of factions.
His luck finally ran out in July 1922 when he and an aide were gunned
down in the streets of Tbilisi, Georgia. Claiming credit for the
assassination was a shadowy Armenian nationalist organization that had
vowed to liquidate those responsible for the Armenian slaughters of
1915–16, and which had earlier assassinated Talaat Pasha in Berlin. The
following month, Enver, the last of the Three Pashas and Djemal’s
coadventurer in the Caucasus, also passed from the scene, shot in a
Russian Red Army ambush in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>IN HIS ROLE as one of America’s Middle Eastern experts at the Paris
Peace Conference, William Yale did not limit his attention to the matter
of peace in the region. At the same time, and perhaps mindful that one
day he would have to find a new job, he sought to quietly promote the
interests of his former employer, Standard Oil of New York, with the
American delegation. Between President Wilson’s stout defense of the
“Open Door” free trade policy and a series of events that had occurred
in Palestine in the summer of 1918, Yale had a good pretext for doing
so.</p>
<p>While serving as the American military liaison at Allenby’s
headquarters that summer, Yale had been summoned by General Arthur
Money, the British chief administrator of Palestine, who demanded that
he hand over Socony’s Palestine oilfield maps. When Yale refused,
protesting that Money should take up the issue with Standard
headquarters, the general opted for the simpler course of breaking into
the old Socony office in Jerusalem and taking them. In a series of
memoranda to the American peace delegates, Yale darkly warned of where
these strong-arm tactics might lead, especially if the oil-hungry
British were allowed free rein in their mandate territories of Palestine
and Iraq. Those delegates were duly alarmed; largely at Yale’s
instigation, the American campaign to force the British to honor
Socony’s Palestine concessions would become a major source of friction
between the two countries for the next several years.</p>
<p>Except that Socony was apparently playing something of a shell game
in Palestine, fiercely fighting to protect its “strike” at Kornub in
order to establish a precedent for demanding equal access to the known
oilfields in British-controlled Iraq. When that access was finally ceded
in 1924, Standard Oil abruptly dropped all its concessions in Palestine.
Scurrying into the breach, a British oil company hastily conducted its
own tests at Kornub, only to find what Yale’s geologist partner, Rudolf
McGovern, had found in 1914: iron tailings. Despite the periodic release
of optimistic industry reports to the contrary, no commercially viable
oil deposits have ever been found at Kornub.</p>
<p>After quitting the Paris Peace Conference in disgust in late 1919,
Yale returned to the United States with hopes of being rehired by
Socony. Whether due to his past impolitic remarks in the halls of 26
Broadway or because he had become too high profile in the ongoing oil
battles with Britain, that effort failed. With his family’s fortune long
since dwindled away and jobs scarce in the deepening American postwar
recession, Yale signed on with an American trading firm and went back to
Cairo. On the way, he stopped off in England and married Edith Hanna, a
British nurse he had met in Jerusalem before the war.</p>
<p>For several years, Yale juggled a number of different part-time
positions in Cairo, even as he continued to prospect for oil on his own.
By May 1922, he felt he’d made a strike on the British-controlled
Farasan Island off the coast of Yemen. As he told a senior Socony
official, the British were keeping the oil find a secret, but if a
Socony geologist was sent out, Yale knew a way for them to sneak onto
the island. When that offer wasn’t pursued, Yale returned to the United
States, where he took up the unlikely vocation of chicken farmer in
rural New Hampshire as he worked toward getting his master’s degree in
education. By 1928, he had been hired by the University of New Hampshire
as an assistant professor of history.</p>
<p>A prodigious if not particularly gifted writer, Yale supplemented his
professor’s income with articles and essays about the Middle East. These
efforts gradually achieved wider recognition—he published in both the
Atlantic Monthly and the Christian Science Monitor—which led to visiting
lectureships and invitations to university symposia. Just as when he had
lived in the region, Yale’s views on the Middle East oscillated wildly
over the years, so that his 1923 call for a campaign to “smash the
debasing tyranny of Islamism, which for centuries has corrupted the
minds and souls and bodies of countless millions of Orientals,” was
neatly offset by a later screed against “the exploitive nature of Jewish
nationalistic imperialism,” which he charged was modeled on the “German
fascist pattern.”</p>
<p>Despite such rhetoric, Yale was sufficiently well regarded as an
expert in the field to be appointed to the State Department’s Office of
Postwar Planning as a Middle Eastern specialist during World War II.
That position, in turn, led to his appointment as an assistant secretary
to the Committee on Trusteeship at the first postwar United Nations
conference in San Francisco in 1945. Yale’s particular area of focus was
on the proposed political realignment of the Arab world through a
dismantling of the discredited colonial mandate system in favor of U.N.
trusteeship. It must have felt very much like déjà vu, for, just as with
the King-Crane Commission of twenty-six years earlier, none of the
committee’s recommendations for the Middle East would be acted upon.</p>
<p>Returned to civilian life, Yale resumed teaching history at the
University of New Hampshire, and then at Boston University until his
retirement in 1967. He died in a nursing home in Derry, New Hampshire,
in February 1975, at the age of eighty-seven.</p>
<p>FROM THE OTHER side of the Middle Eastern intelligence battlefield,
Curt Prüfer had a rather more colorful postwar career. Indeed, while no
individual can truly personify the history of a nation, it would be hard
to find a more remarkable exemplar through which to view events in
Germany between the two world wars.</p>
<p>In 1919, Prüfer was quickly drawn to one of the most poisonous myths
to take root in defeated Germany, the so-called stab-in-the-back
conspiracy. According to this myth, Germany hadn’t lost the war on the
battlefield, but rather had been betrayed from within. Chief among these
internal traitors were Germany’s liberal political parties—in a case of
astoundingly poor timing, a coalition of leftist parties took control of
the government just two days before the armistice—and international
Jewry, seduced by the promises of the Balfour Declaration into throwing
their allegiance to the Allied cause. It was a myth ultimately put to
devastating use by Adolf Hitler, but it found an adherent in Curt Prüfer
far earlier; according to biographer Donald McKale, even as the
impoverished Prüfer accepted financial support from a Jewish foreign
ministry coworker in the lean early postwar years, he railed against the
Jews in his diary with growing vehemence.</p>
<p>In fact, though, due to the unfinished business of the Paris Peace
Conference, a strong argument could be made that Germany hadn’t truly
been defeated at all; instead, the Allies had created perhaps the best
possible breeding ground for future conflict by simultaneously burdening
their former enemy with crushing war reparation debts and leaving her
ruling apparatus largely intact. It enabled German officials, Curt
Prüfer among them, to quickly begin rebuilding the alliances and
networks of influence that had helped lead to war to begin with. One of
Prüfer’s first tasks for the foreign ministry in the postwar era was to
help a number of Germany’s former partners in the Middle East—Egyptian
nationalists, leaders of the Young Turk movement, pro-German Arabs—to
escape retribution and resettle within the former Central Powers. Of
course, this meant Germany now had a recruitment pool of malcontents for
fomenting unrest in the future.</p>
<p>Even before the war was over, Prüfer had seen a new way forward for
that campaign, if only Germany learned from its past mistakes. “Our
propaganda suffered,” he wrote the foreign ministry on November 2, 1918,
“because during the war we wanted to make up in urgency what we had
neglected in peace.… With weepy accusations against our enemies, with
longwinded recitals on our success, and inwardly untrue protestations of
friendship for Islam, we tried to win sympathy from people who stood far
from us spiritually.” The next time around, Prüfer urged, Germany “must
seek less to educate, than to please.”</p>
<p>Amid the musical-chairs politics of the postwar Middle East, Prüfer
soon had opportunity to get back into the mischief-making game. In the
autumn of 1921, he was linked to a new scheme by the ever-determined
Abbas Hilmi to overthrow the British regime in Egypt. A few months
later, Prüfer was in Rome visiting with Chaim Weizmann. If aware that
his visitor had once seduced his younger sister into spying for Germany,
Weizmann apparently had bigger things on his mind; as he opined to
Prüfer, since the French were clearly to blame for the British backing
away from the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Zionists and
Germans now needed to work together against France. It was an idea with
which the virulently anti-Semitic but ever opportunistic Prüfer
undoubtedly heartily concurred. For these and other activities, the
British government finally put Prüfer on an enemies blacklist, with the
MI5 security agency maintaining an investigative file on him that would
never be closed.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, though, a certain equilibrium had settled into
Prüfer’s life. Having divorced his long-estranged first wife, the
American Frances Pinkham, he married a much younger German woman who in
1930 bore him a son. He also continued to rise through the foreign
ministry ranks, eventually becoming deputy director of its vitally
important Abteilung (Department) III, the division dealing with both
Anglo-American and Middle Eastern affairs. He was still in that position
when Adolf Hitler came to power in July 1933.</p>
<p>Even though he shared Hitler’s dream of a resurgent Germany, Prüfer,
like many German conservatives, initially viewed the upstart Nazis as
useful fools, rough-around-the-edges hooligans who could be utilized but
controlled by the more respectable establishment. By 1936, Prüfer had
sufficiently recovered from that misapprehension and his initial
distaste to become personnel director of Hitler’s foreign ministry and,
a year later, to officially join the Nazi Party. In September 1939, with
Germany having just ignited World War II with its invasion of Poland,
Prüfer left for South America to serve as Hitler’s ambassador to
Brazil.</p>
<p>His three years in Brazil marked a kind of personal high point. At
last Prüfer had achieved the status within the German diplomatic
community that he had sought as far back as 1911. What’s more, by
developing a close friendship with Brazil’s dictator, he helped
forestall that immensely rich country from joining the war on the side
of the Allies despite a treaty commitment with the Americans to do so.
But alas, old habits die hard. In the summer of 1942, Prüfer was
directly linked to a German espionage ring operating in Brazil and
ordered from the country. If disappointed by this turn of events, the
ambassador could at least be pleased by the timing; just five days after
he and his family sailed for home, Brazil joined the Allies in the war
and a warrant was issued for his arrest (he was eventually sentenced in
absentia to twenty-five years for espionage).</p>
<p>Curiously trusting for a propaganda expert, Prüfer had apparently
accepted Nazi pronouncements about imminent victory at face value, so he
was shocked to return to a Europe where the war was turning inexorably
against Germany. For a year, he stuck it out in Berlin, even as he moved
his wife and child to a home he had bought in a smaller city to escape
the incessant Allied air raids. “All this is terrible for me to
witness,” he wrote in July 1943, “not only because I have always been a
person who is very attached to his homeland and always will be, but also
because I was sincerely converted to some of the beautiful ideas of
National Socialism.”</p>
<p>Beautiful ideas aside, this natural-born survivor also had the
instinct to find a way out. In September 1943, Prüfer led his family
across the border into neutral Switzerland, where, much as in 1918, he
remained until Germany’s fall. The difference between his return in 1918
and that of 1945 was that this time the Allies weren’t going to allow
German militarists another reprise. The home Prüfer had purchased in
Baden Baden, it turned out, had been confiscated from a Jewish family,
and was taken away from him. The former ambassador was also put through
the American “de-nazification” investigation process, where he was
cleared of war crimes even as many of his immediate superiors in the
foreign ministry were sent to Nuremberg. The British might have had more
desire to catch up to the man who had been their nemesis for three
decades, but they too lost interest when in October 1945 it was reported
the always frail Prüfer was either dead or dying of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>But maybe not quite. Three years later, a sharp-eyed British
intelligence officer in New Delhi noted a curious little item in the
Daily Telegraph of India relating to the future training of Indian
diplomats at Delhi University. “Students will be under the supervision
of Dr. Pruffer,” the article noted, “a former German diplomat who left
his country on the advent of the Nazi regime.”</p>
<p>From a bit of sleuthing, it was eventually determined that the
anti-Nazi “Pruffer” and the pro-Nazi Prüfer were one and the same. Much
as had occurred in Cairo nearly forty years earlier, the British moved
to deny Prüfer his coveted academic position, and he eventually returned
to Germany. He finally died there—for real this time—in early 1959, at
the age of seventy-seven. In a fitting irony, his only child, Olaf, with
whom the failed former Oriental scholar had long been estranged, would
eventually immigrate to the United States and become a renowned
archaeologist.</p>
<p>OF ALL THE spies and intelligence agents who dueled with each another
in the Middle East during World War I, the one most determined to
divorce himself from the region in its aftermath was T. E. Lawrence. As
he wrote a friend during his 1921 service for Winston Churchill at the
Colonial Office, “the Arabs are like a page I have turned over, and
sequels are rotten things.”</p>
<p>In early 1922, with that service ending, Lawrence petitioned the head
of the Royal Air Force for permission to join the force. There were
several curious details to this request. Due both to his celebrity and
former military rank, Lawrence might easily have entered the RAF as a
senior officer, but instead he specifically requested to come in “with
the ranks,” meaning as an ordinary private. Also, he was no longer T. E.
Lawrence; as he informed the RAF chief, his new name was John Hume
Ross.</p>
<p>Making his petition especially puzzling was that Lawrence had always
been openly contemptuous of military culture. As he would write in Seven
Pillars, the military uniform “walled its bearers from ordinary life,
was sign that they had sold their wills and bodies to the State, and
contracted themselves into a service not the less abject for that its
beginning was voluntary.… The soldier assigned his owner the twenty-four
hours’ use of his body, and sole conduct of his mind and passions.”</p>
<p>But perhaps it was not so puzzling after all. In Arabia, Lawrence had
exerted life-and-death control over thousands, had cobbled together a
cause and an army as he went along. All the while, he had been tormented
by a sense of his own fraudulence, the awareness that the men who fought
and died at his side were almost certain to be betrayed in the end. As
he would suggest in Seven Pillars, and state quite explicitly in letters
to friends, after Arabia he never wanted to be in a position of
responsibility again.</p>
<p>Joined to this was a desire for anonymity, to leave behind who and
what he had been. Lawrence displayed this desire most overtly in the
decision to change his name—first to John Hume Ross and then to Thomas
Edward Shaw—but it took more subtle form, a kind of psychological
washing of the hands. In the one very short mention of the Cairo
Conference in Seven Pillars, Lawrence wrote that Churchill “made
straight all the tangle” in the Middle East, fulfilling Britain’s
promises to the Arabs “in letter and spirit (where humanly possible)
without sacrificing any interest of our Empire or any interest of the
peoples concerned.” Knowing the full extent of those promises, and
writing at a time when his cherished Syria remained under French
control, Lawrence couldn’t possibly have believed his own assertion.
Similarly, considering all that is contained in its pages, it’s very
hard to regard the subtitle to Seven Pillars—“A Triumph”—as anything but
self-mockery.</p>
<p>Yet putting paid to all that had occurred so as to no longer have to
think about it may well have been a matter of personal survival. What’s
sadly evident in many of Lawrence’s postwar letters to friends, as well
as in comments he made to his contemporary biographers, is that he
suffered from many of the symptoms of what was known at the time as
“shell shock,” and what is today referred to as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). Over the remainder of his life, Lawrence suffered from
recurrent nightmares, endured severe bouts of depression—several of
which included the contemplation of suicide—and gradually cut himself
off from many of his former friends amid an intense desire to be
alone.</p>
<p>He may have been particularly primed for this continuing torment by
his own actions on the battlefield. As a boy, he had been obsessed with
the tales of King Arthur’s court and the chivalric code, had dreamed of
leading a heroic life. In the reality of war, however, Lawrence had seen
men blown to bits, often by his own handiwork, had left wounded behind
to die, and had ordered prisoners to be killed. Just as any thoughtful
person before or after him, what Lawrence had discovered on the
battlefield was that while moments of heroism might certainly occur, the
cumulative experience of war, its day-in, day-out brutalization, was
utterly antithetical to the notion of leading a heroic life.</p>
<p>Also indicative of Lawrence’s craving for anonymity were the
circumstances of the publication of Seven Pillars of Wisdom. In 1922, he
had handprinted just eight copies of his wartime memoir for close
friends, but as word of the book spread, Lawrence was urged to release
it publicly. His compromise was to produce a slightly abridged
two-hundred-copy run of Seven Pillars in 1926, along with a vastly
shorter mass-market version, Revolt in the Desert. The books might have
made Lawrence wealthy, but he donated all royalties from the hugely
successful Revolt in the Desert to an RAF charity, and refused to
publish another edition of Seven Pillars during his lifetime.</p>
<p>While publicly denigrating his work as a trifle, Lawrence confided to
a friend the secret hope that his memoir might join the canon of the
very best of English literature. In this, he was to be disappointed. In
truth, Seven Pillars is a fabulously uneven book, its occasional soaring
lyricism and startling psychological insights all too often subsumed by
long disquisitions on topography and a riot of local place names and
fleeting characters likely to leave the reader struggling. Despite the
glowing and insistent plaudits of many—certainly Lawrence deserves great
credit for being one of the first modern writers to present an
unflinching look at the grotesqueness of war—Seven Pillars remains one
of those books that, as even an admiring critic acknowledges, “is more
often praised than read.”</p>
<p>After his first attempt at disappearing into the RAF as “Airman Ross”
failed—he was quickly unmasked by the British press—Lawrence joined the
Royal Tank Corps under the name of T. E. Shaw, then quietly transferred
back into the RAF in 1925. For the next decade, he occupied a succession
of lowly positions within the air corps—for nearly a year he served as a
simple base clerk at a remote RAF base in India—while also engaging his
mechanical bent with work on a new generation of high-speed military
rescue boats. In 1929, he bought a tiny cottage in rural Dorset, Clouds
Hill, just a mile from the Bovington Camp where he had served in the
Tank Corps, and this became his refuge from a still-clamoring public and
press. While he continued to write—in 1928, Lawrence penned an account
of his postwar military service, The Mint, followed by a translation of
Homer’s Odyssey—the bulk of his time was devoted to his decidedly
prosaic military duties, with off hours spent riding his beloved Brough
motorcycle through the English countryside or voraciously reading at
Clouds Hill. Despite the assertion of some biographers that this period
in Lawrence’s life was also highly productive and interesting, it is
hard to escape the image of a sad and reclusive man, his circle of
friends and acquaintances steadily dwindling to a mere handful, and many
of these only maintained by the occasional quick note from Lawrence
explaining why he couldn’t see them. “Please apologize humbly for me to
Mrs. S.F. [Newcombe],” he wrote Stewart Newcombe in February 1929, after
apparently failing to show for a scheduled visit. “Something has gone
wrong with the works, and I can’t wind myself up to meet people.”</p>
<p>One who insisted on a face-to-face meeting was Faisal Hussein. During
a state visit to England in 1925, the now king of Iraq and Lawrence
attended a luncheon at a politician’s estate. It proved a rather awkward
gathering, with the two old comrades in arms seeming to have little to
say to each other, and Lawrence discomfited by their host’s constant
invocation of “the good old days.” “I’ve changed,” Lawrence wrote his
confidante, Charlotte Shaw, afterward, “and the Lawrence who used to go
about and be friendly and familiar with that sort of people is dead.
He’s worse than dead. He is a stranger I once knew.”</p>
<p>During another state visit, in 1933, King Faisal had to lean on his
contacts in the British military to all but order “Private Shaw” to a
meeting.</p>
<p>By early 1935, Lawrence resolved to leave the RAF, even as he dreaded
the long and unstructured days that lay ahead of him. His apprehensions
proved quite accurate. As he wrote to a friend on May 6 from Clouds
Hill, just two months into his retirement, “at present the feeling is
mere bewilderment. I imagine leaves must feel like this after they have
fallen from their tree and until they die. Let’s hope that will not be
my continuing state.”</p>
<p>It would not be. Precisely a week later, on the morning of May 13,
Lawrence rode his motorcycle to Bovington Camp to send a telegram. On
his return, just a few hundred yards from Clouds Hill, he swerved to
avoid two bicycling boys on the narrow road. Clipping the back tire of
one of the bicycles, he lost control of the motorcycle and crashed,
striking his head on the asphalt. Suffering from massive brain injuries,
Lawrence lingered in a coma at the Bovington Camp hospital for six days,
before finally dying early on the morning of May 19, 1935. He was
forty-six.</p>
<p>Among the pallbearers at his funeral were his old friends Ronald
Storrs and Stewart Newcombe, while those in attendance included Winston
Churchill and the poet Siegfried Sassoon. For the occasion, King George
V sent a message to Lawrence’s surviving younger brother, Arnold. “Your
brother’s name will live in history, and the King gratefully recognizes
his distinguished services to his country.”</p>
<p>Churchill’s eulogy was rather more loquacious: “I deem him one of the
greatest beings alive in our time. I do not see his like elsewhere. I
fear whatever our need we shall never see his like again.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to read in Churchill’s last sentence an allusion to the new
danger that by 1935 was already building over Europe: the rise of Nazi
Germany. If Churchill imagined, however, that a living Lawrence might
have played a signal role in meeting that danger, he was surely
mistaken. As Lawrence himself had been trying to tell the world for many
years, the blue-eyed “warrior of the desert” had passed from the scene
long before, lost to the first great cataclysm of the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>The broad scope of this book required research in some twenty
different governmental archives or private collections on three
continents. It would have been an utterly impossible task without the
very able group of historians and researchers who assisted me in various
aspects. These include Tara Fitzgerald, Claire Flack, Lars Luedicke,
Frederic Maxwell, Andrea Minarcek, Kevin Morrow, Eamonn O’Neill, and
Anna Van Lenten. Of these I must especially thank Kevin Morrow, who not
only undertook research trips to California and Israel on my behalf, but
also oversaw the collection, organization, and translation of both
French and German archive material; I’m sure I would still be quite at
sea with this project without his help.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the curators and administrators of the
various archives and private collections that I sought assistance from
over the course of this project, all of whom were unfailingly helpful
and generous with both their time and advice. While these are just a
fraction of all those who helped me, I’d particularly like to thank
Debbie Usher at the Middle East Centre, St. Antony’s College, Oxford;
Liz Gray, David Pfeiffer, and Eric Van Slander at the National Archives
and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.; Marion Freudenthal and
Ilonit Levy at the NILI Museum, Zichron Yaakov; Alex Rankin at Boston
University; Carol Leadenham at the Hoover Institution, Stanford
University; and Lynsey Robertson at the Churchill Archives Centre,
Cambridge University. I must also single out Howard Diamond and the
staff of the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, who made it something of a personal crusade
to pinpoint when a sandstorm was likely to have struck Beersheva in
early January 1914.</p>
<p>While it was my intention in this book to consult original source
material as much as possible, there are two authors to whom I feel
especially indebted. My research on Curt Prüfer would have taken
infinitely longer—and, in fact, would have still been incomplete—without
the pioneering work of Professor Donald McKale at Clemson University,
and his two seminal books, Curt Prüfer and War by Revolution. I also
want to thank Professor McKale for taking the time to read an early
version of the book, and for his very helpful comments. Second, the
author of any book in which T. E. Lawrence is a significant presence
must acknowledge the trailblazing achievements of Jeremy Wilson in his
authorized biography, Lawrence of Arabia. While I respectfully disagree
with Mr. Wilson on several aspects of Lawrence’s actions in Arabia, I am
deeply indebted to the astounding amount of scholarly research he has
done on Lawrence, which has greatly aided all of us who have followed in
his wake.</p>
<p>I also benefited from a small group of advance readers on this
project, some of whom read for historical accuracy and others for more
stylistic concerns. In the first category, in addition to Donald McKale,
I want to sincerely thank Roberto Mazza at Northern Illinois University
and Thomas Goltz at Montana State University, both of whom were
extremely generous with their time and deeply insightful with their
suggestions. In the latter category, I wish to thank my friends Michael
Fields, Wilson Van Law, and Seth McDowell for valiantly struggling
through a problematic early draft of the book, and most especially
Frances Shaw, who, without complaint, suffered through several more.
Also in this category I must include my wonderful agent and dear friend,
Sloan Harris, at International Creative Management Partners, a man who
always knows how to ride that delicate line of simultaneously providing
encouragement and cracking the whip.</p>
<p>Finally, while I can’t recall this being the case for any other book
I’ve written, I still remember the precise moment when the genesis of
this one occurred: during a dinner conversation with my very good friend
and editor, Bill Thomas, in the winter of 2008. I think we both
instantly knew this was the book I needed to write—in fact, had been
working toward writing for most of my journalistic career—and even if I
have occasionally cursed Bill’s name since then whilst in the midst of
writing or research difficulties, I’m eternally grateful for the
enthusiasm, patience, and diligence he’s shown these past years in
bringing the idea to fruition. I would also like to thank all the staff
of Doubleday for tolerating my semi-permanent presence in their offices
for several months while finishing the book’s fact-checking and
copyediting, especially Melissa Danaczko and Coralie Hunter for their
unstinting helpfulness in dealing with both my researching
idiosyncrasies and computer illiteracy.</p>
<p>And last, I want to thank all the friends and family members who have
been so tolerant of my canceled meetings, unreturned phone calls, and
general absence of the past five years. With the book now done, I
propose to be a much more attentive friend and relative going
forward.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>While I have drawn from a very wide variety of archival and secondary
materials in this book, a few sources specifically related to the book’s
principal subjects proved especially valuable. As far as archival
material is concerned, these are the diaries of Aaron Aaronsohn (NILI
Museum and Archives, Israel); the diaries of Curt Prüfer (Hoover
Institution, Stanford University); the unpublished memoir of William
Yale (Boston University); and the World War I–era records of the British
Foreign and War Offices (National Archives, Kew, England). Since some of
those records were declassified within the past decade, for certain
aspects of the book I had the opportunity to draw on material not
previously available.</p>
<p>In addition, I am indebted to Donald McKale for his biography Curt
Prüfer: German Diplomat from the Kaiser to Hitler, which is one of the
few sources of material for Curt Prüfer’s early life. With regard to T.
E. Lawrence, John Mack’s A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E.
Lawrence is the most incisive psychological portrait ever drawn of the
man. Most of all, I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Jeremy Wilson
and his authorized biography, Lawrence of Arabia; due to Wilson’s
exhaustive research, his work remains the starting point for all serious
Lawrence scholarship.</p>
<p>I also relied on a number of other primary and secondary materials
for historical background on specific aspects in the book—for example,
prewar Germany—and I have noted in corresponding endnotes those sources
that I found particularly useful.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1 On the morning: Lawrence’s official rank at this time was actually
lieutenant colonel, but several weeks earlier he had been temporarily
given full colonel status so as to facilitate his speedy return to Great
Britain. As a result, from October 1918 onward, he was frequently
referred to in official correspondence as “Colonel Lawrence.”</p>

<p>3 Now that the khamsin had passed: Yale wrote several different, and
slightly conflicting, accounts of his first meeting with T. E. Lawrence,
including in his memoir, It Takes So Long. The most detailed, and the
source for most information here, is his article “T. E. Lawrence:
Scholar, Soldier, Statesman, Diplomat” (undated, but presumably written
shortly after Lawrence’s 1935 death); BU Box 6, Folder 1.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-2-a-very-unusual-type-1">Chapter 2: A Very Unusual
Type</h4>
<p>1 A Very Unusual Type: Many of the details on T. E. Lawrence’s
childhood and early years are drawn from the two most definitive books
on the topic, John Mack’s A Prince of Our Disorder, and Jeremy Wilson’s
Lawrence of Arabia; William Yale provided information about his
childhood and youth in the “Prelude” to It Takes So Long, his
unpublished memoir. For this period in Curt Prüfer’s life, Donald
McKale’s Curt Prüfer is almost quite literally the only source
available, his material drawn from interviews he conducted with Prüfer’s
son, Olaf, since deceased.</p>

Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia, p. 85.</p>

<p>4 “We had a very happy childhood”: Robert Lawrence quoted in A. W.
Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence by His Friends (1954 edition), p. 31.</p>
<p>5 There, the couple assumed: The genesis of the Lawrence family name
was actually a good deal more complicated, for as T. E. Lawrence learned
from his mother in 1919, she too had been born illegitimate. The name
appearing on her birth certificate was Sarah Junner, and she had only
adopted the Lawrence surname, that of her presumed father, as a
teenager. This casualness with surnames might also help explain the
apparent ease with which T. E. later assumed aliases of his own, trading
in Thomas Edward Lawrence for John Hume Ross, and then Ross for Thomas
Edward Shaw.</p>
<p>6 “You can imagine”: Thomas (Chapman) Lawrence (undated); Bodleian MS
Eng C 6740.</p>
<p>7 He kept the information: Lawrence to Charlotte Shaw, April 14,
1927, cited by Mack, A Prince of Our Disorder, p. 26.</p>

<p>25 This passion also: For the history of the Ottoman Empire and the
rise of the Committee of Union and Progress, I have primarily consulted
Aksakal, The Ottoman Road to War in 1914; Kent, The Great Powers and the
End of the Ottoman Empire; and Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and
Modern Turkey, vols. 1 and 2.</p>

specify on which Monday in June he was writing, it can be deduced that
it was June 29 by a June 1 letter he wrote to his family from
Carchemish. Discussing his upcoming journey home, Lawrence wrote that
“you may look for me about the 25th. or so.”</p>

Turkish-German alliance was zealously maintained by both sides. On July
29, 1914, while the secret pact with Enver was still being negotiated,
General Liman von Sanders, the commander of the German military mission
to Turkey, petitioned for permission to return to Germany in the event
of war. Shown Sander’s telegram, Kaiser Wilhelm noted in the margin,

<p>36 For many of the Jewish émigrés: A number of historians have
asserted that Djemal Pasha ordered the 1914–15 expulsion of Jews from
Palestine as part of a general campaign to destroy the Jewish community,
and none have made this assertion more forcefully than David Fromkin. On
pp. 210–11 of A Peace to End All Peace, Fromkin contends that Djemal
“took violent action against the Jewish settlers. Influenced by a
bitterly anti-Zionist Ottoman official named Beha-ed-din, Djemal moved
to destroy the Zionist settlements and ordered the expulsion of all
foreign Jews—which is to say, most of Jewish Palestine.” In fact,
Djemal’s December 1914 expulsion edict applied only to the citizens of
belligerent nations, the same policy adopted by other warring nations at
the outbreak of World War I, and was then soon amended to exempt British
and French Jews. Furthermore, those “belligerent” Jews in Palestine
slated for expulsion, chiefly Russian Jews, were given the choice of
staying if they assumed Ottoman citizenship, an option unique to the
Ottoman Empire. As a result of this comparatively lenient treatment and
the many loopholes it provided, only a fraction of the estimated 85,000
Jews residing in prewar Palestine left or were forced from the
territory, and certainly not the “most of Jewish Palestine” of Fromkin’s
estimation.</p>

<p>32 His name was Mohammed al-Faroki: Due to the pivotal role he played
in shaping British policy in the Near East in 1915–16, Mohammed
al-Faroki remains one of the more enigmatic figures to emerge from the
period. Since he is believed to have been killed in 1922 during a tribal
war in Iraq, many of the questions surrounding him are likely to stay
unanswered.</p>
<p>New attention was focused on Faroki by David Fromkin in his 1989 book
A Peace to End All Peace, in which Fromkin repeatedly refers to the
“hoax” that Faroki perpetrated, and the extraordinary effect his actions
had on world events. To wit, “not only the McMahon letters, but also—and
more importantly—the negotiations with France, Russia, and later Italy
that ultimately resulted in the Sykes-Picot-Sazanov Agreement and
subsequent Allied secret treaty understandings were among the results of
Lieutenant al-Faruqi’s [sic] hoax.”</p>
<p>If this gives Faroki more credit than is probably his due, Fromkin
also never specifies just what his alleged hoax consisted of. Instead,
his charge appears to center on two broad points: that Faroki
exaggerated his position in al-Ahd to both the British and Emir Hussein
in order to maneuver himself into an intermediary role; and that he lied
about the strength and ability of al-Ahd and al-Fatat to stage a
large-scale revolt in Syria. In essence, Fromkin alleges, Faroki sold
the British on a false bill of goods that he couldn’t possibly
deliver.</p>
<p>But when taking as a starting point that Faroki was an ardent Arab
nationalist who was deeply suspicious of the Western colonial powers,
it’s hard to see how either of these accusations rise to the level of a
“hoax.” While Faroki almost certainly exaggerated the strength and
capability of the Syrian would-be rebels in order to exact greater
concessions from the British, in a time of war did this make him a fraud
or a good negotiator?</p>
<p>This is much more than a question of labels or semantics, however. In
Fromkin’s view, because of Faroki’s hoax, the agreement Hussein reached
with the British via the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence was purchased
with counterfeit coin (p. 186). To wit (p. 219), “The [British] Arab
Bureau believed that the [Arab] uprising would draw support throughout
the Moslem and Arabic-speaking worlds. Most important of all, it
believed that the revolt would draw support from what the British
believed to be a largely Arabic-speaking Ottoman army … In the event,
the Arab revolt for which Hussein hoped never took place. No Arabic
units of the Ottoman army came over to Hussein. No political or military
figures of the Ottoman Empire defected to him and the Allies. The
powerful secret military organization that al-Faruqi [sic] had promised
would rally to Hussein failed to make itself known.”</p>
<p>The problem with Fromkin’s thesis is that, by the time of the Arab
revolt in June 1916, neither the British nor Hussein believed anything
of the sort. As Hussein informed McMahon four months prior, the Syrian
wing of the prospective revolt had been severely weakened due to “the
tyrannies of the [Turkish] government there,” which had left “only a
few” of the “persons upon whom they [the conspirators] could depend.”
Not only does Fromkin make no mention of this famous warning from
Hussein, he also fails to note that the British had fully taken this
news into account. As Gilbert Clayton, the head of military intelligence
in Egypt, wrote in an April 22, 1916, memorandum (PRO-FO 882/4,
f. 92–3), “the Sherif [Hussein] allows that Syria is useless for
revolutionary purposes.” In light of this development, Clayton noted in
the same memorandum, “High Commissioner [McMahon] feels very strongly
that at present the Sherif should be advised to confine himself to
securing the Railway, and clearing the Turks out of the Hedjaz.”</p>
<p>In short, far from being blindsided by the limited scope of the Arab
revolt, British authorities had known well ahead of time exactly what
they were—and were not—getting by supporting it; in fact, it was they
who had urged its limited scope.</p>

<p>3 A few smaller points: The precise nature of the agreement reached
between Emir Hussein and the British government in the so-called
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence remains one of the most contentious
points of Middle Eastern history. Through countless books on the
subject, historians of all stripes have managed to squeeze from these
brief letters an interpretation neatly suited to their thesis or
political bias.</p>
<p>For many, a chief starting point has been to emphasize the often
awkward grammatical structure of the letters—an archaic floridness on
the part of Emir Hussein, a carefully calculated obtuseness on the part
of Henry McMahon—to suggest that radically divergent interpretations can
be drawn, and that no deliberate deception was committed by the British.
Indeed, by focusing on McMahon’s carefully inserted modifiers, a number
of historians, most notably Isaiah Friedman, Elie Kedourie, and David
Fromkin, have put forward the assertion that the British didn’t actually
promise Hussein anything at all. Without such a promise, so this line of
argument goes, Britain was at perfect liberty to enter into its
subsequent compact on the Middle East with its European allies through
the so-called Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>This argument, however, falters under the weight of both common sense
and contemporary evidence. For any impartial observer supplied with a
map of the region and the few minutes necessary to read the full
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, it becomes manifestly obvious just what
Emir Hussein believed he was agreeing to. What’s more, the actions of
the British government at the time make clear that it too believed
promises had been made to Hussein, and that those promises were undercut
by Sykes-Picot. That is evidenced by their zealous efforts to keep the
Sykes-Picot Agreement a secret from Hussein for nearly two years, a
conspiracy of silence that undoubtedly would have continued if the
agreement’s existence hadn’t been revealed by Russia’s Bolshevik
government.</p>

<p>10 The one precondition: Engle, The Nili Spies, pp. 62–64; Florence,
Lawrence and Aaronsohn, p. 205. Engle, Florence, and other Aaronsohn
biographers have rendered this incident in rather more dire terms,
alleging that Feinberg was tortured in Beersheva and faced imminent
threat of execution in Jerusalem. Aaronsohn’s diary for the period would
seem to contradict this, however, considering that he noted learning of
Feinberg’s detention from a telegram Feinberg himself sent from
Beersheva on December 29. Further, Aaronsohn’s subsequent diary entries
indicate little sense of urgency in resolving Feinberg’s predicament,
nor does the fact that Aaronsohn waited for two weeks after learning of
it to make his appeal to Djemal Pasha.</p>
<p>11 It wasn’t until a reply: Chamberlain to Hardinge, October 22,
1915; PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 254.</p>
<p>12 In other words: The French “escape clause” in McMahon’s October 24
letter to Hussein was carefully constructed at the senior levels of the
British government, as evidenced by correspondence between McMahon and
the Foreign Office in PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 204–8.</p>

<p>15 Rather than be part: Sykes and Picot joint memorandum, “Arab
Question,” January 5, 1916; PRO-FO 371/2767. Of all the controversies
that continue to surround the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, perhaps
the most specious is the assertion that the territory of Palestine was
specifically excluded from the proposed independent Arab nation, and
that Hussein was fully aware of this. The chief proponent of this
assertion has been Isaiah Friedman in his frequently cited books The
Question of Palestine and Palestine: A Twice-Promised Land?, with his
claims echoed by Fromkin in A Peace to End All Peace.</p>
<p>The foundation for this assertion rests with one of the
“modifications” McMahon proposed in his crucial letter of October 24,
1915, to Hussein, in which he wrote that the “portions of Syria lying to
the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be
said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the limits demanded
[for an independent Arab nation].” With that as a starting point,
Friedman goes on to list the many opportunities Hussein had after
October 24 to raise an objection to the exclusion of Palestine, but
consistently failed to do so. As he writes in The Question of Palestine
(p. 90), “On receipt of McMahon’s letter of 24 October, Hussein argued
that Mesopotamia and the vilayets of Beirut and Aleppo ‘are Arab and
should therefore be under Muslim Government,’ though significantly he
refrained from placing Palestine in the same category. Again on 1
January 1916 he reminded the High Commissioner that after the conclusion
of the war he would claim ‘Beirut and its coastal regions’ but made no
mention of the sanjak of Jerusalem.” From such omissions on Hussein’s
part, Friedman concludes, Hussein had clearly tacitly ceded control of
Palestine in his dialogue with McMahon.</p>
<p>Except the first problem with this thesis is that no portion of
Palestine lies “to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and
Aleppo.” Instead, that designation corresponds roughly—roughly because
it’s unclear exactly what McMahon meant by “districts”—to modern-day
Lebanon and the coastal areas of modern-day Syria; Palestine/Israel lies
well to the south. An even larger problem is that, over the course of
his correspondence with Hussein, McMahon carefully specified each region
that he was seeking “modifications” for, and at no time did he ever
mention Palestine. As for why Hussein himself never raised the issue of
Palestine with McMahon, Friedman and other proponents of this thesis
seem determined to avoid the most obvious explanation: since Palestine
fell outside of the exclusion zone McMahon had described, and since
McMahon had never included it in his “modifications,” there was simply
nothing to discuss?</p>

<p>22 army of twelve thousand: There is a considerable disparity in
historical sources over the size of the Kut garrison, with numbers
ranging between nine and twelve thousand. This disparity is explained by
the inclusion or omission of so-called camp followers the estimates—the
number of actual soldiers was closer to the lower estimate—but since the
camp followers would share in their grim fate, it seems appropriate to
include them.</p>

meticulous in tabulating the number of British soldiers at Kut who had
died in captivity—1755 out of 2592, according to Crowley (Kut 1916,
p. 253)—they were far less with their Indian counterparts, or even in
repatriating those who had survived. According to Millar (Death of an
Army, p. 284), Indian survivors of Kut continued to show up in their
native villages, having somehow managed their own passage home, as late
as 1924.</p>

<p>4 “To the most honoured”: Unless otherwise noted, all of Storrs’s

drawn from his untitled report to High Commissioner McMahon, June 10,

<p>5 Lending all this momentous activity: Storrs, Memoirs, p. 176.</p>
<p>6 In that case: While Murray’s resistance to assisting the Arab
Revolt was of long standing, he expressed it most forcefully at a

September 12, 1916 (PRO-FO 882/4, f. 338–47).</p>

<p>8 “it was quickly apparent”: Storrs, Memoirs, p. 203.</p>
<p>9 “I took every opportunity”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 63.</p>
<p>10 In just this way: While it is technically true that Lawrence went
to Jeddah in no official capacity, Gilbert Clayton worked behind the
scenes to have him accompany Storrs so that, jointly, they could return
with “a good appreciation of the situation” in Arabia (Clayton to
Wingate, October 9, 1916; SADD Wingate Papers, W/141/3/35). This, in
turn, was tied to Clayton’s efforts to have Lawrence transferred back to
the Arab Bureau.</p>

<p>17 Yet at some point: In his authorized biography Lawrence of Arabia,
Jeremy Wilson makes an extremely convincing case that Lawrence probably
imparted details of Sykes-Picot to Faisal within the first few days of
his return to Wejh in February 1917. Given Wilson’s meticulous research
in coming to this conclusion, it’s curious why he then concludes that
Lawrence’s motive in doing so was to “deal with the French question once
and for all.”</p>
<p>As evidenced by the Rabegh episode, French military overtures in the
Middle East were wholly dependent on the support—or lack thereof—of
their more powerful ally in the region, Great Britain. Besides, at the
time of Lawrence’s return to Wejh in early February 1917, Faisal’s deep
distrust of Colonel Brémond was already well established. Consequently,
the notion that Lawrence disclosed Sykes-Picot to Faisal out of concern
over French intrigues or influence is puzzling. Instead, the most
logical explanation is that Lawrence meant to thwart the one power that
truly had the capacity to betray the Arabs: Great Britain.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, successive sympathetic Lawrence biographers have
accepted this anti-French motive in explaining Lawrence’s disclosure.
Taking matters a step further, Wilson even asserts that Lawrence made
this disclosure because “in the long run it would surely serve Britain’s
interests best.” Perhaps in Lawrence’s conception of Britain’s
interests, but most certainly not that of the British government at the
time.</p>

<p>38 “graciously permitted”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 216.</p>
<p>39 “The Turk was harmless”: Ibid., p. 225.</p>
<p>40 With the Turks put on: In the absence of evidence pinpointing when
Lawrence came up with the Aqaba-by-land scheme, most biographers have
concluded he did so in early February 1917, and that he shared the idea
with Faisal at that time as a way to dissuade him from the Aqaba-by-sea
plan urged by Brémond and others. On closer examination, this conclusion
seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s idea for taking Aqaba was such a radical departure from
anything previously considered, and if successful would so dramatically
alter the political chessboard in Arabia, that implementing it surely
would have become his overriding goal once he’d conceived of it. If that
had occurred in February, it’s hard to imagine why he would have then
removed himself from Faisal’s camp for the thirty-seven days he spent
going to and from Abdullah’s camp in Wadi Ais.</p>
<p>Similarly, had Faisal known of an inland plan in February, it’s
hardly credible that he would have then thrown aside Lawrence’s counsel
and resumed his support for a British-assisted coastal attack on Aqaba,
as he did in early March, and again in early April. Although Lawrence
may have offered Faisal vague palliatives in February over how Aqaba
might best be taken to secure the Arabs’ move north, it almost certainly
wasn’t until the two men were reunited in Wejh in mid-April that the
inland plan took tangible form.</p>

might alienate the Jewish population in Palestine, Brode had taken his
concerns about the Jaffa evacuation order to Djemal Pasha. At their
meeting, Djemal clarified that those Jaffa Jews involved in agriculture
could stay on, while those being evacuated could proceed to Jerusalem if
they wished, a destination denied “Ottomans.” Brode to Kuhlmann, April

<p>9 The only way Hussein: Despite Sykes’s repeated assertions to the
contrary, there is ample evidence that he didn’t disclose the terms of
the Sykes-Picot Agreement to King Hussein at their May 1917 meetings.
Well into 1918, Cyril Wilson and other British officers in conference
with Hussein consistently reported that the king had no knowledge of the
partitions of the Arab “nation” called for in that agreement, but
instead continued to believe that the far more generous framework
specified in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence remained in effect. To
cite only the example discussed here, it’s exceedingly hard to imagine
that Hussein would have agreed to the Baghdad-Lebanon formulation had he
known beforehand of the proposed dispensation of Baghdad province as
specified in Sykes-Picot. As Tanenbaum (France and the Arab Middle East,
p. 17) points out: “It did not make sense for a leader of a rebellion to
ask an outside power to annex the territory for which he was fighting
and hoped to rule.”</p>

<p>16 “short statement of fact”: Wilson to Symes, June 20, 1917; PRO-FO
882/16, f. 127. Many historians contend that it was King Hussein and
Faisal, not Mark Sykes, who dissembled about the substance of their
meetings in May 1917. In The Question of Palestine, Isaiah Friedman
wholeheartedly accepts Sykes’s version, asserting (p. 206) that at their
preliminary, early May meeting, “Feisal’s misgivings were set at rest by
Sykes’s explanation of the Anglo-French Agreement … The interview with
Hussein on 5 May went off equally well.” Sykes’s only fault, in
Friedman’s view, was a failure to make a personal record of his and
Picot’s subsequent talks with Hussein. “For this omission,” he writes,
“Sykes had to pay the penalty when a year later, to his surprise,
Hussein feigned ignorance of the Anglo-French Agreement and pretended to
have learned of it first from Djemal Pasha’s Damascus speech …”</p>
<p>Not only Hussein’s protestations, but Sykes’s own actions, belie this
contention. On May 12, 1917, just one week after his first meeting with
Hussein, Sykes attended a high-level strategy meeting at Reginald
Wingate’s Cairo office. At that meeting, Sykes described in detail the
agreement he and Picot had reached with the Cairo-based Syrian
“delegates” nearly three weeks earlier, but made no mention of the
vastly more important accord he had supposedly reached with Hussein just
days prior. One reason may have been that this May 12 conference was
attended by Colonel Cyril Wilson, the official British liaison to
Hussein, and a person uniquely positioned to refute such an
assertion.</p>
<p>As for the subsequent meetings Sykes and Picot held with Hussein,
it’s difficult to discern any possible motive for two career military
officers, Stewart Newcombe and Cyril Wilson, whose missions in the Hejaz
would have been made markedly easier if Sykes’s account of those
meetings were true, to so vehemently refute it.</p>

<p>11 “I want to be”: Engle, The Nili Spies, pp. 186–87.</p>
<p>12 As a result: German warnings to the Turks over the treatment of
Jews continued even after the NILI spy ring was broken, with German
ambassador Bernstorff counseling Talaat Pasha to “not let a single case
of Jewish espionage blow up into a full-fledged persecution of Jews.”
Bernstorff to Foreign Ministry for Warburg, October 26, 1917; NARA T120,

finally ran out of luck on October 20, when he was captured outside
Jerusalem. Along with Naaman Belkind he was convicted of treason, and in
December 1917 both men were publicly hanged in Damascus.</p>
<p>16 For four days, she lingered: There is a wide divergence among
published accounts on both the duration of the NILI raid on Zichron
Yaakov, and on how long Sarah Aaronsohn survived after shooting herself.
The latter question would seem to be resolved by the testimony of the
doctor summoned after the shooting, who stated it was October 5, and by
the two German nuns who attended Sarah, who stated she died on October
9.</p>

<p>29 “L not working”: Lloyd, notes from travels, undated but late
October 1917; GLLD 9/10. In his authorized biography of Lawrence, Jeremy
Wilson incorrectly transcribed a crucial point in George Lloyd’s
handwritten note, rendering Lloyd’s original “HMG” (an abbreviation for
His Majesty’s Government) as “Allied.” As a result, his quote from Lloyd
inaccurately reads, “Lawrence not working for Allies but for Sherif.”
Obviously, this error lends a very different meaning to that Lloyd
intended—and to what Lawrence presumably said—but it is an error that
has been repeated by many of those Lawrence biographers who have sought
wherever possible to attribute Lawrence’s acts of official disobedience
as directed against Allied (i.e., French) actions rather than against
the British government.</p>

Arabia,” December 26, 1917; PRO-FO 371/3062, File 243033.</p>
<p>33 Over the coming months: Great historical confusion has arisen from
the fact that there were two Turkish leaders in Syria known by the
honorific Djemal Pasha. These were Ahmed Djemal Pasha (also sometimes
denoted as “the Greater”), the Syrian governor-general, and Mehmet
Djemal Pasha (sometimes denoted as Kucuk, or “the Lesser”). Not at all
helping matters, Mehmet Djemal adopted the Djemal Pasha honorific upon
assuming command of the Turkish Fourth Army in early 1918, the same
command that Ahmed Djemal had just vacated. T. E. Lawrence further added
to this confusion by frequently referring to “Djemal Pasha” in Seven
Pillars, without specifying whether he was talking about Ahmed or
Mehmet.</p>
<p>As a result, most histories of the period mistakenly conjoin the two
men as one, and thereby state that Faisal Hussein maintained a secret
correspondence with Ahmed Djemal into the summer of 1918. In actuality,
while Ahmed Djemal initiated the Turkish overture to Faisal in November
1917, all communication between them appears to have ended with Ahmed’s
recall to Constantinople the following month; Faisal’s subsequent
correspondence was with Mehmet Djemal.</p>
<p>Also, in both Seven Pillars and statements he made to his
contemporary biographers, Lawrence claimed that Faisal maintained a
separate negotiating correspondence with Turkish general Mustafa Kemal,
the future Kemal Ataturk. While that may have been the case, I have
found no documentary evidence to support this claim.</p>
<p>34 “By suitably guarded phrases”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars (Oxford),

<p>36 “All is fair”: Lawrence to Yale, October 22, 1929; YU, Box 1,

authorial role in Faisal’s correspondence with Mehmet Djemal, claiming
that he learned of it and read the various exchanges “unbeknownst” to
Faisal. This is contradicted both by statements Lawrence made to others,
and by his own account in Seven Pillars.</p>

<p>54 “if the Arab and Turkish”: Hogarth, memorandum attached to “The
Arab Question,” August 9, 1918; PRO-FO 371/3381, f. 113.</p>
<p>55 For the two days preceding: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, Appendix
II.</p>
<p>56 “as soon as Faisal is in possession”: Lawrence, “Note,” June 16,
1918; PRO-FO 141/688.</p>
<p>57 “there might be some difficulty”: Yale to Harrison, March 25,
1918; YU, Box 2, Folder 23.</p>
<p>58 Really the only way to Palestine: Gary to U.S. Secretary of State,
May 30, 1918; NARA RG59, Box 1047, 111.70Y.</p>
<p>59 “our government had no policy”: William Yale’s account of his
intelligence-gathering activities in Cairo in the spring and summer of
1918 is drawn from Yale, It Takes So Long, chapter 8.</p>
<p>60 “it is a well-known fact”: Yale to Harrison, July 1, 1918; YU, Box
2, Folder 35.</p>
<p>61 “Quietly these few men”: Yale to Harrison, April 29, 1918; YU, Box
2, Folder 28, pp. 10–11.</p>
<p>62 “Referring your report No. 28”: U.S. Secretary of State Lansing to
Yale, July 9, 1918; NARA RG59, Box 1047, 111.70Y.</p>
<p>63 “capable of a general”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 534.</p>
<p>64 “emancipated from Turkish”: Foreign Office to Wingate, June 11,
1918; PRO-FO 371/3381, f. 35–36. In fact, this was a rare case of
Lawrence’s cynicism failing him. As would be revealed at the Paris Peace
Conference, Mark Sykes had very carefully phrased his “Seven Syrians”
letter so that the promise of independence for lands freed by the “Arabs
themselves during the present war” could be interpreted as only applying
to those lands freed at the time of writing. By this sleight-of-hand
construction, most of greater Syria could be excluded.</p>
<p>65 The cover story Lawrence: Hogarth, memorandum attached to “The
Arab Question,” August 9, 1918; PRO-FO 371/3381, f. 113. Either this did
not end Faisal’s overtures to the Ottoman government, or the Germans
were not informed of the severing; even into early September 1918,
senior German diplomats and military officers wrote of the urgent need
to make peace with Faisal.</p>
<p>66 In doing so, all had ignored: Clayton to Foreign Office, May 3,
1918; PRO-FO 371/3403, f. 384.</p>
<p>67 “So for the last time we mustered”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars,
p. 544.</p>
<p>68 “I request that you see me”: Prüfer, Diary, July 31, 1918; HO.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-18-damascus-1">Chapter 18: Damascus</h4>
<p>1 “We ordered ‘no prisoners’”: Lawrence, “The Destruction of the 4th.
Army,” October 1918; PRO-WO 882/7, f. 360.</p>
<p>2 British prime minister: Gilbert, First World War, p. 452.</p>
<p>3 “Growing intimacy with”: Prüfer, Diary, August 30, 1918; HO.</p>
<p>4 It was surely an indication: Prüfer to AA, September 3, 1918; NARA
T137, Roll 138, Frames 329–30.</p>
<p>5 “I’ll tell you, Yale”: Yale, It Takes So Long, chapter 8,
p. 30.</p>
<p>6 “[I] lay there all day”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 586.</p>
<p>7 “I have been so violently”: Garnett, The Letters of T. E. Lawrence,
p. 244.</p>
<p>8 If exactly why remains: As in Seven Pillars, Lawrence was
peculiarly circumspect with both Robert Graves and Basil Liddell Hart
about his meeting with Nuri Shalaan in August 1918, only allowing that
it tormented him deeply. When Graves pressed on the matter, Lawrence
replied, “There was a particular and very horrible reason (not
published) for my distress at this moment” (Graves and Liddell Hart, T.
E. Lawrence: Letters to His Biographers, Pt. 1, p. 103). Similarly, when
Liddell Hart asked the nature of the pledge that Lawrence apparently
made to Shalaan, Lawrence replied, “Prefer not to reveal.” (UT Folder 1,
File 1.)</p>
<p>9 Lawrence had finally patched: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 579.</p>
<p>10 “today it came to me”: Ibid., p. 586.</p>
<p>11 “It is reported that the Syrians”: Yale to U.S. Director of
Military Intelligence, September 12, 1918; YU, Box 2, Folder 39.</p>
<p>12 “a pleasant little work”: Lawrence’s account of the September 1918
offensive in Syria is drawn from Seven Pillars, book 10, chapters
107–12, pp. 581–660.</p>
<p>13 “I was irritated”: William Yale’s recollections of the September
1918 British offensive in Syria are drawn from Yale, It Takes So Long,
chapter 9.</p>

Arabia, p. 549.</p>
<p>15 “The whole Turkish army”: Ibid.</p>
<p>16 To forestall that: Bartholomew to Joyce, September 21, 1918;

<p>18 Indeed, so rapid was: Lawrence to Dawnay, September 25, 1918;

incident, and of the attempt by some of Lawrence’s army colleagues to
defend his reputation against Lawrence himself, can be found in Mack, A
Prince of Our Disorder, pp. 234–40.</p>
<p>24 “we were on the eve”: Stirling, Safety Last, pp. 93–94.</p>
<p>25 “I understood that”: Wilson, Lawrence of Arabia, p. 563.</p>

<p>27 “We called out the Arab”: Lawrence, “The Destruction of the 4th.
Army,” October 1918; PRO-WO 882/7, f. 364.</p>
<p>28 “wet red galleries”: Lawrence, Seven Pillars, p. 656.</p>

<p>Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Caesar of Germany. A generation of his
subjects, including Curt Prüfer, was stirred by Wilhelm’s bellicose
demand that Germany assume its rightful “place in the sun.”</p>

<p>War at its most primal. Lawrence’s decisions on when and where to

forage.</p>

<p>Gilbert Clayton, Britain’s chief spymaster in Egypt and T. E.
Lawrence’s supervisor. By autumn 1917, Clayton was so concerned at the
risks Lawrence was taking that he planned to remove him from the
battlefield, “but the time is not yet, as he is wanted just now.”</p>

treks, astounded even his hardiest Bedouin companions.</p>

<p>“We turned our Hotchkiss on the prisoners and made an end of them.”

commander.</p>

<p>A primary target of the British and Arab rebels was the Hejaz
Railway, the lifeline of the Turkish army. By his count, Lawrence
personally destroyed seventy-nine bridges during the war.</p>

joined forces at the Paris Peace Conference to call for a combined
Arab-Jewish state in Palestine. This effort was ultimately sabotaged by
British and French imperial machinations.</p>

their tree,” Lawrence wrote a friend one week before the motorcycle
accident that killed him. This is one of the last formal portraits taken
