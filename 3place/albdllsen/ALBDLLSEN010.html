<h4 id="chapter-8-the-battle-joined">Chapter 8 The Battle Joined</h4>
<p>The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular troops—and we are
on the side of the dervishes.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, NOVEMBER 3, 1916</p>
<p>To break the tedium of the hot, slow voyage down the Red Sea, the
officers of HMS Lama organized an impromptu pistol-shooting competition
on the afternoon of October 15, 1916, their second day out from Port
Suez. Taking advantage of a calm sea, they lined bottles along one of
the converted merchant steamer’s rails, then gathered by the far rail to
take turns attempting to blast them to pieces.</p>
<p>The activity was not particularly pleasing to the Lama’s most
important passenger, the Oriental secretary to Egypt, Ronald Storrs. He
had hoped for a nap in the torpor following lunch, but found it
impossible amid all the gunfire, especially once the ship officers
advanced to experimenting with a captured Turkish black-powder rifle. “A
detonation about equal to that of an 18-pounder cannon,” Storrs noted in
his diary. “Conceived the idea, for my return, of holding up any
northbound vessel and boarding her.”</p>
<p>One of the standouts in the shooting competition was Storrs’s
traveling companion, T. E. Lawrence, who had taken up target practice as
a hobby during his days at Carchemish and become an expert marksman.
Excepting Lawrence’s fondness for gunplay, Storrs was quite pleased to
have his friend along on this trip. On his two earlier passages down the
Red Sea to Jeddah, the Oriental secretary had despaired at the lack of
interesting company. Already on this one, the “supercerebral” Lawrence
had given him a painstaking tutorial on the Playfair Cipher, an
ingenious cryptographic system as simple to construct as it was hard to
decode, and, as was their habit back in Cairo, the two had spent much of
the rest of the time discussing classical literature and art.</p>
<p>As with Storrs’s earlier trips to Jeddah, this October voyage was a
result of the Arab Revolt, now a little more than four months old.
Having served as a principal conduit between the British government and
Emir Hussein in the laborious negotiations leading up to that event, the
Oriental secretary had been a natural choice to continue in the role
once the battle was joined. By October 1916, however, the Arab Revolt
was fast reaching a crisis point, and it was an open question just how
much longer it might remain a concern to Ronald Storrs or anyone
else.</p>
<p>Testament to its tenuous slapdash nature was the manner in which the
outside world had learned of it in the first place. That had coincided
with Storrs’s first voyage to Arabia in June.</p>
<p>From coded messages secreted out of Mecca, the launch date for the
long-delayed uprising had finally been set for June 16, and so Storrs
had gone across to Jeddah from the Sudan on June 1 to meet up with
Abdullah, the emir’s second son and—should it actually come off—the
rebellion’s chief field commander. Except Abdullah was nowhere to be
found. After dispatching an envoy to Mecca with a request that Abdullah
come to the coast as soon as possible, Storrs had spent the next four
days trolling the Arabian shoreline aboard a British warship looking for
some sign of either Turkish or Arab military activity. The dreary port
towns had appeared even more soporific than usual.</p>
<p>On June 5, the envoy had finally returned from Mecca with a message
from Abdullah. “To the most honoured and respected Mr. Storrs,” the
letter began. “I deeply regret I am unable to meet you personally, but
an urgent need has called me and taken me, so my brother will come to
you with all the news.” That brother was twenty-year-old Zeid, the
youngest of Hussein’s four sons, and Storrs was directed to go to
Samima, a tiny coastal village south of Jeddah, where Zeid would make
his appearance the following morning. Whatever exasperation Storrs felt
over these complications was tempered by a peculiar development:
according to the envoy, the date for the revolt’s launch had been moved
up from June 16 to June 10. The Oriental secretary had long come to
accept that timetables rarely held in the Arab world, but he could
hardly recall an occasion when one had been moved forward.</p>
<p>Yet when finally he made contact with Zeid on the following morning,
the revised launch date now a mere four days away, there was little hint
of urgency. Instead, the cryptic young man had ushered Storrs into his
field tent erected on the beach, where he engaged in extended
pleasantries and chitchat while a retainer prepared coffee. Once the
coffee was served, Zeid handed Storrs an “execrably written” letter from
his father, detailing his plans for the coming revolt, as well as a
request for £70,000 worth of gold to help bankroll the rebel forces.
When Storrs pressed Hussein’s son on precisely how they intended to
defeat the enemy, it became evident that tactical considerations
remained at the rudimentary stage. “We will summon the Turks to
surrender,” Zeid replied, “and shoot them if they refuse.”</p>
<p>The Oriental secretary had barely been able to hide his impatience.
The British had been funneling gold and rifles to Hussein for many
months now, and Storrs had heard these grand plans—plans unblemished by
any attempt at actual execution—for nearly as long; as he and other
British agents had informed Hussein many times, no more funds would be
released until the revolt began. It was when Storrs reiterated this
message on the Samima beach that Zeid finally got around to dropping an
interesting bit of news: “I am then happy to be able to announce to you
that it began yesterday at Medina.”</p>
<p>Hustling Zeid and his chief lieutenant back to the waiting warship,
Storrs settled the two men at a hastily prepared breakfast table on the
afterbridge, where he and the two military intelligence officers who had
accompanied him from Cairo pumped the young sheikh for details. After
alerting Cairo to the news, and quickly composing notes of
congratulation to Hussein and Abdullah, Storrs gathered up whatever
items were close at hand that might provide immediate encouragement to
the rebel leaders: £10,000 worth of gold from the ship’s safe; five
cartons of cigarettes for Faisal and Abdullah, the two smokers in the
family; the promise of a Maxim machine gun, to be delivered in one
week’s time. Lending all this momentous activity a homey touch was the
wanderings of a small desert gazelle, bought in some Red Sea bazaar as a
ship’s mascot, that alternated between pronging the visitors with his
horns in a bid for attention and feeding on whatever cigarettes were
left lying about.</p>
<p>It had taken some time for clear battle lines to be drawn in the
Hejaz. Capitalizing on the element of surprise of the first few days,
Hussein’s rebels quickly overpowered the tiny Turkish force in Mecca
and, with the help of a British naval bombardment, the all-important
port of Jeddah. In Taif, Hussein’s “summer capital” in the mountains
below Mecca, Abdullah’s fighters took possession of the town while
isolating the Turkish garrison of some three hundred troops in their
well-defended fort. Matters didn’t go nearly so well in Medina, the
Hejaz’s largest city. There, the rebels, emboldened by reports of the
quick success in Mecca, had charged into the teeth of a vastly larger
and entrenched Turkish garrison, some ten thousand soldiers, and been
slaughtered by machine-gun and artillery fire. A month into the revolt,
an uneasy stasis had set in, Hussein’s forces firmly in control of Mecca
and Jeddah and several of the smaller southern coastal towns, the Turks
just as firmly in control of the railhead city of Medina, 150 miles to
the north of Mecca, as well as the coastal towns on the Red Sea’s upper
reaches.</p>
<p>From a political standpoint, news of the Arab Revolt had been
joyously received in Cairo and London. Coming on the heels of the
fiascoes at Gallipoli and Kut, here at long last was some good news out
of the Middle East. Most crucially, by virtue of his violent break with
Constantinople, Hussein—both custodian of Islam’s holiest shrines and
one of the Arab world’s most respected leaders—had fairly laid to rest
any lingering fear that the Turks and Germans might finally galvanize
their pan-Islamic jihad.</p>
<p>From a military standpoint, however, the British response was a good
deal more equivocal. Obviously, if the Arab rebels succeeded in tying
down large numbers of Turkish troops in the Arabian Peninsula, that
would help protect the British army’s right flank in an offensive into
Palestine, an operation now in the planning stages in Cairo. On the
other hand, by failing to spark a broader Arab uprising—in Syria and
elsewhere, the Hejaz revolt had been met with a resounding
silence—Hussein’s forces were left extremely vulnerable to a Turkish
counterattack and, given their spotty conduct thus far, unlikely to
prosper in such a contest. In that case, troops and matériel from the
British expeditionary army in Egypt might have to be siphoned off to aid
the rebels at the very moment that the commander of that army, General
Archibald Murray, was jealous to hold every available resource for his
prospective push into Palestine.</p>
<p>And that scenario was to invite a much greater risk, one that might
swiftly turn the Arab Revolt applauded by Britain’s more politically
minded war planners into the stuff of their worst nightmares. That’s
because it was not just the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that, by
Koranic dictate, were off-limits to non-Islamic “infidels”; to only a
slightly lesser degree this held true for the entire Hejaz. A hint of
this had attended Ronald Storrs’s first voyage to Arabia in June, when
Zeid had refused to allow Storrs’s two military intelligence colleagues
to accompany him ashore; instead, the Oriental secretary had been
compelled to come alone. In the following months, Hussein had concocted
a bit of scriptural wiggle room to permit a very small group of British
logistics officers to man a supply operation in the coastal town of
Rabegh, but strictly restricted their presence to the shoreline. To
allow them to venture farther inland, let alone to bring in whole units
of rescuing British Christian soldiers in the event of a major rebel
setback, would be to play directly into the hands of Turkish
propagandists and risk the immolation of all concerned: Hussein no
longer regarded as merely a traitor to the Ottoman Empire but to Islam
as well; Britain’s imperialist, Crusader intentions laid bare before an
enraged Muslim world.</p>
<p>In the face of this dilemma, Britain had tried to work at the
margins, bringing weaponry and gold to the Hejaz rebels through Rabegh,
while ferrying over whatever Muslim troops could readily be
spared—primarily Egyptians, along with a few Syrian and Iraqi
defectors—to provide training and a small on-the-ground presence. That
clearly wasn’t enough, though, and as the summer of 1916 wore on, with
the rebels’ disorganization becoming more apparent and the signs of a
Turkish counteroffensive more imminent, the debate in Cairo and London
between those seeking a broader involvement and those urging continued
caution took on a deepening urgency. Matters were not at all helped by
Emir Hussein. Indeed, well into the autumn he had carried on a version
of this debate all by himself depending on the latest news from the
battlefront, alternately rejecting plans to bring in non-Muslim troops
and pleading that any available troops be sent immediately, periodically
shifting to the middle ground of asking Cairo to keep such troops on
standby for possible intervention down the road.</p>
<p>By October, however, the time for such dithering had come to an end.
The Turkish garrison in Medina was now stronger than at the revolt’s
outset, having been reinforced by rail, and had recently pummeled a
rebel attack force led by Faisal, Hussein’s third son. With Faisal’s
warriors now withdrawn into the mountains, there were clear signs that
the Turks were preparing to march out of Medina with the goal of both
splitting the rebel armies in two and wresting back control of Mecca. In
response to the crisis, and to the increasingly anxious appeals of his
sons from their various battlefronts, Hussein had finally acceded to the
deployment of British troops to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>It was this development that was bringing Ronald Storrs to Jeddah for
the third time. In answer to Hussein’s request, and over the grumblings
of General Murray in Cairo, the British War Committee in London had just
agreed to send a brigade of British troops to the Hejaz—anywhere between
three and five thousand soldiers—along with a fleet of airplanes. For
the Oriental secretary, the opportunity to be the bearer of good news,
together with the companionship of T. E. Lawrence, at least partially
compensated for the growing distaste he felt for these tedious voyages
and for the town of Jeddah itself.</p>
<p>Lawrence had been quite aware of the intense debate that the Arab
Revolt had spawned in the upper reaches of the British war machine over
the previous months. That awareness came both from his perch within the
Cairo intelligence apparatus—the revolt had begun less than two weeks
after his return from Iraq—and from his friendship with Storrs. Still,
with his area of expertise centered squarely on Syria, he’d remained
very much on the outside of these deliberations. In fact, by the time he
joined Storrs on the Lama that October, his chief contribution to the
Hejaz effort could hardly have been more prosaic: postage stamps.</p>
<p>In thinking of how to counteract Turkey’s blanket silence on the Arab
Revolt in its early days, Storrs had struck upon the idea of issuing
“Republic of Hejaz” postage stamps, a cheap and effective way to prove
to the outside world that a break had occurred. When he’d asked Emir
Hussein for a suitably Islamic design, however, the resulting sketch
bore an eerie resemblance to an English lighthouse. Storrs had then
enlisted the help of his most learned Arabist friend, Lawrence, and the
two spent a leisurely afternoon wandering the Arab Museum in Cairo
selecting suitable motifs. Since, as Storrs related, “it was quickly
apparent that Lawrence already possessed or had immediately assimilated
a complete working technique of philatelic and three-colour
reproduction,” the Oriental secretary placed his friend in charge of
getting the stamps made.</p>
<p>The postage stamp project coincided with a particularly trying time
for Lawrence. Ever since coming to Cairo, he and the other eccentrics in
Stewart Newcombe’s tiny political intelligence unit at the Savoy had
been officially attached to the resident Egyptian army, an arrangement
Lawrence was quite happy with since the alternative was to fall under
the umbrella of the ponderous and fiercely hierarchical structure of
General Murray’s Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), the “regular” army
tasked to take the war to the Turks. However, as part of a bureaucratic
reorganization that summer—one of a half dozen wartime reorganizations
of the British administration in Cairo that sowed chaos each
time—Lawrence had been transferred into an intelligence unit wholly
under EEF control. Worse, the reassignment placed Lawrence under the
direction of a commanding officer he had little respect for, and
required he leave Cairo for the sleepy Suez Canal port town of Ismailia.
Lawrence had swiftly requested a transfer back to “the Intrusives” (the
name the Savoy Hotel unit had chosen for itself in recognition of their
repute within the military bureaucracy), but been just as swiftly
denied. “I interpreted this,” Lawrence wrote, “not without some friendly
evidence, as a method of keeping me away from the Arab affair.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence was nothing if not resourceful, and he had next thought
to put one of his more pronounced personality traits to good use: the
ability to annoy. With his new colleagues in Ismailia, he noted, “I took
every opportunity to run into them their comparative ignorance and
inefficiency in the department of intelligence (not difficult!) and
irritated them yet further by literary airs, correcting Shavian split
infinitives and tautologies in their reports.”</p>
<p>The strategy worked. In late September 1916, upon learning of Ronald
Storrs’s upcoming voyage to Jeddah, Lawrence requested a ten-day leave
from his new post, which his aggravated superiors were only too happy to
grant. In just this way, and in no official capacity save entourage to
Ronald Storrs, Lawrence set sail for Arabia for the first time.</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn on October 16, the Lama entered the wide bay of
Jeddah harbor and made for the port on its sheltered far shore. In the
early sun, Lawrence observed only light and shadow among the buildings
of that town, while beyond it was “the dazzle of league after league of
featureless sand.” As the steamer approached its berth, he was to
experience that phenomenon common to most who approach Arabia from the
water, that moment when the sea-cooled air abruptly collides with that
blowing off the land. As Lawrence would write, it was at that instant
when “the heat of Arabia came out like a drawn sword and struck us
speechless.”</p>
<p>IT WAS AN awkward meeting papered over with British politeness.
Coming off the Lama in midmorning, Storrs and Lawrence made the short
walk through Jeddah’s narrow streets to the handsome three-story
building that housed the British consulate, there to be greeted by the
resident British agent, Lieutenant Colonel Cyril Wilson. Wilson led his
visitors into a cool and pleasingly shuttered reception room—it was not
yet ten o’clock, but the whitewashed buildings of Jeddah already
radiated a blinding glare—and ordered up refreshments.</p>
<p>Ronald Storrs had long acquaintance with the slender, mustachioed
Wilson, a career army officer previously attached to the British
administration in the Sudan, but time had done nothing to improve his
opinion of the man. He found Wilson dull and irritable, with a hint of
the hysteric—“totally unsuited for anything beyond provincial
administration,” he’d once written—and thus completely out of his depth
in the important position he’d assumed in July, that of British
representative to Emir Hussein’s Hejaz “government.” In fact, the chief
reason Storrs hadn’t raised his objections to Wilson more forcefully
back in Cairo was out of mortal fear that should the man be sacked,
Storrs himself might be sent to Jeddah as his replacement.</p>
<p>For his part, Wilson seemed to resent these visits by the Oriental
secretary, the automatic deference shown him by Emir Hussein and his
emissaries while he, the officer on the ground, saw to all the
frustrating and thankless spadework of British policy.</p>
<p>There was also a bit of history between Wilson and Lawrence. Some
months earlier in Cairo, the lieutenant colonel had spotted Lawrence
wearing an Arab headdress while in uniform, and soundly rebuked him for
the offense. There was little indication the intelligence officer had
taken the criticisms of his appearance to heart in the interim, however,
judging by the sweat-stained uniform with which Lawrence had arrived at
the consulate door.</p>
<p>Still, all those in the reception room being British, none of this
friction was voiced or even acknowledged. Instead, Storrs and Wilson
feigned collegiality as they discussed the current situation in the
Hejaz and that day’s schedule. In adherence to Arab custom, the first
order of business was for them to pay a courtesy call on Sheikh
Abdullah, encamped some four miles out of town, as prelude to a more
substantive meeting to be held that evening at the consulate. Leaving
Lawrence to his own devices, the two senior men set out on horseback for
Abdullah’s camp in late morning.</p>
<p>When the trio reconvened at the mission building in early afternoon,
however, it was to unpleasant news. A cable had arrived from Cairo
announcing that, upon further reflection, the War Committee had chosen
to recall both the brigade of British troops and the fleet of airplanes
slated for imminent arrival in Rabegh. To add insult to injury, the
£10,000 of gold that Storrs had brought with him on the Lama for
disbursement to Abdullah was to be at least temporarily withheld. After
their morning visit to Abdullah, during which Storrs and Wilson were the
recipients of lavish Arab hospitality, they quite dreaded the sheikh’s
impending visit to the consulate.</p>
<p>Accompanied by his elaborately costumed court retainers and slaves,
Abdullah arrived shortly after five o’clock. Lawrence’s first impression
was of a particularly jolly man—perhaps heightened just then by
Abdullah’s recent success in the city of Taif, where the long-resistant
Turkish garrison had at last surrendered—with a touch of the voluptuary;
though he was not yet thirty-five, the sheikh’s face was already taking
on the rounded form of one who enjoyed his pleasures and indulged his
appetites. His jollity didn’t last long. Dispensing with the elaborate
pleasantries that normally accompanied such meetings, no sooner had
Abdullah and his chief lieutenants settled in the consulate reception
room than Wilson began reading aloud from the Cairo cable as Storrs
translated into Arabic. Abdullah listened with a hard-to-read
stoicism.</p>
<p>Once the reading was finished, Abdullah began to plead his case to
Storrs, a turn in the conversation the Oriental secretary tried to
forestall by explaining he had absolutely no authority in military
matters. It was more than a little disingenuous coming from the man who
had penned the secret overture to Hussein back in 1914, and for the
first time, the Britons in the room were witness to a flash of
Abdullah’s temper. “Pardon me,” he interrupted, “it was your letter and
your messages that began this thing with us, and you know it from the
beginning, and from before the beginning.”</p>
<p>Duly chastened, Storrs and his two countrymen mutely listened as
their visitor delivered a long soliloquy on the current grim state of
affairs in the Hejaz and the signal role Great Britain had played in
bringing it about. “He gave a fairly accurate historical summary of the
negotiations,” Storrs ruefully noted in his diary, “quoting several
times [His Majesty’s Government’s] promise that we would do everything
possible to help the Arabs.”</p>
<p>The conversation lasted for a couple of hours, Abdullah outlining all
his current difficulties, Storrs and Wilson promising to do all in their
limited power to get this latest decision reversed. Toward the meeting’s
conclusion, the sheikh turned to the task he clearly wished to avoid:
calling his father to break the news. The consulate telephone was
brought out and a call put through to Emir Hussein’s private line, Mecca
1.</p>
<p>To Storrs’s surprise, the emir seemed to take the disappointment
rather in stride, stating once again his full confidence in his British
partners and his faith that all would work out in the end. When at last
Abdullah departed from the mission building that evening, with plans
made for his return the next morning, he left his British hosts, as
Storrs would relate, “in a state of admiration for him and disgust with
ourselves.”</p>
<p>One person who had spoken very little through that long, tense
meeting—indeed, he may not have spoken at all—was T. E. Lawrence. Part
of the reason was obvious: he had no official capacity in being there,
and for him to offer an unsolicited opinion at such a delicate encounter
would have been a shocking breach of protocol. At the same time, this
remove allowed Lawrence to spend the time closely studying Abdullah—or
as he himself described it, “playing for effect, watching, criticizing
him.”</p>
<p>If Emir Hussein was the undisputed spiritual leader of the Arab
Revolt, Abdullah was its undisputed field marshal; so manifest was this
point that among the British military officers and diplomats involved in
the Hejaz affair, it had barely even come up for discussion. Abdullah
was his father’s most trusted son, the emissary he had sent to Cairo in
1914 to sound out the British over his secessionist plans, the military
commander who had seen to the capture of Taif, the family representative
who sat down and negotiated with their British advisors.</p>
<p>Yet even at this first meeting, Lawrence had his doubts. Despite the
somberness of the conversation at the consulate, he suspected in
Abdullah “a constant cheerfulness,” the mien of an astute politician but
not necessarily a sincere one, a man of overwhelming ambition. But there
was more to it than that. In poring over the intelligence reports coming
out of the Hejaz over the previous four months, Lawrence had tried to
analyze why the revolt had settled into dismal stasis after such a
promising start. He had concluded that, at its core, what the rebellion
lacked was true leadership, “not intellect, nor judgment, nor political
wisdom, but the flame of enthusiasm that would set the desert on fire.”
What it needed was a prophet, and as that meeting at the consulate had
extended, “I became more and more sure that Abdullah was too balanced,
too cool, too humourous to be a prophet—especially the armed prophet
who, if history be true, succeeded in revolutions.”</p>
<p>All of which, had Lawrence voiced these thoughts to his senior
colleagues, might have drawn an obvious response: who cares what you
think? But Lawrence didn’t voice them. Instead, it seems clear that
already by the evening of October 16, not yet in Arabia a half day, he
had taken it upon himself to calculate a new course for the Arab Revolt,
one that would cast him in a central role. That role, as he described it
in a moment of profound self-certainty—or breath-catching arrogance,
depending on one’s perspective—was “to find the yet unknown
master-spirit of the affair, and measure his capacity to carry the
revolt to the goal I had conceived for it.” For any of that to happen,
though, would require stealth on Lawrence’s part, an ability to keep his
own counsel and to quietly look for those openings that might allow him
to pursue his agenda. Over the course of that meeting with Abdullah,
Lawrence had found his first opening, one he would try to exploit as
early as the following morning.</p>
<p>But that long day of October 16, 1916, was not yet over. Before it
was, Lawrence was to encounter another personality whose presence loomed
large over the Hejaz, one who, by negative example, would soon further
clarify the mission Lawrence was creating for himself.</p>
<p>TOWARD THE END of the dinner at the French mission house in Jeddah,
Colonel Édouard Brémond raised his champagne glass in toast to his
British guests. “I have just heard,” he announced, “that my only male
relation up till now not killed or wounded in the war has been seriously
injured. It is thus my duty and my pride to drink to the Alliance, and
to say how much pleasure it gives me to be associated with
Englishmen.”</p>
<p>That poignant moment on the night of October 16 left a deep
impression on Ronald Storrs. “The un-French absence of panache in his
delivery was very striking. I drank to his cousin’s recovery and the
success of the French Mission.”</p>
<p>Now settled into a somewhat portly middle age, the forty-seven-year-
old Brémond was the exemplar of the French imperial soldier, guided by
an unwavering belief in both his nation’s greatness and the
righteousness of its mission civilisatrice, or “civilizing mission,” to
spread Gallic enlightenment and culture to the world’s disadvantaged.
For most of his military career, he had served in France’s North African
possessions, Algeria and then Morocco, and from his experiences battling
rebellious tribes had gained the reputation of being an expert in
irregular warfare. Promotion came steadily if unspectacularly:
supervisor of the Moroccan ports police, deputy head of the French
military mission to Morocco, administrator of the city of Rabat.</p>
<p>In the run‑up to World War I, Brémond had been recalled to France and
rushed to the front. As with so many of the French officer class in that
horrific first month of the war, Brémond’s tenure there was pitifully
brief, ending when he was shot through the chest while leading his men
into battle on the Belgian frontier. After recuperating from his wounds,
he was given command of an infantry regiment, the 64th, where for the
next two years he watched his military comrades, as well as his male
relatives, fall one by one to the Western Front slaughter. A release of
sorts presented itself in the summer of 1916 with the outbreak of the
Arab Revolt. In deciding to send a small military mission to the region,
the French Defense Ministry had looked to Brémond—“a practicing light in
native warfare, a success in French Africa”—and seen the perfect man to
lead it.</p>
<p>In fact, the colonel was the ideal candidate for reasons that went
beyond his long experience in the Muslim world. As with so many of its
actions in the Middle Eastern theater of the war, there was a hidden
agenda to the French mission to the Hejaz, one that required both
cunning and deviousness to execute. By good luck, these traits were very
well honed in Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Arabs to revolt had of course been a British
operation from the outset, and one that had made the French leadership,
with their imperial designs on Syria and Lebanon, very nervous when
they’d caught wind of it. Their concerns had been eased by the signing
of the secret Sykes-Picot agreement, codifying their Middle Eastern
claims, but had come rushing back when the Arab Revolt became a reality.
All talk of the Entente Cordiale aside, the French simply didn’t trust
their British allies to stand by their promises in the region, and with
the revolt in the Hejaz, they had now unleashed a revolutionary force
that might not be containable even if the British so desired. French
anxiety had only deepened when their proposal to send a token military
force to the region, a way to protect their future claim and monitor
events on the ground, was politely but firmly rebuffed by the British;
the situation in the Hejaz was so fluid and delicate, London had argued,
that the introduction of another foreign military presence just then
could only complicate matters.</p>
<p>So the French pursued a Trojan horse approach instead. The
two-hundred-man military unit that sailed out of Marseilles harbor under
Colonel Brémond’s command in August 1916 was officially titled the
French military mission to Egypt. The British couldn’t very well bar
such a mission from its closest ally, even if it begged the question of
just what the French soldiers intended to do in Egypt. To this, Colonel
Brémond had a ready answer: to facilitate the passage of Muslim pilgrims
from French territories, primarily Morocco and Algeria, seeking to make
the hajj to Mecca. The British couldn’t very well object to this either,
since their army and navy were already providing escort for thousands of
Egyptians and Indian Muslims making their own pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>It had been the last step in this little scheme that even the British
had to grudgingly admire for its audacity. Accompanying a group of
Moroccan pilgrims to Jeddah in mid-September, Brémond had disembarked,
seen to the rental of a suitably impressive building, and announced the
arrival of the French military mission to the Hejaz. In short order, he
fired off a cable to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urging the
establishment of a permanent diplomatic mission to Hussein’s
administration. When that request was approved, the French military and
diplomatic presence in Arabia was technically equal to that of the
British, a fait accompli that London found quite impossible to
counteract; after all, Paris could argue, here was the opportunity for
the two great allies to jointly plan for the region’s future on a basis
of equality, a course sure to only broaden their eternal bonds of
friendship. This was the situation facing Storrs and Lawrence when they
arrived in Jeddah in mid-October.</p>
<p>But Brémond’s cunning was not limited to the shell game he had
executed in establishing his Hejaz mission; it extended to the goal of
the mission itself. As he expounded during that dinner at the French
consulate on October 16, his overt role in the Hejaz was to show French
support for the Arab Revolt, and to ascertain how France might be able
to assist it. His covert role, however, was to try to limit the scope of
that revolt, to keep it and its aspirations for an Arab nation well away
from those Arab lands that France coveted in the postwar era. As for how
that might be done, Brémond had a neat, if supremely cynical, plan.</p>
<p>Above all else, he explained to his British guests that night, the
Arabs must not be allowed to take Medina. So long as the Turkish
garrison there held out, and so long as the Arabs concentrated their
blood and treasure on seizing it, the rebellion would remain safely
bottled up in the Hejaz. Should Medina fall, he warned, then the Arabs
would naturally turn their attention to the north, to liberating from
the Turkish yoke their Arab brethren in Palestine and Syria and Iraq, a
campaign that would inevitably conflict with British and French imperial
designs in the region.</p>
<p>It was cold-blooded perhaps, but a strategy quite brilliant in its
simplicity: while trying to help a foreign rebellion succeed was always
an iffy proposition, arranging for it to not succeed was infinitely
easier.</p>
<p>Yet at that dinner at the French consulate, Colonel Brémond was
laboring under at least two great misconceptions. The first was that
this element of connivance—of lending support to the Arab Revolt as a
means to hobble it—was actually necessary. If Brémond had known of the
Sykes-Picot Agreement, with its promise of a French Syria and Lebanon,
he might have been far more sanguine over the future course of the Arab
Revolt. But Sykes-Picot was known to only a very small handful of French
government officials, and this group did not include those midlevel
military and foreign ministry bureaucrats tasked to defend France’s
claims in the Middle East. Incredibly, this information had also been
withheld from the man sent to Arabia to serve as the frontline guardian
of those claims.</p>
<p>Brémond’s second misconception was in assuming that, as he held forth
to his British guests that evening, he was among friends—or at least,
like-minded imperialists. He was not, and he most especially was not of
the young British captain who sat at the dining table and barely spoke.
As Brémond was soon to discover, in T. E. Lawrence he had a very
formidable opponent. What’s more, advantage had just passed to Lawrence.
At the French consulate, Brémond had laid his hand bare; Lawrence had
revealed nothing.</p>
<p>PRECEDED BY A phalanx of slaves, Abdullah rode on a white mare into
the courtyard of the British consulate at about ten o’clock the
following morning. He was more somber than the day before, and once
settled into the consulate reception room, he explained why. He had just
received a cable from his brother Faisal at his mountain encampment
north of Rabegh reporting that two Turkish warplanes had bombed his camp
the previous afternoon; while inflicting little damage, they had sown
terror among the tribesmen, most of whom had never seen such machines
before. The news was especially pointed, considering the attack came on
the same day the British had canceled plans to send their own fleet of
airplanes to Arabia.</p>
<p>This drew a response from Lawrence, who suggested that this Turkish
show of force shouldn’t be cause for much alarm. “Very few Turkish
airplanes last more than four or five days,” he breezily explained.</p>
<p>It was probably with this comment that Abdullah truly took notice of
Lawrence—a mere background presence the previous day—for the first time.
He soon had reason to take even greater notice when the conversation
turned to a discussion on the location of various Turkish forces around
the Middle East. “As Syrian, Circassian, Anatolian, Mesopotamian names
came up,” Ronald Storrs recalled, “Lawrence at once stated exactly which
[Turkish] unit was in each position, until Abdullah turned to me in
amazement: ‘Is this man God, to know everything?’”</p>
<p>In his memoirs, Storrs attributed his friend’s remarkable performance
that morning to happy coincidence stemming from Lawrence’s labors in the
Cairo mapmaking room. Perhaps, or perhaps Lawrence was merely bluffing.
Either way, the effect was the same, and it provided Lawrence with the
platform to roll out his scheme.</p>
<p>The chief difficulty the British faced in assisting the Arab Revolt,
he explained to Abdullah, was a lack of reliable information on what was
actually taking place on the ground. What was needed was an objective
observer, one who could gain the ear of senior British war planners, to
provide a comprehensive report on the situation, both on the problems
that seemed to be plaguing the supply pipeline in the port town of
Rabegh and on the logistical needs of Faisal’s forces in the mountains
to the north. Since time was clearly of the essence, Lawrence put
himself forth as the man who might carry out this mission.</p>
<p>It was an innocuous enough proposal, and one Abdullah immediately
agreed to, suggesting that once Lawrence was in Rabegh, he would arrange
for Faisal to come down from the mountains to meet with him. To this,
Lawrence politely demurred. He needed to appraise the situation inland
for himself, which meant he needed to go to Faisal, not the other way
around. Given the stricture against non-Muslims traveling to the
interior, it was a bold request. Even Cyril Wilson, who had met Faisal
twice and whom Emir Hussein greatly respected, had only been permitted
to step down at port towns and wait for Faisal’s appearance.</p>
<p>With Storrs joining in the lobbying effort, Abdullah was gradually
won over to the idea—no doubt the current tenuousness of the Arab
position had a loosening effect—but the ultimate decision rested with
the more formidable Hussein. As Abdullah expected, his father was
extremely ambivalent to the plan when he was called on the Mecca trunk
line, spurring Storrs to take command of the telephone receiver.</p>
<p>“Storrs in full blast was a delight to listen to in the mere matter
of Arabic speech,” Lawrence would recall, “and also a lesson to every
Englishman alive of how to deal with suspicious or unwilling Orientals.
It was nearly impossible to resist him for more than a few minutes, and
in this case [he] also had his way.”</p>
<p>But it was a qualified victory. The most Hussein would allow was for
Lawrence to put in at Rabegh, and there to meet with his eldest son,
Ali; if Ali “thought fit,” he would then arrange Lawrence’s onward
journey to meet Faisal. It was not at all hard to see how this was going
to end up. Ali had a reputation for caution, and for the cautious, the
default answer is always no. Storrs and Lawrence resolved to push the
matter when Abdullah returned to the British consulate for dinner that
evening.</p>
<p>At that dinner, Storrs and Lawrence urged Abdullah to write formal
letters of introduction to Ali and Faisal, figuring this would greatly
enhance the odds of Lawrence being given permission to travel inland.
This Abdullah was initially very reluctant to do, but, gaining his
father’s approval over the telephone line, Lawrence recounted, Abdullah
finally penned “direct written instructions to Ali to mount me as well
and as quickly as possible, and convey me, by sure hand, to Faisal’s
camp.”</p>
<p>Early on the morning of October 19, HMS Lama put into Rabegh harbor.
For the rest of his life, an image would stick in Ronald Storrs’s mind
of Lawrence standing on the pier and waving goodbye as Storrs’s ship
turned and made for Egypt. Lawrence’s Arabian adventure had begun.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE’S HUNCH ABOUT Ali proved absolutely correct; the eldest
Hussein son was staggered when he was handed the letter from Abdullah
dictating their father’s permission for the young British army captain
to travel inland. However, with the fealty with which all the Hussein
sons showed their father, Ali saw no choice but to acquiesce, and he set
about arranging Lawrence’s journey.</p>
<p>Situated at the edge of a broad desert plain, the nondescript little
port of Rabegh seemed an unlikely spot to hold anyone’s attention for
very long, let alone to be the strategic linchpin in the war for control
of the Arabian Peninsula. Yet, situated midway between Mecca and Medina,
Rabegh was a crucial way station on the “pilgrims’ road”—little more
than a camel track marked by stone cairns—that linked those two holy
cities, which meant it stood squarely in the path of any Turkish army
moving south to retake Mecca. Rabegh was also the chief transshipment
point for British supplies and weaponry coming down from Egypt to be
distributed to the rebels fighting inland—or not distributed, merely
vanishing somewhere en route, as more often seemed to be the case.</p>
<p>If Rabegh was not the most appealing place, the two and a half days
Lawrence spent there did provide him with the chance to meet two more of
Emir Hussein’s sons, and to submit them to the same sort of character
study he had performed on Abdullah in Jeddah.</p>
<p>By coincidence, Zeid, the youngest, had recently arrived to help Ali
sort out the supply-line problems. A half brother to Hussein’s other
three sons, Zeid was a handsome youth of twenty, who had inherited the
pale complexion and softer features of his Turkish mother. Although he
was clearly quite intelligent, both his youth and non-Arab appearance
would have made him an unlikely rebel commander even if he possessed
leadership traits, which he did not. “Is fond of riding about and
playing tricks,” Lawrence noted. “Humorous in outlook, and perhaps a
little better balanced, because less intense, than his brothers.
Shy.”</p>
<p>Despite the strained circumstances of their first meeting, Lawrence
took a quick liking to Ali. “His manner was dignified and admirable, but
direct,” he wrote, “and he struck me as a pleasant gentleman,
conscientious.” But there was a forlorn, tired air to Hussein’s eldest
son, his skin sallow, his mouth “sad and drooping,” that made him seem
far older than his thirty-seven years. Without apparent ambition for
himself, Lawrence observed, Ali also seemed to fall under the sway of
whatever more dynamic personality happened to be nearby, hardly the
hallmark of a natural leader. Still, Lawrence much preferred Ali to
Abdullah, noting that “if Faisal should turn out to be no prophet, the
revolt would make shift well enough with Ali for its head.” Perhaps, but
it was a make-do assessment that considerably raised the stakes for
Lawrence’s meeting with Faisal.</p>
<p>He set out for that meeting on the night of October 21. Indicative of
Ali’s abiding concern over the journey—part of the hundred-mile trek
would be through areas controlled by tribes hostile to the revolt—were
the elaborate precautions he’d taken, keeping news of Lawrence’s
departure and destination secret from even his closest household slaves.
To serve as Lawrence’s guides, he had chosen two of his most trusted
lieutenants, a father and son who, by the unwritten law of the Arabian
tribes, were expected to lay down their lives to protect their charge.
Ali further directed the three men to avoid all settlements along the
route and to travel at night as much as possible, even that Lawrence
wear a headdress over his army uniform so as to cast a sufficiently
Arab-looking silhouette in the moonlight.</p>
<p>The potential for danger notwithstanding, very soon after setting out
Lawrence’s preoccupation turned to the more mundane, the grinding
physical discomfort of riding a camel again after two years sitting
behind a desk at the Savoy Hotel. Since its pronounced and narrow spine
lies just below the skin, riding a camel is a wholly different
experience from riding a horse, more akin to sitting atop a swaying
metal rod. Even the best Bedouin saddle—little more than a
wood-and-leather frame covered in blankets—can only slightly dull the
pain for the green rider. Most such riders can rarely withstand the
suffering for more than two or three hours without a break, but Lawrence
was to have no such luxury on this journey; instead, what lay before him
was an ordeal of some thirty hours in the saddle broken only by two
short breaks. He spurred himself on by summoning the extraordinary
endurance he had shown in the past—on his bicycle tours of France, on
his twelve-hundred-mile hike through Syria—and by holding the thought
that at the other end awaited the last of the Hussein brothers, the man
who might prove to be his “prophet” of war.</p>
<p>Despite his discomfort—or maybe as a way to distract from it—Lawrence
made a careful study of the terrain they were crossing, jotting down
notes in his small army-issue notebook as he rode. He was traversing a
land only a handful of outsiders had ever glimpsed, one steeped in a
desert culture little changed in millennia, but with just enough
similarities to the Syria he knew so well as to be thoroughly
disorienting. In Syria he had made a hobby of sorting out the
complicated clan and tribal structures, the complex rules that governed
their interaction, but in Arabia all those rules were far more layered,
far more rigidly upheld.</p>
<p>“Each hill and valley in it had a man who was its acknowledged
owner,” he wrote, “and [who] would quickly assert the right of his
family or clan to it against aggression. Even the wells and trees had
their masters, who allowed men to make firewood of the one and drink of
the other freely, as much as was required for their need, but who would
instantly check anyone trying to turn the property to account.… The
desert was held in a crazed communism by which Nature and the elements
were for the free use of every known friendly person for his own
purposes and no more.”</p>
<p>In Syria, the price for transgression was most often ostracism,
perhaps the handing over of a sheep in fine; in the sere and harsh
landscape of Arabia, it was death.</p>
<p>But if still the amateur anthropologist, Lawrence was also taking
note of the topography of the Hejaz through the eyes of a military man:
where sources of water might be found, the trails an army might navigate
to best advantage. In this way, he happened upon a glaring hole in his
own army’s contingency plans.</p>
<p>In preparing for the defense of Rabegh—which by definition also meant
the defense of Mecca—British officers advising the rebels had mapped out
the Turks’ most likely approaches, ones predicated on the existence of
trails and the supply of water, and overseen the building of outlying
guardposts accordingly. Yet on his journey to Faisal’s camp, Lawrence
came upon two seasonal watercourses that didn’t appear on any British
maps, and that would allow an attacking army to either fall on Rabegh
from an unforeseen direction or to sidestep the port town completely on
its way to Mecca. How had the British advisors, who had now been in
Rabegh for three months, remained ignorant of these watercourses, and
why had the local Arabs, who surely knew of them, not raised the alarm?
Quite simply, because quarantined as they were on the shoreline, the
British hadn’t been aware enough of their surroundings to formulate the
question, and without the question, the Arabs hadn’t been aware enough
of British concerns to offer the information. To Lawrence, it
underscored both the difficulty in trying to marry two such very
different cultures for the purpose of making war, and the potential for
disaster in Hussein’s stricture against nonbelievers traveling inland;
no matter how many British troops were brought over, so long as they
were isolated on the coast, in their ability to gauge danger they might
as well be in blindfolds.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon of October 23, Lawrence’s party rounded a wall
of high stone cliffs to suddenly find themselves in the verdant valley
of Wadi Safra, the refuge for Faisal’s rebel army that had so recently
been humbled outside Medina. As they ascended toward the headwaters,
Lawrence began to see small encampments of armed men scattered among the
hillside villages, camps that steadily grew in size and proliferation
until they seemed to fill most every level stretch of land.</p>
<p>At last the party entered Hamra, a village of about one hundred
homes, and drew up before a long, low house where a sword-wielding slave
stood guard. Dismounting from his camel, Lawrence was admitted into the
inner courtyard to see the profile of a man standing in the far doorway.
“[He] looked very tall and pillar-like,” he wrote, “very slender, in his
long white silk robes and his brown headcloth bound with a brilliant
scarlet and gold cord. His eyelids were drooped, and his black beard and
colorless face were like a mask against the strange, still watchfulness
of his body.”</p>
<p>It was Faisal ibn Hussein. As Lawrence would later write in Seven
Pillars of Wisdom, “I felt at first glance that this was the man I had
come to Arabia to seek, the leader who would bring the Arab Revolt to
full glory.”</p>
<p>MAYBE, BUT IN actual fact, their initial meeting did not go well.
Ushered into the home, Lawrence joined Faisal and a dozen or so other
men, chieftains of various tribes that had joined the revolt, in a dimly
lit room covered with carpets. As did his brothers, Faisal possessed a
courtly graciousness, and he thanked Lawrence for making the long and
difficult journey to visit him. This preamble soon gave way, though, to
a more somber discussion of his recent string of military setbacks at
the hands of the Turks.</p>
<p>Of Hussein’s sons, Faisal and his followers had borne the greatest
amount of fighting since the start of the revolt, and had done so while
receiving the least in the way of supplies and funds. Most recently, he
explained to his visitor, his men had been on the verge of a great
victory at Bir Abbas, on Medina’s outskirts. Instead, for lack of
artillery to counteract that brought to bear by the Turks, his army had
foundered and then been scattered. The remnants of that army—many had
peeled away and returned to their homes—were now encamped there with him
in the mountain safeness of Hamra, awaiting the Turks’ next move. That
was how things stood. Properly supplied and armed, Faisal contended, his
men were capable of anything, but if the current situation persisted,
where they had to beg the British for every ounce of matériel—most of
which never reached the front lines anyway—then the future course of the
uprising was already written. When the Turks came out of their
stronghold in Medina and marched for the coast, a march that now seemed
imminent, it would leave Faisal with the choice of either being stranded
in the mountains or beating a retreat back toward Mecca. The first
option would mean slow annihilation, the second rapid disintegration,
for just as had occurred after Bir Abbas, many of his followers would
refuse to flee so far away from their tribal areas—they would just go
home.</p>
<p>Even as he listened, Lawrence intently studied Faisal, looking for
clues to both his personality and the nature of the hold he had over the
other men crowded into the room. “He was a man of moods,” he noted,
“flickering between glory and despair, and just now dead tired. He
looked years older than thirty-one, and his dark, appealing eyes, set a
little sloping in his face, were bloodshot, and his hollow cheeks deeply
lined and puckered with reflection.… In appearance he was tall, graceful
and vigorous, with the most beautiful gait, and a royal dignity of head
and shoulders. Of course he knew it, and a great part of his public
expression was by sign and gesture.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was also Faisal’s exhaustion that caused him to speak far
more bluntly than his brothers had of the element of distrust that lay
at the core of the Arabs’ relationship with Britain, a distrust
reflected in everything from Hussein’s tortuous two-year negotiation
with Storrs and McMahon to the restricting of British advisors to the
coast. Since history clearly showed the British didn’t help others out
of the goodness of their heart, Faisal asked, just what was it they
wanted of the Hejaz?</p>
<p>As many other British officers had done with other members of
Hussein’s Hashemite clan, in the dimly lit home in Hamra, Lawrence
patiently reassured Faisal that the British had absolutely no
territorial interests in the Hejaz. That assurance lost some of its
luster, Faisal pointed out, when it was recalled that the British had
said precisely the same thing about the Sudan before grabbing it.</p>
<p>Their somewhat prickly conversation extended through dinner, then
started up again at 6:30 the next morning when Faisal showed up at
Lawrence’s tent. In these talks, Lawrence found Hussein’s third son to
be “most unreasonable,” and yet there was something about the passion
with which he spoke, the hard determination behind it, that Lawrence
found profoundly compelling. It was a passion he’d found lacking in both
Abdullah or Ali, and it fueled his conviction that in Faisal he had
found his leader.</p>
<p>That conviction was strengthened when Lawrence spent several hours
that day wandering among the rebel encampments, falling into
conversation with whoever crossed his path. One of the first things that
struck him was the range of tribes they represented. In the
ever-fractious world of Arabia, rare was the man who could unite even
the various tribes and clans in his immediate area, but here in Wadi
Safra were thousands of men representing nearly every tribal group
across the breadth of the western Hejaz, some a full two weeks’ journey
away from their homelands. Even more remarkable, this was an army that
had been put to flight by the Turks just a week earlier, and yet their
morale and confidence in ultimate victory seemed utterly unshaken. The
man who had molded that unity and spurred that confidence was
Faisal.</p>
<p>That evening, having been in Wadi Safra for only slightly more than
twenty-four hours, Lawrence stopped by Faisal’s headquarters to say
goodbye. Their parting conversation was more relaxed than those of
earlier, with Faisal thanking Lawrence for coming and Lawrence holding
out the vague hope that perhaps his trip would prove of some benefit.
With that, he mounted a new camel and, with a squad of fourteen warriors
as bodyguards, made for the nearest rebel-held Red Sea port, the town of
Yenbo, where a British ship might collect him for his return to Egypt.
He was anxious to get there, for he was now firmly convinced that in
Faisal ibn Hussein the revolt had found its prophet. “It was all and
more than we had hoped for,” he wrote, “much more than our halting
course deserved. The aim of my trip was fulfilled.”</p>
