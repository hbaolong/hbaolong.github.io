<h4 id="chapter-7-treachery">Chapter 7 Treachery</h4>
<p>It seems to me that we are rather in the position of the hunters who
divided up the skin of the bear before they had killed it. I personally
cannot foresee the situation in which we may find ourselves at the end
of the war, and I therefore think that any discussion at the present
time of how we are going to cut up the Turkish Empire is chiefly of
academic interest.</p>
<p>BRITISH GENERAL GEORGE MACDONOGH, DIRECTOR OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE,
JANUARY 7, 1916</p>
<p>On November 16, 1915, T. E. Lawrence penned a note to an old friend,
Edward Leeds, one of the Ashmolean curators back in Oxford. It had been
just three weeks since the death of his brother Will, and Lawrence was
in a forlorn mood. After apologizing for his long silence, he told Leeds
it was partly due to the demands of his job, “and partly because I’m
rather low because first one and now another of my brothers has been
killed. Of course, I’ve been away a lot from them, and so it doesn’t
come on one like a shock at all, but I rather dread Oxford and what it
may be like if one comes back. Also they were both younger than I am,
and it doesn’t seem right, somehow, that I should go on living
peacefully in Cairo.”</p>
<p>If war is an inherently confounding experience, Lawrence could be
forgiven that November for finding his particularly so. In the eleven
months since he had arrived in Cairo, he had been largely confined to a
suite of offices in the Savoy Hotel, a world away from the Western Front
killing fields that had taken the lives of his brothers. Even more
bewildering, he had expended his greatest energies not on battling the
enemy, but engaged in “paper-combat” against the parochial interests of
Britain’s military bureaucracy and those of its closest ally,
France.</p>
<p>The uselessness of those struggles was plain to see on the great map
of the Ottoman Empire tacked to the wall of the Savoy offices. In
November 1915, after a year of war in that theater and the deaths of
hundreds of thousands, the map remained virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>In Gallipoli, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force still clung to
their blood-soaked beachheads, but even those tiny toeholds in Turkey
were soon to disappear; in a cruel irony, the Allied withdrawal from
Gallipoli, just then about to get under way, was to be the only
well-executed phase of the entire campaign. In Anatolia, the suffering
of the Armenians continued unabated, and was now being joined by that of
the would-be Arab secessionists in Syria, their leadership decimated by
Djemal Pasha’s secret police. A landing in Alexandretta that might have
aided both groups now seemed a dead issue, even if for reasons no one in
Cairo could quite discern (it would still be some weeks before the
London War Office got around to informing Egypt of the French
government’s formal spiking of the plan). In its stead, there was now
growing talk of a conventional frontal assault against the entrenched
Turkish forces at the far end of the Sinai in Palestine. Should that
offensive be successful—and the example of Gallipoli offered scant
reason to think it would—the British army would then be consigned to a
long, slow grind north toward the Turkish heartland. Just about the only
bright spot anywhere on that map was in Iraq. There, a British Indian
army had steadily advanced up the Tigris River over the past seven
months, and by mid-November stood at the gates of Baghdad. Even if that
city at the Ottoman periphery were taken, however, it was hard to see
its material effect on Constantinople, a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>Almost by default, then, Lawrence had increasingly looked to Arabia
as the one place left that afforded a ray of hope, where the
unconventional war he was convinced was needed to defeat the Turks might
be waged. This hope had been given new vigor just days earlier. In the
wake of Mohammed al-Faroki’s revelations, the British high commissioner
in Egypt, Henry McMahon, had rushed off a new letter to Emir Hussein
acceding to nearly all his territorial demands for an independent Arab
nation in payment for a British-allied Arab revolt. On November 5, an
equally accommodating reply had come in to Cairo from Hussein. A few
smaller points still needed to be worked out, but there was now a broad
agreement in place for an Arab uprising against Turkey.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence could possibly have imagined that this truly
resolved matters. To the contrary, a perverse mind-set had settled in
among the warring European powers by that autumn of 1915, one that
suggested the situation in the Middle East was about to become far more
complicated and contentious.</p>
<p>To understand this mind-set, one had to appreciate the paralysis that
held over the larger map of the war. On the Western Front, the
four-hundred-mile-long strip of no-man’s-land separating the French and
British armies from those of the Germans had barely moved in a year.
While much less static, a different kind of stalemate had set in on the
Eastern Front. There, after being mauled by German forces on its
northwestern frontier in the first days of the war, Russia had taken
revenge on the hapless Austro-Hungarian armies on its southwestern, only
to be mauled anew when Germany came to Austria-Hungary’s rescue. It
established a deadly pattern—Russian success against Austria-Hungary
negated by German success against Russia—that would continue into 1917.
For sheer mindless futility, though, it was hard to compete with the
newly opened Southern Front in northeastern Italy. Having belatedly
joined the war on the side of the Entente, by November 1915 Italy had
already flung its army four times against a vastly outnumbered
Austro-Hungarian force commanding the heights of a rugged mountain
valley, only to be slaughtered each time; before war’s end, there would
be twelve battles in the Isonzo valley, resulting in some 600,000
Italian casualties.</p>
<p>Of course, stasis is a two-way street, and if this broader map
yielded no good news for the Entente, the same held true for the Central
Powers.</p>
<p>Given this stunning lack of progress earned at such horrific cost, it
might seem reasonable to imagine that the thoughts of the various
warring nations would now turn toward peace, to trying to find some way
out of the mess. Instead, precisely the opposite was happening.</p>
<p>It’s a question that has faced peoples and nations at war since the
beginning of time, and usually produced a terrible answer: in
contemplating all the lives already lost, the treasure squandered, how
to ever admit it was for nothing? Since such an admission is
unthinkable, and the status quo untenable, the only option left is to
escalate. Thus among the warring states in Europe at the end of 1915 it
was no longer a matter of satisfying what had brought them into the
conflict in the first place—and in many cases, those reasons had been
shockingly trivial—but to expand beyond them, the acceptable terms for
peace not lowered, but raised. This conflict was no longer about playing
for small advantage against one’s imperial rivals, but about hobbling
them forever, ensuring that they might never again have the capability
to wage such a devastating and pointless war.</p>
<p>But defeating one’s enemies is only half the game; for a war to be
truly justifiable one has to materially gain. In modern European custom,
that need had been sated by the payment of war reparations into the
victor’s coffers, the grabbing of a disputed province here or there, but
that seemed rather picayune in view of this conflict’s cost. Instead,
all the slaughter was to be justified by a new golden age of empire, the
victors far richer, far grander than before. Naturally, this simply
propelled the cycle to its logical, murderous conclusion. When
contemplating all to be conferred upon the eventual winners, and all to
be taken from the losers, how to possibly quit now? No, what was
required was greater commitment—more soldiers, more money, more loss—to
be redeemed when victory finally came with more territory, more wealth,
more power.</p>
<p>While the Central Powers had their own imperial wish list in the
event of victory, one that also grew more grandiose as time went on, for
the Entente powers of Great Britain, France, and Russia there really was
only one place that offered the prospect of redemption on the scale
required: the fractured and varied lands of the Ottoman Empire. Indeed,
by the autumn of 1915 that empire was now often referred to by cynics in
the Entente capitals simply as “the Great Loot.”</p>
<p>For all three powers, the war in the Middle East was now to become
about satisfying the imperial cravings—desiderata, as it was politely
known—they had long harbored. The czars of Russia had been angling to
grab Constantinople for at least two hundred years. Similarly, France
had enjoyed a special status as protector of the Ottoman Empire’s
Catholic population in Syria since the sixteenth century; if that empire
was to be dismantled, then that region should rightly go to her. For its
part, Britain had long been obsessed with protecting the land approaches
to India, its “jewel in the crown,” from encroachment by its imperial
rivals— paradoxically, Russia and France foremost among them. Then there
was the religion factor. All three of the principal Entente powers were
devoutly Christian nations in 1915, and even after six hundred years it
still grated many that the Christian Holy Land lay in Muslim hands. In
carving up the Ottoman Empire there was finally the chance to replay the
Crusades to a happier ending.</p>
<p>What probably most propelled these old desires into the realm of
possibility were the secret negotiations between Britain and Emir
Hussein. As those negotiations became less secret among the Allies, and
the prospect of an Arab revolt more real, it produced not so much a
piquing of imperial appetites as a mighty collective slavering.</p>
<p>By late November, France, tipped to Britain’s dealings with Hussein
and anxious to stake its claim, would hastily compile its own ambitious
set of desiderata for the region. French demands would soon be joined by
those of Russia. Confronted by the gluttonous wishes of its principal
allies—allies today perhaps, but probably rivals again tomorrow—Britain
would suddenly decide that it too was in an acquisitive mood, and never
mind the promises it had so recently made to Hussein. Maneuvering for
their own spot at the feeding trough would ultimately come Italy and
even neutral Greece. All of this would quickly make military
considerations in the Middle East subordinate to political ones, and
move the decision-making process away from military officers in the
field to diplomats and politicians huddled in staterooms. If the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the former had been their ineptitude,
at least their intent had been clear; with the rise of the statesmen,
and with different power blocs jockeying for advantage, all was about to
become shrouded in treachery and byzantine maneuver.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the man who was to play a singular role in generating
that intrigue arrived in Cairo on November 17, 1915, just the day after
Lawrence had complained to Edward Leeds of his peaceful life there. His
name was Mark Sykes—or, more formally, Sir Tatton Benvenuto Mark Sykes,
6th Baronet of Sledmere.</p>
<p>Few people in history have so heedlessly caused so much tragedy. At
the age of thirty-six, the handsome if slightly doughy Sykes epitomized
that remarkable subclass of British aristocrats of the late imperial age
known as the “Amateurs.” Despite its somewhat derogatory modern
connotation, the term derives from the Latin “for the love of,” and in
this context denoted a select group of wealthy and usually titled young
men whose breeding, education, and freedom from careerist pressures—it
was considered terribly déclassé for such men to hold down bona fide
jobs—allowed them to dabble over a broad range of interests and find all
doors flung open to them. Raised on a thirty-thousand-acre ancestral
estate as the only child of a Yorkshire aristocrat, Sykes, like so many
of his fellow Amateurs, seemed intent on living the lives of ten
“ordinary” men. Educated at Cambridge, he had traveled extensively
throughout the Ottoman Empire, authored four books, been a soldier in
the Boer War, served as parliamentary secretary to the chief
administrator of Ireland and honorary attaché to the British embassy in
Constantinople—and those were just the highlights up to the age of
twenty-five. In the succeeding eleven years before his arrival in Cairo
that autumn, he had married and had sired five children—a sixth would
soon be on the way—won a reputation as an accomplished caricaturist,
invented an early version of the overhead projector and, since 1912,
served as the Conservative member of Parliament for Hull Central.</p>
<p>Sykes’s appearance in Cairo was a result of the most recent addition
to his résumé. The previous spring, Lord Kitchener had appointed him as
an advisor to the de Bunsen Committee, an interdepartmental government
board designed to guide the British cabinet on Middle Eastern affairs.
Unsurprisingly, Sykes had quickly emerged as the dominant member of that
committee, and in July 1915 set out on an extended fact-finding mission
to the region with the intention of imparting his firsthand impressions
to the cabinet upon his return.</p>
<p>Lawrence and Sykes first met that August, during Sykes’s stopover in
Cairo on the outgoing leg of his fact-finding mission. Like most
everyone else, Lawrence took a quick liking to the charming and
personable MP. He and others in the Cairo intelligence staff were also
gratified to finally find someone in the senior branches of the British
government who appeared to appreciate their ideas for unconventional
warfare. That estimate was initially fortified upon Sykes’s return to
Egypt in November; he had spent the previous two months meeting with
officials in British India, a group vehemently opposed to the
war-by-proxy plots emanating out of British Egypt, and the returned
Sykes made no secret that his sympathies lay with the Egyptian
approach.</p>
<p>Yet for all his astounding achievements, Mark Sykes exemplified
another characteristic common among the British ruling class of the
Edwardian age, a breezy arrogance that held that most of the world’s
messy problems were capable of neat solution, that the British had the
answers to many of them, and that it was their special burden—no less
tiresome for being God-given—to enlighten the rest of humanity to that
fact. Sykes’s special skill in this regard was a talent for bold and
refreshingly concise writing, the ability to break down complex issues
into neat bulleted-point formulas that provided the illusion of almost
mathematical simplicity. He was a master of the PowerPoint presentation
nearly a century before it existed.</p>
<p>One example—there were to be many more in the years just ahead—was an
analysis he composed during his August stopover in Cairo that purported
to chart the various intellectual elements at work in the Middle East.
After first dividing those elements between the “Ancients” and the
“Moderns,” Sykes offered up subcategories. Thus, Class I of the Ancients
were the orthodox (“hard, unyielding, bigoted and fanatical”), while
Class I of the Moderns (“the highest type”) denoted “a person of good
family who has entirely absorbed a Western education,” not to be
confused with the Class II Moderns, who were “the poor, incompetent, or
criminal who have received an inferior European education and whose
minds by circumstances or temperament or both are driven into more
sinister channels than the first class.” Not content to end there, Sykes
proceeded to apply his formula to various regions of the Middle East,
offering his British readers an easy-to-follow guide to their nation’s
standing in each. It was not a pretty picture in a place like Egypt,
frankly: from the Class I, II, and III Ancients, absolute hostility,
benevolent apathy, and mild approval, respectively, joined to
constitutional opposition and unforgiving enmity among the Class I and
II Moderns.</p>
<p>It certainly wasn’t the first time such silly racialist formulas had
been put to paper, but it spoke volumes to the British leadership’s own
smugness—as well, no doubt, to their perpetually harried states in
grappling with a conflict that spanned the globe—that such drivel, well
organized and confidently stated, took on the flavor of wisdom. Upon
Sykes’s return to London and a bravura performance before the de Bunsen
Committee, the British government would essentially hand off to the
thirty-six-year-old Amateur one of the thorniest—and from a historical
standpoint, most profoundly important—assignments of World War I:
sorting out the competing territorial claims of Great Britain and her
allies in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Only belatedly would British leaders recognize another aspect of
Sykes’s character, one that might have given them pause had they spotted
it earlier. Perhaps to be expected given his frenetic pace and catholic
range of interests, Mark Sykes had a very hard time keeping his facts,
even his own beliefs, straight. Impressed by the last person he had
spoken with, or the last idea that had popped into his fecund mind, he
was forever contradicting positions or policies he had advocated
earlier—often mere days earlier.</p>
<p>Lawrence began to get a glimmer of this in the time he spent around
Sykes during that November stopover. There was something altogether
disquieting about the cavalier way the young MP disregarded inconvenient
evidence that didn’t fit his currently held view, often only to seize on
that same evidence when his opinion changed. As Lawrence would later
write in Seven Pillars, Sykes was “the imaginative advocate of
unconvincing world movements … a bundle of prejudices, intuitions,
half-sciences. His ideas were of the outside, and he lacked patience to
test his materials before choosing his style of building. He would take
an aspect of the truth, detach it from its circumstances, inflate it,
twist and model it.”</p>
<p>But there was yet another side to Sykes’s personality that boded ill
for the crucial role he was about to assume. It seems the man was
something of a sneak. Whether due to a need to prove he was always the
cleverest person in the room, or a con man’s desire to get one over
simply for the sport of it, the young Amateur would make an art form out
of bending the truth to suit his needs, of playing one side against
another by withholding or manipulating crucial information. The result
would be a most peculiar place in history for Mark Sykes: it’s hard to
think of any figure who, with no true malice intended and neither a
nation nor an army at his disposal, was to wreak more havoc on the
twentieth century than the personable and brilliant young aristocrat
from Yorkshire, havoc that a small group of his countrymen, including T.
E. Lawrence, would try very hard to set right.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to suggest that Sykes uniquely possessed these traits.
Indeed, when it came to duplicity, the Amateur had a lot of very
accomplished competitors in the Middle East just then.</p>
<p>AT THE SAME time that Sykes was holding court in Cairo, an enigmatic
robed figure was circulating through the bazaars and teahouses of a
number of towns in western Syria. He was an exceedingly soft-spoken man
in his midthirties, well-off and cultured, judging by the quality of his
dress and classic Arabic diction. Because of his pale complexion and
blue eyes, most who encountered him probably took the traveler for a
Circassian, that ancient mountain people originally from the Black Sea
region, many of whom have almost Nordic features. This was a
misconception Curt Prüfer likely made no effort to correct. He was
conducting this clandestine mission at the behest of Djemal Pasha. Its
purpose was to find out where the real sympathies of the people of Syria
lay.</p>
<p>By that autumn, the need for an unbiased assessment of Syrian public
opinion was becoming acute both for the governor and his German
advisors. With the Allied misadventure in Gallipoli showing signs of
winding down, there was once again the threat of an enemy landing
somewhere on the Syrian coast. If the Allies put ashore in Lebanon, how
would the Lebanese Christians and the Druze religious minority respond?
And what of the Jews, centered just below in Palestine? With the
persecution of the Armenians in Anatolia continuing unabated, surely
many in Syria’s Jewish community were worried they might be next. Above
all, what of the Arabs? Djemal Pasha had already begun to move against
the Arab conspirators unmasked in the French consulate documents, and
Emir Hussein in Mecca was a continuing source of concern, but what of
the great masses of Arabs elsewhere?</p>
<p>For five weeks, and assuming a variety of personas and disguises,
Prüfer wandered Syria. Along the way he talked with Jewish colonists,
Arab shopkeepers, and Christian landowners, with westernized aristocrats
and Bedouin sheikhs and fellaheen. By early December 1915, the German
spy felt he’d sufficiently taken the nation’s pulse to report his
findings to Djemal and the German embassy in Constantinople.</p>
<p>In brief, he had found the greatest discontent among the Christians,
nearly all of whom, he believed, secretly sympathized with the Entente
powers. But Prüfer saw little real danger here, both because of the
Syrian Christians’ comparatively small numbers and because their
“aptitude for treason” was surpassed by a “cowardice that prevents them
from trying to realize their dreams.”</p>
<p>Of somewhat greater concern, in his estimation, was the Jewish
population, and specifically of that subgroup among them known as the
Zionists. While “official Zionism says it only wants to create in
Palestine a center for Jewish language and civilization, and is not at
all interested in politics,” Prüfer wrote, this was clearly not true.
Rather, their ultimate aim was to create an autonomous Jewish state in
Palestine, a goal far more likely to be achieved by an Entente victory
than a Central Powers one. Still, and for much the same reasons as with
the Christians, Prüfer saw little cause for alarm: “Being by nature
cowardly and without initiative, the Jews will not dare to commit
subversive acts unless an armed enemy force was already in the
country.”</p>
<p>Most heartening was what the German spy had discerned in the Arab
Muslim community, by far the largest of the three. Partly due to the
“fair and severe” measures Djemal had already conducted against those
Arab leaders suspected of secessionist leanings, Prüfer found the Arab
independence movement in a greatly weakened state. “Among the middle
classes, reformism has barely any supporters,” he wrote, “and among the
small landowners, merchants and workers, who constitute the bulk of the
population, the government and its cause seems to be popular.” Even if
an Arab uprising was somehow launched, Prüfer suggested in his usual
trenchant way, it would receive little mass support “due to the
frivolousness of the population.”</p>
<p>This generally rosy assessment came with a major caveat, however; if
the British did put ashore in Syria, latent sympathies would come to the
fore. In that eventuality, the invaders could certainly find willing
local collaborators. Prüfer provided Djemal with a long list of the
names of “unreliables,” mostly prominent Christian and Muslim Arab
businessmen, as well as “all Zionist party chiefs,” who should be
immediately sent into internal exile in the case of an Allied
landing.</p>
<p>This last suggestion triggered alarm within the German embassy. Just
that August, Djemal had made use of the documents seized from the French
consulate in Beirut to execute eleven prominent Arab leaders in one of
the city’s main squares. That event had stirred outrage in the Arab
world, and Germany certainly didn’t need one of its own intelligence
officers providing the Syrian governor with more names for his hit list.
In forwarding the report to the foreign ministry in Berlin, the German
ambassador in Constantinople noted that he’d given Prüfer the following
warning: “At the slightest indiscretion, the population could raise the
charge that we are causing rigorous measures, like expulsions. In the
future, please couch your suggestions to Djemal of this nature with
cautious restraint.”</p>
<p>That admonition may have come too late. With Prüfer’s report already
in hand, the Syrian governor seemed to conclude that his flexible
approach to problem-solving—alternating between the rose and the dagger
without readily discernible pattern—was the best way to outwit his
growing list of enemies. On December 18, he had ordered a much larger
roundup of those implicated in the French consulate files, a dragnet
ultimately ensnaring some sixty members of the Arab intelligentsia of
Beirut and Damascus.</p>
<p>Perhaps those arrests put Djemal in a happier mood, for he showed far
greater magnanimity when another man of increasingly questionable
loyalty, Aaron Aaronsohn, came calling at his Damascus office in
January.</p>
<p>THE SPY SHIP NEVER came.</p>
<p>On the moonless night of November 8, 1915, Absalom Feinberg had
finally been slipped back ashore at Athlit from a British spy ship, and
had immediately given an ecstatic Aaron Aaronsohn the good news: he’d
made contact, the British eagerly awaited whatever intelligence they
could pass on, and arrangements were now in place to make that
happen.</p>
<p>With the spy ship scheduled to return in two weeks, the two men
immediately set out on long-range reconnaissance missions to update
their information, Aaronsohn heading north, Feinberg to the south. Under
the guise of conducting scientific surveys for the agricultural research
station, they surreptitiously noted the location of new Turkish army
camps and supply depots and trenchworks, tracked the movements of trains
and troop formations, meticulously jotted down in tiny script in their
notebooks most anything they thought might be useful to the British.</p>
<p>But when they returned to Athlit and waited on the appointed night,
the spy ship didn’t come, nor on the next night, or the one after. As
their wait dragged into early December, Aaronsohn and Feinberg grew
increasingly puzzled, and then anxious; obviously, something somewhere
had gone wrong, but the longer their wait extended, the more likely
their nocturnal activities would come to the attention of the Turkish
militia’s night patrols. On the other hand, if they relaxed their vigil
and missed the boat’s appearance, the British might conclude that the
conspirators had backed out or been caught and simply give up.</p>
<p>Despairing of the spy ship ever showing, by December 8, the impetuous
Feinberg had come up with a new plan: he would reestablish contact by
somehow maneuvering his way past the Turkish armies massed in southern
Palestine, then cross over the Sinai no-man’s-land to the British lines
at the far end. If stopped by a Turkish patrol, he would claim to be
doing fieldwork on locusts. That alibi had the benefit of credence. Just
days earlier, a great new swarm of locusts had appeared over Judea, the
first since the previous spring, and Aaronsohn had determined they were
coming from Egypt over the Sinai land bridge. It still seemed a terribly
risky venture, but, consumed by his own anxieties over reaching the
British, Aaronsohn relented; Feinberg set out for the south that very
night.</p>
<p>Soon after there came anxiety of a very different sort. In
Constantinople, Aaronsohn’s younger sister Sarah had for some time been
looking for a way to escape her unhappy marriage and return to her
family in Palestine. In mid-November, with her husband away on an
extended business trip, she found her opening upon hearing that a Jewish
relief official would soon be departing Constantinople for a tour of the
Jewish colonies. Pleading to be taken along, on November 26, the
twenty-five-year-old Sarah boarded a train at Haidar Pasha station and
set off on the long journey home.</p>
<p>Dark rumors had abounded for months of what was happening to the
Armenians in the Anatolian countryside, but the combination of poor
communications and rigorous censorship had enabled the Ottoman regime to
conceal the extent of the brutality from the general population to a
fairly remarkable degree. This didn’t apply, of course, to anyone whose
travels took them through the killing fields. By the time Sarah
Aaronsohn was reunited with her brother in Palestine on December 16, she
was in a state of shock over what she had witnessed during her journey.
The agronomist would later recount that “she saw the bodies of hundreds
of Armenian men, women and children lying on both sides of the railway.
Sometimes Turkish women were seen searching the corpses for anything
that might be of value; at other times dogs were observed feeding on the
bodies. There were hundreds of bleached skeletons.” In the grisliest
incident, Sarah claimed she had watched as her train was besieged by
thousands of starving Armenians at one remote station; in the stampede,
dozens fell beneath the wheels of the train, much to the delight of its
conductor. Sarah fainted away at the spectacle, only to be remonstrated
by two Turkish officers when she came to for her evident lack of
patriotism.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn had long heard the Armenian horror stories on his own
travels, but had tended to discount them as part of the eternal Syrian
rumor mill. To have them confirmed by his sister—and to learn the
slaughter was ongoing—made it all hideously real. It also led the
agronomist inexorably to a grim question: who next? If the Young Turks
could perpetrate this atrocity against the nation’s two million
Armenians, how much easier to do the same to its eighty thousand
Jews?</p>
<p>Then came more bad news. In the Sinai, Absalom Feinberg had been
stopped by a Turkish army patrol not at all impressed by his locust
fieldwork cover story. Instead, they had hauled him back to Beersheva
under suspicion of being a spy. In early January, he was transferred to
the prison in Jerusalem to await possible trial; if found guilty of the
worst potential charge against him, that of treason, Feinberg would
undoubtedly have a quick appointment with the gibbet-gallows.</p>
<p>It was out of concern for his coconspirator’s life that brought Aaron
Aaronsohn to Djemal Pasha’s Damascus office on the afternoon of January
12. Sensing that appeals for mercy or protestations of innocence may not
work in this case, the agronomist turned to the same instrument that had
failed Feinberg: locusts. To combat the new infestation, he told Djemal,
he would return to his post as inspector general of the locust
eradication program, the position he had finally left in disgust over
government interference eight months before. The one precondition,
however, was that Aaronsohn have the services of his most valuable and
important assistant, a young man named Absalom Feinberg recently caught
up in some misunderstanding in the Sinai.</p>
<p>On Djemal’s order, Feinberg was swiftly released from his Jerusalem
jail. Any euphoria the two would-be spies may have felt was undoubtedly
tempered, however: their long and fruitless campaign to reach the
British remained stalled.</p>
<p>NO ONE GRASPED the whole picture. Given the chaos of war and the
difficulty of communications, different branches of the British
government negotiated with different wartime allies—or with parties they
hoped to turn into allies—with no one realizing until too late that the
agreements thus forged might conflict with one another. It was not a
matter of duplicity, but rather a regrettable instance of the right hand
not knowing what the left was doing.</p>
<p>This is one commonly held view of historians looking at the tangle of
secret agreements that the British entered into regarding the Middle
East in 1915 and 1916. A second, minority view holds that there was
really no tangle at all, and entire books, enough to fill a great
groaning bookshelf, have been devoted to teasing out the carefully
chosen modifiers and conditionals placed within these various agreements
to absolve their crafters of any charge of bad faith.</p>
<p>In truth, the first view is a fiction, and the second merely squalid,
akin to arguing that a promise wasn’t a promise because one’s fingers
were crossed. To the degree that the British right hand didn’t know what
the left was doing, it was because a select group of men at the highest
reaches of its government went to great lengths to ensure it. To that
end, they created a labyrinth of information firewalls—deceptions, in a
less charitable assessment—to make sure that crucial knowledge was
withheld from Britain’s wartime allies and even from many of her own
seniormost diplomats and military commanders.</p>
<p>Somewhat ironically, one of the first entities to come in for this
treatment was the British Empire’s own “jewel in the crown,” British
India.</p>
<p>By the beginning of the twentieth century, the British Empire had
devolved into a unique kind of colonial solar system, a galaxy in which
its principal satellites operated with increasing autonomy from the
central “star” of Britain. Nowhere was this truer than in India, where
the British administration in Simla (as the British government of India
was commonly referred to, even though Simla was only its summer capital)
pursued its own domestic agenda and, to a remarkable degree, even its
own foreign policy.</p>
<p>But if British India maintained an aloof relationship with London, it
had a downright frosty one with British Egypt, especially after it was
informed of the negotiations between Cairo and Emir Hussein in 1915.
Ever since the creation of the Indian Raj in 1858, the Arabian Peninsula
had been recognized as falling within India’s sphere of influence, and
its administrators were loath to accept either the intrusions or
opinions of Egypt, that Johnny-come-lately to the scene. More to the
point, the largest Muslim population in the world, some eighty million
souls, was to be found in India, a number that dwarfed the Muslim
population of the Ottoman Empire by a factor of four. As Simla officials
pointed out to London, it seemed a very dangerous game to encourage
native revolt with promises of autonomy or independence in one part of
the Muslim world while ruthlessly quashing any hint of Muslim rebellion
born of those same desires in another—as British India had been doing
for decades.</p>
<p>For that reason, when Cairo’s negotiations with Emir Hussein reached
a critical phase in the autumn of 1915, Simla had launched a fierce
counterattack in London, denouncing the secret talks at every turn—so
fierce, in fact, that by late October, when officials in London and
Cairo were scrambling to fashion a suitable response to Hussein’s
extravagant demands, Lord Kitchener’s solution was to simply cut India
out of the conversation. It wasn’t until a reply had already been sent
acceding to most all of Hussein’s demands that the viceroy of India was
first told of the startling development and given the feeble excuse
that, in the press of events, there just hadn’t been time to consult
him.</p>
<p>With India thus frozen out of the equation, Emir Hussein had cut a
very good deal for himself—or so he thought. In his crucial October 24
letter, the British high commissioner to Egypt, Henry McMahon, declared
that, subject to certain modifications, “Great Britain is prepared to
recognize and support the independence of the Arabs in all the regions
within the limits demanded by the Sherif of Mecca.” While the two men
continued to haggle over those proposed modifications in subsequent
letters—the most contentious were British demands for “special
administrative arrangements” in the oil-rich Iraqi districts of Baghdad
and Basra, and for the exclusion of the northwestern corner of
Syria—Emir Hussein had every reason to believe that a great independent
Arab nation had been promised, one encompassing nearly the entire
Arabian Peninsula and stretching east to the frontier with Persia, north
to the Anatolian heartland of Turkey, and west to the Mediterranean Sea
and the border of Egypt.</p>
<p>But Hussein might have wanted to pay closer attention to a
conditional clause McMahon had unobtrusively inserted into his letter,
the caveat that these pledges only applied “wherein Great Britain is
free to act without detriment to the interest of her ally, France.” In
other words, if the French had a problem with some aspect of the deal,
their resistance might override British acceptance.</p>
<p>That the French were likely to have such a problem, the British knew
only too well. The previous summer, the French ambassador to Great
Britain had spelled out to Foreign Secretary Grey precisely what
territory his nation intended to grab in the Middle East. This included
all of greater Syria, or the most valuable lands now promised to
Hussein.</p>
<p>How to get around such a dilemma? By simply not telling the French of
the deal struck with Hussein. Instead, in late November, French
diplomats were invited to London to discuss their desiderata for the
Near East. With remarkable disingenuousness, British officials expressed
surprise when the French reiterated that they wanted pretty much the
whole thing: Lebanon, Palestine, the Syrian interior, Iraq. Thus the
stage was set for one of the strangest—and with the advantage of
hindsight, most destructive—diplomatic accords ever penned: the
Sykes-Picot Agreement.</p>
<p>In just a few days of meetings in early January 1916, two midlevel
diplomats, Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot—by coincidence, the
same man who as French consul in Beirut had carried on a secret
correspondence with Arab dissidents and had left those documents behind
to be discovered by Djemal Pasha’s secret police—cobbled together a
future map of the Middle East that bore absolutely no relation to the
one envisioned by Emir Hussein. Instead, French imperial avarice fueled
British imperial competition, so that the truly independent Arab nation
was now to be largely limited to the desert wastelands of Arabia, with
the French taking direct control of greater Syria, and the British
taking outright all of Iraq. In addition, two great swatches of the
interior, essentially everything north and inland of Hussein’s kingdom
of the Hejaz, would be indirectly controlled, quasi-independent but with
Britain and France holding “priority of right of enterprise.” It was in
these so-called Zone A and B enclaves where the negotiators’ cynicism
was most naked; since neither Sykes nor Picot believed the Arabs were
truly capable of governing themselves, they could pledge independence
for these enclaves secure in the knowledge that they would end up as
British and French vassal states. In their spare time, the two diplomats
even came up with a new designation for Palestine. Rather than be part
of the future Arab nation—its technical default status since McMahon had
never mentioned Palestine in any of his proposed modifications with
Hussein—it was now to fall under the joint administration of France,
Great Britain, and Russia.</p>
<p>In Picot’s defense, he couldn’t have known how much his territorial
demands conflicted with those of Emir Hussein. That’s because his
British counterpart never chose to tell him. As incredible as it might
seem, during those crucial days of early January 1916 when much of the
future map of the Middle East was being drawn, there was just one person
in the world who knew the full details of both the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence and the emerging Sykes-Picot compact, and who might have
grasped the extent to which Arab, French, and British goals in the
region had now been set on a collision course: Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>But if Sykes did grasp this, he wasn’t saying. To the contrary, his
accord with Picot meant new firewalls now had to be erected, to keep in
the dark not only Emir Hussein but also all those British officials in
Egypt who were aware of the agreement with him and still ascribed to the
old-fashioned notion that a nation should abide by its promises. Just as
British India had been frozen out in the autumn of 1915, so now British
Egypt would be frozen out in the spring of 1916 as the Sykes-Picot
Agreement was debated in Entente capitals. To Cairo’s repeated queries
on the status of the Anglo-French negotiations, Sykes and other London
officials only allowed that they were ongoing, and that certainly Egypt
would be closely consulted before any final agreement was reached.
Instead, it would be May 1916 before anyone in Cairo saw a copy of
Sykes-Picot, and by then it was a fait accompli, a secret pact agreed to
by the cabinets of Britain, France, and Russia. As T. E. Lawrence would
recall, the reaction among the stunned Cairo military intelligence staff
upon finally reading the agreement had been a collective urge to
vomit.</p>
<p>But for Lawrence in the winter of 1916, all of this lay in the
future. Behind his desk at the Savoy Hotel, he continued his
“bottle-washing” and mapmaking and “paper-combat.”</p>
<p>In this last sphere, his efforts had taken on a tinge of the absurd.
At least in the past, his bureaucratic battles had been waged against
the perfidious French; now they were being fought against the continuing
intrigues of his own countrymen in British India. Apparently operating
on the premise that until Emir Hussein actually launched his revolt the
pact made with him might be scuttled, Simla was engaged in a relentless
effort in London to that end, warning of both Hussein’s unsuitability
and of the disaster to come if a unified Arab nation was encouraged to
form (a fear that obviously would have been eased had Simla known about
Sykes-Picot, which they didn’t). What made this ongoing campaign
somewhat curious in Lawrence’s view was that by the winter of 1916,
India seemed to have rather enough problems in its own immediate sphere
to worry about.</p>
<p>At least back in the autumn, Simla had been in a position to argue
that it was they, and not British Egypt, who’d actually achieved
something against the Ottoman Empire. Building on the ease with which
they’d seized the petroleum fields of southern Iraq, in April 1915 the
commander of the Indian Expeditionary Force (IEF) had sent a force of
twenty thousand men up the Tigris River. Disdaining to form alliances
with any of the local Arab tribes, let alone prattle on about autonomy
or independence, General Charles Townshend had led his army to success
after success in time-honored British military tradition—sallying forth
to thrash whoever might stand in their way—so that by October his force
stood at the gates of Baghdad. In light of this, Simla’s straight-ahead
approach to war-making appeared to have much to recommend it over the
exotic and incendiary hearts-and-minds notions wafting out of Cairo.</p>
<p>But a great deal had changed in the interim. Rather than a triumphant
entry into Baghdad, Townshend’s army had been fought to a bloody
stalemate on the city’s outskirts in late November. Far advanced from
his supply lines and with no prospect of quick reinforcement, Townshend
had then made a strategic withdrawal one hundred miles down the Tigris
to the riverfront town of Kut. By February 1916, the garrison in Kut was
reportedly under a deepening siege—British India seemed in no hurry to
provide a lot of details—even as a relief column battled its way up the
Tigris to come to its aid.</p>
<p>Still, Simla’s whisper campaign against Cairo and its embrace of
Hussein had continued. In late January, Lawrence wrote a long report,
“Politics of Mecca,” designed to allay concerns back in London—concerns
feverishly stoked by India—of what a unified Arab nation under Hussein’s
leadership might mean to Britain’s long-term interests in the region.
Perhaps tailoring his message to what the British leadership wanted to
hear, Lawrence opined that the notion of such a monolith was
far-fetched, that “if properly handled [the Arabs] would remain in a
state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities
incapable of cohesion.”</p>
<p>The following month, India appeared to try the opposite tack of
belittling Hussein. They did so by inserting into the Intelligence
Bulletin for the Middle East, a highly classified digest of information
restricted to top-ranking military and civilian officials, an interview
with a man named Abdul Aziz ibn-Saud. A tribal chieftain from the
northeastern corner of Arabia, ibn-Saud called Hussein “essentially a
trivial and unstable character,” and made it clear that neither he nor
most other Arabian tribal chieftains would ever accede to his
leadership. Even if Hussein took the risky step of declaring himself
caliph, the supreme religious-political figure in the Islamic world,
ibn-Saud argued, it “would not make any difference to his status among
other Chiefs and there would be no question of their accepting any
control from him, any more than they do now.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence, that interview represented a new, and potentially very
dangerous, escalation in the competition between Cairo and Simla. That’s
because Abdul Aziz ibn-Saud was not just another tribal malcontent bent
on retaining his autonomy, but Hussein’s most formidable rival in all of
Arabia. Having embraced an extremely austere form of fundamentalist
Islam known as Wahhabism, over the previous fifteen years ibn-Saud had
led his desert warriors into battle against one recalcitrant Arab tribe
after another with a kind of evangelical zeal. The discipline of the
Wahhabists was legendary; in that time, ibn-Saud’s reach had expanded
from a small string of oasis villages in the Riyadh region to cover a
vast expanse of northeastern Arabia. Meanwhile, Ibn-Saud was also
British India’s man in Arabia, with a close relationship going back to
before the war.</p>
<p>It was bad enough, in Lawrence’s estimation, that Simla was using the
Intelligence Bulletin to promote a man with views so antithetical to
British values, but the gambit also underscored a situation almost
laughably absurd had it not been so perilous: in their battle for
primacy over Arabian policy, two different branches of the British crown
were backing two sworn rivals. Surely that was less a recipe for a
successful Arab revolt than for civil war—which of course may have been
Simla’s true goal all along.</p>
<p>In his riposte to the ibn-Saud interview, similarly disseminated to
the upper reaches of the British government, Lawrence argued that
despite posing as Islamic reformists “with all the narrow minded bigotry
of the puritan,” ibn-Saud and his Wahhabists were hardly representative
of Islam. Instead, as he warned in “The Politics of Mecca,” the
Wahhabist sect was composed of marginal medievalists, “and if it
prevailed, we would have in place of the tolerant, rather comfortable
Islam of Mecca and Damascus, the fanaticism of Nejd … intensified and
swollen by success.”</p>
<p>As with many of Lawrence’s other predictions, his warning about
ibn-Saud and the Wahhabists was ultimately to prove true. In 1923, ibn-
Saud would conquer much of the Arabian Peninsula and, to honor his clan,
give it the name Saudi Arabia. For the next ninety years, the vast and
profligate Saudi royal family would survive by essentially buying off
the doctrinaire Wahhabists who had brought them to power, financially
subsidizing their activities so long as their disciples directed their
jihadist efforts abroad. The most famous product of this arrangement was
to be a man named Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Far more immediately, however, Lawrence was to see his war-of-words
campaign against British India sidelined by more pressing matters. That
March, he was selected for a mission so clandestine, and so assaultive
to British notions of honor, that its true nature would be largely
expunged from the history books. In a nice touch of irony, it was a
mission made necessary by a catastrophe of British India’s creation, a
series of events that reached an ugly denouement in the early morning
hours of March 8, 1916.</p>
<p>AT ABOUT 6:30 on that morning, Lieutenant General Fenton Aylmer, the
future 13th Baronet of Donadea, received some startling news. In his
army’s nighttime march on the town of Dujaila in central Iraq, the 36th
Indian Infantry Brigade had become disoriented in the dark. Rather than
stop at their preassigned forward position to wait out the dawn
artillery bombardment of the enemy, segments of the brigade had
continued on across the barren Dujaila plain and directly into the
Turks’ forward line. More specifically, they had stumbled squarely up
the approaches to “the Citadel,” a forty-foot-high earthen fortress that
commanded the surrounding flatlands and formed the strongpoint of the
Turkish defenseworks.</p>
<p>It sounded like a blueprint for slaughter, but it hadn’t quite played
out that way. The runner who appeared at Aylmer’s headquarters that
morning reported that, by all appearances, the fortress was either
deserted or manned by a tiny skeleton guard; the 36th Indian Infantry
Brigade was at the gates of the Citadel, and it was theirs for the
taking.</p>
<p>It was the pivotal moment in Aylmer’s long and bloody campaign to
relieve General Townshend’s army in Kut, now just eight miles farther up
the Tigris River. With the astounding report out of the Citadel, here
was not only the chance to win the battle of Dujaila before it had
properly begun, but to begin to atone for the colossal missteps that had
characterized Aylmer’s advance over the previous two months.</p>
<p>By March 1916, the various armies of Europe had devised a simple rote
method for attacking their entrenched foes: a sustained artillery
bombardment of the enemy’s forward defenses, one that might last a few
hours or several days depending on the scale of the planned assault,
followed by an infantry rush across no-man’s-land. The problems with
these tactics were manifest at every step. Most such bombardments caused
relatively few casualties, since the defenders simply retreated to back
trenches—or, in the more sophisticated trenchworks of the Western Front,
into heavily protected underground bunkers—to await their conclusion.
Naturally, these preliminary barrages also alerted the defenders both
that an assault was coming and its precise location.</p>
<p>Once the shelling ceased, the attacking infantry units climbed out of
their forward staging trenches to begin their advance across
no-man’s-land. Unfortunately for them, the end of the artillery barrage
also cued the defenders that the ground assault was now under way,
enabling them to quickly return to their own forward trenches and mow
down the exposed attackers as they approached. In just this way, by
early 1916, men had died by the hundreds of thousands in trenchworks
across the breadth of Europe.</p>
<p>Despite the failure of these tactics across a wide spectrum of
Europe’s varied topography, Lieutenant General Aylmer had apparently
seen no means to improve upon them on the flat and featureless landscape
of central Iraq. It also seemed to escape him that it was these same
ruinous tactics, employed by General Townshend in his effort to take
Baghdad, that were necessitating his rescue mission in the first place.
In the two months since he had set off for Kut with some twenty thousand
British and Indian troops, Aylmer had three times hurled his men in
frontal assaults over bare ground against the entrenched Turks. Each
time, the British Indian army had eventually carried the field, if only
through sheer numerical dominance—they outnumbered the Turks by at least
two to one—and only at astounding cost; in the first two weeks, the
relief force had suffered some ten thousand casualties, or half its
strength.</p>
<p>This was no cause for undue alarm among senior commanders downstream,
apparently, for they soon began shuttling some fifteen thousand more men
up to Aylmer for a second push. By early March, this replenished force
had advanced upriver until it came to the Turkish trenchline in Dujaila,
the last obstacle standing between the rescuers and Kut just beyond.
Having learned at least a little from his earlier battles, Aylmer had
decided on a night march to the very edge of the Turks’ artillery range
in Dujaila, a quick sunrise bombardment, and then a dash for the Citadel
that dominated the pancake-flat plain. It was shortly before dawn, while
his guns were being silently unlimbered into place for the coming
barrage, that he learned of the 36th Indian’s remarkable news.</p>
<p>But Fenton Aylmer was clearly not a man who liked surprises, even
good ones. After hastily conferring with his senior commanders, it was
decided that the preemptive capture of the Turkish stronghold posed too
great a departure from the battle plans already worked out to be
adequately supported. The 36th Indian was ordered away from the Citadel
and back to the main British line; from there, they could recross the
plain and seize the fortress once the opening artillery bombardment had
been completed.</p>
<p>When finally the British bombardment commenced—not at dawn as
planned, but at 8 a.m.—all element of surprise had been lost, the
Dujaila Citadel hurriedly manned by Turkish troops ferried over from
across the river. It was another hour before the British frontal assault
began. Very quickly, another four thousand imperial troops had fallen in
no-man’s-land, without a single one reaching the Citadel.</p>
<p>That engagement at Dujaila represented the last best chance the
British had to save their besieged army in Kut. Over the previous two
months, they had suffered fourteen thousand casualties trying to rescue
an army of twelve thousand—and they weren’t quite done yet. For his
efforts, Fenton Aylmer was quietly relieved of command three days after
Dujaila and shuffled off to a back-base job. Perhaps in recognition of
his uneven achievements in Iraq, as well as his attempted cover‑up of
the Citadel fiasco—his official battle report would make no mention of
the 36th Indian’s report—his knighthood would be delayed until 1922.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Dujaila debacle, and in light of the dire
situation facing Townshend’s army at Kut—reports indicated the garrison
would run out of food by mid-April—Lord Kitchener set to hatching a
desperate scheme. In its pursuit, on the morning of March 22, 1916, the
passenger ship Royal George slipped from its berth at Port Suez and
turned south into the Red Sea, embarking on a fourteen-day journey
around the Arabian Peninsula to southern Iraq. On board was T. E.
Lawrence. He carried with him a letter of introduction from High
Commissioner Henry McMahon to Sir Percy Cox, British India’s chief
political officer in Iraq.</p>
<p>“My dear Cox,” the letter read, “I send these few lines to introduce
Captain Lawrence who is starting today for Mesopotamia under orders from
the W.O. [War Office] to give his services in regards to Arab matters.
He is one of the best of our very able intelligence staff here and has a
thorough knowledge of the Arab question in all its bearings. I feel sure
that you will find him of great use. We are very sorry to lose so
valuable a man from our staff here.</p>
<p>“I hope things are going well on your side. We are anxiously awaiting
news of Townshend’s relief but have heard nothing for ages.”</p>
<p>The purpose of Lawrence’s mission was actually twofold, one overt,
the other very much veiled. In view of the ongoing crisis at Kut,
Kitchener and his allies in the Egyptian intelligence staff hoped the
British Indian commanders in Iraq might finally see the wisdom of trying
to work with the indigenous Arab tribes that should have been their
natural allies all along. The plan was to start sending out a group of
Iraqi Arab officers who had defected from the Turks and were now working
for the British in Egypt, so that they might forge alliances with local
Iraqi tribal leaders, as well as peel away disgruntled Arab units of the
Ottoman army.</p>
<p>It was hard to imagine how any of this could be done in time to save
Townshend, however, and this gave rise to the second purpose of
Lawrence’s mission. Under orders from Kitchener himself, an attempt was
to be made to bribe the Turkish commander of the Kut siege into letting
Townshend’s army go in return for one million English pounds’ worth of
gold.</p>
<p>If Lawrence resented being the bearer of this shameful instruction,
almost without precedent in British military history, he never let on.
Then again, he’d very recently been given two reminders of the puffery
and hypocrisy of military culture.</p>
<p>A year and a half earlier, he had been magically elevated from
civilian to second lieutenant because a general visiting the General
Staff map room demanded to be briefed by an officer. Now Lawrence’s
superiors in Cairo had abruptly rushed through his temporary promotion
to captain, effective his first day at sea, presumably to spare the very
senior military commanders he would be meeting in Iraq from the
indignity of conferring with a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>A rather more baffling episode had occurred just four days before
he’d boarded the Royal George. On March 18, the small French military
legation in Cairo had been temporarily recalled to France and, in
long-standing military tradition among the European powers, the occasion
was marked by the liberal disbursement of medals and honorifics. Quite
inexplicably, considering his consistent efforts to thwart French
ambitions in the region, the outgoing legation had selected Lawrence for
the Légion d’Honneur, one of France’s highest awards. Compounding their
error, the following year they awarded him the Croix de Guerre avec
palme.</p>
<p>Over the course of his wartime service, Lawrence was awarded a number
of medals and ribbons, but with his profound disdain for such things, he
either threw them away or never bothered to collect them. He made an
exception in the case of the Croix de Guerre; after the war, according
to his brother, he found amusement in placing the medal around the neck
of a friend’s dog and parading it through the streets of Oxford.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of April 5, the Royal George slipped into the bay of
the dreary, low-slung port city of Basra, and a Royal Navy launch was
sent out to collect its most important passenger, the newly minted
Captain T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>As Lawrence soon discovered in Basra, the overt objective of his
mission to Iraq, to coax British Indian commanders into launching a
hearts-and-minds campaign among the local tribes, had already been
mooted. In a series of cables to London while he had been in transit,
the new commander in chief of the Indian Army Expeditionary Force in
Iraq, General Percy Lake, had already dismissed the scheme as
“undesirable and inconvenient.”</p>
<p>But as Lawrence conferred with that leadership during his first days
in Basra, it was clear that another, more insidious element had doomed
his political mission, a toxic fusion of racism and British notions of
military superiority. Despite the fresh example of the disaster at
Gallipoli—maybe even because of it—many senior British commanders simply
couldn’t accept that they might lose to the “rabble” of the Ottoman army
yet again. This attitude wasn’t isolated to the narrow-minded generals
of British India, but extended all the way to the supreme commander of
British forces, General William Robertson, back in London. Upon hearing
of the generous surrender terms offered to Townshend by Khalil Pasha,
the Turkish commander at Kut, after the defeat of Aylmer’s relief
column, Robertson had responded, “My general information is to the
effect that the difficulties of the Turks are serious. I regard Khalil
Bey’s overtures as a confirmation of this and as an indication that,
given determined action on our part, success is assured.”</p>
<p>In other words, in the upside-down worldview that this war against
its military and cultural inferiors had induced in the British high
command, an offer of honorable surrender was only evidence of the
enemy’s weakness, and that two relief efforts had ended in abject
failure meant a third was sure to succeed.</p>
<p>By the time Lawrence was shuttled up the Tigris River to join the
frontline headquarters staff on April 15, this third relief effort was
well under way. After the fiasco at Dujaila, there had been a wholesale
shakeup of that staff, with Aylmer replaced by a certain Major General
George Gorringe. Unfortunately, the changes hadn’t extended to the
tactical playbook. Displaying the same fondness for frontal assaults
against an entrenched enemy as his predecessor, Gorringe neatly
replicated the record of Aylmer’s first relief effort—ten thousand dead
and wounded, no breakthrough—in almost precisely the same two-week
span.</p>
<p>That final failure ended the uncomfortable existence Lawrence had
endured ever since reaching the Snakefly, the British headquarters ship
docked in the Tigris River below Kut. As word had spread among the
officers on board of the clandestine purpose of his mission—to try to
ransom out the Kut garrison—the young captain from Egypt had been
pointedly shunned by most everyone. But now, having suffered some
twenty-three thousand casualties across nine separate engagements
without ever reaching Kut, and with that trapped garrison rapidly
nearing starvation, the generals in charge belatedly accepted that
Kitchener’s scheme was the only option left.</p>
<p>But even at this eleventh hour, there would be time for an element of
farce. Since neither General Townshend nor the commanders hoping to
rescue him wished to have such an ignominious endeavor attached to their
reputations, through the last days of April, Townshend and General Lake
waged a duel of cablegrams, each arguing that the other should carry out
the negotiations. Instead, it would ultimately fall on three junior
officers—Colonel Edward Beach, Captain Aubrey Herbert, and Captain T. E.
Lawrence—to make one last attempt to save the dying men of Kut.</p>
<p>IT HAD ALL the trappings of a Victorian parlor-room melodrama: the
dashing and excessively handsome young nobleman, a requisite coterie of
flirtatious but chaste women, the cold-blooded archvillain, even the
innocent abroad, that out-of-his-depth character who, after various
twists and turns, would provide the story with its moral conclusion.
Where the small expatriate community of wartime Jerusalem differed from
any theatrical counterparts was in the consequences to be paid for
ending up on the wrong side of the narrative: imprisonment, exile, even
execution. What was also different, of course, was the world that lay
beyond those parlor-room windows, not the pleasant English countryside
or a tony London street, but a city consumed by death, its streets and
alleyways littered with those succumbed to starvation or typhus, its
public squares frequently featuring men hanging from gibbet-gallows.</p>
<p>For William Yale, it was an exceedingly strange, fishbowl existence.
With very little to do in the way of work, most every afternoon he met
up to play bridge with an eclectic group of friends—a Greek doctor, an
Armenian doctor, a retired Turkish colonel, and the Greek bishop of
Jerusalem—that diversion giving over in the evenings to larger
gatherings in the salons of various middle-aged expatriate women. At
these soirees, dominated by dancing and the playing of parlor games, a
peculiar sexual dynamic took place. Since there were few single
expatriate women remaining in Jerusalem—and any attention paid to one
could be quickly interpreted as an interest to marry—the single men
flirted, openly and competitively, with the married women in attendance,
often in plain view and with the acquiescence of their husbands. It was
all quite harmless and innocent.</p>
<p>But there was nothing truly harmless in wartime Jerusalem, as Yale
discovered when he became the favorite of Madame Alexis Frey, an
attractive middle-aged French widow who enjoyed the status of grande
dame of the city’s salon scene. Yale’s standing with Frey so rankled one
of his competitors, a middle-aged Christian Arab who headed the Turkish
Tobacco Régie, or monopoly, in Syria, that the man took Yale aside one
day to make a proposal. “How about we divide the ladies of Jerusalem up
between the two of us,” the businessman said. “For myself, I will
reserve Madame Frey, and you can have all the rest.”</p>
<p>Yale initially dismissed the proposition as a joke, but thought
differently when he next went to the Régie office to purchase his
monthly ration of cigarettes, only to be told by the clerks they’d been
instructed to not sell to him. That posed a problem since, true to its
definition, the Régie was the only place tobacco could be obtained in
wartime Jerusalem. Shortly afterward, Yale was informed by the Jerusalem
chief of police that his challenger from the Régie was plotting
intrigues against him.</p>
<p>“I began to realize that I was up against a jealous, unscrupulous
person who would go to great lengths to rid himself of a rival,” Yale
recalled. “As my business demanded that my position should be such that
I be on friendly terms with the Turkish officials and authorities, I saw
I was playing a dangerous game. I decided to let Madame Frey settle the
issue, so I told her to send Monsieur X packing or our affair was
over.”</p>
<p>When Madame Frey explained that that was quite impossible given the
Régie man’s prominence, the American oilman withdrew from the Frey salon
in a huff. Yale’s manservant, a grizzled old Kurd named Mustapha
Kharpoutli, came up with an alternative solution. “Oh Master,” he
counseled Yale, “I know where ‘the pig’ goes every evening, so give the
order and I will finish with him.” As Kharpoutli explained, the Régie
man left a particular woman’s house every night at midnight. “It’s on a
lonely street. I will kill him tonight if you tell me to.”</p>
<p>Yale declined that offer, and shortly after his friends engineered a
brief rapprochement with Alexis Frey. It was a risky business, for the
city’s thicket of martial law edicts afforded almost endless
possibilities for a rival to exact revenge; during Frey’s next
curfew-violating salon, her home was raided and half the attendees
hauled off to jail, presumably after a tip-off from the jealous Régie
man.</p>
<p>The episode served to remind Yale that his life now was like a game
of musical chairs, one with extremely high stakes. The ultimate arbiter
of that game, of course, was Djemal Pasha. On his word, most anyone
could be cast into prison or summarily banished to some distant village
in the Syrian wastelands—if often only to be just as swiftly released or
restored according to Djemal’s whim.</p>
<p>To stay in Djemal’s good graces, or to soften the punishment when
that failed, the foreign community in Jerusalem most often looked to two
men. One was the dashing consul from neutral Spain, Antonio de la
Cierva, Conde de Ballobar, who, having assumed the consular duties of
most all the European “belligerent” nations, was extraordinarily well
informed and influential. William Yale’s relationship with the Conde de
Ballobar was a tricky one: a good ally to have if matters went awry, but
also his most formidable competition when it came to fishing in
Jerusalem’s sparse pool of attractive and available women.</p>
<p>For day-to-day protection, Yale was much more likely to turn to
another pillar of Jerusalem society, a charming middle-aged aristocrat
named Ismail Hakki Bey al-Husseini, one of the three Jerusalem
businessmen from whom Socony had obtained the original Kornub
concessions back in the spring of 1914. Yale had developed a friendship
with Ismail Bey during his extended stay in Palestine prior to the war’s
outbreak. That had quickly resumed upon Yale’s return in 1915, and by
the spring of 1916 the oilman considered Ismail Bey his closest friend
in the Middle East. Of course, it probably didn’t hurt that the
Husseinis were one of the most powerful and well-respected families in
all of southern Syria, Ismail Bey being a particularly prominent
member.</p>
<p>But if the expatriate community had its protectors, it also had its
predators. Of these, none was more dreaded than a young German officer
who flitted in and out of the city with some regularity, Curt Prüfer. As
Count de Ballobar noted of Prüfer, despite “his harmless appearance [he]
is nothing less than a secret agent of the German government,” and “in
possession of an extraordinary talent.” What made Prüfer such a figure
of menace, quite beyond the creepiness factor of his whispery voice, was
that he seemed to be the one German whom Djemal Pasha trusted
implicitly. Run afoul of Curt Prüfer, and even the determined entreaties
of Count de Ballobar or Ismail Hakki Bey might prove useless. Even the
entreaties of Djemal Pasha, in fact. One afternoon, Yale happened to be
visiting an expatriate couple he was friendly with when their front door
was kicked in by Prüfer and two accompanying policemen. While the couple
had claimed to be Swiss, it was an open secret within the foreign
community—and to Djemal Pasha—that they were actually French, a detail
Prüfer had apparently just uncovered. When he demanded the couple be
cast into internal exile, an unhappy Djemal had no choice but to sign
the expulsion order.</p>
<p>Prüfer’s authority became especially worrisome to William Yale in the
winter of 1916 when he discovered that he and the German intelligence
agent were locked in a three-way competition—the third was the
ubiquitous Ballobar—for the same woman, a beautiful Jewish-American girl
living in Jerusalem. Concerned that her American suitor might soon be
arrested, the girl finally confided to Yale that Prüfer frequently
interrogated her about him and his activities. “Clearly I was under
suspicion.”</p>
<p>Surviving in wartime Syria required not only a finely honed
selfishness, but a hardening of the heart. In this, Yale, the consummate
survivor, was not at all immune. Every day for months on end, he had to
step over the bodies of the dead and dying as he traversed Jerusalem.
Every week he heard stories of those who had fallen from favor being
disappeared, either figuratively in the form of banishment or quite
literally in the form of the gibbet-gallows. To protect himself and his
interests in such a place, he became increasingly cold-blooded, too, so
much so that he would eventually turn on his closest friend. To his
later embarrassment, this didn’t stem from matters of personal safety;
William Yale did it for oil.</p>
<p>Prior to his first meeting with Djemal Pasha in the spring of 1915,
Yale had decided to divide Socony’s petition for concessionary rights in
Palestine into two separate requests, figuring that to ask for the
entire half million acres desired at one fell swoop was to invite a
backlash. The problem was that, having long since sewn up the
concessionary rights to the first quarter million acres and done nothing
with them, by the spring of 1916 the oilman had still not mustered the
gall to ask after the second.</p>
<p>What he needed was some kind of opening to alter the playing field,
but just what that might be was hard to imagine—especially since Djemal
had clearly cottoned to Socony’s game. At the beginning of 1916, the
Constantinople office had labored mightily to obtain concessionary
rights to several large tracts around Damascus, going so far as to make
the American consul in that city, Samuel Edelman, their point man in the
effort. In late March, however, after Edelman took the matter up with
“the supreme factor in these regions”—an obvious reference to Djemal—he
cabled back to Socony with some bad news. “[Djemal] says that while
recently in Constantinople, the Minister of Mines said to him [that]
Standard Oil was not working for the benefit or interest of Turkey, but
to shut off competition. So long as this suspicion hangs over you, [it]
will not be possible to obtain further concessions.”</p>
<p>Shortly after that rebuff, however, an opening suddenly presented
itself when Yale was once again summoned to Djemal’s headquarters at the
German Hospice. As the governor explained, he had recently received
reports from military officers in the field of a large pool of oil
collected at the base of a mountain in the southern desert. Since this
oil was already on the surface, Djemal pointed out, it should be an easy
matter to start collecting and refining it at once. As a personal favor,
he wanted Yale to go and investigate the site, a small chain of
mountains below Beersheva known as Kornub.</p>
<p>Yale instantly realized this “find” was the very same one that J. C.
Hill had spotted from a Judean hillside two years earlier, and which he
and Rudolf McGovern had ascertained to be iron tailings. But this seemed
a detail not worth mentioning to Djemal Pasha. Instead, Yale said he
would be happy to investigate the Kornub site, so long as the governor
could see his way to approving a few more concessionary tracts. When he
left the German Hospice that day, the Standard representative had the
pasha’s consent to another quarter million acres of Palestine.</p>
<p>But while preparing for this next concession-procurement expedition
Yale suddenly encountered a problem with his best friend, Ismail Hakki
Bey. During the first great concession-buying expedition of the previous
summer, Ismail Bey had succumbed to Yale’s entreaties to accompany him
on the vague assurance that Socony would compensate him for his
services; even though the businessman had no proprietary interest in
those concessions, he had relented. To be sure, that collaboration was
rooted in more than mere friendship for both men. While Ismail Bey’s
cultured company was a welcome addition to the scrofulous assortment of
soldiers and government functionaries who formed the rest of Yale’s
retinue, the American also looked to his well-connected friend to smooth
out any difficulties that might arise with stubborn landowners or
extortionate local officials. From Ismail Bey’s perspective, with Socony
clearly planning a massive exploration project in Palestine at some
point in the future, it only made good business sense to attach to the
undertaking however he could.</p>
<p>But when approached by Yale in the late spring of 1916 for his help
with the next round of concession-buying, Ismail Bey balked. In the Arab
way of doing business, one’s word was inviolate. Ismail Bey had now seen
enough of the American way to know that Yale’s assurances of
compensation were quite meaningless; what he needed was a written
contract. Confronted by this request, Yale explained that as a mere
purchasing agent for Socony, he hadn’t the authority to pen such a
guarantee, but that if Ismail Bey “wished to know my personal opinion,
it was that he had better have confidence in the Company.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t good enough for Ismail Bey; he informed his friend that
without such a written guarantee, he couldn’t help him.</p>
<p>This placed Yale in a most difficult spot. Over the course of their
two-and-a-half-year friendship, he’d come to know all of Ismail Bey’s
seven children, and had frequently dined in his Jerusalem home. As in
any true friendship, the two had also shared confidences: on Yale’s
part, of the British nurse he had met in Jerusalem before the war and
hoped one day to marry; on Ismail Bey’s part, of his low opinion of the
Ottoman government in general, and his resentment of Djemal Pasha in
particular. Compounding Yale’s difficulty was the very prominence of the
Husseini name in Syria. Since Ismail Bey had relatives scattered in high
government positions throughout the region, a rift between them might
not be a matter of simply parting ways; if the businessman chose to
stand in his way, the same doors that had previously been flung open for
Socony could now be slammed shut.</p>
<p>As Yale recounted in his memoir, “I looked at him and said, ’Well,
Ismail Bey, much as I will dislike doing it, if you do not agree to
cooperate with me, I shall go at once to Djemal Pasha and tell him that
you are blocking me, that you are pro-British and are tied up with
British interests.”</p>
<p>It marked a dramatic transformation in William Yale. In 1911, while
working for a wealthy Bostonian industrialist, Yale had refused the
pleas of his own bankrupted and desperate father for an introduction to
his employer, feeling that trading on his position to arrange such a
meeting would be improper. Just five years later, Yale was threatening
his best friend with probable death—and not an easy death, but likely
one that would only come after protracted torture and after his wives
and children had been cast into a destitute exile—over a business
deal.</p>
<p>But it worked. “I studied his face anxiously as I awaited his
response,” Yale would recall. “Rather abruptly he replied, ‘I’ll assist
you; I’ll trust the Company.’ And he did work loyally with me as long as
I represented the Company in Palestine.”</p>
<p>KHALIL PASHA’S HEADQUARTERS encampment consisted of a single round
tent set some four miles back from the front lines at Kut. It was
midafternoon before the three British officers, having at last completed
their grueling blindfolded journey from no-man’s-land, were ushered
inside.</p>
<p>Khalil was a trim man in his midthirties with piercing brown eyes and
the handlebar mustache favored by Turkish officers—by all Turkish males,
in fact—and despite the desolation of his surroundings, he still
retained something of the dapper manner he had perfected in the salons
of Constantinople. Aubrey Herbert, during his prewar days as an honorary
consul in the Ottoman capital, had come to know Khalil quite well, and
once he and his companions had settled in the tent he tried to break the
ice with some opening pleasantries. “Where was it that I met Your
Excellency last?” Herbert asked in French.</p>
<p>Khalil apparently had a good memory. “At a dance at the British
embassy,” he replied, also in French. From there, though, the
conversation took a far more somber turn.</p>
<p>It was April 29, and the three British officers had set out for this
meeting early that morning, climbing over the forward parapet of a
British trenchline and into no-man’s-land under the cover of a white
flag. Before them stretched six hundred yards of waist-high meadow
grass, at the far end of which rose the earthen berm of the Turks’
trenchworks. Walking to a spot roughly equidistant between the two
lines, they stopped and waited for several hours for some response from
the Turkish side, buffeted both by the steadily rising heat and by the
swarms of blowflies feeding on the rotting corpses that lay all about
them. At last, the three men were taken over to the Turkish line, where
they were blindfolded and put on horses to take them to Khalil’s
headquarters. Having badly hurt his knee in a fall a few days earlier,
Lawrence quickly found that he couldn’t ride; taken off his horse but
still in blindfold, he was led by the hand by a Turkish soldier,
stumbling and limping the four miles to Khalil’s tent.</p>
<p>In stepping out into no-man’s-land that morning, all three men were
acutely aware of the humiliating nature of the task they’d been given.
So dishonorable was this bribery attempt that Edward Beach would never
publicly reveal the mission’s true purpose, Lawrence would only write of
it in the most euphemistic fashion, while Aubrey Herbert couldn’t even
bring himself to commit the words to the anonymity of his private diary;
writing in his journal the previous evening, he noted that the only
items they had to bargain with were “Townshend’s guns, exchange of
Turkish prisoners, and another thing.” Even this ambiguity was
ultimately too revealing; when Herbert’s diary was published after the
war, that clause was excised altogether.</p>
<p>But as the three officers soon learned in Khalil Pasha’s tent, they
actually had even less to bargain with than that. Unbeknownst to them
when they’d set out, early that morning an increasingly unhinged
Townshend had abruptly agreed to an unconditional surrender. Following
military protocol, he then destroyed his remaining pieces of artillery.
This act infuriated Khalil Pasha—he had desperately wanted to get his
hands on those guns—and it left Beach, Herbert, and Lawrence with little
to offer the Turkish commander beyond the gold ransom.</p>
<p>This the British officers couched in terms of a kind of humanitarian
assistance package for the civilian residents of Kut. Surely, they
suggested, those innocents had suffered just as badly as the trapped
British soldiers through the five-month siege, and some form of
financial recompense seemed in order. Khalil Pasha saw through the
artifice at once and airily brushed the proposal away.</p>
<p>The negotiating party fared a bit better in asking for a transfer of
wounded soldiers. With the Kut garrison now surrendered, the Turkish
commander agreed to let British steamers come up with food supplies and
take out the worst wounded. This concession encouraged Colonel Beach,
the senior negotiator, to try his last card: an exchange of able-bodied
prisoners, the survivors in Kut in return for the Ottoman prisoners the
British had taken since first coming ashore in Iraq.</p>
<p>With an arch expression, Khalil offered an alternative arrangement, a
one-for-one exchange of British soldiers for Turkish ones, a separate
exchange for Indian soldiers and Arabs. The British officers weren’t
quite sure what to make of this offer, but when Herbert remarked that
many Arab troops in the enemy army had fought valiantly and Khalil would
be lucky to have them back, the Turkish commander’s manner abruptly
changed. Holding up a list of the POWs held by the British, Khalil
pointed out the preponderance of Arab names. “Perhaps one of our
[Turkish] men in ten is weak or cowardly,” he said, “but it’s only one
in a hundred of the Arabs who are brave.… You can send them back to me
if you like, but I have already condemned them to death. I shall like to
have them to hang.”</p>
<p>Realizing they were being toyed with, the British officers dropped
the matter. A short time later, Khalil Pasha gave an affected yawn and
announced that he was tired, that he still had many other matters to
attend. So ended the last chance to rescue the garrison in Kut. From
Khalil’s headquarters, Lawrence, Herbert, and Beach were escorted back
to the front line but, as darkness had now fallen, were invited to stay
the night inside a Turkish encampment. As Lawrence pointedly wrote in
his diary, “they gave us a most excellent dinner in Turkish style.”</p>
<p>The following morning, the three officers were led down to the
riverbank. In the daylight, they saw one body after another floating by
on the Tigris’s swift current. They were Ottoman soldiers, succumbed to
cholera or typhus or battle wounds, and so indifferent were their
commanders that their bodies had been tossed into the river rather than
buried.</p>
<p>That same day, Townshend formally surrendered his forces at Kut. Both
his army and the relief columns that were slaughtered trying to rescue
it had been composed largely of Indian soldiers, and to whatever degree
racism had contributed to their expendable treatment by their British
commanders, those men were now to suffer even worse at the hands of the
Turks. With most put to work essentially as slave labor on the Baghdad
Railway, of the ten thousand Indian soldiers and camp-followers who went
into captivity at Kut, as few as one-third would live to see the war’s
end.</p>
<p>A happier fate was in store for General Townshend. Taken to
Constantinople, he spent the remainder of the war in a pleasant villa on
an island in the Bosporus, where he was given use of a Turkish naval
yacht and frequently attended diplomatic receptions at the Ottoman
court. Joining him in Constantinople were his three prized Yorkshire
terriers, pets that, despite the near-starvation conditions in Kut, had
weathered the ordeal quite nicely. In a testament to the element of
collegiality that persisted among the imperial ruling classes even in
wartime, a number of Turkish government officials sent Townshend
congratulatory notes on the occasion of his knighthood by King George V
in October 1916.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON A MORNING in early April, a courier on horseback appeared at the
al-Bakri farmstead outside Damascus summoning Faisal Hussein to Djemal
Pasha’s offices in the city. This was hardly out of the ordinary. Faisal
had returned to the Syrian capital at Djemal’s request three months
earlier and had frequent dealings with the governor. When Faisal arrived
at Djemal’s office that morning, however, he found him in a strangely
cool, controlled mood.</p>
<p>After coffee had been served and pleasantries exchanged, Djemal slid
a piece of paper across his desk. It was a telegram from Enver Pasha in
Constantinople, and it concerned a letter the generalissimo had just
received from Faisal’s father in Mecca. It was less a letter than an
ultimatum: if the Young Turks wished to retain his friendship, Hussein
warned, they needed to recognize him as the hereditary ruler of the
Hejaz, and to end the ongoing trial of the five dozen Arab nationalist
leaders in Lebanon.</p>
<p>It placed Faisal in a very dangerous spot. Upon his return to
Damascus in January, he had quickly discovered that the odds for a
successful Arab revolt in Syria had radically diminished since his
earlier visit. Many of the would-be political leaders of such a revolt
had been banished or gone into hiding as a result of Djemal’s purges,
while the military component had been decimated at Gallipoli. While
Faisal had alerted his father to this changed situation, judging by his
petulant telegram, Hussein didn’t grasp just how dire matters stood.</p>
<p>“Effendim,” Djemal recounted Faisal as saying, “you’ve no idea what a
grief this is to me. This telegram is certainly the result of some great
misunderstanding. I can positively assure you that my father means
nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Instead, Faisal attributed the “misunderstanding” to his father’s
difficulty with the Turkish language; obviously, some scribe had
mistranslated his father’s Arabic text and mangled it into something far
different than intended. In Djemal’s office that morning, Faisal offered
to cable his father and, by explaining that his words had been
misconstrued, undoubtedly obtain his immediate renunciation of the
offending letter.</p>
<p>But as tiresome as Djemal Pasha was finding the machinations of
Hussein and his sons, he also rather enjoyed watching Faisal squirm.
Dismissing the young sheikh from his office, he instead composed his own
letter to Emir Hussein. After explaining why he couldn’t possibly
release the Damascus defendants—“a government which pardoned traitors
would be accused of weakness”—Djemal further suggested that with the
nation in a war where its very survival was at stake, this perhaps
wasn’t the best time for Hussein to pursue the business of making his
title hereditary. He then took the gloves off: “I should also draw your
attention to the following aspect of the matter. Let us assume the
Government complied with your demand solely because they wanted to keep
you from being troublesome in the difficult times through which we are
passing. If the war came to a victorious conclusion, who could prevent
the Government from dealing with you with the greatest severity once it
is over?”</p>
<p>However imperfect his knowledge of the Turkish language, Emir Hussein
surely understood the threat in those words. And just in case there was
still any uncertainty, Djemal soon turned his attention to the Lebanon
show-trial defendants. On May 5, and despite Faisal’s continued pleas
for clemency, he signed execution orders for twenty-one of those found
guilty. Early the next morning, the condemned were led into public
squares in Damascus and Beirut and hanged.</p>
<p>In concert with another event, those executions finally brought the
long, tortured dance between the Young Turks and the Hashemite ruler in
Arabia to an end. Just weeks earlier, Djemal Pasha had dispatched a new
force of some thirty-five hundred crack troops to Medina. He had assured
Hussein that the unit was en route to Yemen, at the southwestern corner
of the Arabian Peninsula, but Hussein wasn’t convinced, suspecting they
were really coming for him. In the wake of the May 6 executions, Hussein
decided the time for dithering was over, and sent word to Faisal to get
out of Damascus.</p>
<p>At about the same time that Faisal was preparing to do so, Djemal
Pasha received another supplicant, Aaron Aaronsohn. In the four months
since he had returned to his post as head of the locust eradication
program, the agronomist had been a fairly frequent visitor to the
governor’s Damascus office during his travels through the region. He’d
been happy to be able to report to Djemal that the second wave of
locusts hadn’t spawned, and so posed no threat in the future; even by
late March, their numbers had begun to dwindle. What he hadn’t shared
with the Syrian governor, of course, was that he’d used the cover of his
scientific fieldwork to establish an extensive network of prospective
Jewish spies across Palestine.</p>
<p>Putting that network together had been exceedingly delicate work for
Aaronsohn. Within the Jewish yeshuv, or community, was one faction that
actively supported the Central Powers, another that secretly supported
the Entente, while the vast majority simply wanted to stay out of the
whole mess and hope for the best. What united almost everyone, however,
was staunch opposition to any action that might bring more adverse
Ottoman attention; even for those quietly praying for the British to
come, they would lend their assistance once they were ashore, but to do
anything beforehand was just too dangerous for everyone. Only by very
gingerly sounding out their friends and acquaintances had Aaronsohn and
Feinberg managed to recruit some dozen like-minded members of the
community willing to spy for Great Britain preemptively.</p>
<p>That remained a theoretical enterprise, however. Over the course of
that winter, there had been several sightings of the British spy ships
off the coast of Athlit, and the British had even sent messages ashore,
but through an improbable string of bad luck, contact had never been
made. For Aaron Aaronsohn, it was a maddening predicament. Three times
they’d tried to connect with the British, and three times it had gone
wrong, with the last try nearly resulting in Feinberg’s death. Then, in
the early spring of 1916, he came up with a new idea.</p>
<p>From his travels, Aaronsohn had learned that the Turkish army
suffered from a massive shortage of lubricating oil; indeed, he could
scarcely have not learned it since the earsplitting screech of oilless
axles had become a kind of perpetual background music in Syria. Reading
through a scientific journal one day, the agronomist came upon an
article about a team of European scientists who had devised a method of
converting sesame seed oil into lubricating oil. If there was one thing
the Ottoman Empire had no shortage of it was sesame seeds, and it was
with this proposal—to learn the extraction method from scientists in
Germany and apply it to the Turkish war effort—that Aaronsohn came to
Djemal’s Damascus office one day in May.</p>
<p>Travel anywhere in the Ottoman Empire now required a vesika, or
permit, and one of the few people who could approve the sort of journey
Aaronsohn was proposing was Djemal Pasha himself. The governor was
undoubtedly very suspicious. He didn’t really trust Aaronsohn—or pretty
much any Jew, for that matter—and there had recently been that strange
business of his assistant caught wandering in the Sinai. To let such a
man out of his clutches, even for a visit to an allied nation, was to
take a great chance.</p>
<p>Against this, though, was Djemal’s desperate need for lubricating oil
for his army, a need the Standard Oil Company of New York seemed in no
hurry to fulfill despite the staggering concessions he’d given them in
Syria. In his usual brusque way, the governor quickly granted
Aaronsohn’s vesika for passage to Constantinople; once there, the
scientist would need to clear more bureaucratic hurdles before
continuing on to Berlin. But, of course, Aaronsohn had no intention of
stopping at Berlin. Instead, he hoped to slip across the German frontier
into a neutral country and there make contact with British intelligence;
he just hadn’t figured out that part of the plan yet.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>LAWRENCE SET OUT for the return to Cairo from Iraq aboard a British
troopship on May 11. In the past year, he had lost two brothers to this
conflict that seemed to have no end, and if by mid-1916 the bankruptcy
of the British war effort was everywhere evident, nowhere was it more so
than here on its eastern flank. In just thirteen months, Britain had
suffered some 350,000 casualties at the hands of “the sick man of
Europe,” had failed—and failed totally—where a ragtag collection of
Balkan militias and armed peasants had repeatedly succeeded just three
years earlier. As if that weren’t enough, he was just then returning
from an experience that, on both a personal and historical level, laid
bare that bankruptcy like no other: a futile bid to save the lives of
twelve thousand starving and defeated men, a shameful act of groveling
in which he’d been forced to take part because the generals who had cast
those men to their doom felt it beneath their dignity to do so.</p>
<p>Lawrence would come away from his Iraqi sojourn with two abiding
thoughts. One was of the self-defeating arrogance with which the British
Indian army had blundered into the country: “By brute force they marched
into Basra. The enemy troops in Irak [sic] were nearly all Arabs in the
unenviable predicament of having to fight on behalf of their [Turkish]
secular oppressors against a [British] people long envisaged as
liberators, but who obstinately refused to play the part.” Their already
keen sense of superiority swollen by Basra’s easy capture, the British
Indian commanders had been contemptuous of local support, even of the
need for a defendable supply line, and had instead heedlessly marched
their men up the Tigris to ruin. It may have been with the Iraq debacle
in mind that Lawrence would later remark, “British generals often gave
away in stupidity what they had gained in ignorance.”</p>
<p>On a more philosophical level, what Lawrence took from Kut was a
deepening antipathy for the imperialist cause. As he would write in
Seven Pillars, “We pay for these things too much in honour and in
innocent lives. I went up the Tigris with one hundred Devon
Territorials, young, clean, delightful fellows, full of the power of
happiness and of making women and children glad. By them one saw vividly
how great it was to be their kin, and English. And we were casting them
by the thousands into the fire to the worst of deaths, not to win the
war but that the corn and rice and oil of Mesopotamia might be ours.…
All our subject provinces to me were not worth one dead Englishman.”</p>
<p>Still, Lawrence was determined that it should not have all been in
vain. During his fourteen-day journey back to Egypt, he composed a long
report on all he had been witness to in Iraq, a scathing critique of
everything from the British Indian army’s docking and warehousing
systems, to the inadequacy of its seniormost generals, to the mindless
stupidity of their battlefield strategies. But this, too, was to be an
effort wasted. After reading Lawrence’s incendiary report and learning
it was to be passed on to General Archibald Murray, the overall
commander of British forces in Egypt, senior officers in the Cairo
military intelligence unit decided it was far too indelicate for the
general’s sensibilities; shortly before the report was to be sent to
Murray, they carefully scissored out all of Lawrence’s most inflammatory
passages, thus ensuring that even now the grim lessons of Kut would stay
unlearned. So thoroughly did the censors do their job that it is
believed only one copy of Lawrence’s original Iraq report survived
intact.</p>
<p>FOR ANYONE SEEKING to justify the web of conflicting agreements that
Great Britain had spun for itself in the Middle East by the spring of
1916, there were actually several strong arguments close at hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most obvious is succinctly conveyed in the old maxim that
all is fair in love and war. By May 1916, the war had already killed
millions of young men across Europe, and the future appeared to promise
only more of the same; if double dealing and unsupportable promises
might inch that conflict toward some kind of conclusion, who could
reasonably argue against it?</p>
<p>There was also a matter of semantics, of how one defined
“independence.” While today the word’s meaning seems obvious and
universal, that was not at all the case in 1916. For many Europeans,
steeped in the condescension of the late imperial age, independence
didn’t mean letting native peoples actually govern themselves, but
something far more paternalistic: a new round of “the white man’s
burden,” the tutoring—and, of course, the exploiting—of native peoples
until they might sufficiently grasp the ways of modern civilization to
stand on their own at some indeterminate point in the future. For those
holding such a view—and this probably included not only a majority of
the senior statesmen of Great Britain but of every other nation in
Europe—the distance between “independence” on the one hand, and
“mandates” or “zones of control” or “suzerainty” on the other, didn’t
appear to be the chasm of contradiction that others saw.</p>
<p>There was also a simple, cynical argument to be made: that the tangle
of competing promises didn’t much matter because it was probably all
going to end up as an academic exercise anyway. Even the most
starry-eyed imperialist had to recognize there was something faintly
ludicrous about Britain and France sitting around and divvying up the
postwar Middle East at a time when, if not outright losing that war,
they certainly weren’t winning it. As for Emir Hussein, he had been
talking about an insurrection against Constantinople since even before
the war, and there was still precious little sign of it happening. In
the unlikely event that both the Arab revolt did come off, and the
Entente did manage to win the war, the complications would be the best
sort of problem to have, one that could be dealt with down the road.</p>
<p>By popular account, on the morning of June 5, 1916, Emir Hussein
climbed to a tower of his palace in Mecca and fired an old musket in the
direction of the city’s Turkish fort. It was the signal to rebellion,
and by the end of that day Hussein’s followers had launched attacks
against a number of Turkish strongpoints across the length of the
Hejaz.</p>
<p>By an odd twist of fate, the westerner who had done more than any
other to bring that revolt to fruition would never learn of it. Shortly
before 5:00 p.m. on that same day, a Royal Navy battleship cruiser, HMS
Hampshire, left its port in northern Scotland to transport War Secretary
Horatio Kitchener to Russia. Less than three hours later, the Hampshire
struck a German mine and quickly sank in high seas. Nearly every man on
board perished, including Kitchener.</p>
<p>Just two weeks earlier, Lawrence had returned from his failed mission
to Iraq to resume his desk job at the Savoy Hotel. His future looked
much like his past: paper-shuffling, mapmaking, writing up strategies
and reports that would never be acted on. Instead, with the news out of
Mecca, he would soon have the war of his dreams, one that would catapult
him into prominence, and then into legend.</p>
