<p>I only hope and trust TEL will get back safe. He is out and up
against it at this moment. If he comes through, it is a V[ictoria]
C[Cross]—if not—well, I don’t care to think about it!</p>
<p>DAVID HOGARTH TO HIS WIFE, NOVEMBER 11, 1917</p>
<p>They had met several times before in Palestine. Back then, Aaron
Aaronsohn had been an eminent scientist, a pioneer in the field of
agronomy, and William Yale the regional representative of the Standard
Oil Company of New York. Now, in late September 1917, both had added
considerably to their résumés, Aaronsohn a leader in the international
Zionist movement, Yale a special agent for the U.S. State Department.
But what Yale didn’t know about Aaron Aaronsohn—at least not yet—was
that he was also the mastermind of one of the most extensive spy rings
in the Middle East. And what Aaronsohn didn’t know about William Yale
was that, his vague job title aside, he too was essentially a spy. As
might be expected, all this lent their meeting in Paris on September 25
a certain circumspect quality.</p>
<p>Since arriving in the French capital four days earlier, Aaronsohn had
been trying to get a sense of where matters stood with the Zionist cause
before moving on to London. To that end, he’d first sought out his old
benefactor, Baron Edmond de Rothschild, who he knew was playing a key
behind-the-scenes role in the ongoing discussions with the French and
British governments. He’d come away disappointed.</p>
<p>“He listened very interestedly all the time I spoke to him,”
Aaronsohn would inform his brother Alex in a letter, “and asked me
questions which I answered, but he would not let me touch on certain
subjects, did not wish to speak about them, so that it was impossible
for me to learn from him what I wished to know.… He feels, as we all do,
that if Great Britain would only rule over our land, we could obtain
great things, but as nothing certain is known [yet], he cannot allow
himself to speak.”</p>
<p>He’d had far better luck when Mark Sykes showed up in town. The two
had a long meeting on September 23, followed by another the next
morning. “He told me everything,” Aaronsohn told his brother, “and
showed me what a lot of enemies we have. Most of the opponents [are]
from among our own people, and that is dangerous to our
organization.”</p>
<p>Evidently, one reason Sykes had sought out Aaronsohn in Paris was to
play peacemaker. The British War Cabinet was once again taking up the
debate over supporting a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and it was vital
that the leading Zionists speak with one voice. That meant ending the
ongoing friction between Aaronsohn and Chaim Weizmann’s English Zionist
Federation; as Sykes explained, Aaronsohn’s angry letters to Weizmann of
mid-September had been “like a thorn in the latter’s eye.”</p>
<p>Which frankly suited Aaronsohn just fine. As he haughtily told his
brother, “Mark Sykes begs me to make peace with them and wants me to
promise not to quarrel. He says that I should listen to Weizmann and to
Sokolow. I told him that I was not going to London to quarrel, only to
tell them their mistakes and to show them the way to do things properly.
If they accept, well and good; if not I will go my own way.”</p>
<p>William Yale may have gleaned something of this rift within the
Zionist camp from his own interviews in London, but it likely was mere
background noise to the more overt struggle between the British Zionists
and anti-Zionists, and between the competing camps within the British
government. If in seeking out Aaronsohn in Paris, Yale hoped for
edification on all this, he didn’t get it. As he noted in his diary that
night—and would eventually report back to Leland Harrison in
Washington—Aaronsohn “does not wish to see Jewish autonomy or a Jewish
state at this time, saying that nothing would be more harm [sic] to the
Zionists than that. [Rather,] he wishes to see either English, American
or International government control of Palestine.” What’s more, Yale
could report, after seeing to his business in London, Aaronsohn intended
to continue on to the United States to call on his influential American
Jewish contacts to press the point. What made this rather baffling was
that while in London, Yale had met with one of Aaronsohn’s closest
allies, a businessman named Jack Mosseri. Even while extolling
Aaronsohn’s clear-eyed insights on the matter, Mosseri was advocating
the establishment of an outright Jewish government in Palestine, and the
adoption of Hebrew as its official language. Following his meetings in
Paris, Yale left for Cairo undoubtedly even more confused about where
things stood on the Zionist question than before.</p>
<p>But he also left with something else. Either oblivious to Yale’s job
responsibilities or just a peculiarly credulous sort, Aaronsohn had
entrusted his American visitor with a letter to be delivered to his
brother Alex, now back in Cairo. Other than the rudimentary safeguard of
being written in Hebrew, the letter was not encrypted in any way, and it
was in this highly indiscreet dispatch that Aaronsohn detailed his
meetings with Edmond de Rothschild and Mark Sykes and outlined all he
knew of the current status of British-Zionist negotiations in
London.</p>
<p>The spy chief hadn’t ended there, though. Along with listing by name
“our friends” in the British military hierarchy in Cairo who should be
kept abreast of developments, Aaronsohn instructed his younger brother
to put Georges-Picot, the French political agent who was on his way to
Egypt, under surveillance. “Pascal,” he wrote, referring to his chief
assistant in Cairo, “will tell you how we can watch his movements.”
Aaronsohn had even imparted some advice to his brother about William
Yale: “Get as pally as you can with him and watch him, for you will be
able to get information from him which you need, especially about
happenings in Egypt.”</p>
<p>All of this might have been of tremendous interest both to Yale and
to the agency he now represented. While the American government had been
apprised of Britain’s deliberations on the Jewish homeland question, no
one from President Wilson on down was aware of the contentiousness it
had spawned there—and they certainly didn’t know of the
behind-the-scenes role being played by Mark Sykes. But if Aaron
Aaronsohn was shockingly careless in handing such a document to William
Yale, he was also lucky. In his role as an intelligence agent, Yale
fully intended to open and translate the letter before passing it on to
Alex Aaronsohn, but, new to the spy game, he apparently didn’t
appreciate that these matters tended to be time-sensitive. By the time
he got around to having Aaronsohn’s letter translated and sent on to the
State Department, it would be mid-December. By then, most of the
explosive information he’d had in his possession for nearly three months
would be rendered moot.</p>
<p>WITH THE AIRPLANE still a rarity in the Middle East in 1917, the one
sent to collect Major Lawrence from Aqaba on the morning of October 12
was a clue to the importance being placed on his mission. Another was
the identity of those waiting for him at the military field headquarters
outside El Arish: Generals Allenby and Clayton, as well as Lawrence’s
old mentor from Oxford, David Hogarth, now the titular head of the Arab
Bureau. Lawrence had barely alit from the ninety-minute flight—in 1917,
a plane’s cruising speed was barely over one hundred miles per
hour—before learning why he’d been summoned.</p>
<p>At very long last, a date had been set for Allenby’s offensive
against the Turkish line: October 28, or just a little more than two
weeks away. It would take very different form from Archibald Murray’s
two failed attempts. In hopes of convincing the Turks that was not the
case, the British would conduct a preliminary three-day bombardment of
Gaza—the classic World War I prelude to a frontal assault—but then
strike at the far more lightly defended town of Beersheva, thirty miles
to the east. Once in possession of Beersheva and its vital water wells,
the British would then push north and west, severing Gaza’s supply lines
to the Palestine interior. If all went accordingly, the Turkish army
entrenched at Gaza would either be surrounded or forced to withdraw to
avoid being trapped. The question for Lawrence was how the Arab rebels
might assist in this great effort.</p>
<p>That was a question with no easy answer, because the very cleverness
of the Beersheva scheme derived from its modesty. In a corner of the
world where access to water was a general’s first tactical
consideration, one of the chief reasons for Murray’s unimaginative
frontal assaults at Gaza had been the need to quickly get his army to
the water sources that lay behind the Turkish lines. Of course, this
imperative had also made Murray’s efforts all-or-nothing propositions—no
lolling about on a desert battlefield in hopes of incremental gains—that
he had lost. By contrast, once in control of Beersheva’s water wells,
Allenby’s army had the luxury of closing on Gaza at a methodical pace;
operational plans called for an offensive stretched out over at least a
week. The downside—and this was where the modesty aspect played out—was
that the deliberateness of the British advance would also give the Turks
time to regroup. Allenby obviously hoped for more, but in all
probability a successful offensive meant gaining a toehold in
southwestern Palestine and little else; no race up the coastline, no
dash for Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Consequently, it was very difficult to see what role the Arabs might
play. If their contribution was to be in shutting down the Turkish
supply line into Palestine, the logical place for them to strike was the
rail junction town of Deraa in central Syria; from there, a railroad
spur ran west off the Hejaz Railway and served as the Turks’ principal
lifeline in and out of the battle zone. Furthermore, from his June
intelligence foray across Syria, Lawrence knew there were thousands of
tribesmen in the Deraa region ready to join the revolt. On the other
hand, any large-scale operation at Deraa would be to invite the
tribesmen’s slaughter if the British army advanced no farther than their
Palestinian toehold 120 miles to the southwest.</p>
<p>Nor was there much the Arab rebels massed in Aqaba could do.
Frankly—even though Lawrence was probably less than frank with his
questioners at El Arish on this score—the situation there was a mess.
For well over two months, the forces gathered there had been awaiting
word on when the British army would finally strike at southern
Palestine, the cue for their own foray into the Syrian heartland, and
this wait had led to a spiraling logistical nightmare. With thousands of
prospective warriors idling away in the port, an ever-greater amount of
supplies had needed to be shipped in from Egypt to equip and feed
them—as well as ever more British gold to keep them paid—which in turn
had drawn in even more recruits. The situation had grown so bad that by
early October, transport ships were being devoted to hauling in Egyptian
forage just to feed the camels and horses, the hills around Aqaba having
been stripped bare. As if matters weren’t grim enough, a recent cholera
outbreak had now brought the entire supply system to a virtual
standstill as quarantining procedures were introduced.</p>
<p>But probably even more deleterious was the effect this
holding-pattern existence was having on morale in Aqaba, for a sense of
gloom had now begun to permeate the rebel ranks. With no one was this
more evident than in Faisal himself. As the delay in pushing north
extended, he had sunk into a deepening depression, convinced that the
chance to wrest Syria for the Arab cause was slipping away. In his more
bitter moments, he even accused the British of imposing this inaction
deliberately, a maneuver to hand Syria to the French, and while the
harried Major Joyce bore the brunt of Faisal’s complaints, Lawrence had
frequently been compelled to lend his soothing influence in meetings
with the emir. To maintain the notion that some progress was being made,
and perhaps also to at least temporarily escape the unhappy town,
Lawrence had continued his raiding forays over the mountains—he’d just
returned from another train attack when the summons to El Arish came—but
it was all very pale stuff when set against the grand vision he had laid
out in Cairo three months earlier.</p>
<p>Yet for political reasons—and maybe personal ones too—Lawrence felt
it was vital that the Arabs contribute in some way to the upcoming
offensive. And so in El Arish he came up a new plan.</p>
<p>If not by an attack on Deraa itself, there was another place where
the railroad spur into Palestine could potentially be severed. It lay
fifteen miles to the west of Deraa, where the line passed over a number
of high bridges as it navigated the rugged Yarmuk gorge; if just one of
those bridges could be destroyed, the effect would be the same. The
further advantage to such an operation was that it could be conducted
very much along the lines of the “traditional” train attack, a
hit-and-run mission by a small and highly mobile Arab force.</p>
<p>There the similarities ended, however. The Yarmuk gorge was over two
hundred miles from Aqaba, and in a comparatively densely populated
region. On such a mission, any force coming from Aqaba would be
negotiating an alien landscape, constant prey to Turkish army patrols
and Turkish-allied local tribes. Those dangers would only multiply if
they actually succeeded in the mission. As they tried to make their
escape, the one certainty was that the raiders would be completely on
their own, far beyond the reach of either the British or fellow rebels
to come to their aid.</p>
<p>To these concerns, Lawrence offered a refinement: he would do it
himself. Just as he’d done in taking Aqaba, he would set out with a
small, handpicked force, one hopefully resourceful and unobtrusive
enough to avoid detection, and he would recruit whomever else he needed
along the way. After the operation, the local recruits could melt back
into their villages as those in Lawrence’s party scattered in search of
safe haven.</p>
<p>To most who heard it in El Arish, Lawrence’s idea seemed less a
battle plan than a suicide mission. Moreover, these were men to whom
Lawrence was not some faceless soldier, but a friend, a protégé, a young
man they admired. Weighing against this, though, were the exigencies of
war.</p>
<p>By mid-October 1917, the Entente war effort lay everywhere in
tatters. Over the previous summer, the French army had been riven by
mutinies, with entire regiments refusing to march into their trenchwork
slaughter pens; while that crisis had now abated, the army of France
remained a shaken, traumatized force. On the Eastern Front, the Germans
had smashed yet another Russian offensive, a last desperate gamble by
the dying Kerensky regime; before the end of that month of October, the
Bolsheviks would seize power and sue for peace with Germany. On the
Southern Front, the Italians had recently failed in their tenth and
eleventh offensives against the Austrians in the Isonzo valley, and were
about to experience a colossal collapse in the battle of Caporetto.
Since July 31, the British commander on the Western Front, Douglas Haig,
had been building on his reputation for callous butchery by persisting
with an offensive even more futile than his previous outing at the
Somme. By the time the battle of Passchendaele was finally called off in
early November, the seventy thousand British soldiers who had perished
in its mud fields would equate to one dead man for every two inches of
ground gained.</p>
<p>Amid all this, just how much value could be put on the life of one
more man—even of an “almost indispensable” one, as Gilbert Clayton had
described Lawrence a year earlier—if he might in some small way advance
the war effort? If Lawrence was brave or foolish or deluded enough to
chance Yarmuk, certainly no one at headquarters was going to try to talk
him out of it. Upon being briefed on the plan, General Allenby
instructed that it be carried out on the night of November 5, 6, or
7.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ACCORDING TO POPULAR folklore, the agent of their destruction was a
pigeon.</p>
<p>Since the early days of the war, the British had employed carrier
pigeons to relay messages on the Western Front, and in the summer of
1917 someone in Cairo hit on the same idea as a way to maintain contact
with the NILI operatives in Palestine. On paper, the notion had a lot
going for it. It would help eliminate the need for the perilous and
trouble-prone spy-ship runs from Egypt—with almost eerie regularity,
these voyages had a way of coinciding with bad storms—as well as the
risk to operational security inherent in face-to-face contact between
spies and spy handlers. Carrier pigeons might also mean that crucial
intelligence would reach British lines much faster. Between the
difficulty in getting informants’ reports to Athlit, and then the wait
for the ship, the information Cairo received from NILI was often five or
six weeks out of date.</p>
<p>The pigeons had proved something of a dud, though. On a test run in
July, only one of the six birds released made it the one hundred miles
to the British headquarters in the Sinai. Nevertheless, on August 30,
Sarah Aaronsohn had turned to the method out of desperation. By then,
the Managem hadn’t put in at Athlit for nearly a month (little did Sarah
Aaronsohn know that, apparently, the main reason for this inactivity was
a British refusal to increase the pay of the man who made the swim from
ship to shore to £30 a month); anxious to reestablish contact, she
inserted her coded messages into tiny metal capsules, attached these to
the legs of several pigeons, and set the birds loose. For insurance, she
sent off two more pigeons four days later.</p>
<p>Sarah had always been leery of the system, and when she went down to
the sea for a swim on the morning of September 4, her doubts were
confirmed; perched atop a nearby water tank was one of the birds she’d
released the day before, the telltale capsule still attached to its leg.
Sure enough, rumors soon began circulating that a Turkish commander in
Jaffa had intercepted a message-carrying pigeon, and even though Turkish
authorities apparently couldn’t break the code or pinpoint the bird’s
origin, they were now convinced that a spy ring was operating somewhere
along the Palestine coast.</p>
<p>Then, in mid-September, came news of the arrest of Naaman Belkind in
the Sinai. NILI’s chief operative in southern Palestine, Belkind had
been caught trying to cross over to the British lines. Suspected of
being a spy, he was first tortured for information in Beersheva, then
transferred to Damascus to undergo more elaborate interrogation. With
Belkind’s capture, Sarah Aaronsohn and other NILI agents feared it was
only a matter of time before their network was exposed and the Turks
came for them. So did those other residents of Zichron Yaakov who’d long
been suspicious of the goings-on in town and in nearby Athlit. On
September 18, the settlement’s governing committee summoned Sarah
Aaronsohn to a meeting where she was confronted over her traife, or
“unclean,” work.</p>
<p>“Today we don’t want to hear any more explanations from you,” they
reportedly told her. “Only one word, the right answer: your promise to
stop this work, which has gone beyond all bounds.… If you want to work
at espionage, leave the territory and the lands of the Jews and go and
work in some distant land.”</p>
<p>It was amid this tightening peril that the Managem finally returned
on September 22. Apprised of the situation on land, British authorities
swiftly arranged for a British merchant ship docked in Cyprus, one large
enough to evacuate as many residents of Zichron Yaakov as wished to
leave, to make for Palestine. That ship appeared off the coast of the
Jewish colony on the night of September 25.</p>
<p>In the interim, however, Sarah Aaronsohn and her confederates
appeared to recover their resolve. Part of it may have stemmed from a
belief that Belkind wouldn’t break—after all, it had been nearly two
weeks since his capture and the Turks still hadn’t come for them—but
even more was concern of what would happen to the far-flung NILI agents
if those at its headquarters suddenly disappeared. As it was, only two
people, a mother and her young son, went out on the rescue ship. To the
suggestions of her lieutenants that she go out as well, Aaronsohn was
adamant: “I want to be the last, not the first, to leave.” Instead,
Sarah would wait for the next visit of the Managem, arranged for October
12, during which she would gauge the state of things.</p>
<p>But it seems the NILI operatives hadn’t considered another possible
explanation for the lassitude of Turkish authorities, a rather ironic
one under the circumstances. Both the Turks and their German allies
remained stung by the tremendous propaganda victory the Allies had
achieved with their talk of the Jewish “purge” in Jaffa back in May. The
Germans were also well aware that the British government was considering
calling for a Jewish homeland in Palestine as a way to win the
international Zionist community to its side; indeed, the Germans were
now rather desperately trying to come up with a counterformula to appeal
to the Zionists. As a result, and even as reports of a Jewish spy ring
in Palestine circulated in Constantinople and Berlin—because, in fact,
Naaman Belkind had talked—the Germans were sternly warning their Turkish
allies to be absolutely certain they had their culprits before making a
move. All well and good to round up a crowd of Arabs or Turks and put
them to the bastinado, but in the autumn of 1917, the Germans counseled,
the Jews in Palestine needed to be treated with a little more
finesse.</p>
<p>Then, at the end of September, the Turks were apparently handed the
last piece of the puzzle—and responsibility for this didn’t fall to an
errant pigeon or Naaman Belkind, but to the British spy runners
themselves. According to the postwar account of a Turkish intelligence
chief in Syria, it came when two Arab spies were caught on the
Palestinian coast. Under torture, the men offered that they had been put
ashore from a British spy ship, and that they’d traveled on that ship in
the company of Jewish spies. Those spies had been dropped off first, in
the vicinity of the agricultural research station at Athlit.</p>
<p>For greater protection, Sarah Aaronsohn and her chief lieutenant,
Joseph Lishansky, had recently moved into Zichron Yaakov, eight miles
down the road from Athlit. They were there when, late on the night of
October 2, the settlement was surrounded by Turkish soldiers. The
roundup began the following morning, the soldiers and secret police,
having already ransacked Athlit, working off a list of dozens of names.
Among the first to be detained was Sarah Aaronsohn, along with her
father, Ephraim, and brother Zvi. Managing a quick escape was the
“ringleader” the Turks most hoped to catch, Joseph Lishansky; with their
1917 chauvinism, it apparently never occurred to them that the true
ringleader might be a woman.</p>
<p>The paradox of having to take special care with members of the Jewish
community lest German wrath be incurred was to now take perverse form
and would turn the Turkish operation in Zichron Yaakov into a kind of
slow-motion horror show. On that first day of “questioning,” Sarah
Aaronsohn’s father and brother were severely beaten in front of her, the
soldiers demanding to be told Lishansky’s whereabouts, but she herself
wasn’t touched. Matters turned a good deal uglier the next morning.
Ephraim and Zvi Aaronsohn, along with a number of other detained men,
were led to the central square, where they were tied up and repeatedly
whipped in an attempt to get those still in hiding to surrender. Struck
by her icy defiance of the previous day, the Turks targeted Sarah for
especially brutal treatment. Tied to the gatepost of her family’s home
on Zichron’s main street, she was whipped and beaten with flexible
batons, or bastinados. Still, she would reveal nothing, reportedly even
taunting her torturers until she fell into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>One by one, those on the Turks’ wanted list who were hiding began
turning themselves in, tormented by the cries of their relatives. Or
they were betrayed by others, for as the terror extended, a kind of
group psychosis seized Zichron Yaakov. “For those who had long opposed
NILI’s activities,” wrote one historian, “it was a time to prove their
loyalty to the Turks and to settle old debts. As the Turks rounded up
more men for the bastinado, four hysterical viragos ran through the
streets, loudly rejoicing as each new victim was put under the Turkish
whips, even falling upon the arrested men with blows and shouted
abuse.”</p>
<p>With still no sign of Lishansky, the authorities raised the stakes
even higher. Summoning the settlement’s governing committee, the Turkish
commander threatened to lay waste to the village unless Lishansky was
handed over. To reinforce the point, he announced that the following
morning all those detained—some seventy in all—were to be transported to
the main police station in Nazareth for further “questioning.” Joining
them would be seventeen Zichron elders chosen at random, to be released
if Lishansky was surrendered, to share in the general unpleasantries if
not. By that afternoon, Zichron residents were taking the settlement
apart in search of Lishansky, while the governing committee posted a
reward for his capture.</p>
<p>The ordeal reached its grim denouement the next day, Friday, October
5. As the captives were being loaded for transport to Nazareth, a
bloodied and battered Sarah Aaronsohn asked permission to change into
clean clothes for the journey. Led to her family home, she was allowed
to step into a bathroom unattended, where she hastily wrote out a last
note of instructions to those NILI operatives who remained. Then she
withdrew a revolver she had secreted in a cubbyhole in anticipation of
just such a situation and shot herself in the mouth.</p>
<p>Even this did not end the torment of Sarah Aaronsohn. While the
bullet destroyed her mouth and severed her spinal cord, it missed her
brain. For four days, she lingered in agony, attended to by German
Catholic nuns, before finally expiring on the morning of October 9. By
Jewish tradition, she was buried that same day in the Zichron cemetery,
her death shroud a swatch of mosquito netting taken from her family
home. She was twenty-seven years old.</p>
<p>On the night of October 12, three days after Sarah’s death, the
Managem reappeared off the coast of Athlit as scheduled. On board was
Alex Aaronsohn, who was overseeing the Cairo office while Aaron was in
Europe. He carried a message that had been forwarded by his brother.</p>
<p>On October 1, Aaron Aaronsohn had arrived in London from Paris.
There, he had finally met Chaim Weizmann and quickly forged at least a
temporary rapprochement with the Zionist Federation leader. Central to
that rapprochement was Weizmann’s recognition of the vital role NILI was
playing in the Zionist cause, an appreciation he had expressed in a
telegram to be disseminated to the NILI operatives: “We are doing our
best to make sure that Palestine [will be] Jewish under British
protection. Your heroic stand encourages our strenuous efforts. Our
hopes are great. Be strong and of good courage until the redemption of
Israel.”</p>
<p>It was this message that Alex Aaronsohn carried ashore with him that
night at Athlit, but no one was there.</p>
<p>A CHANGE HAD come over Lawrence, a kind of quiet despondency. David
Hogarth, his old mentor, had noticed it at the El Arish headquarters in
mid-October. “He is not well,” Hogarth wrote an Arab Bureau colleague
afterward, “and talks rather hopelessly about the Arab future he once
believed in.”</p>
<p>Others had detected the change even earlier, including Lawrence
himself. “I’m not going to last out this game much longer,” he had
confided to his friend Edward Leeds after the train attack at Mudowarra
in September. “Nerves going and temper wearing thin, and one wants an
unlimited account of both.”</p>
<p>This new element of emotional fragility seemed to accelerate in the
days after his meetings in El Arish. One who would bear unique
eyewitness to it was a man named George Lloyd. Another of the
aristocratic “Amateurs” who had found themselves in the Middle East
during the war, Lloyd was a handsome, Cambridge-educated baronet and
Conservative member of Parliament who had been recruited to Stewart
Newcombe’s military intelligence unit in Cairo in late 1914. Lloyd had
soon chafed under Newcombe’s austere leadership and arranged a transfer,
but not before forming a friendship with a coworker nine years his
junior in the small office, T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>As with so many other British aristocrats during the war, Lloyd had
floated between job titles and assignments with rather dizzying
regularity—stints with military command staffs in the field interspersed
with the deskbound duties of parliamentary committees—but at least some
of those assignments periodically returned him to the Middle East. With
a background in banking, in the autumn of 1916, he had been brought down
to study the financial status of King Hussein’s regime in the wake of
the Arab Revolt. His comprehensive report on the Hejaz economy—it
essentially didn’t have one—had included a damning analysis of Édouard
Brémond’s scheme to create the Ottoman French bank, and been
instrumental in its scuttling.</p>
<p>By the autumn of 1917, however, Lloyd was marooned at a back-base
office shuffling paper and anxious to return to the field. At the end of
September he had written to Gilbert Clayton, listing those areas where
he thought he might be of some service. In particular, he remembered his
old colleague in the Cairo military intelligence office, who was now
something of a legend. “I think I could be still more useful in a
personal way to Lawrence,” Lloyd wrote. “He is overworked and must be
overstrained. If he is to remain in the field at his most responsible
job, I do think he must have true companionship and relief of some other
white man congenial to him. I could never in any way attempt to take the
lead in that job. I am not even remotely qualified. But in his curious
way, [Lawrence] has rather an addiction to me, and if he liked to have
me with him to accompany him on his ‘stunts,’ I believe my presence
might help to keep him going.”</p>
<p>Its racialist note aside, the request was a rather extraordinary one,
an aristocrat and sitting member of Parliament effectively asking to
play Sancho Panza to Lawrence’s Don Quixote. Clayton seized on the
offer, and arranged Lloyd’s immediate recall. He was waiting in Aqaba
when Lawrence returned from El Arish on October 15.</p>
<p>For several days, the two friends caught up with each other as
Lawrence laid plans for his imminent trek to Yarmuk. As Lloyd observed,
those plans had a decidedly ad hoc nature. Along with just a very tiny
cadre of Arab warriors, Lawrence would leave Aqaba with an Indian army
machine-gun unit and one British officer, a demolitions expert named
Lieutenant Wood, who was on semi-invalid status after having been shot
in the head on the Western Front. Avoiding populated areas on the long
trip north, Lawrence would then recruit his local operatives from among
the clans of eastern Syria, and join them to followers of Abd el Kader,
an Algerian exile who had been with the Arab Revolt since its inception
and whose kinsmen lived in the Yarmuk area. After the attack, the local
recruits would melt away, while those from Aqaba would scatter before
their inevitable Turkish pursuers. It was further arranged that Lloyd
would accompany Lawrence for at least the first few, safer days of the
journey.</p>
<p>On October 20, Lloyd sent Clayton a cable outlining these plans, as
well as his own first impressions of the situation in Aqaba. His breezy
tone abruptly shifted in a postscript he marked “Private”: “Lawrence is
quite fit, but much oppressed by the risk and magnitude of the job
before him. He opened his heart to me last night and told me that he
felt there was so much for him still to do in this world, places to dig,
peoples to help, that it seemed horrible to have it all cut off, as he
feels it will be, for he feels that, while he may do the [Yarmuk] job,
he has little or no chance of getting away himself. I tried to cheer him
up, but of course it is true.”</p>
<p>It was an unusually heartfelt message to be exchanged between two men
for the times, let alone included in a military cable, and it may have
been that George Lloyd hoped it would cause Clayton to cancel the
operation. If so, he was soon set right. Allowing that he too was “very
anxious” about his subordinate, Clayton replied that Lawrence’s burdened
mood was rather to be expected considering the mission before him. “He
has a lion’s heart, but even so, this strain must be very great,”
Clayton acknowledged. “Well, he is doing a great work and, as soon as
may be, we must pull him out and not risk him further—but the time is
not yet, as he is wanted just now.”</p>
<p>TO AS MUCH pomp and ceremony as a war-ravaged nation could manage,
the Young Turk regime put on a decorous reception for Abbas Hilmi II,
the erstwhile khedive of Egypt. Along with bunting and a ceremonial
guard, a host of dignitaries were on hand to greet the titular Ottoman
sovereign of Egypt as his train pulled into Constantinople’s Sirkeci
station one afternoon in late October. Among those in attendance was an
old friend and coconspirator of Abbas’s, Dr. Curt Prüfer. Picking up
where they had left off, the lives of the German spymaster and the
pretender to the Egyptian throne were about to become entwined in
intrigue once again.</p>
<p>When the Turks came into the war on the side of the Central Powers,
the British had deposed Abbas—the “wicked little khedive,” in
Kitchener’s memorable phrase—and cast him into a wandering exile, one
that had eventually landed him in Switzerland. But Abbas was a born
schemer, and in Switzerland he had a lot of time on his hands. Over the
next three years, he had tirelessly negotiated with both sides in the
conflict in hopes of regaining his throne in the postwar era, and it was
a measure of his catholic approach to plotting that each side was very
much aware of his dealings with the other. The Young Turk leadership in
Constantinople had never had much use for Abbas at the best of times,
and his artless carryings-on in Switzerland did little to endear them to
his cause; indeed, they had spurned his every advance.</p>
<p>By 1916, however, the Germans had taken a rather different view of
Abbas Hilmi. Whether born of a desire to stand by an old friend
or—rather more likely—operating under the delusion that Abbas actually
represented some constituency other than himself, the Germans had
steadily come to regard the deposed khedive as their future power broker
in Egypt once victory was achieved. After persistently encouraging Abbas
and the Constantinople regime to reconcile, their efforts had finally
come to fruition with Abbas’s arrival in the Ottoman capital that
October.</p>
<p>Over the next few months, Prüfer and the ex-khedive saw a great deal
of each other, and together they formulated plans for the future of
Egypt, one in which Abbas would be restored to his former splendor with
the aid of his German friend. So close were the two men, and so
important did Berlin consider their future Egyptian stakeholder, that
Prüfer would soon virtually become Abbas’s personal handler. It was an
alliance that over the next year would take on the tinge of the bizarre,
the spectacle of two men constructing a castle-in-the-sky fantasy even
as the real world burned down around them.</p>
<p>THEY SET OUT on the evening of October 24, and very quickly George
Lloyd appreciated what so enthralled Lawrence with these journeys into
the desert interior, the sensation of passing into an otherworldly place
where time stood still. “The view up the pass was magnificent,” Lloyd
wrote in his diary from that night, “400 feet of jagged towering basalt
and granite rock on either side of us, and the moon shining in our
faces.” The Arab sheikh accompanying them, he noted, “rode ahead of us
with two or three Biasha slaves and looked like some modern Saladin out
to meet a crusade.”</p>
<p>For the first few days, the journey north was easy, and as they
wended their way through the spectacular landscape of the Wadi Rumm
mountains, the two friends talked Middle Eastern strategies and
concocted fanciful plans for a grand tour of Arabia after the war. “We
would defy Victorian sentiment and have a retinue of slaves,” Lloyd
recounted, “and would have one camel to carry books only, and we would
go to Jauf and Boreida and talk desert politics all day.” Lawrence felt
so at ease that he even talked a bit about his family and upbringing in
Oxford, the happy days he had spent in Carchemish. For Lloyd, long
accustomed to his friend’s taciturn nature, the fact that Lawrence
“talks very well” came as something of a surprise.</p>
<p>Already, though, disquieting elements were beginning to attach to the
trip. One took the form of Abd el Kader, the Algerian exile who promised
to lead Lawrence to his kinsmen in the Yarmuk region, but who frequently
clashed with other members of the traveling party. Another was the
personality of the British demolitions expert, Lieutenant Wood. After
getting lost in the darkness on his first night out, the lieutenant had
remained unhappy and aloof, rarely engaging with his countrymen except
to complain about the rigors of the journey. It increased Lloyd’s
apprehensions because, due to yet another foul‑up in the supply pipeline
from Egypt, Lawrence would have to perform some extremely risky
improvisations at the target site, and would need to rely on Wood to
step in should anything go wrong.</p>
<p>Back at El Arish, Lawrence had asked Clayton for a thousand yards of
a newly developed lightweight two-strand electric cable, to be used in
connecting the gelignite mine he would attach to the Yarmuk bridge to
its electric detonator; such a length would allow the demolition team to
be well away from the bridge when they blew it up, as well as provide a
reserve for any secondary acts of mayhem that might present themselves.
Instead, just five hundred yards of the old single-strand cable had been
delivered to Aqaba. Since this line needed to be doubled over, it placed
Lawrence a maximum of 250 yards away from the blast. Further, there was
a good chance he’d be trying to set his charge while being shot at.
Although Lawrence hoped he could go about attaching the explosives to
the under-girders of the bridge unnoticed by the Turkish guards above,
the standby plan was for others in the raiding party to distract the
Turks in a firefight from the surrounding hills. Should Lawrence become
a casualty in the process—a not unlikely prospect—Wood was expected to
take over the operation.</p>
<p>But all this supposed a sufficient raiding party could even be
raised, because what Lawrence was already discovering was a pronounced
reluctance among prospective recruits to sign on. Lloyd later wrote to
Clayton that “anyone who can hold up a train and enable the Arabs to
sack it commands temporarily their allegiance,” and this was one of the
keys to his friend’s success. “To them he is Lawrence, the arch looter,
the super-raider, the real leader of the right and only kind of ghazzu
[warfare], and he never forgets that this is a large part of his claim
to sovereignty over them.” With those Lawrence approached to join the
Yarmuk mission, however, interest very quickly died off once he
explained that his target was not a train but a bridge.</p>
<p>There was another matter, too. Among his fellow British officers,
Lawrence had gained the reputation of being a veritable “Indian scout,”
possessed of an uncanny ability to navigate his way through the desert.
As George Lloyd was discovering, this wasn’t exactly true. On two
separate occasions, they had become lost during night treks, and
Lawrence’s insistence during the second incident that they merely needed
to follow Orion to recover their way had instead led them directly
toward a Turkish encampment. All these factors considered, Lloyd wrote
Clayton, “I hope his chances are really much better than would appear at
first sight.”</p>
<p>Actually, they were potentially far worse than even Lloyd imagined.
Shortly before leaving Aqaba, Lawrence had been warned that Abd el Kader
was a traitor and now in the pay of the Turks. Lawrence hadn’t thought
to share that warning with Lloyd. Perhaps this was because the source
was Lawrence’s old antagonist in the Hejaz, Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>In fact, the French colonel had undergone a profound transformation
in recent months, especially in his view of the Arab Revolt. This may
have stemmed from his finally being informed of the Sykes-Picot pact
that ensured French control of Syria, or from a recognition that what he
couldn’t thwart he needed to embrace. Whatever the cause, by the autumn
of 1917, the imperialist Brémond had curbed his obstructionist approach
to British initiatives in the region and become energetic in trying to
get French weaponry and financial subsidies to the Arabs. Lawrence was
surely aware of this transformation in his old adversary, but, whether
still held by an abiding belief in French treachery or determined to
press on no matter the ever-mounting signs of peril, he had chosen to
ignore Brémond’s warning about Abd el Kader. If Brémond was wrong about
anything, however, it may have only been the vintage of the Algerian’s
betrayal; as far back as November 1914, Curt Prüfer had met Abd el Kader
and reported on his fidelity to the German-Turkish cause.</p>
<p>To ignore such a litany of bad omens suggested a kind of fatalistic
resignation on Lawrence’s part, as if he now saw himself on a mission
where his own life simply didn’t much matter. Lloyd saw indications of
this during their journey north. At some point, Lawrence expounded that
since the Arabs had never been privy to Sykes-Picot, they could hardly
be bound to it; instead, by seizing Syria, they might create their own
destiny. It was for this cause, Lawrence confided, that he was now
risking his life—or, as Lloyd jotted in his handwritten notes of that
remarkable conversation, “L not working for HMG [His Majesty’s
Government] but for Sherif [Hussein].”</p>
<p>On the evening of October 28, four days after leaving Aqaba, the two
friends sat down to discuss what came next. They were rapidly
approaching the true danger zone, the point of no return, and Lloyd’s
apprehensions over Lawrence’s “stunt” had only deepened. As he’d done
several times previously, Lloyd offered to stay on. Lawrence thanked
him, but explained that “he felt that any additional individual who was
not an expert at the actual demolition only added to his own risk.” He
then offered a more poignant reason for sending Lloyd back, a wish
rooted in the recognition that he might soon die: “He would like me to
go home to England,” Lloyd noted in his diary, “for he felt that there
was a risk that all his work would be ruined politically in Whitehall
and he thought I could save this.”</p>
<p>The next afternoon the two friends parted, Lloyd turning back toward
Aqaba, Lawrence continuing on for Yarmuk.</p>
<p>UPON FINALLY REACHING Cairo in late October 1917, William Yale
checked in with the American diplomat who was to act as his liaison.
This turned out to be a rather feckless young fellow named Charles
Knabenshue, who held the ambiguous title of chargé to the United States’
Diplomatic Agency. Given the all-pervasive British intelligence network
in Cairo, the two quickly concluded that Yale should present himself to
the British authorities more or less overtly; “otherwise,” Knabenshue
informed the State Department, “his independent activities would
certainly become known to them through their agents and thus excite
unfavorable suspicion.” Consequently, the two Americans asked for an
audience with the British high commissioner to Egypt, Reginald Wingate,
at his earliest convenience. Most convenient, it turned out, was the
very next day. Donning their best summer suits, Yale and Knabenshue set
out for the white stone mansion on the banks of the Nile that served as
the British Residency.</p>
<p>For Reginald Wingate, having another State Department official
wandering about Cairo presented something of a mixed prospect. On the
one hand, with the United States now joined to the Allied war effort,
British officials had an obligation to build the bonds of trust and
solidarity even in those arenas, like the Middle East, where the
Americans did not intend to militarily engage. Additionally, the high
commissioner had his own ulterior motive for playing nice with the
Americans. As he contemplated the deepening political morass into which
Great Britain was sliding in the region, its secret deals with the
French and the Arabs now about to be complemented by a pledge to the
Zionists, Wingate increasingly saw the United States as a potential
rescuer from the muddle. Indeed, just days before Yale’s arrival in
Cairo, Wingate had posited to a rather startled Knabenshue that perhaps
the Palestine deck of cards should be shuffled once again, that instead
of Arab or French or international or Zionist or even British control in
the postwar world, maybe the Americans would like to step in there and
have a go at things. Wingate could rely on Knabenshue to relay such
feelers to the State Department in a positive light—the diplomat was
married to an Englishwoman and was an ardent Anglophile—but maybe Yale
could serve as a useful seconding voice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if forced to deal with another State Department
official, Wingate and every other Briton in Cairo aware of the man’s
background undoubtedly wished that it not be William Yale. Part of it
stemmed from the antipathy with which British officials at all levels
regarded Yale’s former employer, Standard Oil of New York. Time and
again in the early days of the war, Socony tankers had been caught
trying to elude the British naval blockade to supply oil to the Germans,
a practice finally curtailed less through diplomatic appeals than by the
British seizure of Socony ships. But only curtailed; just that summer,
with the United States now officially at war with Germany, the Socony
representative in Brazil had been caught red-handed selling oil to
German front companies. In defending his actions, the man had blandly
explained that business was business, and that if he didn’t sell to the
enemy, his competitors surely would. That William Yale came out of such
a cold-blooded corporate culture did little to inspire British
confidence.</p>
<p>Nor, of course, did Yale’s specific service to that corporation. As
the British in Cairo were well aware, the former Socony representative
had just spent over two years living as a protected neutral in the heart
of enemy territory, and even if London might be grateful for the
intelligence Yale had passed on based on his tenure there, that
gratitude was far more muted at the actual war front. In particular,
British war planners in Cairo couldn’t quite forget that much of the
best highway in enemy-held Palestine, the Jerusalem-to-Beersheva road
that served as the Turks’ crucial supply lifeline to the Gaza front
where British forces had twice foundered, had actually been built by
Standard Oil back in 1914, nor that William Yale had been a supervisor
on that project.</p>
<p>All this taken together, Wingate found himself in a bit of a quandary
when, shortly after their first amicable meeting, Yale came back to him
with a bold request. From somewhere, the State Department agent had
learned of the existence of the Arab Bulletin, the weekly compendium of
raw and top-secret intelligence gathered by the Arab Bureau from across
the Middle East. So sensitive was the Bulletin that its distribution was
limited to fewer than thirty of the seniormost political and military
officials of the British Empire, along with just three representatives
of Allied governments. William Yale now wanted access to it as well.</p>
<p>After careful consideration, Wingate acceded to the request, but only
after imposing a typically British precondition. Yale could peruse the
Bulletin for his own edification, but, on his word of honor, he was to
never directly quote from it in any of his dispatches to the State
Department.</p>
<p>No doubt such a gentlemanly arrangement worked just fine among the
refined diplomatic classes of Europe, but in hindsight, the high
commissioner might have wanted to more fully entertain his prejudices
about William Yale’s background; he had just given access to Britain’s
most time-sensitive secrets in the Middle East to a former employee of
one of the most predatory corporations in human history, and William
Yale didn’t so much intend to quote from the Bulletin as to mine from it
wholesale.</p>
<p>In his memoir, Yale justified that intent by a nice turn of circular
logic: “The information the British gave me was not given to me
personally, for I was but an agent of the United States government, and
if I performed the function I was employed for by the government, I must
transmit to the State Department what news I acquired.… The officials of
other governments must understand such to be the case, hence any
condition imposed by them has no validity. In consequence, I had no
hesitancy in quoting these statements in the Arab Bulletin which I
judged to be necessary.”</p>
<p>While conceding the possibility of a gap in such logic—after all, for
foreign officials to “understand” his situation, it rather depended on
their being informed of it—Yale had a handy excuse for this, too; if his
finely calibrated American moral compass had somehow been sent askew, it
was surely due to the fact that “I had been living and dealing with
European and Oriental officials for four years.”</p>
<p>But there was something else about the young American special agent
that Reginald Wingate didn’t apprehend. William Yale wasn’t actually a
former employee of Socony at all. Rather, he was officially “on leave”
from that corporation, a status that allowed him to continue to draw
half his prewar salary. And even if British officials in Cairo were to
ever grow suspicious of such a link, they were unlikely to uncover it,
since Yale had arranged for his Socony checks to be issued to his mother
and deposited in New York. In the months ahead, as he read through the
Arab Bulletin and whatever other classified British intelligence came
his way, Yale kept a careful lookout for any references to oil.</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of October 31, 1917, Aaron Aaronsohn and Chaim
Weizmann waited in an antechamber of the British cabinet’s conference
room in Whitehall. They had been invited there by Mark Sykes for the
honor of being the first to learn the result of the British leadership’s
latest deliberations on “the Zionist question.”</p>
<p>At long last, the doors to the inner sanctum swung open, and a
beaming Mark Sykes emerged. “Dr. Weizmann,” he announced, “it’s a
boy.”</p>
<p>The two Zionist leaders were then brought into the cabinet conference
room to meet Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Foreign Secretary Arthur
Balfour, and the other members of the government who had just then
approved the wording of a statement on the future status of Jewish
settlement in Palestine six months in the making. Testament to both that
tortuous process and to the deep reservations many senior British
officials still harbored on the issue was the curious manner in which
the statement would now be delivered: a scribbled, seemingly
off-the-cuff note of a mere three sentences from Secretary Balfour to
British financier Walter Rothschild.</p>
<p>“His Majesty’s Government view with favour,” the salient clause read,
“the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish
people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement
of this object.”</p>
<p>That handwritten note would soon become known as the Balfour
Declaration, and from it would grow a controversy that continues to
haunt the world to this day. For Aaron Aaronsohn, however, it was a
first step toward his dream of a reconstituted Israel, the cause for
which he and so many of his compatriots in Palestine had sacrificed so
much. Aaronsohn was yet to know the full extent of those sacrifices,
however. On that day of celebration at Whitehall, neither he nor anyone
else outside Palestine had learned of the ugly events that had occurred
at Zichron Yaakov three weeks earlier.</p>
<p>FOR GILBERT CLAYTON and David Hogarth and a handful of other British
officers in Egypt that early November, a nagging concern began to
intrude on their ebullient moods: where was Lawrence?</p>
<p>General Allenby’s offensive had gone off like clockwork. Catching the
Turkish forces around Beersheva off guard, the British cavalry had
stormed into that desert town on the morning of October 31 and then
pressed on. By November 7, the Turkish garrison at Gaza, their lines of
reinforcement cut and in imminent danger of being encircled, had
abandoned their trenchworks and begun a hasty withdrawal twenty miles up
the coast. Bad weather prevented the British from pressing their
advantage, but they had now finally pierced the first and strongest
defensive wall of Palestine.</p>
<p>Yet as the days passed and the afterglow of that victory began to
fade, those at El Arish who had been involved in the strategic planning
with Lawrence grew increasingly troubled by the enduring silence from
Yarmuk. As Gilbert Clayton confided to George Lloyd, now back in Aqaba,
on November 12, “I am very anxious for news of Lawrence.”</p>
<p>On that day, Lawrence and his raiding party were actually some eighty
miles to the east of Yarmuk, hoping to salvage at least some small
accomplishment from a mission where everything had gone wrong.</p>
<p>Reaching the desert fortress village of Azraq a few days after
parting with Lloyd, Lawrence had found the Serahin tribesmen he hoped to
enlist for Yarmuk reluctant to join; a chief reason was their deep
mistrust of Abd el Kader, whom they too suspected of being a traitor.
Swayed by an impassioned speech by Lawrence, the tribesmen finally
joined on to the mission, but then Abd el Kader had abruptly disappeared
en route to Yarmuk, last seen heading for a Turkish-held town. Still,
Lawrence refused to turn back.</p>
<p>Despite it all, he very nearly succeeded. Reaching the railroad
bridge at Tell al Shehab on the night of November 7, Lawrence and his
demolition team had been hauling the gelignite down into the gorge under
the very nose of a Turkish sentry when someone dropped a rifle against
the rocks. Alerted by the sound, the half dozen Turkish guards rolled
out of their guardhouse to begin firing wildly in all directions.
Possessed of the unpleasant knowledge that gelignite explodes if hit by
a bullet, Lawrence’s porters summarily tossed their loads into the
ravine and scrambled for safety. With little alternative, Lawrence
joined them.</p>
<p>Men in war are among the most superstitious of people, but even one
welded to pure rationality might have decided it was now time for the
Yarmuk raiding party to call things off, to count its blessings at
having survived for this long and make for safety. Instead, Lawrence
seemed gripped by an almost demonic determination to wring at least some
small shard of success from his mission. He decided to launch another
train attack.</p>
<p>To do so, though, meant raising the danger stakes yet again. With his
entourage running desperately short of food, he ordered some of its
members away. This included the Indian machine-gun crews, which meant
that even if the train attack came off, the raiders would have no heavy
weaponry to protect them. What’s more, due to the amount of electric
cable lost at the Yarmuk bridge, whoever triggered the detonation would
be positioned a mere fifty yards from the blast site. That person would
be Lawrence.</p>
<p>The site he chose was an isolated stretch of track outside the
village of Minifir on the main trunk line of the Hejaz Railway below
Amman. Crouched behind a small bush to conceal his detonator but in
plain view of the track, Lawrence first tried to blow up a long troop
transport train. To the great good fortune of himself and the sixty men
in his retinue hiding in nearby gulleys, the electric connection
failed—they surely would have been massacred by the overwhelming Turkish
force—and for agonizing minutes, Lawrence endured the puzzled stares of
the Turkish soldiers on the slowly passing train, occasionally waving to
them in forced friendliness.</p>
<p>Not that the odds of survival were much better with the somewhat
smaller troop train Lawrence succeeded in striking the next day.
Positioned so close to the explosion site, he was sent flying by the
blast’s concussion—a very lucky thing since a large chunk of the
destroyed train engine landed directly atop the detonator mechanism that
moments before had been between his knees. Dazed, Lawrence staggered to
his feet to see that his shirt was torn to shreds and blood dripped from
his left arm. As the dust and smoke cleared, he also saw just before him
“the scalded and smoking upper half of a man,” ripped in two by the
blast; that portion of his body had flown fifty yards through the
air.</p>
<p>“I duly felt that it was time to get away,” Lawrence recounted in
Seven Pillars, “but when I moved, I learnt that there was a great pain
in my right foot, because of which I could only limp along, with my head
swinging from the shock. Movement began to clear away this confusion, as
I hobbled toward the upper valley, whence the Arabs were now shooting
fast into the crowded coaches.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence stumbled toward safety, the Turkish soldiers on the train
took aim at him—albeit not very good aim; by his account, he was grazed
by at least five of their bullets, “some of them uncomfortably deep.” As
he went, still in a state of shock, he willed himself on by chanting an
odd refrain: “Oh, I wish this hadn’t happened.”</p>
<p>In the capture of Wejh ten months earlier, Lawrence had excoriated a
British officer who had led an assault party ashore, an action that
resulted in some twenty Arabs being killed, rather than simply waiting
for the stranded Turkish garrison to surrender. “To me,” he wrote of
that engagement, “an unnecessary action, or shot, or casualty, was not
only waste but sin.… Our rebels were not materials, like soldiers, but
friends of ours, trusting our leadership. We were not in command
nationally, but by invitation, and our men were volunteers—individuals,
local men, relatives—so that a death was a personal sorrow to many in
the army.”</p>
<p>At Minifir, Lawrence had picked a fight with a Turkish force of some
four hundred soldiers with a mere sixty followers; incredibly, some of
these didn’t even have weapons, and were reduced to throwing rocks at
the hobbled train. About twenty were quickly shot down, including at
least seven from among the group sent down to the tracks to rescue
Lawrence. Of the contradiction between his response to the British
officer’s actions at Wejh and his own at Minifir, Lawrence seemed to
remain quite oblivious—or perhaps, in the passage of those brutal ten
months, he simply no longer cared.</p>
<p>“Next day,” he wrote of Minifir’s aftermath, “we moved into Azrak,
having a great welcome and boasting—God forgive us—that we were
victors.”</p>
