<h4 id="chapter-16-a-gathering-fury">Chapter 16 A Gathering Fury</h4>
<p>With reference to the recent publication of your Excellency’s
declaration to Lord Rothschild regarding Jews in Palestine, we
respectfully take the liberty to invite your Excellency’s attention to
the fact that Palestine forms a vital part of Syria—as the heart is to
the body—admitting of no separation politically or sociologically.</p>
<p>THE SYRIAN COMMITTEE OF EGYPT TO BRITISH FOREIGN SECRETARY BALFOUR,
NOVEMBER 14, 1917</p>
<p>The British Authorities have replied to the Syrian Committee … that
the telegram to Mr. Balfour could not be transmitted at this time, but
that the British Authorities were pleased the Syrians in Egypt had made
known their sentiments in regard to the Zionist Question.</p>
<p>WILLIAM YALE TO STATE DEPARTMENT, DECEMBER 17, 1917</p>
<p>For the traveler venturing east from the Jordanian capital of Amman,
there is little to relieve the eye. Within a few miles, the hilly
contours of Amman are left behind and the land settles into an
undulating plain of gravel and coarse sand. As a consequence, one’s
first thought upon coming to the high stone walls of the citadel of
Azraq, some fifty miles across that dreary desert, is apt to be
wonderment at its improbability. On this vast and empty landscape, how
to account for such a massive fortress, its thirty-foot walls crowned by
even higher watchtowers at its corners, ever having been built?</p>
<p>The answer is water, of course, an oasis that in ancient times
provided the only source of sustenance over a surrounding area of nearly
five thousand square miles. It was the Romans who first appreciated
Azraq’s strategic importance, erecting a small fort beside the oasis in
the second century AD, but it was Saladin’s Ayyubid empire a thousand
years later that created the impressive monolith that still stands. Even
today, the citadel dominates the town that shares its name, but in
November 1917, when Lawrence and his small band of raiders fled to Azraq
after their train attack at Minifir, that settlement consisted of a few
stone huts, and the fortress must have risen up from the plain before
them like an apparition.</p>
<p>Azraq was where Lawrence had met Nuri Shalaan, the emir of the Rualla
tribe, the previous June, and he had noted at the time that it made for
a perfect hideout. Along with water and shelter, the fortress provided a
commanding view of the desert in all directions. Consequently, Lawrence
had sent the Indian machine-gun crews there just prior to the Minifir
attack, so that by the time he and the rest of the raiding party arrived
on November 12, those guns were already mounted in the citadel’s
watchtowers, making the place all but invincible. So ideal was the
oasis, in fact, that Lawrence quickly decided to make it the forward
base for bringing the Arab Revolt to the Syrian heartland; within a day
of arriving, he sent a courier on the two-hundred-mile journey to Aqaba
with instructions for Faisal to begin bringing the vanguard of his army
north.</p>
<p>Setting up shop in Azraq served a more cunning purpose, too. The
settlement marked the northwestern boundary of Nuri Shalaan’s dominion.
Despite the repeated entreaties of Faisal, and Lawrence himself back in
June, Shalaan continued to straddle the centerline of the war, quietly
lending support to the Arab rebels one day, openly trading with the
Turks the next. In Azraq, the rebels would be placing themselves
squarely between the Rualla heartland and the Turkish-controlled Syrian
market towns. “He hesitated to declare himself only because of his
wealth in Syria,” Lawrence wrote of Shalaan, “and the possible hurt to
his tribesmen if they were deprived of their natural market. We, by
living in one of his main manors, would keep him ashamed to go in to the
enemy.”</p>
<p>In Azraq, Lawrence’s small retinue quickly became less a band of
warriors than a pickup construction crew as they set to work making the
citadel habitable for the much larger force soon to be on its way. They
repaired its tumbled stone walls and fallen roofs, even refurbished the
small mosque in its courtyard that had most recently been used as a
sheep pen. As word of the rebels’ presence spread through the district,
their labors were interrupted by visits from tribal delegations, visits
that invariably led to feasts and an atmosphere of general merriment.
Lawrence found a pleasant respite from it all by taking up residence in
the repaired watchroom of the southern tower.</p>
<p>Even for a book saturated with detail—some might say drowned by
it—there is something quite remarkable about Lawrence’s account of Azraq
in Seven Pillars. For five pages, and in some of the most heartfelt
writing of the entire memoir, he lingered over the idyll of his time
there, the happy camaraderie that existed between his group of followers
and their visitors, lyrically described the mysterious wolves or jackals
that howled outside the citadel’s walls at night but were never seen.
Even when the winter rains started, turning the fortress into a leaking,
clammy prison where the only recourse was to huddle for warmth beneath
sheepskins, misery took on a distinctly heraldic quality. “It was icy
cold as we hid there, motionless, from murky daylight until dark, our
minds seemed suspended within these massive walls, through whose every
shot-window the piercing mist streamed like a white pennant. Past and
future flowed over us like an uneddying river. We dreamed ourselves into
the spirit of the place; sieges and feasting, raids, murders,
love-singing in the night.”</p>
<p>Making all this rather more remarkable is that, at most, Lawrence
stayed just six days in Azraq on this November visit, and possibly as
few as three.</p>
<p>Perhaps the place took on its idyllic trappings in his mind because
of what he had just endured. For the preceding month, ever since coming
up with the plan to attack the Yarmuk bridge, Lawrence had lived in the
constant shadow of the knowledge that he might soon die. In Azraq, that
shadow had abruptly lifted.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was due to what lay immediately ahead. Just days after
reaching Azraq, Lawrence set off into the desert again in the company of
three men. Their destination was the crucial rail junction town of
Deraa, seventy miles to the northwest. There, Lawrence would endure the
most horrific—and among his various biographers of the past half
century, most fiercely debated—ordeal of his entire wartime
experience.</p>
<p>THE DOUBLE CROSS, for this was certainly how Aaron Aaronsohn viewed
it, was revealed on the afternoon of November 16, on the very eve of his
departure from London. It was then that he finally received Chaim
Weizmann’s letter of instruction concerning his mission to the United
States. The two had discussed that mission at such exhaustive length in
recent days that Aaronsohn almost didn’t bother to read the letter—but
he did.</p>
<p>Weizmann’s note instructed him, essentially, to shut up. “The
carrying out of these complicated duties,” he wrote, “makes it desirable
for you to avoid making public speeches and journalistic interviews, and
in order to prevent your being pressed to undertake such work we, in
accordance with your desire, formally request you to confine yourself to
the duties already specified.” In case the point could be missed,
Weizmann further ordered Aaronsohn to refrain from all “direct action,
either by speech or letter, except through the medium of Mr. Brandeis,”
the leader of American Zionists.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn was made furious by the letter, not least by Weizmann’s
contention that he himself had asked for such a muzzle. “The old man is
not a fool,” he angrily noted in his diary that night, “but I am not so
naïve either.… Verily, every day brings me another proof of Weizmann’s
hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>Since arriving in London six weeks earlier, Aaronsohn had spent a
good deal of time with the British Zionist leader. Their relationship
was a complicated one, rooted in both mutual respect and mutual
distrust, and they had developed a habit of getting along famously one
day, falling to bickering the next. Just prior to Weizmann’s demeaning
letter of instruction, there had been much more of the former, and for a
simple reason: in a matter of days, there had unfolded before their eyes
the most dramatic and consequential events in the history of
Zionism.</p>
<p>Chief among these was the Balfour Declaration, of course, but neatly
coinciding with that had been news of the British army’s rapid advance
in Palestine. After breaking through at Beersheva, Allenby’s forces had
continued to push north, scattering the disorganized Turks before them.
Although Aaronsohn didn’t know it yet, on that very day of November 16,
a British vanguard was marching unopposed into the coastal city of
Jaffa, fifty miles from their starting point, even as other units closed
on the foothills below Jerusalem. With astounding speed, what had seemed
a distant, even theoretical, dream for nineteen hundred years—the return
of the Jewish diaspora to their ancient homeland—was hurtling toward
reality.</p>
<p>Understandably, the combination of these events was having an
electrifying effect on the international Zionist community. From Jewish
enclaves around the world, messages of gratitude for the Balfour
Declaration had flooded into the British Foreign Office. That outpouring
seemed to instantly affirm the argument that Chaim Weizmann and his
allies in the British government had been pressing for months, that by
declaring support for a Jewish homeland and working to make it happen,
the Allies would find the world’s Zionist community rushing to its
side.</p>
<p>This reaction wasn’t universal, however, and the fervency of support
elsewhere made the muted reaction among American Zionists all the more
striking. By mid-November, few American newspapers had seen fit to even
mention the declaration—the New York Times dispensed with it in three
very short paragraphs—while many noted American Jewish leaders had yet
to publicly comment on it. Most conspicuous was the silence emanating
from the Wilson administration, a situation Weizmann and the British
government found particularly galling since the declaration had been
rewritten—and substantially delayed—specifically to gain the American
president’s approval.</p>
<p>As Woodrow Wilson’s closest advisor, Colonel Edward House, had
informed the British back in September when the proposal was first
explicitly put to the Americans, the president was prepared to go no
further than a vague statement of “sympathy” for the Anglo-Zionist plan,
and only this “provided it can be made without conveying any real
commitment” on his part. By subsequently watering down the declaration’s
original proposed language, the British had managed to bring Wilson
fully on board, but with a major caveat still attached; as House told
London in mid-October, the president “asks that no mention of his
approval shall be made when His Majesty’s Government makes [the] formula
public, as he has arranged that American Jews shall then ask him for his
approval, which he will give publicly here.”</p>
<p>Except that Wilson’s silence had contributed to the hesitation of
American Zionists on the matter, which in turn had enabled the president
to maintain his silence. It was in hopes of countering this standoff
that Aaron Aaronsohn, a familiar figure to many of those Zionists, was
being dispatched to the United States.</p>
<p>The goals of his mission had been worked out at a high-level meeting
at the British Foreign Office a few days earlier, one attended by both
Weizmann and Mark Sykes. It was a highly ambitious agenda. As the
officially designated liaison between the English Zionist Federation and
its American counterpart, Aaronsohn was to “help our United States
Organization to appreciate the actual significance of various political
and military developments” in the Middle East, as well as to promote the
“the rousing of Zionist enthusiasm, the stimulating of pro-Entente
propaganda,” and, in furtherance of Sykes’s fanciful notion of a
Jewish-Arab-Armenian consortium in the Middle East, “the consolidation
and alliance of the Zionist forces with those of the Arabs and
Armenians.” In addition, Aaronsohn was to act as the official channel of
communication between Weizmann and the leader of the American Zionist
community, U.S. Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis.</p>
<p>As daunting as this agenda was, Aaronsohn had accepted the assignment
wholeheartedly, and he’d let his Zionist contacts in the United States
know he was on his way. That simply added another layer of humiliation
to Weizmann’s letter of instruction on November 16.</p>
<p>But many people had tried to silence Aaron Aaronsohn over the years,
and to precious little success. Quickly coming to regard Weizmann’s
strictures as something of a dare, the next morning the agronomist
boarded a train at London’s Euston station for the run up to Liverpool
and the ship, SS St. Paul, that would take him to New York.</p>
<p>In Weizmann’s defense, it wasn’t merely a controlling nature that led
him to try to muzzle Aaronsohn. While appreciative of the scientist’s
extensive contacts in the American Zionist community, Weizmann had spent
enough time around Aaronsohn over the previous six weeks to grow
apprehensive of his hotheaded personality. That was especially worrisome
considering that there was actually something of a hidden agenda to his
mission to the United States.</p>
<p>In anticipation of full British control of Palestine in the near
future, as well as to allay the fears already being expressed by the
Muslim and Christian communities of Palestine over the Balfour
Declaration, Sykes and Weizmann had decided that a Zionist committee
should be dispatched to the region as soon as possible to take stock of
the situation. Sykes in particular was anxious that this committee
include an American delegation, figuring that its presence would be
viewed as tacit acceptance by President Wilson of both the Balfour
Declaration and future British control of Palestine. But a rather
daunting obstacle stood in the way. The United States had only declared
war on Germany, and Wilson had made it clear he had no intention of
becoming entangled in any affairs regarding the Ottoman Empire; thus it
was highly doubtful that his administration would sanction an American
delegation. This gave rise to Aaronsohn’s sub rosa mission to the United
States: to get American Zionist leaders to bring pressure on the Wilson
government, not only to openly endorse the Balfour Declaration, but to
reverse course and declare war on Turkey.</p>
<p>But when Aaronsohn arrived in the United States he received some
crushing news. At the Zionist Federation office in New York on December
1, he was handed a cable from his youngest brother, Sam, newly arrived
in Cairo. Nearly two full months after the event, Aaronsohn finally
learned of the destruction of his NILI spy ring by the Turks. His
brother’s cable also told of the death of their sister Sarah, their
father, Ephraim, and of the execution of Naaman Belkind.</p>
<p>“The sacrifice is accomplished,” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary that
night. “I knew that we still had to face the greatest misfortune, but it
is one thing to fear it, and another to know that all hope is lost. Poor
father, poor Sarati .… Her loss is the most cruel.”</p>
<p>The news surely added a new layer of resentment in his feelings for
Weizmann and the other Zionist leaders in Europe who sought to curb his
influence. For two years, Aaronsohn and those closest to him had risked
their lives for the Zionist cause—and many had now paid the ultimate
price—while those in London and Paris went about their meetings and
pamphleteering. That contrast was exquisitely underscored on December 2.
Just a day after Aaronsohn received the sad news from Athlit, members of
the English Zionist Federation gathered at London’s Albert Hall for a
gala celebration marking the one-month anniversary of the Balfour
Declaration.</p>
<p>IT’S UNLIKELY THAT any writer ever recounted his or her own torture
in more exacting, even loving, detail.</p>
<p>By Lawrence’s account, it began on the morning of November 20.
Several days earlier, he had left Azraq with his three escorts to survey
the countryside around the vital railway town of Deraa. He now wanted a
firsthand look at Deraa’s rail complex itself. The only way to do that
was brazenly, so that morning Lawrence and one of his escorts had ridden
to an isolated stretch of railway several miles north of town and
dismounted from their camels; on foot and in Arab dress, they had then
begun simply walking the rails into Deraa.</p>
<p>All was going well until, passing a Turkish army encampment, the pair
drew the notice of a suspicious sergeant. The officer collared Lawrence,
announcing that “the Bey [chief] wants you,” but for some reason allowed
his companion to continue on.</p>
<p>For the rest of that day, Lawrence was held in a guardroom awaiting
his audience with the bey and parrying suspicions that he was a Turkish
army deserter. He did so by claiming to be a Circassian, a mountain
people of the northern Caucasus who were exempt from conscription and
known for their fair complexions and light-colored eyes. In the evening,
guards came to take him to the bey’s rooms, a man Lawrence would
identify as “Nahi” in Seven Pillars, but whose actual name was Hajim
Muhittin, the Deraa district governor.</p>
<p>It became clear this meeting was intended to be of a sexual nature
when Hajim dismissed the guard detail and wrestled Lawrence onto his
bed. When he managed to wriggle free, the governor summoned the guards,
who pinioned Lawrence to the bed and began tearing away his clothes.
Hajim’s pawing began anew, until Lawrence kneed him in the groin.</p>
<p>With his naked victim again pinned to the bed by the guards, a
furious Hajim now fell on Lawrence in a frenzy of both ardor and rage,
kissing and spitting on him, biting into his neck until it drew blood,
finally lifting up a fold of skin on his chest to skewer him with a
bayonet. As Lawrence would recount, the bey then ordered the guards “to
take me out and teach me everything.”</p>
<p>What followed was an ordeal of horrific torture. Dragged into a
nearby room, Lawrence was stretched over a bench where two of the guards
“knelt on my ankles, bearing down on the back of my knees, while two
more twisted my wrists till they cracked, and then crushed them and my
neck against the wood.” A short whip was then retrieved, and the four
guards took turns lashing Lawrence on the back and buttocks scores, if
not hundreds, of times. “At last when I was completely broken they
seemed satisfied,” he recalled in Seven Pillars. “Somehow I found myself
off the bench, lying on my back on the dirty floor, where I snuggled
down, dazed, panting for breath, but vaguely comfortable.”</p>
<p>But his torment was not quite done and, in the telling, now took on a
hallucinatory quality. Viciously kicked in the ribs by the officer in
charge and ordered to stand, Lawrence instead smiled idly up at the man.
At this effrontery, the officer “flung up his arm and hacked the full
length of his whip into my groin. This doubled me half-over screaming,
or rather, trying impotently to scream, only shuddering through my open
mouth. One [of the guards] giggled with amusement. A voice cried,
‘Shame, you’ve killed him.’ Another slash followed. A roaring, and my
eyes went black.”</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, when Lawrence was finally dragged back to
Hajim’s quarters, “he now rejected me in haste, as a thing too torn and
bloody for his bed.” His ordeal at last over, Lawrence was hauled out to
the courtyard and dumped in a shed where an Armenian “dresser,” or male
nurse, was summoned to wash and bandage him. Then his torturers simply
walked away.</p>
<p>That they would do so was only the first in a remarkable—some would
say highly improbable—sequence of events that would ultimately deliver
Lawrence from his greatest tribulation. By his account, as dawn
approached, he summoned the strength to get to his feet and explore his
dreary surroundings. In the empty adjacent room, he found a “suit of
shoddy clothes” hanging from a door. Managing to dress himself, he then
climbed out a window to drop to the empty street outside. On unsteady
feet, he proceeded to walk through the just-wakening town until at last
he’d left it behind. Wheedling a ride from a passing camel-borne
merchant, he finally came to the outlying village where he’d arranged to
rendezvous with his Azraq companions. He found them there, their
previous anxiety over his capture replaced by amazement at his
escape.</p>
<p>“I told them a merry tale of bribery and trickery,” Lawrence
recounted, “which they promised to keep to themselves, laughing aloud at
the simplicity of the Turks.” That same afternoon, the group set out on
horseback for the seventy-mile return to Azraq.</p>
<p>So, in brief, was Lawrence’s account of that awful day—in brief,
because the story of his brutalization at Deraa would extend over five
lurid and excruciating-to-read pages in Seven Pillars. Yet there is
something in the sheer accumulation of such ghastly detail that serves
to cloud the narrative, to make vague what really happened. In
describing his wrists being twisted until they “cracked,” did Lawrence
mean they were broken? And was he actually raped? There are several
euphemistic clues to suggest so, but just as many to suggest the
opposite. Even more puzzling are those lingering descriptions of his
torture that take on a vaguely lascivious, voyeuristic quality. When he
was lanced with the bayonet, for example, Lawrence noted that “the blood
wavered down my side, and dripped to the front of my thigh. [Hajim]
looked pleased and dabbled it over my stomach with his finger-tips.”
Later, while being kicked in the ribs after his flogging, he would
recall that “a delicious warmth, probably sexual, was swelling through
me.”</p>
<p>Under the weight of such precise and overwhelming detail, many
Lawrence biographers—most, in fact—have concluded that the incident at
Deraa simply could not have happened as he described, even that it
didn’t occur at all. Put plainly, how could anyone subjected to the
cruelties Lawrence claimed to have endured at Deraa been capable of
escape? Even allowing for the fantastic string of good luck that brought
him to that point, how did a man whose wrists had been “cracked” shortly
before manage to climb out a window? Flogging so disrupts the central
nervous system that many victims have difficulty even standing for
several hours after receiving as few as thirty lashes; lashed
exponentially more, how was Lawrence able to walk several miles through
an enemy town unnoticed, then immediately set out on a seventy-mile
horseback ride?</p>
<p>The implausibilities grow in light of Lawrence’s subsequent actions.
Just two days after returning to Azraq, he embarked on an arduous
four-day camel ride to Aqaba. Once there, he made no mention of his
Deraa ordeal to his British comrades. Questioned years later, several
would recall that Lawrence had seemed preoccupied upon his return, one
going so far as to say he was “pale and obviously distraught,” but none
reported seeing any cuts or bruises on their colleague, or that he
displayed any obvious signs of physical discomfort. Indeed, upon seeing
his protégé less than three weeks after the Deraa incident, David
Hogarth would write to his wife that Lawrence looked “fitter and better
than when I last saw him.”</p>
<p>Casting further doubt on the Deraa story as rendered in Seven Pillars
is the radically different first version that Lawrence provided nineteen
months after the event. It was contained in a June 1919 letter to his
army friend, Colonel Walter Stirling, and Lawrence backed into the
account by way of listing the various betrayals of the Algerian
turncoat, Abd el Kader. Not only had the Algerian sabotaged his Yarmuk
bridge operation, Lawrence explained to Stirling, but he had been
recognized by Hajim Muhittin, the Deraa governor, “by virtue of Abd el
Kader’s description of me. (I learnt all about his treachery from
Hajim’s conversation, and from my guards.) Hajim was an ardent pederast
and took a fancy to me. So he kept me under guard till night, and then
tried to have me. I was unwilling, and prevailed after some difficulty.
Hajim sent me to the hospital and I escaped before dawn, being not as
hurt as he thought. He was so ashamed of the muddle he had made that he
hushed the whole thing up, and never reported my capture and escape. I
got back to Azrak very annoyed with Abd el Kader.”</p>
<p>When measured against that in Seven Pillars, this account has the
unique quality of being simultaneously both more and less plausible.
Absent the gothic cruelties described in the book, perhaps a Lawrence
“not as hurt as he thought” would have had the physical wherewithal to
escape. On the other hand, if Hajim had truly recognized him—this at a
time when there was a 20,000-Turkish-pound bounty on Lawrence’s head—it
seems utterly absurd that he would leave such a prize unguarded in a
hospital overnight. It’s also a bit hard to imagine that a chief topic
of conversation among Lawrence’s captors as they set to abusing him
would be of Abd el Kader’s role in unmasking him.</p>
<p>But despite all this, there are strong indications that something
happened in Deraa. Many of those who knew Lawrence best would report a
change in his personality, an even greater remoteness, dating from
around that time. It was also soon afterward that he began organizing
his personal bodyguard, a detail of some fifty or sixty elite warriors
who from then on would be in his almost constant company.</p>
<p>And as it turns out, Lawrence gave yet a third account of what had
occurred in Deraa, one that suggests his experience there was very
different—and in some respects, a great deal worse—from that which he
told Stirling or presented to the outside world. It came in a letter to
Charlotte Shaw, the wife of writer George Bernard Shaw, in 1924.</p>
<p>Lawrence became close friends with the Shaws after the war, with
Charlotte Shaw assuming a kind of mother-confessor role in his life, or,
as Lawrence put it, “the solitary woman who lets me feel at ease with
her in spite of it all.” Presumably in response to a question from
Charlotte Shaw, he wrote, “About that night. I shouldn’t tell you,
because decent men don’t talk about such things. I wanted to put it
plain in the book and wrestled for days with my self-respect, which
wouldn’t, hasn’t let me. For fear of being hurt, or rather to earn five
minutes respite from a pain which drove me mad, I gave away the only
possession we are born into the world with: our bodily integrity. It’s
an unforgivable matter, an irrevocable position, and it’s that which has
made me forswear decent living.… You may call this morbid, but think of
the offence and the intensity of brooding over it for these years.”</p>
<p>While rendered with his trademark obliqueness, this account suggests
an altogether different picture of Deraa: that Lawrence surrendered to
his attacker’s advances in order to avoid being tortured—or at least to
bring it to an end. If so, it not only might explain how he was able to
escape—the physical torture being minimal—but why he would tell his
Azraq companions “a merry tale” and swear them to secrecy, why he would
make no mention of the episode to his British comrades in Aqaba, and why
he would continue to dissemble about it forever after.</p>
<p>But if he escaped the worst of physical torture, it came at the price
of a complex constellation of psychological ones. As any victim of rape
or torture can attest, perhaps the most difficult aspect of the trauma
to reconcile is not the pain or even the fear of the experience, but a
profoundly felt, if utterly undeserved, sense of humiliation. Lawrence
was apparently both raped and tortured. While potentially devastating to
most anyone, in Lawrence’s case such a trial also cut to the very core
of his self-image. Since childhood, he had honed in himself the credo of
stoicism, the bedrock belief that he had the ability to endure most any
suffering or hardship, but now that faith had deserted him at his most
desperate and vulnerable moment. Possibly further added to
this—especially if the theory that Lawrence was a severely repressed
homosexual is given credence—was the element of sexual self-loathing the
ordeal likely inspired. Had he given in out of fear of pain or death, he
probably asked himself ever afterward, or because he was secretly drawn
to the act? Little wonder, then, that someone enduring such a trauma
might wish to adorn its memory with staggering violence, the kind of
violence that offers an absolution of guilt by making all questions of
will or resistance moot.</p>
<p>There is another compelling reason to believe something deeply
scarring occurred to Lawrence at Deraa, and something more along the
lines of what he described to Charlotte Shaw than what he told Walter
Stirling or wrote in Seven Pillars. In ten months, he would return to
that railway town in Syria, and there Lawrence would commit some of his
most brutal acts of the war, acts that would carry the very strong scent
of vengeance.</p>
<p>ON THE EVENING of December 4, 1917, the leading citizenry of Beirut
gathered for a banquet in honor of Djemal Pasha. “Every time I come to
Beirut,” Djemal began his speech, “I observe that the inhabitants are
very loyal. This has filled me with affection for them. I take this
opportunity of offering them my thanks for their kindness towards
me.”</p>
<p>It was a bold tack for the Syrian governor to take, since his
relationship with the city had actually always been a contentious one.
With Beirut long regarded as a crucible of Arab nationalism, Djemal had
exiled hundreds of its citizens on the suspicion of disloyalty, and the
surrounding Lebanon region had suffered disproportionately—many believed
quite deliberately—in the famines that had ravaged wartime Syria. Then
there was the matter of the twenty-five alleged anti-Turk conspirators,
unmasked in the documents purloined from the shuttered French consulate,
that Djemal had ordered hanged in the city’s Place des Canons in two
separate mass executions. By the time of his banquet in December 1917,
Place des Canons had already been dubbed Martyrs’ Square by Beirut’s
residents, a name it officially carries today.</p>
<p>Not that any of the assembled notables were likely to quibble over
Djemal’s generous words, considering that they had gathered that evening
by way of farewell. After three tumultuous years, the volatile military
man from the island of Lesbos was leaving his posts in Syria, and even
if his departure was officially described as temporary, everyone in the
banquet hall, including Djemal, knew this was a fiction.</p>
<p>As part of a reorganization recently engineered by Enver Pasha,
control of the Ottoman armies in Syria had been handed over to a new
German commander, General Erich von Falkenhayn. As a sop, Djemal had
been named commander in chief of Syria and Western Arabia—a
fine-sounding position, certainly, but more impressive if there’d been
an actual army to go with it. “A sort of commander-in-chief second
class,” observed Djemal’s private secretary, Falih Rifki. “The
artillery, the machine guns, the rifles and the swords were put under
the German’s orders, while Djemal Pasha’s share was that grand title to
put over his signature.… It was like the honorary rank of pasha which we
used to give to Bedouin sheikhs in the empty desert.”</p>
<p>If calculated to offend Djemal’s sense of honor, the move worked;
resigning his various positions, he had announced his intention to
return to Constantinople. To the degree that he blamed Enver for his
downfall, Djemal appeared to exact some small revenge in his Beirut
speech when he got around to mentioning the executions in the city’s
Place des Canons, a bit of unpleasantry that still clearly rankled some
of his listeners: “It is true that some time back I hanged certain
Arabs,” he offered. “I did not do this of my own accord, but at the
insistence of Enver Pasha.”</p>
<p>Djemal was leaving behind a record as contradictory as the man
himself. While his public vow to conquer Egypt had led to fiasco in the
Sinai, he could take some credit for his army’s two successful stands
against the British at Gaza. He had overseen an array of ambitious
modernization efforts across Syria—paved and widened city streets,
electrification, new parks and mosques and municipal buildings—even as
hundreds of thousands of his subjects, perhaps as many as a million, had
died from starvation and disease. He had tried to ameliorate the
suffering of the Armenians, at the same time that he gained a reputation
as a persecutor of the region’s Jews. And while his hard-line approach
had tamped down any rebellious ardor among Arab nationalists in Syria—in
none of its provinces had there been a significant uprising during his
tenure—his kinder, gentler approach toward King Hussein in the Hejaz had
badly backfired.</p>
<p>He was also getting out of Syria at a very good time. That autumn,
Falkenhayn had struggled to bring a new elite Turkish force, the
Yildirim Army Group, south for a preemptive assault on the British
massing in the Sinai, but he had been beaten to the punch by Allenby,
with the British smashing through the Turkish line at the end of
October. In the month since, and with transiting Yildirim units still
scattered over the breadth of Syria, the British had seized much of
southern Palestine, and now stood poised on the outskirts of Jerusalem
itself. In all of this, Djemal stood perfectly blameless.</p>
<p>But it also wasn’t as if either Djemal or the Turkish war effort in
Syria were finished just yet. Instead, and as had happened so many times
over the centuries when all seemed lost for the Ottoman Empire, it was
precisely at this darkest moment that a shocking turn of events had the
chance to change everything.</p>
<p>On November 7, the very day that the Turkish army had been abandoning
Gaza, Vladimir Lenin and his Bolsheviks had overthrown the Russian
government of Alexander Kerensky. The following morning, the Bolsheviks
released their Decree on Peace, announcing their intention to
immediately withdraw from the war. All along the front, Russian forces
stood down in a unilateral cease-fire. Just like that, the Ottoman
Empire had seen its most implacable foe of the past two centuries simply
fall away, one of the three enemy armies tearing at its frontiers
suddenly go silent.</p>
<p>More extraordinary news had soon followed. Rifling through the
overthrown government’s files, the Bolsheviks found a copy of the
still-secret Sykes-Picot Agreement. No document could have more
confirmed the Bolsheviks’ accusation that the slaughter visited on the
earth over the past three years had been in the service of imperial
aggrandizement, and in mid-November they published the compact for all
to see. Of course, that document also played to Djemal Pasha’s
long-standing accusation—that British and French talk of supporting Arab
independence was simply a ruse to grab Arab lands for their colonial
empires—and he used the occasion of his speech in Beirut to reiterate
that point to the entire Arab and Muslim world.</p>
<p>“The [Sykes-Picot] Agreement was a device for bringing about an Arab
revolt to suit the designs of the British who, needing tools and
catspaws to serve their own ends, encouraged certain Arabs to rebel by
giving them mendacious promises and hoodwinking them with false hopes,”
Djemal said. For a long time, he told his audience, he had puzzled over
why King Hussein had turned his back on his Muslim brethren; now the
answer was revealed. “Eventually, the unfortunate Sherif Hussein fell
into the trap laid for him by the British, allowed himself to be
ensnared by their cajoleries, and committed his offence against the
unity and the majesty of Islam.”</p>
<p>But with the Western imperialist scheme thus exposed, Djemal
suggested, there was still time to defeat it. Hussein could repent for
his past sins by renouncing his unholy alliance. Arabs everywhere, now
shown the true face of the conniving enemy, could unite to defeat them.
“I am going to Constantinople, but I shall soon be back,” Djemal vowed
at the end of his speech. “I beg the leading inhabitants of the town to
pay no attention to false rumors, and to be patient during the few
remaining days of the war, so that we may reach our goal.”</p>
<p>The following day, his Beirut speech, with its exposure of
Sykes-Picot, was carried on the front page of newspapers throughout
Syria and Turkey.</p>
<p>Djemal hadn’t limited his efforts to oration. Just prior to his
Beirut address, he had penned letters to Faisal ibn Hussein and to the
rebels’ chief military commander, and arranged for them to be delivered
to Aqaba through a confidential emissary. In his letter to Faisal,
Djemal rather magnanimously conceded that the Arab Revolt might be
justified if it brought about a truly independent Arab government in
which the “dignity and splendor of Islam” was secured. “But what sort of
independence can you conceive … after Palestine has become an
international country, as the allied governments have openly and
officially declared, [and] with Syria completely under French
domination, and with Iraq and the whole of Mesopotamia forming part and
parcel of British possessions? And how is such a government as this
going to undertake, with independence and majesty, the shaping of the
destinies of Islam? Perhaps you had not foreseen these results at the
outset, but I am hoping that the spectacle of the British conquering
Palestine will reveal to you this truth in all its nakedness.” The
letter was intended as more than a scold. “If you admit this truth,”
Djemal concluded, “there is nothing easier than to announce a general
amnesty for the Arab revolt, and reopen negotiations with a view to
solving the problem in favor of Islam.”</p>
<p>Djemal had been quite strategic in choosing the recipient of his
overture. As he knew from the time they’d spent together in Damascus,
Faisal was simultaneously probably the most devout and the most modern
of Hussein’s four sons. Djemal had also selected his words with great
care, returning again and again to two: “Islam” and “independence.” If
he’d done so in hopes of stirring doubt in Faisal, he’d selected
well.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>FOR HIS STATE visit to Jerusalem in 1899, Kaiser Wilhelm had arranged
for a special entryway to be carved from the city’s ancient walls.
Astride a black stallion and clad in a uniform studded with medals, the
German leader used this portal to enter the Old City, sacred ground to
the world’s Jews, Christians, and Muslims, like some latter-day
conquering Crusader.</p>
<p>The move had proven something of a public relations black eye for
Germany, and for their own celebratory entry into Jerusalem in December
1917, the British strived to keep things more low-key. Adhering to the
long-distance counsel of Mark Sykes, World War I Britain’s version of a
political stage manager, it was decided that General Allenby would enter
through one of the city’s traditional gates and on foot, and that no
British flags would be flown. The Allies had been handed a tremendous
propaganda victory with Jerusalem’s capture, Sykes pointed out, and
anything that smacked of British or Christian triumphalism was a sure
way to sabotage it.</p>
<p>Rather by chance, one of those participating in the historic
procession into the Old City on that morning of December 11 was T. E.
Lawrence. After his traumatic ordeal in Deraa, he had returned to Aqaba
and then been summoned to Allenby’s field headquarters in southern
Palestine. He had made the journey fully expecting to be upbraided,
perhaps even demoted, for his failure at Yarmuk, but instead found
Allenby pleasantly distracted by his continuing string of battlefield
victories. He was still at General Headquarters on December 9 when word
came that the Turks and Germans were pulling out of Jerusalem. Lent an
army uniform and the appropriate officer’s “pips,” he changed out of his
worn Arab robes and joined in the ceremonial entry masquerading as
General Clayton’s staff officer. Even for a man whose Christian faith
was now moribund, Lawrence found the import of that day overwhelming;
for the first time in over six hundred years, a European army had
returned to the cradle of Western religion, and the Middle East was
never going to be the same. “For me,” he later wrote, “[it] was the
supreme moment of the war.”</p>
<p>Lawrence undoubtedly felt overwhelmed for other reasons, too. It was
only when he had hobbled into Aqaba in late November, racked by illness
and still weakened by his ill-treatment at Deraa, that he had learned
the extent of Allenby’s victories in Palestine. It was also when he
first learned of the Balfour Declaration, and of the Russian revolution
that had brought the Bolsheviks to power. A bit closer to home, he had
also been apprised of the final fall from grace of his old nemesis,
Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>Senior British officials had been gunning for Brémond since the
previous spring; in fact, antipathy for him appeared to be one of the
few points on which Lawrence and Mark Sykes fully agreed. “I am
convinced that the sooner the French military mission is removed from
Hejaz, the better,” Sykes had written the Foreign Office back in May.
“The French officers are without exception anti-Arab, and only serve to
promote dissension and intrigue.” In Sykes’s opinion, that antagonistic
tone was set by the head of the French mission, in “the deliberately
perverse attitude and policy followed by Colonel Brémond.”</p>
<p>The force of Sykes’s condemnation may have actually served to keep
the French colonel around that much longer. Anxious not to appear
acquiescent to their ally, upon being informed of British displeasure
with Brémond, Paris had replied that, coincidentally enough, they were
already considering radically downscaling his Jeddah mission. Apparently
to create a face-saving “decent interval” that would allow for French
authorship of the idea, nothing was then done for the next six months.
Playing their own role in the charade, British officials busied
themselves in the meantime by debating just what honorific to bestow
upon their irritant. The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and
St. George, it was finally resolved, and Reginald Wingate had taken the
opportunity of that conferral to extend to Brémond his “warm compliments
and congratulations on the valuable work recently performed by the
French Detachment under your command in the Hejaz.”</p>
<p>But just because Édouard Brémond was now the holder of one of
Britain’s highest military commendations didn’t alter the fact that, at
the end of the day, he was still a Frenchman. As the dismissed colonel
set sail for France—to maintain the decorous façade, he was officially
taking a six-week leave—Wingate fired off a cable to a senior official
at the Foreign Office. “Brémond’s antecedents are known to you,” he
wrote, “and I think it very probable that main object of his journey is
political and to canvas opinion in Paris against entente policy of Picot
and Sykes. Latter should be warned.”</p>
<p>What Brémond’s departure didn’t mean was an end to French maneuvering
in the Middle East. Very much to the contrary. With Allenby’s success in
Palestine, what had previously been a hypothetical divvying up of Middle
Eastern spoils between the Entente powers had suddenly turned quite
real. And with tangible stakes in the game, the political intrigue was
about to grow far more intense.</p>
<p>Lawrence got a glimpse of this on December 11 when after the
ceremonial entry into Jerusalem, the senior British staff repaired to a
banquet hall for lunch. As the French political agent officially
attached to Allenby’s army, Georges-Picot enjoyed a place of honor
during the ceremony, and he evidently took that to mean the two-year-old
plan he and Mark Sykes had worked out for Jerusalem’s international
administration remained in effect. In the banquet hall, Picot approached
Allenby to announce, “And tomorrow, my dear general, I will take the
necessary steps to set up civil government in the town.”</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, the comment brought an awkward silence to the
hall. “Salad, chicken mayonnaise and foie gras sandwiches hung in our
wet mouths unmunched, while we turned to Allenby and gaped. Even he
seemed for the moment at a loss.” Only for a moment, though. Turning to
the French political agent, Allenby explained that, as Jerusalem fell
within the British military zone, the only true authority there was the
military commander in chief—namely, himself.</p>
<p>But if the changed military situation was drawing new pressures from
the French, that was only one small facet of the political troubles now
facing the British. Lawrence saw this firsthand when, after the
Jerusalem ceremony, he went on to Cairo. He found a city seething with
rage.</p>
<p>Mark Sykes, apparently thinking better of his earlier opinion that
the Arabs would have no objection to increased Jewish settlement in
Palestine, had endeavored to keep knowledge of the Balfour Declaration
in the Arab world to an absolute minimum. That effort had been an abject
failure, and as news of the declaration spread among the Egyptian
populace that November, dismay had quickly turned to anger. Even as
British authorities tried to placate those protests, there had then come
Djemal Pasha’s speech in Beirut exposing the terms of the Sykes-Picot
Agreement. With startling speed, and with potential consequences that
might reduce Allenby’s victories in Palestine to virtual insignificance,
the long British campaign to win and keep the Arab world to its side was
dealt a serious double blow.</p>
<p>As he observed the situation in Cairo, Lawrence foresaw dark days
ahead; if the Balfour and Sykes-Picot revelations were stirring the
normally quiescent and heavily policed Egyptian population to near
revolt, what effect would they have among the Arab rebels gathered in
Aqaba and their prospective allies across Syria? If secretly thankful
that he’d had the foresight to inform Faisal of Sykes-Picot nine months
earlier—if knowledge of that had only come now, so improvidently
combined with that of the Balfour Declaration, it was hard to imagine
Faisal ever trusting in Lawrence or any other Briton again—the news was
certain to fuel fury among those won over by the Arab leader. No matter
how committed they were to Faisal or the cause of Arab independence, it
had never been far from any of these men’s minds that the Hashemite
leaders of the revolt might be dupes, unwitting or otherwise, of their
British and French paymasters. This had been the contention of
Constantinople all along, of course, and that charge had now been given
both amplification and credence by Djemal Pasha’s disclosures in
Beirut.</p>
<p>In Cairo, Lawrence soon received confirmation of the box in which
Faisal was finding himself, and also learned of the potential escape
hatch being offered by Djemal.</p>
<p>After receiving Djemal’s peace-feeler letter of late November, Faisal
had forwarded a copy to his father. In mid-December, Hussein had in turn
passed it along to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah. Perhaps Hussein did so to
show that, even now, he fully trusted in the British, or perhaps it was
meant to convey a warning that in the face of British double dealing,
other options were available to him. Of course, he may have simply
figured the British would soon find out anyway, since Djemal had
mentioned his peace overtures to the Arab rebels in his Beirut
speech.</p>
<p>Whatever the motive, Hussein’s proffer of Djemal’s letter set off
alarm bells in British Cairo. A few days prior, Clayton had warned Sykes
that with news of Sykes-Picot and the Balfour Declaration spreading
through the Arab world, it was surely only a matter of time before the
Turks approached the rebels with a counteroffer; Djemal’s letter was
proof that this time had already come. Fortunately, in Clayton’s view,
neither Faisal nor Hussein had responded to the overture—they had done
the proper thing and notified the British authorities—but who knew what
might happen when the next Turkish offer came?</p>
<p>Lawrence saw matters quite differently. In fact, in Djemal Pasha’s
letter, he saw a unique opening for the Arab cause.</p>
<p>As he’d confided to George Lloyd in October, Lawrence no longer
regarded himself as fighting for Great Britain, but for Arab
independence. Within the upper reaches of the British military and
political staff in Cairo, it was common knowledge that British
emissaries had for the past several months been meeting in Switzerland
with their Turkish counterparts toward forging a peace deal, and if
Great Britain felt no compunction against secretly negotiating with the
enemy, then why should the Arabs? To the contrary, by playing the
Turkish card, by possibly extracting specific terms of settlement from
them, the Arabs might then be able to turn around and wring concrete
concessions from the British and French. Ultimately, by playing their
cards adroitly, the Arabs might gain independence no matter who finally
won the war.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence chose to spell any of this out to his superiors in
Cairo. Instead, he suggested that it might be in Britain’s interests to
ascertain just what the Turks were willing to offer the Arabs, so that
the British could respond preemptively. Implausible as it might seem,
this suggestion found a receptive ear in Reginald Wingate. “I have
recommended King Hussein to send no official replies [to the Turks],”
Wingate cabled the War Cabinet, “but Major Lawrence will consult Faisal
as to whether any further confirmation of new Turkish policy could be
obtained by interchange of verbal [sic] messages between him and
Djemal.”</p>
<p>The War Cabinet swiftly moved to scotch this proposal, but not
swiftly enough; Lawrence, it turned out, had left Cairo on the same day,
Christmas Eve, that Wingate had sent his cable, so that by the time the
War Cabinet weighed in, he was already back in Aqaba with Faisal. Just
as he had done at other critical junctures, Lawrence would now
capitalize on the delay in receiving orders as an excuse to pursue his
own course. That course was to encourage Faisal to enter into a dialogue
with his Turkish enemies. Over the coming months, Faisal and Lawrence
would establish and maintain just such a dialogue with the chief Turkish
general operating on the south Syrian front.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence engaged in rather labored reasoning to
justify these dealings with the enemy, arguing that with the Ottoman
regime increasingly riven between Islamists like Djemal Pasha and
Turkish nationalists like the general, Faisal might drive a wedge
between them. “By suitably guarded phrases,” Lawrence wrote, “we could
throw the odium of the [Arab] Revolt on [Djemal’s] clerical party, and
then perhaps the militarists might fall out with them.” Ultimately, so
this reasoning went, such a falling-out would benefit both the Arabs and
the Turkish nationalists, the former to gain their independence, the
latter freed up to concentrate on preserving their homeland of
Anatolia.</p>
<p>Perhaps recognizing the thinness of this argument, Lawrence
subsequently tried to put distance to his own role in the affair. Thus,
the account in the 1922 so-called Oxford Text edition of Seven
Pillars—“Faisal, with my full assistance, sent back tendentious answers
to Djemal”—became Faisal acting quite on his own by 1926.</p>
<p>Three years later, Lawrence offered a much simpler—and more
jaded—rationale for his and Faisal’s actions. It came in reply to a
question about those wartime contacts put to him by none other than
William Yale. “All is fair in love, war, and alliances,” Lawrence wrote
Yale in 1929. “Poof!”</p>
<p>IT APPARENTLY WASN’T enough for Aaron Aaronsohn that he flagrantly
violate Chaim Weizmann’s gag order while in the United States. It was
also necessary that Weizmann be made fully aware of it, as Aaronsohn
proceeded to do in a lengthy report to the British Zionist leader on
December 13, 1917. Along with a series of meetings with officials in
Washington, he recounted, there had been his address to the City Club in
Boston, “to which all the Jewish notables of the city were invited.”
This was followed by his talk at the conservative and steadfastly
anti-Zionist Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, precisely the sort of
opposition bastion that Weizmann desired be avoided but where, according
to Aaronsohn, he had been warmly received. “I tried to be brief—I didn’t
speak for more than forty minutes—and all hostility in the audience
ceased.”</p>
<p>Surely adding to the warm reception Aaronsohn received in the United
States was the news of the British capture of Jerusalem on December 9.
Since the beginning of the war, few events had more electrified the
American public, Jews and Christians alike, and it was quickly leading
to a spirited national debate over the future dispensation of the Holy
Land. Nowhere was this debate more pronounced than within the Jewish
community, and the early hesitation of American Zionists to embrace the
Balfour Declaration was rapidly falling away.</p>
<p>However, Aaronsohn’s charm offensive was not nearly so successful
with the man Chaim Weizmann and his British supporters regarded as
crucial to their American effort, Louis Brandeis. He had several cordial
meetings in Washington with the Supreme Court justice, but Brandeis
remained decidedly cool to the idea of an American delegation joining
the Zionist Commission soon to be on its way to Palestine; this,
Brandeis pointed out, would lend the appearance of official American
support for Britain’s Palestinian endeavor—which, of course, was
precisely the British goal.</p>
<p>The second and more sensitive aim of the British Zionists—an American
declaration of war on the Turks—was made fairly plain in a letter from
Weizmann to Brandeis in mid-January. “It must be abundantly clear,”
Weizmann wrote, “that there is a complete coincidence of
American-British-Judean interests as against Prusso-Turkish interests.…
This is why I think that a Jewish Palestine must become a war aim for
America exactly in the same way as [German-occupied] Alsace Lorraine and
an independent Poland.”</p>
<p>With that, Brandeis had evidently heard enough. As far back as April
1917, Weizmann had enlisted Brandeis to secure Woodrow Wilson’s support
for the Jewish homeland idea, and the Supreme Court justice had pursued
that effort as far as his sense of ethics allowed. Now, not only was
Weizmann asking him to lean on the president to dramatically expand the
American war effort, but referring to the vague “national home for the
Jewish people” noted in the Balfour Declaration as “Jewish Palestine.”
Brandeis finally wrote Weizmann a terse cable stating that American
participation in the Zionist Commission was “now impossible.” It was the
beginning of a rift between two of the world’s most prominent Zionist
leaders that would never fully heal.</p>
<p>AT THE RIDGELINE, Lawrence drew up on his camel to survey the
shadowed town of Tafileh in the ravine below. It was a distinctly
uninviting place, and as he was soon to discover, home to a situation
quite unlike any he had encountered over his sixteen months in the
Arabian war theater.</p>
<p>It was the morning of January 20, 1918. Five days earlier, a mixed
force of Bedouin warriors and a five-hundred-man unit of the Arab Legion
that had been training in Aqaba had stormed into Tafileh, located in a
mountain valley in southern Syria, and chased out the town’s small
Turkish garrison. To the north lay the Arabs’ next objectives, the
larger settlements of Kerak and Madeba. Lawrence had come to assist in
the operations against those towns, and to then push on to the northern
shore of the Dead Sea; if all went to plan, it would be there, in the
vicinity of the ancient city of Jericho, that the Arab rebels would
finally forge a direct land link with General Allenby’s army in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>But as guerrilla fighters throughout history have discovered, it is
one thing to conduct hit-and-run raids against the enemy, and quite
another to take population centers and hold them to one’s side. While
modern insurgency and counterinsurgency experts have coined a term for
the process—“hearts and minds”—the bare truth is there are no hearts or
minds to be won. Instead, the essential focus of civilians caught in a
guerrilla war zone is simply to stay alive, and they will cast their lot
with whichever side best ensures that—until that side doesn’t anymore,
at which point the civilians will move to the other side. In this most
primal of contests, appeals to nationalism or ideology are next to
worthless; “allegiance” is won by providing security or instilling
terror, or through some combination of the two.</p>
<p>In the streets of “liberated” Tafileh, Lawrence encountered a perfect
illustration in miniature of this hearts-and-minds fallacy. There had
been no joyous celebrations among those townspeople at being freed from
the Turkish yoke or at the notion of a united Arab nation; rather,
Tafileh’s merchants and small farmers and shepherds saw themselves as
caught between two bad choices. They regarded the marauding Bedouin
warriors with equal parts fear and hatred, viewed them as little more
than camel-borne bandits. If less apprehensive of the disciplined Arab
Legion, they quite naturally saw this large force as a potentially
calamitous drain on their meager food supplies, and had quickly hidden
away whatever stores they could. Behind this was a collective fear of
what would happen if the Turks retook the valley, the reprisals likely
to follow, and as usually occurs in such situations, this had produced a
sharp divergence of opinion over where safety best lay.</p>
<p>“Affairs are in rather a curious state here,” Lawrence reported to
Gilbert Clayton on January 22. “The local people are divided into two
very bitterly opposed factions, and are therefore terrified of each
other and of us. There is shooting up and down the streets every night,
and general tension. We are taking steps about police, etc., which will
allay this state of nerves, and I hope produce enough supplies for us to
go on with.”</p>
<p>Working against that, though, was the hoarding carried out by the
villagers, a development already causing food shortages in the valley
and enormous price increases in whatever was available. This, in turn,
was fueling growing resentment among the populace, and growing anger
among the warriors. “I’m sorry not to be able to send you proper figures
of quantities of supplies here,” Lawrence concluded his January 22
report, “but have been very busy since I got here in trying to find out
who was for us, and where they were. The conflicts of ideas, local
feuds, and party interests are so wild (this being the moment of anarchy
the whole district has been longing for for years), that hardly anyone
could straighten them out in a hurry.”</p>
<p>But the situation was about to get much worse. The day after writing
to Clayton, Lawrence learned that a sizable Turkish force was on its way
to retake Tafileh.</p>
<p>By the time he reached Tafileh, Lawrence had been back in Arabia from
his Jerusalem-Cairo sojourn for a full month. He’d spent that time
taking stock of the Arab Revolt, conferring with Faisal in Aqaba,
preparing for what was to come next. Shortly after his return, he’d
joined in a foray against the Hejaz Railway aboard the newest British
weapon to be introduced to the Arabian front, the Rolls-Royce armored
car. While the two armored cars had inflicted only minor damage on the
Turkish outpost they targeted, it was immediately apparent to all that
this new weapon fundamentally changed the desert war. Now, with an
absolute minimal investment of men and matériel, the British could
thoroughly dominate the railway, attacking its isolated Turkish
garrisons and disrupting the line almost at will. With such dominance
there at last came acceptance in British military leadership of the
argument Lawrence had been trying to make for nearly a year: there
really was no good reason to push for the fall of Medina; better to
leave those thousands of marooned enemy soldiers precisely where they
were.</p>
<p>His preparations had also been personal. In the wake of his ordeal at
Deraa, Lawrence set about organizing his own private army, or bodyguard.
“I began to increase my people to a troop,” he wrote, “adding such
lawless men as I found, fellows whose dash had got them into trouble
elsewhere.” His recruitment of the “lawless” was quite deliberate and
clever. Troublemakers within their own tribes, perhaps even outcasts
altogether, these men would ultimately be loyal to Lawrence alone, a
consideration that also explained the inclusion of the two camp
miscreants, Farraj and Daud, in their number. It was a bond of personal
loyalty for which the bodyguard unit would pay dearly, however; by
Lawrence’s estimate, nearly sixty of them would be dead before war’s
end.</p>
<p>It was with this expanded retinue that, on January 10, Lawrence had
set off to join the ongoing operation at Tafileh. As he’d been informed
by General Allenby’s staff in Jerusalem, the British army in Palestine
probably wouldn’t be sufficiently rested and reequipped to embark on
their next push until mid-February. In light of that delay, Lawrence and
the war planners had come up with a fairly modest interim scheme for the
Arab rebels. Avoiding the string of major population centers of the
Syrian interior—still under Turkish control and a long way from the
reach of British forces in Palestine—the rebel army would instead clear
the ground in between, the Moab Plateau mountains just to the east of
the Dead Sea, then forge a link with the British near Jerusalem.
Capturing Tafileh had been the first objective in this campaign, and
next up were the larger towns of Kerak and Madeba, but all was suddenly
cast into doubt by the news that the Turks were marching on Tafileh.</p>
<p>If hewing to their past tactics, the Arabs would have taken this
opportunity to pack up and melt away. Lawrence was enough a student of
guerrilla insurgencies, however, to realize that the rules of warfare
had now abruptly changed. Just as in Tafileh, the residents of Kerak and
Madeba were sitting on the sidelines, waiting to cast their lot with the
winner. This meant that the fate of the three towns was inextricably
linked, that if Tafileh was abandoned, any chance in Kerak or Madeba was
lost too. In essence, the rebels had no choice but to stand and
fight.</p>
<p>That effort got off to a very shaky start. On the afternoon of
January 24, the vanguard of the Turkish force of some one thousand
soldiers sent down from Kerak entered the Tafileh valley from the Wadi
Hesa gorge a few miles north of town. In quick order, they pushed the
thin rebel picket line all the way back to the town’s outskirts.
Fortunately for the rebels, night fell before the Turks could fully
press their advantage; under the cover of darkness, the commander of the
Arab Legion hastily withdrew his forces all the way to the southern end
of the valley. “Everybody thought we were running away,” Lawrence would
report to Clayton. “I think we were.”</p>
<p>Before dawn, Lawrence ventured into the town and saw firsthand the
effect of the Legion’s withdrawal on the residents. “Everyone was
screaming with terror, goods were being bundled out of the houses into
the streets, which were packed with women and men. Mounted Arabs were
galloping up and down, firing wildly into the air, and the flashes of
the Turkish rifles were outlining the further cliffs of the Tafileh
gorge.”</p>
<p>Observing that a small picket force still held a bluff north of town,
Lawrence urgently sent word back to the Legion commander for
reinforcements and machine guns to be brought up, then hurried to the
bluff himself. As morning broke, the situation for the tiny force
there—perhaps thirty Arab warriors and an equal number of Tafileh
residents—turned “rather difficult.”</p>
<p>“The Turks were working through the pass and along the eastern
boundary ridge of the plain,” Lawrence reported, “and concentrating the
fire of about fifteen machine guns on the face and flank of the rather
obvious little mound we were holding. They were meanwhile correcting the
fusing of their shrapnel, which had been grazing the hilltop and
bursting over the plain, and were [now] beginning to sprinkle the sides
and top of the hill quite freely. Our people were short of ammunition,
and the loss of the position was obviously only a matter of
minutes.”</p>
<p>But the holding action on the bluff proved crucial. By the time the
position was abandoned, the main Arab force had hurried forward with
their machine and mountain guns to form a new line on a parallel ridge a
mile and a half behind. Amid this, there occurred one of those small,
seemingly insignificant deeds upon which battles are often decided.
During his own dash back to safety, Lawrence had shown the presence of
mind to count off his paces, and he calculated that the distance between
the abandoned bluff—the position the Turks would soon occupy—and the
Arabs’ new defensive line was right around thirty-one hundred yards. No
sooner had the main Turkish force settled upon the bluff and deployed
their own heavy weaponry than they were engulfed in a storm of mortar
fire from the Arabs’ mountain guns.</p>
<p>With the Turks pinned down in the center, Lawrence drew on his
knowledge of military history to conduct a classic pincer attack,
dispatching small units of fighters out in a wide arc to work their way
behind the unsuspecting enemy. Shortly after 3 p.m., the trap was
sprung, the Arab machine gunners on the flank pouring fire into the now
completely exposed Turks on the bluff. With their machine- and
mountain-gun crews quickly wiped out, the Turkish troops wavered and
then began a disorganized scramble for the safety of the Wadi Hesa
gorge. Except there was no safety to be found there either. With all
semblance of cohesion gone, throughout the evening and into the night,
the fleeing Turks were set upon by Arab cavalrymen and marauding
Bedouin, even mountain villagers bent on vengeance or loot. Of the
thousand Turkish soldiers who marched into Tafileh, Lawrence estimated
their losses at some five hundred dead and wounded, with another two
hundred captured, but even this may have been on the low side; he later
heard reports that no more than fifty made it back to Kerak, the rest
picked off one by one in the gorge. It had come at a cost of some
twenty-five Arabs killed, and perhaps three times as many wounded.</p>
<p>The rout at Tafileh was a classic Napoleonic-style trap, and one that
would shortly win Lawrence the Distinguished Service Order medal. Yet it
was an action he himself would describe as “villainous,” a pointless
exercise in one-upmanship. “We could have won by refusing battle, foxed
them by maneuvering our center as on twenty such occasions before and
since.” Instead, by engaging the enemy in a conventional battle, the
Arabs had lost one-sixth of their strength to casualties, making an
advance on Madeba or Kerak all but impossible for the near future. “This
evening,” he wrote, “there was no glory left, but the terror of the
broken flesh, which had been our own men, carried past us to their
homes.”</p>
<p>But at Tafileh, Lawrence would exhibit a new and unsettling trait:
hatred for the enemy, an element of fury at their stupidity for having
attacked him. Even if he might lament the fate of the “thousand poor
Turks” who had marched into Tafileh, it was bereft of the compassion
that had once marked him. Indeed, upon hearing of the Turks still being
massacred in the gorge long after the battle had been won, Lawrence did
nothing. “I should have been crying-sorry for the enemy,” he recounted
in Seven Pillars, “but after the angers and exertions of the battle, my
mind was too tired to care to go down into that awful place and spend
the night saving them.”</p>
<p>Six months earlier, in the wake of a similarly one-sided battle at
Aba el Lissan, Lawrence had ensured that the mortally wounded enemy be
placed along a streambank so that they might at least have water while
they died. At Tafileh, even those Turks lightly wounded were left out
unattended as a fierce snowstorm came in that night; by morning, all
were dead. “It was indefensible, as was the whole theory of war, but no
special reproach lay on us for it. We risked our lives in the blizzard …
to save our own fellows, and if our rule was not to lose Arabs to kill
even many Turks, still less might we lose them to save Turks.”</p>
