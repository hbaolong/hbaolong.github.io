<p>We ordered “no prisoners,” and the men obeyed.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, OFFICIAL REPORT ON EVENTS IN TAFAS, OCTOBER 1918</p>
<p>It was September 12, 1918. The world war had now entered its fiftieth
month. In contemplating its various battlefronts on that day, Allied
military and political leaders were held in a certain thrall, their
growing conviction that the enemy was nearing collapse tempered by the
memory of how many times they had been wrong about this in the past. On
the Western Front, the Germans had now ceded the last of their gains in
the Spring Offensive to regroup behind the Hindenburg Line. The first
Allied test against that defensive wall, the most formidable network of
fortifications ever built, was to be a joint French-American operation
near the Meuse River, scheduled for the end of the month. On the
Southern Front, Italian commanders, at last chastened at having suffered
over 1.5 million casualties over three years of war for no gain, were
working up modest plans to move against an Austro-Hungarian army that
had stood on the far bank of the Piave River for nearly a year. In the
Balkans, a joint army of French, Serbs, Greeks, and Britons was
preparing to push against a Bulgarian army in Macedonia. With the fresh
memory of millions dead, the Allies viewed these proposed thrusts as of
the testing-the-waters ilk, a chance to make some incremental gains
before winter shut down offensive operations until the following spring,
perhaps for even longer. British prime minister Lloyd George had
recently floated a proposal to delay any all-out advance against Germany
until 1920, when the American army would be fully ashore in France and
Allied strength might be truly overwhelming.</p>
<p>In this climate, people went about their lives with a sense of
cautious optimism or quiet trepidation, depending on which side of the
battle lines they dwelt, a budding belief that the worst war in human
history was finally inching toward some kind of resolution, even if the
particulars and timetable for that resolution remained as indistinct as
ever.</p>
<p>On that September 12, Aaron Aaronsohn was on a passenger ship five
days out of Southampton, bound for New York. Having returned to England
from the Middle East in August, he had spent a frustrating few weeks
shuttling between Paris and London trying to win support for his
Palestinian land-buying scheme. That effort had been complicated by his
usual sparring with Chaim Weizmann and other British Zionist leaders,
and Weizmann and Mark Sykes had seen a way both to be temporarily rid of
the irksome agronomist and to put him to good use by proposing that he
embark on another rallying-the-troops mission to the American Jewish
community. Once Aaronsohn’s ship put into New York harbor, he had a full
roster of meetings and talks planned that might keep him busy in the
United States for months.</p>
<p>Curt Prüfer’s summer had steadily mutated from the strange to the
surreal. After arranging Abbas Hilmi’s audience with the kaiser at the
end of July, he had spent weeks shuttling the pretender to the Egyptian
throne around the German countryside, with official meetings and
banquets in the khedive’s honor interspersed with stays at the country
estates of princelings and countesses. In the mountain resort town of
Garmisch-Partenkirchen in mid-August, the pair had met up with the
kaiser’s sister, Princess Viktoria von Schaumburg-Lippe, and her
eclectic retinue of hangers-on, and had spent ten days in rather
debauched merriment even as the news from the war front grew bleak.</p>
<p>“Growing intimacy with the princess and Gräfin Montgelas and Seline
von Schlotheim,” Prüfer noted in his diary on August 30, referring to
the kaiser’s sister and two courtesans in her entourage. “In the
evenings, boozing, dancing and flirting, hectic room parties and the
like.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t all just parlor games, though. In Abbas Hilmi, Prüfer was
in the company of one of the world’s most indefatigable schemers, and as
the outlook for the Central Powers dimmed, the German spy chief seemed
to latch onto the Egyptians’ grandiose plots with a kind of anxious
fervor. One involved trying to lure Abbas’s son and heir, Abdel Moneim,
out of Switzerland. As the ex-khedive explained, his son was a weak and
mentally unstable young man with sadistic inclinations—which went a long
way toward explaining his current flirtation with the British—but if
Prüfer could somehow lure Abdel Moneim to Germany, his father could then
arrange his marriage to the daughter of the new Ottoman sultan, thereby
cementing Abbas’s own claim to Egyptian rule. It was surely an
indication of just how divorced from the real world Prüfer was becoming
that all this struck him as both a fine and important idea, one to be
taken up at the highest levels of the foreign ministry.</p>
<p>But if the German spymaster increasingly lived in a deluded parallel
universe, it was one in which he had a great deal of company. Not only
did senior foreign ministry officials urge Prüfer to proceed with the
Abdel Moneim overture, but they beseeched him for help on another
matter. Alerted to the conciliatory letter Faisal Hussein had written
Turkish general Mehmet Djemal back in June, they now seized upon the
idea of brokering a peace deal with the Arab rebels as a last-minute
solution in the Middle East—a solution that perhaps would include their
dear friends in the Young Turk leadership, but perhaps not. Prodded by
the foreign ministry for possible intermediaries to carry Germany’s own
secret peacemaking initiative to Faisal, Prüfer passed along the name of
a contact helpfully provided by Abbas Hilmi.</p>
<p>If less colorful, William Yale’s late summer was also proving
frustrating. By September 12, he had spent more than a month in his tent
at the British General Headquarters at Bir-es-Salem, in the foothills
below Jerusalem. In that time, the State Department special agent—now
reconstituted as the American military attaché to the Egyptian
Expeditionary Force—had learned virtually nothing from the British
military command of Allenby’s much-rumored coming offensive. This had
not been for lack of effort; Yale had attended any number of
intelligence briefings at which British officials seemed in quiet
competition with each other to impart nothing of substance, and had
suffered through a host of tedious senior staff dinners even less
illuminating. His repeated requests to tour the British front lines were
put off with one excuse after another. He was finally given a partial
explanation for this by a certain Captain Hodgson, the British officer
detailed to serve as minder to the foreign attachés. “I’ll tell you,
Yale,” Hodgson revealed, “I was told to show you as little as possible,
as you were a Standard Oil man.”</p>
<p>Yet the British had also unwittingly handed Yale an opening.
Testament to the low regard with which they held the foreign military
attachés in general, and him in particular, they had isolated them in
the same corner of Bir-es-Salem as another distasteful group of camp
followers: the resident press corps. From this motley assortment of
British and Australian newspaper correspondents, far less restricted in
their movements than the attachés, Yale was able to glean at least
something of what was being planned, enough so that by September 12 he
knew “the big show” was soon to get under way. He didn’t know when, let
alone where, but in the growing sense of urgency that permeated General
Headquarters, in the shifting of troops and matériel that the
journalists reported seeing on their travels, were the unmistakable
signs that Allenby’s offensive was imminent.</p>
<p>But beyond their qualms over Yale’s Standard Oil connection, General
Headquarters actually had good reason for their climate of secrecy; what
they were planning in Palestine constituted a very intricate ruse. In
recent weeks, an array of British army units had been brought up from
Palestine’s coastal plain to take up positions around Jerusalem, their
new tent encampments sprawling over the Judean hillsides. Amid this re-
deployment, Allenby had moved his forward command headquarters to
Jerusalem. Simultaneously, local purchasing agents had been dispatched
to different tribes in the Amman region with orders to buy up enormous
amounts of forage, enough to feed the horses and camels of a large army,
come late September. To the watching Turks, the conclusion was
inescapable: the British offensive was coming soon, and its target was
to be the same Salt-Amman region where British attacks had failed twice
before. In fact, however, those new tent cities were empty, Allenby’s
move to Jerusalem had been a charade, and the forage-buying effort was a
red herring. Rather, the British plan was to strike at the very opposite
end of the line, to sweep north along the Palestinian coastal shelf and
then turn inland so as to envelop the Turks from three sides.</p>
<p>That was only one aspect of the ruse; another was playing out on the
other side of the Jordan River. For some time, a mixed force of several
thousand Allied fighters—Arab tribesmen, soldiers of the Arab Northern
Army, British and French advisors together with specialized artillery
and armored car units—had been making their way across the Syrian desert
to gather at the old citadel of Azraq. If detected by the Turks—and it
was hard to see how such a large force could go unnoticed
indefinitely—it would serve to further confirm that the Allied attack
was coming at Amman, just fifty miles to the west of Azraq. Instead, the
Azraq unit’s true target lay seventy miles to the northwest, the crucial
railway junction of Deraa. Moreover, this unit was to act as the pivotal
first shock troop for the entire offensive, their goal to shut down both
the Hejaz Railway and its spur line into Palestine on the eve of
Allenby’s attack in order to paralyze the Turkish army from behind. By
September 12, the last of these shock troops had arrived in Azraq, and
were met there by the two British lieutenant colonels in charge of
coordinating the operation: Pierce Joyce and T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>By that date, Lawrence had already been in Azraq for nearly a week,
and had taken stock of the diverse fighting force as it drifted in:
warriors from a dozen Arab tribes; the British and French transport and
artillery specialists; a detachment of Indian army cavalry; even a small
unit of Gurkhas, the famed Nepalese soldiers with their trademark curved
khukuri daggers. On that same morning of September 12, the final
component fell into place with the arrival in Azraq of the senior Arab
rebel leadership: Faisal Hussein foremost among them, but also Nuri
Shalaan and Auda Abu Tayi and a host of other tribal chiefs whom
Lawrence had helped bring to the cause of Arab independence over the
past two years. With the vanguard of the attack force set to begin
deploying the following morning, the plan was for these leaders to
gather at a conclave that afternoon, during which Lawrence and Joyce
would go over their various objectives.</p>
<p>Yet it was at precisely this juncture, on the eve of the campaign he
had worked so hard to bring about, that Lawrence was suddenly plunged
into a paralyzing gloom. Shortly after Hussein and the other Arab
leaders arrived, he slipped out of Azraq and made for a remote mountain
cleft called Ain el Essad, some eight miles away. As he recounted in
Seven Pillars, “[I] lay there all day in my old lair among the tamarisk,
where the wind in the dusty green branches played with such sounds as it
made in English trees. It told me I was tired to death of these
Arabs.”</p>
<p>There had in fact been warning signs for some time that Lawrence
might be headed for just such a collapse. Back in mid-July, only days
after receiving confirmation of Allenby’s offensive launch date—an event
that should have put him in an ebullient mood—Lawrence had written a
melancholy letter to his friend and confidant Vyvyan Richards. “I have
been so violently uprooted and plunged so deeply into a job too big for
me, that everything feels unreal,” he told Richards. “I have dropped
everything I ever did, and live only as a thief of opportunity,
snatching chances of the moment when and where I see them.… It’s a kind
of foreign stage on which one plays day and night, in fancy dress, in a
strange language, with the price of failure on one’s head if the part is
not well filled.”</p>
<p>He had gone on to describe his admiration of the Arabs, although he
now recognized that he was fundamentally apart from them, an eternal
stranger. He wrote of the words he carried in his mind—peace, silence,
rest—“like a lighted window in the dark,” but then questioned what good
a lighted window was anyway. As was often the case when Lawrence wrote
from the heart, he closed by denigrating what he had written, calling it
“an idiot letter” born of his contrarian nature. “[I] still remain
always unsatisfied. I hate being in front and I hate being back, and I
don’t like responsibility and I don’t obey orders. Altogether no good
just now. A long quiet, like a purge, and then a contemplation and
decision of future roads, that is what is to look forward to.”</p>
<p>But if his letter to Richards spoke to physical and spiritual
exhaustion, it was compounded by the guilt he felt in having “profitably
shammed” his Arab comrades for two years—and this guilt had recently
grown worse. In early August, while planning for the Azraq operation,
Lawrence had again met with Nuri Shalaan, the warlord of the powerful
Rualla tribe he had first tried to woo to the Sherifian cause a year
before by suggesting the chieftain believe the most recent promises
Great Britain had made to the Arabs. At their August meeting, Shalaan
had at last fully committed his tribe to the rebel side, although in the
disclosures since their previous meeting—the Balfour Declaration, the
Sykes-Picot Agreement—he surely knew his British suitor had been less
than forthright. If exactly why remains elusive, it is clear both from
Lawrence’s memoir and comments he made to his early biographers that the
deception he had perpetrated on Shalaan weighed more heavily on his
conscience than any other.</p>
<p>Then, right before setting out for Azraq, there had been an incident
that caused Lawrence to question the very purpose of his “crusade” for
the Arabs. In late August, just as the main Arab army was preparing to
leave the Aqaba region for the north, King Hussein had elected to pick a
bitter and rather public fight with Faisal, all but accusing him of
disloyalty. For nearly a week, the angry cables had passed between
father and son, during which the rebel advance ground to a halt, the
entire Syrian offensive cast into doubt as the clock ticked away.
Lawrence had finally patched together a rapprochement—intercepting one
of Hussein’s cables, he had scissored off its angry second half, only
passing along to Faisal the apologetic-sounding first half—but that all
his plans had been nearly sabotaged by the man he was ostensibly
fighting for left a bitterness that would never fully go away.</p>
<p>But it seems something else was also working on Lawrence that day in
Ain el Essad, a very recent and devastating personal blow. By all
evidence, it was during his stay in Azraq that he first learned of the
death of Dahoum, his young companion at Carchemish, the apparent victim
of a typhus epidemic that had swept northern Syria some time before. To
a profound degree—and to a depth Lawrence himself may not have fully
realized—he had come to personify the war in his own mind in the form of
Dahoum; it was for that young Syrian boy and his future that the Arabs
needed to be free. Now Dahoum was dead, and with him had gone so much of
what had animated Lawrence to the fight. Although he would never reveal
the identity of the mysterious “S.A.” to whom Seven Pillars is
dedicated—Dahoum’s real name was Salim Ali—the first stanzas of the
book’s prefatory poem strongly suggest both the timing of when Lawrence
learned of Dahoum’s death and the effect it had upon him:</p>
<p>I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands</p>
<p>And wrote my will across the sky in stars</p>
<p>To earn you Freedom, the seven pillared worthy house,</p>
<p>That your eyes might be shining for me when we came.</p>
<p>Death seemed my servant on the road, till we were near</p>
<p>And saw you waiting</p>
<p>When you smiled, and in sorrowful envy [death] outran me</p>
<p>And took you apart: into his quietness.</p>
<p>Despite his grief, Lawrence had given too much of himself, and asked
too much of the Arabs, to pull away at the climax of their long
campaign. He would write of his mood on September 12 that “today it came
to me with finality that my patience as regards the false position I had
been led into was finished. A week [more], two weeks, three, and I would
insist upon relief. My nerve had broken, and I would be lucky if the
ruin of it could be hidden so long.” With that, he rose from his “lair”
at Ain el Essad and made his way back to the gathered warriors at Azraq,
now just hours away from their first strikes against the enemy.</p>
<p>By coincidence, that same day, a top-secret report was being sent to
the U.S. military intelligence office in London, outlining the collapse
of morale among the Arab rebels fighting with the British. “It is
reported that the Syrians who are with Emir Faisal in the Aqaba region,”
the September 12 report stated, “are entirely disaffected and that there
are many dissensions.” One reason, apparently, was the rebels’ woeful
incompetence on the battlefield. “In spite of the support of the
British, the Arabs of Arabia have shown their incapacity to organize or
make war.… The entire Arab situation appears to be in a great
muddle.”</p>
<p>The report’s author was the military intelligence bureau’s chief
correspondent in the Middle East, attaché William Yale. With that
dispatch he was establishing a tradition of fundamentally misreading the
situation in the Middle East that his successors in the American
intelligence community would rigorously maintain for the next
ninety-five years.</p>
<p>IT HAD A certain boys’-lark quality to it, a not uncommon experience
in war when all the advantages and few of the risks reside with one’s
own side. Leaving Azraq on the morning of September 14, Lawrence spent
the better part of a week careening through the desert around Deraa in a
Rolls-Royce armored car, blowing up bridges and tearing up railway
tracks, dodging ineffective enemy air attacks, skirmishing with the
occasional unlucky Turkish foot patrol.</p>
<p>The ease with which he was able to do so could be largely credited to
the success of the ruse concocted at Allenby’s headquarters. With the
Turks massed around Amman in anticipation of the presumed attack there,
the Azraq strike force had nearly free rein to pursue its goals: the
severing of the Hejaz Railway to the north and south of Deraa, as well
as of the vital western spur leading into Palestine. The ultimate goal,
of course, was to accomplish all this before Allenby’s offensive got
under way on September 19.</p>
<p>As Lawrence discovered when he caught up to the main raiding party,
however, a first attempt on the southern railway link had gone awry
through simple bad luck. Now quite sold on the efficacy of mechanized
war in the desert, he decided to make a personal go of it, setting out
for the southern railroad with just two armored cars and two “tenders,”
or large sedans. He found his target on the morning of September 16 in
the form of a lightly defended bridge in the middle of nowhere, “a
pleasant little work, eighty feet long and fifteen feet high.” A
particular point of pride for Lawrence was the new technique he and his
colleagues used in setting their explosives, one that left the bridge
“scientifically shattered” but still standing; Turkish repair crews
would now have the time-consuming task of dismantling the wreckage
before they could start to rebuild.</p>
<p>That job complete, Lawrence rejoined the main Arab force as it fell
upon the railway north of Deraa the following morning. Encountering
little resistance, the thousand-odd warriors quickly took control of a
nearly ten-mile stretch of track, enabling the demolition teams to begin
placing their mines. The action had the effect of lifting Lawrence from
the dark mood that had stalked him in Azraq; his primary orders from
headquarters had been to isolate Deraa, and “I could hardly believe our
fortune, hardly believe that our word to Allenby was fulfilled so simply
and so soon.”</p>
<p>This left only the western spur leading into Palestine, and on that
same afternoon of September 17, an Arab force stormed a railway station
a few miles to the west of Deraa; in short order, they had ransacked the
terminal and put to the torch all that couldn’t be carried off. But
Lawrence had grander plans. Leading a small band farther west, he hoped
to blow up the Yarmuk gorge bridges that had eluded his destruction a
year before. Once again, though, he was to be thwarted, this time by the
presence of a train filled with German and Turkish troops coming up from
Palestine.</p>
<p>Still, as Lawrence turned back to rejoin the main rebel force the
next day, he had every reason to feel pleased with the “work” that had
been done: the main Turkish telegraph link to Palestine was now cut, all
three railway spans sufficiently damaged that repair would take days, if
not weeks. There was still more mayhem to be accomplished—on that same
afternoon of September 18, he would see to the blowing up of another
bridge, the seventy-ninth of his career—but the Azraq vanguard had
achieved most every objective asked of it in prelude to Allenby’s
offensive, now just hours away.</p>
<p>By prior arrangement, a Royal Flying Corps plane was scheduled to put
into Azraq on the morning of September 21, bringing reports of how the
offensive in Palestine was faring. Anxious for news, Lawrence raced back
to the desert fortress the day before. Nearing a state of complete
collapse—he’d barely slept since setting out from Azraq six days
earlier—he found an empty cot in the encampment’s field hospital and
fell into an exhausted slumber.</p>
<p>YALE’S FIRST CLUE came when he stepped into his assigned mess hall
for dinner on September 18: the journalists were gone. The next clue was
when he walked down to the motor pool compound: all the vehicles were
gone, too. A junior British officer bravely explained that they had all
been dispatched to various parts of the front in prelude to the coming
offensive; apparently, none had been detailed for Yale or the one other
military attaché remaining, an Italian major named de Sambouy.</p>
<p>“I was irritated and perplexed,” Yale wrote. “What should a military
attaché do? Ought I to demand transportation to the front, or should I
accept the lame excuse given us? Why shouldn’t Sambouy do something? He
was a regular army officer who had been in the war since 1915. I went to
bed annoyed with myself and the British.”</p>
<p>His sleep was to be interrupted. At 4:45 a.m. on the morning of
September 19, Yale was wrenched awake by “a terrific roar that seemed to
shake the whole world.” As one, nearly five hundred British artillery
guns had commenced shelling the Turkish line all along the Palestinian
front.</p>
<p>By the time he rose and dressed, Yale had resolved what to do.
Striding into a general’s office, he announced that he was on his way to
breakfast, and that if there wasn’t a car waiting for him when he
emerged, he would send a cable to Washington announcing that he was
being held captive by the British. His Italian counterpart was aghast at
his temerity, but when the pair emerged from the mess hall a short time
later, they found a Ford Model T awaiting them with a former London
cabdriver at the wheel.</p>
<p>They made that morning for a bluff overlooking the Plain of Sharon,
from which, they were told, they could view one section of the
battlefield. Finding a group of British officers already ensconced in
the ruins of an old Crusader castle, the two attachés joined them,
training their binoculars on the action two or three miles to the north.
It was Yale’s first experience observing combat, and he found it
decidedly underwhelming. “Infrequent bursts of [artillery] shells
[coming from] back of us on the plateau, white puffs of riflery on the
hills in front of us, the intermittent rat-tat-tat of machine guns and,
from time to time, lines of men who could scarcely be distinguished
against the gray blankness of the limestone hills. It was nowhere near
as thrilling as the sham battles I had watched as a boy at Van Cortland
Park. For us, the day was long and monotonous. No one seemed to know
what was happening; certainly, I had no idea of whether the British or
the Turks were winning.”</p>
<p>New to war, the American attaché couldn’t appreciate that he was
actually experiencing the very essence of the traditional battlefield,
that amid the engulfing chaos even senior field commanders usually had
only the vaguest sense of what was happening—and then often only on the
ground directly before them. But the ever-resourceful Yale saw a means
around this. Returning to General Headquarters that evening, he parlayed
his attaché status into gaining admittance to the main telegraph room.
There he discovered stacks of cables coming in from every corner of the
front, dispatches that when plotted on a map gave him a grasp of the
overall campaign available only to Allenby and his most senior advisors.
This knowledge stood him in very good stead the following day when,
having ventured to a new part of the front, Yale found himself briefing
a British brigadier general on what was occurring elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This helped me to feel less awkward amongst the military,” he
recalled, “and I even began to regain the confidence in myself which had
been badly shaken when first I was thrown in among professional
soldiers.”</p>
<p>For the first two days of the offensive, Yale had the luxury of
observing war from a comfortable remove, the combatants appearing as so
many scurrying ants in the distance. That ended on September 21, when he
and his Model T companions journeyed up a mountain road leading to the
town of Nablus in the Samaria foothills. The day before, a fleeing
Turkish formation had made for Nablus up that same road, and there they
had been found by the bombs and machine guns of swarming British
warplanes.</p>
<p>“The Turks had no way of fighting back,” Yale recounted. “There was
no shelter to run to, and no way of surrendering. The results were
tragic.… For a few miles, the road was lined with bloated corpses,
swelling to the bursting point under the hot rays of the sun.”</p>
<p>One image in particular stuck in Yale’s memory, a stretch of the road
where an old Roman aqueduct crossed the valley. Here, scores of Turkish
soldiers had hugged the stone walls of the aqueduct as protection
against the strafing British warplanes—only to fall victim when the
planes circled back to attack from the other direction. The dead men lay
in a neat single-file line along the entire length of the aqueduct,
looking “for all the world,” Yale would recall, “like a row of tin
soldiers toppled over.”</p>
<p>THE NEWS WAS staggering. When the RFC plane touched down at Azraq on
the morning of September 21, its pilot told of a British sweep up the
Palestinian coast that had simply steamrolled whatever scant Turkish
resistance stood in its path. A few weeks earlier, General Headquarters
had talked of an advance that might take them as far as the city of
Nablus, forty miles north of Jerusalem; now, in a matter of just two
days, the British vanguard was already far above Nablus, and thousands
of enemy soldiers had thrown down their weapons in surrender. The note
of triumph was evident in the letter General Allenby had sent to Azraq
for Faisal. “Already the Turkish Army in Syria has suffered a defeat
from which it can scarcely recover,” it read. “It rests upon us now, by
the redoubled energy of our [joint] attacks, to turn defeat into
destruction.”</p>
<p>More details were provided in a letter Alan Dawnay had sent to
Lieutenant Colonel Joyce. By the previous evening, the British cavalry
had already begun turning inland from their charge up the coast, leaving
the enemy units in Palestine in imminent danger of being encircled. “The
whole Turkish army is in the net,” Dawnay exulted, “and every bolt-hole
closed except, possibly, that east of the Jordan by way of the Yarmuk
valley. If the Arabs can close this, too—and close it in time—then not a
man or gun or wagon ought to escape. Some victory!”</p>
<p>As Lawrence plainly put it in Seven Pillars, “the face of our war was
changed.”</p>
<p>Also changed, naturally, were the prior battle plans drawn up for the
Azraq force, the pace of events now rendering them obsolete. That
afternoon, Lawrence boarded the RFC plane for its return to Palestine
and an urgent meeting with General Allenby’s staff.</p>
<p>As Lawrence learned at headquarters, and as Allenby had alluded in
his note to Faisal, the goal now was not to defeat the Turkish army—that
had already been achieved—but to destroy it completely. To that end,
even as the left flank of the British army continued its northern
advance, three other columns were to cut east across the Jordan River in
order to roll up the inland Syrian towns along the Hejaz Railway and,
ultimately, close on Damascus. The linchpin was, as always, Deraa, the
one spot where all the Turkish units fleeing east from Palestine and all
those still to the south might converge and perhaps sufficiently regroup
to make a stand. To forestall that, headquarters impressed on Lawrence,
there was one thing the Arabs must do—permanently sever the rail line
south of Deraa—and one thing they absolutely must not do: make a dash
for Damascus.</p>
<p>This latter point had already been stressed in Alan Dawnay’s letter
to Joyce in Azraq (with Joyce temporarily away, Lawrence had opened and
read it). “Use all your restraining influence,” Dawnay had ordered
Joyce, “and get Lawrence to do the same, to prevent Faisal from any act
of rashness in the north.… The situation is completely in our hands to
mold now, so Faisal need have no fear of being carted, provided he will
trust us and be patient. Only let him no on account move north without
first consulting General Allenby—that would be the fatal error.”</p>
<p>British concern was quite understandable. For nearly two years,
Lawrence had been counseling Faisal that the only sure way for the Arabs
to stake claim to Damascus was to get there first; this assertion had
appeared to be further confirmed by Mark Sykes’s recent open letter to
the “Seven Syrians.” As a result, the temptation for Faisal to drop the
Deraa operations and make a dash for Damascus might prove an
irresistible one. During Lawrence’s brief sojourn at headquarters,
Allenby’s senior advisors repeatedly emphasized that Arab loyalty at
this crucial juncture would be well compensated—apparently even implying
that Faisal would be allowed to establish a government in Damascus.</p>
<p>Armed with these assurances, and with the Arabs’ new orders of battle
in hand, Lawrence flew back to Azraq the next morning. Over the
following two days, a host of Arab bands, along with British armored car
units, descended on the Hejaz Railway below Deraa to render it damaged
beyond repair for the foreseeable future. Already, however, the worry
that the retreating Turkish armies might recover enough to make a stand
in Deraa seemed far-fetched; the enemy was now in full and panicked
rout, their soldiers so stunned by the speed of events that they could
think of little more than personal escape. Indeed, so rapid was the
Turkish disintegration that by September 25, Lawrence was able to report
to headquarters that there were probably only four thousand Turkish
soldiers left in all the inland garrison towns below Deraa, most of the
rest having passed through Deraa and kept on going in the direction of
Damascus.</p>
<p>But in keeping with the broadened goal of destroying the Turkish army
utterly, Lawrence saw an opportunity; if Deraa wasn’t to be a Turkish
rallying point, it could now be turned into a killing field. As he
tersely commented in his September 25 report in describing the enemy
units trying to reach Damascus, “I want to stop that.”</p>
<p>To do so, on the twenty-sixth he directed a number of the Arab
warriors to make for a small village in the foothills just twelve miles
northwest of Deraa called Sheikh Saad. From there, the rebels would
enjoy a commanding view of what was transpiring both in Deraa and on the
road to Damascus, and also be able to monitor any retreating Turkish
units coming up out of the Yarmuk gorge from Palestine.</p>
<p>Lawrence soon had reason to congratulate himself on the move. That
same afternoon, scouts spotted a small mixed German and Turkish force
coming up the Yarmuk road, “hopeless but carefree, marching at ease,
thinking themselves fifty miles from any war.” Walking heedlessly into a
hastily prepared Arab ambush, the unit was soon overwhelmed. As Lawrence
noted, “Sheikh Saad was paying soon, and well.”</p>
<p>That was just a foretaste. The next morning, and with a British army
now coming up the Yarmuk, the Turks remaining in and around Deraa
prepared to abandon their positions as well. Word reached Lawrence that
some four thousand enemy soldiers were about to set out from Deraa on
the main Damascus road, while another two thousand were pulling out of a
nearby town. This latter column was taking an overland shortcut that
would bring them through the village of Tafas, just six miles below
Sheikh Saad. As Lawrence drily commented in Seven Pillars, “The nearer
two thousand seemed more our size.”</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of September 23, the Mediterranean city of Haifa was
captured from the Turks by an Indian army cavalry unit. Arriving that
evening, William Yale arranged for lodging in a private home, then
decided to take a stroll through the city’s deserted old quarter.</p>
<p>At the start of World War I, most all the warring powers had
horse-mounted cavalry that still carried lances as part of their
complement of weaponry. By 1918, nearly all such cavalries had discarded
the lance as anachronistic in the age of the machine gun and warplane,
but not so the Indian army. That afternoon, they had employed it to
deadly effect in the narrow back streets of Haifa’s old quarter, running
down and impaling terrified Turkish soldiers as they tried to flee.
Everywhere Yale walked lay the dead.</p>
<p>“In the silent lonely streets,” he recalled, “under a brilliant moon,
the bodies of these Turkish soldiers seemed strangely out of place, for
the peace and calm of an Oriental night covered this part of the
city.”</p>
<p>But it takes remarkably little time for the average person to become
desensitized to the horror of war, and in this William Yale was to prove
no exception. The following day, only his sixth on the battlefield, he
and Major de Sambouy were driving down the Palestine coastal road when
they began passing column after column of Turkish prisoners being
marched off to internment camps. In their wake were scores of prisoners
who had collapsed, too exhausted or ill to go on. Of these men being
left behind to die in the sun, neither their comrades nor their Indian
captors took any notice, and neither did Yale or his traveling
companion. “It was not our affair and we had a long day’s journey ahead
of us,” he would write. “It never occurred to me that we were
heartlessly callous and unconcerned. We didn’t even think of stopping to
take an extra passenger or two.”</p>
<p>THEY CAME UPON the first survivors hiding in the tall grass of a
meadow just outside Tafas. Traumatized and speaking in hushed whispers,
the villagers told of the atrocities the Turkish soldiers had begun
perpetrating immediately upon entering Tafas just an hour before.
Continuing on, Lawrence and the Arab vanguard soon found evidence of
this; here and there, bodies lay amid the meadow grass, “embracing the
ground in the close way of corpses.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a little girl of three or four popped into view, her smock
drenched in blood from a gash by her neck. “The child ran a few steps,”
Lawrence recalled, “then stood and cried to us in a tone of astonishing
strength (all else being very silent), ‘Don’t hit me, Baba.’” A moment
later, the girl collapsed, presumably dead.</p>
<p>None of this prepared for the scene in Tafas’s streets. Everywhere
were bodies, many hideously mutilated, girls and women obviously raped
before their dispatch. In particular, Lawrence was to remember the sight
of a naked pregnant woman, bent over a low wall and grotesquely impaled
by a saw bayonet; around her lay some twenty others, “variously killed,
but set out in accord with an obscene taste.”</p>
<p>By bad coincidence, one of the tribal sheikhs who had accompanied
Lawrence during the previous two weeks and who now rode alongside him
was Talal el Hareidhin, the headman of Tafas. As Lawrence would recount
in his official report of the incident, at the sight of his ruined
village, Talal “gave a horrible cry, wrapped his headcloth about his
face, put spurs to his horse and, rocking in the saddle, galloped at
full speed into the midst of the retiring [Turkish] column and fell,
himself and his mare, riddled with machine gun bullets among their lance
points.”</p>
<p>In consultation with Auda Abu Tayi, who had also ridden into Tafas
that morning, Lawrence commanded his lieutenants that no prisoners
should be taken—or, as he put it more eloquently in Seven Pillars,
“ ‘the best of you brings me the most Turkish dead.’”</p>
<p>What ensued over that long day of September 27 was a merciless and
one-sided slaughter. Quite quickly, the attacking Arabs separated the
fleeing Turkish column of two thousand into three isolated sections,
then set to annihilating them one by one; any Turkish or German soldier
who fell out wounded or tried to surrender was swiftly cut down. Soon
the pursuing Arabs were joined by villagers along the way, eager to
strike against their oppressors of the past four years—and perhaps just
as eager to strip their bodies of valuables. Even by the standards of
massacre, this one took on an especially macabre edge. “There lay on us
a madness,” Lawrence recounted in Seven Pillars, “born of the horror of
Tafas or of its story, so that we killed and killed, even blowing in the
heads of the fallen and of the animals, as though their death and
running blood could slake the agony in our brains.”</p>
<p>It grew worse. By chance, one of the Arab reserve columns had missed
the “no quarter” order, and when a doubling-back Lawrence came upon this
unit just before nightfall, he found they had taken some 250 Turkish and
German soldiers captive. According to his Seven Pillars account,
Lawrence was “not unwilling” to let this group live, until he was led
over to a dying Arab warrior gruesomely pinioned to the ground by German
bayonets, “like a collected insect.” As Lawrence would state in his
official report, written just days after the incident, “then we turned
our Hotchkiss [machine gun] on the prisoners and made an end of them,
they saying nothing.”</p>
<p>All night and into the following days the slaughter went on, the
panicked and exhausted prey becoming divided into smaller and smaller
groups until they were quite defenseless against their attackers, a
fortunate few taken prisoner, many more summarily put to death. By the
time the last stragglers approached the outskirts of Damascus two days
later, the estimated six thousand Turkish and German soldiers who had
set out from the Deraa area on September 27 had been reduced to fewer
than two thousand.</p>
<p>Lawrence didn’t partake of this further massacre. Instead, late that
night, he turned back for his command post in Sheikh Saad and then, at
dawn, made for the town of his past torments: Deraa. By his account in
Seven Pillars, the time he spent there was rather anticlimactic,
especially when placed against the horrific events of Tafas. An Arab
force had swept into Deraa the previous afternoon and, after rounding up
those few Turkish soldiers who remained, spent the interim in the
time-honored tradition of looting and pillaging. In quick order,
Lawrence managed to stem the anarchy, placing armed guards over what
remained of the railyard and its worksheds and helping with the
appointment of a governor and police force. Indeed, by Lawrence’s
telling, the greatest challenge he faced in Deraa that day was heading
off the bellicose ambitions of General George Barrow, the commander of
the British army that had just finished its climb out of the Yarmuk
gorge.</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Barrow comes off as a distinctly buffoonish figure,
one whose comeuppance began the moment Lawrence came out of Deraa on the
western road to greet him. To the general’s plan of imposing calm in the
town by posting pickets throughout, Lawrence “explained gently” that
calm had already been established by the newly appointed Arab governor.
When Barrow then insisted his men take possession of the Deraa railway
station, Lawrence assented, but with the rather haughty request that the
British not interfere with the railroad’s functioning, since the Arabs
had already cleared the line and were readying a train for travel.
“Barrow,” Lawrence wrote, “who had come in thinking of [the Arabs] as a
conquered people, though dazed at my calm assumption that he was my
guest, had no option but to follow the lead of such assurance.” With the
general thus sufficiently humbled, Lawrence recounted, “soon we got on
well.”</p>
<p>But this was not at all the way George Barrow would remember the
situation in Deraa that day. As he would relate in his own memoir, “The
whole place was indescribably filthy, defiled and littered with
smoldering cinders and the soiled leavings of loot. Turks, some dead and
some dying, lay about the railway station or sat propped against the
houses. Those still living gazed at us with eyes that begged for a
little of the mercy which it was hopeless for them to ask of the
Arabs.”</p>
<p>But this was trivial compared with what Barrow’s men found when they
entered the Turkish hospital train that had been stranded in Deraa
station, a scene he would describe, with considerable hyperbole, as “far
exceeding in its savagery anything that has been known in the conflicts
between nations during the past 120 years.” According to Barrow, “Arab
soldiers were going through the train, tearing off the clothing of the
groaning and stricken Turks, regardless of gaping wounds and broken
limbs, and cutting their victims’ throats.… It was a sight that no
average civilized human being could bear unmoved.” In Barrow’s telling,
when he angrily ordered Lawrence to remove the Arabs from the train, he
was met with a refusal and the explanation that this was the Arabs’
“idea of war.”</p>
<p>“It is not our idea of war,” Barrow countered, “and if you can’t
remove them, I will.” At this, Lawrence allegedly washed his hands of
the matter, telling the general he would take no responsibility for what
might happen next. Summoning his own men, Barrow cleared the ambulance
train and brought the killing to a stop.</p>
<p>Taken together, the events in Tafas and Deraa encapsulate the
difficulty in getting at the full truth of the “Lawrence myth”—or even
to isolate which facet of that myth is the most credible. In Lawrence’s
Seven Pillars description of Tafas, the skeptical reader might find some
moments just a little too cinematic to be fully believed—the stirring
war cry that the charging Talal delivered just before he was gunned
down, the accusing gaze the bayonet-pinioned Arab warrior cast toward
his German and Turkish tormentors with his dying breath—especially since
those moments are absent from Lawrence’s official report. There is also
his uncomfortably keen eye for the grisly detail, reminiscent of the
passage describing his torture in Deraa the year before, that edges
toward prurience and war pornography. To add a different wrinkle, after
the war, several of Lawrence’s British comrades in the September 1918
offensive would stoutly maintain that he never issued a “no quarter”
command, let alone ordered the execution of prisoners once taken, even
though Lawrence plainly stated as much in both his memoir and official
report.</p>
<p>The Deraa ambulance train story underscores this difficulty in
reverse. As shockingly candid as Lawrence was in describing his actions
at Tafas, in neither Seven Pillars nor in his official report did he
even mention the train incident—yet it’s hard to imagine George Barrow,
a very “proper” career military officer, simply making up such an
account. If the incident did in fact occur, the simplest explanation for
its omission is that Lawrence wished to avoid casting the Arab rebels in
a bad light—except that there are any number of other places in Seven
Pillars and his wartime reports where their conduct is shown in equally
bad light. And if, for whatever reason, Lawrence did consciously choose
to avoid telling the story, then why go out of his way in Seven Pillars
to disparage the reputation of the one man, Barrow, best positioned to
publicize it? Of course, to all this there may be a simpler, if more
disturbing, explanation: that amid the wanton slaughter of those last
days in September, Lawrence merely found the ambulance train incident
too trifling to mention.</p>
<p>Lawrence stayed on in Deraa in order to meet with Faisal, who came
over from Azraq the following day. By then, Allenby’s stricture against
the Arabs making for Damascus had been lifted in light of the Turkish
army’s total collapse—in fact, he had ordered all EEF units to stay out
of the Syrian capital so that their Arab allies might have the honor of
entering first—and Lawrence and Faisal discussed plans for establishing
a provisional government there. Then, in the very early morning hours of
September 30, Lawrence and his sometime driver of recent days, Major
Walter Stirling, set off north in the Rolls-Royce sedan they had dubbed
the “Blue Mist.” They drove through a landscape littered with the
corpses of men and animals, some of those who had perished in the Turks’
desperate flight. By that evening, they had reached a ridge overlooking
Damascus, a promontory already crowded with Arab and EEF units poised to
advance into the city at first light.</p>
<p>During that night of waiting, Stirling watched as Lawrence sank into
a mood of deep despondency. To the junior officer, it seemed quite
incomprehensible—“we were on the eve of our entry into Damascus,”
Stirling wrote, “and in sight of the final act which was to crown all
[Lawrence’s] efforts with success”—and he finally asked his companion
what was the matter. “Ever since we took Deraa,” Lawrence replied, “the
end has been inevitable. Now the zest has gone, and the interest.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT ridge outside Damascus, William Yale and the
Italian military attaché were also camped that night, wrapped in
blankets on the ground beside their Model T as they tried to catch a few
hours’ sleep. Shortly after midnight, they were ripped from their
slumber by a tremendous explosion; to the north, an enormous cloud of
smoke and flame rose above Damascus, the countryside for miles around
illuminated in its intense glow. “God Almighty,” Yale said, “the Turks
have blown up Damascus.” That first great explosion was followed by many
smaller ones throughout the night, geysers of flame and bursting shells
arcing across the sky.</p>
<p>At dawn, Yale saw that his fears were misplaced, that Damascus still
stood; the Turks and Germans had only been blowing up their ammunition
and fuel storage depots before they fled the city.</p>
<p>Quite by chance, Yale and de Sambouy had camped that night beside the
same band of journalists who had disappeared on them at General
Headquarters on the eve of the offensive, and for some time that morning
the reunited campmates discussed among themselves whether it might be
safe to venture down into Damascus. The matter was rather decided when
Yale, having briefly gone in search of water for coffee, returned to
discover that the journalists had ditched them once again. “Where a
correspondent goes,” he told de Sambouy, “an attaché can go.” Jumping in
the Model T, they made for the city.</p>
<p>They were plunged into a riotous celebration. In the streets, joyous
crowds of Damascenes sang and danced and beat on drums, and as Arab
warriors on horses and camels fired their rifles into the air, women on
overhead balconies showered them all with rose petals. The deeper the
attachés ventured toward the city center, the more delirious the scenes
became. “Pandemonium reigned,” Yale recalled. “I, who had lived nearly
three years in Palestine under the strain and in fear of the Turks,
could share the madness of the Arabs with the added exhilaration of
being one of the host of deliverers.… We were invited into people’s
homes and had wines and sweetmeats urged upon us. It was a wild hectic
day, the like of which a man is fortunate to experience but once in a
lifetime.”</p>
<p>Lawrence was also experiencing the madness of Damascus that day, if
to much weightier effect. Far earlier than the journalists or the
attachés, he and Stirling had set off for the city in the “Blue Mist,”
only to be detained for several hours by an Indian army guard suspicious
of their Arab headdresses. The delay nearly proved disastrous, for when
Lawrence finally reached Damascus city hall, the gathering point for the
Arab rebel leaders coming into the city, he discovered something of a
coup in progress.</p>
<p>As Faisal’s lieutenants at city hall had set to establishing a
provisional government that morning, they had been joined by two men who
claimed to have already done so the night before; what’s more, these
interlopers maintained, they were King Hussein’s rightful
representatives in Damascus. Lawrence knew the two men well: they were
Abd el Kader, the Algerian traitor who had nearly gotten him killed at
Yarmuk, and his brother, Mohammed Said. Within a few minutes, the
brothers and their followers left city hall, but in hindsight probably
wished they hadn’t. In their absence, Lawrence summarily dismissed their
claim to authority and appointed another man, Shukri Pasha el-Ayubi, as
the interim Damascus military governor.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s timing was impeccable for, just minutes later, General
Henry Chauvel, the Australian commander of the EEF’s Desert Mounted
Corps, showed up at city hall. As the first senior EEF commander to
enter Damascus, Chauvel was under instructions from Allenby to find the
wali, the Turkish-appointed governor, and ask him to temporarily
continue running the city. Instead, at city hall Chauvel was met by
Lawrence, who quickly led him to Shukri Pasha. “I understood that this
official was the Wali,” Chauvel subsequently reported to Allenby, “and I
issued him instructions through Lt. Col. Lawrence to carry on the civil
administration of the city, and informed him that I would find any
military guards and police that he required.” Quite completing this
sleight of hand, Chauvel then asked Lawrence “to assist in these
matters, because I had no Political Officer at the moment at my
disposal.”</p>
<p>What it meant was that in one deft move, Lawrence had established the
legitimacy of his personally chosen Arab “government” in the eyes of the
EEF military authorities. It also meant that for the next crucial few
days, he would be the de facto ruler of Damascus, able to draw on EEF
troops if needed, able to direct the Arabs through the “office” of the
military governor as required.</p>
<p>His first order of business was to neutralize the continuing threat
posed by Abd el Kader and Mohammed Said. Summoning the brothers to city
hall, he informed them that their government had been abolished, and
named a number of Faisal loyalists to positions of authority in its
place. After a tense confrontation that almost led to knifeplay,
Lawrence recounted, “Mohammed Said and Abd el Kader then went away,
breathing vengeance against me as a Christian.” Shortly afterward,
Lawrence had EEF troops called out to quell looting that was occurring
in several parts of the city.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, with some degree of calm restored and Faisal
loyalists now in control, Lawrence dropped by Chauvel’s office to allow
that perhaps there’d been some misunderstanding at their earlier
meeting, that Shukri Pasha was not in fact the Damascus wali, but rather
Lawrence’s own very recent appointee. But if this was couched as a
clarification, Lawrence was also presenting Chauvel with a dare; with
Damascus still a very tense place, the general could either accept the
current arrangement or come up with his own idea and risk the
consequences. Henry Chauvel already disliked Lawrence, but apparently
disliked the prospect of urban insurrection even more; that evening,
Lawrence was able to send his own cable off to Allenby’s headquarters
announcing that Chauvel “agrees with my carrying on with the town
administration until further instructions.”</p>
<p>This he proceeded to do for the next two days, and with a curious
marriage of munificence to severity. Even with looting persisting in
certain quarters, municipal work crews were set to restoring the city’s
electrical system and waterworks. Garbage was collected, a fire brigade
organized, food distributed to the destitute, at the same time that new
disturbances in the city center—purportedly the result of another power
bid by Abd el Kader and his brother—necessitated a firmer hand. “We
called out the Arab troops,” Lawrence blandly noted in his official
report, “put Hotchkiss [machine guns] round the central square, and
imposed peace in three hours after inflicting about twenty
casualties.”</p>
<p>Given their very different roles, it’s not surprising that the paths
of T. E. Lawrence and William Yale intersected just once during those
tumultuous days in Damascus. It’s also understandable, given the weight
of issues he was dealing with, that Lawrence would have no memory of
their meeting; Yale sought him out in order to complain about the
looting of some shops owned by American citizens. Yet the two would
ultimately be joined by a shared experience in Damascus. It was a place
of such unspeakable horror that both would be forever scarred by it, a
place known simply as “the Turkish hospital.”</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of October 2, an Australian officer approached William
Yale in the lobby of his Damascus hotel to ask if he had seen “the
Turkish hospital.” Not familiar with the site, Yale was given directions
to a compound near the railway station, and he and Major de Sambouy soon
made for it.</p>
<p>It was actually a Turkish army barracks fronted by a large parade
ground. Once past the two Australian sentries at the front gate, Yale
recalled, “we crossed the vacant parade ground without seeing a person,
climbed the steps and entered what was a charnel house.”</p>
<p>The Turks had converted the barracks into a makeshift military
hospital, but had abandoned it on September 29 amid their general exodus
from the city, leaving behind some eight hundred wounded or diseased
men. In the intervening three days, those men had been set upon by Arab
marauders who had stripped the place bare of food and medicine, even
tossing many of the invalids onto the floor in their search for
concealed valuables. Other than posting sentries at the front gate, the
Australian detachment that had pitched camp nearby had done nothing for
the desperate and dying patients, neglecting even to bring them
water.</p>
<p>“The floors were slimy with human offal,” Yale recounted, “hundreds
of men lay in small soiled hospital cots everywhere. The dead, the
wounded, the sick [were] lying side by side in their own filth, save for
the corpses on the floor and those who, writhing in agony, had fallen
off their cots.… Most of them suffered in silence; some moaned, others
cried to us pitifully, their tragic eyes filled with terror, following
us as we walked the length of the room.”</p>
<p>Somehow compounding the horror, in a small alcove above the main
floor Yale and de Sambouy found three nurse-orderlies mutely sitting
about a table drinking coffee. “My impression was that they were badly
frightened, hopeless beings who, faced with a horrible and impossible
situation, had lost all capacity to act. They sat drinking coffee in a
hell beyond the ken of one’s imagination.” Seeing enough, the attachés
fled the barracks building and set out in search of someone in
authority—although just what constituted authority that day in Damascus
was not completely clear.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence learned of the Turkish hospital that same afternoon,
and also made for it. He found a scene very much as Yale described,
although, in his more accomplished hand, the macabre details would be
far more graphically rendered: rats had gnawed “wet red galleries” into
the bodies of the dead, many of which “were already swollen twice or
thrice life-width, their fat heads laughing with black mouth.… Of others
the softer parts were fallen in. A few had burst open, and were
liquescent with decay.”</p>
<p>Venturing deep into the room, Lawrence charted a path between the
dead and dying, “holding my white skirts about me [so as] not to dip my
bare feet in their puddled running, when suddenly I heard a sigh.”
Turning, he met the gaze of a still-living man, who whispered, “Aman,
aman (pity).” That call was quickly joined by others, and then by a
“brown waver” as some of the men tried to raise beseeching hands—“a thin
fluttering like withered leaves”—before they fell back again. “No one of
them had strength to speak,” Lawrence recalled, “but there was something
which made me laugh at their whispering in unison, as if by
command.”</p>
<p>In Lawrence’s telling, he immediately took command of the hideous
situation. Finding a group of Turkish doctors idly sitting in an
upstairs room, he ordered them down to the sick ward. Refused help from
the adjacent Australian encampment, he instead had Arab troops bring
food and water, then press-ganged a group of Turkish prisoners to dig a
mass grave for the dead. Even here, though, Lawrence couldn’t resist the
gruesome detail. “The trench was small for them,” he noted of the men
being buried, “but so fluid was the mass that each newcomer, when tipped
in, fell softly, just jellying out the edges of the pile a little with
his weight.”</p>
<p>In his own effort to address the tragedy at the Turkish hospital,
Yale eventually tracked down the recently arrived Gilbert Clayton. Over
the course of their dealings in Cairo, Yale had developed a keen
distaste for the brigadier general, finding him a cold and hard man, and
nothing in Clayton’s manner at their meeting on the night of October 2
changed that view. After hearing out the attaché’s impassioned plea for
something to be done, Clayton calmly said, “Yale, you’re not a military
man.” Seeing the rage building in Yale’s eyes, he then added, “You need
not be offended; I’m not a soldier either.”</p>
<p>So deeply did the Turkish hospital incident affect Lawrence and Yale
that it would dominate the one dialogue they were to have in the postwar
era, an exchange of letters in 1929. While Yale’s initiating letter has
been lost, he clearly pressed Lawrence for details on the subject,
considering that fully a third of Lawrence’s handwritten reply—some four
hundred words—was devoted to explaining his own actions at the hospital.
The episode would also figure prominently in both men’s memoirs and, in
the process, offer an intriguing glimpse into their very different
personalities.</p>
<p>For William Yale, the guilt he felt over the Turkish hospital was to
make for perhaps the most heartfelt and anguished passage in his
manuscript. “Nothing I did during the whole war period do I regret so
deeply and with such shame as my failure to use my position wisely and
calmly to alleviate the atrocious suffering of those eight hundred men.
May their curses be upon my head.” But self-recrimination was never one
of Yale’s strong suits, and after just two more sentences, he’d settled
on a new culprit to blame. “I lay this horror at the door of European
imperialism, to be added to the multitude of crimes already committed in
its name.”</p>
<p>As might be expected, Lawrence’s description in Seven Pillars, in
addition to being far more visceral, was also—perhaps unconsciously—far
more self-revelatory. By that account, Lawrence returned to the hospital
the next day to find conditions vastly improved as a result of his
efforts, only to be confronted by an irate Australian major. Clad in his
Arab robes, Lawrence didn’t bother to identify himself as a lieutenant
colonel, even when the junior officer demanded to know who was in charge
of the still-ghastly scene. When Lawrence acknowledged he was in charge,
the Australian major spat “bloody brute,” slapped Lawrence across the
face, and stormed off.</p>
<p>If that is a rather peculiar passage to appear on the penultimate
page of a 660-page book that has as its subtitle “A Triumph,” there is
also something about the moment that somehow rings a bit false; as with
some of the Tafas details, it feels just a little too neat, too much of
a stage-play coda. Yet, fictional or not, that major’s slap served a
great function, for it left Lawrence “more ashamed than angry, for in my
heart I felt he was right, and that anyone who pushed through to success
a rebellion of the weak against their masters must come out of it so
stained in estimation that, afterward, nothing in the world would make
him feel clean.”</p>
<p>For the remainder of his life, Lawrence was to feel stained by what
he had seen and done during the war, and in his struggle to ever “feel
clean” again, repeatedly looked to self-abnegation and violence against
himself—violence far worse than a major’s slap—as recompense for his
sins.</p>
<p>THE MEETING TOOK place in a second-floor stateroom of the finest
hotel in Damascus, the Victoria, on the afternoon of October 3. Just
eight men were present: on the British side, Generals Allenby and
Chauvel, together with their chiefs of staff; on the Arab side, Faisal
ibn Hussein, his chief of staff, Nuri Said, and Sherif Nasir of Medina.
Acting as intermediary and interpreter was T. E. Lawrence. Despite its
profound importance—in that stateroom much of the future history, and
tragedy, of the Middle East was to be set in motion—no official record
was kept.</p>
<p>General Allenby had arrived in the Syrian capital just hours earlier.
Never the most patient of men, he was in a particularly cantankerous
mood that day. With his offensive still ongoing—his vanguard was
continuing a relentless pursuit of the Turks as they fled north—he’d
been forced to take time away from his martial duties to sort out the
increasingly nettlesome political situation in Damascus. As a result,
when informed that Faisal, arriving on a three o’clock train from Deraa,
would be slow in reaching the Victoria on account of his planned
triumphal entry into the city on horseback, Allenby had thundered,
“Triumphal entry be damned,” and ordered Faisal to be brought to the
hotel at once.</p>
<p>Although the general may not have been fully aware of it—or more
likely was too distracted to care—the astounding initial success of his
Palestinian offensive had caused the French government to frantically
reassert their claims to Syria as codified in the Sykes-Picot Agreement;
on September 23, the British government had largely acquiesced to their
demands. The result was that two days later Allenby received a set of
instructions from the Foreign Office so obtuse as to be nearly
nonsensical. After stating that “the British Government adhere to their
declared policy with regard to Syria, namely that should it fall into
the sphere of interest of any European Power, that Power should be
France,” the September 25 instructions reminded Allenby that under the
terms of Sykes-Picot, “you will notice that France and Britain undertake
to uphold jointly the independence of any Arab State that may be set up
in Area (A)”—meaning Syria. From these two seemingly opposed clauses
arose an appropriately muddled proposed course of action, that “if
General Allenby advances to Damascus, it would be most desirable that,
in conformity with the Anglo-French Agreement of 1916 he should, if
possible, work through an Arab administration by means of a French
liaison.”</p>
<p>With London apparently deciding these instructions weren’t
sufficiently baffling, they were followed on October 1 by a second set
that rather settled the matter. Now Allenby was told that since “the
belligerent status of the Arabs fighting for the liberation of their
territories from Turkish rule” had been recognized by the Allied powers,
“the regions so liberated [by the Arabs] should properly be treated as
Allied territory enjoying the status of an independent State (or
confederation of States) of friendly Arabs.” A sudden burst of clarity,
perhaps, except this statement was followed by the curious rider that
should “the Arab authorities [in Syria] request the assistance or advice
of European functionaries, we are bound under the Anglo-French Agreement
to let these be French.” In essence, it appeared Sykes-Picot was being
invoked to annul and uphold the accord simultaneously, the intent
changing from one sentence to the next.</p>
<p>In first hearing of this hash at the Victoria Hotel, Lawrence
undoubtedly felt a note of alarm. It was his understanding that
Sykes-Picot was a dead letter, and had been for quite some time; for it
to return to the conversation now for any purpose was ominous. On the
positive side, Allenby’s instructions explicitly recognized the Arab
claim to Syrian independence, and since Faisal had no intention of
asking for European assistance or advice—that had been the whole point
of establishing an interim government—it surely meant the rider about a
French liaison officer was moot.</p>
<p>But matters were about to take a very ugly turn—or rather, a series
of ugly turns. As recounted by General Chauvel, Allenby announced that
Faisal actually didn’t have any choice in the matter, that France was to
be the “protecting power” of Syria. Additionally, even though Faisal, as
his father’s representative, “was to have the administration of
Syria”—albeit “under French guidance and financial backing”—that
administration didn’t extend to either Palestine or Lebanon, but “would
include the hinterland of Syria only.” “Hinterland” was truly the
operative word since, as Faisal was further informed, the boundaries of
Lebanon had now been demarcated as the entire Mediterranean coastline
from Palestine to the Gulf of Alexandretta, making Syria a landlocked
nation. As a final insult, Allenby told Faisal that he would be
immediately assigned a French liaison officer, “who would work for the
present with Lawrence, who would be expected to give him every
assistance.”</p>
<p>Both Faisal and Lawrence were stunned. As Chauvel recounted, Faisal
fiercely argued that it was his understanding “from the advisor whom
Allenby had sent him”—meaning Lawrence—that in return for ceding
Palestine, “the Arabs were to have the whole of Syria, including the
Lebanon.” Furthermore, he flatly refused to have a French liaison
officer attached to him, “or to recognize French guidance in any
way.”</p>
<p>At this tense impasse, Allenby turned to Lawrence. “But did you not
tell him that the French were to have the Protectorate over Syria?”</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Lawrence responded, according to Chauvel, “I know nothing
about it.”</p>
<p>“But you knew definitely that he, Faisal, was to have nothing to do
with the Lebanon?” Allenby persisted.</p>
<p>“No, sir,” Lawrence replied, “I did not.”</p>
<p>Allenby tried to defuse the situation by offering that these were
only temporary measures, that all would be resolved at the great postwar
peace conference being planned, but Faisal would have none of it; he
knew full well that temporary measures in such circumstances had a
tendency to become permanent ones. It left the British commander with
only military rank to fall back on. Allenby reminded Faisal that,
technically, both he and the Arab Northern Army remained under his
overall command; as a result, the rebel leader had no choice but to obey
orders.</p>
<p>After perhaps an hour, a shaken Faisal Hussein left the Victoria
Hotel, to be greeted, ironically, by an enormous crowd of supporters.
Lawrence did not accompany him. Instead, he stayed behind in the hotel
stateroom to make a request of General Allenby.</p>
<p>THE DAM HAD burst. Through the rest of October, the EEF and their
Arab allies pursued the remnants of the Turkish armies north, swiftly
overwhelming whatever rearguard resistance the enemy could offer. It
wasn’t until the end of the month that Turkish general Mustafa Kemal,
the future Kemal Ataturk, finally managed to establish a new defensive
line at the very edge of the Turkish Anatolian heartland. By then,
though, all of Syria was gone and the Constantinople regime was suing
for peace. That culminated in the Armistice of Mudros on October 31; at
just about the same time, the fallen Three Pashas—Djemal, Enver, and
Talaat—slipped aboard a German torpedo boat and made their escape across
the Black Sea.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just the Turkish dam that had burst. In one of the more
peculiar chain reactions in history, given that their military efforts
had been largely autonomous, all the Central Powers had come to their
breaking points at precisely the same moment, and all now fell
together—Bulgaria at the end of September, and then Turkey and
Austro-Hungary in the span of a mere six days. As might be expected,
Germany held out the longest, but only by the matter of a week. With
their vaunted Hindenburg Line overrun in a half dozen places and their
soldiers surrendering en masse, in the early morning hours of November
11, German negotiators met with their Allied counterparts in a railroad
car in a French forest to sign papers of armistice, scheduled to take
effect at 11 a.m. that same day. In a fittingly obscene finale to this
most senseless of wars, a number of Western Front units continued to
fight right up until that eleventh hour was struck, with the result that
some four thousand more soldiers died on the last morning of the
war.</p>
<p>Curt Prüfer had observed much of this staggering cascade of events
from the vantage point of Switzerland, to which he had crossed in late
September. Even as all fell down around him, the German spymaster had
continued with his scheme to try to woo the wayward eldest son of Abbas
Hilmi back into the Central Powers’ fold, the keystone, in some
inscrutable way, toward forging a German-Turkish-Egyptian alliance that
might yet ride to triumph in the Middle East. A mentally unstable sadist
Abdel Moneim may well have been, but he still had enough wits about him
in October 1918 to realize that his German suitor’s scheme was
ludicrous. At the end of that month, an empty-handed Prüfer crossed back
over to Germany, just in time to witness the final fall of his beloved
Fatherland.</p>
<p>For a time, Aaron Aaronsohn had also been a distant observer of the
events of that autumn—in his case, from the even farther remove of the
United States. In mid-October, however, with the downfall of the Central
Powers clearly imminent, he hurried aboard a passenger ship in New York
for the return to England. Once Turkey and Germany capitulated,
Aaronsohn knew, all attention would turn to the international peace
conference being planned in Paris, and he was determined to make his
presence there known, to press for the promises given to the Zionists in
the Balfour Declaration.</p>
<p>By contrast, William Yale experienced the climax of the war
firsthand. Through October, he followed the victorious British army
north through Syria, and was in Aleppo when news of the German armistice
came. Afterward, he made his way back to Cairo, not at all sure what his
future held. Reluctant to go home, but with little to do in Egypt, he
fixated on trying to get himself attached in some capacity to the
American delegation at the upcoming Paris Peace Conference. “I
feverishly wrote report after report,” he recounted, “hoping that
through them I could persuade someone to order me to Paris. My reports
grew poorer and poorer.”</p>
<p>That decline in quality apparently did the trick, for in late
December Yale received a cable ordering him to the French capital. He
was to report there to the American Commission to Negotiate Peace, to
serve as their “expert on Arabian affairs.” As Yale would write in a
moment of rare modesty, “the title flabbergasted me.”</p>
<p>Paradoxically, of the various spies and intelligence agents who had
parried with one another across the Middle East over the previous few
years, the one most completely removed from events at the war’s close
was T. E. Lawrence. He had ensured that on the afternoon of October 3,
in the second-floor stateroom of the Victoria Hotel in Damascus.</p>
<p>Once Faisal had left that room after his meeting with Allenby,
Lawrence had turned to the general and requested to be given leave.
Apparently, Allenby initially assumed it was a request for a few days’
rest—that was easy enough to arrange and certainly well deserved—but
Lawrence clarified that he wanted to leave altogether, to go home to
England. At first, Allenby flatly refused; the Syrian campaign was still
a very active one, it relied greatly on British officers whom the Arabs
trusted, and they trusted no one more than Lieutenant Colonel
Lawrence.</p>
<p>According to Henry Chauvel, Lawrence then raised the stakes
considerably by telling Allenby “that he would not work with a French
Liaison officer, and that he was due for leave and thought he had better
take it now and go off to England.” Whether in anger at Lawrence’s
insubordination or in respect at his sense of honor—the accounts of
Chauvel and Lawrence differ on this—Allenby finally relented. “Yes,” he
told Lawrence, “I think you had.”</p>
<p>Since late 1916, Lawrence had waged a quiet war against his own
government, and now he had lost. What would soon become clear, however,
was that he intended to continue that fight off the battlefield, in the
conference halls and meeting rooms of peacetime Paris. He may have asked
to leave Damascus out of exhaustion, but it was also to prepare for the
next round in the struggle for Arab independence.</p>
<p>The following afternoon, Lawrence was conducted out of Damascus. He
was leaving the city he had invoked as a battle cry for two years. One
hundred and fifty miles to the northeast of Damascus lay Jerablus, the
place where he had spent the happiest days of his life. To Damascus or
Jerablus, Lawrence would never return.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Blast the Lawrence side of things. He was a cad I’ve killed.</p>
<p>T. E. SHAW, ALIAS OF T. E. LAWRENCE, TO H. C. ARMSTRONG, OCTOBER 6,
1924</p>
<p>Everything T. E. Lawrence had fought for, schemed for, arguably
betrayed his country for, turned to ashes in a single five-minute
conversation between the prime ministers of Great Britain and France. In
London on the morning of December 1, 1918, David Lloyd George took aside
a visiting Georges Clemenceau and bluntly outlined just what Britain
wanted in the Middle East: Iraq and Palestine. In tacit exchange,
although Lloyd George would always deny it, France would have free rein
in Syria. It was a proposed “solution” to the spoils-of-war contest that
had strained British and French relations ever since they had cast their
covetous eyes toward the Middle East, and that had now taken on great
urgency; with the Great War finally over and the Paris Peace Conference
about to begin, it was vital that Britain and France present a unified
front against the American president, Woodrow Wilson, with his
high-minded talk of a “peace without victory” and the rights of
oppressed peoples to self-determination. Faced with this imminent
American threat, Clemenceau quickly acceded to Lloyd George’s
proposal.</p>
<p>In essence, the two imperial victors had not only affirmed the basic
structure of the Sykes-Picot Agreement but gone beyond it, giving
themselves more and the Arabs even less. But in the time-honored
tradition of European secret deals, it was to be a while before anyone
outside the British and French prime ministers’ closest circles would
have any knowledge of that extraordinary accord. Certainly T. E.
Lawrence had no intimation of it.</p>
<p>What followed in Paris was a yearlong shadow play that first raised
hopes of a new era in relations between nations, Woodrow Wilson’s
vaunted “new world order,” only to degenerate into backroom deals,
vengeful treaties, and arbitrary borders. Many books, foremost among
them Margaret MacMillan’s definitive Paris 1919, have been written about
the Paris Peace Conference and the immensely complicated maneuverings of
great powers and nationalist supplicants. As far as the Middle East was
concerned, the byzantine machinations meant, in the end, virtually
nothing. “The Great Loot,” the carving up of the carcass of the Ottoman
Empire, would now come to pass.</p>
<p>Not that Lawrence did not try mightily to advance the Arab cause.
Acting as Faisal’s counselor during the Paris talks, he constantly
floated schemes to give them control of the lands they had fought so
fiercely for, while he also lobbied senior British statesmen and wrote
passionate editorials in the Arabs’ defense. But Lawrence’s usefulness
to the British government had ended. In an exquisite irony, at precisely
the same time he was becoming a household name in Britain—an estimated
one million Britons, including the king and queen, would flock to see
Lowell Thomas’s lecture show “With Allenby in Palestine, and Lawrence in
Arabia”—government officials were penning memos calling Lawrence “a
malign influence,” and “to a large extent responsible for our troubles
with the French over Syria.” Finally, he was simply stripped of his
credentials at Paris and barred from assisting Faisal in the talks.
Lawrence had lost the peace.</p>
<p>There was at least one extraordinary aspect of Lawrence’s diplomatic
efforts, however, that bears emphasis. Having long known that control of
the Palestine portion of Syria was lost to the Arabs, Lawrence and
Faisal sought an ally to affirm their nationalist aspirations for the
rest of it. They found such an ally in Chaim Weizmann. By the close of
1918, the Zionists had strong patrons in both the British and American
governments, but what made those governments nervous was the
continuing—in fact, growing—hostility of the Palestinian Arab population
to the Zionists’ goals. So what if Hashemite support for the Zionist
program in Palestine could be traded for Zionist support of an
independent Arab Syria? Over the course of that December, Lawrence,
Faisal, and Weizmann worked out the details for such a mutually
beneficial relationship, culminating in a joint proclamation on the eve
of the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
<p>In that proclamation, Faisal and Weizmann announced their intention
to work together in Paris, and in recognition of each other’s claims.
Surely the most controversial of the nine articles of the
Faisal-Weizmann Agreement was the fourth: “All necessary measures shall
be taken to encourage and stimulate immigration of Jews into Palestine
on a large scale.” To this document, Faisal—or more likely, Lawrence—had
inserted a key closing proviso. The agreement was only valid so long as
Syrian independence was achieved; barring that, it was null and
void.</p>
<p>Yet in their desperation to find a supporting partner at the peace
conference, Lawrence and Faisal had chosen to ignore several crucial
details. While the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement offered a fairly detailed
outline for the administration of Palestine, nowhere did it specify what
Palestine actually consisted of. Further, in reaching his accord with
Weizmann, Faisal had quite flagrantly turned his back on the doctrine of
self-determination for Palestine, placing him in a weakened—some would
say hypocritical—position in invoking that same doctrine for the rest of
Syria. Most troublesome, Chaim Weizmann had recently made public just
what he and other Zionists envisioned as the future status of Palestine.
“The establishment of a National Home for the Jewish people,” he had
announced in mid-November, “is understood to mean that the country of
Palestine should be placed under such political, economic and moral
conditions as will favor the increase of the Jewish population, so that
in accordance with the principle of democracy, it may ultimately develop
into a Jewish Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>By going into partnership with the Zionists under such circumstances,
Faisal had just handed his more conservative Arab and Muslim rivals a
powerful weapon to use against him. One who would soon wield that weapon
to devastating effect was King Hussein’s chief rival in Arabia,
ibn-Saud, and his fundamentalist Wahhabist followers.</p>
<p>IN THE LAST sentence of his memoir, William Yale referred to the
Paris Peace Conference as “the prologue of the 20th century tragedy.”
Yale served as an expert on Middle Eastern affairs to the American
delegation in Paris and, like Lawrence, put forth great efforts to
achieve a sustainable peace in the region. As with his British
counterpart, with whom he sometimes aligned himself, these efforts were
thwarted at every turn.</p>
<p>Yale placed much of the blame on his own government. To him, the
grand enterprise in Paris seemed a rather perfect reflection of Woodrow
Wilson’s peculiar blend of idealism and arrogance. In the American
president’s almost comic fondness for tidy enumerated lists—his
“Fourteen Points” had been followed by his “Four Principles,” his “Four
Ends,” and finally his “Five Particulars”—was the hint of a simplistic
mind-set, as if solving the world’s myriad messy problems was merely a
matter of isolating them into their component parts and applying
quasi-mathematical principles. Nowhere was this more problematic than
when it came to Wilson’s cherished and oft-cited notion of
“self-determination.” While the phrase certainly sounded good, in the
mashed-together cultures of Europe and the Middle East of the early
twentieth century, where faith and ethnicity and nationalism were all
exerting tremendous and often opposing pulls, just whose claim to
self-determination was to win out over others? London and Paris had
repeatedly warned Wilson on the dangers of opening up this Pandora’s
box, but there had never been any indication that the president was
listening.</p>
<p>To William Yale’s mind, all of this was actually symptomatic of
perhaps the greatest paradox underlying the American role at the Paris
Peace Conference: Woodrow Wilson’s grand vision of a new world order
rested on a bedrock of profound ignorance. That was made clear on the
very day Yale arrived in Paris and met with his new supervisor, William
Westermann, and the other members of the American delegation’s Middle
Eastern research section. Granted, the Middle East was a lesser American
concern at the peace conference since the United States hadn’t gone to
war with Turkey, but it still struck Yale that Westermann, a classics
professor from the University of Wisconsin, might have rounded up a
panel with at least some familiarity with the region. Instead, they
included a specialist in Latin American studies, an American Indian
historian, a scholar on the Crusades, and two Persian linguistics
professors.</p>
<p>The picture was completed when Yale was handed a briefing book on
Syria, a 107-page compendium of historic, economic, and political data
that was serving as the principal guide in formulating American policy
in the region. The Report on the Desires of the Syrians didn’t require a
lot of study on Yale’s part; almost all the citations in those sections
dealing with events since 1914 were drawn from a single source, a State
Department special agent in Cairo named William Yale.</p>
<p>Several times Yale saw opportunities for championing the cause of
Arab self-determination, but they always slipped away on the tide of
American inaction. At a meeting with Faisal in mid-February 1919, Yale
was taken aback when the Arab leader bluntly proposed an American
mandate in Syria, vastly preferring the supposedly disinterested
Americans to the French. By then, however, Yale had already been with
the American delegation in Paris long enough to realize that, virtuous
principles aside, the Wilson administration was more interested in
dictating solutions to the rest of the world than in assuming any
responsibility of its own. And there was another problem, one that may
not have been readily apparent to non-Americans. Its brief burst of
international involvement notwithstanding, the United States was already
showing signs of sliding back into an isolationist spirit, with Wilson
and his Republican opponents who dominated in Congress increasingly at
loggerheads. What it meant for all those in Paris looking to the United
States for leadership was that time was not on their side, that the
longer things dragged on, the less likely the Americans would have the
ability or even the interest to do much at all. Very quickly, for Yale
and others in the American Middle Eastern division, there came the
deeply dispiriting sense that matters were slipping away. “We fought
over boundary lines as if the destiny of the world depended upon it,”
Yale recalled of that time. “We fumed and fussed because Wilson and [his
chief advisor Edward] House seemed to pay no attention to what we were
doing. It all seemed strangely academic and futile to me.”</p>
<p>As the peace conference extended, the folly of Yale’s mission would
only grow increasingly absurd. In the late spring of 1919, he was
appointed to an American fact-finding committee, the King-Crane
Commission, which, in pursuit of Wilson’s self-determination principle,
was dispatched to determine the desires of the former denizens of the
Ottoman world, “to take a plebiscite,” in Yale’s skeptical view, “of a
vast sprawling empire of 30,000,000 inhabitants.” Unsurprisingly, after
a tour of two months, and scores of meetings in Turkey, Syria, Lebanon,
and Palestine, the message the commission had heard in each place was
unequivocal: the vast majority of people wanted either independence or
the Americans. In light of this, the commission came up with a sweeping
set of recommendations that placed the United States at the forefront of
administering a solution to the Middle Eastern puzzle. That solution,
however, did not at all resemble what had already been secretly agreed
to by the British and the French, nor what the Wilson administration was
willing to take on. At least here, the administration was prepared to
act with great dispatch; the King-Crane reports were swiftly locked away
in a safe, not to be seen or read by the outside world for the next
three years.</p>
<p>Returning to Europe from that mission in the fall of 1919, Yale would
make one last attempt to salvage the situation in Syria, enlisting
Lawrence’s support for what became known as the Yale Plan. With the plan
drawing support from senior British statesmen, it briefly appeared the
coming showdown between the Arabs and French in Syria might be averted.
But Yale was essentially acting in a freelance capacity, and once senior
American officials learned of it, his plan was quickly scuttled. On
November 1, 1919, British troops who had occupied Syria until a final
settlement was reached began to withdraw. On that same day, French
troops began moving in. Days later, Yale resigned from the American
peace delegation in disgust and sailed back to New York.</p>
<p>T. E. Lawrence lost hope at about the same time. As his mother would
relate to a biographer, her son slipped into a state of “extreme
depression and nervous exhaustion” that autumn, and during visits home
he “would sometimes sit the entire morning between breakfast and lunch
in the same position, without moving, and with the same expression on
his face.”</p>
<p>PART OF THE enduring fascination with T. E. Lawrence’s story is the
series of painful “what if?” questions it raises, a pondering over what
the world lost when he lost. What would have happened if, in 1918, the
Arabs had been able to create the greater Arab nation that many so
desperately sought, and which they believed had been promised them? How
different would the Middle East look today if the early Zionists in
postwar Palestine had been able to negotiate with a man like Faisal
Hussein, who had talked of “the racial kinship and ancient bonds” that
existed between Jew and Arab? And what of the Americans? Today, it
scarcely seems conceivable that there was a time when the Arab and
Muslim worlds were clamoring for American intervention in their lands;
what might have happened if the United States had risen to the
opportunity presented at the end of World War I?</p>
<p>In all probability, not quite the golden age some might imagine. As
Lawrence himself frequently stated, the notion of a true pan-Arab nation
was always something of a mirage, the differences between its radically
varied cultures far greater than what united them. Perhaps such a
fractious and vast nation could have endured for a time through sheer
lack of strong central control, much as under the Ottomans’ old system,
but advances in technology and communication would almost certainly have
soon brought these disparate cultures and peoples into conflict.
Similarly, there were never going to be truly harmonious relations
between the Jews and the Arabs in Palestine, given that Arab resistance
to an expanded Jewish presence long preceded the Balfour Declaration and
took little notice of Faisal’s moderation; indeed, the one postwar Arab
leader who would try to reach an accommodation with Israel, Faisal’s
brother Abdullah, would be assassinated by a Palestinian gunman for his
troubles. As for American occupying troops being hailed as liberators,
that surely would have been short-lived too, ending when those troops
were drawn into policing local conflicts they little understood, with
the inevitable choosing of sides this entails. Even if it somehow
managed to avoid those treacherous straits, the United States would
certainly have shed its image as “the one disinterested party” as it
steadily became an imperial power in its own right.</p>
<p>All that said, it’s hard to imagine that any of this could possibly
have produced a sadder history than what has actually transpired over
the past century, a catalog of war, religious strife, and brutal
dictatorships that has haunted not just the Middle East but the entire
world. That sad history began from almost the moment the negotiators in
Paris packed their bags and declared their mission complete, leaving in
their wake “a porcelain peace.”</p>
<p>Denied Lawrence’s assistance in the autumn of 1919, a desperate
Faisal was forced to accept the few crumbs of compromise the French were
willing to throw his way in Syria. When Faisal returned to Damascus,
however, he found himself denounced as a traitor for selling the nation
out to the European imperialists. Harnessing this popular rage, Faisal
renounced his deal with the French and in March 1920 staged something of
a palace coup by declaring himself king of Syria. That act, in
conjunction with the San Remo conference the following month at which
Great Britain and France formalized their partition of the
region—Britain taking Iraq and a “greater” Palestine that included a
broad swath east of the Jordan River, or Transjordan, France the rest of
Syria—set Faisal on a collision course with the French. That collision
came in July; after a brief and one-sided battle on the outskirts of
Damascus, the French ousted Faisal and cast him into exile. By the close
of 1920, the French at last had much of their Syrie intégrale (with the
exception of the British mandate in Palestine and Transjordan), but they
now faced a populace seething with rage. They also now confronted an
external threat; in the deserts of Transjordan, Faisal’s brother
Abdullah was massing his followers with the intention of marching on
Damascus.</p>
<p>But whatever problems the French had at the end of 1920 were dwarfed
by those of the British. In Palestine, tensions between Zionist
immigrants and the resident Arab population had escalated into
bloodshed. In Arabia, ibn-Saud was once again pushing to oust King
Hussein. The worst crisis point was in Iraq. The previous year, Lawrence
had predicted full-scale revolt against British rule there by March 1920
“if we don’t mend our ways,” but he had been off by two months; by the
time the May rebellion in Iraq was put down, some one thousand British
and nine thousand natives were dead. As Lawrence would explain in his
1929 letter to William Yale, at Paris, Great Britain and France had
taken the discredited Sykes-Picot Agreement and fashioned something even
worse; how much worse was evidenced by the myriad fires that had spread
across the region almost immediately.</p>
<p>To combat these crises, in December 1920 Lloyd George turned to a man
who had become something of a pariah in British ruling circles, former
first lord of the admiralty, Winston Churchill. One of Churchill’s first
acts upon assuming the position of Colonial Office secretary was to
enlist the help of another recent outcast, former lieutenant colonel T.
E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>At least initially, Lawrence had little interest in rejoining the
fray. Immersed in writing his memoirs, and undoubtedly still smarting
over his shabby treatment by Lloyd George’s government the previous
year, he told Churchill he was too busy and that he had left politics
behind. He only relented when the new colonial secretary assured him
that he would have a virtually free hand in helping fundamentally
reshape the British portion of the Middle Eastern chessboard at the
upcoming Cairo Conference. As a result, the Cairo deliberations were
little more than a formality, with Lawrence and Churchill having worked
out ahead of time, as Lawrence told a biographer, “not only [the]
questions the Conference would consider, but decisions they would
reach.”</p>
<p>Iraq was now to be consolidated and recognized as an Arab kingdom,
with Faisal placed on the throne. In Arabia, the British upheld
Hussein’s claim to rule in the Hejaz, while simultaneously upholding
ibn-Saud’s authority in the Arabian interior. Surely the most novel idea
to come out of Cairo was the plan designed to stay Abdullah from
attacking the French in Syria. At the close of the conference, Lawrence
journeyed to Abdullah’s base camp in Amman and convinced the truculent
Arab leader to first try to establish a government in the Transjordan
region of Britain’s Palestine mandate. To Lawrence’s great surprise—and
perhaps to Abdullah’s as well—this most indolent of Hussein’s four sons
actually proved to be a remarkably good administrator; in the near
future, Transjordan was to be officially detached from the rest of
Palestine and made an independent Arab kingdom—today’s Jordan—with
Abdullah as its ruler. By the time Lawrence returned to England in the
autumn of 1921, his one-year service to the Colonial Office nearly over,
he had quite literally become the unseen kingmaker of the Middle
East.</p>
<p>But if all this brought a measure of stability to the center of the
old Ottoman Empire map, it did little to improve matters to the north
and south. There, the situation remained uncertain and bloody for some
time to come.</p>
<p>In Anatolia, the former Turkish general Mustafa Kemal, the hero of
Gallipoli, had refused to accept the dismemberment of Turkey as outlined
by the Allies. Over a four-year period, he led his army of Turkish
nationalists into battle against all those who would claim a piece of
the Turkish heartland, before finally establishing the modern-day
borders of Turkey in 1923. France’s turn in this round robin of war came
in the autumn of 1921 when Kemal, soon to become better known as
Ataturk, turned his attention to the French troops occupying the Cilicia
region. Quickly routed, the French armies in Cilicia beat a hasty
retreat back into Syria under the leadership of their commander, the
unlucky Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>At the same time, a bewildering arc of war extended from the Caucasus
all the way to Afghanistan as various nationalist groups, Russian Reds
and Whites, and remnants of the Young Turks battled for primacy, forming
and reforming alliances with such dizzying regularity as to defy both
logic and comprehension. Among the prominent aspirants in this crucible
were both Enver and Djemal Pasha, and it was no more surprising than
anything else going on in the region that Djemal Pasha should turn up in
Kabul in the winter of 1921 as a military advisor to the king of
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>And then, far to the south, it was King Hussein’s turn. With the
British having long since tired of his mercurial rule and refusal to
accept the political realities of the Middle East—in 1921, Lawrence had
spent a maddening two months in Jeddah futilely trying to get Hussein to
accept the Cairo Conference accords—he was all but defenseless when
ibn-Saud and his Wahhabist warriors finally closed on Mecca in late
1924. Hustled to the coast and then onto a British destroyer, Hussein
was first taken to exile in Cyprus, before finally joining his son
Abdullah in his new capital of Amman, Jordan. The deposed king, who had
once dreamt of a pan-Arab nation extending from Mecca to Baghdad, died
there in 1931 at the age of seventy-six.</p>
<p>From there, matters simply turned worse for the West. By the 1930s,
the British faced a quagmire in the Palestine mandate they had schemed
so hard to obtain, first a full-scale Arab revolt fueled by increasing
Jewish immigration into the region, joined after World War II by attacks
from Jewish guerrillas who saw the British occupiers as the last
roadblock toward the creation of Israel. In 1946, the war-exhausted
French were forced to give up their cherished Syrie intégrale, but not
before carving out a new nation, Lebanon, from its territory; within
three years, Syria’s pro-Western democratic government would be ousted
in a military coup, and the convoluted governing structure imposed by
the French in Lebanon would set the country on the path to civil war. In
1952, British control of Egypt ended when their puppet king was
overthrown by Gamal Abdel Nasser and his nationalist Free Officers
Movement, followed six years later by a military coup in Iraq by
like-minded junior officers that ended the pro-Western monarchy
established by Faisal. By the 1960s, with the era of European
imperialism drawing to its unceremonious close, the Middle East
resembled the shambles the colonial powers were leaving behind in other
parts of the globe, but with one crucial difference: because of oil, the
region had now become the most strategically vital corner on earth, and
the West couldn’t walk away from the mess it had helped create there
even if it wanted to. What has transpired there over the past half
century is, of course, familiar to all: four wars between the Arabs and
Israelis; a ten-year civil war in Lebanon and a twenty-year one in
Yemen; the slaughter of ethnic minorities in Syria and Iraq; four
decades of state-sponsored terrorism; convulsions of religious
extremism; four major American military interventions and a host of
smaller ones; and for the Arab people, until very recently, a virtually
unbroken string of cruel and/or kleptocratic dictatorships stretching
from Tunisia to Iraq that left the great majority impoverished and
disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Certainly, blame for all this doesn’t rest solely with the terrible
decisions that were made at the end of World War I, but it was then that
one particularly toxic seed was planted. Ever since, Arab society has
tended to define itself less by what it aspires to become than by what
it is opposed to: colonialism, Zionism, Western imperialism in its many
forms. This culture of opposition has been manipulated—indeed,
feverishly nurtured—by generations of Arab dictators intent on
channeling their people’s anger away from their own misrule in favor of
the external threat, whether it is “the great Satan” or the
“illegitimate Zionist entity” or Western music playing on the streets of
Cairo. This is also why the so-called Arab Spring movement of today
represents such a potentially transformative moment in the history of
the Middle East. For the first time since 1918, the “Arab street” is
having a say in its own future, and however many roadblocks are thrown
in its way, an element of civic participation and personal freedom is
being spawned that likely can never be boxed back up. To the degree that
genuine democracy and self-determination does take hold—and in a region
that has been politically and intellectually stunted for so long, it’s
easy to only focus on the short-term chaos—the Arab world might finally
embark upon the path envisioned for it by Lawrence and a handful of
other dreamers a century ago.</p>
<p>MARK SYKES, the man whose name has become synonymous with the
disastrous policies the West pursued in the Middle East after World War
I, didn’t live to see their effect. Having swiftly gone from
indispensable fix-it man to scapegoat in the eyes of the British Foreign
Office for his coauthorship of the detested Sykes-Picot Agreement, in
the autumn of 1918 Sykes embarked on an extended tour of the postwar
Middle East. His diminished stature hadn’t engendered a bout of modesty,
however; as he informed the Foreign Office in proposing his trip, along
with calming Arab-Jewish tensions in Palestine, he intended to help
reorganize the Allied political and military infrastructure in Syria,
cajole the British Indian regime in Iraq into adopting a more
progressive, postimperial mien, and “assist in promoting good relations
between Arabs and French.”</p>
<p>For two months, Sykes and his small entourage crisscrossed the
region, each day filled with an exhausting schedule of events. But even
this most vainglorious of men must have seen that in the Middle East,
just as in London, his sway was vastly reduced. In Damascus, Sykes
called on Gilbert Clayton, once an attentive listener to his various
initiatives, only to encounter a pronounced mulishness. Unknown to
Sykes, Clayton had recently received advice from an official in London
on how to handle his visitor. “Don’t take Mark at his own valuation,”
the official had cautioned. “His shares are unsaleable here and he has
been sent out (at his own request) to get him away.”</p>
<p>Yet as humbling as this journey was, it seemed to spark in Sykes a
genuine reappraisal of his views on the Middle East. In January 1919, as
he wrote up an “appreciation” of his just-completed trip, he allowed
that both Britain and France had been quite wrong in their approach in
the region. In a line he could have lifted from Lawrence’s Twenty-Seven
Articles, he now suggested that “whoever takes over Syria ought to
realize that to have a purely native administration running things
badly, but with prospects of improvement, represents more real progress
than having a European staff doing things properly, but [with] the
natives learning nothing.” It was a remarkable evolution in thinking in
the man who three years earlier had coauthored what would turn out to be
the last great compact in the service of European imperialism.</p>
<p>But it was too late. By the time Sykes showed up at the Paris Peace
Conference in early February, his British colleagues were less
interested in any evolution of his thinking than in extricating
themselves from the agreement that bore his name. In the close quarters
of Paris, the scorn with which they regarded Sykes took on an element of
bullying. “I said something to him about the agreement,” Lloyd George
would recall in his memoirs, “and at once saw how I had cut him. I am
sorry. I wish I had said nothing. I blame myself. He did his best.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the prime minister’s contrition stemmed from what soon
followed. On the evening of February 10, Sykes took to bed early,
complaining of feeling run-down. By the next morning, he couldn’t stand.
Doctors quickly diagnosed Spanish influenza, and for the next five days
he lingered in great pain in his hotel room, tended to by his wife,
Edith, herself ill with the disease. Sykes finally succumbed on the
evening of February 16, one month short of his fortieth birthday.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN ALSO did not live to see his plans come into being.
He too was at Paris, and much as with the Zionist Commission in 1918,
had been led to believe that he would assume a leadership role in the
Zionist delegation to the peace conference, only to find himself
relegated to the sidelines at the last minute. As he thundered in his
diary on January 16, 1919, after learning that the senior Zionist
leadership was about to meet in London for a strategy session, “Chaim
[Weizmann] said to me incidentally, ‘you are coming to London also,
aren’t you?’ ‘For what?’ I replied. ‘To receive further insults? Many
thanks.’ I wrote that I was sick and tired of remaining in the false
position of a mistress who is loved in the privacy of one’s room, but
not recognized before the world.”</p>
<p>Just as he had threatened to do many times with the Zionist
Commission, Aaronsohn resolved to quit Paris altogether, and was only
stayed when the Zionist leadership that had so recently snubbed him
contritely beseeched his help in drawing the proposed boundary map for
Palestine. “I hate the way they work,” Aaronsohn jotted afterward in his
diary with a note of put-upon triumph. “Give important missions to
people and at the last minute realize nothing was done because they
didn’t let experts do it.” The map Aaronsohn drew up was a Zionist’s
dream, one that, if adopted, would have extended the borders of
Palestine to the outskirts of Damascus, not so much making Palestine an
enclave alongside a greater Syria than transforming Syria into a virtual
rump state of a greater Palestine.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 15, 1919, Aaronsohn was preparing to return to
Paris and the peace conference after a quick visit to London. At Kenley
airfield south of London, however, he discovered his flight had been
delayed due to thick ground fog. By 11:30, he was just about to give up
and return to London when, amid a partial clearing of the skies, the
pilot of a much smaller plane, a two-seater de Havilland making a mail
run to Paris, offered to give him a lift. At about 1 p.m., a French
fishing boat captain working the waters off the Calais coast heard a
plane flying low overhead, invisible in the thick fog, then the sound of
a crash. Searching through the mist, the fisherman found scattered mail
floating on the calm sea, but nothing else. Neither the body of the de
Havilland pilot nor of Aaron Aaronsohn was ever recovered. Since by
rabbinical law a funeral can’t be held without a body, on the evening of
May 17 Aaronsohn’s friends and colleagues gathered in Paris for an
“observance” of his life and contribution to the Zionist cause.</p>
<p>As for Aaronsohn’s colleague and sometime adversary in the Zionist
cause, Chaim Weizmann, he would not only live to see the creation of the
state of Israel, but serve as its first president until his death in
1952. He was joined in postwar Palestine by his rebellious younger
sister Minna. For her services to the Central Powers war effort, Minna
was included in a prisoner exchange between Germany and Russia in the
last days of World War I. Managing yet another escape, this time from
the chaos of postwar Germany, she returned to Jerusalem, where she
worked for the health service of the Zionist women’s organization,
Hadassah.</p>
<p>Djemal Pasha continued his adventurous life in the postwar era, if
only briefly. Having escaped from Constantinople along with his two
co-pashas, Talaat and Enver, aboard a German torpedo boat in the last
days of the war, Djemal wandered the battlegrounds of Central Asia,
falling in and out of alliances with a bewildering array of factions.
His luck finally ran out in July 1922 when he and an aide were gunned
down in the streets of Tbilisi, Georgia. Claiming credit for the
assassination was a shadowy Armenian nationalist organization that had
vowed to liquidate those responsible for the Armenian slaughters of
1915–16, and which had earlier assassinated Talaat Pasha in Berlin. The
following month, Enver, the last of the Three Pashas and Djemal’s
coadventurer in the Caucasus, also passed from the scene, shot in a
Russian Red Army ambush in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>IN HIS ROLE as one of America’s Middle Eastern experts at the Paris
Peace Conference, William Yale did not limit his attention to the matter
of peace in the region. At the same time, and perhaps mindful that one
day he would have to find a new job, he sought to quietly promote the
interests of his former employer, Standard Oil of New York, with the
American delegation. Between President Wilson’s stout defense of the
“Open Door” free trade policy and a series of events that had occurred
in Palestine in the summer of 1918, Yale had a good pretext for doing
so.</p>
<p>While serving as the American military liaison at Allenby’s
headquarters that summer, Yale had been summoned by General Arthur
Money, the British chief administrator of Palestine, who demanded that
he hand over Socony’s Palestine oilfield maps. When Yale refused,
protesting that Money should take up the issue with Standard
headquarters, the general opted for the simpler course of breaking into
the old Socony office in Jerusalem and taking them. In a series of
memoranda to the American peace delegates, Yale darkly warned of where
these strong-arm tactics might lead, especially if the oil-hungry
British were allowed free rein in their mandate territories of Palestine
and Iraq. Those delegates were duly alarmed; largely at Yale’s
instigation, the American campaign to force the British to honor
Socony’s Palestine concessions would become a major source of friction
between the two countries for the next several years.</p>
<p>Except that Socony was apparently playing something of a shell game
in Palestine, fiercely fighting to protect its “strike” at Kornub in
order to establish a precedent for demanding equal access to the known
oilfields in British-controlled Iraq. When that access was finally ceded
in 1924, Standard Oil abruptly dropped all its concessions in Palestine.
Scurrying into the breach, a British oil company hastily conducted its
own tests at Kornub, only to find what Yale’s geologist partner, Rudolf
McGovern, had found in 1914: iron tailings. Despite the periodic release
of optimistic industry reports to the contrary, no commercially viable
oil deposits have ever been found at Kornub.</p>
<p>After quitting the Paris Peace Conference in disgust in late 1919,
Yale returned to the United States with hopes of being rehired by
Socony. Whether due to his past impolitic remarks in the halls of 26
Broadway or because he had become too high profile in the ongoing oil
battles with Britain, that effort failed. With his family’s fortune long
since dwindled away and jobs scarce in the deepening American postwar
recession, Yale signed on with an American trading firm and went back to
Cairo. On the way, he stopped off in England and married Edith Hanna, a
British nurse he had met in Jerusalem before the war.</p>
<p>For several years, Yale juggled a number of different part-time
positions in Cairo, even as he continued to prospect for oil on his own.
By May 1922, he felt he’d made a strike on the British-controlled
Farasan Island off the coast of Yemen. As he told a senior Socony
official, the British were keeping the oil find a secret, but if a
Socony geologist was sent out, Yale knew a way for them to sneak onto
the island. When that offer wasn’t pursued, Yale returned to the United
States, where he took up the unlikely vocation of chicken farmer in
rural New Hampshire as he worked toward getting his master’s degree in
education. By 1928, he had been hired by the University of New Hampshire
as an assistant professor of history.</p>
<p>A prodigious if not particularly gifted writer, Yale supplemented his
professor’s income with articles and essays about the Middle East. These
efforts gradually achieved wider recognition—he published in both the
Atlantic Monthly and the Christian Science Monitor—which led to visiting
lectureships and invitations to university symposia. Just as when he had
lived in the region, Yale’s views on the Middle East oscillated wildly
over the years, so that his 1923 call for a campaign to “smash the
debasing tyranny of Islamism, which for centuries has corrupted the
minds and souls and bodies of countless millions of Orientals,” was
neatly offset by a later screed against “the exploitive nature of Jewish
nationalistic imperialism,” which he charged was modeled on the “German
fascist pattern.”</p>
<p>Despite such rhetoric, Yale was sufficiently well regarded as an
expert in the field to be appointed to the State Department’s Office of
Postwar Planning as a Middle Eastern specialist during World War II.
That position, in turn, led to his appointment as an assistant secretary
to the Committee on Trusteeship at the first postwar United Nations
conference in San Francisco in 1945. Yale’s particular area of focus was
on the proposed political realignment of the Arab world through a
dismantling of the discredited colonial mandate system in favor of U.N.
trusteeship. It must have felt very much like déjà vu, for, just as with
the King-Crane Commission of twenty-six years earlier, none of the
committee’s recommendations for the Middle East would be acted upon.</p>
<p>Returned to civilian life, Yale resumed teaching history at the
University of New Hampshire, and then at Boston University until his
retirement in 1967. He died in a nursing home in Derry, New Hampshire,
in February 1975, at the age of eighty-seven.</p>
<p>FROM THE OTHER side of the Middle Eastern intelligence battlefield,
Curt Prüfer had a rather more colorful postwar career. Indeed, while no
individual can truly personify the history of a nation, it would be hard
to find a more remarkable exemplar through which to view events in
Germany between the two world wars.</p>
<p>In 1919, Prüfer was quickly drawn to one of the most poisonous myths
to take root in defeated Germany, the so-called stab-in-the-back
conspiracy. According to this myth, Germany hadn’t lost the war on the
battlefield, but rather had been betrayed from within. Chief among these
internal traitors were Germany’s liberal political parties—in a case of
astoundingly poor timing, a coalition of leftist parties took control of
the government just two days before the armistice—and international
Jewry, seduced by the promises of the Balfour Declaration into throwing
their allegiance to the Allied cause. It was a myth ultimately put to
devastating use by Adolf Hitler, but it found an adherent in Curt Prüfer
far earlier; according to biographer Donald McKale, even as the
impoverished Prüfer accepted financial support from a Jewish foreign
ministry coworker in the lean early postwar years, he railed against the
Jews in his diary with growing vehemence.</p>
<p>In fact, though, due to the unfinished business of the Paris Peace
Conference, a strong argument could be made that Germany hadn’t truly
been defeated at all; instead, the Allies had created perhaps the best
possible breeding ground for future conflict by simultaneously burdening
their former enemy with crushing war reparation debts and leaving her
ruling apparatus largely intact. It enabled German officials, Curt
Prüfer among them, to quickly begin rebuilding the alliances and
networks of influence that had helped lead to war to begin with. One of
Prüfer’s first tasks for the foreign ministry in the postwar era was to
help a number of Germany’s former partners in the Middle East—Egyptian
nationalists, leaders of the Young Turk movement, pro-German Arabs—to
escape retribution and resettle within the former Central Powers. Of
course, this meant Germany now had a recruitment pool of malcontents for
fomenting unrest in the future.</p>
<p>Even before the war was over, Prüfer had seen a new way forward for
that campaign, if only Germany learned from its past mistakes. “Our
propaganda suffered,” he wrote the foreign ministry on November 2, 1918,
“because during the war we wanted to make up in urgency what we had
neglected in peace.… With weepy accusations against our enemies, with
longwinded recitals on our success, and inwardly untrue protestations of
friendship for Islam, we tried to win sympathy from people who stood far
from us spiritually.” The next time around, Prüfer urged, Germany “must
seek less to educate, than to please.”</p>
<p>Amid the musical-chairs politics of the postwar Middle East, Prüfer
soon had opportunity to get back into the mischief-making game. In the
autumn of 1921, he was linked to a new scheme by the ever-determined
Abbas Hilmi to overthrow the British regime in Egypt. A few months
later, Prüfer was in Rome visiting with Chaim Weizmann. If aware that
his visitor had once seduced his younger sister into spying for Germany,
Weizmann apparently had bigger things on his mind; as he opined to
Prüfer, since the French were clearly to blame for the British backing
away from the idea of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Zionists and
Germans now needed to work together against France. It was an idea with
which the virulently anti-Semitic but ever opportunistic Prüfer
undoubtedly heartily concurred. For these and other activities, the
British government finally put Prüfer on an enemies blacklist, with the
MI5 security agency maintaining an investigative file on him that would
never be closed.</p>
<p>By the late 1920s, though, a certain equilibrium had settled into
Prüfer’s life. Having divorced his long-estranged first wife, the
American Frances Pinkham, he married a much younger German woman who in
1930 bore him a son. He also continued to rise through the foreign
ministry ranks, eventually becoming deputy director of its vitally
important Abteilung (Department) III, the division dealing with both
Anglo-American and Middle Eastern affairs. He was still in that position
when Adolf Hitler came to power in July 1933.</p>
<p>Even though he shared Hitler’s dream of a resurgent Germany, Prüfer,
like many German conservatives, initially viewed the upstart Nazis as
useful fools, rough-around-the-edges hooligans who could be utilized but
controlled by the more respectable establishment. By 1936, Prüfer had
sufficiently recovered from that misapprehension and his initial
distaste to become personnel director of Hitler’s foreign ministry and,
a year later, to officially join the Nazi Party. In September 1939, with
Germany having just ignited World War II with its invasion of Poland,
Prüfer left for South America to serve as Hitler’s ambassador to
Brazil.</p>
<p>His three years in Brazil marked a kind of personal high point. At
last Prüfer had achieved the status within the German diplomatic
community that he had sought as far back as 1911. What’s more, by
developing a close friendship with Brazil’s dictator, he helped
forestall that immensely rich country from joining the war on the side
of the Allies despite a treaty commitment with the Americans to do so.
But alas, old habits die hard. In the summer of 1942, Prüfer was
directly linked to a German espionage ring operating in Brazil and
ordered from the country. If disappointed by this turn of events, the
ambassador could at least be pleased by the timing; just five days after
he and his family sailed for home, Brazil joined the Allies in the war
and a warrant was issued for his arrest (he was eventually sentenced in
absentia to twenty-five years for espionage).</p>
<p>Curiously trusting for a propaganda expert, Prüfer had apparently
accepted Nazi pronouncements about imminent victory at face value, so he
was shocked to return to a Europe where the war was turning inexorably
against Germany. For a year, he stuck it out in Berlin, even as he moved
his wife and child to a home he had bought in a smaller city to escape
the incessant Allied air raids. “All this is terrible for me to
witness,” he wrote in July 1943, “not only because I have always been a
person who is very attached to his homeland and always will be, but also
because I was sincerely converted to some of the beautiful ideas of
National Socialism.”</p>
<p>Beautiful ideas aside, this natural-born survivor also had the
instinct to find a way out. In September 1943, Prüfer led his family
across the border into neutral Switzerland, where, much as in 1918, he
remained until Germany’s fall. The difference between his return in 1918
and that of 1945 was that this time the Allies weren’t going to allow
German militarists another reprise. The home Prüfer had purchased in
Baden Baden, it turned out, had been confiscated from a Jewish family,
and was taken away from him. The former ambassador was also put through
the American “de-nazification” investigation process, where he was
cleared of war crimes even as many of his immediate superiors in the
foreign ministry were sent to Nuremberg. The British might have had more
desire to catch up to the man who had been their nemesis for three
decades, but they too lost interest when in October 1945 it was reported
the always frail Prüfer was either dead or dying of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>But maybe not quite. Three years later, a sharp-eyed British
intelligence officer in New Delhi noted a curious little item in the
Daily Telegraph of India relating to the future training of Indian
diplomats at Delhi University. “Students will be under the supervision
of Dr. Pruffer,” the article noted, “a former German diplomat who left
his country on the advent of the Nazi regime.”</p>
<p>From a bit of sleuthing, it was eventually determined that the
anti-Nazi “Pruffer” and the pro-Nazi Prüfer were one and the same. Much
as had occurred in Cairo nearly forty years earlier, the British moved
to deny Prüfer his coveted academic position, and he eventually returned
to Germany. He finally died there—for real this time—in early 1959, at
the age of seventy-seven. In a fitting irony, his only child, Olaf, with
whom the failed former Oriental scholar had long been estranged, would
eventually immigrate to the United States and become a renowned
archaeologist.</p>
<p>OF ALL THE spies and intelligence agents who dueled with each another
in the Middle East during World War I, the one most determined to
divorce himself from the region in its aftermath was T. E. Lawrence. As
he wrote a friend during his 1921 service for Winston Churchill at the
Colonial Office, “the Arabs are like a page I have turned over, and
sequels are rotten things.”</p>
<p>In early 1922, with that service ending, Lawrence petitioned the head
of the Royal Air Force for permission to join the force. There were
several curious details to this request. Due both to his celebrity and
former military rank, Lawrence might easily have entered the RAF as a
senior officer, but instead he specifically requested to come in “with
the ranks,” meaning as an ordinary private. Also, he was no longer T. E.
Lawrence; as he informed the RAF chief, his new name was John Hume
Ross.</p>
<p>Making his petition especially puzzling was that Lawrence had always
been openly contemptuous of military culture. As he would write in Seven
Pillars, the military uniform “walled its bearers from ordinary life,
was sign that they had sold their wills and bodies to the State, and
contracted themselves into a service not the less abject for that its
beginning was voluntary.… The soldier assigned his owner the twenty-four
hours’ use of his body, and sole conduct of his mind and passions.”</p>
<p>But perhaps it was not so puzzling after all. In Arabia, Lawrence had
exerted life-and-death control over thousands, had cobbled together a
cause and an army as he went along. All the while, he had been tormented
by a sense of his own fraudulence, the awareness that the men who fought
and died at his side were almost certain to be betrayed in the end. As
he would suggest in Seven Pillars, and state quite explicitly in letters
to friends, after Arabia he never wanted to be in a position of
responsibility again.</p>
<p>Joined to this was a desire for anonymity, to leave behind who and
what he had been. Lawrence displayed this desire most overtly in the
decision to change his name—first to John Hume Ross and then to Thomas
Edward Shaw—but it took more subtle form, a kind of psychological
washing of the hands. In the one very short mention of the Cairo
Conference in Seven Pillars, Lawrence wrote that Churchill “made
straight all the tangle” in the Middle East, fulfilling Britain’s
promises to the Arabs “in letter and spirit (where humanly possible)
without sacrificing any interest of our Empire or any interest of the
peoples concerned.” Knowing the full extent of those promises, and
writing at a time when his cherished Syria remained under French
control, Lawrence couldn’t possibly have believed his own assertion.
Similarly, considering all that is contained in its pages, it’s very
hard to regard the subtitle to Seven Pillars—“A Triumph”—as anything but
self-mockery.</p>
<p>Yet putting paid to all that had occurred so as to no longer have to
think about it may well have been a matter of personal survival. What’s
sadly evident in many of Lawrence’s postwar letters to friends, as well
as in comments he made to his contemporary biographers, is that he
suffered from many of the symptoms of what was known at the time as
“shell shock,” and what is today referred to as post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD). Over the remainder of his life, Lawrence suffered from
recurrent nightmares, endured severe bouts of depression—several of
which included the contemplation of suicide—and gradually cut himself
off from many of his former friends amid an intense desire to be
alone.</p>
<p>He may have been particularly primed for this continuing torment by
his own actions on the battlefield. As a boy, he had been obsessed with
the tales of King Arthur’s court and the chivalric code, had dreamed of
leading a heroic life. In the reality of war, however, Lawrence had seen
men blown to bits, often by his own handiwork, had left wounded behind
to die, and had ordered prisoners to be killed. Just as any thoughtful
person before or after him, what Lawrence had discovered on the
battlefield was that while moments of heroism might certainly occur, the
cumulative experience of war, its day-in, day-out brutalization, was
utterly antithetical to the notion of leading a heroic life.</p>
<p>Also indicative of Lawrence’s craving for anonymity were the
circumstances of the publication of Seven Pillars of Wisdom. In 1922, he
had handprinted just eight copies of his wartime memoir for close
friends, but as word of the book spread, Lawrence was urged to release
it publicly. His compromise was to produce a slightly abridged
two-hundred-copy run of Seven Pillars in 1926, along with a vastly
shorter mass-market version, Revolt in the Desert. The books might have
made Lawrence wealthy, but he donated all royalties from the hugely
successful Revolt in the Desert to an RAF charity, and refused to
publish another edition of Seven Pillars during his lifetime.</p>
<p>While publicly denigrating his work as a trifle, Lawrence confided to
a friend the secret hope that his memoir might join the canon of the
very best of English literature. In this, he was to be disappointed. In
truth, Seven Pillars is a fabulously uneven book, its occasional soaring
lyricism and startling psychological insights all too often subsumed by
long disquisitions on topography and a riot of local place names and
fleeting characters likely to leave the reader struggling. Despite the
glowing and insistent plaudits of many—certainly Lawrence deserves great
credit for being one of the first modern writers to present an
unflinching look at the grotesqueness of war—Seven Pillars remains one
of those books that, as even an admiring critic acknowledges, “is more
often praised than read.”</p>
<p>After his first attempt at disappearing into the RAF as “Airman Ross”
failed—he was quickly unmasked by the British press—Lawrence joined the
Royal Tank Corps under the name of T. E. Shaw, then quietly transferred
back into the RAF in 1925. For the next decade, he occupied a succession
of lowly positions within the air corps—for nearly a year he served as a
simple base clerk at a remote RAF base in India—while also engaging his
mechanical bent with work on a new generation of high-speed military
rescue boats. In 1929, he bought a tiny cottage in rural Dorset, Clouds
Hill, just a mile from the Bovington Camp where he had served in the
Tank Corps, and this became his refuge from a still-clamoring public and
press. While he continued to write—in 1928, Lawrence penned an account
of his postwar military service, The Mint, followed by a translation of
Homer’s Odyssey—the bulk of his time was devoted to his decidedly
prosaic military duties, with off hours spent riding his beloved Brough
motorcycle through the English countryside or voraciously reading at
Clouds Hill. Despite the assertion of some biographers that this period
in Lawrence’s life was also highly productive and interesting, it is
hard to escape the image of a sad and reclusive man, his circle of
friends and acquaintances steadily dwindling to a mere handful, and many
of these only maintained by the occasional quick note from Lawrence
explaining why he couldn’t see them. “Please apologize humbly for me to
Mrs. S.F. [Newcombe],” he wrote Stewart Newcombe in February 1929, after
apparently failing to show for a scheduled visit. “Something has gone
wrong with the works, and I can’t wind myself up to meet people.”</p>
<p>One who insisted on a face-to-face meeting was Faisal Hussein. During
a state visit to England in 1925, the now king of Iraq and Lawrence
attended a luncheon at a politician’s estate. It proved a rather awkward
gathering, with the two old comrades in arms seeming to have little to
say to each other, and Lawrence discomfited by their host’s constant
invocation of “the good old days.” “I’ve changed,” Lawrence wrote his
confidante, Charlotte Shaw, afterward, “and the Lawrence who used to go
about and be friendly and familiar with that sort of people is dead.
He’s worse than dead. He is a stranger I once knew.”</p>
<p>During another state visit, in 1933, King Faisal had to lean on his
contacts in the British military to all but order “Private Shaw” to a
meeting.</p>
<p>By early 1935, Lawrence resolved to leave the RAF, even as he dreaded
the long and unstructured days that lay ahead of him. His apprehensions
proved quite accurate. As he wrote to a friend on May 6 from Clouds
Hill, just two months into his retirement, “at present the feeling is
mere bewilderment. I imagine leaves must feel like this after they have
fallen from their tree and until they die. Let’s hope that will not be
my continuing state.”</p>
<p>It would not be. Precisely a week later, on the morning of May 13,
Lawrence rode his motorcycle to Bovington Camp to send a telegram. On
his return, just a few hundred yards from Clouds Hill, he swerved to
avoid two bicycling boys on the narrow road. Clipping the back tire of
one of the bicycles, he lost control of the motorcycle and crashed,
striking his head on the asphalt. Suffering from massive brain injuries,
Lawrence lingered in a coma at the Bovington Camp hospital for six days,
before finally dying early on the morning of May 19, 1935. He was
forty-six.</p>
<p>Among the pallbearers at his funeral were his old friends Ronald
Storrs and Stewart Newcombe, while those in attendance included Winston
Churchill and the poet Siegfried Sassoon. For the occasion, King George
V sent a message to Lawrence’s surviving younger brother, Arnold. “Your
brother’s name will live in history, and the King gratefully recognizes
his distinguished services to his country.”</p>
<p>Churchill’s eulogy was rather more loquacious: “I deem him one of the
greatest beings alive in our time. I do not see his like elsewhere. I
fear whatever our need we shall never see his like again.”</p>
<p>It’s easy to read in Churchill’s last sentence an allusion to the new
danger that by 1935 was already building over Europe: the rise of Nazi
Germany. If Churchill imagined, however, that a living Lawrence might
have played a signal role in meeting that danger, he was surely
mistaken. As Lawrence himself had been trying to tell the world for many
years, the blue-eyed “warrior of the desert” had passed from the scene
long before, lost to the first great cataclysm of the twentieth
century.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments</p>
<p>The broad scope of this book required research in some twenty
different governmental archives or private collections on three
continents. It would have been an utterly impossible task without the
very able group of historians and researchers who assisted me in various
aspects. These include Tara Fitzgerald, Claire Flack, Lars Luedicke,
Frederic Maxwell, Andrea Minarcek, Kevin Morrow, Eamonn O’Neill, and
Anna Van Lenten. Of these I must especially thank Kevin Morrow, who not
only undertook research trips to California and Israel on my behalf, but
also oversaw the collection, organization, and translation of both
French and German archive material; I’m sure I would still be quite at
sea with this project without his help.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank the curators and administrators of the
various archives and private collections that I sought assistance from
over the course of this project, all of whom were unfailingly helpful
and generous with both their time and advice. While these are just a
fraction of all those who helped me, I’d particularly like to thank
Debbie Usher at the Middle East Centre, St. Antony’s College, Oxford;
Liz Gray, David Pfeiffer, and Eric Van Slander at the National Archives
and Records Administration, Washington, D.C.; Marion Freudenthal and
Ilonit Levy at the NILI Museum, Zichron Yaakov; Alex Rankin at Boston
University; Carol Leadenham at the Hoover Institution, Stanford
University; and Lynsey Robertson at the Churchill Archives Centre,
Cambridge University. I must also single out Howard Diamond and the
staff of the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, who made it something of a personal crusade
to pinpoint when a sandstorm was likely to have struck Beersheva in
early January 1914.</p>
<p>While it was my intention in this book to consult original source
material as much as possible, there are two authors to whom I feel
especially indebted. My research on Curt Prüfer would have taken
infinitely longer—and, in fact, would have still been incomplete—without
the pioneering work of Professor Donald McKale at Clemson University,
and his two seminal books, Curt Prüfer and War by Revolution. I also
want to thank Professor McKale for taking the time to read an early
version of the book, and for his very helpful comments. Second, the
author of any book in which T. E. Lawrence is a significant presence
must acknowledge the trailblazing achievements of Jeremy Wilson in his
authorized biography, Lawrence of Arabia. While I respectfully disagree
with Mr. Wilson on several aspects of Lawrence’s actions in Arabia, I am
deeply indebted to the astounding amount of scholarly research he has
done on Lawrence, which has greatly aided all of us who have followed in
his wake.</p>
<p>I also benefited from a small group of advance readers on this
project, some of whom read for historical accuracy and others for more
stylistic concerns. In the first category, in addition to Donald McKale,
I want to sincerely thank Roberto Mazza at Northern Illinois University
and Thomas Goltz at Montana State University, both of whom were
extremely generous with their time and deeply insightful with their
suggestions. In the latter category, I wish to thank my friends Michael
Fields, Wilson Van Law, and Seth McDowell for valiantly struggling
through a problematic early draft of the book, and most especially
Frances Shaw, who, without complaint, suffered through several more.
Also in this category I must include my wonderful agent and dear friend,
Sloan Harris, at International Creative Management Partners, a man who
always knows how to ride that delicate line of simultaneously providing
encouragement and cracking the whip.</p>
<p>Finally, while I can’t recall this being the case for any other book
I’ve written, I still remember the precise moment when the genesis of
this one occurred: during a dinner conversation with my very good friend
and editor, Bill Thomas, in the winter of 2008. I think we both
instantly knew this was the book I needed to write—in fact, had been
working toward writing for most of my journalistic career—and even if I
have occasionally cursed Bill’s name since then whilst in the midst of
writing or research difficulties, I’m eternally grateful for the
enthusiasm, patience, and diligence he’s shown these past years in
bringing the idea to fruition. I would also like to thank all the staff
of Doubleday for tolerating my semi-permanent presence in their offices
for several months while finishing the book’s fact-checking and
copyediting, especially Melissa Danaczko and Coralie Hunter for their
unstinting helpfulness in dealing with both my researching
idiosyncrasies and computer illiteracy.</p>
<p>And last, I want to thank all the friends and family members who have
been so tolerant of my canceled meetings, unreturned phone calls, and
general absence of the past five years. With the book now done, I
propose to be a much more attentive friend and relative going
forward.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>While I have drawn from a very wide variety of archival and secondary
materials in this book, a few sources specifically related to the book’s
principal subjects proved especially valuable. As far as archival
material is concerned, these are the diaries of Aaron Aaronsohn (NILI
Museum and Archives, Israel); the diaries of Curt Prüfer (Hoover
Institution, Stanford University); the unpublished memoir of William
Yale (Boston University); and the World War I–era records of the British
Foreign and War Offices (National Archives, Kew, England). Since some of
those records were declassified within the past decade, for certain
aspects of the book I had the opportunity to draw on material not
previously available.</p>
<p>In addition, I am indebted to Donald McKale for his biography Curt
Prüfer: German Diplomat from the Kaiser to Hitler, which is one of the
few sources of material for Curt Prüfer’s early life. With regard to T.
E. Lawrence, John Mack’s A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T. E.
Lawrence is the most incisive psychological portrait ever drawn of the
man. Most of all, I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Jeremy Wilson
and his authorized biography, Lawrence of Arabia; due to Wilson’s
exhaustive research, his work remains the starting point for all serious
Lawrence scholarship.</p>
<p>I also relied on a number of other primary and secondary materials
for historical background on specific aspects in the book—for example,
prewar Germany—and I have noted in corresponding endnotes those sources
that I found particularly useful.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>1 On the morning: Lawrence’s official rank at this time was actually
lieutenant colonel, but several weeks earlier he had been temporarily
given full colonel status so as to facilitate his speedy return to Great
Britain. As a result, from October 1918 onward, he was frequently
referred to in official correspondence as “Colonel Lawrence.”</p>
