<h4 id="chapter-9-the-man-who-would-be-kingmaker">Chapter 9 The Man Who
Would Be Kingmaker</h4>
<p>[Faisal] is hot tempered, proud and impatient, sometimes unreasonable
and runs off easily at tangents. Possesses far more personal magnetism
and life than his brothers, but less prudence. Obviously very clever,
perhaps not over scrupulous … Had he been brought up the wrong way might
have become a barrack yard officer. A popular idol, and ambitious; full
of dreams, and the capacity to realize them.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE ON FAISAL IBN HUSSEIN, OCTOBER 30, 1916</p>
<p>Doggedness and good luck had made Lawrence’s visit to the Hejaz an
extraordinarily successful one. In a mere ten days, he had met all four
of Emir Hussein’s sons, as well as the principal Allied envoys in
Jeddah. He had also seen firsthand the British efforts at establishing a
supply line for the rebels at Rabegh, and been the first outsider to
journey inland for a look at the actual battlefront. Now, as he rode
into Yenbo on the morning of October 26, 1916, he was anxious to get
back to Cairo to report on his findings.</p>
<p>In that dusty little port town, however, his fortunes suddenly
flagged. A British warship had been scheduled to make a Yenbo port of
call, but the appointed day came and went with no sign of it. With no
choice but to wait—for a total of five days, it would turn out—Lawrence
took up quarters in a modest three-story house overlooking the tiny
waterfront, the home of Faisal’s local liaison officer, and there set to
work writing up the impressions of his journey. In his usual crabbed
hand, and with only a blue fountain pen and some scrap paper by way of
supplies, over the next five days he would put some seventeen thousand
words to paper.</p>
<p>It was also in that house in Yenbo where the dueling legends of T. E.
Lawrence were to be born. To his lionizers, Lawrence’s acute grasp of
the situation on the ground in Arabia, combined with his brilliance at
conveying that understanding into words, was about to make him a man
born to the hour, a prime example of the phenomenon in which a
particular kind of genius is finally joined to the circumstances he has
spent his entire life working toward. To his detractors, what was about
to happen could be largely, even wholly, attributed to random chance,
that the myriad small events which were to transpire over the next three
weeks and so improbably turn to Lawrence’s advantage—the strange
coincidences, the timing and mistiming of messages, the byzantine
maneuverings by generals and statesmen—were beyond any prediction. If
all these factors were tossed into some giant cosmic hopper, so this
narrative goes, it never would have played out in quite the same
sequence again.</p>
<p>The specifics of Lawrence’s résumé that October would actually appear
to provide fodder for the latter version of the legend. At Yenbo, he was
a twenty-eight-year-old army captain without a single day of military
training; at that time, policy in Arabia was being debated at the
highest levels of the British military and political leadership. True,
he was the first British officer to glimpse the rebel fighters in the
field, but that glimpse had lasted all of twenty-six hours and
essentially consisted of watching them lounge about a valley encampment,
hardly the basis for an authoritative analysis. Nor were most of his
observations truly unique; among the handful of British military
officers who had preceded him to the Hejaz, nearly all had noted the
completely ad hoc nature of the Arab “army,” its lack of anything
approaching conventional military discipline, even its abject terror of
enemy artillery and airplanes.</p>
<p>But of course, Lawrence hadn’t merely his brief sojourn to Faisal’s
camp to draw on, but the years he had spent immersing himself in Arab
culture in Carchemish. From this he’d gained a profound appreciation for
how clan and tribal alliances worked, how that structure might play out
on the battlefield, and how unusual it was to find a leader capable of
forging a coalition of tribes for anything more than a very short-term
goal. In addition, starting as a young boy and continuing through his
years at Oxford, Lawrence had obsessively focused on one very particular
field of scholarship—medieval military history—and warfare in
early-twentieth-century Arabia bore striking similarities to that in
fourteenth-century Europe. These similarities extended from how a
fighting force was recruited, to its leadership structure—trade out
sheikhs and emirs for lords and thanes and princes—to how that fighting
force maneuvered in the field. In 1916 Hejaz, much like 1356 France, an
army on the move was wholly dependent on satisfying its most elemental
needs—water, the availability of draft animals, forage—and this dictated
where it went, whom it fought, and when. Lawrence, with a knowledge of
medieval military strategies surpassed by but a small handful of people
alive, found many of the features of the Arabian battlefield instantly
recognizable, and certainly far more familiar than to a professionally
trained officer steeped in Napoleonic or even current Western Front
precepts.</p>
<p>With this cultural and scholarly grounding, Lawrence immediately saw
the utter futility of trying to transform the Arab rebel fighting force
into something it was not, and never would be—namely, a conventional
European-style army. The only way forward, he argued in the reports he
penned in Yenbo, was for the British to accept the Arab way of war, and
to adapt their strategies and expectations accordingly.</p>
<p>But even this was not terribly controversial or original as far as it
went—after all, even the most hidebound military officer recognizes the
need to adjust to the men and matériel at his disposal—but from his
brief time in the Hejaz, Lawrence had come to two specific conclusions
that were much more so.</p>
<p>In light of the woeful lack of military success since the early days
of the Arab Revolt, there was a growing consensus in both London and
Cairo that a sizable British force would have to be dispatched to the
Hejaz to bolster the rebel forces; the most common figure bandied about
was a brigade, or at least three thousand soldiers. In October, Emir
Hussein continued to vacillate about this idea, worried that such an
“infidel” presence in the Muslim holy land would undermine his standing
with the tribes currently joined to him. From his own travels, and
especially from the wariness he had encountered in Faisal’s camp,
Lawrence concluded that Hussein’s apprehensions were absolutely valid;
while a small group of European advisors and trainers setting up shop on
the coastline would be “joyously welcomed,” he wrote, any larger force
was likely to be resented and play into Turkish propaganda about
Christian Crusaders. By arguing for this minimal presence, Lawrence was
placing himself against the majority opinion of the British military
command staff, including that held by the two British officers who’d
spent the most time in the Hejaz, Lt. Colonel Cyril Wilson and his
deputy, Alfred Parker.</p>
<p>Even more potentially contentious was Lawrence’s notion that the true
“prophet” of the revolt was the soft-spoken and austere Faisal. Going
back to even before the war, British officials had regarded the
gregarious and dynamic Abdullah as their chief ally in the Hejaz, the
son in closest counsel to the mercurial Hussein, and nothing since the
revolt’s outbreak had changed that view. To the contrary, it was to
Abdullah that those officials continued to turn in hopes of divining
what the old man might be thinking, and in charting the next stage in
the fighting. By contrast, prior to Lawrence, the only British officials
to have met Faisal were Wilson and Parker, and then to rather thin
conclusion; if liking Faisal on a personal level, Wilson had sensed in
the emir’s third son “a man who can’t stand the racket” of
combat—essentially, a coward—an estimation he had conveyed to the
British leadership. When it came to promoting Faisal as the revolt’s
real leader, Lawrence constituted a minority of precisely one.</p>
<p>And so, against the very long odds on both these points, just how did
Lawrence eventually win out? A case of genius not to be denied, or sheer
dumb luck?</p>
<p>What the purveyors of both dueling legends tend to overlook is that,
already at Yenbo, Lawrence had a formidable, if rather unglamorous,
weapon in his arsenal. From his position at the inner circle of the
military intelligence apparatus in Cairo, he possessed an intimate grasp
of the British military and political power structure deciding policy in
Arabia. But “structure” is far too charitable a word. In fact, it was a
bureaucratic quagmire, a maze of overlapping ministries and competing
agendas and feuding personalities. From his reading at the Savoy
Hotel—and virtually nothing was so classified as to be beyond his
purview—Lawrence knew who all the principal players were in this morass,
the opinions they held, and, perhaps most important, who their rivals
were. Along with writing up his reports, the five-day wait in Yenbo gave
him time to contemplate the mind-numbingly complex political chessboard
that lay before him, and to devise a strategy whereby he might play off
the competing factions and see his ideas win out.</p>
<p>He would be assisted in this by something else often overlooked: the
nature of communications at the time. In some spheres, this was
fantastically advanced from just decades earlier, in others still quite
primitive. In 1916, the mimeograph machine could make hundreds, even
thousands of copies of an important document; for most everything else,
there was the century-old technology of carbon paper. Via the wireless
telegraph, a message could be sent from London to Buenos Aires in a
matter of minutes, while delivering that same message to someone just
ten miles away in a place like Arabia required the dispatch of a courier
on foot or horseback. Lawrence would prove very adept at using both the
advances and deficiencies in communications to his advantage, repeatedly
breaching protocol to get messages to his allies quickly, conveniently
failing to receive undesired orders—“garbled transmission” was a
favorite excuse—until it was too late and the matter decided. Joined to
a certain ruthless streak, it all enabled T. E. Lawrence to emerge as a
kind of exemplar of the bureaucratic infighter, with a prowess that even
the most devious palace intriguer or tenure-track college professor
might envy.</p>
<p>Over the next three weeks, Lawrence would be employed as point
man—hatchet man might be a more apt term—by a variety of British
officials seeking to promote their agendas over those of their rivals.
In that role, the twenty-eight-year-old captain would adroitly work all
sides of the street, allowing him to administer a brutal blow to French
designs in the region, undermine an immensely powerful British official,
and help catalyze a fundamental shift in British policy in Arabia. In
the process, he would also alter the course of the Arab Revolt, and his
own role within it.</p>
<p>It was an ascendancy that got off to a shaky start, however. On
October 31, HMS Suva, under the command of a career naval officer named
William “Ginger” Boyle, so nicknamed for his red hair, put in to Yenbo
to finally free Lawrence from his enforced Arabian interlude.</p>
<p>“I had heard of a Captain Lawrence being on the coast,” Boyle would
recall in his memoirs. “I had assumed he was one of the military
officers sent over and was a little astonished when a small, untidily
dressed and most unmilitary figure strolled up to me on board … hands in
pockets and so without a salute.” Noticing that Lawrence had three
captain stars on one shoulder strap but inexplicably none on the other,
the no-nonsense Boyle refused even to acknowledge his passenger and
instead pointed him over to his first lieutenant; the ship captain was
gratified when the lieutenant roundly upbraided Lawrence for his lack of
manners.</p>
<p>In his own recollection of that meeting, Lawrence conceded his
failure to make a good first impression on Ginger Boyle but was more
inclined to attribute the problem to genetics. “Red-haired men,” he
pointed out, “are seldom patient.”</p>
<p>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, Édouard Brémond had taken little notice of the quiet
British army captain who attended his dinner at the French mission on
October 16. There was little reason he should have. The French colonel’s
principal guests that evening had been his British counterpart in
Jeddah, Cyril Wilson, and the visiting Oriental secretary for Egypt,
Ronald Storrs, a gregarious and witty table companion. By contrast,
Captain Lawrence had been so slight in stature and so youthful in face
that, in his ill-fitting uniform, he might easily have been mistaken for
an adolescent playing at soldier. Brémond had ample reason to revisit
that assessment when Lawrence returned to the French mission dining hall
at the beginning of November. At that dinner, the unassuming young
officer of three weeks before was loquacious, even commandeering of the
conversation, and Brémond was aghast at what he was saying.</p>
<p>When HMS Suva had turned into Yenbo bay on October 31, Lawrence had
assumed he would soon be on his way back to Cairo. Instead, Cyril
Wilson’s deputy in the Hejaz, Colonel Alfred Parker, had come up on the
Suva to hear firsthand what Lawrence had found at Faisal’s camp.
Impressed by his insights, Parker had suggested that Lawrence first make
for Khartoum in order to confer with Reginald Wingate, the
governor-general of the Sudan and one of the most important British
officials involved in Arabian affairs. As a result, the Suva had carried
Lawrence two hundred miles back down the coast to Jeddah, where a second
ship was readied to take him on the short hop across the Red Sea to the
Sudan. Testament to the sudden interest in his mission, this second
ship, HMS Euryalus, was the flagship of the Red Sea fleet and under the
personal direction of the fleet commander, Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss.</p>
<p>Hearing of all this, Colonel Brémond was also keen to learn what the
young army captain had observed in Faisal’s camp and, perhaps even more,
just what he intended to tell Reginald Wingate. This had prompted his
invitation to Lawrence and Wemyss to be his dinner guests in Jeddah. At
that gathering, it soon became clear that most every opinion Captain
Lawrence had formed ran directly counter to what the French colonel was
trying to achieve in Arabia.</p>
<p>Since setting up shop in Jeddah in early September, Brémond had
lobbied for a greatly expanded Allied military presence in the Hejaz.
Certainly part of his argument had root in his very low opinion of the
fighting capability of Hussein’s rebels. Time and again, he had proposed
that the two hundred French technical advisors who were under his
command and currently sitting idle in Egypt be brought down to Rabegh,
where they might start transforming the Arabs into a credible fighting
force. Of course, such a small force would be completely vulnerable in
the event of a Turkish attack on that port town, Brémond argued, so he
further proposed that a sizable contingent of British soldiers—at least
a brigade, perhaps two—be brought from Egypt to secure the area and
provide protection. If the French colonel had his way, the Western
military presence in the Hejaz would be expanded from a tiny handful of
men—himself, Wilson, and Parker, the few British logistics officers
scattered along the shoreline—to anywhere between three thousand and ten
thousand.</p>
<p>Left unspoken in this proposition was how it neatly dovetailed with
France’s—or at least Colonel Brémond’s—hidden agenda. With a large force
of Allied troops on the ground, it would be that much easier to monitor
and control events, and to prevent the Arab Revolt from spreading north
into Syria. Even better, with an absolutely minimal French investment,
its two hundred soldiers alongside Britain’s thousands, France would
achieve a physical military presence in the Middle East, and further
stake its claim to being a joint and equal partner with Britain in the
region.</p>
<p>Even without grasping Brémond’s ulterior motives, the commander of
the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Cairo, General Archibald Murray, had
given the idea a frosty reception. Tasked to launch an offensive into
southern Palestine on the far side of the Sinai Peninsula, and with his
army already being periodically poached by Western Front commanders
looking for fresh bodies to fling against the Germans in France, Murray
was adamantly opposed to parting with any more of his men for the
“sideshow” in Arabia.</p>
<p>Brémond had enjoyed much better luck in his approach to Reginald
Wingate. Indeed, the Sudan governor-general was a perfect British foil
for the Frenchman, a fervent believer in the importance of the Arab
rebellion, but just as fervently convinced that the rebels could never
carry the day on their own. Along with Brémond’s counsel, Wingate’s
conviction on this point was constantly reinforced by the two political
officers he had sent to Arabia, Wilson and Parker, both of whom believed
the revolt would soon collapse if foreign troops didn’t come in. Of
course, it was easy enough for Wingate to lobby for such a move, since
he didn’t have the soldiers to send; instead, they would have to be
taken off Murray in Egypt. The way Brémond figured it, with Wingate as
an ally it was simply a matter of waiting for the next Arab setback, at
which point they could join forces and, sidestepping Murray, appeal
directly to London for a military deployment.</p>
<p>Brémond didn’t have to wait long. In fact, an opportunity had
presented itself in those same few days that Lawrence was stranded in
Yenbo. In late October, news had come in of a large Turkish force
closing on Rabegh. The report had sown panic among the Arab forces in
the foothills above that vital port town, triggering a stampede toward
the coast. Seeing their opening, Wingate and Brémond had moved quickly.
Wingate fired off a cable to London urging that an Anglo-French force be
readied to land at Rabegh. Following Wingate’s lead, Brémond had a note
passed to the British Foreign Office announcing that while he was fully
prepared to speed his idled soldiers and artillery guns to Rabegh’s
relief, it would be “highly imprudent” to do so “unless they could be
protected by a sufficient escort to secure their not falling into enemy
hands.” As for just what size “escort” the French colonel was looking
for, Wingate provided his government with the specifics: a minimum of
six battalions, or some six thousand British soldiers.</p>
<p>Faced with such an urgent appeal, the British War Committee came
close to approving the proposal, and probably would have if not for the
strenuous objections of General Murray, the man on the hook for
supplying those six thousand troops. On November 2, the War Committee
had declined to order any deployments out of Egypt, but instead
suggested that Brémond and Wingate rustle up whatever soldiers they
could under their commands and rush them to Rabegh—a suggestion that
obviously led the coescalationists right back to square one.</p>
<p>If disappointed by London’s decision, Brémond was surely heartened by
a new bit of information that came in that same day. As Alfred Parker in
Rabegh reported, there was no Turkish force closing on that town, and
there never had been; rather, the entire crisis had been sparked by an
erroneous rumor. The embarrassing episode, Parker acidly noted, “proves
that Rabegh force could not stand for a moment if threatened.… I
consider best solution would be British Govt. [War Committee] to
reconsider their decision and land brigade at Rabegh.”</p>
<p>That was music to Brémond’s ears, and he could be confident that a
new chance to lobby the War Committee would soon present itself; after
all, if the rebels had been put to flight by a rumor, what was going to
happen when the Turks launched a bona fide attack?</p>
<p>It was at this precise juncture, however, that T. E. Lawrence
reappeared in Jeddah.</p>
<p>As Lawrence expounded over dinner at the French mission, from the
time he had spent with Ali in Rabegh and Faisal in Hamra, he was now
convinced that any Allied military presence in Arabia should be an
absolutely minimal one; Hussein’s rebels would gladly receive weapons
and military training from Christian “infidel” advisors, whether they
were French or British, but anything more expansive was sure to fuel
fears of a European takeover and cause the revolt’s destruction from
within.</p>
<p>This was an analysis upon which reasonable men could disagree—and
Brémond did disagree, strenuously—but what truly stunned him was
Lawrence’s further contention that, quite aside from the religious
issue, such a force was altogether unnecessary. In his view, the
strength of the Arab fighters was as a defensive force, and commanding
as they did the narrow gorges and defiles that stood between Medina and
the coast, their position was all but impregnable to any conceivable
approach a Turkish army might make. So long as the Arabs held those
heights—and it was hard to see how they might ever be dislodged given
that the terrain was completely unsuited to the Turks’ advantage in
artillery and airplanes—Rabegh was perfectly safe.</p>
<p>Brémond was too polite a host to point out that this assertion was
being made by a man who had observed the rebels in the field for all of
one day, but he surely asked how this view squared with the recent rebel
stampede above Rabegh; apparently the Arabs didn’t share in the belief
of their positions’ impregnability if they were willing to abandon them
on a rumor. It was perhaps in reply to this line of questioning that
Lawrence made a further assertion: it had been Ali’s men who had
panicked at Rabegh, not Faisal’s, and it was Faisal who was the true
leader of the revolt.</p>
<p>Even more than Lawrence’s other opinions, it was this declaration
that flabbergasted Brémond. The colonel had yet to meet Faisal, but
nothing he’d heard suggested Hussein’s third son as either a natural or
decisive leader; instead, as Brémond would shortly report to Paris,
“[Faisal] talks a lot but says nothing. He acts little and does
nothing.”</p>
<p>But from a French perspective, the thought of promoting Faisal’s
leadership was also alarming. By all accounts, he was far more
distrusting of the European allies than his older brothers. There was
also the matter of his long dalliance with the pro-independence Arab
conspirators in Syria. Even if Djemal Pasha had hunted down many of
those conspirators, no doubt parts of the network still existed, and for
a France eager to keep the Arab Revolt well away from Syria, there could
be no prospect more worrisome than the ascent of Faisal.</p>
<p>Brémond might have been tempted to write Lawrence off as a
particularly irksome dinner guest, his bold assertions those of a naïf
infused with a sense of self-importance, save for a couple of details.
One was his manner. He stated his views with utter and unshakable
confidence, a confidence bordering on the impertinent when it came to
military protocol; no matter the seniority or rank of those who
disagreed with him, the army captain with the icy blue eyes refused to
back down. Another was the effect he’d had on Admiral Wemyss. Whatever
the admiral’s views on a deployment to Arabia had been previously, it
was clear he was much impressed by Lawrence, and now held very similar
opinions; in fact, Wemyss was planning to accompany Lawrence to Khartoum
so that they might make their case to Wingate jointly. Not surprisingly,
it made Édouard Brémond extremely apprehensive of what might happen once
these two came into contact with the man who up until then had been his
closest British ally.</p>
<p>After that dinner in Jeddah, Colonel Brémond disparagingly remarked
that Lawrence had become a “vassal” of Faisal. As he got to know
Lawrence better in the months ahead, however, Brémond would conclude
he’d had it the wrong way around, that the unassuming little British
captain had a selfish, even sinister, motive in promoting Faisal. If a
British brigade was put ashore in Arabia, a proper military command
structure would be established, one that would leave no role for an
inexperienced desk officer like Captain Lawrence. Absent that
intervention, it would be up to Hussein’s sons to carry the day, and in
the soft and hesitant figure of Faisal, Brémond deduced, Lawrence had
found a man he might bend to his will, allowing him to become the unseen
kingmaker of Arabia.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON THE SAME day that Lawrence set out for Faisal’s camp in the
mountains, October 22, a most curious drama had unfolded in northern
Scotland. It began when a Scandinavian-American Line passenger ship, the
Oskar II, put in at the coal refueling station in the Orkney Islands
town of Kirkwall.</p>
<p>Although the Oskar II was transiting between two neutral
countries—she was out of Denmark and bound for New York City—the Orkneys
were an extremely sensitive area for the British military, the site of
their main wartime naval base in the harbor known as Scapa Flow. Always
on the lookout for spies or saboteurs, a team of British police
inspectors boarded the Swedish-registered ship for a routine check of
the passports and luggage of its passengers. On that day, they found
someone of great interest. He was a stout forty-one-year-old Ottoman
citizen who had recently crossed into neutral Denmark from Germany.</p>
<p>Detaining the man on deck in plain view of other passengers, the
inspectors made a thorough search of his cabin; as they subsequently
informed the Oskar II captain in the presence of gawking passengers,
they found it “full of German stuff.” Taken off the ship in a police
launch, the man was held that night under guard at a Kirkwall hotel,
then transferred the next day to the Scottish mainland. Brought to
London, by the morning of October 25 he was undergoing questioning by
Basil Thomson, the head of Scotland Yard’s Criminal Investigation
Department, and the official in charge of tracking subversives and spies
in wartime Britain.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the Oskar II reached New York City that the British
detention of Aaron Aaronsohn became publicly known. It immediately
caused a stir in certain circles, especially within the American Zionist
community and among those agricultural scientists who had come to know
Aaronsohn during his extended prewar visits to the United States. For
members of both these groups, it seemed utterly inconceivable that the
Jewish agronomist might be an agent for the Central Powers, the
accusation implicit in his detention at Kirkwall. On the other hand,
there was the disquieting fact that he had chosen to remain in
Ottoman-ruled Palestine at the war’s outbreak, even as many other Jewish
émigrés had fled to neutral nations or British-ruled Egypt. Then there
was the highly suspicious nature of his journey across war-torn central
Europe to reach Denmark. Certainly that trip could not have been made
without the approval of high officials in both the Turkish and German
governments.</p>
<p>At least one of Aaronsohn’s fellow passengers on the Oskar II
fervently believed in his innocence. A German Jewish socialite named
Olga Bernhardt, she had become very friendly with the agronomist during
the voyage from Copenhagen, and she sought to publicize his plight once
she reached America. That effort badly backfired when, apparently
alerted by Bernhardt, the New York Evening Post instead characterized
Aaronsohn’s detention as that of a dangerous Turkish spy. With that, any
campaign within the American scientific or Jewish communities to win his
release quickly fizzled.</p>
<p>Which actually suited Aaron Aaronsohn just fine. That’s because his
“arrest” at Kirkwall had been an elaborate charade. He was a spy, or at
least he very much wanted to be, but for the other side in the conflict,
and his removal from the Oskar II with its theatric touches—placing him
under guard in public view, the semipublic announcement of what had been
found in his luggage—was tailored to throw German and Turkish
counterintelligence agents off the scent and protect his spy ring back
in Palestine. This couldn’t have been achieved by Aaronsohn simply
falling from view. Instead, he needed the Germans and Turks to “know”
that his intention had been to go to America, that the British had
grabbed their “dangerous Turkish spy” off the decks of the Oskar II
quite by chance. To this end, the portrait rendered of him by the
Evening Post was just a bonus. As Aaronsohn noted in his diary that
night in his Kirkwall hotel room, “The game is in play.”</p>
<p>It was very much a marathon game. It had been well over three months
since Aaronsohn had left Palestine with Djemal Pasha’s vesika, or travel
permit, in hand. First, there had been a monthlong delay in
Constantinople as he negotiated the bureaucratic maze to obtain the
documentation needed for his further passage to Vienna. From the
Austrian capital, it had been a simple matter to continue on to Berlin,
but then came another monthlong delay as he tried to figure out the
crossing into neutral Denmark. The scientist had finally achieved that
in mid-September, but then more hurdles: first, making contact with
British counterintelligence agents, then convincing them his incredible
story was true.</p>
<p>The British spy handlers in Denmark may not have been thoroughly
assured on this last point, but after some hesitation, they decided it
would be Scotland Yard’s problem to sort out. In mid-October, they
arranged to put Aaronsohn on board the Oskar II, sailing from Copenhagen
harbor on the nineteenth, while further arranging his detention in
Kirkwall in three days’ time. Thus the British were finally about to
“bring in from the cold” a would-be spy who had spent over a year
desperately trying to get their attention.</p>
<p>As he waited for the Oskar II to sail, Aaronsohn was acutely aware
that he was about to cross a point of no return, that whatever happened
next, his former life as a simple scientist in Palestine was gone
forever. In Copenhagen, he wrote several coded letters that, through
intermediaries, he hoped would reach his coconspirators back in Athlit;
in them, he wrote with happy anticipation about his imminent departure
for New York—for the benefit of German and Turkish counterintelligence
agents—but used certain words and phrases to indicate that his real
destination was Britain.</p>
<p>He also wrote a very long letter to Judge Julian Mack, one of the
American benefactors of the Athlit research station, in which he laid
bare his reasons for the dangerous path he was now taking. In what was
part confession—indeed, this was how Aaronsohn would later describe
it—and part manifesto, he wrote out an anguished narrative of what had
occurred in Palestine over the previous two years, how it had inexorably
brought him to the point where he was prepared to betray the nation that
had given his family refuge. “Would I have left the country and openly
taken service on the English side,” he wrote, “it would already have
been bad enough. My character, my standing would be impaired. But I did
worse. I stood where I was, I organized a whole movement, I became
connected with the Intelligence Office, as people who are afraid of
words call it. I do not like mincing words. Put it clearly, and I became
a Spy.”</p>
<p>Aaronsohn intended the letter to be shown to other American Jewish
benefactors of the research station, many of whom did not consider
themselves Zionists and were sure to be shocked by its contents. This
may have been the reason for its oratorical, even somewhat histrionic
tone as the scientist explained what he and his confederates felt they
were fighting for: “Nobody can say we were doing it for the sake of vile
money.… We are not doing it for honours either.… We do not do it for
vengeance; we do it because we hope we are serving our Jewish cause.… We
considered it our duty to do our share, and we are still foolish enough
to believe in right and justice and recognition of the Cause we are
serving.”</p>
<p>That was all well and good, but a loftiness unlikely to fully satisfy
Basil Thomson. As the head of Scotland Yard’s Criminal Investigation
Department, Thomson had interviewed hundreds of would-be spies by the
close of 1916, and interrogated many more who had proven to be German
moles. Certainly neither the résumé nor the recent travels of the man
brought into his office on October 25 were the stuff to inspire
confidence.</p>
<p>Yet the longer Aaron Aaronsohn talked, the more Thomson was persuaded
that here was the genuine article, a man anxious to help the British war
effort—albeit for his own motives—and possessed of the skills and acumen
to do so. It was not just Aaronsohn’s meticulously observed details of
the Turkish war machine—a bit out of date now, perhaps, but Aaronsohn
claimed to have a network in place to constantly update them—but his
seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of most every aspect of the region. For
the detective, the decisive moment came when the topic turned to the
British army’s current slow-motion advance across the Sinai Peninsula in
prelude to their offensive into Palestine.</p>
<p>One key reason for that army’s glacial pace over the arid wasteland
was the need to haul water all the way from Egypt. That had meant laying
a pipeline, which had also necessitated the building of a railroad.
According to Aaronsohn, Thomson recounted in his memoir, it all could
have been avoided. “There is water right there in the desert, three
hundred feet down,” he said. “All you have to do is drill for it.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that?” Thomson would recall asking.</p>
<p>Aaronsohn shrugged. “The rocks indicate it. And [first-century
Jewish-Roman chronicler] Flavius Josephus corroborates it. He wrote that
he could walk for a whole day south from Caesarea and never leave
flourishing gardens.… Where there were gardens, there must have been
water. Where is that water now?”</p>
<p>“And what can you do?” Thomson asked.</p>
<p>“If I were with the British army, I could show the engineers where to
drill. I guarantee that they would find enough water for the army
without having to bring a single drop from Cairo.”</p>
<p>Impressed, Thomson decided to pass Aaronsohn on to the central
headquarters of the British military, the Imperial General Staff on
Whitehall Street. There, a young major, Walter Gribbon, was detailed to
further debrief the agronomist, a first step toward determining just
what should be done with him. On October 28, three days after arriving
in London, Aaronsohn wrote his brother Alexander and sister Rivka in New
York. Along with great relief at finally reaching England—“for the past
few nights I have slept in peace, untroubled by nightmares”—he admitted
to a pang of regret:</p>
<p>“Here, I had the good fortune to meet eager ears and open minds. I
have reason to believe that had our [British] friends been better
informed sooner, they would have acted in consequence. Had I come
earlier I should have probably served our cause better, spared our
country some suffering, and rendered more efficient service to our
friends.”</p>
<p>When he wrote those words, Aaronsohn didn’t know the half of it. On
the previous day, as he was again being debriefed by Walter Gribbon, a
friendly, slightly chubby man in his midthirties had come into the
office to briefly sit in on the proceedings. During a break in Gribbon’s
questioning, the visitor inquired after Aaronsohn’s views on Zionism, of
where exactly he placed himself amid the galaxy of Jewish political
thought. The visitor had listened intently and, before leaving, handed
Aaronsohn a calling card, asking if he might be so good as to drop by
the indicated address at 9:30 a.m. in three days’ time. Aaronsohn
readily agreed. The address on the calling card was 30 Broadway Gate,
the London residence of the MP from Hull Central, Sir Mark Sykes.</p>
<p>BY NOVEMBER 15, 1916, Brigadier General Gilbert Clayton faced a
conundrum as old as the superior-subordinate relationship: how to
sabotage the plans of his boss without revealing his own hand in the
endeavor. Adding to Clayton’s difficulties on that day was that to come
up with a feasible scheme, he urgently needed to speak with one of his
own subordinates, Captain T. E. Lawrence. Unfortunately, Lawrence was
quite unreachable, in transit somewhere along the thousand-mile stretch
of desert and Nile River towns that lay between Khartoum and Cairo.</p>
<p>The problem was that, once again, Reginald Wingate was lobbying
London for a large-scale military intervention in Arabia, and this time
suggesting that both Lawrence and Sheikh Faisal were in favor of it.
Until Lawrence resurfaced, there was no way of knowing what he might
have said to Wingate, and thus no easy way to thwart the plan.</p>
<p>In whatever course he chose, however, Gilbert Clayton did have a
distinct built-in advantage. That’s because within the maze of
overlapping bureaucracies the British had created in wartime Egypt, no
one was precisely sure where Clayton’s job duties began and where they
ended. That uncertainty had stood the unassuming spymaster with the
pencil-thin mustache in very good stead in past crises, and it was about
to do so again.</p>
<p>At the war’s outset, Clayton had been the chief British intelligence
officer in Cairo, a post that made him the overall supervisor of
Lawrence and the other Intrusives who set up shop at the Savoy Hotel in
late 1914. In turn, Clayton had answered to the chief British civil
authority in Egypt, High Commissioner Henry McMahon. Keeping matters
simple, all ultimately answered to the Foreign Office in London.</p>
<p>That neat chain of command had turned both murky and contentious when
Egypt became the chief staging ground for British military operations
against the Ottoman Empire, operations that fell under the aegis of the
War Office. In the inevitable turf war between the resident
administration and the incoming generals of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force, those military intelligence units answerable to the War
Office—Cairo was suddenly awash in them—saw little reason to tolerate a
competing one answerable to the Foreign Office. Tensions had only grown
worse when Clayton’s Intrusives were given a clearer mandate in early
1916 and institutionalized as the Arab Bureau. For months afterward,
General Archibald Murray, the commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary
Force—or EEF—tried unsuccessfully to wrest control of Clayton’s outfit
from McMahon, before finally settling for a quasi-supervisory role.</p>
<p>But the battle for primacy in Cairo was actually a three-way fight,
and just to keep things lively, this third contender was a thousand
miles away in Khartoum. Reginald Wingate, the governor-general of the
Sudan, was also the sirdar, or commander in chief, of the Egyptian army,
a wholly different military force than Murray’s EEF. As might be
predicted, none of these three men—McMahon, Murray, Wingate—liked each
other very much, and joined to their intrigues against one another were
the competing bureaucracies of London and British India, each with its
own set of interests and allies and adversaries in the Egyptian capital.
On top of this was the official indigenous Egyptian government that,
though it was quite toothless, various British officials periodically
felt the need to pretend to consult in order to maintain the appearance
that the wishes of the actual inhabitants of Egypt somehow mattered.</p>
<p>Amid this impenetrable tangle, though, one name had a way of popping
up with surprising regularity: Gilbert Clayton. By the autumn of 1916,
the spymaster was simultaneously the head of the Arab Bureau (answerable
to McMahon), the “Cairo Agent of the Sirdar” (Wingate), and the chief
liaison officer between EEF (Murray) and the British Egyptian civilian
administration (McMahon). In his spare time, he also directed an
internal spying network that kept watch on both local dissident leaders
and representatives of the indigenous Egyptian government, a task
simplified by the fact that the two were often one and the same. As
Lawrence would later write of Clayton, “It was not easy to descry his
influence. He was like water, or permeating oil, creeping silently and
insistently through everything. It was not possible to say where Clayton
was and was not, and how much really belonged to him.”</p>
<p>Paradoxically, considering the sabotage mission he was contemplating
that November, of the various competitors, Gilbert Clayton was
personally closest to Wingate. A trim man in his midfifties with a fine
white mustache, Wingate was a legend in East Africa, having fought
alongside Kitchener in the Mahdi War of the late 1890s, and then staying
on to rule over British Sudan for the next seventeen years. For five of
those years, Clayton had served as Wingate’s personal secretary in
Khartoum, and he’d been deeply impressed by the man’s political acumen.
The sirdar had also been one of the first British leaders in the region
to appreciate the importance of the Arab Revolt in the summer of 1916,
and had been tireless in promoting their cause to London.</p>
<p>The recurrent sticking point, however, was that nearly all of
Wingate’s information on Arabia came either from the two Sudan hands he
had sent there, Cyril Wilson and Alfred Parker, or from Colonel Édouard
Brémond. From these three, the sirdar had heard a steady litany of the
rebels’ incompetence, an unending drumbeat on the need for a large
Allied force. This was a course that virtually everyone in the Arab
Bureau strongly opposed, and it had been partly in hopes of bringing a
new perspective to the matter that Clayton had arranged to send T. E.
Lawrence on his fact-finding mission to the Hejaz in October. As Clayton
had expected, the visit had convinced Lawrence that escalation would be
folly—which was also why he had approved Lawrence’s detour to Khartoum
in order to brief Wingate directly.</p>
<p>At first, that stratagem appeared to pay off. Lawrence had arrived in
Khartoum on November 7, just days after Wingate’s first intervention
request had been vetoed by the War Committee, and whatever Lawrence said
to the sirdar seemed to greatly mollify him. Obviously impressed by
Lawrence’s knowledge of the Arab world, and by his account of the
defensive capabilities of Faisal’s troops, Wingate cabled Clayton that
same day outlining a radically scaled-back plan: to urge Brémond to send
his technical advisors on to the Hejaz but without the thousands of
British troops as protection, and to give Faisal’s men the “moral and
material support (aeroplanes, guns and machine guns) necessary to enable
them to continue their defensive [sic] in hills.”</p>
<p>But if Clayton thought that settled the matter, he was soon set
right. The next day, November 8, the French government had pressed the
War Committee to reconsider its decision, stressing that while Brémond
was anxious to send his advisors to Rabegh, “they cannot provide the
kind of field force that British infantry would form. Sending these
French units to Rabegh on their own would mean unnecessarily risking
their sacrifice, thereby handing to the Turks the guns and machine guns
intended for the Sherif’s army.”</p>
<p>In his own cable shortly afterward, Wingate had thrown his support to
the Brémond/French argument anew, even if tempered somewhat by
Lawrence’s influence. Since it was possible that Faisal might on his own
block a Turkish advance toward Rabegh, as Lawrence maintained, Wingate
suggested that a British brigade be readied for deployment but only sent
ashore “at the last moment.” The sirdar further intimated that this was
a course of action approved by the one British officer who had actually
been to the war front, Captain Lawrence.</p>
<p>To Clayton, reading this cable in Cairo, it made little sense.
Lawrence had surely been around the military long enough to know that a
force readied for deployment would be deployed, bringing about the very
situation—the implosion of the Arab Revolt—that he had warned against.
How had Lawrence possibly acquiesced to this? It was a question with no
immediate answer. Lawrence had left Khartoum on November 11, and would
be incommunicado until he reached Cairo. In the meantime, the War
Committee, under intense French pressure, was pondering its next
move.</p>
<p>No record exists of what was said when Clayton finally sat Lawrence
down in the Arab Bureau offices on November 16, and neither man was to
detail that meeting in their later writing. From anecdotal evidence, it
appears Lawrence either maintained that Wingate had somehow
misunderstood him, or, if admitting to having agreed to Wingate’s plan,
claimed he thought he was responding to a purely hypothetical
scenario.</p>
<p>But if Lawrence did equivocate about his meetings with Wingate, there
is another possible explanation. On November 6, the day before he had
arrived in Khartoum, it was announced that Henry McMahon was being
dismissed as Egyptian high commissioner, to be replaced by Reginald
Wingate. That news put Lawrence in a nasty squeeze in Khartoum; he was
not only sitting across from the biggest proescalationist in the British
power structure, but the man about to become his overall boss. With this
in mind, the most likely scenario is that Lawrence agreed with Wingate’s
proposal to his face in Khartoum, in hopes that he could help in its
scuttling once he got back to the more amenable climes of Cairo.</p>
<p>Certainly that was what he now set out to do. At the end of his
meeting with Clayton on November 16, Lawrence returned to his office and
quickly wrote up a new memorandum on the situation in the Hejaz, one so
blunt and shorn of niceties that it left no room for misinterpretation.
In terms of length, there is probably no document that more profoundly
influenced the British war effort in Arabia than the four-page
memorandum he handed to Gilbert Clayton the next day.</p>
<p>In that memo, Lawrence held up and then knocked down virtually every
possible argument for a large Allied military presence in Arabia—and he
did so by turning the escalationists’ own arguments against them. While
it was true that the Arabs couldn’t defend Rabegh if the Turks broke
through Faisal’s mountain defenses, he pointed out, neither could an
Allied force held somewhere in reserve as Wingate proposed. That’s
because, once through the mountains, the Turks would reach the port town
in a mere four days, hardly time for even a fully readied force standing
by in Egypt to be brought down and deployed.</p>
<p>This, then, left the argument of deploying now, while Faisal’s men
still held the mountains, but the issue there was deep-rooted Arab
distrust. “They are our very good friends while we respect their
independence,” Lawrence wrote. “They are deeply grateful for the help we
have given them, but they fear lest we may make it a claim upon them
afterwards. We have appropriated too many Moslem countries for them to
have any real trust in our disinterestedness and they are terribly
afraid of an English occupation of Hejaz. If the British with or without
the Sherif’s approval landed at Rabegh an armed force strong enough to …
organize a position there, they would, I am convinced, say ‘we are
betrayed’ and scatter to their tents.”</p>
<p>This was, of course, the same basic argument other antiescalationists
had been making all along, but Lawrence was able to give it a wholly new
twist by virtue of his firsthand look at the region. As he’d discovered
in his trek to Faisal’s camp, there were other water sources in the
mountains above Rabegh that, until then, no one had known about. If Arab
resistance in those mountains collapsed—a collapse that, again, was sure
to accompany an Allied escalation—the Turks could draw on those water
sources to sidestep Rabegh altogether and continue on toward Mecca
unimpeded. In this scenario, the port town would be transformed from
vitally strategic to utterly superfluous.</p>
<p>But Lawrence wasn’t done yet. Recognizing that Colonel Brémond and
his French superiors were the prime movers behind the escalation
push—and were likely to continue that push no matter what the War
Committee decided during this latest go-around—he set out to demolish
their rationale for needing a British protection force for their
technical unit in Rabegh. If the Turks did break through the mountains
to advance on Rabegh, he pointed out, the Allies would still have four
days’ notice before they got there. In that scenario, the Royal Navy
would have more than enough time to evacuate two hundred French military
advisors, but probably not enough time to also evacuate thousands of
British troops and all their valuable war matériel. Remarkably, this
rather glaring hole in the French argument doesn’t seem to have been
noticed by anyone previously.</p>
<p>Except, Lawrence maintained, the French plan had never been about
defending Rabegh anyway. Rather, it was about safeguarding their
imperialist designs in the Middle East by seeking to destroy the Arab
Revolt from within: “They say, ‘Above all things the Arabs must not take
Medina. This can be assured if an allied force landed at Rabegh. The
tribal contingents will go home, and we will be the sole bulwark of the
Sherif in Mecca. At the end of the war we give him Medina as his
reward.’ This is of course a definite policy, agreeable to their larger
schemes,” but the result, Lawrence contended, would be to leave, “the
Franco-British force a disconsolate monument on the dusty beach at
Rabegh.”</p>
<p>It was an astounding accusation to make against Britain’s closest
ally, built as it was on an extrapolation—and a rather sweeping
mischaracterization—of what Colonel Brémond had told Lawrence in Jeddah.
But perhaps it was not so astounding to a British military leadership
grown increasingly resentful and suspicious of their French allies. On
the Western Front, the British were now doing a majority of the
fighting—and dying—as a shattered and depleted French army tried to
rebuild itself. Over the past five months, in a campaign meant to
relieve pressure on the battered French garrison in Verdun, British
general Douglas Haig had repeatedly and futilely hurled his army against
the German trenchworks along the river Somme; the 400,000 British dead
and wounded at the Somme were double that suffered by the French. On the
more local front, surely any British commander privy to the manner in
which the French had repeatedly blocked the Alexandretta plan, as well
as their continuing ambivalence over the coming British offensive in
Palestine—an ambivalence born of fears that success would take the
British into regions the French were claiming for themselves in the
postwar world—were prepared to accept most any charge of Gallic perfidy
at face value. Of course, Lawrence’s accusation was also guaranteed to
play well to the imperialist segment of the British government, eager to
somehow keep France out of the Middle East altogether.</p>
<p>The effect of Lawrence’s memo, then, was to transform the question of
an Allied troop deployment to Arabia from its military context and
propel it into the political. To wit, those in the British power
structure favoring escalation might actually be unwitting dupes of a
cleverly constructed French trap, one designed to both sabotage the Arab
Revolt and, by the diversion of British troops to Arabia, hobble the
offensive in Palestine. By the autumn of 1916, it was hard to conceive
of any accusation more injurious to a British officer’s reputation than
that of useful fool to the French, but however obliquely, this was
essentially the charge Lawrence was laying before Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>But what to do with such an incendiary document? This was the new
dilemma facing Gilbert Clayton on the morning of November 17. As
Lawrence was attached to the Arab Bureau, standard procedure called for
Clayton to first forward the memo to the bureau’s overseer, Henry
McMahon. That, however, would have been preaching to the choir, and as
McMahon was already on his way out as high commissioner, anything he
might do with the document could have only muted effect. Conversely,
Clayton had the option of sending it to Reginald Wingate in hopes that
the sirdar might finally see the error of his escalationist ways and
change course—except Lawrence had been so derisive of the standby-force
plan that the man who had authored it was bound to get his back up.</p>
<p>When it comes to political infighting, though, sometimes one’s
bitterest enemy can be turned into a temporary ally. Ever since arriving
in Cairo, General Archibald Murray had set out to control or neuter
Gilbert Clayton and his Arab Bureau in any way he could. In a fit of
pique after failing to have the bureau put under his command, Murray had
gone so far as to order his own intelligence units not to cooperate with
Clayton’s outfit. Of more immediate interest to Clayton on November 17,
however, was Murray’s implacable opposition to sending troops to Arabia.
He’d made his feelings on the topic clear at an interagency conference
in September.</p>
<p>“There is no good telling me that you only want this and that,” he’d
railed at Wingate’s deputy, Cyril Wilson. “From the experience of war,
and experience of recent campaigns, it is absolutely clear that you
start and you grow. You start with a brigade, that brigade wants some
artillery, then aeroplanes and camels. Then comes a request that the
force be moved to another point about ten miles [away], which it is
absolutely essential to hold. So the campaign grows.”</p>
<p>With all this in mind, it apparently occurred to Clayton that
Archibald Murray might be just the man who’d know what to do with
Lawrence’s memo.</p>
<p>For the EEF commander, that four-page report must have arrived like a
rare gift. Here was not only a précis that dismantled the intervention
argument on its merits, but, as an added windfall, hinted darkly that it
was all a French plot. He ordered that its author be immediately brought
to his office.</p>
<p>Archibald Murray was a famously nervous man. During a pivotal moment
in the opening days of the war, he had fainted away from the unrelenting
tension, an episode that spurred shocked whispers throughout the British
high command and probably contributed to Murray’s demotion from army
chief of staff, the number two position in the military hierarchy, in
1915. His transfer to Egypt hadn’t seemed to improve matters, as
Lawrence discovered when, answering Murray’s summons to headquarters
that day, he was intercepted by Murray’s deputy, General Lynden-Bell. As
Lawrence recounted, “I was astonished when, as I came in, [Bell] jumped
to his feet, leaped forward, and gripped me by the shoulder, hissing,
‘Now you’re not to frighten him; don’t you forget what I say!’” The task
before Lawrence, Bell instructed, was to give Murray “a reassuring
picture of affairs, and yet not a rosy picture, since they could not
afford excursions either way.”</p>
<p>Lawrence seems to have managed this delicate balancing act when
finally set before Murray. And despite Murray’s reputation for
jumpiness, it soon became clear that when it came to bureaucratic
knifework, he had a pretty steady hand himself. Shortly after Lawrence
left his office, he fired off a cable to Wingate: “I have just seen
Lawrence on his return from visiting Faisal, and his opinion, in which I
understand you and Faisal concur, is so strongly against the dispatch of
white troops to Arabia that I venture to suggest for your consideration
that the CIGS [Chief of Imperial General Staff William Robertson] should
at once be informed.”</p>
<p>Perhaps this request for Wingate’s “consideration” was intended as
rhetorical flourish, for Murray had actually sent Lawrence’s memo to
Robertson fifteen minutes earlier. As for Wingate concurring with
Lawrence’s views, that would be a hard matter for Wingate to judge since
Murray didn’t bother sending him a copy of the memo.</p>
<p>In London, Lawrence’s report played to great effect, and was quickly
circulated through the upper reaches of both the Foreign and War
Offices. As usually happens in such cases, those who agreed with the
report burnished the résumé of its author to lend authority to his
assertions. On November 19, General Robertson, himself no fan of
intervention in Arabia, forwarded the memo to the cabinet while
describing its author as a man “said to have an intimate knowledge of
the Turks and the Arabs.”</p>
<p>To those in the cabinet unfamiliar with the intricacies of Arabian
policy, perhaps the memorandum’s most persuasive aspect was its
anti-French tilt. Interestingly, one official who tried to counter that
effect was Mark Sykes. “Captain Lawrence’s statement in regard to the
French attitude to the Arabs,” he complained to the Foreign Office, “and
his reference to their larger schemes of policy, must be the result of
some misunderstanding, either by Captain Lawrence of the French, or by
the French officers of their own Government’s intentions, as it seems in
no way to fit in with anything said or thought here or in Paris.”</p>
<p>His was a lonely voice, however, and little match for the
antiescalation/anti-French officials who now had their own “expert” in
the field to tout. Henry McMahon joined his efforts to that campaign in
a cable to Charles Hardinge, the permanent under secretary at the
Foreign Office. Noting that he’d always feared that an Allied
intervention in Arabia would corrode Arab morale, McMahon wrote that
Lawrence, “whom I knew to be a very shrewd observer, has confirmed my
opinion on this point. He has moreover told me, as doubtless you will
hear from the Sirdar [Wingate], that the French hold the same view, and
it is with this very object that they are magnifying the dangers of the
present situation and advocating action at Rabegh. Colonel Brémond even
went so far in a moment of confidence as to tell Lawrence that the
French object was to thus disintegrate Arab effort.… It is as well to
remember this in any proposals that the French may now or hereafter make
in regard to our joint assistance to the Sherif.”</p>
<p>Amid the tumult, Lawrence even saw his stock rise among those regular
army staff officers in Cairo who had previously held both him and the
Arab Bureau in contempt. “They began to be polite to me,” he wrote, “and
to say that I was observant, with a pungent style, and character.”</p>
<p>In the face of such an onslaught, the War Committee quietly shelved
the Rabegh proposal anew, but not before a rather humorous last act. It
wasn’t until November 21, four days after Lawrence’s memo reached
London, that Reginald Wingate finally saw the analysis with which he
supposedly fully concurred. After his angry cable demanding to know why
he’d been kept out of the loop, the War Committee mildly rebuked Murray
for failing to first solicit Wingate’s opinion, suggesting that “there
is apparently lack of co-ordination in [this] matter.”</p>
<p>Murray begged to differ. “I have always taken special care to keep
Sirdar fully informed of all I am doing,” he cabled London back, “and as
far as I know we are working in the closest touch. You may rely on me in
this matter. As regards Lawrence’s report. As Lawrence had just come to
me after spending several days with the Sirdar I naturally understood he
was fully in possession of Lawrence’s news. In fact Lawrence informed me
to this effect.”</p>
<p>A PERSONALITY TIC of Aaron Aaronsohn’s was to keep constant track of
the exercise he got in a day—the time spent bicycling, or the miles
walked—and to note it in his diary. It may have been born of his long
and only intermittently successful campaign to keep his weight down, but
the long walks he took during his stay in London served an additional
purpose: a way to distract himself from the maddening inertia of the
British government. As he noted in his diary for November 11, 1916, a
day in which he had covered some twelve miles, “If I brooded continually
over the situation, it would be enough to drive me mad. What slowness in
decisions! It will soon be two months since I have left Berlin, and
after all nothing of consequence has been done to discover [sic] the
Athlit people.”</p>
<p>Certainly the scientist had done his part. In the nearly three weeks
he’d been in London, he had compiled two long reports for his British
hosts, one chronicling the plight of the Armenians in Syria, the other
on conditions inside Palestine. This second report, running to forty-six
pages, provided the British with probably their most comprehensive look
inside any corner of the Ottoman Empire since the war had begun. Along
with a thorough rundown of the political and economic situation of the
region, Aaronsohn detailed the health and medical crises facing it, the
condition of its roads and railways, and meticulously listed the
location and size of most every Turkish garrison guarding the Syrian
coast. He even noted how many gendarmes currently policed Beirut, and
what weapons they carried.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Aaronsohn continued to be shuttled from office to
office, ministry to ministry, repeatedly asked to tell his whole story
over from the beginning. From no quarter, it seemed, was any effort
being made toward returning him to the war theater, let alone trying to
establish contact with his spy network back in Palestine.</p>
<p>Part of the issue was surely simple bureaucratic ineptitude, but
perhaps joined to this was a kind of collective disbelief on British
officials’ part at what they’d been handed. Then as now, intelligence
agents were accustomed to getting small slivers of information from a
wide variety of sources and trying to fit those slivers together to form
a portrait; it was very unusual, even suspicious, to be handed all of it
in one fell swoop. Contributing to this was an element of blithe
anti-Semitism that permeated the British government at the time—as it
did most European governments—which provided as a starting point that a
Jew wasn’t to be completely trusted until he proved himself worthy. In
the arena of espionage, that created a paradox hard to rise out of. In
an eleven-page analysis of Aaronsohn’s Palestine report, an intelligence
officer with the War Trade Intelligence Department conceded that the
information was “very correct” wherever it could be verified, but also
noted the informant was a Zionist and “of the Romanian type of Jew.”
That description apparently validated the agent’s conclusion: “Of course
we do not know the object of his visit to this country, but he might be
just as observant of things here as he has been in Turkey and a purveyor
of information of the conditions in England if he should get back to
Turkey.”</p>
<p>Naturally, all this was quite invisible to Aaronsohn. Instead, as the
interminable delay in London dragged on, the scientist increasingly
fretted that perhaps the problem stemmed from the conversation he’d had
at 30 Broadway Gate on October 30.</p>
<p>Answering that invitation to call on Mark Sykes, Aaronsohn had
appeared at the London townhouse promptly at 9:30. Repairing to the
exquisitely furnished study, the two men had soon been joined by a
third. This was Gerald FitzMaurice, the former dragoman to the British
embassy in Constantinople and now one of Sykes’s key allies in the
British power structure. While Aaronsohn provided few details of what
the three discussed during their ninety-minute conversation—“we talk of
Zionism,” he noted in his diary—he’d initially thought it had gone very
well. Weeks later, though, with his London stay reaching the one-month
mark, he fell to second-guessing. “I was probably too open with them,”
he wrote on November 24, “and they took it as a ruse. Or they are
distracted or turning a blind eye. Or maybe they saw it as naivete on my
part.”</p>
<p>In fact, Aaronsohn’s apprehensions couldn’t have been more misplaced.
Even if he kept it fairly discreet, Mark Sykes could be counted among a
small but influential group of British statesmen who had begun turning
their thoughts to the creation of a Jewish enclave in Palestine. What’s
more, in Aaron Aaronsohn he saw a man who might play a signal role in
bringing that idea to fruition.</p>
<p>Part of Sykes’s motive was rooted in religiosity. A devout Catholic,
he regarded a return of the ancient tribe of Israel to the Holy Land as
a way to correct a nearly two-thousand-year-old wrong. That view had
taken on new passion and urgency with the massacres of the Armenians. To
Sykes, in that ongoing atrocity, the Ottoman Empire had proven it could
never again be trusted to protect its religious minority populations. At
war’s end, the Christian and Jewish Holy Land of Palestine would be
taken from it, and the failure of the Crusades made right.</p>
<p>But it was not just religiosity; Sykes also saw a potentially huge
political advantage in this. The Jews were an influential but deeply
factionalized presence throughout the Western world, with most either
staying neutral or siding with the Central Powers so far in the war. A
chief cause was the inclusion of the notoriously anti-Semitic czarist
Russia in the Entente; even many British Jews could barely bring
themselves to support an alliance that included the despised regime in
Petrograd. By the Entente’s coming out in strong support of a Jewish
homeland in Palestine, Sykes believed, it would inevitably turn the
opinion of international Jewry toward its side. In turn, the advocacy of
American Jews—a small but powerful constituency—might finally provide
the spur for bringing the United States into the war.</p>
<p>This idea had already been promoted by a British statesman far more
powerful than Mark Sykes. In March 1915, the home secretary, Herbert
Samuel, had put to the cabinet that Palestine be made a British
protectorate at war’s end, and Jewish emigration actively encouraged
toward the eventual creation of a majority-Jewish enclave. That
resolution had been quickly and quietly shot down by the cabinet—the
potential ramifications of such a momentous course of action were too
far-reaching to countenance—but the notion had lingered on. When put in
charge of hashing out an agreement with Georges-Picot on a framework for
the postwar Middle East, Mark Sykes had taken it up again.</p>
<p>Immediately a potential obstacle presented itself. In his
correspondence with Emir Hussein, Henry McMahon had specifically listed
all those territories to be excluded from Arab sovereignty or subject to
later negotiation, but nowhere had he mentioned—let alone made a claim
for—Palestine. A strict reading of that correspondence, therefore, could
only lead to the conclusion that Palestine was to be part of the
independent Arab nation. That was not such a big obstacle as far as Mark
Sykes was concerned; since he and Georges-Picot were ignoring most other
promises made to Hussein as they carved the Middle East into imperial
spheres, what was the harm in adding Palestine to the mix? In the draft
version of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, that Syrian province had been
penciled in to fall under the “international administration” of Britain,
France, and Russia.</p>
<p>But even this arrangement wouldn’t bring about the British-protected
Jewish state that Sykes envisioned, nor could it possibly be a
harmonious one. As he conceded in a March 1916 cable to George Buchanan,
the British ambassador to Russia, “Arab Christians and Moslems alike
would fight in the matter to the last man against Jewish Dominion in
Palestine.” At the same time, the Jews were stoutly opposed to an
international administration there, while the French and Russians would
most certainly oppose a solely British one. To break the logjam, Sykes
informed Buchanan, he’d bandied about a new idea with Georges-Picot.</p>
<p>A peculiar signature of Sykes’s “solutions” was a kind of
quasi-scientific notion that fantastic intricacy might lead to ultimate
simplicity, as if the world were a motor vehicle in which, once its
myriad moving parts were properly aligned, all would hum along nicely.
So it was with his new idea for Palestine. Invoking Herbert Samuel’s
cabinet resolution of a year before, he proposed that Palestine be put
under a British protectorate; that Emir Hussein appoint one of his sons
as the sultan of an independent Palestine; that Britain and France
jointly act as the sultanate’s guarantor; while simultaneously a
“privileged chartered company” be established for the purpose of buying
up land for Jewish colonization. “I regret complicated problem requires
complex settlement,” Sykes concluded to Buchanan, “but under above
France gets a position in Palestine, Russian demands are satisfied,
Arabs have a Prince, Zionists get constitutional position and have
British protection, which I understand they desire.”</p>
<p>But lest the champagne be uncorked too soon, Sykes’s neat formula
elided some inconvenient realities. First, Samuel’s proposal of the
previous year had been rejected out of hand by the cabinet. Second,
Sykes had floated his plan without clearing it with any of his
superiors—and floated it to the chief French negotiator deciding the
future composition of the Middle East, no less. The day after Sykes’s
cable to Buchanan had reached his desk, Foreign Secretary Edward Grey
wrote a withering rebuke, ordering Sykes to “obliterate from his memory
that the Samuel’s Cabinet memorandum made any mention of a British
Protectorate.… I told Mr. Samuel at the time that a British Protectorate
was quite out of the question and Sir M. Sykes should never mention the
subject without making this clear.”</p>
<p>That slapdown may have led to greater discretion on Sykes’s part, but
it certainly didn’t cool his ardor for thinking creatively when it came
to Palestine. Through the spring and summer of 1916, he held a series of
private discussions with Moses Gaster, a leader of the British Zionist
movement, to keep the ideas percolating. It was when he met Aaron
Aaronsohn, however, that his passions returned to full flourish.
According to Sykes’s biographer, Roger Adelson, “If Rabbi Gaster a few
months before had provided Sykes with the grace-note of Zionism in
Europe, here was Aaronsohn who had actually played the trumpet in
Palestine. Sykes liked the sound of it.”</p>
<p>Zionist historian Isaiah Friedman was more specific: “How deeply Sir
Mark Sykes was impressed by Aaronsohn can be gathered from the confident
and close relations which later developed between them.” Citing other
British wartime officials who would soon be heavily influenced by
Aaronsohn’s views, Friedman argued that “it would be reasonable to
suppose that it was he who was the decisive influence in Sykes’s
conversion to Zionism.”</p>
<p>Indeed, even if he second-guessed it as his days in London dragged
on, Aaronsohn’s diary entry on the Broadway Gate meeting alluded to the
alliance that was already taking form. “FitzMaurice is in favour of the
‘fait accompli’ in Palestine,” he jotted, meaning a Jewish homeland,
“[but] the Allies are not yet in agreement.… [Sykes] hopes we will
succeed in altering the English viewpoint, ‘but it requires work.’”</p>
<p>Where Aaronsohn would contribute to that work was in Cairo. On
November 24, the same day that he worried in his diary over the
impression he might have made on Sykes, the scientist began packing for
the ship that would take him to Egypt. There he would join forces with
British military intelligence and try to reactivate his long-dormant spy
ring. In Egypt Aaronsohn would also eventually reunite with Mark Sykes.
Together, they would concoct a scheme that was to help dramatically
reshape the British government’s view on the creation of a
British-protected Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>DESPITE THE FUROR his November 17 memo had spawned, with Lawrence’s
brief sojourn to the Hejaz at an end, there were no plans to send him
back. To the contrary, Gilbert Clayton intended to put his literary
skills and fluency in Arabic to use in a new desk job in Cairo, heading
up the Arab Bureau’s fledgling propaganda department. That Lawrence was
to escape this mundane fate was due to the intercession of a most
unlikely patron: Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>Shortly after learning he would be taking over from McMahon in Cairo,
and thus in direct charge of the Hejaz operation, Wingate had petitioned
for an expanded roster of advisors and intelligence officers to serve in
Arabia; of most pressing concern was to attach a liaison officer to
Faisal in the mountains above Rabegh. The logical choice to head up this
British military mission, all agreed, was Lawrence’s titular supervisor
at the Arab Bureau, Stewart Newcombe. But with Newcombe on assignment in
Europe until sometime in December, Wingate urged that someone else be
sent as his temporary stand-in, and he quite naturally thought of the
impressive young captain who had just visited him in Khartoum. On
November 12, the day after Lawrence left the Sudanese capital, Wingate
cabled Clayton in Cairo suggesting that Lawrence be sent back to Yenbo
to manage things until Newcombe arrived. Clayton, thinking of the
propaganda department he wanted Lawrence to head, tried to deflect the
request, but Wingate wouldn’t take no for an answer.</p>
<p>“Pending Newcombe’s arrival,” he reiterated on November 14, “I wish
Lawrence to proceed to Yenbo by first possible opportunity. It is
vitally important to have an officer of his exceptional knowledge of
Arabs in close touch with Faisal [at this] critical juncture.” He then
reassured Clayton this was to be only a temporary measure, and that
Lawrence would be returned to Cairo once Newcombe came on the scene.
Under such pressure, Clayton had no choice but to relent.</p>
<p>Of course, all this occurred before Lawrence wrote his incendiary
memorandum taking direct aim at Wingate’s plans in Arabia. By the time
Wingate saw that memo, his lavish praise of Lawrence was already a
matter of record, as was his insistence that Lawrence return to Yenbo.
Even if Wingate wished to punish the young captain for his temerity,
there was now no graceful way to do it.</p>
<p>But excelling at bureaucratic infighting is not simply about coming
out on top. True mastery comes with the ability to so cover one’s tracks
as to appear utterly blameless, and this was a game Clayton and Lawrence
played with consummate skill. Before the month of November was over,
Colonel Brémond would receive a stern telegram from the commander in
chief of the French armed forces, Marshal Joseph Joffre. After obliquely
referring to an “agreement” worked out with the British—the Sykes-Picot
pact—Joffre rebuked Brémond for ever suggesting that France wished to
prevent an Arab capture of Medina. “The already known state of mind of
the British and the Sherif could lead to the belief that we are trying
to renege on the arrangements made and could have serious consequences
for the development of our plans in the Levant. It is important,
therefore, that your attitude does not lend itself to such an
interpretation.”</p>
<p>The sandbagging of Reginald Wingate was even more impressive,
however. On November 23, as the tempest over Lawrence’s memorandum
continued to rage, Clayton sent a “private” cable to Wingate in Khartoum
suggesting that all blame for the controversy rested with Murray.
Perhaps calculating that the bad blood between the sirdar and the EEF
commander meant the particulars would never get sorted out, Clayton went
so far as to suggest that it was Murray who had compelled Lawrence to
write the offending report.</p>
<p>Evidently, Wingate had a pronounced naïve streak: “I have no doubt
that Lawrence has done all this in perfectly good faith,” he wrote Cyril
Wilson on the same day he received Clayton’s cable, “but he appears to
me to be a visionary and his amateur soldiering has evidently given him
an exaggerated idea of the soundness of his views on purely military
matters.” Clearly alluding to Murray, he went on, “I am principally
annoyed in all this matter, not so much on account of the apparent want
of straightness on the part of certain people who should be above that
sort of thing, but on account of the huge loss of time when I am working
at very high pressure.”</p>
<p>Either Wingate never did figure out the extent to which he had been
played by Clayton and Lawrence, or he was an unusually forgiving man; in
just eight months, he would spearhead the effort to award Lawrence the
Victoria Cross, Britain’s highest military honor, for valor in the
field.</p>
<p>But not everyone was so quick to ascribe the best of intentions to
the upstart army captain. One who took a far more jaundiced view was
Cyril Wilson, the British official who had most closely observed
Lawrence in Arabia, and would serve as Lawrence’s direct superior
officer upon his return. Wilson argued strongly against that return on
even a temporary basis, and when presented with a fait accompli let
Gilbert Clayton know his feelings. “Lawrence wants kicking,” he wrote
the Arab Bureau head, “and kicking hard at that; then he would improve.
At present I look upon him as a bumptious young ass who spoils his
undoubted knowledge of Syrian Arabs etc. by making himself out to be the
only authority on war, engineering, running [His Majesty’s] ships and
everything else. He put every single person’s back up I’ve met, from the
Admiral down to the most junior fellow on the Red Sea.”</p>
<p>Of all the deceptions put to paper about the events of that November,
however, surely the most brazen was one Lawrence penned about himself.
It concerned that day toward the end of the month when he was summoned
to Clayton’s office and told he was being sent back to Arabia as a
temporary liaison officer to Faisal ibn Hussein. According to Lawrence’s
account in Seven Pillars, “I urged my complete unfitness for the
job.”</p>
