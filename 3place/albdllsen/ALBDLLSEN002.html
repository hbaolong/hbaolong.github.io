<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>On the morning of October 30, 1918, Colonel Thomas Edward Lawrence
received a summons to Buckingham Palace. The king had requested his
presence.</p>
<p>The collective mood in London that day was euphoric. For the past
four years and three months, Great Britain and much of the rest of the
world had been consumed by the bloodiest conflict in recorded history,
one that had claimed the lives of some sixteen million people across
three continents. Now, with a speed that scarcely could have been
imagined mere weeks earlier, it was all coming to an end. On that same
day, one of Great Britain’s three principal foes, the Ottoman Empire,
was accepting peace terms, and the remaining two, Germany and
Austria-Hungary, would shortly follow suit. Colonel Lawrence’s
contribution to that war effort had been in its Middle Eastern theater,
and he too was caught quite off guard by its rapid close. At the
beginning of that month, he had still been in the field assisting in the
capture of Damascus, an event that heralded the collapse of the Ottoman
army. Back in England for less than a week, he was already consulting
with those senior British statesmen and generals tasked with mapping out
the postwar borders of the Middle East, a once-fanciful endeavor that
had now become quite urgent. Lawrence was apparently under the
impression that his audience with King George V that morning was to
discuss those ongoing deliberations.</p>
<p>He was mistaken. Once at the palace, the thirty-year-old colonel was
ushered into a ballroom where, flanked by a half dozen dignitaries and a
coterie of costumed courtiers, the king and queen soon entered. A low
cushioned stool had been placed just before the king’s raised dais,
while to the monarch’s immediate right, the lord chamberlain held a
velvet pillow on which an array of medals rested. After introductions
were made, George V fixed his guest with a smile: “I have some presents
for you.”</p>
<p>As a student of British history, Colonel Lawrence knew precisely what
was about to occur. The pedestal was an investiture stool, upon which he
was to kneel as the king performed the elaborate, centuries-old
ceremony—the conferring of a sash and the medals on the pillow, the
tapping with a sword and the intoning of an oath—that would make him a
Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire.</p>
<p>It was a moment T. E. Lawrence had long dreamed of. As a boy, he was
obsessed with medieval history and the tales of King Arthur’s court, and
his greatest ambition, he once wrote, was to be knighted by the age of
thirty. On that morning, his youthful aspiration was about to be
fulfilled.</p>
<p>A couple of details added to the honor. Over the past four years,
King George had given out so many commendations and medals to his
nation’s soldiers that even knighthoods were now generally bestowed en
masse; in the autumn of 1918, a private investiture like Lawrence’s was
practically unheard of. Also unusual was the presence of Queen Mary. She
normally eschewed these sorts of ceremonies, but she had been so stirred
by the accounts of T. E. Lawrence’s wartime deeds as to make an
exception in his case.</p>
<p>Except Lawrence didn’t kneel. Instead, just as the ceremony got under
way, he quietly informed the king that he was refusing the honor.</p>
<p>There followed a moment of confusion. Over the nine-hundred-year
history of the monarchy, the refusal of knighthood was such an
extraordinary event that there was no protocol for how to handle it.
Eventually, King George returned to the lord chamberlain’s pillow the
medal he had been awkwardly holding, and under the baleful gaze of a
furious Queen Mary, Colonel Lawrence turned and walked away.</p>
<p>TODAY, MORE THAN seven decades after his death, and nearly a century
since the exploits that made him famous, Thomas Edward
Lawrence—“Lawrence of Arabia,” as he is better known—remains one of the
most enigmatic and controversial figures of the twentieth century.
Despite scores of biographies, countless scholarly studies, and at least
three movies, including one considered a masterpiece, historians have
never quite decided what to make of the young, bashful Oxford scholar
who rode into battle at the head of an Arab army and changed
history.</p>
<p>One reason for the contentiousness over his memory has to do with the
terrain he traversed. Lawrence was both eyewitness to and participant in
some of the most pivotal events leading to the creation of the modern
Middle East, and this is a corner of the earth where even the simplest
assertion is dissected and parsed and argued over. In the unending
debates over the roots of that region’s myriad fault lines, Lawrence has
been alternately extolled and pilloried, sanctified, demonized, even
diminished to a footnote, as political goals require.</p>
<p>Then there was Lawrence’s own personality. A supremely private and
hidden man, he seemed intent on baffling all those who would try to know
him. A natural leader of men, or a charlatan? A man without fear, or
both a moral and physical coward? Long before any of his biographers, it
was Lawrence who first attached these contradictory characteristics—and
many others—to himself. Joined to this was a mischievous streak, a
storyteller’s delight in twitting those who believed in and insisted on
“facts.” The episode at Buckingham Palace is a case in point. In
subsequent years, Lawrence offered several accounts of what had
transpired in the ballroom, each at slight variance with the others and
at even greater variance to the recollections of eyewitnesses. Earlier
than most, Lawrence seemed to embrace the modern concept that history
was malleable, that truth was what people were willing to believe.</p>
<p>Among writers on Lawrence, these contradictions have often spurred
descents into minutiae, arcane squabbles between those seeking to
tarnish his reputation and those seeking to defend it. Did he truly make
a particular desert crossing in forty-nine hours, as he claimed, or
might it have taken a day longer? Did he really play such a signal role
in Battle X, or does more credit belong to British officer Y or to Arab
chieftain Z? Only slightly less tedious are those polemicists wishing to
pigeonhole him for ideological ends. Lawrence, the great defender of the
Jewish people or the raging anti-Semite? The enlightened progressive
striving for Arab independence or the crypto-imperialist? Lawrence left
behind such a large body of writing, and his views altered so
dramatically over the course of his life, that it’s possible with
careful cherry-picking to both confirm and refute most every accolade
and accusation made of him.</p>
<p>Beyond being tiresome, the cardinal sin of these debates is that they
obscure the most beguiling riddle of Lawrence’s story: How did he do it?
How did a painfully shy Oxford archaeologist without a single day of
military training become the battlefield commander of a foreign
revolutionary army, the political master strategist who foretold so many
of the Middle Eastern calamities to come?</p>
<p>The short answer might seem somewhat anticlimactic: Lawrence was able
to become “Lawrence of Arabia” because no one was paying much
attention.</p>
<p>Amid the vast slaughter occurring across the breadth of Europe in
World War I, the Middle Eastern theater of that war was of markedly
secondary importance. Within that theater, the Arab Revolt to which
Lawrence became affiliated was, to use his own words, “a sideshow of a
sideshow.” In terms of lives and money and matériel expended, in terms
of the thousands of hours spent in weighty consultation between generals
and kings and prime ministers, the imperial plotters of Europe were
infinitely more concerned over the future status of Belgium, for
example, than with what might happen in the impoverished and distant
regions of the Middle East. Consequently, in the view of British war
planners, if a young army officer left largely to his own devices could
sufficiently organize the fractious Arab tribes to harass their Turkish
enemy, all to the good. Of course, it wouldn’t be very long before both
the Arab Revolt and the Middle East became vastly more important to the
rest of the world, but this was a possibility barely considered—indeed,
it could hardly have been imagined—at the time.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the whole story either. That’s because the low regard
with which British war strategists viewed events in the Middle East
found reflection in the other great warring powers. As a result, these
powers, too, relegated their military efforts in the region to whatever
could be spared from the more important battlefields elsewhere,
consigning the task of intelligence gathering and fomenting rebellion
and forging alliances to men with résumés just as modest and unlikely as
Lawrence’s.</p>
<p>As with Lawrence, these other competitors in the field tended to be
young, wholly untrained for the missions they were given, and largely
unsupervised. And just as with their more famous British counterpart, to
capitalize on their extraordinary freedom of action, these men drew upon
a very particular set of personality traits—cleverness, bravery, a
talent for treachery—to both forge their own destiny and alter the
course of history.</p>
<p>Among them was a fallen American aristocrat in his twenties who, as
the only American field intelligence officer in the Middle East during
World War I, would strongly influence his nation’s postwar policy in the
region, even as he remained on the payroll of Standard Oil of New York.
There was the young German scholar who, donning the camouflage of Arab
robes, would seek to foment an Islamic jihad against the Western
colonial powers, and who would carry his “war by revolution” ideas into
the Nazi era. Along with them was a Jewish scientist who, under the
cover of working for the Ottoman government, would establish an
elaborate anti-Ottoman spy ring and play a crucial role in creating a
Jewish homeland in Palestine.</p>
<p>If little remembered today, these men shared something else with
their British counterpart. Like Lawrence, they were not the senior
generals who charted battlefield campaigns in the Middle East, nor the
elder statesmen who drew lines on maps in the war’s aftermath. Instead,
their roles were perhaps even more profound: it was they who created the
conditions on the ground that brought those campaigns to fruition, who
made those postwar policies and boundaries possible. History is always a
collaborative effort, and in the case of World War I an effort that
involved literally millions of players, but to a surprising degree, the
subterranean and complex game these four men played, their hidden
loyalties and personal duels, helped create the modern Middle East and,
by inevitable extension, the world we live in today.</p>
<p>Yet within this small galaxy of personalities there remain at least
two compelling reasons why T. E. Lawrence and his story should reside
firmly at its center.</p>
<p>The modern Middle East was largely created by the British. It was
they who carried the Allied war effort in the region during World War I
and who, at its close, principally fashioned its peace. It was a peace
presaged by the nickname given the region by covetous Allied leaders in
wartime: “the Great Loot.” As one of Britain’s most important and
influential agents in that arena, Lawrence was intimately connected to
all, good and bad, that was to come.</p>
<p>Second, and as the episode at Buckingham Palace attests, this was an
experience that left him utterly changed, unrecognizable in certain
respects even to himself. Victory carries a moral burden the vanquished
never know, and as an architect of momentous events, Lawrence would be
uniquely haunted by what he saw and did during the Great Loot.</p>
