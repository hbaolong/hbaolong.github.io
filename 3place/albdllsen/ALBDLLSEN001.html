<h4 id="authors-note">Author’s Note</h4>
<p>In war, language itself often becomes a weapon, and that was
certainly true in the Middle Eastern theater of World War I. For
example, while the Allied powers tended to use “the Ottoman Empire” and
“Turkey” interchangeably, they displayed a marked preference for the
latter designation as the war went on, undoubtedly to help fortify the
notion that the non-Turkish populations of the Ottoman Empire were
somehow “captive peoples” in need of liberation. Similarly, while
early-war Allied documents often noted that Palestine and Lebanon were
provinces of Ottoman Syria, that distinction tended to disappear as the
British and French made plans to seize those territories in the postwar
era. On a more subtle level, all the Western powers, including the
Ottoman Empire’s/Turkey’s chief ally in the war, Germany, continued to
refer to the city of “Constantinople” (its name under a Christian empire
overthrown by the Muslim Ottomans in 1453) rather than the locally
preferred “Istanbul.”</p>
<p>As many Middle East historians rightly point out, the use of these
Western-preferred labels—Turkey rather than the Ottoman Empire,
Constantinople instead of Istanbul—is indicative of a Eurocentric
perspective that, in its most pernicious form, serves to validate the
European (read imperialist) view of history.</p>
<p>This poses a dilemma for historians focusing on the Western role in
that war theater—as I do in this book—since the bulk of their research
will naturally be drawn from Western sources. In such a situation, it
would seem a writer must choose between clarity and political
sensitivity; since I feel many readers would find it confusing if, for
example, I consistently referred to “Istanbul” when virtually all cited
material refers to “Constantinople,” I have opted for clarity.</p>
<p>I was aided in this decision, however, by the fact that these
language distinctions were not nearly so clear-cut at the time as some
contemporary Middle East historians contend. Even the wartime leadership
of the Ottoman Empire/Turkey frequently referred to the city of
“Constantinople,” and also tended to use “Ottoman” and “Turkey”
synonymously (see the epigraph from Djemal Pasha in Chapter One). To
dwell on all this too long is only to invite more complications. As
Ottoman historian Mustafa Aksakal readily concedes in The Ottoman Road
to War (pp. x–xi), “it seems anachronistic to speak of an ‘Ottoman
government’ and an ‘Ottoman cabinet’ in 1914 when the major players had
explicitly repudiated ‘Ottomanism’ and were set on constructing a
government by and for the Turks . . .”</p>
<p>In sum, like the principals in this book, I’ve used “Ottoman Empire”
and “Turkey” somewhat interchangeably, guided mostly by what sounds
right in a particular context, while for simplicity, I refer exclusively
to “Constantinople.”</p>
<p>On a different language-related matter, Arabic names can be
transliterated in a wide variety of ways. For purposes of consistency, I
have adopted the spellings that appear most often in quoted material,
and have standardized those spellings within quoted material. In most
cases, this adheres to Egyptian Arabic pronunciation. For example, a man
named Mohammed al-Faroki, whose surname appeared in different documents
of the time also as Faruqi, Farogi, Farookee, Faroukhi, etc., will
appear as Faroki throughout. The most notable case in point is that of
T. E. Lawrence’s chief Arab ally, Faisal ibn Hussein, usually referred
to as Feisal by Lawrence, but as Faisal by most others, including
historians. To avoid confusion, I’ve changed all spellings to the
latter.</p>
<p>Also, the use of English punctuation has changed quite dramatically
over the past century, and Lawrence in particular had an extremely
idiosyncratic—some might say antagonistic—approach to it in his writing.
In quotations where I believed the original punctuation might obscure
meaning for modern readers, I have adopted the modern norm. These
changes apply only to punctuation; no words have been added or deleted
from quotations except where indicated by brackets or ellipses.</p>
<p>Finally, two versions of Seven Pillars of Wisdom were published in T.
E. Lawrence’s lifetime. The first, a handprinted edition of only eight
copies, was produced in 1922 and is commonly referred to as the “Oxford
Text,” while a revised edition of approximately two hundred copies was
produced in 1926; it is this latter version that is most commonly read
today. Since Lawrence made clear that he regarded the Oxford Text as a
rough draft, I have quoted almost exclusively from the 1926 version. In
those few instances where I’ve quoted from the Oxford Text, the endnote
citation is marked “(Oxford).”</p>
