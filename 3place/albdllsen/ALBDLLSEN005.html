<h4 id="chapter-3-another-and-another-nice-thing">Chapter 3 Another and
Another Nice Thing</h4>
<p>Always my soul hungered for less than it had.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM</p>
<p>How do you put a collar on a leopard? Very carefully, according to
the old joke, but in the autumn of 1913, T. E. Lawrence and Leonard
Woolley were in need of a practical answer to that question. They had
recently been given a young leopard as a gift by a government official
in Aleppo, and had found that so long as he remained chained in the
courtyard of the Jerablus compound, he made for a very effective
watchdog. The problem, though, was that leopards grow very quickly, and
it was now just a matter of time before he tore through the flimsy
collar he had been delivered in.</p>
<p>The archaeologists’ first idea was to throw a large slatted box over
the cat, then reach through the slats to effect the collar exchange, but
since the leopard was “not very sweet tempered” to begin with, according
to Lawrence, this confinement only put him in a fouler mood. Their
solution was a rather clever one. Slightly enlarging an opening in the
box, they kept stuffing in burlap sacks until eventually the leopard was
wedged so tightly that he couldn’t move.</p>
<p>“Then we took the top off the box, collared him, and let him loose
again,” Lawrence wrote to his family. “He will make a most splendid
carpet some day.”</p>
<p>Along with learning how to recollar a leopard, it was in that autumn
1913 digging season at Carchemish, Lawrence’s fifth, that he and Woolley
would make a spectacular find—the site’s main temple. It was an
archaeologist’s dream, the discovery of a lifetime, and it helped fuel
in Lawrence a sense that he had found his true calling, and perhaps his
true home. The spacious main living room of the Jerablus compound was
now a cozy space adorned with artwork on the walls and carpets and
animal hides on the floor, a library with books in seven languages, and
an enormous fireplace constantly stoked with hot-burning olivewood. He
revealed his feelings in a letter to a close friend from his Oxford days
that autumn.</p>
<p>“I have got to like this place very much,” he wrote, “and the people
here—five or six of them—and the whole manner of living pleases me.…
Carchemish will not be finished for another four or five years and I’m
afraid that, after that, I’ll probably go after another and another nice
thing.”</p>
<p>But heartbreakingly, funding from the British Museum—always extremely
tight and always conditionally doled out from one season or year to the
next—had been effectively exhausted. Unless an unforeseen new funding
source suddenly appeared, the next digging season, spring 1914, was
slated to be the last. This knowledge hung over Lawrence and Woolley,
and it overshadowed their excitement over that season’s discoveries with
a deepening sense of despair. It was only when they began closing down
the site in preparation for their off-season break that a new
possibility presented itself.</p>
<p>Under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund, a British
Museum director explained, a group of Royal Engineers was about to
embark on an archaeological survey of the so-called Wilderness of Zin of
southernmost Palestine; might Lawrence and Woolley be interested in
joining them during their upcoming break?</p>
<p>For Lawrence and Woolley, it presented a choice between spending two
months of leisure in England, or trekking through one of the world’s
most inhospitable corners. But the lure of exploration really made this
no choice at all; both men immediately signed on.</p>
<p>LATE ONE NIGHT in early October 1913, William Yale lay in his tent in
the mountains of Anatolia, struck by a sense of wonder at how quickly a
life could change. Just three weeks earlier he had been living in a
two-room shanty and pulling rods in an Oklahoma oilfield, and now he was
traveling through one of the most ruggedly beautiful landscapes on
earth, a land only a handful of Americans had ever seen.</p>
<p>Adding to his sense of awe was that in all the time he’d spent in
Oklahoma daydreaming about where Standard Oil might send him, he had
scarcely considered the Near East. Instead, on that day he walked into
the Socony headquarters in New York, he had assumed he was being
dispatched as a sales representative to China.</p>
<p>Yale’s misconception was understandable. In 1913, Socony was
primarily an exporter of petroleum products, and China was by far its
largest market. In comparison, the company’s exports to the Ottoman
Empire, primarily kerosene to fuel its embryonic industrial facilities,
were minuscule. To put into perspective how minuscule, while Standard’s
kerosene represented the second biggest American export to the Ottoman
Empire, the largest was Singer sewing machines.</p>
<p>But as the Standard vice president, William Bemis, had explained to
the three men brought to his office that morning, they weren’t being
sent to the Near East to rustle up new purchasing clients, but rather to
find and develop new sources of oil.</p>
<p>It was simple economics. By the end of 1913, the exponentially
growing demand for oil and petroleum products around the globe meant
that demand would soon outstrip supply. In the United States alone, the
number of combustion-engine vehicles on the road had increased
twentyfold in less than a decade, from some seventy-five thousand in
1905 to well over 1.5 million in 1913—and already a number of the oldest
American oilfields were starting to run dry.</p>
<p>Oil was rapidly becoming a crucial military asset as well. In 1912,
just a year before Yale’s summoning to New York, the first lord of the
admiralty of Great Britain, Winston Churchill, had made international
headlines with his plan to convert the entire Royal Navy from coal to
oil. As might be expected, this proposed modernization of the world’s
most powerful fleet was already causing the navies of other nations,
including Germany, to scramble to follow suit.</p>
<p>As a consequence, both American and European oil companies were now
rushing to find and exploit new fields wherever they might exist. One
especially promising region was the Near East. In the 1870s, huge oil
and gas deposits had been discovered around Baku on the Caspian Sea, and
this had been followed by another large strike in the Persian Gulf in
1908. Those fields were quickly dominated by European consortiums, and
the race was on to tap and lay claim to the next big find.</p>
<p>To that end, the Socony branch office in Constantinople had quietly
obtained a six-month option from a consortium of three Jerusalem-based
businessmen who held vast exploration concessionary rights in three
different regions of the Ottoman Empire. It was to perform preliminary
fieldwork in these concessionary zones that Yale, McGovern, and Hill had
been dispatched from New York. As for the elaborate secrecy surrounding
their mission, there were two reasons: to throw any potential
competitors off the scent, naturally, but also to keep the Standard name
in the background for as long as possible. Its recent breakup
notwithstanding, the Standard brand was still regarded with such abiding
distrust in the Near East, as in many other parts of the world, that the
easiest way to besmirch the reputation of a business rival was to accuse
it of being a Standard Oil front.</p>
<p>But despite its stealth approach, there were indications that
Standard Oil of New York was not quite the smoothly run, rapacious
machine its progenitor had been. Indeed, one such indication was the
composition of the team it had sent to explore the Ottoman concessions.
J. C. Hill, the chief, was a Pittsburgh steel man with no experience in
the oil industry. Rudolf McGovern was a college-trained geologist, but
had never actually set foot in an oilfield. And while William Yale
certainly knew his way around an oilfield, he had absolutely no
knowledge of geology.</p>
<p>Certainly J. C. Hill had an unusual approach to exploration, one that
might best be described as fatalistic. Arriving in Constantinople in
early October, the team had set out for the first concessionary zone, a
broad stretch of mountainous terrain in central Anatolia, just south of
the Black Sea. Accompanied by a small team of local guides, the three
Americans spent a couple of weeks roaming the high plateau on horseback,
but each time McGovern pointed to a distant spot he deemed worthy of
closer inspection, Hill thought better of it. A critical moment came
when the group learned there was a boat heading back to Constantinople
in thirty hours’ time, and that there wouldn’t be another for at least
two weeks; they made the boat with just minutes to spare.</p>
<p>Their pace slowed considerably once they reached the second
exploration zone, the Dead Sea valley in Palestine, in November 1913.
Essentially a continuation of the Great Rift Valley of East Africa, from
a geological standpoint the region held a good deal more promise than
Anatolia. For several weeks, the team traveled the western shore of the
Dead Sea, picking their way through shale screes and the surrounding
limestone cliffs. Time and again, they found tantalizing clues to the
presence of oil—lumps of pure asphalt floating in the sea, surface
limestone so impregnated with petroleum that it gave off the odor of
gasoline—but nothing to confirm that a commercially viable reservoir
might lie beneath.</p>
<p>Then again, it was hard to say much with any definitiveness since
Hill, employing the exploratory style he had honed in Anatolia, soon
began to veto nearly every spot that McGovern recommended for closer
investigation. At times it seemed to Yale that they weren’t so much
looking for oil as trying to hide from it.</p>
<p>Matters finally came to a head in early January when Hill announced
that their work there was done and ordered the breaking of camp for the
return journey to Jerusalem. Yale, fueled by three months of
frustration, could hold his tongue no longer. He confronted Hill, and
the two ended up in a heated argument.</p>
<p>Whether that argument had some effect or it was mere coincidence, on
the very next day, as the group climbed into the Judean foothills for
the return to Jerusalem, Hill suddenly drew up his horse to gaze at a
mountainous outcrop some thirty miles to the south. It was a strange
geological formation, an irregular massif rising from the surrounding
desert plain. Examined through binoculars, there appeared to be pools of
something collected at the mountain base, something shimmering and
iridescent.</p>
<p>“There.” J. C. Hill pointed off to the mountains of Kornub. “That is
where we will find oil.”</p>
<p>Events moved very quickly after that. Hurrying his bedraggled caravan
back to Jerusalem, Hill immediately cabled Socony headquarters with news
of his “find.” By return telegram, he was ordered to gather up the two
primary concession holders of the Palestine tracts, Jerusalem
businessmen Ismail Hakki Bey and Suleiman Nassif, and personally deliver
them to the Socony office in Cairo as soon as possible. In Hill’s
absence, Yale and Rudolf McGovern were to go on to Kornub and conduct
tests to determine just how immense this new strike might be.</p>
<p>Hastily hiring guides and camp orderlies for the expedition, Yale and
McGovern decamped from Jerusalem around January 6, only to meet T. E.
Lawrence and his companions outside Beersheva a few days later.
Following that humiliating encounter, the Socony party continued south
until they at last reached the desolate peaks of Kornub. What they were
to discover there would have momentous consequences.</p>
<p>ON MARCH 15, 1913, Aaron Aaronsohn was invited to a luncheon at an
exclusive club in Washington, D.C. The guest of honor was former
president Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Maybe it was out of respect that Aaronsohn’s hosts, two prominent
American Jewish leaders named Julian Mack and Felix Frankfurter, sat
their guest beside the former president, or maybe it was born of a sense
of mischief; both Aaronsohn and Roosevelt, still referred to as “the
Colonel” by his intimates, had hard-earned reputations for being nonstop
talkers, and their table companions may have thought it amusing to see
who would win out. To the amazement of Mack and Frankfurter, it was
President Roosevelt who barely got a word in; instead he listened to
Aaronsohn with rapt attention. Aaronsohn clearly appreciated the
uniqueness of his achievement; he wrote in his diary that night that
“from now on, my reputation will be the man who made the Colonel shut up
for 101 minutes.”</p>
<p>Much like the former president, Aaron Aaronsohn came on like a force
of nature. A towering man given to portliness, he was both brilliant and
arrogant, passionate and combative, one of those people who seem to
believe they are always the most interesting person in a room. In the
case of the thirty-seven-year-old Aaronsohn, he was usually right.</p>
<p>By March 1913, he had also emerged as one of the most persuasive
spokesmen for a cause that had recently gained currency in certain
Jewish circles: Zionism. Calling for a return of the Jewish diaspora to
their ancestral homeland of Eretz (Greater) Israel, the Zionist movement
had gained some adherents among international Jewry over the previous
two decades, but more frequently had been met with skepticism, even
hostility. What made Aaronsohn so influential was that his Zionist
arguments were not based on political or religious abstractions, but on
the purely practical, almost the mundane: agriculture. Already
recognized as one of the most accomplished agronomists in the Middle
East, Aaronsohn had spent thirty-one of his thirty-seven years in
Palestine, and he was now conducting a wide range of scientific
experiments—on plants and trees and soils—that might restore the region
to the verdant land it had been in ancient times. All high-minded
Zionist principles aside, he frequently pointed out, the first
prerequisite for the Jews’ return to Israel was to have something to
eat; Aaronsohn knew how to feed them.</p>
<p>He hadn’t come to any of this easily. The eldest child of a Jewish
grain merchant, Aaronsohn was born in 1876 in a small town in central
Romania. He was just two when the Russo-Turkish War led to Romania’s
independence from the Ottoman Empire. For the nation’s large Jewish
population, what had been a tolerably bad existence under a Muslim
autocracy quickly became an intolerably bad one under a Christian
democracy. Effectively barred from obtaining citizenship, which also
meant being barred from most schools and professions, the Jews began a
mass exodus out of Romania. In 1882, when Aaron was six, his parents
joined the flight. Rather than make for the émigrés’ preferred
destination of the United States, however, the Aaronsohns joined some
250 other Romanian Jews in sailing for the Palestine region of Ottoman
Syria.</p>
<p>The group settled on a barren tract of rocky hillside near the port
city of Haifa, an outpost they named Samarin. There they quickly
discovered that the “land flowing with milk and honey” described in the
Book of Exodus had changed a very great deal in the interim. The few
Samarin settlers who knew how to farm—most had been small merchants back
in Romania—were soon defeated by the arid landscape and poor soil.
Within the year, the émigrés were so destitute they were forced to pawn
their sacred Torah scrolls.</p>
<p>Salvation came in the form of the enormously wealthy French Jewish
financier Baron Edmond de Rothschild. An early supporter and benefactor
of Jewish immigration to Palestine, Rothschild had already established
or bailed out a number of Jewish colonies in the region, and in 1884 he
did the same with Samarin, renaming it Zichron Yaakov (Jacob’s
Memorial), in honor of his deceased father. As the community soon
discovered, though, Rothschild’s patronage came at a very steep price.
In agreeing to lend financial support, his first condition had been
“that he alone shall be the colony’s sole lord and that all things in
its domain be under his rule”—and he hadn’t been kidding. The residents
of Zichron Yaakov were told what crops they could grow, how they should
dress, even who had earned the right to marry, and Rothschild’s resident
agents made sure the rules were enforced.</p>
<p>But for the young and extraordinarily bright Aaron Aaronsohn, this
feudalistic system had its benefits. In 1893, at the age of sixteen, he
was chosen by Rothschild’s agents to be educated in France, all expenses
paid, and for the next two years he studied agronomy and botany at the
Grignon Institute outside Paris, one of the most prestigious
agricultural academies in Europe. When he returned to Palestine, it was
not to take up the life of a Rothschild serf in Zichron Yaakov but to
serve as an agricultural “instructor” at another of the baron’s
settlements. The arrangement didn’t last long. Within a year, Aaronsohn,
just nineteen but already headstrong and impatient, broke with the baron
and his agents and struck out on his own.</p>
<p>Finding work as an agricultural advisor to large absentee landowners,
he also began meticulously studying and cataloging the flora and geology
of Palestine. In this endeavor, his intense curiosity and indefatigable
energy soon became legendary. By his midtwenties, already fluent in a
half dozen languages, Aaronsohn began publishing articles in European
agronomy journals. No one in the tightly knit and highly credentialed
fraternity of European agronomists had ever heard of their colleague in
Palestine, and the frequency and eclectic range of Aaronsohn’s
work—learned studies on everything from sesame oil extraction to silk
production—led some to wonder whether the name was a pseudonym for a
collective of scientists.</p>
<p>His true breakthrough came in 1906 with his discovery of wild emmer
wheat, a progenitor of cultivated wheat long thought extinct, growing on
the slopes of Mount Hermon. At a time when the world’s population was
still over 80 percent agrarian, the find made international headlines
and won the young, virtually self-taught Jewish scientist the
recognition of his peers around the globe. Three years later, he
accepted an invitation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to
conduct a wide-ranging tour of the American West. There he was treated
as something of a celebrity, offered college professorships, his highly
anticipated lectures attended by overflowing audiences. But Aaronsohn’s
time in the United States—his stay extended to nearly eight months—also
exposed him to the currents of modern Jewish political thought, and
especially to some of the foremost leaders of the American Zionist
movement.</p>
<p>While the notion of a return to Israel had been a cornerstone of
Jewish faith for millennia—for nearly two thousand years, Jewish Yom
Kippur and Passover services have ended with the recitation, “next year
in Jerusalem”—it was a Hungarian writer, Theodor Herzl, who transformed
it into a modern political idea. In the face of institutionalized
anti-Semitism in even the most “enlightened” nations of Europe, and the
periodic massacre of Jews in places like czarist Russia, Herzl had
argued in his 1896 book The Jewish State that international Jewry could
only ever be truly safe and free by establishing their own homeland in
the ancient land of Israel. The following year, Herzl presided over the
first meeting of the World Zionist Congress in Switzerland, an event
that electrified Jewish audiences around the world.</p>
<p>It also provoked a furious backlash. In both Europe and the United
States, many Jewish leaders—perhaps most—saw Zionism as a dangerous
instrument that would isolate Jews from the nations of their birth, and
provide fuel to the long-repeated accusation of Jews harboring a divided
loyalty; some even suspected Zionism to be an anti-Semitic plot. For the
anti-Zionists, the answer to the “Jewish Question” was not Israel but
assimilation, full political and economic participation in the nations
of their births, a goal finally coming within reach in much of Europe
through the spread of democracy.</p>
<p>The “assimilationists” also appeared to have a powerful practical
argument in their favor. Already by the early 1900s, some sixty thousand
Jews lived in the Holy Land, and the great majority of them were either
desperately poor or subsisting on subscriptions raised by their
religious brethren abroad. Considering this, how could the wastelands of
Palestine possibly sustain any significant percentage of the some ten
million Jews then scattered about the globe?</p>
<p>It was in retort to this question that Aaron Aaronsohn—not just an
agronomist, but an amateur archaeologist and an avid reader of
history—could pose a compelling one of his own. What had sustained the
Romans and the Babylonians and the Assyrians? From both archaeological
excavations and old histories, it was clear that Palestine had once
supported populations much greater than the estimated 700,000
inhabitants of the early 1900s, and it wasn’t as if the water sources or
soil beds that sustained those civilizations had simply vanished.
Rather, they had been lost to time, and were waiting to be rediscovered,
retapped. Aaronsohn also had a persuasive modern example to point to.
During his travels in the American West, he had made a special study of
California, a place with very similar climate and soil conditions to
Palestine. With water diverted from the Sierra Nevada, California’s
Central Valley was already becoming the agricultural breadbasket of
America and bringing in a flood of new settlers. The very same,
Aaronsohn argued, could be achieved in Palestine, and with his unrivaled
knowledge of the region, he was the man to do it.</p>
<p>In the face of such optimism, not to say arrogance, an expanding
circle of wealthy American Jews warmed to Aaronsohn’s vision of a
restored Israel. Before he left the United States in the autumn of 1909,
a consortium of these businessmen and philanthropists had raised some
0,000 toward the creation of the Jewish Agricultural Experiment Station
in Palestine, a modern research center that Aaronsohn would oversee and
that he vowed would become the preeminent such scientific facility in
all the Middle East.</p>
<p>For his new venture, Aaronsohn set up operations on a bluff
overlooking the Mediterranean some eight miles north of Zichron Yaakov,
a place named Athlit. Over the next several years, he laid in fields of
experimental seedbeds and orchards, built a complex of greenhouses and
laboratories. He also saw to the construction of a large two-story
building, housing for the facility’s library and permanent workers, with
a commanding view of the sea just one mile away. With a lack of
sufficiently educated locals, Aaronsohn drew most of those permanent
workers from among his own family—at various times all five of his
siblings would be employed at Athlit—and it was they who oversaw its
day-to-day operations, including supervising the field workers drawn
from nearby Arab villages. “Before long,” biographer Ronald Florence
noted, “the experimental plots at the research center were producing
more wheat, barley and oats per dunam [about one thousand square meters]
than long-established farms on much better soils.”</p>
<p>In light of his growing role as a recruiter for Zionism, it’s
somewhat curious that Aaronsohn appeared to have spent very little time
thinking through its social or political ramifications. He could put
more Jews on the ground in Palestine, of that he was certain, but what
it meant or what form their governance might take was all rather
vague.</p>
<p>But this same vagueness extended to the Zionist movement itself.
Among “social” and religious Zionists, the goal was quite modest:
increased Jewish immigration to Palestine for those who wished to go,
with no upsetting of the existing local political framework. Indeed,
many of the businessmen who had donated to Aaronsohn’s research station
considered themselves anti-Zionists, somehow imagining their involvement
as apolitical, akin to helping rebuild a synagogue.</p>
<p>Even among those who embraced the idea of a “Jewish state,” there was
very little agreement on its definition. In 1901, Theodor Herzl had met
with the Ottoman sultan in hopes of actually purchasing Palestine. When
that overture went nowhere, most successive Zionist leaders had
advocated an incremental approach, of Jewish financiers gradually buying
up land in Palestine for settlement, while simultaneously negotiating
with Constantinople—negotiations that might take the form of bribes or
the paying off of a portion of the Ottomans’ crushing foreign debt—to
ensure Ottoman acceptance and protection of the new settlers. Whether
such a scheme could ever lead to the kind of demographic shift allowing
for Jewish majority rule was highly doubtful, however, given that
Palestine’s existing non-Jewish population outnumbered Jews by ten to
one. By the time of Aaronsohn’s luncheon with Teddy Roosevelt in 1913,
however, a new, more promising prospect had presented itself. With the
Ottoman Empire being torn at from all sides, its final collapse suddenly
appeared imminent. If that fall did come and a European power took
control of Palestine, the Zionists might be able to establish themselves
under their protection. Both the most likely and most desirable such
patron, in Aaronsohn’s estimation, was Great Britain.</p>
<p>STEWART NEWCOMBE WAS a legendary figure in the Near East, although
not in a uniformly positive way. At the age of thirty-five, the Boer War
veteran had already surveyed and mapped vast tracts of Egypt and the
Sudan for the British government, and had gained the reputation of being
an indefatigable explorer, capable of the work of ten ordinary men. That
was part of the problem. Due to his habit of driving others as hard as
he drove himself, the Arabs who worked with him in the coming war would
say of Captain Stewart Newcombe that “he was like fire, burning both his
friends and enemies.”</p>
<p>Not surprisingly then, Newcombe had been in a rather black mood as he
left his camp in the Zin Desert on the morning of January 8 and made for
Beersheva, a day’s camel ride away. He was going there to meet up with
the two eminent archaeologists, lately working on a dig in northern
Syria, who had been assigned to his mission in southern Palestine.
Although he fully appreciated the need for the archaeologists—they were
the political cover that would allow his five military mapping teams to
do their clandestine work—this operation was designed to be a
fast-moving one over an unspeakably harsh landscape, and tending to the
needs of two Oxford scholars was the last thing Newcombe needed. He had
earlier sent ten camels to meet their boat in Gaza to transport their
gear—archaeologists always had lots of gear—and he was coming out of the
desert with more to handle the inevitable overflow.</p>
<p>A very pleasant surprise awaited him in Beersheva. “I expected to
meet two somewhat elderly people; [instead] I found C. L. Woolley and T.
E. Lawrence, who looked about twenty-four years of age and eighteen
respectively.… My letters to them arranging for their reception had
clearly been too polite. Undue deference ceased forthwith.”</p>
<p>Far from needing a small camel caravan to haul their equipment, when
Lawrence and Woolley had come off the boat in Gaza, accompanied by
Lawrence’s young assistant Dahoum, all their possessions had fit neatly
onto the back of one small donkey. That had now been expanded somewhat
by the purchase of camping and photographic supplies, but clearly the
two young archaeologists appreciated the need for traveling light on the
brutal terrain they were about to enter.</p>
<p>That evening, Newcombe spelled out to the men from Syria both what
they were expected to do and the sub rosa purpose of the expedition. On
this latter aspect, Lawrence had already pretty well figured things out.
“We are obviously only meant as red herrings,” he had written his
parents en route to Palestine, “to give an archaeological colour to a
political job.”</p>
<p>That political job arose from a problem that Great Britain had
largely brought upon itself. As the European power most dependent on
control of the seas, Britain had been the driving force behind the
construction of the Suez Canal in Egypt in the 1870s, seeing the linking
of the Mediterranean to the Red Sea as a vital military and commercial
shortcut in keeping its far-flung empire knitted together. So vital did
it deem the canal that Britain had been willing to sacrifice its
long-standing good relations with the Ottoman Empire in order to take
possession of it outright, a feat accomplished by its 1882 invasion of
Egypt under the pretext of quelling local unrest. That had delivered up
the west bank of the Suez Canal, Egypt’s de facto frontier, but it left
the now hostile Ottomans still hovering on its east bank in the Sinai
Peninsula. This problem was soon resolved; in 1906, Britain had
capitalized on a minor diplomatic dispute to grab that territory also.
The end result was something of a trade-off. The British now had their
canal, along with the 120-mile-wide buffer zone of the Sinai Peninsula
separating Egypt from the heavily settled Palestine region of southwest
Syria. On the flip side, they had won the undying resentment of the
Ottomans.</p>
<p>That was a small price to pay in 1882 and 1906, perhaps, but a rather
different story by the beginning of 1914. With Europe stumbling ever
closer toward a continent-wide war, the British were suddenly quite
concerned by the sorry state of British-Ottoman relations, and by
ominous signs that Constantinople was sliding into the orbit of
Britain’s avowed enemy, Germany. If the war everyone expected did come,
the Suez Canal would be the crucial passageway for bringing British
territorial troops from India and Australia to Europe; of course, if
Turkey joined with Germany in that war, they would undoubtedly target
the canal for this same reason. Britain’s problems wouldn’t end there.
In the event that the enemy succeeded in crossing the canal and getting
into Egypt itself, it was very likely to spark an anti-British
insurrection by a population that thoroughly despised them, tying up
British soldiers who would be needed for the fight in Europe.</p>
<p>In contemplating this scenario the British belatedly came to
appreciate the downside to their Sinai buffer zone, one inherent to the
very concept of buffer zones: how to know what lies on the other side?
The British had a very good idea of what lay at the Sinai’s northeastern
tip—the populous and long-cultivated region of the Palestine coast—but
they knew virtually nothing of the desert frontier that ran southeast
from that coast to the Gulf of Aqaba, one hundred miles away. Were there
roads there, water wells that might sustain an invasion force?</p>
<p>The person most preoccupied with finding out was Egypt’s de facto
ruler, the British agent and consul general, Horatio Herbert Kitchener.
By 1914, Lord Kitchener was Britain’s preeminent living war hero—he had
crushed a native revolt in the Sudan during the Mahdi War in 1898, then
led British forces to victory in the Boer War in 1902—but by one of
those peculiar happenstances of history, as a young man Kitchener had
been a geographical surveyor, and his crowning achievement was the
mapping of Palestine. The one corner of Palestine that Kitchener and his
cosurveyors had skipped over was the desolate wastelands of
Zin—essentially the triangle-shaped lower half of modern-day Israel—the
survey sponsors figuring there was simply no political or economic
reason to include it. But it was precisely this unmapped triangle that
now lay on the other side of the Sinai buffer zone.</p>
<p>Considering the enmity that had developed between the two empires,
Kitchener had shown remarkable chutzpah in 1913 when “offering” the
Ottomans the services of the British Royal Engineers to conduct a survey
of Zin; unsurprisingly, Constantinople quickly turned the offer down. By
happy coincidence, however, Zin also figured prominently in the biblical
Book of Exodus, the region that Moses and the Israelites passed through
at the end of their forty-year flight out of Egypt. This provided a
handy theological and historical explanation for why a Christian nation
might want to explore the region, and when the British tried this tack
on Constantinople—repackaging their earlier offer so that it was now to
be an archaeological survey of biblical sites under the auspices of the
respected Palestine Exploration Fund—the ploy actually worked. It was
this ruse that had brought Lawrence and Woolley to Beersheva, and that
gave Newcombe the necessary cover for his military mapping teams.</p>
<p>Very quickly, whatever initial reservations Newcombe may have
harbored at being saddled with the two archaeologists were erased. In
Lawrence especially, he seemed to find a kindred spirit, a man so
indifferent to creature comforts and possessed of such astounding
endurance that it bordered on the masochistic.</p>
<p>He also detected a curious quirk in Lawrence’s personality, a
tendency to rise out of his core shyness in response to those who would
obfuscate or stand in his way. An early example of this was his verbal
torturing of the poor American oilmen in Beersheva. Most shy people tend
to become more so when faced with a potentially confrontational
situation, but with Lawrence and the Americans it had been precisely the
opposite, the young archaeologist turning the encounter into a game of
cat-and-mouse, with himself playing the cat. It indicated a streak of
gamesmanship in Lawrence, a quality that would stand him in good stead
as he faced off with the petty Ottoman officials who, Newcombe was sure,
would try to obstruct their every move.</p>
<p>But in fact, far more than the Ottomans, it was the “Wilderness” of
Zin itself that posed the greatest challenges to Lawrence and Woolley.
Operating independently of the military survey teams, although
frequently checked in on by Newcombe, they maintained a relentless pace
over the bleak terrain, driving their camels and small team of camp
orderlies to the point of ruin. At least these locals were accustomed to
the region; coming from the more temperate climes of northern Syria,
Lawrence and Woolley suffered terribly in the parched and sunbaked
land.</p>
<p>These discomforts might have been partially offset if they’d found
what they came to look for. They didn’t. Instead, other than a few ruins
dating from the Byzantine period or later, they found very few
structures at all in the region—and certainly nothing suggesting an
Exodus-era settlement.</p>
<p>But then there had always been something of a built-in fallacy to the
Zin project, one the Ottomans might have deduced if they’d pondered
matters a bit longer. In a landscape so inhospitable that even the hardy
Bedouin nomads abandoned it in summer, why would Moses and the
Israelites—forty years wandering in the desert and presumably eager to
finally get somewhere nice—have lingered in this hellhole any longer
than necessary? This was a point Lawrence touched on in a somewhat arch
letter to his parents: “The Palestine Fund, of course, wants to find
sites illustrating the Exodus, which is supposed to have passed this
way. But of course a people 40 years out of Egypt could hardly leave
much trace of themselves in their later camping grounds.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of November 12, 1913, Curt Prüfer made a most painful
decision. For a brief time it had appeared that he might finally attain
the respect and status he had always sought—as a scholar, as a sterling
example of the new Germany—but then it had all turned to ash. Actually,
it was worse than that, for in the bitter struggle waged over his
candidacy to a prestigious position in the Egyptian power structure,
Prüfer’s British enemies had not only made sure he was denied the post,
but professionally destroyed him in the process. On that morning, Prüfer
sat at his desk in the German embassy and composed a terse letter of
resignation from the foreign ministry, the institution that had been his
home for the previous seven years. A few days later, the now former
embassy official left for Jerusalem, there to await the arrival of his
artist friend Richard von Below for their extended journey up the
Nile.</p>
<p>In one of the more curious features of the European imperialist era,
the dueling European powers often employed an intricate
division-of-spoils system in their colonial realms with their imperial
rivals, a way both to secure acceptance of their claims to hegemony and
reduce those rivals’ incentive for stirring local unrest.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of scholarly prestige, few foreigner-allotted
positions in Cairo were more coveted than that of director of the
khedival library. Since the signing of a bilateral accord in 1906, that
post was reserved for a German. In late 1911, with the sitting German
director slated for retirement, the German embassy put forward the name
of Dr. Curt Prüfer as his replacement.</p>
<p>Its innocuous-sounding title notwithstanding, the post was a very
sensitive one. In Ottoman times, the khedive had been the designated
Egyptian head of state, and for the British to maintain the fiction that
they had somehow been acting as a guarantor of Ottoman rule by their
1882 invasion, they had kept the khedive on as a figurehead. Since 1892,
this had been Abbas Hilmi II. While Abbas was understandably never a big
supporter of British rule to begin with, his dissatisfaction had
dramatically deepened with Lord Kitchener’s arrival on the scene in
1911. As the new British agent to Egypt, Kitchener had quickly grown so
tired of Abbas—or as he preferred to call him, “this wicked little
khedive”—that he’d begun stripping him of even his purely ceremonial
duties. In response, Abbas had increasingly taken to using the offices
of his “library” to stay in quiet contact with a host of Egyptian
dissidents opposed to British rule.</p>
<p>Of course, what was bad for Britain was good for Germany, and by
their control of the library directorship the Germans enjoyed the
perfect cover to cultivate and maintain their own contacts with the
anti-British Egyptian community. This was precisely what the outgoing
German director had done, and in late 1911 the British had every
expectation that Dr. Curt Prüfer, now promoted from dragoman to Oriental
secretary at the German embassy, would uphold the tradition.</p>
<p>Certainly, Prüfer had done little to endear himself to the British
authorities in Cairo, having continued with the pan-Islamic
destabilizing efforts of his mentor, Max von Oppenheim. Most alarming to
the Cairo authorities, Prüfer had long maintained a close relationship
with a host of anti-British Egyptian figures, as well as with the
disgruntled khedive himself. Indeed, on several occasions, Egyptian
secret police had tracked the good doctor to clandestine meetings with
some of British Egypt’s most committed and dangerous enemies.</p>
<p>Consequently, placing such a man in the khedival library seemed a bit
like putting an arsonist in a fireworks factory; shortly after Prüfer’s
name was put forward, the British diplomatically informed the Germans
that his candidacy was “unsuitable.” The Germans pressed their case,
with the German ambassador in Cairo taking his spirited defense of
Prüfer’s nomination directly to Kitchener. At the end of October 1911
the German ambassador to Great Britain, Count Paul Metternich, took the
matter all the way up to British foreign secretary Edward Grey.</p>
<p>But the more the Germans pushed on the Prüfer issue, the more
suspicious the British became. In early 1912, Kitchener informed the
German embassy that the issue had been referred to the Egyptian
government’s Ministry of Education, where Prüfer’s candidacy had been
rejected anew. It was an utterly transparent maneuver—the so-called
Egyptian government would do exactly Britain’s bidding—but it did
finally bring an end to the matter. For Prüfer, it was a professionally
devastating turn of events. Not only had he been publicly humiliated in
losing the directorship, but with the intelligence reports of his
intrigues now well known throughout the British government, he was
effectively prevented from advancing further at the German embassy in
Cairo.</p>
<p>But that was the least of it. However much the elitist structure of
German society had been reformed in other spheres, those changes had not
permeated into the diplomatic branch of the foreign ministry; in 1912,
as in 1812, that branch was the province of the German aristocracy, its
counts and princelings and noblemen. Indeed, no better example existed
of the near impossibility of an outsider being admitted to this
exclusive club than the long and futile struggle of Prüfer’s mentor,
Count von Oppenheim.</p>
<p>Although highly educated and clearly brilliant, Oppenheim possessed
one fatal flaw in the eyes of the German diplomatic branch—he was of
Jewish ancestry—and that had been enough to defeat his many efforts over
some two decades to win a transfer from the far less prestigious
consular branch. He probably came closest in 1898, when his request was
accompanied by a raft of supporting letters from gentile German
aristocrats, friends of his from the Union Club in Berlin, except that
Oppenheim had the misfortune of submitting his petition at the same time
as another Jew. In the entire history of the German diplomatic service
there had been only one Jewish member, a Rothschild, and the notion that
there might suddenly be two more cast alarm.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely persuaded,” a senior foreign ministry official wrote
in response to the situation, “that what we have here is not a question
of one Jew, but of his numerous coreligionists who will press through
the breach which he makes.… If [even] one is let in, a cry of
lamentation will ensue if others are refused.” On such concerns, both
applications were promptly denied.</p>
<p>On paper, the chances of Curt Prüfer—a lower-middle-class commoner
with a doctorate from a middling university—passing into the foreign
ministry’s higher ranks looked nearly as bleak as Oppenheim’s, but his
Oriental secretary appointment had afforded a glimmer of hope; this was
the one consular branch position where an elevation into the diplomatic
branch occasionally occurred. Obviously, the odds of that happening
would have been vastly improved had Prüfer assumed the library
directorship. Conversely, having fought for that posting and lost, his
odds now were exactly nil.</p>
<p>Through 1912 and most of 1913, Prüfer struggled on, but he found it
impossible to escape the cloak of ignominy that had been cast over him.
With the Egyptian secret police now watching his every move, even his
adventurist activities as Oriental secretary were greatly curtailed. It
was for this—and perhaps also a simple desire to try something
completely new with his life—that he finally tendered his resignation
and went off to join Richard von Below. What he went away with was an
abiding hatred for the British, the “natural enemy” of Germany, now also
the people who had destroyed his career.</p>
<p>On a broader level, though, the controversy that surrounded Prüfer
over the library directorship neatly illustrated a particularly ominous
feature of the early 1910s. While it already strained credulity that
Lord Kitchener, the uncrowned sovereign of twelve million people in one
of Britain’s most important vassal states, had been compelled to
personally engage in that controversy, how had it ever escalated to the
point where the British foreign secretary and his closest advisors were
enjoined? Did these men really have nothing better to do with their time
than compose and debate lengthy memoranda over the job placement of a
low-level German embassy official in Cairo?</p>
<p>In the answer to that question lies one of the keys to how World War
I happened. By the early 1910s, with all the European powers perpetually
jockeying for advantage, all of them constantly manufacturing crises in
hopes of winning some small claim against their rivals, a unique kind of
“fog of war” was setting in, one composed of a thousand petty slights
and disputes and misunderstandings. It wasn’t just the British foreign
secretary whose time was taken up dealing with such things, but the
foreign ministers—and in many cases, the prime ministers and presidents
and kings—of all the powers, and often over struggles even less
significant than that which entangled Curt Prüfer. Amid this din of
complaint and trivial offense, how to know what really mattered, how to
identify the true crisis when it came along?</p>
<p>THE GULF OF Aqaba is a narrow, hundred-mile-long inlet of the Red Sea
that separates the craggy desert mountains of Arabia to one side from a
similar set of mountains on the Sinai Peninsula to the other. At the
northernmost end of the Aqaba inlet is the Jordanian town of the same
name.</p>
<p>In 1914, Aqaba was nothing more than a tiny fishing village, its
thousand or so inhabitants settled into a collection of crude huts
sprinkled about the shoreline. Yet it was Aqaba, more than any other
spot in the roughly four thousand square miles that he and his Royal
Engineers were mapping, that obsessed Captain Stewart Newcombe.</p>
<p>In trying to anticipate the path an invasion force might take from
Ottoman Palestine to reach the Suez Canal, certainly the most logical
route was across the very top of the Sinai Peninsula, close to the
Mediterranean. This was an established land crossing going back
millennia, and its water sources, if meager, had been tapped and welled
for just as long. Inland, the harsh Zin Desert seemed to afford few real
possibilities, an assessment gradually being confirmed by Newcombe’s
men. By early February 1914, they had surveyed much of the border
region’s interior, and while finding a few Bedouin trails and wells, had
uncovered nothing capable of sustaining an invasion force of any
size.</p>
<p>But in all this, Aqaba, lying at the very southern end of the
Sinai-Palestine demarcation line, represented a wild card. With its
outlet on the Red Sea, troops could be ferried into the village and then
marched west. For well over a decade, persistent rumors had the Turks
secretly building a railroad spur linking Aqaba to the Arabian interior,
complementing the mountain trail already in existence. Rumors aside, it
was known that at least two “roads” originated somewhere in the Quweira
mountains above Aqaba, trails long used by local Bedouin to launch raids
into the Sinai. Taken all together, it meant the Turks might have the
potential of launching an invasion force across the Sinai from the very
southern end of the buffer zone, even while British attention was
focused at the more obvious northern end.</p>
<p>Understandably, then, Stewart Newcombe viewed getting into Aqaba as
the most crucial aspect of his entire mission to Zin. In mid-February
1914, he turned his attention to how he might do it and who should
accompany him.</p>
<p>History is often the tale of small moments—chance encounters or
casual decisions or sheer coincidence—that seem of little consequence at
the time, but somehow fuse with other small moments to produce something
momentous, the proverbial flapping of a butterfly’s wings that triggers
a hurricane. Such was the case with Captain Newcombe’s choosing a
companion for the journey to Aqaba.</p>
<p>Theoretically, he could have pulled any one of the Royal Engineers
off his five surveying parties, but as much as their technical expertise
might come in handy, he was expecting a cold reception in the village,
and the sight of two British officers rolling in would be unlikely to
improve it. He also could have chosen Leonard Woolley, whose somewhat
fusty manner would lend credence to this being a foray of purely
scientific interest. But instead he chose Lawrence. One reason was that
he genuinely enjoyed his company, but another was Lawrence’s peculiar
skill at polite belligerence that Newcombe had observed in a variety of
forms since the early days of the expedition, a skill likely to be
called upon in Aqaba.</p>
<p>Joined by Dahoum, Newcombe and Lawrence showed up in Aqaba in
mid-February, and, just as Newcombe had expected, their welcome was a
decidedly icy one. The municipal governor, professing to have no
knowledge of their project, immediately forbade them from doing any
mapping or photographing or archaeological work in the region. But just
as Newcombe had also expected, these strictures only spurred Lawrence to
greater initiative. “I photographed what I could,” Lawrence would
recount in a letter to a friend, Edward Leeds, “I archaeologised
everywhere.”</p>
<p>Of special interest to Lawrence—and this interest may have mainly
derived from the opportunity to flagrantly disregard the governor’s
orders—were the ruins of a fortress on a small island just a few hundred
yards off the Aqaba shore. He secretly arranged for a boatman to take
him to the island, only to have the man promptly arrested by the
governor’s police. Undeterred, Lawrence crafted a crude inflatable raft
and, together with Dahoum, paddled out to the island.</p>
<p>It was an easy enough passage going out, but rather a different story
on the return. With both the current and wind against them, it took
Lawrence and Dahoum hours to make the shore, at which point the local
police, long since alerted, took them into custody. The furious governor
placed the pair under armed escort for their journey out of Aqaba.
Unfortunately for the men detailed to this mission, the unwanted
entourage simply provided Lawrence with an amusing new challenge.</p>
<p>“I learnt that their orders were not to let me out of their sight,”
he wrote his family a week later from a town fifty miles to the north,
“and I took them two days afoot over such hills and wadis as did [them
in]. I have been camped here for two days, and they are still struggling
in from all over the compass.”</p>
<p>As a bonus, during this forced march Lawrence had stumbled across the
two “great cross-roads” that the Bedouin raiding parties used for their
forays into the Sinai.</p>
<p>All of this would prove profoundly useful to Lawrence. In just a
little over three years’ time, he would use the knowledge gained from
his escapades in Aqaba to conquer that strategic village in a manner
that no one else could conceive of, a feat of arms still considered one
of the most daring military exploits of modern times.</p>
<p>UPON PARTING WAYS with J. C. Hill in Jerusalem in early January,
William Yale and Rudolf McGovern set out for the Kornub massif. Reaching
it a few days after their humiliating encounter with Lawrence in
Beersheva, they immediately had reason to recall a very basic law of
chemical properties: namely, that it is not just oil mixed with water
that gives off an iridescent sheen. In the right concentrations, a wide
variety of minerals can, including iron, and it was precisely
this—stagnant water rich in iron tailings—that Hill had observed through
his binoculars from thirty miles away.</p>
<p>Crestfallen but determined to make the most of their arduous trip,
Yale and McGovern spent several days collecting rock samples and
drilling boreholes. From this, they determined there was oil in
Kornub—McGovern was fairly certain of that—but whether it existed in
anything near commercially viable quantities seemed unlikely. The two
then returned to Jerusalem, there to relay the sobering news to Socony
headquarters.</p>
<p>Curiously, and for reasons Yale and McGovern couldn’t begin to fathom
at the time, 26 Broadway didn’t seem to share their sense of
disappointment. The two were told to lie low in Jerusalem, which they
did until mid-March, and were then dispatched for more fruitless
exploration of the last of the three prospective concessionary zones, in
the hill region of Thrace just to the west of Constantinople. Tucked
away in the backwaters of the Ottoman Empire, Yale remained unaware that
news of the Kornub “strike” had triggered a complex diplomatic
tug-of-war, one that was playing out across four continents and
involving ambassadors, ministers of state, and some half dozen
international corporations.</p>
<p>When the British had pinpointed the location of Socony’s interests in
Palestine, courtesy of Lawrence’s interrogation of Yale outside
Beersheva, alarm had spread throughout the government. With access to
oil now considered a matter of national security in light of the Royal
Navy’s ongoing oil-conversion program, taking control of any new fields
was not merely an economic concern but a political one. There followed a
complicated series of maneuvers in which the British authorities tried
to sabotage the Kornub deal and arrange for a British oil company to
obtain the concessions. In this cause they relied on information from
one of the Palestinian concession holders, Suleiman Nassif, who deftly
played each side against the other to his own benefit. It was at this
juncture that McGovern’s disheartening report on Kornub finally reached
New York, but by then it was too late. Caught up in the spirit of
competition, Socony not only disregarded McGovern’s findings but
ultimately paid a far higher price for the Kornub concessions than
intended.</p>
<p>None of this was known to Yale and McGovern until they returned to
Constantinople from Thrace in late April. There they were met by their
old boss, J. C. Hill, who informed them that, having just secured the
Kornub concessions for a period of twenty-five years, Socony was now
gearing up for a massive exploration project in the region, one that
would entail building roads, erecting worker camps in the desert,
bringing in trucks and drilling equipment and heavy machinery.
Furthermore, Socony was sending the three of them to Egypt, there to
oversee the purchasing and to coordinate the delivery of all the
matériel needed. That this was an area of expertise in which they had no
knowledge was deemed unimportant; by the late spring of 2014, Yale,
McGovern, and Hill were in Egypt contemplating a daunting stack of
purchasing manuals in Socony’s Alexandria office.</p>
<p>But in this new task, the three men could draw on a powerful guiding
principle: they were Standard men, and above all else, William Yale was
increasingly coming to realize, that meant taking charge, making
decisions. Within a few days of sifting through those purchasing
manuals, and without ever seeking the counsel of someone who might know
what they were doing, they had ordered up some 50,000 worth of drilling
equipment (about 0 million in today’s equivalent) for the inauguration
of Socony’s new operation in the Kornub. That equipment, purchased from
a variety of vendors throughout the United States, would take several
months to arrive in Palestine—actual drilling was scheduled to begin on
November 1—but in the meantime, an enormous amount of work was to be
done.</p>
<p>The first step was to cut a road from Hebron down through the Judean
foothills, and then across some twenty miles of virtually trackless
desert to Kornub. This aspect of the project would prove immensely
important in the near future. Yale was put in charge of this, and he
contracted the best road builder in Palestine to do it. Even so, there
were glitches. A near riot developed in Hebron when the road surveyors
took to marking the walls of houses in their path with crosses in white
paint, a symbol the devoutly Muslim residents interpreted as marking
them for conversion to Christianity. On another occasion, Bedouin
riflemen attacked one of the construction crews out in the foothills;
the assault was finally repelled by Socony’s own private militia.</p>
<p>But as Yale was well aware, the biggest hurdles awaited at either end
of that road. All the drilling equipment being brought over from the
United States would need to come in at the Mediterranean port of
Jaffa—except there were no cranes in Jaffa capable of unloading such
heavy machinery. Then there was the niggling little detail to be worked
out at the other end of the line. One thing that makes a desert a desert
is, of course, a lack of water, and while McGovern had managed to locate
a few small wells in the Kornub area, the supply seemed barely
sufficient for the twenty-man work crew that would be living there, let
alone provide the huge amounts needed for the highly water-dependent
drilling process. As with so many other parts of the project, however,
this issue failed to set off alarm bells within Socony, and if a problem
isn’t acknowledged, does it really need a solution?</p>
<p>As work got under way, Yale was held by an ever-deepening sense of
foreboding. “Secretly,” he wrote, “I dreaded the mess, which seemed an
inevitable outcome of the systemless way the Chief [J. C. Hill] handled
matters.”</p>
<p>UPON HIS RETURN to Syria from his Zin adventure in early March,
Lawrence found a letter waiting for him from David Hogarth. It contained
wonderful news. Impressed by word of the previous season’s discoveries,
the British philanthropist who was the primary sponsor of the Carchemish
project had finally set aside enough funds to keep the excavations going
for an extended period—two more years at least, and possibly for as long
as it took for the site to be thoroughly explored. With this cheerful
news, Lawrence planned to quickly finish the Wilderness of Zin report
for the Palestine Exploration Fund during his upcoming break in England,
and then hurry back to Carchemish for an early beginning to the next
digging season.</p>
<p>For his return to England, Lawrence planned to first detour to
Baghdad and then pass down the Tigris River to the Indian Ocean,
figuring the much longer sea voyage this would entail would give him
more time to work on the Zin report. Instead, just as that season’s dig
was closing down in early June, a letter from Stewart Newcombe changed
his plan.</p>
<p>Newcombe, his work in southern Palestine finished, had visited
Carchemish in May en route to England. But of course Carchemish was not
really en route to anywhere, and Newcombe’s true motive for the detour
had been to continue overland to Constantinople in order to spy on the
progress being made by the Turks and Germans on the Baghdad Railway—and
in particular on their tunneling projects in the Taurus and Amanus
Mountains. He had succeeded in making the journey, but had been so
closely watched as to be unable to study the tunneling work in any
detail. In his June letter, Newcombe asked if Lawrence and Woolley might
follow the same path on their return to England and glean what they
could. Rather taking to their new roles as military intelligence
sleuths, the archaeologists readily agreed.</p>
<p>That journey proved to be another extraordinarily fortuitous
happenstance, but one that would ultimately play out very differently
from Lawrence’s trip to Aqaba. In the Taurus and Amanus Mountains he
would identify a crucial—and potentially devastating—Achilles’ heel of
the Ottoman Empire, one that, despite his most strenuous efforts during
the coming war, would never be exploited.</p>
<p>BACK IN HIS garden cottage at 2 Polstead Road in Oxford, Lawrence sat
down to write a long letter to a friend, James Elroy Flecker, on the
last Monday of June 1914. The bulk of the letter was taken up with a
picaresque description of a melee that had occurred between the German
railway engineers and their workers in Jerablus in May. But what is most
interesting about the letter is what it doesn’t mention. On the day that
Lawrence wrote it—Monday, June 29—the front page of almost every
newspaper in Britain told of the previous day’s assassination of the
heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, together
with his wife, in the streets of Sarajevo by Serbian
revolutionaries.</p>
<p>The news out of Sarajevo seemed to make just as little impression on
Curt Prüfer and William Yale. His long Nile cruise with Richard von
Below over, by the end of June 1914, Prüfer was living in Munich, eking
out a modest living giving public lectures on Oriental languages; in his
diary, he made no mention of the Balkan assassinations. As for William
Yale, hard at work on the road project below Hebron, it appears he
didn’t even hear of them until some weeks later.</p>
<p>All of which was actually quite understandable; the public had become
thoroughly inured to the endless saber-rattling of the European imperial
powers, the “crises” that seemed to boil up and fall away every few
months, and there was no reason to think this one would play out any
differently. But Sarajevo was the crisis that counted, because those who
wanted war made it count. A very slow-burning fuse had been lit, one
that would take over a month to burn through, but when it did, in the
first days of August 1914, it would trigger a continent-wide war that
would ultimately carry everyone down into the abyss together.</p>
<p>In his letter to Flecker on June 29, Lawrence wrote that he expected
to be in England for another two or three weeks, and “thereafter
Eastward” to Carchemish. But Lawrence’s days as an archaeologist were
over.</p>
