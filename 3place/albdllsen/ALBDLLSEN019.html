<p>It might be fraud or it might be farce, [but] no one should say that
I could not play it.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE ON HIS ROLE IN THE ARAB REVOLT, SEVEN PILLARS OF
WISDOM</p>
<p>Doggedness and a thirst for adventure had carried William Yale far
from his aristocratic origins. In 1908, those traits had taken him to
the steaming jungles of the Panama Canal Zone and, shortly after, to the
oilfields of Oklahoma and the backwaters of the Ottoman Empire. In the
autumn of 1917, they had brought him to Cairo, the locus of the Allied
war effort in the eastern Mediterranean, with the ambiguous title of
special agent to the United States Department of State. That assignment
also dropped him into a new kind of jungle, a maze of different
interests vying for power in the future Middle East.</p>
<p>“These interests crossed and recrossed each other,” Yale would write,
“creating a confused tangle of intrigues and policies which was almost
impossible to disentangle, and back of these policies and intrigues were
the interested groups in France and Great Britain: capitalistic,
religious, cultural. Added to these complications was the problem of
Zionism and Jewish desires.… No more fascinating and interesting task
could be given a man than that of attempting to understand and report
upon this most complex of problems.”</p>
<p>Smart enough to grasp his utter unpreparedness—he was literally the
only American field intelligence officer for the entire region—Yale
quickly scoured the English-language bookstores in Cairo for histories
of the Middle East. He cultivated relationships with an array of
Egyptian and émigré community leaders, and frequently dropped by the
Arab Bureau offices at the Savoy Hotel for informal chats with its
intelligence officers. In the time-honored tradition of both journalists
and spies everywhere, he diligently put in many hours at the favored
watering holes of diplomats and senior military officers; in Cairo in
1917, that most frequently meant the pleasantly appointed rooms of the
Turf Club on the Nile island of Gezira.</p>
<p>As Yale soon discovered, the fraternizing aspect of his mission
actually required minimal exertion. That’s because most every player in
the Cairo political swirl was only too eager to present his case to an
official of the United States, the newest and, if Woodrow Wilson had his
way, most influential member of the Allied military partnership. There
was one notable exception, however. “The French made no effort to
contact me,” Yale recalled. “The formality and exclusiveness of the[ir]
officials repulsed me, and a certain inherent timidity kept me from
making further advances.”</p>
<p>But if playing to his tenacious spirit, at least initially the Cairo
posting offered precious little in the way of adventure. Following
General Allenby’s capture of Jerusalem in December, Yale sought
permission from British authorities to visit the Palestine battlefront,
a request denied on the grounds that only accredited military liaison
officers were allowed. The real reason, Yale eventually deduced, was
British concern that granting access to an American would require they
do the same for their more meddlesome allies—the Italians and Greeks
were constantly asking—at a time when they had their hands full in
Palestine just trying to sandbag the French.</p>
<p>Adding to Yale’s frustration in this area was the peculiarly British
approach to avoiding confrontation, its officials quick to cede ground
when necessary, graciously inert when it wasn’t. The American special
agent had an early taste of this when, shortly after the fall of
Jerusalem, he learned that the British had imprisoned Zaki Bey, the
city’s former Ottoman military governor and the man who had been
instrumental in securing Yale’s escape from Palestine. In high dudgeon,
Yale stormed into the offices of the relevant British officials and told
them of the many favors Zaki Bey had performed for the expatriate
community in Jerusalem. He also mentioned that Zaki Bey was a close
friend of the former U.S. consul to Palestine, Otis Glazebrook, who in
turn was close friends with Woodrow Wilson. “I told them if Zaki Bey was
not released on parole, I would take the matter up with Washington and
have it brought to the President’s attention.”</p>
<p>In the face of such a naked threat, the officials of most powers
would have either meekly acquiesced or gotten their backs up, but the
British did one better. A few days later, Yale was given Zaki Bey’s
release papers and “kindly requested” to deliver them personally to the
prison where he was being held, thereby allowing for an emotional
reunion of the two friends at the prison gates. “When the British decide
to do anything,” Yale noted somewhat peevishly, “they do it ungrudgingly
and so gracefully that one feels under real obligation to them.”</p>
<p>Marooned in the Egyptian capital, the thirty-year-old Yale focused
his energies on trying to make sense of the multisided battle for
primacy in the region. One of these struggles was of fairly long
standing—the snarl of claims over the future dispensation of greater
Syria—but this had now been joined, courtesy of the Balfour Declaration,
by an equally acrimonious debate centered on Palestine.</p>
<p>Lending a certain air of unreality to these contests, as well as to
Yale’s earnest pondering of them, was that by the end of 1917 the Allied
war effort had never looked so bleak. In the western Russian city of
Brest-Litovsk, German and Russian Bolshevik negotiators were hammering
out the final details of Russia’s formal withdrawal from the war, and
already hundreds of thousands of German soldiers had been transferred
from the Eastern Front to the Western. For British and French commanders
nervously watching this buildup in France, it was a sure sign the
Germans were planning a massive spring offensive against their depleted
armies, one intended to deliver a knockout blow to the Allies before the
slowly arriving American armies could take to the field in a significant
way. The Russian collapse had even emboldened the Turks, with War
Minister Enver now scheming not only to recover that portion of
northeastern Turkey previously occupied by the czar’s armies, but also
to carry his advantage into the Turkic regions of the Caucasus conquered
by Russia in the nineteenth century. In light of all this, the constant
bickering in Cairo over the future spoils of war seemed more than a tad
premature.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Yale dutifully stayed to the task before him. In each
of his “Monday reports” to Leland Harrison at the State Department, he
strived to bring clarity to another facet of the Middle Eastern morass
by outlining the views of whatever officials or religious figures or
causists he had met with during the previous week, and by mining the
Arab Bulletin for pertinent background information. As might be
expected, though, instead of clarity, these voluminous reports with
their welter of opposing viewpoints tended to only render the situation
more incomprehensible—or at least so it would seem judging by the utter
silence emanating from Leland Harrison.</p>
<p>It appears this earnest search for insight also had the effect of
delaying the special agent’s discovery of the one simple truth to be
found amid the thicket: no one else knew what was really going on
either. Yale finally began to cotton to this in late December, after a
meeting between General Clayton and a group of Syrian exile leaders in
Cairo. To the Syrians’ deepening fears that the Balfour Declaration
meant a Jewish state was to be imposed in Palestine, Clayton stoutly
insisted this wasn’t so, that all the declaration’s “national home”
phrasing meant was that Jews would be allowed to emigrate, and to share
politically and economically in the region’s future to the same degree
as everyone else. This assurance from one of the highest-ranking British
officials in Egypt had a profoundly calming effect on the Syrian
delegation. “On the strength of what they were told by General Clayton,”
Yale reported to the State Department, “the Syrians are considering the
advisability of abandoning for the present their opposition to the Jews,
and talk even of cooperating with the Zionists.”</p>
<p>Except that immediately after that meeting, Yale fell into
conversation with Clayton’s chief deputy at the Arab Bureau, who readily
confessed that neither he nor the general had any idea what the
“national home” phrasing actually meant.</p>
<p>In seeking to unravel the Middle East, William Yale would be neither
the first nor the last observer to conclude that perhaps his most
accurate assessment had come at very first glance, before he had been
sullied by “knowledge.” As he had reported to Harrison in just his third
Monday report back in November, “the truth seems to be that Downing
Street has no definite policy and have given their agents no clear
program to work out.” As a result, those agents were adopting an
“attitude of more or less sympathy with all the varied interests,” or
simply telling everyone what they hoped to hear.</p>
<p>But finally, the struggling intelligence agent stumbled upon
something that seemed to clear away much of the obfuscation. It occurred
in late February 1918 when, reading through a back issue of the Arab
Bulletin, he came across an essay entitled “Syria: The Raw
Material.”</p>
<p>In just eight pages of terse and wonderfully opinionated prose, the
essayist had methodically delineated the myriad fissures that divided
and subdivided that country, fissures that extended beyond tribal and
ethnic and religious fault lines to even produce rivalries between
cities and towns. Completely shorn of wishful thinking, that dangerous
proclivity of bureaucratic essayists everywhere, the writer instead
painted a stark picture of the problems awaiting any outsider who might
attempt to impose their will there. Of particular interest to Yale, in
light of the debate then roiling Cairo, was how the writer “in a few
words suggests the bitterness which exists in southern Palestine against
the Zionists. This bitterness of feeling is shared alike by Moslems and
Christians, and recent developments tend only to aggravate the natural
hatred of the Palestinians for those Jews who come to Palestine
declaring the country to be theirs.”</p>
<p>What made this essay all the more remarkable was that it had appeared
in the Arab Bulletin in March 1917, fully eight months before the
Balfour Declaration, and, according to a prefatory note, had actually
been written two years prior to that. And something else caught William
Yale’s eye. Its author was already known to him. It was the same man who
had humiliated him at Beersheva in January 1914, and who had debriefed
him in Cairo at the war’s outbreak: British army major T. E.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>In fact, without apparently realizing it, Yale had already alerted
the State Department to T. E. Lawrence and his exploits. Back in
November 1917, while composing a report on the history of the Arab
Revolt, Yale had sufficiently picked up on stories circulating through
Cairo at the time to write of “a young British officer who, with the
Bedouins, organizes raids against the Hedjaz RR [railroad] and strives
to win the Bedouins over to the side of the Sherif and British.” In
February 1918, after stumbling upon Lawrence’s old report, the American
intelligence agent took the unprecedented step of asking Reginald
Wingate for permission to copy out the essay in its entirety for
transmission to the State Department. He also resolved to meet with
Lawrence the next time he passed through Cairo.</p>
<p>IN THE SAME week that William Yale was transmitting Lawrence’s old
Syria report to the State Department, Lawrence was endeavoring to have
himself removed from the Syrian war theater altogether. The cause was a
very costly error in judgment, blame for which could be placed squarely
at Lawrence’s door—or so he half hoped.</p>
<p>The seed had been planted a month earlier. On the eve of the battle
for Tafileh, Lawrence had sent Gilbert Clayton an urgent request for
£30,000 worth of gold (about million in its modern equivalent) for the
Arab force gathered on the Moab Plateau under the leadership of Faisal’s
younger brother Zeid. Without those funds, Lawrence warned, Zeid’s
followers would soon begin to melt away; with them, the rebels could
advance north against the mountain strongholds of Kerak and Madeba, then
sweep down to meet the vanguard of the British army in the Jordan
valley. In one determined drive, the rebels would finally establish a
direct land link to their British advisors and suppliers in Palestine,
while the eastern flank of General Allenby’s army would be secured
against Turkish attack.</p>
<p>Testament to both the importance of the Moab Plateau campaign and
Lawrence’s reputation for punctiliousness in financial matters—he rarely
exaggerated his needs—Clayton scrambled to gather up the gold in Egypt
and rush it to Aqaba. A few days after the Turkish assault on Tafileh
was repelled, Lawrence had personally come down to meet the gold caravan
at the rebels’ new forward base camp in Guweira, some thirty-five miles
northeast of Aqaba. Anxious to get back to the Tafileh front as soon as
possible, he had then taken as much of the gold as he and his two
escorts on fleet camels could manage—about £6,000 worth—and set off
ahead of the slower-moving caravan.</p>
<p>They rode directly into a winter blizzard, one that turned the
Tafileh-Guweira run from an easy day-and-a-half jaunt into a grinding
three-day ordeal. Driven by blind impatience, Lawrence abandoned his
slower-moving escorts after two days and, laden down with all their
gold, forged ahead alone. That proved to be a nearly fatal mistake when
he and his mount became stranded in a waist-deep snowdrift, one that
took hours of digging by hand to escape. Of course, the delays Lawrence
experienced on his prized camel were likely to be only worse for those
coming behind, putting even greater distance between him and the rest of
the gold caravan.</p>
<p>At last reaching Tafileh on February 11, Lawrence discovered to his
disgust that Zeid had done nothing in his absence to prepare for the
push north. Instead, as he wrote to Clayton the next day, Hussein’s
youngest son had “hummed and hawed, and threw away his chance.… These
Arabs are the most ghastly material to build into a design.”</p>
<p>In light of that withering assessment, Lawrence’s subsequent actions
were close to inexplicable. Eager to scout the terrain over which the
rebels would soon advance, he decided to personally conduct an extended
reconnaissance of the northern countryside even as the gold caravan
remained strung out along the Guweira-Tafileh path. What’s more, he
chose to take the only other Western officer in Tafileh, a young British
lieutenant named Alec Kirkbride, with him. In departing, he put the
twenty-one-year-old Zeid in charge of safeguarding the incoming gold,
with instructions to “spend what was necessary for current expenses
until my return.”</p>
<p>For six days, Lawrence and Kirkbride scouted the country to the north
and west, ranging as far as the eastern slopes of the Jordan valley
above Jericho. When they returned to Tafileh on February 18, Lawrence
was in high spirits. With the gold shipment now arrived, the campaign to
clear the Moab Plateau and link up with the British at the Dead Sea
appeared an easy prospect, one he estimated could be accomplished within
a month. When he began outlining this to Zeid, however, he detected a
peculiar discomfort in the young man’s demeanor.</p>
<p>“But that will need a lot of money,” Zeid finally interjected.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” Lawrence replied, “our funds in hand will cover it, and
more.”</p>
<p>It was then that King Hussein’s youngest son embarrassedly admitted
he had already spent all the money.</p>
<p>Lawrence initially thought Zeid was joking, but was soon set right.
As the Guweira gold caravan had drifted into Tafileh over the preceding
days, Zeid’s lieutenants and tribal allies, all owed back wages, had
fallen upon it as if on a cash cow. Even worse, most of the gold had
apparently been distributed to units that, for tribal reasons, wouldn’t
be participating in the push north, while those units Lawrence was
counting on as his vanguard were shortchanged. “I was aghast,” he
recounted, “for this meant the complete ruin of my plans and hopes, the
collapse of our effort to keep faith with Allenby.”</p>
<p>He also didn’t truly believe Zeid. As Lawrence soon learned, the last
caravan stragglers had reached Tafileh just the day before, barely
leaving time for the gold to be counted, let alone distributed. In a
rage, Lawrence stormed off to his tent. “All night I thought over what
could be done,” he wrote, “but found a blank, and when morning came
could only send word to Zeid that, if he would not return the money, I
must go away.”</p>
<p>Instead, Zeid only managed to produce a hastily scribbled “supposed”
accounting of where the gold had gone. True to his word, that afternoon
Lawrence saddled up his camel and, in the company of just four escorts,
set out for General Allenby’s headquarters in southern Palestine, one
hundred miles to the west. Once there, he intended to ask to be relieved
of his command, “to beg Allenby to find me some smaller part
elsewhere.”</p>
<p>If this was presented as an issue of personal honor, there was
clearly another impulse at work in Lawrence. In Zeid’s incompetence (or
dishonesty) the young British major suddenly saw the opportunity for a
kind of personal deliverance, a release from the onus of leadership that
weighed so heavily upon him.</p>
<p>This was not at all a new burden. Five months earlier, Lawrence had
confided to his friend Edward Leeds that his nerves were going and that
he “was not going to last out this game much longer”—and that had been
before his nearly suicidal mission to Yarmuk, his ghastly Deraa ordeal,
and the hideous slaughter at Tafileh. His growing exhaustion had even
registered in his most recent letter to Gilbert Clayton on the eve of
the missing gold episode. “I am getting shy of adventures,” he had
written his superior on February 12. “I’m in an extraordinary position
just now vis-à-vis the sherifs and the tribes, and sooner or later must
go bust. I do my best to keep in the background but cannot, and some day
everybody will combine and down me. It is impossible for a foreigner to
run another people of their own free will indefinitely, and my innings
has been a fairly long one.”</p>
<p>As he would later note in Seven Pillars, added to this were the
simple rigors and dangers of his duty. “For a year and a half I had been
in motion, riding a thousand miles each month upon camels, with added
nervous hours in crazy aeroplanes or rushing across country in powerful
cars. In my last five actions, I had been hit, and my body so dreaded
further pain that now I had to force myself under fire.”</p>
<p>There were precious few signs this torment might soon end; much the
opposite, in fact. When Lawrence had left Oxford for the war, his
brother Arnold had been a fourteen-year-old schoolboy. In recent months,
Lawrence had taken to counseling his brother on the skills he would
need—familiarity with Arabic, the ability to drive a range of motor
vehicles—if Arnold hoped to be assigned to the Middle East for his
upcoming military service.</p>
<p>But quite beyond these burdens was the psychic toll that came with
living a lie, “the rankling fraudulence which had to be my mind’s habit:
that pretense to lead the national uprising of another race, the daily
posturing in alien dress, preaching in alien speech,” upholding a
promise that Lawrence increasingly realized was almost sure to be
broken. In this, the slaughter at Tafileh had shorn him of the “last
gloss” of wishful thinking. “To be charged against my conceit were the
causeless and ineffectual deaths of those twenty Arabs and seven hundred
Turks in Wadi Hesa. My will had gone, and I feared longer to be
alone.”</p>
<p>Except none of it mattered. As Lawrence discovered upon reaching
Allenby’s headquarters at Ramleh on February 22, not only was
deliverance out of the question, but a new mission had already been
planned for him. Indeed, so vital was Lawrence to this new scheme that
for nearly a week an airplane had been making repeated sorties over
Tafileh valley, dropping flyers ordering that he immediately make for
headquarters. (The pilot, it would eventually be determined, had
leafleted the wrong valley.)</p>
<p>True to pattern, dramatic events had occurred on the world stage
during Lawrence’s latest absence. While bracing for the Germans’ coming
offensive on the Western Front, Allied planners had desperately scoured
their maps in search of some spot on the global battlefield where a
preemptive thrust might distract or dilute the German military colossus
building in France. In mid-February, General Allenby had been informed
that task was falling to him. As soon as possible, he was to launch an
all-out strike at the Syrian heartland, with Damascus as the ultimate
objective. The Arab rebels would be called upon to play a crucial role
in that strike, which was why headquarters had been so anxious to speak
with their chief liaison to the Arabs, Major Lawrence.</p>
<p>But then the stakes were raised even further. In the city of Brest-
Litovsk, German peace negotiators had presented their Russian counter
parts with terms so staggeringly punitive that it had caused the
Bolshevik delegation, led by Leon Trotsky, to pack up and go home. That
breakdown in talks may have been just what Berlin was looking for; on
February 18, just four days before Lawrence’s arrival at Ramleh, German
armies had begun steamrolling through western Russia, their advance
limited only by how much ground their troops could cover in a day. So
complete was the Russian collapse that on February 25 its leaders
swiftly acceded to German terms even more retributive than those it had
rejected a week earlier. For those Allied commanders nervously waiting
on the Western Front, it meant Germany was now free to shuttle even more
of its soldiers and weaponry to France, that the last small obstacle to
the approaching German offensive had been removed.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the notion that Lawrence might be
permitted to stand down from his crucial post over a point of honor was
so risible that he apparently didn’t even broach the topic with Allenby.
“There was no escape for me,” he recounted. “I must take up again my
mantle of fraud in the East. With my certain contempt for half-measures,
I took it up quickly and wrapped myself in it completely.”</p>
<p>After a quick visit to Jerusalem to see his old friend Ronald Storrs,
the city’s newly appointed military governor, Lawrence continued on to
Cairo. There, on March 8, he wrote a short letter home.</p>
<p>For many months, he had been telling his family in Oxford that he
hoped to soon make use of the leave time he had accrued since 1914 to
arrange a visit home. That hope was now more distant than ever. “I’m to
go back [to the war front] till June at least,” he wrote. “One rather
expected that, I’m afraid.” He went on to dimissively tell of his latest
promotion and military citation, stemming from his leadership role in an
action that was already coming to haunt him, the massacre at Tafileh.
“They have now given me a DSO [Distinguished Service Order medal]. It’s
a pity all this good stuff is not sent to someone who could use it! Also
apparently I’m a colonel of sorts.”</p>
<p>During his brief stopover in Cairo, Lawrence also acceded to meet
with a young American intelligence officer who was eager to speak with
him.</p>
<p>“MAJOR LAWRENCE’S OPINIONS demand the most serious consideration,”
William Yale wrote Leland Harrison on March 11, “because of his intimate
knowledge of the Arabs and the importance of the work he is engaged in.…
Speaking Arabic fluently, traveling, living and working among the
Bedouins, he has a knowledge of the sentiments and feelings of the Arab
tribes that probably no other westerner has. His knowledge of the true
condition of affairs existing at the present time among the Arabs should
be more accurate than that of any other person.”</p>
<p>It marked the third time that Yale and Lawrence had crossed paths. In
their last encounter in the autumn of 1914, the newly minted British
intelligence officer had pumped Yale for details on Turkish troop
movements and supply lines in southern Palestine. Now it was William
Yale who was the inquiring intelligence agent, Lawrence on the receiving
end of a battery of questions related to the state of affairs in
Syria.</p>
<p>Long accustomed to the opacity of British officials, Yale was clearly
startled by Lawrence’s candor. It enabled the special agent to report
back to the State Department that “the British forces in Palestine would
soon commence an offensive from which excellent results are expected.”
Even more remarkable, Lawrence provided Yale with almost precise details
on the Arab rebels’ military objectives in that coming offensive, even
pinpointing the spot in the Syrian interior where he hoped to forge a
link between the Arabs and Allenby’s forces.</p>
<p>When the conversation turned to the political, Lawrence was just as
forthright. As Yale reported, “Lawrence states the Arabs have no faith
in the word of England and of France, and that they believe only such
territory as they are able to secure by [their own] force of arms will
belong to them.” In Lawrence’s judgment, the Arabs’ inherent distrust of
their Western allies had taken on new depth with the Balfour
Declaration. “He characterizes it as a dangerous policy and speaks of
the activities permitted the Zionist in Egypt and in Palestine as being
unwise and foolhardy.” Should the British go any further in their
support of the Zionists, Lawrence warned, it could quickly bring about
the ruin of the Arab nationalist movement—or at least its end in any way
beneficial to the Allies. With his long experience in the region, he
dismissed the sunny vision of a man like Mark Sykes and his imagining of
a Jewish nation gradually forming in the face of grudging Arab
acceptance; in one of Lawrence’s most prescient comments, he allowed
that “if a Jewish state is to be created in Palestine, it will have to
be done by force of arms and maintained by force of arms amid an
overwhelmingly hostile population.”</p>
<p>For a British military officer to so openly disparage the policies of
his own government simply wasn’t done in 1918, let alone to a foreign
intelligence agent, but it reflected just how powerful Lawrence had
become: he was his nation’s vital link to the Arab rebels in the field,
no one else could fulfill that role, and because of this, he could say
or do nearly anything he wished. Yet, just as at their first encounter
in Beersheva, it seemed Lawrence harbored something of a hidden agenda
at this meeting with Yale, an agenda masked by his disarming candor.
Without showing his guiding hand, he hoped to steer Yale—and through
him, the U.S. State Department—toward a policy of his choosing.</p>
<p>Lawrence was now keenly aware of just how little freedom of movement
the Arab rebels had, that by tethering their effort directly to that of
the British, the fate of both the Arab Revolt and Hussein’s Hashemite
dynasty had become hostage to the dictates and caprices of their vastly
more powerful ally. While this had always been true to a
degree—certainly the Sykes-Picot accord made plain the Arabs’ junior
status in the larger scheme of things—what was occurring in early 1918
was of an entirely different order of magnitude.</p>
<p>This was starkly illustrated by a visit Lawrence had made to Aqaba
just days before his meeting with Yale. The once-sleepy port village had
been so radically transformed over the previous few months as to be
unrecognizable, with vast tent cities dotting the narrow coastal shelf
beyond the ship-clogged harbor, towering stockpiles of supplies and war
matériel everywhere. Where the British presence had once consisted of a
handful of officers, there were now hundreds of Crown soldiers handling
logistics, training rebel recruits, tending to the myriad needs of an
encamped fighting force of thousands of warriors. Aqaba even had its own
resident air force now, a fleet of Royal Flying Corps airplanes that
periodically set off to bomb the Hejaz Railway and Turkish military
installations inland.</p>
<p>The change in circumstances had also been evident in the manner of
his visit. Sent to inform Faisal of Allenby’s plans for the upcoming
Syrian offensive, Lawrence hadn’t gone to Aqaba aboard one of the
slow-moving Red Sea transport ships, but as the passenger in an RFC
biplane commandeered by headquarters for the purpose. In his talks with
Faisal, long gone were the languorous discussions of tactics or politics
over tea in the prince’s tent; instead, their time together on this
visit had been less an exploration of what the rebels might do in the
coming offensive than a briefing by Lawrence on what they would do.
Then, after little more than twenty-four hours on the ground in Aqaba,
Lawrence had reboarded the requisitioned airplane and flown back to
Cairo.</p>
<p>It all illustrated one of the paradoxes of power, that what the Arab
Revolt had gained in importance in the eyes of its British overseers had
come with a corresponding loss of autonomy. The ultimate danger of that,
in Lawrence’s view, was that the British were now taking their tethered
Arab allies down a path that might well lead to their destruction.</p>
<p>From the outset, Hussein’s notion of a British-sponsored pan-Arab
revolt with himself as its leader had been built on very shaky ground,
viewed skeptically by both Arab conservatives and progressives. To
ibn-Saud, Hussein’s chief rival in Arabia and the leader of the
fundamentalist Wahhabist movement, the king’s alliance with the British
made him a toady of the Christian West (never mind that Saud was also on
the British payroll). At the same time, the more cosmopolitan Arabs of
Syria had felt little in common with the Bedouin “primitives” riding out
of the Hejaz. These were problems to deal with down the road, once the
war was over, but with the Balfour Declaration the road had rushed up to
meet Hussein.</p>
<p>Taken aback by the furious Arab reaction to that declaration, the
British had put great pressure on their principal Arab ally to come out
in its support. This Hussein had done, tepidly, but instead of calming
the Arab waters, the move had served to strengthen Arab opposition to
Hussein. In early January, David Hogarth, Lawrence’s old mentor and now
the “acting director” of the Arab Bureau—the title was little more than
an honorific, true authority lay elsewhere—had called upon Hussein in
hopes of finally clarifying the boundaries of a postwar Arab nation.
Instead, he had found a king who only wished to talk of the growing
threat he now faced from ibn-Saud and his Wahhabists. Simultaneously,
Arab nationalists in Egypt and Syria had adopted ibn-Saud’s toady
language in deriding Hussein’s accommodation with the Zionists. Just how
badly this British scheme had backfired was evident in an alarming
letter Reginald Wingate received from Hussein in early February. As
Wingate reported, “[Hussein] refers to the contingency of suicide as
[an] alternative to political bankruptcy.… The phraseology is vague, but
the Sherif of Mecca appears to be affected by apprehensions caused by
the Allies’ pro-Zionist declarations.”</p>
<p>It was at this juncture that Lawrence became ensnared. In late
January, he had penned an essay for an even more restricted version of
the Arab Bulletin, one seen by only a handful of officials, in which
he’d strongly touted Faisal’s base of support in Syria, while
besmirching his opponents there as dupes of French or German propaganda.
While the article was a fairly transparent effort to boost Faisal’s
claim to authority in Syria, it also helped alert those British
officials grappling with the Arab fallout from Balfour that perhaps it
was Faisal, not Hussein, whom they should be looking to for help—and, of
course, wooing Faisal meant going through Lawrence. In early February,
just days after Lawrence’s article appeared, Gilbert Clayton informed
Mark Sykes that “I have urged Lawrence to impress on Faisal the
necessity of an entente with the Jews.”</p>
<p>The irony of being enlisted to sell Faisal on a policy with which he
himself vehemently disagreed was not lost on Lawrence, and he had only
halfheartedly agreed to do so. “As for the Jews,” he’d answered Clayton
from Tafileh, “when I see Faisal next I’ll talk to him, and the Arab
attitude shall be sympathetic—for the duration of the war at least.”
There was a limit to how far Lawrence would go, though; as he informed
Clayton, if some public declaration by Faisal was hoped for, that “is
rather beyond my province.”</p>
<p>But however much he opposed the policy, Lawrence was enough a
practitioner of realpolitik to realize he had little choice in the
matter; the Balfour Declaration was a fait accompli, the Arab rebels
were hardly in a position to renounce their alliance with the British
over it, so the chief goal now must be to limit its damage or to play it
for advantage elsewhere. In this latter category, the obvious candidate
was greater Syria. Lawrence could see a calculus whereby, in return for
the Arab rebels ceding to Balfour, a grateful Britain would then uphold
the rebels’ claim to the rest of Syria against the French. The problem
was, Lawrence had sufficiently lost faith in his own government to
realize that this was a very risky bet.</p>
<p>So what other cards to play? Certainly the most radical—and
perilous—was to negotiate with the Turks. In early February, Faisal had
received another secret peace feeler from General Mehmet Djemal, the new
commander of the Turkish Fourth Army. This missive had been a good deal
more specific and accommodating than Djemal Pasha’s previous letter, and
Faisal had sent an equally specific, if guarded, reply. While overtly
rebuffing the overture, he had also left the door open for a possible
settlement if the Turks withdrew their troops from Arabia and southern
Syria. This was not such a deal-breaking ultimatum as it might sound; by
February 1918, the Young Turks were already looking to concentrate their
military efforts on reclaiming those Turkic lands being vacated by the
defeated Russians, and might be quite happy to abandon the impoverished
and quarrelsome Arab regions to do so.</p>
<p>But before anything so drastic as cutting a deal with the Turks,
there was one more potential actor who could aid the Arab cause: the
Americans. This was almost certainly why Lawrence found the time to meet
with William Yale in Cairo.</p>
<p>Since bringing his country into the war in April 1917, President
Wilson had repeatedly stressed that the age of imperialism was over,
that his crusade for the world to “be made safe for democracy” also
meant self-determination and independence for oppressed peoples and
“small nations” everywhere. It had taken his European allies some time
to accept that the American president actually held to such a quaint
notion, but all doubt was dispelled with Wilson’s “Fourteen Points for
Peace” proclamation in January 1918.</p>
<p>Probably more than any other single document of the twentieth
century, Wilson’s Fourteen Points captivated a global audience. Amid the
abject and unending ruin of World War I, the American president had
outlined a semi-utopian vision of how the earth was to function in the
future, a radical sweeping away of the imperial structure that had held
sway for millennia, in favor of all peoples enjoying the right to
self-determination, a world in which patient negotiation at a “League of
Nations” might make war obsolete. So profound and revolutionary was this
document that it sent shock waves through all the imperial powers, the
war-shattered citizenry of Berlin and Vienna seeing it as a potential
pathway out of their misery just as much as their brethren in London and
Paris and Rome. Adding to its attraction was that in simple, unambiguous
language, Wilson had laid out a road map—his Fourteen Points—for how
this process would begin.</p>
<p>The twelfth point of that proclamation was taken up with the
dispensation of the Ottoman Empire. While the American president decreed
that the Turkish portion of that empire should remain its own sovereign
state, “the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should
be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested
opportunity of autonomous development.” To Lawrence, as to most other
objective readers, that didn’t sound at all like the Sykes-Picot
Agreement, nor, for that matter, like the externally imposed Balfour
Declaration.</p>
<p>In his conversation with William Yale, Lawrence emphasized the
enormous esteem in which Arabs of all stripes held the United States.
Indeed, so forcefully did Lawrence hit on this note that in his summing
up of their conversation for Leland Harrison, Yale noted that the main
points “upon which all evidence is agreed, are the distrust of the Arabs
in the good faith of England and of France; the opposition to Zionism;
and the complete confidence of the Arabs in the United States.”</p>
<p>Idle flattery had never been one of Lawrence’s strong suits, and this
surely wasn’t the motive behind his message to the American agent.
Rather, as Yale wrote, “he declares that later, if things should not
turn out as well as is expected, and if there should be an imminent
danger of the disaffection of the Arabs, a declaration by the United
States concerning the future of the Arabs and their country would prove
to be a ‘trump card’ to play against the Turko-German propaganda, and he
feels that such a declaration would have an enormous effect upon the
Arabs.”</p>
<p>Perhaps lulled by Lawrence’s candor on other matters, Yale appears to
have accepted this argument at face value—or at least not pondered it
too deeply. If he had, he might have realized that such an American
declaration would be a far less effective tool against “Turko-German
propaganda”—after all, the United States was at war with Germany, so her
motives would naturally be suspect—than against the acquisitive
aspirations of America’s allies, Britain and France. In essence, and
while obviously of far less treasonable consequence than negotiating
with Turkey, Lawrence was looking to a foreign government as the vehicle
by which to undermine the policies of his own.</p>
<p>To that end, the time Lawrence carved out of his hectic Cairo
schedule to meet with William Yale would seem well spent. In the months
just ahead, the State Department’s special agent would increasingly urge
his government to take a more active role in Middle Eastern affairs, and
to stand with the Arabs against those who would subordinate them.</p>
<p>DURING THE SAME week that Yale and Lawrence were meeting in Cairo, on
the evening of March 14, about a dozen men gathered in a stateroom of SS
Canberra as it lay to its mooring in the Italian port city of Taranto.
Nine were members of a group called the Zionist Commission, while two
more were British government liaisons, or “minders,” tasked to both
facilitate and monitor that group’s work. The meeting was intended as a
kind of last-minute strategy session, for in the morning the Canberra, a
converted Australian steamship, would sail for Egypt, the starting point
of the Zionist Commission’s historic mission to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Framing the task before them was William Ormsby-Gore, the British
Conservative member of Parliament who had become an ardent convert to
Zionism, and who now served alongside Mark Sykes on the British War
Cabinet’s Near East Committee. In the four months since the Balfour
Declaration’s release, Arab opposition had only grown more strident. The
primary goal of the commission, Ormsby-Gore explained, was to assure the
leaders of both the Christian and Muslim Arab communities that they had
nothing to fear from a Jewish “national home” in Palestine.</p>
<p>Chaim Weizmann, the head of the delegation sailing to Egypt, then
bluntly laid out his “one leading principle” for the mission, “which was
that until the end of the war, the Arabs were a military asset to the
British government. After the war, they might become a liability.” In
short, now wasn’t the time to be confrontational with those who opposed
them. Rather, the goal was to mollify and to calm, to bide their time
and look for advantage in the future.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this was hardly Aaron Aaronsohn’s vision of their
mission—but then he was only tangentially a member of the commission at
all. Back in London, there had been such fierce opposition to his
inclusion by some other committee members that his official status was
now that of a mere adjunct “agricultural expert,” and that only on the
insistence of American Zionist leaders like Louis Brandeis.</p>
<p>Part of this resistance stemmed from the revelations about his NILI
spy ring. That had sparked fierce debate within both the Zionist
community and international Jewry as a whole, with many accusing the spy
mastermind of having endangered the very existence of the Palestine
yeshuv through his actions. Just as worrisome, though, was the
scientist’s reputation for argumentativeness, for it was hard to imagine
a more exquisitely delicate diplomatic mission than that being
undertaken by the passengers on the Canberra.</p>
<p>At the same time that they attempted to calm Arab fears of a Jewish
takeover, the commission needed to unite the deeply fractious Jewish
community in Palestine under the Zionist banner. The best, perhaps only,
way to do this was to convince them of the dramatic changes soon to be
coming to Palestine in the wake of the Balfour Declaration—in other
words, nearly the precise opposite of what they would be telling the
Arabs. In addition to these constituencies were the British military and
political officials in the region. Even those favorably disposed toward
the Balfour Declaration tended to view it as an extraordinary
complication, a new British commitment to compete with those already
made to the Arabs and the French.</p>
<p>In the Canberra stateroom, Weizmann laid out with a broad brush how
this complex initiative was to proceed. Obviously, the favor of British
officials would be won or lost depending on whether the Zionists made
their lives less or more difficult, so the first task was to mollify the
Arabs. To this end, it would be publicly and repeatedly stated by the
commission—and by “commission” in this context, Chaim Weizmann was
referring specifically to Chaim Weizmann—that the Zionists had no
intention of trying to install a Jewish state in Palestine at the end of
the war, nor did they intend to start buying up land. To the contrary,
the Zionists fully supported the British authorities’ recent moratorium
on land sales in Palestine, and were only looking for the opportunity
for those Jews who wished to do so to return to the land of their
forebears, to engage in its political and economic development hand in
hand with the region’s other religious or ethnic communities.</p>
<p>This was to be the overt message, at least. As Weizmann went on to
explain, Zionist organizations needed to actively encourage Jewish
immigration to Palestine on a large scale, and to stockpile funds for
the purchase of land once the sales moratorium was lifted. Certainly
there was no backing away from the ultimate goal—the creation of a
Jewish state—but nothing to gain by acknowledging it publicly.</p>
<p>At least initially, this complicated dance was performed to great
effect. After an ecstatic welcome by the Jewish community in
Alexandria—hundreds of schoolchildren lined the wharf to sing the Hebrew
song “Hatikvah” (“The Hope”)—the Zionist Commission continued on to an
even warmer reception in Cairo. To both British officials and members of
the Syrian exile community in Egypt, Weizmann stressed time and again
the benign intentions of the Zionist cause. As Kincaid Cornwallis,
Gilbert Clayton’s deputy at the Arab Bureau, reported on April 20, the
Zionist leader told a delegation of Arabs known as the Syrian Committee
that “it was his ambition to see Palestine governed by some stable
Government like that of Great Britain, that a Jewish Government would be
fatal to his plans and that it was simply his wish to provide a home for
the Jews in the Holy Land where they could live their own national life,
sharing equal rights with the other inhabitants.” Further, Weizmann
assured his Arab listeners that the status of Muslim holy places would
remain inviolate, spoke with great sympathy of the Arab Revolt against
the Turks, and even suggested it was he who had pressed on the British
the land-buying moratorium. “Suspicion still remains in the minds of
some,” Cornwallis concluded his report, “but it is tempered by the above
considerations, and there is little doubt that it will gradually
disappear if the Commission continues its present attitude of
conciliation.”</p>
<p>Among those with an intimate view of this charm offensive was U.S.
State Department special agent William Yale. One of the Syrian Committee
leaders whom Weizmann repeatedly met with in Cairo was a man named
Suleiman Bey Nassif, who also happened to be one of the troika of
Jerusalem businessmen who had held the oil concessions purchased by
Standard Oil in 1914. Yale had stayed in close touch with Nassif since
coming to Cairo, and from the exiled businessman he received a detailed
account of those meetings with Weizmann. “On the whole,” Yale reported
to the State Department, “these conferences were a success, the Syrian
leaders came away from them with the impression that the Zionists did
not wish to impose a Jewish government in Palestine, and that the Jews
were coming to Palestine under conditions and with ideas that they could
accept.”</p>
<p>But if the Syrians were convinced, Yale harbored doubts. For one
thing, he found it odd that the Zionist Commission would soon be
traveling on to Palestine, their way facilitated by the British
government, while Nassif and his fellow Syrian Committee members
remained barred from the region. Yale’s suspicions deepened further when
he had a chat with Louis Meyer, the sole American “observer” delegate to
the commission.</p>
<p>Perhaps Meyer was another of those who didn’t fully appreciate the
duties of a State Department special agent, or maybe he was simply
lulled by the prospect of talking to a fellow American, but he went
decidedly off script in his meeting with William Yale. As Yale would
recall, “Meyer told me very directly that just because Weizmann was
currently disavowing any intention of creating a Jewish state in
Palestine, that didn’t imply that he was bound to that disavowal for the
future. Instead, the ultimate goal is a Jewish nation under either
British or American protection.”</p>
<p>As he probed further, Yale ascertained that the plans for that Jewish
nation were in fact quite well advanced. Indeed, within the Zionist
Commission was an ongoing debate over what should become of Palestine’s
Arab population once nationhood had been achieved, with those arguing
that “cheap Arab labor” was essential “to the growth and success of
Zionism” pitted against those who foresaw the day when non-Jews would
have to be expelled. In the end, Meyer opined, it came down to numbers,
that “as in the [American] south the white population would never submit
to a domination by the negroes, so a Jewish minority in Palestine would
never submit to a domination by an Arab majority.”</p>
<p>To the American intelligence agent, the commission increasingly
appeared to be a kind of political Potemkin village, and he took at
least a small measure of delight when the façade it was presenting to
the world suffered its first small tear. As might have been predicted,
that tear came at the hands of Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>Day after day in Cairo, Aaronsohn suffered in silence through the
interminable meetings and speeches to which the commission was
subjected, his frustration piqued just as much by the long-winded and
quarrelsome Jewish delegations as those of the Arabs. One protracted
session with a group of Jewish religious notables, in which Weizmann had
been forced to patiently explain why Zionism was not antireligious, had
almost proved too much; as Aaronsohn railed in his diary, “once again,
pearls have been thrown down in front of the pigs of the community.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the agronomist reached his breaking point at the worst
possible time, during a meeting with Suleiman Nassif’s Syrian Committee.
When one of the Arabs suggested that Jewish settlers tended to be
clannish and exclusively traded with their own, to the detriment of
Arabs, a furious Aaronsohn rose to denounce the charge as a lie.
Weizmann swiftly tried to defuse the situation, offering that while such
a lamentable state of affairs might well have occurred in the past,
steps would be taken to ensure it didn’t in the future. But Aaronsohn’s
public outburst cast an understandable pall over the gathering. “It is
to be hoped,” Yale wryly reported to the State Department, “that
Dr. Weizmann will keep Mr. Aaronsohn in the background in all the
[future] dealings of the Commission with the Arabs.”</p>
<p>Weizmann obviously thought along similar lines. At the next
conference with the same Syrian Committee a few days later, Aaronsohn
was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of April 2, Lawrence and a small entourage of
bodyguards set out from Guweira, bound for the Syrian interior. It was
the first time Lawrence had been on a camel in over a month, and the
journey quickly lifted his spirits. “The abstraction of the desert
landscape cleansed me,” he wrote, “and rendered my mind vacant with its
superfluous greatness, a greatness achieved not by the addition of
thought to its emptiness, but by its subtraction. In the weakness of
earth’s life was mirrored the strength of heaven, so vast, so beautiful,
so strong.”</p>
<p>Pastoral splendor aside, this trek had been made necessary by a
worrisome feature on the map of Syria, one that called into question
General Allenby’s proposed march on Damascus. While the British army
held a strong and orderly line across the breadth of central Palestine,
an approximately thirty-mile span extending from the Mediterranean shore
above Jaffa all the way to the Jordan River, everything east of the
Jordan still lay in Turkish hands. This meant that the farther the
British pushed north for Damascus, the more exposed they would become to
a Turkish counterattack on their ever-lengthening eastern flank. This
danger would have been vastly reduced had the Moab Plateau been seized,
but, following Zeid’s sabotaging of that effort, British war planners
had come up with a new scheme, a preliminary operation to pave the way
for the main thrust on Damascus.</p>
<p>In consultation with Lawrence at those headquarters meetings in late
February, it had been decided that the three-thousand-man Arab army
encamped in Aqaba would storm the critical railhead town of Maan, just
thirty miles northeast of the Arabs’ forward headquarters at Guweira.
Both to mask that attack and to prevent Turkish reinforcements from
being rushed to Maan, a British cavalry force would simultaneously sweep
across the top of the Dead Sea, some 120 miles above Maan, to destroy
critical stretches of the Hejaz Railway in the vicinity of the town of
Amman. Once Maan was firmly in Arab hands, all Turkish troops to the
south, including those still holding Medina, would be permanently
stranded. By then turning their attention to the north, the Arab army
and British auxiliary forces could quickly clear the railway of all the
small Turkish outposts below Amman. If all went according to plan, the
British and their Arab allies would then have a unified east-west battle
line across almost the entire length of greater Syria, allowing for the
push on Damascus to commence.</p>
<p>The role chosen for Lawrence in this roll‑up operation was relatively
limited, but one for which he was uniquely qualified. As other British
advisors oversaw the principal engagement, the assault on Maan, he was
to take a small group of rebels one hundred miles north to a valley
known as Atatir. There he would join with other tribal forces to conduct
“worrying” raids against the Turks around Amman in conjunction with the
British cavalry raid coming from the west. With that raid tentatively
scheduled for early April, Lawrence had set out from Guweira a few days
ahead of time to get into place.</p>
<p>By April 6, his party had reached the valley of Atatir. In Lawrence’s
rendering, the place was like an Eden in the first burst of spring, its
hills and streambanks a riot of young sawgrass and wildflowers.
“Everything was growing,” he wrote, “and daily the picture was fuller
and brighter till the desert became like a rank water-meadow. Playful
packs of winds came crossing and tumbling over one another, their wide,
brief gusts surging through the grass, to lay it momentarily in swathes
of dark and light satin, like young corn after the roller.”</p>
<p>If Lawrence’s high spirits and focus on the beauty surrounding him
seemed a bit incongruous for a man preparing to go into battle, another
detail made it even more so. Just before setting out for Atatir, he had
learned that two of the men he’d left to guard the Azraq citadel had
died from cold over the brutally harsh winter. One was Daud, one of the
pair of camp imps Lawrence had taken on as his personal attendants six
months earlier. The bearer of that news had been Daud’s inseparable
companion, Farraj.</p>
<p>“These two had been friends from childhood,” Lawrence noted in Seven
Pillars, “in eternal gaiety, working together, sleeping together,
sharing every scrape and profit with the openness and honesty of perfect
love. So I was not astonished to see Farraj look dark and hard of face,
leaden-eyed and old, when he came to tell me that his fellow was dead,
and from that day till his service ended, he made no more laughter for
us.… The others offered themselves to comfort him, but instead he
wandered restlessly, gray and silent, very much alone.” Despite his
grief, or perhaps because of it, Farraj had joined Lawrence on the trek
north.</p>
<p>In Atatir, Lawrence received word from the British army—but it was
not at all what he’d expected to hear. According to the plan worked out
at headquarters, the mixed cavalry and infantry force, some twelve
thousand men in all, was to charge up from the Jordan valley to seize
the town of Salt, in the hills some ten miles west of Amman. From there,
a raiding party would continue on to destroy the most vulnerable points
on the Hejaz Railway—two high-spanning bridges and a tunnel—outside
Amman. But with the enemy apparently tipped to their plans, the attack
force had been met in Salt by entrenched units of German and Turkish
soldiers, and what was envisioned as a jaunt had turned into a bloody
two-day battle. When at last Salt was secured and the raiding party made
for the railway at Amman, the enemy had been waiting there, too, forcing
the British to turn back without achieving any of their principal
objectives. But then the news grew even worse: having suffered some two
thousand casualties, the British had been forced out of Salt and were
now scrambling back across the Jordan with the Turks in close
pursuit.</p>
<p>“It was thought that Jerusalem would be recovered [by the Turks],”
Lawrence wrote of the ever more ominous reports he received in Atatir.
“I knew enough of my countrymen to reject that possibility, but clearly
things were very wrong.” Worse than the physical defeat, though, was the
psychological effect it was likely to have on the Arabs. “Allenby’s plan
had seemed modest, and that we [British] should so fall down before the
Arabs was deplorable. They had never trusted us to do the great things
which I had foretold.” With the rout at Salt, those doubts were sure to
be deepened.</p>
<p>With nothing left to do around Amman, Lawrence turned south with
fifteen of his bodyguards to join in the ongoing assault of Maan—but the
ill-starred nature of this venture wasn’t over yet. The next day, in the
desert outside the hamlet of Faraifra, an eight-man Turkish foot patrol
was spotted haplessly trudging along the railway ahead. After their
fruitless mission north, Lawrence’s men begged for permission to attack
the outnumbered and exposed patrol. “I thought it too trifling,” he
recalled, “but when they chafed, agreed.”</p>
<p>As the Turks scurried to take cover in a railway culvert, Lawrence
dispatched his men into flanking positions. Too late, he noticed Farraj;
completely on his own, the young camp attendant had spurred his camel
and was charging directly at the enemy. As Lawrence watched, Farraj
abruptly drew his mount up beside the railway culvert; there was a shot,
and then Farraj fell from view. “His camel stood unharmed by the bridge,
alone,” Lawrence wrote. “I could not believe that he had deliberately
ridden up to them in the open and halted, yet it looked like it.”</p>
<p>When finally Lawrence and the others reached the culvert, they found
one Turkish soldier dead and Farraj horribly wounded, shot through the
side. With efforts to stanch his bleeding to no avail, Farraj’s
companions attempted to lift him onto a camel, even as the young man
begged to be left to die. The matter was rather decided when an alarm
went up that a Turkish patrol of some fifty soldiers was approaching
along the rails.</p>
<p>Knowing the hideous end the Turks often perpetrated on enemy
captives, Lawrence and his bodyguards had a tacit understanding to
finish off any of their number too badly wounded to travel. With Farraj,
this coup de grâce task fell to Lawrence. “I knelt down beside him,
holding my pistol near the ground by his head so that he should not see
my purpose, but he must have guessed it, for he opened his eyes and
clutched me with his harsh, scaly hand, the tiny hand of these unripe
Nejd fellows. I waited a moment, and he said, ‘Daud will be angry with
you,’ the old smile coming back so strangely to this gray shrinking
face. I replied, ‘salute him from me.’ He returned the formal answer,
‘God will give you peace,’ and at last wearily closed his eyes.”</p>
<p>After shooting Farraj, Lawrence remounted his camel, and he and his
entourage fled as the first Turkish bullets came for them.</p>
<p>Before the day was over, there was to be one more illustration of the
mercilessness of this war, and of Lawrence’s growing imperviousness to
it. That night, as the party camped a few miles away from Faraifra, an
argument developed over who should inherit Farraj’s prize camel.
Lawrence settled the dispute by drawing his pistol once more and
shooting the animal in the head. At dinner that night, they ate rice and
the camel’s butchered carcass. “Afterwards,” Lawrence noted, “we
slept.”</p>
<p>BY MID-APRIL 1918, Djemal Pasha was probably feeling quite sanguine
about the future. Defying the rumors of his political demise of just a
few months earlier, he remained very much a force within the shadowy CUP
(Committee of Union and Progress) leadership, just as respected and
feared as before. There was also heartening news from the battlefield.
On March 21, Germany had launched its massive offensive in France,
smashing through the Allied armies before them to make the greatest
territorial gains of any Western Front army since the beginning of the
war. Indeed, the first wave of that offensive, code-named Michael, had
only stalled because the advancing German forces had outrun their supply
lines. By April 13, a second offensive, Georgette, was closing on the
French coast and the vital seaports there. Suddenly it appeared Germany
just might succeed in defeating Britain and France before the incoming
Americans could rescue them.</p>
<p>And if Germany was currently experiencing great success on the
Western Front battlefield, Turkey wasn’t doing so badly on the Eastern.
Having first reclaimed those northeastern provinces that had been
occupied by Russia, in early February Turkish troops had taken advantage
of the continuing power vacuum brought about by Russia’s defeat to smash
into Armenia. By mid-April, those troops were preparing for the next
phase of operations, a sweep all the way to the shores of the Caspian
Sea and the fantastically rich oilfields of Baku. Rather like Djemal
Pasha himself, the Ottoman Empire had become like a strange
ever-mutating organism, shorn of influence and authority in one place
only to regain it in another.</p>
<p>Looking to the south, it could be argued that earning the displeasure
of international Zionism had produced unexpected benefits for Turkey.
The Balfour Declaration had won the Zionists to the British, but it had
come at the price of an enraged Arab world. That had allowed Djemal and
other Ottoman leaders to make appeals to a number of disenchanted Muslim
and Christian leaders in Syria, and even to the chief traitor himself,
King Hussein in the Hejaz. By mid-April, there were signs that this last
and most important overture was starting to bear fruit. As Djemal had
learned through his intermediaries in Syria, Hussein’s son Faisal had
recently responded to a Turkish peace offer by setting out demands of
his own. The two sides were still quite far apart, but if there was any
lesson to be learned from the musical-chairs game that World War I had
become, it was that everything was fluid, that what had been lost
yesterday might be recovered tomorrow. All that really mattered was who
won out in the end, and by April 1918 there could be no doubt that the
advantage lay with the Central Powers.</p>
<p>This was certainly an assessment shared by Curt Prüfer, who was also
in Constantinople that spring. In curious fashion, Germany’s improved
situation was allowing him to return to the first great conspiracy he
had been involved with, one that had long looked dead but was now
suddenly given new life.</p>
<p>For the past six months, Abbas Hilmi II, the deposed khedive of
Egypt, had occupied apartments on an upper floor of the Pera Palace
hotel in the city. There, he had joined that peculiar class of
aristocracy to be found in most every European capital during World War
I, the princelings and marquises and nawabs placed on ice by their
imperial patrons on the off chance that they might prove useful at some
point in the future. During that time, the task of keeping the former
khedive entertained and feeling important had largely fallen to Curt
Prüfer. In contrast to his more sober-minded duties as director of the
German intelligence bureau, dealing with Abbas and his eclectic
entourage was often more akin to babysitting. According to Prüfer
biographer Donald McKale, “He kept Abbas Hilmi’s bickering advisers, who
denounced each other as ‘English spies,’ under surveillance, and
counseled the ex-Khedive on his difficulties with his son, his three
former wives, and a French mistress.”</p>
<p>It’s clear, though, that the German intelligence chief also saw Abbas
Hilmi as a useful sounding board. Abbas derided the secret negotiations
with Faisal Hussein as quite pointless; the Constantinople clique would
never actually cede what Faisal was demanding, and Faisal surely knew
it. A much better solution, the ex-khedive opined, was for himself to
become ruler of Egypt and then fashion a quasi-independent Arab nation
with Hussein and Faisal—one on very friendly terms with Turkey and
Germany, Hilmi undoubtedly hastened to add.</p>
<p>That had been so much idle talk in the autumn of 1917, but by early
1918 what had seemed far-fetched, even delusional, took on the patina of
possibility. By then, the first reliable reports of civic unrest in
Egypt were reaching the outside world, with the normally quiescent
population enraged by Britain’s draconian martial law rule, as well as
by the Balfour Declaration and Sykes-Picot Agreement. Then, of course,
had come the final collapse of Russia, the string of battlefield
successes by Germany and Turkey, the increasing signs that the Arab
rebels in Arabia and Syria might be looking for a way out of their
alliance with the duplicitous British. For all these reasons, by that
April, the idea that Abbas Hilmi II might somehow ascend to the Egyptian
throne didn’t seem so crazy after all—and if that happened, Curt
Prüfer’s patient ministrations at the Pera Palace might pay spectacular
dividends for Germany.</p>
<p>Abbas clearly sensed his stock rising, too, so much so that he
resurrected a long-cherished goal, one he had first put to Max von
Oppenheim three years earlier but which had been consistently denied
him. As he informed Curt Prüfer, before anything could be decided about
Egypt, he needed to meet with the kaiser. Somewhat nonplussed, Prüfer
said he would see what he could do.</p>
<p>WHEN LAWRENCE MET General Allenby for afternoon tea on May 15, both
men were at a low ebb.</p>
<p>After his fruitless trek to Atatir, Lawrence had hurried down to join
the Arab assault on the railhead town of Maan. By the time he got there
on April 13, operations were already under way.</p>
<p>The order of battle had called for the attackers to first strike at
Maan’s outlying guardhouses in hopes of luring the main Turkish garrison
out of its entrenched positions around the railway station. Initially
the operation had proceeded as planned, with one outer-ring Turkish post
after another falling to the rebels. On April 17, however, the Iraqi
commander of the Arab army, tiring of the extended waiting game,
overruled the counsel of his British advisors to order a frontal assault
on the train depot. The approach proved just as futile at Maan as it had
on a thousand other World War I battlefields. “There was nothing to do,”
Lawrence wrote, “but see our men volleyed out of the railway station
again. The road was littered with crumpled khaki figures.”</p>
<p>Lawrence had stayed on in the Maan area for several more days,
assisting other British officers in railway destruction operations to
the south, but the battle for the crucial railway town had already been
decided by that futile frontal attack. While British military
communiqués made much of the damage done to the Hejaz Railway below
Maan—with some sixty miles of track torn up, the Turkish garrison in
Medina was now stranded for good—it was a paltry achievement when
measured against the offensive’s objectives.</p>
<p>But even more dispiriting news had awaited Lawrence when he reached
Allenby’s headquarters in Ramleh on May 2. Over the previous six weeks,
Allied forces on the Western Front had only barely withstood two massive
German offensives. In anticipation of a third, Allenby had been ordered
to stand to the defense and to release tens of thousands of his best
frontline troops for service in France. It meant there was to be no push
on Damascus, that all the losses of the previous month—the failed
British cavalry raid on Salt, the disastrous frontal assault at Maan,
the death of Farraj in the desert—had been for naught. To top things
off, just prior to Lawrence’s arrival in Ramleh, the same British
cavalry commander who’d been thrown out of Salt the first time had
decided to have another go; by May 2, and after another fifteen hundred
casualties, the last stragglers of this fresh British defeat were
drifting back across the front lines.</p>
<p>All of which meant that by the time of Lawrence’s next visit to
headquarters and his tea with General Allenby on May 15, both men had
been forced to acknowledge that the prospects of a breakthrough on the
Syrian front were just as distant as ever—in fact, a good deal more
distant, for in the interval since Lawrence’s last trip to headquarters,
Allenby’s army had been poached a second time by the Western Front
generals. All told, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now slated to
lose some sixty thousand soldiers for service in France, about half of
its frontline strength, and while London had committed to covering those
losses with troops brought over from Iraq and India, it meant the Syrian
front would be dormant for many months to come.</p>
<p>But during that tea, and amid describing the massive reorganization
his army was currently undergoing, Allenby happened to mention the
Imperial Camel Corps. This was an elite unit that had been sitting idle
in the Sinai for the past six months, and the general now planned to
convert it into a conventional horse-mounted cavalry and discard its
camels.</p>
<p>From the very outset of the Syrian campaign, the greatest logistical
hurdle facing the Arab rebels had been a shortage of both transport and
riding camels, a problem that had only grown worse as the size and scope
of operations expanded. Because of that shortage, supply lines were
always stretched to the breaking point, proposed actions scaled back or
canceled outright for lack of mounts. What’s more, the frequent
camel-purchasing forays of Lawrence and other British officers had
depleted the available stock throughout the region, leading to
extortionate prices for the few decent animals left. Now, with the
proposed disbanding of the Imperial Camel Corps (ICC), some two thousand
of the finest riding mounts in the entire Middle East would suddenly
become available.</p>
<p>To Lawrence, it raised an obvious question: “What are you going to do
with their camels?” he asked Allenby.</p>
<p>Allenby laughed. “Ask Q.”</p>
<p>“Q” was the British quartermaster general, who explained that the
camels had been promised to an incoming Indian army division for use as
transport. The quartermaster general flatly rejected Lawrence’s appeals,
but Allenby was swayed by his argument that using these prize animals
for mere transport would be a colossal waste. At dinner that evening,
the commander in chief asked Lawrence how, if given the ICC mounts, he
proposed to use them.</p>
<p>Lawrence had, of course, anticipated the question. In addition, he
divined a silver lining to the British cavalry’s ill-fated second attack
on Salt. As a result of that failure, the Turks would now be convinced
that any future British attack would probably come at that same
spot—after all, repeatedly smashing up against the enemy’s strongest
points had become something of a British World War I tradition by
now—and align their troops accordingly. With the Turks concentrating
their forces in the Salt-Amman region, it would allow Lawrence,
utilizing the new ICC camels from his desert hideout in Azraq, to strike
behind the enemy’s lines and over a wide range of targets. These
included the most vital target in all of lower Syria: the railhead town
of Deraa, the junction of the principal lifeline of the Turkish forces
facing the British in Palestine. At the headquarters dinner table,
Lawrence gave Allenby his reply: “To put a thousand men into Deraa any
day you please.”</p>
<p>While those men might not be able to permanently hold Deraa, Lawrence
explained, they would certainly have time to blow up the crucial
railroad bridges in Yarmuk, leaving the Turkish forces in Palestine
virtually cut off from supply or reinforcement. At this, Allenby turned
to the quartermaster general and shook his head in mock sadness: “Q, you
lose.”</p>
<p>With the promise of the ICC camels, Lawrence rushed back to Faisal’s
headquarters. The news had an electrifying effect on the warrior
chieftains gathered there, for the “gift” of the two thousand
thoroughbreds meant the Arabs could finally take their revolt to the far
north in a substantive way. No longer would they be limited to sniping,
hit-and-run attacks; by putting enough mounted fighters in the field,
they could storm and hold population centers.</p>
<p>It also meant—and this had been a crucial aspect of Lawrence’s
thinking—that the Arabs might loosen the British tether. It would still
be some time before the ICC camels were delivered, and then they would
need to be acclimated to the harder forage of Syria, but within two or
three months’ time, the Arab rebels wouldn’t have to rely on the actions
of the British, now stalemated in Palestine. Instead, they could take
their war into the Syrian heartland independently, and with that
independence would come the chance to snatch Syria for themselves. It
was, Lawrence wrote, “a regal gift, the gift of unlimited mobility. The
Arabs could now win their war when and where they liked.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SINCE ARRIVING IN Cairo, Aaron Aaronsohn had fallen into a dark and
downcast mood. Part of it may have stemmed from his marginalized role
with the Zionist Commission, the unseemly manner with which he’d been
relegated to the sidelines, but his return to the region after a
seven-month absence also made fresh the tragedy that had befallen his
NILI organization. In Cairo, he was reunited with two of his brothers,
Alex and Sam, and from them he learned more details of their sister’s
ghastly end. Particularly enraging to the agronomist was how Sarah and
the other NILI members had been essentially handed over by their own
kind, the Zichron Yaakov Committee going so far as to post a bounty on
the head of the NILI fugitive Joseph Lishansky. Zichron still lay well
behind Turkish lines in the spring of 1918, but in contemplating his
return there, Aaronsohn noted in his diary that “if I should seek
revenge on all the cowards and scoundrels, there would be hardly a half
dozen people with whom I could shake hands.”</p>
<p>More than anger, though, the memory of Sarah, or Sarati, and his
fallen best friend, Absalom Feinberg, seemed to act as a kind of
haunting presence on the scientist, constantly intruding on his
thoughts. On one occasion, for example, he had been flabbergasted to see
William Ormsby-Gore put a telephone call through to Jerusalem. “To
telephone from Cairo to Jerusalem!” he marveled in his diary. “If only
Sarati and Absa could have lived to see that!”</p>
<p>This haunting only grew worse when the Zionist Commission left Egypt
for Palestine at the beginning of April. Aboard the night train taking
them past Gaza, a solitary Aaronsohn stood by a window to stare out at
the passing countryside. Ever the agronomist, he took note of the poor
state of the fields—“very little winter cereals, and of a poor
quality”—while observing that nothing appeared to have really changed in
his two-year absence. “Still,” he noted, “we travel by train—and we are
with the English! Absa, Absa, where are you? Sarati?”</p>
<p>But also to grow worse in Palestine was Aaronsohn’s pariah status. At
one banquet honoring the visiting commission, a group of local Jewish
elders refused to sit with the man who had “endangered the Yishuv”
through his spying activities. At several other meetings with Jewish
delegations, Aaronsohn was excoriated for the alleged strong-arm tactics
he had displayed in disbursing international relief funds in the early
days of the war. One of the few times any gratitude was shown him came
during a welcoming ceremony in the Jewish enclave of Tel Aviv in Jaffa,
the same community whose purported plight he had publicized following
Djemal Pasha’s evacuation order. As hundreds of young members of the
Maccabean Society, a Jewish civic organization, serenaded the visiting
commission members, Chaim Weizmann leaned to Aaronsohn’s side. “Well,
Aaron,” Weizmann said, “you have a great share in all this—and you paid
a big price.”</p>
<p>That moment was an anomaly, however. Weizmann’s mission to Palestine
was far too sensitive to allow for discord, whereas Aaronsohn was a man
loath to ever turn the other cheek. After a commission member took
Aaronsohn aside to urge that he bridge over a dispute he was having with
one Jewish settlement delegation, the scientist haughtily replied that
“to bridge it over would mean to establish social relations which are
repugnant to me. If my attitude is not prudent, fine.”</p>
<p>With Aaronsohn’s feuds extending even to other commission members,
Weizmann steadily pushed the agronomist further to the periphery. At
times, quite literally; in the group photographs taken of the commission
during their time in Palestine, Aaronsohn is usually seen standing off
to one side—when included in the portraits at all. By the end of April,
he had effectively parted ways to go off and work on a project of his
own.</p>
<p>Ironically, that venture was to produce perhaps the most tangible
result of the commission’s trip, for by late May, Aaronsohn had
completed a remarkable blueprint for agricultural development in
southern Palestine. In the papers and maps he passed to Windham Deedes
at the Arab Bureau was the proposal to quickly put some quarter million
acres of uncultivated and “Crown” (held by the Turkish government) land
under the plow to help ease the continuing wartime food shortages. Under
Aaronsohn’s scheme, the project would be placed under British military
control, but with the farming done by Jewish settlers and funding
provided by Zionist banks; the Zionist Commission pledged at least a
half million pounds. In its execution, all would benefit: food would be
provided to the destitute, so the Arabs would see the material advantage
of an increased Jewish presence in Palestine, and the prospect of a
decent life would entice more Jews to come.</p>
<p>Of course, once the period of military administration ended, perhaps
four or five years, title to the quarter million acres would pass to the
Zionists. But as Gilbert Clayton sunnily opined to the Foreign Office in
voicing his support for Aaronsohn’s plan, “a small favor granted to one
community can easily [be] counterbalanced by similar privileges afforded
to the others and thus, in the normal course of administration, gradual
progress can be made without causing friction and discontent.”</p>
<p>Even with the contribution of his land scheme, however, Aaronsohn
remained an outcast with the Zionist Commission—and what held for that
panel quite naturally extended to its British benefactors. At the end of
May, when General Allenby held a state dinner in Jerusalem for the
soon-departing commission, the only associate not invited was Aaron
Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>TO SKIRT ORDERS with which he disagreed, Lawrence frequently relied
on an old standby of Victorian literature: the message that goes missing
or isn’t delivered in time. This ruse had been denied him when it came
to the British effort to force an entente between the Arab rebel leaders
and the Zionists; in this sphere, Lawrence could only delay or impede at
the edges. Back in February 1918, when Gilbert Clayton had ordered
Lawrence to press Faisal on the matter, his subordinate had replied that
he hoped to arrange a Faisal visit to Jerusalem in the near future, and
“all the Jews there will report him friendly. That will probably do all
you need, without public commitment, which is rather beyond my
province.”</p>
<p>For an army major to tell a brigadier general what his needs were and
the limits he would go in supplying them was no more acceptable in 1918
than it is today, but Clayton apparently accepted Lawrence’s response
with equanimity; he surely calculated that even this partial compliance
to his order was better than nothing, since there was simply no one else
in the British command with Lawrence’s influence on Faisal.</p>
<p>Lawrence changed tactics somewhat when Clayton returned to the topic
in May. In light of the continuing suspicions that Chaim Weizmann and
his commission were encountering among the Arab population in Palestine,
Weizmann had proposed a meeting between him and Faisal. The British
leadership in Palestine had heartily embraced the idea and, on May 22,
Clayton sent a telegram to Lawrence in Aqaba seeking his counsel. “What
arrangements do you suggest?” the general asked. “I am of opinion you
should be present at interview.… Let us have your views on above points
at an early date, please.”</p>
<p>Lawrence certainly received the message—he was in Aqaba the following
day—but there is no record of his answering. On May 24, with the
timetable for Weizmann’s proposed visit now firmed up—he was scheduled
to sail for Aqaba in just five days—another secret cable was fired off,
this time from Allenby’s headquarters to the attention of the overall
Aqaba base commander. “Interview would take place at Arab headquarters
to which they would motor. Wire if this is convenient to Sherif Faisal
and Lawrence. It is important latter should be present at interview.
Urgent reply requested.”</p>
<p>Once again, Lawrence was most certainly informed of this cable, but
he still didn’t respond. Instead, on May 27, with Weizmann’s arrival in
Aqaba imminent, he found reason to depart on another reconnaissance
mission to the north, conveniently falling out of easy communication
until Weizmann had come and gone.</p>
<p>In his absence, the meeting between Faisal and the British Zionist
leader took place on the afternoon of June 4. It was an amicable and
pleasant enough encounter, with Weizmann ostentatiously donning an Arab
headdress for the occasion, even as Faisal avoided committing himself to
anything of much substance, arguing that ultimate authority lay with his
father in Mecca, and that matters in Syria remained far too unsettled to
start getting into specifics. Still, Weizmann was very satisfied by the
talk, as were British officials. As Clayton would report to the Foreign
Office after receiving a detailed report of the meeting, “In my opinion,
the interview has had excellent results in promoting mutual sympathy and
understanding between Weizmann and Faisal. Both are frank and open in
their dealings, and a personal interview such as has now taken place can
result in nothing but the good.”</p>
<p>That assessment was unlikely to be shared by Lawrence, who returned
to Aqaba from his reconnaissance mission on June 8, four days after the
Faisal-Weizmann meeting. To him, this British-imposed concord could only
provide more ammunition to Faisal’s—and by extension Hussein’s—rivals in
the Arab world.</p>
<p>But again, there was little to do about it. The British weren’t going
to walk back from Balfour. Any pressure the Americans might bring to
bear in pursuit of Wilson’s Fourteen Points plan wouldn’t come until a
peace conference, their influence on Middle Eastern affairs in the
meantime resting somewhere between nil and nonexistent. As for the Arabs
striking out on their own, the mounts of the Imperial Camel Corps had
yet to be delivered, and even when they were, it would be some time
before they had sufficiently acclimated to the Syrian landscape for
large-scale operations. Of course, there was one more possibility: a
rapprochement with the Turks. By coincidence, Faisal had received
another secret message from General Mehmet Djemal just two days before
Weizmann showed up in Aqaba.</p>
<p>In fact, Faisal’s flirtation with the Turkish general was not unknown
to senior British officials. Back in late March, a spy had given
Reginald Wingate a copy of Faisal’s note to Mehmet Djemal outlining his
terms for negotiations. “It is difficult to say how much importance
should be attached to this correspondence,” Wingate informed the Foreign
Office, “and it would be inadvisable to enquire directly from Emir
Faisal as to his motives.… [But] it confirms my suspicion that Sharif
leaders, depressed by general military situation and doubt of Allies’
policies in Palestine and Syria, are putting out feelers to ascertain
Turkish official opinion about future of Arab countries.”</p>
<p>To their credit, those Foreign Office officials apprised of this news
reacted with a refreshing lack of hypocrisy. After all, several pointed
out, Britain was unofficially negotiating with some half dozen Turkish
emissaries in Switzerland, so it would be a bit unseemly for them to
take umbrage at others doing so. Instead, and at Mark Sykes’s first
suggestion, they set themselves to the task of neutralizing the threat
in gentlemanly fashion: by bestowing Faisal with a medal. Over the next
several months, a host of senior British officials weighed in on the
debate over just what commendation might sufficiently impress the Arab
rebel leader to ensure his loyalty.</p>
<p>Curiously, one of Faisal’s strongest defenders had been Gilbert
Clayton, who hastened to inform the Foreign Office in early April that
the charge of treachery against Faisal appeared based on a
misunderstanding, that the thrust of his overture to Mehmet Djemal
seemed actually directed at an Arab-Turk reconciliation in the postwar
era. Nonetheless, Clayton had urged, London should avail herself of this
opportunity “to cement the Arab Alliance with Great Britain by all
possible means.” Those means included recognizing Faisal’s authority in
all territories east of the Jordan River, and compelling the French “to
give an authoritative statement” relinquishing her claims to greater
Syria. But perhaps Clayton’s generous view of Faisal’s actions wasn’t so
curious given his source; as Clayton noted to the Foreign Office, he had
been provided this interpretation—and perhaps his list of
recommendations, too—by Major T. E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The precise role Lawrence played in the secret negotiations between
Faisal and the Turks has never been made clear; much like the timing of
his disclosure to Faisal about Sykes-Picot, Lawrence seemed to
appreciate that he was on very delicate legal ground, and gave vague and
contradictory answers on the matter to his early biographers. What is
clear is that he saw in those negotiations a powerful potential weapon
to use against his government, a reminder that should the Arabs be
betrayed, they had somewhere else to go.</p>
<p>“At the present day,” Mehmet Djemal’s new letter of June 2 began,
“the Ottoman government, the mightiest representative of Islam, has
obtained supremacy over the greatest enemies of the Mohammedan religion.
I am persuaded that I am honoring the Prophet’s name by inviting His
most excellent and noble grandson [Faisal] to participate in the
protection of Islam for, by ensuring the supremacy of the Turkish army,
a safe and happy life will be obtained for all true believers.” The
general had closed by proposing a meeting with Faisal in four days’
time, during which “I feel sure that we shall be able to fulfill the
wishes of all Arabs.”</p>
<p>Faisal didn’t take up the offer of a face-to-face meeting, but did
send another reply. In that unsigned letter, he again proposed that all
Turkish troops below Amman be withdrawn, and further suggested that
Syria’s future relationship with Turkey be modeled along the lines of
the loose federation existing between Austria and Hungary. If that still
left matters a bit vague, Faisal’s other preconditions didn’t: all Arab
soldiers in the Turkish army were to be released for service in the Arab
army, and “if the Arab and Turkish Armies fight side by side against the
enemy, the Arab Army is to be under its own Commander.” This was no
longer talk of a mere rapprochement—and certainly not one in the postwar
era—but rather of an Arab-Turkish military alliance against the Allies.
By best evidence, Faisal sent his offer to Mehmet Djemal from Aqaba no
later than June 10. For the two days preceding, he had been joined in
Aqaba by T. E. Lawrence. It wasn’t until that same day of June 10 that
Lawrence boarded SS Arethusa in Aqaba harbor, bound for Cairo and more
consultations with the British military hierarchy.</p>
<p>The mark of a master strategist is his or her utter adaptability to
circumstance, the pursuit of advantage divorced from sentiment. Whether
or not Lawrence had a hand in writing Faisal’s latest note to Mehmet
Djemal, just days later he went into conference with the man he’d
managed to avoid meeting in Aqaba: Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>By all accounts, those talks were very cordial. Weizmann was
certainly keyed to the fact that it was upon this mid-ranking British
officer that the success or failure of his appeal to the Arab Revolt
leaders largely rested. And as one gamesman to another, Lawrence was
surely impressed by the Zionist leader’s agility in navigating the
political minefield of Palestine, the considerable success he’d had in
calming Arab concerns with one set of talking points while galvanizing
the Jewish population to Zionism with another. Perhaps not surprisingly,
the two master strategists soon found their way to common ground.</p>
<p>It was a common ground rooted in mutual dependence. To gain a
“national home” in Palestine, the Jews obviously needed the British to
win the war, which also meant they needed to support the Arab Revolt. In
his meeting with Faisal, Weizmann had offered to employ the
international Zionist movement in promotion of the cause of Arab
independence, and with Lawrence in Ramleh, Weizmann got more specific:
that promotion could also extend to funds and military training for the
Arabs to fight the Turks. For his part, Lawrence saw a potentially
pivotal role the Zionists might play in a postwar Syria. As he noted in
a secret June 16 report on his meeting with Weizmann, “as soon as Faisal
is in possession of [greater Syria], the [landowner] effendi class, the
educated class, the Christians and the foreign elements will turn
against him.… If the British and American Jews, securely established
under British colors in Palestine, chose this moment to offer to the
Arab State in Syria help … Sherif Faisal would be compelled to accept.”
With that help, Faisal could “dispense with” his domestic opposition.
Better yet, given the Zionists’ deep-rooted suspicions of the French,
Faisal would have a ready ally in neutralizing them as well.</p>
<p>That was all in the future, though. In the interim, Lawrence
counseled the Foreign Office, the Arabs should neither seek nor accept
Zionist aid, nor should Weizmann be given the meeting he urgently
sought, an audience with King Hussein.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s apparent conversion on the Zionist issue had a gladdening
effect on his superiors, even if there was a marked limit to that
conversion. Whether due to naiveté or studied wishful thinking, most
British officials in the region who had dealt with Chaim Weizmann over
the past three months had taken at face value his soothing vision of a
Jewish community in Palestine living in political and economic harmony
with the Arab majority. As one schemer sitting across the table from
another, however, Lawrence saw through this almost immediately. As he
noted in his June 16 report, “Dr. Weizmann hopes for a completely Jewish
Palestine in fifty years, and a Jewish Palestine, under a British
façade, for the moment.”</p>
<p>Lawrence would only be wrong about the timetable; it was to be just
thirty years until the British façade fell away and the state of Israel
created, with Chaim Weizmann installed as its first president.</p>
<p>AS HIS TIME in Cairo extended, William Yale chafed under two enduring
frustrations. The first was looking for any sign that his government was
actually paying attention to events in the Middle East. Every Monday
since late October 1917, he had been sending his long dispatches to
Leland Harrison at the State Department, and hearing nothing back save
for a handful of terse cables. Even his appeals for guidance—were his
reports boring his readers? did the secretary want him to pursue another
line of inquiry?—were met with silence.</p>
<p>Yale’s second frustration was more personal, his inability to gain
British permission to visit the war front. In their meeting of early
March, T. E. Lawrence had invited him to visit the Arab rebel base at
Aqaba, but Yale’s request to that end had vanished somewhere in the
British bureaucratic ether. With the Zionist Commission preparing to
embark on its fact-finding mission to Palestine, Yale had petitioned to
accompany it, only to be told by Gilbert Clayton that “there might be
some difficulty” with the plan. He had even broached the idea of
attaching himself to a delegation of the American Red Cross Commission;
alas, that nongovernmental organization hadn’t warmed to the prospect of
providing cover for an American intelligence agent. Really the only way
to Palestine, Reginald Wingate patiently explained to the American
embassy, was for Yale to be classified as a military liaison officer and
accredited to General Allenby’s staff—which, since Yale wasn’t in the
military and never had been, was a diplomatic way of keeping him right
where he was, sitting in Cairo.</p>
<p>Rather by default, then, Yale had focused his energies on what was
arguably the more important task before him: getting the Wilson
administration to realize what was at stake in the region. This was
easier said than done, for despite Wilson’s high-minded Fourteen Points
proclamation, from what Yale could determine, “our government had no
policy. It was fighting, ostensibly, for nebulous ideals, little
realizing that events are determined not at peace conferences, but by
actions during hostilities preceding the peacemaking process.… The ‘deus
ex machina’ of international affairs is not he who waits to act at some
dramatic crisis, but he who consistently acts in ways which are
constantly determining the course of events. President Wilson and his
advisors never seemed to realize this simple truism.”</p>
<p>The bitter paradox in this situation—and the source of Yale’s
frustration—was that by the late spring of 1918, most of the interested
parties in the Middle East were clamoring for the Americans to determine
events. As early as October 1917, Reginald Wingate had floated to an
American diplomat the proposition that the United States take over the
“mandate” of Palestinian rule in the postwar world, an idea that had
continued to gain currency at the British Foreign Office. If to rather
different ends, the hope of spurring American involvement had clearly
been the subtext of Lawrence’s emphasis during his meeting with Yale on
the Arabs’ high regard for the United States. Chaim Weizmann and the
Zionists made no secret that, barring a British mandate, they’d be quite
happy with an American one. Even the more imperialist-minded politicians
of Britain and France and Italy appeared increasingly willing to accept
a broad American role in the region since, barring their gaining of new
lands, the most desirable outcome was that their European “friends” not
gain any either.</p>
<p>To Yale, however, the truly decisive factor was the burgeoning
pro-American sentiment of the Arabs. While undoubtedly sparked by the
promises contained in Wilson’s Fourteen Points, this attitude was also a
fairly logical result of contemplating the morass of claims waiting to
envelop the region in the postwar era. Yale’s old friend Suleiman Bey
Nassif fairly typified these concerns. A moderate Arab Christian,
Nassif, even as he had reconciled to an expanded Jewish presence in
Syria, remained deeply suspicious of British intentions, leery of King
Hussein’s pan-Arab nation, and adamantly opposed to French designs. The
best, perhaps only way out of this mess, Nassif explained to Yale, was
for the Americans—nonimperialist, idealistic, far enough away to be
minimally irritating—to step into the breach.</p>
<p>Yale wholeheartedly agreed, but looking for the right button to push
with the Wilson administration was a grinding task; at one point, he
even tried for base economic self-interest, pointing out to Harrison
that “it is a well-known fact that certain American oil interests have
recently obtained from the Ottoman Government extensive properties in
Palestine,” one of the rare instances, presumably, when an intelligence
agent was moved to inform on his own prior activities.</p>
<p>Finally, in late April, after months of extolling America’s standing
in the region to the State Department, Yale decided to act. It came
after he met a man named Faris Nimr, a leader of the Syrian exile
community in Cairo and the editor in chief of the hugely influential
Egyptian newspaper al-Mokattam. As Yale explained to Leland Harrison,
ever since the United States had joined the war, Nimr and a small cabal
of like-minded Syrian exiles had looked to it as their homeland’s
potential savior. “Quietly these few men have been spreading the idea of
a sort of protectorate over Syria by the United States among the Syrians
in Egypt, endeavoring to do this as secretly as possible that neither
the British nor the French might become aware of it. This is an idea
that appeals to both Christian and to Moslem.… It is stated by these
ardent partisans of America that all the factions and all the parties
among the Syrians would not only unite on the question of aid from the
United States, but would rejoice if such were possible.”</p>
<p>While waiting for Harrison’s response to this message, Yale received
a bit of gladdening news from Washington on another matter. It had been
decided to send a second special agent out to the Middle East, and once
that man arrived in Egypt, it would be arranged for Yale to go on to
Palestine. The name of his Cairo replacement, William Brewster, was very
familiar to Yale; Brewster had been the Standard Oil representative in
Aleppo at the same time that Yale worked for them in Jerusalem. Thus,
while doubling the size of their intelligence network in the Middle
East, the American government had ensured it remained within the
Standard Oil recruiting pool.</p>
<p>With Brewster en route, Yale was hastily appointed a captain in
something called “the National Army”; perhaps not wishing to appear
churlish after their months of stonewalling, British authorities
declined to inquire just what this curious entity might be—the official
name of the American army en route to Europe was the American
Expeditionary Force—and instead congratulated the American agent on his
military appointment.</p>
<p>“As soon as Cairo tailors could make uniforms for me,” Yale
recounted, “I began to prepare myself to be a soldier among soldiers. I
had very little military training [actually none] and knew nothing about
military matters and etiquette. For days I walked the side streets of
Cairo in my new uniform, practicing saluting on passing British Tommies.
When they began to salute me automatically, with no smirks on their
faces, I knew I was on the way to being a soldier.”</p>
<p>It was all in preparation for an occasion the newly minted captain
rather dreaded, his formal presentation to General Allenby. In mid-July,
Yale and the new American consul to Egypt, Hampson Gary, took advantage
of a brief home visit by Allenby to make the journey up to his office in
Alexandria. “When we entered Allenby’s study,” Yale recalled, “I did not
know whether or not to salute the General. I wondered whether I should
stand at attention or sit down. The worry was needless, for General
Allenby paid as much attention to me as though I was not there.”</p>
<p>The climactic moment came when Allenby abruptly turned in Yale’s
direction and, in his practiced stentorian voice, boomed, “Well, Captain
Yale, what are you going to do at my headquarters?”</p>
<p>“I am going to continue my political work, General Allenby,” he
replied.</p>
<p>Wrong answer. “Captain Yale,” the general bellowed, “if the United
States government wishes to send a butcher to my headquarters, that’s
their privilege, [but] you will remember when you are attached to my
forces, you are a soldier!” Chastened, the American visitors soon beat a
retreat, with Yale convinced that “Allenby had classed me, a former
Standard Oil man, as one of those lower forms of life who engage in
trade.”</p>
<p>The next day, Yale boarded a troop train for Palestine and his new
billet at the British army headquarters at Bir-es-Salem, about ten miles
east of Jaffa. He found reserved for him there a small tent, a cot, a
writing table, and a canvas washbasin and bath. Also awaiting him was
that peculiar feature of the European military officer class of 1918,
the batman, or personal valet. Among British officers, the most coveted
batmen were Indian army soldiers drawn from units specifically trained
for the task, but possibly in retaliation for his importune reply to
Allenby, Yale’s was a grizzled old Scotsman.</p>
<p>Despite the rustic nature of his new surroundings, Yale was
undoubtedly pleased to be out of Cairo and away from a job that had
seemed increasingly futile. Shortly before leaving for the front, he had
finally heard back from the State Department in regard to the message he
had sent about Faris Nimr and his cell of pro-American Syrian
conspirators fully two months earlier. If not for prompt reply, his
message had been deemed important enough to go up to the desk of the
secretary of state himself. “Referring your report No. 28,” read
Secretary Lansing’s cable of July 9, “continue noncommittal attitude
relative American attitude towards Syria.”</p>
<p>THE NEWS CAME to Lawrence as a jolt, but an exceedingly pleasant one.
On June 18, he and Lieutenant Colonel Alan Dawnay, the new overall
coordinator of operations in northern Arabia, went to General
Headquarters to outline the plan for the Arabs’ independent advance into
Syria. They met there with General William Bartholomew, one of Allenby’s
chief deputies. Bartholomew listened to their presentation for a few
minutes before shaking his head with a smile; as he told his visitors,
they had come to Ramleh three days too late.</p>
<p>As Dawnay and Lawrence soon learned, what had transpired in Palestine
over the previous month was one of the very rare instances in World War
I when an army had been readied for combat operations ahead of schedule.
In recent weeks, a steady flood of British and Indian army troops had
arrived from Iraq and the subcontinent, taking the place of those
Allenby had been forced to send on to Europe, and tremendous effort had
been made in getting these troops into the line and swiftly integrated
with the rest of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. So successful had
this push been that at a senior staff meeting at headquarters on June
15, it was concluded the army would be “capable of a general and
sustained offensive” into the Syrian heartland as early as
September.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, it meant there was now no reason for the Arabs to risk
an unsupported advance into Syria. Instead, with Allenby’s timetable
closely matching that devised by Lawrence and Dawnay for the Arabs, the
rebels could simply dovetail their operations with those of the EEF. Of
course, timetables had a way of getting upended in the Middle East, so
Lawrence was greatly relieved when on a subsequent visit to headquarters
on July 11 he learned a firm launch date for the EEF offensive had been
chosen: September 19.</p>
<p>In the interim, a political development had made the prospect of re-
attaching the Arabs to the British effort even more attractive. In early
May, a group of seven Syrian exile leaders claiming to represent a broad
spectrum of Syrian society had written an open letter demanding to know
in clear and unequivocal language precisely what Great Britain and
France envisioned for their nation’s future. London and Paris had tried
to ignore the so-called Seven Syrians letter for as long as possible,
but this time international attention wouldn’t allow it; the matter had
finally been dropped into the laps of the two men most responsible for
the enduring controversy, Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot. After
much back-and-forth, in mid-June Sykes and Picot had answered the Seven
Syrians that in those lands “emancipated from Turkish control by the
action of the Arabs themselves during the present war,” Britain and
France would “recognize the complete and sovereign independence of the
Arabs inhabiting those areas and support them in their struggle for
freedom.”</p>
<p>To Lawrence, here, finally, was the reaffirming of the promise of
independence that he and the Arab rebels had been seeking for so long.
But the formulation also reaffirmed the caveat that Lawrence had always
suspected lay beneath the surface: Arab independence was only guaranteed
in those lands that the Arabs freed themselves. In light of this, the
rebels had every reason to join the coming British offensive. After his
consultations at headquarters on July 11, Lawrence hurried back to
Cairo, and then on to Aqaba, to start planning for the long-delayed Arab
advance north.</p>
<p>One of the first tasks before him in that regard was to finally bring
to an end Faisal’s long and perilous flirtation with the Turkish general
Mehmet Djemal. In late July, Lawrence passed along to David Hogarth a
copy of the peace offer letter that Faisal had sent to Djemal on June
10. The cover story Lawrence concocted to explain how he had come into
possession of such an explosive document—he claimed to have
surreptitiously obtained it from Faisal’s scribe—was absurd on its face,
but apparently had a sufficiently Arabian Nights flavor to pass muster
with his superiors.</p>
<p>Oddly, in London, the most immediate effect of this fresh revelation
of Faisal’s perfidy was to reactivate the debate, begun several months
earlier but gone a bit dormant, on exactly which high honorific should
be bestowed upon him. The episode pointed out a truly bizarre aspect of
early-twentieth-century Britain: amid the bloodiest war in human
history, and coinciding with a period so dark that the very survival of
the British Empire was at stake, more than a dozen of the most important
officials of that empire found the time in their schedules to voice
their opinions, often repeatedly, on which medal should be given to a
thirty-three-year-old desert prince. In doing so, all had ignored the
counsel of the one Briton who knew that prince best, T. E. Lawrence, and
his suggestion that Faisal wasn’t much interested in medals.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 7, 1918, Lawrence gathered with his
sixty-man bodyguard on the shore at Aqaba. His preceding weeks had been
a blur of frantic preparation, and there was still a tremendous amount
to be done before the Arabs would be ready to launch their September
attack into the Syrian heartland. For Lawrence, though, the back-base
grunt work of war—of organizing supply convoys, of plotting the movement
of men and weapons across maps—was at an end; that day, he and his men
were setting off for the interior, and would not return until the great
battle had been joined and decided.</p>
<p>Embarking on that journey undoubtedly also raised a haunting “what
if” in Lawrence’s mind. In October 1917, on the eve of the British
army’s first advance into Palestine, General Allenby had asked Lawrence
how the Arab rebels might contribute to the assault. Fearing a slaughter
of the rebels, Lawrence had kept the Arab contribution to a minimum,
instead proposing his ill-fated charge against the Yarmuk bridge. How
differently things might have turned out save for his hesitation at that
time. If the Arabs had gone all in, this last year of crushing stasis
might have been averted, the war already over; also averted, of course,
would have been Deraa, Tafileh, and the deaths of Daud and Farraj.</p>
<p>But now was the time to atone for all that. That morning in Aqaba he
told his bodyguards in their colorful robes to prepare for victory,
promised the Syrians among them that they would soon be home. “So for
the last time we mustered on the windy beach by the sea’s edge, the sun
on its brilliant waves glinting in rivalry with my flashing and changing
men.”</p>
<p>THE HEADQUARTERS OF the German army on the Western Front was a
network of pleasant châteaus and stately hotels in the small Belgian
resort town of Spa. It was there, on the morning of July 31, 1918, that
Curt Prüfer and Abbas Hilmi II were ushered into a conference room to
meet Kaiser Wilhelm II. As Prüfer recorded in his diary, Wilhelm gained
“the best impression” of the deposed khedive of Egypt, and was visibly
impressed by his grand plans for the reconquest of his homeland from the
British. At the end of the interview, the kaiser turned to Prüfer and
said, “I request that you see me next time in a free Egypt.”</p>
<p>But if the German emperor’s spirits had been buoyed by the visit, it
produced a more muted reaction in his two guests. The kaiser had aged
greatly during the war, and now seemed diminished, even slightly
befuddled. To Prüfer, attuned to the trappings and protocol of military
life, it was clear that the German emperor no longer commanded much of
anything, that for all his ostentatious medals and martial bearing he
was now almost as much a figurehead as Abbas Hilmi.</p>
<p>It was very different from what either man had expected when they’d
left Constantinople on July 23. In testament to the high hopes placed on
their mission, they had been seen off at the station by an official
Turkish government delegation that had included Interior Minister
Talaat. But then had come the long, slow journey through the heartland
of the Central Powers, images of deprivation and decline everywhere. To
both men, the land and its people looked utterly spent, the situation
far worse than just months earlier, and it belied the optimistic
pronouncements continuing to burble from the German high command and its
talk of the approaching final victory.</p>
<p>If not before, they had surely grasped the fiction of those
pronouncements once they reached Spa. On July 17, the last of the five
German offensives collectively known as the Kaiserschlacht, or Kaiser’s
Battle, that had been launched on the Western Front since March had been
halted. Their number reduced by 700,000 more casualties, the remnants of
the German armies were now falling back toward the Hindenburg Line, a
fantastically elaborate wall of defensive fortifications that ran the
length of northern France and that the Germans had begun building in
1917. Not only was there to be no German “final victory,” but also no
foreseeable end to the war; from behind the Hindenburg, Germany might
hold out indefinitely, the battle grinding on without victors or
vanquished for a long time to come.</p>
<p>This was certainly the assessment of generals and war planners on the
other side of the front. Even with the flood of American soldiers
finally beginning to reach France, the most optimistic Allied
strategists were talking of a breakthrough in the summer of 1919, while
their more conservative colleagues foresaw the struggle continuing far
beyond; some analyses had the war going well into the mid-1920s.</p>
<p>Yet as with nearly every other assessment among the wise men of the
Entente, these estimates were to be proven wrong. After the deaths of
some sixteen million around the globe, the end was coming, and with a
speed few could comprehend. Improbably, that collapse would start in one
of the most remote and seemingly insignificant corners of the world
battlefield, the deserts of Syria.</p>
