T137, Roll 23, Frame 862.</p>
<p>4 “bitter, practical experience”: Prüfer to (illegible), February 24,
1915; NARA T137, Roll 24, Frame 390.</p>
<p>5 It had been in Jerusalem: The early connections between Prüfer and
Minna Weizmann are described in McKale, Curt Prüfer, p. 42.</p>

Bethmann-Hollweg, in cover letter, March 3, 1915; NARA T137, Roll 23,
Frame 862.</p>

<p>17 The most recent bout: Lewy, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman
Turkey, p. 28. The number of Armenians killed in the so-called Hamidian
Massacres is a topic of enduring historical dispute, with estimates
ranging from a low of thirteen thousand by the Turkish government to a
high of three hundred thousand by some Armenian historians. Probably
most reliable is Lewy’s figure of between fifty and eighty thousand.</p>
<p>18 “revolutionary and political”: As cited by Lewy, ibid.,
p. 151.</p>
<p>19 “these new crimes”: US Department of State telegram to US Embassy,

<p>20 “authorized and compelled”: As cited by Lewy, The Armenian
Massacres in Ottoman Turkey, p. 153.</p>
<p>21 by best estimate: The most authoritative history on the 1915–16
Armenian tragedy is Lewy, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey.</p>
<p>22 The consensus among: As Armenian historian Vanakh Dadrian notes in
The Key Elements in the Turkish Denial of the Armenian Genocide, p. 54,
“It should be recognized in this respect that not only IVth Army
Commander Cemal [sic] in Syria and Palestine, but also IIIrd Army
Commander Vehib Pasha in eastern Turkey, despite their strong ties to
the Ittihad Party, refused to embrace the secret genocidal agenda of the
party’s top leadership and whenever they could they tried to resist and
discourage the attendant massacres.”</p>
<p>23 Reiterating a March decree: As cited by Lewy, The Armenian
Massacres in Ottoman Turkey, p. 197. See also Metternich to
Bethmann-Hollweg, December 9, 1915; NARA T139, Roll 463, Band 40.</p>
<p>24 By September: Lewy, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey,
p. 192.</p>
<p>25 “the Arabs did not speak”: Aaronsohn, Diary, April 1, 1915,
ZY.</p>
<p>26 In a particularly outrageous case: Ibid., April 27, 1915.</p>
<p>27 “I have lived among”: Quoted in Gorni, Zionism and the Arabs,
p. 56.</p>
<p>28 “Our worst enemy”: Quoted in Engle, The Nili Spies, p. 47.</p>
<p>29 The trip down had: William Yale’s account of his 1915 journey to
Jerusalem and his meeting with Djemal Pasha is in Yale, It Takes So
Long, chapter 4.</p>
<p>30 “numerous humanitarian services”: New York Times, July 29,
1915.</p>
<p>31 “I wonder when”: Lawrence to Will Lawrence, July 7, 1915; Bodleian
MS Eng C 6740.</p>
<p>32 His name was Mohammed al-Faroki: Due to the pivotal role he played
in shaping British policy in the Near East in 1915–16, Mohammed
al-Faroki remains one of the more enigmatic figures to emerge from the
period. Since he is believed to have been killed in 1922 during a tribal
war in Iraq, many of the questions surrounding him are likely to stay
unanswered.</p>
<p>New attention was focused on Faroki by David Fromkin in his 1989 book
A Peace to End All Peace, in which Fromkin repeatedly refers to the
“hoax” that Faroki perpetrated, and the extraordinary effect his actions
had on world events. To wit, “not only the McMahon letters, but also—and
more importantly—the negotiations with France, Russia, and later Italy
that ultimately resulted in the Sykes-Picot-Sazanov Agreement and
subsequent Allied secret treaty understandings were among the results of
Lieutenant al-Faruqi’s [sic] hoax.”</p>
<p>If this gives Faroki more credit than is probably his due, Fromkin
also never specifies just what his alleged hoax consisted of. Instead,
his charge appears to center on two broad points: that Faroki
exaggerated his position in al-Ahd to both the British and Emir Hussein
in order to maneuver himself into an intermediary role; and that he lied
about the strength and ability of al-Ahd and al-Fatat to stage a
large-scale revolt in Syria. In essence, Fromkin alleges, Faroki sold
the British on a false bill of goods that he couldn’t possibly
deliver.</p>
<p>But when taking as a starting point that Faroki was an ardent Arab
nationalist who was deeply suspicious of the Western colonial powers,
it’s hard to see how either of these accusations rise to the level of a
“hoax.” While Faroki almost certainly exaggerated the strength and
capability of the Syrian would-be rebels in order to exact greater
concessions from the British, in a time of war did this make him a fraud
or a good negotiator?</p>
<p>This is much more than a question of labels or semantics, however. In
Fromkin’s view, because of Faroki’s hoax, the agreement Hussein reached
with the British via the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence was purchased
with counterfeit coin (p. 186). To wit (p. 219), “The [British] Arab
Bureau believed that the [Arab] uprising would draw support throughout
the Moslem and Arabic-speaking worlds. Most important of all, it
believed that the revolt would draw support from what the British
believed to be a largely Arabic-speaking Ottoman army … In the event,
the Arab revolt for which Hussein hoped never took place. No Arabic
units of the Ottoman army came over to Hussein. No political or military
figures of the Ottoman Empire defected to him and the Allies. The
powerful secret military organization that al-Faruqi [sic] had promised
would rally to Hussein failed to make itself known.”</p>
<p>The problem with Fromkin’s thesis is that, by the time of the Arab
revolt in June 1916, neither the British nor Hussein believed anything
of the sort. As Hussein informed McMahon four months prior, the Syrian
wing of the prospective revolt had been severely weakened due to “the
tyrannies of the [Turkish] government there,” which had left “only a
few” of the “persons upon whom they [the conspirators] could depend.”
Not only does Fromkin make no mention of this famous warning from
Hussein, he also fails to note that the British had fully taken this
news into account. As Gilbert Clayton, the head of military intelligence
in Egypt, wrote in an April 22, 1916, memorandum (PRO-FO 882/4,
f. 92–3), “the Sherif [Hussein] allows that Syria is useless for
revolutionary purposes.” In light of this development, Clayton noted in
the same memorandum, “High Commissioner [McMahon] feels very strongly
that at present the Sherif should be advised to confine himself to
securing the Railway, and clearing the Turks out of the Hedjaz.”</p>
<p>In short, far from being blindsided by the limited scope of the Arab
revolt, British authorities had known well ahead of time exactly what
they were—and were not—getting by supporting it; in fact, it was they
who had urged its limited scope.</p>
<p>33 Testament to the importance: Hamilton to Kitchener, August 25,
1915; PRO-FO 371/2490.</p>
<p>34 Once Gallipoli started: In addition to Ian Hamilton’s report of
August 25, Faroki’s testimony is detailed in Clayton to McMahon, October
11, 1915; PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 223–28; Faroki’s own statement, entitled “
‘A’ Statement of Sherif El Ferugi”; PRO-FO 371/2486, f. 229–38; and in
“Notes on Captain X,” and “Statement of Captain X,” September 12, 1915,
Intelligence Department, War Office, Cairo; PRO-FO 882/2.</p>
<p>35 “far more than he”: Storrs, “Memorandum,” August 19, 1915; PRO-FO
371/2486, f. 150.</p>
<p>36 “reserve to themselves”: Cited in Antonius, The Arab Awakening,
pp. 414–15.</p>
<p>37 A week later: Florence, Lawrence and Aaronsohn, p. 172.</p>
<p>38 “There is going to be”: Lawrence, The Home Letters, p. 310.</p>
<p>39 “Things are boiling”: As quoted by Wilson, Lawrence, p. 223.</p>
<p>40 a French liaison officer: Ibid, p. 224.</p>
<p>41 “French public opinion”: Panouse to Robertson, November 13, 1915;
reprinted in PRO-WO 33/747, p. 811.</p>
<p>42 By acquiescing: Liddell Hart, Colonel Lawrence: The Man Behind the
Legend, p. 38.</p>
