<h4 id="chapter-11-a-mist-of-deceits">Chapter 11 A Mist of Deceits</h4>
<p>A man might clearly destroy himself, but it was repugnant that the
innocence and the ideals of the Arabs should enlist in my sordid service
for me to destroy. We needed to win the war, and their inspiration had
proved the best tool out here. The effort should have been its own
reward—might yet be for the deceived—but we, the masters, had promised
them results in our false contract, and that was bargaining with
life.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM</p>
<p>With the taking of Wejh, the setbacks and embarrassments that had
plagued the Arab rebel cause in recent months were being consigned to
history. Lawrence made every effort to hasten the process of
forgetfulness along.</p>
<p>After that town’s capture in late January 1917, he was briefly
brought back to Cairo in preparation for his return to Arabia on a
permanent basis. In the Egyptian capital, he kept up a wearying pace.
Along with catching up on his long-neglected reports and making
additions to The Handbook of the Hejaz, a primer the Arab Bureau was
compiling to help familiarize British officers being dispatched there,
Lawrence shuttled between the offices of the British military leadership
to provide them with firsthand accounts of what was occurring across the
Red Sea. With all, he presented a very optimistic view of where matters
stood—he even managed to concoct plausible-sounding excuses for Faisal’s
late arrival to Wejh—and insisted there was a newfound fortitude and
enthusiasm for battle among the western Arabian tribes. His assessment
stood in marked contrast to those of other British officers present at
Wejh, but success has a way of choosing winners in such
disagreements.</p>
<p>“The circle of Arab well-wishers was now strangely increased,”
Lawrence archly recalled. “In the army, our shares rose as we showed
profits. [General] Lynden-Bell stood firmly our friend and swore that
method was coming out of the Arab madness. Sir Archibald Murray realized
with a sudden shock that more Turkish troops were fighting the Arabs
than were fighting him, and began to remember how he had always favored
the Arab revolt.”</p>
<p>Perhaps none were so pleased as Lawrence’s superior, General Gilbert
Clayton. To be sure, Faisal’s insistence that Lawrence stay on as his
permanent liaison necessitated a bit of bureaucratic
reconfiguring—Clayton needed to ensure that neither Cyril Wilson in
Jeddah nor Stewart Newcombe, the recently arrived head of the British
military mission, felt infringed upon—but these were trivial matters
when set against the achievement: after all the distrust that had marked
Arab-British relations over the previous two years, suspicions that had
remained despite the ministrations of generals and senior diplomats, the
chief Arab field commander now regarded a lowly British officer as his
most indispensable advisor.</p>
<p>So hectic was Lawrence’s pace in Cairo that he apparently took little
notice of a visitor to the Arab Bureau offices on the morning of
February 1, 1917. It had been just a few days since Aaron Aaronsohn
learned of the death of his chief spying partner, Absalom Feinberg, in
the Sinai desert, and he was now being treated with a kind of contrite
respect within the British military intelligence apparatus; he’d come to
the Savoy Hotel that morning to lend his advice to a British officer
compiling a dossier on the Palestine political situation. While Lawrence
made no record of their brief conversation, Aaronsohn was sufficiently
struck by it to make note in his diary that night. “At the Arab Bureau
there was a young 2nd lieutenant (Laurens),” he wrote, “an
archaeologist—very well informed on Palestine questions—but rather
conceited.”</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason Lawrence forgot about his first encounter with
Aaronsohn—they would meet again, and to far greater consequence—was that
just two days later a chain of events began that would fundamentally
transform his mission in the Middle East. It started on the morning of
February 3, with a visit to the Savoy Hotel by his nemesis, Colonel
Édouard Brémond.</p>
<p>CUNNING AND RESOURCEFULNESS are characteristics that generally well
serve a military officer. If judged by those traits alone, Édouard
Brémond should not have been a mere colonel in the French armed forces,
but a field marshal.</p>
<p>As he’d shown repeatedly during his time in Arabia, if Brémond found
one approach to a desired goal blocked, he immediately set out in search
of another. And if that first goal was made unattainable or redundant,
he simply recalibrated his sights to something else. What made this
agility even more impressive was that, as both political and military
point man for French policy in Arabia, Édouard Brémond was juggling two
largely contradictory agendas at once: to ensure that France enjoyed
equal standing with her ally, Great Britain, in all matters related to
the war effort there, but also to try to limit that war effort from
within.</p>
<p>His long and ultimately fruitless campaign to put an Allied force
ashore in Rabegh had been only the most overt of these efforts. During
the same period, he had been urging on Hussein the establishment of a
French-Ottoman bank in Jeddah, an institution that might lend financial
credits to the Hejaz government at very attractive rates. British
officers examining Brémond’s bank proposal had quickly judged it to be
an economic trap—with no means to pay back the loans, the Hussein regime
would soon become beholden to its French creditors—and scuttled the
plan. Then there was the colonel’s perennial lobbying to have French
officers attached as advisors to the various Arab rebel formations;
while he achieved some success with Abdullah and Ali—a half dozen French
specialists had been dispatched to their camps in December—he’d had
little with Faisal, who remained deeply wary of Gallic intentions.</p>
<p>With the advance on Wejh, Brémond had seen a new opportunity. Once
that Red Sea port was captured from the Turks, the entire focus of the
Arabian conflict would shift north some two hundred miles. That would
render the Turkish threat to Jeddah and Mecca essentially moot—and with
it any argument for an Allied force in Rabegh—but it would offer up an
even more enticing target: the Turks’ last principal outpost on the Red
Sea, the small port of Aqaba.</p>
<p>Observed on a map, Aqaba’s extraordinary strategic importance was
plain to anyone. Situated at the end of a hundred-mile long ribbon of
water that forms the southeastern boundary of the Sinai Peninsula, the
port was ideally situated to serve both as a staging ground for attacks
into the population centers of southern Palestine, a mere hundred miles
to the north, and for launching raids on the Hejaz Railway, the lifeline
of the Turkish garrison in Medina, just sixty miles to the east. In
fact, Brémond had broached the idea of an assault on Aqaba with his
British military counterparts shortly after his arrival in Cairo in the
summer of 1916. The notion had found considerable favor among the
British, but with the Arab Revolt still struggling very far to the south
at that time, had been deemed premature.</p>
<p>By late January 1917, it was premature no more. Not only did the
Arabs now control the Red Sea coast as far north as Wejh, but General
Murray’s ponderous advance across the Sinai Peninsula in prelude to his
Palestine offensive was nearly complete. Lying in the gap between these
two forces was Aqaba. Its control by the Allies would secure Murray’s
right flank, ensuring that no Turkish counteroffensive could be launched
from that direction, and it would bring the Arab rebels much closer to
their British army suppliers in Egypt.</p>
<p>Of course, the plan might also finally bring about the fulfillment of
Brémond’s not-so-secret agenda: keeping the Arab Revolt bottled up in
the Hejaz. Far away from the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina,
King Hussein (he had declared himself such in late October) could hardly
object to a sizable British and French presence in Aqaba. And with that
presence, the principal Allies could dictate to their Arab junior
partners just where they might go and what they might do; any Arab
dissent on that point and the pipeline of Allied weapons and gold upon
which they depended could simply be cut off. Better yet, all of this
could be accomplished under the guise of helping the rebel cause by
moving their forward base to a place where they could more easily carry
out their railway attacks.</p>
<p>In mid-January, even before Wejh had been taken, Brémond began
discussing this idea with his superiors in Paris, and found enthusiastic
support. While Paris would pursue the matter at the departmental level
in London, the French liaison in Cairo and Brémond in Jeddah were
commanded to lobby for the Aqaba scheme among the regional British
leadership. Brémond knew just where to turn. In addition to touting the
plan to British officers in the Hejaz, he put it before his most
reliable ally in the Cairo power structure, Reginald Wingate, newly
ensconced as British high commissioner to Egypt. Wingate liked the idea
so much that he immediately took it to General Archibald Murray.</p>
<p>By the usual standards of British politeness and understatement,
Murray’s response was withering. “In reply to your letter referring to
Brémond’s proposal,” he wrote Wingate on January 22, “my opinion, from
the purely military point of view, is that the [previous] objections to
landing a force at Rabegh apply with equal if not greater force to a
landing at Aqaba.” Therein followed Murray’s usual litany of fears about
mission creep, before he turned to demolishing Wingate’s contention that
control of Aqaba would enable the Allies to strike inland at the Hejaz
Railway. “The country in the neighborhood of Aqaba is extremely rough
and rocky,” the general explained, and any push inland would be over a
terrain only certain rare breeds of camels could traverse. “To sum up,
therefore,” Murray wrote, “the French proposal to land troops at Aqaba
offers, from a military point of view, so few advantages and such
serious disadvantages, that I can only suppose that it has been put
forward without due consideration and I do not propose to entertain
it.”</p>
<p>Along with testiness, another feature of Archibald Murray’s
leadership style was a tendency to needlessly compartmentalize
information. As he well knew when writing to Wingate, the chief
impediment to an eastern advance from Aqaba was not simply “rough and
rocky” terrain but that terrain’s near impassability. A few months
earlier he had detailed a junior officer in the Arab Bureau office to
analyze a series of aerial reconnaissance photos taken of the Aqaba
region. In his report, that officer had pointed out that the port was
nestled in the very shadows of a massive range of rugged mountains that
rose steadily for thirty miles inland before descending over an equally
inhospitable landscape to the interior desert where the Hejaz Railway
lay. The only way through that wall of rock was a narrow gorge known as
the Wadi Itm, along which the Turks had built a network of fortified
blockhouses and trenchworks, leaving any military force foolhardy enough
to attempt a crossing exposed to constant ambush and sniper fire. The
issue, then, was not taking Aqaba—that was the easy part—but in ever
being able to move off its beach. A heedless move here was to invite a
miniature replay of the Gallipoli debacle—or a full-scale reprise,
depending on how determined military commanders became to compound their
initial error.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, however, Murray chose not to share this salient
information with Wingate, nor evidently with the growing chorus of other
British officers advocating an Aqaba landing. In the absence of that
information, Murray’s scornful reply to the proposal appeared to be just
another manifestation of his timidity and bad temper. That was certainly
the view Colonel Brémond came away with upon hearing the news through
the diplomatic filter of Reginald Wingate.</p>
<p>“You can confidentially inform Brémond,” Wingate cabled his
underlings in Jeddah on January 24, “that we have already given fullest
consideration here to [the] proposal to land troops at Aqaba, but in
view of our present military commitments in Sinai and elsewhere it must
be discarded. We fully recognize the advantages of this scheme, but the
troops and transport necessary to undertake a successful expedition
against the railway [from Aqaba] are not available.”</p>
<p>To Édouard Brémond, a man who’d previously been able to play Wingate
to great effect, all this apparently sounded less like an emphatic “no”
than a coquettish “maybe.” Days later, the French colonel boarded a
naval frigate in Jeddah harbor for the run up the coast to Wejh to put
his proposal directly to the one man whose desires just might override
Murray’s: Faisal ibn Hussein.</p>
<p>The two men met on the afternoon of January 30, with the more fluent
Arabic-speaking Stewart Newcombe acting as interpreter. Brémond informed
Faisal that he was on his way to Egypt to inspect his men at Port Suez,
before continuing on to Cairo. There, he intended to lobby the British
high command to send a brigade to seize Aqaba, a force to be
complemented by two French-Senegalese battalions that were sitting idle
in the French port of Djibouti, at the southern mouth of the Red
Sea.</p>
<p>Although Faisal had also set his sights on Aqaba, he refused to
endorse Brémond’s plan; as Newcombe would report, “Faisal afterwards
told me that he would like British troops to help him, but did not want
any help from the French or to have anything to do with them.” On the
heels of that meeting in Wejh, Brémond immediately proceeded to Port
Suez and then to Cairo, where he sought out a most unlikely listener.
“[Brémond] called to felicitate me on the capture of Wejh,” Lawrence
recounted in Seven Pillars, “saying that it confirmed his belief in my
military talent and encouraged him to expect my help in an extension of
our success.” That “extension,” of course, was the colonel’s scheme for
an Allied landing at Aqaba.</p>
<p>Whatever possessed Brémond to tip his hand to Lawrence? The simplest
explanation—that he saw the Aqaba plan as so beneficial to all concerned
that even the obstreperous Lawrence might embrace it—is also the least
likely. By now, Brémond was fully aware of Lawrence’s abiding distrust
both of him and of French intentions in the Middle East, a distrust so
deep that he was likely to oppose any French proposal on the basis of
its origin alone. Indeed, by Lawrence’s own account, he instantly heard
in Brémond’s Aqaba plan an echo of his hidden motive in the Rabegh
scheme, a way for the Allies to assume de facto control over the Arab
Revolt and keep it out of Syria.</p>
<p>But what Brémond surely didn’t appreciate was that the man sitting
across from him that morning at the Savoy probably knew the Aqaba region
as well as any European alive. Not only had Lawrence negotiated that
landscape during his 1914 Wilderness of Zin expedition, but it was he
who had studied the Aqaba aerial maps at the behest of General Murray,
to deeply pessimistic results. Brémond may have envisioned Aqaba being a
grand cul-de-sac for the Arabs, but in Lawrence’s estimation, it would
be for any British and French troops sent there, too.</p>
<p>When Lawrence tried to explain this to Brémond, however, the
Frenchman remained utterly sanguine. In fact, he let drop that once his
lobbying efforts in Cairo were done, he intended to return to Wejh to
prod Faisal further on the matter.</p>
<p>There may have rested the colonel’s true motive in seeking Lawrence
out that morning. The little Oxford upstart had been the most
eloquent—and, as bad luck would have it, influential—of Brémond’s
British opponents during the Rabegh episode, and the Frenchman surely
didn’t want Lawrence on hand in Cairo to pour water on any pro-Aqaba
fires he might light among the British high command. By further letting
slip that he would soon return to Wejh for another meeting with Faisal,
Brémond may have been hoping that Lawrence would immediately make haste
for Arabia, thereby removing himself from the arena where decisions were
actually made.</p>
<p>If this was Brémond’s goal, it worked perfectly. “Now I had not
warned Faisal that Brémond was a crook,” Lawrence recounted. “Newcombe
was there [in Wejh], with his friendly desire to get moves on.… It
seemed best for me to hurry down and put my side on their guard against
the [Aqaba] notion.”</p>
<p>Within hours of his meeting with Brémond, Lawrence left Cairo for
Port Suez, there to board the first ship for Wejh.</p>
<p>IT WAS A small but telling sign of the changes that war had brought.
In June 1915, when William Yale had taken his first carriage ride to the
Mount of Olives to meet Djemal Pasha, the horses had trotted up the
steep cobblestoned road with ease. Now, in February 1917, that same
journey was torturously slow, the emaciated horses in their harnesses so
weakened from two years of food shortages that it appeared they might
die in the effort. “It seemed we would never reach the German Hospice,”
Yale recalled. The oilman persevered, though, for it was absolutely
vital that he reach the Syrian governor.</p>
<p>By that winter of 1917, Yale could feel the walls closing in on him
in Jerusalem. Part of it had to do with his nationality. Over the past
two and a half years of war, the grudging respect with which the United
States had initially been regarded by nearly all the combatants, its
annoying stance of neutrality offset by its efforts at peacemaking, had
steadily eroded to something approaching disgust. In Britain and France,
it took the form of a despair that the American government might ever
recognize how its own welfare dictated that it side with the
“democracies” against the “dictatorships.” In the Central Power nations,
it took the form of a growing bitterness at an American foreign policy
that, for all Woodrow Wilson’s pious talk of being a neutral arbitrator,
clearly favored the Entente. And for all concerned was a deepening anger
that under the cloak of defending the sacred tenet of “free trade,” the
United States continued to finance and do business with both sides in
the conflict, growing ever richer while Europe bled.</p>
<p>By early 1917, however, with Woodrow Wilson’s reelection campaign
safely behind him, there were growing signs that the status quo might
soon end, with the United States entering the war on the side of the
Entente. Should that happen, those Americans still residing in Central
Power nations could expect to come in for some unpleasant treatment, and
probably none more so than William Yale. With his bare-knuckled approach
to commerce—bribery, threats, and blackmail had been his
stock-in-trade—the oilman had made a lot of enemies during his time in
Palestine, business rivals and aggrieved local government officials who
might quite enjoy seeing the long-protected American “neutral”
reclassified as a “belligerent” and hauled off to an internment
camp.</p>
<p>Yet as the menacing signs had built that winter, a personal sense of
duty had prevented Yale from asking the Standard Oil office in
Constantinople for permission to leave Jerusalem. Instead, he and his
trusty bodyguard, Mustapha Kharpoutli, made contingency plans to try a
dash for British Egypt should the Americans come into the war, even as
both knew the odds of success in such an enterprise were virtually
nil.</p>
<p>Then, on February 1, Germany had announced a resumption of its
unrestricted U-boat campaign against all merchant vessels supplying its
European enemies, a move that would inevitably target American ships and
seemed almost designed to provoke an American war declaration. That
didn’t immediately materialize, but just days later, after Wilson took
the interim step of breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany, Yale
received the cable he’d been desperately awaiting: the Standard office
in Constantinople ordered him to leave Palestine and make his way to the
Ottoman capital. In great relief, the American swiftly packed up his
office papers and personal belongings, eleven suitcases and footlockers
in all, in preparation for the long train ride north.</p>
<p>It was then that Yale discovered he was caught in something of a
riddle. As with everyone else in wartime Syria, he needed a travel
permit, or vesika, in order to leave Jerusalem. Since he was a
foreigner, however, his permit had to be personally authorized by Djemal
Pasha, and Djemal now rarely left Damascus. For agonizing days, Yale
tried to think of some way out of this conundrum, until finally he
received a tip that Djemal was coming to Jerusalem on a brief
fact-finding mission. It was this that spurred his anxious trip up the
Mount of Olives that February morning.</p>
<p>But even as he waited in the main hallway of the German Hospice for
the chance to buttonhole the Syrian governor, William Yale found his
trademark self-confidence deserting him. “America was on the verge of
war with Germany,” he recalled, “and there was nothing I could do to be
of use to Djemal Pasha. To make matters worse, I had [earlier] been
accused of being a member of a revolutionary Arab group. Certainly I
could not expect Djemal Pasha to feel kindly towards me.”</p>
<p>Perhaps another factor weighing on Yale was the singularly
unproductive role he had performed at the behest of his employers while
in Jerusalem. Despite being given concession over a vast swath of Judea
by Djemal Pasha, Standard Oil had failed to produce a single drop of
Palestinian oil for the Turkish military machine.</p>
<p>As Yale waited in the hospice foyer, Djemal at last emerged from a
far doorway and, surrounded by a coterie of high-ranking German and
Turkish military officers, strode briskly down the corridor toward him.
But the oilman froze, didn’t even try to get the governor’s attention as
he swept past. Appalled by his own timidity, Yale simply stared after
the receding entourage until someone called to him, “Mr. Yale, what on
earth are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Turning, Yale saw that his questioner was a man named Zaki Bey, the
former military governor of Jerusalem. A courtly and cultured figure, in
the early days of the war, Zaki Bey had endeavored to shield Jerusalem’s
foreign community from the harsher edicts of both the Constantinople
regime—he had reportedly warned the Greek Orthodox patriarch to hide his
church’s valuables ahead of a government seizure warrant—and the
resident German intelligence corps. For his conciliatory actions, Zaki
Bey had ultimately been forced from office by the Germans, but had
somehow remained a member in good standing of Djemal Pasha’s inner
circle. Just as important, given the circumstances of the moment, Zaki
Bey was a member in good standing of William Yale’s biweekly bridge
club. After hearing of the American’s predicament, the former governor
tore off the last page of a government document, hastily scribbled out a
travel authorization on the back, and sped down the corridor in pursuit
of Djemal. Shortly afterward, he returned, the signed vesika in
hand.</p>
<p>“As the horses jogged wearily down the Mount of Olives,” Yale wrote,
“I hummed with joy. After two long years of exile during which time I
had seen the increasing misery of war entangle those about me, I now
held in my hand a paper which would start me on my way home.”</p>
<p>Of course, what the future held once he reached that home was an open
question. If the Americans did finally enter the war, Standard Oil’s
operation in the Middle East would be shut down for a long time to come.
Thus idled, Yale would probably be let go or shunted back to the lowly
work he’d performed in the American oilfields. In contemplating this
uncertainty, the oilman apparently decided that whatever debt of
gratitude he might owe to Djemal Pasha for allowing his escape from
Palestine, it was a debt best kept to acceptable limits. During the long
train ride back to Constantinople, a grinding, stop-and-start ordeal of
nearly three weeks, Yale took very careful note of all that he observed
out its windows: German and Turkish troop movements, the status of
railway construction projects, the location of military encampments and
ammunition storehouses. Depending on what the future brought, that
information might be of great use to someone—and it might also be very
useful to William Yale.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE’S WORST FEARS had been misplaced, as he discovered when he
reached Wejh on February 6 and rushed into hurried conference with
Faisal. It was certainly true that the Arab leader was keen to move on
Aqaba, but he was just as keen that the French play no role in it; if
anything, his meeting with Colonel Brémond a week earlier had served to
only deepen Faisal’s distrust of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lawrence was perhaps secretly grateful to Brémond
for having raised the Aqaba issue, for it had alerted him to the great
struggle inevitably to come over that town’s fate. In fact, that
struggle was already under way, and the French colonel’s gambit was but
one small part of it.</p>
<p>Wejh was now the forward base camp of the Arab Revolt, and almost
every day new tribal delegations were coming in to meet with Faisal and
sign on to the revolutionary cause. Most of these tribes were from the
desert and mountain expanses to the east and north, the revolutionary
frontier opened by Wejh’s capture, and these new recruits naturally
wanted to take action in their own backyard. That meant rolling up the
Red Sea coast toward Aqaba. Simultaneously, Faisal was coming under
intense pressure from his Arab military advisors—primarily Syrian
officers who had been captured or had deserted the Ottoman cause—to
carry the fight farther north into their homeland. Both the shortest and
easiest path to do so lay through Aqaba.</p>
<p>To these clamorings could be added those of the British officers now
operating in the Hejaz, beginning with the head of the military mission,
Stewart Newcombe. For the British field officers, Aqaba’s seizure would
mean a much shorter communication and supply line to Egypt, as well as
control of the entire northern Arabian coastline. Even Gilbert Clayton
back in Cairo urged in a January memo that the brigade once slated for
Rabegh be put ashore at Aqaba. In the face of this chorus, Lawrence
surely realized that his protestations on the town’s physical obstacles
would ultimately be drowned out. Indeed, if the examples of Kut and
Gallipoli and a score of battlefields on the Western Front were any
guide, the very impracticality of an Aqaba landing would draw British
war planners to it like moths to the flame.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s contrarian view was unlikely to be much better received by
the Arabs. As with all revolutionary movements, the animating force
behind the Arab Revolt was passion, and that was a sentiment fueled by
daring and boldness, quite antithetical to pleadings for caution or
restraint. Besides, if Aqaba were excluded, the Arabs’ only other viable
path into Syria was the inland route along the Hejaz Railway, a perilous
option so long as the Turkish garrison in Medina stood at their backs.
That option also meant relying on a very long and tenuous supply line to
the coast, a line that would become more tenuous the farther north the
Arabs pushed—although this concern possibly lay more in the theoretical
realm than the practical; given the Arabs’ current rate of progress in
the inland theater of operations, it might not be the current generation
of fighters that reached Damascus, but their grandchildren.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, Lawrence could strenuously counsel Faisal
against going to Aqaba, could even expound on the trap he believed
Édouard Brémond was setting for him there, but it was unlikely to serve
as anything more than a temporary brake. But due to his unique position
in the British intelligence apparatus—privy to the innermost strategic
and political planning being done in Cairo, but also operating in the
field where those plans were to be implemented—Lawrence perceived
something else as well.</p>
<p>In 1917, the European powers still held to the imperial mind-set that
one’s claim to primacy in a place was directly linked to the expenditure
of blood and treasure in taking it, that legitimacy was established by
quite literally planting one’s flag in the soil. This ultimately was why
the French, with precious few troops to spare for operations in the
Middle East, had scuttled the British plans to go ashore in the Gulf of
Alexandretta in 1915, why they remained so uneasy about Murray’s
upcoming offensive into Palestine, and why, conversely, they wanted
every available French soldier in the region to partake in any storming
of Aqaba. It was only their physical presence, so they believed, that
ensured their imperial claims would be honored.</p>
<p>This was not a peculiarly Gallic outlook, but one that very much
infected the British as well. In all the talk of taking Aqaba, what most
everyone envisioned, including Faisal, was basically a replay of the
Wejh operation: an amphibious landing of Arab troops aboard British
vessels, an advance against the Turkish garrison heavily supported by
British naval guns, a new influx of British supplies and matériel once
the town had fallen. Except Aqaba, in contrast to Wejh, was a town of
enormous strategic importance to the British, and one that lay far
outside the Islamic “holy land” zone that had caused them to tread so
gingerly in the environs of Mecca. Having expended British blood and
treasure to seize it, the British military planners’ temptation to claim
Aqaba as their own—and simultaneously to relegate the Arabs to a
subservient role—would prove all but irresistible. When that happened,
the Arabs would be caught by the throat. For the first time, the two
principal Entente allies, Britain and France, would have a sizable joint
military force in the Middle East, and if forced to choose between
French and Arab wishes, there could be little question which side
British leaders in Cairo—or if not Cairo, London—would come down on. The
most likely result would be the marooning of the Arabs in Aqaba, either
explicitly or tacitly blocked from continuing north.</p>
<p>In short, then, Édouard Brémond was the least of Faisal’s problems.
As the Rabegh episode had shown, Lawrence could handily outmaneuver
Brémond by playing the anti-French card when Gallic interests clashed
with those of the British, but it would be a very different game in a
situation where British and French interests dovetailed. In essence,
Faisal was well primed to spot French perfidy, but what about British
perfidy?</p>
<p>As for why Lawrence might perceive all of this while others didn’t,
and why he was so ready to doubt the fidelity of his own government, the
answer was simple: the Sykes-Picot Agreement. So long as that pact
stood, British betrayal of the Arab cause in deference to its French
ally was virtually preordained, most all the pledges contained in the
McMahon-Hussein Correspondence to be nullified. Indeed, because of that
pact, the British government might have their own strong motive for
putting the Arabs in a box at Aqaba; by denying them the opportunity to
actively participate in the liberation of Syria and other Arab lands,
the British could then renege on their promises to the Arabs with a much
clearer conscience.</p>
<p>But in trying to explain all this to Faisal—to impress upon him the
need to turn away from the trap in Aqaba and make for Syria by the
inland route; to not trust in the French, but not in the British
either—Lawrence had only one potential instrument at his disposal: once
again, Sykes-Picot.</p>
<p>In the British army of 1917—as indeed, in any wartime army at any
point in history—the divulging of a secret treaty to a third party was
considered a consummate act of treason, one sure to win the offender a
long prison sentence if not an appointment with a firing squad. Yet at
some point during those early days of February in Wejh, Lawrence took
Faisal aside and did precisely that, revealing to him both the existence
and the salient details of Sykes-Picot.</p>
<p>That Lawrence appreciated the enormity of what he had done is clear
from the subsequent efforts he made to cover his tracks. In his own
writings, as well as in queries put to him by various biographers, he
remained resolutely vague about when he first learned of Sykes-Picot and
how much he knew of its specifics, implying that he hadn’t been in a
position to actually tell Faisal very much. In fact, Sykes-Picot is not
at all a complex document—it runs a mere three pages—and Lawrence almost
certainly had a complete familiarity with it no later than June 1916,
when it was circulated through the intelligence offices in Cairo.
Similarly, in Seven Pillars he fashioned a false chronology whereby his
hasty return to Wejh after meeting with Brémond in Cairo was born of the
need to warn Faisal of the Frenchman’s plan—“[Brémond] ended his talk
ominously by saying that, anyhow, he was going down to put the [Aqaba]
scheme to Faisal in Wejh”—an assertion that only worked by failing to
mention that Brémond had already put the scheme to Faisal four days
earlier. Lawrence’s purpose for this omission, presumably, was to
establish the idea, if it ever did come to light that he had divulged
Sykes-Picot to Faisal at this juncture, that he had only done so to
sabotage the conniving French. For British readers and officials alike
in postwar Britain, this anti-French twist would make for a far more
pleasing explanation than the alternative, his action less a treasonous
offense than a perfectly understandable, even admirable, one.</p>
<p>It was all a construct that Lawrence’s biographers—at least those in
the lionizing camp—have been more than willing to accept. Yet in doing
so they have glided past one of the most important and fascinating
riddles of T. E. Lawrence’s life. How was it that a man less than four
months in Arabia had come to so identify with the Arab cause that he was
willing to betray the secrets of his own nation to assist it, to in
effect transfer his allegiance from his homeland to a people he still
barely knew?</p>
<p>Surely part of it was rooted in a peculiarly British sense of honor.
To probably a greater degree than in any of the other warring nations in
Europe, the British ruling class in 1917 still fiercely held to the
notion that their word was their bond. Among the handful of British
diplomats and military men aware of their government’s secret policy in
the Middle East—that the Arabs were being encouraged to fight and die on
the strength of promises that had already been traded away—were many who
regarded that policy as utterly shameful, an affront to British dignity.
Lawrence may have felt this more viscerally by virtue of being where the
fighting and dying was taking place, but he was hardly alone in his
disgust.</p>
<p>Another part of it may have stemmed from the rekindling of boyhood
fantasies. As Lawrence would write, “I had dreamed, at the City School
in Oxford, of hustling into form, while I lived, the new Asia which time
was inexorably bringing upon us.” Here in Arabia was suddenly the chance
to be the knight-errant of his childhood readings, the liberator of an
enslaved and broken people, and with this came a sense of purpose far
stronger than any appeal to petty nationalism or to an empire that every
day was further proving its unworthiness and obsolescence.</p>
<p>Whatever the combination of motives—and Lawrence may not have fully
grasped them himself—the effect of his revelation to Faisal was both
immediate and dramatic. The Arab leader now understood that despite
their promises, the British were not going to simply cede Syria; if the
Arabs wanted it, they would have to fight for it. Within days of
Lawrence’s return to Wejh, other British officers were noting with
puzzlement how Faisal had suddenly cooled on the idea of an Aqaba
operation; instead, his sole focus was on carrying his rebellion to
points farther north, into the Syrian heartland itself.</p>
<p>It was the same news Édouard Brémond heard on his next visit to Wejh
on February 18. With Lawrence sitting in, Faisal informed the French
colonel that he was now firmly opposed to an Aqaba landing, and instead
intended to redouble his efforts inland. He once again turned down
Brémond’s offer of French advisors, explaining that he had no need for
them, and even offered an arch apology for the ever-broadening scale of
his military plans; he would happily concentrate his efforts on Medina,
he told Brémond, if only he had the same French artillery “to reply to
the guns which the French had supplied to the Turks.” Outflanked once
again, Lawrence gleefully noted, Brémond had little choice but “to
retire from the battle in good order.”</p>
<p>In subsequent weeks, the various British officers stationed in Wejh
continually tried to rein in Faisal’s suddenly lofty plans, to get him
to focus on the immediate matters at hand. To little avail. As one of
those officers, Major Pierce Joyce, would write on April 1, “I am still
of the opinion that Sherif Faisal’s whole attention is directed towards
the North.… I have endeavored to confine Faisal to local ambitions and
military operations, but from somewhere he has developed very wide
ideas.”</p>
<p>As for where Faisal might have developed those ideas, senior British
officers remained baffled. Certainly, they didn’t suspect Captain
Lawrence. In an early March report to Cairo, Cyril Wilson’s deputy in
Jeddah singled Lawrence out for praise, calling him of “inestimable
value.”</p>
<p>FOR DJEMAL PASHA, the options were narrowing. Since the beginning of
the year, the signs that the British would soon launch their
long-awaited offensive in southern Palestine had grown increasingly
obvious. By February, Turkish units had steadily ceded ground all the
way to the outskirts of the town of Gaza, and still the British were
closing; German aerial spotters reported a veritable sea of tent
encampments and supply depots strung along the new, British-laid railway
clear back to El Arish, forty miles away. While estimates of the British
attack force varied, the one certainty was that it vastly outnumbered
the some twenty thousand Turkish defenders standing to meet it.</p>
<p>It was a disparity that Djemal despaired of closing, for everywhere
across the empire, the Ottoman army was stretched to the breaking point:
actively engaged on two fronts in Europe, squared off against the
Russians in eastern Anatolia, and now falling back before a second
British Indian invasion force in Iraq. Even if any troops could be
spared from these other fronts—and the reality was, they couldn’t—it
seemed all but impossible that they might reach Palestine in time to
meet the British attack. With no other choice, then, Djemal had
reluctantly turned his gaze to the ten thousand troops still holding
Medina.</p>
<p>Any thought of abandoning that Arabian city was an extraordinarily
painful one, which is probably why the governor had put it off until the
eleventh hour. Not only did Medina anchor the southern terminus of the
Hejaz Railway, but Turkish control was absolute, never seriously
threatened by the disorganized and outgunned Arab rebels who
sporadically sniped about its edges; as such, it stood as a bulwark
against the schemes of Emir Hussein to spread his revolt north. To give
up Medina, Islam’s second holiest city, would also be to hand the rebels
and their British paymasters a tremendous psychological victory, the
mantle of religious primacy in the eyes of the greater Muslim world.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Turkish troops in Medina were some of the
finest to be found in the Ottoman Empire, and led by one of its ablest
generals, Fakhri Pasha; their presence on the Palestine front could make
the difference between victory and defeat. And so, under the urging of
Enver Pasha and the German military high command in Constantinople, in
late February Djemal sent down word that Medina was to be given up, its
garrison to begin the long trek back up the Hejaz Railway to Syria and
hurried into the trenchlines in Gaza.</p>
<p>That order drew an immediate and ferocious response from a man named
Ali Haidar. In the wake of Hussein’s revolt the previous summer,
Constantinople had handpicked Haidar as the new “legitimate” mufti of
Mecca and bundled him south to assume his position of supreme religious
authority. Haidar had ventured no farther than Medina, of course, but
there he had established a kind of “puppet papacy” in rivalry to
Hussein’s regime in Mecca. If rejected by most Hejazi Arabs, Haidar’s
claim to being the true guardian of Islam’s holiest shrines had given
sufficient pause to the international Muslim community to blunt
Hussein’s appeal. All that would be lost if Medina was abandoned. “The
news horrified me,” Haidar wrote in his memoir. “Hastily I sent a
strongly-worded telegram to Djemal in which I said the very idea of
deserting the Holy Tomb was utterly shameful, and that it should be
protected to the last man, if necessary.”</p>
<p>The mufti clearly knew his audience, for just days after issuing his
Medina withdrawal order, Djemal abruptly rescinded it; the city would
stay in Turkish hands, and the outnumbered troops bracing for the
British attack in Palestine would have to manage as best they could on
their own.</p>
<p>But in one of those odd little wrinkles of history, the brief and
quickly resolved Turkish debate over the future of Medina was about to
have far-reaching consequences. That’s because British military
cryptographers intercepted and decoded Djemal Pasha’s cable ordering the
garrison’s withdrawal, but failed to intercept his subsequent
cancellation order. As a result, the Arab rebels and their British
advisors would devote their energies of the next several months
responding to an event that wasn’t going to happen. It was also in these
circumstances that T. E. Lawrence would eventually have his greatest
epiphany about the Arab Revolt and how it should be fought.</p>
<p>AS INSTRUCTED, LAWRENCE was waiting at the dock when the Nur el Bahr,
an Egyptian patrol boat, put into Wejh on the morning of March 8. There
he took delivery from a British army courier of two rather extraordinary
documents.</p>
<p>The first was a transcript of Djemal Pasha’s cable ordering the
abandonment of Medina. As soon as could be organized, Djemal had
instructed, the Turkish garrison was to begin moving up the Hejaz
Railway, taking all artillery and other war matériel with them, and to
form a new defensive line in the Syrian city of Maan, five hundred miles
to the north. From there, whatever troops could be spared were to be
rushed to the redoubt of Gaza in southern Palestine.</p>
<p>The second was a directive from Gilbert Clayton in Cairo. With
General Murray’s Palestine offensive now just weeks away, it was vital
that no reinforcements reach the Turkish defenders in Gaza, which meant
every effort should be made to halt the Medina garrison’s departure.
With the technical support of their British advisors, the Arab rebels
were to dramatically expand their attacks on the Hejaz Railway,
rendering as much damage to it as possible, and to make a blocking stand
against the withdrawing Turkish units if necessary. With his usual
propensity for discretion, Clayton suggested that neither Faisal nor the
other Arab commanders need be informed of the reason for this
escalation.</p>
<p>That directive placed Lawrence in another difficult spot. On the one
hand, focusing on the railway played very much into his personal effort
to get Faisal to concentrate on inland operations and to turn away from
the attractive trap of Aqaba. On the other, taking Medina had been a
primary objective of the Arab Revolt from the outset, and an Ottoman
withdrawal from that city would be nearly as great a psychological
victory to the rebels as an Ottoman surrender. Now the Arabs were being
asked not only to forgo the prize they had fought so long for but to
commit men to battle to prevent its delivery.</p>
<p>This, of course, was the motive behind Clayton’s call for secrecy,
but it raised at least two morally troublesome issues. If the Arabs were
persuaded to occupy a stretch of the railway between Medina and Maan as
a blocking force without being told why, then they also wouldn’t know
that they stood squarely in the path of the redeploying Medina
garrison—and there could be few illusions about the outcome of the
lightly armed Arab tribesmen crashing up against one of Turkey’s
best-equipped armies in the open desert. There was also the point that
the Arabs were now being asked to fight—and, inevitably, to take
casualties—in the Hejaz so as to lighten the burden and death toll of
British troops in Gaza. Certainly, that came with the territory of
membership in a military alliance, but just as certainly, in Lawrence’s
estimation, the British owed it to their Arab allies to tell them
why.</p>
<p>Since he had technically committed treason just weeks earlier with
his divulging of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, this edict was much easier
for Lawrence to disobey. “In spite of General Clayton’s orders,” he
wrote Cyril Wilson that evening, “I told [Faisal] something of the
situation. It would have been impossible for me to have done anything
myself on the necessary scale.” As he would later recount in Seven
Pillars, Faisal “rose, as ever, to a proposition of honour, and agreed
instantly to do his best.”</p>
<p>The immediate task was to get word of the new directive to
Abdullah—with his followers massed near the Hejaz Railway at Wadi Ais,
it would be they who would carry or lose the day—but given the past
lassitude of Hussein’s second son, Lawrence was convinced that both
delivering that critical message and seeing it carried out had to be
done by a British officer. With Stewart Newcombe and the handful of
other British officers who knew the Hejaz interior already out on
scouting or demolition missions, that left him. In the same hurried note
he scribbled out for Cyril Wilson that evening, Lawrence explained that
his plans were quite ad hoc given how little time he had to prepare:</p>
<p>“I think the weak point of the Turk [evacuation] plans lies in the
trains of water and food. If we can cut the line on such a scale that
they cannot repair it, or smash their locomotives, the force will come
to a standstill.… If only we can hold them up for ten days. I’m afraid
it will be touch and go. I am taking some Garland mines with me, if I
can find instantaneous fuse, and if there is time, I will set them as
near Medina as possible: it is partly for this reason that I am going up
myself.”</p>
<p>Under the cover of darkness on the night of March 10, Lawrence set
out with an escort of just fourteen fighters for the grinding five-day
trek to Abdullah’s camp.</p>
<p>It was a brutal journey from the outset. Lawrence was already in the
grip of a severe bout of dysentery, and by noon of the following day was
also afflicted with boils that covered his back. It was all he could do
to stay in his camel’s saddle as the small party plodded through one of
the more desolate landscapes to be found in western Arabia. By the next
day, March 12, his condition had worsened still, the dysentery twice
causing him to faint “when the more difficult parts of the climb had
asked too much of my strength.”</p>
<p>Preoccupied by his own torments, Lawrence apparently failed to notice
the growing friction among his small entourage, which was drawn from a
fragile assortment of previously feuding tribes. What had been
good-natured ribbing between them at the journey’s outset had steadily
escalated to the exchange of insults and veiled threats, a simmering
stew of tension. Matters came to a head that same evening.</p>
<p>Taking shelter for the night in a mountain close known as Wadi Kitan,
Lawrence fell into exhausted rest among the rocks. That ended with the
report of a gunshot echoing through the canyon. Roused by one of his
escorts, Lawrence was led over the rocks to view the body of a member of
the traveling party, an Ageyl tribesman named Salem, dead with a bullet
through the temple. With the skin around the entry wound burnt, it was
clear the killing had been done at close range, which meant by another
member of the group. Very quickly, the finger of suspicion fell upon a
Moroccan named Hamed. During an ad hoc trial, Hamed ultimately
confessed, and Salem’s Ageyl brethren demanded blood for blood.</p>
<p>Over the preceding months, Lawrence had watched in fascinated
admiration as Faisal had acted as peacemaker in scores of tribal feuds,
disputes running the gamut of questions over foraging rights to
decades-old—even centuries-old—blood vendettas. It was a role Faisal
would continue to fulfill throughout the war. “An account of profit and
loss would be struck between the parties,” Lawrence later recalled,
“with Faisal modulating and interceding between them, and often paying
the balance, or contributing towards it from his own funds, to hurry on
the pact. During two years Faisal so labored daily, putting together and
arranging in their natural order the innumerable tiny pieces which made
up Arabian society [that] there was no blood feud left active in any of
the districts through which he had passed.”</p>
<p>What made the system work was a collective faith in the mediator’s
impartiality, but it was an arrangement that came with a harsh side:
when necessary, the peacemaker also had to act as the dispenser of
justice.</p>
<p>The horror of what lay before him in Wadi Kitan seemed to slowly dawn
on Lawrence. If the Ageyl insisted on Hamed’s death, then it had to be
so; this was the law of the desert. But while his execution by Salem’s
Ageyl kinsmen might ensure short-term peace on the journey to Abdullah’s
camp, once word of it reached the larger rebel community it was sure to
spark a blood vendetta between the Ageyl, a very important and numerous
tribe, and the many Moroccans who had joined the revolt. The only real
solution, then, was for an impartial third party to carry out Hamed’s
execution, and in Wadi Kitan that night there was only one person who
was “a stranger and kinless.” As Lawrence would recall in Seven Pillars,
“I made [Hamed] enter a narrow gully of the spur, a dank twilight place
overgrown with weeds. Its sandy bed had been pitted by trickles of water
down the cliffs in the late rain.… I stood in the entrance and gave him
a few moments’ delay, which he spent crying on the ground. Then I made
him rise and shot him through the chest.”</p>
<p>But the first bullet failed to kill the man. Instead, Hamed fell to
the ground shrieking and thrashing, the blood spreading over his clothes
in spurts. Lawrence fired again, but was so shaky he only struck Hamed’s
wrist. “He went on calling out, less loudly, now lying with his feet
towards me, and I leant forward and shot him for the last time in the
thick of his neck under the jaw. His body shivered a little.”</p>
<p>It was the first man Lawrence had ever killed. Stumbling his way back
up to his perch among the rocks, he immediately lay down and fell into
exhausted sleep. By dawn, he was so ill that the others had to hoist him
into his saddle to continue the journey.</p>
<p>AARON AARONSOHN HAD arrived—or at least he was sufficiently
susceptible to kind words and respectful audiences to imagine so.</p>
<p>By the middle of March 1917, the man who had so long wandered the
bureaucratic wilderness of Cairo was finally being recognized by the
British intelligence community as one of their most important assets,
the conduit for a fount of information beginning to come in from
enemy-held Palestine. With tremendous satisfaction, the agronomist could
note the steadily expanding number of British officers who had once
given him short shrift, whether due to his temperament or his outsider
status or his Jewishness—perhaps in some cases a combination of all
three—but now sought his counsel, extending invitations for him to join
their dinner table.</p>
<p>This breakthrough had begun in earnest in mid-February, when he had
gone on board the spy ship Managem for yet another attempt to reach
Athlit. This time, the weather had cooperated, and they had picked up
one of Aaronsohn’s confederates, a man named Liova Schneersohn. Best of
all, the spy ring had been alerted to the British effort to make contact
by the couriers left ashore on previous runs, and Schneersohn brought on
board with him a trove of recent intelligence reports in a waterproof
satchel.</p>
<p>“We left at once,” the agronomist noted in his diary of February 20,
“happy.”</p>
<p>With that run, the link to the Athlit spy ring was finally firmly
established, and in the weeks and months ahead, couriers on board the
British coastal runners would collect a steady supply of reports on
conditions inside Palestine. The British could only be amazed at the
wealth of intelligence they received—as well as rueful at not having
availed themselves of the opportunity first presented a year and a half
earlier. With the Jewish spy ring gradually expanded to some two dozen
operatives throughout Palestine, and many of them holding prominent
positions in the local government, the Athlit ring detailed everything
from the location of Turkish military supply depots, to the precise
number of railway troop cars passing through the crucial junction town
of Afuleh; in this last effort, they were helped by an enterprising
agent who thought to open a refreshment stand alongside the train
station. For their part, the Jewish conspirators finally gave their ring
a code name, NILI, the Hebrew acronym for a passage from the Book of
Samuel, Nezah Israel Lo Ieshaker, or “the Eternal One of Israel does not
lie or relent.” That was all a bit too exotic for the British, who
continued to officially refer to Aaronsohn’s spy ring simply as
“Organization A.”</p>
<p>Given the fast-approaching timetable for Murray’s offensive in
Palestine, just as welcomed was the detailed analysis of the region that
Aaronsohn provided the British. A nineteen-page paper on the Palestinian
economy authored by William Ormsby-Gore in February drew heavily on the
agronomist’s earlier reports; Reginald Wingate was so impressed, he sent
a copy on to the new foreign secretary in London, Arthur Balfour.
Aaronsohn was also enlisted to make additions and corrections to The
Military Handbook for South Syria, a primer British officers would carry
with them as they advanced beyond Gaza. When that primer began
circulating in mid-March, its breadth of information was quickly noted,
as well as its source. As Aaronsohn wrote in his diary on March 20, a
military acquaintance had “congratulated me on my contribution to the
Handbook, saying that everybody was talking about it at headquarters. It
must be so, as [his official liaison, William Edmonds] told me today
they were receiving reports from everywhere saying how delighted
everybody was with my work.”</p>
<p>Naturally, Aaronsohn was also pursuing his own agenda in all this.
Part of that agenda was very overt—certainly, he’d never hidden the fact
that his overriding motive for joining with the British was out of
concern for the future of the Jewish settlers in Palestine—but some of
it was a good deal subtler. In The Military Handbook for South Syria,
for example, Aaronsohn included a detailed description of most all the
Jewish settlements in Palestine, along with their adjacent Arab
villages. In the quick character sketches he provided of the leaders in
these communities was an element of score-settling, his allies
invariably described as “intelligent” and “trustworthy,” his enemies as
just the opposite. Thus Aaronsohn’s chief Arab nemesis in Athlit was
marked down as an “extortionate parasite” and “fanatical Moslem,” while
a Jewish banker in Tiberias with whom he’d crossed swords was skewered
for his “Oriental standard of honesty.” The effect was to both
preemptively steer the British toward his Zionist allies and to lend the
Jewish settlers in Palestine a prominence far beyond the tiny fraction
of the population they actually composed. Perhaps most crucially,
Aaronsohn painted a very rosy picture of the reception General Murray
was likely to receive once he’d broken through at Gaza and advanced into
the Palestine heartland. “The attitude of the Jews all the world over
towards the British regime is easy to be guessed,” he wrote in late
February. “Palestine under the British flag will draw steadily Jewish
idealism, Jewish intelligence, Jewish capital and Jewish masses.”</p>
<p>The agronomist surely knew that very little of this assertion was
necessarily true. Among international Jewry, Zionism remained a deeply
divisive issue, and within Palestine the vast majority of Jews continued
to be either loyal to the Ottoman regime or resolutely apolitical. That
didn’t matter; Aaronsohn’s audience was British military and political
leaders, and extremely rare is the war-planning staff that can resist a
tale which has its own soldiers being greeted as liberating heroes.</p>
<p>So greatly had Aaronsohn’s star risen that on March 26 he was granted
a prize that had eluded him since arriving in Egypt: an audience with
General Gilbert Clayton. This meeting went so well it was followed by a
far lengthier one a week later. In the interim, General Murray had at
last launched his Palestine offensive, and first reports told of a
smashing success—“a great victory over the Turks,” Aaronsohn noted in
his diary on March 29. On April 3, Clayton called the agronomist back to
his office to hear his thoughts on how the British might drive home
their advantage in the next stage of battle.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn was rarely bashful about sharing his opinions, and he
wasn’t that day with Gilbert Clayton. After asserting that at no time in
history had Jerusalem been captured from the south or west, he advocated
that the British army continue a northern sweep along the coastal plain,
and then hook back to fall upon the city from the north. In contrast to
other armchair generals, of course, Aaronsohn could draw upon his
encyclopedic knowledge of the land—its trails and terrain and water
sources—to lend weight to his advocacy. As he noted in his diary that
night, “General Clayton listened to me with much interest. I left him
dreaming over the map after an invitation to come back and see him every
time I had such good suggestions to make.” In the same entry, the
scientist allowed himself a moment of exultation. “I have succeeded in
making the right party understand that it is useless to beat around the
bush. Palestine is a ripe fruit. A good shaking‑up and it will fall in
our hands.”</p>
<p>Left unclear was just who this “our” might consist of: the Allies,
the British, or the Zionists alone.</p>
<p>AT SUNSET ON March 28, Lawrence and his vanguard of rebel fighters
climbed to the top of a rocky crag to peer over its edge. In the flat
valley below, perhaps three miles away, lay Aba el Naam, a principal
station and watering depot for the Hejaz Railway. In the failing light,
Lawrence watched the Turkish army garrison—some four hundred soldiers,
by best estimate—go through their evening drills.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Turks made frequent nighttime patrols around
the perimeters of their railway garrisons to compensate for their sense
of isolation. This was unpleasant news to Lawrence; his vanguard
consisted of a mere thirty men, and they needed to rest after their
three-day journey from Wadi Ais. A solution came to him. At nightfall,
several men were dispatched to sneak close to the station and fire a few
random shots in its direction. As Lawrence recounted, “The enemy,
thinking it a prelude to attack, stood- to in their trenches all night,
while we were comfortably sleeping.”</p>
<p>It was a sleep Lawrence probably required more than his companions,
for he was still recovering from the dysentery and fever that had held
him in its grip for weeks. He also needed to have both his wits and
strength about him for the assault he was planning on Aba el Naam.</p>
<p>After the ghastly events in Wadi Kitan, he had forced himself on,
increasingly ill, until finally they made Abdullah’s camp at Wadi Ais on
the morning of March 15. There, after a brief conference with Abdullah
in which he explained the need to immediately move against the railway,
Lawrence excused himself to take a brief rest. Instead, he lay in his
tent, racked with malaria, for the next ten days.</p>
<p>Adding to Lawrence’s torment during those long days had been his
knowledge of what was happening—or rather, not happening—during his
incapacitation. Given Abdullah’s reputation for indolence, Lawrence had
figured all along that if any determined action were to be taken against
the railroad, he would need to lead it himself—and this calculation
proved prescient. In the infrequent moments when he was able to rally
enough to venture outside his tent, Lawrence observed that Abdullah’s
camp had retained its climate of frivolity and relaxation just as
before, that nothing like a military mobilization was taking place.</p>
<p>What’s more, it became clear that Lawrence wasn’t particularly
welcome in Wadi Ais. Among Abdullah’s inner coterie was a barely
concealed distrust, even an animosity, toward the visiting British
officer that their chief did little to dispel. For his part, Lawrence’s
once rather favorable opinion of Abdullah, tepid though it had been,
steadily hardened into a contemptuous dislike: “His casual attractive
fits of arbitrariness now seemed feeble tyranny disguised as whims,” he
wrote, “his friendliness became caprice, his good humor [a] love of
pleasure.… Even his simplicity appeared false upon experience, and
inherited religious prejudice was allowed rule over the keenness of his
mind because it was less trouble to him than uncharted thought.”</p>
<p>On March 25, at last sufficiently recovered from his illness to
function, Lawrence strode into Abdullah’s tent to announce he would lead
an attack against the railway himself. That announcement was warmly
received, for Abdullah “graciously permitted anything not calling
directly upon his own energies.” By approaching some of the sheikhs in
Wadi Ais whom Lawrence perceived as actual warriors, he quickly won
commitments for a tribally mixed assault party of some eight hundred men
to fall upon the isolated train depot at Aba el Naam. The next morning,
he set off ahead with his small vanguard to assess the site and work up
a battle plan.</p>
<p>All during the day of March 29, Lawrence and his advance team moved
into attack positions in the hills around the station, while closely
watching the Turkish soldiers go about their routine: forming up for
roll call, falling out for meals, performing desultory drills, still
oblivious to the trap being set for them. Best yet, from Lawrence’s
perspective, was the train that chugged into view that morning and came
to a halt at Aba el Naam; destroying a Turkish train would be a great
bonus to the operation, and he fervently hoped it did not push off again
before the main assault party arrived.</p>
<p>That force began to drift in that evening, but to Lawrence’s dismay,
it was not the eight hundred fighters he had been promised, but more on
the order of three hundred. It forced him to quickly recalibrate what
might be accomplished in the morning.</p>
<p>Throughout that night, Lawrence made his preparations. Small groups
of fighters were dispatched to secrete themselves in the heights
surrounding the station; once the assault got under way, the Turks would
find themselves caught in an amphitheater of gunfire. One demolition
team was sent to place a mine on the railway north of Aba el Naam, while
he personally placed the one to the south, the first time he would put
Herbert Garland’s mine-laying tutorials to the personal test. It was
also here where he set his sole machine gun, in a concealed gully a mere
four hundred yards from the track. With Medina forty miles to the south,
Lawrence figured this would be the direction the Turkish garrison would
take in retreat—or conversely, the direction from which any
reinforcements might come—and the machine gun with its three-man crew
would turn the open ground into a slaughter yard. So exhaustive and
time-consuming were his preparations that when finally the attack was
launched shortly before dawn, Lawrence had to be shaken out of a fitful
slumber to observe it.</p>
<p>It started very well. The Arabs’ two mountain guns, or pack
howitzers, had been tucked into hillside crevices with commanding views
of the depot, and they opened up with devastating effect. Within
moments, two of the station’s stone buildings had taken direct hits, the
depot’s water tank had been punctured, and a train wagon parked on a
siding set aflame. Simultaneously, the Turks scrambling for their
trenches were discovering there was little protection to be found; with
bullets coming in from three sides, they were just as likely to be shot
in the back as in the front.</p>
<p>Amid the chaos, the train that had come into Aba el Naam the day
before began to move off, attempting an escape south. As Lawrence
watched in satisfaction, it tripped the mine he’d set, producing a puff
of sand and scattered steel—but then, nothing. For what must have seemed
an eternity, he waited for the machine-gun team hidden in the gully to
open up, but all remained silent. Instead, the Turkish train engineers
were able to dismount in perfect safety, slowly joist the engine’s
damaged front wheels back on the track, then gather steam for a limping
journey on to Medina.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Lawrence called off the assault. Turkish
reinforcements would surely soon be on their way, and those soldiers
below who had survived the initial melee were now protected by the cloak
of thick black smoke that enveloped the station from the burning wagon.
The only alternative to withdrawal, Lawrence reasoned, was a frontal
assault against the Turkish trenches, an option likely to be as
murderously futile at Aba el Naam as it had been on a thousand other
battlefields.</p>
<p>Measured in terms of casualties—the way military men usually gauge
such things—the engagement had been a great success. At the cost of a
single fighter wounded, the Arabs had killed or wounded some seventy
Turkish soldiers, taken another thirty prisoner, and undoubtedly
disrupted traffic on the Hejaz Railway for some days to come. For
Lawrence, though, it was a hollow victory, diminished by the knowledge
of what might have been. If the machine-gun crew in the gulley had acted
as planned, the hobbled train would have been shot to pieces rather than
allowed to escape; as Lawrence soon learned, the crew had simply
abandoned their position once the fighting around the depot started,
either because they wanted to witness it or because they felt exposed
being so far removed from the main rebel force. Similarly, if he’d had
the eight hundred fighters promised back in Wadi Ais rather than the
three hundred who had shown up, the outnumbered garrison in Aba el Naam
could have been annihilated. Denied the unqualified victory he’d hoped
for, Lawrence would only say about the battle that “we did not wholly
fail.”</p>
<p>Surely deepening his disappointment was what the experience said of
the Arab Revolt going forward. In urging Faisal to make for Syria by
concentrating his attacks inland, Lawrence had vaguely talked of
overrunning the isolated Turkish garrisons along the railway as they
went. But what were the real prospects of that happening given the
example of Aba el Naam? If the Arabs couldn’t sufficiently organize to
defeat four hundred backline guardpost soldiers in a skirmish where they
had commanded the heights and enjoyed complete surprise, what would
happen when they were confronted by the several-thousand-man garrisons
that awaited in the larger rail towns in southern Syria—let alone the
ten thousand frontline troops who stood at their backs in Medina?</p>
<p>Yet, in a different way, the engagement at Aba el Naam proved
something of a seminal event for Lawrence, as it lent proof to an
idea—perhaps more accurately, a constellation of ideas—he had begun to
formulate. By his own account, that process had started during those
long days of illness spent lying in his tent at Wadi Ais.</p>
<p>At its core was the question of what the Arab rebels were truly
capable of in the face of the Turkish army. Virtually to a man, the
British advisors sent to the Hejaz since the beginning of the revolt
were derisive of the Arabs’ fighting abilities. Indeed, Lawrence had
shared something of that opinion with his observation that a single
company of entrenched Turkish soldiers could put the entire rebel army
to flight.</p>
<p>The problem with this view, Lawrence was coming to realize, was not
just that it held the Arabs to European standards of warfare—standards
totally unsuited to the Arabian terrain—but that it rather blinded those
advisors to see the tremendous advantage that terrain might offer. In a
word, space. Some j257,000 square miles of open space.</p>
<p>“And how would the Turks defend all that?” Lawrence asked. “No doubt
by a trenchline across the bottom if we came like an army with banners,
but suppose we were (as we might be) an influence, an idea, a thing
intangible, invulnerable, without front or back, drifting about like a
gas? … Most wars were wars of contact, both forces striving into touch
to avoid tactical surprise. Ours should be a war of detachment. We were
to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a vast unknown desert, not
disclosing ourselves till we attacked.”</p>
<p>If alien to many in the hidebound British military structure of the
day, none of this was truly revolutionary, but rather the classic
strategy-by-default of weaker military forces throughout history. After
all, if one is outmanned or outgunned, charging straight at the enemy
only ensures getting to the cemetery or surrender table that much
quicker. What was unique was how Lawrence saw its application to the
Arabian war.</p>
<p>Ever since his arrival, the overriding goal of both the Arab rebels
and their British advisors had been capturing Medina, the event that
would rid Arabia of four centuries of Turkish rule and allow the theater
of operations to move north. The current campaign to prevent the Turks’
withdrawal from Medina had thrown a new complication into the mix, but
the end goal hadn’t changed; for Briton and Arab alike, seeing the
Ottoman flag come down from Islam’s second holiest city was the prize
that would open the road to others. What Lawrence now saw was that
Medina should not be taken, either by force or by surrender: “The Turk
was harmless there. In prison in Egypt he would cost us food and guards.
We wanted him to stay at Medina, and every other distant place, in the
largest numbers.”</p>
<p>The proper strategy going forward, in Lawrence’s new estimation, was
to keep the Turks settled into Medina almost indefinitely. To do that,
it didn’t mean shutting down the Hejaz Railway altogether, as the
British were hoping to do, but rather allowing that supply line to
operate at just enough capacity to keep the Turkish garrison on life
support. Sustained enough to survive, but too weak to withdraw or go on
the offensive, that garrison would then essentially become
prisoners—even better than prisoners because the burden of sustaining
them would continue to fall on the enemy.</p>
<p>This concept didn’t apply only to Medina. Once that garrison was
rendered impotent, Lawrence foresaw, the Arabs could take their
rebellion into Syria and pursue the same strategy there: ceding the
larger garrison towns to the Turks while they roamed the countryside
striking at soft spots of their choosing, constantly disrupting the
enemy supply lines until the Turkish presence was limited to an atoll of
armed islands amid an Arab-liberated sea.</p>
<p>Once this idea of the Arab force “drifting about like a gas” came to
him, it was probably inevitable that Lawrence’s thoughts turned to that
place on the map that had been a gnawing concern for over two months:
Aqaba.</p>
<p>The tricky thing about Aqaba from the Arab perspective was that while
it presented a trap should they go into it as junior partners of the
British and French, the port was still vital for them if they hoped to
push into Syria. If somehow the mountain range that lay between Aqaba
and the Hejaz Railway could be wrested from the Turks, the Arabs would
then enjoy a mere sixty-mile-long supply line for their operations in
southern Syria, rather than the three-hundred-mile line from Wejh. But
how to clear those mountains, and how to do it without being beholden to
the British and French?</p>
<p>In pondering this dilemma earlier, Lawrence had settled on a rather
obvious and conventional solution, pointing out that as the Arab forces
moved north along the rail line, clearing the towns of Turks as they
went, the Turkish garrison in the side spur of Aqaba would eventually be
cut off; an Arab side force could then be sent over the mountains from
the inland side to capture it. Now, however, with the “drifting like
gas” concept to mind, he began formulating a far more audacious scheme.
Taking Aqaba didn’t have to wait until the Turks’ inland garrison towns
were taken, nor did it have to wait until the Arabs advanced north en
masse. Instead, Lawrence believed that a very small and mobile force of
Arab fighters might pass undetected all the way to the vicinity of Maan,
the inland terminus of the road to Aqaba, and there conduct a series of
seemingly random diversionary raids. With the Turks put on high alert by
these attacks—which meant standing to in their defensive positions—and
unsure where they might come next, the Arab force could then cross the
mountains and fall on Aqaba from the landward side before anyone in the
Turkish military leadership had time to react.</p>
<p>It was with these ideas in mind—still embryonic, certainly the
staggering logistical issues involved not yet worked out—that Lawrence
returned to Abdullah’s camp from his railway raiding forays in early
April. There he found a plaintive note from Faisal awaiting him.</p>
<p>“I was very sorry to hear that you were ill,” Faisal wrote in awkward
French. “I hope that you are already better and that you would like to
come back to us in a short time, as soon as possible. Your presence with
me is very indispensable, in view of urgency of questions and the pace
of affairs.” He closed in a somewhat whiny tone. “It was not at all your
promise to stay there so long. So I hope that you will return here as
soon as you receive this letter.”</p>
<p>As quickly as he could manage, Lawrence set out for Wejh.</p>
