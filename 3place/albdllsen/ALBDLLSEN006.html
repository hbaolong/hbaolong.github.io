<h4 id="chapter-4-to-the-last-million">Chapter 4 To the Last
Million</h4>
<p>Sir: I have the honor to report that conditions are going from bad to
worse here.</p>
<p>U.S. CONSUL GENERAL IN BEIRUT, STANLEY HOLLIS, TO SECRETARY OF STATE,
NOVEMBER 9, 1914</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 7, 1914, Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener,
Britain’s newly appointed secretary of state for war, was called to his
first cabinet meeting with Prime Minister Herbert Asquith and other
senior ministers.</p>
<p>Kitchener’s selection for the War Office had come about almost by
chance. On a brief visit back to England from his post as British agent
to Egypt, he was just boarding a ship to leave when war was declared.
Asquith, figuring that appointing Britain’s most famous military hero to
lead that effort might have a salutary effect on public morale, had
skipped over a long line of prospective candidates in giving the
position to Kitchener.</p>
<p>At the time, boosting public morale seemed among the least of the
prime minister’s concerns. In Britain, as elsewhere across Europe, war
euphoria had gripped the populace, with great crowds gathering in public
squares to cheer the news. Most predictions were that this war would be
a very quick one, and in villages and cities across the continent,
reserve soldiers, anxious to escape the drudgery of factory and farm,
despaired at not being called up before this grand adventure passed them
by. The situation was slightly different in Britain, one of the few
European nations without mandatory conscription, but within days of the
war declaration the British government was already contemplating a halt
in recruitment, adjudging that it already had more volunteers signed up
than it could ever possibly need.</p>
<p>But in that summer of 1914, most everyone was overlooking a crucial
detail: that the weapons of war had changed so radically over the
previous forty years as to render the established notions of its conduct
obsolete. It was rather simple stuff, easy to miss—the machine gun; the
long-range artillery shell; barbed wire—but because of this oversight,
Europe was about to tumble into an altogether different conflict from
what most imagined.</p>
<p>One reason Europe’s imperial powers missed the warning signs was that
these new instruments of war had previously been employed almost
exclusively against those who didn’t have them—specifically, those
non-Europeans who attempted to resist their imperial reach. In such
situations, the new weapons had allowed for a lopsided slaughter not
seen since the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and more than any other
single factor had accounted for the dramatic expansion of Europe’s
colonial empires into Asia and Africa in the latter part of the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>It is perversely appropriate, then, that among the few people who did
appreciate this new face of war and the problems it would pose was the
man who had officiated over more of these one-sided battlefield
slaughters than probably anyone else alive: Lord Kitchener. At the
battle of Omdurman in the Sudan in 1898, Kitchener had trained his Maxim
machine guns on horsemen charging with spears; at a cost of forty-seven
British army dead, he had killed ten thousand of the enemy in a single
morning. But what would happen when the other side had Maxims too?
Kitchener had a pretty good idea. At that cabinet meeting on August 7,
where some other ministers imagined a conflict lasting months or even
weeks, the newly appointed war secretary predicted years. “It will not
end,” he told his colleagues, “until we have plumbed our manpower to the
last million.”</p>
<p>Naturally, these were words few wanted to hear, let alone pay heed
to. And so as if imagining that nothing had really changed since the
last great bout of European wars in Napoleonic times, the Scottish
Highlanders gathered up their bagpipes and kilts, the French cuirassiers
and Austrian lancers donned their armor breastplates and plumed helmets
and, to the accompaniment of buglers and drums, marched gaily off to
battle, not realizing until too late that their Europe was now to become
an abattoir, a slaughtering pen into which, over the next four years,
some ten million soldiers, along with an estimated six million
civilians, would be hurried forward to their deaths.</p>
<p>One would need to return to the Dark Ages or the depredations of
Genghis Khan to find a war as devastating. By point of comparison, over
the previous century, during which it had expanded its empire to five
continents, the British Empire had been involved in some forty different
conflicts around the globe—colonial insurrections mostly, but including
the Crimean and Boer wars—and had lost some forty thousand soldiers in
the process. Over the next four years, it would lose over twenty times
that number. In the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, France
had suffered an estimated 270,000 battlefield casualties; in the present
war, it was to surpass that number in the first three weeks. In this
conflict, Germany would see 13 percent of its military-age male
population killed, Serbia 15 percent of its total population, while in
just a two-year span, 1913 to 1915, the life expectancy of a French male
would drop from fifty years to twenty-seven. So inured would the
architects of the carnage become to such statistics that at the launch
of his 1916 Somme offensive, British general Douglas Haig could look
over the first day’s casualty rolls—with fifty-eight thousand Allied
soldiers dead or wounded, it remains the bloodiest single day in the
history of the English-speaking world—and judge that the numbers “cannot
be considered severe.”</p>
<p>The effect of all this on the collective European psyche would be
utterly profound. Initial euphoria would give way to shock, shock to
horror, and then, as the killing dragged on with no end in sight, horror
to a kind of benumbed despair.</p>
<p>In the process, though, the European public would come to question
some of the most basic assumptions about their societies. Among the
things they would realize was that, stripped of all its high-minded
justifications and rhetoric, at its core this war had many of the
trappings of an extended family feud, a chance for Europe’s kings and
emperors—many of them related by blood—to act out old grievances and
personal slights atop the heaped bodies of their loyal subjects. In
turn, Europe’s imperial structure had fostered a culture of decrepit
military elites—aristocrats and aging war heroes and palace
sycophants—whose sheer incompetence on the battlefield, as well as
callousness toward those dying for them, was matched only by that of
their rivals. Indeed, in looking at the conduct of the war and the
almost preternatural idiocy displayed by all the competing powers,
perhaps its most remarkable feature is that anyone finally won at
all.</p>
<p>In the end, the European public would look back on their war
celebrations of August 1914 as if from a different age entirely, a death
dance performed by gullible primitives. It would also give rise to an
exquisite irony. In this titanic struggle waged for empire—protecting
it, expanding it, chipping away at others’—four of the six great
imperial powers of Europe would disappear completely, while the two
survivors, Britain and France, would be so shattered as to never fully
recover. Into the breach would come two dueling totalitarian
ideologies—communism and fascism—as well as a new imperial power—the
United States—that, given the bad name its predecessors had attached to
the label, would forever protest its innocence of being one.</p>
<p>But in August 1914 all this was in the future. For now, Europe was
gripped by a kind of giddy relief that the years of posturing were over,
that der Tag had finally arrived.</p>
<p>In this, the Lawrence family of Oxford was in no way immune. Within
days of the war’s declaration, Frank Lawrence, the second youngest and
most military-minded of the five Lawrence boys, was given his commission
as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Gloucester Battalion. In India, Will
Lawrence swiftly made plans to return to England in order to enlist,
while Bob, the eldest, signed on with the Royal Army Medical Corps. By
month’s end, that left just fourteen-year-old Arnold and
twenty-six-year-old “Ned” at home.</p>
<p>For T. E. Lawrence, this home stay was imposed by forces beyond his
control. Although the Ottoman Empire had not joined in the August rush
to war, expectations in London were that it soon might—and probably on
the side of the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. If that
came to pass, the mapping expedition of southern Palestine that Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley had recently participated in could be of great
military importance. Under orders from Kitchener himself, the two young
archaeologists were told to forgo any thought of enlisting until they
had completed their report. So as others his age trooped off to boot
camp that August, Lawrence shuttled between his Polstead Road cottage
and the archives of the Ashmolean Museum, feverishly putting the final
touches on The Wilderness of Zin.</p>
<p>If Lawrence was mindful of the report’s significance, his comparative
lassitude infected him with a growing sense of desperation. In early
September, he and Woolley contacted Stewart Newcombe, their supervisor
on the Palestine expedition and now a ranking officer in military
intelligence, seeking his help in landing positions there. Newcombe
advised patience. Should Turkey enter the war on Germany’s side, he
explained, their services as Near East experts would be urgently needed,
and arranging their appointment would only be hampered if in the
meantime they threw themselves into the maw of the military
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>That advice didn’t sit at all well with Lawrence. Surely adding to
his gloom was that in those opening days the war did seem headed for the
early conclusion that most predicted—except with the wrong side
winning.</p>
<p>In provoking the conflict, German strategy had been predicated on an
extremely bold, even reckless scheme. The plan was to only lightly
defend its eastern frontier and cede ground against Russia’s advancing
armies, while launching a massive offensive against the French and
British armies to the west in hopes of knocking those countries out of
the war before they could fully mobilize. With that front thus closed
down, the Germans could then turn their full attention to the
Russians.</p>
<p>By the beginning of September, it appeared as if the Germans might
succeed beyond their wildest dreams. On the Western Front, their armies
had swept through neutral Belgium and then turned south, scattering the
disorganized French and British forces before them. They now stood on
the banks of the Marne River, just thirty miles from Paris. The surprise
had come on the Eastern Front, where rather than simply employing
defensive stalling tactics as planned, a vastly outnumbered German army
had leapt to the attack; it had already annihilated one blundering
Russian invasion force, and was about to destroy another. “Home by
Christmas” suddenly seemed a conservative slogan, and for the soldiers
of the Triple Entente—Great Britain, France, and Russia—a haunting
one.</p>
<p>But then in the second week of September the tide abruptly turned. In
the engagement that would become known as the “miracle of the Marne,”
the British and French checked the German advance and began slowly to
push them back through the French countryside. This war was not going to
be the “short, cleansing thunderstorm” the German chancellor had so
confidently predicted; instead, after six weeks of combat, as many as
half a million men were already dead, and stalemate was setting in.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, to be holed up in the leafy confines of Oxford at such
a time, poring over a half-inch-to-the-mile map of an empty desert a
thousand miles from the nearest battlefield, must have felt a terribly
painful academic exercise. What’s more, he surely reasoned, the reversal
of fortunes in France meant his purgatory was likely to continue; if the
Turks hadn’t come into the war when it appeared Germany was running the
table, why do so now when the Germans were retreating?</p>
<p>“I am writing a learned work on Moses and his wanderings,” he acidly
wrote to a friend in Lebanon on September 18. “I have a horrible fear
that the Turks do not intend to go to war.”</p>
<p>IF LAWRENCE HADN’T appreciated the warning signs in the run‑up to
war, William Yale, overseeing the construction of the Standard Oil road
in southern Palestine, missed them completely. In fact, just as a
telegram delivered to an Oklahoma oilfield had presaged his being
dispatched to the Near East, so a second telegram to his remote
construction camp in the Palestinian desert nearly a year later informed
him of the war’s outbreak.</p>
<p>With all work on the road project brought to an immediate stop, Yale
hurried back to Jerusalem that August. He found a city in tumult. Among
the sizable expatriate community of Europeans and Americans, most
families were already packing up for the journey home. Leaving ahead of
them in answer to their governments’ general mobilization calls were the
French and German men of fighting age (the British wouldn’t initiate a
draft until early 1916).</p>
<p>“We went down to the railroad station to see them off,” Yale
remembered. “Like young collegians on their way to a football game they
shouted, cheered, and sang. As the train for Jaffa pulled out of the
yards, the Germans in one car sang enthusiastically Deutschland über
alles, while the Frenchmen in another car sang just as lustily, La
Marseillaise. The friends of yesterday were off on their great
adventure.”</p>
<p>In contrast to the frenzied activity around him, the American oilman
suddenly found he had little to do. With the United States staying out
of the war, Socony headquarters ordered Yale to remain in Palestine,
figuring he could at least watch over the company’s soon-to-arrive oil
drilling equipment until they decided on their next move. But even this
caretaker task was soon mooted. Invoking a state-of-emergency decree,
the Ottoman government requisitioned the incoming fleet of Standard Oil
trucks as soon as they were unloaded at the Jaffa docks. Shortly
afterward, the British navy stopped the freighter bringing most of
Socony’s piping and drilling machinery to Palestine and diverted all of
it to an impoundment lot in Egypt.</p>
<p>With the community of foreigners in Jerusalem now reduced to a
handful, Yale passed his time that late summer by playing tennis and
canasta, and engaging in long, obsessive discussions with his fellow
expatriates about what might come next in world events. A special focus
of these discussions was trying to read the tea leaves of regional
politics, sifting for clues as to whether or not the Young Turks in
Constantinople would take their country into the fray. For a young man
given to action, this imposed quietude was maddening, and Yale grew
increasingly anxious for something to do.</p>
<p>But the old admonishment to be careful what you wish for soon found
application when Yale was asked to play minder to a dozen unruly
American oil workers. The men, most from Texas or Oklahoma, had been
part of the intended work crew at the Kornub drilling site, and had been
aboard the same freighter that the British diverted to Egypt. With time
on their hands and money in their pockets, the oil workers proceeded to
cut such a scandalous swath through the streets of Cairo—no mean feat in
that libertine city—that the local Socony office had sent telegrams to
headquarters urging that they be returned to the United States. Instead,
26 Broadway decided to forward the men to Yale, perhaps hoping that a
stint in the Holy Land might serve to reacquaint them with their
Christian virtues.</p>
<p>If so, that hope was misplaced. If anything, the opportunity to tread
the land of Jesus seemed to spur the oilmen to even more outrageous
public behavior. In observing this, as well as their office’s rapidly
dwindling cash reserves—the war in Europe had brought a temporary halt
to international money transfers—Yale and his supervisor decided that a
neat solution to both problems lay in withholding the men’s pay and
instead placing them on five-dollar-a-week allowances. Sensitive to the
workers’ disappointment with this arrangement, on allowance day Yale
took to disbursing the money with one hand while holding a loaded
six-shooter in the other.</p>
<p>But his troublesome charges also served a very useful function. In
constant contact with Jerusalem’s most unsavory residents, the oilmen
were like the proverbial canaries in a coal mine, the first recipients
of every dark rumor floating through the city—and with the spreading war
in Europe, those rumors were turning exceedingly dark. It was precisely
at tense times like these that the rich mosaic of the Ottoman world—a
mosaic composed of a myriad of religious and tribal and ethnic
groups—could quite easily become a grim counterimage of itself, a place
where the various communities drew protectively inward, and where
ancient feuds and suspicions and jealousies exploded into violence. Not
surprisingly, this danger was greatest in the most “mixed” corners of
the empire, and with its mélange of Arab and Turk and Armenian, of
Muslim and Jew and Christian, all living cheek by jowl, there was no
more cosmopolitan city in the Near East than Jerusalem.</p>
<p>By the end of August, stories were floating in from the countryside
of Muslim vigilante armies forming, of Jews and Armenians being
attacked, and while most of these tales proved false, they fed the
ever-thickening air of tension. In the Old City, shopkeepers were
raising prices and hoarding their wares, ever more convinced that
Constantinople would soon enter the war. What was still not at all
clear, though, was which side it might join, and another fault line
formed between those hoping for the Triple Entente of Britain, France,
and Russia and those desiring the Central Powers of Germany and
Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>On September 8, the sense of menace took more personal form for Yale
and the other foreigners remaining in the city. Taking advantage of the
chaos in Europe, the Young Turk government announced an end to the
Capitulations, the humiliating concessions extracted by Western powers
over the previous four centuries that largely exempted foreigners from
Ottoman law. Yale noticed the effect immediately. Previously obsequious
local officials became haughty, demanding. On Jerusalem’s narrow
sidewalks, residents no longer automatically stepped to the street at
the approach of a Western “white man.” On one occasion, when Yale and a
couple of other foreign residents were visiting the Mount of Olives, a
group of young boys pelted them with stones. To Yale, Jerusalem more and
more felt like a pile of tinder in search of a match.</p>
<p>FOR OTHERS IN Palestine, the revoking of the Capitulations took on
far more ominous import than a little stone-throwing. Left particularly
vulnerable were the tens of thousands of Jewish émigrés who had come
into the region over the previous thirty years.</p>
<p>Most had come in two successive waves. The first, of which the
Aaronsohn family had been a part, had been an exodus out of central and
southeastern Europe in the 1880s. This was followed by a second aliyah
(literally “ascent” in Hebrew) in the early 1900s, mainly composed of
Russian Jews escaping a new round of czarist political persecution and
state-sanctioned pogroms. Although culturally these groups were very
different—most of the first-wave émigrés tended to be religious and
socially conservative, while many in the second were secular
socialists—what they shared was that under the terms of the
Capitulations many remained citizens of their birthplace.</p>
<p>That arrangement had historically worked to the benefit of both the
émigrés and the Western powers. With it, the Jews had recourse to the
protection of their former homelands, just as those foreign governments
were given legal pretext to meddle in Ottoman affairs under the guise of
tending to their transplanted citizens. While this bizarre system gave
rise to a number of paradoxes, surely none was more grotesque than the
spectacle of czarist Russia stoutly defending the rights and well-being
of its Jewish citizens in Palestine, while systematically brutalizing
that same religious minority inside Russia. With the revoking of the
Capitulations, all this was coming to an end. Additionally, if Turkey
did finally join the war, at least one portion of this Jewish community
was likely headed for an unpleasant future; with thousands of the
first-wave émigrés still holding Austro-Hungarian passports, and
thousands from the second holding Russian ones, one group or the other
was going to end up being classified as “belligerent nationals.” As had
already happened to countless innocent civilians across the breadth of
Europe, the losers in this lottery could then be subject to deportation
or internment.</p>
<p>In all this, most of the residents of Zichron Yaakov, including the
Aaronsohn family, actually benefited from a different paradox. These
Romanian Jews had come to Palestine after being effectively barred from
citizenship in an independent Romania. By default, they thus remained
citizens of Romania’s preindependence master, namely the Ottoman Empire.
Unlike other Jews in Palestine, then, Aaron Aaronsohn and other Zichron
residents could look upon the revocation of the Capitulations with a
measure of equanimity, perhaps even a touch of schadenfreude.</p>
<p>That sentiment was extremely short-lived, however, for the very next
day, September 9, Constantinople announced a general mobilization of its
armed forces. Under the curious rationale that this was necessary to
“preserve Ottoman neutrality,” the mobilization called for male citizens
between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five to show up for military
conscription. Worse, this edict extended to most all
citizens—traditionally, Jews and a number of Christian sects had been
exempt—and the regime was further rescinding the age-old system whereby
the affluent could escape service by payment of a special bedel, or
tax.</p>
<p>Aaron Aaronsohn was sufficiently acquainted with the Ottoman way of
governance to know that this last clause meant nothing of the sort—it
simply meant that obtaining an exemption now would entail paying more
bribes to more officials—but the mobilization deeply worried the
agronomist on a broader level. As recent events in Europe illustrated,
an army called up almost always meant an army going to war; once the
machinery and bureaucracy of war had been set in motion and popular
hysteria properly ginned up, there was simply no easy way to shut it all
down again. Ever since the outbreak of the European conflict, Aaronsohn
had heard a rash of conflicting rumors from his friends in the Ottoman
military and political hierarchy over what Constantinople might do, and
this cloudiness was exacerbated by the vague picture to be gleaned of
what was occurring in Europe. In the face of such uncertainty,
Aaronsohn, like most of the Jewish residents of Palestine, simply clung
to the hope that reason might yet prevail and the war be avoided.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears his apprehensions had less to do with which
side Turkey might join than with the act of joining itself. Part of this
may have stemmed from a common denominator in European wars going back
to the Crusades—no matter who won or lost, the one fairly reliable
constant was that Jews somewhere were going to suffer—but it was also
born of a particular feature of Ottoman war-making. In the event of
conflict, both military and civilian authorities would suddenly have
license to embark on a wholesale requisitioning spree—“pillaging” might
be a more apt term—as they grabbed up whatever they deemed necessary for
the war effort. While this campaign was sure to affect Arab and Jewish
villages alike, it would naturally be more zealous in those modern or
prosperous places that had more to offer—places like Zichron Yaakov and
Athlit, for example. Already by mid-September 1914, the Aaronsohn family
and their neighbors in Zichron began hiding away whatever they had of
value, braced for the ruinous arrival of the requisition officer.</p>
<p>ON THE AFTERNOON of September 4, 1914, Curt Prüfer was in a room of
the Hotel Germania in Constantinople meeting with a burly, blond-haired
German man in his thirties named Robert Mors. Until recently, Mors had
been a policeman in the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria, and their
main topic of conversation that afternoon was how they might destroy the
British administration in Egypt through a campaign of bombings,
assassinations, and Islamic insurrection. The two men even bandied about
ideas on how best to blow up the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>Their meeting was remarkable on both a personal and political level.
Just a month earlier, Prüfer had been scratching out a modest living
delivering lectures on Oriental languages in Munich; now he was a key
operative in an intelligence mission so secretive that its existence was
known to probably fewer than three dozen people in the world. That’s
because the ultimate purpose of this mission was to bring the
still-neutral Ottoman Empire into the war, and among those with no
inkling of Prüfer’s activities in Constantinople could be included
virtually the entire Young Turk political leadership. Credit for this
peculiar set of circumstances belonged to Prüfer’s old mentor, Max von
Oppenheim, and to one of the stranger diplomatic accords ever put to
paper.</p>
<p>As the war clouds had thickened over Europe during that long summer
of 1914, a clear majority of the thirty or so senior members of the
Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), the junta that controlled the
empire, wanted to stay clear of the coming European firestorm. A small
faction, however, had energetically sought to form an alliance with the
Triple Entente, while another, led by thirty-two-year-old war minister
Enver Pasha, tried to do the same with the Central Powers. Enver won
out. In a case of exquisitely poor timing, he had signed a mutual
defense treaty with Germany on the afternoon of August 2, just hours
before Germany declared war on Russia and the conflict began.</p>
<p>Except, as it turned out, Enver Pasha had conducted these
negotiations without ever consulting most of his CUP colleagues; indeed,
at the time of the accord’s signing, only three or four of Enver’s
closest confederates were aware of it. Even more astounding, Enver
continued to withhold this information from the rest of the Turkish
government throughout the first weeks of the war. As the young war
minister told his impatient German allies, he needed more time to lay
the groundwork before dropping this little surprise on his ministerial
colleagues. To that end, a precipitating event, something that might
turn both the nation and the rest of the Young Turk leadership away from
the prevailing neutralist sentiment, could prove very handy.</p>
<p>Enver had come to the right people for, as neutral Belgium had
recently learned, precipitating events was something of a German
specialty. To help out his secret Turkish ally, Kaiser Wilhelm II could
think of no better guide than Max von Oppenheim and his preachings on
pan-Islamic revolt. If Islamic insurrection could be fostered in the
various Muslim territories controlled by the British—and most especially
in that land Britain had stolen from Constantinople, Egypt—surely it
would be obvious to both the leadership and populace of the Ottoman
Empire that they needed to come into the war.</p>
<p>But if the ultimate goal was to bring Turkey in, at least some in the
German high command that autumn saw an upside to it remaining neutral
just a bit longer. So long as it did, the Ottoman Empire could serve as
the ideal launch pad for German destabilization efforts, a kind of
Trojan horse from which to carry out attacks on the surrounding British
colonies with very little risk of repercussion. That neutrality could
also serve as a convenient shield while Germany laid the groundwork for
the most important military operation to be conducted in the region, an
assault on the Suez Canal. In mid-August, the kaiser signed a secret
directive calling for the creation of the Nachrichtenstelle für den
Orient (Intelligence Bureau for the East), to be based in Constantinople
and to serve as the central clearinghouse for Germany’s subversion
campaigns in the Near East. The director of that bureau was to be Max
von Oppenheim. Among Oppenheim’s first acts upon assuming the post was
to put out an offer of employment to his former protégé, Curt
Prüfer.</p>
<p>Oppenheim’s confidence in his apprentice was certainly deserved. No
sooner had he checked into the Hotel Germania on the evening of
September 3 than Prüfer set to work. Early the next morning, he met with
one of Enver Pasha’s chief lieutenants, a young Turkish staff officer
named Omar Fawzi Bey, and together they worked up a whole list of
prospective projects to strike at British Egypt: hiring Bedouin
tribesmen to attack isolated British garrisons along the Suez Canal;
sneaking so-called komitadji units of underground fighters into the
country to foment Islamic insurrection; launching a terror campaign of
targeted assassinations and indiscriminate bombings. Even if he remained
dubious of some of the more novel schemes put forward by Fawzi Bey and
his confederates—one involved scuttling a cement-laden freighter at the
narrowest point of the Suez Canal—Prüfer appreciated the enthusiasm and
creative thinking that went into them.</p>
<p>When not plotting with Fawzi Bey or Sheikh Shawish, an Egyptian
firebrand hated and feared by the British, Prüfer was in regular
conference with the four or five other Nachrichtenstelle operatives who
had already arrived in the Turkish capital. At these meetings, often
also attended by the three or four German embassy officials clued to
Oppenheim’s scheme, ambitious plans were laid for sabotage and
subversion campaigns throughout the Muslim world: in Egypt, in Russian
Central Asia, in Afghanistan, even as far away as India.</p>
<p>It was at the conclusion of one such meeting on the afternoon of
September 7 that Prüfer was brought before the man who had made it all
possible, Minister of War Enver Pasha. Small, extravagantly uniformed,
and extraordinarily handsome—“the handsomest man in the Turkish army,”
the New York Times gushed—Enver had piercing dark eyes and a dramatic
mustache, upturned and waxed in the Prussian style. That was not
coincidence. As the military liaison to Germany in the early 1910s, he
had quickly assumed the manner and style of its military elite, and now
fancied himself more Prussian than the Prussians. Although Curt Prüfer
was never much given to psychoanalysis, the few words he scribbled into
his diary that night in describing the thirty-two-year-old Enver—by four
months Prüfer’s junior—offer one of the more incisive portraits of the
man who was to practically single-handedly destroy the Ottoman Empire:
“A man of stone. A face immovable, well-formed, beautiful in the
feminine sense. Groomed to the point of foppishness. Along with a streak
of shocking hardness. ‘We can be more cruel than the British.’ The man
wants something, but the something does not come.”</p>
<p>But of all the meetings he attended and the schemes he heard in those
first few days in Constantinople, Prüfer was most intrigued by the
unique situation facing Robert Mors, the cashiered Alexandria policeman.
Mors had happened to be out of Egypt when the war began and, not
surprisingly in light of his German citizenship, been summarily
dismissed from his post by the British authorities. But in one of those
quaint touches of “gentlemen’s war” that still typified World War I in
its early days, the British were granting Mors safe passage back to
Alexandria in order to collect his stranded family. To Prüfer, this made
Mors the ideal conduit for launching his subversion campaign. Given his
status as a privileged European, Mors was also far more likely than a
local to be able to secrete contraband articles among his personal
possessions—and here Prüfer was thinking of bomb-making components—and
smuggle them into the country. To impress the former policeman on the
importance of his mission, Prüfer arranged an audience with Enver Pasha
the day before Mors was to sail for Alexandria with bombing detonators
hidden in his luggage. The Turkish war minister warmly thanked Mors for
his service.</p>
<p>Even though the British quickly suspected some sort of pact had been
struck between Enver and the German high command, they remained utterly
in the dark as to the specifics. Their apprehensions grew, however, once
Prüfer and Oppenheim’s other intelligence bureau operatives began
showing up in Constantinople. “Even without [Turkey joining the] war,”
British ambassador Louis Mallet cabled to London on September 15,
“German machinations are so various here that I should not be surprised
if they managed to engineer some scheme against the Canal, either by
means of a so-called neutral ship from [the] Syrian coast, or by agents
on land.”</p>
<p>Against this were the constant assurances the British ambassador was
given by Ottoman government officials. From the sultan and prime
minister on down, Mallet heard the steady refrain that Turkey had no
militarist intentions and only wished to stay out of the European
conflict. While certainly some of these protesting senior officials were
dissembling, others were not; incredibly, many still had no inkling of
Enver’s August 2 accord with Germany.</p>
<p>Mallet took his suspicions directly to Enver on October 5. Along with
his other talents, however, Enver was a skilled liar. Not only did he
deny any sinister intent behind the troop movements in Palestine but,
according to Mallet, “laughed at [the] idea of individual Germans
undertaking irresponsible enterprises against [the] Canal or
elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Except the Turkish war minister was about to get caught out. A few
days prior to Mallet’s meeting with Enver, Robert Mors had been arrested
at Alexandria harbor with his bombing detonators. Facing possible
execution under Egypt’s martial law statutes, he soon told his
interrogators all he knew of the German-Turkish plots against Egypt, as
well as of his best-wishes audience with Enver Pasha on the eve of his
voyage. Mors was especially expansive when it came to his relationship
with Omar Fawzi Bey and Curt Prüfer. For Prüfer, the most damning part
came when the foiled smuggler readily admitted that the detonators in
his luggage had been intended for use with bombs being manufactured in
Egypt. When asked how he knew that, Mors replied, “Because once I found
Sheikh Shawish sitting with Dr. Prüfer in the latter’s room at the Hotel
Germania. They were copying in Arabic a recipe for making bombs.… [It]
contained directions, a list of the component chemicals, and a sketch of
a bomb in the right-hand bottom corner.”</p>
<p>The British in Cairo showed considerable forbearance in the Mors
incident, presumably in hopes that the more moderate elements in the
Constantinople regime might yet rein in the adventurist Enver and keep
Turkey out of the war. At his hastily held court-martial, Mors was
sentenced to life in prison, while all mention of his meeting with the
Turkish war minister was withheld from the public record. Cairo
authorities were less forgiving of the man who had once lived in their
midst. For his central role in the Mors affair, Curt Prüfer was to soon
have a British bounty on his head.</p>
<p>THE OLD War Office Building at the corner of Horse Guards Avenue and
Whitehall in central London is an imposing neo-baroque structure, a
five-story monolith of white Portland stone with thirty-foot-high
cupolas at each of its corners. Inside, it has the feel of a
particularly elegant gentlemen’s club, with marble staircases linking
its floors, great crystal chandeliers, and mosaic-tiled hallways. In the
more select of its nearly one thousand rooms, the walls are oak-paneled
with niches cut out for marble fireplaces. In autumn 1914, this building
was headquarters to Great Britain’s Imperial General Staff, those
seniormost officers tasked with overseeing their nation’s war effort. It
was also to this building that T. E. Lawrence, at last done with his
Wilderness of Zin report, was dispatched in mid-October to take up his
new position as a civilian cartographer in the General Staff’s
Geographical Section.</p>
<p>By then, “Section” was rapidly becoming a misnomer, for within a week
of Lawrence’s arrival, the last of the office’s military cartographers
was shipped off to the battlefront in France, leaving just him and his
immediate supervisor behind. Thus Lawrence quickly found himself doing
the work of a half dozen men: organizing the various war-theater maps,
adding new details as reports came in from the front, briefing senior
commanders on those maps’ salient features.</p>
<p>One might imagine that for a young man—Lawrence had just turned
twenty-six—to be suddenly thrust into the very nerve center of his
nation’s military command, to be in daily conference with generals and
admirals, would be a heady experience. But one would imagine wrong. To
the contrary, Lawrence seemed to take a decidedly jaundiced view of his
new surroundings, its denizens fresh grist for his mordant wit.</p>
<p>Part of his disdain may have stemmed from how much military culture
resembled that of the English public school system of which he was a
product: the endless bowing and scraping to authority; the rigidly
defined hierarchical structure as denoted by the special ties worn by
upperclassmen and prefects in the schools, by the number of hash marks
and pips on coatsleeves in the military; the special privileges bestowed
or denied as a result. As Lawrence quipped to a friend shortly after
arriving at the War Office, it appeared that the truly grand staircases
of the building were reserved for the exclusive use of field marshals
and “charwomen,” or cleaning ladies.</p>
<p>His lack of awe probably also derived from the overall caliber of the
building’s occupants. With most active-service military officers now in
France, the General Staff had been filled out with men brought up from
the reserves or mustered out of retirement, and even to Lawrence’s
untrained eye it was clear many hadn’t a clue of what they were supposed
to be doing. As in any institution, this sense of inadequacy was often
masked by an aura of extreme self-importance: at the War Office, freshly
minted colonels and generals were forever striding briskly down
hallways, memos in hand, or calling urgent staff meetings, or sending
one of the Boy Scout messenger boys up to the Geographical Section for
the latest map of Battlefield X, to be supplied ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>One by-product of this climate of puffery, however, was that it led
directly to Lawrence’s being inducted into the military, the
circumstances of which provided him with one of his favorite later
anecdotes.</p>
<p>Shortly after starting at the General Staff, he was ushered into the
august presence of General Henry Rawlinson. Rawlinson was about to leave
London to take up command of British forces in Belgium, and Lawrence had
been summoned to brief him on the newly updated Belgian field maps.
Except, according to Lawrence, Rawlinson went apoplectic at the sight of
his civilian dress, and bellowed, “I want to talk to an officer!” Since
the Geographical Section now consisted of just two men, Lawrence was
immediately bundled off to the Army and Navy Store, there to get himself
fitted out as a second lieutenant, while the paperwork for his
“commission” was hastily drawn up. The uniform wouldn’t truly solve the
problem, however; in the years ahead, Lawrence’s disregard for military
protocol, manifested both in a usually unkempt appearance and a relaxed
manner that bordered on the insolent, would drive his superior officers
to distraction time and again.</p>
<p>But if he was now in the military, however haphazardly, Lawrence’s
work at the War Office was bringing him no closer to the arena of
action. Since he fell below the minimum height standard of the British
army, he needed a situation where his expertise might outweigh his
physical shortcomings, and the only possible scenario meeting that
criterion was, once again, if Turkey came into the war.</p>
<p>This seemed more unlikely than ever. With the war settling into
paralysis—on the Western Front both sides were now frantically throwing
up trenchworks—where was the incentive for anyone else to wade into the
morass? “Turkey seems at last to have made up its mind to lie down and
be at peace with all the world,” Lawrence lamented to Winifred Fontana,
the wife of the British consul in Aleppo, on October 19. “I’m sorry,
because I wanted to root them out of Syria, and now their blight will be
more enduring than ever.”</p>
<p>But just two weeks later, his fears were put to rest. On November 2,
with Enver Pasha’s faction having finally won out, Turkey came into the
war on the side of Germany and Austria-Hungary.</p>
<p>For Lawrence, more good news soon followed. In the wake of Turkey’s
declaration, Stewart Newcombe was recalled from the French theater to
head up a new military intelligence unit in Cairo, the city slated as
headquarters for Britain’s war effort in the Near Eastern theater. It
was to be a very small unit, just a handful of men with extensive
knowledge of the region, and Newcombe immediately tapped both Lawrence
and Leonard Woolley to join it.</p>
<p>“Now it’s Cairo,” Lawrence wrote Winifred Fontana again in early
December, clearly in a much-improved mood. “All goes well except among
the Turks.”</p>
<p>IT WAS A land denuded. Although Aaron Aaronsohn had been prepared for
the onslaught of the requisition squads following the Ottomans’ entry
into the war, their depredations went beyond even his worst imaginings.
Across Syria, crops, farm vehicles, and draft animals were seized and
hauled away in the name of wartime exigency, their hapless owners
indemnified with hastily scribbled receipts that all knew would never be
redeemed. And just as the agronomist had feared, the pillaging appeared
particularly uninhibited in the Jewish colonies. At Zichron Yaakov,
according to biographer Ronald Florence, “Aaron Aaronsohn watched
Turkish soldiers systematically take clothing (including women’s
lingerie and baby clothes), carts, wagons, water buffaloes, agricultural
implements, tools, firearms, medical instruments (including those for
obstetrics), microscopes, and the fence posts and barbed wire needed to
protect the fields.” Eventually, most of Zichron’s irrigation piping
would go as well, leaving its fields and orchards to wilt from lack of
water. Aaronsohn was only able to avoid a similar despoiling of the
agricultural research station at Athlit through the determined
intercession of local Ottoman officials and the posting of armed
guards.</p>
<p>The agronomist might have resigned himself to the idea that these
plunderings were part of the inevitable sacrifices to be made in wartime
if they actually served the war effort; instead, they were gutting Syria
from within, doing the enemy’s work for them. In his travels over the
coming months, he would see great stacks of confiscated wheat rotting in
government storage yards, an uncovered mound of three thousand sacks of
sugar in the city of Nablus left to dissolve in the winter rains, “to
the delight of the street boys.” To repair a bridge in Beersheva,
Aaronsohn later reported, engineers had put in a request for twenty-four
barrels of cement. Instead, the zealous requisition squads had gathered
up four hundred barrels, all of which “were destroyed by rain before
being used, with the result that the bridge remained without
repairs.”</p>
<p>While it could be argued that the Jewish colonies suffered
disproportionately in these seizures simply because they had more and
better matériel to take, the actions of the Constantinople regime
certainly added to their misfortunes. Within days of Turkey joining
Germany and Austria-Hungary in the conflict, the caliph, the supreme
religious authority in the Sunni Muslim world, issued a fatwa that this
was now a holy war, that in protection of the faith it was the sacred
duty of every Muslim to join the jihad against Islam’s foreign,
Christian enemies. Although this call to jihad lost some of its luster
among those who noticed that the Ottomans had just joined an alliance
with two Christian and imperial powers, it did have the intended effect
of inflaming the Muslim masses; in towns and cities across the empire,
young Muslim men took to the streets and military induction centers to
declare their willingness to fight and die for the cause. Of course,
this fatwa had the simultaneous effect of alarming the empire’s
Christian and Jewish populations, compelling the governor of Syria to
issue a hasty explanation that the jihad only applied to its foreign
enemies.</p>
<p>If that clarification mollified many in the Christian community,
which comprised nearly 30 percent of the empire’s inhabitants, its
calming effect was far more limited in the Jewish community. Part of
their continuing fear surely derived from their small numbers—“small”
having an unfortunate tendency to translate as “vulnerable” in
wartime—but it also stemmed from the contentious position the Jewish
colonists occupied in the social fabric of Palestine.</p>
<p>Some of those problems the colonists had brought on themselves. In
Zichron Yaakov, as in most other “first-wave” Jewish settlements, the
émigrés had gradually built their way to prosperity through adopting
Palestine’s long-established fellaheen system, employing landless or
tenant Arab peasants to perform much of the manual labor. By contrast,
many of the socialist-minded Russian émigrés of the second aliyah
denounced this arrangement as exploitive and feudalistic; in pursuit of
creating “the new Jewish man,” they propounded, all work should be done
by Jews themselves. For the unfortunate fellaheen, it wasn’t hard to see
the downside to both these approaches, one perpetuating the plantation
system that had kept their families impoverished and disenfranchised for
generations, the other denying them employment ostensibly for their own
good—or, as Aaron Aaronsohn would caustically put it, “generously
forbidding them to work at all.”</p>
<p>Exacerbating the friction was that in the eyes of many of their
Muslim Arab neighbors, the Jews were a dhimmi, or inferior people. Even
for those Palestinians whose lives were unaffected by the Jewish influx,
perhaps actually improved by it, the image of Jews living better than
themselves—to say nothing of the further level of privilege many enjoyed
courtesy of the Capitulations—added another layer of bitterness.
Beginning with the first aliyah, there had been sporadic attacks on
Jewish colonies by local villagers, and the occasional murder of a
colonist caught out alone on the road.</p>
<p>But the colonists hadn’t accepted this situation passively. In the
early 1900s, several Jewish paramilitary forces, most notably the
Gideonites and Bar Giora, were formed on settlements particularly hard
hit by marauders, and they began contracting their protection services
out to other colonies. It didn’t take a clairvoyant to see where this
would lead; before long, the Gideonites and Bar Giora were conducting
punitive raids against Arab villages they deemed as hostile or
responsible for prior attacks, ensuring new rounds of retaliatory
attacks by the Arabs.</p>
<p>Taken together, then, by the autumn of 1914 the Jewish colonists in
Palestine understandably felt nervous. Between the jihad fatwa and the
requisition seizures and the revoking of the Capitulations, the most
pressing question was just how much the local Ottoman officials—many not
partial to the Jews at the best of times—would come to their aid if
matters turned truly nasty.</p>
<p>In Zichron Yaakov, an answer to this question soon began to form, and
it was not a comforting one. Aaron Aaronsohn’s younger brother Alex had
been caught up in the army’s conscription sweeps of September, and when
he finally managed to finagle a medical release and return home two
months later it was with disturbing news: after the call to jihad, Alex
and all the other Jews and Christians in his conscription unit had been
stripped of their weapons and consigned to labor battalions. Then, in
late November, came a new edict demanding that privately owned firearms
be handed in to the authorities, resulting in another army requisition
squad descending on Zichron Yaakov. When the residents professed to have
no weapons—they had taken the precaution of burying them in a nearby
field—the Turkish commander grabbed up four men, including the luckless
Alex Aaronsohn, and hauled them off to Nablus to be beaten until they
remembered otherwise. It wasn’t until the same commander allegedly
threatened to turn his attentions to the young women of Zichron that the
weapons were finally surrendered, and Alex and the others released.</p>
<p>For many of the Jewish émigrés across Palestine, it was all beginning
to feel like a prelude to the pogroms they thought they had left behind
in Europe, especially when in early December the Young Turk who governed
Palestine, Djemal Pasha, announced that the citizens of “belligerent
nations” must either take Ottoman citizenship or face deportation. This
naturally most directly affected the Russian Jewish minority, and within
days, some eight hundred Russian Jews were rounded up in Jaffa for
expulsion. The docks of that city were soon crowded with other Jews
trying to get out on any ship that would take them, and to any safe
haven that might accept them.</p>
<p>A number of Zichron Yaakov residents joined in this exodus, but the
Aaronsohn family was not among them. Even though the family patriarch,
sixty-six-year-old Ephraim, was still alive, it was really his eldest
son who now decided important matters in the family, and for Aaron
Aaronsohn there was no decision to be made. Palestine was their home.
Moreover, it was the site of all his scientific work, and of the dream
that sustained him. “I am always watched,” he wrote one of his American
benefactors in mid-January, “and well-intentioned friends are strongly
advising me to leave the country as soon as I have the opportunity. But
I have no intention to run away—yet.” Still, Aaronsohn’s faith in the
state had been deeply shaken. “As a staunch supporter of the Turks from
olden days, I feel sorry and ashamed for all I have heard and seen in
these last weeks.”</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of December 15, 1914, a French steamer six days out of
Marseilles approached the low, hazy horizon of northern Egypt. Among
those on board was T. E. Lawrence, come to take up his new position with
the military intelligence unit of the British Egyptian Expeditionary
Force in Cairo. Accompanying him was the man who would be his immediate
supervisor in that post, Captain Stewart Newcombe.</p>
<p>Cairo in 1914 was a city of less than one million, a place of wide
boulevards and beautiful parks, of elegant riverfront promenades along
the Nile. At that time, the Great Pyramids of Giza were some ten miles
beyond the city’s reach, their hard-stone crowns visible from the
rooftop of most any tall building downtown.</p>
<p>But even more than its physical appearance, what made 1914 Cairo such
a beguiling place was its status as one of the world’s greatest
crossroads, its layer upon layer of history going back over a
millennium. The Old City remained a labyrinthine maze of alleyways and
tiny shops, old palaces and mosques tucked into its back streets, and
even if the occupying British had managed to erect a European veneer
here and there in their thirty years of rule, the Egyptian capital
remained a deeply exotic and mysterious place, unknowable in the way of
all truly grand cities.</p>
<p>This was certainly part of what had entranced Lawrence upon his first
visit to Cairo three years earlier. But if the city was physically
little changed from 1911, in other ways 1914 Cairo was virtually
unrecognizable. Since the outbreak of war in Europe, it had become a
transit point for hundreds of thousands of territorial troops from
India, Australia, and New Zealand passing through the Suez Canal on
their way to the Western Front. As happens with RandandandandR stops in
most every war, these soldiers had quickly turned much of Cairo into a
vast red-light district, places where most anything and anyone could be
purchased for the right price.</p>
<p>That situation, scandalous to conservative Cairenes, had only grown
worse in the days since Turkey joined the war. With a Turkish assault on
the Suez Canal now all but certain—indeed, the governor of Syria, Djemal
Pasha, had publicly vowed as much at the end of November—tens of
thousands of British and territorial troops were now being held back in
Egypt to meet the threat. This was rapidly turning Cairo into a military
encampment in its own right, its downtown streets awash with strutting
officers and columns of marching foot soldiers. If the Cairenes had
never been thrilled about the presence of their British imperial
overseers at the best of times—and they hadn’t—they regarded them now
with a seething and growing antipathy.</p>
<p>To provide office space and lodging for the officers tasked to manage
this burgeoning military force, the British quickly took over most of
the city’s finer hotels. One of these was the Savoy, an eclectic blend
of British Victorian and Indian Moghul architectures near the east bank
of the Nile. Upon their arrival, the staff of Stewart Newcombe’s new
military intelligence unit set up shop in three large rooms on an upper
floor of the Savoy, while taking bedrooms at the Grand Continental Hotel
immediately adjacent.</p>
<p>Initially the unit consisted of just five men, and was more likely to
be taken for some kind of Oxbridge peer-review panel than a group
dedicated to the black arts of intelligence and counterespionage. Along
with the two Oxford-educated archaeologists, Lawrence and Woolley, were
two young aristocrats, George Lloyd and Aubrey Herbert, both sitting
members of Parliament. Soon after arriving in Cairo, Lawrence wrote to
his old friend Edward Leeds at the Ashmolean Museum to describe their
various functions: “Woolley looks after personnel, is sweet to callers
in many tongues, and keeps lists of persons useful or objectionable. One
[George] Lloyd, who is an M.P. of sorts and otherwise not bad, looks
after Mesopotamia, and Aubrey Herbert, who is a quaint person, looks
after Turkish politics. Between them in their spare time they locate the
Turkish army, which is a job calling for magnifiers.” As for his own
duties, Lawrence wrote, “I am bottle-washer and office boy
pencil-sharpener and pen wiper.”</p>
<p>In truth, Lawrence was far more than that. Because he had briefly
worked in the Geographical Section of the London War Office, he was put
in charge of the unit’s mapping room. As all braced for the coming Suez
attack, this was an assignment that kept him working from early morning
to late at night.</p>
<p>If he was finally a bit closer to the action, one thing that hadn’t
changed was Lawrence’s gift for irritating his military superiors.
Within weeks of his arrival a number of senior officers began grumbling
about the slight young man in the Savoy mapping room, both his cheeky
manner and unkempt appearance. But Lawrence’s talent for annoying was
not limited to his appearance and speech; he was also a very skilled
writer. As the intelligence unit’s acknowledged “Syria hand,” in early
1915 he set to work on a long report describing the topography, culture,
and ethnic divisions of that broad swath of the Ottoman Empire. Not for
Lawrence the tentative, modifier-laden language that, then as now,
tended to lard such background reports; instead, in “Syria: The Raw
Material” he laid out his opinion of its various cities and peoples in
refreshingly blunt—at times comically arrogant—prose. Typical was his
withering appraisal of Jerusalem: “Jerusalem is a dirty town which all
Semitic religions have made holy.… In it the united forces of the past
are so strong that the city fails to have a present; its people, with
the rarest exceptions, are characterless as hotel servants, living on
the crowd of visitors passing through.”</p>
<p>The remarkable utility of that first sentence—its ability in a mere
twelve words to denigrate one of the world’s most fabled cities, three
major religions, and to offend the Christian sensibilities of every
high-ranking British diplomat or general who might read it—was surely
the source of considerable pride to Lawrence.</p>
<p>WILLIAM YALE INDULGED in portentous language as he described the mood
aboard the refugee-packed freighter that carried him from Beirut to
Alexandria in mid-November 1914. Having just escaped the dreadful
wartime pall that had descended over Ottoman Palestine, he wrote that
“to everyone on board ship, Egypt was a place of refuge where there was
nothing to fear. It never occurred to me then that a different kind of
terror would soon engulf the land of the Pharaohs.”</p>
<p>Rather than pillaging soldiers or religion-crazed vigilantes,
however, the terror to which Yale referred took the form of tens of
thousands of transiting Australian soldiers who, having been released
after weeks spent on board crammed transport ships from their homeland,
were rapidly transforming ancient Cairo into a raucous whiskey-soaked
bordello. Even his experience with the boisterous American roustabouts
in Jerusalem couldn’t prepare Yale, ever the puritanical Yankee at
heart, for the scenes he saw constantly playing out in the city’s
streets: the fights, the pawings of passing women, the soldiers blacked
out in gutters from drink. In his estimation, such outrageous
carryings-on could only tarnish British prestige in the eyes of the
locals, “for the Egyptians, like many others in the Near East, looked
upon the British as a coldly superior race. These hot-blooded, lusty,
undisciplined Australians of 1914 … were a revelation.”</p>
<p>From his perch in Jerusalem, Yale had been eyewitness to the Ottoman
Empire’s long, slow tumble into the war. On November 3, as word of the
Turkish war declaration spread, crowds of Muslim men had begun gathering
in the Old City, their numbers constantly swelled by others pouring in
from the outlying villages. That evening, Yale and other Western
expatriates watched from an upper balcony of the Grand New Hotel as an
unending stream of young men passed through the Old City’s Jaffa Gate on
their way to Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem’s holiest Muslim shrine, beating
their chests and chanting their readiness to die for the faith.</p>
<p>“[It] sent shivers up and down our spines,” he would recall.
“Consciously or unconsciously, we sensed in every fiber of our being,
that these men were stirred with that same religious fervor with which,
some 800 years before on this self-same street, their ancestors had
matched forces with our Crusading forebears.”</p>
<p>It had also helped convince Yale and his supervisor, A. G. Dana, that
it was time to get out. Three days later they were at Jaffa harbor
negotiating their way on board a refugee-laden freighter. By a
circuitous route aboard other overladen ships, they finally reached
Egypt, and the new terror of carousing Australian soldiers, on November
17.</p>
<p>Their arrival was noted by an alert British intelligence officer. On
the Alexandria dock, Yale was escorted to an office to be debriefed on
all he had seen or heard in Palestine in recent days. To his
questioner’s pleasant surprise, it seemed the American oilman had been
very observant during his flight from Syria, and was able to provide
estimates of Turkish troop strengths in a number of towns and cities in
southern Palestine. He also confirmed that German officers were
everywhere in the region and that along with truck convoys of war
matériel and battalions of marching Turkish soldiers, the Germans
appeared to be heading south.</p>
<p>In Cairo, Yale was forced to wait while his bosses back at 26
Broadway decided what to do with him and the other Socony employees
scattered across the Middle East. From the standpoint of Standard’s
Kornub project, the Ottoman entry into the war only made a bad situation
worse. With the British and French navies now imposing a blockade of
their new enemy’s coastline—and in the Ottoman era this meant the entire
eastern Mediterranean shoreline, from Palestine to the southeastern
corner of Europe—there certainly would be no early opportunity to
develop that concession. The fundamental question facing Socony, then,
was whether to retreat from the Middle East for the time being and bring
their people home, or to keep them in place in hopes of some
hard-to-foresee improvement in the near future.</p>
<p>Yale was still waiting for the answer when, one day in late December,
there came a knock on the door of his room at the National Hotel. He
didn’t immediately recognize his visitor—the man was young and in a
British army uniform, two characteristics that described much of Cairo
just then—but there was something in the gaze of his piercing blue eyes
that stirred a memory.</p>
<p>“Hello, Yale,” the visitor said with an amused, lopsided grin. “You
don’t remember me, do you? I’m Lawrence of British Intelligence. We met
at Beersheva last January.”</p>
<p>Yale remembered then, and no doubt also remembered the delight with
which the cocky young archaeologist had set out to demolish his
“playboy” cover story.</p>
<p>As quickly became evident, this meeting, too, was to be an
interrogation of sorts. Even before entering the war, Constantinople had
been moving troops down into Palestine in obvious preparation for an
attack on the Suez Canal, and that pace was now accelerating. Lawrence,
having himself arrived in Egypt just days earlier, had thought to scan
the registry logs of incoming foreigners and had come upon Yale’s name.
He now wanted to learn everything there was to know about the road that
Standard Oil had been building below Hebron: its precise route, its
composition and drainage, whether it could be used by the Turks to bring
heavy weaponry south.</p>
<p>“When he secured all the information I had,” Yale recalled, “he began
talking about the situation in Palestine. I soon discovered that,
although I had just arrived from there, this officer knew far more than
I did. It was then that I began to learn of the efficiency of the
British Intelligence Service and to understand something of the ability
of young Lawrence.”</p>
<p>That evening, Lawrence wrote up his findings for his superiors at
military intelligence. It made for rather unpleasant reading. While the
Hebron-Beersheva road was not finished, Socony had completed work on the
most difficult stretch, the descent through the Judean hills to the edge
of the desert. Perhaps drawing on his engineering experience at the
Panama Canal, William Yale had made sure the road was cut with a gradual
enough gradient to allow for heavy-truck traffic—one so gradual, in
fact, that the roadbed could easily be converted to a railroad. Until
then, British war planners had assumed that any significant
Turkish-German advance toward the Suez from southern Palestine would be
largely confined to the established narrow pathway close to the
Mediterranean shoreline. With their Hebron road, Standard Oil and
William Yale had inadvertently provided the Turks with the capability of
expanding their field of operations by some thirty miles.</p>
<p>ON THE MORNING of November 21, 1914, less than three weeks after
Turkey entered World War I, Ahmed Djemal Pasha, one of the “Three
Pashas” triumvirate that now ruled the Ottoman Empire, left
Constantinople to take up his new dual positions as commander of the
Fourth Army and governor of Syria. His true authority was far greater
than the titles suggested: supreme military and political ruler of all
Ottoman lands south of Anatolia and west of Iraq, an area that comprised
over half of the empire’s remaining total landmass. As befitting that
authority, his first order of business was to lead the Turkish army to
the Suez Canal and strike at the heart of British Egypt.</p>
<p>Over the next three years, Djemal Pasha would come to thoroughly
dominate life in Syria, his actions credited with causing much of what
was to come. In his dual capacities as a military and political leader,
he would also come into regular contact with—and at varying times employ
the services of—three very different men: Aaron Aaronsohn, Curt Prüfer,
and William Yale.</p>
<p>In some respects, the short, powerfully built Djemal seemed an
unlikely choice for such a position. Born in 1872 to a low-level Ottoman
officer, he had sought a career in the military as a matter of course,
and risen unremarkably through the ranks before throwing his lot in with
the reformist-minded conspirators of the Committee of Union and Progress
in the early 1900s. A fairly obscure figure until the 1913 coup that
enabled the CUP to rule by fiat, Ahmed Djemal was then appointed
military governor of Constantinople. Less than a year later, with the
emergence of the so-called Three Pashas triumvirate, the
forty-two-year-old officer became one of the three public faces of the
shadowy committee that controlled the empire.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly one reason for Djemal’s elevation was his personal
magnetism. As Henry Morgenthau, the American ambassador to Turkey, would
recall, “Whenever he shook your hand, gripping you with a vise-like
grasp and looking at you with those roving, penetrating eyes, the man’s
personal force became impressive.” This does not imply that Morgenthau
at all cared for Djemal, instead seeing in his charisma a malevolent
force best rendered in overheated, racialist-tinged prose. “His eyes
were black and piercing, their sharpness, the rapidity and keenness with
which they darted from one object to another, taking in apparently
everything with a few lightning-like glances, signalized cunning,
remorselessness, and selfishness to an extreme degree. Even his laugh,
which disclosed all his white teeth, was unpleasant and
animal-like.”</p>
<p>A more nuanced view was offered by another American who had extensive
dealings with Djemal during the war. Howard Bliss, the president of the
Syrian Protestant College in Beirut, would recall observing the governor
at an afternoon tea party in wartime Beirut, a social event to which
even the expatriate citizens of Turkey’s foes had been invited. Djemal
was “gay, debonair, interested, wandering about with his hands in his
pockets, or lounging on the arm of a big chair, the other arm of which
was occupied by a charming European lady.” Noting the governor’s love of
children and overt displays of affection toward his wife—“unusual among
Orientals”—Bliss saw in Djemal a man caught between an overwhelming
vanity and a core kindness, “a character teeming with conflicting
elements: cruelty and clemency, firmness and caprice, ideality [sic] and
hedonism, self-seeking and patriotism.”</p>
<p>These conflicting personality traits mirrored Djemal’s political
views. Indeed, he seemed to embody the internal contradictions that lay
at the heart of the Young Turk movement, caught as it was between West
and East, modernity and tradition, between awed admiration of the
European powers and bitter resentment. A devout Muslim who embraced the
jihadist credo of pan-Islam, Djemal had also been one of the most vocal
Young Turk leaders in advocating that the empire’s ethnic and religious
minorities be given full civil rights. An aesthete who loved European
music and literature, and who enjoyed nothing more than practicing his
French in the expatriate salons of Constantinople, he also exhorted his
countrymen to purge their nation of corrupting Western influence.
Dreaming of a Turkish and Islamic renaissance that would return the
Ottoman Empire to its ancient splendor, he was at heart a technocrat,
intent on pulling his nation into modernity through the building of
roads and railways and schools.</p>
<p>“He had the ambition of creating a Syria which he could exhibit with
pride to an admiring Europe,” Bliss wrote. “I think it would not be
unfair to call him a personal patriot. He was inordinately vain. He
wanted a reformed Turkey, but he wanted pre-eminently to be known as the
Chief Reformer.”</p>
<p>To try to achieve that, Djemal would rely on the skills he had honed
in his fitful rise through the treacherous political currents of the
CUP, the ability to turn in the blink of an eye from graciousness to
ferocity, an adroitness with both the peace offering and the dagger. As
those who lived in the lands encompassed by his new southern posting
were soon to discover, Djemal Pasha could be wonderfully solicitous in
trying to keep potential enemies on his side, but if flattery and
sinecures and promises didn’t appear to do the trick, he was perfectly
willing to go with the old standbys of exile and execution.</p>
<p>As his train pulled out of Constantinople’s Haidar Pasha station, the
challenges of reforming Syria were soon to be put in stark relief—the
initial hurdle Djemal faced was just getting there. The first part of
that long journey went smoothly enough, a pleasant two-day train ride
through central Anatolia, but the troubles started when they reached the
depot town of Mustafa Bey, at the northern edge of the Gulf of
Alexandretta. There, embarrassed officials informed Djemal that the
onward track to the city of Alexandretta (modern-day Iskenderun) had
recently washed out in a number of places. The pasha switched to an
automobile, but only briefly; after mere yards on the main “highway” to
Alexandretta, the car was mired up to its wheel wells in mud. A
four-hour horseback ride finally brought Djemal to the seaside town of
Dort Yol. There, a tiny two-man tramcar was found that, certain
optimists believed, might be light enough to navigate the damaged
coastal rail line and finally deliver the pasha and his chief of staff
to Alexandretta, ten miles farther along.</p>
<p>“Never shall I forget this journey by trolley on the slippery track,”
Djemal wrote. “More than once we went in danger of our lives as in
pouring rain we passed along the coast, which was watched by enemy
ships.… We reached Alexandretta after a journey during which the trolley
passed over rails which, in some places, hung suspended over a void for
fifteen to twenty metres, and in others were under water.”</p>
<p>But more bad news awaited the pasha. The road onward to Aleppo, the
only link between Alexandretta and the interior of northern Syria, was
now impassable—although “impassable” was perhaps an understatement.
Repairs had been started on the road some time earlier, but had
progressed no further than removing all its crowning stones. Those
stones now lay in high stacks along either side, leaving the road to
form, in Djemal’s words, “a perfect canal.” As he would exclaim in his
memoir, “And here is the only road which keeps my army in touch with the
home country!”</p>
<p>By the time Djemal finally reached his headquarters in Damascus on
December 6, more than two weeks after his departure from Constantinople,
he’d come to a fairly obvious conclusion: the Suez attack should be
postponed until some of the very basic issues of supply lines and
infrastructure were dealt with. He made the mistake, though, of sharing
this thought with the young German intelligence officer who had been
awaiting his arrival in Damascus and had been assigned to serve as
Djemal’s liaison to the German high command: Major Curt Prüfer.</p>
<p>To Prüfer, there could be no question of delaying the Suez offensive.
As he wrote to Max Oppenheim after learning of Djemal’s hesitation,
support for the jihad among the Syrians was tepid to begin with, and in
the event of a postponement, “undoubtedly the carefully manufactured
enthusiasm would disappear and the old indifference, if not hostility,
takes its place.” What’s more, such a delay would provoke “the total
discouragement of the Egyptians, who are cowards anyway.”</p>
<p>It was a rather curious stance for Prüfer to take, since most of his
letter to Oppenheim consisted of reasons why an attack on the canal was
almost sure to fail, his contention that “the means are not sufficient
to the task.” But Prüfer may have had a darker motive in urging it
forward. In Constantinople, he had been eyewitness to the protracted
struggle to bring Turkey into the war, and as he surely knew from
intelligence reports reaching him in Damascus, there were still those in
the CUP leadership maneuvering to back out of the German alliance and
sue for peace with the Entente. An assault on the Suez would end all
that. From that point on, Turkey would be joined at the hip to Germany,
and it would win or die along with it.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Djemal received a terse cable from Constantinople:
the Suez attack was to go forward without delay.</p>
