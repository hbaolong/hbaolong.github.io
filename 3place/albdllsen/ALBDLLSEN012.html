Void</h4>
<p>The situation is so interesting that I think I will fail to come
back.</p>
<p>T. E. LAWRENCE, IN ARABIA, TO CAIRO HEADQUARTERS, DECEMBER 27,
1916</p>
<p>From the crest of the hill, the night-wrapped valley of Nakhl Mubarak
yielded a startling sight. As Lawrence would recount, glimpsed through
the fronds of the date-palm plantations was “the flame-lit smoke of many
fires,” while the valley echoed with the braying of thousands of excited
camels, gunshots, and the calls of men lost in the darkness.</p>
<p>Accompanied by four tribal escorts, Lawrence had set out from the
port of Yenbo earlier that evening, December 2, 1916. Their destination
was Faisal’s camp in the mountainous enclave of Kheif Hussein, some
forty-five miles inland. With good camels beneath them and riding
steadily, the group had anticipated making the camp just around
daybreak. Instead, a mere five hours into their ride and just
twenty-five miles from the coast, they came upon this puzzling scene in
Nakhl Mubarak; no one in Lawrence’s party had any idea who these masses
of armed men in the valley below might be.</p>
<p>Dismounting, the group quietly descended from the ridgeline until
they came to a deserted home at the valley’s edge. After corralling the
camels and secreting his British charge within the home, the lead escort
slipped a cartridge into his carbine and set out alone on foot to
investigate. He shortly returned with shocking news: the men were
Faisal’s army. Remounting their camels, the group proceeded into the
heart of the valley, the scene more bewildering to Lawrence by the
minute. “There were hundreds of fires of thorn-wood, and round them were
Arabs making coffee or eating, or sleeping muffled like dead men in
their cloaks, packed together closely in the confusion of camels.”</p>
<p>They found Faisal at the center of the encampment, sitting before his
tent with several aides and a scribe. With illumination provided by
slaves holding lanterns, he was alternately dictating orders and
listening to battlefield reports being read aloud to him, the picture of
placidity. It was some time before he dismissed his retinue so that he
might explain the situation to his British guest. That situation wasn’t
good; it was little short of disastrous, in fact.</p>
<p>During Lawrence’s first visit in October, Faisal had outlined an
elaborate plan to take his war campaign north, a way to reduce the
Turkish threat to Rabegh and Mecca by giving the enemy something new to
worry about. That scheme depended on Faisal working in close concert
with the fighting units of his three brothers. While Abdullah harassed
the Turkish forces around Medina, Faisal would move the bulk of his army
northwest through the mountains to Kheif Hussein before closing on the
Turkish-held port of Wejh, some two hundred miles above Yenbo.
Simultaneously, Zeid would come up to protect the approaches to Yenbo,
while Ali brought his army out of Rabegh to guard a crucial intersection
on the pilgrims’ road to Mecca.</p>
<p>Lawrence had thought the plan too complicated by half, reliant as it
was on a level of coordination among the four brothers nearly impossible
to achieve across the great expanse of western Arabia. He’d conveyed his
doubts to Gilbert Clayton in his reports at the time, but apparently had
been less persuasive with Faisal; in mid-November, Faisal had put the
scheme into effect.</p>
<p>For a short while all had gone accordingly, with Faisal taking most
of his forces north to Kheif Hussein. At his back, however,
twenty-year-old Zeid inexplicably left one of the mountain paths leading
to Yenbo completely unguarded, and it was this path that a Turkish
mounted patrol found. Suddenly finding the Turks between them and their
escape route to the coast, Zeid’s charges had promptly scattered in
disarray. That had only been stage one of the fiasco, however. When they
learned of Zeid’s collapse, and fearful that they too might soon be
stranded in the mountains, Faisal’s followers had succumbed to a similar
panicked stampede from Kheif Hussein. Faisal and his lieutenants had
finally halted the flight there in Nakhl Mubarak, but even this, he
confided to Lawrence that night, probably wouldn’t hold; with the
advancing Turks now to the east and south, it seemed just a matter of
time before his entire force—what was left of it—fell all the way back
to Yenbo port itself.</p>
<p>Operating on practically no sleep, Lawrence spent the next
forty-eight hours alternately conferring with Faisal and circulating
among the fighters in Nakhl Mubarak, trying to better gauge the
magnitude of the crisis. He then raced back to Yenbo to raise the alarm.
When he sat down to send an urgent message to Clayton on the morning of
December 5, he was in a state of both exhaustion and despondency. “I had
better preface by saying that I rode all Saturday night, had alarms and
excursions all Sunday night, and rode again all last night, so my total
of sleep is only three hours in the last three nights and I feel rather
pessimistic. All the same, things are bad.”</p>
<p>As Lawrence well knew, the Arab rout in the mountains was much more
than just a military setback. Uniting the northern tribes to his
leadership had required months of painstaking and delicate work on
Faisal’s part, and that was now rapidly coming apart. In his report to
Clayton, Lawrence enumerated those tribes that had already abandoned
Faisal—or appeared ready to—and warned how those defections not only
threatened to leave the road open to a Turkish capture of Mecca, but to
a collapse of the Arab Revolt itself. The crucial point, Lawrence wrote,
was that Faisal was now “a tribal leader, not a leader of tribes,” and
it would take a long time to repair the damage. In this, too, there was
a parallel to the Crusader armies of the Middle Ages that Lawrence had
studied; the extreme fragility of alliances between disparate and
largely autonomous groups meant unity was always one small setback away
from unraveling.</p>
<p>But it was also a personal fiasco for Lawrence. In his October
reports, he had readily conceded the difficulty of ever organizing the
Arab fighters into a conventional fighting force—he’d figured that a
single company of Turkish soldiers, properly entrenched in open country,
could defeat them—but had been both eloquent and persuasive in
emphasizing their potency as a defensive force. “Their real sphere is
guerrilla warfare.… Their initiative, great knowledge of the country,
and mobility, make them formidable in the hills.” Not just formidable;
in Lawrence’s estimation, in such a role they would be all but
impregnable. “From what I have seen of the hills between Bir Abbas and
Bir Ibn Hassani,” he had written, “I do not see how, short of treachery
on the part of the hill tribe[s], the Turks can risk forcing their way
through.” To the contrary, with the hills “a very paradise for snipers,”
he was confident that a mere one or two hundred men could successfully
hold any possible line of Turkish approach toward the coast.</p>
<p>This conviction was one of the cornerstones of Lawrence’s argument
against sending Allied troops into Arabia, and he had maintained it even
after troubling evidence to the contrary. At the beginning of November,
after rumors of a Turkish advance had sent Ali’s men fleeing from the
hills above Rabegh, Lawrence had intimated to Édouard Brémond that
matters would have turned out differently if Faisal had been in charge.
As events now made clear, in this estimation he had been absolutely one
hundred percent wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was embarrassment over how badly he had misjudged the
situation, or perhaps even in his exhaustion Lawrence remained the
ever-vigilant bureaucratic strategist, but before sending off his
pessimistic cable to Clayton, he thought to scribble a postscript. If
reprinted in the Arab Bulletin, his cable would soon be read by all
those in the British leadership who had been won to his nonintervention
argument, so he jotted, “don’t use any of above in Bulletin or
elsewhere; it is not just—because I am done up.”</p>
<p>In response to the deepening crisis, British naval ships began
massing off Yenbo; if the worst did come to pass and Faisal’s men were
put to siege in that town, the ships might at least lay down artillery
fire on the surrounding open plain to slow the Turkish advance. True to
Faisal’s prediction, on the morning of December 9, the vanguard of his
spent force began drifting into the port with the news that they’d been
flushed from Nakhl Mubarak by another Turkish push; by the time the last
stragglers came in, the some five thousand warriors Lawrence had seen
under Fai- sal’s banner just one week earlier had been reduced to fewer
than two thousand. While a handful of the missing three thousand had
fallen in battle, the vast majority had simply abandoned the fight and
gone home to their villages.</p>
<p>So dispiriting was the atmosphere that even Lawrence now had second
thoughts about his most stoutly held belief. Writing to Clayton again on
December 11, he announced that “Faisal has now swung around to the
belief in a British force [being deployed] at Rabegh. I have wired this
to you, and I see myself that his arguments have force. If Zeid had not
been so slack, this would never have got to this pass.” He added a
bitter afterthought: “The Arabs, outside their hills, are
worthless.”</p>
<p>On that same day, Lawrence painted an even more dire picture to Cyril
Wilson. Without British troops in Rabegh, he wrote, Faisal was now of
the opinion that the whole revolution might collapse within three weeks’
time.</p>
<p>TO THE PUZZLEMENT of many residents, on the morning of May 31, 1916,
a German warplane had appeared in the skies over Jerusalem and proceeded
to execute a series of tight circles just to the west of the walled Old
City. Finally, a small weighted object was thrown from the plane that
landed in the street directly in front of the Hotel Fast, the favored
watering hole of German officers in Jerusalem. Upon closer inspection,
the packet was found to be a bundled German flag with a note inside from
Curt Prüfer. He was returning to the city that evening, the note
explained, and he wanted his cook to prepare a “good dinner” for him. It
was the sort of flamboyant act that Prüfer probably never would have
performed in his prior incarnation as a spy chief, but it was very much
in keeping with the colorful antics of his new comrades in arms, the
spotters and machine gunners and flying “aces” of the German
Fliegertruppen, or Flying Corps.</p>
<p>In preparation for a renewed Turco-German offensive against the Suez
Canal, in the early spring of 1916 a new German air squadron had been
brought down and based in Beersheva, at the eastern end of the Sinai
Peninsula. Tiring of his propaganda and surveillance duties in Syria and
eager to play an active role in the coming attack, Prüfer had petitioned
to be made an aerial spotter for Field Aviation Detachment 300.</p>
<p>The request was a somewhat puzzling one, given that Prüfer had
remained dubious about the wisdom of a second attempt on the Suez since
having participated in the first. As far back as August 1915, in a
detailed report to the German ambassador in Constantinople, he’d argued
that for such an offensive to have even a minimal chance of success, it
could not at all resemble Djemal’s haphazard “reconnaissance in force”
of the previous February, but would require a massive investment of
manpower and resources: road- and railway-building crews, crack Turkish
troops, German aircraft and officers and artillery. Of course, he
pointed out, the very scale of that investment meant a multiplying of
the logistical hurdles in keeping such a force supplied and fed and
watered across the Sinai sands. Simultaneously, it rendered the notion
of somehow catching the British by surprise “unthinkable.” “With all
their war machines,” he wrote, “you’d have to conduct a siege and bash
their defenses with artillery before you could march into Egypt, after
which you would need to maintain a line of supply from Palestine and
Syria.”</p>
<p>But even if all this could be accomplished, Prüfer had pointed out,
capturing the canal just might not ultimately be very significant. After
all, with the British navy in complete command of the seas, it wasn’t as
if the Suez would suddenly become useful to the Germans or Turks. As for
the argument that cinching off this maritime shortcut would disrupt the
flow of British territorial troops to Europe by forcing them to take the
long way around Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, this was certainly true, but
the two- to three-week delay that would cause hardly rose above the
level of inconvenience. To the German intelligence agent, the plans for
a second Suez operation had seemed to underscore the old maxim that war
can kill all things except bad ideas.</p>
<p>Against this, though, a powerful, personal lure had worked on him:
Detachment 300, the “glamour” of air war. In contrast to the hideous
reality of life and death in the trenches, an aura of romance had
instantly attached to this newest form of warfare, with the pilot aces
of all sides transformed into newsreel heroes and matinee idols. Prüfer,
never much of a man’s man, clearly reveled in being in the company of
such Übermenschen at Beersheva, and the months he spent with Detachment
300 were undoubtedly among the happiest of his life, a carefree time of
late-night drinking sessions, or flying off to Jerusalem or Jaffa at a
moment’s notice to attend diplomatic receptions or social dances. There
seemed to be an almost starstruck quality to it; in contrast to the
scant details Prüfer normally jotted in his wartime diary—when he
bothered to keep it at all—he made careful note of the names of most all
the Detachment 300 pilots for posterity. In the dropping of his note in
front of the Hotel Fast to order up a meal, the soft-spoken former
scholar was emulating the pranks of his new, larger-than-life
comrades—and undoubtedly deriving considerable pride over his excellent
aim.</p>
<p>Very shortly after that lark, however, had come news of the Arab
Revolt in the Hejaz. Apparently forgetting his own oft-repeated
assertion that the Arabs were too cowardly to ever rebel, Prüfer’s first
response had been a certain smugness, remarking in his diary, “I rightly
warned them about the Sherif [Hussein].” As the revolt spread, however,
and one Turkish garrison after another in Arabia came under siege, he
remembered his old mentor, Max von Oppenheim, and the tremendous efforts
the propaganda chief had made to forestall this day from coming. “The
situation in Arabia goes badly for the Turks,” he noted in early July.
“Poor Oppenheim!”</p>
<p>But Prüfer had soon turned his attention back to more immediate
concerns, as preparations got under way for the new Suez offensive. As
an aerial spotter, he quite literally had a bird’s-eye view when the
Turkish vanguard launched its attack against the British railhead at
Romani, some twenty-five miles east of the canal, on the morning of
August 4, 1916. While that vantage point afforded him the opportunity to
hurl a few bombs down on the enemy—bombs that in those early days of air
combat were little more than large hand grenades—it also allowed him to
grasp the full magnitude of the Turco-German defeat as it unfolded over
the next two days.</p>
<p>Hoping to catch the British in a flanking move, the attacking force
was instead caught out in the open and enveloped. By the afternoon of
August 5, the Turkish army was in headlong retreat, having suffered some
six thousand casualties, about one-third its total strength, and a toll
that undoubtedly would have been higher if the British hadn’t slowed
their pursuit out of sheer exhaustion in the 120-degree heat.</p>
<p>The rout at Romani ended forever the Turco-German dream of
“liberating” Egypt. It also ended Prüfer’s four-month idyll with
Detachment 300, for it forced him to finally acknowledge something he’d
tried very hard to ignore: he was desperately ill. There had been terse
little clues to it in his diary for some time—“I am unwell,” he had
noted back in mid-May—but now, his face sunken and his weight down to
little more than a hundred pounds, even his handwriting betrayed him;
gone was his emphatic, jerky script, replaced by a trembling, barely
legible scrawl. Diagnosed as suffering from both cholera and
tuberculosis, he was placed on medical leave and shuttled back to
Germany in early October. After several weeks’ recuperation in a Berlin
hospital, he began helping out in the mapping division of the Reserve
General Staff on Wilhelmstrasse.</p>
<p>In that capacity, the arc of Curt Prüfer’s wartime experience
completed a curious reverse symmetry with that of one of his adversaries
in the field, British army captain T. E. Lawrence. During the first two
years of the war, Lawrence had spent most of his time deskbound in the
mapping room of the Arab Bureau in Cairo, while Curt Prüfer seemed to be
everywhere: launching sabotage and spying missions against British
Egypt, participating in two major offensives, unmasking potential
enemies of the Ottoman and German cause throughout Syria. By the end of
1916, it was now Lawrence who was in the field as Prüfer whiled away his
days in a mapping room in Berlin.</p>
<p>And a most prosaic existence it was. By January 1917, with his
medical leave in Germany extended, Prüfer found himself battling with
the local food rationing office in Berlin over his bread allotment. As
he complained in cables to both his former colleagues in Constantinople
and senior officials at the foreign ministry, without written
confirmation of his leave extension, the Bread Commission was refusing
to issue him the required ration card, and he beseeched their help in
sorting out the problem as soon as possible. It was a very long way from
dropping dinner orders out of airplanes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was the strong likelihood that it was with such
mundane concerns that Curt Prüfer’s wartime career would end. With his
congenitally frail health, the Orientalist had only been inducted into
the German military back in 1914 through the intercession of Max von
Oppenheim, and his health was obviously far more ravaged now. Once
again, though, the self-proclaimed baron from Cologne would come to his
protégé’s aid, offering Prüfer an escape route from his semi-invalid
duties in Berlin.</p>
<p>Having thus far failed to ignite a pan-Islamic jihad in the Middle
East that would play to Germany’s political and military benefit,
Oppenheim, according to Prüfer biographer Donald McKale, was now
expanding his ambitions into the economic sphere. What he envisioned, in
the wake of the coming Central Powers victory, was a vast German
economic consortium that might dominate commerce and resource
development throughout the region for decades to come. In the count’s
scheme, the vehicle for this domination was to be a unique partnership
between the German government and the nation’s private industrial
conglomerates, the two working hand in glove for both personal and
national interest. A man with a deep, perhaps exaggerated appreciation
for the power of the printed word, Oppenheim worked up an alluring
packet of brochures and prospectuses to dazzle German businessmen with
visions of the wealth that could soon be theirs in the far-off lands of
the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>As Oppenheim explained to would-be investors, nothing more
exemplified the symbiotic relationship between public and private that
he envisioned for the East than the role soon to be assumed by his young
protégé, Curt Prüfer, in Constantinople. As the new head of the German
intelligence bureau there, Prüfer would also serve as the primary
conduit for investors trying to navigate Turkey’s bureaucratic shoals.
German industrialists could hardly ask for a better friend; here was a
man who not only knew the region and Young Turk power structure
intimately, but had a proven record of getting things done by whatever
creative means necessary.</p>
<p>Just as with his notion of anticolonial Islamic jihad, Max von
Oppenheim’s economic scheme would prove a bit ahead of its time,
presaging as it did the so-called national corporatism model first
successfully harnessed by Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini in the
1920s, and then to even more spectacular effect a decade later by
Mussolini’s protégé, Adolf Hitler. For Curt Prüfer in 1917, however, it
simply meant a return to the field. In late February, he bid goodbye to
his mapping-room colleagues in Berlin and set out for the Middle East
once more.</p>
<p>FOR COLONEL ÉDOUARD BRÉMOND, watching Captain T. E. Lawrence come off
the deck of HMS Suva in Jeddah harbor on December 12 must have been a
particularly gladdening sight, something very much like revenge. Even if
he’d yet to put together that Lawrence was the prime mover behind the
rebuke he had received from the French War Ministry weeks earlier,
Brémond most certainly now recognized him as a troublemaker, the man who
more than any other British field officer had poisoned the well for
sending Allied troops to Arabia. But now a rather different figure stood
before the French colonel, one shorn of his arrogance and supreme
self-assurance. Lawrence was just coming in from Yenbo, where he had
witnessed firsthand the pell-mell retreat of Faisal’s forces before the
advancing Turks, and the experience seemed to have stripped the irksome
little captain of his romantic notions of the brave Arab warrior.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the belief that they were finally on the same page, or
perhaps Brémond couldn’t resist the temptation to stick the knife in a
little, but on the Jeddah dock he informed Lawrence that he was just
then on his way to meet with Reginald Wingate in Khartoum. In light of
the unfolding crisis on the Arabian coast, he intended to once again
press for the dispatch of an Anglo-French force to Rabegh.</p>
<p>Lawrence had no doubt Brémond would find a receptive audience. Sure
enough, on December 14, and with Colonel Brémond at his side, Wingate
fired off another secret cable to the Foreign Office and General Murray
in Cairo urging that a brigade be sent as soon as possible. “I can see
no alternative or practical means of assisting Arabs, and of saving
Sherif’s movement from collapse,” Wingate wrote. “Sherif has cancelled
his original application to us to dispatch European troops, but is [now]
genuinely alarmed at situation and, in Colonel Brémond’s opinion, with a
little pressure would again ask for them.” The immediate question before
them, Wingate argued, “is whether we shall make a last attempt to save
Sherif and his Arabs in spite of themselves.”</p>
<p>Except, unbeknownst to most everyone at that moment, the immediate
crisis in western Arabia had actually already passed. On the night of
December 11, just hours after Lawrence left Yenbo on the Suva, a large
Turkish force had approached the town, only to hesitate upon seeing the
British ships in the harbor, their searchlights illuminating the
surrounding countryside as if in daylight. Apparently the Arabs’ mortal
fear of artillery was shared by the Turks, for this force soon turned
back from Yenbo; within days, aerial reconnaissance showed it had
retreated into the mountains, perhaps was even on its way back to
Medina. While this development didn’t necessarily mean an end of the
Turkish threat to the coastal towns, it did create breathing space—and
breathing space wasn’t at all helpful to the two escalationists in
Khartoum. In coming weeks, Wingate and Brémond would find several more
occasions to press for intervention, but they had lost their last best
chance with the Turkish withdrawal outside Yenbo.</p>
<p>Within several days of that threat passing, a somewhat chastened
Lawrence was back in Yenbo, trying to figure out with Faisal what might
come next. They were aided in their planning by a rather momentous
development in London. Just weeks earlier, the coalition government of
Herbert Asquith had fallen, and been replaced by a new coalition
government led by David Lloyd George. The new prime minister was
determined to break with the “Westerner” mind-set that had prevailed in
London since the beginning of the war, which held that ultimate victory
could only be achieved on the Western Front. That mind-set had led to
the deaths of some 400,000 British soldiers by the end of 1916, with no
end or breakthrough in sight. Instead, Lloyd George wanted to pursue an
“Easterner” policy, to try to “knock out the props” of the enemy war
machine by striking at its weakest spots. At least by comparison to the
seemingly impregnable wall of the Western Front, that meant the Balkans
and the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Shortly after Lawrence’s return to Yenbo, this new focus became
evident in an increased British presence on the Hejazi coast—not the
thousands of regulars hoped for by Wingate and Brémond, but rather an
assortment of instructors and advisors tasked to transform the
undisciplined Arab rebel bands into a credible fighting force. The most
interesting of these expanded operations took place in Yenbo, the
northernmost rebel-held port and now deemed relatively safe from Turkish
attack. With the Hejaz Railway, the Turks’ lifeline to their garrison in
Medina, situated a mere ninety miles inland, the British envisioned
using Yenbo as the staging ground for a committed campaign of sabotage
attacks on the railroad, and to this end they brought in a colorful
figure named Herbert Garland. A tall, rangy Scotsman, Garland had been a
chemist before the war and by tinkering in the training grounds in Cairo
had become a self-taught expert in blowing things up. In the few forays
the Arabs had conducted against the Hejaz Railway prior to his arrival,
they had simply torn up the tracks with picks and shovels, a very simple
business to mend, and Garland now set about teaching them the fine art
of placing an explosive charge beneath a rail in such a way as to mangle
it beyond repair. In the doldrum rebuilding days at Yenbo of early
January 1917, one of Major Garland’s most attentive students was T. E.
Lawrence.</p>
<p>But despite his dealings with Garland and the several other British
advisors now setting up shop in the port town, there was something that
set Lawrence quite apart from his countrymen. Part of it was obvious:
his dress.</p>
<p>During Lawrence’s visit to the Arab encampment in Nakhl Mubarak in
early December, Faisal had suggested he dispense with his British army
uniform in favor of Arab dress; that way, the British liaison officer
could circulate through the camp and call upon Faisal at his leisure
without drawing undue attention. Lawrence had taken to this suggestion
with alacrity, donning the white robes and gold sashing normally
reserved for a senior sheikh. He had changed out of those robes during
his brief run down the coast to Jeddah, but had immediately put them on
again upon his return to Yenbo.</p>
<p>Yet he stood apart for far more than just his attire. Taking his
temporary posting as Faisal’s liaison very much to heart, Lawrence
largely eschewed the British tent settlement at the water’s edge to
spend most of his time at the sprawling Arab encampment several miles
inland. There, and with far more tolerance than most other British
officers might reasonably muster, he set about adapting to the peculiar
lassitude with which Faisal ran his “army.”</p>
<p>The typical day started with a dawn wake‑up call by an imam, then a
leisurely breakfast where Faisal conferred with his senior aides and
various tribal leaders. This was followed by a long morning stretch
during which any man in the encampment could come to petition Faisal
over some concern or grievance; as Lawrence quickly noted, few of these
audiences had any direct connection to the war effort. This open-house
session only ended with the serving of lunch, often a two-hour affair
attended by more aides and tribal leaders, after which Faisal might
spend a couple of hours dictating messages to his scribes. That work
done, it was more chitchat until an evening meal consumed at an even
more languorous pace than the previous one. After that, more dictations
by Faisal, more conversations with elders, the reading of reports from
various scouting parties, an unhurried, undirected process that might
stretch well past midnight—even right up to the imam’s dawn call that
signaled it was all about to start over again.</p>
<p>For a famously impatient and ascetic man like T. E. Lawrence, it must
have been a kind of agony. In normal times, he was so indifferent to
food and meals that his preference was to eat standing up and to finish
in less than five minutes. Probably even more trying for a man who
abhorred physical contact—he avoided even the shaking of hands if he
could do so without offense—was the easy affection on constant display
in the Arab camp, the endless embraces and kissing of cheeks, the casual
holding of hands.</p>
<p>But Lawrence also recognized that this was the Arab way of war and
peace. Faisal was not just a wartime leader, but a Hejazi chieftain, and
the long, seemingly purposeless conversations were the glue that kept
his fractious coalition together. In this culture, Faisal was not a
general who issued orders—at least not to men not of his tribe—but a
consensus builder compelled to cajole, counsel, and listen. Certainly,
none of this was going to change to accommodate the Arabs’ British
advisors. To the contrary, Lawrence understood, it was he and his
countrymen who had to adapt if they hoped to be accepted and effective.
It was a pretty simple truism, but one that many of his colleagues,
steeped in British notions of both military and cultural hierarchy, had
a very hard time with.</p>
<p>Animating Lawrence’s determination to adapt was the figure of Faisal
ibn Hussein himself. Even in the darkest days of the revolt, when he had
visited the Arabs’ temporary refuge at Nakhl Mubarak, Lawrence had been
struck by Faisal’s unshaken ambition, a quality that had tempered his
own pessimism over the situation. As he had reported to Gilbert Clayton
on December 5, “I heard [Faisal] address the head of one battalion last
night before sending them out to an advanced position over the Turkish
camp at Bir Said. He did not say much, no noise about it, but it was all
exactly right and the people rushed over one another with joy to kiss
his headrope when he finished. He has had a nasty knock in Zeid’s
retreat, and he realized perfectly well that it was the ruin of all his
six months’ work up here in the hills tying tribe to tribe and fixing
each in its proper area. Yet he took it all in public as a joke,
chaffing people on the way they had run away, jeering at them like
children, but without in the least hurting their feelings, and making
the others feel that nothing much had happened that could not be put
right. He is magnificent, for to me privately he was most horribly cut
up.”</p>
<p>Faisal had displayed that same spirit in Yenbo. On December 20, when
it was clear the Turks were falling back toward Medina, he had beseeched
his brother Ali to come north out of Rabegh with his army of some seven
thousand, while Faisal took his own forces back up into the mountains;
the hope was to catch the withdrawing Turks in a pincer movement. Alas,
Ali proved no better a warrior leader than brother Zeid. Within days,
his army had panicked and turned back for Rabegh on yet another
erroneous rumor of a Turkish force ahead, and a disappointed Faisal saw
no option but to return with his own men to Yenbo.</p>
<p>To most other British officers who observed the incident, it was
another example of the ineptitude of the Arab forces, that at least
twice now they had fled the field on the mere rumor of a Turkish
presence. Lawrence saw things quite differently. Fresh from their recent
rout in the mountains, the prudent course would have been for Faisal to
keep his men under the protection of the British naval guns at Yenbo
while they regrouped; instead, he had tried to leap to the offensive the
moment an opportunity presented itself. It spoke of a determination in
Faisal sorely lacking in his brothers.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, with both Rabegh and Yenbo now looking at least
temporarily secure, Faisal returned to the idea of taking his campaign
north and seizing the port town of Wejh. With Wejh in rebel hands, not
only would the British supply line from Egypt be brought two hundred
miles closer, but the easier terrain would allow for more frequent raids
inland against the Hejaz Railway. Over long discussions with Lawrence,
the two came up with a stripped-down version of Faisal’s earlier plan,
one that relied far less heavily on support from his now proven
unreliable brothers.</p>
<p>But planning that advance must have been a bittersweet exercise for
Lawrence. As he well knew, his time in Arabia was rapidly drawing to a
close. Despite a series of delays in Europe, Stewart Newcombe would soon
be on his way to take up his permanent position with Faisal, and
Lawrence bundled back to his desk job at the Arab Bureau.</p>
<p>It was a fate he had tried to forestall through a campaign of quiet
subversion ever since returning to the Hejaz. A chief target of that
campaign had been his temporary field supervisor, Lieutenant Colonel
Cyril Wilson. Quite aware of Wilson’s fierce opposition to even his
temporary posting in Arabia, Lawrence had sought to sidestep the
resident agent in Jeddah by playing directly to the higher powers in
Cairo. That scheme had started with his very first cable back to Gilbert
Clayton on December 5. “One of the things not fixed when I came down
here,” Lawrence wrote, “was my [supervisory] chief, and my manner of
reporting. It is probably through Colonel Wilson, but as there is a post
going to Egypt tonight I am sending this direct.”</p>
<p>In fact, it had been made perfectly clear to Lawrence that Wilson was
his chief in the field, so his confusion on this point was more than a
little disingenuous. It established a precedent, however, one that
Lawrence soon reemployed when Wilson tried to clip his wings by
appointing him to the lowly post of supply officer in Yenbo. In
protesting this assignment to Clayton—“I regard myself as primarily an
Intelligence Officer, or liaison with Faisal”—Lawrence also thought to
explain that he was sending his latest reports to Cairo, rather than
routing them through Wilson, because “if they are to be any good at all
they should reach you within a reasonable period of dispatch—and to send
them to Jeddah is only [the] waste of a week or ten days.” That
rationale would have lost some of its persuasiveness had it been known
that Lawrence was actually on a ship en route to Jeddah when he wrote
it.</p>
<p>As December wore on, his campaign became only more overt. Not for
Lawrence any beseeching pleas for reconsideration; instead, he assumed
the posture that his continuing on in Arabia was a foregone conclusion.
“If I am to stay here,” he wrote Clayton’s deputy at the end of the
month, once again sidestepping Wilson, “I will need all sorts of things.
Have you any news of Newcombe? The situation is so interesting that I
think I will fail to come back. I want to rub off my British habits and
go off with Faisal for a bit.” As if that desire was somehow already a
part of his government’s planning, Lawrence then laid out his
intentions. “When I have someone to take over here from me, I’ll go off.
Wadi Ais is the unknown area of N. Hejaz, and I want to drop up and see
it, [and] anything behind Rudhwa will be worth while.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>IT WAS LESS a failed regime, perhaps, than a fantastically deluded
one. Across the breadth of Syria by the close of 1916, an estimated
half-million people had already died of starvation or disease, and
conditions appeared slated to only grow worse in the new year. On the
military front, Turkish forces had been thrown back from the Suez Canal
anew, the garrison in Medina was one of the last holdouts against the
Arab rebels in the Hejaz, and the British were once again marching up
the Tigris toward Baghdad. Yet in his governor’s mansions in Jerusalem
and Damascus, Djemal Pasha continued to pore over blueprints for new
canalworks and roadways, continued to attend ribbon-cutting ceremonies
for the inauguration of schools and hospitals. It was as if he clung
more tenaciously to his self-image as a progressive reformer because of
the cascade of ruin all around him rather than in spite of it.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason was that the Syrian governor was becoming ever
more divorced from the power elites in Constantinople. In the Ottoman
capital, the criticisms of Djemal had reached new heights with the
outbreak of the Arab Revolt, but in what was now an established pattern,
those criticisms ran the gamut from his having been too harsh—a common
view, one embraced by most historians, was that his executions of the
Arab nationalist leaders had provoked the rebellion—to his being far too
lenient. To this latter charge, Djemal’s penchant for glibness didn’t
help his cause; when Julius Loytved-Hardegg, the German consul in
Damascus, asked whatever had possessed him to allow Faisal ibn Hussein
to leave for Arabia on the eve of the revolt, Djemal replied that he’d
done it to test Faisal’s true colors. As Loytved-Hardegg acerbically
noted in his report of the meeting, “the present time doesn’t seem
especially appropriate” for such a test.</p>
<p>Also irritating to Constantinople was Djemal’s curious streak of
courtliness toward Europeans in general, and the French in particular,
as evidenced by his continuing to allow many of these “belligerent
nationals” to stay on in Syria without restriction. A notable exception
to his Europhilia was the European nation to which his government was
militarily allied; Djemal loathed most everything about Germany and its
culture, and could be quite expansive in enumerating its deficiencies to
anyone within earshot.</p>
<p>As the war ground on, however, and Frenchmen became a rarer commodity
in Syria—thanks in no small part to the ferreting-out skills of German
agents like Curt Prüfer—the governor seemed to transfer his affections
to a different expatriate community, the Americans. To the cloistered
faithful of the American Colony, a conservative religious sect that had
established itself in Jerusalem in the 1890s, Djemal was a frequent and
welcome guest; surviving photographs show Colony children crawling over
Djemal’s lap, much to his evident delight. Similarly, Howard Bliss, the
president of the Syrian Protestant College (later the American
University of Beirut), was so grateful for Djemal’s support of the
institution, ensuring that it received subsidized food shipments in the
midst of the Lebanon famine, that in late January 1917 he invited the
governor to be the university’s commencement speaker.</p>
<p>At that time, the U.S. consul in Damascus, Samuel Edelman, was having
his own rather odd experience with Djemal, one that began with his
answering a summons to the governor’s Damascus office on January 20. For
some months, Edelman had been trying to arrange the safe passage from
Syria of some five hundred American citizens eager to escape the
worsening conditions, but his efforts had been stymied by Ottoman
authorities. Certainly not helping matters was the recent reelection of
Woodrow Wilson as president. Despite the campaign slogan that had helped
carry him to reelection—“He kept us out of the war”—there were growing
signs that Wilson intended to bring the United States in on the side of
the Allies, and Constantinople was understandably loath to release
hundreds of foreigners with firsthand knowledge of the situation in
Syria, and whose government might soon join the enemy camp. In his
meeting with Edelman on January 20, Djemal offered a novel solution. As
the nonplussed consul cabled to his embassy in Constantinople, Djemal
would now agree to let the five hundred Americans leave so long as they
gave their word of honor “not to discuss Ottoman affairs until the end
of war.” Not surprisingly, American diplomats swiftly agreed to these
patently unenforceable terms and set about arranging the departure of
their citizens from Syria.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t as if Djemal was compliant to the entreaties of all
Americans. One who didn’t get his way in one particular incident was the
Standard Oil representative in Syria, William Yale.</p>
<p>Despite the steadily worsening conditions in Jerusalem, the American
oilman had proven himself supremely adaptable to his surroundings. With
the Turkish currency collapsed in value and speculators subject to
hanging, Yale had embarked on a complicated black-market scheme that
involved the buying and reselling of gold and paper scrip in different
towns across Palestine that, after expenses, netted him a tidy 10
percent profit. On one occasion, when the governor of Jerusalem had
balked at renewing Socony’s concessionary permits, Yale had blackmailed
the man by threatening to denounce him to the Young Turk leadership in
Constantinople, as well as to inform the governor’s wife of his illicit
love affair.</p>
<p>Yale’s special appeal to Djemal Pasha came in the autumn of 1916, and
it arose when a trusted—or perhaps bribed—censor at the telegraph office
in Jerusalem came to Yale and his business partner, Ismail Hakki Bey,
with disturbing news. According to the censor, Djemal had just received
an anonymous letter accusing Ismail Bey of belonging to a revolutionary
group with ties to the Arab Revolt leader, Faisal Hussein. Further, the
letter stated that “a young American was financing the group,” a clear
reference to Yale.</p>
<p>Since such an accusation, if believed, was tantamount to a death
sentence, the two men rushed to Djemal’s office at the German Hospice
and demanded to see the letter. To their profound shock, they recognized
the handwriting as that of Selim Ayoub, one of the other two Jerusalem
businessmen involved in the Kornub oil concessions. “Ismail Bey and I
were so angry at the man’s underhanded, unscrupulous action,” Yale
recalled, “we demanded that he and his whole family be exiled.”</p>
<p>In his memoir, Yale professed to have been on “intimate, friendly
terms” with Ayoub and his family, and he surely knew what such a
banishment would mean to the man’s wife and children: utter destitution
in the best of circumstances, slow death from disease or starvation in
the worst. Yale also seemed to have rather forgotten that he’d
threatened Ismail Bey with a very similar charge the year before. In any
event, Djemal refused to give the aggrieved oilmen full satisfaction;
while agreeing to send Selim Ayoub into exile, he decreed that the rest
of the Ayoub family could remain in Jerusalem. With twenty years’
distance on the event, Yale would note in his memoirs, “I am glad that
Djemal acted less cruelly than the rest of us.”</p>
<p>THE MARCH ON Wejh began at an oasis village northeast of Yenbo, and
in wondrously exotic fashion. To Lawrence, the scene was both splendid
and barbaric, as if the medieval histories he had devoured as a child
had suddenly come to life. “Faisal in front, in white,” he wrote.
“[Chieftain] Sharraf on his right, in red headcloth and henna-dyed tunic
and cloak, myself on his left in white and red. Behind us 3 banners of
purple silk with gold spikes, behind them 3 drummers playing a march,
and behind them a wild bouncing mass of 1,200 camels of the bodyguard,
all packed as closely as they could move, the men in every variety of
colored clothes and the camels nearly as brilliant in their
trappings—and the whole crowd singing at the tops of their voices a war
song in honor of Faisal and his family! It looked like a river of
camels, for we filled up the wadi to the tops of its banks, and poured
along in a quarter-of-a-mile long stream.”</p>
<p>For Lawrence, this entrancing spectacle was to be very short-lived.
Despite all his maneuverings of the past month, earlier that morning a
cable had arrived in Yenbo announcing that Stewart Newcombe was finally
on his way from Egypt; Lawrence was instructed to wait in Yenbo for his
replacement’s arrival, at which point his posting in Arabia would come
to an end. As a result, after accompanying the grand cavalcade north for
a mere hour or so, Lawrence had no choice but to bid Faisal farewell and
return to the coast.</p>
<p>But there was to be no handover of authority in Yenbo. Instead, with
Newcombe encountering another last-minute delay in Cairo, it was decided
the two officers would meet up in the small rebel-held port of Um Lejj,
halfway along the coast to Wejh, where they could intercept Faisal’s
army as it moved north. Accordingly, on January 14, Lawrence hopped on
HMS Suva and made the short run up to Um Lejj and a reunion with Faisal.
With the rebel force pausing there to reprovision, it was a fleeting
reminder to Lawrence of both the adventure he’d had over the previous
six weeks and of all he was about to miss. “I wish I had not to go back
to Egypt,” he wistfully wrote his family from Um Lejj on January 16.
“Anyway, I have had a change.”</p>
<p>Except there was still no word of Newcombe. By the seventeenth, and
with the rebel march scheduled to resume the next morning, Lawrence
quietly entertained the hope that perhaps his superior still might not
make it in time, in which case he would have “no choice” but to
accompany Faisal on to Wejh. By that evening, and with still no sign of
Newcombe, Lawrence’s hopes seemed realized; leaving a note for Newcombe
in Um Lejj—“So I miss you by a day!”—he raced out to the desert to
rejoin Faisal.</p>
<p>In fact, it was by considerably less than a day. No sooner had the
Arab army broken camp that morning, Lawrence happily ensconced alongside
Faisal, than two horsemen appeared coming from Um Lejj at a full gallop.
One of them was Newcombe, finally arrived to take up his position as
head of the British military mission to the Hejaz.</p>
<p>By instruction, Lawrence was to now return to Um Lejj and board the
next ship for Cairo. On the spur of the moment, however, Stewart
Newcombe decided on a different plan. This handover was far too rushed,
and while he’d no doubt stumble his way to a familiarity with Faisal and
his chief lieutenants during the continuing trek to Wejh, that process
might be greatly eased if his stand-in of the past six weeks remained on
hand to make the introductions. When Newcombe suggested this alternative
to Lawrence, he encountered no resistance.</p>
<p>DURING HIS LONG and dreary days of waiting in London, Aaron Aaronsohn
had fixed his gaze on Cairo, the place where he imagined British inertia
might finally be overcome. It wasn’t quite working out that way. “A
hundred times daily I curse the moment when we decided to work with
them,” he raged in his diary on January 5, 1917. “Better for us to
stagnate with the Turks and keep our illusions about the Allies than to
approach them and see this hopeless incompetency. If the Boches
[Germans] are finally beaten by these kakers they will have reason to
doubt God and Justice.”</p>
<p>Aaronsohn had arrived in Port Said in mid-December with the intention
of immediately proceeding to Cairo to present his letters of
introduction to Gilbert Clayton at the Arab Bureau. Instead, the British
authorities meeting his ship had been more impressed by his dubious
legal status—he was still a citizen of the Ottoman Empire—and had
quarantined him in Alexandria. Shortly afterward, a young captain from
the Eastern Mediterranean Special Intelligence Bureau (EMSIB), William
Edmonds, showed up with the news that he was to serve as Aaronsohn’s
liaison.</p>
<p>The agronomist’s initial high opinion of Edmonds—“not only very
intelligent but very shrewd as well”—rapidly diminished when it became
clear the intelligence agent’s function was more to mollify Aaronsohn
with the appearance of progress than to actually liaise him to anyone of
substance. An indication of where Aaronsohn stood in the larger scheme
of things was revealed when he inquired into the possibility of being
reimbursed for some of the expenses he’d incurred in reaching London and
then coming on to Egypt, a cost he estimated at about £1,500. Edmonds
blanched at the figure; with the miserliness with which British
officialdom was already infamous, he pointed out that no expenses could
be reimbursed without proper receipts, and instead proposed placing
Aaronsohn on a stipend of £1 a day, a sum that didn’t even cover his
Alexandria hotel bill. The proud scientist immediately refused.</p>
<p>“Until now,” he vented in his diary that night, “I have encountered
nothing but distrust and reticence, smallness and pettiness. I must try
and control my nerves so that I can establish another connection with
Absa,” he wrote, referring to Absalom Feinberg, the deputy he had left
behind in Athlit. “Then, he can continue the work if he wants to. So far
as I am concerned, I have had enough of it. I am not going to continue
working under such conditions.”</p>
<p>Driving Aaronsohn’s pique was that he’d heard nothing of what might
be happening in Palestine for the past eight months. His whole purpose
in coming to Egypt had been to finally link the British with his spy
network in Athlit, and instead he was wasting his time quibbling about
receipts and meeting with low-level functionaries.</p>
<p>What the scientist didn’t appreciate was that he still wasn’t fully
trusted. Just as with the intelligence analyst back in London who’d
concluded that Aaronsohn’s information was so accurate it might indicate
he was really a Turkish spy, so that analyst’s counterparts in Cairo
were grappling with the conundrum that this suspicion posed: how to link
up with Aaronsohn’s spy network, should it actually exist, while
simultaneously blocking him from making contact with his Turkish
counterintelligence handlers, if that was his true game? Aaronsohn may
have unwittingly added to these doubts by repeatedly asking to talk with
the intelligence officer that Absalom Feinberg had made contact with in
1915, Leonard Woolley. His British handlers were very slow to inform
Aaronsohn that Woolley was now a Turkish captive, his ship having been
torpedoed in the Gulf of Alexandretta over the summer, and Aaronsohn’s
constant invoking of Woolley’s name in the absence of that information
surely raised more eyebrows.</p>
<p>Shortly before Christmas, the British thought they’d come up with a
clever way around their dilemma. Edmonds informed Aaronsohn that, at
long last, a spy ship was being dispatched to make contact with Athlit;
might Aaronsohn care to send along a personal message? The agronomist
saw through the ploy at once and flew into one of his trademark tempers.
Unless he went on the boat personally, he told Edmonds, he’d simply end
all relations then and there; far better that than allowing the British
to send in “some blunderer” who might get all his people killed.</p>
<p>In the face of this ultimatum, a compromise was reached: Aaronsohn
could go along on the boat, but would not be allowed ashore. In his
stead, couriers would be sent in on a launch under the cover of darkness
carrying instructions from him, as well as some of his small personal
items that his confederates might recognize, thus convincing them the
instructions were genuine. Allowing sufficient time for contact to be
made, the launch would then go back in to retrieve the couriers off the
beach. Time would be short, however, since the spy ship obviously needed
to be well over the horizon and gone from sight before sunrise.</p>
<p>As at most every other stage of this star-crossed venture, now
entering its seventeenth month, there was to be a snag. With Aaronsohn
on board, the spy ship, a small converted trawler named the Goeland,
slipped out of Port Said on Christmas Eve, and reached the coast off
Athlit by the following afternoon. Aaronsohn made out someone waving a
black cloth from the second-floor balcony of the research station, an
identification that might have been more definitive had anyone on the
ship’s crew thought to bring along a decent pair of binoculars. Waiting
for the cover of nightfall to make contact, the Goeland then headed out
to the open sea, only to sail directly into a strong squall, a typical
occurrence in the eastern Mediterranean at that time of year.
Consequently, it was nearly 2 a.m. before the seas had calmed enough to
allow it to return to Athlit and release the launch with the two
couriers on board, one carrying Aaronsohn’s instructions to his
conspirators, the other his monogrammed penknife and special magnifying
glass. No sooner had the launch disappeared into the darkness than the
storm kicked back up.</p>
<p>Within the hour, the launch returned with troubling news. With the
surf too rough to make a beach landing, the couriers had been instructed
to swim the last little distance to shore. And with dawn fast
approaching—already they could see a bivouac fire to the north,
presumably that of a Turkish shore patrol—there was now no time to go
back in to collect them; the couriers would have to fend for themselves.
Throttling up its engines, the Goeland headed out to open waters once
more. For Aaronsohn, it was one more maddening experience to join all
the others; he had at last glimpsed Athlit again, but had no way of
knowing for certain if successful contact had been made.</p>
<p>His mood improved when in early January he was finally permitted to
leave Alexandria for Cairo. Taking a room at the Continental Hotel, he
made the rounds of the different officials in the Arab Bureau, and at
last began finding a receptive audience. Chief among these was another
aristocratic Amateur and member of Parliament, a thirty-one-year-old
Oxford graduate recently arrived in Cairo named William Ormsby-Gore. If
not quite up to Mark Sykes’s overachiever status, Ormsby-Gore was also a
great dabbler over an eclectic array of interests, including the notion
of establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine—a cause with special
resonance since he had recently converted to Judaism. In the months
ahead, he and Sykes would emerge as two of the most important figures in
the British power structure pushing for the creation of such a Jewish
homeland, and one of their primary vehicles in furthering that cause
would be Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, Ormsby-Gore sought to bolster the
agronomist’s flagging spirits however he could. Under his urging,
another spy ship was sent to make contact with Athlit in mid-January;
alas, this mission, too, ran into bad weather, and was aborted even
before the Palestine coast had been reached. Ormsby-Gore also passed
Aaronsohn along to two other members of the Arab Bureau, Philip Graves
and Major Windham Deedes, who shared the MP’s belief in the enormous
benefits that might be derived by activating the scientist’s
intelligence network. These sympathizers managed to insert a portion of
an Aaronsohn report on the Jewish colonies in Palestine into the Arab
Bulletin, including the pointed comment that the Zionists’ greatest
desire was “for autonomy through the benevolence of a friendly
protecting power,” marking one of the very few times a non-British
correspondent gained a hearing in the intelligence compendium. Still, it
reflected how far the agronomist remained from the inner circle of power
in Cairo that he could imagine Windham Deedes as being “in charge of the
Intelligence Service,” as he noted in his diary, rather than cued to his
true status as a mere midlevel analyst.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, then, Aaronsohn finally began making some headway,
but as he well knew, “slowly” was his enemy. That became manifestly
clear on January 25. As he was returning to his room at the Continental
Hotel that afternoon, he spotted his erstwhile liaison, Captain Edmonds,
lounging near the staircase; he noted that the young officer seemed
“mysterious in attitude.”</p>
<p>“You are the very man I am looking for,” Edmonds said. “You must go
immediately to Port Said. One of your men came across the desert.” It
was shocking news to Aaronsohn, but, true to form, Edmonds refused to
provide any details other than the man’s name: Joseph Lishansky.</p>
<p>“Is he wounded I wonder?” Aaronsohn wrote in his diary before rushing
off to Port Said. “Why do they send me to him instead of sending him
here? These gentlemen are so uselessly and so unfortunately
mysterious!”</p>
<p>As he discovered in Port Said, his apprehensions were exactly
right—Lishansky was wounded—but the story got much worse from there.
Having despaired of ever hearing from Aaronsohn, and with the situation
in Palestine growing ever more bleak, in mid-December Lishansky and
Absalom Feinberg had decided to make another attempt to reach Egypt
overland; in a cruel twist of fate, they had set off from Athlit just
days before the Goeland couriers had come ashore with Aaronsohn’s
instructions. After a harrowing journey across the Sinai no-man’s-land,
the two men had been nearly to the British lines when they were spotted
by a band of Bedouin raiders. In the ensuing gunfight, Lishansky escaped
with relatively minor wounds, but Feinberg had been shot in the back and
was presumably dead.</p>
<p>The news shattered Aaronsohn; Feinberg was not only his deputy at
Athlit, but his closest friend. “So Absa, the brave, was shot by vile,
rapacious Bedouins,” he lamented in his diary; “he fell dying into the
hands of those whom he despised most.”</p>
<p>There was little time for grieving, however, for Aaronsohn instantly
appreciated the new problem Feinberg’s apparent death raised: if the
Turks found and identified his body, they would surely set to tearing
Athlit apart and rounding up his associates. Rushing back to Cairo,
Aaronsohn went in frantic search of his newfound friends in the Arab
Bureau, and found Windham Deedes.</p>
<p>The frustrations of nearly two years came out in a torrent. Amid
tears, he blamed Feinberg’s death on the incompetence and cynicism of
the British war machine, and warned that his death was a mere harbinger
of the many to come if the Turks uncovered his spy ring—as now seemed
highly likely. “I spoke with fire and sorrow,” Aaronsohn noted in his
diary. “[Deedes] listened to me kindly.… He assured me that in future
there would be no more humiliation and distrust and that everything
would go well.”</p>
<p>True to Deedes’s word, a spy ship was immediately readied to make
another run to Athlit. This time, Aaronsohn distinctly saw signals from
the research station’s balcony, and a launch was cast off to take his
messages ashore. In an eerie reprise of the earlier voyage, however,
another storm descended at just that moment, compelling the launch to
stay offshore and a lone courier to swim the last stretch to the beach.
After a tense hour’s wait, the swimmer reappeared on the shore with two
men from Athlit, but by now the storm was raging; unable to swim out to
the launch, this courier, too, was left behind.</p>
<p>More bad news soon followed. Guided by Lishansky’s description of the
attack, a Bedouin tracker was sent out into the Sinai in search of
Absalom Feinberg. He found nothing. “So our brave Knight is dead!”
Aaronsohn wrote in his diary. “Without even confessing it to myself, I
had entertained a wild hope that he had survived. But now, we can do
nothing except to complete the work for which he gave his life.”</p>
<p>But this, too, was hardly a consoling thought to Aaron Aaronsohn.
With Absalom Feinberg now dead and his brother Alex in America, the full
burden and peril of operating the spy ring would fall squarely on the
only person left in Palestine whom the scientist implicitly trusted: his
twenty-seven-year-old sister Sarah.</p>
<p>IN SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, Lawrence described the Arab army that
left Um Lejj for the march on Wejh on January 18 in exalted terms.
Coming just a little over a month since the debacle above Yenbo, Faisal
now stood at the head of a force of some ten thousand warriors drawn
from a half-dozen different tribes and many more clans. Lawrence
underscored the importance of that moment by invoking the words of a
young sheikh of the Beidawi tribe, Abd el Karim, as he gazed over the
sea of tent encampments:</p>
<p>“He called me out to look, and swept his arm round, saying
half-sadly, ‘We are no longer Arabs but a People.’ He was half-proud
too, for the advance on Wejh was their biggest effort, the first time in
memory that the manhood of a tribe, with transport, arms and food for
[covering] two hundred miles, had left its district and marched into
another’s territory without the hope of plunder or the stimulus of blood
feud.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, but born of such high purpose, it must have been rather
anticlimactic when Faisal’s forces cleared the dunes south of Wejh a
week later to find the port town already a shattered, smoking ruin. It
was an embarrassing sight for Faisal ibn Hussein, and only slightly less
so for that British member of his entourage who had become his greatest
supporter.</p>
<p>By the timetable worked out with senior British officers at Um Lejj,
Faisal’s men were supposed to have reached Wejh fully two days earlier.
At that point, a coordinated land-and-sea operation was to be launched,
with Faisal’s forces closing from the landward side while the British
naval flotilla waiting offshore would ferry ashore the some 550 Arab
fighters they had transported up from Yenbo.</p>
<p>But as the British armada maneuvered into position leading up to
H-Hour on January 23, Faisal’s army had been nowhere to be seen. That
night, the commander of the British fleet, Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss,
decided that, for “sanitary reasons” alone, he simply had to put the
Arab warriors on his ships ashore. Following a brief bombardment on the
morning of January 24, the shipborne Arab fighters had been ferried into
Wejh under the command of two British officers.</p>
<p>The ensuing battle was a chaotic and fitful affair, one that lasted
most of that day and left some twenty of the Arab fighters dead. No
doubt contributing to its slow pace—the Turkish garrison of two hundred
was outnumbered nearly three to one and demoralized—was the Arab habit
of breaking off their attacks to loot and ransack whatever new buildings
they occupied. One of the British officers in charge of the ground
operation, Captain Norman Bray, was shocked by the rebels’ behavior,
noting in his battle report that the result of their freebooting ways
was a town “ransacked from roof to floor.” This was the scene that
Faisal and Lawrence rode into the following day.</p>
<p>For his part, Lawrence struggled mightily to put the very best gloss
on matters, offering in his own report a number of unconvincing
explanations to account for their delay in reaching Wejh. Lawrence’s
reflexively contrarian response to criticisms of the Arabs by his
British comrades was nothing new. Back on the night of December 11, when
Turkish forces had approached the outskirts of Yenbo, a British pilot
had unsparingly described the panic that gripped Faisal’s forces within
the town. His account stood in marked contrast to Lawrence’s own version
of events. “The garrison was called out about 10 PM by means of criers
sent round the streets,” he reported. “The men all turned out without
visible excitement, and proceeded to their posts round the town wall
without making a noise, or firing a shot.”</p>
<p>The easiest explanation for this divergence of accounts was that the
pilot had actually been in Yenbo at the time, whereas Lawrence had not;
earlier that same day, he had left Yenbo by ship, a detail left obscure
in his report.</p>
<p>This variance in viewpoints also extended to the figure of Faisal ibn
Hussein. In his December report, that same British pilot had reported
that Faisal “is easily frightened and lives in constant dread of a
Turkish advance, though he seems to conceal that fear from his army.”
Another British officer, Major Charles Vickery, caustically commented
after observing Faisal’s force in Wejh that “it is not known how far
other Sherifial leaders interest themselves in the training of their
troops, but certainly Sherif Faisal ignores it.” Most appalling to
British officers had been Faisal’s decision to take up quarters on a
British warship in Yenbo harbor during those dark December days when a
Turkish attack seemed imminent, leaving his men onshore to fend for
themselves.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, stood at great odds to Lawrence’s own
analysis; as he’d said of Faisal even during the grim interlude in Nakhl
Mubarak, “he is magnificent.” It also revealed something quite
remarkable: after just three months in the field, Lawrence was not only
the chief booster of Faisal and the Arabs, but their most determined
apologist.</p>
<p>Among those who noticed this was Faisal himself. Knowing that
Lawrence was now scheduled to return to Cairo—and probably having seen
enough of the hard-nosed Newcombe during the march up from Um Lejj to
realize theirs would be a less congenial relationship—Faisal sent off a
secret cable to Cyril Wilson in Jeddah on the same day that he reached
Wejh. As Wilson relayed to Gilbert Clayton in Cairo, Faisal “is most
anxious that Lawrence should not return to Cairo, as he has given such
very great assistance.”</p>
<p>Confronted by this direct request from Faisal, Clayton found it quite
impossible to find a way to refuse. Within days, the paperwork was
readied to make Lawrence’s posting to the Hejaz permanent. At last,
Lawrence was to be free: free of his desk at the Savoy Hotel, free,
ultimately, to remake the war in Arabia to his own image.</p>
