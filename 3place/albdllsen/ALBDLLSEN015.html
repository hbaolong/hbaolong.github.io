<p>Never doubt Great Britain’s word. She is wise and trustworthy; have
no fear.</p>
<p>KING HUSSEIN TO HIS SON FAISAL, MAY 1917</p>
<p>His Sherifial Majesty [King Hussein] evidently suffers from the
defects of character and ignorance of system common to Oriental
potentates.… The task of guiding an Oriental ruler or government in the
way they should go is no light one—as I know to my cost—and you have my
fullest sympathy. It must be heartbreaking work at times.</p>
<p>REGINALD WINGATE TO CYRIL WILSON, JULY 20, 1917</p>
<p>It was a moment when the awful burden of leadership fell upon
Lawrence as if a great weight, reminiscent of what had occurred in Wadi
Kitan two months earlier. Then, the mantle of authority had required him
to execute a man. Now it required him to try to save one, but quite
possibly to lose his own life in the effort.</p>
<p>It was midmorning on May 24, his party’s fifth day in El Houl. Arabic
for “the Terror,” El Houl is a vast trackless and waterless expanse in
northern Arabia empty of even the smallest signs of life, and Lawrence
had dreaded that leg of their journey to Syria ever since leaving Wejh.
Reality had been worse than the imagining. Within hours of entering El
Houl, the forty-five-man caravan had been buffeted by a ferocious
headwind, “a half-gale,” in Lawrence’s estimation, “so dry that our
shriveled lips cracked open, and the skin of our faces chapped.” The
wind, and the burning, blinding sand it kicked up, continued almost
without pause for the next four days.</p>
<p>To endure in such situations, humans tend to retreat into a kind of
closed-off mental state, their entire focus honed to simply trying to
reach the end. Such was the case with Lawrence and Auda’s party in El
Houl, so much so that on the morning of May 24, no one seemed to take
note of the riderless camel padding alongside the others. Perhaps they
assumed she was one of the baggage camels that traditionally lagged
behind, or that her rider had switched to another camel and was to be
found elsewhere along their extended line. Most likely, in their
semihibernative states they simply couldn’t be roused to care. When
finally Lawrence investigated the mysterious camel, he discovered it was
the mount of Gasim.</p>
<p>“A fanged and yellow-faced outlaw,” Gasim was a native of the Syrian
city of Maan, and Lawrence had brought him along on the trek in hopes
that he might make contact with other Arab nationalists in his hometown.
Of course, this also made Gasim an outsider among the traveling Howeitat
and Ageyl tribesmen and, in the harsh code of the desert, just as
friendless in a crisis as the condemned Hamed had been at Wadi Kitan. As
Lawrence recounted, Gasim’s status now “shifted the difficulty to my
shoulders.”</p>
<p>Perhaps indicative of the stress El Houl had put on his own reasoning
skills, Lawrence made a most foolhardy decision, not only to go back
alone in search of Gasim, but not even to tell the others he was doing
so. Within a very short distance, he discovered, all trace of their path
had vanished, the camels’ tracks in the sand swept away by the scouring
wind, and then the caravan itself receded until it was lost in the murk.
To somehow find Gasim and then return to the caravan, Lawrence could
only rely on the compass readings he’d periodically noted in his diary
and trust he hadn’t erred.</p>
<p>It was fifteen days since they had set out. In Bedouin tradition, a
number of tribal chiefs, including Faisal, had accompanied them the
first few miles out of Wejh by way of farewell, and then the forty-five
or so travelers had headed off into the northeastern darkness, the last
anyone in the Hejaz would hear of them for over two months.</p>
<p>They traveled light. Along with a few rifles and 20,000 gold
sovereigns—to be disbursed among Syrian tribal leaders they hoped to win
to the rebel cause—each man carried in his saddlebags some forty-five
pounds of flour. That and water would be their staples until they
reached their initial staging ground, the Wadi Sirhan depression on the
Syrian frontier, in an estimated three weeks’ time.</p>
<p>Despite being struck by a new round of fever and boils, Lawrence
would recall the first days of that journey in almost idyllic terms, the
beginning of a great adventure. It was also during this time that there
occurred one of the more intriguing side stories to his time in Arabia,
the account of how he came to obtain his two camp orderlies, given the
names Daud and Farraj in Seven Pillars (their actual names were Ali and
Othman).</p>
<p>It occurred during a day of idleness when, as Lawrence rested his
weary boil-covered body in the shadow of a rock escarpment, a young boy
rushed up beseeching his help. Having fled from a nearby Ageyl
encampment, Daud offered that his best friend, Farraj, was about to be
severely beaten by the camp commander for accidentally burning down a
tent; a word from Lawrence, the boy suggested, might stay the
punishment. That theory was discredited when Lawrence took the matter up
with the passing Ageyl camp commander, Saad, a few moments later.
Explaining that the two boys were constantly getting into trouble and
that an example had to be made, Saad instead offered a Solomon-like
solution in deference to Lawrence’s appeal: Daud could halve his
friend’s punishment by submitting to the other half himself. “Daud
leaped at the chance,” Lawrence wrote, “kissed my hand and Saad’s and
ran off up the valley.”</p>
<p>In Seven Pillars, Lawrence would strongly suggest that the
Farraj-Daud relationship was a sexual one, describing it as “an instance
of the eastern boy-and-boy affection which the segregation of women made
inevitable.” In the process, Lawrence was to add to speculations—still a
point of heated debate in some circles nearly a century later—about his
own sexuality. Much of that speculation stems from his description of
the “two bent figures, with pain in their eyes, but crooked smiles upon
their lips,” who showed up at his camp the next morning and begged to be
taken on as his servants:</p>
<p>“These were Daud the hasty and his love-fellow, Farraj, a beautiful,
soft-framed, girlish creature, with innocent smooth face and swimming
eyes.” After first trying to turn the boys away, explaining he had no
need of servants, Lawrence finally relented, “mainly because they looked
so young and clean.” From that day on, the mischievous antics of Daud
and Farraj would provide lighthearted relief to Lawrence’s travels.</p>
<p>But already in these early days of the journey, the party faced a
worrisome problem. Virtually all their camels, both the baggage and
mounted ones, suffered from the virulent mange endemic to Wejh, and
without even the rudimentary unguents to control it—butter was a
traditional desert remedy—many were quickly going lame or mad from it.
The epidemic may have contributed to the deaths of two of the baggage
camels that, during a climb through a particularly narrow defile, lost
their footing and plunged to the rocks below. None of this bode well as
they came to the edge of El Houl.</p>
<p>“In all Faisal’s stud of riding-camels,” Lawrence noted, “there was
not one healthy. In our little expedition every camel was weakening
daily. [Auda’s chief lieutenant] Nasir was full of anxiety lest many
break down in the forced march before us and leave their riders stranded
in the desert.”</p>
<p>The torturous nature of the passage across El Houl was reflected in
the small pocket diary Lawrence carried. Instead of the voluminous notes
he normally kept on his travels, the few short fragments he managed
there grew steadily more disjointed, almost nonsensical. And then, on
the fifth day, Gasim disappeared.</p>
<p>In deciding to turn back for the lost man, Lawrence surely knew that
Gasim was probably already dead; for anyone caught out in El Houl
without shelter or water at that time of year, life expectancy could be
measured in terms of hours. He surely also knew that if he’d made the
slightest miscalculation in his compass readings, he too would soon
expire. Still, he persevered—and finally, he was lucky. After an hour
and a half of riding, he spotted a small black object in the far
distance, an object that, as he approached, took the form of a
staggering and delirious Gasim. Hoisting the man onto the back of his
own camel, Lawrence turned and raced to find the others.</p>
<p>In David Lean’s epic film, the rescue of Gasim would be immortalized
in a ten-minute scene, culminating in Lawrence finally rejoining his
comrades to their relieved and raucous cheers, his noble act cementing
his image as a true “son of the desert.” The reality was quite
different. By the code of this brutal landscape, Gasim had brought his
death upon himself by having failed to secure his camel when he stopped
to relieve himself, and, rather than praised, Lawrence was berated by
some of his comrades for having risked his life for one clearly so
worthless. Furthermore, the caravan commander now administered another
beating to Daud and Farraj for letting Lawrence go back alone.</p>
<p>ON MAY 26, 1917, two days after Lawrence’s rescue of Gasim, King
George V and his War Cabinet received some gladdening news. It came in
the form of a top-secret cable from Reginald Wingate in Cairo, a report
on Mark Sykes’s latest triumphant visit to Arabia.</p>
<p>Following on Sykes’s earlier solo visit, he and his French diplomatic
counterpart, François Georges-Picot, had recently met with King Hussein
in Jeddah in hopes of thrashing out a settlement between the Arabs and
the French over the future status of Syria. Since their desires were
almost diametrically opposed—Hussein still insisting that postwar Syria
be part of a greater independent Arab nation, the French just as
insistent that it come under French control—there had been little
expectation of success. The first day’s session confirmed this
prognosis. After a tense three-hour confrontation on May 19, Picot and
Hussein had parted ways even more intransigent than before.</p>
<p>It came as a shock, therefore, when the following morning Hussein had
his interpreter read aloud to the European envoys a bold proposal: the
king was now ready to accept the same future French role in the
“Moslem-Syrian littoral”—presumably meaning the coastal, Lebanon portion
of Syria—as the British were to assume in the Iraqi province of Baghdad.
Since a victorious British army had recently placed Baghdad under
military occupation, and the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement called
for keeping the province under direct British control indefinitely, this
Baghdad-Lebanon equation of Hussein’s had the effect of suddenly ceding
to the French most everything they were asking for in Lebanon. As Sykes
reported to Wingate with what could only have been gross understatement,
“Monsieur Picot received this very well and relations became
cordial.”</p>
<p>It was a remarkable achievement. Against all odds, Sykes had managed
to make a crucial first cut through the great Gordian knot created by
Britain’s conflicting pacts and promises in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Yet for those familiar with Sykes’s modus operandi there was
something about this breakthrough that should have given pause. In
contrast to his usual prolixity on all manner of topics, his full report
on the Jeddah meetings, the most important diplomatic discussions
between the Allies and King Hussein to date, ran a mere four pages, with
Hussein’s startling Lebanon concession dealt with in a single sentence.
Additionally, neither Sykes nor Picot had pressed Hussein to commit his
offer to paper, nor had they managed to obtain a copy of the pledge the
king’s interpreter had read aloud. Even those senior officials in the
French Ministry of Foreign Affairs who had been fervently wishing for
just such a resolution quickly began to suspect there was something
altogether too neat about the deal struck in Jeddah.</p>
<p>Those concerns took tangible form when Stewart Newcombe arrived in
Cairo on May 27 and walked into Gilbert Clayton’s office. Both he and
Cyril Wilson had been present for at least some of the proceedings in
Jeddah, and had written up their own accounts of what had taken place.
Newcombe also brought the written account of Fuad al-Kutab, Hussein’s
interpreter and the man who had actually presented the proposal. While
they differed in specifics, all three indicated it had actually been
Mark Sykes, not Hussein, who had first come up with the Lebanon-Baghdad
formula. More troubling, the king appeared to have come away with a
radically different idea from the Allied envoys of what that formula
meant.</p>
<p>The most exercised over the matter was Cyril Wilson. “Although Sykes
and Picot were very pleased at this happy result,” he wrote, “and the
Sherif had made the [Lebanon-Baghdad] proposition himself, I did not
feel happy in my own my mind, and it struck me as possible that the
Sherif, one of the most courteous of men, absolutely loyal to me and
with complete faith in Great Britain, was verbally agreeing to a thing
which he never would agree to if he knew our interpretation of what the
Iraq situation is to be.”</p>
<p>In his distressed—and rather repetitive—twelve-page letter to
Clayton, Wilson detailed how he had repeatedly pressed Sykes to clarify
exactly what Hussein intended by the offer, only to have his concerns
brushed aside. Instead, Wilson reported, the entire affair had been
marked by a breezy refusal on Sykes’s part to get into particulars.</p>
<p>If less emotional, Newcombe’s protest was in many ways more striking.
His time in the Hejaz had been a difficult one, he had little faith in
the Arab rebels as a viable fighting force, and yet the episode in
Jeddah had left him perturbed. Central to his apprehensions was a
conversation he’d had with Hussein’s son Faisal, who had also been in
Jeddah during the envoys’ visit. In making his startling offer, Newcombe
reported, “[Hussein] stated to Faisal very vehemently that he was
perfectly willing to do this because Sir Mark Sykes, representing the
British government, had told him to, and that as Sir Mark Sykes had
advised him to leave everything in [his] hands, he felt glad to do so,
having absolute trust in the British government.”</p>
<p>From Newcombe’s vantage point as a British officer, this assurance by
Sykes, conjoined to Hussein’s obviously limited awareness of what he was
agreeing to, meant the British government now had a moral obligation to
see the Arab Revolt through to the end. “Otherwise we are hoodwinking
the Sherif and his people, and playing a very false game in which
[British] officers attached to the Sherif’s army are inevitably
committed, and which I know causes anxiety in several officers’ minds in
case we let them down.”</p>
<p>For all their unease, however, Wilson and Newcombe were either too
diplomatic to call Sykes out directly, or too credulous to piece the
whole scheme together. In actual fact, what had occurred in Jeddah was
not a potential misunderstanding, but an intricate and very cleverly
executed deception on Mark Sykes’s part.</p>
<p>The cornerstone for that deception had been laid three weeks earlier,
during Sykes’s first visit to Arabia. In his similarly spare report of
that trip, Sykes asserted that he had fully explained the Sykes-Picot
Agreement to Hussein and Faisal, and won their grudging acceptance.
While that wasn’t at all Faisal’s assessment of their meeting, the
British envoy could be confident that British officialdom would surely
take his word—a sitting member of Parliament and a baronet no less—over
that of an erratic Arab tribal chieftain and his warrior son. Of course,
there was at least one other person who knew that Sykes had lied about
his candor during that first trip, and whom British officialdom just
might listen to. This was T. E. Lawrence, but to Sykes’s good fortune,
Lawrence had now fallen from view, embarked on his northern trek, and he
remained totally incommunicado during Sykes’s crucial return visit to
Jeddah with Picot.</p>
<p>It seems Sykes was inspired to his master deception by pondering the
very issue that had made such a mess of the initial Picot-Hussein
meeting on May 19: Picot’s insistence that France enjoy the same role in
coastal Syria as the British were to assume in Baghdad. At the time,
Sykes had been deeply irritated by this linkage—he wanted to keep French
and British desiderata in the Middle East quite separate—and he had left
the discussions in a dispirited mood. However, once back on HMS
Northbrook, the British warship that had brought the envoys to Jeddah
and upon which they were staying, an obvious solution to his dilemma
apparently occurred to Sykes.</p>
<p>The reason Hussein was resisting the Lebanon-Baghdad linkage was
simply because he didn’t want any French presence anywhere, not because
he somehow knew Baghdad was slated to fall under permanent British
control. The only way Hussein could have known that was if Sykes had
told him of that clause in Sykes-Picot, and Sykes most certainly had
not.</p>
<p>Instead, the last word Hussein had on British intentions in Baghdad
was the vague accord he had reached with High Commissioner Henry McMahon
back in late 1915. In their back-and-forth correspondence, McMahon had
argued that, in light of Britain’s economic interests in Iraq, the
provinces of Basra and Baghdad would require “special administrative
arrangements” within the future Arab nation, implying some measure of
British control. In response, Hussein had offered to leave those
provinces under British administration “for a short time,” provided that
“a suitable sum [was] paid as compensation to the Arab kingdom for the
period of occupation.” From all this, Sykes surmised, Hussein still held
to the belief that any British presence in Iraq was to be along the
lines of a short-term leasing arrangement, but that those provinces’
ultimate inclusion in the greater independent Arab nation was secure.
Indeed, on several recent occasions, Hussein had enigmatically assured
his closest confidants, including both Faisal and Fuad al-Kutab, that he
had an ironclad British promise about Iraq’s future “in his pocket,”
even as he refused to show them the actual letters from McMahon.</p>
<p>To Sykes, it opened up a tantalizing prospect. Between Hussein’s
ignorance of Sykes-Picot, and Picot’s ignorance of the McMahon-Hussein
Correspondence, it might be possible to forge an agreement in which both
sides thought they were gaining the upper hand. The ultimate beauty
there was that with both sides believing they’d essentially tricked the
other, neither would want to risk scuttling the deal by getting into
specifics. On that same afternoon of May 19, Sykes sent an urgent
message ashore from the Northbrook asking that Fuad al-Kutab visit
him.</p>
<p>At that meeting, Sykes impressed on Fuad the need to limit Hussein’s
overtures on the following day to just two points. The first, little
more than a goodwill gesture, was for Hussein to announce that he would
withhold support from a group of Syrian exiles who were soon to embark
on an international lobbying campaign for Arab independence. The second,
and obviously vastly more important, was for Hussein to cede to the
Lebanon-Baghdad formula. To the nonplussed al-Kutab, Sykes was
reassuring, repeatedly telling the advisor to leave the matter in his
hands and he would see to everything.</p>
<p>Even so, Hussein was wary of agreeing to the plan. He finally
relented, al-Kutab related, because “he knows that Sir Mark Sykes can
fight for the Arabs better than he himself in political matters, and
knows that Sir Mark Sykes speaks with the authority of the British
government and will therefore be able to carry out his promises.”
Besides, Hussein reminded al-Kutab once more, he had “a letter from Sir
Henry McMahon which promises all I wish. This I know is alright, as the
British government will fulfill her word.”</p>
<p>The following morning, Fuad delivered Hussein’s proclamation as
directed. That afternoon, as the Northbrook sailed out of Jeddah harbor,
Georges-Picot could believe France had just been handed Lebanon, while
King Hussein could believe he had just maneuvered France into accepting
the future independence of all of Syria.</p>
<p>Even if not grasping the fraud that had been perpetrated, Wilson and
Newcombe were sufficiently appalled by Sykes’s cavalier approach to
demand a full accounting in their letters to Clayton. Wilson urged that
Sykes be compelled to put in writing what he believed had been agreed to
in Jeddah, and that Hussein be told precisely what British intentions
truly were. “If we are not going to see the Sherif through,” Wilson
wrote, “and we let him down badly after all his trust in us, the very
‘enviable’ post of Pilgrimage Officer at Jeddah will be vacant, because
I certainly could not remain.”</p>
<p>But when it came to political gamesmanship, the Arabs were not
necessarily rubes themselves. With his secret knowledge of the
Sykes-Picot Agreement, courtesy of Lawrence, Faisal was understandably
aghast at what his father had agreed to, and quickly sought to turn the
tables. On May 28, he issued a public proclamation to the Syrian people
calling them to arms in the cause of Arab independence, while heaping
praise on Great Britain for her aid in that mission. “Doubtless in doing
so,” Faisal wrote, “her sole object is to see in the world an
independent Arab government, established and administered by the Arabs,
without any modification of the boundaries of its country.” The French
came in for similar treatment. After thanking France for her past
contributions in Syria, Faisal noted that “we are deeply grateful to her
for having joined her Ally in recognizing our independence.”</p>
<p>Far from an accord, then, the real result of Sykes’s charade in
Jeddah was a deepening of the gulf between Arab and Allied aspirations
in the Middle East, a schism that was soon to have very ugly and lasting
repercussions. In the interim, British policymakers reverted to the
strategy they knew best: do nothing, see what comes next, and hope that
it all works out in the end. When asked about Faisal’s proclamation, so
at odds with the agreement ostensibly reached days earlier, Sykes
shrugged it off as a propaganda ploy meant for domestic Arab
consumption. When Clayton finally got around to taking Wilson’s and
Newcombe’s complaints to Sykes, it was with an escape clause built in.
“I do not attach very great importance to this,” he wrote of Hussein’s
apparent confusion, “as I think that events will be too strong for him
and that, in the end, he will have to fall in line, or fall out.”</p>
<p>One man who wouldn’t let things drop was the dogged Cyril Wilson. In
late June 1917, fully a month after he’d first sent his complaints to
Cairo and received no satisfaction, he wrote to Reginald Wingate’s
deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart Symes, urging that Sykes be made to
write out a “short statement of fact” on exactly what had been agreed to
at Jeddah. As Wilson pointedly noted, “there cannot be any harm in
writing a fact [sic] which Sir Mark Sykes, I understand, states he
clearly explained to the Sherif.”</p>
<p>But paper trails had already caused enough problems in the Middle
East, and Symes saw no reason to add to them. “The whole question is at
present in a state of flux,” he answered Wilson, “and depends entirely
on various developments in the war. It is therefore quite impossible to
lay down anything in the least definite, and all we can do is to keep
the various factions in play so far as possible until the situation
becomes more clear. It is a difficult position, I know, but there it
is.”</p>
<p>On a pathetic note, perhaps the stoutest defender of British honor in
the wake of the Jeddah meetings was the man most victimized by them,
King Hussein. Upon learning of the overture made on the decks of the
Northbrook, Faisal got into a heated argument with his father, until
Hussein finally cut him off with a rebuke: “These words are from a
father to his son. Never doubt Great Britain’s word. She is wise and
trustworthy; have no fear.”</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>IT WAS SUPPOSED to be a refuge, but Lawrence saw it very differently:
a place of torment and pestilence, a nightmarish landscape to be escaped
as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Running in a northwest-to-southeast diagonal through the borderlands
of Arabia and Syria (modern-day Jordan), the two-hundred-mile-long Wadi
Sirhan is more properly a geological depression, a
hundred-million-year-old narrow drainage valley for when this desolate
corner of the world had abundant water. In 1917, the wadi was where Auda
Abu Tayi arranged to have his Howeitat kinsmen assemble to meet the tiny
force he and Lawrence were bringing up from Wejh.</p>
<p>As Lawrence noted in Seven Pillars, with its ample water wells and
relative lushness, Wadi Sirhan should have seemed a veritable paradise
after their crossing of El Houl. Instead, at least two aspects made the
place barely tolerable. The first was its poisonous snakes. There were
horned vipers and puff adders and cobras, and they seemed to be
everywhere—tucked beneath rocks, draped on bushes, coiled at water’s
edge—and as a man with an almost phobic fear of snakes, Lawrence never
found a moment of true peace. Not that his fears were all that
irrational; within days of arriving in Wadi Sirhan, three of the men who
had made the passage from Wejh were dead from snakebites, and four
others nearly so. Neither did the local “remedy” inspire much
confidence, consisting as it did of binding a victim’s wound with
snakeskin plaster and then reciting Koranic verses over him until he
died.</p>
<p>Then there were the banquets. Wadi Sirhan constituted the lower
reaches of the domain of Nuri Shalaan, one of the most powerful tribal
chieftains of southern Syria, and Auda had immediately set off to meet
with Shalaan and gain his permission for the rebels’ presence there.
This left Lawrence to stand as one of the chief guests of honor at the
nightly feasts of rice and mutton put on by the gathered Howeitat clans.
As any westerner who has been their guest might attest, Bedouin
hospitality can be so overwhelming as to border on the oppressive, and
so it quickly became for Lawrence. Each night, different impoverished
families competed to play host to the travelers from Wejh, and in
Lawrence’s lavish description of these banquets, what starts out as
colorfully folkloric gradually veers toward the grotesque, especially
when he lingers on the image of swollen-bellied children gathered at the
periphery of the feasts, anxiously awaiting their chance to swoop in and
snatch up any leavings from the communal tray.</p>
<p>“The landscape was of a hopelessness and sadness deeper than all the
open deserts we had crossed,” Lawrence wrote. “Sand or flint or a desert
of bare rocks was exciting sometimes, and in certain lights had the
monstrous beauty of sterile desolation; but there was something
sinister, something actively evil in this snake-devoted Sirhan.”</p>
<p>But Lawrence’s torments went beyond reptiles and too much mutton. In
those quiet days of waiting, with more and more tribes coming in to
negotiate their alliance with the rebel emissaries, he became acutely
aware of the cloak of deception he wore.</p>
<p>It was a deception that operated on multiple levels. On the day they
had set out from Wejh, most of Lawrence’s companions knew only the
official reason for their journey: to rally the Syrian tribes and
prepare for Faisal’s advance north. Knowledge of the concrete objective,
the capture of Aqaba, was held by only a very small handful of men.
Indeed, it’s possible the full plan was known only to Lawrence, that
even Auda and Faisal hadn’t the complete picture.</p>
<p>His romantic reputation aside, Auda was essentially a desert raider
and, as such, primarily interested in plunder. Since there would be
precious little by way of loot in Aqaba, Lawrence may well have kept
matters vague at the outset, operating on the premise that at some point
during the expedition he could convince Auda that Aqaba’s capture would
serve his long-term interests better than whatever more obvious spoils
lay close to hand. As for Faisal, in the wake of Lawrence’s departure
from Wejh, he once again lobbied his British advisors for an early
advance on Aqaba. Perhaps this was a ruse on Faisal’s part, a way to
further mask Lawrence’s true destination from his colleagues, but it
seems equally likely that the Arab leader did so because he hadn’t been
apprised of precisely what that destination was. Of course, these were
mere tactical deceptions, made necessary by the exigencies of war, but
it meant the ultimate onus of leadership—not to mention of possible
failure and the catastrophe this would unleash on those around
him—rested on Lawrence’s shoulders alone.</p>
<p>What made all this infinitely more burdensome was the greater
deception that lay beyond: the planned betrayal of the Arabs at the
Allies’ hands. It seems Lawrence had only grasped the full scope of this
double cross at his meeting with Mark Sykes just before his departure
from Wejh, and it clearly weighed heavily on him on the journey north.
Of this, Lawrence obviously could confide even less in his traveling
companions, and his sense of guilt became overwhelming in the face of
the endless stream of tribal delegations coming into Wadi Sirhan to join
the fight for Arab independence.</p>
<p>“They saw in me a free agent of the British Government,” he wrote,
“and demanded from me an endorsement of its written promises. So I had
to join the conspiracy and, for what my word was worth, assured the men
of their reward.” It was a role that left Lawrence “continually and
bitterly ashamed,” for “it was evident from the beginning that if we won
the war, these promises would be dead paper, and had I been an honest
advisor of the Arabs, I would have advised them to go home and not risk
their lives fighting for such stuff.”</p>
<p>But of course Lawrence could do no such thing. As an alternative, he
chose to remove himself from the scene. “Can’t stand another day here,”
he jotted in his journal on June 5. “Will ride N[orth] and chuck
it.”</p>
<p>The choice of phrase, “chuck it,” was an interesting one, for what
Lawrence now proposed was a trek into the heart of Turkish-held Syria, a
journey so hazardous as to be practically suicidal. In Seven Pillars, he
would attempt to rationalize this decision by explaining that he wished
to venture into the north to “sound its opinions and learn enough to lay
definite plans. My general knowledge of Syria was fairly good, and some
parts I knew exactly, but I felt that one more sight of it would put
straight the ideas of strategic geography given me by the Crusades.”</p>
<p>Implicit in this quest was the hope, slender though it might be, that
if the Arab Revolt could be raised in the Syrian heartland, the
imperialist designs of France might yet be subverted. Pressing up
against this hope, though, was the far likelier outcome: that in revolt,
the Syrians would fight and die for a cause already lost.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s anguish at the situation was evident in the scribbled
message he wrote Gilbert Clayton in the margin of his notebook.
“Clayton. I’ve decided to go off alone to Damascus, hoping to get killed
on the way. For all sakes try and clear this show up before it goes any
further. We are calling them to fight for us on a lie, and I can’t stand
it.” Figuring the notebook would eventually find its way into British
hands should he die on his mission, Lawrence left the notebook in Wadi
Sirhan and set off for the north in the company of just two guides.</p>
<p>It was to be perhaps his most audacious exploit of the entire war, a
circuitous four-hundred-mile tour through enemy territory that carried
him to the border of Lebanon and to the very outskirts of Damascus. The
feat would win him a nomination for the Victoria Cross, Britain’s
highest military decoration, yet also endure as one of the most
mysterious and least-documented episodes in Lawrence’s life. This was
very deliberately so. The sole report he would eventually submit to his
superiors in Cairo recounting the odyssey would run to just four pages.
In Seven Pillars, a 650-page book studded with exhaustive disquisitions
on the flora and geological features of obscure desert basins,
Lawrence’s northern expedition is dispensed with in a few paragraphs and
derided “as barren of consequence as it was unworthy of motive.”</p>
<p>What is known about that journey is that, time and again, Lawrence
secretly met with prospective allies in the Arab Revolt—tribal leaders
and urban nationalists—only to be greeted with profound hesitation. It
was the classic conundrum of guerrilla warfare: Faisal’s rebels needed
local support to pave their way into Syria, but the locals couldn’t
reasonably be asked to rise up without the aid and armed support of the
rebels. In that riddle, and in how terribly wrong events could go if the
right balance wasn’t achieved, Lawrence felt the weight of his and
Britain’s deceit more keenly than ever.</p>
<p>From both a political and personally defining standpoint, Lawrence’s
most consequential encounter came toward the end of his journey, when he
stopped in Azraq, a desert oasis in southeastern Syria, to meet with
Emir Nuri Shalaan. Testament to Shalaan’s preeminence in the region, it
was to him that Auda Abu Tayi had sped weeks earlier seeking permission
to use Wadi Sirhan as a gathering point for his Howeitat tribesmen.
Since even before the Arab Revolt began, King Hussein had sent
emissaries to Shalaan in an attempt to win him and his vast Rualla tribe
to the cause, and for just as long the emir had nimbly danced along the
knife’s edge, hinting he might soon be ready to join the rebellion, only
to then nudge back toward the Ottoman side. It wasn’t just his authority
that made Shalaan an imposing figure, however; in Lawrence’s hand, the
chieftain appeared almost the spectral personification of death
itself:</p>
<p>“Very old, livid, and worn, with a gray sorrow and remorse upon him,
and a bitter smile the only mobility of his face. Upon his coarse
eyelashes the eyelids sagged down in tired folds, through which from the
overhead sun, a red light glittered into his eye sockets and made them
look like fiery pits in which the man was slowly burning.”</p>
<p>But perhaps this somewhat overwrought description stemmed from
something else about Nuri Shalaan. Despite his isolation in the desert,
it seemed the Rualla chieftain was well informed on the various promises
the British had made to Hussein and other Arab leaders in the Hejaz over
the previous two years. By way of taking Lawrence’s measure, Shalaan
brought out copies of these conflicting documents, laid them before his
visitor, and asked which ones he should believe. “I saw that with my
answer I would gain or lose him,” Lawrence recounted, “and in him the
outcome of the Arab movement.”</p>
<p>Lawrence counseled that Shalaan should trust in the most recent of
the British promises. It seemed to assuage the desert chieftain, but of
course simply brought a new measure of guilt to Lawrence’s burdened
conscience.</p>
<p>After that meeting with Shalaan, Lawrence returned to his companions
waiting in Wadi Sirhan with an iron resolve to compel Britain to uphold
her pledges to the Arabs. He would do so by personally leading the Arabs
onto an expanded Syrian battlefield, a campaign that would enable them
to lay claim to the lands they conquered and thus cheat the French of
their imperial designs. “In other words,” Lawrence wrote, “I presumed
(seeing no other leader with the will and power) that I would survive
the campaigns, and be able to defeat not merely the Turks on the
battlefield, but my own country and its allies in the
council-chamber.”</p>
<p>This was, he admitted, “an immodest presumption.”</p>
<p>LAWRENCE WASN’T THE only Western intelligence agent afoot in Syria
that June. In fact, at one point during his impetuous reconnaissance
trek to the north, he came within three miles of crossing paths with his
old nemesis, Curt Prüfer.</p>
<p>Since returning from Germany in March, Prüfer had rarely left the
comparative comfort of his desk job at the intelligence bureau
headquarters in Constantinople. The grand partnership of German
government and industry envisioned by Max von Oppenheim had largely
withered on the vine, with German businessmen understandably loath to
invest in a region grown more destitute and fractured by the day. Prüfer
had instead spent much of his time trying to arrange for the publication
of a new series of pro-German propaganda pamphlets, only to be beset
with niggling queries from Berlin over printing costs and bureaucratic
obstacles thrown up by obdurate Ottoman censors.</p>
<p>In mid-May, he decided to break from this tedious routine by
conducting an extended inspection tour of the German propaganda centers
and libraries that Oppenheim had established across Syria the year
before. These field trips were also what made Prüfer a good intelligence
agent, providing him with a firsthand view that often conflicted with
the sugarcoated communiqués and cables that crossed his desk. Even so,
on this outing he was in for a shock.</p>
<p>As often happens in war, by the spring of 1917 the outside world was
gaining a rather clearer picture of what was happening inside the
Ottoman Empire than the empire’s own inhabitants. Much of that insight
was coming from American consular officials who had begun vacating their
posts following the break in U.S.-Ottoman diplomatic relations in April.
In debriefings in Switzerland and Washington and London, these officials
told of a land where hundreds of thousands of civilians had succumbed to
disease or starvation, where vast territories were in a state of
near-open rebellion, and where army units suffered desertion rates of
25, 30, even 40 percent. The more perceptive of these recent evacuees
also reported on the growing friction between Turkish and German
military units, a mutual antipathy that had occasionally led to
violence, and of the general population’s utter apathy, their most
fervent desire simply for the war to end and life to become tolerable
again.</p>
<p>Certainly, Prüfer had received glimmers of all this while in
Constantinople. Even if downplayed, reports from the field told of food
shortages and epidemics, of flagging morale among both the Turkish
citizenry and soldiers. But none of that truly prepared Prüfer for the
ravages awaiting him when he boarded an interior-bound train at Haidar
Pasha station on May 21. Most telling from Prüfer’s standpoint were the
deprivations he personally had to endure on this journey. Gone were the
special train cars put on for his comfort and the official banquets held
in his honor. Instead, and despite being one of the most important
German officials in the Middle East, his travel now was aboard packed
and dilapidated trains that frequently broke down or were shunted to
sidings for hours, even days, for no apparent reason, the only
accommodation to be found in filthy and flea-infested hostels. The spare
diary he kept of that two-month odyssey, brief entries made in a
penciled scrawl, consisted of an almost unbroken litany of
complaint.</p>
<p>Adding to Prüfer’s misery, and rather epitomizing the ruin about him,
was an intermittent toothache that steadily worsened until his entire
jaw was inflamed. A dentist tentatively diagnosed scurvy, a disease now
rampant in Syria and caused by a simple vitamin C deficiency. Until two
years earlier Syria had been one of the great citrus-growing regions of
the world, but in the face of a chronic coal shortage most of its fruit
trees had been cut down to provide fuel for train engines.</p>
<p>Yet despite seeing all this with his own eyes, Curt Prüfer seemed
determined to miss its import. As he reported to senior diplomats in
Berlin, the reason his and Max Oppenheim’s shared dream of pan-Islamic
jihad had thus far failed to galvanize the Muslim masses was mostly just
a matter of poor communication. “Hysterical propaganda that focuses on
enemy atrocities are a waste of time,” he wrote. “The peoples of the
Turkish empire aren’t stupid, they know what is going on around
them.”</p>
<p>Even with his criticisms, however, Prüfer failed to detect the
fissures already cracked open all about him. He had frequently written
that the Syrian Arabs were too cowardly to rise up against the Turks,
and nothing he saw on this journey caused him to reassess that view. On
June 3, while Prüfer was in Damascus, T. E. Lawrence was in a village a
mere three miles away, plotting with an Arab nationalist leader on how
to bring the Arab Revolt into the Syrian capital. Prüfer had been even
more dismissive of the Jewish settlers in Palestine, calling them docile
and obedient. June 12 saw the German intelligence chief staying at a
crude little hotel in the Palestinian village of Zammarin, just one mile
from the Jewish settlement of Zichron Yaakov that was the hub of the
NILI spy network.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>SARAH AARONSOHN’S VISIT to Cairo in mid-April had been planned as a
very brief one, a chance to meet with her brother and for the two of
them to coordinate NILI’s activities for the coming months. On the next
sailing of the Managem, Sarah and her chief NILI deputy, Joseph
Lishansky, were to be slipped back ashore at Athlit and the spying
campaign resumed. Instead, there had ensued such a string of bad
luck—two abortive sailings, a bout of malaria that landed Sarah in a
hospital for two weeks—that it seemed an open question whether she and
Lishansky would ever get home at all. By the end of May, the pair were
right back at their Egyptian starting point.</p>
<p>If Aaron Aaronsohn was understandably frustrated by these delays—he
had never intended Joseph Lishansky to leave Athlit in the first place,
and the spy network was surely foundering in both his and Sarah’s
absence—he was also experiencing a bit of a change of heart. A loner at
the best of times, he nevertheless enjoyed his sister’s companionship in
Cairo and was coming to rely on her levelheaded advice in his battles
with the British bureaucracy. He now decided it would be cruel to return
her to Athlit after all. “I do not see the necessity of it,” he confided
in his diary on May 31, “now that the most precious time is past.”</p>
<p>Convincing the iron-willed Sarah Aaronsohn of this, however, was an
altogether different matter. When her brother broached the idea, her
response was immediate and adamant: she was going back to Palestine no
matter what. The agronomist tried a different tack. During her stay in
Cairo, Sarah had become a familiar figure to many of the British
officers her brother associated with, an object of admiration for the
very dangerous work she was conducting. At the same time, some of these
officers, imbued with an old-fashioned code of chivalry, had hinted to
Aaron Aaronsohn that it was a tad unseemly for a woman to continue to
face such “manly” perils. This view was most persistently put forward by
Aaronsohn’s erstwhile handler, William Edmonds, and Aaronsohn arranged
for the EMSIB captain to raise it anew one evening while he and Sarah
sat in the lounge of the Continental Hotel.</p>
<p>“Madam,” Edmonds stiffly addressed Sarah, “the High Command has
authorized me to thank you very much for all that you have done for us.
They urge you not to return to Palestine. Egypt is open to you. You can
stay here as long as you wish. What you have done up to now is valuable,
and it is enough.”</p>
<p>While thanking the captain for the offer, Sarah Aaronsohn instantly
saw through the charade. Turning to her brother, she said, “If you know
me, give me the means to return. If you don’t provide them for me, I’ll
find my way back myself.”</p>
<p>On June 15, the spy ship Managem sailed once more. This time it
managed to reach Athlit, and both Sarah Aaronsohn and Joseph Lishansky
went ashore. When Aaron Aaronsohn got the word, it provoked a
complicated reaction, relief and regret intermixed. As events would
prove, this latter sentiment was quite justified; he would never see
either his sister or Lishansky again.</p>
<p>ON THEIR FAST racing camels, Auda and Lawrence set off ahead of the
others to inspect the water wells of Bair. Following behind was the
fighting force that had been painstakingly assembled in Wadi Sirhan over
the previous three weeks: some five hundred tribal fighters, mostly
Howeitat, ready to strike a blow against their Turkish overlords. All
had left Wadi Sirhan two days before, June 18, in the highest of
spirits.</p>
<p>As a consequence, what Auda and Lawrence discovered at Bair was
deeply dispiriting. All three of the oasis’s principal wells had
recently been dynamited by the Turks, reduced to heaps of broken stones
and still-smoldering timbers. By good luck, the charge they had placed
on a fourth well a short distance away had failed to detonate, affording
the rebel force just enough water to sustain themselves and their
camels, but the larger message was a grim one: the Turks were onto
them.</p>
<p>While it might seem counterintuitive, the desert is one of the more
difficult places to keep one’s presence a secret. Travelers are wedded
to moving between available sources of water, and on a landscape where
others are also constantly on the move, crossing a desert is rather akin
to traveling a highway possessed of very few side roads. Among the
tribes of southeastern Syria, a great many had heard of the rebel force
being mustered in Wadi Sirhan by that third week in June, and
inevitably, so had the Turks. By blowing the wells at Bair, the first
principal water source west of Wadi Sirhan, the Turks hoped to block
their enemy’s advance before it even got under way.</p>
<p>While that mission had failed just enough to allow the rebels and
their animals to stay alive in Bair, it cast grave doubt over the next
proposed leg of their march. Seventy miles to the southwest of Bair
stood the crossroads town of Maan, astride the Hejaz Railway and the
strategic hub of the entire region. Lawrence’s plan was to skirt below
the heavily garrisoned town and continue toward Aqaba, but this scheme
was dependent on finding water at Jefer, another series of desert wells
just twenty-five miles to the northeast of Maan. The problem was that
once the Turks in Maan figured out the rebels were heading for Aqaba—and
at this point even “the most civilian owl could not fail to see
that”—they could send a demolition team out to destroy the Jefer wells
long before the rebels got there.</p>
<p>The key, then, was to devise a screen, to confuse the Turks both as
to where the rebels currently were and where they might be headed. From
Bair, emissaries were sent to area tribes with word that the rebel force
was still organizing itself back in Wadi Sirhan; surely at least one of
these tribes would pass this “intelligence” on to the Turks to curry
favor. Simultaneously, small units of fighters were dispatched to
conduct pinprick attacks throughout the region.</p>
<p>Lawrence had laid some of the groundwork for this screen during his
earlier trip north. In early June, he had led a handful of local
recruits and blown up a small bridge of the Hejaz Railway north of
Damascus; that attack, occurring hundreds of miles from any previous
action by the rebels, had so alarmed Turkish authorities that they’d
briefly been convinced a local insurrection was about to get under way.
For the expanded screening operation out of Bair, Lawrence chose to lead
the most ambitious effort himself. On June 21, he and some one hundred
fighters struck out from the oasis and made for the railhead town of
Amman, 150 miles to the north.</p>
<p>It was to be a peculiar kind of exercise, and one that constantly put
Lawrence’s skills of persuasion to the test. Time and again, he had to
stay his Arab companions from the pitched battles they desperately
craved, reminding them this was meant to be a show of force, a game of
bluff in which a destroyed railway culvert sent just as powerful a
message to the enemy as a blown‑up train. This wasn’t at all the way the
Arab tribesmen thought battle should be joined, but as they were scant
in number and dependent on mobility, Lawrence was determined that they
avoid protracted firefights or anything else that might delay their
quick return to Bair. This imperative of speed, however, also had a
nasty side effect; simply put, this was a force with neither the time
nor the capacity to deal with prisoners.</p>
<p>While preparing the ambush on the Turkish garrison at Aba el Naam
three months earlier, Lawrence and his companions had been inadvertently
discovered by a wandering shepherd boy. Fearing the boy would alert the
Turks to their presence if released, but with the shepherd increasingly
distraught at being separated from his flock, the ambush party had
finally resorted to a somewhat comical solution: they tied the boy to a
tree for the duration of the battle, then cut him free as they fled. In
their hit-and-run operations around Amman, the raiders hadn’t the luxury
of such consideration.</p>
<p>On one occasion, they encountered a traveling Circassian merchant.
Unable to take him along as a prisoner but reluctant to let him go— most
Circassians were Turkish sympathizers—many in the raiding party argued
for his quick execution. By way of compromise, they instead stripped the
man naked and sliced the soles of his feet open with a dagger. “Odd as
was the performance,” Lawrence noted mildly, “it seemed effective and
more merciful than death. The cuts would make him travel to the railway
on hands and knees, a journey of an hour, and his nakedness would keep
him in the shadow of the rocks till the sun was low.” While the
Circassian’s ultimate fate is unknown, the merciful aspects of leaving a
naked and crippled man out in the Syrian desert in June might reasonably
be debated.</p>
<p>By the time the raiding party returned to Bair, Lawrence had every
reason to feel confident. In response to their disinformation effort,
the Turks had just dispatched a four-hundred-man cavalry unit to hunt
down the phantom rebel force in Wadi Sirhan. Over the previous week, the
Arabs had carried out a series of hit-and-run strikes across the length
of southern Syria with no discernible pattern. By now, the Turks surely
thought the next attack could come most anywhere, and were distracted
from the still-distant target of Aqaba. With such confidence, the rebel
force moved on the water wells of Jefer.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the Turks had destroyed the Jefer wells too, but with
only slightly more efficiency than they’d shown at Bair. One of the
wells was only partially collapsed, and a daylong repair effort restored
it to use. While that project was under way, Lawrence received the most
remarkable news of all.</p>
<p>A few days earlier, a flying column had been sent to rally the tribes
residing in the foothills to the southwest of Maan and in the direction
of Aqaba. Together, they had attacked the Turkish blockhouse at Fuweila,
occupying a high point astride the Maan-Aqaba road. Initially that
attack had accomplished little, the tribesmen easily driven off by the
entrenched soldiers, but then the Turks in Fuweila had launched a
reprisal raid. Falling on a nearby Howeitat settlement, they had cut the
throats of everyone they found: one old man and a dozen women and
children. Blind with rage, the Arab warriors had renewed their assault
on the Fuweila blockhouse, overrun it, and slaughtered every soldier
within. As a result, one of the chief Turkish strongpoints on the Aqaba
road was suddenly gone, the path over the mountains virtually clear.
Scrambling to action, the rebel force in Jefer raced for Fuweila.</p>
<p>Their excitement was to be short-lived. As they skirted below Maan on
the afternoon of July 1, word came that a relief force of some 550
Turkish soldiers had left Maan en route to Fuweila that morning. That
force was now somewhere on the road ahead of them.</p>
<p>It placed Lawrence in a deep quandary. With their greater mobility,
the Arabs might be able to get ahead of the relief column and continue
on toward Aqaba, but that would mean leaving a sizable Turkish force,
already on the march, close behind them on the Wadi Itm trail—in effect,
almost the precise scenario that Lawrence had persistently warned would
be the result of an amphibious landing. There really was only one
choice: to find the Turkish relief column and destroy it.</p>
<p>IT HAD BEEN nearly four years since William Yale sailed from New York
harbor aboard SS Imperator, a “playboy” embarked on a tour of the Holy
Land should any of his fellow passengers ask. Now, in mid-June 1917, he
was returning to a city in the grips of a patriotic frenzy. Across
Manhattan, buildings were festooned with enormous American flags,
windows were framed with red-white-and-blue bunting, and a fevered
excitement still carried on the air two months after President Wilson
had brought the country into the war.</p>
<p>One reason for the sustained excitement may have been that it was
still a long way off before war’s more disagreeable
aspects—specifically, dead and maimed soldiers—would begin to intrude on
the festivities. Since 1914, Wilson had deliberately kept the American
army near its paltry peacetime size as a roundabout way to defeat the
interventionists; after all, with a standing army of just over 120,000
soldiers, about one-twentieth the size of any of the major European
powers, what could the United States possibly contribute to the war
effort? Most estimates were that it would be up to a year before an
American army—now slated to grow to well over one million—might
contribute to the European battlefield in any significant way.</p>
<p>Further slowing matters was evidence that, beyond the flag-waving,
the American public was showing a marked hesitancy in signing on for the
fighting and dying. Wilson had been under the impression that his
high-blown rhetoric alone would serve to bring a flood of volunteers to
the army recruitment centers, but it seems most of his countrymen got
lost somewhere between his old boast that the United States was “too
proud to fight” and his new exhortation that “the world must be made
safe for democracy.” By mid-May 1917, fewer than 100,000 young men had
enlisted for this crusade, leading to the enactment of a draft law for
the first time since the American Civil War. Consequently, when Yale
stepped off his ship in New York harbor that June, one of his first
errands was to register with the local Selective Service board.</p>
<p>The oilman could have harbored few illusions about what lay in store
for him—as a twenty-nine-year-old single man with no dependents,
draftees didn’t come any more Class I than William Yale—and it was a
prospect that filled him with dread. Part of it was that, as opposed to
most of his countrymen, he had already seen the hideous face of modern
war—not the slaughter in the trenches in France, but the equally
grotesque spectacle of civilians dying en masse from starvation and
disease in Syria. He’d observed subtler facets of it during his long
slow journey across southern Europe to get home: the bread lines that
had stretched for blocks in Vienna, the looks of crushing resignation
among a company of French soldiers waiting on a train platform for
transport to the front. He also undoubtedly saw exactly where military
induction would take him. Perched as he was at the upper end of
conscription age (thirty in May 1917, raised to forty-five just three
months later), in combination with his college education and
aristocratic pedigree, he would almost surely be shunted into an
officer-training academy. Once there, given his business background and
technical expertise, he would just as surely be further shunted along to
the supply-and-logistics orbit of the quartermaster’s office. And since
the United States had only declared war on Germany, meaning practically
everyone was to be sent to the Western Front, Yale would most likely
spend his war “career” ticking off checklists at some supply depot well
behind the lines in rural France.</p>
<p>This was not at all the future that the ambitious oilman saw for
himself, and he was brash enough to believe that the four years he’d
just spent in the Ottoman Empire might make him an attractive candidate
for a more meaningful position somewhere in the governmental or military
hierarchy. After spending a mere weekend at the Yale family’s upstate
New York retreat, reuniting with the parents and siblings he hadn’t seen
since 1913, William Yale returned to New York City and hit the
hustings.</p>
<p>The result was demoralizing. Despite his calling on every business
and college acquaintance he could think of, few had any suggestions for
where an “Eastern hand” might fit into the larger scheme of things in a
nation at war. He called on Socony headquarters at 26 Broadway, figuring
that though their Middle Eastern operations were likely to remain
suspended for the conflict’s duration, they might find something else
overseas for an employee who had served them so loyally and in such
difficult circumstances. That plan fell through when, meeting with one
of the Socony directors, the pugnacious Yale lambasted the company’s
recent decision to stop paying the salaries of their native employees in
the Middle East, pointing out that this pittance for a corporation like
Socony was life-sustaining for those trapped in the war zone. Alas, Yale
discovered after being ordered from the office, his listener had been
the author of that directive.</p>
<p>Despairing of finding anything in New York, he went to Washington,
D.C., sustained by the thought that in the locus of power, surely
someone would appreciate what he had to offer. As his calling card, Yale
wrote up a detailed report on all he had seen and heard in Syria. “Three
years of war,” he wrote, “have reduced Palestine to a deplorable
condition, the villages depleted by military drafts, devastated by
cholera, typhus and recurrent fever, and typhoid has resulted in
reducing the population [by] probably over 25%.” The situation was even
worse in Lebanon, he reported, where, according to one of his Turkish
military informants, at least 30,000 civilians had already starved to
death, and unconfirmed rumors put the figure at over 100,000.</p>
<p>Of possibly greater interest to his prospective readers was the
oilman’s attention to military matters. Yale had clearly put his long
rail journey from Jerusalem to Constantinople to good use, listing a
number of critical bridges and embankments along the line that, if
bombed, would all but cripple the Turks’ ability to bring supplies or
reinforcements from Anatolia to Syria or Iraq. He also pinpointed the
location of an array of critical German military installations along the
route, including a wireless relay station in the Amanus Mountains made
conspicuous by the Swiss chalet-style German barracks alongside it. “I
saw also German aeroplanes and hospital units going south. One German
aeroplane division of twenty-three aeroplanes, I was informed by the
German captain in charge, was on its way to Beersheva.” He was even able
to report that between 150 and 200 German transport trucks were now
carrying supplies to Turkish forces in southern Palestine “over a new
military road which connects Jerusalem, Hebron and Beersheba,” while
tactfully omitting that this was the same road on which he had overseen
construction for Standard Oil in 1914.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Allied officials had started to glean something of
conditions inside the Ottoman Empire from debriefings of the evacuated
American consular officers, but these were nothing compared to William
Yale’s report. Even if three months out of date, it represented one of
the most detailed and reliable analyses of the situation in Syria to
emerge since the beginning of the war. On June 27, Yale strode into the
State, War and Navy Building (now the Old Executive Office Building)
next to the White House and dropped his report off at the offices of the
secretary of state himself, Robert Lansing. He followed up with a
personal letter to Lansing three days later.</p>
<p>After noting that “the disposition of Palestine will probably be one
of the big questions to be decided” in any postwar peace conference,
Yale suggested to the secretary that “if the United States of America is
to play her part in the solution of a problem so intricate and
important, her statesmen must have at their disposition reports of
unbiased men who had a first-hand knowledge of the country and its
people. It is for such service, whether it be in diplomatic or secret
service work, or relief work in Palestine, that I am prepared to resign
my present position with the Standard Oil Company of New York, and offer
my services to the Government of the United States.”</p>
<p>Perhaps his four years abroad left Yale blind to the complexity—to
some minds, the hypocrisy—of the new Wilson doctrine. Yes, the American
president fully intended to impose his notion of “a lasting peace” on
the warring world—that had been his price for entering the conflict—but,
reflective of his nation’s isolationist core, this was to be done while
involving the United States in as few long-term foreign entanglements as
possible. As a consequence, the very item Yale imagined to be his ace in
the hole, his expertise in enabling the United States to “play her part”
in the Middle East, was exactly the sort of thing the Wilson
administration hoped to avoid. Little surprise, then, that his overture
to Lansing was met with a resounding silence. The baffled oilman then
drew on an old Yale University contact to funnel his report to the head
of the U.S. Army’s Intelligence Department, only to meet the same
response.</p>
<p>Out of desperation, Yale played what must have seemed his very last
card. During his journey across Europe that spring, he had met with the
British military attaché to Switzerland and asked about the possibility
of joining on with British military intelligence. The attaché had not
been at all encouraging but, impressed by Yale’s breadth of knowledge on
the Middle East, suggested that if no other options presented themselves
once he returned home, Yale might call on the British ambassador to
Washington, Cecil Spring-Rice. With the military attaché’s note of
introduction in hand, Yale did so on the morning of July 9.</p>
<p>Serendipity had an odd way of intervening at crucial moments in
William Yale’s life, but never in quite so unlikely a way as on July 9.
In calling at the British embassy, Yale fully expected to be told the
ambassador was away or in a meeting, the same brush-off he’d received
from many other men far less busy or powerful over the previous month.
Instead, he was immediately ushered into Spring-Rice’s office.</p>
<p>“Where did you get your name?” the astonished ambassador asked by way
of greeting. “My first wife was a Yale, one of the last members of the
family in Wales!”</p>
<p>IT WAS LESS a battle than a massacre. As dawn of July 2 broke, the
Arab warriors circled through the hills surrounding the pass at Fuweila
in cautious search of the Turkish relief battalion. They found them in a
mountain close just below Fuweila known as Aba el Lissan, encamped and
still asleep along the banks of a stream. Incredibly, the Turkish
commander hadn’t taken the precaution of putting scouts on the
surrounding ridgelines, enabling the Arabs to quietly spread out among
the overhanging rocks and encircle their slumbering enemy. Once in
position, they began to snipe at the men trapped below.</p>
<p>It became a ferociously hot day, the hottest Lawrence could ever
remember in Arabia, and this greatly contributed to the desultory nature
of the fight. Despite the overwhelming advantage afforded by their
command of the heights, the Arab attackers found they could only lie
upon the rocks to shoot down at the enemy for a few moments at a time;
to linger any longer was to be burned through their thin robes, even to
have skin peeled from their bodies in swatches. Into the afternoon, the
erratic contest continued, the Turks below huddling in clefts along the
stream for protection, the Arabs above them hopping from one overlook to
the next in search of a clean shot.</p>
<p>By Lawrence’s account, it was a flippant comment on his part that
finally changed the battle’s tenor. Overcome by the heat, he had sought
refuge in the shade of a narrow gulley that also offered up a thin
rivulet of water. He was found there by Auda Abu Tayi.</p>
<p>“Well, how is it with the Howeitat?” Auda teased, recalling
Lawrence’s past gibes at his tribesmen. “All talk and no work?”</p>
<p>Lawrence teased back, remarking that the Howeitat “shoot a lot and
hit a little.”</p>
<p>The remark seemed to enrage the chieftain. Flinging his headgear to
the ground, he charged back up the hill shouting for his men to
disengage and to take to their horses waiting below. Fearing his comment
had so offended Auda that the Howeitat were now leaving the fight,
Lawrence clambered up the slope to make amends. He found Auda standing
alone and glowering down at the enemy. “Get your camel if you want to
see the old man’s work,” Auda said.</p>
<p>Hurrying down to the protected hollow where the main camel-mounted
Arab force had waited all day to make their charge into Aba el Lissan,
Lawrence mounted his prized camel, Naama, and climbed to a nearby ridge.
He was just in time to see Auda and his fifty Howeitat horsemen charge
into the valley from an adjacent ridge at full gallop.</p>
<p>“As we watched,” Lawrence recalled in Seven Pillars, “two or three
[Howeitat] went down, but the rest thundered forward at marvelous speed,
and the Turkish infantry, huddled together under the cliff ready to cut
their desperate way out towards Maan in the first dusk, began to sway in
and out, and finally broke before the rush.”</p>
<p>The 350 camel troops were swiftly ordered forward as well. Among the
Turkish infantrymen, trapped and exhausted and now being charged by a
mounted enemy from two sides, any semblance of defense swiftly
collapsed. Suddenly, it was every man for himself, and in Aba el Lissan
that day, this simply meant death came quicker.</p>
<p>By his account, Lawrence missed much of it. Due both to Naama’s speed
and to his position at the fore of the camel charge, he had found
himself well out in front of his attacking comrades; Lawrence had
managed to get off just a few rounds with his pistol before Naama was
shot dead beneath him, sending him plummeting to a rough landing among
the rocks. When finally he gathered his wits about him, the battle was
already winding down. To his chagrin, he also discovered that Naama
hadn’t actually been killed by the Turks; judging by her fatal wound, a
point-blank shot to the back of the head, Lawrence had accidentally shot
her himself.</p>
<p>The carnage in Aba el Lissan was as vicious as it was one-sided. Just
two Arab fighters were killed in the attack, and a handful wounded. By
contrast, of the 550 Turkish soldiers trapped in the valley, perhaps 100
managed to make their escape in the direction of Maan, leaving some 160
captive and another 300 dead or dying. As Lawrence would allude in Seven
Pillars, some of these deaths were not the result of battle, but of the
Arabs’ thirst for vengeance for the killing of the Howeitat civilians
several days before.</p>
<p>There now came another test of Lawrence’s leadership. From his
interrogation of one of the prisoners, he learned that Maan itself was
very lightly garrisoned—and considerably more so now given the fate of
the Aba el Lissan relief column. As word of this spread among the Arab
fighters, a clamor went up for the force to double back and fall upon
the railhead town; Maan offered up a golden opportunity for plunder,
while the sad little port town of Aqaba offered nothing.</p>
<p>It was an absolutely pivotal moment, and Lawrence could feel the
objective that had borne him these past two months slipping away. Even
if the Arab fighters managed to take Maan, it would be a purely
temporary victory; the Turks would counterattack in force, and that
would see the path to Aqaba, now virtually clear, shut down forever.
What’s more, it would effectively mean the end of the fighting force he
and Auda and the other tribal chieftains had so patiently cobbled
together. By July 2, they had “no guns, no base nearer than Wejh, no
communications, no money even, for our gold was exhausted, and we were
issuing our own notes, promises to pay ‘when Aqaba is taken’ for daily
expenses.” Aqaba now had to be taken as a matter of survival.</p>
<p>With Auda’s help, Lawrence at last managed to turn the warriors away
from the easy promise of Maan. Both to put more distance between their
men and that temptation and out of fear of attack by Turks or marauding
rival tribes, they resolved to set out for Aqaba that same night. But
this decision raised another, troubling issue: what to do with the enemy
wounded? It was agreed that those able to walk would join their fellow
prisoners and, watched over by a rearguard detail, be herded along in
the direction of Aqaba. As for the twenty or so Turks too badly wounded
to travel, they were to be left behind, placed beside the stream so that
at least their imminent deaths might not come from thirst.</p>
<p>While the Arab warriors began breaking camp for the onward night
march, Lawrence set off alone down the valley to where the day’s
slaughter had taken place. He hoped to gather enough coats or blankets
off the Turkish corpses to make those being left by the streambank a bit
more comfortable in their last hours, but he found that scavenging
parties had already discovered the dead and stripped them naked. The
scene, and Lawrence’s reaction to it, was to lead to one of the eeriest
passages in his autobiography:</p>
<p>The dead men looked wonderfully beautiful. The night was shining
gently down, softening them into new ivory. Turks were white-skinned on
their clothed parts, much whiter than the Arabs, and these soldiers had
been very young. Close round them lapped the dark wormwood, now heavy
with dew, in which the ends of the moonbeams sparkled like sea-spray.
The corpses seemed flung so pitifully on the ground, huddled anyhow in
low heaps. Surely if straightened they would be comfortable at last. So
I put them all in order, one by one, very wearied myself, and longing to
be of these quiet ones, not of the restless, noisy, aching mob up the
valley, quarrelling over their plunder, boasting of their speed and
strength to endure God knew how many toils and pains of this sort.</p>
<p>At last turning away from the dead, Lawrence rejoined the warriors
for the march on to Aqaba, now just forty miles away over the
mountains.</p>
<p>IN LAWRENCE’S TWO-MONTH absence, the Anglo-Arab military campaign in
the Hejaz continued in its usual fitful rhythm. Through May and June,
British demolition parties, usually accompanied by bands of Arab
warriors, made their periodic forays inland to do damage to the Hejaz
Railway. Their reports noted the occasional success—a blown bridge here,
a wrecked train there—but even more frequently complained of the
unreliability and lack of discipline among their Arab confederates.
Higher up the chain of command, British commanders remained exercised
about galvanizing the rebels to finally carry out their blocking
operation in the El Ula region northwest of Medina, but the sense of
imperative for the scheme was gradually withering under the evidence
that the Turks had no intention of leaving Medina. Faisal, now enjoying
the title of Commander of Arab Forces, had instead set his sights on his
march into Syria. Among those British officers privy to Faisal’s
fantastically ambitious blueprint for that advance—this from a man who
had barely budged from Wejh in four months—enthusiasm tended to be
restrained. “It is somewhat difficult to examine in any detail Sherif
Faisal’s plan,” one such officer reported at the end of May, “which is
characterized throughout by a remarkable freedom from conventional
restrictions in regard to time, space, arrangements for supply, or the
disposition and possible action of the enemy.”</p>
<p>Looking over the reports from the field, Gilbert Clayton in Cairo
filed a weekly status report on the Hejaz situation to the director of
military intelligence in London. Throughout May and June, these
memoranda were usually prefaced by the comment that very little had
changed since the previous one. But if all remained static in the
Hejaz—“satisfactory” was the word Clayton preferred—by late June, his
spies inside Syria were reporting a rather dramatic uptick in rebel
activity. By the time Clayton penned his report of July 5, these reports
were coming in from all across southern Syria: “active hostility” by the
Howeitat tribe near Maan; an attack on the Turkish garrison at Fuweila;
a raid on a Turkish camel-grazing party near Shobek; a sabotage
operation on the rail line outside Bir el Shedia.</p>
<p>“It is not known what are the present whereabouts of Captain
Lawrence, who left for the Maan area or Jebel Druze area some time ago,”
Clayton noted in that same report, “but lately an Arab rumor came into
Wejh to the effect that he and the small party with him had blown up a
large iron bridge south of Maan. These activities in the Maan area are
probably the outcome of Captain Lawrence’s arrival in that
neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Gilbert Clayton had it only partly right. What he couldn’t have known
was that Lawrence and his Arab confederates were actually responsible
for nearly all the actions in southern Syria he reported on that day,
just as they had been for most of the other attacks across the breadth
of Syria, some of them over three hundred miles behind enemy lines, that
had taken place over the previous month. He also couldn’t have known
that on July 5, Lawrence was not in the neighborhood of Maan, but rather
sixty miles to the southwest, negotiating the surrender of the Turkish
garrison in Aqaba.</p>
<p>After the massacre at Aba el Lissan, Lawrence and the Arab warriors
had raced toward the sea. As they crested the mountains and descended
the Wadi Itm toward Aqaba, the fighters passed one empty Turkish
blockhouse and trenchline after another, final proof of the brilliance
of Lawrence’s contrarian scheme. “The enemy had never imagined attack
from the interior,” he noted, “and of all their great works, not one
trench or post faced inland.”</p>
<p>In contrast to its dramatic rendering in David Lean’s movie, the fall
of Aqaba was somewhat anticlimactic. After a tense two-day standoff,
with both sides running desperately short of food, the Turkish commander
finally accepted that his situation was hopeless and surrendered the
port on July 6 with barely a shot fired. With the white flag raised, the
rebels raced into Aqaba on their camels and splashed into the sea in
celebration of their audacious victory.</p>
<p>But for Lawrence, the long ordeal was not quite over or the triumph
secure. There were now nearly twelve hundred men crowded into Aqaba,
some six hundred Arab fighters and an equal number of Turkish prisoners,
but desperately little food. He also knew that it would only be a matter
of time—and likely a short time—before the Turks in the Syrian interior
mustered a sufficient force to march over the mountains to retake Aqaba.
Such an advance might be slowed by manning the mountain guardhouses with
rebel units, but as Lawrence knew from past bad experience, relying on
Arab tribesmen to hold defensive positions, even formidable ones, was
never a safe bet. Just as vital as Aqaba’s fall, then, was to now get
word of it to the British so that supplies and reinforcements could be
rushed in.</p>
<p>The next day, and accompanied by just eight warriors, Lawrence set
out in the direction of Egypt, hoping to cross the 150 miles of desert
that lay between Aqaba and the British lines at the Suez before it was
too late.</p>
