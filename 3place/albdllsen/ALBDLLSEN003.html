<h4 id="chapter-1-playboys-in-the-holy-land">Chapter 1 Playboys in the
Holy Land</h4>
<p>I consider this new crisis that has emerged to be a blessing. I
believe that it is the Turks’ ultimate duty either to live like an
honorable nation or to exit the stage of history gloriously.</p>
<p>DJEMAL PASHA, GOVERNOR OF SYRIA, ON TURKEY’S ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I,
NOVEMBER 2, 1914</p>
<p>The storm began as a mild weather disturbance, one fairly common for
that time of year. For several days in early January 1914, a hot dry
breeze had come off the Sahara Desert to pass over the winter-cooled
waters of the eastern Mediterranean. By the morning of the ninth, this
convergence had spawned a strong southwesterly wind, one that grew in
intensity as it made landfall over southern Palestine. By the time it
approached Beersheva, a small village on the edge of the Zin Desert some
twenty-five miles inland, this wind threatened to trigger a khamsin, or
sandstorm.</p>
<p>For the inexperienced, being caught out in the desert during a
khamsin can be unsettling. While it shares some of the properties of a
severe thunderstorm—the same drop in barometric pressure beforehand, the
same prelude of buffeting wind—the fact that sand is falling rather than
water means visibility can rapidly drop to just a few feet, and the
constant raking of sand against the body, coating the nose and mouth and
collecting in every crevice of clothing, can induce a feeling of
suffocation. In the grip of this sensation, the mind can easily seize
upon the worst idea—to journey on, to attempt to fight one’s way out of
the storm. Men routinely become lost and die acting on this impulse.</p>
<p>But the three young British men waiting in Beersheva that afternoon
were not inexperienced. They had lingered an extra day in the village— a
lonely outpost of perhaps eight hundred inhabitants best known as a
watering hole for passing camel caravans—in expectation of the arrival
of an expedition party led by two Americans. By dusk, however, there was
still no sign of the Americans, and what had earlier appeared no more
threatening than a dull brown haze in the west had now formed up into a
mile-high wall of approaching sand. Shortly after dark, the khamsin
rolled in.</p>
<p>Throughout that night, the storm raged. In the small house the
British men shared, sand spattered against the shuttered windows like
driven rain, and all their efforts to seal the place couldn’t prevent
them and everything else inside from becoming coated in a fine layer of
desert dust. By dawn, the winds had abated somewhat, enough that the
risen sun appeared as a pale silvery orb in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>The khamsin finally died off in early afternoon, allowing the
residents of Beersheva to emerge from their homes and tents and move
about. It was then that the Britons received some news of the Americans.
Apparently caught out by the impending storm, they had drawn camp the
previous evening in the desert just a few miles east of town. The three
men saddled their camels and made for the American camp.</p>
<p>Considering the surrounding desolation, the opulence they found there
made for a rather bizarre spectacle. Along with a couple of horse-drawn
carts hauling silage for the party’s herd of pack animals were several
more to carry its larger “field furniture.” Now that the khamsin had
passed, the native orderlies were busily breaking camp, including
dismantling the two very fine and spacious Bell tents—undoubtedly
purchased from one of the better expedition outfitters in London or New
York—that were the habitations of the two young Americans leading the
expedition. These men, both in their midtwenties and clad in Western
field suits and bowler hats, were named William Yale and Rudolf
McGovern. As they explained to their British visitors, they were in
southern Palestine as part of a Grand Tour of the Holy Land, an
adventure that when the sandstorm hit had become a bit more than they
bargained for.</p>
<p>But there was something about the Americans that didn’t quite add up.
Although they were well dressed and obviously traveling in high style,
there was little about the men—McGovern small and reserved, Yale
barrel-chested with a boxer’s rough-hewn face—that suggested them as
either natural traveling companions or likely candidates for a
pilgrimage tour of biblical sites. Then there was their demeanor.
Encountering other foreigners in this lonely corner of Syria was such a
novelty that it tended to induce a kind of instant camaraderie, but
there was none of this with Yale and McGovern. To the contrary, the
Americans appeared flustered, even perturbed, by the arrival of the
Britons, and it seemed that only the dictates of desert hospitality
compelled Yale—clearly the dominant personality of the two—to invite
their guests into the main dining tent and to dispatch one of their camp
followers to prepare tea.</p>
<p>But if the Americans seemed peculiar, William Yale had precisely the
same reaction to his British visitors. The oldest—and the leader of the
group, in Yale’s estimation—was a dark-haired, hawk-faced man in his
midthirties clad in a well-worn British army uniform. His companions
were in civilian dress and quite a bit younger, one in his midtwenties
perhaps, while the third appeared to be a mere teenager. Most puzzling
to Yale, the two older men barely spoke. Instead, it was the “teenager”
who commandeered the conversation in the tent and chattered like a
magpie. He was very slight and slender, with a heavy-featured face that
Yale found almost repellent, but his most arresting feature was his
eyes; they were light blue and piercingly intense.</p>
<p>The young visitor explained that he and his companions were in the
region to conduct an archaeological survey of biblical-era ruins for a
British organization called the Palestine Exploration Fund. He then
proceeded to regale his American hosts with stories of his own
adventures in the Near East, stories so voluble and engaging that it
took Yale quite some time to realize they masked a kind of
interrogation.</p>
<p>“His chatter was sprinkled with a stream of questions—seemingly quite
innocent questions—about us and our plans. He assumed that we were
tourists traveling in grand style to see the famous ruins of the Sinai
and Palestine. It was not until after our visitors had left that we
realized that this seemingly inexperienced, youthful enthusiast had most
successfully pumped us dry.”</p>
<p>It would be some time before he knew it, but William Yale had just
had his first encounter with Thomas Edward Lawrence, soon to become
better known as Lawrence of Arabia. It would also be some time before he
learned that Lawrence had only feigned interest in the Americans’ Holy
Land tour in order to toy with them, that he had known all along their
story was false.</p>
<p>In reality, William Yale and Rudolf McGovern were agents of the
Standard Oil Company of New York, and they were in Palestine on a secret
mission in search of oil. Under orders from Standard headquarters, they
had spent the previous three months posing as wealthy young men of
leisure—“playboys,” in the parlance of the day—on the Holy Land tourist
circuit. While upholding that cover story, they had quietly slipped off
to excavate along the Dead Sea and to take geological soundings in the
Judean foothills.</p>
<p>But if the playboy tale had held the ring of plausibility during
their earlier wanderings—at least Judea had ruins and the Dead Sea
figured prominently in the Bible—it became rather suspect once they
veered off for the forlorn outpost of Beersheva. It was downright
laughable when considering Yale and McGovern’s ultimate destination: a
desolate massif of stone rising up out of the desert some twenty miles
southeast of Beersheva known as Kornub.</p>
<p>In fact, it was not the khamsin but the growing improbability of
their cover story that had kept the Americans out of Beersheva the night
before. As they had approached the village, the oilmen had been alerted
to the presence of the three Britons. Anxious to avoid a meeting and the
awkward questions likely to arise, they had chosen to pitch camp in the
desert instead, with the intention of slipping into Beersheva at first
light, quickly gathering up supplies for their onward journey, and
stealing away before being detected. The slow-moving khamsin had
obviously put an end to that plan, and as he’d waited out the storm that
morning, Yale had feared it was only a matter of time before the
foreigners in Beersheva learned of their desert campsite and put in an
appearance—an apprehension confirmed when the three men rode up.</p>
<p>But what Yale also couldn’t have known was that his efforts at
concealment were quite pointless, that this seemingly impromptu meeting
in the desert was anything but. The previous day, Lawrence and his
colleagues on the archaeological expedition had received a cable from
the British consulate in Jerusalem alerting them to the presence of the
American oilmen in the area, and they had lingered in Beersheva for the
express purpose of intercepting Yale and McGovern and learning what they
were up to.</p>
<p>If this seemed an odd mission for an archaeological survey team to
undertake, there was rather more to that story, too. Although it was
technically true that Lawrence and Leonard Woolley—the other civilian in
the tent, and a respected archaeologist—were in southern Palestine in
search of biblical ruins, that project was merely a fig leaf for a far
more sensitive one, an elaborate covert operation being run by the
British military. Ottoman government officials certainly knew of the
Palestine Exploration Fund survey in the Zin Desert—they had approved
it, after all—but they knew nothing of the five British military survey
teams operating under the PEF banner who at that very moment were
scattered across the desert quietly mapping the Ottoman Empire’s
southwestern frontier. Overseeing that covert operation was the
uniformed third visitor to the American camp, Captain Stewart Francis
Newcombe of the Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>What had taken place outside Beersheva, then, was a rather complex
game of bluff, one in which one side had rummaged about for the truth
behind the other’s fiction, even as it sought to uphold its own
framework of fiction.</p>
<p>LAWRENCE AND YALE weren’t the only young foreigners with suspect
agendas wandering about the Holy Land that mid-January. Just fifty miles
to the north of Beersheva, in the city of Jerusalem, a
thirty-three-year-old German scholar named Curt Prüfer was also plotting
his future.</p>
<p>In Prüfer’s physical appearance were few clues to suggest him as an
intriguing figure. Quite to the contrary. The German stood just five
foot eight, with narrow, sloping shoulders, and his thin thatch of
brownish blond hair framed a bland, thin face most noteworthy for its
lack of distinguishing characteristics, the sort of face that naturally
blends into a crowd. Adding to this air of innocuousness was Prüfer’s
voice. He spoke in a permanent soft, feathery whisper, as if he’d spent
his entire life in a library, although this condition was actually the
result of a botched throat operation in childhood that had scarred his
vocal cords. To many who met the young German scholar, his modest frame
together with that voice conveyed an aura of effeminacy, an estimation
likely to be fortified should they happen to learn the subject of the
dissertation that had earned him his doctorate: a learned study on the
Egyptian dramatic form known as shadow plays. In mid-January 1914,
Prüfer was waiting in Jerusalem for the arrival of a friend, a Bavarian
landscape painter of middling repute, with whom he’d made plans to
conduct an extended tour of the Upper Nile aboard a luxury dhow.</p>
<p>But just as with the men gathered in the tent outside Beersheva,
there was an altogether different side to Dr. Curt Prüfer. For the
previous several years, he had served as the Oriental secretary to the
German embassy in Cairo, a position ideally suited to both his
appearance and demeanor. Removed from the policymaking deliberations of
the senior diplomatic staff, the Oriental secretary was tasked to
quietly keep tabs on the social and political undercurrents of the
country, to maintain a low profile and report back. In that capacity,
Prüfer’s life in Cairo had been a never-ending social whirl, a perpetual
roster of meetings and teas and dinners with Egypt’s most prominent
journalists, businessmen, and politicians.</p>
<p>His social circle had included more controversial figures, too. With
Germany vying with its rival, Great Britain, for influence in the
region, Prüfer had surreptitiously cultivated alliances with a wide
array of Egyptian dissidents seeking to end British control of their
homeland: nationalists, royalists, religious zealots. Fluent in Arabic
as well as a half dozen other languages, in 1911 the German Oriental
secretary had traveled across Egypt and Syria disguised as a Bedouin to
foment anti-British sentiment among the tribes. The following year, he
had attempted to recruit Egyptian mujahideen to join their Arab brethren
in Libya against an invading Italian army.</p>
<p>In these varied efforts, Curt Prüfer had eventually fallen foul of
the first rule of his position: to stay in the background. Alerted to
his agent provocateur activities, the British secret police in Egypt had
quietly compiled a lengthy dossier on the Oriental secretary, and bided
their time on when to use it. When finally they did, Prüfer was
effectively persona non grata. After enduring the ignominy for as long
as he could, he had tendered his resignation from the German diplomatic
service in late 1913. It was this that had brought him to Jerusalem that
January. Once his friend, the artist Richard von Below, arrived from
Germany, the two would depart for Egypt and their luxury cruise up the
Nile. That journey was scheduled to last some five months, and while von
Below painted, Prüfer intended to busy himself composing travelogue
articles for magazines back in Germany, along with updating entries for
the famous German travel guide, Baedeker’s. It was to mark something of
a return to Prüfer’s academic roots, his extended foray into the messy
arena of international politics consigned to the past.</p>
<p>Or maybe not. Maybe his spying activities were just put on hiatus,
for on his upcoming cruise, Curt Prüfer would be traveling along the
very lifeline of British-ruled Egypt, would be given the opportunity to
glimpse firsthand its defensive fortifications and port facilities, to
quietly take the pulse of Egyptian public opinion. And while it might
appear that the exposed and disgraced former Oriental secretary was
sailing into an unsettled future that January of 1914, he now held at
least one conviction that gave his life a strong sense of direction: it
was the British who had destroyed his diplomatic career; it was the
British upon whom he would take his revenge.</p>
<p>Toward achieving this, he could draw on another rather surprising
aspect of his personality. His aura of innocuousness notwithstanding,
Curt Prüfer was a consummate charmer, and had a reputation as a
notorious seducer of women. In Cairo, whatever affections he felt for
his wife, a doughty American woman thirteen years his senior, had been
shared between a string of mistresses. Since arriving in Jerusalem, he
had taken up with a young and beautiful Russian Jewish émigré doctor
named Minna Weizmann, better known to her friends and family as Fanny.
In just a little over a year’s time, as Germany’s counterintelligence
chief in wartime Syria, Prüfer would come up with the idea of recruiting
Jewish émigrés to infiltrate British-held Egypt and spy for the
Fatherland. Among the first spies Prüfer would send into enemy territory
would be his lover, Fanny Weizmann.</p>
<p>· · ·</p>
<p>JUST SEVENTY MILES to the north of Jerusalem that January, there was
another man about to embark on a double life. His name was Aaron
Aaronsohn. A thirty-eight-year-old Jewish émigré from Romania, Aaronsohn
was already recognized as one of the preeminent agricultural scientists,
or agronomists, in the Middle East, a reputation cemented by his 1906
discovery of the genetic forebear to wheat. With funding from American
Jewish philanthropists, in 1909 he had established the Jewish
Agricultural Experiment Station outside the village of Athlit, and for
the past five years had tirelessly experimented with all manner of
plants and trees in hopes of returning the arid Palestinian region of
Syria to the verdant garden it had once been.</p>
<p>This ambition had a political component. A committed Zionist, as
early as 1911 Aaronsohn had begun to articulate a scheme whereby a vast
swath of Palestine might be wrested away from the Ottoman Empire and
reconstituted as a Jewish homeland. Other Zionists had expressed this
vision before, of course, but it was Aaronsohn, with his encyclopedic
knowledge of the region’s flora and soil conditions and aquifers, who
first appreciated how it might practically be accomplished, how the
Jewish diaspora might return to its ancestral homeland and prosper by
making the desert bloom.</p>
<p>In the near future, Aaronsohn would perceive the chance to bring this
dream closer to fruition, and he would seize it. Under the cover of
advising the local government on agricultural matters, he would
establish an extensive spy ring across the breadth of Palestine, and
provide the Ottomans’ British enemies with some of their most invaluable
battlefield intelligence. The agronomist would then go on to play a
signal role in promoting the cause of a Jewish homeland in the capitals
of Europe. Somewhat ironically, his chief confederate in that endeavor
would be the older brother of Curt Prüfer’s lover-spy, Fanny Weizmann,
and the future first president of Israel: Chaim Weizmann.</p>
<p>THE LURE OF the East: whether to conquer or explore or exploit, it
has exerted its pull on the West for a thousand years. That lure brought
wave after wave of Christian Crusaders to the Near East over a
three-hundred-year span in the Middle Ages. More recently, it brought a
conquering French general with pharaonic fantasies named Napoleon
Bonaparte to Egypt in the 1790s, Europe’s greatest archaeologists in the
1830s, and hordes of Western oil barons, wildcatters, and con men to the
shores of the Caspian Sea in the 1870s. For a similar variety of
reasons, in the early years of the twentieth century it brought together
four young men of adventure: Thomas Edward Lawrence, William Yale, Curt
Prüfer, and Aaron Aaronsohn.</p>
<p>At the time, the regions these men traveled were still a part of the
Ottoman Empire, one of the greatest imperial powers the world had ever
known. From its birthplace in a tiny corner of the mountainous region of
Anatolia in modern-day Turkey, that empire had steadily expanded until
by the early 1600s it encompassed an area rivaling that of the Roman
imperium at its height: from the gates of Vienna in the north to the
southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula, from the shores of the western
Mediterranean clear across to the port of Basra in modern-day Iraq.</p>
<p>But that had been then. By the second decade of the twentieth
century, the Ottoman Empire had long been in a state of seemingly
terminal decline. The proverbial “sick man of Europe,” its epitaph had
begun to be written as far back as the 1850s, and in the intervening
years no fewer than five of the imperial powers of Europe had taken
turns snatching away great swaths of its territory. That the Ottomans
had managed to avoid complete destruction thus far was due both to their
skill at playing off those competing European powers and to no small
measure of improbable good luck. In 1914, however, all that was about to
change. By guessing wrong—very wrong—in the calamitous war just then
descending, the Ottomans would not only bring on their own doom but
unleash forces of such massive disintegration that the world is still
dealing with the repercussions a century later.</p>
