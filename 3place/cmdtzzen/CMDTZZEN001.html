<p>The text reproduced here is the Fourth Revised Edition, updated by
Graham in 1971-1972 and initially published in 1973. The numbered
chapter notes are original to Graham—bolded text in these notes is by
Jason Zweig.</p>
<p>Jason Zweig’s new notes within Graham’s chapters are designated by an
asterisk or a cross.</p>
<p>Preface to the Fourth Edition,</p>
<p>by Warren E. Buffett</p>
<p>I read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was
nineteen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about
investing ever written. I still think it is.</p>
<p>To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a
stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.
What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and
the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework. This book
precisely and clearly prescribes the proper framework. You must supply
the emotional discipline.</p>
<p>If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Graham
advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable advice in
Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from your investments.
(That represents more of an accomplishment than you might think.)
Whether you achieve outstanding results will depend on the effort and
intellect you apply to your investments, as well as on the amplitudes of
stock-market folly that prevail during your investing career. The
sillier the market’s behavior, the greater the opportunity for the
business-like investor. Follow Graham and you will profit from folly
rather than participate in it.</p>
<p>To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher. More than
any other man except my father, he influenced my life. Shortly after
Ben’s death in 1976, I wrote the following short remembrance about him
in the Financial Analysts Journal. As you read the book, I believe
you’ll perceive some of the qualities I mentioned in this tribute.</p>
<p>Benjamin Graham</p>
<p>1894–1976</p>
<p>Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a
friend the thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish,
something creative and something generous.”</p>
<p>The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for
packaging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or
self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was
unfailingly gentle.</p>
<p>Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as
measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a
discipline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by
successors. But over forty years after publication of the book that
brought structure and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is
difficult to think of possible candidates for even the runner-up
position in the field of security analysis. In an area where much looks
foolish within weeks or months after publication, Ben’s principles have
remained sound—their value often enhanced and better understood in the
wake of financial storms that demolished flimsier intellectual
structures. His counsel of soundness brought unfailing rewards to his
followers—even to those with natural abilities inferior to more gifted
practitioners who stumbled while following counsels of brilliance or
fashion.</p>
<p>A remarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was
that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that
concentrates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental
by-product of an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition.
Certainly I have never met anyone with a mind of similar scope.
Virtually total recall, unending fascination with new knowledge, and an
ability to recast it in a form applicable to seemingly unrelated
problems made exposure to his thinking in any field a delight.</p>
<p>But his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond all
others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each
relationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there
was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,
and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better
place to go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was
there.</p>
<p>Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit
under. Ben Graham was such a man.</p>
<p>Reprinted from the Financial Analysts Journal, November/December
1976.</p>
<p>A Note About Benjamin Graham by Jason Zweig</p>
<p>Who was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?</p>
<p>Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was
also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before
Graham, money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided
largely by superstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s
Security Analysis was the textbook that transformed this musty circle
into a modern profession. 1</p>
<p>And The Intelligent Investor is the first book ever to describe, for
individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that
are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on
investing ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor
was the first book I read when I joined Forbes Magazine as a cub
reporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner or
later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks
suffered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,
after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market
that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investor reads more
prophetically than ever.)</p>
<p>Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the
anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and
psychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on May 9,
1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and figurines.2
The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At first they
lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French governess—on upper
Fifth Avenue. But Ben’s father died in 1903, the porcelain business
faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty. Ben’s mother
turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrowing money to trade
stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash of 1907. For the rest
of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of cashing a check for his
mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is Dorothy Grossbaum good for
five dollars?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his
brilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his
class. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three
departments—English, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the
faculty. He was all of 20 years old.</p>
<p>Instead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot. He
started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst, then
a partner, and before long was running his own investment
partnership.</p>
<p>The Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In April
1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for Savold
Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by October, the
company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock was worthless.</p>
<p>Graham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic, almost
molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure reports filed by
oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission, he learned
that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at 5 per share—held at least 0
per share in high-quality bonds. (He bought the stock, pestered its
managers into raising the dividend, and came away with 10 per share
three years later.)</p>
<p>Despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of
1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting
bargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact record
of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in 1956,
his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually, versus 12.2% for
the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-term track records on
Wall Street history.3</p>
<p>How did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual powers
with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham developed his
core principles, which are at least as valid today as they were during
his lifetime:</p>
<p>A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an
ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value that
does not depend on its share price.</p>
<p>The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustainable
optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified pessimism
(which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor is a realist who
sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.</p>
<p>The future value of every investment is a function of its present
price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.</p>
<p>No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever
eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what Graham
called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no matter how exciting
an investment seems to be—can you minimize your odds of error.</p>
<p>The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you
become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith, and
you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady advantage of
even the worst bear markets. By developing your discipline and courage,
you can refuse to let other people’s mood swings govern your financial
destiny. In the end, how your investments behave is much less important
than how you behave.</p>
<p>The goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investor is to
apply Graham’s ideas to today’s financial markets while leaving his text
entirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).4
After each of Graham’s chapters you’ll find a new commentary. In these
reader’s guides, I’ve added recent examples that should show you just
how relevant—and how liberating—Graham’s principles remain today.</p>
<p>I envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading Graham’s
masterpiece for the first time—or even the third or fourth time. Like
all classics, it alters how we view the world and renews itself by
educating us. And the more you read it, the better it gets. With Graham
as your guide, you are guaranteed to become a vastly more intelligent
investor.</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>What This Book Expects to Accomplish</p>
<p>The purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for laymen,
guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment policy.
Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of analyzing
securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and
investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a number of condensed
comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in pairs appearing side by
side in the New York Stock Exchange list—in order to bring home in
concrete fashion the important elements involved in specific choices of
common stocks.</p>
<p>But much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns of
financial markets, in some cases running back over many decades. To
invest intelligently in securities one should be forearmed with an
adequate knowledge of how the various types of bonds and stocks have
actually behaved under varying conditions—some of which, at least, one
is likely to meet again in one’s own experience. No statement is more
true and better applicable to Wall Street than the famous warning of
Santayana: “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat
it.”</p>
<p>Our text is directed to investors as distinguished from speculators,
and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all but
forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a “how
to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to riches on
Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up what we have
just said by a bit of financial history—especially since there is more
than one moral to be drawn from it. In the climactic year 1929 John J.
Raskob, a most important figure nationally as well as on Wall Street,
extolled the blessings of capitalism in an article in the Ladies’ Home
Journal, entitled “Everybody Ought to Be Rich.”* His thesis was that
savings of only 5 per month invested in good common stocks—with
dividends reinvested—would produce an estate of 0,000 in twenty years
against total contributions of only ,600. If the General Motors tycoon
was right, this was indeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was
he? Our rough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks
making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates that if
Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948, the investor’s
holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been worth about ,500. This
is a far cry from the great man’s promise of 0,000, and it shows how
little reliance can be placed on such optimistic forecasts and
assurances. But, as an aside, we should remark that the return actually
realized by the 20-year operation would have been better than 8%
compounded annually—and this despite the fact that the investor would
have begun his purchases with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation
based on the 1948 closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a
persuasive argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of
strong common stocks through thick and thin—a program known as
“dollar-cost averaging.”</p>
<p>Since our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant for
those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided by charts
or other largely mechanical means of determining the right moments to
buy and sell. The one principle that applies to nearly all these
so-called “technical approaches” is that one should buy because a stock
or the market has gone up and one should sell because it has declined.
This is the exact opposite of sound business sense everywhere else, and
it is most unlikely that it can lead to lasting success on Wall Street.
In our own stock-market experience and observation, extending over 50
years, we have not known a single person who has consistently or
lastingly made money by thus “following the market.” We do not hesitate
to declare that this approach is as fallacious as it is popular. We
shall illustrate what we have just said—though, of course this should
not be taken as proof—by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow
theory for trading in the stock market.*</p>
<p>Since its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent
Investor have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In
updating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a number
of new developments since the 1965 edition was written. These
include:</p>
<p>An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade
bonds.</p>
<p>A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common stocks,
ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage decline in some 30
years. (Countless issues of lower quality had a much larger
shrinkage.)</p>
<p>A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices, which
gained momentum even in the face of a decline of general business in
1970.</p>
<p>The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, franchise
operations, and other relative novelties in business and finance. (These
include a number of tricky devices such as “letter stock,”1
proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading names, use of foreign
banks, and others.)†</p>
<p>Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-term
debt of many formerly strongly entrenched companies, and even a
disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street houses.*</p>
<p>The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of investment
funds, including some bank-operated trust funds, with disquieting
results.</p>
<p>These phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some will
require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previous edition.
The underlying principles of sound investment should not alter from
decade to decade, but the application of these principles must be
adapted to significant changes in the financial mechanisms and
climate.</p>
<p>The last statement was put to the test during the writing of the
present edition, the first draft of which was finished in January 1971.
At that time the DJIA was in a strong recovery from its 1970 low of 632
and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with attendant general
optimism. As the last draft was finished, in November 1971, the market
was in the throes of a new decline, carrying it down to 797 with a
renewed general uneasiness about its future. We have not allowed these
fluctuations to affect our general attitude toward sound investment
policy, which remains substantially unchanged since the first edition of
this book in 1949.</p>
<p>The extent of the market’s shrinkage in 1969–70 should have served to
dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground during the past two
decades. This was that leading common stocks could be bought at any time
and at any price, with the assurance not only of ultimate profit but
also that any intervening loss would soon be recouped by a renewed
advance of the market to new high levels. That was too good to be true.
At long last the stock market has “returned to normal,” in the sense
that both speculators and stock investors must again be prepared to
experience significant and perhaps protracted falls as well as rises in
the value of their holdings.</p>
<p>In the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,
especially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the last
market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in itself—it had
happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there was now a novel
element in the fact that some of the investment funds had large
commitments in highly speculative and obviously overvalued issues of
this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who needs to be warned that
while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere,
on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.</p>
<p>The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the huge
rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967 the
investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much income from
such bonds as he could from dividends on representative common stocks.
At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19% on highest-grade bonds
versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks. (This compares with 4.40% and
2.92% respectively at the end of 1964.) It is hard to realize that when
we first wrote this book in 1949 the figures were almost the exact
opposite: the bonds returned only 2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.2
In previous editions we have consistently urged that at least 25% of the
conservative investor’s portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have
favored in general a 50–50 division between the two media. We must now
consider whether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock
yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible
relationship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of
continued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision
here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*</p>
<p>In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds of
investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive” and the
“enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will place his chief
emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or losses. His second aim
will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and the need for making frequent
decisions. The determining trait of the enterprising (or active, or
aggressive) investor is his willingness to devote time and care to the
selection of securities that are both sound and more attractive than the
average. Over many decades an enterprising investor of this sort could
expect a worthwhile reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form
of a better average return than that realized by the passive investor.
We have some doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is
promised to the active investor under today’s conditions. But next year
or the years after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue
to devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as
they existed in former periods and may return.</p>
<p>It has long been the prevalent view that the art of successful
investment lies first in the choice of those industries that are most
likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the most promising
companies in these industries. For example, smart investors—or their
smart advisers—would long ago have recognized the great growth
possibilities of the computer industry as a whole and of International
Business Machines in particular. And similarly for a number of other
growth industries and growth companies. But this is not as easy as it
always looks in retrospect. To bring this point home at the outset let
us add here a paragraph that we included first in the 1949 edition of
this book.</p>
<p>Such an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport stocks
because he believes their future is even more brilliant than the trend
the market already reflects. For this class of investor the value of our
book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls lurking in this
favorite investment approach than in any positive technique that will
help him along his path.*</p>
<p>The pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry we
mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of air
traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this factor
their shares became a favorite choice of the investment funds. But
despite the expansion of revenues—at a pace even greater than in the
computer industry—a combination of technological problems and
overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuating and even disastrous
profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a new high in traffic figures,
the airlines sustained a loss of some 00 million for their shareholders.
(They had shown losses also in 1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these
companies once again showed a greater decline in 1969–70 than did the
general market. The record shows that even the highly paid full-time
experts of the mutual funds were completely wrong about the fairly
short-term future of a major and nonesoteric industry.</p>
<p>On the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial
investments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its
apparently high price and the impossibility of being certain about its
rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3% of their
funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of this excellent
choice on their overall results was by no means decisive. Furthermore,
many—if not most—of their investments in computer-industry companies
other than IBM appear to have been unprofitable. From these two broad
examples we draw two morals for our readers:</p>
<p>Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate
into obvious profits for investors.</p>
<p>The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and
concentrating on the most promising companies in the most promising
industries.</p>
<p>The author did not follow this approach in his financial career as
fund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much
encouragement to those who may wish to try it.</p>
<p>What then will we aim to accomplish in this book? Our main objective
will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible substantial
error and to develop policies with which he will be comfortable. We
shall say quite a bit about the psychology of investors. For indeed, the
investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is likely to be
himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is not in our stars—and not in our
stocks—but in ourselves….”) This has proved the more true over recent
decades as it has become more necessary for conservative investors to
acquire common stocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the
excitement and the temptations of the stock market. By arguments,
examples, and exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the
proper mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.
We have seen much more money made and kept by “ordinary people” who were
temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who
lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of
finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.</p>
<p>Additionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to measure
or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at some price
they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price they would be so
dear that they should be sold. The habit of relating what is paid to
what is being offered is an invaluable trait in investment. In an
article in a women’s magazine many years ago we advised the readers to
buy their stocks as they bought their groceries, not as they bought
their perfume. The really dreadful losses of the past few years (and on
many similar occasions before) were realized in those common-stock
issues where the buyer forgot to ask “How much?”</p>
<p>In June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by the magic
figure 9.40%—the yield obtainable on new offerings of high-grade
public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about 7.3%, but even that
return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other answer?” But there are
other possible answers, and these must be carefully considered. Besides
which, we repeat that both we and our readers must be prepared in
advance for the possibly quite different conditions of, say,
1973–1977.</p>
<p>We shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for
common-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of both
classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enterprising
group. Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our chief
requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues selling
not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for this seemingly
outmoded counsel is both practical and psychological. Experience has
taught us that, while there are many good growth companies worth several
times net assets, the buyer of such shares will be too dependent on the
vagaries and fluctuations of the stock market. By contrast, the investor
in shares, say, of public-utility companies at about their net-asset
value can always consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and
expanding businesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what
the stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such
a conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting
adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated
growth.</p>
<p>The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally
appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved by
the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to improve
this easily attainable standard requires much application and more than
a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring just a little extra
knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment program, instead
of realizing a little better than normal results, you may well find that
you have done worse.</p>
<p>Since anyone—by just buying and holding a representative list—can
equal the performance of the market averages, it would seem a
comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as a matter of
fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail is
surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds, with all
their experienced personnel, have not performed so well over the years
as has the general market. Allied to the foregoing is the record of the
published stock-market predictions of the brokerage houses, for there is
strong evidence that their calculated forecasts have been somewhat less
reliable than the simple tossing of a coin.</p>
<p>In writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of
investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have been
emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of
leading common stocks—which any investor can carry out with a little
expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe and sound territory
has been presented as fraught with challenging difficulties, especially
in the area of temperament. Before attempting such a venture the
investor should feel sure of himself and of his advisers—particularly as
to whether they have a clear concept of the differences between
investment and speculation and between market price and underlying
value.</p>
<p>A strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the
margin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a decision
to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured fruits of
defensive investment should not be made without much
self-examination.</p>
<p>A final retrospective thought. When the young author entered Wall
Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next half-century
had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect that a World War
was to break out in two months, and close down the New York Stock
Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the richest and most powerful
country on earth, but beset by all sorts of major problems and more
apprehensive than confident of the future. Yet if we confine our
attention to American investment experience, there is some comfort to be
gleaned from the last 57 years. Through all their vicissitudes and
casualties, as earth-shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true
that sound investment principles produced generally sound results. We
must act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Note to the Reader: This book does not address itself to the overall
financial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that
portion of their funds which they are prepared to place in marketable
(or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks. Consequently
we do not discuss such important media as savings and time desposits,
savings-and-loan-association accounts, life insurance, annuities, and
real-estate mortgages or equity ownership. The reader should bear in
mind that when he finds the word “now,” or the equivalent, in the text,
it refers to late 1971 or early 1972.</p>
<p>Commentary on the Introduction</p>
<p>If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;
that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.</p>
<p>—Henry David Thoreau, Walden</p>
<p>Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not
tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.</p>
<p>Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:</p>
<p>how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;</p>
<p>how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;</p>
<p>how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most
investors from reaching their full potential.</p>
<p>Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks
seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could lose
almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002, many of
the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value or more. Once
you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900% just to get back to
where you started. 1 Taking a foolish risk can put you so deep in the
hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’s why Graham
constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding losses—not just in
Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warning that he has woven
throughout his entire text.</p>
<p>But no matter how careful you are, the price of your investments will
go down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk, Graham
will show you how to manage it—and how to get your fears under
control.</p>
<p>Are You an Intelligent Investor?</p>
<p>Now let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does
Graham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of
this book, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind
of intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means
being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to
harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,
explains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the
brain.”2</p>
<p>There’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to
make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management
L.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer
scientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than
billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market would
return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming more and
more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money that its collapse
nearly capsized the global financial system. 3</p>
<p>And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in the
South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that the market
was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that he “could
calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the
people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pocketing a 100% profit
totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in the wild enthusiasm
of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much higher price—and lost
£20,000 (or more than million in today’s money). For the rest of his
life, he forbade anyone to speak the words “South Sea” in his presence.
4</p>
<p>Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever
lived, as most of us would define intelligence. But, in Graham’s terms,
Newton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the
crowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted
like a fool.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because
you’re stupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t
developed the emotional discipline that successful investing requires.
In Chapter 8, Graham describes how to enhance your intelligence by
harnessing your emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of
irrationality. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent
investor is more a matter of “character” than “brain.”</p>
<p>A Chronicle of Calamity</p>
<p>Now let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial
developments of the past few years:</p>
<p>The worst market crash since the Great Depression, with U.S. stocks
losing 50.2% of their value—or .4 trillion—between March 2000 and
October 2002.</p>
<p>Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of the
1990s, including AOL, Cisco, JDS Uniphase, Lucent, and Qualcomm—plus the
utter destruction of hundreds of Internet stocks.</p>
<p>Accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest and
most respected corporations in America, including Enron, Tyco, and
Xerox.</p>
<p>The bankruptcies of such once-glistening companies as Conseco, Global
Crossing, and WorldCom.</p>
<p>Allegations that accounting firms cooked the books, and even
destroyed records, to help their clients mislead the investing
public.</p>
<p>Charges that top executives at leading companies siphoned off
hundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain.</p>
<p>Proof that security analysts on Wall Street praised stocks publicly
but admitted privately that they were garbage.</p>
<p>A stock market that, even after its bloodcurdling decline, seems
overvalued by historical measures, suggesting to many experts that
stocks have further yet to fall.</p>
<p>A relentless decline in interest rates that has left investors with
no attractive alternative to stocks.</p>
<p>An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace of
global terrorism and war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Much of this damage could have been (and was!) avoided by investors
who learned and lived by Graham’s principles. As Graham puts it, “while
enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall
Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.” By letting themselves
get carried away—on Internet stocks, on big “growth” stocks, on stocks
as a whole—many people made the same stupid mistakes as Sir Isaac
Newton. They let other investors’ judgments determine their own. They
ignored Graham’s warning that “the really dreadful losses” always occur
after “the buyer forgot to ask ‘How much?’” Most painfully of all, by
losing their self-control just when they needed it the most, these
people proved Graham’s assertion that “the investor’s chief problem—and
even his worst enemy—is likely to be himself.”</p>
<p>The Sure Thing That Wasn’T</p>
<p>Many of those people got especially carried away on technology and
Internet stocks, believing the high-tech hype that this industry would
keep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:</p>
<p>In mid-1999, after earning a 117.3% return in just the first five
months of the year, Monument Internet Fund portfolio manager Alexander
Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year over the next three
to five years and an annual average of 35% “over the next 20
years.”5</p>
<p>After his Amerindo Technology Fund rose an incredible 248.9% in 1999,
portfolio manager Alberto Vilar ridiculed anyone who dared to doubt that
the Internet was a perpetual moneymaking machine: “If you’re out of this
sector, you’re going to underperform. You’re in a horse and buggy, and
I’m in a Porsche. You don’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go
with someone else.”6</p>
<p>In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer proclaimed that
Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth owning right now.”
These “winners of the new world,” as he called them, “are the only ones
that are going higher consistently in good days and bad.” Cramer even
took a potshot at Graham: “You have to throw out all of the matrices and
formulas and texts that existed before the Web…. If we used any of what
Graham and Dodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under
management.”7</p>
<p>All these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warning:
“Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate
into obvious profits for investors.” While it seems easy to foresee
which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real value
if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By the
time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best one
to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that its
future returns have nowhere to go but down.</p>
<p>For now at least, no one has the gall to try claiming that technology
will still be the world’s greatest growth industry. But make sure you
remember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing” will
be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely
to be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to
be.</p>
<p>The Silver Lining</p>
<p>If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve
reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The
pendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational
exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked 7
billion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the
Securities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had
cut back on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to
buy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,
therefore, becoming expensive—sold stocks as they went down in price
and, by definition, became cheaper.</p>
<p>As Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly
backwards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more
risky, not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their
prices fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it
makes stocks more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep
enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a
bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale. 8</p>
<p>So take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news
everyone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now
is a considerably safer—and saner—time to be building wealth. Read on,
and let Graham show you how.</p>
