<h4 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h4>
<p>Investing in Investment Funds</p>
<p>One course open to the defensive investor is to put his money into
investment-company shares. Those that are redeemable on demand by the
holder, at net asset value, are commonly known as “mutual funds” (or
“open-end funds”). Most of these are actively selling additional shares
through a corps of salesmen. Those with nonredeemable shares are called
“closed-end” companies or funds; the number of their shares remains
relatively constant. All of the funds of any importance are registered
with the Securities andandandand Exchange Commission (SEC), and are
subject to its regulations and controls.*</p>
<p>The industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there were 383
funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling 4.6 billions. Of
these 356 companies, with 0.6 billions, were mutual funds, and 27
companies with .0 billions, were closed-end.†</p>
<p>There are different ways of classifying the funds. One is by the
broad division of their portfolio; they are “balanced funds” if they
have a significant (generally about one-third) component of bonds, or
“stock-funds” if their holdings are nearly all common stocks. (There are
some other varieties here, such as “bond funds,” “hedge funds,”
“letter-stock funds,” etc.)* Another is by their objectives, as their
primary aim is for income, price stability, or capital appreciation
(“growth”). Another distinction is by their method of sale. “Load funds”
add a selling charge (generally about 9% of asset value on minimum
purchases) to the value before charge.1 Others, known as “no-load”
funds, make no such charge; the managements are content with the usual
investment-counsel fees for handling the capital. Since they cannot pay
salesmen’s commissions, the size of the no-load funds tends to be on the
low side.† The buying and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not
fixed by the companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does the
ordinary corporate stock.</p>
<p>Most of the companies operate under special provisions of the
income-tax law, designed to relieve the shareholders from double
taxation on their earnings. In effect, the funds must pay out virtually
all their ordinary income—i.e., dividends and interest received, less
expenses. In addition they can pay out their realized long-term profits
on sales of investments—in the form of “capital-gains dividends”—which
are treated by the shareholder as if they were his own security profits.
(There is another option here, which we omit to avoid clutter.)† Nearly
all the funds have but one class of security outstanding. A new wrinkle,
introduced in 1967, divides the capitalization into a preferred issue,
which will receive all the ordinary income, and a capital issue, or
common stock, which will receive all the profits on security sales.
(These are called “dual-purpose funds.”)*</p>
<p>Many of the companies that state their primary aim is for capital
gains concentrate on the purchase of the so-called “growth stocks,” and
they often have the word “growth” in their name. Some specialize in a
designated area such as chemicals, aviation, overseas investments; this
is usually indicated in their titles.</p>
<p>The investor who wants to make an intelligent commitment in fund
shares has thus a large and somewhat bewildering variety of choices
before him—not too different from those offered in direct investment. In
this chapter we shall deal with some major questions, viz:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Is there any way by which the investor can assure himself of
better than average results by choosing the right funds? (Subquestion:
What about the “performance funds”?)†</p></li>
<li><p>If not, how can he avoid choosing funds that will give him worse
than average results?</p></li>
<li><p>Can he make intelligent choices between different types of
funds—e.g., balanced versus all-stock, open-end versus closed-end, load
versus no-load?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Investment-Fund Performance as a Whole</p>
<p>Before trying to answer these questions we should say something about
the performance of the fund industry as a whole. Has it done a good job
for its shareholders? In the most general way, how have fund investors
fared as against those who made their investments directly? We are quite
certain that the funds in the aggregate have served a useful purpose.
They have promoted good habits of savings and investment; they have
protected countless individuals against costly mistakes in the stock
market; they have brought their participants income and profits
commensurate with the overall returns from common stocks. On a
comparative basis we would hazard the guess that the average individual
who put his money exclusively in investment-fund shares in the past ten
years has fared better than the average person who made his common-stock
purchases directly.</p>
<p>The last point is probably true even though the actual performance of
the funds seems to have been no better than that of common stocks as a
whole, and even though the cost of investing in mutual funds may have
been greater than that of direct purchases. The real choice of the
average individual has not been between constructing and acquiring a
well-balanced common-stock portfolio or doing the same thing, a bit more
expensively, by buying into the funds. More likely his choice has been
between succumbing to the wiles of the doorbell-ringing mutual-fund
salesman on the one hand, as against succumbing to the even wilier and
much more dangerous peddlers of second- and third-rate new offerings. We
cannot help thinking, too, that the average individual who opens a
brokerage account with the idea of making conservative common-stock
investments is likely to find himself beset by untoward influences in
the direction of speculation and speculative losses; these temptations
should be much less for the mutual-fund buyer.</p>
<p>But how have the investment funds performed as against the general
market? This is a somewhat controversial subject, but we shall try to
deal with it in simple but adequate fashion. Table 9-1 gives some
calculated results for 1961–1970 of our ten largest stock funds at the
end of 1970, but choosing only the largest one from each management
group. It summarizes the overall return of each of these funds for
1961–1965, 1966–1970, and for the single years 1969 and 1970. We also
give average results based on the sum of one share of each of the ten
funds. These companies had combined assets of over 5 billion at the end
of 1969, or about one-third of all the common-stock funds. Thus they
should be fairly representative of the industry as a whole. (In theory,
there should be a bias in this list on the side of better than industry
performance, since these better companies should have been entitled to
more rapid expansion than the others; but this may not be the case in
practice.)</p>
<p>Some interesting facts can be gathered from this table. First, we
find that the overall results of these ten funds for 1961–1970 were not
appreciably different from those of the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock composite average (or the S andandandand P 425-industrial
stock average). But they were definitely better than those of the DJIA.
(This raises the intriguing question as to why the 30 giants in the DJIA
did worse than the much more numerous and apparently rather
miscellaneous list used by Standard andandandand Poor’s.)* A second
point is that the funds’ aggregate performance as against the S
andandandand P index has improved somewhat in the last five years,
compared with the preceding five. The funds’ gain ran a little lower
than S andandandand P’s in 1961–1965 and a little higher than S
andandandand P’s in 1966–1970. The third point is that a wide difference
exists between the results of the individual funds.</p>
<p>We do not think the mutual-fund industry can be criticized for doing
no better than the market as a whole. Their managers and their
professional competitors administer so large a portion of all marketable
common stocks that what happens to the market as a whole must
necessarily happen (approximately) to the sum of their funds. (Note that
the trust assets of insured commercial banks included 81 billion of
common stocks at the end of 1969; if we add to this the common stocks in
accounts handled by investment advisers, plus the 6 billion of mutual
and similar funds, we must conclude that the combined decisions of these
professionals pretty well determine the movements of the stock averages,
and that the movement of the stock averages pretty well determines the
funds’ aggregate results.)</p>
<p>Are there better than average funds and can the investor select these
so as to obtain superior results for himself? Obviously all investors
could not do this, since in that case we would soon be back where we
started, with no one doing better than anyone else. Let us consider the
question first in a simplified fashion. Why shouldn’t the investor find
out what fund has made the best showing of the lot over a period of
sufficient years in the past, assume from this that its management is
the most capable and will therefore do better than average in the
future, and put his money in that fund? This idea appears the more
practicable because, in the case of the mutual funds, he could obtain
this “most capable management” without paying any special premium for it
as against the other funds. (By contrast, among noninvestment
corporations the best-managed companies sell at correspondingly high
prices in relation to their current earnings and assets.)</p>
<p>The evidence on this point has been conflicting over the years. But
our Table 9-1 covering the ten largest funds indicates that the results
shown by the top five performers of 1961–1965 carried over on the whole
through 1966–1970, even though two of this set did not do as well as two
of the other five. Our studies indicate that the investor in mutual-fund
shares may properly consider comparative performance over a period of
years in the past, say at least five, provided the data do not represent
a large net upward movement of the market as a whole. In the latter case
spectacularly favorable results may be achieved in unorthodox ways—as
will be demonstrated in our following section on “performance” funds.
Such results in themselves may indicate only that the fund managers are
taking undue speculative risks, and getting away with same for the time
being.</p>
<p>“Performance” Funds</p>
<p>One of the new phenomena of recent years was the appearance of the
cult of “performance” in the management of investment funds (and even of
many trust funds). We must start this section with the important
disclaimer that it does not apply to the large majority of
well-established funds, but only to a relatively small section of the
industry which has attracted a disproportionate amount of attention. The
story is simple enough. Some of those in charge set out to get much
better than average (or DJIA) results. They succeeded in doing this for
a while, garnering considerable publicity and additional funds to
manage. The aim was legitimate enough; unfortunately, it appears that,
in the context of investing really sizable funds, the aim cannot be
accomplished without incurring sizable risks. And in a comparatively
short time the risks came home to roost.</p>
<p>Several of the circumstances surrounding the “performance” phenomenon
caused ominous headshaking by those of us whose experience went far
back—even to the 1920s—and whose views, for that very reason, were
considered old-fashioned and irrelevant to this (second) “New Era.” In
the first place, and on this very point, nearly all these brilliant
performers were young men—in their thirties and forties—whose direct
financial experience was limited to the all but continuous bull market
of 1948–1968. Secondly, they often acted as if the definition of a
“sound investment” was a stock that was likely to have a good rise in
the market in the next few months. This led to large commitments in
newer ventures at prices completely disproportionate to their assets or
recorded earnings. They could be “justified” only by a combination of
naïve hope in the future accomplishments of these enterprises with an
apparent shrewdness in exploiting the speculative enthusiasms of the
uninformed and greedy public.</p>
<p>This section will not mention people’s names. But we have every
reason to give concrete examples of companies. The “performance fund”
most in the public’s eye was undoubtedly Manhattan Fund, Inc., organized
at the end of 1965. Its first offering was of 27 million shares at .25
to 0 per share. The company started out with 47 million of capital. Its
emphasis was, of course, on capital gains. Most of its funds were
invested in issues selling at high multipliers of current earnings,
paying no dividends (or very small ones), with a large speculative
following and spectacular price movements. The fund showed an overall
gain of 38.6% in 1967, against 11% for the S andandandand P composite
index. But thereafter its performance left much to be desired, as is
shown in Table 9-2.</p>
<p>The portfolio of Manhattan Fund at the end of 1969 was unorthodox to
say the least. It is an extraordinary fact that two of its largest
investments were in companies that filed for bankruptcy within six
months thereafter, and a third faced creditors’ actions in 1971. It is
another extraordinary fact that shares of at least one of these doomed
companies were bought not only by investment funds but by university
endowment funds, the trust departments of large banking institutions,
and the like.* A third extraordinary fact was that the founder-manager
of Manhattan Fund sold his stock in a separately organized management
company to another large concern for over 0 million in its stock; at
that time the management company sold had less than million in assets.
This is undoubtedly one of the greatest disparities of all times between
the results for the “manager” and the “managees.”</p>
<p>A book published at the end of 19692 provided profiles of nineteen
men “who are tops at the demanding game of managing billions of dollars
of other people’s money.” The summary told us further that “they are
young…some earn more than a million dollars a year…they are a new
financial breed…they all have a total fascination with the market…and a
spectacular knack for coming up with winners.” A fairly good idea of the
accomplishments of this top group can be obtained by examining the
published results of the funds they manage. Such results are available
for funds directed by twelve of the nineteen persons described in The
Money Managers. Typically enough, they showed up well in 1966, and
brilliantly in 1967. In 1968 their performance was still good in the
aggregate, but mixed as to individual funds. In 1969 they all showed
losses, with only one managing to do a bit better than the S
andandandand P composite index. In 1970 their comparative performance
was even worse than in 1969.</p>
<p>We have presented this picture in order to point a moral, which
perhaps can best be expressed by the old French proverb: Plus ça change,
plus c’est la même chose. Bright, energetic people—usually quite
young—have promised to perform miracles with “other people’s money”
since time immemorial. They have usually been able to do it for a
while—or at least to appear to have done it—and they have inevitably
brought losses to their public in the end.* About a half century ago the
“miracles” were often accompanied by flagrant manipulation, misleading
corporate reporting, outrageous capitalization structures, and other
semifraudulent financial practices. All this brought on an elaborate
system of financial controls by the SEC, as well as a cautious attitude
toward common stocks on the part of the general public. The operations
of the new “money managers” in 1965–1969 came a little more than one
full generation after the shenanigans of 1926–1929.† The specific
malpractices banned after the 1929 crash were no longer resorted to—they
involved the risk of jail sentences. But in many corners of Wall Street
they were replaced by newer gadgets and gimmicks that produced very
similar results in the end. Outright manipulation of prices disappeared,
but there were many other methods of drawing the gullible public’s
attention to the profit possibilities in “hot” issues. Blocks of “letter
stock”3 could be bought well below the quoted market price, subject to
undisclosed restrictions on their sale; they could immediately be
carried in the reports at their full market value, showing a lovely and
illusory profit. And so on. It is amazing how, in a completely different
atmosphere of regulation and prohibitions, Wall Street was able to
duplicate so much of the excesses and errors of the 1920s.</p>
<p>No doubt there will be new regulations and new prohibitions. The
specific abuses of the late 1960s will be fairly adequately banned from
Wall Street. But it is probably too much to expect that the urge to
speculate will ever disappear, or that the exploitation of that urge can
ever be abolished. It is part of the armament of the intelligent
investor to know about these “Extraordinary Popular Delusions,”4 and to
keep as far away from them as possible.</p>
<p>The picture of most of the performance funds is a poor one if we
start after their spectacular record in 1967. With the 1967 figures
included, their overall showing is not at all disastrous. On that basis
one of “The Money Managers” operators did quite a bit better than the S
andandandand P composite index, three did distinctly worse, and six did
about the same. Let us take as a check another group of performance
funds—the ten that made the best showing in 1967, with gains ranging
from 84% up to 301% in that single year. Of these, four gave a better
overall four-year performance than the S andandandand P index, if the
1967 gains are included; and two excelled the index in 1968–1970. None
of these funds was large, and the average size was about 0 million.
Thus, there is a strong indication that smaller size is a necessary
factor for obtaining continued outstanding results.</p>
<p>The foregoing account contains the implicit conclusion that there may
be special risks involved in looking for superior performance by
investment-fund managers. All financial experience up to now indicates
that large funds, soundly managed, can produce at best only slightly
better than average results over the years. If they are unsoundly
managed they can produce spectacular, but largely illusory, profits for
a while, followed inevitably by calamitous losses. There have been
instances of funds that have consistently outperformed the market
averages for, say, ten years or more. But these have been scarce
exceptions, having most of their operations in specialized fields, with
self-imposed limits on the capital employed—and not actively sold to the
public.*</p>
<p>Closed-End versus Open-End Funds</p>
<p>Almost all the mutual funds or open-end funds, which offer their
holders the right to cash in their shares at each day’s valuation of the
portfolio, have a corresponding machinery for selling new shares. By
this means most of them have grown in size over the years. The
closed-end companies, nearly all of which were organized a long time
ago, have a fixed capital structure, and thus have diminished in
relative dollar importance. Open-end companies are being sold by many
thousands of energetic and persuasive salesmen, the closed-end shares
have no one especially interested in distributing them. Consequently it
has been possible to sell most “mutual funds” to the public at a fixed
premium of about 9% above net asset value (to cover salesmen’s
commissions, etc.), while the majority of close-end shares have been
consistently obtainable at less than their asset value. This price
discount has varied among individual companies, and the average discount
for the group as a whole has also varied from one date to another.
Figures on this point for 1961–1970 are given in Table 9-3.</p>
<p>It does not take much shrewdness to suspect that the lower relative
price for closed-end as against open-end shares has very little to do
with the difference in the overall investment results between the two
groups. That this is true is indicated by the comparison of the annual
results for 1961–1970 of the two groups included in Table 9-3.</p>
<p>Thus we arrive at one of the few clearly evident rules for investors’
choices. If you want to put money in investment funds, buy a group of
closed-end shares at a discount of, say, 10% to 15% from asset value,
instead of paying a premium of about 9% above asset value for shares of
an open-end company. Assuming that the future dividends and changes in
asset values continue to be about the same for the two groups, you will
thus obtain about one-fifth more for your money from the closed-end
shares.</p>
<p>The mutual-fund salesman will be quick to counter with the argument:
“Ah, but if you own closed-end shares you can never be sure what price
you can sell them for. The discount can be greater than it is today, and
you will suffer from the wider spread. With our shares you are
guaranteed the right to turn in your shares at 100% of asset value,
never less.” Let us examine this argument a bit; it will be a good
exercise in logic and plain common sense. Question: Assuming that the
discount on closed-end shares does widen, how likely is it that you will
be worse off with those shares than with an otherwise equivalent
purchase of open-end shares?</p>
<p>TABLE 9-3 Certain Data on Closed-End Funds, Mutual Funds, and S
andandandand P Composite Index</p>
<p>This calls for a little arithmetic. Assume that Investor A buys some
open-end shares at 109% of asset value, and Investor B buys closed-end
shares at 85% thereof, plus 1½% commission. Both sets of shares earn and
pay 30% of this asset value in, say, four years, and end up with the
same value as at the beginning. Investor A redeems his shares at 100% of
value, losing the 9% premium he paid. His overall return for the period
is 30% less 9%, or 21% on asset value. This, in turn, is 19% on his
investment. How much must Investor B realize on his closed-end shares to
obtain the same return on his investment as Investor A? The answer is
73%, or a discount of 27% from asset value. In other words, the
closed-end man could suffer a widening of 12 points in the market
discount (about double) before his return would get down to that of the
open-end investor. An adverse change of this magnitude has happened
rarely, if ever, in the history of closed-end shares. Hence it is very
unlikely that you will obtain a lower overall return from a
(representative) closed-end company, bought at a discount, if its
investment performance is about equal to that of a representative mutual
fund. If a small-load (or no-load) fund is substituted for one with the
usual “8½%” load, the advantage of the closed-end investment is of
course reduced, but it remains an advantage.</p>
<p>The fact that a few closed-end funds are selling at premiums greater
than the true 9% charge on most mutual funds introduces a separate
question for the investor. Do these premium companies enjoy superior
management of sufficient proven worth to warrant their elevated prices?
If the answer is sought in the comparative results for the past five or
ten years, the answer would appear to be no. Three of the six premium
companies have mainly foreign investments. A striking feature of these
is the large variation in prices in a few years’ time; at the end of
1970 one sold at only one-quarter of its high, another at a third,
another at less than half. If we consider the three domestic companies
selling above asset value, we find that the average of their ten-year
overall returns was somewhat better than that of ten discount funds, but
the opposite was true in the last five years. A comparison of the
1961–1970 record of Lehman Corp. and of General American Investors, two
of our oldest and largest closed-end companies, is given in Table 9-5.
One of these sold 14% above and the other 7.6% below its net-asset value
at the end of 1970. The difference in price to net-asset relationships
did not appear warranted by these figures.</p>
<p>Investment in Balanced Funds</p>
<p>The 23 balanced funds covered in the Wiesenberger Report had between
25% and 59% of their assets in preferred stocks and bonds, the average
being just 40%. The balance was held in common stocks. It would appear
more logical for the typical investor to make his bond-type investments
directly, rather than to have them form part of a mutual-fund
commitment. The average income return shown by these balanced funds in
1970 was only 3.9% per annum on asset value, or say 3.6% on the offering
price. The better choice for the bond component would be the purchase of
United States savings bonds, or corporate bonds rated A or better, or
tax-free bonds, for the investor’s bond portfolio.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 9</p>
<p>The schoolteacher asks Billy Bob: “If you have twelve sheep and one
jumps over the fence, how many sheep do you have left?”</p>
<p>Billy Bob answers, “None.”</p>
<p>“Well,” says the teacher, “you sure don’t know your subtraction.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not,” Billy Bob replies, “but I darn sure know my sheep.”</p>
<p>—an old Texas joke</p>
<p>Almost Perfect</p>
<p>A purely American creation, the mutual fund was introduced in 1924 by
a former salesman of aluminum pots and pans named Edward G. Leffler.
Mutual funds are quite cheap, very convenient, generally diversified,
professionally managed, and tightly regulated under some of the toughest
provisions of Federal securities law. By making investing easy and
affordable for almost anyone, the funds have brought some 54 million
American families (and millions more around the world) into the
investing mainstream—probably the greatest advance in financial
democracy ever achieved.</p>
<p>But mutual funds aren’t perfect; they are almost perfect, and that
word makes all the difference. Because of their imperfections, most
funds underperform the market, overcharge their investors, create tax
headaches, and suffer erratic swings in performance. The intelligent
investor must choose funds with great care in order to avoid ending up
owning a big fat mess.</p>
<p>Top of the Charts</p>
<p>Most investors simply buy a fund that has been going up fast, on the
assumption that it will keep on going. And why not? Psychologists have
shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run
can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes. What’s more, we
know from our own experience that some plumbers are far better than
others, that some baseball players are much more likely to hit home
runs, that our favorite restaurant serves consistently superior food,
and that smart kids get consistently good grades. Skill and brains and
hard work are recognized, rewarded—and consistently repeated—all around
us. So, if a fund beats the market, our intuition tells us to expect it
to keep right on outperforming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the financial markets, luck is more important than
skill. If a manager happens to be in the right corner of the market at
just the right time, he will look brilliant—but all too often, what was
hot suddenly goes cold and the manager’s IQ seems to shrivel by 50
points. Figure 9-1 shows what happened to the hottest funds of 1999.</p>
<p>This is yet another reminder that the market’s hottest market
sector—in 1999, that was technology—often turns as cold as liquid
nitrogen, with blinding speed and utterly no warning.1 And it’s a
reminder that buying funds based purely on their past performance is one
of the stupidest things an investor can do. Financial scholars have been
studying mutual-fund performance for at least a half century, and they
are virtually unanimous on several points:</p>
<p>the average fund does not pick stocks well enough to overcome its
costs of researching and trading them;</p>
<p>the higher a fund’s expenses, the lower its returns;</p>
<p>the more frequently a fund trades its stocks, the less it tends to
earn;</p>
<p>highly volatile funds, which bounce up and down more than average,
are likely to stay volatile;</p>
<p>funds with high past returns are unlikely to remain winners for
long.2</p>
<p>Your chances of selecting the top-performing funds of the future on
the basis of their returns in the past are about as high as the odds
that Bigfoot and the Abominable Snowman will both show up in pink ballet
slippers at your next cocktail party. In other words, your chances are
not zero—but they’re pretty close. (See sidebar, p. 255.)</p>
<p>But there’s good news, too. First of all, understanding why it’s so
hard to find a good fund will help you become a more intelligent
investor. Second, while past performance is a poor predictor of future
returns, there are other factors that you can use to increase your odds
of finding a good fund. Finally, a fund can offer excellent value even
if it doesn’t beat the market—by providing an economical way to
diversify your holdings and by freeing up your time for all the other
things you would rather be doing than picking your own stocks.</p>
<p>The First shall be Last</p>
<p>Why don’t more winning funds stay winners?</p>
<p>The better a fund performs, the more obstacles its investors
face:</p>
<p>Migrating managers. When a stock picker seems to have the Midas
touch, everyone wants him—including rival fund companies. If you bought
Transamerica Premier Equity Fund to cash in on the skills of Glen
Bickerstaff, who gained 47.5% in 1997, you were quickly out of luck; TCW
snatched him away in mid-1998 to run its TCW Galileo Select Equities
Fund, and the Transamerica fund lagged the market in three of the next
four years. If you bought Fidelity Aggressive Growth Fund in early 2000
to capitalize on the high returns of Erin Sullivan, who had nearly
tripled her shareholders’ money since 1997, oh well: She quit to start
her own hedge fund in 2000, and her former fund lost more than
three-quarters of its value over the next three years.3</p>
<p>Asset elephantiasis. When a fund earns high returns, investors
notice—often pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars in a matter of
weeks. That leaves the fund manager with few choices—all of them bad. He
can keep that money safe for a rainy day, but then the low returns on
cash will crimp the fund’s results if stocks keep going up. He can put
the new money into the stocks he already owns—which have probably gone
up since he first bought them and will become dangerously overvalued if
he pumps in millions of dollars more. Or he can buy new stocks he didn’t
like well enough to own already—but he will have to research them from
scratch and keep an eye on far more companies than he is used to
following.</p>
<p>Finally, when the 00-million Nimble Fund puts 2% of its assets (or
million) in Minnow Corp., a stock with a total market value of 00
million, it’s buying up less than one-half of 1% of Minnow. But if hot
performance swells the Nimble Fund to 0 billion, then an investment of
2% of its assets would total 00 million—nearly half the entire value of
Minnow, a level of ownership that isn’t even permissible under Federal
law. If Nimble’s portfolio manager still wants to own small stocks, he
will have to spread his money over vastly more companies—and probably
end up spreading his attention too thin.</p>
<p>No more fancy footwork. Some companies specialize in “incubating”
their funds—test-driving them privately before selling them publicly.
(Typically, the only shareholders are employees and affiliates of the
fund company itself.) By keeping them tiny, the sponsor can use these
incubated funds as guinea pigs for risky strategies that work best with
small sums of money, like buying truly tiny stocks or rapid-fire trading
of initial public offerings. If its strategy succeeds, the fund can lure
public investors en masse by publicizing its private returns. In other
cases, the fund manager “waives” (or skips charging) management fees,
raising the net return—then slaps the fees on later after the high
returns attract plenty of customers. Almost without exception, the
returns of incubated and fee-waived funds have faded into mediocrity
after outside investors poured millions of dollars into them.</p>
<p>Rising expenses. It often costs more to trade stocks in very large
blocks than in small ones; with fewer buyers and sellers, it’s harder to
make a match. A fund with 00 million in assets might pay 1% a year in
trading costs. But, if high returns send the fund mushrooming up to 0
billion, its trades could easily eat up at least 2% of those assets. The
typical fund holds on to its stocks for only 11 months at a time, so
trading costs eat away at returns like a corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the
other costs of running a fund rarely fall—and sometimes even rise—as
assets grow. With operating expenses averaging 1.5%, and trading costs
at around 2%, the typical fund has to beat the market by 3.5 percentage
points per year before costs just to match it after costs!</p>
<p>Sheepish behavior. Finally, once a fund becomes successful, its
managers tend to become timid and imitative. As a fund grows, its fees
become more lucrative—making its managers reluctant to rock the boat.
The very risks that the managers took to generate their initial high
returns could now drive investors away—and jeopardize all that fat fee
income. So the biggest funds resemble a herd of identical and overfed
sheep, all moving in sluggish lockstep, all saying “baaaa” at the same
time. Nearly every growth fund owns Cisco and GE and Microsoft and
Pfizer and Wal-Mart—and in almost identical proportions. This behavior
is so prevalent that finance scholars simply call it herding.4 But by
protecting their own fee income, fund managers compromise their ability
to produce superior returns for their outside investors.</p>
<p>FIGURE 9-2 The Funnel of Fund Performance</p>
<p>Looking back from December 31, 2002, how many U.S. stock funds
outperformed Vanguard 500 Index Fund?</p>
<p>One year:</p>
<p>1,186 of 2,423 funds (or 48.9%)</p>
<p>Three years:</p>
<p>1,157 of 1,944 funds (or 59.5%)</p>
<p>Five years:</p>
<p>768 of 1,494 funds (or 51.4%)</p>
<p>Ten years:</p>
<p>227 of 728 funds (or 31.2%)</p>
<p>Fifteen years:</p>
<p>125 of 445 funds (or 28.1%)</p>
<p>Twenty years:</p>
<p>37 of 248 funds (or 14.9%)</p>
<p>Source: Lipper Inc.</p>
<p>Because of their fat costs and bad behavior, most funds fail to earn
their keep. No wonder high returns are nearly as perishable as
unrefrigerated fish. What’s more, as time passes, the drag of their
excessive expenses leaves most funds farther and farther behind, as
Figure 9.2 shows.5</p>
<p>What, then, should the intelligent investor do?</p>
<p>First of all, recognize that an index fund—which owns all the stocks
in the market, all the time, without any pretense of being able to
select the “best” and avoid the “worst”—will beat most funds over the
long run. (If your company doesn’t offer a low-cost index fund in your
401(k), organize your coworkers and petition to have one added.) Its
rock-bottom overhead—operating expenses of 0.2% annually, and yearly
trading costs of just 0.1%—give the index fund an insurmountable
advantage. If stocks generate, say, a 7% annualized return over the next
20 years, a low-cost index fund like Vanguard Total Stock Market will
return just under 6.7%. (That would turn a 0,000 investment into more
than 6,000.) But the average stock fund, with its 1.5% in operating
expenses and roughly 2% in trading costs, will be lucky to gain 3.5%
annually. (That would turn 0,000 into just under 0,000—or nearly 50%
less than the result from the index fund.)</p>
<p>Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring. You’ll
never be able to go to a barbecue and brag about how you own the
top-performing fund in the country. You’ll never be able to boast that
you beat the market, because the job of an index fund is to match the
market’s return, not to exceed it. Your index-fund manager is not likely
to “roll the dice” and gamble that the next great industry will be
teleportation, or scratch-’n’-sniff websites, or telepathic weight-loss
clinics; the fund will always own every stock, not just one manager’s
best guess at the next new thing. But, as the years pass, the cost
advantage of indexing will keep accruing relentlessly. Hold an index
fund for 20 years or more, adding new money every month, and you are all
but certain to outper-forms the vast majority of professional and
individual investors alike. Late in his life, Graham praised index funds
as the best choice for individual investors, as does Warren
Buffett.6</p>
<p>Tilting the Tables</p>
<p>When you add up all their handicaps, the wonder is not that so few
funds beat the index, but that any do. And yet, some do. What qualities
do they have in common?</p>
<p>Their managers are the biggest shareholders. The conflict of interest
between what’s best for the fund’s managers and what’s best for its
investors is mitigated when the managers are among the biggest owners of
the fund’s shares. Some firms, like Longleaf Partners, even forbid their
employees from owning anything but their own funds. At Longleaf and
other firms like Davis and FPA, the managers own so much of the funds
that they are likely to manage your money as if it were their
own—lowering the odds that they will jack up fees, let the funds swell
to gargantuan size, or whack you with a nasty tax bill. A fund’s proxy
statement and Statement of Additional Information, both available from
the Securities and Exchange Commission through the EDGAR database at
www.sec.gov, disclose whether the managers own at least 1% of the fund’s
shares.</p>
<p>They are cheap. One of the most common myths in the fund business is
that “you get what you pay for”—that high returns are the best
justification for higher fees. There are two problems with this
argument. First, it isn’t true; decades of research have proven that
funds with higher fees earn lower returns over time. Secondly, high
returns are temporary, while high fees are nearly as permanent as
granite. If you buy a fund for its hot returns, you may well end up with
a handful of cold ashes—but your costs of owning the fund are almost
certain not to decline when its returns do.</p>
<p>They dare to be different. When Peter Lynch ran Fidelity Magellan, he
bought whatever seemed cheap to him—regardless of what other fund
managers owned. In 1982, his biggest investment was Treasury bonds;
right after that, he made Chrysler his top holding, even though most
experts expected the automaker to go bankrupt; then, in 1986, Lynch put
almost 20% of Fidelity Magellan in foreign stocks like Honda, Norsk
Hydro, and Volvo. So, before you buy a U.S. stock fund, compare the
holdings listed in its latest report against the roster of the S
andandandand P 500 index; if they look like Tweedledee and Tweedledum,
shop for another fund.7</p>
<p>They shut the door. The best funds often close to new
investors—permitting only their existing shareholders to buy more. That
stops the feeding frenzy of new buyers who want to pile in at the top
and protects the fund from the pains of asset elephantiasis. It’s also a
signal that the fund managers are not putting their own wallets ahead of
yours. But the closing should occur before—not after—the fund explodes
in size. Some companies with an exemplary record of shutting their own
gates are Longleaf, Numeric, Oakmark, T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, and
Wasatch.</p>
<p>They don’t advertise. Just as Plato says in The Republic that the
ideal rulers are those who do not want to govern, the best fund managers
often behave as if they don’t want your money. They don’t appear
constantly on financial television or run ads boasting of their No. 1
returns. The steady little Mairs andandandand Power Growth Fund didn’t
even have a website until 2001 and still sells its shares in only 24
states. The Torray Fund has never run a retail advertisement since its
launch in 1990.</p>
<p>What else should you watch for? Most fund buyers look at past
performance first, then at the manager’s reputation, then at the
riskiness of the fund, and finally (if ever) at the fund’s
expenses.8</p>
<p>The intelligent investor looks at those same things—but in the
opposite order.</p>
<p>Since a fund’s expenses are far more predictable than its future risk
or return, you should make them your first filter. There’s no good
reason ever to pay more than these levels of annual operating expenses,
by fund category:</p>
<p>Taxable and municipal bonds: 0.75%</p>
<p>U.S. equities (large and mid-sized stocks): 1.0%</p>
<p>High-yield (junk) bonds: 1.0%</p>
<p>U.S. equities (small stocks): 1.25%</p>
<p>Foreign stocks: 1.50%9</p>
<p>Next, evaluate risk. In its prospectus (or buyer’s guide), every fund
must show a bar graph displaying its worst loss over a calendar quarter.
If you can’t stand losing at least that much money in three months, go
elsewhere. It’s also worth checking a fund’s Morningstar rating. A
leading investment research firm, Morningstar awards “star ratings” to
funds, based on how much risk they took to earn their returns (one star
is the worst, five is the best). But, just like past performance itself,
these ratings look back in time; they tell you which funds were the
best, not which are going to be. Five-star funds, in fact, have a
disconcerting habit of going on to underperform one-star funds. So first
find a low-cost fund whose managers are major shareholders, dare to be
different, don’t hype their returns, and have shown a willingness to
shut down before they get too big for their britches. Then, and only
then, consult their Morningstar rating.10</p>
<p>Finally, look at past performance, remembering that it is only a pale
predictor of future returns. As we’ve already seen, yesterday’s winners
often become tomorrow’s losers. But researchers have shown that one
thing is almost certain: Yesterday’s losers almost never become
tomorrow’s winners. So avoid funds with consistently poor past
returns—especially if they have above-average annual expenses.</p>
<p>The Closed World of Closed-End Funds</p>
<p>Closed-end stock funds, although popular during the 1980s, have
slowly atrophied. Today, there are only 30 diversified domestic equity
funds, many of them tiny, trading only a few hundred shares a day, with
high expenses and weird strategies (like Morgan Fun-Shares, which
specializes in the stocks of “habit-forming” industries like booze,
casinos, and cigarettes). Research by closed-end fund expert Donald
Cassidy of Lipper Inc. reinforces Graham’s earlier observations:
Diversified closed-end stock funds trading at a discount not only tend
to outper-forms those trading at a premium but are likely to have a
better return than the average open-end mutual fund. Sadly, however,
diversified closed-end stock funds are not always available at a
discount in what has become a dusty, dwindling market.11</p>
<p>But there are hundreds of closed-end bond funds, with especially
strong choices available in the municipal-bond area. When these funds
trade at a discount, their yield is amplified and they can be
attractive, so long as their annual expenses are below the thresholds
listed above.12</p>
<p>The new breed of exchange-traded index funds can be worth exploring
as well. These low-cost “ETFs” sometimes offer the only means by which
an investor can gain entrée to a narrow market like, say, companies
based in Belgium or stocks in the semiconductor industry. Other index
ETFs offer much broader market exposure. However, they are generally not
suitable for investors who wish to add money regularly, since most
brokers will charge a separate commission on every new investment you
make.13</p>
<p>Know When to Fold ’Em</p>
<p>Once you own a fund, how can you tell when it’s time to sell? The
standard advice is to ditch a fund if it underperforms the market (or
similar portfolios) for one—or is it two?—or is it three?—years in a
row. But this advice makes no sense. From its birth in 1970 through
1999, the Sequoia Fund underperformed the S andandandand P 500 index in
12 out of its 29 years—or more than 41% of the time. Yet Sequoia gained
more than 12,500% over that period, versus 4,900% for the index.14</p>
<p>The performance of most funds falters simply because the type of
stocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. If you hired a manager
to invest in a particular way, why fire him for doing what he promised?
By selling when a style of investing is out of fashion, you not only
lock in a loss but lock yourself out of the all-but-inevitable recovery.
One study showed that mutual-fund investors underperformed their own
funds by 4.7 percentage points annually from 1998 through 2001—simply by
buying high and selling low.15</p>
<p>So when should you sell? Here a few definite red flags:</p>
<p>a sharp and unexpected change in strategy, such as a “value” fund
loading up on technology stocks in 1999 or a “growth” fund buying tons
of insurance stocks in 2002;</p>
<p>an increase in expenses, suggesting that the managers are lining
their own pockets;</p>
<p>large and frequent tax bills generated by excessive trading;</p>
<p>suddenly erratic returns, as when a formerly conservative fund
generates a big loss (or even produces a giant gain).</p>
<p>WHY WE LOVE OUR OUIJA BOARDS</p>
<p>Believing—or even just hoping—that we can pick the best funds of the
future makes us feel better. It gives us the pleasing sensation that we
are in charge of our own investment destiny. This “I’m-in-control-here”
feeling is part of the human condition; it’s what psychologists call
overconfidence. Here are just a few examples of how it works:</p>
<p>In 1999, Money Magazine asked more than 500 people whether their
portfolios had beaten the market. One in four said yes. When asked to
specify their returns, however, 80% of those investors reported gains
lower than the market’s. (Four percent had no idea how much their
portfolios rose—but were sure they had beaten the market anyway!)</p>
<p>A Swedish study asked drivers who had been in severe car crashes to
rate their own skills behind the wheel. These people—including some the
police had found responsible for the accidents and others who had been
so badly injured that they answered the survey from their hospital
beds—insisted they were better-than-average drivers.</p>
<p>In a poll taken in late 2000, Time and CNN asked more than 1,000
likely voters whether they thought they were in the top 1% of the
population by income. Nineteen percent placed themselves among the
richest 1% of Americans.</p>
<p>In late 1997, a survey of 750 investors found that 74% believed their
mutual-fund holdings would “consistently beat the Standard andandandand
Poor’s 500 each year”—even though most funds fail to beat the S
andandandand P 500 in the long run and many fail to beat it in any
year.1</p>
<p>While this kind of optimism is a normal sign of a healthy psyche,
that doesn’t make it good investment policy. It makes sense to believe
you can predict something only if it actually is predictable. Unless you
are realistic, your quest for self-esteem will end up in
self-defeat.</p>
<p>As the investment consultant Charles Ellis puts it, “If you’re not
prepared to stay married, you shouldn’t get married.”16 Fund investing
is no different. If you’re not prepared to stick with a fund through at
least three lean years, you shouldn’t buy it in the first place.
Patience is the fund investor’s single most powerful ally.</p>
