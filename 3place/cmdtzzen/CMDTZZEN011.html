<p>The Investor and His Advisers</p>
<p>The investment of money in securities is unique among business
operations in that it is almost always based in some degree on advice
received from others. The great bulk of investors are amateurs.
Naturally they feel that in choosing their securities they can profit by
professional guidance. Yet there are peculiarities inherent in the very
concept of investment advice.</p>
<p>If the reason people invest is to make money, then in seeking advice
they are asking others to tell them how to make money. That idea has
some element of naïveté. Businessmen seek professional advice on various
elements of their business, but they do not expect to be told how to
make a profit. That is their own bailiwick. When they, or nonbusiness
people, rely on others to make investment profits for them, they are
expecting a kind of result for which there is no true counterpart in
ordinary business affairs.</p>
<p>If we assume that there are normal or standard income results to be
obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of the
adviser can be more readily established. He will use his superior
training and experience to protect his clients against mistakes and to
make sure that they obtain the results to which their money is entitled.
It is when the investor demands more than an average return on his
money, or when his adviser undertakes to do better for him, that the
question arises whether more is being asked or promised than is likely
to be delivered.</p>
<p>Advice on investments may be obtained from a variety of sources.
These include: (1) a relative or friend, presumably knowledgeable in
securities; (2) a local (commercial) banker; (3) a brokerage firm or
investment banking house; (4) a financial service or periodical; and (5)
an investment counselor.* The miscellaneous character of this list
suggests that no logical or systematic approach in this matter has
crystallized, as yet, in the minds of investors.</p>
<p>Certain common-sense considerations relate to the criterion of normal
or standard results mentioned above. Our basic thesis is this: If the
investor is to rely chiefly on the advice of others in handling his
funds, then either he must limit himself and his advisers strictly to
standard, conservative, and even unimaginative forms of investment, or
he must have an unusually intimate and favorable knowledge of the person
who is going to direct his funds into other channels. But if the
ordinary business or professional relationship exists between the
investor and his advisers, he can be receptive to less conventional
suggestions only to the extent that he himself has grown in knowledge
and experience and has therefore become competent to pass independent
judgment on the recommendations of others. He has then passed from the
category of defensive or unenterprising investor into that of aggressive
or enterprising investor.</p>
<p>Investment Counsel and Trust Services of Banks</p>
<p>The truly professional investment advisers—that is, the
well-established investment counsel firms, who charge substantial annual
fees—are quite modest in their promises and pretentions. For the most
part they place their clients’ funds in standard interest- and
dividend-paying securities, and they rely mainly on normal investment
experience for their overall results. In the typical case it is doubtful
whether more than 10% of the total fund is ever invested in securities
other than those of leading companies, plus government bonds (including
state and municipal issues); nor do they make a serious effort to take
advantage of swings in the general market.</p>
<p>The leading investment-counsel firms make no claim to being
brilliant; they do pride themselves on being careful, conservative, and
competent. Their primary aim is to conserve the principal value over the
years and produce a conservatively acceptable rate of income. Any
accomplishment beyond that—and they do strive to better the goal—they
regard in the nature of extra service rendered. Perhaps their chief
value to their clients lies in shielding them from costly mistakes. They
offer as much as the defensive investor has the right to expect from any
counselor serving the general public.</p>
<p>What we have said about the well-established investment-counsel firms
applies generally to the trust and advisory services of the larger
banks.*</p>
<p>Financial Services</p>
<p>The so-called financial services are organizations that send out
uniform bulletins (sometimes in the form of telegrams) to their
subscribers. The subjects covered may include the state and prospects of
business, the behavior and prospect of the securities markets, and
information and advice regarding individual issues. There is often an
“inquiry department” which will answer questons affecting an individual
subscriber. The cost of the service averages much less than the fee that
investment counselors charge their individual clients. Some
organizations—notably Babson’s and Standard andandandand Poor’s—operate
on separate levels as a financial service and as investment counsel.
(Incidentally, other organizations—such as Scudder, Stevens andandandand
Clark—operate separately as investment counsel and as one or more
investment funds.)</p>
<p>The financial services direct themselves, on the whole, to a quite
different segment of the public than do the investment-counsel firms.
The latters’ clients generally wish to be relieved of bother and the
need for making decisions. The financial services offer information and
guidance to those who are directing their own financial affairs or are
themselves advising others. Many of these services confine themselves
exclusively, or nearly so, to forecasting market movements by various
“technical” methods. We shall dismiss these with the observation that
their work does not concern “investors” as the term is used in this
book.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the best known—such as Moody’s Investment
Service and Standard andandandand Poor’s—are identified with statistical
organizations that compile the voluminous statistical data that form the
basis for all serious security analysis. These services have a varied
clientele, ranging from the most conservative-minded investor to the
rankest speculator. As a result they must find it difficult to adhere to
any clear-cut or fundamental philosophy in arriving at their opinions
and recommendations.</p>
<p>An old-established service of the type of Moody’s and the others must
obviously provide something worthwhile to a broad class of investors.
What is it? Basically they address themselves to the matters in which
the average active investor-speculator is interested, and their views on
these either command some measure of authority or at least appear more
reliable than those of the unaided client.</p>
<p>For years the financial services have been making stock-market
forecasts without anyone taking this activity very seriously. Like
everyone else in the field they are sometimes right and sometimes wrong.
Wherever possible they hedge their opinions so as to avoid the risk of
being proved completely wrong. (There is a well-developed art of Delphic
phrasing that adjusts itself successfully to whatever the future
brings.) In our view—perhaps a prejudiced one—this segment of their work
has no real significance except for the light it throws on human nature
in the securities markets. Nearly everyone interested in common stocks
wants to be told by someone else what he thinks the market is going to
do. The demand being there, it must be supplied.</p>
<p>Their interpretations and forecasts of business conditions, of
course, are much more authoritative and informing. These are an
important part of the great body of economic intelligence which is
spread continuously among buyers and sellers of securities and tends to
create fairly rational prices for stocks and bonds under most
circumstances. Undoubtedly the material published by the financial
services adds to the store of information available and fortifies the
investment judgment of their clients.</p>
<p>It is difficult to evaluate their recommendations of individual
securities. Each service is entitled to be judged separately, and the
verdict could properly be based only on an elaborate and inclusive study
covering many years. In our own experience we have noted among them a
pervasive attitude which we think tends to impair what could otherwise
be more useful advisory work. This is their general view that a stock
should be bought if the near-term prospects of the business are
favorable and should be sold if these are unfavorable—regardless of the
current price. Such a superficial principle often prevents the services
from doing the sound analytical job of which their staffs are
capable—namely, to ascertain whether a given stock appears over- or
undervalued at the current price in the light of its indicated long-term
future earning power.</p>
<p>The intelligent investor will not do his buying and selling solely on
the basis of recommendations received from a financial service. Once
this point is established, the role of the financial service then
becomes the useful one of supplying information and offering
suggestions.</p>
<p>Advice from Brokerage Houses</p>
<p>Probably the largest volume of information and advice to the
security-owning public comes from stockbrokers. These are members of the
New York Stock Exchange, and of other exchanges, who execute buying and
selling orders for a standard commission. Practically all the houses
that deal with the public maintain a “statistical” or analytical
department, which answers inquiries and makes recommendations. A great
deal of analytical literature, some of it elaborate and expensive, is
distributed gratis to the firms’ customers—more impressively referred to
as clients.</p>
<p>A great deal is at stake in the innocent-appearing question whether
“customers” or “clients” is the more appropriate name. A business has
customers; a professional person or organization has clients. The Wall
Street brokerage fraternity has probably the highest ethical standards
of any business, but it is still feeling its way toward the standards
and standing of a true profession.*</p>
<p>In the past Wall Street has thrived mainly on speculation, and
stock-market speculators as a class were almost certain to lose money.
Hence it has been logically impossible for brokerage houses to operate
on a thoroughly professional basis. To do that would have required them
to direct their efforts toward reducing rather than increasing their
business.</p>
<p>The farthest that certain brokerage houses have gone in that
direction—and could have been expected to go—is to refrain from inducing
or encouraging anyone to speculate. Such houses have confined themselves
to executing orders given them, to supplying financial information and
analyses, and to rendering opinions on the investment merits of
securities. Thus, in theory at least, they are devoid of all
responsibility for either the profits or the losses of their speculative
customers.†</p>
<p>Most stock-exchange houses, however, still adhere to the old-time
slogans that they are in business to make commissions and that the way
to succeed in business is to give the customers what they want. Since
the most profitable customers want speculative advice and suggestions,
the thinking and activities of the typical firm are pretty closely
geared to day-to-day trading in the market. Thus it tries hard to help
its customers make money in a field where they are condemned almost by
mathematical law to lose in the end.† By this we mean that the
speculative part of their operations cannot be profitable over the long
run for most brokeragehouse customers. But to the extent that their
operations resemble true investing they may produce investment gains
that more than offset the speculative losses.</p>
<p>The investor obtains advice and information from stock-exchange
houses through two types of employees, now known officially as
“customers’ brokers” (or “account executives”) and financial
analysts.</p>
<p>The customer’s broker, also called a “registered representative,”
formerly bore the less dignified title of “customer’s man.” Today he is
for the most part an individual of good character and considerable
knowledge of securities, who operates under a rigid code of right
conduct. Nevertheless, since his business is to earn commissions, he can
hardly avoid being speculation-minded. Thus the security buyer who wants
to avoid being influenced by speculative considerations will ordinarily
have to be careful and explicit in his dealing with his customer’s
broker; he will have to show clearly, by word and deed, that he is not
interested in anything faintly resembling a stock-market “tip.” Once the
customer’s broker understands clearly that he has a real investor on his
hands, he will respect this point of view and cooperate with it.</p>
<p>The financial analyst, formerly known chiefly as security analyst, is
a person of particular concern to the author, who has been one himself
for more than five decades and has helped educate countless others. At
this stage we refer only to the financial analysts employed by brokerage
houses. The function of the security analyst is clear enough from his
title. It is he who works up the detailed studies of individual
securities, develops careful comparisons of various issues in the same
field, and forms an expert opinion of the safety or attractiveness or
intrinsic value of all the different kinds of stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>By what must seem a quirk to the outsider there are no formal
requirements for being a security analyst. Contrast with this the facts
that a customer’s broker must pass an examination, meet the required
character tests, and be duly accepted and registered by the New York
Stock Exchange. As a practical matter, nearly all the younger analysts
have had extensive business-school training, and the oldsters have
acquired at least the equivalent in the school of long experience. In
the great majority of cases, the employing brokerage house can be
counted on to assure itself of the qualifications and competence of its
analysts.*</p>
<p>The customer of the brokerage firm may deal with the security
analysts directly, or his contact may be an indirect one via the
customer’s broker. In either case the analyst is available to the client
for a considerable amount of information and advice. Let us make an
emphatic statement here. The value of the security analyst to the
investor depends largely on the investor’s own attitude. If the investor
asks the analyst the right questions, he is likely to get the right—or
at least valuable—answers. The analysts hired by brokerage houses, we
are convinced, are greatly handicapped by the general feeling that they
are supposed to be market analysts as well. When they are asked whether
a given common stock is “sound,” the question often means, “Is this
stock likely to advance during the next few months?” As a result many of
them are compelled to analyze with one eye on the stock ticker—a pose
not conducive to sound thinking or worthwhile conclusions.*</p>
<p>In the next section of this book we shall deal with some of the
concepts and possible achievements of security analysis. A great many
analysts working for stock exchange firms could be of prime assistance
to the bona fide investor who wants to be sure that he gets full value
for his money, and possibly a little more. As in the case of the
customers’ brokers, what is needed at the beginning is a clear
understanding by the analyst of the investor’s attitude and objectives.
Once the analyst is convinced that he is dealing with a man who is
value-minded rather than quotation-minded, there is an excellent chance
that his recommendations will prove of real overall benefit.</p>
<p>The CFA Certificate for Financial Analysts</p>
<p>An important step was taken in 1963 toward giving professional
standing and responsibility to financial analysts. The official title of
chartered financial analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior
practitioners who pass required examinations and meet other tests of
fitness.1 The subjects covered include security analysis and port-folio
management. The analogy with the long-established professional title of
certified public accountant (CPA) is evident and intentional. This
relatively new apparatus of recognition and control should serve to
elevate the standards of financial analysts and eventually to place
their work on a truly professional basis.†</p>
<p>Dealings with Brokerage Houses</p>
<p>One of the most disquieting developments of the period in which we
write this revision has been the financial embarrassment—in plain words,
bankruptcy or near-bankruptcy—of quite a few New York Stock Exchange
firms, including at least two of considerable size.* This is the first
time in half a century or more that such a thing has happened, and it is
startling for more than one reason. For many decades the New York Stock
Exchange has been moving in the direction of closer and stricter
controls over the operations and financial condition of its
members—including minimum capital requirements, surprise audits, and the
like. Besides this, we have had 37 years of control over the exchanges
and their members by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally,
the stock-brokerage industry itself has operated under favorable
conditions—namely, a huge increase in volume, fixed minimum commission
rates (largely eliminating competitive fees), and a limited number of
member firms.</p>
<p>The first financial troubles of the brokerage houses (in 1969) were
attributed to the increase in volume itself. This, it was claimed,
overtaxed their facilities, increased their overhead, and produced many
troubles in making financial settlements. It should be pointed out this
was probably the first time in history that important enterprises have
gone broke because they had more business than they could handle. In
1970, as brokerage failures increased, they were blamed chiefly on “the
falling off in volume.” A strange complaint when one reflects that the
turnover of the NYSE in 1970 totaled 2,937 million shares, the largest
volume in its history and well over twice as large as in any year before
1965. During the 15 years of the bull market ending in 1964 the annual
volume had averaged “only” 712 million shares—one quarter of the 1970
figure—but the brokerage business had enjoyed the greatest prosperity in
its history. If, as it appears, the member firms as a whole had allowed
their overhead and other expenses to increase at a rate that could not
sustain even a mild reduction in volume during part of a year, this does
not speak well for either their business acumen or their financial
conservatism.</p>
<p>A third explanation of the financial trouble finally emerged out of a
mist of concealment, and we suspect that it is the most plausible and
significant of the three. It seems that a good part of the capital of
certain brokerage houses was held in the form of common stocks owned by
the individual partners. Some of these seem to have been highly
speculative and carried at inflated values. When the market declined in
1969 the quotations of such securities fell drastically and a
substantial part of the capital of the firms vanished with them.2 In
effect the partners were speculating with the capital that was supposed
to protect the customers against the ordinary financial hazards of the
brokerage business, in order to make a double profit thereon. This was
inexcusable; we refrain from saying more.</p>
<p>The investor should use his intelligence not only in formulating his
financial policies but also in the associated details. These include the
choice of a reputable broker to execute his orders. Up to now it was
sufficient to counsel our readers to deal only with a member of the New
York Stock Exchange, unless he had compelling reasons to use a nonmember
firm. Reluctantly, we must add some further advice in this area. We
think that people who do not carry margin accounts—and in our vocabulary
this means all nonprofessional investors—should have the delivery and
receipt of their securities handled by their bank. When giving a buying
order to your brokers you can instruct them to deliver the securities
bought to your bank against payment therefor by the bank; conversely,
when selling you can instruct your bank to deliver the securities to the
broker against payment of the proceeds. These services will cost a
little extra but they should be well worth the expense in terms of
safety and peace of mind. This advice may be disregarded, as no longer
called for, after the investor is sure that all the problems of
stock-exchange firms have been disposed of, but not before.*</p>
<p>Investment Bankers</p>
<p>The term “investment banker” is applied to a firm that engages to an
important extent in originating, underwriting, and selling new issues of
stocks and bonds. (To underwrite means to guarantee to the issuing
corporation, or other issuer, that the security will be fully sold.) A
number of the brokerage houses carry on a certain amount of underwriting
activity. Generally this is confined to participating in underwriting
groups formed by leading investment bankers. There is an additional
tendency for brokerage firms to originate and sponsor a minor amount of
new-issue financing, particularly in the form of smaller issues of
common stocks when a bull market is in full swing.</p>
<p>Investment banking is perhaps the most respectable department of the
Wall Street community, because it is here that finance plays its
constructive role of supplying new capital for the expansion of
industry. In fact, much of the theoretical justification for maintaining
active stock markets, notwithstanding their frequent speculative
excesses, lies in the fact that organized security exchanges facilitate
the sale of new issues of bonds and stocks. If investors or speculators
could not expect to see a ready market for a new security offered them,
they might well refuse to buy it.</p>
<p>The relationship between the investment banker and the investor is
basically that of the salesman to the prospective buyer. For many years
past the great bulk of the new offerings in dollar value has consisted
of bond issues that were purchased in the main by financial institutions
such as banks and insurance companies. In this business the security
salesmen have been dealing with shrewd and experienced buyers. Hence any
recommendations made by the investment bankers to these customers have
had to pass careful and skeptical scrutiny. Thus these transactions are
almost always effected on a businesslike footing.</p>
<p>But a different situation obtains in a relationship between the
individual security buyer and the investment banking firms, including
the stockbrokers acting as underwriters. Here the purchaser is
frequently inexperienced and seldom shrewd. He is easily influenced by
what the salesman tells him, especially in the case of common-stock
issues, since often his unconfessed desire in buying is chiefly to make
a quick profit. The effect of all this is that the public investor’s
protection lies less in his own critical faculty than in the scruples
and ethics of the offering houses.3</p>
<p>It is a tribute to the honesty and competence of the underwriting
firms that they are able to combine fairly well the discordant roles of
adviser and salesman. But it is imprudent for the buyer to trust himself
to the judgment of the seller. In 1959 we stated at this point: “The bad
results of this unsound attitude show themselves recurrently in the
underwriting field and with notable effects in the sale of new common
stock issues during periods of active speculation.” Shortly thereafter
this warning proved urgently needed. As already pointed out, the years
1960–61 and, again, 1968–69 were marked by an unprecedented outpouring
of issues of lowest quality, sold to the public at absurdly high
offering prices and in many cases pushed much higher by heedless
speculation and some semi-manipulation. A number of the more important
Wall Street houses have participated to some degree in these less than
creditable activities, which demonstrates that the familiar combination
of greed, folly, and irresponsibility has not been exorcized from the
financial scene.</p>
<p>The intelligent investor will pay attention to the advice and
recommendations received from investment banking houses, especially
those known by him to have an excellent reputation; but he will be sure
to bring sound and independent judgment to bear upon these
suggestions—either his own, if he is competent, or that of some other
type of adviser.*</p>
<p>Other Advisers</p>
<p>It is a good old custom, especially in the smaller towns, to consult
one’s local banker about investments. A commercial banker may not be a
thoroughgoing expert on security values, but he is experienced and
conservative. He is especially useful to the unskilled investor, who is
often tempted to stray from the straight and unexciting path of a
defensive policy and needs the steadying influence of a prudent mind.
The more alert and aggressive investor, seeking counsel in the selection
of security bargains, will not ordinarily find the commercial banker’s
viewpoint to be especially suited to his own objectives.†</p>
<p>We take a more critical attitude toward the widespread custom of
asking investment advice from relatives or friends. The inquirer always
thinks he has good reason for assuming that the person consulted has
superior knowledge or experience. Our own observation indicates that it
is almost as difficult to select satisfactory lay advisers as it is to
select the proper securities unaided. Much bad advice is given free.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Investors who are prepared to pay a fee for the management of their
funds may wisely select some well-established and well-recommended
investment-counsel firm. Alternatively, they may use the investment
department of a large trust company or the supervisory service supplied
on a fee basis by a few of the leading New York Stock Exchange houses.
The results to be expected are in no wise exceptional, but they are
commensurate with those of the average well-informed and cautious
investor.</p>
<p>Most security buyers obtain advice without paying for it
specifically. It stands to reason, therefore, that in the majority of
cases they are not entitled to and should not expect better than average
results. They should be wary of all persons, whether customers’ brokers
or security salesmen, who promise spectacular income or profits. This
applies both to the selection of securities and to guidance in the
elusive (and perhaps illusive) art of trading in the market.</p>
<p>Defensive investors, as we have defined them, will not ordinarily be
equipped to pass independent judgment on the security recommendations
made by their advisers. But they can be explicit—and even repetitiously
so—in stating the kind of securities they want to buy. If they follow
our prescription they will confine themselves to high-grade bonds and
the common stocks of leading corporations, preferably those that can be
purchased at individual price levels that are not high in the light of
experience and analysis. The security analyst of any reputable
stock-exchange house can make up a suitable list of such common stocks
and can certify to the investor whether or not the existing price level
therefor is a reasonably conservative one as judged by past
experience.</p>
<p>The aggressive investor will ordinarily work in active cooperation
with his advisers. He will want their recommendations explained in
detail, and he will insist on passing his own judgment upon them. This
means that the investor will gear his expectations and the character of
his security operations to the development of his own knowledge and
experience in the field. Only in the exceptional case, where the
integrity and competence of the advisers have been thoroughly
demonstrated, should the investor act upon the advice of others without
understanding and approving the decision made.</p>
<p>There have always been unprincipled stock salesmen and fly by-night
stock brokers, and—as a matter of course—we have advised our readers to
confine their dealings, if possible, to members of the New York Stock
Exchange. But we are reluctantly compelled to add the extra-cautious
counsel that security deliveries and payments be made through the
intermediary of the investor’s bank. The distressing Wall Street
brokerage-house picture may have cleared up completely in a few years,
but in late 1971 we still suggest, “Better safe than sorry.”</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 10</p>
<p>I feel grateful to the Milesian wench who, seeing the philosopher
Thales continually spending his time in contemplation of the heavenly
vault and always keeping his eyes raised upward, put something in his
way to make him stumble, to warn him that it would be time to amuse his
thoughts with things in the clouds when he had seen to those at his
feet. Indeed she gave him or her good counsel, to look rather to himself
than to the sky.</p>
<p>—Michel de Montaigne</p>
<p>Do You Need Help?</p>
<p>In the glory days of the late 1990s, many investors chose to go it
alone. By doing their own research, picking stocks themselves, and
placing their trades through an online broker, these investors bypassed
Wall Street’s costly infrastructure of research, advice, and trading.
Unfortunately, many do-it-yourselfers asserted their independence right
before the worst bear market since the Great Depression—making them
feel, in the end, that they were fools for going it alone. That’s not
necessarily true, of course; people who delegated every decision to a
traditional stockbroker lost money, too.</p>
<p>But many investors do take comfort from the experience, judgment, and
second opinion that a good financial adviser can provide. Some investors
may need an outsider to show them what rate of return they need to earn
on their investments, or how much extra money they need to save, in
order to meet their financial goals. Others may simply benefit from
having someone else to blame when their investments go down; that way,
instead of beating yourself up in an agony of self-doubt, you get to
criticize someone who typically can defend him or herself and encourage
you at the same time. That may provide just the psychological boost you
need to keep investing steadily at a time when other investors’ hearts
may fail them. All in all, just as there’s no reason you can’t manage
your own portfolio, so there’s no shame in seeking professional help in
managing it.1</p>
<p>How can you tell if you need a hand? Here are some signals:</p>
<p>Big losses. If your portfolio lost more than 40% of its value from
the beginning of 2000 through the end of 2002, then you did even worse
than the dismal performance of the stock market itself. It hardly
matters whether you blew it by being lazy, reckless, or just unlucky;
after such a giant loss, your portfolio is crying out for help.</p>
<p>Busted budgets. If you perennially struggle to make ends meet, have
no idea where your money goes, find it impossible to save on a regular
schedule, and chronically fail to pay your bills on time, then your
finances are out of control. An adviser can help you get a grip on your
money by designing a comprehensive financial plan that will outline
how—and how much—you should spend, borrow, save, and invest.</p>
<p>Chaotic portfolios. All too many investors thought they were
diversified in the late 1990s because they owned 39 “different” Internet
stocks, or seven “different” U.S. growth-stock funds. But that’s like
thinking that an all-soprano chorus can handle singing “Old Man River”
better than a soprano soloist can. No matter how many sopranos you add,
that chorus will never be able to nail all those low notes until some
baritones join the group. Likewise, if all your holdings go up and down
together, you lack the investing harmony that true diversification
brings. A professional “asset-allocation” plan can help.</p>
<p>Major changes. If you’ve become self-employed and need to set up a
retirement plan, your aging parents don’t have their finances in order,
or college for your kids looks unaffordable, an adviser can not only
provide peace of mind but help you make genuine improvements in the
quality of your life. What’s more, a qualified professional can ensure
that you benefit from and comply with the staggering complexity of the
tax laws and retirement rules.</p>
<p>Trust, then Verify</p>
<p>Remember that financial con artists thrive by talking you into
trusting them and by talking you out of investigating them. Before you
place your financial future in the hands of an adviser, it’s imperative
that you find someone who not only makes you comfortable but whose
honesty is beyond reproach. As Ronald Reagan used to say, “Trust, then
verify.” Start off by thinking of the handful of people you know best
and trust the most. Then ask if they can refer you to an adviser whom
they trust and who, they feel, delivers good value for his fees. A vote
of confidence from someone you admire is a good start.2</p>
<p>Once you have the name of the adviser and his firm, as well as his
specialty—is he a stockbroker? financial planner? accountant? insurance
agent?—you can begin your due diligence. Enter the name of the adviser
and his or her firm into an Internet search engine like Google to see if
anything comes up (watch for terms like “fine,” “complaint,” “lawsuit,”
“disciplinary action,” or “suspension”). If the adviser is a stockbroker
or insurance agent, contact the office of your state’s securities
commissioner (a convenient directory of online links is at
www.nasaa.org) to ask whether any disciplinary actions or customer
complaints have been filed against the adviser.3 If you’re considering
an accountant who also functions as a financial adviser, your state’s
accounting regulators (whom you can find through the National
Association of State Boards of Accountancy at www.nasba.org) will tell
you whether his or her record is clean.</p>
<p>Financial planners (or their firms) must register with either the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or securities regulators in the
state where their practice is based. As part of that registration, the
adviser must file a two-part document called Form ADV. You should be
able to view and download it at www.advisorinfo.sec.gov, www.iard. com,
or the website of your state securities regulator. Pay special attention
to the Disclosure Reporting Pages, where the adviser must disclose any
disciplinary actions by regulators. (Because unscrupulous advisers have
been known to remove those pages before handing an ADV to a prospective
client, you should independently obtain your own complete copy.) It’s a
good idea to cross-check a financial planner’s record at
www.cfp-board.org, since some planners who have been disciplined outside
their home state can fall through the regulatory cracks. For more tips
on due diligence, see the sidebar below.</p>
<p>WORDS OF WARNING</p>
<p>The need for due diligence doesn’t stop once you hire an adviser.
Melanie Senter Lubin, securities commissioner for the State of Maryland,
suggests being on guard for words and phrases that can spell trouble. If
your adviser keeps saying them—or twisting your arm to do anything that
makes you uncomfortable—“then get in touch with the authorities very
quickly,” warns Lubin. Here’s the kind of lingo that should set off
warning bells:</p>
<p>“offshore”</p>
<p>“the opportunity of a lifetime”</p>
<p>“prime bank”</p>
<p>“This baby’s gonna move.”</p>
<p>“guaranteed”</p>
<p>“You need to hurry.”</p>
<p>“It’s a sure thing.”</p>
<p>“our proprietary computer model”</p>
<p>“The smart money is buying it.”</p>
<p>“options strategy”</p>
<p>“It’s a no-brainer.”</p>
<p>“You can’t afford not to own it.”</p>
<p>“We can beat the market.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be sorry if you don’t…”</p>
<p>“exclusive”</p>
<p>“You should focus on performance, not fees.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to be rich?”</p>
<p>“can’t lose”</p>
<p>“The upside is huge.”</p>
<p>“There’s no downside.”</p>
<p>“I’m putting my mother in it.”</p>
<p>“Trust me.”</p>
<p>“commodities trading”</p>
<p>“monthly returns”</p>
<p>“active asset-allocation strategy”</p>
<p>“We can cap your downside.”</p>
<p>“No one else knows how to do this.”</p>
<p>Getting to Know You</p>
<p>A leading financial-planning newsletter recently canvassed dozens of
advisers to get their thoughts on how you should go about interviewing
them.4 In screening an adviser, your goals should be to:</p>
<p>determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just goes
through the motions</p>
<p>establish whether he or she understands the fundamental principles of
investing as they are outlined in this book</p>
<p>assess whether he or she is sufficiently educated, trained, and
experienced to help you.</p>
<p>Here are some of the questions that prominent financial planners
recommended any prospective client should ask:</p>
<p>Why are you in this business? What is the mission statement of your
firm? Besides your alarm clock, what makes you get up in the
morning?</p>
<p>What is your investing philosophy? Do you use stocks or mutual funds?
Do you use technical analysis? Do you use market timing? (A “yes” to
either of the last two questions is a “no” signal to you.)</p>
<p>Do you focus solely on asset management, or do you also advise on
taxes, estate and retirement planning, budgeting and debt management,
and insurance? How do your education, experience, and credentials
qualify you to give those kinds of financial advice?5</p>
<p>What needs do your clients typically have in common? How can you help
me achieve my goals? How will you track and report my progress? Do you
provide a checklist that I can use to monitor the implementation of any
financial plan we develop?</p>
<p>How do you choose investments? What investing approach do you believe
is most successful, and what evidence can you show me that you have
achieved that kind of success for your clients? What do you do when an
investment performs poorly for an entire year? (Any adviser who answers
“sell” is not worth hiring.)</p>
<p>Do you, when recommending investments, accept any form of
compensation from any third party? Why or why not? Under which
circumstances? How much, in actual dollars, do you estimate I would pay
for your services the first year? What would make that number go up or
down over time? (If fees will consume more than 1% of your assets
annually, you should probably shop for another adviser.6 )</p>
<p>How many clients do you have, and how often do you communicate with
them? What has been your proudest achievement for a client? What
characteristics do your favorite clients share? What’s the worst
experience you’ve had with a client, and how did you resolve it? What
determines whether a client speaks to you or to your support staff? How
long do clients typically stay with you?</p>
<p>Can I see a sample account statement? (If you can’t understand it,
ask the adviser to explain it. If you can’t understand his explanation,
he’s not right for you.)</p>
<p>Do you consider yourself financially successful? Why? How do you
define financial success?</p>
<p>How high an average annual return do you think is feasible on my
investments? (Anything over 8% to 10% is unrealistic.)</p>
<p>Will you provide me with your résumé, your Form ADV, and at least
three references? (If the adviser or his firm is required to file an
ADV, and he will not provide you a copy, get up and leave—and keep one
hand on your wallet as you go.)</p>
<p>Have you ever had a formal complaint filed against you? Why did the
last client who fired you do so?</p>
<p>Defeating Your Own Worst Enemy</p>
<p>Finally, bear in mind that great financial advisers do not grow on
trees. Often, the best already have as many clients as they can
handle—and may be willing to take you on only if you seem like a good
match. So they will ask you some tough questions as well, which might
include:</p>
<p>Why do you feel you need a financial adviser?</p>
<p>What are your long-term goals?</p>
<p>What has been your greatest frustration in dealing with other
advisers (including yourself)?</p>
<p>Do you have a budget? Do you live within your means? What percentage
of your assets do you spend each year?</p>
<p>When we look back a year from now, what will I need to have
accomplished in order for you to be happy with your progress?</p>
<p>How do you handle conflicts or disagreements?</p>
<p>How did you respond emotionally to the bear market that began in
2000?</p>
<p>What are your worst financial fears? Your greatest financial
hopes?</p>
<p>What rate of return on your investments do you consider reasonable?
(Base your answer on Chapter 3.)</p>
<p>An adviser who doesn’t ask questions like these—and who does not show
enough interest in you to sense intuitively what other questions you
consider to be the right ones—is not a good fit.</p>
<p>Above all else, you should trust your adviser enough to permit him or
her to protect you from your worst enemy—yourself. “You hire an
adviser,” explains commentator Nick Murray, “not to manage money but to
manage you.”</p>
<p>“If the adviser is a line of defense between you and your worst
impulsive tendencies,” says financial-planning analyst Robert Veres,
“then he or she should have systems in place that will help the two of
you control them.” Among those systems:</p>
<p>a comprehensive financial plan that outlines how you will earn, save,
spend, borrow, and invest your money;</p>
<p>an investment policy statement that spells out your fundamental
approach to investing;</p>
<p>an asset-allocation plan that details how much money you will keep in
different investment categories.</p>
<p>These are the building blocks on which good financial decisions must
be founded, and they should be created mutually—by you and the
adviser—rather than imposed unilaterally. You should not invest a dollar
or make a decision until you are satisfied that these foundations are in
place and in accordance with your wishes.</p>
