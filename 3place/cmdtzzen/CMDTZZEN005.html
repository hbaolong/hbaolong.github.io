<h4 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h4>
<p>General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor</p>
<p>The basic characteristics of an investment portfolio are usually
determined by the position and characteristics of the owner or owners.
At one extreme we have had savings banks, life-insurance companies, and
so-called legal trust funds. A generation ago their investments were
limited by law in many states to high-grade bonds and, in some cases,
high-grade preferred stocks. At the other extreme we have the well-to-do
and experienced businessman, who will include any kind of bond or stock
in his security list provided he considers it an attractive
purchase.</p>
<p>It has been an old and sound principle that those who cannot afford
to take risks should be content with a relatively low return on their
invested funds. From this there has developed the general notion that
the rate of return which the investor should aim for is more or less
proportionate to the degree of risk he is ready to run. Our view is
different. The rate of return sought should be dependent, rather, on the
amount of intelligent effort the investor is willing and able to bring
to bear on his task. The minimum return goes to our passive investor,
who wants both safety and freedom from concern. The maximum return would
be realized by the alert and enterprising investor who exercises maximum
intelligence and skill. In 1965 we added: “In many cases there may be
less real risk associated with buying a ‘bargain issue’ offering the
chance of a large profit than with a conventional bond purchase yielding
about 4½%.” This statement had more truth in it than we ourselves
suspected, since in subsequent years even the best long-term bonds lost
a substantial part of their market value because of the rise in interest
rates.</p>
<p>The Basic Problem of Bond-Stock Allocation</p>
<p>We have already outlined in briefest form the portfolio policy of the
defensive investor.* He should divide his funds between high-grade bonds
and high-grade common stocks.</p>
<p>We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the investor
should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common
stocks, with a consequent inverse range of between 75% and 25% in bonds.
There is an implication here that the standard division should be an
equal one, or 50–50, between the two major investment mediums. According
to tradition the sound reason for increasing the percentage in common
stocks would be the appearance of the “bargain price” levels created in
a protracted bear market. Conversely, sound procedure would call for
reducing the common-stock component below 50% when in the judgment of
the investor the market level has become dangerously high.</p>
<p>These copybook maxims have always been easy to enunciate and always
difficult to follow—because they go against that very human nature which
produces that excesses of bull and bear markets. It is almost a
contradiction in terms to suggest as a feasible policy for the average
stockowner that he lighten his holdings when the market advances beyond
a certain point and add to them after a corresponding decline. It is
because the average man operates, and apparently must operate, in
opposite fashion that we have had the great advances and collapses of
the past; and—this writer believes—we are likely to have them in the
future.</p>
<p>If the division between investment and speculative operations were as
clear now as once it was, we might be able to envisage investors as a
shrewd, experienced group who sell out to the heedless, hapless
speculators at high prices and buy back from them at depressed levels.
This picture may have had some verisimilitude in bygone days, but it is
hard to identify it with financial developments since 1949. There is no
indication that such professional operations as those of the mutual
funds have been conducted in this fashion. The percentage of the
portfolio held in equities by the two major types of funds—“balanced”
and “common-stock”—has changed very little from year to year. Their
selling activities have been largely related to endeavors to switch from
less to more promising holdings.</p>
<p>If, as we have long believed, the stock market has lost contact with
its old bounds, and if new ones have not yet been established, then we
can give the investor no reliable rules by which to reduce his
common-stock holdings toward the 25% minimum and rebuild them later to
the 75% maximum. We can urge that in general the investor should not
have more than one-half in equities unless he has strong confidence in
the soundness of his stock position and is sure that he could view a
market decline of the 1969–70 type with equanimity. It is hard for us to
see how such strong confidence can be justified at the levels existing
in early 1972. Thus we would counsel against a greater than 50%
apportionment to common stocks at this time. But, for complementary
reasons, it is almost equally difficult to advise a reduction of the
figure well below 50%, unless the investor is disquieted in his own mind
about the current market level, and will be satisfied also to limit his
participation in any further rise to, say, 25% of his total funds.</p>
<p>We are thus led to put forward for most of our readers what may
appear to be an oversimplified 50–50 formula. Under this plan the
guiding rule is to maintain as nearly as practicable an equal division
between bond and stock holdings. When changes in the market level have
raised the common-stock component to, say, 55%, the balance would be
restored by a sale of one-eleventh of the stock portfolio and the
transfer of the proceeds to bonds. Conversely, a fall in the
common-stock proportion to 45% would call for the use of one-eleventh of
the bond fund to buy additional equities.</p>
<p>Yale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number of
years after 1937, but it was geared around a 35% “normal holding” in
common stocks. In the early 1950s, however, Yale seems to have given up
its once famous formula, and in 1969 held 61% of its portfolio in
equities (including some convertibles). (At that time the endowment
funds of 71 such institutions, totaling .6 billion, held 60.3% in common
stocks.) The Yale example illustrates the almost lethal effect of the
great market advance upon the once popular formula approach to
investment. Nonetheless we are convinced that our 50–50 version of this
approach makes good sense for the defensive investor. It is extremely
simple; it aims unquestionably in the right direction; it gives the
follower the feeling that he is at least making some moves in response
to market developments; most important of all, it will restrain him from
being drawn more and more heavily into common stocks as the market rises
to more and more dangerous heights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the
gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe
decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he
is than many of his more venturesome friends.</p>
<p>While our proposed 50–50 division is undoubtedly the simplest
“all-purpose program” devisable, it may not turn out to be the best in
terms of results achieved. (Of course, no approach, mechanical or
otherwise, can be advanced with any assurance that it will work out
better than another.) The much larger income return now offered by good
bonds than by representative stocks is a potent argument for favoring
the bond component. The investor’s choice between 50% or a lower figure
in stocks may well rest mainly on his own temperament and attitude. If
he can act as a cold-blooded weigher of the odds, he would be likely to
favor the low 25% stock component at this time, with the idea of waiting
until the DJIA dividend yield was, say, two-thirds of the bond yield
before he would establish his median 50–50 division between bonds and
stocks. Starting from 900 for the DJIA and dividends of 6 on the unit,
this would require either a fall in taxable bond yields from 7½% to
about 5.5% without any change in the present return on leading stocks,
or a fall in the DJIA to as low as 660 if there is no reduction in bond
yields and no increase in dividends. A combination of intermediate
changes could produce the same “buying point.” A program of that kind is
not especially complicated; the hard part is to adopt it and to stick to
it not to mention the possibility that it may turn out to have been much
too conservative.</p>
<p>The Bond Component</p>
<p>The choice of issues in the bond component of the investor’s
portfolio will turn about two main questions: Should he buy taxable or
tax-free bonds, and should he buy shorter- or longer-termmaturities? The
tax decision should be mainly a matter of arithmetic, turning on the
difference in yields as compared with the investor’s tax bracket. In
January 1972 the choice in 20-year maturities was between obtaining,
say, 7½% on “grade Aa” corporate bonds and 5.3% on prime tax-free
issues. (The term “municipals” is generally applied to all species of
tax-exempt bonds, including state obligations.) There was thus for this
maturity a loss in income of some 30% in passing from the corporate to
the municipal field. Hence if the investor was in a maximum tax bracket
higher than 30% he would have a net saving after taxes by choosing the
municipal bonds; the opposite, if his maximum tax was less than 30%. A
single person starts paying a 30% rate when his income after deductions
passes 0,000; for a married couple the rate applies when combined
taxable income passes 0,000. It is evident that a large proportion of
individual investors would obtain a higher return after taxes from good
municipals than from good corporate bonds.</p>
<p>The choice of longer versus shorter maturities involves quite a
different question, viz.: Does the investor want to assure himself
against a decline in the price of his bonds, but at the cost of (1) a
lower annual yield and (2) loss of the possibility of an appreciable
gain in principal value? We think it best to discuss this question in
Chapter 8, The Investor and Market Fluctuations.</p>
<p>For a period of many years in the past the only sensible bond
purchases for individuals were the U.S. savings issues. Their safety
was—and is—unquestioned; they gave a higher return than other bond
investments of first quality; they had a money-back option and other
privileges which added greatly to their attractiveness. In our earlier
editions we had an entire chapter entitled “U.S. Savings Bonds: A Boon
to Investors.”</p>
<p>As we shall point out, U.S. savings bonds still possess certain
unique merits that make them a suitable purchase by any individual
investor. For the man of modest capital—with, say, not more than 0,000
to put into bonds—we think they are still the easiest and the best
choice. But those with larger funds may find other mediums more
desirable.</p>
<p>Let us list a few major types of bonds that deserve investor
consideration, and discuss them briefly with respect to general
description, safety, yield, market price, risk, income-tax status, and
other features.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>U.S. SAVINGS BONDS, SERIES E AND SERIES H. We shall first summarize
their important provisions, and then discuss briefly the numerous
advantages of these unique, attractive, and exceedingly convenient
investments. The Series H bonds pay interest semi-annually, as do other
bonds. The rate is 4.29% for the first year, and then a flat 5.10% for
the next nine years to maturity. Interest on the Series E bonds is not
paid out, but accrues to the holder through increase in redemption
value. The bonds are sold at 75% of their face value, and mature at 100%
in 5 years 10 months after purchase. If held to maturity the yield works
out at 5%, compounded semi-annually. If redeemed earlier, the yield
moves up from a minimum of 4.01% in the first year to an average of
5.20% in the next 45/6 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Interest on the bonds is subject to Federal income tax, but is exempt
from state income tax. However, Federal income tax on the Series E bonds
may be paid at the holder’s option either annually as the interest
accrues (through higher redemption value), or not until the bond is
actually disposed of.</p>
<p>Owners of Series E bonds may cash them in at any time (shortly after
purchase) at their current redemption value. Holders of Series H bonds
have similar rights to cash them in at par value (cost). Series E bonds
are exchangeable for Series H bonds, with certain tax advantages. Bonds
lost, destroyed, or stolen may be replaced without cost. There are
limitations on annual purchases, but liberal provisions for co-ownership
by family members make it possible for most investors to buy as many as
they can afford. Comment: There is no other investment that combines (1)
absolute assurance of principal and interest payments, (2) the right to
demand full “money back” at any time, and (3) guarantee of at least a 5%
interest rate for at least ten years. Holders of the earlier issues of
Series E bonds have had the right to extend their bonds at maturity, and
thus to continue to accumulate annual values at successively higher
rates. The deferral of income-tax payments over these long periods has
been of great dollar advantage; we calculate it has increased the
effective net-after-tax rate received by as much as a third in typical
cases. Conversely, the right to cash in the bonds at cost price or
better has given the purchasers in former years of low interest rates
complete protection against the shrinkage in principal value that befell
many bond investors; otherwise stated, it gave them the possibility of
benefiting from the rise in interest rates by switching their
low-interest holdings into very-high-coupon issues on an even-money
basis.</p>
<p>In our view the special advantages enjoyed by owners of savings bonds
now will more than compensate for their lower current return as compared
with other direct government obligations.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>OTHER UNITED STATES BONDS. Aprofusion of these issues exists,
covering a wide variety of coupon rates and maturity dates. All of them
are completely safe with respect to payment of interest and principal.
They are subject to Federal income taxes but free from state income tax.
In late 1971 the long-term issues—over ten years—showed an average yield
of 6.09%, intermediate issues (three to five years) returned 6.35%, and
short issues returned 6.03%.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1970 it was possible to buy a number of old issues at large
discounts. Some of these are accepted at par in settlement of estate
taxes. Example: The U.S. Treasury 3½s due 1990 are in this category;
they sold at 60 in 1970, but closed 1970 above 77.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note also that in many cases the indirect
obligations of the U.S. government yield appreciably more than its
direct obligations of the same maturity. As we write, an offering
appears of 7.05% of “Certificates Fully Guaranteed by the Secretary of
Transportation of the Department of Transportation of the United
States.” The yield was fully 1% more than that on direct obligations of
the U.S., maturing the same year (1986). The certificates were actually
issued in the name of the Trustees of the Penn Central Transportation
Co., but they were sold on the basis of a statement by the U.S. Attorney
General that the guarantee “brings into being a general obligation of
the United States, backed by its full faith and credit.” Quite a number
of indirect obligations of this sort have been assumed by the U.S.
government in the past, and all of them have been scrupulously
honored.</p>
<p>The reader may wonder why all this hocus-pocus, involving an
apparently “personal guarantee” by our Secretary of Transportation, and
a higher cost to the taxpayer in the end. The chief reason for the
indirection has been the debt limit imposed on government borrowing by
the Congress. Apparently guarantees by the government are not regarded
as debts—a semantic windfall for shrewder investors. Perhaps the chief
impact of this situation has been the creation of tax-free Housing
Authority bonds, enjoying the equivalent of a U.S. guarantee, and
virtually the only tax-exempt issues that are equivalent to government
bonds. Another type of government-backed issues is the recently created
New Community Debentures, offered to yield 7.60% in September 1971.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>STATE AND MUNICIPAL BONDS. These enjoy exemption from Federal
income tax. They are also ordinarily free of income tax in the state of
issue but not elsewhere. They are either direct obligations of a state
or subdivision, or “revenue bonds” dependent for interest payments on
receipts from a toll road, bridge, building lease, etc. Not all tax-free
bonds are strongly enough protected to justify their purchase by a
defensive investor. He may be guided in his selection by the rating
given to each issue by Moody’s or Standard andandandand Poor’s. One of
three highest ratings by both services—Aaa (AAA), Aa (AA), or A—should
constitute a sufficient indication of adequate safety. The yield on
these bonds will vary both with the quality and the maturity, with the
shorter maturities giving the lower return. In late 1971 the issues
represented in Standard andandandand Poor’s municipal bond index
averaged AA in quality rating, 20 years in maturity, and 5.78% in yield.
A typical offering of Vineland, N.J., bonds, rated AA for A and gave a
yield of only 3% on the one-year maturity, rising to 5.8% to the 1995
and 1996 maturities.1</p></li>
<li><p>CORPORATION BONDS. These bonds are subject to both Federal and
state tax. In early 1972 those of highest quality yielded 7.19% for a
25-year maturity, as reflected in the published yield of Moody’s Aaa
corporate bond index. The so-called lower-medium-grade issues—rated
Baa—returned 8.23% for long maturities. In each class shorter-term
issues would yield somewhat less than longer-term obligations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Comment. The above summaries indicate that the average investor has
several choices among high-grade bonds. Those in high income-tax
brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield from good tax-free
issues than from taxable ones. For others the early 1972 range of
taxable yield would seem to be from 5.00% on U.S. savings bonds, with
their special options, to about 7½% on high-grade corporate issues.</p>
<p>Higher-Yielding Bond Investments</p>
<p>By sacrificing quality an investor can obtain a higher income return
from his bonds. Long experience has demonstrated that the ordinary
investor is wiser to keep away from such high-yield bonds. While, taken
as a whole, they may work out somewhat better in terms of overall return
than the first-quality issues, they expose the owner to too many
individual risks of untoward developments, ranging from disquieting
price declines to actual default. (It is true that bargain opportunities
occur fairly often in lower-grade bonds, but these require special study
and skill to exploit successfully.)*</p>
<p>Perhaps we should add here that the limits imposed by Congress on
direct bond issues of the United States have produced at least two sorts
of “bargain opportunities” for investors in the purchase of
government-backed obligations. One is provided by the tax-exempt “New
Housing” issues, and the other by the recently created (taxable) “New
Community debentures.” An offering of New Housing issues in July 1971
yielded as high as 5.8%, free from both Federal and state taxes, while
an issue of (taxable) New Community debentures sold in September 1971
yielded 7.60%. Both obligations have the “full faith and credit” of the
United States government behind them and hence are safe without
question. And—on a net basis—they yield considerably more than ordinary
United States bonds.†</p>
<p>Savings Deposits in Lieu of Bonds</p>
<p>An investor may now obtain as high an interest rate from a savings
deposit in a commercial or savings bank (or from a bank certificate of
deposit) as he can from a first-grade bond of short maturity. The
interest rate on bank savings accounts may be lowered in the future, but
under present conditions they are a suitable substitute for short-term
bond investment by the individual.</p>
<p>Convertible Issues</p>
<p>These are discussed in Chapter 16. The price variability of bonds in
general is treated in Chapter 8, The Investor and Market
Fluctuations.</p>
<p>Call Provisions</p>
<p>In previous editions we had a fairly long discussion of this aspect
of bond financing, because it involved a serious but little noticed
injustice to the investor. In the typical case bonds were callable
fairly soon after issuance, and at modest premiums—say 5%—above the
issue price. This meant that during a period of wide fluctuations in the
underlying interest rates the investor had to bear the full brunt of
unfavorable changes and was deprived of all but a meager participation
in favorable ones.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: Our standard example has been the issue of American Gas
andandandand Electric 100-year 5% debentures, sold to the public at 101
in 1928. Four years later, under near-panic conditions, the price of
these good bonds fell to 62½, yielding 8%. By 1946, in a great reversal,
bonds of this type could be sold to yield only 3%, and the 5% issue
should have been quoted at close to 160. But at that point the company
took advantage of the call provision and redeemed the issue at a mere
106.</p>
<p>The call feature in these bond contracts was a thinly disguised
instance of “heads I win, tails you lose.” At long last, the bond-buying
institutions refused to accept this unfair arrangement; in recent years
most long-term high-coupon issues have been protected against redemption
for ten years or more after issuance. This still limits their possible
price rise, but not inequitably.</p>
<p>In practical terms, we advise the investor in long-term issues to
sacrifice a small amount of yield to obtain the assurance of
noncallability—say for 20 or 25 years. Similarly, there is an advantage
in buying a low-coupon bond* at a discount rather than a high-coupon
bond selling at about par and callable in a few years. For the
discount—e.g., of a 3½% bond at 63½%, yielding 7.85%—carries full
protection against adverse call action.</p>
<p>Straight—i.e., Nonconvertible—Preferred Stocks</p>
<p>Certain general observations should be made here on the subject of
preferred stocks. Really good preferred stocks can and do exist, but
they are good in spite of their investment form, which is an inherently
bad one. The typical preferred shareholder is dependent for his safety
on the ability and desire of the company to pay dividends on its common
stock. Once the common dividends are omitted, or even in danger, his own
position becomes precarious, for the directors are under no obligation
to continue paying him unless they also pay on the common. On the other
hand, the typical preferred stock carries no share in the company’s
profits beyond the fixed dividend rate. Thus the preferred holder lacks
both the legal claim of the bondholder (or creditor) and the profit
possibilities of a common shareholder (or partner).</p>
<p>These weaknesses in the legal position of preferred stocks tend to
come to the fore recurrently in periods of depression. Only a small
percentage of all preferred issues are so strongly entrenched as to
maintain an unquestioned investment status through all vicissitudes.
Experience teaches that the time to buy preferred stocks is when their
price is unduly depressed by temporary adversity. (At such times they
may be well suited to the aggressive investor but too unconventional for
the defensive investor.)</p>
<p>In other words, they should be bought on a bargain basis or not at
all. We shall refer later to convertible and similarly privileged
issues, which carry some special possibilities of profits. These are not
ordinarily selected for a conservative portfolio.</p>
<p>Another peculiarity in the general position of preferred stocks
deserves mention. They have a much better tax status for corporation
buyers than for individual investors. Corporations pay income tax on
only 15% of the income they receive in dividends, but on the full amount
of their ordinary interest income. Since the 1972 corporate rate is 48%,
this means that 00 received as preferred-stock dividends is taxed only
.20, whereas 00 received as bond interest is taxed 8. On the other hand,
individual investors pay exactly the same tax on preferred-stock
investments as on bond interest, except for a recent minor exemption.
Thus, in strict logic, all investment-grade preferred stocks should be
bought by corporations, just as all tax-exempt bonds should be bought by
investors who pay income tax.*</p>
<p>Security Forms</p>
<p>The bond form and the preferred-stock form, as hitherto discussed,
are well-understood and relatively simple matters. A bondholder is
entitled to receive fixed interest and payment of principal on a
definite date. The owner of a preferred stock is entitled to a fixed
dividend, and no more, which must be paid before any common dividend.
His principal value does not come due on any specified date. (The
dividend may be cumulative or noncumulative. He may or may not have a
vote.)</p>
<p>The above describes the standard provisions and, no doubt, the
majority of bond and preferred issues, but there are innumerable
departures from these forms. The best-known types are convertible and
similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest does not
have to be paid unless it is earned by the company. (Unpaid interest may
accumulate as a charge against future earnings, but the period is often
limited to three years.)</p>
<p>Income bonds should be used by corporations much more extensively
than they are. Their avoidance apparently arises from a mere accident of
economic history—namely, that they were first employed in quantity in
connection with railroad reorganizations, and hence they have been
associated from the start with financial weakness and poor investment
status. But the form itself has several practical advantages, especially
in comparison with and in substitution for the numerous (convertible)
preferred-stock issues of recent years. Chief of these is the
deductibility of the interest paid from the company’s taxable income,
which in effect cuts the cost of that form of capital in half. From the
investor’s standpoint it is probably best for him in most cases that he
should have (1) an unconditional right to receive interest payments when
they are earned by the company, and (2) a right to other forms of
protection than bankruptcy proceedings if interest is not earned and
paid. The terms of income bonds can be tailored to the advantage of both
the borrower and the lender in the manner best suited to both.
(Conversion privileges can, of course, be included.) The acceptance by
everybody of the inherently weak preferred-stock form and the rejection
of the stronger income-bond form is a fascinating illustration of the
way in which traditional institutions and habits often tend to persist
on Wall Street despite new conditions calling for a fresh point of view.
With every new wave of optimism or pessimism, we are ready to abandon
history and time-tested principles, but we cling tenaciously and
unquestioningly to our prejudices.</p>
<p>Commentary on Chapter 4</p>
<p>When you leave it to chance, then all of a sudden you don’t have any
more luck.</p>
<p>—Basketball coach Pat Riley</p>
<p>How aggressive should your portfolio be?</p>
<p>That, says Graham, depends less on what kinds of investments you own
than on what kind of investor you are. There are two ways to be an
intelligent investor:</p>
<p>by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix
of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds;</p>
<p>or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and
requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement).</p>
<p>Graham calls the first approach “active” or “enterprising”; it takes
lots of time and loads of energy. The “passive” or “defensive” strategy
takes little time or effort but requires an almost ascetic detachment
from the alluring hullabaloo of the market. As the investment thinker
Charles Ellis has explained, the enterprising approach is physically and
intellectually taxing, while the defensive approach is emotionally
demanding.1</p>
<p>If you have time to spare, are highly competitive, think like a
sports fan, and relish a complicated intellectual challenge, then the
active approach is up your alley. If you always feel rushed, crave
simplicity, and don’t relish thinking about money, then the passive
approach is for you. (Some people will feel most comfortable combining
both methods—creating a portfolio that is mainly active and partly
passive, or vice versa.)</p>
<p>Both approaches are equally intelligent, and you can be successful
with either—but only if you know yourself well enough to pick the right
one, stick with it over the course of your investing lifetime, and keep
your costs and emotions under control. Graham’s distinction between
active and passive investors is another of his reminders that financial
risk lies not only where most of us look for it—in the economy or in our
investments—but also within ourselves.</p>
<p>Can You be Brave, or will You Cave?</p>
<p>How, then, should a defensive investor get started? The first and
most basic decision is how much to put in stocks and how much to put in
bonds and cash. (Note that Graham deliberately places this discussion
after his chapter on inflation, forearming you with the knowledge that
inflation is one of your worst enemies.)</p>
<p>The most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allocate
your assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions the word
“age.” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of conventional
wisdom—which holds that how much investing risk you ought to take
depends mainly on how old you are.2 A traditional rule of thumb was to
subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in
stocks, with the rest in bonds or cash. (A 28-year-old would put 72% of
her money in stocks; an 81-year-old would put only 19% there.) Like
everything else, these assumptions got overheated in the late 1990s. By
1999, a popular book argued that if you were younger than 30 you should
put 95% of your money in stocks—even if you had only a “moderate”
tolerance for risk!3</p>
<p>Unless you’ve allowed the proponents of this advice to subtract 100
from your IQ, you should be able to tell that something is wrong here.
Why should your age determine how much risk you can take? An 89-year-old
with million, an ample pension, and a gaggle of grandchildren would be
foolish to move most of her money into bonds. She already has plenty of
income, and her grandchildren (who will eventually inherit her stocks)
have decades of investing ahead of them. On the other hand, a
25-year-old who is saving for his wedding and a house down payment would
be out of his mind to put all his money in stocks. If the stock market
takes an Acapulco high dive, he will have no bond income to cover his
downside—or his backside.</p>
<p>What’s more, no matter how young you are, you might suddenly need to
yank your money out of stocks not 40 years from now, but 40 minutes from
now. Without a whiff of warning, you could lose your job, get divorced,
become disabled, or suffer who knows what other kind of surprise. The
unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets
in the riskless haven of cash.</p>
<p>Finally, many people stop investing precisely because the stock
market goes down. Psychologists have shown that most of us do a very
poor job of predicting today how we will feel about an emotionally
charged event in the future.4 When stocks are going up 15% or 20% a
year, as they did in the 1980s and 1990s, it’s easy to imagine that you
and your stocks are married for life. But when you watch every dollar
you invested getting bashed down to a dime, it’s hard to resist bailing
out into the “safety” of bonds and cash. Instead of buying and holding
their stocks, many people end up buying high, selling low, and holding
nothing but their own head in their hands. Because so few investors have
the guts to cling to stocks in a falling market, Graham insists that
everyone should keep a minimum of 25% in bonds. That cushion, he argues,
will give you the courage to keep the rest of your money in stocks even
when stocks stink.</p>
<p>To get a better feel for how much risk you can take, think about the
fundamental circumstances of your life, when they will kick in, when
they might change, and how they are likely to affect your need for
cash:</p>
<p>Are you single or married? What does your spouse or partner do for a
living?</p>
<p>Do you or will you have children? When will the tuition bills hit
home?</p>
<p>Will you inherit money, or will you end up financially responsible
for aging, ailing parents?</p>
<p>What factors might hurt your career? (If you work for a bank or a
homebuilder, a jump in interest rates could put you out of a job. If you
work for a chemical manufacturer, soaring oil prices could be bad
news.)</p>
<p>If you are self-employed, how long do businesses similar to yours
tend to survive?</p>
<p>Do you need your investments to supplement your cash income? (In
general, bonds will; stocks won’t.)</p>
<p>Given your salary and your spending needs, how much money can you
afford to lose on your investments?</p>
<p>If, after considering these factors, you feel you can take the higher
risks inherent in greater ownership of stocks, you belong around
Graham’s minimum of 25% in bonds or cash. If not, then steer mostly
clear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s maximum of 75% in bonds or cash.
(To find out whether you can go up to 100%, see the sidebar on
p. 105.)</p>
<p>Once you set these target percentages, change them only as your life
circumstances change. Do not buy more stocks because the stock market
has gone up; do not sell them because it has gone down. The very heart
of Graham’s approach is to replace guesswork with discipline.
Fortunately, through your 401(k), it’s easy to put your portfolio on
permanent autopilot. Let’s say you are comfortable with a fairly high
level of risk—say, 70% of your assets in stocks and 30% in bonds. If the
stock market rises 25% (but bonds stay steady), you will now have just
under 75% in stocks and only 25% in bonds.5 Visit your 401(k)’s website
(or call its toll-free number) and sell enough of your stock funds to
“rebalance” back to your 70–30 target. The key is to rebalance on a
predictable, patient schedule—not so often that you will drive yourself
crazy, and not so seldom that your targets will get out of whack. I
suggest that you rebalance every six months, no more and no less, on
easy-to-remember dates like New Year’s and the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>WHY NOT 100% STOCKS?</p>
<p>Graham advises you never to have more than 75% of your total assets
in stocks. But is putting all your money into the stock market
inadvisable for everyone? For a tiny minority of investors, a 100%-stock
portfolio may make sense. You are one of them if you:</p>
<p>have set aside enough cash to support your family for at least one
year</p>
<p>will be investing steadily for at least 20 years to come</p>
<p>survived the bear market that began in 2000</p>
<p>did not sell stocks during the bear market that began in 2000</p>
<p>bought more stocks during the bear market that began in 2000</p>
<p>have read Chapter 8 in this book and implemented a formal plan to
control your own investing behavior.</p>
<p>Unless you can honestly pass all these tests, you have no business
putting all your money in stocks. Anyone who panicked in the last bear
market is going to panic in the next one—and will regret having no
cushion of cash and bonds.</p>
<p>The beauty of this periodic rebalancing is that it forces you to base
your investing decisions on a simple, objective standard—Do I now own
more of this asset than my plan calls for?—instead of the sheer
guesswork of where interest rates are heading or whether you think the
Dow is about to drop dead. Some mutual-fund companies, including T. Rowe
Price, may soon introduce services that will automatically rebalance
your 401(k) portfolio to your preset targets, so you will never need to
make an active decision.</p>
<p>The Ins and Outs of Income Investing</p>
<p>In Graham’s day, bond investors faced two basic choices: Taxable or
tax-free? Short-term or long-term? Today there is a third: Bonds or bond
funds?</p>
<p>Taxable or tax-free? Unless you’re in the lowest tax bracket,6 you
should buy only tax-free (municipal) bonds outside your retirement
accounts. Otherwise too much of your bond income will end up in the
hands of the IRS. The only place to own taxable bonds is inside your
401(k) or another sheltered account, where you will owe no current tax
on their income—and where municipal bonds have no place, since their tax
advantage goes to waste.7</p>
<p>Short-term or long-term? Bonds and interest rates teeter on opposite
ends of a seesaw: If interest rates rise, bond prices fall—although a
short-term bond falls far less than a long-term bond. On the other hand,
if interest rates fall, bond prices rise—and a long-term bond will
outper-forms shorter ones.8 You can split the difference simply by
buying intermediate-term bonds maturing in five to 10 years—which do not
soar when their side of the seesaw rises, but do not slam into the
ground either. For most investors, intermediate bonds are the simplest
choice, since they enable you to get out of the game of guessing what
interest rates will do.</p>
<p>Bonds or bond funds? Since bonds are generally sold in 0,000 lots and
you need a bare minimum of 10 bonds to diversify away the risk that any
one of them might go bust, buying individual bonds makes no sense unless
you have at least 00,000 to invest. (The only exception is bonds issued
by the U.S. Treasury, since they’re protected against default by the
full force of the American government.)</p>
<p>Bond funds offer cheap and easy diversification, along with the
convenience of monthly income, which you can reinvest right back into
the fund at current rates without paying a commission. For most
investors, bond funds beat individual bonds hands down (the main
exceptions are Treasury securities and some municipal bonds). Major
firms like Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price offer a broad
menu of bond funds at low cost.9</p>
<p>The choices for bond investors have proliferated like rabbits, so
let’s update Graham’s list of what’s available. As of 2003, interest
rates have fallen so low that investors are starved for yield, but there
are ways of amplifying your interest income without taking on excessive
risk.10 Figure 4-1 summarizes the pros and cons.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a few types of bond investments that can fill
special needs.</p>
<p>Cash is not Trash</p>
<p>How can you wring more income out of your cash? The intelligent
investor should consider moving out of bank certificates of deposit or
money-market accounts—which have offered meager returns lately—into some
of these cash alternatives:</p>
<p>Treasury securities, as obligations of the U.S. government, carry
virtually no credit risk—since, instead of defaulting on his debts,
Uncle Sam can just jack up taxes or print more money at will. Treasury
bills mature in four, 13, or 26 weeks. Because of their very short
maturities, T-bills barely get dented when rising interest rates knock
down the prices of other income investments; longer-term Treasury debt,
however, suffers severely when interest rates rise. The interest income
on Treasury securities is generally free from state (but not Federal)
income tax. And, with .7 trillion in public hands, the market for
Treasury debt is immense, so you can readily find a buyer if you need
your money back before maturity. You can buy Treasury bills, short-term
notes, and long-term bonds directly from the government, with no
brokerage fees, at www.publicdebt.treas.gov. (For more on
inflation-protected TIPS, see the commentary on Chapter 2.)</p>
<p>FIGURE 4-1 The Wide World of Bonds</p>
<p>Sources: Bankrate.com, Bloomberg, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch,
Morningstar, www.savingsbonds.gov</p>
<p>Notes: (D): purchased directly. (F): purchased through a mutual fund.
“Ease of sale before maturity” indicates how readily you can sell at a
fair price before maturity date; mutual funds typically offer better
ease of sale than individual bonds. Money-market funds are Federally
insured up to 00,000 if purchased at an FDIC-member bank, but otherwise
carry only an implicit pledge not to lose value. Federal income tax on
savings bonds is deferred until redemption or maturity. Municipal bonds
are generally exempt from state income tax only in the state where they
were issued.</p>
<p>Savings bonds, unlike Treasuries, are not marketable; you cannot sell
them to another investor, and you’ll forfeit three months of interest if
you redeem them in less than five years. Thus they are suitable mainly
as “set-aside money” to meet a future spending need—a gift for a
religious ceremony that’s years away, or a jump start on putting your
newborn through Harvard. They come in denominations as low as 5, making
them ideal as gifts to grandchildren. For investors who can confidently
leave some cash untouched for years to come, inflation-protected
“I-bonds” recently offered an attractive yield of around 4%. To learn
more, see www.savingsbonds.gov.</p>
<p>Moving Beyond Uncle Sam</p>
<p>Mortgage securities. Pooled together from thousands of mortgages
around the United States, these bonds are issued by agencies like the
Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) or the Government
National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). However, they are not
backed by the U.S. Treasury, so they sell at higher yields to reflect
their greater risk. Mortgage bonds generally underperform when interest
rates fall and bomb when rates rise. (Over the long run, those swings
tend to even out and the higher average yields pay off.) Good
mortgage-bond funds are available from Vanguard, Fidelity, and Pimco.
But if a broker ever tries to sell you an individual mortgage bond or
“CMO,” tell him you are late for an appointment with your
proctologist.</p>
<p>Annuities. These insurance-like investments enable you to defer
current taxes and capture a stream of income after you retire. Fixed
annuities offer a set rate of return; variable ones provide a
fluctuating return. But what the defensive investor really needs to
defend against here are the hard-selling insurance agents, stockbrokers,
and financial planners who peddle annuities at rapaciously high costs.
In most cases, the high expenses of owning an annuity—including
“surrender charges” that gnaw away at your early withdrawals—will
overwhelm its advantages. The few good annuities are bought, not sold;
if an annuity produces fat commissions for the seller, chances are it
will produce meager results for the buyer. Consider only those you can
buy directly from providers with rock-bottom costs like Ameritas,
TIAA-CREF, and Vanguard.11</p>
<p>Preferred stock. Preferred shares are a worst-of-both-worlds
investment. They are less secure than bonds, since they have only a
secondary claim on a company’s assets if it goes bankrupt. And they
offer less profit potential than common stocks do, since companies
typically “call” (or forcibly buy back) their preferred shares when
interest rates drop or their credit rating improves. Unlike the interest
payments on most of its bonds, an issuing company cannot deduct
preferred dividend payments from its corporate tax bill. Ask yourself:
If this company is healthy enough to deserve my investment, why is it
paying a fat dividend on its preferred stock instead of issuing bonds
and getting a tax break? The likely answer is that the company is not
healthy, the market for its bonds is glutted, and you should approach
its preferred shares as you would approach an unrefrigerated dead
fish.</p>
<p>Common stock. A visit to the stock screener at http://screen.
yahoo.com/stocks.html in early 2003 showed that 115 of the stocks in the
Standard andandandand Poor’s 500 index had dividend yields of 3.0% or
greater. No intelligent investor, no matter how starved for yield, would
ever buy a stock for its dividend income alone; the company and its
businesses must be solid, and its stock price must be reasonable. But,
thanks to the bear market that began in 2000, some leading stocks are
now outyielding Treasury bonds. So even the most defensive investor
should realize that selectively adding stocks to an all-bond or
mostly-bond portfolio can increase its income yield—and raise its
potential return.12</p>
