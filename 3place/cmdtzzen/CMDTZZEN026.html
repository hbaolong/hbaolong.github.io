<p>1 Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.</p>
<p>2 The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,
when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>3 Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)
that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in
his own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new
investors. I am grateful to Walter Schloss for providing data essential
to estimating Graham-Newman’s returns. The 20% annual average return
that Graham cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take
management fees into account.</p>
<p>4 The text reproduced here is the Fourth Revised Edition, updated by
Graham in 1971–1972 and initially published in 1973.</p>
<ul>
<li>The two partners Graham coyly refers to are Jerome Newman and
Benjamin Graham himself.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham is describing the Government Employees Insurance Co., or
GEICO, in which he and Newman purchased a 50% interest in 1948, right
around the time he finished writing The Intelligent Investor. The 12,500
that Graham and Newman put into GEICO was roughly 25% of their fund’s
assets at the time. Graham was a member of GEICO’s board of directors
for many years. In a nice twist of fate, Graham’s greatest student,
Warren Buffett, made an immense bet of his own on GEICO in 1976, by
which time the big insurer had slid to the brink of bankruptcy. It
turned out to be one of Buffett’s best investments as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of a legal technicality, Graham and Newman were directed by
the U.S. Securities andandandand Exchange Commission to “spin off,” or
distribute, Graham-Newman Corp.’s GEICO stake to the fund’s
shareholders. An investor who owned 100 shares of Graham-Newman at the
beginning of 1948 (worth 1,413) and who then held on to the GEICO
distribution would have had .66 million by 1972. GEICO’s
“later-organized affiliates” included Government Employees Financial
Corp. and Criterion Insurance Co.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Graham’s anecdote is also a powerful reminder that those of us who
are not as brilliant as he was must always diversify to protect against
the risk of putting too much money into a single investment. When Graham
himself admits that GEICO was a “lucky break,” that’s a signal that most
of us cannot count on being able to find such a great opportunity. To
keep investing from decaying into gambling, you must diversify.</p>
<p>2 Dante Alighieri, The Inferno, Canto XXVI, lines 112–125, translated
by Jason Zweig.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the
University of Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve
Bulletin, July, 1948. People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to
spend his money. He can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can
invest it. What do you think would be the wisest thing for him to do
with the money nowadays—put it in the bank, buy savings bonds with it,
invest it in real estate, or buy common stock with it?” Only 4% thought
common stock would offer a “satisfactory” return; 26% considered it “not
safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through 1958, the stock market earned one
of its highest 10-year returns in history, averaging 18.7% annually. In
a fascinating echo of that early Fed survey, a poll conducted by
BusinessWeek at year-end 2002 found that only 24% of investors were
willing to invest more in their mutual funds or stock portfolios, down
from 47% just three years earlier.</p></li>
<li><p>Speculation is beneficial on two levels: First, without
speculation, untested new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier
times, the Edison Electric Light Co.) would never be able to raise the
necessary capital for expansion. The alluring, long-shot chance of a
huge gain is the grease that lubricates the machinery of innovation.
Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never eliminated) every time a stock is
bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary risk that this stock may
go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual risk—the chance
that the stock he just sold may go up!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† A margin account enables you to buy stocks using money you borrow
from the brokerage firm. By investing with borrowed money, you make more
when your stocks go up—but you can be wiped out when they go down. The
collateral for the loan is the value of the investments in your
account—so you must put up more money if that value falls below the
amount you borrowed. For more information about margin accounts, see
www.sec.gov/investor/ pubs/margin.htm,
www.sia.com/publications/pdf/MarginsA.pdf, and www.
nyse.com/pdfs/2001_factbook_09.pdf.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of
investing experts is saying: The future of security prices is never
predictable. And as you read ahead in the book, notice how everything
else Graham tells you is designed to help you grapple with that truth.
Since you cannot predict the behavior of the markets, you must learn how
to predict and control your own behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems,
very well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks
earned an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the
time period for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was
thinking of a 10-year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6%
annually over this period, eating up the entire gain that stocks
produced. In this section of his chapter, Graham is summarizing what is
known as the “Gordon equation,” which essentially holds that the stock
market’s future return is the sum of the current dividend yield plus
expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield of just under 2% in
early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around 2%, plus inflation
at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly 6% is
plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or
TIPS) were introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically
superior choice for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS,
unlike other bonds, rise in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up,
effectively immunizing the investor against losing money after
inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee and, in fact, are a relatively
poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For more details, see the
commentary to Chapter 2.)</p></li>
<li><p>Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index
(the “S andandandand P”) and the Wilshire 5000 index. The S andandandand
P focuses on 500 large, well-known companies that make up roughly 70% of
the total value of the U.S. equity market. The Wilshire 5000 follows the
returns of nearly every significant, publicly traded stock in America,
roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest companies account for most
of the total value of the index, the return of the Wilshire 5000 is
usually quite similar to that of the S andandandand P 500. Several
low-cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these
indexes as a single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 363–366 and pp. 376–380.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† For greater detail, see Chapter 6.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see
Chapter 9. “Professional administration” by “a recognized
investment-counsel firm” is discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost
averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 8.</p></li>
<li><p>In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that
its share price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process:
First, you borrow shares from someone who owns them; then you
immediately sell the borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with
shares you buy later. If the stock drops, you will be able to buy your
replacement shares at a lower price. The difference between the price at
which you sold your borrowed shares and the price you paid for the
replacement shares is your gross profit (reduced by dividend or interest
charges, along with brokerage costs). However, if the stock goes up in
price instead of down, your potential loss is unlimited—making short
sales unacceptably speculative for most individual investors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged
buyouts multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to
profit from any errors in pricing these complex deals. They became so
good at it that the easy profits disappeared and many of these desks
have been closed down. Although Graham does discuss it again (see
pp. 174–175), this sort of trading is no longer feasible or appropriate
for most people, since only multimillion-dollar trades are large enough
to generate worthwhile profits. Wealthy individuals and institutions can
utilize this strategy through hedge funds that specialize in merger or
“event” arbitrage.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the
dominant power in European investment banking and brokerage in the
nineteenth century. For a brilliant history, see Niall Ferguson, The
House of Rothschild: Money’s Prophets, 1798–1848 (Viking, 1998).</li>
</ul>
<p>1 Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his
definition: “thorough analysis” means “the study of the facts in the
light of established standards of safety and value” while “safety of
principal” signifies “protection against loss under all normal or
reasonably likely conditions or variations” and “adequate” (or
“satisfactory”) return refers to “any rate or amount of return, however
low, which the investor is willing to accept, provided he acts with
reasonable intelligence.” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed., pp. 55–56).</p>
<p>2 Security Analysis, 1934 ed., p. 310.</p>
<p>3 As Graham advised in an interview, “Ask yourself: If there was no
market for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in
this company on these terms?” (Forbes, January 1, 1972, p. 90.)</p>
<p>4 Source: Steve Galbraith, Sanford C. Bernstein andandandand
Co. research report, January 10, 2000. The stocks in this table had an
average return of 1196.4% in 1999. They lost an average of 79.1% in
2000, 35.5% in 2001, and 44.5% in 2002—destroying all the gains of 1999,
and then some.</p>
<p>5 Instead of stargazing, Streisand should have been channeling
Graham. The intelligent investor never dumps a stock purely because its
share price has fallen; she always asks first whether the value of the
company’s underlying businesses has changed.</p>
<p>6 Just 12 months later, Juno’s shares had shriveled to .093.</p>
<p>7 A ticker symbol is an abbreviation, usually one to four letters
long, of a company’s name used as shorthand to identify a stock for
trading purposes.</p>
<p>8 This was not an isolated incident; on at least three other
occasions in the late 1990s, day traders sent the wrong stock soaring
when they mistook its ticker symbol for that of a newly minted Internet
company.</p>
<p>9 In 2000 and 2001, Amazon.com and Qualcomm lost a cumulative total
of 85.8% and 71.3% of their value, respectively.</p>
<p>10 Schwert discusses these findings in a brilliant research paper,
“Anomalies and Market Efficiency,” available at
http://schwert.ssb.rochester.edu/papers.htm.</p>

<p>12 James O’Shaughnessy, What Works on Wall Street (McGraw-Hill,
1996), pp. xvi, 273–295.</p>
<p>13 In a remarkable irony, the surviving two O’Shaughnessy funds (now
known as the Hennessy funds) began performing quite well just as
O’Shaughnessy announced that he was turning over the management to
another company. The funds’ shareholders were furious. In a chat room at
www.morningstar.com, one fumed: “I guess ‘long term’ for O’S is 3
years…. I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O’S’s method…. I had told
severalfriends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they
didn’t act on my advice.”</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The list of sources for investment advice remains as
“miscellaneous” as it was when Graham wrote. A survey of investors
conducted in late 2002 for the Securities Industry Association, a Wall
Street trade group, found that 17% of investors depended most heavily
for investment advice on a spouse or friend; 2% on a banker; 16% on a
broker; 10% on financial periodicals; and 24% on a financial planner.
The only difference from Graham’s day is that 8% of investors now rely
heavily on the Internet and 3% on financial television. (See
www.sia.com.)</p></li>
<li><p>The character of investment counseling firms and trust banks has
not changed, but today they generally do not offer their services to
investors with less than million in financial assets; in some cases,
million or more is required. Today thousands of independent
financial-planning firms perform very similar functions, although (as
analyst Robert Veres puts it) the mutual fund has replaced blue-chip
stocks as the investment of choice and diversification has replaced
“quality” as the standard of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, Graham was as tough and cynical an observer as Wall
Street has ever seen. In this rare case, however, he was not nearly
cynical enough. Wall Street may have higher ethical standards than some
businesses (smuggling, prostitution, Congressional lobbying, and
journalism come to mind) but the investment world nevertheless has
enough liars, cheaters, and thieves to keep Satan’s check-in clerks
frantically busy for decades to come.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† The thousands of people who bought stocks in the late 1990s in the
belief that Wall Street analysts were providing unbiased and valuable
advice have learned, in a painful way, how right Graham is on this
point.</p>
<p>† ‡ Interestingly, this stinging criticism, which in his day Graham
was directing at full-service brokers, ended up applying to discount
Internet brokers in the late 1990s. These firms spent millions of
dollars on flashy advertising that goaded their customers into trading
more and trading faster. Most of those customers ended up picking their
own pockets, instead of paying someone else to do it for them—and the
cheap commissions on that kind of transaction are a poor consolation for
the result. More traditional brokerage firms, meanwhile, began
emphasizing financial planning and “integrated asset management,”
instead of compensating their brokers only on the basis of how many
commissions they could generate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This remains true, although many of Wall Street’s best analysts
hold the title of chartered financial analyst. The CFA certification is
awarded by the Association of Investment Management andandandand
Research (formerly the Financial Analysts Federation) only after the
candidate has completed years of rigorous study and passed a series of
difficult exams. More than 50,000 analysts worldwide have been certified
as CFAs. Sadly, a recent survey by Professor Stanley Block found that
most CFAs ignore Graham’s teachings: Growth potential ranks higher than
quality of earnings, risks, and dividend policy in determining P/E
ratios, while far more analysts base their buy ratings on recent price
than on the long-term outlook for the company. See Stanley Block, “A
Study of Financial Analysts: Practice and Theory,” Financial Analysts
Journal, July/August, 1999, at www.aimrpubs.org. As Graham was fond of
saying, his own books have been read by—and ignored by—more people than
any other books in finance.</p></li>
<li><p>It is highly unusual today for a security analyst to allow mere
commoners to contact him directly. For the most part, only the nobility
of institutional investors are permitted to approach the throne of the
almighty Wall Street analyst. An individual investor might, perhaps,
have some luck calling analysts who work at “regional” brokerage firms
headquartered outside of New York City. The investor relations area at
the websites of most publicly traded companies will provide a list of
analysts who follow the stock. Websites like www.zacks.com and
www.multex.com offer access to analysts’ research reports—but the
intelligent investor should remember that most analysts do not analyze
businesses. Instead, they engage in guesswork about future stock
prices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Benjamin Graham was the prime force behind the establishment of the
CFA program, which he advocated for nearly two decades before it became
a reality.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The two firms Graham had in mind were probably Du Pont, Glore,
Forgan andandandand Co. and Goodbody andandandand Co. Du Pont (founded
by the heirs to the chemical fortune) was saved from insolvency in 1970
only after Texas entrepreneur H. Ross Perot lent more than 0 million to
the firm; Goodbody, the fifth-largest brokerage firm in the United
States, would have failed in late 1970 had Merrill Lynch not acquired
it. Hayden, Stone andandandand Co. would also have gone under if it had
not been acquired. In 1970, no fewer than seven brokerage firms went
bust. The farcical story of Wall Street’s frenzied over-expansion in the
late 1960s is beautifully told in John Brooks’s The Go-Go Years (John
Wiley andandandand Sons, New York, 1999).</p></li>
<li><p>Nearly all brokerage transactions are now conducted
electronically, and securities are no longer physically “delivered.”
Thanks to the establishment of the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation, or SIPC, in 1970, investors are generally assured of
recovering their full account values if their brokerage firm becomes
insolvent. SIPC is a government-mandated consortium of brokers; all the
members agree to pool their assets to cover losses incurred by the
customers of any firm that becomes insolvent. SIPC’s protection
eliminates the need for investors to make payment and take delivery
through a bank intermediary, as Graham urges.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who heeded Graham’s advice would not have been suckered
into buying Internet IPOs in 1999 and 2000.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This traditional role of bankers has for the most part been
supplanted by accountants, lawyers, or financial planners.</p>
<p>1 For a particularly thoughtful discussion of these issues, see
Walter Updegrave, “Advice on Advice,” Money, January, 2003,
pp. 53–55.</p>
<p>2 If you’re unable to get a referral from someone you trust, you may
be able to find a fee-only financial planner through www.napfa.org (or
www.feeonly. org), whose members are generally held to high standards of
service and integrity.</p>
<p>3 By itself, a customer complaint is not enough to disqualify an
adviser from your consideration; but a persistent pattern of complaints
is. And a disciplinary action by state or Federal regulators usually
tells you to find another adviser. Another source for checking a
broker’s record is http://pdpi.nasdr. com/PDPI.</p>
<p>4 Robert Veres, editor and publisher of the Inside Information
newsletter, generously shared these responses for this book. Other
checklists of questions can be found at www.cfp-board.org and
www.napfa.org.</p>
<p>5 Credentials like the CFA, CFP, or CPA tell you that the adviser has
taken and passed a rigorous course of study. (Most of the other
“alphabet soup” of credentials brandished by financial planners,
including the “CFM” or the “CMFC,” signify very little.) More important,
by contacting the organization that awards the credential, you can
verify his record and check that he has not been disciplined for
violations of rules or ethics.</p>
<p>6 If you have less than 00,000 to invest, you may not be able to find
a financial adviser who will take your account. In that case, buy a
diversified basket of low-cost index funds, follow the behavioral advice
throughout this book, and your portfolio should eventually grow to the
level at which you can afford an adviser.</p>

<li><p>The National Federation of Financial Analysts is now the
Association for Investment Management and Research; its “quarterly”
research publication, the Financial Analysts Journal, now appears every
other month.</p></li>
<li><p>The higher the growth rate you project, and the longer the future
period over which you project it, the more sensitive your forecast
becomes to the slightest error. If, for instance, you estimate that a
company earning per share can raise that profit by 15% a year for the
next 15 years, its earnings would end up at .14. If the market values
the company at 35 times earnings, the stock would finish the period at
roughly 85. But if earnings grow at 14% instead of 15%, the company
would earn .14 at the end of the period—and, in the shock of that
shortfall, investors would no longer be willing to pay 35 times
earnings. At, say, 20 times earnings, the stock would end up around 40
per share, or more than 50% less. Because advanced mathematics gives the
appearance of precision to the inherently iffy process of foreseeing the
future, investors must be highly skeptical of anyone who claims to hold
any complex computational key to basic financial problems. As Graham put
it: “In 44 years of Wall Street experience and study, I have never seen
dependable calculations made about common-stock values, or related
investment policies, that went beyond simple arithmetic or the most
elementary algebra. Whenever calculus is brought in, or higher algebra,
you could take it as a warning signal that the operator was trying to
substitute theory for experience, and usually also to give to
speculation the deceptive guise of investment.” (See p. 570.)</p></li>
<li><p>In 1972, an investor in corporate bonds had little choice but to
assemble his or her own portfolio. Today, roughly 500 mutual funds
invest in corporate bonds, creating a convenient, well-diversified
bundle of securities. Since it is not feasible to build a diversified
bond portfolio on your own unless you have at least 00,000, the typical
intelligent investor will be best off simply buying a low-cost bond fund
and leaving the painstaking labor of credit research to its managers.
For more on bond funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>By “junior stock issues” Graham means shares of common stock.
Preferred stock is considered “senior” to common stock because the
company must pay all dividends on the preferred before paying any
dividends on the common.</p></li>
<li><p>After investors lost billions of dollars on the shares of
recklessly assembled utility companies in 1929–1932, Congress authorized
the SEC to regulate the issuance of utility stocks under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.</p></li>
<li><p>In more recent years, most mutual funds have almost robotically
mimicked the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index, lest any
different holdings cause their returns to deviate from that of the
index. In a countertrend, some fund companies have launched what they
call “focused” portfolios, which own 25 to 50 stocks that the managers
declare to be their “best ideas.” That leaves investors wondering
whether the other funds run by the same managers contain their worst
ideas. Considering that most of the “best idea” funds do not markedly
outperform the averages, investors are also entitled to wonder whether
the managers’ ideas are even worth having in the first place. For
indisputably skilled investors like Warren Buffett, wide diversification
would be foolish, since it would water down the concentrated force of a
few great ideas. But for the typical fund manager or individual
investor, not diversifying is foolish, since it is so difficult to
select a limited number of stocks that will include most winners and
exclude most losers. As you own more stocks, the damage any single loser
can cause will decline, and the odds of owning all the big winners will
rise. The ideal choice for most investors is a total stock market index
fund, a low-cost way to hold every stock worth owning.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point about chemical and oil companies in the 1960s
applies to nearly every industry in nearly every time period. Wall
Street’s consensus view of the future for any given sector is usually
either too optimistic or too pessimistic. Worse, the consensus is at its
most cheery just when the stocks are most overpriced—and gloomiest just
when they are cheapest. The most recent example, of course, is
technology and telecommunications stocks, which hit record highs when
their future seemed brightest in 1999 and early 2000, and then crashed
all the way through 2002. History proves that Wall Street’s “expert”
forecasters are equally inept at predicting the performance of 1) the
market as a whole, 2) industry sectors, and 3) specific stocks. As
Graham points out, the odds that individual investors can do any better
are not good. The intelligent investor excels by making decisions that
are not dependent on the accuracy of anybody’s forecasts, including his
or her own. (See Chapter 8.)</p></li>
<li><p>This figure, now known as the “dividend payout ratio,” has
dropped considerably since Graham’s day as American tax law discouraged
investors from seeking, and corporations from paying, dividends. As of
year-end 2002, the payout ratio stood at 34.1% for the S andandandand P
500-stock index and, as recently as April 2000, it hit an all-time low
of just 25.3%. (See www.barra.com/ research/fundamentals.asp.) We
discuss dividend policy more thoroughly in the commentary on Chapter
19.</p></li>
<li><p>Why is this? By “the rule of 72,” at 10% interest a given amount
of money doubles in just over seven years, while at 7% it doubles in
just over 10 years. When interest rates are high, the amount of money
you need to set aside today to reach a given value in the future is
lower—since those high interest rates will enable it to grow at a more
rapid rate. Thus a rise in interest rates today makes a future stream of
earnings or dividends less valuable—since the alternative of investing
in bonds has become relatively more attractive.</p></li>
<li><p>These industry groups, ideally, would not be overly dependent on
such unforeseeable factors as fluctuating interest rates or the future
direction of prices for raw materials like oil or metals. Possibilities
might be industries like gaming, cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, nursing
homes, or waste management.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Because so few of today’s individual investors buy—or should
buy—individual bonds, we will limit this discussion to stock analysis.
For more on bond funds, see the commentary on Chapter 4.</p>
<p>2 You should also get at least one year’s worth of quarterly reports
(on Form 10-Q). By definition, we are assuming that you are an
“enterprising” investor willing to devote a considerable amount of
effort to your portfolio. If the steps in this chapter sound like too
much work to you, then you are not temperamentally well suited to
picking your own stocks. You cannot reliably obtain the results you
imagine unless you put in the kind of effort we describe.</p>
<p>3 You can usually find details on acquisitions in the “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis” section of Form 10-K; cross-check it against
the footnotes to the financial statements. For more on “serial
acquirers,” see the commentary on Chapter 12.</p>
<p>4 To determine whether a company is an OPM addict, read the
“Statement of Cash Flows” in the financial statements. This page breaks
down the company’s cash inflows and outflows into “operating
activities,” “investing activities,” and “financing activities.” If cash
from operating activities is consistently negative, while cash from
financing activities is consistently positive, the company has a habit
of craving more cash than its own businesses can produce—and you should
not join the “enablers” of that habitual abuse. For more on Global
Crossing, see the commentary on Chapter 12. For more on WorldCom, see

<p>10 Stock splits are discussed further in the commentary on Chapter
13.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Dilution” is one of many words that describe stocks in the language
of fluid dynamics. A stock with high trading volume is said to be
“liquid.” When a company goes public in an IPO, it “floats” its shares.
And, in earlier days, a company that drastically diluted its shares
(with large amounts of convertible debt or multiple offerings of common
stock) was said to have “watered” its stock. This term is believed to
have originated with the legendary market manipulator Daniel Drew
(1797–1879), who began as a livestock trader. He would drive his cattle
south toward Manhattan, force-feeding them salt along the way. When they
got to the Harlem River, they would guzzle huge volumes of water to
slake their thirst. Drew would then bring them to market, where the
water they had just drunk would increase their weight. That enabled him
to get a much higher price, since cattle on the hoof is sold by the
pound. Drew later watered the stock of the Erie Railroad by massively
issuing new shares without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham is referring to the precise craftsmanship of the immigrant
Italian stone carvers who ornamented the otherwise plain facades of
buildings throughout New York in the early 1900s. Accountants, likewise,
can transform simple financial facts into intricate and even
incomprehensible patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The king probably took his inspiration from a once-famous essay
by the English writer William Hazlitt, who mused about a sundial near
Venice that bore the words Horas non numero nisi serenas, or “I count
only the hours that are serene.” Companies that chronically exclude bad
news from their financial results on the pretext that negative events
are “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” are taking a page from Hazlitt,
who urged his readers “to take no note of time but by its benefits, to
watch only for the smiles and neglect the frowns of fate, to compose our
lives of bright and gentle moments, turning away to the sunny side of
things, and letting the rest slip from our imaginations, unheeded or
forgotten!” (William Hazlitt, “On a Sun-Dial,” ca.1827.) Unfortunately,
investors must always count the sunny and dark hours alike.</p></li>
<li><p>The company to which Graham refers so coyly appears to be
American Machine andandandand Foundry (or AMF Corp.), one of the most
jumbled conglomerates of the late 1960s. It was a predecessor of today’s
AMF Bowling Worldwide, which operates bowling alleys and manufactures
bowling equipment.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowadays, investors need to be aware of several other “accounting
factors” that can distort reported earnings. One is “pro forma” or “as
if” financial statements, which report a company’s earnings as if
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) did not apply. Another
is the dilutive effect of issuing millions of stock options for
executive compensation, then buying back millions of shares to keep
those options from reducing the value of the common stock. A third is
unrealistic assumptions of return on the company’s pension funds, which
can artificially inflate earnings in good years and depress them in bad.
Another is “Special Purpose Entities,” oraffiliated firms or
partnerships that buy risky assets or liabilities of the company and
thus “remove” those financial risks from the company’s balance sheet.
Another element of distortion is the treatment of marketing or other
“soft” costs as assets of the company, rather than as normal expenses of
doing business. We will briefly examine such practices in the commentary
that accompanies this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Northwest Industries was the holding company for, among other
businesses, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. and Union Underwear
(the maker of both BVD and Fruit of the Loom briefs). It was taken over
in 1985 by overindebted financier William Farley, who ran the company
into the ground. Fruit of the Loom was bought in a bankruptcy proceeding
by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in early 2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is referring to the provision of Federal tax law that
allows corporations to “carry forward” their net operating losses. As
the tax code now stands, these losses can be carried forward for up to
20 years, reducing the company’s tax liability for the entire period
(and thus raising its earnings after tax). Therefore, investors should
consider whether recent severe losses could actually improve the
company’s net earnings in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Investors should keep these words at hand and remind themselves of
them frequently: “Stock valuations are really dependable only in
exceptional cases.” While the prices of most stocks are approximately
right most of the time, the price of a stock and the value of its
business are almost never identical. The market’s judgment on price is
often unreliable. Unfortunately, the margin of the market’s pricing
errors is often not wide enough to justify the expense of trading on
them. The intelligent investor must carefully evaluate the costs of
trading and taxes before attempting to take advantage of any price
discrepancy—and should never count on being able to sell for the exact
price currently quoted in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Mean figure” refers to the simple, or arithmetic, average that
Graham describes in the preceding sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>aThree-fifths of special charges of 82 cents in 1970 deducted
here.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham appears to be using “earnings on capital funds” in the
traditional sense of return on book value—essentially, net income
divided by the company’s tangible net assets.</p></li>
<li><p>See pp. 299–301.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Recent history—and a mountain of financial research—have shown that
the market is unkindest to rapidly growing companies that suddenly
report a fall in earnings. More moderate and stable growers, as ALCOA
was in Graham’s day or Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive are in our
time, tend to suffer somewhat milder stock declines if they report
disappointing earnings. Great expectations lead to great disappointment
if they are not met; a failure to meet moderate expectations leads to a
much milder reaction. Thus, one of the biggest risks in owning growth
stocks is not that their growth will stop, but merely that it will slow
down. And in the long run, that is not merely a risk, but a virtual
certainty.</p>
<p>1 For more on how stock options can enrich corporate managers—but not
necessarily outside shareholders—see the commentary on Chapter 19.</p>
<p>2 All the above examples are taken directly from press releases
issued by the companies themselves. For a brilliant satire on what daily
life would be like if we all got to justify our behavior the same way
companies adjust their reported earnings, see “My Pro Forma Life,” by
Rob Walker, at http://slate. msn.com/?id=2063953. (“…a recent
post-workout lunch of a 22-ounce, bone-in rib steak at Smith
andandandand Wollensky and three shots of bourbon is treated here as a
nonrecurring expense. I’ll never do that again!”)</p>
<p>3 In 2002, Qwest was one of 330 publicly-traded companies to restate
past financial statements, an all-time record, according to Huron
Consulting Group. All information on Qwest is taken from its financial
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (annual report,
Form 8K, and Form 10-K) found in the EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. No
hindsight was required to detect the “change in accounting principle,”
which Qwest fully disclosed at the time. How did Qwest’s shares do over
this period? At year-end 2000, the stock had been at 1 per share, a
total market value of 7.9 billion. By early 2003, Qwest was around ,
valuing the entire company at less than billion—a 90% loss. The drop in
share price is not the only cost associated with bogus earnings; a
recent study found that a sample of 27 firms accused of accounting fraud
by the SEC had overpaid 20 million in Federal income tax. Although much
of that money will eventually be refunded by the IRS, most shareholders
are unlikely to stick around to benefit from the refunds. (See Merle
Erickson, Michelle Hanlon, and Edward Maydew, “How Much Will Firms Pay
for Earnings that Do Not Exist?” at http:// papers.ssrn.com.)</p>
<p>4 Global Crossing formerly treated much of its construction costs as
an expense to be charged against the revenue generated from the sale or
lease of usage rights on its network. Customers generally paid for their
rights up front, although some could pay in installments over periods of
up to four years. But Global Crossing did not book most of the revenues
up front, instead deferring them over the lifetime of the lease. Now,
however, because the networks had an estimated usable life of up to 25
years, Global Crossing began treating them as depreciable, long-lived
capital assets. While this treatment conforms with Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, it is unclear why Global Crossing did not use it
before October 1, 1999, or what exactly prompted the change. As of March
2001, Global Crossing had a total stock valuation of 2.6 billion; the
company filed for bankruptcy on January 28, 2002, rendering its common
stock essentially worthless.</p>
<p>5 I am grateful to Howard Schilit and Mark Hamel of the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis for providing this example.</p>
<p>6 Returns are approximated by dividing the total net value of plan
assets at the beginning of the year by “actual return on plan
assets.”</p>
<p>7 Do not be put off by the stupefyingly boring verbiage of accounting
footnotes. They are designed expressly to deter normal people from
actually reading them—which is why you must persevere. A footnote to the
1996 annual report of Informix Corp., for instance, disclosed that “The
Company generally recognizes license revenue from sales of software
licenses upon delivery of the software product to a customer. However,
for certain computer hardware manufacturers and end-user licensees with
amounts payable within twelve months, the Company will recognize revenue
at the time the customer makes a contractual commitment for a minimum
nonrefundable license fee, if such computer hardware manufacturers and
end-user licensees meet certain criteria established by the Company.” In
plain English, Informix was saying that it would credit itself for
revenues on products even if they had not yet been resold to “end-users”
(the actual customers for Informix’s software). Amid allegations by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Informix had committed
accounting fraud, the company later restated its revenues, wiping away
44 million in such “sales.” This case is a keen reminder of the
importance of reading the fine print with a skeptical eye. I am indebted
to Martin Fridson for suggesting this example.</p>

remains an excellent brief introduction to the basic principles of
earnings and expenses, assets and liabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Of Graham’s four examples, only Emerson Electric still exists in
the same form. ELTRA Corp. is no longer an independent company; it
merged with Bunker Ramo Corp. in the 1970s, putting it in the business
of supplying stock quotes to brokerage firms across an early network of
computers. What remains of ELTRA’s operations is now part of Honeywell
Corp. The firm formerly known as Emery Air Freight is now a division of
CNF Inc. Emhart Corp. was acquired by Black andandandand Decker Corp. in
1989.</p></li>
<li><p>This measure is captured in the line “Net per share/book value”
in Table 13-2, which measures the companies’ net income as a percentage
of their tangible book value.</p></li>
<li><p>In each case, Graham is referring to Section C of Table 13-2 and
dividing the high price during the 1936–1968 period by the low price.
For example, Emery’s high price of 66 divided by its low price of 1/8
equals 528, or a ratio of 528 to 1 between the high and low.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of 1970, Emerson’s .6 billion in market value truly
was “enormous,” given average stock sizes at the time. At year-end 2002,
Emerson’s common stock had a total market value of approximately 1
billion.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham was right. Of the “Nifty Fifty” stocks that were most
fashionable and highly valued in 1972, Emery fared among the worst. The
March 1, 1982, issue of Forbes reported that since 1972 Emery had lost
72.8% of its value after inflation. By late 1974, according to the
investment researchers at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, Emery’s
stock had already fallen 58% and its price/earnings ratio had plummeted
from 64 times to just 15. The “overenthusiasm” Graham had warned against
was eviscerated in short order. Can the passage of time make up for this
kind of excess? Not always: Leuthold calculated that 000 invested in
Emery in 1972 would be worth only 39 as of 1999. It’s likely that the
people who overpaid for Internet stocks in the late 1990s will not break
even for decades—if ever (see the commentary on Chapter 20).</p></li>
<li><p>Graham’s point is that, based on their prices at the time, an
investor could buy shares in these two companies for little more than
their book value, as shown in the third line of Section B in Table
13-2.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 As we will see in Chapter 19, this rationale often means, in
practice, “to provide funds for the continued growth of the company’s
top managers’ wealth.”</p>
<p>2 Appearing on CNBC on December 30, 1999, EMC’s chief executive,
Michael Ruettgers, was asked by host Ron Insana whether “2000 and
beyond” would be as good as the 1990s had been. “It actually looks like
it’s accelerating,” boasted Ruettgers. When Insana asked if EMC’s stock
was overvalued, Ruettgers answered: “I think when you look at the
opportunity we have in front of us, it’s almost unlimited…. So while
it’s hard to predictwhether these things are overpriced, there’s such a
major change taking place that if you could find the winners today—and I
certainly think EMC is one of those people—you’ll be well rewarded in
the future.”</p>
<p>3 The “Y2K bug” or the “Year 2000 Problem” was the belief that
millions of computers worldwide would stop functioning at one second
past midnight on the morning of January 1, 2000, because programmers in
the 1960s and 1970s had not thought to allow for the possibility of any
date past 12/31/1999 in their operating code. U.S. companies spent
billions of dollars in 1999 to ensure that their computers would be
“Y2K-compliant.” In the end, at 12:00:01 A.M. on January 1, 2000,
everything worked just fine.</p>

Appendix, p. 563.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham describes his recommended investment policies in Chapters 4
through 7.</li>
</ul>
<p>† As we have discussed in the commentaries on Chapters 5 and 9,
today’s defensive investor can achieve this goal simply by buying a
low-cost index fund, ideally one that tracks the return of the total
U.S. stock market.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In early 2003, the yield on 10-year, AA-rated corporate bonds was
around 4.6%, suggesting—by Graham’s formula—that a stock portfolio
should have an earnings-to-price ratio at least that high. Taking the
inverse of that number (by dividing 4.6 into 100), we can derive a
“suggested maximum” P/E ratio of 21.7. At the beginning of this
paragraph Graham recommends that the “average” stock be priced about 20%
below the “maximum” ratio. That suggests that—in general—Graham would
consider stocks selling at no more than 17 times their three-year
average earnings to be potentially attractive given today’s interest
rates and market conditions. As of December 31, 2002, more than 200—or
better than 40%—of the stocks in the S andandandand P 500-stock index
had three-year average P/E ratios of 17.0 or lower. Updated AA bond
yields can be found at www.bondtalk.com.</p></li>
<li><p>An easy-to-use online stock screener that can sort the stocks in
the S andandandand P 500 by most of Graham’s criteria is available at:
www.quicken.com/ investments/stocks/search/full.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† When Graham wrote, only one major mutual fund specializing in
utility stocks—Franklin Utilities—was widely available. Today there are
more than 30. Graham could not have anticipated the financial havoc
wrought by canceled and decommissioned nuclear energy plants; nor did he
foresee the consequences of bungled regulation in California. Utility
stocks are vastly more volatile than they were in Graham’s day, and most
investors should own them only through a well-diversified, low-cost fund
like the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Sector Index Fund (ticker symbol: IDU)
or Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU). For more information, see:
www.ishares.com and www. spdrindex.com/spdr/. (Be sure your broker will
not charge commissions to reinvest your dividends.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a remarkable confirmation of Graham’s point, the dull-sounding
Standard andandandand Poor’s Utility Index outperformed the vaunted
NASDAQ Composite Index for the 30 years ending December 31,
2002.</p></li>
<li><p>Today the financial-services industry is made up of even more
components, including commercial banks; savings andandandand loan and
mortgage-financing companies; consumer-finance firms like credit-card
issuers; money managers and trust companies; investment banks and
brokerages; insurance companies; and firms engaged in developing or
owning real estate, including real-estate investment trusts. Although
the sector is much more diversified today, Graham’s caveats about
financial soundness apply more than ever.</p></li>
<li><p>Only a few major rail stocks now remain, including Burlington
Northern, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Union Pacific. The advice in this
section is at least as relevant to airline stocks today—with their
massive current losses and a half-century of almost incessantly poor
results—as it was to railroads in Graham’s day.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is summarizing the “efficient markets hypothesis,” or EMH,
an academic theory claiming that the price of each stock incorporates
all publicly available information about the company. With millions of
investors scouring the market every day, it is unlikely that severe
mispricings can persist for long. An old joke has two finance professors
walking along the sidewalk; when one spots a 0 bill and bends over to
pick it up, the other grabs his arm and says, “Don’t bother. If it was
really a 0 bill, someone would have taken it already.” While the market
is not perfectly efficient, it is pretty close most of the time—so the
intelligent investor will stoop to pick up the stock market’s 0 bills
only after researching them thoroughly and minimizing the costs of
trading and taxes.</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of the central points of Graham’s book. All investors
labor under a cruel irony: We invest in the present, but we invest for
the future. And, unfortunately, the future is almost entirely uncertain.
Inflation and interest rates are undependable; economic recessions come
and go at random; geopolitical upheavals like war, commodity shortages,
and terrorism arrive without warning; and the fate of individual
companies and their industries often turns out to be the opposite of
what most investors expect. Therefore, investing on the basis of
projection is a fool’s errand; even the forecasts of the so-called
experts are less reliable than the flip of a coin. For most people,
investing on the basis of protection—from overpaying for a stock and
from overconfidence in the quality of their own judgment—is the best
solution. Graham expands on this concept in Chapter 20.</p></li>

<p>1 Adjusted for stock splits. To many people, MicroStrategy really did
look like the next Microsoft in early 2000; its stock had gained 566.7%
in 1999, and its chairman, Michael Saylor, declared that “our future
today is better than it was 18 months ago.” The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission later accused MicroStrategy of accounting fraud, and
Saylor paid an .3 million fine to settle the charges.</p>

<p>4 For more on what to look for, see the commentary on Chapters 11,
12, and 19. If you are not willing to go to the minimal effort of
reading the proxy and making basic comparisons of financial health
across five years’ worth of annual reports, then you are too defensive
to be buying individual stocks at all. Get yourself out of the
stock-picking business and into an index fund, where you belong.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Friend-Blume-Crockett research covered January 1960, through
June 1968, and compared the performance of more than 100 major mutual
funds against the returns on portfolios constructed randomly from more
than 500 of the largest stocks listed on the NYSE. The funds in the
Friend-Blume-Crockett study did better from 1965 to 1968 than they had
in the first half of the measurement period, much as Graham found in his
own research (see above, pp. 158 and 229–232). But that improvement did
not last. And the thrust of these studies—that mutual funds, on average,
underperform the market by a margin roughly equal to their operating
expenses and trading costs—has been reconfirmed so many times that
anyone who doubts them should found a financial chapter of The Flat
Earth Society.</p></li>
<li><p>As we discuss in the commentary on Chapter 9, there are several
other reasons mutual funds have not been able to outperform the market
averages, including the low returns on the funds’ cash balances and the
high costs of researching and trading stocks. Also, a fund holding 120
companies (a typical number) can trail the S andandandand P 500-stock
index if any of the other 380 companies in that benchmark turns out to
be a great performer. The fewer stocks a fund owns, the more likely it
is to miss “the next Microsoft.”</p></li>
<li><p>In this section, as he did also on pp. 363–364, Graham is
summarizing the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Recent appearances to the
contrary, the problem with the stock market today is not that so many
financial analysts are idiots, but rather that so many of them are so
smart. As more and more smart people search the market for bargains,
that very act of searching makes those bargains rarer—and, in a cruel
paradox, makes the analysts look as if they lack the intelligence to
justify the search. The market’s valuation of a given stock is the
result of a vast, continuous, real-time operation of collective
intelligence. Most of the time, for most stocks, that collective
intelligence gets the valuation approximately right. Only rarely does
Graham’s “Mr. Market” (see Chapter 8) send prices wildly out of
whack.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham launched Graham-Newman Corp. in January 1936, and dissolved
it when he retired from active money management in 1956; it was the
successor to a partnership called the Benjamin Graham Joint Account,
which he ran from January 1926, through December 1935.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An “unrelated” hedge involves buying a stock or bond issued by
one company and short-selling (or betting on a decline in) a security
issued by a different company. A “related” hedge involves buying and
selling different stocks or bonds issued by the same company. The “new
group” of hedge funds described by Graham were widely available around
1968, but later regulation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission restricted access to hedge funds for the general
public.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2003, an intelligent investor following Graham’s train of
thought would be searching for opportunities in the technology,
telecommunications, and electric-utility industries. History has shown
that yesterday’s losers are often tomorrow’s winners.</p></li>
<li><p>The successor corporation to Industrial National Bank of Rhode
Island is FleetBoston Financial Corp. One of its corporate ancestors,
the Providence Bank, was founded in 1791.</p></li>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the cutoff is more likely to be around per
share—the level below which many stocks are “delisted,” or declared
ineligible for trading on major exchanges. Just monitoring the stock
prices of these companies can take a considerable amount of effort,
making them impractical for defensive investors. The costs of trading
low-priced stocks can be very high. Finally, companies with very low
stock prices have a distressing tendency to go out of business. However,
a diversified portfolio of dozens of these distressed companies may
still appeal to some enterprising investors today.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s terms, a large amount of goodwill can result from two
causes: a corporation can acquire other companies for substantially more
than the value of their assets, or its own stock can trade for
substantially more than its book value.</p></li>
<li><p>Technically, the working-capital value of a stock is the current
assets per share, minus the current liabilities per share, divided by
the number of shares outstanding. Here, however, Graham means “net
working-capital value,” or the per-share value of current assets minus
total liabilities.</p></li>

<p>1 As a brief example of how convertible bonds work in practice,
consider the 4.75% convertible subordinated notes issued by DoubleClick
Inc. in 1999. They pay 7.50 in interest per year and are each
convertible into 24.24 shares of the company’s common stock, a
“conversion ratio” of 24.24. As of year-end 2002, DoubleClick’s stock
was priced at .66 a share, giving each bond a “conversion value” of
37.20 (.66 24.24). Yet the bonds traded roughly six times higher, at
81.30—creating a “conversion premium,” or excess over their conversion
value, of 542%. If you bought at that price, your “break-even time,” or
“payback period,” was very long. (You paid roughly 50 more than the
conversion value of the bond, so it will takenearly 16 years of 7.50
interest payments for you to “earn back” that conversion premium.) Since
each DoubleClick bond is convertible to just over 24 common shares, the
stock will have to rise from .66 to more than 6 if conversion is to
become a practical option before the bonds mature in 2006. Such a stock
return is not impossible, but it borders on the miraculous. The cash
yield on this particular bond scarcely seems adequate, given the low
probability of conversion.</p>
<p>2 Like many of the track records commonly cited on Wall Street, this
one is hypothetical. It indicates the return you would have earned in an
imaginary index fund that owned all major convertibles. It does not
include any management fees or trading costs (which are substantial for
convertible securities). In the real world, your returns would have been
roughly two percentage points lower.</p>
<p>3 However, most convertible bonds remain junior to other long-term
debt and bank loans—so, in a bankruptcy, convertible holders do not have
priorclaim to the company’s assets. And, while they are not nearly as
dicey as high-yield “junk” bonds, many converts are still issued by
companies with less than sterling credit ratings. Finally, a large
portion of the convertible market is held by hedge funds, whose
rapid-fire trading can increase the volatility of prices.</p>
<p>4 For more detail, see www.fidelity.com, www.vanguard.com, and www.
morningstar.com. The intelligent investor will never buy a convertible
bond fund with annual operating expenses exceeding 1.0%.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How “shocked” was the financial world by the Penn Central’s
bankruptcy, which was filed over the weekend of June 20–21, 1970? The
closing trade in Penn Central’s stock on Friday, June 19, was 1.25 per
share—hardly a going-out-of-business price. In more recent times, stocks
like Enron and WorldCom have also sold at relatively high prices shortly
before filing for bankruptcy protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Penn Central was the product of the merger, announced in 1966, of
the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This kind of accounting legerdemain, in which profits are reported
as if “unusual” or “extraordinary” or “nonrecurring” charges do not
matter, anticipates the reliance on “pro forma” financial statements
that became popular in the late 1990s (see the commentary on Chapter
12).</p>
<ul>
<li>A railroad’s “transportation ratio” (now more commonly called its
operating ratio) measures the expenses of running its trains divided by
the railroad’s total revenues. The higher the ratio, the less efficient
the railroad. Today even a ratio of 70% would be considered
excellent.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Today, Penn Central is a faded memory. In 1976, it was absorbed
into Consolidated Rail Corp. (Conrail), a federally-funded holding
company that bailed out several failed railroads. Conrail sold shares to
the public in 1987 and, in 1997, was taken over jointly by CSX Corp. and
Norfolk Southern Corp.</p>
<p>† Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. was founded in 1955 by James Joseph Ling,
anelectrical contractor who sold his first million worth of shares to
the public by becoming his own investment banker, hawking prospectuses
from a booth set up at the Texas State Fair. His success at that led him
to acquire dozens of different companies, almost always using LTV’s
stock to pay for them. The more companies LTV acquired, the higher its
stock went; the higher its stock went, the more companies it could
afford to acquire. By 1969, LTV was the 14th biggest firm on the Fortune
500 list of major U.S. corporations. And then, as Graham shows, the
whole house of cards came crashing down. (LTV Corp., now exclusively a
steelmaker, ended up seeking bankruptcy protection in late 2000.)
Companies that grow primarily through acquisitions are called “serial
acquirers”—and the similarity to the term “serial killers” is no
accident. As the case of LTV demonstrates, serial acquirers nearly
always leave financial death and destruction in their wake. Investors
who understood this lesson of Graham’s would have avoided such darlings
of the 1990s as Conseco, Tyco, and WorldCom.</p>
<ul>
<li>The sordid tradition of hiding a company’s true earnings picture
under the cloak of restructuring charges is still with us. Piling up
every possible charge in one year is sometimes called “big bath” or
“kitchen sink” accounting. This bookkeeping gimmick enables companies to
make an easy show of apparent growth in the following year—but investors
should not mistake that for real business health.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The “bond-discount asset” appears to mean that LTV had purchased
some bonds below their par value and was treating that discount as an
asset, on the grounds that the bonds could eventually be sold at par.
Graham scoffs at this, since there is rarely any way to know what a
bond’s market price will be on a given date in the future. If the bonds
could be sold only at values below par, this “asset” would in fact be a
liability.</p>
<p>† We can only imagine what Graham would have thought of the
investment banking firms that brought InfoSpace, Inc. public in December
1998. The stock (adjusted for later splits) opened for trading at 1.25,
peaked at 305.32 per share in March 2000, and finished 2002 at a
princely .45 per share.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham would have been disappointed, though surely not surprised,
to see that commercial banks have chronically kept supporting “unsound
expansions.” Enron and WorldCom, two of the biggest collapses in
corporate history, were aided and abetted by billions of dollars in bank
loans.</p></li>
<li><p>In June 1972 (just after Graham finished this chapter), a Federal
judge found that NVF’s chairman, Victor Posner, had improperly diverted
the pension assets of Sharon Steel “to assist affiliated companies in
their takeovers of other corporations.” In 1977, the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission secured a permanent injunction against Posner, NVF,
and Sharon Steel to prevent them from future violations of Federal laws
against securities fraud. The Commission alleged that Posner and his
family had improperly obtained .7 million in personal perks from NVF and
Sharon, overstated Sharon’s pretax earnings by 3.9 million, misrecorded
inventory, and “shifted income and expenses from one year to another.”
Sharon Steel, which Graham had singled out with his cold and skeptical
eye, became known among Wall Street wags as “Share and Steal.” Posner
was later a central force in the wave of leveraged buyouts and hostile
takeovers that swept the United States in the 1980s, as he became a
major customer for the junk bonds underwritten by Drexel Burnham
Lambert.</p></li>
<li><p>The “large dilution factor” would be triggered when NVF employees
exercised their warrants to buy common stock. The company would then
have to issue more shares, and its net earnings would be divided across
a much greater number of shares outstanding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Jackie G. Williams founded AAA Enterprises in 1958. On its first
day of trading, the stock soared 56% to close at 0.25. Williams later
announced that AAA would come up with a new franchising concept every
month (if people would step into a mobile home to get their income taxes
done by “Mr. Tax of America,” just imagine what else they might do
inside a trailer!). But AAA ran out of time and money before Williams
ran out of ideas. The history of AAA Enterprises is reminiscent of the
saga of a later company with charismatic management and scanty assets:
ZZZZ Best achieved a stock-market value of roughly 00 million in the
late 1980s, even though its purported industrial vacuum-cleaning
business was little more than a telephone and a rented office run by a
teenager named Barry Minkow. ZZZZ Best went bust and Minkow went to
jail. Even as you read this, another similar company is being formed,
and a new generation of “investors” will be taken for a ride. No one who
has read Graham, however, should climb on board.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In “Abou Ben Adhem,” by the British Romantic poet Leigh Hunt
(1784–1859), a righteous Muslim sees an angel writing in a golden book
“the names of those who love the Lord.” When the angel tells Abou that
his name is not among them, Abou says, “I pray thee, then, write me as
one that loves his fellow men.” The angel returns the next night to show
Abou the book, in which now “Ben Adhem’s name led all the
rest.”</p></li>
<li><p>By purchasing more common stock at a premium to its book value,
the investing public increased the value of AAA’s equity per share. But
investors were only pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps, since
most of the rise in shareholders’ equity came from the public’s own
willingness to over-pay for the stock.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham’s point is that investment banks are not entitled to take
credit for the gains a hot stock may produce right after its initial
public offering unless they are also willing to take the blame for the
stock’s performance in the longer term. Many Internet IPOs rose 1,000%
or more in 1999 and early 2000; most of them lost more than 95% in the
subsequent three years. How could these early gains earned by a few
investors justify the massive destruction of wealth suffered by the
millions who came later? Many IPOs were, in fact, deliberately
underpriced to “manufacture” immediate gains that would attract more
attention for the next offering.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first four sentences of Graham’s paragraph could read as the
official epitaph of the Internet and telecommunications bubble that
burst in early 2000. Just as the Surgeon General’s warning on the side
of a cigarette pack does not stop everyone from lighting up, no
regulatory reform will ever prevent investors from overdosing on their
own greed. (Not even Communism can outlaw market bubbles; the Chinese
stock market shot up 101.7% in the first half of 1999, then crashed.)
Nor can investment banks ever be entirely cleansed of their own
compulsion to sell any stock at any price the market will bear. The
circle can only be broken one investor, and one financial adviser, at a
time. Mastering Graham’s principles (see especially Chapters 1, 8, and
20) is the best way to start.</li>

<p>3 When accounting for acquisitions, loading up on WOOPIPRAD enabled
Tyco to reduce the portion of the purchase price that it allocated to
goodwill. Since WOOPIPRAD can be expensed up front, while goodwill
(under the accounting rules then in force) had to be written off over
multi-year periods, this maneuver enabled Tyco to minimize the impact of
goodwill charges on its future earnings.</p>
<p>4 In 2002, Tyco’s former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, was
charged by state and Federal legal authorities with income tax fraud and
improperly diverting Tyco’s corporate assets for his own use, including
the appropriation of 5,000 for an umbrella stand and ,000 for a shower
curtain. Kozlowski denied all charges.</p>
<p>5 Disclosure: Jason Zweig is an employee of Time Inc., formerly a

<p>1 eToys’ prospectus had a gatefold cover featuring an original
cartoon of Arthur the aardvark, showing in comic style how much easier
it would be to buy tchotchkes for children at eToys than at a
traditional toy store. As analyst Gail Bronson of IPO Monitor told the
Associated Press on the day of eToys’ stock offering, “eToys has very,
very smartly managed the development of the company last year and
positioned themselves to be the children’s center of the Internet.”
Added Bronson: “The key to a successful IPO, especially a dot-com IPO,
is good marketing and branding.” Bronson was partly right: That’s the
key to a successful IPO for the issuing company and its bankers.
Unfortunately, for investors the key to a successful IPO is earnings,
which eToys didn’t have.</p>
<ul>
<li>Here Graham is describing Real Estate Investment Trust, which was
acquired by San Francisco Real Estate Investors in 1983 for 0 a share.
The next paragraph describes Realty Equities Corp. of New York.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The actor Paul Newman was briefly a major shareholder in Realty
Equities Corp. of New York after it bought his movie-production company,
Kayos, Inc., in 1969.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham, an avid reader of poetry, is quoting Thomas Gray’s “Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard.”</p></li>
<li><p>Realty Equities was delisted from the American Stock Exchange in
September 1973. In 1974, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued Realty Equities’ accountants for fraud. Realty Equities’ founder,
Morris Karp, later pleaded guilty to one count of grand larceny. In
1974–1975, the overindebtedness that Graham criticizes led to a
financial crisis among large banks, including Chase Manhattan, that had
lent heavily to the most aggressive realty trusts.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† “Heteroclite” is a technical term from classical Greek that Graham
uses to mean abnormal or unusual.</p>
<ul>
<li>By “volume,” Graham is referring to sales or revenues—the total
dollar amount of each company’s business.</li>
</ul>
<p>† “Asset backing” and book value are synonyms. In Table 18-2, the
relationship of price to asset or book value can be seen by dividing the
first line (“Price, December 31, 1969”) by “Book value per share.”</p>
<p>† †Graham is citing his research on value stocks, which he discusses
in Chapter 15 (see p. 389). Since Graham completed his studies, a vast
body of scholarly work has confirmed that value stocks outperform growth
stocks over long periods. (Much of the best research in modern finance
simply provides independent confirmation of what Graham demonstrated
decades ago.) See, for instance, James L. Davis, Eugene F. Fama, and
Kenneth R. French, “Characteristics, Covariances, and Average Returns:
1929–1997,” at http://papers.ssrn.com.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., still exists as a publicly-traded
stock and is included in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock
index. Air Reduction Co. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The BOC
Group (then known as British Oxygen) in 1978.</li>
</ul>
<p>† You can determine profitability, as measured by return on sales and
return on capital, by referring to the “Ratios” section of Table 18-3.
“Net/sales” measures return on sales; “Earnings/book value” measures
return on capital.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>American Home Products Co. is now known as Wyeth; the stock is
included in the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. American
Hospital Supply Co. was acquired by Baxter Healthcare Corp. in
1985.</p></li>
<li><p>“Nearly 30 times” is reflected in the entry of 2920% under
“Price/book value” in the Ratios section of Table 18-4. Graham would
have shaken his head in astonishment during late 1999 and early 2000,
when many high-tech companies sold for hundreds of times their asset
value (see the commentary on this chapter). Talk about “almost unheard
of in the annals of serious stock-market valuations”! H andandandand R
Block remains a publicly-traded company, while Blue Bell was taken
private in 1984 at 7.50 per share.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is alerting readers to a form of the “gambler’s fallacy,”
in which investors believe that an overvalued stock must drop in price
purely because it is overvalued. Just as a coin does not become more
likely to turn up heads after landing on tails for nine times in a row,
so an overvalued stock (or stock market!) can stay overvalued for a
surprisingly long time. That makes short-selling, or betting that stocks
will drop, too risky for mere mortals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† International Harvester was the heir to McCormick Harvesting
Machine Co., the manufacturer of the McCormick reaper that helped make
the midwestern states the “breadbasket of the world.” But International
Harvester fell on hard times in the 1970s and, in 1985, sold its
farm-equipment business to Tenneco. After changing its name to Navistar,
the remaining company was booted from the Dow in 1991 (although it
remains a member of the S andandandand P 500 index). International
Flavors andandandand Fragrances, also a constituent of the S
andandandand P 500, had a total stock-market value of billion in early
2003, versus .6 billion for Navistar.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For more of Graham’s thoughts on shareholder activism, see the
commentary on Chapter 19. In criticizing Harvester for its refusal to
maximize shareholder value, Graham uncannily anticipated the behavior of
the company’s future management. In 2001, a majority of shareholders
voted to remove Navistar’s restrictions against outside takeover
bids—but the board of directors simply refused to implement the
shareholders’ wishes. It’s remarkable that an antidemocratic tendency in
the culture of some companies can endure for decades.</p></li>
<li><p>McGraw-Hill remains a publicly-traded company that owns, among
other operations, BusinessWeek magazine and Standard andandandand Poor’s
Corp. McGraw–Edison is now a division of Cooper Industries.</p></li>
<li><p>In “the May 1970 debacle” that Graham refers to, the U.S. stock
market lost 5.5%. From the end of March to the end of June 1970, the S
andandandand P 500 index lost 19% of its value, one of the worst
three-month returns on record.</p></li>
<li><p>National Presto remains a publicly-traded company. National
General was acquired in 1974 by another controversial conglomerate,
American Financial Group, which at various times has had interests in
cable television, banking, real estate, mutual funds, insurance, and
bananas. AFG is also the final resting place of some of the assets of
Penn Central Corp. (see Chapter 17).</p></li>
<li><p>Whiting Corp. ended up a subsidiary of Wheelabrator-Frye, but was
taken private in 1983. Willcox andandandand Gibbs is now owned by Group
Rexel, an electrical-equipment manufacturer that is a division of
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute Group of France. Rexel’s shares trade on the
Paris Stock Exchange.</p></li>

<p>1 Ask yourself which company’s stock would be likely to rise more:
one that discovered a cure for a rare cancer, or one that discovered a
new way to dispose of a common kind of garbage. The cancer cure sounds
more exciting to most investors, but a new way to get rid of trash would
probably make more money. See Paul Slovic, Melissa Finucane, Ellen

revised edition appeared, and the 1970s and early 1980s marked the
absolute low point of modern American industrial efficiency. Cars were
“lemons,” televisions and radios were constantly “on the fritz,” and the
managers of many publicly-traded companies ignored both the present
interests of their outside shareholders and the future prospects of
their own businesses. All of this began to change in 1984, when
independent oilman T. Boone Pickens launched a hostile takeover bid for
Gulf Oil. Soon, fueled by junk-bond financing provided by Drexel Burnham
Lambert, “corporate raiders” stalked the landscape of corporate America,
scaring long-sclerotic companies into a new regimen of efficiency. While
many of the companies involved in buy-outs and takeovers were ravaged,
the rest of American business emerged both leaner (which was good) and
meaner (which sometimes was not).</p></li>
<li><p>The irony that Graham describes here grew even stronger in the
1990s, when it almost seemed that the stronger the company was, the less
likely it was to pay a dividend—or for its shareholders to want one. The
“payout ratio” (or the percentage of their net income that companies
paid out as dividends) dropped from “60% to 75%” in Graham’s day to 35%
to 40% by the end of the 1990s.</p></li>
<li><p>In the late 1990s, technology companies were particularly strong
advocates of the view that all of their earnings should be “plowed back
into the business,” where they could earn higher returns than any
outside shareholder possibly could by reinvesting the same cash if it
were paid out to him or her in dividends. Incredibly, investors never
questioned the truth of this patronizing Daddy-Knows-Best principle—or
even realized that a company’s cash belongs to the shareholders, not its
managers. See the commentary on this chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>Superior Oil’s stock price peaked at 165 per share in 1959, when
it paid a dividend. For many years, Superior was the highest-priced
stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Superior, controlled by the
Keck family of Houston, was acquired by Mobil Corp. in 1984.</p></li>
<li><p>Today, virtually all stock splits are carried out by a change in
value. In a two-for-one split, one share becomes two, each trading at
half the former price of the original single share; in a three-for-one
split, one share becomes three, each trading at a third of the former
price; and so on. Only in very rare cases is a sum transferred “from
earned surplus to capital account,” as in Graham’s day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Rule 703 of the New York Stock Exchange governs stock splits and
stock dividends. The NYSE now designates stock dividends of greater than
25% and less than 100% as “partial stock splits.” Unlike in Graham’s
day, these stock dividends may now trigger the NYSE’s accounting
requirement that the amount of the dividend be capitalized from retained
earnings.</p>
<ul>
<li>This policy, already unusual in Graham’s day, is extremely rare
today. In 1936 and again in 1950, roughly half of all stocks on the NYSE
paid a so-called special dividend. By 1970, however, that percentage had
declined to less than 10% and, by the 1990s, was well under 5%. See
Harry DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Special
Dividends and the Evolution of Dividend Signaling,” Journal of Financial
Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September, 2000, pp. 309–354. The most
plausible explanation for this decline is that corporate managers became
uncomfortable with the idea that shareholders might interpret special
dividends as a signal that future profits might be low.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The academic criticism of dividends was led by Merton Miller and
Franco Modigliani, whose influential article “Dividend Policy, Growth,
and the Valuation of Shares” (1961) helped win them Nobel Prizes in
Economics. Miller and Modigliani argued, in essence, that dividends were
irrelevant, since an investor should not care whether his return comes
through dividends and a rising stock price, or through a rising stock
price alone, so long as the total return is the same in either case.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham’s argument is no longer valid, and today’s investors can
safely skip over this passage. Shareholders no longer need to worry
about “having to break up” a stock certificate, since virtually all
shares now exist in electronic rather than paper form. And when Graham
says that a 5% increase in a cash dividend on 100 shares is less
“probable” than a constant dividend on 105 shares, it’s unclear how he
could even calculate that probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Subscription rights, often simply known as “rights,” are used less
frequently than in Graham’s day. They confer upon an existing
shareholder the right to buy new shares, sometimes at a discount to
market price. A shareholder who does not participate will end up owning
proportionately less of the company. Thus, as is the case with so many
other things that go by the name of “rights,” some coercion is often
involved. Rights are most common today among closed-end funds and
insurance or other holding companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>The administration of President George W. Bush made progress in
early 2003 toward reducing the problem of double-taxation of corporate
dividends, although it is too soon to know how helpful any final laws in
this area will turn out to be. A cleaner approach would be to make
dividend payments tax-deductible to the corporation, but that is not
part of the proposed legislation.</li>

<p>1 Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor (Harper andandandand Row,
New York,1949), pp. 217, 219, 240. Graham explains his reference to
Jesus this way: “In at least four parables in the Gospels there is
reference to a highly critical relationship between a man of wealth and
those he puts in charge of his property. Most to the point are the words
that “a certain rich man” speaks to his steward or manager, who is
accused of wasting his goods: ‘Give an account of thy stewardship, for
thou mayest be no longer steward.’ (Luke, 16:2).” Among the other
parables Graham seems to have in mind is Matt., 25:15–28.</p>
<p>2 Benjamin Graham, “A Questionnaire on Stockholder-Management
Relationship,” The Analysts Journal, Fourth Quarter, 1947, p. 62. Graham
points out that he had conducted a survey of nearly 600 professional
security analysts and found that more than 95% of them believed that
shareholders have the right to call for a formal investigation of
managers whose leadership does not enhance the value of the stock.
Graham adds dryly that “such action is almost unheard of in practice.”
This, he says, “highlights the wide gulf between what should happen and
what does happen in shareholder-management relationships.”</p>

<p>4 The Intelligent Investor, 1949 edition, p. 218.</p>
<p>5 1949 edition, p. 223. Graham adds that a proxy vote would be
necessary to authorize an independent committee of outside shareholders
to select “the engineering firm” that would submit its report to the
shareholders, not to the board of directors. However, the company would
bear the costs of this project. Among the kinds of “engineering firms”
Graham had in mind were money managers, rating agencies and
organizations of security analysts. Today, investors could choose from
among hundreds of consulting firms, restructuring advisers, and members
of entities like the Risk Management Association.</p>
<p>6 Tabulations of voting results for 2002 by Georgeson Shareholder and
ADP’s Investor Communication Services, two leading firms that mail proxy
solicitations to investors, suggest response rates that average around
80% to 88% (including proxies sent in by stockbrokers on behalf of their
clients, which are automatically voted in favor of management unless the
clients specify otherwise). Thus the owners of between 12% and 20% of
all shares are not voting their proxies. Since individuals own only 40%
of U.S. shares by market value, and most institutional investors like
pension funds and insurance companies are legally bound to vote on proxy
issues, that means that roughly a third of all individual investors are
neglecting to vote.</p>

Interestingly, the total dollar amount of dividends paid by U.S. stocks
has risen since the late 1970s, even after inflation—but the number of
stocks that pay a dividend has shrunk by nearly two-thirds. See Harry
DeAngelo, Linda DeAngelo, and Douglas J. Skinner, “Are Dividends

<p>10 Perhaps Benjamin Franklin, who is said to have carried his coins
around in an asbestos purse so that money wouldn’t burn a hole in his
pocket, could have avoided this problem if he had been a CEO.</p>
<p>11 A study by BusinessWeek found that from 1995 through 2001, 61% out
of more than 300 large mergers ended up destroying wealth for the
shareholders of the acquiring company—a condition known as “the winner’s
curse” or “buyer’s remorse.” And acquirers using stock rather than cash
to pay for the deal underperformed rival companies by 8%. (David Henry,
“Mergers: Why Most Big Deals Don’t Pay Off,” BusinessWeek, October 14,
2002, pp. 60–70.) A similar academic study found that acquisitions of
private companies and subsidiaries of public companies lead to positive
stock returns, but that acquisitions of entire public companies generate
losses for the winning bidder’s shareholders. (Kathleen Fuller, Jeffry
Netter, and Mike Stegemoller, “What Do Returns to Acquiring Firms Tell
Us?” The Journal of Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002,
pp. 1763–1793.)</p>
<p>12 With interest rates near record lows, such a mountain of cash
produces lousy returns if it just sits around. As Graham asserts, “So
long as this surplus cash remains with the company, the outside
stockholder gets little benefit from it” (1949 edition, p. 232). Indeed,
by year-end 2002, Microsoft’s cash balance had swollen to 3.4
billion—clear proof that the company could find no good use for the cash
its businesses were generating. As Graham would say, Microsoft’s
operations were efficient, but its finance no longer was. In a step
toward redressing this problem, Microsoft declared in early 2003 that it
would begin paying a regular quarterly dividend.</p>

Nissim-Ziv findings on future earnings agree that dividend increases
lead to higher future stock returns; see Shlomo Benartzi, Roni Michaely,
and Richard Thaler, “Do Changes in Dividends Signal the Future or the
Past?” The Journal of Finance, vol. 52, no. 3, July, 1997,
pp. 1007–1034.</p>
<p>15 The tax reforms proposed by President George W. Bush in early 2003
would change the taxability of dividends, but the fate of this
legislation was not yet clear by press time.</p>
<p>16 Historically, companies took a common-sense approach toward share
repurchases, reducing them when stock prices were high and stepping them
up when prices were low. After the stock market crash of October 19,
1987, for example, 400 companies announced new buybacks over the next 12
days alone—while only 107 firms had announced buyback programs in the
earlier part of the year, when stock prices had been much higher. See
Murali Jagannathan, Clifford P. Stephens, and Michael S. Weisbach,
“Financial Flexibility and the Choice Between Dividends and Stock
Repurchases,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 57, no. 3, September,
2000, p. 362.</p>
<p>17 The stock options granted by a company to its executives and
employees give them the right (but not the obligation) to buy shares in
the future at a discounted price. That conversion of options to shares
is called “exercising” the options. The employees can then sell the
shares at the current market price and pocket the difference as profit.
Because hundreds of millions of options may be exercised in a given
year, the company must increase its supply of shares outstanding. Then,
however, the company’s total net income would be spread across a much
greater number of shares, reducing its earnings per share. Therefore,
the company typically feels compelled to buy back other shares to cancel
out the stock issued to the option holders. In 1998, 63.5% of chief
financial officers admitted that counteracting the dilution from options
was a major reason for repurchasing shares (see CFO Forum, “The Buyback
Track,” Institutional Investor, July, 1998).</p>
<p>18 One of the main factors driving this change was the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission’s decision, in 1982, to relax its
previous restrictions on share repurchases. See Gustavo Grullon and Roni
Michaely, “Dividends, Share Repurchases, and the Substitution
Hypothesis,” The Journal of Finance, vol. 57, no. 4, August, 2002,
pp. 1649–1684.</p>
<p>19 Throughout his writings, Graham insists that corporate managements
have a duty not just to make sure their stock is not undervalued, but
also to make sure it never gets overvalued. As he put it in Security
Analysis (1934 ed., p. 515), “the responsibility of managements to act
in the interest of their shareholders includes the obligation to
prevent—in so far as they are able—the establishment of either absurdly
high or unduly low prices for their securities.” Thus, enhancing
shareholder value doesn’t just mean making sure that the stock price
does not go too low; it also means ensuring that the stock price does
not go up to unjustifiable levels. If only the executives of Internet
companies had heeded Graham’s wisdom back in 1999!</p>
<p>20 Incredibly, although options are considered a compensation expense
on a company’s tax returns, they are not counted as an expense on the
income statement in financial reports to shareholders. Investors can
only hope that accounting reforms will change this ludicrous
practice.</p>
<p>21 See George W. Fenn and Nellie Liang, “Corporate Payout Policy and
Managerial Stock Incentives,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 60,
no. 1, April, 2001, pp. 45–72. Dividends make stocks less volatile by
providing a stream of current income that cushions shareholders against
fluctuations in market value. Several researchers have found that the
average profitability of companies with stock-buyback programs (but no
cash dividends) is at least twice as volatile as that of companies that
pay dividends. Those more variable earnings will, in general, lead to
bouncier share prices, making the managers’ stock options more
valuable—by creating more opportunities when share prices will be
temporarily high. Today, about two-thirds of executive compensation
comes in the form of options and other noncash awards; thirty years ago,
at least two-thirds of compensation came as cash.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a
foundation or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had
spread to individual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994
edition of his influential book, Stocks for the Long Run, finance
professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School recommended that
“risk-taking” investors should buy on margin, borrowing more than a
third of their net worth to sink 135% of their assets into stocks. Even
government officials got in on the act: In February 1999, the Honorable
Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the audience at an
investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for anyone to have any
money in a bond fund.”</p></li>
<li><p>This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two
years after President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls,
inflation hit 8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The
decade from 1973 through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern
American history, as the cost of living more than doubled.</p></li>
<li><p>See p. 25.</p></li>
<li><p>John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence,
he was constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan
developed a mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will
fluctuate.” See Jean Strouse, Morgan: American Financier (Random House,
1999), p. 11.</p></li>
<li><p>The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham
was “dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at
least in the years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust
ability to out-pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein
agrees, pointing out that a tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund
(say, 2% of your total assets) is too small to hurt your overall returns
when gold does poorly. But, when gold does well, its returns are often
so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100% in a year—that it can, all by
itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glittering. However, the
intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its high
storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging
below 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total
financial assets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).</p></li>

<p>2 For a lively discussion of the “inflation is dead” scenario, see
www.pbs. org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html. In
1996, the Boskin Commission, a group of economists asked by the
government to investigate whether the official rate of inflation is
accurate, estimated that it has been overstated, often by nearly two
percentage points per year. For the commission’s report, see
www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html. Many investment experts now
feel that deflation, or falling prices, is an even greater threat than
inflation; the best way to hedge against that risk is by including bonds
as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the commentary on
Chapter 4.)</p>

<p>4 That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous “malaise” speech,
in which he warned of “a crisis in confidence” that “strikes at the very
heart and soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to
destroy the social and the political fabric of America.”</p>
<p>5 See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, “Modern
Hyper- and High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research,

<p>6 In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation.
During the American Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from
1777 through 1779, with a pound of butter costing 2 and a barrel of
flour fetching nearly ,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the
Civil War, inflation raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and
nearly 200% (in the Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit
18.1% in the United States.</p>
<p>7 I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this
cynical, but accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or
steadily falling prices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a
borrower—which is why most investors should keep at least a small
portion of their assets in bonds, as a form of insurance against
deflating prices.</p>
<p>8 When inflation is negative, it is technically termed “deflation.”
Regularly falling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think
of the Japanese example. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989,
with real estate and the stock market dropping in value year after
year—a relentless water torture for the world’s second-largest
economy.</p>

“inflation appears to have had a negative impact on both stock and bond
markets,” note Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton in Triumph of
the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns (Princeton

<li><p>“Earning power” is Graham’s term for a company’s potential
profits or, as he puts it, the amount that a firm “might be expected to
earn year after year if the business conditions prevailing during the
period were to continue unchanged” (Security Analysis, 1934 ed.,
p. 354). Some of his lectures make it clear that Graham intended the
term to cover periods of five years or more. You can crudely but
conveniently approximate a company’s earning power per share by taking
the inverse of its price/earnings ratio; a stock with a P/E ratio of 11
can be said to have earning power of 9% (or 1 divided by 11). Today
“earning power” is often called “earnings yield.”</p></li>
<li><p>This problem is discussed extensively in the commentary on
Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham elegantly summarized the discussion that follows in a
lecture he gave in 1972: “The margin of safety is the difference between
the percentage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay
for it and the rate of interest on bonds, and that margin of safety is
the difference which would absorb unsatisfactory developments. At the
time the 1965 edition of The Intelligent Investor was written the
typical stock was selling at 11 times earnings, giving about 9% return
as against 4% on bonds. In that case you had a margin of safety of over
100 per cent. Now 〔in 1972〕 there is no difference between the
earnings rate on stocks and the interest rate on stocks, and I say there
is no margin of safety…you have a negative margin of safety on stocks…”
See “Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” 〔transcript of
lecture at the Northeast Missouri State University business school,
March, 1972〕, Financial History, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 9.</p></li>
<li><p>This paragraph—which Graham wrote in early 1972—is an uncannily
precise description of market conditions in early 2003. (For more
detail, see the commentary on Chapter 3.)</p></li>
<li><p>In “American” roulette, most wheels include 0 and 00 along with
numbers 1 through 36, for a total of 38 slots. The casino offers a
maximum payout of 35 to 1. What if you bet on every number? Since only
one slot can be the one into which the ball drops, you would win 5 on
that slot, but lose on each of your other 37 slots, for a net loss of .
That difference (or a 5.26% spread on your total 8 bet) is the casino’s
“house advantage,” ensuring that, on average, roulette players will
always lose more than they win. Just as it is in the roulette player’s
interest to bet as seldom as possible, it is in the casino’s interest to
keep the roulette wheel spinning. Likewise, the intelligent investor
should seek to maximize the number of holdings that offer “a better
chance for profit than for loss.” For most investors, diversification is
the simplest and cheapest way to widen your margin of safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham is saying that there is no such thing as a good or bad
stock; there are only cheap stocks and expensive stocks. Even the best
company becomes a “sell” when its stock price goes too high, while the
worst company is worth buying if its stock goes low enough.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† The very people who considered technology and telecommunications
stocks a “sure thing” in late 1999 and early 2000, when they were
hellishly overpriced, shunned them as “too risky” in 2002—even though,
in Graham’s exact words from an earlier period, “the price depreciation
of about 90% made many of these securities exceedingly attractive and
reasonably safe.” Similarly, Wall Street’s analysts have always tended
to call a stock a “strong buy” when its price is high, and to label it a
“sell” after its price has fallen—the exact opposite of what Graham (and
simple common sense) would dictate. As he does throughout the book,
Graham is distinguishing speculation—or buying on the hope that a
stock’s price will keep going up—from investing, or buying on the basis
of what the underlying business is worth.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham uses “common-stock option warrant” as a synonym for
“warrant,” a security issued directly by a corporation giving the holder
a right to purchase the company’s stock at a predetermined price.
Warrants have been almost entirely superseded by stock options. Graham
quips that he intends the example as a “shocker” because, even in his
day, warrants were regarded as one of the market’s seediest backwaters.

<p>† The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like
the S andandandand P 500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the
market’s temperature. If, for instance, a company earned per share of
net income over the past year, and its stock is selling at .93 per
share, its price/earnings ratio would be 8.93; if, however, the stock is
selling at 9.70, then the price/earnings ratio would be 69.7. In
general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is considered
low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater than 20 is
considered expensive. (For more on P/E ratios, see p. 168.)</p>
<p>1 If dividends are not included, stocks fell 47.8% in those two
years.</p>
<p>1 By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of
seven financial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly
unrepresentative sample of the rambunctious young American stock
market.</p>
<p>2 See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time, May 6,
2002, p. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between
1871 and the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds
of automobile, aviation, and radio companies that went bust without a
trace. These returns, too, are probably overstated by one to two
percentage points.</p>
<p>2 Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’
expectation of a 7% stock return will be realized.</p>

widespread availability of mutual funds that spread the risk and do the
research of owning “junk bonds.” See the commentary on Chapter 6 for

<p>† † The “New Housing” bonds and “New Community debentures” are no
more. New Housing Authority bonds were backed by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and were exempt from income tax, but
they have not been issued since 1974. New Community debentures, also
backed by HUD, were authorized by a Federal law passed in 1968. About 50
million of these debentures were issued through 1975, but the program
was terminated in 1983.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A bond’s “coupon” is its interest rate; a “low-coupon” bond pays
a rate of interest income below the market average.</p></li>
<li><p>While Graham’s logic remains valid, the numbers have changed.
Corporations can currently deduct 70% of the income they receive from
dividends, and the standard corporate tax rate is 35%. Thus, a
corporation would pay roughly 4.50 in tax on 00 in dividends from
preferred stock versus 5 in tax on 00 in interest income. Individuals
pay the same rate of income tax on dividend income that they do on
interest income, so preferred stock offers them no tax
advantage.</p></li>

after-tax income of municipal and taxable bonds can be found at
www.investinginbonds. com/cgi-bin/calculator.pl and
www.lebenthal.com/index_infocenter.html. To decide if a “muni” is right
for you, find the “taxable equivalent yield” generated by these
calculators, then compare that number to the yield currently available
on Treasury bonds (http://money.cnn.com/markets/bondcenter/ or
www.bloomberg.com/markets/C13.html). If the yield on Treasury bonds is
higher than the taxable equivalent yield, munis are not for you. In any
case, be warned that municipal bonds and funds produce lower income, and
more price fluctuation, than most taxable bonds. Also, the alternative
minimum tax, which now hits many middle-income Americans, can negate the
advantages of municipal bonds.</p>

<p>11 In general, variable annuities are not attractive for investors
under the age of 50 who expect to be in a high tax bracket during
retirement or who have not already contributed the maximum to their
existing 401(k) or IRA accounts. Fixed annuities (with the notable
exception of those from TIAA-CREF) can change their “guaranteed” rates
and smack you with nasty surrender fees. For thorough and objective
analysis of annuities, see two superb articles by Walter Updegrave:

<ul>
<li>At the beginning of 1949, the average annual return produced by
stocks over the previous 20 years was 3.1%, versus 3.9% for long-term
Treasury bonds—meaning that 0,000 invested in stocks would have grown to
8,415 over that period, while the same amount in bonds would have turned
into 1,494. Naturally enough, 1949 turned out to be a fabulous time to
buy stocks: Over the next decade, the Standard andandandand Poor’s
500-stock index gained an average of 20.1% per year, one of the best
long-term returns in the history of the U.S. stock market.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Graham’s earlier comments on this subject appear on pp. 19–20. Just
imagine what he would have thought about the stock market of the late
1990s, in which each new record-setting high was considered further
“proof” that stocks were the riskless way to wealth!</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a then-record high of
381.17 on September 3, 1929. It did not close above that level until
November 23, 1954—more than a quarter of a century later—when it hit
382.74. (When you say you intend to own stocks “for the long run,” do
you realize just how long the long run can be—or that many investors who
bought in 1929 were no longer even alive by 1954?) However, for patient
investors who reinvested their income, stock returns were positive over
this otherwise dismal period, simply because dividend yields averaged
more than 5.6% per year. According to professors Elroy Dimson, Paul
Marsh, and Mike Staunton of London Business School, if you had invested
in U.S. stocks in 1900 and spent all your dividends, your stock
portfolio would have grown to 98 by 2000. But if you had reinvested all
your dividends, your stock portfolio would have been worth 6,797! Far
from being an afterthought, dividends are the greatest force in stock
investing.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Why do the “high prices” of stocks affect their dividend yields? A
stock’s yield is the ratio of its cash dividend to the price of one
share of common stock. If a company pays a annual dividend when its
stock price is 00 per share, its yield is 2%. But if the stock price
doubles while the dividend stays constant, the dividend yield will drop
to 1%. In 1959, when the trend Graham spotted in 1957 became noticeable
to everyone, most Wall Street pundits declared that it could not
possibly last. Never before had stocks yielded less than bonds; after
all, since stocks are riskier than bonds, why would anyone buy them at
all unless they pay extra dividend income to compensate for their
greater risk? The experts argued that bonds would outyield stocks for a
few months at most, and then things would revert to “normal.” More than
four decades later, the relationship has never been normal again; the
yield on stocks has (so far) continuously stayed below the yield on
bonds.</p>
<ul>
<li>See pp. 56–57 and 88–89.</li>
</ul>
<p>† For another view of diversification, see the sidebar in the
commentary on Chapter 14 (p. 368).</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s defensive investor should probably insist on at least 10
years of continuous dividend payments (which would eliminate from
consideration only one member of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average—Microsoft—and would still leave at least 317 stocks to choose
from among the S andandandand P 500 index). Even insisting on 20 years
of uninterrupted dividend payments would not be overly restrictive;
according to Morgan Stanley, 255 companies in the S andandandand P 500
met that standard as of year-end 2002.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The “Rule of 72” is a handy mental tool. To estimate the length of
time an amount of money takes to double, simply divide its assumed
growth rate into 72. At 6%, for instance, money will double in 12 years
(72 divided by 6 = 12). At the 7.1% rate cited by Graham, a growth stock
will double its earnings in just over 10 years (72/7.1 = 10.1
years).</p>
<ul>
<li>Graham makes this point on p. 73.</li>
</ul>
<p>† To show that Graham’s observations are perennially true, we can
substitute Microsoft for IBM and Cisco for Texas Instruments. Thirty
years apart, the results are uncannily similar: Microsoft’s stock
dropped 55.7% from 2000 through 2002, while Cisco’s stock—which had
risen roughly 50-fold over the previous six years—lost 76% of its value
from 2000 through 2002. As with Texas Instruments, the drop in Cisco’s
stock price was sharper than the fall in its earnings, which dropped
just 39.2% (comparing the three-year average for 1997–1999 against
2000–2002). As always, the hotter they are, the harder they fall.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Earnings multiplier” is a synonym for P/E or price/earnings ratios,
which measure how much investors are willing to pay for a stock compared
to the profitability of the underlying business. (See footnote † on
p. 70 in Chapter 3.)</li>

<p>† Investors can now set up their own automated system to monitor the
quality of their holdings by using interactive “portfolio trackers” at
such websites as www.quicken.com, moneycentral.msn.com,
finance.yahoo.com, and www.morningstar.com. Graham would, however, warn
against relying exclusively on such a system; you must use your own
judgment to supplement the software.</p>

New York Stock Exchange–listed stock dropped from about 1.25% in

those costs are actually higher. (See Charles M. Jones, “A Century of

<ul>
<li><p>Here Graham has made a slip of the tongue. After insisting in
Chapter 1 that the definition of an “enterprising” investor depends not
on the amount of risk you seek, but the amount of work you are willing
to put in, Graham falls back on the conventional notion that
enterprising investors are more “aggressive.” The rest of the chapter,
however, makes clear that Graham stands by his original definition. (The
great British economist John Maynard Keynes appears to have been the
first to use the term “enterprise” as a synonym for analytical
investment.)</p></li>
<li><p>“High-coupon issues” are corporate bonds paying above-average
interest rates (in today’s markets, at least 8%) or preferred stocks
paying large dividend yields (10% or more). If a company must pay high
rates of interest in order to borrow money, that is a fundamental signal
that it is risky. For more on high-yield or “junk” bonds, see
pp. 145–147.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† As of early 2003, the equivalent yields are roughly 5.1% on
high-grade corporate bonds and 4.7% on 20-year tax-free municipal bonds.
To update these yields, see www.bondsonline.com/asp/news/composites/html
or www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates.html and www.bloomberg.com/markets/

<ul>
<li><p>For a recent example that painfully reinforces Graham’s point,
see p. 146 below.</p></li>
<li><p>Bond prices are quoted in percentages of “par value,” or 100. A
bond priced at “85” is selling at 85% of its principal value; a bond
originally offered for 0,000, but now selling at 85, will cost ,500.
When bonds sell below 100, they are called “discount” bonds; above 100,
they become “premium” bonds.</p></li>
<li><p>New issues of common stock—initial public offerings or
IPOs—normally are sold with an “underwriting discount” (a built-in
commission) of 7%. By contrast, the buyer’s commission on older shares
of common stock typically ranges below 4%. Whenever Wall Street makes
roughly twice as much for selling something new as it does for selling
something old, the new will get the harder sell.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Recently, finance professors Owen Lamont of the University of
Chicago and Paul Schultz of the University of Notre Dame have shown that
corporations choose to offer new shares to the public when the stock
market is near a peak. For technical discussion of these issues, see
Lamont’s “Evaluating Value Weighting: Corporate Events and Market
Timing” and Schultz’s “Pseudo Market Timing and the Long-Run Performance
of IPOs” at http:// papers.ssrn.com.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the two years from June 1960, through May 1962, more than 850
companies sold their stock to the public for the first time—an average
of more than one per day. In late 1967 the IPO market heated up again;
in 1969 an astonishing 781 new stocks were born. That oversupply helped
create the bear markets of 1969 and 1973–1974. In 1974 the IPO market
was so dead that only nine new stocks were created all year; 1975 saw
only 14 stocks born. That undersupply, in turn, helped feed the bull
market of the 1980s, whenroughly 4,000 new stocks flooded the
market—helping to trigger the over-enthusiasm that led to the 1987
crash. Then the cycle swung the other way again as IPOs dried up in
1988–1990. That shortage contributed to the bull market of the
1990s—and, right on cue, Wall Street got back into the business of
creating new stocks, cranking out nearly 5,000 IPOs. Then, after the
bubble burst in 2000, only 88 IPOs were issued in 2001—the lowest annual
total since 1979. In every case, the public has gotten burned on IPOs,
has stayed away for at least two years, but has always returned for
another scalding. For as long as stock markets have existed, investors
have gone through this manic-depressive cycle. In America’s first great
IPO boom, back in 1825, a man was said to have been squeezed to death in
the stampede of speculators trying to buy shares in the new Bank of
Southwark; the wealthiest buyers hired thugs to punch their way to the
front of the line. Sure enough, by 1829, stocks had lost roughly 25% of
their value.</p></li>
<li><p>Here Graham is describing rights offerings, in which investors
who already own a stock are asked to pony up even more money to maintain
the same proportional interest in the company. This form of financing,
still widespread in Europe, has become rare in the United States, except
among closed-end funds.</p></li>
<li><p>In Graham’s day, the most prestigious investment banks generally
steeredclear of the IPO business, which was regarded as an undignified
exploitation of naïve investors. By the peak of the IPO boom in late
1999 and early 2000, however, Wall Street’s biggest investment banks had
jumped in with both feet. Venerable firms cast off their traditional
prudence and behaved like drunken mud wrestlers, scrambling to foist
ludicrously overvalued stocks on a desperately eager public. Graham’s
description of how the IPO process works is a classic that should be
required reading in investment-banking ethics classes, if there are
any.</p></li>

<p>† Today these “lower-quality bonds” in the “special situation” area
are known as distressed or defaulted bonds. When a company is in
approaching) bankruptcy, its common stock becomes essentially worthless,
since U.S. bankruptcy law entitles bondholders to a much stronger legal
claim than shareholders. But if the company reorganizes successfully and
comes out of bankruptcy, the bondholders often receive stock in the new
firm, and the value of the bonds usually recovers once the company is
able to pay interest again. Thus the bonds of a troubled company can
perform almost as well as the common stock of a healthy company. In
these special situations, as Graham puts it, “no true distinction exists
between bonds and common stocks.”(or</p>
<ul>
<li>Note very carefully what Graham is saying here. Writing in 1972, he
contends that the period since 1949—a stretch of more than 22 years—is
too short a period from which to draw reliable conclusions! With his
mastery of mathematics, Graham never forgets that objective conclusions
require very long samples of large amounts of data. The charlatans who
peddle “time-tested” stock-picking gimmicks almost always base their
findings on smaller samples than Graham would ever accept. (Graham often
used 50-year periods to analyze past data.)</li>
</ul>
<p>† Today, the enterprising investor can assemble such a list over the
Internet by visiting such websites as www.morningstar.com (try the Stock
Quickrank tool), www.quicken.com/investments/stocks/search/full, and
http://yahoo. marketguide.com.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Over the 10 years ending December 31, 2002, funds investing in
large growth companies—today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “growth
funds”—earned an annual average of 5.6%, underperforming the overall
stock market by an average of 3.7 percentage points per year. However,
“large value” funds investing in more reasonably priced big companies
also underperformed the market over the same period (by a full
percentage point per year). Is the problem merely that growth funds
cannot reliably select stocks that will outperform the market in the
future? Or is it that the high costs of running the average fund
(whether it buys growth or “value” companies) exceed any extra return
the managers can earn with their stock picks? To update fund performance
by type, see www.morningstar.com, “Category Returns.” For an
enlightening reminder of how perishable the performance of different
investment styles can be, see www.callan.com/resource/periodic_
table/pertable.pdf.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham makes this point to remind you that an “enterprising”
investor is not one who takes more risk than average or who buys
“aggressive growth” stocks; an enterprising investor is simply one who
is willing to put in extra time and effort in researching his or her
portfolio.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Notice that Graham insists on calculating the price/earnings ratio
based on a multiyear average of past earnings. That way, you lower the
odds that you will overestimate a company’s value based on a temporarily
high burst of profitability. Imagine that a company earned per share
over the past 12 months, but an average of only 50 cents per share over
the previous six years. Which number—the sudden or the steady 50
cents—is more likely to represent a sustainable trend? At 25 times the
it earned in the most recent year, the stock would be priced at 5. But
at 25 times the average earnings of the past seven years ( in total
earnings, divided by seven, equals 85.7 cents per share in average
annual earnings), the stock would be priced at only 1.43. Which number
you pick makes a big difference. Finally, it’s worth noting that the
prevailing method on Wall Street today—basing price/earnings ratios
primarily on “next year’s earnings”—would be anathema to Graham. How can
you value a company based on earnings it hasn’t even generated yet?
That’s like setting house prices based on a rumor that Cinderella will
be building her new castle right around the corner.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recent examples hammer Graham’s point home. On September 21,
2000, Intel Corp., the maker of computer chips, announced that it
expected its revenues to grow by up to 5% in the next quarter. At first
blush, that sounds great; most big companies would be delighted to
increase their sales by 5% in just three months. But in response,
Intel’s stock dropped 22%, a one-day loss of nearly 1 billion in total
value. Why? Wall Street’s analysts had expected Intel’s revenue to rise
by up to 10%. Similarly, on February 21, 2001, EMC Corp., a data-storage
firm, announced that it expected its revenues to grow by at least 25% in
2001—but that a new caution among customers “may lead to longer selling
cycles.” On that whiff of hesitation, EMC’s shares lost 12.8% of their
value in a single day.</p></li>
<li><p>Today’s equivalent of investors “who have a close relationship
with the particular company” are so-called control persons—senior
managers or directors who help run the company and own huge blocks of
stock. Executives like Bill Gates of Microsoft or Warren Buffett of
Berkshire Hathaway have direct control over a company’s destiny—and
outside investors want to see these chief executives maintain their
large shareholdings as a vote of confidence. But less-senior managers
and rank-and-file workers cannot influence the company’s share price
with their individual decisions; thus they should not put more than a
small percentage of their assets in their own employer’s stock. As for
outside investors, no matter how well they think they know the company,

<li><p>Among the steepest of the mountains recently made out of
molehills: In May 1998, Pfizer Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration announced that six men taking Pfizer’s anti-impotence
drug Viagra had died of heart attacks while having sex. Pfizer’s stock
immediately went flaccid, losing 3.4% in a single day on heavy trading.
But Pfizer’s shares surged ahead when research later showed that there
was no cause for alarm; the stock gained roughly a third over the next
two years. In late 1997, shares of Warner-Lambert Co. fell by 19% in a
day when sales of its new diabetes drug were temporarily halted in
England; within six months, the stock had nearly doubled. In late 2002,
Carnival Corp., which operates cruise ships, lost roughly 10% of its
value after tourists came down with severe diarrhea and vomiting—on
ships run by other companies.</p></li>
<li><p>By “net working capital,” Graham means a company’s current assets
(such as cash, marketable securities, and inventories) minus its total
liabilities (including preferred stock and long-term debt).</p></li>
<li><p>From 1975 through 1983, small (“secondary”) stocks outperformed
large stocks by an amazing average of 17.6 percentage points per year.
The investing public eagerly embraced small stocks, mutual fund
companies rolled out hundreds of new funds specializing in them, and
small stocks obliged by underperforming large stocks by five percentage
points per year over the next decade. The cycle recurred in 1999, when
small stocks beat big stocks by nearly nine percentage points, inspiring
investment bankers to sell hundreds of hot little high-tech stocks to
the public for the first time. Instead of “electronics,” “computers,” or
“franchise” in their names, the new buzzwords were “.com,” “optical,”
“wireless,” and even prefixes like “e-” and “I-.” Investing buzzwords
always turn into buzz saws, tearing apart anyone who believes in
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Defaulted railroad bonds do not offer significant opportunities
today. However, as already noted, distressed and defaulted junk bonds,
as well as convertible bonds issued by high-tech companies, may offer
real value in the wake of the 2000–2002 market crash. But
diversification in this area is essential—and impractical without at
least 00,000 to dedicate to distressed securities alone. Unless you are
a millionaire several times over, this kind of diversification is not an
option.</p></li>
<li><p>A classic recent example is Philip Morris, whose stock lost 23%
in two days after a Florida court authorized jurors to consider punitive
damages of up to 00 billion against the company—which had finally
admitted that cigarettes may cause cancer. Within a year, Philip
Morris’s stock had doubled—only to fall back after a later
multibillion-dollar judgment in Illinois. Several other stocks have been
virtually destroyed by liability lawsuits, including Johns Manville, W.
R. Grace, and USG Corp. Thus, “never buy into a lawsuit” remains a valid
rule for all but the most intrepid investors to live by.</p></li>

several people died after ingesting Tylenol that had been laced with
cyanide by an unknown outsider. Johnson andandandand Johnson responded
by pioneering the use of tamper-proof packaging, and the stock went on
to be one of the great investments of the 1980s.</p>

the Forbes 400, I am indebted to investment manager Kenneth Fisher
(himself a Forbes columnist).</p>
<p>11 In the late 1990s, the forecasts of “market strategists” became
more influential than ever before. They did not, unfortunately, become
more accurate. On March 10, 2000, the very day that the NASDAQ composite
index hit its all-time high of 5048.62, Prudential Securities’s chief
technical analyst Ralph Acampora said in USA Today that he expected
NASDAQ to hit 6000 within 12 to 18 months. Five weeks later, NASDAQ had
already shriveled to 3321.29—but Thomas Galvin, a market strategist at
Donaldson, Lufkin andandandand Jenrette, declared that “there’s only 200
or 300 points of downside for the NASDAQ and 2000 on the upside.” It
turned out that there were no points on the upside and more than 2000 on
the downside, as NASDAQ kept crashing until it finally scraped bottom on
October 9, 2002, at 1114.11. In March 2001, Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs andandandand Co., predicted that
the Standard andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index would close the year at
1,650 and that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would finish 2001 at
13,000. “We do not expect a recession,” said Cohen, “and believe that
corporate profits are likely to grow at close to trend growth rates
later this year.” The U.S. economy was sinking into recession even as
she spoke, and the S andandandand P 500 ended 2001 at 1148.08, while the
Dow finished at 10,021.50—30% and 23% below her forecasts,
respectively.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>See p. 3.</p></li>
<li><p>Without bear markets to take stock prices back down, anyone
waiting to “buy low” will feel completely left behind—and, all too
often, will end up abandoning any former caution and jumping in with
both feet. That’s why Graham’s message about the importance of emotional
discipline is so important. From October 1990 through January 2000, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average marched relentlessly upward, never losing
more than 20% and suffering a loss of 10% or more only three times. The
total gain (not counting dividends): 395.7%. According to Crandall,
Pierce andandandand Co., this was the second-longest uninterrupted bull
market of the past century; only the 1949–1961 boom lasted longer. The
longer a bull market lasts, the more severely investors will be
afflicted with amnesia; after five years or so, many people no longer
believe that bear markets are even possible. All those who forget are
doomed to be reminded; and, in the stock market, recovered memories are
always unpleasant.</p></li>
<li><p>Graham discusses this “recommended policy” in Chapter 4
(pp. 89–91). This policy, now called “tactical asset allocation,” is
widely followed by institutional investors like pension funds and
university endowments.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of these “formula planners” would have sold all their stocks
at the end of 1954, after the U.S. stock market rose 52.6%, the
second-highest yearly return then on record. Over the next five years,
these market-timers would likely have stood on the sidelines as stocks
doubled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Easy ways to make money in the stock market fade for two reasons:
the natural tendency of trends to reverse over time, or “regress to the
mean,” and the rapid adoption of the stock-picking scheme by large
numbers of people, who pile in and spoil all the fun of those who got
there first. (Note that, in referring to his “discomfiting experience,”
Graham is—as always—honest in admitting his own failures.) See Jason
Zweig, “Murphy Was an Investor,” Money, July, 2002, pp. 61–62, and Jason
Zweig, “New Year’s Play,” Money, December, 2000, pp. 89–90.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s equivalent of what Graham calls “second-line companies”
would be any of the thousands of stocks not included in the Standard
andandandand Poor’s 500-stock index. A regularly revised list of the 500
stocks in the S andandandand P index is available at
www.standardandpoors.com.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Note carefully what Graham is saying here. It is not just possible,
but probable, that most of the stocks you own will gain at least 50%
from their lowest price and lose at least 33% from their highest
price—regardless of which stocks you own or whether the market as a
whole goes up or down. If you can’t live with that—or you think your
portfolio is somehow magically exempt from it—then you are not yet
entitled to call yourself an investor. (Graham refers to a 33% decline
as the “equivalent one-third” because a 50% gain takes a 0 stock to 5.
From 5, a 33% loss 〔or drop〕 takes it right back to 0, where it
started.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For today’s investor, the ideal strategy for pursuing this
“formula” is rebalancing, which we discuss on pp. 104–105.</p></li>
<li><p>Most companies today provide “an engraved stock certificate” only
upon special request. Stocks exist, for the most part, in purely
electronic form (much as your bank account contains computerized credits
and debits, not actual currency) and thus have become even easier to
trade than they were in Graham’s day.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Net asset value, book value, balance-sheet value, and
tangible-asset value are all synonyms for net worth, or the total value
of a company’s physical and financial assets minus all its liabilities.
It can be calculated using the balance sheets in a company’s annual and
quarterly reports; from total shareholders’ equity, subtract all “soft”
assets such as goodwill, trademarks, and other intangibles. Divide by
the fully diluted number of shares outstanding to arrive at book value
per share.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham’s use of the word “paradox” is probably an allusion to a
classic article by David Durand, “Growth Stocks and the Petersburg
Paradox,” The Journal of Finance, vol. XII, no. 3, September, 1957,
pp. 348–363, which compares investing in high-priced growth stocks to
betting on a series of coin flips in which the payoff escalates with
each flip of the coin. Durand points out that if a growth stock could
continue to grow at a high rate for an indefinite period of time, an
investor should (in theory) be willing to pay an infinite price for its
shares. Why, then, has no stock ever sold for a price of infinity
dollars per share? Because the higher the assumed future growth rate,
and the longer the time period over which it is expected, the wider the
margin for error grows, and the higher the cost of even a tiny
miscalculation becomes. Graham discusses this problem further in
Appendix 4(p. 570).</p></li>
<li><p>The more recent history of A andandandand P is no different. At
year-end 1999, its share price was 7.875; at year-end 2000, .00; a year
later, 3.78; at year-end 2002, .06. Although some accounting
irregularities later came to light at A andandandand P, it defies all
logic to believe that the value of a relatively stable business like
groceries could fall by three-fourths in one year, triple the next year,
then drop by two-thirds the year after that.</p></li>
<li><p>“Only to the extent that it suits his book” means “only to the
extent that the price is favorable enough to justify selling the stock.”
In traditional brokerage lingo, the “book” is an investor’s ledger of
holdings and trades.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† This may well be the single most important paragraph in Graham’s
entire book. In these 113 words Graham sums up his lifetime of
experience. You cannot read these words too often; they are like
Kryptonite for bear markets. If you keep them close at hand and let them
guide you throughout your investing life, you will survive whatever the
markets throw at you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Graham has much more to say on what is now known as “corporate
governance.” See the commentary on Chapter 19.</p></li>
<li><p>By what Graham called “the rule of opposites,” in 2002 the yields
on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds hit their lowest levels since 1963.
Since bond yields move inversely to prices, those low yields meant that
prices had risen—making investors most eager to buy just as bonds were
at their most expensive and as their future returns were almost
guaranteed to be low. This provides another proof of Graham’s lesson
that the intelligent investor must refuse to make decisions based on
market fluctuations.</p></li>
<li><p>An updated analysis for today’s readers, explaining recent yields
and the wider variety of bonds and bond funds available today, can be
found in the commentary on Chapter 4.</p></li>
<li><p>As mentioned in the commentary on Chapters 2 and 4, Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are a new and improved version
of what Graham is suggesting here.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 See Graham’s text, pp. 204–205.</p>
<p>2 As Graham noted in a classic series of articles in 1932, the Great
Depression caused the shares of dozens of companies to drop below the
value of their cash and other liquid assets, making them “worth more
dead than alive.”</p>
<p>3 News release, The Spectrem Group, “Plan Sponsors Are Losing the
Battle to Prevent Declining Participation and Deferrals into Defined
Contribution Plans,” October 25, 2002.</p>
<p>4 A few months later, on March 10, 2000—the very day that NASDAQ hit
its all-time high—online trading pundit James J. Cramer wrote that he
had “repeatedly” been tempted in recent days to sell Berkshire Hathaway
short, a bet that Buffett’s stock had farther to fall. With a vulgar
thrust of his rhetorical pelvis, Cramer even declared that Berkshire’s
shares were “ripe for the banging.” That same day, market strategist
Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities asked, “Norfolk Southern or
Cisco Systems: Where do you want to be in the future?” Cisco, a key to
tomorrow’s Internet superhighway, seemed to have it all over Norfolk
Southern, part of yesterday’s railroad system. (Over the next year,
Norfolk Southern gained 35%, while Cisco lost 70%.)</p>
<p>5 When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding,
Graham had a concise answer: “The primary cause of failure is that they
pay too much attention to what the stock market is doing currently.” See
“Benjamin Graham: Thoughts on Security Analysis” 〔transcript of lecture
at Northeast Missouri State University Business School, March, 1972〕,
Financial History magazine, no. 42, March, 1991, p. 8.</p>
<p>6 Never mind what these terms mean, or are supposed to mean. While in
public these classifications are treated with the utmost respect, in
private most people in the investment business regard them with the
contempt normally reserved for jokes that aren’t funny.</p>

<p>10 It’s also worth asking whether you could enjoy living in your
house if its market price was reported to the last penny every day in
the newspapers and on TV.</p>
<p>11 In a series of remarkable experiments in the late 1980s, a
psychologist at Columbia and Harvard, Paul Andreassen, showed that
investors who received frequent news updates on their stocks earned half
the returns of investors who got no news at all. See Jason Zweig,
“Here’s How to Use the News and Tune Out the Noise,” Money, July, 1998,
pp. 63–64.</p>
<p>12 Federal tax law is subject to constant change. The example of
Coca-Cola stock given here is valid under the provisions of the U.S. tax
code as it stood in early 2003.</p>
<p>13 This example assumes that the investor had no realized capital
gains in 2002 and did not reinvest any Coke dividends. Tax swaps are not
to be undertaken lightly, since they can be mishandled easily. Before
doing a tax swap, read IRS Publication 550
(www.irs.gov/pub/irspdf/p550.pdf). A good guide to managing your
investment taxes is Robert N. Gordon with Jan M. Rosen, Wall Street
Secrets for Tax-Efficient Investing (Bloomberg Press, Princeton, New
Jersey, 2001). Finally, before you pull the trigger, consult a
professional tax adviser.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a violation of Federal law for an open-end mutual fund, a
closed-end fund, or an exchange-traded fund to sell shares to the public
unless it has “registered” (or made mandatory financial filings) with
the SEC.</li>
</ul>
<p>† The fund industry has gone from “very large” to immense. At
year-end 2002, there were 8,279 mutual funds holding .56 trillion; 514
closed-end funds with 49.6 billion in assets; and 116 exchange-trade
funds or ETFs with 09.7 billion. These figures exclude such fund-like
investments as variable annuities and unit investment trusts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lists of the major types of mutual funds can be found at
www.ici.org/ pdf/g2understanding.pdf and
http://news.morningstar.com/fundReturns/ CategoryReturns.html.
Letter-stock funds no longer exist, while hedge funds are generally
banned by SEC rules from selling shares to any investor whose annual
income is below 00,000 or whose net worth is below million.</li>
</ul>
<p>† Today, the maximum sales load on a stock fund tends to be around
5.75%. If you invest 0,000 in a fund with a flat 5.75% sales load, 75
will go to the person (and brokerage firm) that sold it to you, leaving
you with an initial net investment of ,425. The 75 sales charge is
actually 6.1% of that amount, which is why Graham calls the standard way
of calculating the charge a “sales gimmick.” Since the 1980s, no-load
funds have become popular, and they no longer tend to be smaller than
load funds.</p>
<p>† Nearly every mutual fund today is taxed as a “regulated investment
company,” or RIC, which is exempt from corporate income tax so long as
it pays out essentially all of its income to its shareholders. In the
“option” that Graham omits “to avoid clutter,” a fund can ask the SEC
for special permission to distribute one of its holdings directly to the
fund’s shareholders—as his Graham-Newman Corp. did in 1948, parceling
out shares in GEICO to Graham-Newman’s own investors. This sort of
distribution is extraordinarily rare.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-purpose funds, popular in the late 1980s, have essentially
disappeared from the marketplace—a shame, since they offered investors a
more flexible way to take advantage of the skills of great stock pickers
like John Neff. Perhaps the recent bear market will lead to a
renaissance of this attractive investment vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>† “Performance funds” were all the rage in the late 1960s. They were
equivalent to the aggressive growth funds of the late 1990s, and served
their investors no better.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For periods as long as 10 years, the returns of the Dow and the S
andandandand P 500 can diverge by fairly wide margins. Over the course
of the typical investing lifetime, however—say 25 to 50 years—their
returns have tended to converge quite closely.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the “doomed companies” Graham refers to was National
Student Marketing Corp., a con game masquerading as a stock, whose saga
was told brilliantly in Andrew Tobias’s The Funny Money Game (Playboy
Press, New York, 1971). Among the supposedly sophisticated investors who
were snookered by NSM’s charismatic founder, Cort Randell, were the
endowment funds of Cornell and Harvard and the trust departments at such
prestigious banks as Morgan Guaranty and Bankers Trust.</p></li>
<li><p>As only the latest proof that “the more things change, the more
they stay the same,” consider that Ryan Jacob, a 29-year-old boy wonder,
launched the Jacob Internet Fund at year-end 1999, after producing a
216% return at his previous dot-com fund. Investors poured nearly 00
million into Jacob’s fund in the first few weeks of 2000. It then
proceeded to lose 79.1% in 2000, 56.4% in 2001, and 13% in 2002—a
cumulative collapse of 92%. That loss may have made Mr. Jacob’s
investors even older and wiser than it made him.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>† Intriguingly, the disastrous boom and bust of 1999–2002 also came
roughly 35 years after the previous cycle of insanity. Perhaps it takes
about 35 years for the investors who remember the last “New Economy”
craze to become less influential than those who do not. If this
intuition is correct, the intelligent investor should be particularly
vigilant around the year 2030.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today’s equivalent of Graham’s “scarce exceptions” tend to be
open-end funds that are closed to new investors—meaning that the
managers have stopped taking in any more cash. While that reduces the
management fees they can earn, it maximizes the returns their existing
shareholders can earn. Because most fund managers would rather look out
for No. 1 than be No. 1, closing a fund to new investors is a rare and
courageous step.</li>
</ul>
<p>1 See Jason Zweig, “Did You Beat the Market?” Money, January, 2000,
pp. 55–58; Time /CNN poll #15, October 25–26, 2000, question 29.</p>
<p>1 Sector funds specializing in almost every imaginable industry are
available—and date back to the 1920s. After nearly 80 years of history,
the evidence is overwhelming: The most lucrative, and thus most popular,
sector of any given year often turns out to be among the worst
performers of the following year. Just as idle hands are the devil’s
workshop, sector funds are the investor’s nemesis.</p>

<p>3 That’s not to say that these funds would have done better if their
“super-star” managers had stayed in place; all we can be sure of is that
the two funds did poorly without them.</p>
<p>4 There’s a second lesson here: To succeed, the individual investor
must either avoid shopping from the same list of favorite stocks that
have already been picked over by the giant institutions, or own them far
more patiently. See Erik R. Sirri and Peter Tufano, “Costly Search and

<p>11 Unlike a mutual fund, a closed-end fund does not issue new shares
directly to anyone who wants to buy them. Instead, an investor must buy
shares not from the fund itself, but from another shareholder who is
willing to part with them. Thus, the price of the shares fluctuates
above and below their net asset value, depending on supply and
demand.</p>

investors since 1982, which has reinforced its superb performance.</p>

<p>1 Alternatively, you could buy back the call option, but you would
have to take a loss on it—and options can have even higher trading costs
than stocks.</p>
<p>1 To put this statement in perspective, consider how often you are
likely to buy a stock at 0 and be able to sell it at 00.</p>

<p>3 A “hedge fund” is a pool of money, largely unregulated by the
government, invested aggressively for wealthy clients. For a superb

<p>5 Constance Loizos, “QandandandandA: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews,
May 17, 1999, p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history
was 25.8% per year, achieved by the legendary Peter Lynch of Fidelity
Magellan over the two decades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s
performance turned 0,000 into more than 82,000 in 20 years. Cheung was
predicting that his fund would turn 0,000 into more than million over
the same length of time. Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously
overoptimistic, investors threw money at him, flinging more than 00
million into his fund over the next year. A 0,000 investment in the
Monument Internet Fund in May 1999 would have shrunk to roughly ,000 by
year-end 2002. (The Monument fund no longer exists in its original form
and is now known as Orbitex Emerging Technology Fund.)</p>
<p>6 Lisa Reilly Cullen, “The Triple Digit Club,” Money, December, 1999,
p. 170. If you had invested 0,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999,
you would have finished 2002 with just ,195 left—one of the worst
destructions of wealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.</p>
<p>7 See www.thestreet.com/funds/smarter/891820.html. Cramer’s favorite
stocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By
year-end 2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a 0,000
investment spread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%,
leaving you with a grand total of 97.44. Perhaps Cramer meant that his
stocks would be “winners” not in “the new world,” but in the world to
come.</p>
<p>8 The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced
stage of retirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market.
Yet even an elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because
they have gone down in price; that approach not only turns her paper
losses into real ones but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit
those stocks at lower costs for tax purposes.</p>

<li><p>Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical
company, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He
also served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the
driving force behind the construction of the Empire State Building.
Calculations by finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s
plan would have grown to just under ,000 after 20 years, although
inflation would have eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent
look at Raskob’s views on long-term stock investing, see the essay by
financial adviser William Bernstein at

<li><p>Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and
pp. 191–192. For more detail on the Dow Theory, see

<p>† Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then
immediately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s
definition on p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report
unsustainably high returns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no
longer a concern for fund investors. Stock-option warrants are explained
in Chapter 16.</p>

<li><p>The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in
the United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21,
1970—shocking investors, who had never expected such a giant company to
go under (see. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham
had in mind were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see
pp. 425 and 463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged
between 1968 and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went
bust.</p></li>
<li><p>See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds
maturing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow
Jones Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is
not all that different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The
income generated by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since
1981.</p></li>
<li><p>“Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement
in the late 1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century
later. Among the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical
Securities and the Missiles-Rockets-Jets andandandand Automation Fund.
They, like the stocks they owned, turned out to be an investing
disaster. It is commonly accepted today that the cumulative earnings of
the airline industry over its entire history have been negative. The
lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid buying airline
stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty” that any
industry will outperform all others in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real
estate, factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial
balances (such as cash, short-term investments, and accounts
receivable). Among the elements not included in tangible assets are
brands, copyrights, patents, franchises, goodwill, and trademarks. To
see how to calculate tangible-asset value, see footnote † on
p. 198.</p></li>
